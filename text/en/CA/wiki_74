<text>Brimstone is a ground or air-launched ground attack missile developed by MBDA UK for the UK&#x27;s Royal Air Force. It was originally intended for &quot;fire-and-forget&quot; use against mass formations of enemy armour, using a millimetre wave (mmW) active radar homing seeker to ensure accuracy even against moving targets. Experience in Afghanistan led to the addition of laser guidance in the dual-mode Brimstone missile, allowing a &quot;spotter&quot; to pick out specific and the highest priority targets, particularly useful to minimise collateral damage when friendly forces or civilians were in the area. The tandem shaped-charge warhead is much more effective against modern tanks than older similar weapons such as the AGM-65G Maverick missile. Three Brimstones are carried on a launcher that occupies a single weapon station, allowing a single aircraft to carry many missiles.

After a protracted development programme, single-mode or &quot;millimetric&quot; Brimstone entered service with RAF Tornado aircraft in 2005, and the dual-mode variant in 2008. The latter was used extensively in Afghanistan and Libya. An improved Brimstone 2 was expected to enter service in October 2012, but problems with the new warhead from TDW and the ROXEL rocket motor put back the planned date to November 2015. MBDA is studying the use of Brimstone on ships, attack helicopters, UAVs, and from surface launchers. However, it will not be integrated on the Lockheed Martin F-35 Lightning II. Germany, Qatar and Saudi Arabia have purchased the missile. The cost per missile has been quoted as £175,000 each in 2015, or &quot;over £100,000&quot;.

==Development==
===Previous developments===
There had been a number of British air-to-ground anti-armour concepts developed during the 1970s and 1980s, including the SNEB rocket, the proposed Hawkswing version of Swingfire, and ultimately the BL.755 cluster bomb. There were some alternatives offered during this time, including the 1966 Hawker Siddeley Dynamics (HSD) Cluster Martel proposal that mounted a cluster dispenser on the front of the Martel airframe to provide standoff capability.

===AST.1227===
BL.755 formed the basis for the Royal Air Force&#x27;s (RAF) anti-armour air-to-ground strikes for many years, but it was always considered to be &quot;expensive&quot; if it needed to be used against individual targets instead of mass attacks. There were also concerns about the use of such weapons near friendly troops. This led to the late-1970s Air Staff Target 1227 (AST.1227) for a guided weapon to replace BL.755.

One early respondent to the AST.1227 was a modification of the small SRAM missile, which had originally be designed to be carried in pods containing multiple missiles, meaning that in the air-to-ground mode a large number could be carried. However, the Ministry of Technology expressed concerns about using an infrared seeker in the anti-tank role, especially due to the possible use of anti-IR &quot;dazzlers&quot; and other countermeasures.

The next attempt adapted the Rapier airframe to carry a laser seeker, either the Martin Marietta design used on the M712 Copperhead or a similar Swedish RB.83 which was also used in the ground-to-air role. The result was &quot;Sabre&quot;, which was expected to have a single-round hit rate of 80% and the ability for a single aircraft to carry up to 10 missiles. It also had the ability to be used on helicopters, not only as a replacement for Hawkswing, but also as an air-to-air weapon against enemy helicopters and low-flying aircraft.

AST.1227 was abandoned in 1981, and Sabre along with it, due to the development of &quot;smart&quot; munitions in the US. This led to the release of AST.1238 the same year, calling for a long-term project to develop a self-guided weapon using a millimetre wavelength (mmW) radar seeker.

===AST.1238===
The AST. 1238 received eight bids in November 1987, but down-selected to five in February 1988. These included the Hunting Engineering Smart Weapon Anti-Armour, an unpowered dispenser with sixteen submunitions that would be ejected at a pre-selected location and then use mmW seekers. BAe Dynamics proposed two designs, one from Hatfield based on the AGM-65 Maverick airframe with a new warhead and an imaging infrared seeker, and Stevenage had a second concept based on their Merlin anti-armour mortar round. BAE&#x27;s aircraft division added the DASA (by this point MBB SE) VERBAL system, and ML Aviation and Rheinmetall offered another cluster dispenser. Finally, Marconi and Rockwell offered Brimstone, a version of AGM-114 Hellfire with a mmW seeker. Texas Instruments entered Griffin-38, a small direct-attack weapon, but it was unpowered and lacked the required stand-off range.

The project was officially started in 1988, before the end of Cold War, and the project was cancelled.

===Gulf War experience, SR(A).1238===
Combat experience in the 1991 Gulf War led to a revaluation of many of the UK&#x27;s ongoing weapons programmes. The RAF concluded that their low-level attack doctrine had been made far too specialized in its role in performing deep interdiction strikes and anti-airfield attacks. When used in the anti-armour role, their Panavia Tornado aircraft were exposed to ground fire, and they concluded some level of stand-off weapon was needed. AST.1238 was reactivated and became Staff Requirement (Air) SR(A).1238.

SR(A).1238 received five new bids. The Thorn Anti-Armour Weapons System was a powered BL.775. Hunting proposed a small cruise missile based on the German Mehrzweckwaffe-2, a powered version of the German Mehrzweckwaffe-1 cluster bomb dispenser. Known as Smart Weapon Anti-ARMour (SWAARM), it ejected a small number of smart munitions instead of a large number of bombs. Texas Instruments entered the similar Griffin-38, but it was unpowered and lacked the required stand-off range.

This left two designs in the running. BAe Dynamics proposed an updated version of their earlier SRAM-based concept using the newer and larger ASRAAM to produce Typhoon. GEC-Marconi offered their Advanced Anti-Armour Weapon (AAAW), a more refined version of their earlier Hellfire-based concept, using a 9 GHz MMW seeker that was completely fire-and-forget and could be used in all weather. Typhoon did not come close in performance terms, and AAAW won the contest.

GEC-Marconi (whose missile interests now form part of MBDA) was originally awarded the contract on 7 November 1996.

The first ground firing of the Brimstone missile occurred in August 1999, followed by the first air-launched firing from a Tornado GR4 in September 2000.

==Design==
Brimstone has a tandem shaped-charge warhead employing a smaller initial charge around , designed to initiate reactive armour, followed by a larger, more destructive charge, designed to penetrate and defeat the base armour. It was estimated that Brimstone would be several times more effective than the AGM-65G Maverick against modern tanks, and 20 times more effective than the BL755 cluster bomb. In combat, Brimstone has demonstrated accuracy and reliability &quot;both well above 90 percent&quot; according to the MoD; Air Chief Marshal Sir Stephen Dalton has said that 98.3% to 98.7% of Brimstone fired in Libya &quot;did exactly what we expected&quot;.

===Targeting and sensors===
Brimstone is a &quot;fire-and-forget&quot; missile, which is loaded with targeting data by the weapon systems officer (WSO) prior to launch. It is programmable to adapt to particular mission requirements. This capability includes the ability to find targets within a certain area (such as those near friendly forces), and to self-destruct if it is unable to find a target within the designated area.

In addition to the semi-autonomous ability to decide its own targets, the Brimstone has the capacity to determine where on a target to best impact causing the most damage.
The missile&#x27;s advanced sensor package includes its extremely high frequency millimetric wave radar, which allows the weapon to image the target and hence choose a target location. With as many as twenty-four missiles in the air, the missile&#x27;s targeting system also required an algorithm to ensure that missiles hit their targets in a staggered order, rather than all simultaneously.

Brimstone can be fired in a number of attack profiles; direct or indirect against single targets, a column of targets or against an array of targets. The latter utilises a salvo attack capability for
multiple kills per engagement. Once launched, the platform is free to manoeuvre away from the target area or engage other targets.

===Launch system===
Each launch system carries three missiles on rails. This allows a single aircraft to carry large numbers of missiles; for example, a Typhoon fighter could carry up to six launch systems, which gives a maximum payload of eighteen Brimstone missiles, in addition to a useful air-to-air payload. The missile was carried by the Tornado GR4 aircraft in RAF service. In February 2014 the National Audit Office warned of a possible capability gap under existing plans to fit Brimstone to Typhoon in 2021, two years after the Tornado retired; in June 2014 the MoD announced a study to accelerate this to 2018 and look at a common launcher that could also launch SPEAR Cap 3. MBDA has fired test rounds from an MQ-9 Reaper drone and is studying the use of Brimstone on attack helicopters and from surface launchers.

It was intended that Brimstone would be integrated on the RAF Harrier aircraft fleet under Capability D of the JUMP programme with a scheduled in-service date of 2009. A Harrier GR9 first flew with 12 Brimstones on 14 February 2007. In late 2009 Brimstone was &quot;nearing completion for integration on the Harrier&quot;, but in July 2010 it was reported that this would be postponed until the insensitive-munition version of the missile became available in 2012. Brimstone had not been officially cleared for use on the type when the UK Harriers were withdrawn from service in late 2010.

Following the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, Britain decided to supply Ukraine with Brimstone missiles, however Ukraine did not have a suitable aircraft to launch the system. The UK developed a &quot;Wolfram armoured vehicle&quot;, based on an extended 6x6 Supacat chassis.

Brimstone 3 features surface-to-surface launch capability. A number of vehicle based launching options have been conceptualised for Brimstone such as ARES, a mission module for Boxer, Challenger 2, Supacat HMT, and a number of UGVs. 

==Operational service==

Operational clearance of the missile was delayed by 12 months due to the unavailability of a Tornado trials aircraft, as the RAF chose instead to rush the development of the Storm Shadow air launched cruise missile ahead of the Iraq war, but another delay of 6 months resulted from redesigning the autopilot for safe release at higher speeds. Over 2,000 missiles were produced.

===Dual-Mode Brimstone===
The original Brimstone could not be used in Afghanistan as the rules of engagement required a &quot;man-in-the-loop&quot;. Under an Urgent Operational Requirement in 2008, modifications were made to the seeker and software of over 300 existing missiles to create Dual-Mode Brimstone. The new missiles can be laser guided according to the STANAG 3733 standard as well as retaining the millimetre wave seeker; the pilot can select either mode from the cockpit or use both simultaneously. Laser guidance allows specific enemy targets to be picked out in cluttered environments, while the mmW radar ensures accuracy against moving targets.

The development and procurement of the original single-mode missiles cost £370m, a figure inflated by accounting charges relating to the delays. The development of the dual-mode version cost an additional £10m. &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; reported that the dual mode missiles cost £105,000, which is comparable to the cost of the AGM-65 Maverick; the MoD quote only a gross book value of £175,000, which includes development costs as well as the purchase cost of the missile. Upgrading a single-mode missile to dual mode costs between £35,000 and £45,000 plus VAT, depending on quantities ordered.

===Brimstone 2 (SPEAR 2)===
In March 2010 Brimstone was selected as the basis for the RAF&#x27;s requirement under the Selective Precision Effects At Range (SPEAR) Capability 2 Block 1 programme. The Demonstration and Manufacture contract increased the missile&#x27;s performance &quot;significantly&quot;, and converted the warhead and rocket motor to use insensitive munitions. Brimstone 2 has an improved seeker, a more modular design and improvements to airframe and software for &quot;an overall increase in performance with improvements in range and engagement footprint&quot;, including a &quot;more than 200% increase&quot; in maximum range. A five-release test campaign in October 2013 culminated in a successful strike against a pickup truck travelling at in a cluttered road environment. Brimstone 2 was planned to enter service on the Tornado in November 2015. It was further updated with an insensitive munition compliant rocket motor and warhead and entered service with the RAF in July 2016 for use on the Tornado GR4. It was also trialled on the Eurofighter Typhoon and AH-64E Apache.

In February 2016, integration trials with the Tornado GR4s saw 11 missiles fired at &quot;[various] structures, a very small fast-moving vehicle, and [targets at the] edge of the weapon system’s performance envelope.&quot; All in all 10, or 91%, of the 11 missiles were successful; the only missile that missed its target was involved in a very short-range shot in which the missile&#x27;s semi-active laser homing and millimetric-Wave seekers did not have enough time to effectively acquire its target.

In July 2016, MBDA further proposed a new variant of Brimstone 2 for the AH-64E Apache. It would specifically be for non-armoured targets in land and sea domains, but will not compromise Brimstone&#x27;s anti-armour capability. It will have a launch aircraft cockpit-selectable trajectory, which will allow line-of-sight engagement (flat trajectory) and high and low missile flight profiles to avoid close-in obstacles; a cockpit-selectable capability that allows the pilot to determine the elevation and impact angle on the target to maximise weapon effect; and a new set of warhead modes, which includes delayed, airburst, impact and proximity fuzing. This weapon will be known as the Future Attack Helicopter Weapon (FAHW).

===Naval-launched Brimstone Sea SPEAR===
MBDA tested a maritime variant for use against swarms of small boats named Sea SPEAR. On 25 June 2012 a Tornado GR4 dropped a prototype that hit and sank a 6-metre inflatable boat travelling at 20 kn in sea state 3. On 29 May 2013, MBDA conducted a salvo firing of three millimetric wave operational Brimstone missiles, launched from a fixed offshore platform, against a simulated attack formation of five targets representing FIACs (Fast Inshore Attack Craft). The successful test firing demonstrated Sea SPEAR&#x27;s ability to strike numerous individual targets. During the test one of the targets, a 15-metre craft, was travelling at 20 knots. MBDA pitted Sea SPEAR against the Raytheon Sea Griffin missile for integration onto American littoral combat ships. The US Navy instead selected the AGM-114L Hellfire as a stop-gap missile for the littoral combat ships.

===Brimstone 3===
In March 2019, MBDA successfully tested the latest Brimstone 3 version in Sweden, now including surface-to-surface firing, plus new hardware allowing future enhancements. The upgrades included a new Internal measurement unit, enhanced autopilot, improved battery for an addition 30% engagement duration and a new improved multi-effect warhead that was Insensitive fully compliant with STANAG 4439. 

Brimstone 3 will be integrated onto the RAF&#x27;s MQ-9B Protector fleet alongside Paveway IV. Spain and Germany intend to use Brimstone 3 on their Eurofighters and the UK intends to use it to replace their already equipped Brimstone 2 stockpile.

Brimstone 3 is also being offered to the British Army as part of MBDA&#x27;s bid for the Mounted Close Combat Overwatch program which aims to provide an under-armour, non-line-of-sight, anti-armour capability to frontline forces as an overdue capability replacement for Swingfire. 

===SPEAR 3===

In 2010, as part of its bid for the RAF&#x27;s Select Precision Effects At Range (SPEAR) Capability 3 program MBDA proposed, and was later awarded an assessment phase contract for a network-enabled, 100 kg class, standoff missile which reuses technology derived from Brimstone now referred to as SPEAR 3.

=== Land Precision Strike ===

As part of the British Army&#x27;s Deep Fires Modernisation of its M270 MLRS fleet and the associated &#x27;One launcher, Many Payloads&#x27; concepts, the UK is developing a number of new effectors to work alongside its upcoming procurement of GMLRS-ER rockets. One of these effects, Land Precision Strike, under development by MBDA, reuses technology from Brimstone as well as CAMM and aims to create a 80-150km ranged missile for use against fleeting (Moving) targets.

==Operational use==
===Royal Air Force===

In March 2005, Brimstone entered service with No. 31 Squadron RAF. Full Operational Capability (FOC) was declared for the Tornado GR4 in December 2005 The first operational sortie of dual-mode Brimstone was over Iraq as part of Operation Telic on 18 December 2008 by a Tornado GR4 of IX(B) Squadron. It was first fired in combat in June 2009, the month in which the Tornado GR4s of 12 Squadron arrived in Afghanistan as part of Operation Herrick.

Brimstone was used during Operation Ellamy over Libya in 2011. Sixty Brimstone were fired in the first four weeks of the Libya campaign, out of 110 Brimstone fired in all operations up to that time. This prompted the MoD to ask MBDA to convert more missiles to the dual-mode version. 150 dual-mode missiles had been ordered in December 2010, but according to the Royal United Services Institute, stocks of usable dual-mode missiles fell to single figures at one stage of the Libya campaign. The 500th dual-mode Brimstone was delivered in March 2012, at which time over 200 had been fired in combat. The single-mode missile was not fired in combat until 15 September 2011 when a pair of RAF Tornado GR4 of IX(B) Squadron fired 22 missiles (including a salvo of 12 by one aircraft) against an armoured column near Sebha/Sabha, 400 miles south of Tripoli.

In September 2014, Tornado GR4 strike aircraft of No. 2 Squadron RAF began flying armed sorties over Iraq in support of Operation Shader, the UK&#x27;s contribution to the Military intervention against the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant. On September 30, the aircraft flew their first bombing raids, engaging a heavy artillery position with a Paveway IV laser-guided bomb, and an armed pickup truck with a Brimstone air-to-ground missile. Brimstone is the preferred weapon for these kinds of targets due to its effectiveness against moving targets.
In December 2015, the UK started using Brimstone missiles in Syria. By March 2017, the RAF had used 97 missiles in Iraq and 73 in Syria.

===Export sales===
Around £10 million of Brimstones from the RAF stock were sold to the Royal Saudi Air Force for use on its Tornados. In April 2011, the RAF&#x27;s Assistant Chief of the Air Staff Air Vice-Marshal Baz North reported that the missiles were &quot;being sought by both the United States of America and the French&quot; in the light of Brimstone&#x27;s success in Libya. France&#x27;s DGA procurement agency held meetings in late May 2011 to discuss a lightweight air-to-surface weapon for the Dassault Rafale aircraft; Stéphane Reb of the DGA would merely say that &quot;Brimstone is a solution, but it&#x27;s not the only option&quot;. In early 2014 the US Congress&#x27; House Armed Services Committee showed interest again in the missile; high-ranking members of the US armed services have stated they &quot;like it&quot;. The French Air Force were still thinking about a purchase in March 2012, with a prime consideration being lower collateral damage compared to the AASM missile. India made a request for information about integrating Brimstone on their Sukhoi Su-30MKI fighter fleet. In July 2014, it was revealed that the United States Navy was studying the Dual Mode Brimstone for use on the Boeing F/A-18E/F Super Hornet aircraft. The United States Army also considered the Brimstone as &quot;an option&quot; in its Joint Air-to-Ground Missile (JAGM) program, but selected Lockheed Martin&#x27;s dual-mode seeker upgrade for the Hellfire missile. In September 2015, MBDA displayed the dual-mode Brimstone for the first time as a helicopter-mounted weapon to fulfill the British Army Air Corps&#x27; need for a future attack helicopter weapon for the AgustaWestland Apache. In January 2016, it was reported that Germany was considering arming its newly leased Heron TP drones with Brimstone. In March 2016, France was reportedly considering Brimstone for its Tiger attack helicopters.

In December 2017 it was announced that Qatar had purchased Brimstone missiles to arm its Eurofighter Typhoon fighter aircraft. In September 2019, MBDA was reportedly partnering with the Polish defence firm PGZ to produce a Brimstone carrying missile tank destroyer. The two proposed variants consist of one vehicle based on a modernised BMP-1 infantry fighting vehicle chassis, carrying a launch module of 12 missiles. The other is based on the K9 Thunder howitzer chassis, featuring three launch modules of eight missiles each.

In May 2022 MBDA and the Polish Armaments Group announced that Brimstone would arm the latter&#x27;s upcoming tank destroyer.

In June 2024, it was reported that Germany had decided to purchase 3,266 Brimstone 3 missiles for its Eurofighter Typhoon aircraft.

==== Russo-Ukrainian War ====

In April 2022, the UK Ministry of Defence supplied Brimstones to the Ukrainian Armed Forces for use as a surface-launched ground-attack system to strike Russian ground forces. By 12 May 2022, training on a surface-launch system was happening in Ukraine. On 17 May 2022, it was claimed that ground-launched Brimstone missiles had destroyed two Russian targets. It is claimed that these two targets are Russian tanks, operating behind their lines, and the missiles were fired by Ukrainian soldiers. If correct, it would be the first time a surface-launched Brimstone missile has destroyed a target.

On 22 November 2022, the UK has started supplying Brimstone 2 missiles to the Armed Forces of Ukraine. Brought into service in 2016 it has double the range of the first Brimstone. It has an inertial navigation system and can get to an area on autopilot before choosing targets autonomously. However it is still being fired by trucks which reduce its range compared to air launched versions since a ground launched missile lacks &quot;an aircraft&#x27;s speed and altitude&quot; - as a converted multiple rocket launcher system. A number of Wolfram vehicles, based on an extended 6x6 Supacat chassis with an 8 pack Brimstone MLRS launcher, were delivered to the AFU in 2023.

On August 23, 2023, a Brimstone-2 missile fired from a Ukrainian boat destroyed a Russian S-400 missile site in Cape Tarkhankut in western Crimea.

On July 7, 2024 the Defence Secretary John Healey from newly elected government of UK, said the UK would provide nearly 100 precision Brimstone missiles

<text>Sidney Preston Osborn (May 17, 1884 – May 25, 1948) was an American politician who was the first secretary of state of Arizona, and later the seventh governor of Arizona and is, as of 2025, the only governor of Arizona to be elected to four consecutive terms (Governors of Arizona served 2-year terms without limits until 1968, when it was changed to serve 4-year terms, and again in 1992 to a limit of two terms at a time). Osborn is also the second native-born governor of Arizona, preceded by Thomas Edward Campbell.

==Early years and political rise==

Born May 17, 1884 in Phoenix Arizona, Osborn worked as a page for the Arizona Territorial Legislature in 1898, and later a secretary to the Congressional Delegate John Frank Wilson (1903–1905). For a time Osborn worked as a newspaper reporter and editor; later he served as a delegate to the Arizona state constitutional convention of 1910.

==Career in the state of Arizona==

Despite being elected three times as secretary of state by wide margins in the 1910s, Osborn had little political success for the next two decades. He lost two primaries for governor in 1924 and 1938, and a Senate primary against Henry F. Ashurst in 1934. Despite a narrow primary win in 1940, his elections as a gubernatorial nominee never went below 60% of the vote.

His governing style was no-nonsense. The best example occurred at the very beginning of his governorship: Upon taking office, Osborn had the state&#x27;s top officials turn in a signed, but undated, resignation letter. If an official became an embarrassment to the state, Osborn would date the letter, and announce the official had resigned.

During his fourth term, Osborn suffered from Lou Gehrig&#x27;s Disease and was hardly able to communicate with his staff. He eventually died in office in 1948 and was succeeded by Dan Garvey. Osborn was buried in Phoenix&#x27;s Greenwood/Memory Lawn Mortuary &amp; Cemetery.

Despite numerous conceptions, Osborn Road in Phoenix was not named after Osborn. It was first named as such in 1900, after Governor Osborn&#x27;s grandfather John Preston Osborn, when Governor Osborn was 16. John Preston and the Governor&#x27;s father Neri Osborn both served in the territorial legislature.

<text>Macha (Russian: Мача) is a field of five meteorite craters located 685 kilometers (425 miles) northeast of Yakutsk in the Sakha Republic in Siberia, Russia, ranging from in diameter.

The two largest craters form the pear-shaped Abram Lake while the remaining three are located to the north. They have been very well preserved.

The craters are the result of the fall of possible iron meteorites at approximately 5300 BCE (Holocene), which would give them an age of about 7,300 years.

<text>Richard Stewart Addinsell (13 January 190414 November 1977) was an English composer, best known for film music, primarily his &quot;Warsaw Concerto&quot;, composed for the 1941 film &quot;Dangerous Moonlight&quot; (also known under the later title &quot;Suicide Squadron&quot;).

==Biography==

===Early life===
Richard Addinsell was born in Woburn Square, London, to William Arthur Addinsell, who was a chartered accountant, and his wife, Annie Beatrice Richards. The younger of two brothers, Addinsell was educated at home before attending Hertford College, Oxford, to study Law but went down after just 18 months. He then became interested in music.

===Early career===
In 1925, he enrolled at the Royal College of Music but lasted only two terms before leaving, again without obtaining any formal qualification. By this time Addinsell was already collaborating with Noel Gay, among others, in an &quot;André Charlot Revue&quot;. More work for Charlot in 1927 was followed in 1928 by a collaboration with Clemence Dane on &quot;Adam&#x27;s Opera&quot; at The Old Vic. In 1929, he completed his informal education by touring Europe to visit major theatrical and musical centres such as Berlin and Vienna.

In 1932, with Clemence Dane, he wrote the incidental music for the Broadway adaptation of the combined &quot;Alice in Wonderland&quot; and &quot;Through the Looking Glass&quot; by Eva Le Gallienne, starring Josephine Hutchinson (produced 1933). In 1947 it was revived, starring Bambi Linn.

===Career in film composition===
The &quot;Warsaw Concerto&quot; was written for the 1941 film &quot;Dangerous Moonlight&quot;, and continues to be a popular concert and recording piece. The film-makers wanted something in the style of Sergei Rachmaninoff, but were unable to persuade Rachmaninoff himself to write a piece. Roy Douglas orchestrated the concerto. It has been recorded over one hundred times and has sold in excess of three million copies. Addinsell also scored Hitchcock&#x27;s &quot;Under Capricorn&quot; (1949), referencing Irish folk melody in the score to support the Irish characters and their history.

Addinsell also wrote the short orchestral piece &quot;Southern Rhapsody&quot;, which was played every morning at the start of TV broadcasts by the former Southern Television company in the south of England from 1958 to 1981.

As was common with film music until the 1950s, many of Addinsell&#x27;s scores were destroyed by the studios as it was assumed there would be no further interest in them. However, recordings of his film music have been issued since his death, often reconstructed by musicologist and composer Philip Lane from the soundtracks of the films themselves and conducted by Kenneth Alwyn or Rumon Gamba.

===Later career===
He collaborated from 1942 with Joyce Grenfell for her West End revues (including &quot;Tuppence Coloured&quot; and &quot;Penny Plain&quot;) and her one-woman shows. He also wrote for West End musical revues directed by Laurier Lister, including &quot;Airs on a Shoestring&quot; Addinsell&#x27;s music is in the &quot;English light music&quot; style. He regularly composed at the piano, providing other creative musicians such as Roy Douglas, Leonard Isaacs or Douglas Gamley with broad indications for their full orchestrations. Orchestral works composed (or adapted) for the concert hall include &quot;The Invitation Waltz&quot; (1950), the &quot;Smokey Mountains Concerto&quot; (1950) and &quot;The Isle of Apples&quot; (1965).

==Personal life==
Addinsell retired from public life in the 1960s, gradually becoming estranged from his close friends. He was, for many years, the companion of the fashion designer Victor Stiebel, who died in 1976.

Addinsell died in Brighton in 1977 aged 73. His cremation took place at Golders Green Crematorium on 18 November 1977.
His ashes are buried there in a communal section of the crocus lawn.

<text>Marquez crater is a meteorite crater located in Leon County, Texas near the small town of Marquez about northeast of Austin, Texas, United States.

It is in diameter and the age is estimated to be 58 ± 2 million years (Paleocene). The crater is not exposed at the surface, but some surface formations including the Marquez Dome are thought to be exposed portions of the rebound peak. This includes a circular region of disturbed Cretaceous sedimentary rocks roughly in diameter at the surface. This may be associated with a central peak rising at least above the base of the buried crater. The uplift was initially thought to indicate an underlying salt dome by early investigators, but this origin was ruled out by reflection seismology and the discovery of features like shatter cones strongly associated with meteoric origin.

<doc id="780318" wikidata="Q1392038" url="?curid=780318" title="Middlesboro crater">
<text>The Middlesboro crater (or astrobleme) is a meteorite crater in Kentucky, United States. It is named after the city of Middlesboro, Kentucky, which today occupies much of the crater.

The crater is approximately 3 miles (about 5 km) wide and its age is estimated to be less than 300 million years (Permian). The impactor is estimated to have been about 100 m in diameter. 

==History==
The Middlesboro crater is located in the Appalachian Mountains, between the Cumberland Mountains and Pine Mountain. It forms part of the string of geological features that made the Cumberland Gap a critical westward passage during the settlement of Kentucky and the Ohio Valley in the late 18th and early 19th centuries.

== Settlements ==
The town of Middlesboro, built in the crater, was established in 1886 to exploit iron and coal deposits, although the town&#x27;s founder, Alexander A. Arthur, apparently did not know of the crater&#x27;s extraterrestrial origin. K. J. Englund and J. B. Roen, working for the U. S. Geological Survey, identified the impact basin in 1962.

==Geological features==
The long Cumberland Gap consists of four geologic features: the Yellow Creek valley, the natural gap in the Cumberland Mountain ridge, the eroded gap in Pine Mountain, and Middlesboro crater.

Middlesboro crater is a diameter meteorite impact crater in which Middlesboro, Kentucky, is located. The crater was identified in 1966 when Robert Dietz discovered shatter cones in sandstone, which led to the further identification of shocked quartz. Shatter cones, a rock shattering pattern naturally formed only during impact events, are found in abundance in the area. In September 2003 the site was designated a Distinguished Geologic Site by the Kentucky Society of Professional Geologists.

Without Middlesboro crater, it would have been difficult for packhorses to navigate this gap, formed by differential erosion along one of the subsequent cross faults, and improbable that wagon roads would have been constructed at an early date. Middlesboro is the only place in the world where coal is mined inside an impact crater. Special mining techniques must be used in the complicated strata of this crater. (Milam &amp; Kuehn, 36).

== Industrial activity ==
While coal mining is still the town&#x27;s primary economic driver, local leaders hope to turn the crater into a tourist destination. In 2003, the Kentucky Society of Professional Geologists designated the area a Distinguished Geologic Site, and the construction of the Cumberland Gap Tunnel makes the town a convenient source of supplies for visitors to Cumberland Gap National Historical Park.

<doc id="780320" wikidata="Q671136" url="?curid=780320" title="Synaptic vesicle">
<text>In a neuron, synaptic vesicles (or neurotransmitter vesicles) store various neurotransmitters that are released at the synapse. The release is regulated by a voltage-dependent calcium channel. Vesicles are essential for propagating nerve impulses between neurons and are constantly recreated by the cell. The area in the axon that holds groups of vesicles is an axon terminal or &quot;terminal bouton&quot;. Up to 130 vesicles can be released per bouton over a ten-minute period of stimulation at 0.2 Hz. In the visual cortex of the human brain, synaptic vesicles have an average diameter of 39.5 nanometers (nm) with a standard deviation of 5.1 nm.

== Structure ==
Synaptic vesicles are relatively simple because only a limited number of proteins fit into a sphere of 40 nm diameter. Purified vesicles have a protein:phospholipid ratio of 1:3 with a lipid composition of 40% phosphatidylcholine, 32% phosphatidylethanolamine, 12% phosphatidylserine, 5% phosphatidylinositol, and 10% cholesterol.

Synaptic vesicles contain two classes of obligatory components: transport proteins involved in neurotransmitter uptake, and trafficking proteins that participate in synaptic vesicle exocytosis, endocytosis, and recycling.
* Transport proteins are composed of proton pumps that generate electrochemical gradients, which allow for neurotransmitter uptake, and neurotransmitter transporters that regulate the actual uptake of neurotransmitters. The necessary proton gradient is created by V-ATPase, which breaks down ATP for energy. Vesicular transporters move neurotransmitters from the cells&#x27; cytoplasm into the synaptic vesicles. Vesicular glutamate transporters, for example, sequester glutamate into vesicles by this process.
* Trafficking proteins are more complex. They include intrinsic membrane proteins, peripherally bound proteins, and proteins such as SNAREs. These proteins do not share a characteristic that would make them identifiable as synaptic vesicle proteins, and little is known about how these proteins are specifically deposited into synaptic vesicles. Many but not all of the known synaptic vesicle proteins interact with non-vesicular proteins and are linked to specific functions.

The stoichiometry for the movement of different neurotransmitters into a vesicle is given in the following table.
Recently, it has been discovered that synaptic vesicles also contain small RNA molecules, including transfer RNA fragments, Y RNA fragments and mirRNAs. This discovery is believed to have broad impact on studying chemical synapses.

=== Effects of neurotoxins ===
Some neurotoxins, such as batrachotoxin, are known to destroy synaptic vesicles. The tetanus toxin damages vesicle-associated membrane proteins (VAMP), a type of v-SNARE, while botulinum toxins damage t-SNARES and v-SNARES and thus inhibit synaptic transmission. A spider toxin called alpha-Latrotoxin binds to neurexins, damaging vesicles and causing massive release of neurotransmitters.

=== Vesicle pools ===
Vesicles in the nerve terminal are grouped into three pools: the readily releasable pool, the recycling pool, and the reserve pool. These pools are distinguished by their function and position in the nerve terminal. The readily releasable pool are docked to the cell membrane, making these the first group of vesicles to be released on stimulation. The readily releasable pool is small and is quickly exhausted. The recycling pool is proximate to the cell membrane, and tend to be cycled at moderate stimulation, so that the rate of vesicle release is the same as, or lower than, the rate of vesicle formation. This pool is larger than the readily releasable pool, but it takes longer to become mobilised. The reserve pool contains vesicles that are not released under normal conditions. This reserve pool can be quite large (~50%) in neurons grown on a glass substrate, but is very small or absent at mature synapses in intact brain tissue.

== Physiology ==
=== Synaptic vesicle cycle ===
The events of the synaptic vesicle cycle can be divided into a few key steps:

;1. Trafficking to the synapse

Synaptic vesicle components in the presynaptic neuron are initially trafficked to the synapse using members of the kinesin motor family. In &quot;C. elegans&quot; the major motor for synaptic vesicles is UNC-104. There is also evidence that other proteins such as UNC-16/Sunday Driver regulate the use of motors for transport of synaptic vesicles.

;2. Transmitter loading

Once at the synapse, synaptic vesicles are loaded with a neurotransmitter. Loading of transmitter is an active process requiring a neurotransmitter transporter and a proton pump ATPase that provides an electrochemical gradient. These transporters are selective for different classes of transmitters. Characterization of unc-17 and unc-47, which encode the vesicular acetylcholine transporter and vesicular GABA transporter have been described to date.

;3. Docking

The loaded synaptic vesicles must dock near release sites, however docking is a step of the cycle that we know little about. Many proteins on synaptic vesicles and at release sites have been identified, however none of the identified protein interactions between the vesicle proteins and release site proteins can account for the docking phase of the cycle. Mutants in rab-3 and munc-18 alter vesicle docking or vesicle organization at release sites, but they do not completely disrupt docking. SNARE proteins, now also appear to be involved in the docking step of the cycle.

;4. Priming

After the synaptic vesicles initially dock, they must be primed before they can begin fusion. Priming prepares the synaptic vesicle so that they are able to fuse rapidly in response to a calcium influx. This priming step is thought to involve the formation of partially assembled SNARE complexes. The proteins Munc13, RIM, and RIM-BP participate in this event. Munc13 is thought to stimulate the change of the t-SNARE syntaxin from a closed conformation to an open conformation, which stimulates the assembly of v-SNARE /t-SNARE complexes. RIM also appears to regulate priming, but is not essential for the step.

;5. Fusion

Primed vesicles fuse very quickly with the cell membrane in response to calcium elevations in the cytoplasm. This releases the stored neurotransmitter into the synaptic cleft. The fusion event is thought to be mediated directly by the SNAREs and driven by the energy provided from SNARE assembly. The calcium-sensing trigger for this event is the calcium-binding synaptic vesicle protein synaptotagmin. The ability of SNAREs to mediate fusion in a calcium-dependent manner recently has been reconstituted in vitro. Consistent with SNAREs being essential for the fusion process, v-SNARE and t-SNARE mutants of &quot;C. elegans&quot; are lethal. Similarly, mutants in &quot;Drosophila&quot; and knockouts in mice indicate that these SNARES play a critical role in synaptic exocytosis.

;6. Endocytosis

This accounts for the re-uptake of synaptic vesicles in the full contact fusion model. However, other studies have been compiling evidence suggesting that this type of fusion and endocytosis is not always the case.

=== Vesicle recycling ===
Two leading mechanisms of action are thought to be responsible for synaptic vesicle recycling: full collapse fusion and the &quot;kiss-and-run&quot; method. Both mechanisms begin with the formation of the synaptic pore that releases transmitter to the extracellular space. After release of the neurotransmitter, the pore can either dilate fully so that the vesicle collapses completely into the synaptic membrane, or it can close rapidly and pinch off the membrane to generate kiss-and-run fusion.

==== Full collapse fusion ====
It has been shown that periods of intense stimulation at neural synapses deplete vesicle count as well as increase cellular capacitance and surface area. This indicates that after synaptic vesicles release their neurotransmitter payload, they merge with and become part of, the cellular membrane. After tagging synaptic vesicles with HRP (horseradish peroxidase), Heuser and Reese found that portions of the cellular membrane at the frog neuromuscular junction were taken up by the cell and converted back into synaptic vesicles. Studies suggest that the entire cycle of exocytosis, retrieval, and reformation of the synaptic vesicles requires less than 1 minute.

In full collapse fusion, the synaptic vesicle merges and becomes incorporated into the cell membrane. The formation of the new membrane is a protein mediated process and can only occur under certain conditions. After an action potential, Ca2+ floods to the presynaptic membrane. Ca2+ binds to specific proteins in the cytoplasm, one of which is synaptotagmin, which in turn trigger the complete fusion of the synaptic vesicle with the cellular membrane. This complete fusion of the pore is assisted by SNARE proteins. This large family of proteins mediate docking of synaptic vesicles in an ATP-dependent manner. With the help of synaptobrevin on the synaptic vesicle, the t-SNARE complex on the membrane, made up of syntaxin and SNAP-25, can dock, prime, and fuse the synaptic vesicle into the membrane.

The mechanism behind full collapse fusion has been shown to be the target of the botulinum and tetanus toxins. The botulinum toxin has protease activity which degrades the SNAP-25 protein. The SNAP-25 protein is required for vesicle fusion that releases neurotransmitters, in particular acetylcholine. Botulinum toxin essentially cleaves these SNARE proteins, and in doing so, prevents synaptic vesicles from fusing with the cellular synaptic membrane and releasing their neurotransmitters. Tetanus toxin follows a similar pathway, but instead attacks the protein synaptobrevin on the synaptic vesicle. In turn, these neurotoxins prevent synaptic vesicles from completing full collapse fusion. Without this mechanism in effect, muscle spasms, paralysis, and death can occur.

====&quot;Kiss-and-run&quot;====
The second mechanism by which synaptic vesicles are recycled is known as kiss-and-run fusion. In this case, the synaptic vesicle &quot;kisses&quot; the cellular membrane, opening a small pore for its neurotransmitter payload to be released through, then closes the pore and is recycled back into the cell. The kiss-and-run mechanism has been a hotly debated topic. Its effects have been observed and recorded; however the reason behind its use as opposed to full collapse fusion is still being explored. It has been speculated that kiss-and-run is often employed to conserve scarce vesicular resources as well as being utilized to respond to high-frequency inputs. Experiments have shown that kiss-and-run events do occur. First observed by Katz and del Castillo, it was later observed that the kiss-and-run mechanism was different from full collapse fusion in that cellular capacitance did not increase in kiss-and-run events. This reinforces the idea of a kiss-and-run fashion, the synaptic vesicle releases its payload and then separates from the membrane.

==== Modulation ====
Cells thus appear to have at least two mechanisms to follow for membrane recycling. Under certain conditions, cells can switch from one mechanism to the other. Slow, conventional, full collapse fusion predominates the synaptic membrane when Ca2+ levels are low, and the fast kiss-and-run mechanism is followed when Ca2+ levels are high.

Ales &quot;et al.&quot; showed that raised concentrations of extracellular calcium ions shift the preferred mode of recycling and synaptic vesicle release to the kiss-and-run mechanism in a calcium-concentration-dependent manner. It has been proposed that during secretion of neurotransmitters at synapses, the mode of exocytosis is modulated by calcium to attain optimal conditions for coupled exocytosis and endocytosis according to synaptic activity.

Experimental evidence suggests that kiss-and-run is the dominant mode of synaptic release at the beginning of stimulus trains. In this context, kiss-and-run reflects a high vesicle release probability. The incidence of kiss-and-run is also increased by rapid firing and stimulation of the neuron, suggesting that the kinetics of this type of release is faster than other forms of vesicle release.

== History ==
With the advent of the electron microscope in the early 1950s, nerve endings were found to contain a large number of electron-lucent (transparent to electrons) vesicles. The term synaptic vesicle was first introduced by De Robertis and Bennett in 1954. This was shortly after transmitter release at the frog neuromuscular junction was found to induce postsynaptic miniature end-plate potentials that were ascribed to the release of discrete packages of neurotransmitter (quanta) from the presynaptic nerve terminal. It was thus reasonable to hypothesize that the transmitter substance (acetylcholine) was contained in such vesicles, which by a secretory mechanism would release their contents into the synaptic cleft (vesicle hypothesis).

The missing link was the demonstration that the neurotransmitter acetylcholine is actually contained in synaptic vesicles. About ten years later, the application of subcellular fractionation techniques to brain tissue permitted the isolation first of nerve endings (synaptosomes), and subsequently of synaptic vesicles from mammalian brain. Two competing laboratories were involved in this work, that of Victor P. Whittaker at the Institute of Animal Physiology, Agricultural Research Council, Babraham, Cambridge, UK and that of Eduardo de Robertis at the Instituto de Anatomía General y Embriología, Facultad de Medicina, Universidad de Buenos Aires, Argentina. Whittaker&#x27;s work demonstrating acetylcholine in vesicle fractions from guinea-pig brain was first published in abstract form in 1960 and then in more detail in 1963 and 1964, and the paper of the de Robertis group demonstrating an enrichment of bound acetylcholine in synaptic vesicle fractions from rat brain appeared in 1963. Both groups released synaptic vesicles from isolated synaptosomes by osmotic shock. The content of acetylcholine in a vesicle was originally estimated to be 1000–2000 molecules. Subsequent work identified the vesicular localization of other neurotransmitters, such as amino acids, catecholamines, serotonin, and ATP. Later, synaptic vesicles could also be isolated from other tissues such as the superior cervical ganglion, or the octopus brain. The isolation of highly purified fractions of cholinergic synaptic vesicles from the ray &quot;Torpedo&quot; electric organ was an important step forward in the study of vesicle biochemistry and function.

<text>Mistastin crater is a meteorite crater in Labrador, Canada which contains the roughly circular Mistastin Lake. The lake is approximately in diameter, while the estimated diameter of the original crater is . The age of the crater is calculated to be 36.6 ± 2 million years (Eocene).

The lake was first identified as a possible impact crater in 1968, after being viewed from space.

==Location==
Mistastin crater, aka Kamestastin, is located in northwestern inland Labrador, due west of Natuashish, near the Quebec border. It lies within the traditional hunting grounds of the Mushuau Innu First Nation. Although it is not within a declared reserve, it does require permission to visit.

==Formation and geology==
Mistastin crater was created 36 million years ago by a violent asteroid impact. The presence of cubic zirconia around the crater rim suggests that the impact generated temperatures in excess of 43% that of the surface of the Sun and the highest crustal temperatures known on produced global changes that lasted for decades after the impact.

Mishta-minishtikᐡ, the lake&#x27;s arcuate central island, is interpreted to be the central uplift of the complex crater structure. The target rocks were part of a batholith composed of adamellite, mangerite and lenses of anorthosite. There are abundant shock metamorphic features exhibited in the rocks of the island. Planar deformation features, diaplectic glass, melt rocks, and shatter cones have been identified.

<text>Mizarai is a meteorite impact crater in Druskininkai municipality, Lithuania. The crater, being the second largest in the country, is not exposed to the surface and the site now hosts Mizarai village. The crater is about in diameter and about in depth. It was created by an asteroid, estimated in diameter, 500 ± 20 or 570 ± 50 million years ago (Cambrian or Neoproterozoic). The asteroid hit basement rock and shattered it up to deep. It was later buried under various sediments. Mizarai crater was discovered by Gediminas Motuza during an international seismic survey &quot;Eurobridge&quot;, which reached depths of .

<text>WCTM were the call letters assigned to an FM radio station, and later an AM station, both licensed to Eaton, Preble County, Ohio, United States.

==WCTM-FM==
WCTM (92.9 FM) was originally a station built by Stan Coning and three partners organized as Western Ohio Broadcasting Service, in 1959. The station&#x27;s call letters came from the partners in the venture: Ralph Waring, Stan Coning, Howard Toney, and T. Somers Markle. The first tower for the FM station was purchased from 700 WLW, and was tall. The tower was originally three separate AM tower/antennas, which had been used to keep the 500 kilowatt signal of WLW, allowed only during the 1930s and 1940s, out of Canada. The station aired an &quot;easy listening/beautiful music&quot; format. The original FM station&#x27;s studios, transmitter and tower were located at 505 North Barron Street in Eaton where Coning beforehand originally owned an appliance service business. For a time in the early-to-mid-1960s, WCTM was on the Cincinnati Reds Baseball Network and also aired play-by-play of area high school football and basketball games. In the 1960s, the station provided news and features from Eaton, Preble County and the surrounding area and also aired news and programming from the Mutual Broadcasting System.

WCTM-FM, with an -FM prefix added to the callsign in 1971, was sold in November 1974 to Great Trails Broadcasting, which was then the owner of WING in Dayton, WIZE in Springfield and WCOL-AM/FM in Columbus, and became WJAI. Great Trails spent a great deal of time and money moving the station&#x27;s tower to better serve the Dayton market. It became WJAI, continuing the easy-listening format until 1979, when it switched to a country music format. The station then changed to Big Band/Nostalgia/Adult Standards in 1982 before becoming WGTZ (&quot;Z-93&quot;), a Top 40 station, in 1984. That format switched in November 2007 to variety hits &quot;Fly 92.9&quot; (a local version of the &quot;Jack FM&quot; musical potpourri format which usually uses no air personalities)and is now branded as &quot;92.9 Jack FM.&quot;

==WCTM on AM==
After the FM station was sold, Coning focused on acquiring an AM license (he had originally wanted to build an AM station, but the lack of available frequencies led him to build the FM station first). After a 12-year struggle to obtain a frequency, WCTM (1130 AM) went on the air in 1981 as a daytime-only station and picked up where the FM left off a decade earlier, playing beautiful music. The studios and transmitter were located east of Eaton in an open field behind an abandoned drive-in theater (since razed) in the rural Preble County community of Glenwood (aka &quot;Ransom&quot; on some online highway maps near West Alexandria, which was the station&#x27;s mailing address).

Coning ran the operation by himself, using a home-built reel-to-reel automation system (a little box called a &quot;Tel-Timer&quot; gave the time and temperature in a computerized voice), while freelance voice-over announcers Darrel Studebaker, John Bauman (engineer) and Jim Linthicum voiced commercials, liners and announcements. The station&#x27;s call letters were often said on the air to mean &quot;We Cherish This Music&quot;.

In addition to its beautiful music format, WCTM aired farm and agricultural programming from Ed Johnson&#x27;s Agri Broadcast Network (for western Ohio farmers) and Derry Brownfield&#x27;s Brownfield Network (for eastern Indiana farmers), helping to earn the station its nickname, &quot;Radio Ranch 1130.&quot; This nickname was probably inspired by Ohio country music artist Donnie Bowser and the Radio Ranch Boys, and by KWKH, a country music station in Shreveport, Louisiana which also broadcast at 1130 kHz and used the &quot;Radio Ranch&quot; nickname.

WCTM aired local sports for a time, along with NASCAR coverage on weekends and the syndicated &quot;Waxworks&quot; nostalgia/big band program hosted by Gary Hannes. WCTM was also the first Ohio radio station to affiliate with Ted Turner&#x27;s CNN Radio in 1983. Later, the station aired USA Radio Network news and sports. In its final years, the &quot;beautiful music&quot; format was often peppered with Stan Coning&#x27;s soft-spoken recollections of his early life in Eaton and people he had known.

==The end of WCTM==
In its last few years, WCTM operated almost as a public service. Few commercials were heard, donations were accepted to help keep the station on the air, and sign-on/sign-off times were almost entirely dependent on how long Coning could remain at the station (a typical daily sign-off was around 5 P.M., with no broadcasts at all on Sundays). During this period, a friend of Coning&#x27;s with the on-air name of &quot;John Grant&quot; hosted weekly programs and assisted with station maintenance and operations.

Due to his failing health, which had taken the station off the air for extended periods of time, Stan Coning finally sold his little station to Town &amp; Country Broadcasting, owner of WBZI in Xenia. WCTM signed off for the last time on June 24, 2004, an event which was covered by two Dayton TV stations. As a one-man operation with an easy-listening format, WCTM was widely regarded as the last of its kind. According to industry observer Scott Fybush, the loss of WCTM and its format marked &quot;(the end of) the era of commercial beautiful music on American radio.&quot;

Today, the station lives on as WEDI, simulcasting WBZI&#x27;s programming. The old WCTM-FM tower, topped with the original call letters, still stands atop a building at 505 North Barron in downtown Eaton. After several years of deteriorating health following the sale of WCTM, Stan Corning died on December 24, 2010, at approximately 86 years old at his residence and is interred next to his wife Helen (who preceded him in death in 1989) at Sugar Grove Cemetery in West Alexandria, Ohio.

Tapes of WCTM, including its final day on the air, are known to exist in the aircheck collection of Clarke Ingram, a Pittsburgh radio executive who befriended Coning and was a fan of the station.

The WCTM callsign was later used briefly in 2011 at the former WSFO, a now defunct construction permit for an FM station at 90.7 in Barrington, New Hampshire.

Much of the classic beautiful music heard on WCTM can now be heard online (and via the TuneIn app) at https://tunein.com/radio/BEAUTIFUL-INSTRUMENTALS-s156850/

<doc id="780329" wikidata="Q3115880" url="?curid=780329" title="Kabru">
<text>Kabru is a mountain in the Himalayas on the border of eastern Nepal and India. It is part of a ridge that extends south from the third highest mountain in the world Kangchenjunga, and is the southernmost peak in the world.

The main features of this ridge are as follows (north to south):

* Kangchenjunga South top, 8476 m, at 
* A 6600–6700 m saddle, located at 
* A 7349 m summit, known as Talung, at 
* A 6983 m saddle, at 
* A 7412 m summit, at . This point has sufficient prominence to be classified as the highest point of a separate mountain, according to the definition used in List of highest mountains. It is confusingly referred to by some authorities as &quot;Kabru IV&quot;, but it is not clear that this is correct, or that any &quot;Kabru&quot; name is correctly applied to this summit.
* A substantial &quot;field of firn&quot; measuring about 2 km from north to south, and 1 km from east to west. This is almost entirely over 7200 m, and the watershed divide that runs through this field does not drop below this height.
* A 7338 m summit, at ca. , at the eastern boundary of the field of firn. This point is known as Kabru North. Although it is lower than the 7412 m summit, it has been at times considered to be Kabru&#x27;s highest point, with the higher summit considered to be an unnamed summit along the ridge to Kangchenjunga.
* An intervening c.7200 m saddle
* A 7318 m summit, at , known as Kabru South is the southernmost &quot;7000 m peak&quot; in the world.
To the south west of Kabru south, there is a 6400 m saddle and a 6682 m summit known as Rathong. To its south east is the 6600 m Kabru Dome.

==Mountaineering==

The 7338 m summit of Kabru is the site of a mountaineering altitude record, either in 1883 or in 1905. The English barrister William Graham, the Swiss hotelier Emil Boss and the Swiss mountain guide Ulrich Kaufmann reported to have reached a point 30-40 feet below this summit, which Graham described as &quot;little more than a pillar of ice&quot;, at 2pm on October 8, 1883. The ascent was questioned by powerful members of the Alpine Club and the Indian Survey Department, though not by their Himalayan climbing colleagues, and has been dismissed for most of the time since. Recent analysis suggests that the mountaineers may have been correct in their assertions after all. If Graham, Boss and Kaufmann did climb to ~7325 m on Kabru it was a remarkable achievement for its time, breaking the existing altitude record by at least 360 m (assuming a pre-Columbian ascent of Aconcagua) and holding on to it for twenty-six years (when in 1909 an expedition led by Luigi Amedeo, Duke of the Abruzzi reached about 7500 m on Chogolisa).

The same peak nevertheless became the site of an undisputed altitude record on 20 October 1907, when the Norwegians Carl W. Rubenson and Monrad Aas came within 50 m of climbing it. Notably, Rubenson and Aas believed that Kauffmann, Boss and Graham had reached the same point 24 years before.

The summit of this peak, Kabru North, was first reached by C. R. Cooke on 18 November 1935, without oxygen, after his Swiss companion Gustav Schoberth succumbed to altitude sickness at their highest camp. It remained the highest solo climb until 1953.

Talung (7349) was first climbed on May 18, 1964, by Franz Lindner and Tensing Nindra of a German expedition via the West Flank and South Col. Their original plan to climb the high point of Kabru (p.7412) from the 6983 m col had to be abandoned.

On May 10, 1994, 12 members of a large Indian Army expedition led by Major A. Abbey reached the summit of Kabru North (p. 7338). Four more climbers would reach this summit on May 13. From the saddle in between, a total of 27 soldiers made the first ascent of Kabru South (p. 7318) on May 12 and 13. This expedition also accomplished a first ascent of the highest summit of Kabru (p. 7412), which they called Kabru III and at that time was estimated to be 7395 m high. Three members led by Naib Subedar Dan Singh reached the peak on May 12, while a group of four led by Naib Subedar Devi Singh, climbed it on May 13, completing their ascent of all three summits.

In 2004, a group of Serbian climbers unsuccessfully attempted to climb the west face of Kabru South. A series of avalanches forced the group to give up their goal. 

The north-northwest pillar of Talung was first climbed in 2015 by two Ukrainian climbers, Mikhail Fomin and Nikita Balabanov, who won the Piolets d&#x27;Or for their climb. It was the fifth ascent of Talung.

<doc id="780330" wikidata="Q444406" url="?curid=780330" title="Sitting Ducks (lithograph)">
<text>Sitting Ducks is a lithograph created by the Canadian poster artist Michael Bedard in 1977. It depicts a literal interpretation of the idiom &quot;sitting duck&quot;. Three ducks are relaxing in the sun on white chairs by the poolside, one looks up and notices two bullet holes in the wall.

Bedard then went on to create an entire series of &quot;Sitting Ducks&quot; related lithographs, which culminated in a children&#x27;s book, a cartoon series and a video game.

==Book==
Bedard&#x27;s 1998 picture book &quot;Sitting Ducks&quot; () has the plot that alligators hatch ducks in a &quot;duck factory&quot;, then send them to Ducktown, where the ducks live an idyllic life, encouraged by billboards to fatten up. The alligators presumably eat the ducks once they are fat. One duck is befriended by an alligator, who lets him know that if only the Ducktown residents would not get fat, they could fly away and avoid being eaten.

The book won the 1998 California Book Award in the 10 &amp; under category.

==Cartoon==

In 2001 &quot;Sitting Ducks&quot; was produced by Universal Television. It ran for two seasons on Cartoon Network and during that time spawned merchandise such as toys, clothing, books, as well as a video game.

The show takes place in a town called Ducktown and focuses on a duck named Bill, and his best friend Aldo, a huge alligator from the neighboring town of Swampwood. Seeing as how ducks are favorite snacks of the alligators there, Bill and Aldo&#x27;s friendship is rather unusual. The pair usually end up in various situations and adventures.

The show lasted 2 seasons, airing 26 episodes.

<text>Mjølnir is a meteorite crater on the floor of Barents Sea off the coast of Norway. It is in diameter and the age is estimated to be 142.0 ± 2.6 million years (Early Cretaceous). The bolide was an estimated wide.

== Etymology ==
&quot;Mjølnir&quot; is the name of Thor&#x27;s mythological hammer. Giving the crater this name was presumably an allusion to the power of the weapon, which is often described as breaking and smashing rocks.

== Description ==
In 2006, a group of Swedish geologists discovered indications of a tsunami flooding the Swedish southern coast at about 145 million years ago. It is speculated to be associated with the Mjølnir impact, together with similar indications discovered in 2000 in France.

<text>Christoph Scheiner (25 July 1573 (or 1575) – 18 June 1650) was a Jesuit priest, physicist and astronomer in Ingolstadt.

==Biography==
===Augsburg/Dillingen: 1591–1605===
Scheiner was born in Markt Wald near Mindelheim in Swabia, earlier margravate Burgau, possession of the House of Habsburg. He attended the Jesuit St. Salvator Grammar School in Augsburg from May 1591 until 24 October 1595. He graduated as a &quot;rhetor&quot; and entered the Jesuit Order in Landsberg am Lech on 26 October 1595. At the local seminary, he served his biennial novitiate (1595–1597) under the tutelage of Novice Master Father Rupert Reindl SJ. From 1597 to 1598, he finished his lower studies of rhetoric in Augsburg. He took his first vows before Father Melchior Stör, SJ and received the minor orders from the Augsburg suffragan bishop Sebastian Breuning. He spent the years 1598–1601 in Ingolstadt studying philosophy (metaphysics and mathematics). In 1603, Scheiner invented the pantograph, an instrument which could duplicate plans and drawings to an adjustable scale. From 1603 to 1605 he taught humanities: his years as a Latin teacher at the Jesuit grammar school in Dillingen earned him the title of &quot;Magister Artium&quot;.

===Ingolstadt: 1605–1617===
From the autumn of 1605 until 1609, Scheiner studied theology in Ingolstadt. Due to his invention of the pantograph, he had already gained celebrity status. Duke William V of Bavaria even invited him to Munich to demonstrate the instrument.

On 14 March 1609, he entered Holy Orders as a Deacon. He was ordained by suffragan bishop Marcus Lyresius. Scheiner finished his studies on 30 June 1609 with his first work, &quot;Theses Theologicae&quot; and with a disputation (PhD in theology). On 18 April 1609, he received his major orders from suffragan bishop Lyresius in Eichstätt, from where he went to Ebersberg to serve his tertianship with Father Johannes Pelecius S.J. In the years between 1610 and 1616/1617, Scheiner worked as a successor to Father Johannes Lantz S.J. in Ingolstadt, teaching mathematics (physics and astronomy) and Hebrew. He lectured on sun dials, practical geometry, astronomy, optics, and the telescope.

In 1611, Scheiner observed sunspots; in 1612 he published the &quot;Apelles letters&quot; in Augsburg. Mark Welser had the first three &quot;Apelles letters&quot; printed in Augsburg on 5 January 1612. They provided one of many reasons for the subsequent unpleasant argument between Scheiner and Galileo Galilei, which began when Galileo responded to the Apelles letters with his own &quot;Letters on Sunspots&quot;. Scheiner published in 1614 the &quot;Disquisitiones mathematicae&quot; in Ingolstadt with Johann Georg Locher, in 1615 &quot;Sol ellipticus&quot; in Augsburg and with Georg Schönberger &quot;Exegeses fundamentorum gnomonicorum&quot; in Ingolstadt, and in 1617 he published &quot;Refractiones coelestes&quot;, also in Ingolstadt. Scheiner took his remaining vows of poverty, chastity, obedience and loyalty before the Pope on 31 July 1617 in the town of Ingolstadt under Father Johannes Manhart S.J. In the very same year Scheiner made known his wish to go to China as a missionary. Father General Mutio Vitelleschi sent him a letter, however, telling Scheiner he had better stay in Europe and persevere with his mathematical studies. In the winter of 1617/1618, Scheiner returned to Innsbruck, Austria at the behest of Archduke Maximilian III.

===Innsbruck/Freiburg/Neisse: 1617–1624===
After November 1614, Archduke Maximilian III summoned Scheiner to Innsbruck several times to discuss astronomical and mathematical questions. The Archduke had received an astronomical telescope with two convex lenses which showed objects upside down and the wrong way round. Scheiner added a third lens, thus manufacturing a terrestrial telescope which allowed Maximilian to see the beautiful stretches of his country while standing upright. A portable camera obscura was developed by Scheiner in Innsbruck. Furthermore, a walkable camera obscura was constructed.

After the death of Maximilian III in 1618, Archduke Leopold V was appointed imperial representative of Tyrol and of the Upper Provinces. Like his predecessor Maximilian, Leopold V put his trust in Father Scheiner. Scheiner&#x27;s &quot;Oculus hoc est: Fundamentum opticum,&quot; containing many new insights into the physiological nature of the eye, was published in Innsbruck in 1619. The book had been written earlier in Ingolstadt. &quot;Oculus&quot; is subdivided into three parts: the first part treats the anatomy of the eye, the second part the refraction of the light ray inside the eye, and the third part deals with the retina and the visual angle. Scheiner once again chooses the way of observation and experiment. Like Kepler before him, he found that the retina is the seat of vision and that the optic nerve transmits the images from the retina to the brain. Scheiner was rebuked once more for going from Innsbruck to Hall in a heavily loaded coach drawn by six horses. Father General Vitelleschi wrote him a letter. Archduke Leopold V and Father Scheiner carried on a sizeable correspondence from 1620 until 1632. One of Scheiner&#x27;s letters to Leopold from 1626 informs the Archduke that Galilei is not to hear of Scheiner&#x27;s work concerning the sunspots.

The inventory of Leopold&#x27;s library contains works by Tycho Brahe and Galileo Galilei: Leopold lead a friendly correspondence with Galilei. On 23 May 1618, Leopold received telescopes from Galilei, along with a treatise on the sunspots, the &quot;Discorso del Flusso e Reflusso del Mare&quot;.

Scheiner was the builder of the new Jesuit church in Innsbruck. Craftsmen began to work on the roof in July 1624, but September saw a sudden collapse of the middle part of the gallery and the sidewall facing the street. According to a new decision, the church had to be turned by 90° and be reconstructed.

Freiburg University was facing a decline at the beginning of the 17th century. It was on 16 November 1620, that Archduke Leopold summoned the Jesuit Fathers, first of all, the &quot;most excellent by far&quot; Christoph Scheiner. In the spring of 1621, Scheiner was recalled for reasons confirmed to be unknown: in fact it was Archduke Karl&#x27;s wish to have Scheiner as his father confessor. Archduke Karl had travelled with Scheiner from Brixen to Vienna, from where he did not return to Neisse until sometime between 1621 and 1622. In February 1623, Scheiner was appointed Superior of the future college. Then the Spanish King Philipp IV chose Karl of Austria for the office of a vice-king of Portugal. Archduke Karl travelled to Madrid. Scheiner had to travel to Rome, to instigate the foundation of the new college in Neisse. Scheiner stayed in Rome longer than his duty required. In &quot;Rosa Ursina sive Sol&quot;, he wrote that he had been sent to Rome &quot;ad summum pontificem, ob certa peragenda negotia&quot; (Latin meaning &quot;to the pontifical summons...&quot;). Other theories, contending that Scheiner had been summoned to Rome as an expert astronomer because of Galilei, or that he felt his transfer to Neisse was a punishment, have not been confirmed. It was only 13 years later, that he returned to Neisse via Vienna, where he stayed for some time.

===Rome: 1624–1633===
When Scheiner went to Rome in 1624, friends asked him to write about his solar observations. At last he had time for mathematical books, among them Galilei’s &quot;Il saggiatore&quot;, which contains Galileo&#x27;s work on sunspots. This was similar to Scheiner&#x27;s own work (unsurprisingly, since both were observing at the same time) but led to allegations from both of plagiarism by the other, and to a deep enmity between the two scientists.
In 1629 and 1630, Scheiner observed a series of mock suns (parhelia) and haloes, including a complex display on 24 January 1630. These were described in his book &quot;Parhelia&quot;, which had a profound influence on the work of René Descartes and later on Christiaan Huygens. His observations also included an eclipse on 8 April 1633. 
On 22 June 1633, Galilei received his sentence and had to renounce his claims, despite the protest sounding even from the Aristotelian side. Scheiner&#x27;s influence on the trial cannot be proven. The trial files merely contain a small note mentioning that he had opposed the Copernicans. At the time of the trial, Scheiner was still in Rome, staying at the seminary for future priests.
Scheiner wrote three of his books in Rome: &quot;Rosa Ursina sive Sol&quot; (Bracciano, 1626–1630), on sunspots, which served as a standard work for research work on the sunspots for a long time. &quot;Rosa Ursina sive Sol&quot; contains four books. In the first part, Scheiner discusses the question of priority of discovery in regard to sunspots. The second part not only describes telescopes, different kinds of projection and the helioscope but also compares the optics of the telescope to the physiological optics of the eye. In the third book, Scheiner presents a comprehensive collection of the data from his observation of sunspots. Book 4 consists of two parts: the first part deals once again with solar phenomena like sunspots and sun flares, the sun&#x27;s rotation period of 27 days and the inclination of its axis of rotation. In the second part, Scheiner mentions numerous passages and quotations from the Bible, the writings of the Church Fathers and philosophers to prove that his geocentric view is in accordance with the teachings of the Catholic Church. 
Scheiner published &quot;Pantographice&quot;, about the pantograph which he had invented as early as 1603, and finally in 1632/1633, Scheiner published his last work &quot;Prodromus&quot;, a pamphlet against the heliocentric theory which was published posthumously in 1651.

===Vienna: 1633–1637===
Father General Mutio Vitelleschi wrote his first letter to Scheiner in Vienna on 21 January 1634. Thus Scheiner must have returned to Vienna between December 1633 and January 1634. Scheiner was unwilling to go back to Neisse. In Vienna, Scheiner was forced to confront the insecure funding for his book &quot;Rosa Ursina sive Sol&quot;.

===Neisse: 1637–1650===
After 15 November 1637, Scheiner was in Neisse in Silesia. Scheiner&#x27;s activities in Neisse: Advisor, Councilor of the Rector, Mentor and Father Confessor to the students. He died there, and his obituary from 1650 maintains that Scheiner had to stay in Vienna because of the war, that he had had to flee from Neisse with all his astronomical instruments, that he usually got up early, to write or read, take care of the garden and plant trees with his own hands. The author of this obituary mentions Scheiner&#x27;s modesty and chastity while pointing out that he was envied by many and &quot;struggled with envy himself.&quot; Christoph Scheiner died on 18 June 1650 in Neisse (now Nysa, Poland).

==Legacy==
The primary school in Markt Wald is named in memory of Christoph Scheiner. In Markt Wald, there is also a street and a plaque hangs in the town hall and an observation tower to his remembrance. In Ingolstadt, there is the Christoph-Scheiner-Gymnasium (a High School). The street to the observatory of the university in Munich and a road in Berlin (Charlottenburg) are named after Scheiner. In 1999, a coin (35-mm diameter), with Scheiner&#x27;s face on it, was minted in Ingolstadt. Also a lunar crater is named after Scheiner (diameter: 110 km [68 mi], height of embankment: 5,500 m [18,000 ft], named by Riccoli). A postage stamp was issued in Austria (2005). The town museum in Ingolstadt shows an oil painting (after 1732), also the Studienbibliothek Dillingen a fresco (painter Ignaz Schilling, 1702–1773).

<doc id="780339" wikidata="Q5989418" url="?curid=780339" title="Idolatry in Judaism">
<text>Idolatry in Judaism (Hebrew: עבודה זרה) is prohibited. Judaism holds that idolatry is not limited to the worship of an idol itself, but also worship involving any artistic representations of God. The prohibition is epitomized by the first two &quot;words&quot; of the decalogue: I am the Lord thy God, Thou shalt have no other gods before me, and Thou shalt not make unto thee any graven image or any image in the sky, on earth or in the sea. These prohibitions are re-emphasized repeatedly by the later prophets, suggesting the ongoing appeal of Canaanite religion and syncretic assimilation to the ancient Israelites.

In addition, it is forbidden to derive benefit (&quot;hana&#x27;ah&quot;) from anything dedicated to idolatry.

==Judaism&#x27;s view of idolatry==
Judaism had historically stood out from other religions in the ancient world because of its exclusive monotheism. According to Jewish theology, idolatry is the ultimate betrayal of God&#x27;s relationship with humanity. It is also the ultimate metaphysical error. Idolatry was also reckoned as &quot;avodah zarah&quot; (). Jewish identity in the ancient Greek and Roman civilisations was shaped by the rejection of idolatry. The strict avoidance of idolatry affected Jewish daily life in terms of cuisine, coinage, socialisations and participation in games. Jewish law&#x27;s strict prohibition of idolatry meant that Jewish movements through areas containing images were inhibited. By the first century CE, Jews had responded to the idolatry of non-Jews through satire and polemics. Jewish writers used the works of their own scriptures as well as the works of Greek philosophers to denounce idolatry. While Judaism has never sought to impose the faith on non-Jews, it does require the elimination of idolatry from the world. According to Maimonides, Moses was ordered to compel all the world to accept the Noahide laws and end idolatry. The question of idolatry was a sensitive one, because idolatrous actions had brought destruction in the wilderness, according to the scriptures. Maimonides argues that the Torah&#x27;s rules for ritual sacrifices are intended to help wean the Jewish People away from idolatry.

While Jews in general abhorred idolatry, some members of the Diaspora did engage in idolatrous actions. Such Jews often objectified God, visited and worshiped in pagan temples and abandoned their Jewish heritage. Some Jews differed with others on what defined an idolatrous practice. According to Artapanus and Pseudo-Aristeas some Jews were idolatrous on the cognitive level. Evidence from papyri and inscriptions also indicate that some Jews did not object to idolatry even while they clung on to their Jewish heritage.

The Mishnah and Talmud have defined idolatry. It includes worshiping an idol in the manner of its worshipers. This is called &quot;customary worship&quot;. Another criterion is worshiping the idol with acts which are for worshiping God in the Temple. These include animal sacrifice, incense burning and sprinkling blood. Performing one of these acts means the performer is dubbed an idolater. The third criterion of idolatry is prostration. This includes bowing down with at least the head or knees on the ground. Acts such as kissing, embracing and honoring are forbidden but are not considered to come under idolatry. The performer of such an act does not receive capital punishment unlike the idolater in Jewish law. Tractate &quot;Avodah Zarah&quot; of the Talmud governs Jewish interactions with idolaters. It places certain restrictions on business dealings with idolaters for the days in proximity to idolatrous festivals. It was forbidden to provide or take any benefit from idolatrous actions. These regulations had a strong impact on Jewish business dealings with Christians during the Middle Ages. Since Jews regarded Christians as idolaters because of Christian theological doctrines such as the Trinity, alongside the Christian usage of statues and icons, Jews would not do business dealings with Christians on Sundays. Business dealings with Muslims were not affected because Jews regarded the Muslims as pure monotheists like themselves.

==Evolution away from idolatry in the Israelite religion==
Judaism historically stood out from other faiths in the Iron Age world because of its strict monotheism. However, there is evidence indicating that before and probably during the early first millennium BCE, polytheism was ubiquitous in Yahwism. (The religion that exalted Yahweh and would later become known as Judaism or &quot;Yahadut&quot;, after one of the tribes of Israel – יהודה, &quot;Yehudah&quot;) To the early authors of the Tanakh, idolatry (אליל, &quot;elil)&quot; likely had different connotations than it has now, because they existed while the religion was still evolving into a monotheistic faith. For this reason, idolatry and its consequences are described differently between the various books of the Hebrew Bible, largely varying by the era in which they were written. For example, in the Book of Exodus, (which is believed to have been transcribed between the 6th and 5th centuries BCE from a more ancient oral tradition) idolatry is condemned not necessarily as a futile exercise in supplicating to nonexistent gods, but because it provokes the anger of God, who describes himself as jealous in the Ten Commandments. Within the quote typically translated as &quot;you shall have no other gods &quot;before&quot; me,&quot; the preposition is often translated as &quot;before,&quot; but its original Hebrew/Aramaic meaning is closer to &quot;upon,&quot; &quot;over,&quot; or &quot;above,&quot; which in this context may refer to rank. This suggests that its original intent may have been to establish the primacy of Yahweh among the gods and his role as the primary patron of the Israelites, rather than to declare Yahweh&#x27;s status as the &quot;only&quot; authentic deity.

Later authors characterized idolatry in very different terms: the Book of Isaiah is believed to have been composed and revised by different authors in different periods, with chapters 1–39 being composed by the historical prophet Isaiah in the 8th century BCE, chapters 40–55 attributed to &quot;Deutero-Isaiah,&quot; an anonymous author writing during the Babylonian captivity of the 6th century BCE, and chapters 56–66 attributed to &quot;Trito-Isaiah,&quot; writing after the return from exile. Isaiah 44:6 contains the first unambiguous statement of monotheism, &quot;I am the first and I am the last; beside me there is no God.&quot; Isaiah 44:9–10 also contain the first clear declarations of the futility of idolatry and, accordingly, the nonexistence of the other Canaanite gods: &quot;All who fashion idols are nothing, and the things they delight in &quot;do not profit&quot;.&quot; and &quot;Who fashions a god or casts an idol that is profitable for nothing?&quot; As Yahwism competed with the other cults of Canaan and became more focused on Yahweh in particular, and eventually to the exclusion of the older Canaanite gods, its conception of idolatry changed as well, paving the way for monotheism.

The people eventually known as Israelites emerged during the second millennium BCE as a distinct subculture of the Canaanite civilization, whose language was ancestral to Hebrew, and whose religion incorporated a pantheon of numerous deities. This civilization was synonymous with the later Phoenicians, who built cities in modern-day Israel and Lebanon, went on to colonize the coast of the Maghreb, and founded a thalassocratic empire ruled from Carthage. The ancient Yahwists are believed to have practiced a form of henotheism, in which Yahweh (identified with ʼĒl) was supreme, but other Canaanite deities could still be worshipped as secondary gods. Canaan had a number of deities, but Yahweh does not seem to have been among the earliest gods worshipped in Canaan. The theory for Yahweh&#x27;s origin with the most scholarly recognition is that nomads from the southeast of Canaan, called Kenites or Midianites in the Tanakh, brought Yahweh to the southern reaches of Canaan, where they mingled with the Canaanite tribes that would become the Israelites. This is supported by an Egyptian inscription from the 13th century BCE with the phrase &quot;land of Shasu of yhw,&quot; representing the earliest known use of the name YHWH, and identifying YHWH as the god of the region associated with Edom. This would help to explain the lack of reference to Yahweh in the pre-Iron Age archaeological record of mainstream Canaanite sites, which are primarily found on the coast of what is now Lebanon and northern Israel (e.g., Byblos, Baalbek). In this view, the Yahweh worship of the Israelites began as a result of cultural exchange or syncretic fusion between two distinct polytheistic cultures.

ʼĒl is believed to have been the central and ruling divinity of the ancient Canaanite pantheon, as its creator deity. It is from the name of this particular Canaanite deity (אֵל) that the general Hebrew term for God evolved – אֱלֹ, pronounced &quot;el.&quot; Because the proper personal name &quot;YHWH&quot; (called the Tetragrammaton in its written form) was considered too holy to speak aloud, titles like &quot;Adonai&quot; or &quot;Elohim&quot;, which was originally a general term for any deity descended from ʼĒl, were used instead. Additionally, this is where many names and phrases in the Hebrew Bible come from, including Ezekiel (&quot;God will strengthen&quot;), Samuel (&quot;God heard&quot;), and Israel (&quot;who struggles with God&quot;). During the very early stages of Yahwism, it is believed that Yahweh and ʼĒl were considered to be separate deities, (with ʼĒl possibly being considered the father of all other Canaanite deities) and that the general meaning of Elohim was lost as it became a title associated with Yahweh in particular. The Canaanites worshipped ʼĒl as their supreme deity, while at some point the Hebrews branched off and began prioritizing Yahweh.

The Canaanites also worshipped deities mentioned in the Hebrew Bible (though often erroneously translated as general terms rather than the names of deities) and in contemporaneous apocryphal texts, such as Dagon, (whose temple Samson destroyed, according to the Book of Judges) Ba&#x27;al/Hadad, Moloch, and Asherah. Asherah was worshipped by numerous cultures in the ancient Near East, including Canaan, Ugarit, the Hittite Empire, Amurru, Akkad, and ancient Arabia; in each of these religions, her role was the queen consort of a central deity, if not the supreme deity. There is evidence that statues of Asherah were kept in early Yahwist temples, and there are some indications that the temple in Jerusalem was intended to be the &quot;sole&quot; temple to Yahweh, with other temples originally having been dedicated to other deities. The early Canaanites considered Asherah to be the wife or consort of ʼĒl, but as the ancient Israelites&#x27; religion evolved, she became the wife of Yahweh, or alternatively (according to other ancient sources) his mother. This is believed to have been a consequence of an ongoing trend of religious syncretism within Yahwism—Yahweh became conflated with ʼĒl, taking on all of his qualities, including his marriage to Asherah. Yahweh first supplanted ʼĒl as supreme deity, and later merged with him.

This trend of syncretic assimilation is theorized by Mark S. Smith to have continued for many generations, with Ba&#x27;al and Asherah eventually merging with Yahweh as well, and their qualities and stories being ascribed to Yahweh instead, such as Ba&#x27;al&#x27;s identification as a storm god. He also proposes that beginning after the 9th century BCE, Yahweh (having already assimilated several ancient Canaanite deities) began to develop some idiosyncratic qualities, as a result of having been conflated with some Canaanite gods, while simultaneously being distinguished from and described in opposition to other remnants of the Canaanite faith. Some of the earliest injunctions and admonitions in the Hebrew Bible are commandments to abstain from certain ancient Canaanite practices, such as worship of Ba&#x27;al and Asherah, child sacrifice as associated with Moloch and Ba&#x27;al, worship of the sun and moon, and cults of &quot;high places.&quot; This has been argued to mark the transition from monolatry to monotheism, since this is when the idea of &quot;idolatry&quot; began to emerge and encompass all forms of Canaanite worship except those associated with Yahweh.

The ancient Canaanite religion was still popular in the region, and coexisted with Yahwism and the early form of Judaism that evolved from it. However, the ancient Israelites eventually began to see the Canaanites as adherents of an entirely separate and idolatrous faith and compete with them. The oldest books of the Hebrew Bible reflect this competition, as in the Book of Hosea and in the Book of Nahum, whose authors lament the &quot;apostasy&quot; of the people of Israel and threaten them with the wrath of God if they do not give up their polytheistic cults. The transition from monolatry to monotheism and the concept of idolatry can be summarized as the following: 1) Ancient Canaanites worshipped a large variety of gods, though probably not including Yahweh; 2) Canaanites in the lands that would later be known as Israel, Samaria, and Judah began worshipping Yahweh; 3) The early Israelites prioritized Yahweh worship, treating other gods as secondary; 4) The Israelites gradually merged other deities into Yahweh, associating their traits and stories with him; 5) The deities that had previously been merged with Yahweh, and some vestigial traditions and rituals associated with their worship, were eventually seen as superstitions or elements of distinct, separate religions; 6) The authors of the most ancient books of the Hebrew Bible argued that Yahweh is the only god that Israelites &quot;should&quot; worship, and that all other worship angers Yahweh, but did not overtly deny the existence of the other Canaanite deities; 7) It&#x27;s possible that at some point after the Babylonian captivity, the history and memory of Canaanite gods being worshipped alongside Yahweh in mainstream Yahwistic temples were forgotten; 8) Later Tanakh authors (beginning with the Deutero-Isaiah authors) used the term &quot;avodh zereh&quot; (עֲבוֹדה זֶרֶה) meaning &quot;foreign worship&quot; and argued that &quot;fashioning a god or idol&quot; was foolish and futile, as Yahweh is the only god that truly exists. The other forms of worship described in the more ancient books were deemed merely ancient superstitions or misguided foreign religions. Idolaters were no longer making Yahweh jealous by making offerings to foreign gods—rather, they were making offerings to imaginary gods that had no power to reward them with any kind of benefit. This rejection of the &quot;existence&quot; of foreign gods can be seen as marking the completion of Yahwism&#x27;s transition into Second Temple Judaism.

<text>Freilassing (), until 1923 Salzburghofen is a town of some 16,000 inhabitants in the southeastern corner of Bavaria, Germany. It belongs to the &quot;Regierungsbezirk&quot; Oberbayern and the &quot;Landkreis&quot; (County) of Berchtesgadener Land. 
Located very close to the German-Austrian border, Freilassing can be seen as the biggest satellite of Salzburg, the centre of which is eight kilometres (five miles) away, on the other side of the border.

==History==
As proved by excavations the area was already settled in the Neolithic times. Celts and later Romans established permanent settlements. First mentioned 885 in a Carolingian document, the peasant village named Salzburghofen was given to the archbishop of Salzburg by king Louis IV in 908. After the Napoleonic Wars in 1816, the border between Bavaria and Austria was drawn along the rivers Saalach and Salzach, and Salzburghofen became part of Bavaria. The railway line connecting Munich and Salzburg (and further on to Vienna) changed the appearance of the village significantly. First, the railway company paid good prices for the land of the farmers. Second, many jobs were created, more than 1,000 in the 1970s.

In 1923, the name of the village was changed to Freilassing. Since the railway was of strategic interest and was also used by top Nazis on their way to Berchtesgaden during the war, Freilassing became a target for the Allied forces. In addition, a depot of the Wehrmacht (the German army) was situated close to the station. On April 25, 1945, only a few days before the end of World War II, British and American bombers destroyed Freilassing almost completely.

Due to the expulsion of many Germans out of the eastern territories, the population of Freilassing grew and reached 7,700 in 1952. Thus Freilassing became &quot;Stadt&quot; (city) in 1954. Since then, the population has doubled.

==Geography==
Freilassing is located in the valley of the rivers Salzach and Saalach which merge close to the northern part of the town. To the south and the east the Alps arise to altitudes of more than 2,000 m. To the north and west rolling hills dominate the landscape.

==Economy==
Cattle farming and timber industry were major economic branches before the railroad era.
The railway has dominated the economy for a long time since the construction of the Munich–Salzburg line in 1860. Beginning in the mid-1970s, the DB (German railways) gradually centralized their organization. Hence the importance of the railway as an employer diminished. Several small and midsize companies, especially in mechanical engineering provide jobs.

==Transportation==
Trains stop at Freilassing Station.

== Born in Freilassing ==

* Florian Grassl (born 1980), skeleton pilot
* (1900-1982), aviation engineer and university professor
* Hans Schaidinger (born 1949), former mayor of Regensburg
* Katharina Trost, athlete

<doc id="780343" wikidata="Q1751642" url="?curid=780343" title="Morasko Meteorite Nature Reserve">
<text>The Morasko meteorite nature reserve () is located in Morasko, on the northern edge of the city of Poznań, Poland. It contains seven meteor craters. The reserve has an area of 55 hectares (136 acres) and was established in 1976.

== Natural environment ==

The land of the reserve is covered by a forest of oak and hornbeam trees, among which grow a number of uncommon plant species, including

* Martagon or Turk&#x27;s cap lily (&quot;Lilium martagon&quot;)
* Wild ginger (&quot;Asarum europaeum&quot;)
* Tropical hornwort (&quot;Ceratophyllum submersum&quot;)

Some uncommon birds can also be found here, including

* The European nightjar (&quot;Caprimulgus europaeus&quot;)
* The black woodpecker (&quot;Dryocopus martius&quot;)

== Impact craters ==

The largest of the seven craters on the reserve has a diameter of about 100 metres, and is about 11 metres deep. Five of the craters, including the largest, contain lakes. The date of formation is estimated to be about 5,000 years ago (Holocene).

The first meteorite found at Morasko was uncovered in 1914 by German soldiers working on the construction of a military fortification. Since then, many further fragments have been found, including one weighing 78 kg in 1956.

In September 2006, Krzysztof Socha, a meteorite-hunter from Kielce, working for the Geology department of the city&#x27;s Adam Mickiewicz University, uncovered with the aid of a metal detector a meteorite weighing 164 kg. At the time this was the largest meteorite discovered in Poland. Analysis showed that the meteorite contained, apart from iron-nickel alloy, a small quantity of silicates (pyroxenes) not occurring on Earth.

In October 2012, a meteorite weighing about 300 kg was recovered from a depth of 2.1 m.

Adam Mickiewicz University is considering founding an educational centre, to draw attention to the reserve and the subject of meteorite discovery. 

== Points of note ==

* The reserve contains the 154-metre-high Mount Moraska, the highest point in Poznań.
* The local bus lines 88 and 188 have stops a short distance from the reserve.

<text>Napoleon was a river port and the county seat of Desha County, Arkansas, from 1838 to 1874. It was located at the confluence of the Arkansas and the Mississippi rivers. Napoleon was badly damaged during the Civil War and then finally abandoned after most of it had washed into the Mississippi River.

==History==
===Founding===
Napoleon was founded at the confluence of the Arkansas and Mississippi River, on the West bank of the Arkansas&#x27;s mouth, by &quot;Fredrick Notrebe&quot; who named the town in honor of &quot;his old commander&quot;. The area was one of the most common thoroughfares that existed along the Mississippi but was sure to meet hardship due to the unwieldy Arkansas and Mississippi which would commonly flood and change course. The exact date of Napoleon&#x27;s founding is not certain. A Post office was established in 1832. A primary school was founded on December 10, 1838. Bishop Joseph Rosati of St. Louis sent Father Peter Donnelly to establish a Catholic church in Arkansas where he purchased land and held the first mass there in May 1839.
The leaders of Napoleon were ambitious, not only did they create a town with a large wharf, they lobbied to be the location of one of the Federal Marine Hospitals and aspired to build a railroad linking Napoleon to the Pacific Ocean. Despite such aspiration the town quick established a sour reputation for filth, bugs and crime. U.S. Supreme Court Justice Peter Vivian Daniel wrote to his daughter about his visit to Napoleon in 1851 calling it a &quot;miserable place [that] consists of a few slightly build wood houses, hastily erected no doubt under some scheme of speculations, and which are tumbling down without ever having been finished…&quot;

In 1852, Bolivar County established Wellington, Mississippi, as its county seat, nearly opposite Napoleon, on the east bank of the Mississippi River. There would have been a natural rivalry between business and civic leaders in Desha County, Arkansas, and Bolivar County for river-related commerce at the confluence of the Arkansas and Mississippi rivers. From 1850 to 1860 the town had nearly doubled in population. Other nearby townships were recorded as using Napoleon&#x27;s post office and the Marine Hospital had become the primary fixture of the town. While the population grew, floods levees were highly discussed but rarely constructed. Such levees were common work at other towns such as New Orleans and Baton Rouge but above the river at Napoleon an army report mentioned, &quot;few or none had yet been attempted.&quot; Still the promise of levees had at least secured the building of the Marine Hospital.

===Marine Hospital===

In 1837 Congress authorized the building of seven Marine Hospitals. Napoleon was one of the locations chosen by Congress on August 29, 1842. Major Stephen Long of the U.S. Topographical Engineers was instructed to build the first hospital at Louisville, Kentucky. Long was commissioned to build the Marine Hospital at Napoleon in 1849. Long noticed the flooding problems right away in Napoleon writing, &quot;I cannot but regard the site selected for this hospital objectionable.&quot; He had petitioned for the high bluffs at Helena, Arkansas to be the location for the hospital for that area. His objections to the location were ignored. Senator Solon Borland wrote to the Corps of Topographical Engineers that the situation at Napoleon had been discussed before the bill was passed that would create the Marine Hospital at Napoleon. The hospital at Napoleon ordered to begin without delay. 

In the Spring of 1850 Long requested $10,250 in order to begin construction but it wasn&#x27;t until August that construction finally started thanks to flooding which had hampered the work on the foundation and cellar. Delays continued to dog the construction and by the Spring of 1851 the supervisor wrote Long suggesting suspension of the work as contracts were expiring due to delays and sickness had been rampant. Work resumed in October 1851 and the slow pace continued over the next three years. By August 1854 the hospital was finally finished but the hospital did not accept its first patients until 1855.

Long&#x27;s observations and objections had been accurate. By March 11, 1868, the river had eroded the land to 52 feet from the hospital&#x27;s doors. Less than a month later, and nearly four years after Long&#x27;s death, a corner of the hospital fell into the River. The Weekly Arkansas Gazette of May 19, 1868, wrote: &quot;We learn from Mr. Boyd, who has just returned from Napoleon, that the U. S. Marine Hospital at that place has about one half broken off and caved into the river.&quot; As the hospital gradually fell into the water, its custodian tried to sell what he could rescue from it.

The entire town of Napoleon would be swallowed by the river only twenty-five years after Long first objected to building the hospital at Napoleon.

===American Civil War===

On February 12, 1861, before Arkansas seceded from the Union in May, Gov. Henry Rector ordered the seizure of the Marine Hospital and ammunition shipments. In April 1861 secessionists set up two cannons at Napoleon with the intention of forcing riverboats to stop for inspection.

By September 1862 the Union army occupied Napoleon and the Union Navy controlled the rivers. While the city was under Federal control, the once bustling port had all but been deserted. The economy was in ruins, slavery was coming to a sudden end, and river traffic was entirely Union controlled. During the winter of 1863 the town had been largely pillaged for firewood. The Catholic church had its pews ripped apart and the only structure still standing was the Marine Hospital, which Federal forces did not use the for its intended purpose, instead sending patients elsewhere. While the hospital would survive the war it wouldn&#x27;t survive the river.

Even after the Confederates were routed at the Battle of Saint Charles in June 1862 and the Battle of Fort Hindman in January 1863 (at Arkansas Post where the Union advance landed at the Notrebe plantation), the Union forces could not stop rebels from harassing union ships. Following one such ambush in 1863, a Federal gunship led by William Tecumseh Sherman landed at Wellington and burned it.

==Geography==
The river that allowed the prosperity of Napoleon, Arkansas began its demise on April 14, 1863. Union Commander Thomas Oliver Selfridge who lead the USS Conestonga on patrols around the area of Napoleon had grown furious as to the inability to stop the rebels from firing at Union ships using the Beulah Bend. Selfridge&#x27;s boss David Porter, called the bend, &quot;one of the worst points for guerrillas.&quot;
East of Napoleon, The Beulah Bend (now Lake Beulah) was a 10-mile arc of the Mississippi River that started at the mouth of the Arkansas and semi-circled back around to within a mile of the Arkansas river&#x27;s mouth. During the American Civil War, Confederate soldiers would move east by foot from Napoleon, hide in a wooded area near the bend, and then fire on passing Union ships. The bend was so tight that Rebels could fire at a ships headed down stream the Mississippi and leisurely move cannons a few hundred yards to wait and fire at the same ships.

Selfridge sought to dig a canal that would reroute the river from the Beulah bend. He obtained the idea when he noticed the floodwaters near Beulah Bend made the distance feasible. The tactic (Grant&#x27;s Canal) had failed miserably at the Siege of Vicksburg but Selfridge put his men to work on digging a canal only a few hundred yards long. It didn&#x27;t take long. In just a single day the water had made a raging torrent cut into the earth and carried even large trees. The next morning Selfridge couldn&#x27;t wait. He opened up the new canal at full speed in the Conestonga, estimating the current to be at 12 knots and surprised transport ship that had seen them behind them the day prior.

Admiral Porter was impressed. He wrote the Secretary of the Navy, Gideon Welles on April 16, 1863, saying, &quot;I have the honor to enclose a letter from Lieutenant-Commander Thomas O. Selfridge, which is interesting from the fact that it shows how easily cut-offs are made in the Mississippi when conducted with ordinary intelligence. I send a diagram which will explain the operation. We have been threatened for some time past with an attack from the Arkansas rebels in steamers. Every provision was made to meet it. Lieutenant-Commander Selfridge saw the difficulty in defending the mouths of White and Arkansas rivers while kept so far apart by a useless neck of land and proposed to me to cut it. I ordered him to do so, and he passed through with his vessel twenty- four hours after he cut the bend, this saving a distance of over 10 miles. The mouths of Arkansas and White River are now brought close together, and a small force can defend both. One of the worst points for guerrillas is also cut off, as these pests of the human race could, from the isthmus, attack a vessel on one side and be ready to meet her on the other as she came around; the distance being 10 miles around and half a mile across.&quot;

==Abandonment and destruction==

Though the cut had improved river traffic, the cut hastened the end of Napoleon. The Mississippi&#x27;s water was soon eroding the banks of the town. Ten years after the canal was dug the town would be gone. Napoleon after the war was practically a ghost town.

Although several families returned, most didn&#x27;t. A Newspaper in Napoleon (The Napoleon News) came back and 1870 and claimed that silver had been discovered near the town.

Many were hopeful for the town to return to prosperity but Napoleon would not become the host of a silver boom nor much else. Floods continued. The Mississippi cut into the town separating one side from the other. Thieves were creative and used a flat boat to steal the safe from the county clerk&#x27;s office. While the safe had no money, it contained town records.

The Catholic Church bell is now at McGehee. All that is left of Napoleon are a few ruins which are only visible when the water is low.

==&quot;Fredrick Notrebe&quot;==
&quot;Fredrick Notrebe&quot;, a former French soldier immigrated to Arkansas Post in the summer of 1810. Notrebe was born in France in 1780. He came to Arkansas Post as an agent for William Drope of New Orleans. The first deed of ownership shows Notrebe purchased a house and lot in the town of Arkansas in 1811. The same year, Notrebe married &quot;Mary Felicite Bellette&quot;, daughter of John B. Bellette (aka Eusdine or Eusine). Notrebe had five children with Mary. Only one son would carry on the Notrebe name, Eugene Notrebe&#x27;s (Eugene born in 1816) illegitimate son was named &quot;Napoleon Bonaparte Notrebe&quot;. Napoleon would survive his father&#x27;s death in Havana, Cuba 1840.

Notrebe was often referred to as Colonel. While not much is certain about Notrebe&#x27;s military service in France, his close friend &quot;Antoine Barraqué&quot; who immigrated to Arkansas Post in 1816 had fought under Napoleon Bonaparte at the Battle of Marengo, Battle of Austerlitz, Battle of Jena–Auerstedt, Battle of Lodi, and Battle of Borodino. For Notrebe the title of Colonel was likely more an honorary one. Prior to the establishment of Territory of Arkansas in 1819 the area was connected to the Missouri Militia. Notrebe would have been a part of the militia during that time due to the law. It is unknown if he fought in the War of 1812. An 1825 roster Militia Officers excludes Notrebe&#x27;s name. Local politics seemed to be natural for the Colonel and on November 1, 1820, he was the &quot;Common Pleas Judge&quot; for the township of Arkansas.

Notrebe built a trading house and store at Arkansas Post. Initially, Notrebe had traded furs and pelts with the local, friendly, Quapaw tribe. Notrebe eventually bought enough land to start a plantation with the where in 1819 he began trading cotton. The local economy soon followed the shifted from trading furs to cotton. With the invention of the cotton gin, Notrebe built a gin at Arkansas Post in 1827 (the foundation of which is still visible today) and shifted entirely to an agricultural economic focus. A traveler would remark that Frederick Notrebe had a few modern building adorning the banks of the River in 1832, a sign of prosperity. By 1836 Notrebe&#x27;s estate included 14 parcels of land totally 3,496 acres. Notrebe&#x27;s son-in-law, William Cummins, partnered with Notrebe and had another 4,633 acres. With 71 slaves working the plantations, his prominence in the area was as G. W. Featherstonhaugh put it, &quot;the great man of the place [Arkansas Post] is Monsieur Notrebe who is said to have accumulated a considerable fortune here.&quot;

Notrebe would die while on business in New Orleans on April 13, 1849.

==In popular culture==
The town was the subject of a chapter in Mark Twain&#x27;s &quot;Life on the Mississippi&quot;, in which he tells a story of learning from a deathbed confession that $10,000 was hidden behind a brick in a building in Napoleon. When Twain tried to retrieve it, he discovered the entire town had been washed away. Twain reports that the early explorers De Soto, Marquette and Joliet, and La Salle visited &quot;the site of the future town of Napoleon, Arkansas&quot; in their pioneering journeys.

<text>The Morokweng impact structure is an impact structure buried beneath the Kalahari Desert near the town of Morokweng in South Africa&#x27;s North West province, close to the border with Botswana.

== Description ==

Estimates of the diameter of the structure vary widely with some studies suggesting a smaller size of in diameter while others suggests a much larger size of around or more. Its age is estimated to be 146.06 ± 0.16 million years, placing it within the Tithonian stage of the Late Jurassic, several million years before the Jurassic–Cretaceous boundary. Discovered in 1994, it is not exposed at the surface, but has been mapped by magnetic and gravimetric surveys. Core samples have shown it to have been formed by the impact of an L chondrite asteroid estimated to have been in diameter.

In May, 2006, a group of scientists drilling into the site announced the discovery of a -diameter fragment of the original asteroid at a depth of below the surface, along with several much smaller pieces a few millimetres across at other depths. This discovery was unexpected, since previous drillings on large impact structures had not produced such fragments, and it was thought that the asteroid had been almost entirely vaporised. Some of the fragments can be seen in the Antenna Wing of London&#x27;s Science Museum.

<text>Mount Toondina crater is an impact structure (or astrobleme), the eroded remnant of a former impact crater, located in northern South Australia in the locality of Allandale Station about south of the town of Oodnadatta. Mount Toondina is the high point of a circular topographic feature rising out of an otherwise relatively flat desert area of the Eromanga Basin. An impact origin was first suggested in 1976, challenging the earlier diapir (salt dome) hypothesis, and strongly supported by subsequent studies. A geophysical survey using gravity methods indicates an internal structure typical of complex impact craters, including an uplifted centre, and suggests that the original crater was about 3–4 km in diameter. The crater must be younger than the Early Cretaceous age of the rocks in which it is situated, but otherwise is not well dated. It has clearly undergone significant erosion since the impact event.

<text>Neugrund is a meteorite crater in Estonia. It is in diameter and was previously estimated to have been formed in the Ordovician around 470 Ma, with later research revealing a possible Cambrian origin (around 535 Ma). The crater is at the bottom of the sea and is not exposed at the surface. Boulders of gneissic breccia found on the coast of Osmussaar, a nearby island, are believed to have been thrown there by the explosion.
It has been proposed that the Neugrund crater was created during the Ordovician meteor event when a hypothetical large asteroid transferred directly into a resonant orbit with Jupiter, which shifted its orbit to intercept Earth.

This attractive theory may need to be changed as more recent study puts the age of the impact in the Cambrian.

<doc id="780351" wikidata="Q318099" url="?curid=780351" title="Harlan Coben">
<text>Harlan Coben (born c. 1962) is an American writer of mystery novels and thrillers. The plots of his novels often involve the resurfacing of unresolved or misinterpreted events in the past, murders, or fatal accidents and have multiple twists. Twelve of his novels have been adapted for film and television.

Coben has won an Edgar Award, a Shamus Award, and an Anthony Award—the first author to receive all three. His books have been translated into 43 languages and sold over 60 million copies.

==Early life and education==
Coben was born into a Jewish family in Newark, New Jersey, and was raised in Livingston, where he graduated from Livingston High School, with his childhood friend, future governor Chris Christie.

He studied political science at Amherst College, where he was a member of the Psi Upsilon fraternity, along with Dan Brown. Coben was in his senior year at college when he realized he wanted to write.

==Career==
After graduating in 1984, Coben worked in the travel industry, in a company owned by his grandfather. It was during that time when he wrote his first book, romantic suspense thriller &quot;Play Dead&quot;, which was accepted for publication when he was 26 and released in 1990. It was followed by &quot;Miracle Cure&quot; in 1991. He then began writing a series of thrillers featuring a former basketball player turned sports agent, Myron Bolitar, who often finds himself investigating murders involving his clients.

&quot;Tell No One&quot;, his first stand-alone thriller since the creation of the Myron Bolitar series in 1995, was published in 2001. A French-language film adaptation based on the book was released in 2006. Coben followed &quot;Tell No One&quot; with nine more stand-alone novels. His novel &quot;Hold Tight&quot;, published on April 15, 2008, was his first book to debut at number 1 on the &quot;New York Times&quot; Best Seller list.

In 2003, Coben published a short story about his father, who had died of a heart attack at the age of 59 in 1988. Entitled &quot;The Key to My Father,&quot; the story was published in &quot;The New York Times&quot; on Father&#x27;s Day, June 15, 2003. Besides &quot;The New York Times&quot;, his essays and columns have appeared in &quot;Parade&quot; magazine and &quot;Bloomberg Views&quot;.

==Bibliography==
==Awards==
Coben won the 1996 Anthony Award in the category &quot;Best Paperback Original&quot;, for &quot;Deal Breaker&quot;, the first volume of the Myron Bolitar series; it was also nominated for an Edgar Award in the same category. &quot;Fade Away&quot; won the 1997 Shamus Award and the Edgar Award for &quot;Best Paperback Original&quot;, was nominated for the Anthony Award and the Barry Award in the same category, and was nominated for a Dilys Award. The following Myron Bolitar novel, &quot;Back Spin&quot;, won the 1998 Barry Award and was nominated for the Dilys Award and the Shamus Award. In 2002, &quot;Tell No One&quot; was nominated for the Anthony Award, the Macavity Award, the Edgar Award and the Barry Award. In 2010, &quot;Live Wire&quot; won the crime fiction award, the RBA Prize for Crime Writing, worth €125,000.

In 2023, the Japanese edition of &quot;Win&quot;, translated by Toshiki Taguchi, was nominated for the Mystery Writers of Japan Award for Mystery Fiction in Translation.

==Adaptations==
Coben&#x27;s first book to be adapted for the screen was &quot;Tell No One&quot;. Director Guillaume Canet made a French-language film, based on the book, titled &quot;Ne le dis à personne&quot;, in 2006.

Coben&#x27;s 2003 book &quot;No Second Chance&quot; became the basis for the 2015 French miniseries of the same name. Two years later the same happened to &quot;Just One Look&quot;.

Coben is the creator of the British crime drama television show &quot;The Five&quot;, which first aired in April 2016 on the Sky 1 channel in the United Kingdom. Coben also created the French-British crime drama television show &quot;Safe&quot;, which premiered on Netflix in 190 countries on May 10, 2018.

==Films and TV series==
===TV contracts===
In 2022, Amazon Studios announced plans to produce a series based on the first Mickey Bolitar novel, &quot;Shelter&quot;. Jaden Michael stars as Mickey, alongside Constance Zimmer, Adrian Greensmith, Abby Corrigan, and Sage Linder. The series, &quot;Harlan Coben&#x27;s Shelter&quot;, was released on August 18, 2023.

In August 2018, Coben signed a multi-million-dollar, 5-year contract with Netflix. Under the deal, 14 of his novels would be developed into series or films, with him serving as executive producer on all of them. The first one was &quot;The Stranger&quot; which premiered in January 2020. In October 2022, it was announced that Netflix had extended the deal for another 4 years, with the Myron Bolitar series now also available for adaptation but has been canceled following the end of the first season. On February 20, 2023, &quot;Fool Me Once&quot; was announced as an upcoming adaptation in production for Netflix.

==Personal life==
Coben lives in Ridgewood, New Jersey, with his wife Anne Armstrong-Coben, a pediatrician, and their four children.

<doc id="780352" wikidata="Q1862522" url="?curid=780352" title="Pingualuit crater">
<text>The Pingualuit Crater (; from Inuit &quot;pimple&quot;), formerly called the &quot;Chubb Crater&quot; and later the &quot;New Quebec Crater&quot; (), is a relatively young impact crater located on the Ungava Peninsula in the administrative region of Nord-du-Québec, in Quebec, Canada. It is in diameter, and is estimated to be 1.4 ± 0.1 million years old (Pleistocene). The crater and the surrounding area are now part of Pingualuit National Park. The only species of fish in the crater lake is the Arctic char.

==Geography==
The crater is exposed to the surface, rising above the surrounding tundra, and is deep. The Pingualuk Lake fills the hollow, and is one of the deepest lakes in North America. The lake also holds some of the purest fresh water in the world, with a salinity level of less than 3 ppm (by comparison, the salinity level of the Great Lakes is 500 ppm). It is one of the most transparent lakes in the world, with a Secchi disk visible more than deep. The lake has no inlets or apparent outlets, so the water accumulates solely from rain and snow and is lost only through evaporation.

==Formation==
The crater was formed by a meteorite impact 1.4 Ma, as estimated by 40Ar/39Ar dating of impact melt rocks. An analysis of these rocks also revealed planar deformation features as well as the composition of the meteorite itself. Enrichments of iron, nickel, cobalt, and chromium found in impact melt samples suggest that the meteorite was chondritic in nature.

==Discovery and scientific study==
Once largely unknown to the outside world, the lake-filled crater had long been known to local Inuit, who knew it as the &quot;Crystal Eye of Nunavik&quot; for its clear water. World War II pilots often used the almost perfectly circular landmark as a navigational aid.

On June 20, 1943, a United States Army Air Force plane on a meteorological flight over the Ungava region of Quebec Province took a photograph that showed the wide crater rim rising up above the landscape. In 1948, the Royal Canadian Air Force covered the same remote area as part of its program of photomapping Canada, though these photographs were not made publicly available until 1950. Ontario diamond prospector Frederick W. Chubb became interested by the strange terrain shown in the photographs and sought the opinion of geologist V. Ben Meen of the Royal Ontario Museum. Chubb hoped that the crater was that of an extinct volcano, in which case the area might contain diamond deposits similar to those of South Africa. However, Meen&#x27;s knowledge of Canadian geology tentatively ruled out a volcanic origin. Meen subsequently made a brief trip by air to the crater with Chubb in 1950; it was on this trip that Meen proposed the name &quot;Chubb Crater&quot; for the circular feature and &quot;Museum Lake&quot; for the irregular body of water about north of the crater (now known as Laflamme Lake).

Following his return, Meen organized a proper expedition with the cooperation of the National Geographic Society and the Royal Ontario Museum. They travelled to the site in a PBY Catalina flying boat in July 1951, landing on nearby Museum Lake. Attempts to find fragments of nickel-iron from the meteorite using mine detectors lent by the US Army were unsuccessful due to the area&#x27;s granite containing high levels of magnetite. A magnetometer survey did find a magnetic anomaly under the crater&#x27;s northern rim, however, indicating that a large mass of metal-bearing material was buried below the surface. Meen led a second expedition to the crater in 1954. That same year its name was changed to &quot;Cratère du Nouveau-Quebec&quot; (&quot;New Quebec Crater&quot;) at the request of the Quebec Geographic Board.

An expedition led by James Boulger in 1986 collected a small rock sample from the area surrounding the New Quebec Crater. Petrographic analysis of this sample was conducted at the Harvard – Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics and reported to the 51st Meteoritical Society in 1988 by Ursula Marvin and David Kring. Boulger returned to the area that summer, along with a research party led by M. A. Bouchard of the University of Montreal. Three years later Canadian geologist Richard A. F. Grieve listed New Quebec among the 130 known terrestrial impact craters. In 1992, Marvin and Kring documented the petrographic analysis of two impact melt samples collected within the crater rim. They presented evidence of shock metamorphism, which is consistent with similar impact crater sites. In 1999, the name was again changed, to &quot;Pingualuit&quot;. The crater and the surrounding area are now part of Canada&#x27;s Pingualuit National Park, created on January 1, 2004.

===2007 expedition===

Professor Reinhard Pienitz of Laval University led a 2007 expedition to the crater. Sediment cores were extracted from the bottom of the lake, which were filled with fossil pollen, algae, and insect larvae. It was hoped that these finds would yield information about the climate dating back to the last interglacial period 120,000 years ago. Preliminary results show that the upper sediment core contains records of two interglacial periods.

<text>Oasis is a meteorite crater in Libya. The crater is exposed at the surface, and has been significantly eroded. The prominent topographic ring is only the central uplift, which is about in diameter, while the original crater rim is estimated to have been in diameter. The age is estimated to be less than 120 million years (Lower Cretaceous).

The Oasis crater was photographed from space during the Apollo-Soyuz Test Project, and was recognized as a &quot;possible astrobleme&quot; at the time. The crater had been recognized prior to this in 1969 by A. J. Martin. French &quot;et al.&quot; state that Oasis crater and the smaller BP Structure, about to the north, were probably simultaneous impacts. Both impacts deform the Nubian Sandstone of early Cretaceous age.

About to the southeast in Egypt is the much younger Kamil Crater.

<text>Giovanni Leone (; 3 November 1908 – 9 November 2001) was an Italian politician, jurist and university professor who was President of Italy from 1971 to 1978. A founding member of Christian Democracy (DC), Leone briefly served as Prime Minister of Italy from June to December 1963 and again from June to December 1968. He was also President of the Chamber of Deputies from 1955 to 1963.

Leone was the first Italian president to resign because of a scandal. In 1978, he was accused of bribery amid the Lockheed bribery scandals; the allegations were later declared false, and he was rehabilitated.

==Early years==
Leone was born in Naples in 1908 to Mauro Leone and Maria Gioffredi, both from Pomigliano d&#x27;Arco, his father, Mauro Leone, was a prominent lawyer, and had participated in the foundation of the Italian People&#x27;s Party in Campania. Leone grew up in Pomigliano d&#x27;Arco, where he attended the classic lyceum, graduating in 1924.

In 1929, he graduated in law from the prestigious University of Naples Federico II, with the thesis &quot;Violation of family care obligations&quot;, which was even published in 1931. In the following year, he also obtained a degree in social and political science. During university, Leone became a member of Catholic Action (AC). After graduation, he started working in the law firm of Enrico De Nicola, also becoming a professor of criminal procedure at the University of Camerino.

During the 1930s, he became one of the most prominent lawyers and jurists in Southern Italy, teaching at the Universities of Messina, Bari and Naples. In these years, he was also elected president of the Italian section of the International Association of Penal Law, as well as a member of the executive committee.

During World War II, he became a magistrate of the military court of Naples, with the rank of lieutenant colonel. In the aftermath of September 1943 armistice, during the dramatic days of the Nazi occupation, he worked effectively for the release of numerous political prisoners and deserters, thus removing them from possible reprisals. In these years, thanks to a colleague, he met Vittoria Michitto, belonging to one of the best known families of Caserta, whom he married in July 1946. The couple had four sons: Mauro, Paolo, Giancarlo and Giulio, who died at the age of 4.

==Political career==

In 1943, along with his father, Leone was among the founders of the Christian Democracy (DC), the PPI&#x27;s heir led by Alcide De Gasperi. After two years, in 1945, he was elected DC&#x27;s provincial secretary for Naples, immediately becoming one of the leading figures of the party.

In 1946, Leone was among the main supporters of the &quot;neutrality&quot; in the 1946 institutional referendum, in which Italians voted to abolish the monarchy of the House of Savoy. In the same year, he was elected with nearly 32,000 votes to the Constituent Assembly for the constituency of Naples–Caserta. As a prominent jurist, he was appointed in the commission with the aim of drawing up the new republican constitution.

In April 1948, he was elected to the Chamber of Deputies with 60,000 votes. Even as a deputy, he continued working as a lawyer and teaching at the university, considering for a long time these occupations as priority aspects of his life. Also for this reason, according to some testimonies, he often expressed the desire not to take on government positions. Being able to count on his own reliable and territorially rooted electorate, Leone practically never conducted a real party activity. He remained substantially foreign to the large and small factions in which the DC quickly split up, although he could be considered close to the party&#x27;s conservative wing.

===President of the Chamber of Deputies===

Thanks to his &quot;super partes&quot; position, the respect of all DC&#x27;s internal factions, alongside the undoubted consideration gained also from the other political forces during the works of the Constituent Assembly, in 1950, Leone assumed the position of Vice President of the Chamber of Deputies and then, from May 1955, the one of President, which he held continuously until June 1963.

As president, he demonstrated, in addition to a strong sense of the institutions and a scrupulous respect for the rules of democratic confrontation, a remarkable ability to govern parliamentary dynamics, also mastered through that undeniable presence of spirit, contributed in making him a well-known figure in the public opinion. At the same time, he was able to gain approval for his action both within the party, which found him a reliable manager of parliamentary processes, and outside DC, among the majority&#x27;s parties but also in the oppositions, which appreciated his qualities of institutional balance.

==Prime Minister of Italy==
===First term===
In the 1963 general election, the Christian Democrats lost almost one million votes, gaining nearly 38%, while the Italian Communist Party (PCI) arrived second with 25%. However the Italian Liberal Party (PLI) surged to 7%, their best results ever, receiving many votes from former Christian Democratic supporters, who were against Amintore Fanfani&#x27;s centre-left policies. With the decline of electoral support, on 22 June 1963, the majority of DC members decided to replace Fanfani with a provisional government led by Leone.

Leone formed a one-party cabinet, composed only by DC&#x27;s members and externally supported by Italian Socialist Party (PSI), Italian Republican Party (PRI) and Italian Democratic Socialist Party (PSDI). The cabinet was also known as &quot;Bridge Government&quot; (&quot;Governo ponte&quot;), as a transitional government, with the aim of starting a tighter cooperation with the PSI.
As prime minister, Leone had to face one of the most tragic events in Italian republican history, the Vajont Dam disaster. On 9 October 1963, a landslide occurred on Monte Toc, in the province of Pordenone. The landslide caused a megatsunami in the artificial lake in which 50 million cubic metres of water overtopped the dam in a wave of , leading to the complete destruction of several villages and towns, and 1,917 deaths. In the previous months, the Adriatic Society of Electricity (SADE) and the Italian government, which both owned the dam, dismissed evidence and concealed reports describing the geological instability of Monte Toc on the southern side of the basin and other early warning signs reported prior to the disaster.

Immediately after the disaster, government and local authorities insisted on attributing the tragedy to an unexpected and unavoidable natural event. However, numerous warnings, signs of danger, and negative appraisals had been disregarded in the previous months and the eventual attempt to safely control the landslide into the lake by lowering its level came when the landslide was almost imminent and was too late to prevent it. The communist newspaper &quot;L&#x27;Unità&quot; was the first to denounce the actions of management and government. Leone accused the PCI of political profiteering from the tragedy, promising to bring justice to the people killed in the disaster. However, a few months after the end of his premiership, he became the head of SADE&#x27;s team of lawyers, who significantly reduced the amount of compensation for the survivors and ruled out payment for at least 600 victims.

In December 1963, after only five months of government, when the congress of the PSI authorized a full engagement of the party into the government, Leone resigned and Aldo Moro, the secretary of the DC and leader of the more leftist wing of the party, became the new prime minister, ruling Italy for more than four years.

===1964 presidential election===
In August 1964, President Antonio Segni suffered a serious cerebral hemorrhage while he was working at the presidential palace; he only partially recovered and decided to resign. Leone was selected as the DC&#x27;s official candidate for the presidency, but Fanfani decided to run against him. However, neither Fanfani nor Leone succeeded in being elected, in fact, during the 1964 presidential election, the social-democratic leader Giuseppe Saragat succeeded in gaining the majority of votes.

In August 1967, Leone was appointed Senator for Life by President Saragat.

===Second term===

In June 1968, after the general election, Saragat appointed Leone at the head of the government. As his first cabinet, also the second one was composed only by DC members and externally supported by PSU and PRI.

In November 1968, the Parliament approved a law that introduced a special benefit for full unemployment for workers in the industrial sector, in cases of total or partial closing down of enterprises or large-scale dismissals, equalling two-thirds of previous monthly earnings for 180 days. The law also extended earnings replacement benefits to cases of sectoral crises or industrial restructuring with a new compensation formula equaling 80% of previous earnings for 3 months (9 months in exceptional circumstances), allowed for family allowances to be paid to those in receipt of unemployment benefits.

Leone&#x27;s second premiership lasted only seven months. In December 1968, he resigned and Mariano Rumor became the new prime minister.

==President (1971–1978)==

In 1971, Amintore Fanfani was proposed as Christian Democracy&#x27;s candidate for the Presidency of the Republic. However his candidacy was weakened by the divisions within his own party and the candidacy of the socialist Francesco De Martino, who received votes from PCI, PSI and some PSDI members. Fanfani retired after several unsuccessful ballots and, at the twenty-second round, Leone was selected as the Christian democratic candidate for the presidency, being slightly preferred to Aldo Moro. At the twenty third round he was finally elected with a centre-right majority, with 518 votes out of 996, including those of the neo-fascist Italian Social Movement (MSI). Leone&#x27;s majority was the narrowest one ever obtained by an elected president and with twenty-three rounds of voting the 1971 presidential election remains still today the longest presidential election in the Italian republican history.

Leone&#x27;s presidency was considered quite revolutionary for the role held by his wife, Vittoria. Before her, the wife of the Italian presidents had always been on the sidelines, not involved in the Italian political life. However, Vittoria Leone completely changed the role and had been widely regarded as the most prominent first lady of the Italian Republic.

During his presidency, he had to face an extremely complex political and social situation. Already in the first months of the seven-year term, he had to approve the early dissolution of the Chambers, for the first time since the birth of the Republic. This decision was taken by Leone with the approval of most of the political parties, but it was accompanied by the choice to entrust the management of the electoral phase, not to the resigning coalition government of Emilio Colombo, but to a one-party government led by Giulio Andreotti. For this choice, Leone was heavily criticised by the opposition. With a total of 152 votes in favor and 158 against, the government did not gain the confidence of the Senate and was forced to resign after only 9 days.

After Andreotti&#x27;s resignation in July 1973, Leone gave to Mariano Rumor the task of forming a new centre-left cabinet, which however lasted only a year, when, in November, Aldo Moro became once again prime minister. During Moro&#x27;s two-years rule, the DC tried to open a dialogue with the PCI of Enrico Berlinguer, in a political phase known as Historic Compromise, with the aim of bringing the communists into the government&#x27;s majority. Leone, as a member of the party&#x27;s right-wing, did not approve Moro&#x27;s move, however he never openly opposed it.

===Kidnapping of Aldo Moro===

On the morning of 16 March 1978, the day on which the new Andreotti cabinet was supposed to have undergone a confidence vote in the Italian Parliament, the car of Aldo Moro, then-president of the Christian Democracy, was assaulted by a group of Red Brigades (BR) in Via Fani in Rome. Firing automatic weapons, the terrorists killed Moro&#x27;s bodyguards (two Carabinieri in Moro&#x27;s car and three policemen in the following car) and kidnapped him.

During the kidnapping, Leone was in favour of a negotiation with the terrorists, while Prime Minister Andreotti strongly opposed it: the BR proposed an exchange of prisoners to the Italian government, which was supported by Leone, but Andreotti refused. During his imprisonment, Moro wrote a statement expressing very harsh judgements against Andreotti. On 9 May 1978, Moro&#x27;s body was found in the trunk of a Renault 4 in Via Caetani, after 55 days of imprisonment, during which Moro was submitted to a political trial by the so-called &quot;people&#x27;s court&quot; set up by the Red Brigades.

===Lockheed scandal and resignation===
Leone&#x27;s political career came to an end in 1978 due to the Lockheed bribery scandal. The allegations came from the United States and were supported by the Italian political magazine &quot;L&#x27;Espresso&quot;. According to the allegations, Lockheed bribed many high-profile politicians in Italy to purchase Hercules Aircraft for the military. Leone and his family were allegedly implicated in the bribery.

In June 1978, after months of polemics, Leone resigned as President of the Republic. However, the accusations were never proved and his most prominent accuser was convicted of libel three times.

==Death and legacy==

After his resignation, Leone continued sitting in the Italian Parliament as a senator for life. Moreover, through writings and interviews, as well as judgments, he also had the opportunity to reaffirm and stress the correctness of his acts as president of the Italian Republic and the unreliability of the accusations moved against him and his family. In addition, several of the politicians who had attacked him most during the presidency, also had the opportunity of apologizing to him. Among these, the radical leaders Marco Pannella and Emma Bonino, who on the occasion of Leone&#x27;s 90th birthday, openly expressed their regrets.

On 25 September 2001, just a few weeks before his 93rd birthday, a decree by the Prime Minister awarded Leone of the title of President Emeritus of the Republic, which would be applied to all the future former presidents. Leone died in Rome on 9 November 2001 at his villa on the Via Cassia. On 25 November 2006, President Giorgio Napolitano stated that the Senate had granted full recognition of the correctness of Leone&#x27;s actions, completely rehabilitating his political actions.

Leone was portrayed as a key antagonist in the 2020 film &quot;Rose Island&quot;, which tells the story of the Republic of Rose Island and the government&#x27;s attempts to destroy it. Leone was played in the film by Luca Zingaretti.

<doc id="780361" wikidata="Q2667489" url="?curid=780361" title="Obolon' crater">
<text>Obolon&#x27; crater () is a diameter buried meteorite impact crater situated about southeast of Kyiv in Ukraine (Poltava Oblast).
The site has been drilled, which revealed the presence of shocked minerals and impact melt rock; the high chlorine content of the latter suggesting that the area was covered by shallow sea at the time of impact.
One estimate puts the age at 169 ± 7 million years (Middle Jurassic).

== Hypothetical multiple impact event ==

It has been suggested by Geophysicist David Rowley of the University of Chicago, working with John Spray of the University of New Brunswick and Simon Kelley of the Open University, that Obolon&#x27; may have been part of a hypothetical multiple impact event which also formed the Manicouagan impact structure in northern Quebec, Rochechouart impact structure in France, Saint Martin crater in Manitoba, and Red Wing crater in North Dakota. All of the craters had previously been known and studied, but their paleoalignment had never before been demonstrated. Rowley has said that the likelihood that these craters could be aligned like this due to chance is nearly zero.

<doc id="780373" wikidata="Q974869" url="?curid=780373" title="Leukocytosis">
<text>Leukocytosis is a condition in which the white cell (leukocyte) count is above the normal range in the blood. It is frequently a sign of an inflammatory response, most commonly the result of infection, but may also occur following certain parasitic infections or bone tumors as well as leukemia. It may also occur after strenuous exercise, convulsions such as epilepsy, emotional stress, pregnancy and labor, anesthesia, as a side effect of medication (e.g., lithium), and epinephrine administration. There are five principal types of leukocytosis:
# Neutrophilia (the most common form)
# Lymphocytosis
# Monocytosis
# Eosinophilia
# Basophilia
This increase in leukocyte (primarily neutrophils) is usually accompanied by a &quot;left upper shift&quot; in the ratio of immature to mature neutrophils and macrophages. The proportion of immature leukocytes increases due to proliferation and inhibition of granulocyte and monocyte precursors in the bone marrow which is stimulated by several products of inflammation including C3a and G-CSF.
Although it may indicate illness, leukocytosis is considered a laboratory finding instead of a separate disease. This classification is similar to that of fever, which is also a test result instead of a disease.
&quot;Right shift&quot; in the ratio of immature to mature neutrophils is considered with reduced count or lack of &quot;young neutrophils&quot; (metamyelocytes, and band neutrophils) in blood smear, associated with the presence of &quot;giant neutrophils&quot;. This fact shows suppression of bone marrow activity, as a hematological sign specific for pernicious anemia and radiation sickness.

A leukocyte count above 50 × 109/L is termed a &quot;leukemoid reaction&quot;, which is the reaction of a healthy bone marrow to extreme stress, trauma, or infection. It is different from leukemia and from leukoerythroblastosis, in which either immature white blood cells (acute leukemia) or mature, yet non-functional, white blood cells (chronic leukemia) are present in peripheral blood. 

==Classification==
Leukocytosis can be subcategorized by the type of white blood cell that is increased in number. Leukocytosis in which neutrophils are elevated is neutrophilia; leukocytosis in which lymphocyte count is elevated is lymphocytosis; leukocytosis in which monocyte count is elevated is monocytosis; and leukocytosis in which eosinophil count is elevated is eosinophilia.

An extreme form of leukocytosis, in which the WBC count exceeds 100,000/μL, is leukostasis. In this form there are so many WBCs that clumps of them block blood flow. This leads to ischemic problems including transient ischemic attack and stroke.

==Causes==

Leukocytosis is very common in acutely ill patients. It occurs in response to a wide variety of conditions, including viral, bacterial, fungal, or parasitic infection, cancer, hemorrhage, and exposure to certain medications or chemicals including steroids. For lung diseases such as pneumonia and tuberculosis, WBC count is very important for the diagnosis of the disease, as leukocytosis is usually present.

The mechanism that causes leukocytosis can be of several forms: an increased release of leukocytes from bone marrow storage pools, decreased margination of leukocytes onto vessel walls, decreased extravasation of leukocytes from the vessels into tissues, or an increase in number of precursor cells in the marrow.

Certain medications, including corticosteroids, lithium and beta agonists, may cause leukocytosis.

Leukocytosis is an expected finding in healthy women during the post-partum period and is not a cause for alarm unless accompanied by clinical manifestations of infection.

==Diagnosis==
===Leukocyte counts===
Below are blood reference ranges for various types of leukocytes/WBCs. The 97.5 percentile (right limits in intervals in image, showing 95% prediction intervals) is a common limit for defining leukocytosis.
==Treatment==
While treatment is usually not necessary in the majority of cases, hyperleukocytosis (WBC count &gt; 50 or 100 × 109/L), which can be seen in some leukemic patients, is treated to prevent leukostasis. You can treat this yourself by quitting smoking, eating whole foods and a plant based diet, reducing stress, and exercising healthily.

<doc id="780376" wikidata="Q1141631" url="?curid=780376" title="Ouarkziz crater">
<text>Ouarkziz () is a meteorite impact crater in Algeria. It is 3.5 kilometers in diameter and the age is estimated to be less than 70 million years (Cretaceous or younger). The crater is exposed at the surface.

The Ouarkziz Impact Crater is located in northwestern Algeria, close to the border with Morocco. The crater was formed by a meteor impact less than 70 million years ago, during the late Cretaceous Period of the Mesozoic Era.

Originally called Tindouf, the 3.5-kilometer wide crater has been heavily eroded since its formation; however, its circular morphology is highlighted by exposures of older sedimentary rock layers that form roughly northwest to southeast-trending ridgelines. From the vantage point of an astronaut on the International Space Station, the impact crater is clearly visible with a magnifying camera lens.

A geologist interpreting this image to build a geological history of the region would conclude that the Ouarkziz crater is younger than the sedimentary rocks, as the rock layers had to be already present for the meteor to hit them. Likewise, a stream channel is visible cutting across the center of the structure, indicating that the channel formed after the impact had occurred. This Principle of Cross-Cutting Relationships, usually attributed to the 19th century geologist Charles Lyell, is a basic logic tool used by geologists to build relative sequence and history of events when investigating a region.

<text>John Calhoun Phillips (November 13, 1870 – June 25, 1943) was an American politician who served as the third governor of the state of Arizona from January 7, 1929, to January 5, 1931.

Born in 1870 in Vermont, Illinois, Phillips graduated from Hedding College in 1893 and passed the bar in Illinois. He moved to Arizona in 1898 where he practiced private law while at the same time working as a construction worker to earn a living. He helped to build the state capitol building that he would later occupy as governor. He served as a probate judge from 1902 to 1912 before being elected to the Arizona House of Representatives and later, the Arizona Senate.

Phillips became governor in 1929 during the Great Depression. He was instrumental in the creation of a free county library system, the Colorado River Commission, the State Bureau of Criminal Identification and the Arizona Game and Fish Department. During his governorship, he refused to raise the salary for the state judges for political reasons.

Considered an unattractive man with a sense of humor, Phillips referred to himself as &quot;the ugliest man in Arizona.&quot; Phillips died in 1943 from a heart attack while fishing on Lake Mary near Flagstaff, Arizona. He was entombed at Greenwood/Memory Lawn Mortuary &amp; Cemetery in Phoenix.

<doc id="780380" wikidata="Q447945" url="?curid=780380" title="Alun Hoddinott">
<text>Alun Hoddinott CBE (11 August 1929 – 12 March 2008) was a Welsh composer of classical music, one of the first to receive international recognition.

==Life and works==
Hoddinott was born in Bargoed, Glamorganshire, Wales. He was educated at Gowerton Grammar school before matriculating to University College, Cardiff, and later studied privately with Arthur Benjamin. His first major composition, the Clarinet Concerto, was performed at the Cheltenham Festival of 1954 by Gervase de Peyer with the Hallé Orchestra and Sir John Barbirolli.

This brought Hoddinott a national profile, which was followed by a string of commissions by leading orchestras and soloists. These commissions continued up to his death, and he was championed by some of the most distinguished singers and instrumentalists of the 20th century. These include singers such as Dame Margaret Price, Dame Gwyneth Jones, Sir Thomas Allen, Jill Gomez, Sir Geraint Evans and more recently Claire Booth, Helen Field, Gail Pearson and Jeremy Huw Williams. Instrumentalists have included Ruggiero Ricci, Mstislav Rostropovich, Dennis Brain, Osian Ellis, Cecil Aronowitz, Nia Harries, Roger Woodward and John Ogdon to name a few, and more recently euphonium player , cellist Kathryn Price, trombonist Mark Eager and song pianist Andrew Matthews-Owen.

Hoddinott was prolific, writing symphonies, sonatas, and concertos: his style evolved over a long and distinguished career, from the neo-classicism of the Clarinet Concerto to a brand of serialism which allowed a tonal framework to the structure, combining a penchant for dark textures and brooding harmonies similar to that of another British composer, Alan Rawsthorne, with Bartokian arch-forms and palindromes. However, his move into opera from 1970 helped to broaden his stylistic range and lighten his palette. His music often displays a brooding, darkly lyrical intensity, manifested in his nocturnal slow movements. One of the best examples is his rhapsodic &quot;Poem for violin and orchestra&quot;, inspired by a line from James Joyce, &quot;The Heaventree of Stars&quot;. Combining tough, disciplined writing with a sense of the mysterious and unknown, his musical style has been described as &quot;modernist romantic&quot;.

Alun Hoddinott was also a gifted teacher and, as Professor of Music at University College, Cardiff, was responsible for the expansion of the Department of Music (with a purpose-built building) which became the largest in Europe in the 1980s. Hoddinott taught a number of talented composers during his time at Cardiff, including the Irish composer John Buckley and Welsh composers Karl Jenkins, Jeffrey Lewis, Gwyn Parry-Jones, John Metcalf and Christopher Painter.

He was awarded honorary doctorates from numerous leading musical institutions, including the Royal Academy of Music, the Royal Northern College of Music and the Royal Welsh College of Music &amp; Drama, as well as the Walford Davies Award. He was appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in the 1983 New Year Honours.

In 2005, Hoddinott produced a fanfare to be performed at the wedding of Charles, Prince of Wales, to Camilla Parker Bowles, having previously written works to celebrate Prince Charles&#x27; 16th birthday and his investiture.

In 1997 Alun Hoddinott received the Glyndŵr Award for an Outstanding Contribution to the Arts in Wales during the Machynlleth Festival. He also received a Lifetime Achievement Award from the Arts Council of Wales in 1999, and Fellowship of the Welsh Music Guild.

On 1 March 2007 (Saint David&#x27;s Day) soprano Helen Field and baritone Jeremy Huw Williams gave the world première of his orchestral song cycle &quot;Serenissima&quot; with the BBC National Orchestra of Wales at St David&#x27;s Hall. It was announced on this occasion that the new home of the BBC National Orchestra of Wales in the Wales Millennium Centre in Cardiff would include a specially built 350-seat concert hall, named BBC Hoddinott Hall (). The new hall was inaugurated with an opening festival held between 22 January and 1 February 2009, with live performances broadcast on BBC Radio 3. The opening piece was a show piece by Hoddinott himself. 

Alun Hoddinott died on 11 March 2008 at Morriston Hospital, Swansea, aged 78, the day after the world première at the Wigmore Hall of his &quot;Music for String Quartet&quot;, given by the Sacconi Quartet. His very last work, the orchestral tone poem &quot;Taliesin&quot;, was premièred by the BBC National Orchestra of Wales at the Swansea Festival of Music in October 2009.

<doc id="780389" wikidata="Q1542410" url="?curid=780389" title="Thrombocythemia">
<text>In hematology, thrombocythemia is a condition of high platelet (thrombocyte) count in the blood. Normal count is in the range of 150 to 450 platelets per liter of blood, but investigation is typically only considered if the upper limit exceeds 750/L.

When the cause is unknown, the term thrombocythemia is used, as either primary thrombocythemia or essential thrombocythemia. The condition arises from a fault in the bone marrow cells leading to over-production of platelets but the cause of the fault is unknown, and this type is not common.

When the cause is known such as another disorder or disease, the term thrombocytosis is preferred, as either secondary or reactive thrombocytosis. Reactive thrombocytosis is the most common type and though it can often have no symptoms it can sometimes predispose to thrombosis. In contrast, thrombocytopenia refers to abnormally low blood platelet numbers in the blood.

== Signs and symptoms ==
High platelet counts do not necessarily signal any clinical problems, and can be picked up on a routine full blood count. However, it is important that a full medical history be elicited to ensure that the increased platelet count is not due to a secondary process. Often, it occurs in tandem with an inflammatory disease as the principal stimulants of platelet production (e.g. thrombopoietin) are elevated in these clinical states as part of the acute phase reaction. High platelet counts can occur in patients with polycythemia vera (high red blood cell counts), and is an additional risk factor for complications.

A very small number of people report symptoms of erythromelalgia, a burning sensation and redness of the extremities that resolves with cooling, or aspirin or both.

Scientific literature sometimes excludes thrombocytosis from the scope of thrombophilia by definition, but practically, by the definition of thrombophilia as an increased predisposition to thrombosis, thrombocytosis (especially primary thrombocytosis) is a potential cause of thrombophilia. Conversely, secondary thrombocytosis very rarely causes thrombotic complications.

== Causes ==
Reactive thrombocythemia is the most common cause of a high platelet count. It accounts for 88% to 97% of thrombocythemia cases in adults, and near 100% in children. In adults, acute infection, tissue damage, chronic inflammation and malignancy are the common causes of reactive thrombocythemia. Usually, one or more of these conditions is present in more than 75% of the cases with reactive thrombocythemia. Causes for reactive thrombocythemia in children are similar to adults. In addition, hemolytic anemia and thalassemia are often present in children living in the Middle East. Other causes of reactive thrombocythemia include: post surgery, iron deficiency, drugs, and rebound effect after bone marrow suppression. Research suggests that thrombocytosis can also occur after physical exercise, and is triggered by hemoconcentration and the release of platelets from the liver, lungs and spleen.

The SARS disease caused thrombocytosis.

Once the reactive causes of thrombocythemia are ruled out, clonal thrombocythemia should be considered. The most common cause of clonal thrombocythemia is a myeloproliferative neoplasm. These include: essential thrombocythemia, chronic myelogenous leukemia, polycythemia vera, and primary myelofibrosis.

Extremely rare causes of thrombocythemia are spurious causes. This is due to the presence of structures resembling platelets in the blood such as needle-like cryoglobulin crystals, cytoplasmic fragments of circulating leukemic cells, bacteria, and red blood cell microvesicles. These structures are counted as platelets by the automated machine counter; therefore, causing the platelet number to be falsely elevated. However, such error can be avoided by doing a peripheral blood smear.

== Diagnosis ==
Laboratory tests might include: full blood count, liver enzymes, renal function and erythrocyte sedimentation rate.

If the cause for the high platelet count remains unclear, bone marrow biopsy is often undertaken, to differentiate whether the high platelet count is reactive or essential.

== Treatment ==
Often, no treatment is required or necessary for reactive thrombocytosis. In cases of reactive thrombocytosis of more than 1,000x109/L, it may be considered to administer daily low dose aspirin (such as 65 mg) to minimize the risk of stroke or thrombosis.

However, in essential thrombocythemia where platelet counts are over 750x109/L or 1,000x109/L, especially if there are other risk factors for thrombosis, treatment may be needed. Selective use of aspirin at low doses is thought to be protective. Extremely high platelet counts can be treated with hydroxyurea (a cytoreducing agent) or anagrelide (Agrylin).

In Janus kinase 2 positive disorders, ruxolitinib (Jakafi) can be effective.

<doc id="780393" wikidata="Q256223" url="?curid=780393" title="LaVeyan Satanism">
<text>LaVeyan Satanism is the name given to the form of Satanism promoted by American occultist and author Anton LaVey (1930–1997). LaVey founded the Church of Satan (CoS) in 1966 in San Francisco. Although LaVey is thought to have had more influence with his Satanic aesthetics of &quot;colourful&quot; rites and &quot;scandalous&quot; clothes that created a &quot;gigantic media circus&quot;, he also promoted his ideas in writings, such as the popular Satanic Bible. LaVeyan Satanism has been classified as a new religious movement and a form of Western esotericism by scholars of religion. LaVey&#x27;s ideas have been said to weave together an array of sometimes &quot;contradictory&quot; &quot;thinkers and tropes&quot;, combining &quot;humanism, hedonism, aspects of pop psychology and the human potential movement&quot;, along with &quot;a lot of showmanship&quot;, His ideas were heavily influenced by the ideas and writings of Friedrich Nietzsche, Ayn Rand and Arthur Desmond.

Contrary to the popular image of Satanism as the worship of an evil supernatural entity, LaVeyan adherents do not consider Satan to be a literal being or entity, but a positive archetype representing humanity&#x27;s natural instincts of pride and , and of defiance against Abrahamic religions which preach suppression of these urges. The church considers humans to be animals existing in an amoral universe, and promotes a philosophy based on individualism and egoism, coupled with Social Darwinism and anti-egalitarianism. LaVey valued success, not &quot;evil for its own sake&quot;.

Church doctrines are based on materialism and philosophical naturalism, rejecting the existence of the supernatural (including Satan and God), body-soul dualism, and life after death. However, LaVey also &quot;hinted&quot; at the possibility of paranormal forces, and believed magic could and should be used for material gain, personal influence, to harm enemies, and to gain success in love and sex. &quot;Magic&quot; in LaVeyan Satanism involves ritual practice meant as psychodramatic catharsis to focus one&#x27;s emotional energy for a specific purpose (called &quot;greater magic&quot; and very much resembling psychotherapy); and also psychological manipulation using applied psychology and glamour (or &quot;wile and guile&quot;) to bend another individual or a situation to one&#x27;s will (called &quot;lesser magic&quot;).

LaVey&#x27;s followers in the Church of Satan maintain that he and the church &quot;codified&quot; Satanism, and while some Satanic splinter groups — such as John Dewey Allee&#x27;s First Church of Satan and Karla LaVey&#x27;s First Satanic Church — follow LaVey&#x27;s ideas, others do not. The Temple of Set embraces &quot;Theist&quot; supernatural Satanism, while the large and active Satanic Temple, though atheist, rejects LaVey and Ayn Rand&#x27;s ideas on hierarchy and self-centeredness in favor of a &quot;left-wing&quot;, &quot;socially engaged&quot; Satanism, agitating for separation of church and state, reproductive rights, and transgender rights.

==Definition==
LaVeyan Satanism – which is also sometimes termed &quot;Modern Satanism&quot; and &quot;Rational Satanism&quot; – is classified by scholars of religious studies as a new religious movement. When used, &quot;Rational Satanism&quot; is often employed to distinguish the approach of the LaVeyan Satanists from the &quot;Esoteric Satanism&quot; or &quot;Theistic Satanism&quot;, embraced by groups like the Temple of Set, and Joy of Satan Ministries. A number of religious studies scholars have also described it as a form of &quot;self-religion&quot; or &quot;self-spirituality&quot;, with religious studies scholar Amina Olander Lap arguing that it should be seen as being both part of the &quot;prosperity wing&quot; of the self-spirituality New Age movement and a form of the Human Potential Movement. Similarly, the scholar of Satanism Jesper Aa. Petersen calls modern Satanism a &quot;cousin&quot; of the New Age and Human Potential movements.

The anthropologist Jean La Fontaine described LaVeyan Satanism as having &quot;both elitist and anarchist elements&quot;, also citing one occult bookshop owner who referred to the church&#x27;s approach as &quot;anarchistic hedonism&quot;. In their study of Satanism, the religious studies scholars Asbjørn Dyrendal, James R. Lewis, and Jesper Aa. Petersen suggested that LaVey viewed his religion as &quot;an antinomian self-religion for productive misfits, with a cynically carnivalesque take on life, and no supernaturalism&quot;. The sociologist of religion James R. Lewis even described LaVeyan Satanism as &quot;a blend of Epicureanism and Ayn Rand&#x27;s philosophy, flavored with a pinch of ritual magic.&quot; The historian of religion Mattias Gardell described LaVey&#x27;s as &quot;a rational ideology of egoistic hedonism and self-preservation&quot;, while Nevill Drury characterised LaVeyan Satanism as &quot;a religion of self-indulgence&quot;. It has also been described as an &quot;institutionalism of Machiavellian self-interest&quot;.

The Church of Satan rejects the legitimacy of any other organizations who claim to be Satanists, dubbing them &quot;Devil worshipers&quot;. Prominent Church leader Blanche Barton described Satanism as &quot;an alignment, a lifestyle&quot;. LaVey and the church espoused the view that &quot;Satanists are born, not made&quot;; that they are outsiders by their nature, living as they see fit, who are self-realized in a religion which appeals to the would-be Satanist&#x27;s nature, leading them to realize they are Satanists through finding a belief system that is in line with their own perspective and lifestyle.

==Importance and influence==
Religious studies scholar R. Van Luijk writes, &quot;Genealogically speaking, every known Satanist group or organization in the world today derives directly or indirectly from LaVey&#x27;s 1966 Church of Satan, even if they are dismissive of LaVey or choose to emphasize other real or alleged forerunners of Satanism.&quot;
The sociologist James R. Lewis noted that &quot;LaVey was directly responsible for the genesis of Satanism as a serious religious (as opposed to a purely literary) movement&quot;, and the first organized church in modern times to be devoted to the figure of Satan. According to Egil Asprem and Kennet Granholm, scholars agree that there is no reliably documented case of Satanic continuity prior to the founding of the Church of Satan. For Faxneld and Petersen, the Church represented &quot;the first public, highly visible, and long-lasting organization which propounded a coherent satanic discourse&quot;.

The church itself is dismissive of other Satanist groups as deviant or unimportant, insisting Satanism has been &quot;codified&quot; as &quot;a religion and philosophy&quot; by LaVey and the church. The Church of Satan rejects the legitimacy of any other organizations who claim to be Satanists, dubbing them reverse-Christians, pseudo-Satanists or Devil worshipers, atheistic or otherwise, and maintains a purist approach to Satanism as expounded by LaVey.

==Beliefs==

===Satan as symbol===
Among LaVey&#x27;s influences were the Romantic writers (such as William Blake, Lord Byron, Percy Bysshe Shelley, and William Hazlitt), who saw the Satan of John Milton&#x27;s Paradise Lost as a flawed anti-hero, a rebel leader of charisma and bravery, defying God&#x27;s tyranny, and not as the source of all evil, as he is thought of in traditional Christianity. The Romantic did not worship Satan but saw him as a positive symbol.

LaVey embraced the iconography of Satan and the label of &quot;Satanist&quot; because it shocked people into thinking, and its association with social nonconformity and rebellion against the dominant system. When asked about the name of his religion, he replied that &quot;the reason it&#x27;s called Satanism is because it&#x27;s fun, it&#x27;s accurate and it&#x27;s productive&quot;.

LaVey saw Satan as a symbol of the individual&#x27;s own vitality, thus representing an autonomous power within, and a representation of personal liberty and individualism. Throughout &quot;The Satanic Bible&quot;, the LaVeyan Satanist&#x27;s view of god is described as the Satanist&#x27;s true &quot;self&quot;—a projection of his or her own personality—not an external deity. In works like &quot;The Satanic Bible&quot;, LaVey often uses the terms &quot;god&quot; and &quot;Satan&quot; interchangeably, viewing both as personifications of human nature.

Despite his professed atheism, and his not encouraging the worship of Satan as a deity, 
some passages of LaVey&#x27;s writings left room for a literal interpretation of Satan, and some members of his Church understood the Devil as an entity that really existed. It is possible that LaVey left some ambivalence in his writings so as not to drive away those Church members who were theistic Satanists.
Both LaVey&#x27;s writings and the publications of the church continue to refer to Satan as if he were a real being, in doing so seeking to reinforce the Satanist&#x27;s self-interest.

===Atheism and Satan===

LaVey was an atheist who rejected the existence of all gods, of any afterlife, and
of Satan as an entity who literally exists. 
The use of Satan as a central figure was intentionally symbolic. LaVey sought to cement his belief system within the secularist world-view that derived from natural science, thus providing him with an atheistic basis with which to legitimized his religion, and criticize Christianity and other supernaturalist beliefs as irrational. He defined Satanism as &quot;a secular philosophy of rationalism and self-preservation (natural law, animal state), giftwrapping these ideas in religious trappings to add to their appeal.&quot; In this way, LaVeyan Satanism has been described as an &quot;antireligious religion&quot; by Rubin van Luijk.

===Reverse Christianity===
LaVey used Christianity as a negative mirror for his new faith, rejecting the basic principles and theology of Christian belief, which he also believed would soon disappear anyway. He perceived Christianity as a lie, exerting a negative force on humanity, by promoted idealism, self-sacrifice, altruism, community mindedness, self-denigration, herd behavior, and irrationality. Instead of (what it believed to be) these vices, LaVey encouraged materialism, egoism, carnality, atheism, social stratification and social Darwinism. LaVey&#x27;s Satanism was particularly critical of what it understands as Christianity&#x27;s emphasis on the spiritual and denial of humanity&#x27;s animal nature, and instead calls for the celebration of, and indulgence in, animal desires.

Christianity was not the only negative force in the eyes of Laveyan Satanism. Other major religions, along with philosophies such as humanism and liberal democracy were also detrimental to human fulfillment.

===Influences and political aspects===
According to the Church&#x27;s &quot;Policy on Politics&quot;, the Church has no &quot;&#x27;official&#x27; political position&quot;, and leaves politics to its individual members, each of whom have their own opinions of what (if any) political candidates or causes are worth supporting, usually based on &quot;their own practical needs and desires&quot;. This may embrace one or more of all sorts of different ideologies, (it then lists every conceivable ideology including Communism and Socialism). As for the desire to &#x27;change the world&#x27;, this (it asserts) is an &quot;emotional drive&quot; that is a &quot;common stage of early adult development&quot; which adults outgrow,
&quot;typically beginning around age 16 and lasting until around age 24&quot;.

On the other hand, observers have characterized LaVeyan Satanism as belonging to the political right rather than the left. Historian of Satanism Ruben van Luijk describes it as a form of &quot;anarchism of the Right&quot;. Randall Alfred describes LaVey&#x27;s &quot;stance&quot; as &quot;law-and-order, right-wing&quot; and &quot;patriotic&quot;.
LaVey was influenced by the writings of Herbert Spencer (strongly associated with Social Darwinism and the expression &quot;the survival of the fittest&quot;), Friedrich Nietzsche (who opposed emphasis on mercy, charity, and helping the weak as a &#x27;slave&#x27;s morality&#x27;), and Ayn Rand (whose overarching philosophical theme was that &quot;unfettered self-interest is good and altruism is destructive&quot;).

LaVey believed in Social Darwinism, and the fundamental inequality of human beings, and that an anti-egalitarian and elitist society was only natural. Social Darwinism is particularly noticeable in &quot;The Book of Satan&quot;, where LaVey uses portions of Redbeard&#x27;s &quot;Might Is Right&quot;, and refers to man&#x27;s inherent strength and instinct for self-preservation.

LaVey described his Satanism as &quot;just Ayn Rand&#x27;s philosophy with ceremony and ritual added&quot;. LaVey&#x27;s &quot;Nine Satanic Statements&quot; (see below) are paraphrased from a speech by John Galt in Rand&#x27;s novel Atlas Shrugged.
(An essay on the church&#x27;s website by &quot;Nemo&quot;, a Magister in the Church of Satan, states &quot;Satanism has far more in common&quot; with Rand&#x27;s philosophy of &quot;Objectivism&quot; &quot;than with any other religion or philosophy. Objectivists endorse reason, selfishness, greed and atheism.&quot; However he finds some differences, such as Rand&#x27;s hesitancy to accept either &quot;the use of force to cause others to submit to the will of the stronger or cleverer individual&quot;, or the axiom of &quot;personal needs as absolutely reliable to determine the best course of action in any circumstance&quot;. The atheism of Objectivism is also more pure, completely rejecting &quot;the value of a god&quot;, while Satanists hold that &quot;the meaning of god is useful&quot; if it is defined as &quot;the most important person in an individual&#x27;s universe&quot;, which of course is the individual himself.) In the Satanic Bible, LaVey writes that the Satanist asks themselves: &quot;&#x27;Why not really be honest and if you are going to create a god in your image, why not create that god as yourself&#x27;... every man is a god if he chooses to recognize himself as one&quot;.

LaVey was strongly influenced by Nietzsche, according to religious studies scholar Asbjørn Dyrendal and Social Scientist Gabriel Andrade. Nietzsche celebrated the values of Dionysus – the Ancient Greek god of wine and excess – who also represented (at least for Nietzsche), uninhibited rage and hedonism, an opposite of &quot;the moral restrictions of Christianity&quot;, according to Andrade. Nietzsche was also famous for the concepts of Übermensch (the naturally superior man interested in accomplishment in this life, not in the spiritual or afterlife) and &quot;God is dead&quot;.

LaVey viewed the human being explicitly as an animal, existing in an amoral context of survival of the fittest, with no purpose other than survival. He believed that in adopting a philosophical belief in its own superiority above that of the other animals, humankind had become &quot;the most vicious animal of all&quot;. For LaVey, non-human animals and children represent an ideal, &quot;the purest form of carnal existence&quot;, because they have not been indoctrinated with Christian or other religious concepts of guilt and shame. His ethical views championed placing oneself and one&#x27;s family before others, minding one&#x27;s own business, and – for men – behaving like a &quot;gentleman&quot; . In responding to threats and harm, he urged that &quot;if a man smite thee on the one cheek, &quot;smash&quot; him on the other&quot;, reversing the Biblical Christian teaching and promoted the principle of &quot;lex talionis&quot; (an eye for an eye) derived from Ragnar Redbeard&#x27;s book &quot;Might is Right&quot;.

===Individualism===
LaVeyan Satanism places great emphasis on the role of liberty and personal freedom. LaVey believed that the ideal Satanist should be individualistic and non-conformist, rejecting what he called the &quot;colorless existence&quot; that mainstream society sought to impose on those living within it. He rejected consumerism and what he called the &quot;death cult&quot; of fashion. He praised the human ego for encouraging an individual&#x27;s pride, self-respect, and self-realization and accordingly believed in satisfying the ego&#x27;s desires. He expressed the view that self-indulgence was a desirable trait, and that hate and aggression were not wrong or undesirable emotions but that they were necessary and advantageous for survival. Accordingly, he praised the Seven Deadly Sins (pride, greed, wrath, envy, lust, gluttony and sloth), as virtues which were beneficial for the individual. This individualism extended to the Church dismissing the idea of a &quot;Satanic Community&quot; and the sharing of membership lists with its members (at least under High Priest Peter H. Gilmore), arguing that as &quot;radical individualists&quot;, church members &quot;may share very little in common beyond&quot; beyond their Satanism.

Similarly, LaVey criticized the negative and restrictive attitude to sexuality present in many religions, instead supporting any sexual acts that take place between consenting adults. His Church welcomed homosexual members from its earliest years, and he also endorsed celibacy for those who were asexual. He sought to discourage negative feelings of guilt arising from sexual acts such as masturbation and fetishes, and believed that rejecting these sexual inhibitions and guilt would result in a happier and healthier society. Discussing women, LaVey argued that they should use sex as a tool to manipulate men, in order to advance their own personal power. Conversely, non-consensual sexual relations, such as rape and child molestation, were denounced by LaVey and his Church.

====Vision of the future====
LaVey believed that Christianity would soon wither away and society would enter an Age of Satan, in which a generation living in accordance with LaVeyan principles would come to power.
LaVey supported eugenics and expected it to become a necessity in the future, when it would be used to breed an elite who reflected LaVey&#x27;s &quot;Satanic&quot; principles. In his view, this elite would be &quot;superior people&quot; who displayed the &quot;Satanic&quot; qualities of creativity and nonconformity. He regarded these traits as capable of hereditary transmission, and made the claim that &quot;Satanists are born, not made&quot;. He believed that the elite should be siphoned off from the rest of the human &quot;herd&quot;, with the latter being forced into ghettoes, ideally &quot;space ghettoes&quot; located on other planets.
The anthropologist Jean La Fontaine highlighted an article that appeared in a LaVeyan magazine, &quot;The Black Flame&quot;, in which one writer described &quot;a true Satanic society&quot; as one in which the population consists of &quot;free-spirited, well-armed, fully-conscious, self-disciplined individuals, who will neither need nor tolerate any external entity &#x27;protecting&#x27; them or telling them what they can and cannot do.&quot; This rebellious approach conflicts with LaVey&#x27;s firm beliefs in observing the rule of law.

===Magic===


Although LaVey&#x27;s ideas suggest a secular and scientific world-view, he also expressed a belief in magic. Rather than characterising magic as a supernatural phenomenon, LaVey portrayed it as part of the natural world but appearing magical because it had not been discovered and explained by scientists. Outlined in &quot;The Satanic Bible&quot;, LaVey defined magic as &quot;the change in situations or events in accordance with one&#x27;s will, which would, using normally accepted methods, be unchangeable&quot;, a definition that reflects the influence of the British occultist Aleister Crowley. Although he never explained exactly how he believed that this magical process worked, LaVey stated that magicians could successfully utilise this magical force through intensely imagining their desired goal and thus directing the force of their own willpower toward it. He emphasised the idea that magical forces could be manipulated through &quot;purely emotional&quot; rather than intellectual acts.

Challenging LaVey insistence that the magic practiced in ceremonies in the church&#x27;s &quot;ritual chamber&quot;, was not supernatural but merely &quot;supernormal&quot;, Lucien Greaves, spokesperson for The Satanic Temple, a rival of the Church of Satan, argues LaVey&#x27;s beliefs about magic were &quot;artfully, and probably intentionally, unclear in his writings&quot;. 
 In a taped interview quoted by Taub and Nelson, LaVey explained that while they did not perform human blood sacrifices because the physical &quot;destruction of a human being ... is illegal&quot;, they did perform human sacrifices of enemies &quot;by proxy, you might say&quot;, using &quot;curses and hexes&quot;.

Joseph P. Laycock writes that LaVey described magic as &quot;a way of life&quot;, but was &quot;ambiguous&quot; about whether it was a &quot;shorthand for popular psychology&quot;, or whether there was some supernatural element in it.

This practice puts LaVeyan Satanism within a wider tradition of &#x27;high magic&#x27; or ceremonial magic, and has also been compared with Christian Science and Scientology. LaVey adopted beliefs and ideas from older magicians but consciously de-Christianised and Satanised them for his own purposes.
In presenting himself as applying a scientific perspective on magic, LaVey was likely influenced by Crowley, who had also presented his approach to magic in the same way. However, in contrast to many older ceremonial magicians, LaVey denied that there was any division between black magic and white magic, attributing this dichotomy purely to the &quot;smug hypocrisy and self-deceit&quot; of those who called themselves &quot;white magicians&quot;. He also differed from many older magicians who described magic as a means to bring about personal transformation and transcendence; for LaVey the goal of magic was instead material gain, personal influence, to harm enemies, and to gain success in love and sex.

LaVey divided his system of magic into greater and lesser magic. Greater magic being a form of ritual practice meant as psychodramatic catharsis to focus one&#x27;s emotional energy for a specific purpose. These rites are based on three major psycho-emotive themes: &quot;compassion&quot; (love), &quot;destruction&quot; (hate), and &quot;sex&quot; (lust). The space in which a ritual is performed is known as an &quot;intellectual decompression chamber&quot;, where skepticism and disbelief are willfully suspended, thus allowing the magicians to fully express their mental and emotional needs, holding back nothing regarding their deepest feelings and desires. This magic could then be employed to ensure sexual gratification, material gain, personal success, or to curse one&#x27;s enemies. LaVey also wrote of &quot;the balance factor&quot;, insisting that any magical aims should be realistic. These rituals are often considered to be magical acts, with LaVey&#x27;s Satanism encouraging the practice of magic to aid one&#x27;s selfish ends. Much of Satanic ritual is designed for an individual to carry out alone; this is because concentration is seen as key to performing magical acts.

Lesser magic, also referred to an &quot;everyday&quot; or &quot;situational&quot; magic, is the practice of manipulation by means of applied psychology. LaVey defined it as &quot;wile and guile obtained through various devices and contrived situations, which when utilized, can create change in accordance with one&#x27;s will.&quot; LaVey wrote that a key concept in lesser magic is the &quot;command to look&quot;, which can be accomplished by utilizing elements of &quot;sex, sentiment, and wonder&quot;, in addition to the utilization of looks, body language, scents, color, patterns, and odor. This system encourages a form of manipulative role-play, wherein the practitioner may alter several elements of their physical appearance in order to aid them in seducing or &quot;bewitching&quot; on object of desire.

LaVey developed &quot;The Synthesizer Clock&quot;, the purpose of which is to divide humans into distinct groups of people based primarily on body shape and personality traits. The synthesizer is modeled as a clock, and based on concepts of somatotypes. The clock is intended to aid a witch in identifying themselves, subsequently aiding in utilizing the &quot;attraction of opposites&quot; to &quot;spellbind&quot; the witch&#x27;s object of desire by assuming the opposite role. The successful application of lesser magic is said to be built upon one&#x27;s understanding of their place on the clock. Upon finding your position on the clock, you are encouraged to adapt it as seen fit, and perfect your type by harmonizing its element for better success. Dyrendal referred to LaVey&#x27;s techniques as &quot;Erving Goffman meets William Mortensen&quot;. Drawing insights from psychology, biology, and sociology, Petersen noted that lesser magic combines occult and &quot;rejected sciences of body analysis [and] temperaments.&quot;

==&quot;The Satanic Bible&quot;==
As a result of the success of the film &quot;Rosemary&#x27;s Baby&quot; and the concomitant growth of interest in Satanism, an editor at Avon Books, Peter Mayer, approached LaVey and commissioned him to write a book, which became &quot;The Satanic Bible&quot;. While part of the text was LaVey&#x27;s original writing, other sections of the book consisted of direct quotations from Arthur Desmond&#x27;s right-wing tract &quot;Might Is Right&quot; and the occultist Aleister Crowley&#x27;s version of John Dee&#x27;s &quot;Enochian Keys&quot;. There is evidence that LaVey was inspired by the writings of the American philosopher Ayn Rand; and while accusations that he plagiarized her work in &quot;The Satanic Bible&quot; have been denied by one author, Chris Mathews stated that &quot;LaVey stole selectively and edited lightly&quot; and that his &quot;Satanism at times closely parallels Ayn Rand&#x27;s Objectivist philosophy.&quot; The book &quot;The Satanic Bible&quot; served to present LaVey&#x27;s ideas to a far wider audience than they had previously had. In 1972, he published a sequel, &quot;The Satanic Rituals&quot;.

&quot;The Satanic Bible&quot; has been in print since 1969 and has been translated into various languages. Lewis argued that although LaVeyan Satanists do not treat &quot;The Satanic Bible&quot; as a sacred text in the way many other religious groups treat their holy texts, it nevertheless is &quot;treated as an authoritative document which effectively &quot;functions&quot; as scripture within the Satanic community&quot;. In particular, Lewis highlighted that many Satanists – both members of the Church of Satan and other groups – quote from it either to legitimize their own position or to de-legitimize the positions of others in a debate. Many other Satanist groups and individual Satanists who are not part of the Church of Satan also recognize LaVey&#x27;s work as influential.

Many Satanists attribute their conversions or discoveries of Satanism to &quot;The Satanic Bible&quot;, with 20 percent of respondents to a survey by James Lewis mentioning &quot;The Satanic Bible&quot; directly as influencing their conversion. For members of the church, the book is said to serve not only as a compendium of ideas but also to judge the authenticity of someone&#x27;s claim to be a Satanist. LaVey&#x27;s writings have been described as &quot;cornerstones&quot; within the church and its teachings, and have been supplemented with the writings of its later High Priest, Gilmore, namely his book, &quot;The Satanic Scriptures&quot;.

&quot;The Satanic Bible&quot; has been described as the most important document to influence contemporary Satanism. The book contains the core principles of Satanism, and is considered the foundation of its philosophy and dogma. On their website, the Church of Satan urge anyone seeking to learn about LaVeyan Satanism to read &quot;The Satanic Bible&quot;, stating that doing so is &quot;tantamount to understanding at least the basics of Satanism&quot;. Petersen noted that it is &quot;in many ways &quot;the&quot; central text of the Satanic milieu&quot;, with Lap similarly testifying to its dominant position within the wider Satanic movement. David G. Bromley calls it &quot;iconoclastic&quot; and &quot;the best-known and most influential statement of Satanic theology.&quot; Eugene V. Gallagher says that Satanists use LaVey&#x27;s writings &quot;as lenses through which they view themselves, their group, and the cosmos.&quot; He also states: &quot;With a clear-eyed appreciation of true human nature, a love of ritual and pageantry, and a flair for mockery, LaVey&#x27;s &quot;Satanic Bible&quot; promulgated a gospel of self-indulgence that, he argued, anyone who dispassionately considered the facts would embrace.&quot;

The &quot;central convictions&quot; of LaVeyan Satanism are formulated into three lists, which are regularly reproduced within the Church of Satan&#x27;s written material.

==Statements of basic tenets==
===The Nine Satanic Statements===

&quot;The Nine Satanic Statements&quot; are a set of nine assertions made by LaVey in the introductory chapters of &quot;The Satanic Bible&quot;. They are considered a touchstone of contemporary organized Satanism that constitute, in effect, brief aphorisms that capture Satanic philosophy. The first three statements touch on &quot;indulgence&quot;, &quot;vital existence&quot; and &quot;undefiled wisdom&quot; which presents a positive view of the Satanist as a carnal, physical and pragmatic being, where enjoyment of physical existence and an undiluted view of this-worldly truth are promoted as the core values of Satanism, combining elements of Darwinism and Epicureanism. Statement four, five and six deal in matters of ethics, through &quot;kindness to those who deserve it&quot;, &quot;vengeance&quot; and &quot;responsibility to the responsible&quot;, painting a harsh picture of society and human relations by emphasizing justice rather than love. Statements seven, eight and nine reject the dignity of man, sin and the Christian church. Humans are characterized as &quot;just another animal&quot;, traditional &quot;sins&quot; are promoted as means for gratification, and religion as mere business. The adversarial and antinomian aspect of Satan takes precedence in support of statements four through nine, with non-conformity being presented as a core ideal.

# Satan represents indulgence instead of abstinence.
# Satan represents vital existence instead of spiritual pipe dreams.
# Satan represents undefiled wisdom instead of hypocritical self-deceit.
# Satan represents kindness to those who deserve it, instead of love wasted on ingrates.
# Satan represents vengeance instead of turning the other cheek.
# Satan represents responsibility to the responsible instead of concern for psychic vampires.
# Satan represents man as just another animal who, because of his &quot;divine spiritual and intellectual development&quot;, has become the most vicious animal of all.
# Satan represents all of the so-called sins, as they all lead to physical, mental, or emotional gratification.
# Satan has been the best friend the Church has ever had, as he has kept it in business all these years.

===The Eleven Satanic Rules of the Earth===
# Do not give opinions or advice unless you are asked.
# Do not tell your troubles to others unless you are sure they want to hear them.
# When in another&#x27;s home, show them respect or else do not go there.
# If a guest in your home annoys you, treat them cruelly and without mercy.
# Do not make sexual advances unless you are given the mating signal.
# Do not take that which does not belong to you unless it is a burden to the other person and they cry out to be relieved.
# Acknowledge the power of magic if you have employed it successfully to obtain your desires. If you deny the power of magic after having called upon it with success, you will lose all you have obtained.
# Do not complain about anything to which you need not subject yourself.
# Do not harm little children.
# Do not kill non-human animals unless you are attacked or for your food.
# When walking in open territory, bother no one. If someone bothers you, ask him to stop. If he does not stop, destroy him.

===The Nine Satanic Sins===
These sins, published by LaVey in 1987, outline characteristics Satanists should avoid:

# Stupidity
# Pretentiousness 
# Solipsism
# Self-deceit
# Herd Conformity
# Lack of Perspective
# Forgetfulness of Past Orthodoxies
# Counterproductive Pride
# Lack of Aesthetics

===Pentagonal Revisionism===
Pentagonal Revisionism is a plan consisting of five major goals written in 1988 by LaVey:
# Stratification – &quot;There can be no more myth of &quot;equality&quot; for all—it only translates to &quot;mediocrity&quot; and supports the weak at the expense of the strong. Water must be allowed to seek its own level without interference from apologists for incompetence. No one should be protected from the effects of his own stupidity.&quot;
# Strict taxation of all churches – &quot;The productive, the creative, the resourceful should be subsidized. So long as the useless and incompetent are getting paid, they should be heavily taxed.&quot;
# No tolerance for religious beliefs secularized and incorporated into law and order issues – &quot;Amnesty should be considered for anyone in prison because of their alleged &#x27;influence&#x27; upon the actual perpetrator of the crime. Everyone is influenced in what he or she does. Scapegoating has become a way of life, a means of survival for the unfit. As an extension of the Judeo-Christian cop-out of blaming the Devil for everything, criminals can gain leniency, even praise, by placing the blame on a convenient villain. Following the Satanic creed of &quot;Responsibility to the responsible&quot;, in a Satanic society, everyone must experience the consequences of their own actions—for good or ill.&quot;
# Development and production of artificial human companions – &quot;An economic &#x27;godsend&#x27; which will allow everyone &quot;power&quot; over someone else. Polite, sophisticated, technologically feasible slavery. And the most profitable industry since T.V. and the computer.&quot;
# The opportunity for anyone to live within a total environment of their choice, with mandatory adherence to the aesthetic and behavioral standards of same – &quot;Privately owned, operated and controlled environments as an alternative to homogenized and polyglot ones. The freedom to insularize oneself within a social milieu of personal well-being. An opportunity to feel, see, and hear that which is most aesthetically pleasing, without interference from those who would pollute or detract from that option.&quot;

==Differences with other Satanists==
LaVeyan Satanism is &quot;rational&quot;, without belief in a supernatural Satan, in stark contrast to the &quot;Esoteric Satanism&quot; or &quot;Theistic Satanism&quot; of groups like the Temple of Set, and Joy of Satan Ministries. Not all rational Satanists follow LaVey. The Satanic Temple (TST) was founded in 2013 as a reaction to the &quot;culture war&quot; (particularly in the United States) over abortion, gun politics, separation of church and state, privacy, recreational drug use, homosexuality, censorship, and the political success of the shrinking population (in recent decades) of traditionalists and conservatives. Reportedly the &quot;most prominent&quot; Satanic organization &quot;in terms of both size and public activity&quot; (as of late 2023), the growth of the Temple has been explained by increasing interest among secular non-theists in &quot;left-wing&quot; social activism against Christian conservative power and in favor of separation of church and state, reproductive rights, and transgender rights, that has come at the expense of ignoring the LaVeyan focus on &quot;getting what you want for yourself&quot; selfishness and elitism.

==Relations with non-Satanists==
For a number of reasons LaVey&#x27;s Satanism achieved &quot;a measure of social legitimization&quot; and established for themselves an image as a &quot;legitimate, conventional, and nonthreatening religious entity&quot;, at least in the United States (according to researchers Taub and Nelson). As &quot;establishment&quot; Satanists they are hedonistic and self-centered, but are not sanctioned by the law provided they appear to be operating within the law.

Mainstream modern society has lost belief in the supernatural and so &quot;find it difficult to take seriously&quot; those who in an earlier era might have been burned at the stake.

Their members are &quot;predominantly&quot; between 25 and 50 years old, white, middle-class, include some professionals, and so are not that different from mainstream members of society &quot;as might be supposed&quot;. Unlike some Satanic cults such as Process Church of the Final Judgment, Church of Satan members adhere to relatively conventional lifestyles and behavior, avoiding drugs and excessive alcohol, dressing conventionally. The church also screens membership applications to exclude &quot;sensation seekers&quot; and prison inmates.

===Hypocrisy===
LaVey claims that Satanism is more realistic about human nature and behavior than other religions; more forthright in their values and activities, such as materialism and extramarital sex, than non-satanic religious hypocrites; that traditional religious structure no longer provides many individuals &quot;with the social imperatives of meaning and motivation.&quot; Consequently (LaVey insists), Satanism is only the &quot;logical culmination of American culture&#x27;s spiritual trend&quot;.

==Questions about seriousness==
Anton LaVey has been called a &quot;marketing genius&quot; and described as being motivated more by showmanship and entrepreneurship than any religious/philosophical vision.
He &quot;often spoke in terms of &#x27;conning the rubes,&#x27;&quot; and admitted that he lied &quot;constantly, incessantly.&quot;

According to one CoS priest (and journalist) Gavin Baddeley, LaVey&#x27;s satanism was &quot;a bizarre beast, sustained by a web of conflicting values and concepts&quot;, including &quot;a love of life garbed in the symbols of death and fear.&quot; Baddeley complained that LaVey pontificated the sacred importance of personal freedom, but as leader of the Church
&quot;micromanaged the lives of his followers&quot;.

Other contradictions in his thought have been explained by his wanting it to have as wide appeal as possible.
He reportedly frequently referred to an axiom he called &quot;a Satanic magical formula&quot;, which was to balance &quot;nine parts&quot; of &quot;respectability&quot; to &quot;one part&quot; of &quot;outrageousness&quot;. Satanism requiring some outrageous/anti-social elements if it was to be Satanic, but not so much as to frighten off potential congregants and attract unwanted attention if it was to be a viable organization.

One &quot;outrageous&quot; issue for which LaVey was criticized was his &quot;ambivalent relationship&quot; with far right figures and groups such as Robert Shelton of the United Klans of America, James Madole (1927–79) of the white supremacist National Renaissance Party, and the American Nazi Party. LaVey neither endorsed nor rejected any of these people or groups.
This earned him the criticism of 1971 &quot;Newsweek&quot; magazine (&quot;If there is anything fundamentally diabolic about LaVey, it stems more from the echoes of Nazism in his theories than from the horror-comic trappings of his cult&quot;), and religious studies scholar Joseph P. Laycock, who thought LaVey likely found &quot;the idea of totalitarianism romantic&quot;, the Nazi aesthetic cool, and the &quot;hinting at Nazi sympathies&quot; a way to keep his image &quot;suitably sinister&quot;.

==Rites and practices==

===Rites and ceremonies===
LaVey emphasized that in his tradition, Satanic rites came in two forms, neither of which were acts of worship; in his terminology, &quot;rituals&quot; were intended to bring about change, whereas &quot;ceremonies&quot; celebrated a particular occasion. These rituals were often considered to be magical acts, with LaVey&#x27;s Satanism encouraging the practice of magic to aid one&#x27;s selfish ends. Much of LaVeyan ritual is designed for an individual to carry out alone; this is because concentration is seen as key to performing magical acts. In &quot;The Satanic Bible&quot;, LaVey described three types of ritual in his religion: sex rituals designed to attract the desired romantic or sexual partner, compassionate rituals with the intent of helping people (including oneself), and destructive magic which seeks to do harm to others. In designing these rituals, LaVey drew upon a variety of older sources, with scholar of Satanism Per Faxneld noting that LaVey &quot;assembled rituals from a hodgepodge of historical sources, literary as well as esoteric&quot;.

LaVey described a number of rituals in his book, &quot;The Satanic Rituals&quot;; these are &quot;dramatic performances&quot; with specific instructions surrounding the clothing to be worn, the music to be used, and the actions to be taken. This attention to detail in the design of the rituals was intentional, with their pageantry and theatricality intending to engage the participants&#x27; senses and aesthetic sensibilities at various levels and enhancing the participants&#x27; willpower for magical ends. LaVey prescribed that male participants should wear black robes, while older women should wear black, and other women should dress attractively in order to stimulate sexual feelings among many of the men. All participants are instructed to wear amulets of either the upturned pentagram or the image of Baphomet.

According to LaVey&#x27;s instructions, on the altar is to be placed an image of Baphomet. This should be accompanied by various candles, all but one of which are to be black. The lone exception is to be a white candle, used in destructive magic, which is kept to the right of the altar. Also to be included are a bell which is rung nine times at the start and end of the ceremony, a chalice made of anything but gold, and which contains an alcoholic drink symbolizing the &quot;Elixir of Life&quot;, a sword that represents aggression, a model phallus used as an aspergillum, a gong, and parchment on which requests to Satan are to be written before being burned. Although alcohol was consumed in the church&#x27;s rites, drunkenness was frowned upon and the taking of illicit drugs was forbidden.

LaVeyan rituals sometimes include anti-Christian blasphemies, which are intended to have a liberating effect on the participants.
In some of the rituals, a naked woman serves as the altar; in these cases it is made explicit that the woman&#x27;s body itself becomes the altar, rather than have her simply lying on an existing altar. In contrast to longstanding stereotypes about Satanists, there is no place for sexual orgies in LaVeyan ritual. Neither animal nor human sacrifice takes place. Children are banned from attending these rituals, with the only exception being the Satanic Baptism, which is specifically designed to involve infants.

LaVey also developed his own Black Mass, which was designed as a form of deconditioning to free the participant from any inhibitions that they developed living in Christian society. He noted that in composing the Black Mass rite, he had drawn upon the work of the French fiction writers Charles Baudelaire and Joris-Karl Huysmans. LaVey openly toyed with the use of literature and popular culture in other rituals and ceremonies, thus appealing to artifice, pageantry, and showmanship. For instance, he published an outline of a ritual which he termed the &quot;Call to Cthulhu&quot; which drew upon the stories of the alien god Cthulhu authored by American horror writer H. P. Lovecraft. In this rite, set to take place at night in a secluded location near to a turbulent body of water, a celebrant takes on the role of Cthulhu and appears before the assembled Satanists, signing a pact between them in the language of Lovecraft&#x27;s fictional &quot;Old Ones&quot;.

===Holidays===
In &quot;The Satanic Bible&quot;, LaVey writes that &quot;after one&#x27;s own birthday, the two major Satanic holidays are Walpurgisnacht and Halloween.&quot; Other holidays celebrated by members include the two solstices, the two equinoxes, and Yule.

===Symbolism===

As a symbol of his Satanic church, LaVey adopted the upturned five-pointed pentagram. The upturned pentagram had previously been used by the French occultist Eliphas Lévi, and had been adopted by his disciple, Stanislas de Guaita, who merged it with a goat&#x27;s head in his 1897 book, &quot;Key of Black Magic&quot;. In the literature and imagery predating LaVey, imagery used to represent the &quot;satanic&quot; is denoted by inverted crosses and blasphemous parodies of Christian art. The familiar goat&#x27;s head inside an inverted pentagram did not become the foremost symbol of Satanism until the founding of the Church of Satan in 1966. LaVey learned of this variant of the symbol after it had been reproduced on the front cover of Maurice Bessy&#x27;s coffee table book, &quot;Pictorial History of Magic and the Supernatural&quot;. Feeling that this symbol embodied his philosophy, LaVey decided to adopt it for his Church. In its formative years, the church utilized this image on its membership cards, stationery, medallions and most notably above the altar in the ritual chamber of the Black House.

During the writing of &quot;The Satanic Bible&quot;, it was decided that a unique version of the symbol should be rendered to be identified exclusively with the church. LaVey created a new version of Guaita&#x27;s image, one which was geometrically precise, with two perfect circles surrounding the pentagram, the goat head redrawn, and the Hebrew lettering altered to look more serpentine. LaVey had this design copyrighted to the church, claiming authorship under the pseudonym of &quot;Hugo Zorilla&quot;. In doing so, the symbol – which came to be known as the Sigil of Baphomet – came to be closely associated with Satanism in the public imagination.

==History==

===Origins: 1966–72===
Although there were forms of religious Satanism that predated the creation of LaVeyan Satanism—namely those propounded by Stanisław Przybyszewski and Ben Kadosh—these had no unbroken lineage of succession to LaVey&#x27;s form. For this reason, the sociologist of religion Massimo Introvigne stated that &quot;with few exceptions, LaVey is at the origins of all contemporary Satanism&quot;. Similarly, the historian Ruben van Luijk claimed that the creation of LaVeyan Satanism marked &quot;the actual beginning of Satanism as a religion such as it is practiced in the world today&quot;.

After he came to public attention, LaVey shielded much of his early life in secrecy, and little is known about it for certain. He had been born in Chicago as Howard Stanton Levey in either March or April 1930. He was of mixed Ukrainian, Russian, and German ancestry. He claimed to have worked in the circus and carnival in the years following the Second World War, and in later years, he also alleged that he worked at the San Francisco Orchestra, although this never existed. He also claimed to have had a relationship with a young Marilyn Monroe, although this too was untrue.

By the 1960s he was living at 6114 California Street in San Francisco, a house that he had inherited from his parents. He took an interest in occultism and amassed a large collection of books on the subject. At some point between 1957 and 1960 he began hosting classes at his house every Friday in which lectures on occultism and other subjects were given. Among the topics covered were freaks, extra-sensory perception, Spiritualism, cannibalism, and historical methods of torture. Attendees of these lectures coalesced into an informal group which came to be known as the Magic Circle. Among those affiliated with this gathering were the filmmaker and Thelemite occultist Kenneth Anger, and the anthropologist Michael Harner, who later established the core shamanism movement.

LaVey likely began preparations for the formation of his Church of Satan in either 1965 or early 1966, and it was officially founded on Walpurgisnacht 1966. He then declared that 1966 marked Year One of the new Satanic era. It was the first organized church in modern times to be devoted to the figure of Satan, and according to Faxneld and Petersen, the church represented &quot;the first public, highly visible, and long-lasting organisation which propounded a coherent satanic discourse&quot;. Its early members were the attendees of LaVey&#x27;s Magic Circle, although it soon began attracting new recruits. Many of these individuals were sadomasochists or homosexuals, attracted by the LaVeyan openness to different sexual practices. LaVey had painted his house black, with it becoming known as &quot;the Black House&quot;, and it was here that weekly rituals were held every Friday night.

LaVey played up to his Satanic associations by growing a pointed beard and wearing a black cloak and inverted pentagram. He added to his eccentric persona by obtaining unusual pets, including a lion that was kept caged in his back garden. Describing himself as the &quot;High Priest of Satan&quot;, LaVey defined his position within the church as &quot;monarchical in nature, papal in degree and absolute in power&quot;. He led the churches&#x27; governing Council of Nine, and implemented a system of five initiatory levels that the LaVeyan Satanist could advance through by demonstrating their knowledge of LaVeyan philosophy and their personal accomplishments in life. These were known as Apprentice Satanist I°, Witch or Warlock II°, Priest or Priestess of Mendes III°, Magister IV°, and Magus V°.

The church experienced its &quot;golden age&quot; from 1966 to 1972, when it had a strong media presence. In February 1967, LaVey held a much publicized Satanic wedding, which was followed by the Satanic baptism of his daughter Zeena in May, and then a Satanic funeral in December. Another publicity-attracting event was the &quot;Topless Witch Revue&quot;, a nightclub show held on San Francisco&#x27;s North Beach; the use of topless women to attract attention alienated a number of the church&#x27;s early members. Through these and other activities, he soon attracted international media attention, being dubbed &quot;the Black Pope&quot;. He also attracted a number of celebrities to join his Church, most notably Sammy Davis Junior and Jayne Mansfield. LaVey also established branches of the church, known as &quot;grottos&quot;, in various parts of the United States. He may have chosen the term &quot;grotto&quot; over &quot;coven&quot; because the latter term had come to be used by practitioners of the modern Pagan religion of Wicca. These included the Babylon Grotto in Detroit, the Stygian Grotto in Dayton, and the Lilith Grotto in New York City. In 1971, a Dutch follower of LaVey&#x27;s, Maarten Lamers, established his own Kerk van Satan grotto in Amsterdam.

Following the success of the film &quot;Rosemary&#x27;s Baby&quot;, LaVey wrote the book &quot;The Satanic Bible&quot;, borrowing from Arthur Desmond, Aleister Crowley and Ayn Rand. &quot;The Satanic Bible&quot; spread LaVey&#x27;s ideas to a wide audience, and led to a 1972 sequel, &quot;The Satanic Rituals&quot;.

LaVey&#x27;s Church emerged at a point in American history when Christianity was on the decline as many of the nation&#x27;s youth broke away from their parental faith and explored alternative systems of religiosity. The milieu in which LaVey&#x27;s Church was operating was dominated by the counterculture of the 1960s; his Church reflected some of its concerns – free love, alternative religions, freedom from church and state – but ran contrary to some of the counterculture&#x27;s other main themes, such as peace and love, compassion, and the use of mind-altering drugs. He expressed condemnation of the hippies; in one ritual he hung an image of Timothy Leary upside down while stamping on a tablet of LSD.

===Later development: 1972–present===

LaVey ceased conducting group rituals and workshops in his home in 1972.
In 1973, church leaders in Michigan, Ohio, and Florida split to form their own Church of Satanic Brotherhood, however this disbanded in 1974 when one of its founders publicly converted to Christianity. Subsequently, Church members based in Kentucky and Indiana left to found the Ordo Templi Satanis. In 1975, LaVey disbanded all grottos, leaving the organisation as a membership-based group that existed largely on paper. He claimed that this had been necessary because the grottos had come to be dominated by social misfits who had not benefitted the church as a whole. In a private letter, he expressed frustration that despite growing church membership, &quot;brain surgeons and Congressmen are still in short supply&quot;. He also announced that thenceforth all higher degrees in the church would be awarded in exchange for contributions of cash, real estate, or valuable art. Dissatisfied with these actions, in 1975, the high-ranking Church member Michael Aquino left to found his own Satanic organisation, the Temple of Set, which differed from LaVey&#x27;s Church by adopting a belief that Satan literally existed. According to Lap, from this point on Satanism became a &quot;splintered and disorganized movement&quot;.

Between the abolition of the grotto system in 1975 and the establishment of the internet in the mid-1990s, &quot;The Satanic Bible&quot; remained the primary means of propagating Satanism. During this period, a decentralized, anarchistic movement of Satanists developed that was shaped by many of the central themes that had pervaded LaVey&#x27;s thought and which was expressed in &quot;The Satanic Bible&quot;. Lewis argued that in this community, &quot;The Satanic Bible&quot; served as a &quot;quasi-scripture&quot; because these independent Satanists were able to adopt certain ideas from the book while merging them with ideas and practices drawn from elsewhere.

During the late 1980s, LaVey returned to the limelight, giving media interviews, attracting further celebrities, and reinstating the grotto system. In 1984 he separated from his wife, Diane Hegarty, and began a relationship with Blanche Barton, who was his personal assistant. In 1988 Hegarty brought a court case against LaVey, claiming that he she owned half of the church and LaVey&#x27;s Black House. The court found in Hegarty&#x27;s favour, after which LaVey immediately declared bankruptcy. In May 1992, the ex-couple reached a settlement. The Black House was sold to a wealthy friend, the property developer Donald Werby, who agreed to allow LaVey to continue living at the residence for free. Also in 1992, LaVey published his first book in twenty years, &quot;The Devil&#x27;s Notebook&quot;. This was followed by the posthumous &quot;Satan Speaks&quot; in 1998, which included a foreword from the rock singer Marilyn Manson, who was an honorary priest in the church.

In his final years, LaVey suffered from a heart condition, displayed increasing paranoia, and died in October 1997. In November, the church announced that it would subsequently be run by two High Priestesses of joint rank, Barton and LaVey&#x27;s daughter Karla LaVey. That same year, the church established an official website. Barton attempted to purchase the Black House from Werby, but was unable to raise sufficient funds; the building had fallen into disrepair and was demolished in 2001, subsequently being replaced with an apartment block. A disagreement subsequently emerged between Barton and Karla, resulting in an agreement that Barton would retain legal ownership of the name and organization of the church while LaVey&#x27;s personal belongings and copyrights would be distributed among his three children, Karla, Zeena, and Satan Xerxes. Barton stood down as High Priestess in 2002, although continued to chair the church&#x27;s Council of Nine. The headquarters of the church were then moved from San Francisco to New York, where Peter H. Gilmore was appointed the church&#x27;s High Priest, and his wife Peggy Nadramia as its High Priestess.

After LaVey&#x27;s death, conflict over the nature of Satanism intensified within the Satanic community. At Halloween 1999 Karla established the First Satanic Church, which uses its website to promote the idea that it represents a direct continuation of the original Church of Satan as founded by Anton LaVey. Other LaVeyan groups appeared elsewhere in the United States. An early member of the Church of Satan, John Dewey Allee, established his own First Church of Satan, claiming allegiance to LaVey&#x27;s original teachings and professing that LaVey himself had deviated from them in later life. In 1986, Paul Douglas Valentine founded the New York City-based World Church of Satanic Liberation, having recruited many of its members through Herman Slater&#x27;s Magickal Childe esoteric store. Its membership remained small and it was discontinued in 2011. In 1991, the Embassy of Lucifer was established by the Canadian Tsirk Susuej, which was influenced by LaVeyan teachings but held that Satan was a real entity. Splinter groups from Susuej&#x27;s organisation included the Embassy of Satan in Stewart, British Columbia, and the Luciferian Light Group in Baltimore.

LaVeyan groups also cropped up elsewhere in the world, with a particular concentration in Scandinavia; most of these Scandinavian groups either split from the Church of Satan or never affiliated with it. These included the Svenska Satanistkyrkan and the Det Norske Sataniske Samfunn, as well as the Prometheus Grotten of the Church of Satan which was established in Denmark in 1997 but which officially seceded in 2000. A Satanic Church was also established in Estonia based on the LaVeyan model; it later renamed itself the Order of the Black Widow.

The Church of Satan became increasingly doctrinally-rigid and focused on maintaining the purity of LaVeyan Satanism. The church&#x27;s increased emphasis on their role as the bearer of LaVey&#x27;s legacy was partly a response to the growth in non-LaVeyan Satanists. Some Church members – including Gilmore – claimed that only they were the &quot;real&quot; Satanists and that those belonging to different Satanic traditions were &quot;pseudo&quot; Satanists. After examining many of these claims on the church&#x27;s website, Lewis concluded that it was &quot;&quot;obsessed&quot; with shoring up its own legitimacy by attacking the heretics, especially those who criticize LaVey&quot;. Meanwhile, the church experienced an exodus of its membership in the 2000s, with many of these individuals establishing new groups online. Although the church&#x27;s public face had performed little ceremonial activity since the early 1970s, in June 2006 they held a Satanic &#x27;High Mass&#x27; in Los Angeles to mark the church&#x27;s fortieth birthday.

==Demographics==

Membership levels of the Church of Satan are hard to determine, as the organisation has not released such information. During its early years, the church claimed a membership of around 10,000, although defectors subsequently claimed that the number was only in the hundreds. Membership was largely, although not exclusively, white. LaVey recognised this, suggesting that the church appealed particularly to white Americans because they lacked the strong sense of ethnic identity displayed by African-Americans and Hispanic Americans. The historian of religion Massimo Introvigne suggested that it had never had more than 1000 or 2000 members at its height, but that LaVeyan ideas had had a far greater influence through LaVey&#x27;s books. Membership is gained by paying $225 and filling out a registration statement, and thus initiates are bestowed with lifetime memberships and not charged annual fees.

La Fontaine thought it likely that the easy availability of LaVey&#x27;s writings would have encouraged the creation of various Satanic groups that were independent of the Church of Satan itself. In &quot;The Black Flame&quot;, a number of groups affiliated with the church has been mentioned, most of which are based in the United States and Canada although two groups were cited as having existed in New Zealand. In his 2001 examination of Satanists, the sociologist James R. Lewis noted that, to his surprise, his findings &quot;consistently pointed to the centrality of LaVey&#x27;s influence on modern Satanism&quot;. &quot;Reflecting the dominant influence of Anton LaVey&#x27;s thought&quot;, Lewis noted that the majority of those whom he examined were atheists or agnostics, with 60% of respondents viewing Satanism as a symbol rather than a real entity. 20% of his respondents described &quot;The Satanic Bible&quot; as the most important factor that attracted them to Satanism. Elsewhere, Lewis noted that few Satanists who were not members of the Church of Satan would regard themselves as &quot;orthodox LaVeyans&quot;.
Examining the number of LaVeyan Satanists in Britain, in 1995 the religious studies scholar Graham Harvey wrote that the Church of Satan had no organized presence in the country. He noted that LaVey&#x27;s writings were widely accessible in British bookshops, and La Fontaine suggested that there may have been individual Church members within the country.

<text>Paasselkä (earlier &quot;Paasivesi&quot;, both names roughly mean &#x27;Stone lake&#x27;) is an oval-shaped lake formed in an eroded impact crater in Southern Savonia, Finland. The lake, which is a part of Orivesi, which is in turn part of the Greater Saimaa, is devoid of islands which makes it different from other lakes in the region. Paasselkä is also unusually deep, 75 m at the deepest point.

The Paasselkä impact occurred roughly &lt;1800 million years ago (Statherian period of the Paleoproterozoic) and affected Paleoproterozoic crystalline rocks and some overlying sandstones of the Baltic Shield. Because of the unusual shape and associated magnetic anomalies, Paasselkä was suspected to have an impact origin long until it was confirmed after a deep drilling in 1999 making it the ninth known impact crater in Finland. Unlike many Finnish craters, it does not seem to have been buried under layers of sediment.
==Light phenomenon==

Paasselän pirut, or Paasselkä devils, is a claimed will-o&#x27;-the-wisp phenomenon which sometimes occurs at the lake and the marsh and forest area in the immediate vicinity. One has described the light as a ball that moves at different speeds, or are completely at rest, and sometimes there are several spheres. The phenomenon has been known for a long time, written down from the 18th century, and is part of the local folk tales, which have given the name &quot;devils&quot;. The locals thought the shining spheres were created by evil beings. The magnetic anomalies in connection with the impact crater might be related to the phenomenon.

<text>Spanish Guinea () was a set of insular and continental territories controlled by Spain from 1778 in the Gulf of Guinea and on the Bight of Bonny, in Central Africa. It gained independence in 1968 as Equatorial Guinea.

==History==
===18th–19th centuries===
The Spanish colony in the Guinea region was established in 1778, by the Treaty of El Pardo between the Spanish Empire and the Portuguese Empire. Between 1778 and 1810, Spain administered the territory of Equatorial Guinea via its colonial Viceroyalty of the Río de la Plata, based in Buenos Aires (in present-day Argentina).

From 1827 to 1843, the United Kingdom had a base on Bioko to combat the continuing Atlantic slave trade conducted by Spain and illegal traders. Based on an agreement with Spain in 1843, Britain moved its base to its own colony of Sierra Leone in West Africa. In 1844, on restoration of Spanish rule, it became known as the &quot;Territorios Españoles del Golfo de Guinea&quot;.

===20th century===

Spain had never undertaken colonial settlement of the large area in the Bight of Biafra to which it had treaty rights. The French expanded their occupation at the expense of the area claimed by Spain. By the treaty of Paris in 1900, Spain was left with the continental enclave of Río Muni, 26,000 km2 of the 300,000 stretching east to the Ubangi river, which the Spaniards had previously claimed.

===Agricultural economy===
Toward the end of the 19th century Spanish, Portuguese, German and Fernandino planters started developing large cacao plantations on the island of Fernando Po. With the indigenous Bubi population decimated by disease and forced labour, the island&#x27;s economy came to depend on imported agricultural contract workers.

A labour treaty was signed with the Republic of Liberia in 1914; the transport of up to 15,000 workers by sea was orchestrated by the German Woermann-Linie, the major shipping company. In 1930 an International Labour Organization (ILO) commission discovered that Liberian contract workers had &quot;been recruited under conditions of criminal compulsion scarcely distinguishable from slave raiding and slave trading&quot;. The government prohibited recruiting of Liberian workers for Spanish Guinea.

The persisting labour shortage in the cacao, coffee and logging industries led to a booming trade in illegal canoe-based smuggling of Igbo and Ibibio workers from the Eastern Provinces of Nigeria. The number of clandestine contract workers on the island of Fernando Po grew to 20,000 in 1942. A labour treaty was signed with the British Crown in the same year. This led to a continuous stream of Nigerian workers going to Spanish Guinea. By 1968 at the time of independence, almost 100,000 ethnic Nigerians were living and working in Spanish Guinea.

====Colony of Spanish Guinea====


Between 1926 and 1959, the Crown united Bioko and Río Muni as the &quot;colony of Spanish Guinea&quot;. The economy was based on the exploitation of the commodity crops of cacao and coffee, produced at large plantations, in addition to logging concessions. Owners of these companies hired mostly immigrant contract labour from Liberia, Nigeria, and Cameroon. Spain mounted military campaigns in the 1920s to subdue the indigenous Fang people, as Liberia was trying to reduce recruiting of its workers. The Crown established garrisons of the Colonial Guard throughout the enclave by 1926, and the whole colony was considered &#x27;pacified&#x27; by 1929.

Río Muni had a small population, officially put at a little over 100,000 in the 1930s. Its people could easily escape over the borders into Cameroon or Gabon. Moreover, the timber companies needed growing amounts of labour, and the spread of coffee cultivation offered an alternative means of paying taxes.

The island of Fernando Po continued to suffer from labour shortages. The French only briefly permitted recruitment in Cameroon. Planters began to recruit Igbo laborers, who were smuggled in canoes from Calabar, Nigeria. Fernando Po was developed after the Second World War as one of Africa&#x27;s most productive agricultural areas.

====Decolonisation====
The post-war political history of Spanish Guinea had three fairly distinct phases. From 1946 to 1959, it had the status of a &quot;province&quot;, having been raised from &quot;colony&quot;, after the Portuguese Empire made overtures to take it over. From 1960 to 1968, Spain tried a system of partial decolonisation to keep the province within the Spanish territorial system, which failed due to continued anti-colonial activity by Guineans. On 12 October 1968, Spain conceded the independence of the Republic of Equatorial Guinea. Francisco Macías Nguema was elected as president.

==Colonial demographics==
The population of the Colony of Spanish Guinea was stratified (before slavery was abolished). The system was somewhat similar to the one operating in the French, English and Portuguese colonies in the rest of Africa:

#Peninsulares — White Spanish population, whose immigration was regulated by the Spanish government.
#Emancipados — Black African population, assimilated into the Peninsulares&#x27; culture via Spanish Catholic educations. Some were descended from freed Cuban slaves, repatriated to Africa after emancipation and abolition of slavery by the Spanish Royal Orders of 13 September 1845 (voluntary), and of 20 June 1861 (deported). The latter group included &quot;mestizos&quot; (indigenous-European) and &quot;mulattoes&quot; (African-European), mixed-race descendants who had been acknowledged by a white Peninsular father.
#Fernandinos — Creole peoples, multi-ethnic or multi-race populations, often speaking the local Pidgin English of Spanish Guinea&#x27;s island of Fernando Po (now known as Bioko).
#&quot;Individuals of colour&quot; under patronage — included the majority of the indigenous Black African people, and those mestizos−mulattoes who were not acknowledged by white fathers and were being deported from the Americas. Of the indigenous ethnic groups in Guinea, most were Bubi and Bantu peoples such as the Fang of Rio Muni. 
#Others — primarily Nigerian, Cameroonian, Han Chinese, and Indian peoples who were hired as contract laborers under types of indentures.

<text>Tomás Estrada Palma ( July 9, 1835 – November 4, 1908) was a Cuban politician, the president of The Republic of Cuba in Arms during the Ten Years&#x27; War, and the first President of Cuba, between May 20, 1902, and September 28, 1906.
His collateral career as a New York City area educator and writer enabled Estrada Palma to create pro-Cuban literature aimed at gaining sympathy, assistance and publicity. He was eventually successful in garnering the attention of influential Americans. He was an early and persistent voice calling for the United States to intervene in Cuba on humanitarian grounds. 
During his presidency his major accomplishments include improving Cuba&#x27;s infrastructure, communication, and public health.

==Personal and early life==
He was born in Bayamo, Spanish Cuba, July 9, 1835, to Dr. Andrés María Estrada y Oduardo and María Candelaria Palma Tamayo. His exact birth date is not known because of a fire in Bayamo Town Hall on January 19, 1869, that destroyed his birth records. An article in Bohemia magazine issued October 4, 1944 indicates that his baptism document, contained in his University of Havana file, shows of a birth date of July 6, 1832. His paternal grandfather was Dr. Manuel José de Estrada, well-known professional in the region of Cauto, Cuba (current-day Bayamo). He was given his name &quot;Tomás&quot; in honor of his maternal grandfather, Don Tomás de Palma, a rich landowner. What is known about his early life is his schooling in the private school of Toribio Hernández, Havana, and his attendance in the University of Havana in which he received a philosophy degree on July 19, 1854. He was taken out of the roster in the University of Seville on January 29 in 1857 for excessive absences. He withdrew on June 29, 1857, of the same year for personal reasons. On May 15, 1881, he married Genoveva Guardiola Arbizú (1854–1926), daughter of General José Santos Guardiola, President of Honduras, Estrada Palma and his wife had six children. He was regarded as a courteous man of a few words. It is also said that Estrada Palma had great tenacity.

==Early career==
From 1857 to 1868, he returned to Bayamo and became an administrator and a local teacher. He continued to teach in Honduras and Orange County, New York.

==War for independence==
Estrada Palma became the President of the Cuban Republic in Arms during the Ten Years&#x27; War.

Estrada Palma was captured by Spanish troops and sent into exile. While in exile, he traveled to New York City, where he worked with José Martí to gather political support for a political revolution in Cuba.

After Martí&#x27;s death, Estrada Palma became the new leader of the Cuban Junta. His role in the party was to be its chief representative. With that authorization, he was able to have diplomatic relations with other countries, including the US.

After the Government in Arms was established, it sent Estrada Palma to Washington, DC, as its diplomat. He was largely successful. Estrada Palma received assistance from various individuals including an American banker who attempted to offer Spain $150 million to give up the island.

Estrada Palma was also assisted by William Randolph Hearst&#x27;s newspapers to spread the cause of the Cuban Revolutionary Party by posting articles sympathetic to the Cuban revolutionaries. The newspapers assisted the revolutionaries in gaining materials, support, and popularity for the movement.

In a move that showed some real statesmanship and an ability to use media, Estrada Palma got the US Congress to pass a joint resolution on April 19, 1898. The resolution disavowed the Spanish colonization of Cuba and supported the independence of the Republic of Cuba. It also highlighted that the United States had no intention of occupying or annexing the island. (see Spanish–American War).

After the Spanish–American War, Estrada Palma dissolved one of the leading factions of the Cuban revolutionary armies: the Liberation Army, mostly black and rural. He gave more political power to the Assembly of Representatives, the allegedly more pragmatic white urban dwellers, neo-annexationists, and elitists.

He had effectively given power a chosen few of the former revolutionaries to achieve political dominance within Cuban politics. At the same time, he would attract US assistance in Cuba to rebuild the country.

==First term==
After a few years of General Leonard Wood&#x27;s rule in Cuba, elections were to be held on December 31, 1901. There were two political parties, the Republicans, who were conservative and wanted national autonomy, headed by José Miguel Gómez, and the National Liberals, who were a popular party that wanted Cuba to go toward local autonomy, headed by Alfredo Zayas. Both supported Estrada Palma. However, he did not campaign but instead remained in the United States, where he was a citizen.

Estrada Palma&#x27;s opponent, General Bartolomé Masó, withdrew his candidacy in protest against favoritism by the occupational government and the manipulation of the political machine by Estrada Palma&#x27;s followers. Thus, Estrada Palma was left as the only candidate.
On December 31, 1901, Estrada Palma was elected president.

To his credit, Estrada Palma did not want to have a presidency based on racial barriers. Like many other Cuban revolutionaries, he had seen the new nation as a nonracial republic in which Afro-Cubans would be equal to whites in society. Before his presidency, Estrada Palma assured that he would bring 100 public service jobs to Afro-Cubans and repeal American regulations that supported segregation in Cuba.

The Platt Amendment was signed on March 2, 1901. The amendment allowed the United States to interfere in the domestic policies of Cuba and to lease land for naval bases or coal stations.

American troops left after the Cuban government signed a bill lowering tariffs on American products and incorporated the Platt Amendment into its constitution. Many American companies came to do business in Cuba.

On February 16, 1903, Estrada Palma signed the Cuban-American Treaty of Relations, agreeing to lease the Guantanamo Bay area to the United States in perpetuity for use as a naval base and coaling station. That was a minor victory for the Estrada Palma administration for Washington had wanted five naval bases on the island. It is a testament to his diplomatic skills that Estrada Palma was able to obtain the reduction, even with American troops stationed in the island. His policies were also responsible for improvements in education, communications, and public health, which had suffered from the devastation created by the war. As an example, land prices between 1902 and 1905 went up and he built over 328 km of roads in Cuba.
In 1905 Palma formed the “Gabinete de Combate” or the “Fighting Cabinet” as the cabinet ministers consisted of all veterans who fought during the Cuban Wars of Independence. The principal figure in the new cabinet was General Fernando Freyde de Andrade, Secretary of the Government.

Estrada Palma paid much attention to public works especially as they related to improving the sanitary conditions of the country as well as expanding the means of communication throughout the island. Admittedly funds originally destined for educational buildings were at first reduced and later cut. Under his administration the number of immigrants increased from 10,000 in 1902 to 40,000 in 1905. Estrada Palma was regarded a fiscal conservative, preferring to keep any budget deficits at a minimum if possible. He is also credited for being one of the few Cuban Presidents for not significantly misusing public funds. By the time Estrada Palma left office it is said that the Cuban Treasury had a few million dollars at its disposable.
Estrada Palma summarized his budget plans through in one his statements “it is most imperative that the State has at its disposal secure and sufficient sources of revenue in order to cover, within a framework of prudent economic policies, the inevitable expenses of multiple departments within the public administration.”

==Second term==
Estrada Palma was re-elected unopposed in the 1905 Cuban general election, with his second term officially commencing May 20, 1906. This time, there was violent opposition by the liberals. Each side claimed electoral fraud had affected the outcome. One story being that The National Labor Party used &quot;el copo&quot;, fraud to prevent minority victory in the first election.

The main issue in the second election was the equal representation of the Cuban provinces. Critics of Estrada Palma such as General Faustino Guerra Puente accused him of ignoring the constitution. Still, other politicians and generals, possibly even including Guerra Puente himself, recognized Estrada Palma as the only person able to lead Cuba.

The response to the opponents Alfredo Zayas was to have the force of the police and the rural guard to allow Estrada Palma to claim victory. Estrada Palma and the moderate camp appealed to the US for intervention, and in 1906, the US began the Second Occupation of Cuba and installed a provisional occupation government, which lasted from 1906 to 1909. Another pro-American government was established in Cuba under Charles Magoon. Finally, on September 28, 1906, Estrada Palma, by then 71 years old, resigned along with the rest of the executive branch, leaving Cuba without a successor president. This choice of action allowed the United States to take control under the Platt Amendment.

President Palma&#x27;s resignation read as follows:
==Death==
Estrada Palma, an attorney, died in Santiago de Cuba at 11:45 p.m. on November 4, 1908, from pneumonia. He was temporarily residing in Calle Sagarra No. 17

===Descendants===

* Tomás Andrés Estrada-Palma Guardiola and Helen Douglas Browne continued the name. 
* Tomás Estrada Palma, with their first-born child, Tomás Douglas Estrada-Palma III, born on May 12, 1911, in New York. 
* Tomás Douglas Estrada-Palma III and Alyce Mae Carroll married and continued the name with their first-born child, Tomás Ramón Estrada-Palma IV, born in Miami. 
* Tomás Douglas Estrada-Palma III had three more children, Patrick Carroll Estrada-Palma, Candita Margaret Estrada-Palma, and Kathleen Riordan Estrada-Palma. 
* Estrada Palma&#x27;s name ends with Tomás Ramón Estrada-Palma IV since he decided to not continue the name with his children.

==Legacy==
Estrada Palma is known less for his accomplishments in education, revolution, and infrastructure than for being a part of the annexation agenda of and his subservience to the United States.

==Honors==
In 1903, a statue of Estrada Palma was erected in the Avenida de los Presidentes, in Havana. His statue was pulled down by Fidel Castro&#x27;s revolutionaries, reportedly because they blamed Estrada Palma for starting the trend of US interventions in Cuba. The plinth, with a pair of shoes, remains.

Estrada Palma spent many years of his US exile in the town of Woodbury in Orange County, New York. Along a road that now bears his name (Estrada Road, in the hamlet of Central Valley), he ran a summer camp, which has since been abandoned. During his presidency, Estrada Palma kept an &quot;T. Estrada Palma Fund&quot; to buy prizes for academic achievements in Orange County.

<doc id="780409" wikidata="Q2092091" url="?curid=780409" title="Piccaninny crater">
<text>Piccaninny crater is an impact structure, the eroded remnant of a former impact crater, situated in northern Western Australia in the Kimberley region. It was named after Piccaninny Creek and lies within the Purnululu (Bungle Bungle) National Park.

== Description ==
The site is marked by a circular topographic feature on top of the flat-topped sandstone and conglomerate Bungle Bungle Range, clearly visible on remotely sensed images. When first reported in 1983 after aerial observation, it was interpreted as either an impact structure or a cryptovolcanic feature. Later ground examination by E.M. and C.S. Shoemaker confirmed the presence of types of deformation confirming an impact origin.

The circular topographic feature is 7 km in diameter, although due to the amount of erosion the original crater may have been larger. It has been estimated that the present land surface is 1–2 km below the original crater floor. The impact event has not been dated, and must be younger than the Devonian age of the rocks in the area, but is clearly not recent because of the amount of erosion.

<text>Double default occurs in banking, when the obligor and the guarantor fail to meet their obligations.

A debt default known as a &quot;double default&quot; occurs when both the borrower and the guarantor or supplier of credit insurance for the same receivable are at fault.

Double default is a financial term that refers to the default of both a bond issuer and the company that has provided a credit enhancement (such as a guarantee or insurance) for the bond.

A bond issuer is the entity that issues a bond, which is a type of debt security. A bond issuer is responsible for paying the bondholder (the person who holds the bond) the principal amount of the bond, as well as any interest payments due on the bond. If the bond issuer fails to make these payments, it is said to have defaulted on the bond.

A credit enhancement is a financial instrument or mechanism that is used to improve the creditworthiness of a bond. It can take the form of a guarantee or insurance provided by a third party, or it can be a structure that is designed to reduce the risk of default.

<text>William David Gould (born April 24, 1963) is an American musician and producer. He is best known as the bassist of Faith No More.

==Biography==
===Early years===
Gould was born on April 24, 1963, in Los Angeles, and he is of Scottish and Hungarian descent from his father&#x27;s side. Gould started playing the bass while he was at Loyola High School in Los Angeles with future Faith No More keyboardist Roddy Bottum. His first band during these early years was named &quot;The Animated,&quot; a genre-bending new wave outfit that sounded something like a cross between The Buzzcocks, XTC and Michael Jackson. That band also featured future FNM vocalist Chuck Mosley on keyboards, and Mark Stewart (aka Stew) on guitar, of Negro Problem fame. In the early 1980s he moved to San Francisco to begin his studies and got involved with several underground bands. At this time, he met drummer Mike Bordin and guitarist Jim Martin. Soon after that Gould formed a band with Bordin, keyboardist Wade Worthington (quickly replaced with Roddy Bottum), and guitarist/vocalist Mike &#x27;The Man&#x27; Morris named Faith No Man, which eventually became Faith No More once Morris was out of the band.

In the mid-nineties, Gould began to work as producer and in 1997 he co-produced Faith No More&#x27;s &quot;Album of the Year&quot; with the former Swans drummer Roli Mosimann. Since then, he has become the CEO of Koolarrow Records and worked on various projects as a producer or guest musician.

In February 2009, it was announced that Faith No More would reform for a tour and possibly recording.

In 2015, after their longest gap between albums, Faith No More released their seventh studio album &quot;Sol Invictus&quot;.

=== Other collaborations ===

In the 1990s, Gould was in the original line-up of the Los Angeles based grindcore band Brujeria. He was also involved in several supergroups, such as Shandi&#x27;s Addiction (with Maynard Keenan, Brad Wilk and Tom Morello) as well as Black Diamond Brigade (with Norwegian rock musicians Euroboy, Torgny Amdam, Tarjei Strøm and Sigurd Wongraven). Furthermore, he played with Wayne Kramer, and Fear Factory, and produced CMX&#x27;s &quot;Vainajala&quot; album. His guest appearances include recordings for Romanian band Coma, and the production of &quot;Living Targets&quot; by German group Beatsteaks, Slovenia&#x27;s Elvis Jackson, and the album &quot;7&quot; for the German rock band Harmful, in which he also toured with them the whole year 2007 as guitar player.

In 2007, Gould joined up with the all star band Fear and the Nervous System, formed by Korn guitarist James &quot;Munky&quot; Shaffer. The band also features Bad Religion drummer Brooks Wackerman.

During the same year, Gould joined as bassist in Jello Biafra&#x27;s new band The Axis of Evildoers along with Ralph Spight (Victim&#x27;s Family) on guitar, and Jon Weiss on drums. They made their debut at Jello Biafra&#x27;s 50th-birthday celebration June 16 and 17, 2008 at the Great American Music Hall in San Francisco. The band has since been renamed Jello Biafra and the Guantanamo School of Medicine and an album &quot;Audacity of Hype&quot; was released on October 20, 2009.

In 2011, he released an experimental album called &quot;The Talking Book&quot;, a collaboration between himself and sound artist Jared Blum, known for his various projects on the Gigante Sound label. In 2012, he collaborated with Charles Hayward of This Heat and Mads Heldtberg on a project and release entitled House of Hayduk. Also in 2011, Billy contributed to the production of the soundtrack for the documentary &quot;The Sequential Art&quot;, by Norwegian director Espen J. Jörgensen.

In 2013, he reunited with Espen J. Jörgensen to provide synth, edits, recomposing and beats for a &#x27;groovy and experimental EP&#x27; titled Fugly.

In 2018, Gould joined Wayne Kramer (guitarist)&#x27;s MC50 band, celebrating the 50th anniversary of the release of the MC5 album, Kick Out The Jams. This band also featured: Kim Thayil of Soundgarden, Brendan Canty of Fugazi, and Marcus Durant of Zen Guerilla.

=== Koolarrow records ===

Since 1999, Gould has run an independent record label Koolarrow Records that has specialized in international acts and challenging artists such as LA&#x27;s Flattbush, Seattle&#x27;s Kultur Shock, Brujeria, Hog Molly (featuring Tad Doyle), Bosnian&#x27;s Dubioza Kolektiv, San Francisco&#x27;s La Plebe, German rock band Harmful, Alexander Hacke (of Einsturzende Neubauten), Como Asesinar a Felipes from Chile, former Danish experimental outfit Durefursog, and Mexican Dubwiser.

==Style==
He is known for employing a wide variety of playing styles, alternating between using a plectrum, slapping, and fingerstyle.
Fieldy from Korn has mentioned his admiration for Gould, and his chemistry with his Faith No More bandmates.

<doc id="780418" wikidata="Q594483" url="?curid=780418" title="Popigai impact structure">
<text>The Popigai impact structure is the eroded remnant of an impact crater in northern Siberia, Russia. It is tied with the Manicouagan structure as the fourth largest verified impact structure on Earth. A large bolide impact created the diameter crater approximately 35 million years ago during the late Eocene epoch (Priabonian stage). It might be linked to the Eocene–Oligocene extinction event.

The structure is east from the outpost of Khatanga and northeast of the city of Norilsk, NNE of the Anabar Plateau. It is designated by UNESCO as a Geopark, a site of special geological heritage. There is a small possibility that the Popigai impact crater may have formed simultaneously with the approximately 35-million-year-old Chesapeake Bay and Toms Canyon impact craters.
For decades, the Popigai impact structure has fascinated paleontologists and geologists, but the entire area was completely off limits because of the diamonds found there. However, a major investigatory expedition was undertaken in 1997, which greatly advanced understanding of the structure. The impactor is suggested to have been a H chondrite asteroid based on ejecta layers from Italy, with the impactor thought to have been several kilometeres in diameter.

The shock pressures from the impact instantaneously transformed graphite in the ground into diamonds within a radius of the impact point. These diamonds are usually in diameter, though a few exceptional specimens are in size. The diamonds inherited the tabular shape of the original graphite grains and also the original crystals&#x27; delicate striations.

== Diamond deposits ==

Most modern industrial diamonds are produced synthetically. The diamond deposits at Popigai have not been mined because of the remote location and lack of infrastructure, and are unlikely to be competitive with synthetic diamonds. Many of the diamonds at Popigai contain crystalline lonsdaleite, an allotrope of carbon that has a hexagonal lattice. Pure, laboratory-created lonsdaleite is up to 58% harder than ordinary diamonds. These types of diamonds are known as &quot;impact diamonds&quot; because they are thought to be produced when a meteorite strikes a graphite deposit at high velocity. They may have industrial uses but are unsuitable as gems.

Additionally, carbon polymorphs, a combination of diamond and lonsdaleite even harder than pure lonsdaleite, have been discovered in the crater.

<doc id="780419" wikidata="Q712551" url="?curid=780419" title="Philip Don Estridge">
<text>Philip Donald Estridge (June 23, 1937 – August 2, 1985), known as Don Estridge, was an American computer engineer who led development of the original IBM Personal Computer (PC), and thus is known as the &quot;father of the IBM PC&quot;. He opened its specifications, which revolutionized the computer industry, resulting in a vast increase in sales of personal computers and creating an entire industry of hardware compatible PCs.

==Early life==
Estridge was born in Jacksonville, Florida. His father was a professional photographer. He graduated from Bishop Kenny High School in 1955, and from the University of Florida in 1959. He married Mary Ann Hellier in September, 1958, and they had three daughters: Patricia Ann, Mary Evelyn and Sandra Marie. He completed a bachelor&#x27;s degree in electrical engineering at the University of Florida and worked at the Army, designing a radar system using computers, IBM and finally NASA&#x27;s Goddard Space Flight Center until he moved to Boca Raton, Florida, in 1969.

==IBM==
Before being the leader of the team to develop the IBM PC he had been the lead manager for the development of the IBM Series/1 mini-computer. After this project, in 1979, he was assigned to manage a Series/1 special bid development group. This engineering and planning organization was responsible for responding to custom system solutions requested by large account sales and marketing representatives. One of the largest and most successful special bids ever won by IBM was the Series/1 Agent Computer System for the State Farm Insurance company. In mid-1980, he was rewarded with the opportunity to lead IBM&#x27;s efforts in the emerging personal computer business.

His efforts to develop the IBM PC began when he took control of the IBM Entry Level Systems in 1980 (and was later named president of the newly formed IBM Entry Systems Division (ESD) in August 1983), with the goal of developing a low-cost personal computer to compete against increasingly popular offerings from the likes of Apple Computer, Commodore International, and other perceived IBM competitors. To create a cost-effective alternative to those companies&#x27; products, Estridge realized that it would be necessary to rely on third-party hardware and software. This was a marked departure from previous IBM strategy, which centered on in-house vertical development of complicated mainframe systems and their requisite access terminals. Estridge also published the specifications of the IBM PC, allowing a booming third-party aftermarket hardware business to take advantage of the machine&#x27;s expansion card slots.

The competitive cost and expandability options of the first model, the IBM PC model 5150, as well as IBM&#x27;s reputation, led to strong sales to both enterprise and home customers. Estridge was rapidly promoted, and by 1984 was IBM Vice President, Manufacturing, supervising all manufacturing worldwide. Steve Jobs offered Estridge a multimillion-dollar job as president of Apple Computer but he declined.

==Death and legacy==
Estridge and wife Mary Ann were killed in the crash of Delta Air Lines Flight 191 at Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport on August 2, 1985. He was 48 years old. At the time of his death, IBM ESD, which included the development and manufacturing of the IBM PC, PC DOS, PC LAN and TopView, had nearly 10,000 employees and had sold over a million PCs.

Estridge has been honored many times. In 1999, he was identified in &quot;CIO&quot; magazine as one of the people who &quot;invented the enterprise&quot;. The Don Estridge High-Tech Middle School — formerly IBM Facility Building 051 — in Boca Raton, Florida, is named after him, and received Estridge&#x27;s IBM 5150 personal computers from his family on the occasion of its dedication in 2004.

<text>Sir George Etherege (c. 1636 – c. 10 May 1692) was an English dramatist. He wrote the plays &quot;The Comical Revenge or, Love in a Tub&quot; in 1664, &quot;She Would If She Could&quot; in 1668, and &quot;The Man of Mode or, Sir Fopling Flutter&quot; in 1676.

==Biography==
===Early life===
George Etherege was born in Maidenhead, Berkshire, in about 1636, to George Etherege and Mary Powney, as the eldest of their six children. Educated at Lord Williams&#x27;s School, where a school building was later named after him, he was rumoured to have attended the University of Cambridge, although John Dennis states that to his certain knowledge Etherege understood neither Greek nor Latin, thus raising doubts that he could have been there.

Etherege served as an apprentice to a lawyer and later studied law at Clement&#x27;s Inn, London, one of the Inns of Chancery. He probably travelled abroad to France with his father, who stayed with the exiled queen Henrietta Maria, and may have witnessed in Paris performances of some of Molière&#x27;s earliest comedies. An allusion in one of his plays suggests he may have been personally acquainted with Roger de Rabutin, Comte de Bussy.

===Stage success===
Soon after the Restoration in 1660, Etherege wrote his comedy of &quot;The Comical Revenge or Love in a Tub&quot;, which brought him to the attention of Lord Buckhurst, afterwards Earl of Dorset. This was performed at the Duke&#x27;s Theatre in 1664 and a few copies were printed in the same year. It is partly in rhymed heroic verse, like the stilted tragedies of the Howards and Thomas Killigrew, but it contains comic scenes that are notably bright and fresh. The sparring between Sir Frederick and the Widow introduced a style of wit hitherto unknown upon the English stage.

The success of this play was very great, but Etherege waited four years before repeating the experiment. Meanwhile he gained a high reputation as a poetical beau and moved in the circle of Sir Charles Sedley, Lord Rochester and other noble wits of the day. His temperament is best shown by the names his contemporaries gave him: &quot;gentle George&quot; and &quot;easy Etheredge&quot;. 

In 1668, he brought out &quot;She Would If She Could&quot;, a comedy of action, wit and spirit, although by some thought to be frivolous and immoral. Here Etherege first showed himself as a new power in literature. He presents an airy and fantastic world, where flirtation is the only serious business in life. Etherege himself was living a life no less frivolous and unprincipled.

===&quot;The Man of Mode&quot;===

Between 1668 and 1671 Etherege went to Constantinople as secretary to the English Ambassador, Sir Daniel Harvey. After a silence of eight years, he came forward with only one further play: &quot;The Man of Mode or, Sir Fopling Flutter&quot;, widely considered the best comedy of manners written in England before the days of Congreve. It was acted and printed in 1676 and enjoyed success, which may be attributed to the belief that it satirises, or at least refers to well-known contemporaries in London. &quot;Sir Fopling Flutter&quot; was seen as a portrait of Beau Hewit, the reigning exquisite, Dorimant to be a reference to the Earl of Rochester, and Medley a portrait of Etherege himself (or equally plausible, his fellow playwright and wit, Sir Charles Sedley). Even the drunken shoemaker was a real character, who made his fortune from being brought to public notice in this fashion.

==Merry Gang==
Etherege was part of the Merry Gang (as Andrew Marvell described them). The Merry Gang flourished for about 15 years after 1665 and included John Wilmot, 2nd Earl of Rochester; Henry Jermyn; Charles Sackville, Earl of Dorset; John Sheffield, Earl of Mulgrave; Henry Killigrew; Sir Charles Sedley; the playwright William Wycherley; and George Villiers, 2nd Duke of Buckingham. The Merry Gang were advocates of libertinism. Members of the gang asserted the right to behave as they pleased and their antics were intended to draw the attention and amusement of the king. Rochester claimed his aim was to halt &quot;the strange decay of manly parts since the days of dear Harry the Second ()&quot;. The gang engaged in acts that were loud, outraged public decency and often included violence against women.

In 1676, Rochester and Etherege were involved in a brawl with the watch in Epsom that left a Captain Downs dead. At different times, Sedley and Buckhurst both paid Nell Gwyn, long-time mistress of the king, £100 a year to live with them; she also spent a period living with Rochester. Gwyn&#x27;s 1679 funeral was attended by all of the gang. 

===Life after the theatre===
Etherege was part of the circle of John Wilmot; both men had a daughter by the unmarried actress Elizabeth Barry. (All three appeared as characters in the 2005 film &quot;The Libertine&quot;, based on a play by Stephen Jeffreys.)

After his success, Etherege retired from literature, and a few years later lost much of his fortune to gambling. He was knighted at some time before 1679, and married a wealthy widow, Mary Sheppard Arnold. In March 1685, he was appointed resident minister to the Imperial German Court at Ratisbon. After three-and-a-half years&#x27; residence there, and after the Glorious Revolution, he left for Paris to join James II in exile. He died in Paris, probably in 1691, as Narcissus Luttrell notes this as a recent event in February 1692, identifying Sir George Etherege as the late King James&#x27;s Ambassador to Vienna.

Etherege&#x27;s manuscript despatches are preserved in the British Museum, where they were discovered and described by Gosse in 1881. Later editions were produced by Sybil Rosenfeld (1928) and Frederic Bracher (1974).

===Legacy===
Etherege holds a distinguished place in English literature as one of the &quot;big five&quot; in Restoration comedy, who invented the comedy of manners and led the way to the achievements of Congreve and Sheridan.

Etherege&#x27;s portraits of fops and beaux are considered to be the best of their kind. He is noted for his delicate touches of dress, furniture and scene, and a vivid replication of the fine airs of London gentlemen and ladies which may even better Congreve&#x27;s. His biography was first written in detail by Edmund Gosse in &quot;Seventeenth Century Studies&quot; (1883).

<text>Red Wing or Red Wing Creek structure is a meteor crater located in 
McKenzie County, North Dakota, about southwest of Watford City, North Dakota, United States.

== History ==
The crater is not exposed to the surface, but was discovered using seismic techniques, and the structure has produced oil since its discovery in 1972. Red Wing is in diameter, and it is buried at a depth of about The age of the structure is estimated at 200 ± 25 million years (Triassic).

The Red Wing Creek structure shows up well in seismic studies. The underlying Ordovician rocks are overlain by disturbed Devonian and Mississippian rocks. The structural disturbance is filled by thick rocks of Jurassic age, suggesting that the impact took place during the Triassic.

Shell Oil Company drilled exploratory wells on the Red Wing Creek structure in 1965 and 1968. These wells did not find oil, but did indicate very thick sections of Mississippian and Pennsylvanian rocks. In 1972, True Oil Company drilled a well that discovered oil. This discovery had an oil column that was about thick instead of the normal . This thick oil column was because the rocks were tilted on their sides.

The discovery of oil led to intense geological and geophysical studies of the Red Wing Creek area. In 1996, Christian Koeberl and his colleagues discovered planar deformation features (PDFs) in samples from two oil wells at the center of the structure. This provided unambiguous evidence for shock metamorphism, and confirmed the impact origin of the Red Wing Creek structure.

== Hypothetical multiple impact event ==
It has been suggested by Geophysicist David Rowley of the University of Chicago, working with John Spray of the University of New Brunswick and Simon Kelley of the Open University, that the Red Wing crater may have been part of a hypothetical multiple impact event which also formed the Manicouagan impact structure in northern Quebec, Rochechouart impact structure in France, Saint Martin crater in Manitoba, and Obolon&#x27; crater in Ukraine. All of the craters had previously been known and studied, but their paleoalignment had never before been demonstrated. Rowley has said that the chance that these craters could be aligned like this due to chance are nearly zero.

<text>Riachão Ring is a meteorite impact crater in Brazil. It lies within the Parnaíba Basin. It is in diameter and the age is estimated to be less than 200 million years (Jurassic or younger). The crater is exposed at the surface.

The structure was first identified from analysis of orbital photographs acquired during the Apollo–Soyuz Test Project in 1975. A reconnaissance investigation of the structure was reported by J. F. McHone in 1977. The structure of the site (dipping breccia along the rim) supported interpretation of an impact origin, but no shatter cones or shocked quartz were found at the time. 

The crater is severely eroded and there is apparently no ejecta remaining. The crater rim rises about above the surrounding surface, and a central uplift is about above the annular depression within the rim. Shock deformation has been identified in quartz grains within the central uplift.

<text>Otto Paul Hermann Diels (; 23 January 1876 – 7 March 1954) was a German chemist. His most notable work was done with Kurt Alder on the Diels–Alder reaction, a method for cyclohexene synthesis. The pair was awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1950 for their work. Their method of synthesizing cyclic organic compounds proved valuable for the manufacture of synthetic rubber and plastic. He completed his education at the University of Berlin, where he later worked. Diels was employed at the University of Kiel when he completed his Nobel Prize-winning work, and remained there until he retired in 1945. Diels was married, with five children. He died in 1954.

==Early life==
Diels was born on 23 January 1876 in Hamburg, Germany, and moved with his family to Berlin when he was two years old. He studied in Berlin at Joachimsthalsches Gymnasium before attending the University of Berlin starting in 1895. While at university, Diels studied chemistry under Emil Fischer, eventually graduating in 1899.

==Professional career==

Immediately after graduating from the University of Berlin, he was offered a position with the Institute of Chemistry at the school. He advanced quickly through the ranks at the school, eventually ending up as Department Head in 1913. He remained at the University of Berlin until 1915, when he accepted a position at the University of Kiel, where he remained until his retirement in 1945. It was during his time at Kiel, where he worked with Kurt Alder developing the Diels–Alder reaction, for which they were awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1950. His work with Alder developed a synthetic method which allows the synthesis of unsaturated cyclic compounds. This work was important in the production of synthetic rubber and plastic compounds.

==Personal life==
Diels married Paula Geyer in 1909. The couple had five children together, three sons and two daughters. Two of his sons were killed in action during World War II. In his free time, Diels enjoyed reading, music and traveling. He died on 7 March 1954.

<doc id="780439" wikidata="Q1020499" url="?curid=780439" title="Interfacing">
<text>Interfacing is a textile used on the unseen or &quot;wrong&quot; side of fabrics to make an area of a garment more rigid.

Interfacings can be used to: 
*stiffen or add body to fabric, such as the interfacing used in shirt collars and cuffs
*strengthen a certain area of the fabric, for instance where buttonholes will be sewn
*keep fabrics from stretching out of shape, particularly knit fabrics

Interfacings come in a variety of weights and stiffnesses to suit different purposes. They are also available in different colours, although typically interfacing is white. Generally, the heavier weight a fabric is, the heavier weight an interfacing it will use. Interfacing is sold at fabric stores by the yard or metre from bolts, similar to cutting fabric. Sewing patterns specify if interfacing is needed, the weight of interfacing that is required, and the amount. Some patterns use the same fabric as the garment to create an interfacing, as with sheer fabrics.

Interfacing has three main &#x27;types&#x27;: woven, non-woven and knit. Each is designed to behave differently. 
Some interfacings are loosely-woven muslin-type fabrics, often stiffened with a layer of chemical additive or starch. A woven interfacing can match the grain of the fashion fabric, enabling it to retain a similar handle and drape.
Non-woven interfacings are made from fibres that are bonded or felted together. 
Historically, hair canvas, Wigan and Buckram have been used for interfacing. Most are made from cotton or cotton-polyester blends. They tend to be very inexpensive.

==Fusible interfacing==
Most modern interfacings have heat-activated adhesive on one or both sides. They are affixed to a garment piece using heat and moderate pressure, from a hand iron for example. This type of interfacing is known as &quot;fusible&quot; interfacing. Non-fusible interfacings do not have adhesive and must be sewn by hand or machine.

<doc id="780444" wikidata="Q1786795" url="?curid=780444" title="Rochechouart impact structure">
<text>Rochechouart impact structure or Rochechouart astrobleme is an impact structure in France. Erosion has over the millions of years mostly destroyed its impact crater, the initial surface expression of the asteroid impact leaving highly deformed bedrock and fragments of the crater&#x27;s floor as evidence of it.

In 2008, the French State acknowledged the heritage value of the Rochechouart impact structure creating the “” on 12 sites representative of characteristic geological features of the impact structure.

== Location ==
Named after the town of Rochechouart, the Rochechouart impact structure is located on the western margin of the French Massif Central near the city of Limoges, approximately south of Paris. Rochechouart (population about ) is built with rocks created or modified by the impact (impactites). Chassenon, a third of the size of Rochechouart, is also built of impactites. Impactite was used 2000 years ago for building Chassenon&#x27;s monumental Roman baths of Cassinomagus.

Rochechouart impact structure is traversed by an administrative boundary separating the Charente and Haute-Vienne departments. The name of Chassenon (in Charente) was added to Rochechouart (in Haute-Vienne) for naming the Natural Reserve for political reasons aimed at obtaining larger support from both departments.

== History ==
The impact origin of the structure was recognized by F. Kraut in 1969. The occurrence of an unusual set of rock types referred to as &quot;breccias&quot; on the crystalline rocks of the Massif Central was reported in the Rochechouart area at the start of geology, in the early 1800s. However, their interpretation either as sedimentary, volcanic, tectonic, or a mix of these, was a major subject of debate until impact became progressively recognized as a geological process in the 1960s.

The impact origin of Rochechouart was definitely confirmed in the mid-1970s with the recognition by P. Lambert of the projectile signal in the various rocks bearing up to 500 times the nickel content of the target rocks. Rochechouart was then the first impact structure to be confirmed by the presence of projectile contamination, in the absence of meteorite debris and in the absence of crater morphology. This is significant because after shock metamorphism has been recognized and used by early impact geologists as &quot;the&quot; criteria for identifying impact structures in the absence of projectile, the opponent to impact craters on Earth postulated an endogenic process so called &quot;cryptovolcanism&quot;, capable of creating the extreme shock waves responsible for craters and shock metamorphism. Rochechouart was thus on the list of &quot;cryptovolcanic&quot; structures. The recognition of a projectile signal at Rochechouart and progressively at other impact structures and especially at the K-T boundary a few years later, definitely terminated the era of cryptovolcanism and skepticism toward impact cratering.

== Age ==
The age of the Rochechouart impact is a matter of debate. The ages (within the error bars) spans from less than 150 million years ago to over 240 million years. Since late 1990s the spreading has reduced and the last four determinations (since 2010) are converging toward an age between 203 and 207 million years during the Rhaetian, two to five million years older than the Triassic-Jurassic boundary.

== Hypothetical multiple impact event ==
Geophysicist David Rowley, working with John Spray and Simon Kelley, suggested that Rochechouart may have been part of a hypothetical multiple impact event which also formed the Manicouagan impact structure in northern Quebec, Saint Martin crater in Manitoba, Obolon&#x27; crater in Ukraine, and Red Wing crater in North Dakota. All of the impact structures had previously been known and studied, but their paleoalignment had never before been demonstrated. Rowley has said that the chance that these impact structures could be aligned like this due to chance are nearly zero. However, more recent work has found that the craters formed many millions of years apart, with the Saint Martin crater dating to 227.8 ± 1.1 Ma, while the Manicouagan impact structure dates to around 214 ± 1 million years ago.

== Geological setting ==
The Rochechouart impact structure is located on the margin of the French Massif Central. The target rocks exposed both in the center of the structure below the deposit, and radially outward are largely dominated by gneisses (blue and green on the map) and granites (pink on the map). These metamorphic and intrusive rocks were emplaced some 350-300 million years ago during the Variscan orogeny. The latter also referred as to Hercynian orogeny is a geologic mountain-building event caused by Late Paleozoic continental collision between the tectonic plates of Euramerica (Laurussia) and Gondwana to form the supercontinent of Pangaea. This caused the rise of Himalaya-like mountain ridges of the Massif Central, among others. The mountains were already eroded and transformed into a peneplain at the time of the impact.

The center of the structure is only from the closest sediments. The later were deposited after the impact. Yet the impact has most probably taken place on the margin of the Massif Central forming an island at that time, close enough to the nearby sea to have triggered a prominent tsunami.

== Major characteristics ==
The Rochechouart impact structure is composed of central sub circular zone approximately in diameter exposing breccias and impact melt rocks (represented in grey on the map), and an annular diffuse zone approximately in diameter where breccia dykes, intense fracturing, para-authochonous breccias are locally encountered in the crystalline rocks forming the basement of the crater. The central deposits fill and landmark the initial crater bottom. From a stratigraphical point of view, the impact deposits form a quasi-horizontal (slight tilt of less than ) continuous blanket. Yet the deposit is entailed by river valleys providing unique series of cross sections exposing the crater fill, crater floor and underlying bedrock.

Owing to the texture and the composition of the impact breccias, there is no significant contribution from sediments implying there was no sedimentary cover on top of the crystalline basement at the time of impact or it was shallow. The same applies for the sediments deposited in the nearby sea.

Yet the Rochechouart impactites all display a prominent hydrothermal overprint that can be related to the proximity of the sea at the time of impact.

Despite the erosion, the sequence of impactite lithologies is exceptionally complete at Rochechouart. All typologies of impactites and the whole sequence of shock metamorphic features are represented both in the deposits and in target. This includes dislocation breccia, breccia dikes, melt veins, pseudotachylites, cataclasites, shatter cones, megablocks, in the target rocks beneath and around the breccia deposits, and all types of melt free, melt poor and melt rich impactites in the deposits. Even the very fine materials (impactoclastites) depositing last and transported worldwide by the winds, is preserved forming a very fine layered horizontal deposits on top of the melt rich suevite (breccia with a debris matrix and both rock debris and melt fragments as clasts) near Chassenon (see map). This material is emplaced in a quiet environment, after all the chaos produced by the excavation, by the collapse of the cavity, and by the possible back flooding related to the tsunami induced by the impact in the nearby sea. Such a landmark of the final stage of impact deposit is exceptional at impact sites (quasi unique case among the 198 terrestrial meteoritic impacts officially registered on Earth as of 2020).

== Shape and size ==
The geometrical center of the structure is located west of Rochechouart, near the little village of la Judie (see map). The center of the structure according to the nature and distribution of the shock damage in the deposits and according to the negative gravity anomaly in the target stands about further South near Valette.

The size of the Rochechouart impact crater reported in the official impact database () lacks geologic significance. As previously mentioned, the initial morphology of the crater is lost, as are the initial diameter and shape of the crater. The reported diameter corresponds to the size of the area where deformation attributed to impact was reported by authors in the 1970s. From the morphology of the crater floor and the distribution of impact deposit it is clear the initial crater was much larger than the zone where outcrops the remnants of the crater fill has been mapped. In the diameter range, terrestrial impact craters are developing a central high, such as Boltysh crater, a impact crater in Ukraine. Like Rochechouart, Boltysh formed exclusively in crystalline basement. The crater is buried yet the deeper structure is known through numerous drill cores and geophysical investigation undertaken during the Soviet period in the search of hydrocarbons. The central high at Boltysh raises about above the level of crater floor in the low around the central high. There is no central high at Rochechouart, but a flat central low suggesting the central uplift has collapsed, a characteristic feature of larger impact craters. The current estimates for the Rochechouart initial crater fall in the range .

== Rochechouart projectile ==
Owing to the prominence of the siderophile contamination, a cometary projectile seems unlikely. The impactor was an asteroid. The earliest identification works involved the same heavy techniques and the same diagnostic elements (Ir, Os and other siderophile elements) as those that became famous in the early 1980s with the identification of the extraterrestrial signal at the K–T boundary worldwide. Since then the two extreme projectile types, iron meteorite and chondrite, have been argued by the successive workers. The most recent studies seems to agree with a special type of achondrite, a mix by impact of iron meteorite and silicates formerly designated as &quot;non magmatic&quot; iron meteorites.

== Planetary surfaces ==
Within the population of terrestrial impact craters, Rochechouart provides uniquely direct access for investigating major questions related to impact cratering as geological and as a biological process. This includes the understanding of crater fill mechanics and chronology, as well as satellite effects such as resurge, pyroclastic explosions, landslides, and more. This covers the mechanics of large impact crater readjustments and the puzzling challenge of “fluidization”, namely making coherent rocks behave like a liquid without melting. This involves characterizing and understanding the impact-induced hydrothermal cell responsible for the prominent hydrothermal overprint at Rochechouart, any possible nutriments, habitats and conditions of potential emergent life at impact craters, and the testing of recent theories and models involving impacts as prominent actors of the habitability of planets.

Despite this exceptional potential, Rochechouart was until very recently, one of the least, if not the least, investigated large impact crater on Earth. This has to do in part with the heavy vegetal cover masking the geology. But the situation is changing rapidly with the installation of the CIRIR (Center for International Research on Impact and on Rochechouart) on site and with the launch of CIRIR programs starting with the first series of drillings of the crater&#x27;s history. The latter has resulted in eight sites of the National Reserve having been completed. The scientific exploitation of the cores, currently with 60 projects and 60 teams from 12 nations scattered on 4 continents as part of the CIRIR program, is just starting. The curatorial facility on site for hosting the drill cores and the surface samples as part of the &quot;impact on shelve&quot; is under construction. The sister facility for hosting scientists and students coming worldwide for studying impact cratering and or training in planetary geology is under construction too. All this is possible because of the support of the local territories investing in the CIRIR, because of the State and the local territories both supporting the National Natural Reserve, because of the interest of the scientific community impact, and because of the value and the interest of the Rochechouart impact structure.

<text>Thomas Harriot (; – 2 July 1621), also spelled Harriott, Hariot or Heriot, was an English astronomer, mathematician, ethnographer and translator to whom the theory of refraction is attributed. Thomas Harriot was also recognized for his contributions in navigational techniques, working closely with John White to create advanced maps for navigation. While Harriot worked extensively on numerous papers on the subjects of astronomy, mathematics and navigation, he remains obscure because he published little of it, namely only &quot;The Briefe and True Report of the New Found Land of Virginia&quot; (1588). This book includes descriptions of English settlements and financial issues in Virginia at the time. He is sometimes credited with the introduction of the potato to the British Isles. Harriot invented binary notation and arithmetic several decades before Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz, but this remained unknown until the 1920s. He was also the first person to make a drawing of the Moon through a telescope, on 5 August 1609, about four months before Galileo Galilei.
After graduating from St Mary Hall, Oxford, Harriot travelled to the Americas, accompanying the 1585 expedition to Roanoke island funded by Sir Walter Raleigh and led by Sir Ralph Lane. He learned the Carolina Algonquian language from two Native Americans, Wanchese and Manteo, and could translate it, making him a vital member of the expedition. On his return to England, he worked for the 9th Earl of Northumberland.

==Biography==
===Early life and education===
Born in 1560 in Oxford, England, Thomas Harriot attended St Mary Hall, Oxford. His name appears in the hall&#x27;s registry dating from 1577.

Harriot started to study navigation shortly after receiving a bachelor&#x27;s degree from Oxford University. The study of navigation that Harriot studied concentrated on the idea of the open seas and how to cross to the New World from the Atlantic Ocean. He used instruments such as the astrolabe and sextants to aid his studies of navigation. After educating himself by incorporating ideals from his astronomic and nautical studies, Harriot taught other captains his navigational techniques in Raleigh. His findings were recorded in the &quot;Articon&quot; but were later never found.

===Roanoke===
After his graduation from Oxford in 1580, Harriot was first hired by Sir Walter Raleigh as a mathematics tutor; he used his knowledge of astronomy/astrology to provide navigational expertise, help design Raleigh&#x27;s ships, and serve as his accountant. Prior to his expedition with Raleigh, Harriot wrote a treatise on navigation. He made efforts to communicate with Manteo and Wanchese, two Native Americans who had been brought to England. Harriot devised a phonetic alphabet to transcribe their Carolina Algonquian language.

Harriot and Manteo spent many days in one another&#x27;s company; Harriot interrogated Manteo closely about life in the New World and learned much that was to the advantage of the English settlers. In addition, he recorded the sense of awe with which the Native Americans viewed European technology:

He made only one expedition, around 1585–86, and spent some time in the New World visiting Roanoke Island off the coast of North Carolina, expanding his knowledge by improving his understanding of the Carolina Algonquian language. As the only Englishman who had learned Algonquin prior to the voyage, Harriot was vital to the success of the expedition.

His account of the voyage, named &quot;A Briefe and True Report of the New Found Land of Virginia&quot;, was published in 1588 (probably written a year before). The &quot;True Report&quot; contains an early account of the Native American population encountered by the expedition; it proved very influential upon later English explorers and colonists. He wrote: &quot;Whereby it may be hoped, if means of good government be used, that they may in short time be brought to civility and the embracing of true religion.&quot; At the same time, his views of Native Americans&#x27; industry and capacity to learn were later largely ignored in favor of the parts of the &quot;True Report&quot; about extractable minerals and resources.

As a scientific adviser during the voyage, Harriot was asked by Raleigh to find the most efficient way to stack cannonballs on the deck of the ship. His ensuing theory about the close-packing of spheres shows a striking resemblance to atomism and modern atomic theory, which he was later accused of believing. His correspondence about optics with Johannes Kepler, in which he described some of his ideas, later influenced Kepler&#x27;s conjecture.

===Later years===
Harriot was employed for many years by Henry Percy, 9th Earl of Northumberland, with whom he resided at Syon House, which was run by Henry Percy&#x27;s cousin Thomas Percy.

The Duke was surrounded by many scholars and learned men and provided a more stable form of patronage than Raleigh. In 1595 the Duke of Northumberland made property in Durham over to Harriot, moving him up the social ladder into &#x27;the landed gentry&#x27;. Not long after the Durham transactions, the Duke gave Harriot the use of one of the houses on the estate at Syon, to work on optics and the sine law of refraction.

Harriot&#x27;s sponsors began to fall from favor: Raleigh was the first, and Harriot&#x27;s other patron Henry Percy, the Earl of Northumberland, was imprisoned in 1605 in connection with the Gunpowder Plot as he was closely connected to one of the conspirators, Thomas Percy. Harriot himself was interrogated and briefly imprisoned but was soon released. Walter Warner, Robert Hues, William Lower, and other scientists were present around the Earl of Northumberland&#x27;s mansion as they worked for him and assisted in the teaching of the family&#x27;s children.

While this was occurring, Harriot continued his work involving mainly astronomy, and in 1607 Harriot used his notes from the observations of Halley&#x27;s Comet from Ilfracombe to elaborate on his understanding of its orbit. Soon after, in 1609 and 1610 respectively, Harriot turned his attention towards the physical aspects of the Moon and his observations of the first sightings of sunspots.

In early 1609, he bought a &quot;Dutch trunke&quot; (telescope), invented in 1608, and his observations were among the first uses of a telescope for astronomy. Harriot is now credited as the first astronomer to draw an astronomical object after viewing it through a telescope: he drew a map of the Moon on 5 August 1609 [O.S. 26 July 1609], preceding Galileo by several months. By 1613, Harriot had created two maps of the whole Moon, with many identifiable features such as lunar craters depicted in their correct relative positions that were not to be improved upon for several decades. He also observed sunspots in December 1610.

===Death===
From 1614 Harriot was consulting Theodore de Mayerne, who was among James I&#x27;s doctors, for an apparent cancer of the left nostril that was gradually eating away the septum and was apparently linked to a cancerous ulcer on his lip. This progressed until 1621, when he was living with a friend named Thomas Buckner on Threadneedle Street. There he died, apparently from skin cancer. It was suspected that Harriot&#x27;s cancer was due to excessive tobacco consumption.

He died on 2 July 1621, three days after writing his will (discovered by Henry Stevens). His executors posthumously published his &quot;Artis Analyticae Praxis&quot; on algebra in 1631; Nathaniel Torporley was the intended executor of Harriot&#x27;s wishes, but Walter Warner in the end pulled the book into shape. It may be a compendium of some of his works but does not represent all that he left unpublished (more than 400 sheets of annotated writing). It is not directed in a way that follows the manuscripts and it fails to give the full significance of Harriot&#x27;s writings.

Thomas Harriot was buried in the church of St Christopher le Stocks in Threadneedle Street, near where he died. The church was subsequently damaged in the Great Fire of London, and demolished in 1781 to enable expansion of the Bank of England.

==Legacy==
Harriott also studied optics and refraction, and apparently discovered Snell&#x27;s law 20 years before Snellius did; like so many of his works, this remained unpublished. In Virginia he learned the local Algonquian language, which may have had some effect on his mathematical thinking. He founded the &quot;English school&quot; of algebra. Around 1600, he introduced an algebraic symbolism close to modern notation; thus, computation with unknowns became as easy as with numbers. He is also credited with discovering Girard&#x27;s theorem, although the formula bears Girard&#x27;s name as he was the first to publish it.
His algebra book &quot;Artis Analyticae Praxis&quot; (1631) was published posthumously in Latin. Unfortunately, the editors did not understand much of his reasoning and removed the parts they did not comprehend such as the negative and complex roots of equations. Because of the dispersion of Harriot&#x27;s writings the full annotated English translation of the &quot;Praxis&quot; was not completed until 2007. A more complete manuscript, &quot;De numeris triangularibus et inde de progressionibus arithmeticis: Magisteria magna&quot;, was finally published in facsimile form with commentary by Janet Beery and Jackie Stedall in 2009.

The first biography of Harriot was written in 1876 by Henry Stevens of Vermont but not published until 1900 fourteen years after his death. The publication was limited to 167 copies and so the work was not widely known until 1972 when a reprint edition appeared. Prominent American poet, novelist and biographer Muriel Rukeyser wrote an extended literary inquiry into the life and significance of Hariot (her preferred spelling), &quot;The Traces of Thomas Hariot&quot; (1970, 1971). Interest in Harriot continued to revive with the convening of a symposium at the University of Delaware in April 1971 with the proceedings published by the Oxford University Press in 1974. John W. Shirley the editor (1908-1988) went on to publish &quot;A Sourcebook for the Study of Thomas Harriot&quot; and his Harriot biography (1983). The papers of John Shirley are held in Special Collections at the University of Delaware.

Harriot&#x27;s accomplishments remain relatively obscure because he did not publish any of his results and also because many of his manuscripts have been lost; those that survive are in the British Museum and in the archives of the Percy family at Petworth House (Sussex) and Alnwick Castle (Northumberland). He was frequently accused of being an atheist, and it has been suggested that he deliberately refrained from publishing for fear of intensifying such attacks; as the literary historian Stephen Greenblatt writes &quot;... he preferred life to fame. And who can blame him?&quot;
An event was held at Syon House, West London, to celebrate the 400th anniversary of Harriot&#x27;s first observations of the Moon on 26 July 2009. This event, Telescope400, included the unveiling of a plaque to commemorate Harriot by Lord Egremont. The plaque can now be seen by visitors to Syon House, the location of Harriot&#x27;s historic observations. His drawing made 400 years earlier is believed to be based on the first observations of the Moon through a telescope. The event (sponsored by the Royal Astronomical Society) was run as part of the International Year of Astronomy (IYA).

The original documents showing Harriot&#x27;s Moon map of c. 1611, observations of Jupiter&#x27;s satellites, and first observations of sunspots were on display at the Science Museum, London, from 23 July 2009 until the end of the IYA.

The observatory in the campus of the College of William &amp; Mary is named in Harriot&#x27;s honor. A crater on the Moon was named after him in 1970; it is on the Moon&#x27;s far side and hence unobservable from Earth.

In July 2014 the International Astronomical Union launched NameExoWorlds, a process for giving proper names to certain exoplanets and their host stars. The process involved public nomination and voting for the new names. In December 2015, the IAU announced the winning name was Harriot for the exoplanet 55 Cancri f. The winning name was submitted by the Royal Netherlands Association for Meteorology and Astronomy of the Netherlands. It honors the astronomer.

The Thomas Harriot College of Arts and Sciences at East Carolina University in Greenville, NC is named in recognition of this Harriot&#x27;s scientific contributions to the New World such as his work &quot;A Briefe and True Report of the New Found Land of Virginia&quot;.

==In fiction==
An alternate history short story, &quot;Harriott Publishes&quot;, depicts the consequences of Harriott publishing his observations before Galileo. It appears in anthology of similar stories, &quot;Altered Times&quot;, pages 13–15.
In Deborah Harkness&#x27; All Souls Trilogy, Diana Bishop persuades the clockmaker Nicholas Vallin to make and engrave a telescope for Harriot, recording his unpublished contribution to the science.

== Telescope and Moon mapping ==

Harriot&#x27;s 5 August [O.S. 26 July] 1609 drawings of his observations of the Moon have been noted as the first recorded telescopic observations ever made, predating Galileo Galilei&#x27;s 30 November 1609 observation by almost four months. Galileo&#x27;s drawings, which were the first such observations to be published, contained greater detail such as identifying previously unknown features including mountains and craters. Harriot inaccurately drew how far the crescent Moon would be illuminated around its limb, inaccurately drew the position of the craters, and did not draw the relief details that one would see along the Moon&#x27;s light/dark terminator. Critics, such as Terrie Bloom, accused Harriot of plagiarizing depictions directly from Galileo&#x27;s works and argued that Harriot&#x27;s representation of the Moon was an inadequate representation that needed to be improved. However, both descriptions were also deemed valuable due to the scientists focusing on different specific observations. Galileo describes the arrangement in a topographical way while Harriot used cartographical concepts to illustrate his views of the Moon. Harriot used a 6X Dutch telescope for his observations of the Moon. Harriot&#x27;s recordings and descriptions were very simple with minimal detail causing his sketches to be difficult to analyze by later scientists. Galileo&#x27;s astronomical observations regarding the Moon were published in his book &quot;Sidereus Nuncius&quot; in 1610 and Harriot&#x27;s observations were published in 1784 with some not coming to light until 1965. Harriot&#x27;s lack of publication is presumed to be connected to the issues with the Ninth Earl of Northumberland and the Gunpowder Plot. Harriot was also known to have read and admired the work of Galileo in &quot;Sidereus Nuncius&quot;. Harriot continued his observations of the Moon until 1612.

== Sunspots ==
Thomas Harriot is recognized as the first person to observe sunspots in 1610 with the use of a telescope. Harriot observed the sunspot with the use of a telescope in a direct and hazardous way. Even though Harriot observed the Sun directly through his telescope, there were no recorded injuries to his eyes. Harriot&#x27;s depiction of the sunspots were documented in 199 drawings that provided details about the solar rotation and its acceleration. Like many of Harriot&#x27;s other notes, depictions of the sunspots were not published. Similar to the early observation of the Moon, Galileo was also known to contribute his observations of sunspots and published his findings in 1613. The specifics as to how Harriot&#x27;s telescope was set up remains largely unknown. However, it is known that Harriot used different magnifications of telescopes with 10X and 20X power being used most often. Harriot chose to observe the sunspots after sunrise because it made the vertical easier to analyze. According to Harriot&#x27;s notes there was a total of 690 observations of sunspots recorded. Harriot&#x27;s findings challenged the idea of the unchanging heavens by explaining the Sun&#x27;s axial rotation and provided further support for the heliocentric theory.

== Compounding ==
Around 1620, Harriot&#x27;s unpublished papers include the early basis of continuous compounding. Harriot uses modern mathematical concepts to explain the process behind continuous compounding. The concept of compounded interest occurs when the more times interest is added within the year assuming the rate stays the same then the final interest will be larger. Based on this observation, Harriot created mathematical equations that included logarithms and series calculations to illustrate his concepts.

<doc id="780448" wikidata="Q7354413" url="?curid=780448" title="Rock Elm Disturbance">
<text>The Rock Elm Disturbance is an impact crater in Pierce County, Wisconsin, United States, roughly southwest of Menomonie. The disturbance is named for Rock Elm, Wisconsin, a nearby town.

== Description ==

The meteorite that caused the impact crater is estimated to have been in diameter with a mass of and impact velocity of .

The crater is in diameter, and fossils found in the rock filling the crater suggest it dates to the Middle Ordovician Period, about 455 to 430 million years ago.
It may be one of several Middle Ordovician meteors that fell roughly simultaneously 469 million years ago, part of a proposed Ordovician meteor event within the continental United States that includes the Decorah crater in Iowa, the Slate Islands crater in Lake Superior, and the Ames crater in Oklahoma.

== Crater characteristics ==
A raised area at the center of the crater 0.8 km (0.5 mi) wide by 2.4 km (1.5 mi) long suggests that the impact caused a major upheaval of lower-lying rock— breccia and Mount Simon Sandstone, which lies beneath the surface and is much older than the rock layers in the area surrounding it. Additionally, Blue Rock, an exposed portion of faulted Prairie du Chien sandstone lies at the south of the crater&#x27;s edge, which can be viewed at Nugget Lake County Park.
=== Discovery of reidite ===
While studying the effects of erosion on areas of meteorite impact, researchers from the University of Puerto Rico discovered a rare high-pressure mineral, reidite, at the center of the Rock Elm impact site. Reidite is a dense form of zircon (ZrSiO4) that is formed by the intense heat and pressure as is caused by an impacting meteorite. The reidite found at the Rock Elm structure is the oldest known example of the mineral. It has been found in other impact sites such as the Xiuyan crater in China; the Chesapeake Bay impact crater in Virginia, United States; and the Nordlinger Ries crater in Germany.

<doc id="780450" wikidata="Q491504" url="?curid=780450" title="Roter Kamm crater">
<text>Roter Kamm () is a meteorite crater, located in the Sperrgebiet, within the Namibian section of the Namib Desert, approximately north of Oranjemund and southwest of Aurus Mountain in the ǁKaras Region. The crater is in diameter and is deep. The age is estimated at 4.81 ± 0.5 Ma, placing it in the Pliocene. The crater is exposed at the surface, but its original floor is covered by sand deposits at least thick.

== Description ==
The meteorite hit a layer of Precambrian granitic gneiss that is part of the Namaqua Metamorphic Complex, overlaid with some younger sedimentary rocks. No parts of the meteorite have been found, suggesting that it completely evaporated upon impact. The meteor that hit it was approximately the size of an SUV.

The Roter Kamm impact structure exposes a large volume of cataclastic/mylonitic and pseudotachylitic breccias in the basement granite and gneisses, which is unusual for small craters. Anomalous quartz found at the rim of the crater, and the primary fluid inclusions in the quartz, seem to provide evidence for post-impact hydrothermal activity, generated by impact heat, at the Roter Kamm impact crater. Eolian and alluvial processes each played a role in modifying the Roter Kamm impact crater since its formation. Much of the more recent history of crater modification relates to eolian processes. Active mobile sands largely bury the crater and effectively mask most of the signatures associated with prior activity by other processes. Ongoing eolian erosion is responsible for scouring of the exposed rim.

<text>Sääksjärvi () is a lake in Kokemäki, Satakunta, western Finland, east from the town of Pori. The lake is notable because it overlies an impact crater.

The crater is in diameter and is completely buried under the lake and is not visible at the surface. The age of the impact structure is estimated to be about 543 ± 12 Ma (million years ago), at the boundary between the Ediacaran and Cambrian periods. There are impactite rocks in the southwestern region from the crater confirming its extraterrestrial origin. At the time of its discovery, only one impact crater (Lappajärvi) was known in Finland.

<text>Sherwood B. Idso (born June 12, 1942) was the president of the Center for the Study of Carbon Dioxide and Global Change, which rejects the scientific consensus on climate change. Previously he was a Research Physicist with the U.S. Department of Agriculture&#x27;s Agricultural Research Service at the U.S. Water Conservation Laboratory in Phoenix, Arizona, where he worked since June 1967. He was also closely associated with Arizona State University over most of this period, serving as an adjunct professor in the Departments of Geology, Geography, and Botany and Microbiology. His two sons, Craig and Keith, are, respectively, the founder and vice president of the Center for the Study of Carbon Dioxide and Global Change.

Idso was the author or co-author of over 500 publications including the books Carbon Dioxide: Friend or Foe? (1982) and Carbon Dioxide and Global Change: Earth in Transition (1989). He served on the editorial board of the international journal &quot;Agricultural and Forest Meteorology&quot; from 1973 to 1993 and since 1993 has served on the editorial board of &quot;Environmental and Experimental Botany&quot;. Over the course of his career, he has been an invited reviewer of manuscripts for 56 different scientific journals and 17 different funding agencies, representing an unusually large array of disciplines. He is an ISI highly cited researcher.

==Early life and education==
Sherwood Idso was born in Thief River Falls, Minnesota on June 12, 1942, where he lived until graduating from high school in 1960 as valedictorian. Idso also attended the Institute of Technology at the University of Minnesota, receiving a B.Phys. in Physics with distinction in 1964, followed by an M.S. in Soil Science (with a minor in Physics) in 1966 and then a Ph.D. in Soil Science (with a minor in Meteorology and Mechanical Engineering) in 1968. His doctoral thesis was titled, &quot;The photosynthetic response of plants to their environment: a holocoenotic method of analysis&quot;.

==Climate science==
In 1972, Idso published an article called &quot;An American Haboob&quot;, in which he documented a large dust storm in Arizona which occurred on July 16, 1971, and which stretched from Tucson to Phoenix.

In 1980, Idso published research which concluded that climate sensitivity was probably only about 0.3 °C, about a tenth of the generally accepted value. The following year, he opposed NASA&#x27;s global warming predictions, saying they were &quot;about 10 times too great,&quot; adding that, in his view, global warming would have a beneficial effect on agriculture.

In 1984, Idso, along with A.J. Brazel, published a study in &quot;Nature&quot; which concluded, contrary to a report the National Academy of Sciences released the previous year, that rising CO2 levels would increase streamflow. The study&#x27;s authors argued that the NAS report came to the opposite conclusion because it neglected the effect of rising CO2 levels on plants.

In the 1997 book, &quot;Global Warming: The Science and the Politics&quot; Idso said: &quot;I find no compelling reason to believe that the earth will necessarily experience any global warming as a consequence of the ongoing rise in the atmosphere&#x27;s carbon dioxide concentration.&quot;

In the 1998 paper, &quot;-induced global warming: a skeptic&#x27;s view of potential climate change&quot; Idso said: &quot;Several of these cooling forces have individually been estimated to be of equivalent magnitude, but of opposite sign, to the typically predicted greenhouse effect of a doubling of the air’s content, which suggests to me that little net temperature change will ultimately result from the ongoing buildup of in Earth&#x27;s atmosphere.&quot;

== Personal Life ==

=== Religion and Marriage ===
Idso was a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints. He was married and sealed to Carolyn Marie Wakefield in the Logan, Utah temple on August 23, 1963, whom he referred to as &quot;the most beautiful woman in the world&quot; in his diary. 

=== Family Life and Pastimes ===
Sherwood and Carolyn had seven children: his sons Grant, Keith, Craig, Lance, Wayne, and his daughters Jennifer and Julene. Idso was described as a very intelligent man, but also one who had a &quot;great sense of humor.&quot; Idso held a lifelong fascination with nature as well as an enjoyment of photography, of which produced a variety of hobbies, such as capturing pictures of small creatures or assisting in the creation of a saltwater pond in the family home backyard.

== Death ==
Idso passed away on June 12th, 2024, on his 82nd birthday. He is interred in the Mesa City Cemetery in Mesa, AZ, and is survived by his wife, Carolyn.

<text>Tsarina Eudoxia Fyodorovna Lopukhina (9 August 1669 7 September 1731) was the first wife of Peter I the Great, and the last ethnic Russian and non-foreign wife of a Russian monarch. She was the mother of Tsarevich Alexei Petrovich and the paternal grandmother of Peter II of Russia.

==Early life==
Eudoxia was born to Feodor Abramovich Lopukhin and Ustinia Bogdanovna Rtishcheva, making her a member of the Lopukhin family and a noble. 

==Tsaritsa==

She was chosen as a bride for the Tsar by his mother Natalia Naryshkina primarily on account of Eudoxia&#x27;s mother&#x27;s relation to the famous boyar Fyodor Rtishchev. She was crowned Tsarina in 1689 and gave birth to Grand Duke Alexei Petrovich of Russia the following year. She had two more sons by Peter, Alexander in 1691 and Paul in 1693, but both died during infancy. The Tsar could not stand her conservative relatives and soon abandoned her for a Dutch beauty, Anna Mons. Eudoxia&#x27;s letters to Peter were full of complaints and expressions of unrequited love.

In 1696, during his prolonged journey to Western Europe, Peter asked his Naryshkin relatives to persuade Eudoxia to enter a monastery. This could not be effected until 1698, when she was finally banished to the Intercession Convent of Suzdal.

== Later years ==
The local hegumen, however, allowed her to live there much as a lay woman would. She even found herself a lover, an officer named Stepan Glebov. Nine years later, when Peter the Great learned about their affair, he sentenced Glebov to execution by impalement. According to the legend, the Emperor also ordered the soldiers to force Eudoxia to watch her lover&#x27;s death.

Gradually, Eudoxia and her son became the centre of opposition to Peter&#x27;s reforms, primarily from the church officials. In his sermons, Demetrius of Rostov referred to Eudoxia as &quot;our great sovereign&quot; and prophesied her impending return to the throne. This conservative party was shattered by Peter in 1718. During the prosecution of Tsarevich Alexei Petrovich of Russia, all the bishops who supported her were executed, and Eudoxia was transferred to a convent in Ladoga.

After Peter&#x27;s death and the rise of his second Empress consort Catherine I on the throne, Eudoxia was secretly moved to Shlisselburg Fortress near St. Petersburg, where she was under strict custody as a state prisoner in a dungeon.

In 1727, her grandson Peter II ascended the Russian throne and immediately recalled her to Moscow. She returned to the former capital with a great pomp and was allowed to keep her own court at the Novodevichy Convent until her death in 1731.

After the death of Peter II, who had died before her in 1730, she was among the nominated candidates for the new monarch, but she declined, in favor of her niece-in-law Empress Anna, so Anna continued to honor her.

==Issue== 
By Peter I, she had three sons: 
* Tsarevich Alexei of Russia (18 February 1690 – 26 June 1718). After his mother&#x27;s fall in disgrace he lived a particularly precarious life, and was eventually imprisoned by his father on charges of conspiring against him. He died in prison as a result of the lashes inflicted him, just two days after being officially sentenced to death by his father and the Senate. In 1711 he had married the Princess Charlotte Christine of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel, sister of the wife of Charles VI of Habsburg. He had two children by her: Natalya (1714–1728) and the future tsar Peter II (1715–1730). 
* Grand Duke Alexander (Preobrazhnskoe, 3 October 1691 – Moscow, 14 May 1692). He was baptized on 11 November 1691 in the Chudov Monastery, with his paternal aunt Grand Duchess Natalya Alekseevna Romanova as godmother. He died at the age of one and a half and was buried on 24 May 1692 in the Cathedral of the Archangel Michael inside the Moscow Kremlin. The father, in defiance of his wife from whom he was now completely estranged, did not take part in the funeral. 
* Grand Duke Paul (1693–1693)

<text>The Arthur S. Flemming Award is an award given annually to employees of the United States federal government. More than 500 individuals have received the award since it was created in 1948. The Trachtenberg School of Public Policy and Public Administration at George Washington University administers the award. A nomination requires the person to be a federal employee for at least three years and for less than fifteen years. Every year, twelve awards are given in five different categories: Leadership and/or Management, Legal Achievement, Social Science, Clinical Trials and Translational Research, Applied Science and Engineering, and Basic Science. 

Federal agencies nominate public servants who meet the nomination requirements. Previously nominated individuals include Gretchen Campbell for accomplishments in the emerging field of atomtronics; and Fern Hunt for a sustained record of contributions to probability, stochastic modelling, and other fields. 

The awards are given to the annual winners at George Washington University through its Trachtenberg School of Public Policy and Public Administration, which, since 1997, has worked in partnership with the Arthur S. Flemming Awards Commission. 

== History ==
In 1948, Arthur Sherwood Flemming was the guest speaker at a meeting of the Downtown Jaycees in Washington, D.C., in the federal service. Flemming challenged the Jaycees to come up with a way to give &#x27;recognition&#x27; to the younger employee. 

Several weeks later, the Jaycees gave Flemming a proposal for an awards program with an upper age limit of 40, with the award named after Flemming. Flemming approved the awards program.

<doc id="780464" wikidata="Q335008" url="?curid=780464" title="Frederick Roberts, 1st Earl Roberts">
<text>Field Marshal Frederick Sleigh Roberts, 1st Earl Roberts (30 September 1832 – 14 November 1914), was a British Victorian era general who became one of the most successful British military commanders of his time. Born in India to an Anglo-Irish family, Roberts joined the East India Company Army and served as a young officer in the Indian Rebellion during which he was awarded the Victoria Cross for gallantry. He was then transferred to the British Army and fought in the Expedition to Abyssinia and the Second Anglo-Afghan War, in which his exploits earned him widespread fame. Roberts would go on to serve as the Commander-in-Chief, India, before leading British forces for a year during the Second Boer War. He also became the last Commander-in-Chief of the Forces before the post was abolished in 1904.

A man of small stature, Roberts was affectionately known to his troops and the wider British public as &quot;Bobs&quot; and revered as one of Britain&#x27;s leading military figures at a time when the British Empire reached the height of its power. He became a symbol for the British Army and in later life became an influential proponent of stronger defence in response to the increasing threat that the German Empire posed to Britain in the lead-up to the First World War.

==Early life==
Born at Cawnpore, India, on 30 September 1832, Roberts was the son of General Sir Abraham Roberts, who had been born into an Anglo-Irish family in County Waterford in the south-east of Ireland. At the time, Sir Abraham was commanding the 1st Bengal European Regiment. Roberts was named Sleigh in honour of the garrison commander, Major General William Sleigh. His mother was Edinburgh-born Isabella Bunbury, daughter of Major Abraham Bunbury from Kilfeacle in County Tipperary.

Roberts was educated at Eton, Sandhurst, and Addiscombe Military Seminary before entering the East India Company Army as a second lieutenant with the Bengal Artillery on 12 December 1851. He became Aide-de-Camp to his father in 1852, transferred to the Bengal Horse Artillery in 1854 and was promoted to lieutenant on 31 May 1857.

==Indian Rebellion of 1857==

Roberts fought in the Indian Rebellion of 1857, seeing action during the siege and capture of Delhi where he was slightly wounded, and found a dying John Nicholson amidst the chaos of the battle. He was then present at the relief of Lucknow where, as Deputy Assistant Quartermaster-General, he was attached to the staff of Sir Colin Campbell, Commander-in-Chief, India. He was awarded the Victoria Cross for actions on 2 January 1858 at Khudaganj. The citation reads:

He was also mentioned in despatches for his service at Lucknow in March 1858. In common with other officers, he transferred from the East India Company Army to the Indian Army that year.

==Abyssinia and Afghanistan==
Having been promoted to second captain on 12 November 1860 and to brevet major on 13 November 1860, Roberts transferred to the British Army in 1861 and served in the Umbeyla and Abyssinian campaigns of 1863 and 1867–1868 respectively. Having been promoted to brevet lieutenant colonel on 15 August 1868 and to the substantive rank of captain on 18 November 1868, Roberts also fought in the Lushai campaign of 1871–1872 which was directed at the chiefs Vonolel, Lalbura and Bengkhaia to recover the captive Mary Winchester.

He was promoted to the substantive rank of major on 5 July 1872, appointed Companion of the Order of the Bath (CB) on 10 September 1872 and promoted to brevet colonel on 30 January 1875. That year he became Quartermaster-General of the Bengal Army.

He was given command of the Kurram Valley Field Force in October 1878 and took part in the Second Anglo-Afghan War. For his success at the Battle of Peiwar Kotal in December 1878, he received the thanks of Parliament, was promoted to the substantive rank of major general on 31 December 1878 and was advanced to Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath (KCB) on 25 July 1879.

The Treaty of Gandamak of May 1879 brought peace with Afghanistan. However, after the murder of Sir Louis Cavagnari, the British envoy in Kabul, in September 1879, the second phase of the war began. Roberts was put in command of the Kabul Field Force and despatched to Kabul to seek retribution. After victory at the Battle of Charasiab on 6 October 1879, Roberts occupied Kabul, and was given the local rank of lieutenant-general on 11 November 1879. In December 1879, Roberts&#x27; force was besieged in the Sherpur Cantonment outside Kabul until, on 23 December, he repulsed a mass attack and reoccupied the city. In May 1880, Lieutenant General Sir Donald Stewart arrived in Kabul from Kandahar with a further 7,200 troops, taking over the Kabul command from Roberts.

After the defeat of a British brigade at Maiwand near Kandahar on 27 July 1880, Roberts was appointed commander of the Kabul and Kandahar Field Force. He led his 10,000 troops across 300 miles of rough terrain to relieve Kandahar and defeat Ayub Khan at the Battle of Kandahar on 1 September 1880. For his services, Roberts again received the thanks of Parliament, and was advanced to Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the Bath (GCB) on 21 September 1880 and appointed Companion of the Order of the Indian Empire (CIE) during 1880.
After a very brief interval as Governor of Natal and Governor and Commander-in-Chief of the Transvaal Province and High Commissioner for South Eastern Africa with effect from 7 March 1881, Roberts, having become a baronet on 11 June 1881, was appointed Commander-in-Chief of the Madras Army on 16 November 1881. Promoted to the substantive rank of lieutenant general on 26 July 1883, he became Commander-in-Chief, India, on 28 November 1885 and was advanced to Knight Commander of the Order of the Indian Empire (KCIE) on 15 February 1887 and to Knight Grand Commander of the Order of the Indian Empire (GCIE) on reorganisation of the Order on 21 June 1887. This was followed by his promotion to a supernumerary general on 28 November 1890 and to the substantive rank of general on 31 December 1891. On 23 February 1892, he was created Baron Roberts, of Kandahar in Afghanistan and of the City of Waterford.

==Ireland==
After relinquishing his Indian command and becoming Knight Grand Commander of the Order of the Star of India (GCSI) on 3 June 1893, Roberts was relocated to Ireland as Commander-in-Chief of British forces there from 1 October 1895. He was promoted field marshal on 25 May 1895 and created a knight of the Order of St Patrick in 1897.

While in Ireland, Roberts completed a memoir of his years in India, which was published in 1897 as &quot;Forty-one Years in India: from Subaltern to Commander-in-chief&quot;.

==Second Anglo-Boer War==

On 23 December 1899 Roberts left England to return to South Africa with his chief of staff Lord Kitchener on the RMS &quot;Dunottar Castle&quot; to take overall command of British forces in the Second Boer War, subordinating the previous commander, General Redvers Buller. He arrived in Cape Town on 10 January 1900. His appointment was a response to a string of defeats in the early weeks of the war and was accompanied by the despatch of huge reinforcements. For his headquarters staff, he appointed military men from far and wide: Kitchener (Chief of Staff) from the Sudan, Frederick Burnham (Chief of Scouts), the American scout, from the Klondike, George Henderson from the Staff College, Neville Chamberlain from Afghanistan and William Nicholson (Military Secretary) from Calcutta. Roberts launched a two-pronged offensive, personally leading the advance across the open veldt into the Orange Free State, while Buller sought to eject the Boers from the hills of Natal – during which Lord Roberts&#x27; son was killed, earning a posthumous V.C.

Having raised the Siege of Kimberley, at the Battle of Paardeberg on 27 February 1900 Roberts forced the Boer General Piet Cronjé to surrender with some 4,000 men. After another victory at Poplar Grove, Roberts captured the Free State capital Bloemfontein on 13 March. His further advance was delayed by his disastrous attempt to reorganise his army&#x27;s logistic system on the Indian Army model in the midst of the war. The resulting chaos and shortage of supplies contributed to a severe typhoid epidemic that inflicted far heavier losses on the British forces than they suffered in combat.

On 3 May, Roberts resumed his offensive towards the Transvaal, capturing its capital Pretoria on 31 May. Having defeated the Boers at Diamond Hill and linked up with Buller, he won the last victory of his career at Bergendal on 27 August.
Strategies devised by Roberts, to force the Boer commandos to submit, included concentration camps and the burning of farms. Conditions in the concentration camps, which had been conceived by Roberts as a form of control of the families whose farms he had destroyed, began to degenerate rapidly as the large influx of Boers outstripped the ability of the small British force to cope. The camps lacked space, food, sanitation, medicine, and medical care, leading to rampant disease and a very high death rate for those Boers who entered. By the war&#x27;s end, 26,370 women and children (81% were children) had died in the concentration camps. For a brief period in 1900, Roberts also authorised the army&#x27;s use of civilian hostages for the protection of trains from Boer guerrilla units.

With the Boer republics&#x27; main towns occupied, and the war apparently effectively over, on 12 December 1900 Roberts handed over command to Lord Kitchener. Roberts returned to England to receive yet more honours: he was made a Knight Companion of the Order of the Garter and also created Earl Roberts, of Kandahar in Afghanistan and Pretoria in the Transvaal Colony and of the City of Waterford, and Viscount St Pierre.

He became a Knight of Grace of the Order of St John on 11 March 1901 and then a Knight of Justice of that order on 3 July 1901. He was also awarded the German Order of the Black Eagle during the Kaiser&#x27;s visit to the United Kingdom in February 1901. He was among the original recipients of the Order of Merit in the 1902 Coronation Honours list published on 26 June 1902, and received the order from King Edward VII at Buckingham Palace on 8 August 1902.

==Later life==
Lord Roberts became the last Commander-in-Chief of the Forces on 3 January 1901. During his time in office he introduced the Short Magazine Lee Enfield Rifle and the 18-pounder gun and provided improved education and training for his soldiers. In September 1902, Lord Roberts and St John Brodrick, Secretary of State for War, visited Germany to attend the German army manoeuvres as guest of the Emperor Wilhelm. He served as Commander-in-Chief for three years before the post was abolished as recommended by Lord Esher in the Esher Report in February 1904.

He was the initial president of the Pilgrims Society during 1902.

===National Service League===

Following his return from the Boer War, he was instrumental in promoting the mass training of civilians in rifle shooting skills through membership of shooting clubs, and a facsimile of his signature appears to this day on all official targets of the National Smallbore Rifle Association.

In retirement he was a keen advocate of introducing compulsory military training in Britain to prepare for a great European war. He campaigned for this as president of the National Service League, holding the post from 1905 until 1914. In 1907 a selection of his speeches was published under the title &quot;A Nation in Arms&quot;. Roberts provided William Le Queux with information for his novel &quot;The Invasion of 1910&quot; and checked the proofs. In 1910 Roberts&#x27; friend Ian Hamilton, in co-operation with the Secretary of State for War, Richard Haldane, published &quot;Compulsory Service&quot;, in which he attacked Roberts&#x27; advocacy of compulsory military training. This caused much hurt to Roberts. He replied, with the help of Leo Amery and J. A. Cramb, with &quot;Fallacies and Facts&quot; (1911).

In a speech in Manchester&#x27;s Free Trade Hall on 22 October 1912, Roberts pointed out that Cobden and Bright&#x27;s prediction that peace and universal disarmament would follow the adoption of free trade had not happened. He further warned of the threat posed by Germany:

He claimed that Germany was making enormous efforts to prepare for war and ended his speech by saying:

The historian A. J. A. Morris claimed that this speech caused a sensation due to Roberts&#x27; warnings about Germany. It was much criticised by the Liberal and Radical press. The &quot;Manchester Guardian&quot; condemned the

&quot;The Nation&quot; claimed Roberts had an &quot;unimaginative soldier&#x27;s brain&quot; and that Germany was &quot;a friendly Power&quot; who since 1870 &quot;has remained the most peaceful and the most self-contained, though doubtless not the most sympathetic, member of the European family&quot;. The historian John Terraine, writing in 1993, said: &quot;At this distance of time the verdict upon Lord Robert&#x27;s Manchester speech must be that, in speaking out clearly on the probability of war, he was doing a patriotic service comparable to Churchill&#x27;s during the Thirties&quot;.

===Kandahar ski race===
Roberts became vice-president of the Public Schools Alpine Sports Club during 1903. Eight years later on 11 January 1911, the Roberts of Kandahar Challenge Cup (so named because Roberts donated the trophy cup) was organised at Crans-Montana (Crans-sur-Sierre) by winter sports pioneer Arnold Lunn. An important part of the history of skiing, the races was a forerunner of the downhill ski race. The Kandahar Ski Club, founded by Lunn, was named after the Cup and subsequently lent its name to the Arlberg-Kandahar ski race. The name Kandahar is still used for the premier races of the FIS Alpine Ski World Cup circuit.

He took part in the funeral processions following the deaths of Queen Victoria in January 1901 and King Edward VII in May 1910.

===Curragh incident===
Roberts was approached for advice about the Ulster Volunteer Force, formed in January 1913 by Ulstermen who had no wish to be part of a Home Rule Ireland. Too old himself to take active command, Roberts recommended Lieutenant General Sir George Richardson, formerly of the Indian Army, as commander.

On the morning of 20 March – the morning of Paget&#x27;s speech which provoked the Curragh incident, in which Hubert Gough and other officers threatened to resign rather than coerce Ulster – Roberts, aided by Wilson, drafted a letter to the Prime Minister, urging him not to cause a split in the army.

Roberts had asked the Chief of the Imperial General Staff (CIGS) John French to come and see him at Ascot on 19 March; French was too busy but invited Roberts to visit him when next in London. On the morning of 21 March Roberts and French had an acrimonious telephone conversation in which Roberts told French that he would share the blame if he collaborated with the Cabinet&#x27;s &quot;dastardly&quot; attempt to coerce Ulster, and then, after French told him that he would &quot;do his duty as a soldier&quot; and obey lawful orders, put the phone down on him. Soon after, Roberts received a telegram from Hubert Gough, purporting to ask for advice, although possibly designed to goad him into further action. Roberts requested an audience with King George V, who told him that the Secretary of State for War, Jack Seely, with whom the King had recently spoken, had complained that Roberts was &quot;at the bottom&quot; of the matter, had incited Gough, and had called the politicians &quot;swine and robbers&quot; in his telephone conversation with French. Roberts indignantly denied this, claiming that he had not been in contact with Gough for &quot;years&quot; and that he had advised officers not to resign. Roberts&#x27; claim may not be the whole truth, as Gough was on first-name terms with Roberts&#x27; daughter and later gave her copies of key documents relating to the incident.

Roberts also had an interview with Seely (he was unable to locate French, who was in fact himself having an audience with the King at the time) but came away thinking him &quot;drunk with power&quot;, although he learned that Paget had been acting without authority (in talking of &quot;commencing active operations&quot; against Ulster and in offering officers a chance to discuss hypothetical orders and to threaten to resign) and left a note for Hubert Gough to this effect. This note influenced the Gough brothers in being willing to remain in the Army, albeit with a written guarantee that the Army would not have to act against Ulster. After Roberts&#x27; lobbying, the King insisted that Asquith make no further troop movements in Ulster without consulting him.

Roberts wrote to French on 22 March denying the &quot;swine and robbers&quot; comment, although French&#x27;s reply stressed his hurt that Roberts had thought so ill of him.

===Death===
Roberts died of pneumonia at St Omer, France, on 14 November 1914 while visiting Indian troops fighting in the First World War. His body was taken to Ascot by special train for a funeral service on 18 November before being taken to London. After lying in state in Westminster Hall (one of only two people who were not members of the royal family to do so during the 20th century, the other being Sir Winston Churchill), he was given a state funeral and was then buried in St. Paul&#x27;s Cathedral.

Roberts had lived at Englemere House at Ascot in Berkshire. His estate was probated during 1915 at £77,304 (equivalent to £ as of 2022).

==Honours==
On 28 February 1908 he was awarded the Volunteer Officers&#x27; Decoration in recognition of his honorary service in the Volunteer Force.

His long list of honorary military posts included: honorary colonel of the 2nd London Corps from 24 September 1887, honorary colonel of the 5th Battalion, the Sherwood Foresters (Derbyshire Regiment) from 29 December 1888, honorary colonel of the 1st Newcastle upon Tyne (Western Division), Royal Artillery, from 18 April 1894, honorary colonel of the Waterford Artillery (Southern Division) from 4 March 1896, colonel-commandant of the Royal Artillery from 7 October 1896, honorary colonel of the 3rd Battalion, Loyal North Lancashire Regiment, from 1 January 1898, honorary colonel of the City of London Imperial Volunteers from 10 March 1900, honorary colonel of the 3rd Volunteer Battalion, the Gloucestershire Regiment, from 5 September 1900, colonel of the Irish Guards from 17 October 1900, honorary colonel of the 2nd Hampshire (Southern Division), Royal Garrison Artillery, from 15 August 1901, honorary colonel of the 3rd (Dundee Highland) Volunteer Battalion, the Black Watch (Royal Highlanders), from 19 September 1903, honorary colonel of the North Somerset Yeomanry from 1 April 1908, honorary colonel of the 6th Battalion, the City of London (Rifles&#x27;) Regiment, from 1 April 1908, honorary colonel of the 1st Wessex Brigade from 1 April 1908, honorary colonel of 6th Battalion, The Gloucestershire Regiment, from 1 April 1908, honorary colonel of The Waterford Royal Field Reserve Artillery from 2 August 1908, and honorary colonel of 1st (Hull) Battalion, The East Yorkshire Regiment, from 11 November 1914 (three days before his death).

==Family==
Roberts married Nora Henrietta Bews, the daughter of Captain John Bews on 17 May 1859. The couple suffered repeated &quot;great sorrow&quot; with the deaths of their first three children, two daughters and a son, in infancy, but two more daughters and a son survived to adulthood.

* Nora Frederica Roberts (10 March 1860 – 3 March 1861), born and died at Simla
* Eveleen Sautelle Roberts (18 July 1868 – 8 February 1869), born at Royal York Crescent, Bristol, and died aboard SS &quot;Helvetia&quot; en route to Alexandria 
* Frederick Henry Roberts (27 July 1869 – 20 August 1869), born and died at Simla
* Aileen Mary Roberts (20 September 1870 – 9 October 1944)
* Frederick Hugh Sherston Roberts (8 January 1872 – 17 December 1899)
* Ada Edwina Stewart Roberts (28 March 1875 – 21 February 1955)

Roberts&#x27; surviving son, the Hon. Frederick Roberts, was killed in action on 17 December 1899 at the Battle of Colenso during the Boer War. Roberts and his son were one of only three pairs of fathers and sons to be awarded the VC. Today, their Victoria Crosses are in the National Army Museum. His barony and baronetcy became extinct, but, by the special remainder granted with them, he was succeeded in the earldom and viscountcy by his elder surviving daughter, Aileen. She was succeeded by her younger sister, Ada Edwina.

==Legacy==

In March 1898, a statue of Lord Roberts, sculpted by Harry Bates, was unveiled on the Maidan in Calcutta. The statue of Roberts on horseback sits on a pedestal with reliefs on each side depicting Sikh, Highlander and Gurkha cavalry and infantry, and statues of Britannia/Victory and India/Fortitude in front and behind. After the statue was commissioned, Roberts started sitting for the sculptor in 1894 and a bust was displayed at the Royal Academy of Arts in 1896.

After Roberts&#x27; death in 1914, money was raised to place a copy of the Calcutta statue as a memorial in Kelvingrove Park, Glasgow. Almost identical to the original statue, the memorial in Glasgow only includes minor changes like the inclusion of a quote from a speech Roberts gave in Glasgow in 1913 to promote national service. &quot;I seem to see the gleam in the near distance of the weapons and accoutrements of this Army of the future, this Citizen Army, the wonder of these islands, and the pledge of peace and of the continued greatness of this Empire.&quot; The memorial was unveiled by his widow.

A second copy of the statue was erected on Horse Guards Parade in London and unveiled in 1924. It is smaller and simpler than the other two, and sits on a simpler pedestal without the reliefs or extra figures. After Indian independence from the British Empire, the Roberts statue in Calcutta was moved with other statues to Barrackpore in the 1970s, and then by itself to the Artillery Centre, Nashik Road.

Roberts Barracks at Larkhill Garrison and the town of Robertsganj in Uttar Pradesh are named after him.

Lord Roberts French Immersion Public School in London, Ontario, Lord Roberts Junior Public School in Scarborough, Ontario, and Lord Roberts Elementary School in Vancouver, British Columbia, are named after him, as are the Lord Roberts neighbourhood and eponymous elementary school in the Fort Rouge ward of Winnipeg, Manitoba. Roberts is also a Senior Boys house at the Duke of York&#x27;s Royal Military School.

The Lord Roberts Centre – a facility at the National Shooting Centre built for the 2002 Commonwealth Games, and HQ of the National Smallbore Rifle Association (which Roberts was fundamental in founding) is named in his honour.

On 29 May 1900, Pretoria surrendered to the British commander-in-chief, Lord Roberts. Due to the prevalence of malaria and because the area had become too small, he relocated his headquarters from the vicinity of the Normal College to a high-lying site 10 km south-west of the city – hence the name Roberts Heights. Roberts Heights, a busy military town, the largest in South Africa and resembling Aldershot, soon developed. On 15 December 1938, the name was changed to Voortrekkerhoogte and again to Thaba Tshwane on 19 May 1998.

On a visit to the Victoria Falls, one of the larger islands just upstream of the Falls was named Kandahar Island in his honour.

The grave of Roberts&#x27; charger Vonolel (named after Vonolel (Vanhnuailiana), a Lushai King whose descendants Roberts had fought in 1871) is marked by a headstone in the gardens of The Royal Hospital Kilmainham, in Dublin.

Mount Roberts in British Columbia, Canada, was named in his honour in 1900.

<text>Saarijärvi is an impact structure mostly covered by a small lake by the same name. It is located about 40 km south from the town of Taivalkoski, Northern Ostrobothnia, Finland.

The impact origin of the structure was confirmed in 1997 when poorly developed planar deformation features (PDFs) in quartz grains were found in drill-core samples obtained from the bottom of the structure by a mining company while searching for diamonds in the region. Later amateur geologist Jarmo Moilanen also discovered shatter cones within the impact structure. Saarijärvi is the only currently accepted impact structure in the Fennoscandian Shield formed in Archean granitoid basement complex.

Most of the impact structure is filled by a sedimentary deposit, reaching a thickness of about 156 m in the center. It has a diameter of about 1.5 km, but shatter cones have been discovered in an area of about 2.2 km in diameter. The structure&#x27;s age has not been determined, but the oldest sediments from the drill-core are from the Ediacaran period, i.e. about 600 Ma (million years) old. The upper part of the sedimentary crater-fill sequence also includes Cambrian microfossils. It is currently unclear whether or not at least some of the lowermost sediments are actually pre-impact in origin, while the upper part of the sequence may have been deposited after the impact. In any case it seems certain that the impact structure is younger than 1980 Ma (early Proterozoic), which is the age of the youngest metadolerite dikes in the region, apparently truncated by the Saarijärvi structure. Preliminary paleomagnetic measurements suggest an age of 1.2 Ga or 2.1 Ga (thousand million years), but these values are probably insignificant since the structure has been modified by tectonic processes. The cross-section of the structure is somewhat asymmetric with a deeper and steeper southern side compared to the northern one, which suggests tectonic modification rather than an oblique impact. An elongated island in the center of the structure also implies significant post-impact tectonic modification of the structure. Electromagnetic anomalies show that the Saarijärvi structure is slightly polygonal rather than actually circular. This is not uncommon for impact structures, and implies structural control (by pre-existing dominating fracture orientations in the target rock) during crater formation, although post-impact tectonic modification may also play a role.

<text>Benjamin Baker Moeur (December 22, 1869 – March 16, 1937) was an American physician who served as the fourth governor of Arizona.

==Biography==
Born in Decherd, Tennessee, Moeur attended medical school in Little Rock, Arkansas. After graduating in 1896, Moeur moved to Tempe, Arizona and started a medical practice. He was a representative for Maricopa County at the State of Arizona Constitution Convention in 1910. He also served on the Tempe School Board and served as the Secretary of the Board of Education for Arizona State Teacher&#x27;s College (the precursor to Arizona State University) in Tempe.

During Moeur&#x27;s governorship, he mobilized the Arizona National Guard to stop the construction on Parker Dam, which was being built primarily to divert more water to the Los Angeles area. The mobilization was partly an embarrassment, as the troops arrived via an antiquated steamboat, which became stranded. Its troops were rescued by workers from California working at the dam. Moeur&#x27;s primary motive, however, was later vindicated by the United States Supreme Court when it ruled that California and the Bureau of Reclamation were constructing Parker Dam illegally because the dam had never been properly authorized. Subsequent legislation rectified this error and construction continued apace.

Governor Moeur served two terms (1933–1937) and died 71 days after he left office. He died in Tempe, where he is buried at the Double Butte Cemetery.

==Personal life==
Moeur married Honor G. Anderson in 1896. His wife was the sister of Guess Eleanor Birchett who was known as &quot;the Bird Lady of Tempe&quot;.

==Legacy==
In 1939, as a WPA project, Tempe Normal School (later known as Arizona State University) constructed the B. B. Moeur Activity Building on the main Tempe campus. The building was originally the women&#x27;s activity center, later being remodeled and used as the university&#x27;s admissions office. The building now houses the Mars Space Flight Facility, a NASA-funded research center directed by Dr. Phil Christensen.

Dr. Moeur has been honored since 1901 by the now Arizona State University via the Moeur Award. The Moeur Award is given to the student or students with the highest academic standing in terms of GPA, and is thus also considered the equivalent to a Valedictorian Award (which is not directly offered by Arizona State).

<text>Saint Martin is an impact structure in Manitoba, Canada. It is located in the northern part of the Rural Municipality of Grahamdale, northwest of Lake St. Martin.

The impact structure is in diameter and its age was determined to be 227.8 ± 1.1 million years (Carnian stage of the Triassic) using the argon-argon dating technique. The crater is well preserved but poorly exposed at the surface as the whole region is covered by glacial drift.

== Hypothetical multiple impact event ==
It had previously been suggested by Geophysicist David Rowley of the University of Chicago, working with John Spray of the University of New Brunswick and Simon Kelley of the Open University, that the Saint Martin structure may have been part of a hypothetical multiple impact event which also formed the Manicouagan impact structure in northern Quebec, Rochechouart impact structure in France, Obolon&#x27; crater in Ukraine, and Red Wing crater in North Dakota. All of the impact structures had previously been known and studied, but their paleoalignment had never before been demonstrated. Rowley has said that the chance that these structures could be aligned like this due to chance are nearly zero.

<text>In computer networking, MILNET (fully Military Network) was the name given to the part of the ARPANET internetwork designated for unclassified United States Department of Defense traffic.

MILNET was physically separated from the ARPANET in 1983. The ARPANET remained in service for the academic research community, but direct connectivity between the networks was severed for security reasons. Gateways relayed electronic mail between the two networks. BBN Technologies built and managed both the MILNET and the ARPANET and the two networks used very similar technology. It is also known as &quot;Military Net.&quot;

During the 1980s the MILNET expanded as part of the Defense Data Network, a worldwide set of military networks running at different security levels. In the 1990s, MILNET became the NIPRNET.

<text>Serpent Mound crater, also known as the Serpent Mound Disturbance, is an eroded meteorite impact crater in Ohio, United States. It lies largely in Adams County, with the northern part mostly in Highland County, except for a small northeast part in Pike County.

It is classified as a complex crater because it features a central uplift, a transition zone, and a ring graben (a ring-shaped trough in the outer part of the crater). Although eroded, the original rim diameter has been estimated at and the age is estimated to be less than 320 million years (Mississippian or younger). However, a 2010 paper suggested that the maximum rim diameter is .

The crater is named after the Serpent Mound, an effigy mound, located on a plateau in Brush Creek Valley within the crater. European-American explorers had already noted the unusual terrain in the 19th century, and it is often speculated that the odd geological features inspired Native Americans to construct the mound at that location.

In 1980, the Serpent Mound Cryptoexplosive Structure was designated as a National Natural Landmark by the National Park Service.

<text>Antipope Eulalius (died 423) was antipope from December 418 to April 419. Elected in a dual election with Pope Boniface I, he eventually lost out to Boniface and became bishop of Napete.

==History==

Upon the death of Pope Zosimus on December 26, 418, the Urban prefect, Aurelius Anicius Symmachus, directed the people to proceed to a new election without disturbance. On the day of the funeral, partisans of the archdeacon Eulalius occupied the Lateran. Later that day, Eulalius arrived there with a crowd consisting of deacons, laity, and a few priests, and was elected pope. The new pope and his supporters remained at the church until Sunday, 29 December, for the ordination customarily took place on a Sunday.

Meanwhile, on Saturday after Eulalius had been elected, a majority of the priests of the church elected Boniface, who had previously been a councilor of Pope Innocent, and he too was consecrated on 29 December, at the Church of Saint Marcellus in the Campus Martius.

Prefect Symmachus warned both parties to keep the peace and, on December 29, wrote to the Emperor Honorius that Eulalius, who had been elected first and in due order, was in the right. The Emperor answered on 3 January 419, recognizing Eulalius as the rightful bishop of Rome. and ordering Boniface to be expelled from the city, and the troublemakers punished. Symmachus ordered the supporters of Boniface not to hold a planned procession, but they beat the messenger and held the procession nonetheless. They then attempted to forcibly enter the city, but had been driven out by an opposing mob. All this happened while Eulalius was celebrating the Epiphany mass at St. Peter&#x27;s. Boniface and his supporters remained at St. Paul&#x27;s-outside-the-Walls.

But Boniface&#x27;s supporters refused to concede defeat, and petitioned the Emperor, claiming irregularities in the election. In response, Honorius suspended his previous order on 15 January, and summoned both parties to appear before him, along with other Italian bishops, on 8 February. At that hearing, a final judgment was deferred to a second synod that would meet at Spoleto on 13 June. Honorius sent private letters to several of the more important prelates, e.g. Paulinus of Nola, Augustine, and Aurelius of Carthage, and circular letters to the bishops of Africa and Gaul. All parties had been ordered to stay out of Rome, with the Easter services to be conducted by Achilleus, Bishop of Spoleto.

Despite this reversal, Eulalius&#x27;s position appeared to be the stronger, for he had the support of the Empress Galla Placidia and her husband Constantius, because he had been elected first. However, Stewart Oost believes this very strength led Eulalius to overconfidence. He returned to Rome 18 March to celebrate Easter Sunday, but this flouting of the Emperor&#x27;s orders lost him the support of these two powerful individuals; the inhabitants of Rome rioted, and the prefect Symmachus had his guard occupy the Lateran, where Eulalius had made his base, and escort Eulalius out of the city to a house and kept under guard. On 3 April, the Emperor officially recognized Boniface as the rightful Pope.

Eulalius subsequently became bishop of Napete. According to the &quot;Liber Pontificalis&quot;, Eulalius was deposed by a synod of 52 bishops and sent to Campania (a statement rejected by Baronius as inconsistent with contemporary documents); then, when Boniface died in 422, the people and clergy of Rome petitioned him to be the new Pope, but Eulalius refused their offer. The same source states he died one year later.

<doc id="780477" wikidata="Q7311363" url="?curid=780477" title="Religious images in Christian theology">
<text>Religious images in Christian theology have a role within the liturgical and devotional life of adherents of certain Christian denominations. The use of religious images has often been a contentious issue in Christian history. Concern over idolatry is the driving force behind the various traditions of aniconism in Christianity.

In the early Church, Christians used the Ichthys (fish) symbol to identify Christian places of worship and Christian homes. The Synod of Elvira (306 AD - 312 AD) &quot;prohibited the exhibition of images in churches&quot;. However, since the 3rd century AD, images have been used within Christian worship within parts of Christendom, although some ancient Churches, such as the Church of the East, have apparently long traditions of not using images. However, there is also both literary and archaeological evidence for the early presence of images in the Church of the East tradition.

Certain periods of Christian history have seen supporters of aniconism in Christianity, first with the movement of Byzantine Iconoclasm, in which Eastern Orthodox and Byzantine Emperors Michael II, as well as Theophilos, &quot;banned veneration of icons and actively persecuted supporters of icons.&quot; Later, during the Iconoclastic Fury, Calvinists removed statues and sacred art from churches that adopted the Reformed faith.

The church father John of Damascus argued &quot;that God&#x27;s taking on human form sanctified the human image, noting that the humanity of Christ formed an image of God; therefore, artists could use human images to depict the incarnate Word as well as human saints.&quot; As such, religious imagery today, in the form of statues, is most identified with the Roman Catholic and Lutheran traditions. Two dimensional icons are used extensively, and are most often associated with parts of Eastern Christianity, although they are also used by Roman Catholics, Lutherans, and, increasingly, Anglicans. Since the 1800s, devotional art has become very common in Christian homes, both Protestant and Catholic, often including wall crosses, embroidered verses from the Christian Bible, as well as imagery of Jesus. In Western Christianity, it is common for believers to have a home altar, while dwelling places belonging to communicants of the Eastern Christian Churches often have an icon corner.

A cult image is a human-made object that is venerated or worshipped for the deity, person or spirit that it embodies or represents. It is also controversially and pejoratively used by some Protestants, particularly certain Anabaptist and Reformed Christians, to describe the Eastern Orthodox (and, to a lesser extent, Catholic) practice of worshipping God through the use of icons, a charge which these Christians reject. In a similarly controversial sense, it is also used by these Protestants to pejoratively describe various Catholic devotional practices such as scapulars and the veneration of statues and flat images of the Virgin Mary and other saints, which Catholics do not consider idolatry.

== Jewish origins ==
Idolatry is prohibited by many verses in the Old Testament, but there is no one section that clearly defines idolatry. Rather there are a number of commandments on this subject spread through the books of the Hebrew Bible, some of which were written in different historical eras, in response to different issues. Idolatry in the Hebrew Bible is defined as the worship of idols (or images); the worship of polytheistic gods by use of idols (or images) and even the use of idols in the worship of Yahweh (God).

The Israelites used various images in connection with their worship, including carved cherubim on the Ark of the Covenant () which God instructed Moses to make, and the embroidered figures of cherubim on the curtain which separated the Holy of Holies in the Tabernacle tent (). Similarly, the Nehushtan, which God commanded Moses to make and lift high to cure any Israelites who looked at it of snakebites, is God-ordained use of an image. However, as part of a later religious reform Hezekiah destroyed the Serpent, which the Hebrew people had been burning incense to ().

==New Testament==

Judaism&#x27;s animosity towards what they perceived as idolatry was inherited by Jewish Christianity. Although Jesus discussed the Mosaic Law in the Sermon on the Mount, he does not speak of issues regarding the meaning of the commandment against idolatry. His teachings, however, uphold that worship should be directed to God alone (Matthew 4:10 which is itself a quote of Deuteronomy 6:13, see also Shema in Christianity, Great Commandment, and Ministry of Jesus).

The Pauline Epistles contain several admonitions to &quot;flee from idolatry&quot; (, , , , , , ) A major controversy among Early Christians concerned whether it was permissible to eat meat that had been offered in pagan worship. Paul of Tarsus, who agreed to the Apostolic Decree, also wrote that it was permitted to do so, as long as a blessing was pronounced over it, and provided that scandal was not caused by it. However, he said that the gods worshiped in idolatry were in his belief demons, and that any act of direct participation in their worship remained forbidden (1 Corinthians 10:14-22). See also the Law of Christ.

The New Testament also uses the term &quot;idolatry&quot; to refer to worship like passion for things such as wealth, as in Colossians 3:5, &quot;Put to death, therefore, whatever belongs to your earthly nature: sexual immorality, impurity, lust, evil desires and greed which is idolatry.&quot; Some Christian theologians see the absolutization of an idea as idolatrous. Therefore, undue focus on particular features of Christianity to the exclusion of others would constitute idolatry.

The New Testament does contain the rudiments of an argument which provides a basis for religious images or icons. Jesus was visible, and orthodox Christian doctrine maintains that Jesus is YHWH incarnate. In the Gospel of John, Jesus stated that because his disciples had seen him, they had seen God the Father (Gospel of John 14:7-9 ). Paul of Tarsus referred to Jesus as the &quot;image of the invisible God&quot; (Colossians 1:15). Theologians such as John of Damascus argued that the connection between Jesus&#x27; incarnation and the use of images is so strong that to reject or prohibit the use of images is tantamount to denying the Incarnation of Jesus.

Early Christianity grew in a society where religious images, usually in the form of statues, both large ones in temples and small ones such as lares and penates in the home, were a prominent feature of traditional pagan religions, such as traditional Ancient Roman religion, Ancient Greek religion and other forms of Eastern paganism. Many writings by Church fathers contain strong denunciations of these practices, which seem to have included outright idol-worship. Statues on secular buildings, however, could serve as expression of secular power in various periods of Christianity, without implications of idol-worship.

==The use of icons and symbols in Christian worship==
Early Christian art used symbolic and allegorical images mainly, partly no doubt to avoid drawing attention during the persecution of early Christians in the Roman Empire. In the Catacombs of Rome Jesus was represented indirectly by pictogram symbols such as the Ichthys (&quot;fish&quot;), peacock, Lamb of God, or an anchor (the Labarum or &quot;Chi-Rho&quot; was a later development). Later, personified symbols were used, including Jonah, whose three days in the belly of the whale pre-figured the interval between Christ&#x27;s death and Resurrection, Daniel in the lion&#x27;s den, or Orpheus charming the animals.

The image of &quot;The Good Shepherd&quot;, a beardless youth in pastoral scenes collecting sheep, was the most common of these images, and was probably not understood as a portrait of the historical Jesus. The depiction of Jesus already from the 3rd century included images very similar to what became the traditional image of Jesus, with a longish face and long straight hair. As the Church increased in size and popularity, the need to educate illiterate converts led to the use of pictures which portrayed biblical stories, along with images of saints, angels, prophets, and the Cross (though only portrayed in a bejewelled, glorified state).

After the end of persecution, and the adoption of Christianity by Constantine, large churches were built and from the start decorated with elaborate images of Jesus and saints in mosaic. Small carved reliefs were also found on sarcophagi like the Sarcophagus of Junius Bassus. However large monumental sculpture of religious subjects was not produced, and in Byzantine art and Eastern Orthodox art it is avoided to the current day. It only reappeared in Carolingian art, among peoples who had no memory of pagan religious statues.

Paintings of Old Testament scenes are found in Jewish catacombs of the same period, and the heavily painted walls of Dura Europos Synagogue in Syria. Catholic and Orthodox historians affirm, on the basis of these archeological finds in the Catacombs, that the veneration of icons and relics had begun well before Constantine I.

Christian use of relics also dates to the catacombs, when Christians found themselves praying in the presence of the bodies of martyrs, sometimes using their tombs as altars for sharing the Eucharist, which was, and in Catholicism, Lutheranism and Eastern Orthodoxy is, the central act of Christian worship. Many stories of the earliest martyrs end with an account of how Christians would gather up the martyr&#x27;s remains, to the extent possible, in order to retain the martyr&#x27;s relics. This is shown in the written record of the martyrdom of Saint Polycarp, a personal disciple of Saint John the Apostle.

Significant periods of iconoclasm (deliberate destruction of icons) have occurred in the history of the Church, the first major outbreak being the Byzantine iconoclasm (730-787), motivated by a strictly literal interpretation of the second commandment and interaction with Muslims who have a very strict teachings against the creation of images. Iconoclasm was officially condemned by the Western and Eastern Churches at the Second Council of Nicaea in 787 AD (the Western Church was not represented, but approved the decrees later).

This decision was based on the arguments including that the biblical commandment forbidding images of God was because no-one had seen God. But, by the Incarnation of Jesus, who is God incarnate in visible matter, humankind has now seen God. It was therefore argued that they were not depicting the invisible God, but God as He appeared in the flesh.

The Libri Carolini are a response prepared in the court of Charlemagne, when under the mistaken impression that the Nicea Council had approved the worship as opposed to the veneration of images.

=== Different understandings of the use of images ===

==== Catholicism ====
Catholics use images, such as the crucifix, the cross, in religious life and pray using depictions of saints. They also venerate images and liturgical objects by kissing, bowing, and making the sign of the cross. They point to the Old Testament patterns of worship followed by the Hebrew people as examples of how certain places and things used in worship may be treated with reverence or venerated, without worshiping them. The Ark of the Covenant was treated with great reverence and included images of cherubim on top of it (), and certain miracles were associated with it, yet this was not condemned as it was commissioned by the God of Israel Himself for the manifestation of His presence as well as physical manifestations of His Judgement and Glory.

Catholicism interprets the commandment not to make &quot;any graven image, or any likeness of any thing that is in heaven above&quot; to mean to not &quot;bow down and worship&quot; the image in and of itself nor a false god through the image. Catholic theology offers the following explanations of liturgical practice that features images, icons, statues, and the like:

* Gregory the Great wrote, &quot;...it is one thing to adore an image, it is quite another thing to learn from the appearance of a picture what we must adore. What books are to those who can read, that is a picture to the ignorant who look at it; in a picture even the unlearned may see what example they should follow; in a picture they who know no letters may vet read. Hence, for barbarians especially a picture takes the place of a book.&quot;
* Thomas Aquinas said, (Summa, III, 25, 3), but &quot;no reverence is shown to Christ&#x27;s image, as a thing---for instance, carved or painted wood: because reverence is not due save to a rational creature&quot;. In the case of an image of a saint, the &quot;worship&quot; would not be &quot;latria&quot; but rather &quot;dulia&quot;, while the Blessed Virgin Mary receives &quot;hyperdulia&quot;. The worship of whatever type, &quot;latria&quot;, &quot;hyperdulia&quot;, or &quot;dulia&quot;, can be considered to go through the icon, image, or statue: &quot;The honor given to an image reaches to the prototype&quot; (St. John Damascene in Summa ³). Adrian Fortescue sums up Church teaching: &quot;We should give to relics, crucifixes and holy pictures a relative honour, as they relate to Christ and his saints and are memorials of them. We do not pray to relics or images, for they can neither see nor hear nor help us.&quot;
* Both the literal worship of an inanimate object and &quot;latria&quot;, or sacrificial worship to something or someone that is not God, are forbidden; yet such are not the basis for Catholic worship. The Catholic knows &quot;that in images there is no divinity or virtue on account of which they are to be worshipped, that no petitions can be addressed to them, and that no trust is to be placed in them. . . that the honour which is given to them is referred to the objects (&quot;prototypa&quot;) which they represent, so that through the images which we kiss, and before which we uncover our heads and kneel, we adore Christ and venerate the Saints whose likenesses they are&quot; (Council of Trent, Sess. XXV, &quot;de invocatione Sanctorum&quot;).

The Catholic Church states that idolatry is consistently prohibited in the Hebrew Bible, including as one of the Ten Commandments () and in the New Testament (for example , most significantly in the Apostolic Decree recorded in ). There is a great deal of controversy over the question of what constitutes idolatry and this has bearing on the visual arts and the use of icons and symbols in worship, and other matters. As in other Abrahamic religions the meaning of the term has been extended very widely by theologians. The &quot;Catechism of the Catholic Church&quot; states: &quot;Idolatry not only refers to false pagan worship...Man commits idolatry whenever he honours and reveres a creature in place of God, whether this be gods or demons (for example satanism), power, pleasure, race, ancestors, the state, money etc.&quot; Speaking of the effects of idolatry, Benedict XVI says, &quot;Worship of an idol, instead of opening the human heart to Otherness, to a liberating relationship that permits the person to emerge from the narrow space of his own selfishness to enter the dimensions of love and of reciprocal giving, shuts the person into the exclusive and desperate circle of self-seeking&quot;

==== Lutheran and Orthodox ====
A recent joint Lutheran-Orthodox statement made in the 7th Plenary of the Lutheran-Orthodox Joint Commission, in July 1993 in Helsinki, reaffirmed the Ecumenical Council decisions on the nature of Christ and the veneration of images:

7. As Lutherans and Orthodox we affirm that the teachings of the ecumenical councils are authoritative for our churches. The ecumenical councils maintain the integrity of the teaching of the undivided Church concerning the saving, illuminating/justifying and glorifying acts of God and reject heresies which subvert the saving work of God in Christ. Orthodox and Lutherans, however, have different histories. Lutherans have received the Nicaeno?Constantinopolitan Creed with the addition of the filioque. The Seventh Ecumenical Council, the Second Council of Nicaea in 787, which rejected iconoclasm and restored the veneration of icons in the churches, was not part of the tradition received by the Reformation. Lutherans, however, rejected the iconoclasm of the 16th century, and affirmed the distinction between adoration due to the Triune God alone and all other forms of veneration (CA 21). Through historical research this council has become better known. Nevertheless it does not have the same significance for Lutherans as it does for the Orthodox. Yet, Lutherans and Orthodox are in agreement that the Second Council of Nicaea confirms the christological teaching of the earlier councils and in setting forth the role of images (icons) in the lives of the faithful reaffirms the reality of the incarnation of the eternal Word of God, when it states: &quot;The more frequently, Christ, Mary, the mother of God, and the saints are seen, the more are those who see them drawn to remember and long for those who serve as models, and to pay these icons the tribute of salutation and respectful veneration. Certainly this is not the full adoration in accordance with our faith, which is properly paid only to the divine nature, but it resembles that given to the figure of the honored and life?giving cross, and also to the holy books of the gospels and to other sacred objects&quot; (Definition of the Second Council of Nicaea).
Martin Luther read the commandment that one should make no graven images, and he applied that to any image. He said that if someone made an image of something in heaven, on the earth, or below the earth, then he is breaking the commandment and is guilty of idolatry. He certainly rejected the cult of saints, but he did not see pictures and statues as dangerous in themselves agreeing to the use of &quot;importance of images as tools for instruction and aids to devotion&quot;. He stated that &quot;If it is not a sin but good to have the image of Christ in my heart, why should it be a sin to have it in my eyes?&quot; He permitted the commissioning of new Lutheran altarpieces, including those of the Last Supper. The &quot;Schneeberg Altarpiece&quot; was placed at the high altar of St. Wolfgang&#x27;s Church, Schneeberg and as Lutheran sacred imagery, reflects &quot;the devotional forms of fifteenth- and early sixteenth century northern art&quot;. Lutheran sacred art, however, gained a new function in addition to exciting one&#x27;s mind to thoughts of the Divine by also serving a didactic purpose. He saw the Evangelical Lutheran Church as a continuation of the &quot;ancient, apostolic church&quot; and Lutherans therefore continued to worship in pre-Reformation churches, generally with few alterations to the interior.
==== Methodism ====
Writing for the United Methodist Church, Tricia Brown discusses the importance of sacred art:

The Methodist Modern Art Collection is housed by the Methodist Church of Great Britain, and the Secretary of the Methodist Conference, the Revd Canon Gareth J Powell, writes that it features &quot;vibrant expressions of God&#x27;s love, and a whole range of conversations that are both missional and pastoral&quot;.

==== Calvinism ====

John Calvin, the progenitor of the Reformed tradition of Christianity that influenced the Continental Reformed, Congregational, Anglican and Presbyterian traditions, was always extremely hostile to all publicly displayed religious images, which were systematically destroyed by Calvinists, as in the Beeldenstorm in the Netherlands. Towards the end of the 16th century there were disputes between Lutherans and Calvinists, with the Lutherans offering strong opposition to Calvinist iconoclasm. Though both groupings did not object to book illustrations or prints of biblical events, or portraits of reformers, production of large-scale religious art virtually ceased in Protestant regions after about 1540, and artists shifted to secular subjects, ironically often including revived classical mythology.

The earliest catechisms of Reformed (Calvinist) Christianity, written in the 16th through 18th centuries, including the Heidelberg (1563), Westminster (1647) and Fisher&#x27;s (1765), included discussions in a question and answer format detailing how the creation of images of God (including Jesus) was counter to their understanding of the Second Commandment&#x27;s prohibition against creating images of worship in any manner. 20th century Calvinist theologian J. I. Packer, in Chapter 4 of his book &quot;Knowing God&quot;, writes that, &quot;Imagining God in our heads can be just as real a breach of the second commandment as imagining Him by the work of our hands.&quot; His overall concern is that &quot;The mind that takes up with images is a mind that has not yet learned to love and attend to God&#x27;s Word.&quot; In other words, image making relies on human sources rather than on divine revelation. Another typical Christian argument for this position might be that God was incarnate as a human being, not as an object of wood, stone or canvas, and therefore the only God-directed service of images permitted is the service of other people. During the period of Archbishop William Laud&#x27;s conflicts with Puritans within the Church of England, the use of ritual implements prescribed by the &quot;Book of Common Prayer&quot; was a frequent cause of conflict. (See vestments controversy)

=== Non-use by Amish ===
The Amish are an Anabaptist Christian group that forbids the use of images in secular life. In their critiques these groups argue that such practices are in effect little different from idolatry, and that they localize and particularize God, who, they argue, is beyond human depiction.

<text>Shoemaker (formerly known as Teague Ring) is an impact structure, the deeply eroded remnant of a former impact crater, situated in arid central Western Australia, about north-northeast of Wiluna. It is named in honour of planetary geologist Eugene Shoemaker.

== Description ==

The prominent ring-like topographic feature, easily seen in satellite images, lies on the boundary between the Palaeoproterozoic Earaheedy Basin and the Archaean Yilgarn Craton. The area contains a number of seasonal salt lakes, the largest being Lake Teague.

The first suggestion that the ring-like topographic feature may be an impact structure was published in 1974. Subsequent research revealed definitive evidence for this hypothesis, including the presence of shatter cones and shocked quartz. The feature has a central circular region of uplifted Archaean Granite (Teague Granite) about in diameter, surrounded by a downwarped ring (ring syncline) of sedimentary rocks with an outer limit of disturbance at about diameter, which is a minimum estimate of the size of the original crater.

The age of the impact event is uncertain. It must be younger than the Teague Granite in the centre, dated at 2648 ± 8 Ma (million years ago). The most commonly cited age of about 1630 Ma represents a re-heating event affecting the granite; while this may be the impact event it could simply be a regional tectonic event. More recent dating by K–Ar methods yield ages as young as 568 ± 20 Ma, this age could also date the impact event or represent tectonic activity.

<text>Rawghlie Clement Stanford (August 2, 1879 – December 15, 1963) was an American judge and politician who served as the fifth governor of Arizona from 1937 to 1939. He later served on the Arizona Supreme Court from 1943 until 1955, including three years as chief justice.

==Background==

Born in Buffalo Gap, Texas, he moved with his family to Phoenix, Arizona in 1881 where he attended public schools and the Arizona Normal School. Stanford served with the 34th U.S. Volunteers in the Philippines (1899–1901), during the Spanish–American War. He studied at the Tempe Normal School and the Stanford University School of Law. He was admitted to the territorial bar at Tombstone in 1905. Stanford married Ruth Butchee (1880–1957), in 1906. They had seven children.

In 1909, he moved his law practice to Phoenix. Elected judge of Maricopa County Superior Court in 1914, Stanford served two terms (1915–1922). He presided over the 1916 gubernatorial contest between Thomas E. Campbell and George W. P. Hunt. Although he was a Democrat, Stanford ruled in favor of Republican challenger Campbell. The Arizona Supreme Court later overturned this decision and awarded the Governorship to Hunt.

Stanford served on the Board of Education for Phoenix Union High School from 1920 to 1936, and was chairman of the State Democratic Central Committee from 1928 to 1929.

Stanford&#x27;s first foray into statewide politics came in 1920, when he ran against incumbent Senate Marcus A. Smith in the Democratic Primary. Stanford lost, coming in second place with 8,400 votes, to Smith&#x27;s 10,910. Stanford narrowly edged out fellow lawyer Albinus A. Worsley, who came in third at 7,474 votes, and fourth-place finisher John W. Norton, with 2,651 votes.

His second attempt at statewide politics came in fourteen years later, when he ran in the Democratic gubernatorial Primary of 1934. A unique election, the top three vote-getters in the Democratic primary were either the incumbent Governor, a future Governor and a former Governor. Benjamin Baker Moeur came in first with 34,792 votes (36%), while Stanford received 29,088 votes (30%), and former 7-term Governor George Hunt (who Stanford decided an election for in 1916) came in third with 27,849 votes (29%). State Senator James Minotto came in fourth with 4,448 votes (5%).

In 1936 Stanford finally won a primary, defeating incumbent Governor Moeur by a decisive twelve percent of the vote. Stanford won 53,219 votes (56%) to the incumbent Governor&#x27;s 41,764 (44%).

==Governorship==

On November 3, 1936, Stanford was elected Governor of Arizona, winning a landslide with 70.68% of the vote against former Republican Governor Thomas Edward Campbell who only received 29.11%. The tally was 87,678 to 36,114 votes, with 260 votes going to the Socialist candidate. On January 4, 1937, he was sworn into office. During his term, Stanford dealt with the restoration of Arizona&#x27;s economy, which deteriorated during the Great Depression. Declining to run for reelection in 1938, Stanford left office on January 2, 1939.

==Post-Governorship==

After a brief period in private law practice, he defeated Alfred C. Lockwood for a seat on the Arizona Supreme Court in 1943. Stanford served two terms (1943–1955) and retired as chief justice. He participated in more than 1,000 Supreme Court decisions, writing 200 of them. He was one of two men to serve as both Governor and chief justice of Arizona, the other being fellow Democrat Ernest McFarland.

Stanford was the state coordinator for the 1960 Kennedy-Johnson campaign and served as a presidential elector. The Democrats did not carry Arizona that year. He was involved in real estate as well. Stanford homesteaded and developed large tracts of land including a section north of the Arizona Canal and east of the Biltmore Hotel.

Stanford died December 15, 1963, and is buried in Greenwood/Memory Lawn Mortuary &amp; Cemetery in Phoenix, Arizona.

<text>Hans Karl August Simon Euler-Chelpin, since 28 July 1884 von Euler-Chelpin (15 February 1873 – 6 November 1964), was a German-born Swedish biochemist. He won the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1929 with Arthur Harden for their investigations on the fermentation of sugar and enzymes. He was a professor of general and organic chemistry at Stockholm University (1906–1941) and the director of its Institute for organic-chemical research (1938–1948). Euler-Chelpin was distantly related to Leonhard Euler. He married chemist Astrid Cleve, the daughter of the Uppsala chemist Per Teodor Cleve. In 1970, their son Ulf von Euler, was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine.

==Personal life==
Euler-Chelpin was born on 15 February 1873 at Augsburg, Germany to Rigas Georg Sebastian von Euler-Chelpin and Gabriele von Euler-Chelpin (née Furtner). His father was at the time captain in the Royal Bavarian Infantry Guard Regiment (&quot;Königlich Bayerisches Infanterie-Leib-Regiment&quot;), who was soon transferred to Munich and would finally become a lieutenant general (&quot;Generalleutnant&quot;). During his childhood, he spent most of his time with his grandmother at Wasserburg am Inn. He went to the Royal Junior High School in Augsburg (predecessor of Holbein Gymnasium ), also in Würzburg and Ulm. After serving as a one-year volunteer in the Bavarian first Field Artillery Regiment, he took interest in the color theory and began studying art at the Munich Academy of Painting (1891–1893). He was taught under Schmid-Reutte and Lenbach, a German painter of realist style. He thereafter went to attend the University of Berlin to study chemistry under Emil Fischer and A. Rosenheim, and physics under E. Warburg and Max Planck; where in 1895 he received his doctorate.

In 1899, von Euler-Chelpin was appointed to teach as Privatdozent in the Royal University at Stockholm where he began visiting the laboratory of van &#x27;t Hoff, one of the many who influenced Euler-Chelpin&#x27;s interest in science along with Nernst.

In 1902, he took Swedish citizenship, although keeping his German citizenship. Nevertheless, during the First World War, von Euler-Chelpin took part in voluntary service with the Imperial German Army in the artillery (&quot;1. Feldartillerie-Regiment&quot;) of the Bavarian Army, transferring to the Luftstreitkräfte in 1915, finally with the rank as captain (&quot;Hauptmann&quot;). During the Second World War, he worked in a diplomatic mission on the German side.

In 1906, he was appointed Professor of General and Organic Chemistry in the Royal University, Stockholm. In 1929, the Knut and Alice Wallenberg Foundation and the International Education Board of the Rockefeller Foundation established in Stockholm the Vitamin Institute and Institute of Biochemistry, and Euler-Chelpin was appointed as its director. In 1941 he retired from teaching, but continued his research.

Hans von Euler-Chelpin married twice. His first wife was Astrid Cleve, who was the first Swedish woman to obtain a doctoral degree of science. They had five children: Sten (1903–1991), Ulf Svante (1905–1983), Karin Maria (1907–2003), Hans Georg Rigas (1908–2003) and Birgit (1910–2000). In 1913 he married again to his second wife, Elisabeth &quot;Beth&quot; Baroness af Ugglas (1887–1973), whose participated in collaborations with Euler-Chelpin. They had four children: Rolf Sebastian Ugglas (1914–2005), Hans Roland Ugglas (1916–), Curt Leonhard Ugglas (1918–2001) and Johan Erik Ugglas &quot;Jan&quot; (1929–1954). His son, Ulf von Euler, was a well-known physiologist and in 1970 he received a Nobel Prize for his research on the chemical nature of norepinephrine on the synapses. In 1931, his daughter Karin von Euler-Chelpin married the writer Sven Stolpe and had four children with him (one of which was Lisette Schulman).

During his life, von Euler-Chelpin created a series of monographs such as &quot;Biochemistry of Tumours&quot;, written in collaboration with Boleslaw Skarzynski, published in 1942 and the other entitled &quot;The Chemotherapy and Prophylaxis of Cancer&quot;, published in 1962.

von Euler-Chelpin died in Stockholm on 6 November 1964, at the age of 91.

==Nobel Prize==
In 1929, Euler-Chelpin and Arthur Harden received the Nobel Prize in chemistry for research on alcoholic fermentation of carbohydrates and the role of enzymes. Arthur Harden dealt only with the chemical effects of bacteria from 1903 with alcoholic fermentation. Harden discovered that the enzyme zymase, discovered by Eduard Buchner, only produces fermentation in interaction with the coenzyme cozymase. Euler-Chelpin, in turn, convincingly described what happens in sugar fermentation and the action of fermentation enzymes using physical chemistry. This explanation led to the understanding of the important processes taking place in the muscles for the supply of energy.

<text>Thylacoleo (&quot;pouch lion&quot;) is an extinct genus of carnivorous marsupials that lived in Australia from the late Pliocene to the Late Pleistocene (until around 40,000 years ago), often known as marsupial lions. They were the largest and last members of the family Thylacoleonidae, occupying the position of apex predator within Australian ecosystems. The largest and last species, &quot;Thylacoleo carnifex&quot;, approached the weight of a lioness. The estimated average weight for the species ranges from .

==Taxonomy==
The first &quot;Thylacoleo&quot; fossil findings, discovered by Thomas Mitchell were found in the 1830s in the Wellington Valley of New South Wales, though not recognised as such at the time. The generic holotype, consisting of broken teeth, jaws, and a skull was discovered by a pastoralist, William Avery, near Lake Colungolac from which the species &quot;Thylacoleo carnifex&quot; was described by Richard Owen. It was not until 1966 that the first nearly-complete skeleton was found. The only pieces missing were a foot and the tail. Currently, the Nullarbor Plain of West Australia remains to be the greatest finding site. These fossils now reside at the Australian Museum.

The genus was first published in 1859, erected to describe the type species &quot;Thylacoleo carnifex&quot;. The new taxon was established in examination of fossil specimens provided to Richard Owen. The familial alliance takes its name from this description, the so-called marsupial lions of Thylacoleonidae.

The colloquial name &quot;marsupial lion&quot; alludes to the genus name, which was named after its superficial resemblance to the placental lion and its ecological niche as a large predator.

Genus: &quot;Thylacoleo&quot; (&quot;Thylacopardus&quot;) – Australia&#x27;s marsupial lions, that lived from about 2 million years ago, during the Late Pliocene Epoch and became extinct about 40,000 years ago, during the Late Pleistocene Epoch. Three species are known:

*&quot;Thylacoleo carnifex&quot; The holotype cranium was collected from Lake Colongulac in 1843 by pastoralist William Adeney. A partial rostrum collected by Adeney in 1876 from the same locality would later be found to belong to the same individual. It was not until 1966 that the first nearly-complete skeleton was found.
*&quot;Thylacoleo crassidentatus&quot; lived during the Pliocene, around 5 million years ago, and was about the size of a large dog. Its fossils have been found in southeastern Queensland.
*&quot;Thylacoleo hilli&quot; lived during the Pliocene and was half the size of &quot;T. crassidentatus&quot;. It is the oldest member of the genus.

Fossils of other representatives of Thylacoleonidae, such as &quot;Microleo&quot; and &quot;Wakaleo&quot;, date back to the Late Oligocene Epoch, some 24 million years ago.

&quot;T. hilli&quot; was described by Neville Pledge in a study published in the records of the South Australia Museum in 1977. The holotype is a third premolar, discovered at a cave in Curramulka in South Australia, exhibiting the carnivorous characteristics of the genus and around half the size of &quot;T. carnifex&quot;. This tooth was collected by Alan Hill, a speleologist and founding member of the Cave Exploration Group of South Australia, while examining a site known as the &quot;Town Cave&quot; in 1956; the specific epithet &quot;hilli&quot; honours the collector of the first specimen. Material found amidst the fauna at Bow River in New South Wales, dated to the early Pliocene, was also referred to the species in 1982.
A fragment of an incisor, unworn and only diagnosable to the genus, was located at a site in Curramulka, close to the Town Cave site, and referred to the species for the apparent correlation in size when compared to the better known &quot;T. carnifex&quot;.

The marsupial lion is classified in the order Diprotodontia along with many other well-known marsupials such as kangaroos, possums, and the koala. It is further classified in its own family, the Thylacoleonidae, of which three genera and 11 species are recognised, all extinct. The term marsupial lion (lower case) is often applied to other members of this family. Distinct possum-like characteristics led &quot;Thylacoleo&quot; to be regarded as members of Phalangeroidea for a few decades. Though a few authors continued to hint at phalangeroid affinities for thylacoleonids as recently as the 1990s, cranial and other characters have generally led to their inclusion within vombatiformes, and as stem-members of the wombat lineage. Marsupial lions and other ecologically and morphologically diverse vombatiforms were once represented by over 60 species of carnivorous, herbivorous, terrestrial and arboreal forms ranging in size from 3 kg to 2.5 tonnes. Only two families represented by four herbivorous species (koalas and three species of wombat) have survived into modern times and are considered the marsupial lion&#x27;s closest living relatives.

==Evolution==
The ancestors of thylacoleonids are believed to have been herbivores, something unusual for carnivores. They are members of the Vombatiformes, an almost entirely herbivorous order of marsupials, the only extant representatives of which are koalas and wombats, as well as extinct members such as the diprotodontids and palorchestids. The group first appeared in the Late Oligocene. The earliest thylacoleonids like &quot;Microleo&quot; were small possum-like animals, with the group increasing in size during the Miocene, with representatives like the leopard-sized &quot;Wakaleo.&quot; The genus &quot;Thylacoleo&quot; first appeared during the Pliocene, and represented the only extant genus of the family from that time until the end of the Pleistocene. The youngest representative of &quot;Thylacoleo&quot; and the thylacoleonids, &quot;T. carnifex&quot;, is the largest known member of the family. The earliest thylacoleonids are thought to have been arboreal (tree dwelling) animals, while &quot;Thylacoleo&quot; is thought to be terrestrial with some climbing capabilities.

==Description==

&quot;T. carnifex&quot; is the largest carnivorous mammal known to have ever existed in Australia, and one of the largest metatherian carnivores known (comparable to &quot;Thylacosmilus&quot; and &quot;Borhyaena&quot; species, but smaller than &quot;Proborhyaena gigantea&quot;). Individuals ranged up to around high at the shoulder and about from head to tail. Measurements taken from a number of specimens show they averaged in weight, although individuals as large as might not have been uncommon, and the largest weight was of . This would make it comparable to female lions and female tigers in general size. Estimates of the size of &quot;T. carnifex&quot; based on dental remains are typically dubious, in contrast to estimates based on proximal limb bone circumference.

=== Skull ===

Like other thylacoleonids, &quot;Thylacoleo&quot; had blade-like third premolar teeth in the upper and lower jaws, that functioned as the carnassial teeth, with these teeth being present much further forwards in the jaw than in other mammals. Compared to earlier thyacoleonids, the third premolars were considerably enlarged. &quot;Thylacoleo&quot; also had a proportionally large pair of first incisors in the upper and lower jaws, which functioned analogously to other carnivores canine teeth. They also had true canines but they served little purpose as they were stubby and not very sharp. Compared to earlier thylacoleonids, the number of molar teeth was reduced.

Pound for pound, &quot;T. carnifex&quot; had the strongest bite of any mammal species, living or extinct; a &quot;T. carnifex&quot; weighing had a bite comparable to that of a 250 kg African lion, and research suggests that &quot;Thylacoleo&quot; could hunt and take prey much larger than itself. Larger animals that were likely prey include &quot;Diprotodon&quot; spp. and giant kangaroos. It seems improbable that &quot;Thylacoleo&quot; could achieve as high a bite force as a modern-day lion; however, this might have been possible when taking into consideration the size of its brain and skull. Carnivores usually have rather large brains when compared to herbivorous marsupials, which lessens the amount of bone that can be devoted to enhancing bite force. &quot;Thylacoleo&quot; however, is thought to have had substantially stronger muscle attachments and therefore a smaller brain. Some later studies questioned the ability of the canine teeth to deliver a killing bite.

Using 3D modeling based on X-ray computed tomography scans, marsupial lions were found to be unable to use the prolonged, suffocating bite typical of living big cats. They instead had an extremely efficient and unique bite; the incisors would have been used to stab at and pierce the flesh of their prey while the more specialised carnassials crushed the windpipe, severed the spinal cord, and lacerated the major blood vessels such as the carotid artery and jugular vein. Compared to an African lion which may take 15 minutes to kill a large catch, the marsupial lion could kill a large animal in less than a minute. The skull was so specialized for big game that it was very inefficient at catching smaller animals, which possibly contributed to its extinction.

===Postcranium===

&quot;Thylacoleo&quot; had highly mobile and powerful forelimbs used to grapple prey, with each manus having a single very large retractable hooked claw set on large semi-opposable thumbs, which are suggested to have been used deal a killing blow.

The hind feet had four functional toes, the first digit being much reduced in size, but possessing a roughened pad similar to that of possums, which may have assisted with climbing. The discovery in 2005 of a specimen which included complete hind feet provided evidence that the marsupial lion exhibited syndactyly (fused second and third toes) like other diprotodonts.

Its strong forelimbs and retracting claws mean that &quot;Thylacoleo&quot; possibly climbed trees and perhaps carried carcasses to keep the kill for itself (similar to the leopard today). The climbing ability would have also helped them climb out of caves, which could therefore have been used as dens to rear their young. Specialised tail bones called chevrons strengthened the tail, likely allowing the animal to use it to prop itself up while rearing on its hind legs, which may have been done when climbing or attacking prey.

The lumbar region is relatively rigid and straight, and suggests that the lower back was relatively inflexible.

==Ecology==

When &quot;Thylacoleo&quot; was first described by Richard Owen, he considered it to be a carnivore, based on the morphology of its skull and teeth. However other anatomists, such as William Henry Flower disagreed. Flower was the first to place &quot;Thylacoleo&quot; with the Diprotodonts, noting its skull and teeth to be laid out more like those of the koala and the wombat, and suggested that it was more likely a herbivore. Owen did not disagree with Flower&#x27;s placement of &quot;Thylacoleo&quot; with the Diprotodonts, but still maintained that it was a carnivore, despite its herbivorous ancestry. Owen found little support in his lifetime, despite the pointing out of &quot;Thylacoleo&quot;&#x27;s retractable claws, something only found in mammalian carnivores, and its lack of any ability to chew plant material. In 1911, a study by Spencer and Walcott claimed that certain marks on the bones of megafauna had been made by &quot;Thylacoleo&quot;, but according to Horton (1979) they were not sufficiently rigorous, resulting in their arguments being strongly challenged by later scholars, such as Anderson (1929), and later Gill (1951, 1952, 1954), thereby leaving the issue unresolved.

Besides the most common hypothesis that it was an active predator, a variety of other theories existed in the late 19th to early 20th centuries as to the diet and feeding of &quot;Thylacoleo&quot;, with hypotheses of it being a scavenger filling the ecological niche of hyenas, being a specialist of crocodile eggs, or even a melon-eater. As late as 1954, doubts were still being raised as to whether it was actually a hypercarnivore.

In 1981, another paper was published arguing that certain cuts to bones of large marsupials had been caused by &quot;Thylacoleo&quot;. This paper by Horton and Wright was able to counter earlier arguments that such marks were the result of humans, largely by pointing out the presence of similar marks on the opposite side of many bones. They concluded that humans were extremely unlikely to have made the marks in question, but that if so &quot;they had set out to produce only marks consistent with what &quot;Thylacoleo&quot; would produce&quot;. Since then, the academic consensus has emerged that &quot;Thylacoleo&quot; was a predator and a hypercarnivore.

The marsupial lion&#x27;s limb proportions and muscle mass distribution indicate that, although it was a powerful animal, it was not a particularly fast runner. Paleontologists conjecture that it was an ambush predator, possibly using leaping. Incisions on bones of the extinct large kangaroo &quot;Macropus titan&quot;, and the general morphology of &quot;Thylacoleo&quot; suggests that it fed in a similar manner to modern cheetahs, by using their sharp teeth to slice open the ribcage of their prey, thereby accessing the internal organs. They may have killed by using their front claws as either stabbing weapons or as a way to grab their prey with strangulation or suffocation. 

Like many predators, it was probably also an opportunistic scavenger, feeding on carrion and driving off less powerful predators from their kills. It also may have shared behaviours exhibited by recent diprotodont marsupials such as kangaroos, like digging shallow holes under trees to reduce body temperature during the day.

Trace fossils in the form of claw marks and bones from caves in Western Australia analyzed by Gavin Prideaux et al. indicate marsupial lions could also climb rock faces, and likely reared their young in such caves as a way of protecting them from potential predators.

Analysis of finds on the Nullabor Plain suggests that &quot;Thylacoleo carnifex&quot; inhabited open, arid environments similar to those found across much of Australia today.

A 1985 study suggested that &quot;Thylacoleo carnifex&quot; was an apex predator that primarily fed on large bodied prey, which may have included the large kangaroos &quot;Sthenurus&quot;, &quot;Procoptodon, Protemnodon, Macropus&quot; and &quot;Ostphranter&quot; as well as possibly the largest Australian marsupial, the rhinoceros-sized vombatoid &quot;Diprotodon&quot;.
== Extinction ==

&quot;Thylacoleo&quot; is thought to have become extinct around 40,000 years ago as part of the Late Pleistocene megafauna extinctions, essentially simultanteously with the vast majority of Australian megafauna. It has been contested as to the relative importance of climatic change vs the impact of recently arrived Indigenous Australians (who arrived in Australia around 50-60,000 years ago) in the extinctions. There is limited evidence of human interaction with extinct megafauna in Australia.

<text>Herbert McLean Evans (September 23, 1882 – March 6, 1971) was an American anatomist and embryologist best known for co-discovering Vitamin E.

==Education==
He was born in Modesto, California. In 1908, he obtained his medical degree from Johns Hopkins University.

==Career==
Evans became associate professor of anatomy at Johns Hopkins University. Evans moved back to California in 1915 and was made professor of anatomy at the University of California, Berkeley, and held that position until his death.

His medical research at Berkeley addressed problems relating to human nutrition, endocrinology, embryology, and histology. In 1918, his research into the number of human chromosomes led him to believe the number to be 48, when most people assumed the number to be much higher. It was only later discovered that the correct figure was 46. Evans had much greater success however with hormones extracted from the anterior lobe of the pituitary gland. He isolated Human Growth Hormone, which is essential for human growth and development. In 1922 along with Katharine Scott Bishop, during feeding experiments on rats, he co-discovered Vitamin E which is needed for human reproduction. Evans became director of the Institute of Experimental Biology at Berkeley in 1931. With Gladys Anderson Emerson, he reported the isolation of the pure Vitamin E from wheat germ in 1937. He also determined the formula C29H50O2. Evans was also instrumental in developing reproductive systems research with Miriam Elizabeth Simpson and Choh Hao Li, by studying the oestrus cycle of rats.

Evans is also credited with developing Evans blue, a method which determines blood volume in humans and animals.

Evans took a strong interest in the history of science and was an active collector of rare books in the field. His collection was later acquired by the Harry Ransom Center at the University of Texas at Austin.

He died in Berkeley, California, aged 88.

<text>Robert Taylor Jones (February 8, 1884 – June 11, 1958) was an American businessman and politician who served as the sixth governor of the U.S. state of Arizona and served from 1939 to 1941.

==Early years==
He was born in Rutledge, Tennessee, to Samuel Joseph and Sara Elizabeth (Legg) Jones. His father was an American Civil War veteran from the Union side who was active in politics and in the affairs of his community.

Jones was educated in the Tennessee public schools, He began his career as a self-taught practical engineer, while still in his teens. He was involved in the building of a railroad through eastern Tennessee. The experience which he obtained was to his benefit when he went into business for himself as a small contractor. He participated in the construction of the Panama Canal for one year as a civil engineer.

==Businessman==
When Jones returned to the United States, he went to live in Los Angeles. Later he became involved in the construction of a railroad from Las Vegas to Salt Lake City.

In 1909, he came to the territory of Arizona and worked with the Globe and Gila Valley railroad. That year Jones met Elon Armstrong of Winkelman, Arizona, daughter of W. T. Armstrong, a pioneer Arizona cattleman and a one-time sheriff of Gila County. They were married in 1911 and purchased a house at 300 Main Street, in the town of Superior where they settled down. The couple had two children: Kathryn and Albert Claude.

Also in 1911, he founded the “Jones Drug Company”, a pharmacy which eventually became a chain of pharmacies with branches in Phoenix, Florence, Mesa, and Tucson.

==Political career==

On January 2, 1939, Jones became the 6th Governor of Arizona. He served as governor for one year until January 6, 1941, as a member of the Democratic Party. Prior to his becoming governor, Jones served as a State Senator from Maricopa County in the 13th Arizona State Legislature during 1937–1938. He also served two terms in the State Senate as the lone senator from Pinal County in the 10th and 11th Arizona State Legislatures.

==Later years==

Jones returned to his drug store business, however in 1953, he left the drug store business and started the Jones Western Wear store in Phoenix at 101 E. Washington, where his Phoenix pharmacy used to be. He also owned a cattle ranch near Chandler.

He died on June 11, 1958, in Phoenix, Arizona and is buried in Greenwood/Memory Lawn Mortuary &amp; Cemetery in Phoenix.

His house in Superior was converted into the Bob Jones Museum in March 1994. The displays in the museum are focused on local artifacts and include exhibits of photographs, mining equipment and geological samples.

<doc id="780506" wikidata="Q1233590" url="?curid=780506" title="Maurice Evans (actor)">
<text>Maurice Herbert Evans (3 June 1901 – 12 March 1989) was an English actor, noted for his interpretations of Shakespearean characters. His best-known screen roles include Dr. Zaius in the 1968 film &quot;Planet of the Apes&quot; and Maurice on &quot;Bewitched&quot;.

==Early years==
Evans was born at 28 Icen Way in Dorchester, Dorset. He was the son of Laura (Turner) and Alfred Herbert Evans, a Welsh dispensing chemist and keen amateur actor who made adaptations of novels by Thomas Hardy for the local amateur company. Young Maurice made his first stage appearance as a small boy in &quot;Far from the Madding Crowd&quot;.

He first appeared on the stage in 1926 at the Cambridge Festival Theatre and joined the Old Vic Company in 1934, playing Hamlet, Richard II, and Iago. He was selected by Terence Gray to appear in the opening production in November 1926 at the Festival Theatre, taking the role of Orestes in two parts of the sensational production of the &quot;Oresteia&quot; of Aeschylus. This was followed by Lord Belvoir in &quot;The Man Who Ate the Popomack&quot; by W. J. Turner, and Saint Anthony in Maeterlinck&#x27;s &quot;The Miracle of Saint Anthony&quot;.

In 1927, Evans played a poet in &quot;The Pleasure Garden&quot; by Beatrice Mayor followed by Young Man in &quot;On Baile&#x27;s Strand&quot; by W. B. Yeats, Midir in &quot;The Immortal Hour&quot; by Fiona Macleod, the Hon. Algernon Moodie in &quot;The Rumour&quot; by C.K. Munro, Mark Ingestire in &quot;Sweeney Todd&quot; by Dibdin Pitt, the poet in &quot;The Lost Silk Hat&quot; by Lord Dunsany, the Captain in &quot;Androcles and the Lion&quot; by George Bernard Shaw, Mister Four and Young Man in &quot;The Adding Machine&quot; by Elmer Rice, Don Juan in the play of the same title by James Elroy Flecker, two parts in Terence Gray&#x27;s own play &quot;The Red Nights of the Tcheka&quot;, the Stage Manager in &quot;The Player Queen&quot; (also by Yeats), the Second Engineer in &quot;The Insect Play&quot; by the Čapek brothers, Prince Kamose in another Gray play called &quot;And in the Tomb&quot;, and finally in June 1927, Don Pelegari in Pirandello&#x27;s &quot;Each In His Own Way&quot;. Both Yeats and Shaw attended performances of their own plays.

==Career==
In 1928, he was one of a group of out-of-work actors including Laurence Olivier, chosen to perform in a &quot;tryout&quot; of R. C. Sherriff&#x27;s &quot;Journey&#x27;s End&quot; directed by James Whale at the Apollo Theatre in London, and later in 1929 at the Savoy Theatre which had been leased by the Chicago theatre manager Maurice Browne. It was a huge success, running for two years and making Maurice&#x27;s name. He played the young officer Raleigh. In 1934, he went to the Old Vic Theatre where his interpretation of Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Richard II&quot; was praised and led to an invitation to join Katharine Cornell in the United States. His first appearance on Broadway was opposite Cornell in &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot; in 1936. A later production of &quot;Richard II&quot; was the surprise success of the 1937 theatre season. Evans went on to play &quot;Hamlet&quot; (1938), Falstaff in &quot;Henry IV, Part 1&quot; (1939), &quot;Macbeth&quot; (1941), and Malvolio in &quot;Twelfth Night&quot; (1942) opposite the Viola of Helen Hayes, under the direction of Margaret Webster. He also starred opposite Cornell in the 1935 production of George Bernard Shaw&#x27;s &quot;St. Joan&quot;.

When the U.S. entered the Second World War, he enlisted in the United States Army and he later was in charge of an Army Entertainment Section in the Central Pacific. He arranged for the transfer of Carl Reiner from the Signal Corps to the entertainment unit in Hawaii, where Evans was his commanding officer. The unit produced dozens of shows for the troops in the Pacific. Reiner later hired Evans for the part of Hobart the butler in &quot;The Jerk&quot;, as Evans&#x27;s agent had indicated that the part would enable Evans to maintain his union benefits.

Evans produced his famous &quot;G.I. version&quot; of &quot;Hamlet&quot; that cut the text of the play to make the title character more appealing to the troops, an interpretation so popular that he later took it to Broadway in 1945. Evans rose to the rank of Major by the end of the war. He shifted his attention to the works of Shaw, notably as John Tanner in &quot;Man and Superman&quot; and as King Magnus in &quot;The Apple Cart&quot;. In 1952, he starred as the murderous husband in the original Broadway stage production of &quot;Dial M for Murder&quot;. He also successfully produced Broadway productions in which he did not appear, notably &quot;The Teahouse of the August Moon&quot;.

In 1956, Evans recorded an LP of stories from &quot;Winnie-the-Pooh&quot;. American television audiences of the 1960s will remember Evans as Samantha&#x27;s father, Maurice, on the sitcom &quot;Bewitched&quot;. His real-life insistence that his first name be pronounced &quot;Morris&quot; was ironically at odds with his &quot;Bewitched&quot; character&#x27;s contrasting stance that it be pronounced &quot;Maw-REESE&quot;. Evans also appeared in the fourth season of &quot;Daniel Boone&quot; starring Fess Parker playing a French impresario &quot;Beaumarchais&quot;. He also played The Puzzler on &quot;Batman&quot; in a double episode storyline (which was common for that series) in December 1966. Continuing his American TV appearances, he guest starred in &quot;The Big Valley&quot; from the latter part of the fourth and final season of that western series in April 1969, an episode entitled &quot;Danger Road&quot;.

Evans had great impact on the big screen as well. He played a diabolical villain in &quot;Kind Lady&quot; (1951; co-starring Ethel Barrymore, Keenan Wynn, and Angela Lansbury); Emperor Antoninus in &quot;Androcles and the Lion&quot; (1952); and Sir Arthur Sullivan in &quot;The Story of Gilbert and Sullivan&quot; (1953). Evans appeared memorably in two 1968 films: as the evolved orangutan, Dr. Zaius in &quot;Planet of the Apes&quot; (and the 1970 sequel &quot;Beneath the Planet of the Apes&quot;) and as the doomed &quot;Hutch&quot; in the thriller &quot;Rosemary&#x27;s Baby&quot;, who attempts to warn the title character of the true nature of her Satanic neighbours.

Evans appeared in more American television productions of Shakespeare than any other actor. Beginning in 1953, for the famous television anthology, &quot;Hallmark Hall of Fame&quot;, he starred in the first feature-length (i.e., longer than an hour) dramatisations of the plays to be presented on American television. They were:
* &quot;Hamlet&quot;
* &quot;Macbeth&quot; twice – both times appearing with Dame Judith Anderson who won an Emmy for both of her television performances as Lady Macbeth. Evans won an Emmy Award for the latter, 1960 production. The earlier, a live telecast, was in 1954)
* &quot;Richard II&quot;
* &quot;Twelfth Night&quot; (as Malvolio)
* &quot;The Taming of the Shrew&quot; (as Petruchio, opposite Lilli Palmer as Katherine)
* &quot;The Tempest&quot; (as Prospero)

In bringing so much Shakespeare to American television in such a short span of time (between 1953 and 1960), Evans was a true pioneer. This had never been tried before – at least, not in the U.S. He firmly believed that it was an actor&#x27;s job to &quot;lead public taste, not to play to public taste&quot;.

Evans brought his Shakespeare productions to Broadway many times, playing Hamlet on the Great White Way in four separate productions for a record grand total of 283 performances. He and Dame Judith Anderson starred on Broadway several times in &quot;Macbeth&quot;. Their performances were widely regarded as the definitive portrayals of these characters, although one notable dissenter was Orson Welles, who stated that Evans, as an actor, was &quot;worse than bad – he was poor.&quot;

Evans appeared on Broadway as Hamlet four times, but the productions of the play that he appeared in were consecutive revivals of it – no other actor played Hamlet on Broadway between 1938, when Evans first played him there, and 1946, which marked Evans&#x27;s last Broadway Hamlet.

==Personal life==
Although he had taken U.S. citizenship in 1941, Evans had returned to Britain by the end of the 1960s. Aside from an infrequent trip to the United States and occasional visits to retired actors in financial need (as a representative of the Actors&#x27; Fund, of which he was a longtime trustee), he lived quietly near Brighton. He never married, and was survived by a brother, Hugh, of London.

==Death==

<doc id="780513" wikidata="Q2241512" url="?curid=780513" title="Harringay railway station">
<text>Harringay railway station is in Harringay in the London Borough of Haringey, north London. It is on the Great Northern route that forms part of the East Coast Main Line, down the line from , and is situated between to the south and to the north. It opened on 1 May 1885.

Harringay is managed and served by Great Northern. It is a short distance from Harringay Green Lanes railway station on the London Overground network.

==History==
A formal agreement to build a station at Harringay was made between the British Land Company and the Great Northern Railway in April 1884. The Land Company needed the station to serve housing it was building to the east of the railway line on the site of Harringay House, so it contributed £3,500 to the cost and agreed to bear the working costs of the station for an initial period. Contracts to build the station (including the footbridge) and a road bridge over the Tottenham &amp; Hampstead line went to S.W. Pattinson of Ruskington for £8,000 and £3,999 respectively in August the same year.
The station was constructed with an up platform as an island serving the &quot;up main&quot; and &quot;up slow&quot;, and a single-sided down platform serving the &quot;down slow&quot; only. A was constructed to give access to the station. It stretched from a station approach road off Wightman Road to the west side of the cutting, where Quernmore Road would eventually be built some fifteen years later. A booking office was built on the footbridge above the platforms.

The station opened to passenger traffic on 1 May 1885 with a staff complement of a station master, two assistant clerks, two ticket collectors, and three porters. Although it had been agreed that the station would be named &quot;Harringay Park&quot;, the GNR public timetable from May 1885 shows that station was in fact named &quot;Harringay&quot; from the outset. A goods yard was built to the east of the line, but the exact date it opened for public traffic is not recorded.

In 1900 a second &quot;down slow&quot; passenger line was added and the down platform was made an island and widened along its entire length.

The 1885 booking office building suffered fire damage in the 1960s and had been almost entirely removed by 1969. It was replaced by a small timber shack, which serves as a ticket office until August 2021. Shortly thereafter it was demolished. Tickets sales are now by machine only. 

The station was renamed &quot;Harringay West&quot; on 18 June 1951, but reverted to &quot;Harringay&quot; on 27 May 1971.

In 1975 the platform layout was altered with the west sides of both acting as single sided platforms. A replacement waiting room/canopy block was provided on each.

Since 1976 under British Rail only the central part of the footbridge, and the girders built to carry the old booking office building, remain from the 1885 station structure.

Under plans approved in 1897, the station was to be served by the Great Northern and Strand Railway (GN&amp;SR), a tube railway supported by the GNR which would have run underground beneath the GNR&#x27;s tracks from Alexandra Palace to Finsbury Park and then into central London. The GN&amp;SR stations on each side would have been the same as the main line stations. The GN&amp;SR route and stations north of Finsbury Park were cancelled in 1902 when the GN&amp;SR was taken over by Charles Yerkes&#x27; consortium, which planned to merge it with the Brompton &amp; Piccadilly Circus Railway to form the Great Northern, Piccadilly and Brompton Railway from Finsbury Park to Hammersmith (now part of the London Underground&#x27;s Piccadilly line).

==Services==
All services at Harringay are operated by Great Northern using EMUs.

The typical off-peak service in trains per hour is:
* 4 tph to 
* 2 tph to via 
* 2 tph to 

During the peak hours, the station is served by an additional half-hourly service between Moorgate and Hertford North, and the service between Moorgate and Welwyn Garden City is increased to 4 tph. The station is also served by a small number of peak hour services between Moorgate and .

==Connections==
London Buses route W5 serves the station.

==Infrastructure==

Trains calling at Harringay use the low-speed rail tracks in front of the platforms; there are five more tracks passing through and around the vicinity of the station. Two of these are used for high-speed London North Eastern Railway, Hull Trains, Grand Central and other Great Northern services, and the other three are used for freight services. Occasionally, when these lines are busy, the low-speed tracks are used for the faster services.

A rail link between the East Coast Main Line and the Gospel Oak to Barking line branches off from the former at the southern end of the station.

During the week, trains use dual-voltage Class 717 EMUs following the withdrawal of EMUs.

==In popular culture==

A supersized ticket stub, featuring the words &#x27;Harringay West&#x27; (and Kings Cross), features prominently in the background of a promotional film of The Beatles&#x27; Ticket To Ride, filmed on 23 November 1965 at Twickenham Film Studios.

<text>Spanish is a grammatically inflected language, which means that many words are modified (&quot;marked&quot;) in small ways, usually at the end, according to their changing functions. Verbs are marked for tense, aspect, mood, person, and number (resulting in up to fifty conjugated forms per verb). Nouns follow a two-gender system and are marked for number. Personal pronouns are inflected for person, number, gender (including a residual neuter), and a very reduced case system; the Spanish pronominal system represents a simplification of the ancestral Latin system.
Spanish was the first of the European vernaculars to have a grammar treatise, &quot;&quot;, published in 1492 by the Andalusian philologist Antonio de Nebrija and presented to Queen Isabella of Castile at Salamanca.

The (RAE, Royal Spanish Academy) traditionally dictates the normative rules of the Spanish language, as well as its orthography.

Differences between formal varieties of Peninsular and American Spanish are remarkably few, and someone who has learned the language in one area will generally have no difficulties of communication in the other; however, pronunciation does vary, as well as grammar and vocabulary.

Recently published comprehensive Spanish reference grammars in English include , , and .

== Verbs ==
Every Spanish verb belongs to one of three form classes, characterized by the infinitive ending: &quot;-ar&quot;, &quot;-er&quot;, or &quot;-ir&quot;—sometimes called the first, second, and third conjugations, respectively.

A Spanish verb has nine indicative tenses with more-or-less direct English equivalents: the present tense (&#x27;I walk&#x27;), the preterite (&#x27;I walked&#x27;), the imperfect (&#x27;I was walking&#x27; or &#x27;I used to walk&#x27;), the present perfect (&#x27;I have walked&#x27;), the past perfect —also called the pluperfect— (&#x27;I had walked&#x27;), the future (&#x27;I will walk&#x27;), the future perfect (&#x27;I will have walked&#x27;), the conditional simple (&#x27;I would walk&#x27;) and the conditional perfect (&#x27;I would have walked&#x27;).

In most dialects, each tense has six potential forms, varying for first, second, or third person and for singular or plural number. In the second person, Spanish maintains the so-called &quot;T–V distinction&quot; between familiar and formal modes of address. The formal second-person pronouns (, ) take third-person verb forms.

The second-person familiar plural is expressed in most of Spain with the pronoun and its characteristic verb forms (e.g., &#x27;you eat&#x27;), while in Latin American Spanish it merges with the formal second-person plural (e.g., ). Thus, is used as both the formal and familiar second-person pronoun in Latin America.

In many areas of Latin America (especially Central America and southern South America), the second-person familiar singular pronoun is replaced by , which frequently requires its own characteristic verb forms, especially in the present indicative, where the endings are , , and for , , verbs, respectively. (See &quot;&quot;.)

In the tables of paradigms below, the (optional) subject pronouns appear in parentheses.

=== Present indicative ===
The present indicative is used to express actions or states of being in a present time frame. For example:
* (I am tall). (Subject pronoun not required and not routinely used).
* (She sings in the club).
* (We all live in a yellow submarine).
* ([It] is ten thirty).



=== Past tenses ===
Spanish has a number of verb tenses used to express actions or states of being in a past time frame. The two that are &quot;simple&quot; in form (formed with a single word, rather than being compound verbs) are the preterite and the imperfect.

==== Preterite ====
The preterite is used to express actions or events that took place in the past, and which were instantaneous or are viewed as completed. For example:
* (She died yesterday)
* (Pablo turned the lights off)
* (I ate the rice)
* (You had your hair cut, Lit. &quot;You cut yourself the hair&quot;)



Note that (1) for and verbs (but not ), the first-person plural form is the same as that of the present indicative; and (2) and verbs share the same set of endings.

==== Imperfect or &quot;copretérito&quot; ====
The imperfect expresses actions or states that are viewed as ongoing in the past. For example:
* (I was/used to be funny in the past).
* (You ate a lot – literally, this sentence is saying &quot;You used to eat a lot&quot;, saying that in the past, the person being referred to had a characteristic of &quot;eating a lot&quot;).
* (They were listening to the radio).
All three of the sentences above describe &quot;non-instantaneous&quot; actions that are viewed as continuing in the past. The characteristic in the first sentence and the action in the second were continuous, not instantaneous occurrences. In the third sentence, the speaker focuses on the action in progress, not on its beginning or end.



Note that (1) for all verbs in the imperfect, the first- and third-person singular share the same form; and (2) and verbs share the same set of endings.

==== Using preterite and imperfect together ====
The preterite and the imperfect can be combined in the same sentence to express the occurrence of an event in one clause during an action or state expressed in another clause. For example:
* (They were listening to the radio when they heard a noise outside.)
* (I was in my room when you came in.)
* (It was a very peaceful day when that happened.)
In all three cases, an event or completed action interrupts an ongoing state or action. For example, in the second sentence, the speaker states that he was in his room (expressed through the imperfect to reflect the ongoing or unfinished state of being there) when the other person &quot;interrupted&quot; that state by entering (expressed through the preterite to suggest a completed action).

=== Present progressive and imperfect progressive ===
The present and imperfect progressive both are used to express ongoing, progressive action in the present and past, respectively. For example:
* (I am doing my homework)
* (We are studying)
* (I was listening to the radio)
* (He was cleaning his room)
The present progressive is formed by first conjugating the verb or , depending on context, to agree with the subject, and then attaching a gerund of the verb that follows. The past (imperfect) progressive simply requires the or to be conjugated, depending on context, in imperfect, with respect to the subject.

==== Forming gerunds ====
To form the gerund of an verb, replace the of the infinitive with ;
e.g. , , → , , .
For or verbs, replace the or ending with ;
e.g. , , → , , (note that undergoes the stem vowel change that is typical of verbs).
In verbs (and some -ir verbs, like disminuir) whose stem ends with a vowel, the of the ending is replaced by : e.g. , , → , , .
In verbs whose stem ends with —such as and —the stem vowel is raised to (as is typical of verbs), and this merges with the of the ending; e.g. , → , .

=== Subjunctive ===
The subjunctive of a verb is used to express certain connotations in sentences such as a wish or desire, a demand, an emotion, uncertainty, or doubt.

==== Present subjunctive ====
Normally, a verb would be conjugated in the present indicative to indicate an event in the present frame of time.
* (I am very ambitious)
* (Marta brings the food)
If the sentence expresses a desire, demand, or emotion, or something similar, in the present tense, the subjunctive is used.
* (I want you to be very ambitious—literally, I want &quot;that you be&quot; very ambitious)
* (I am happy that Marta brings the food)
* (It is a shame that you arrive late)

The subjunctive is also used to convey doubt, denial, or uncertainty.
* (I search for a friend who will be likable or I search for a likable friend)
* (There are no authors who write that.)
* (It is possible that she knows a lot.)
* (It does not seem that they have much money.)
In the first two examples, the ideally likable friend has not yet been found and remains an uncertainty, and authors &quot;who write that&quot; are not known to exist. In the third, possibility is not certainty, but rather a conjecture, and the last expresses clear doubt. Thus, subjunctive is used.
Some of the phrases and verbs that require sentences to have subjunctive formation include:
* 
Some phrases that require the indicative instead, because they express certainty, include:

To form the first-person singular subjunctive, first take the present indicative first-person singular () form of a verb. For example, the verbs and (To talk, to eat, to live) → Then, replace the ending with the &quot;opposite ending&quot;. This is done in the following way: if the verb is an or verb such as or replace the ending with an i.e. : If the verb is an verb such as or replace the ending with an : i.e., This forms the first-person conjugation. The other conjugations work similarly, as follows:
* 
* 
* 

Since the forms are derived from , the following would be expected (and used in Central America):
However, the Royal Spanish Academy, following Argentinian usage, recommends using the forms:

==== Imperfect subjunctive ====
Today, the two forms of the imperfect subjunctive – for example, &quot; and &quot;, from &quot;&quot; – are largely interchangeable.* The form derives (as in most Romance languages) from the Latin pluperfect subjunctive, while the form derives from the Latin pluperfect indicative. The use of one or the other is largely a matter of personal taste and dialect. Many only use the forms in speech, but vary between the two in writing. Many may spontaneously use either, or even prefer the rarer forms. The imperfect subjunctive is formed for basically the same reasons as the present subjunctive, but is used for other tenses and time frames.

== Nouns ==

In Spanish, as in other Romance languages, all nouns belong to one of two genders, &quot;masculine&quot; or &quot;feminine&quot;, and many adjectives change their form to agree in gender with the noun they modify. For most nouns that refer to persons, grammatical gender matches biological gender.

== Adjectives ==
Spanish generally uses adjectives in a similar way to English and most other Indo-European languages. However, there are three key differences between English and Spanish adjectives.

* In Spanish, adjectives usually go &quot;after&quot; the noun they modify. The exception is when the writer/speaker is being slightly emphatic, or even poetic, about a particular quality of an object (rather than the mundane use of using the quality to specify which particular object they are referring to).
** could either mean that there are many red houses in the world but I wish to talk about the one that I happen to own, or that I have many houses but am referring to the red one. = My house, which is red.
** means that I am stressing how red my particular house is (probably the only house I have). = My house, which is obviously red. Another way of thinking of it is that this makes the house red at declaration, whereas Spanish typically defines a house and makes it red later.
* In Spanish, adjectives agree with what they refer to in terms of both plurality (singular/plural) and grammatical gender (masculine/feminine). For example, (cup) is feminine, so &quot;the red cup&quot; is , but (glass) is masculine, so &quot;the red glass&quot; is .
* In Spanish, it is perfectly normal to let an adjective stand in for a noun or pronoun—with (where people are involved) no implication of condescension or rudeness. For example, means &quot;the tall ones&quot; or &quot;the tall men&quot;. means &quot;the big one&quot; or &quot;the big man&quot;.
== Determiners ==
Spanish uses determiners in a similar way to English. The main difference is that they inflect for both number (singular/plural) and gender (masculine/feminine). Common determiners include (&quot;the&quot;), (&quot;a&quot;), (&quot;this&quot;), (&quot;much, a lot&quot;), (&quot;some&quot;).

== Pronouns ==

Spanish pronouns fall into the same broad categories as English pronouns do: personal, demonstrative, interrogative, relative, and possessive. The personal pronouns–those that vary in form according to whether they represent the first, second, or third grammatical person–include a variety of second-person forms that differ not only according to number (singular or plural), but also according to formality or the social relation between speakers. Additionally, these second-person forms vary according to geographical region. Because the form of a conjugated verb reflects the person and number of its subject, subject pronouns are usually omitted, except where they are felt to be needed for emphasis or disambiguation.
==Adverbs==
Spanish adverbs work much like their English counterparts, e.g. (&quot;very&quot;), (&quot;a little&quot;), (&quot;far&quot;), (&quot;much, a lot&quot;), (&quot;almost&quot;), etc. To form adverbs from adjectives, the adverbial suffix is added to the feminine singular of the adjective, whether or not it differs from the masculine singular. Thus:

* (&quot;clear&quot;, m. sg.) → (f. sg.) → (&quot;clearly&quot;)
* (&quot;fast, rapid&quot;, m. sg.) → (f. sg.) → (&quot;fast, quickly, rapidly&quot;)
* (&quot;natural&quot;, m. &amp; f. sg.) → (&quot;naturally&quot;)
* (&quot;sad&quot;, m. &amp; f. sg.) → (&quot;sadly&quot;)
* (&quot;bold&quot;, m. &amp; f. sg.) → (&quot;boldly&quot;)

The adjectives (&quot;good&quot;) and (&quot;bad&quot;) have irregular adverbial forms: (&quot;well&quot;) and (&quot;badly&quot;), respectively.

As in English, some adverbs are identical to their adjectival counterparts. Thus words such as (&quot;early&quot;), (&quot;slow&quot;), and (&quot;deep&quot;) can also mean &quot;early&quot; (as in English, as in &quot;He arrived early&quot;) &quot;slowly&quot;, and &quot;deeply&quot;, respectively.

In series of consecutive adverbs that would each end in on their own, the is dropped from all but the final adverb, and the others are left as if they were adjectives in the feminine singular. Thus:

* = &quot;quickly and easily&quot;
* = &quot;slowly, carefully, and skillfully&quot;
* = &quot;partially or completely&quot;

There are also a wide variety of adverbial phrases in Spanish, such as (&quot;often&quot;), (&quot;everywhere&quot;), (&quot;suddenly&quot;), (&quot;finally&quot;), and (&quot;however, nevertheless&quot;).

As with adjectives, the comparative of adverbs is formed by placing (&quot;more&quot;) or (&quot;less&quot;) before the adverb. Thus (&quot;earlier&quot;), (&quot;faster, quicker, more quickly&quot;), (&quot;less interestingly&quot;), etc. The superlative is formed by placing the neuter article before the comparative, although it is generally used with an additional qualifier phrase such as (&quot;that you can&quot;) or (&quot;of all&quot;): (&quot;as quickly as you can&quot;, lit. &quot;the most quickly that you can&quot;), (&quot;most interestingly of all&quot;), (&quot;the least clearly of them&quot;), etc. As with their corresponding adjectival forms, (&quot;well&quot;) and (&quot;badly&quot;) have irregular comparative forms ( (&quot;better&quot;) and (&quot;worse&quot;)), and and are the comparatives of (&quot;much, a lot&quot;) and (&quot;a little&quot;), respectively.

== Prepositions ==
Spanish has a relatively large number of prepositions, and does not use postpositions. The following list is traditionally cited:

Recently, two new prepositions have been added: and , usually placed at the end to preserve the list (which is usually learnt by heart by Spanish students).

This list includes two archaic prepositions ( and ), but leaves out two new Latinisms ( and ) as well as a large number of very important compound prepositions.

Prepositions in Spanish do not change a verb&#x27;s meaning as they do in English. For example, to translate &quot;run out of water&quot;, &quot;run up a bill&quot;, &quot;run down a pedestrian&quot;, and &quot;run in a thief&quot; into Spanish requires completely different verbs, and not simply the use of (&quot;run&quot;) plus the corresponding Spanish preposition. This is more due to the nature of English phrasal verbs rather than an inherent function of Spanish verbs or prepositions.
== Conjunctions ==
The Spanish conjunctions (&#x27;and&#x27;) and (&#x27;or&#x27;) alter their form in both spoken and written language to and respectively when followed by an identical vowel sound. Thus, (&#x27;father and son&#x27;), (&#x27;Ferdinand and Isabella&#x27;), (&#x27;subject or object&#x27;), (&#x27;vertical or horizontal&#x27;).

The change does not take place before the of a diphthong, as in (&#x27;steel and iron&#x27;). Nor does the conjunction change when initial in a question (where it serves to introduce or reintroduce a name as a topic, rather than to link one element with another), as in (&#x27;What about Inés?&#x27;).

When the conjunction appears between numerals, it was usually spelled with an accent mark (), in order to distinguish it from zero (0); thus, (&#x27;2 or 3&#x27;) in contrast to (&#x27;two-hundred three&#x27;). Nowadays only is standard.

== Syntax and syntactic variation ==

=== Order of constituents ===
Spanish unmarked word order for affirmative declarative sentences is subject-verb-object (SVO); however, as in other Romance languages, in practice, word order is more variable, with topicalization and focus being the primary factors in the selection of a particular order. Verb-subject-object (VSO), verb-object-subject (VOS), and object-verb-subject (OVS) are also relatively common, while other orders are very uncommon outside of poetry.

Thus, to simply say, &quot;My friend wrote the book&quot;, one would say (SVO):

Although bare VSO and VOS are somewhat rare in declarative independent clauses, they are quite common in sentences in which something other than the subject or direct object functions as the focus. For example:
* or = &quot;A few years ago, my friend wrote a book&quot;
* or = &quot;Yesterday, my mother saw my friend and asked him about his book&quot;

In many dependent clauses, the verb is placed before the subject (and thus often VSO or VOS) to avoid placing the verb in final position:
* , but rarely = &quot;This is the book that my friend wrote&quot;

A sentence in which the direct object is the topic or &quot;theme&quot; (old information), while the subject is part of the comment, or &quot;rheme&quot; (new information), often assumes OVS order. In this case the direct object noun phrase is supplemented with the appropriate direct object pronoun; for example:

Because subject pronouns are often dropped, one will often see sentences with a verb and direct object but no explicitly stated subject.

In questions, VSO is usual (though not obligatory):
* = &quot;Did my friend write the book?&quot;

Yes/no questions, regardless of constituent order, are generally distinguished from declarative sentences by context and intonation.

=== Cleft sentences ===
A cleft sentence is one formed with the copular verb (generally with a dummy pronoun like &quot;it&quot; as its subject), plus a word that &quot;cleaves&quot; the sentence, plus a subordinate clause. They are often used to put emphasis on a part of the sentence. Here are some examples of English sentences and their cleft versions:
* &quot;I did it.&quot; → &quot;It was I who did it&quot; or more colloquially &quot;It was me that did it.&quot;
* &quot;You will stop smoking through willpower.&quot; → &quot;It is through willpower that you will stop smoking.&quot;

Spanish does not usually employ such a structure in simple sentences. The translations of sentences like these can be readily analyzed as being normal sentences containing relative pronouns. Spanish is capable of expressing such concepts without a special cleft structure thanks to its flexible word order.

For example, if we translate a cleft sentence such as &quot;It was Juan who lost the keys&quot;, we get Whereas the English sentence uses a special structure, the Spanish one does not. The verb has no dummy subject, and the pronoun is not a cleaver but a nominalising relative pronoun meaning &quot;the [male] one that&quot;. Provided we respect the pairings of &quot; and &quot;, we can play with the word order of the Spanish sentence without affecting its structure – although each permutation would, to a native speaker, give a subtly different shading of emphasis.

For example, we can say (&quot;Juan was the one who lost the keys&quot;) or (&quot;The one who lost the keys was Juan&quot;). As can be seen from the translations, if this word order is chosen, English stops using the cleft structure (there is no more dummy &quot;it&quot; and a nominalising relative is used instead of the cleaving word) whilst in Spanish no words have changed.

Here are some examples of such sentences:
* = &quot;It was John who lost the keys&quot;
* = &quot;It is only three days that you have left&quot;
* = &quot;It will be I who tells him&quot;
* = lit. &quot;There are few who come and stay&quot;

Note that it is ungrammatical to try to use just to cleave such sentences as in English, but using in singular or in plural is grammatical.
* * (incorrect)
* (correct)

When prepositions come into play, things become complicated. Structures unambiguously identifiable as cleft sentences are used. The verb introduces the stressed element and then there is a nominaliser. Both of these are preceded by the relevant preposition. For example:
* = &quot;It was me to whom he gave permission&quot;, lit. &quot;It was to me to whom he gave permission&quot;
* = &quot;It is us for whom this was made&quot;, lit. &quot;It is for us for whom this was made&quot;
* = &quot;That is why I did it&quot;, more literally: &quot;It is because of that that I did it&quot;, or completely literally: &quot;It is because of that because of which I did it&quot;
* = &quot;It is this way that it must be done&quot;, lit. &quot;It is this way how it must be done&quot; ( replaces longer expressions such as )

This structure is quite wordy, and is therefore often avoided by not using a cleft sentence at all. Emphasis is conveyed just by word order and stressing with the voice (indicated here within bolding):
* = &quot;He gave permission to me&quot;
* = &quot;This was done for us&quot;
* = &quot;I did it because of that&quot;
* = &quot;It must be done this way&quot;

In casual speech, the complex cleaving pronoun is often reduced to , just as it is reduced to &quot;that&quot; in English.
* 
* (preferred: )
* (preferred: )

In the singular, the subordinate clause can agree either with the relative pronoun or with the subject of the main sentence, though the latter is seldom used. However, in the plural, only agreement with the subject of the main sentence is acceptable. Therefore:
;Singular
* = &quot;I was the one who drank it&quot; (agreement with subject of main sentence)
* (preferred form with same meaning, agreement with )
* = &quot;I am the one who knows&quot; (agreement with subject of main sentence)
* = (preferred form with same meaning, agreement with )

;Plural
* = &quot;We are the only ones who do not have even a cent to bet&quot; (agreement with subject of main sentence) (from dialogue of the Gabriel García Márquez novel )
* = &quot;You girls are the ones who know&quot; (agreement with subject of main sentence)

=== Clitic &quot;se&quot; ===
Clitics are a necessary part of syntactic form and representation in Spanish. Defining a specific syntactic role of a clitic in Spanish is cumbersome, as they are used in a variety of ways. Syntactic approaches to this common element have attempted to find a universal way of handling them. For example, all languages are capable of having subjects, objects, and verbs, so a universal methodology to handling word order, whether SVO, VSO, or OSV, is imperative for a multilingual and universal syntactic representation system to work. As such, there has been great discussion and investigation in the literature for that particular word order element. Clitics, on the other hand, have been given relatively less thought and investigation, particularly an inquiry into an uncomplicated approach in their syntactic distribution. Clitics offer a myriad of functional roles depending upon the language in question, further complicating the situation.

Spanish is a diasporic language which also experiences diachronic variation. While Spanish is said to generally have flexible or &quot;free&quot; word order, others such as Pountain assert that the syntax is heavily influenced by topic and comment identification.

==== Historical approaches ====
The syntactic role of the clitic and its forms in Spanish has undergone much debate within the research with no obvious conclusion. Part of the difficulty stems from the variable role and its other forms play with regard to the contextual grammar. Some syntacticians have aptly termed the clitic as &quot;paradigmatic&quot; in reference to the complexity and variance of features and functions. It is utilized in a variety of Spanish grammar contexts, including the following forms: reflexive pronoun, reciprocal pronoun, replacive pronoun (direct and indirect object), intrinsic pronoun (without the pronoun, the structure is ungrammatical), &quot;derivational&quot; pronoun, and &quot;stylistic&quot; pronoun. Further, is used in addition with certain intransitive verbs, in reflexive-passive constructions, and in impersonal constructions.

As a class, clitics have such a variety of grammatical functions that they are not always pronominal, anaphoric or related to verbal arguments. Syntactically, they are most often found in non-argument benefactive theta-roles, in formation of passive, in formation of middle voice, and with a completive meaning. They can take the form of either phrasal constituents or words with an independent syntactic structure.

Despite being grammatically diverse in Spanish grammatical application, it does certain specific roles. Zagona, author of a comprehensive Spanish syntax textbook, has extensively outlined form and function in depth, stating that:

* [sic] the only true subject clitic in Spanish is &quot;impersonal&quot; &quot;one&quot;.

The impersonal form is clearly defined as it does not double and uses only the third person singular verb form as in the impersonal form example here:

Zagona also notes that, generally, oblique phrases do not allow for a double clitic, yet some verbs of motion are formed with double clitics:

Imperatives in Spanish do not require the use of clitics, but when they are used, a specific word order must be followed. With an affirmative verb, the clitic succeeds the verb. However, in a negative command, word order alters in that the clitic precedes the verb. Another review of sentence positions of in various grammatical constructions offers the following example, demonstrating imperative differences thus:


With continuous verbs, the clitic can precede the auxiliary verb or follow the participle, as in (1a) and (1b):

The clitic cannot follow a past or passive participle, as in (2b):


Specific issues arise in clitic use and syntactic representation in terms of animacy. The Spanish language does not explicitly demonstrate in its grammar whether an object, either direct or indirect, refers to an animate or inanimate object. Therefore, the use of two clitics is common, although not always required. In this way, clitics can be doubled or &quot;redundant&quot; when two instances occur within the same phrase. Double clitics are found in instances of phrases with both direct accusative case objects and indirect dative objects in this way:

Regarding clitic doubling in Spanish, Ordóñez has suggested a &quot;cluster&quot; versus &quot;split&quot; formation, weighing consideration of the double clitic as a single unit (cluster) or a separable unit (split). The syntactic approach maintains a left-dislocation for the clitics while sustaining a separation from the verb. In the cluster model, both clitics are two adjacent constituents whereas the split model, one clitic has been split from the other, appearing higher on the syntactic tree. Both are still under the same c-command of the left branch but are no longer sisters to each other. Ordóñez suggests that when clitics are sisters, they may not even be considered constituents in the syntax. The hypothesis includes a requirement that a non-third person clitic is located higher on a tree than the third person clitic.

In fact, clitic climbing is a common feature in Romance languages with designation of clitics as unbound morphemes where the clitic &quot;climbs&quot; to adjoin the verb in a higher position. This widely discussed theory has involved raising of the clitic as an unaccusative because of the lack of external argument in the grammar structure. The object clitic begins in the subject position of the verb, moving up to attach to the verb via adjunction on the left. Another theory is the &quot;base-generation&quot; which considers clitics to be affixes. However, both approaches fail when there is clitic doubling.

==== Recent approaches ====
As recently as 2021, Cuervo has suggested that, for clitic doubling, the solution is considering the dative clitic to be the head of an Applicative Phrase with care taken in identifying whether the form is proclitic or enclitic. Cuervo addresses the difference by positing the following: if the process is proclitic, there is climbing; if the process is enclitic, there is no climbing. Thus, the determining factor for syntactic presentation is the type of verbal phrase.

Bradley illustrates some inflexible constructions, mainly when two third-person pronouns are within the same sentence and the indirect object must be expressed via :
* already            CL(Nom.)       CL(Acc.)         sent-presperf
* &quot;I have already sent it&quot;

In such cases, one solution is to use the particle followed by an infinitive verb when the clitic precedes an auxiliary verb, as in the example provided below:
* CL(Nom.)       go-1.pres.        to         go to bed
* &quot;We are going to bed&quot;

The clitic is not attached to the infinitive verb; instead, it is in subject position. Grammatically, attachment to the verb occurs with a non-finite or a main conjugated verb. The clitic adjoins the verb and undergoes head movement to check its features.

Additional structures for direct and indirect objects have been suggested. Other views include the use of AgrS and AgrO for Spanish when clitics are involved. Daussá states that can block features as it travels attached to the appropriate verb form from the feature geometry which alters the nodes.

Daussá’s realization of syntactic structure presents a solution for the paradigmatic issue of using AgrO and AgrS. This model includes a Determiner Phrase that is nominative with verbal agreement in both person and number. Romain has also offered a thorough examination of the various theories, concluding that is part of a Determiner Phrase. While there had been some postulation that clitics are heads of their own phrases, there has not been much support given to those claims.

Even more recently, Lewandowski has focused on one function in the use of with reflexive verbs, the completive, wherein with specific verbs the clitic denotes a completion of an action. Lewandowski has proposed an interconnected functionality for the Spanish reflexive pronoun, representing this concept via a cluster map indicating semantic, pragmatic, and grammatical functions. His discussion has centered around the &quot;polyfunctionality&quot; of and how best to syntactically handle this issue, perhaps by not separating the syntax from morphology. Another recent view is that there are two syntactic formations: first, that is a probe for A-movement which results in a paradigmatic and second, that non-paradigmatic is represented by third person singular. This cross-referencing of syntax and morphology overlapping with a communicative stylistic approach has been suggested in the past.

== Dialectal variations ==

=== Forms of address ===
The use of and as a polite form of address is universal. However, there are variations in informal address. replaces in part of Andalusia, the Canary Islands, and Latin America, except in the liturgical or poetic of styles. In some parts of Andalusia, the pronoun is used with the standard endings.

Depending on the region, Latin Americans may also replace the singular with or . The choice of pronoun is a tricky issue and can even vary from village to village. Travellers are often advised to play it safe and call everyone .

A feature of the speech of the Dominican Republic and other areas where syllable-final /s/ is completely silent is that there is no audible difference between the second- and third-person singular form of the verb. This leads to redundant pronoun use, for example, the tagging on of (pronounced ) to the ends of sentences, where other speakers would say .

==== &quot;Voseo&quot; ====

 was used in medieval Castilian as a polite form, like the French and the Italian , and it used the same forms as . This gave three levels of formality:
* (originally )
* (today )

Whereas was lost in standard Spanish, some dialects lost , and began using as the informal pronoun. The exact connotations of this practice, called , depend on the dialect. In certain countries there may be socioeconomic implications. uses the pronoun for but maintains as an object pronoun and and as possessives.

In , verbs corresponding to in the present indicative (roughly equivalent to the English simple present), are formed from the second person plural (the form for ). If the second person plural ends in &#x27; or &#x27;, the form for drops the :
* – 

Similarly the verb (to be) has:

If the second person plural ends in &#x27; (with an accent on the &#x27;), then the form for &quot; is identical:
* – 

In the imperative, the form for is also derived from the second person plural. The latter ends always in &#x27;. So for the form for this &#x27; is removed, and if the verb has more than one syllable, an accent is added to the last vowel:
* – 

The only exception to these rules is in the verb &#x27; (to go), which does not have an imperative form for &#x27; and uses the analogous form of the verb , which has a similar meaning, and is regular:

In the present subjunctive, the same rules as for the present indicative apply, though these forms coexist in Argentina with those for the pronoun :
Or:

Other tenses always have the same form for &#x27; as for &#x27;.

Outside Argentina, other combinations are possible. For instance, people in Maracaibo may use standard endings for (, ).

==== &quot;Vosotros&quot; imperative: &quot;-ar&quot; for &quot;-ad&quot; ====
In Spain, colloquially, the infinitive is used instead of the normative imperative for . This is not accepted in the normative language.
* instead of 
* instead of ( in some dialects)
* or instead of 

==== Non-normative &quot;-s&quot; on &quot;tú&quot; form ====
A form used for centuries but never accepted normatively has an ending in the second person singular of the preterite or simple past. For example, instead of the normative ; for . That is the only instance in which the form does not end in an in the normative language.

Ladino has gone further with .

=== Third-person object pronoun variation ===
The third-person direct-object and indirect-object pronouns exhibit variation from region to region, from one individual to another, and even within the language of single individuals. The prefers an &quot;etymological&quot; usage, one in which the indirect object function is carried by (regardless of gender), and the direct object function is carried by or (according to the gender of the antecedent, and regardless of its animacy).

The Academy also condones the use of as a direct object form for masculine, animate antecedents (i.e. male humans). Deviations from these approved usages are named (for the use of as a direct object), and and (for the use of and as indirect objects). The object pronoun variation is studied in detail by .

Here are some examples for this:

* : (They saw him/her/it). Normative: or depending on the gender of the object.
* : (They told her to shut up). Normative: . The person who is told something is an indirect object in Spanish, and the substituting pronoun is the same for both genders.
* : (They told him to shut up). Normative: . See above.

=== &quot;Queísmo&quot; and &quot;dequeísmo&quot; ===
Noun clauses in Spanish are typically introduced by the complementizer , and such a noun clause may serve as the object of the preposition , resulting in the sequence in the standard language. This sequence, in turn, is often reduced colloquially to just , and this reduction is called .

Some speakers, by way of hypercorrection (i.e. in an apparent effort to avoid the &quot;error&quot; of ), insert before in contexts where it is not prescribed in standard grammar. This insertion of &quot;extraneous&quot; before — called — is generally associated with less-educated speakers.

<text>Dan Edward Garvey (June 19, 1886 – February 5, 1974) was an American businessman, politician and the ninth secretary of state of Arizona from 1942 to 1948 under Sidney Preston Osborn and the eighth governor of Arizona from 1948 to 1951. He was the first of many people to ascend to the office of Governor from the Secretaryship.

==Early career==
Born in Vicksburg, Mississippi, Garvey graduated from St. Aloysius High School and worked for the Illinois Central Railroad. In 1909, he moved to the Arizona Territory to work as a railroad accountant for Randolph Railroad Co., a company later absorbed by the Southern Pacific Railroad. Later, he entered the automobile business, but it failed during the Great Depression.

==Political career==
Garvey was hired by the Pima County treasurer&#x27;s office in 1931. He became Pima County treasurer in 1935 and Tucson city treasurer in 1938. Garvey became known throughout Arizona during the next two decades as a dedicated public servant. He moved to Phoenix in 1940 when he was hired as assistant to Secretary of State Harry M. Moore. Upon Moore&#x27;s death in 1942, Garvey was appointed to succeed him by Governor Sidney P. Osborn, himself the first Secretary of State during most of the 1910s. Garvey was elected to the office twice, in 1944 and 1946.

Garvey assumed the governorship, in accordance with Arizona law, when Osborn died on May 25, 1948. That fall, Garvey won a full term on the Democratic ticket by a fair margin, despite winning only about 28.04% of the vote in a heavily splintered Democratic primary. He presided over one of the largest growth periods in Arizona history between 1948 and 1951.

A large majority of Arizona newcomers were Republicans and Arizona became a bona fide two-party state for the first time. Garvey was defeated in the Democratic primary in 1950 by State Auditor Ana Frohmiller in another cluttered primary: Garvey won only 22.55% of the vote compared to her 29.24%.

At the end of his elected term as governor, Garvey was appointed Arizona administrator for the federal Reconstruction Finance Corporation. In 1955, Governor Ernest W. McFarland appointed him state examiner, a position mandated by the state constitution which was responsible for reviewing and certifying the annual financial reports of the state government&#x27;s agencies and offices. The position was eliminated by a statewide referendum in 1968, and Garvey retired in 1969.

<text>John Howard Pyle (March 25, 1906 – November 29, 1987) was an American broadcaster and politician who served as the ninth governor of the U.S. state of Arizona from 1951 to 1955. An opponent of polygamy, he authorized a raid on a Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints compound. As a member of the Republican Party, Pyle also served as an official in the administration of President Dwight D. Eisenhower.

Pyle graduated from Arizona State University in 1930 and was a member of Lambda Chi Alpha fraternity. He was a program director for a radio station and served as a war correspondent during World War II. He was the first Governor of Arizona who was born in the 20th century.

==Biography==
Born in 1906 in Sheridan, Wyoming, Pyle was the first governor of Arizona to be born in the 20th century and was the Program Director of KFAD (now KTAR) Radio in Phoenix from 1930 to 1951. He also served as a war correspondent during World War II and covered the surrender ceremony of the Japanese. Pyle defeated pioneering female politician Ana Frohmiller in his 1950 campaign for governor. He served as Governor of Arizona from 1951 to 1955.

In 1953, he attempted to break up a polygamous fundamentalist Mormon compound in Colorado City, Arizona, in what became known as the &quot;Short Creek Raid&quot;, which resulted in two dozen men arrested and 236 children placed in foster homes. This move alienated many voters in the state after photographs of tearful children being forcibly removed from their distraught mothers appeared in the newspapers. Later citing the negative reaction by the voters to the Short Creek raid as the cause, Pyle subsequently lost his 1954 re-election bid for a third term to his Democratic opponent, former Senate Majority Leader Ernest McFarland and left office in January 1955.

After his governorship ended, Pyle joined the presidency of Dwight D. Eisenhower, appointed as director of the newly created Office of the Deputy Assistant to the President for Intergovernmental Relations on February 1, 1955. When president Dwight D. Eisenhower created a Joint Federal–State Action Committee on July 20, 1957, to address traffic safety, he appointed Pyle as one of the seven committee members, and Pyle spoke as a representative of the president at regional conferences on highway safety held in 1958. In 1959, he became president of the National Safety Council (NSC). Walter F. Carey, chair of the NSC&#x27;s board of directors, called Pyle an &quot;ideal successor to Ned H. Dearborn&quot;, Pyle&#x27;s predecessor as NSC president.

The University of Redlands, Chapman University, Arizona State University, Lebanon College and Bradley University awarded honorary LL.D degrees to Pyle.

==Later life==
The NSC elected Vincent L. Tofany as its new president on October 29, 1973, ending Pyle&#x27;s tenure. Pyle retired and moved to Tempe, where he wrote columns for the &quot;Tempe Daily News-Tribune&quot;. After having a stroke, he was hospitalized on October 23, 1987. Pyle died on November 29, 1987, in Tempe, Arizona, survived by his wife, Lucile Hanna Pyle, and two daughters. Pyle&#x27;s home, abandoned after his death, was later refurbished and preserved as a historic property called the Pyle House.

<doc id="780532" wikidata="Q2309746" url="?curid=780532" title="Spider crater">
<text>Spider is an impact structure, the deeply eroded remnant of a former impact crater, situated in the Kimberley region of northern Western Australia, 18 km east of the Mount Barnett Roadhouse on the Gibb River Road. Due to very rugged terrain the site is effectively inaccessible. The name is derived from the visually striking spider-like radiating ridges of quartzite prominently visible from the air or on satellite images.

== Description ==
The unusual geological structure has been a puzzle since the 1950s, but it was not until shatter cones were discovered it the centre in the late 1970s that it was realized that it was an eroded impact structure. The central area bearing shatter cones is interpreted as the relic of a central uplift with the outer limits of disturbance confined to a subcircular area about 11 x 13 km in diameter; the original crater may have been slightly greater than this due to the depth of erosion. The asymmetry of the structure lead some geologists to conclude that the projectile had a very low angle trajectory from the north or northwest, while others suggest that the asymmetry may be at least partly due to the effect of pre-existing topography.

The age of the Spider impact event is not accurately constrained, but it has been argued it occurred after gentle folding of the Palaeoproterozoic quartzite, but before a regional episode of glacial erosion; if correct it occurred between 900 and 600 Ma i.e. during the Neoproterozoic.

<text>The Steinheim crater is a meteorite crater in Steinheim am Albuch, Heidenheim County, Baden-Württemberg, Germany. The crater is located at the north-eastern end of the Swabian Alb, 40km west of the much larger (24-km-diameter) Nördlinger Ries crater.

It is 3.8 km in diameter and the age is estimated to be about 14.3 million years (Miocene). The crater is exposed at the surface. It had previously been thought that the two craters formed simultaneously by the impact of a double asteroid 14.8 million years ago, but a study published in 2020 suggests that Steinheim could actually be about 500,000 years younger than Nördlinger Ries.

<text>Strangways is a large impact structure, the eroded remnant of a former impact crater, located in the Northern Territory of Australia about east-south-east of the town of Mataranka. It was named after the nearby Strangways River. The location is remote and difficult to access. Its age has been determined as approximately 646 Ma.

== Description ==
The circular topographic feature that marks the site was originally thought to be volcanic, with an impact origin first proposed in 1971 after the discovery of evidence diagnostic of impact including shatter cones and shocked quartz. The circular topographic feature is about in diameter and lies within Mesoproterozoic sedimentary rocks of the McArthur Basin. However, this is only a relic of the original crater after considerable erosion. Estimates of the original rim diameter vary between different researchers in the range ; the Earth Impact Database prefers a diameter of . The age of the impact event has been determined at 646 ± 42 Ma (Neoproterozoic) based on radiometric dating of impact melt rocks.

In 1996, the crater&#x27;s site was listed on the now-defunct Register of the National Estate.

<text>Suavjärvi (in Karelian, Russian: ) is a lake in the Republic of Karelia, Russia about 50 km north of the town of Medvezhyegorsk. The lake is approximately wide.

Mashchak and Naumov argue that Suavjärvi lies at the center of a deeply eroded and highly metamorphosed impact structure, the Suavjärvi structure, which has a diameter of . According to Mashchak and Naumov, this impact structure is characterized by gravity and magnetic lows and in its northeastern and southwestern parts, impact-generated polymict megabreccias. The megabreccias are composed of blocks of both basement granitoids and supracrustal greenstone. Shock metamorphic features in are reported to be rare and to consist of planar features, deformation bands, and mosaic structure in quartz and deformation feature in feldspars and biotite. Younger regional metamorphism has significantly altered the rocks composing the structure and may have either obliterated or altered any shock metamorphic effects.

The inferred age of the Suavjarvi structure lies within an age interval between 2.7 and 2.2 billion years. Its older age limit of 2.7 billion years is set by the regional age of Late Lopian granitoids that occur as fragments within the megabreccias. The overlap of impact polymictic breccias by basal conglomerates of the Jatulian Group and presence of weathered breccia within its conglomerates indicates that the Suavjarvi structure predates it. The lower age limit of the Jatulian Group
is tentatively regarded to be between 2.3 and 2.2 billion years.

However, Huber and others conducted field and laboratory investigations of the Suavjärvi structure. They found that the bedrock outcrops inside the structure, mapped as &quot;polymict impact breccia&quot; and classified as &quot;megabreccia&quot;, consists of massive granite and schist that are indistinguishable in the field from Archean outcrops outside the structure. They also found an absence of evidence of shock metamorphism in samples from within the hypothesized impact structure and that the rocks associated with it do not substantially differ from the normal regional geology. This lake is more likely a glacial lake. The Suavjärvi structure&#x27;s classification as an impact structure remains controversial and unsettled.

<text>Suvasvesi is a lake in Eastern Finland near the city of Kuopio. Suvasvesi consists of two circular open lakes, Kuukkarinselkä in north and Haapaselkä in south. The lakes are separated by a group of islands. The lake has 688 islands in total. The area of the lake is making it the 18th largest lake in Finland. Kuukkarinselkä is the third deepest lake in Finland measuring in the deepest point.

In 2001, shatter cones were found in Kuukkarinselkä making it the 6th known impact crater in Finland. The crater, usually referred as Suvasvesi North crater, is located in the center of Kuukkarinselkä and measures about in diameter. Its age is estimated to be about 85 Ma but the Earth Impact Database (EID) gives a broader span of less than 1000 Ma.

Haapaselkä resembles the northern counterpart and it was also suspected to be an impact crater. It has recently been confirmed and is usually referred as Suvasvesi South crater. It is similar in size, and the age of the crater is estimated to be older than 700 Ma (probably about 710–720 Ma) based on argon-argon dating of impact melt rocks found near the southeastern shore of Lake Haapaselkä but EID gives it as around 250 Ma.

<text>Tabun-Khara-Obo is an impact crater in the Dornogovi Aimag (province) the south-east of Mongolia.
The crater, which is exposed at the surface, is in diameter. The crater&#x27;s rim rises some above the crater bottom, but the bottom of crater is covered with up to thick layer of lake deposits - a testimony that this crater in earlier times was filled with a lake.

It has an estimated age of 150 ± 20 million years (Middle Jurassic to Early Cretaceous). The site was first identified as a probable impact crater in the 1960s, although confirmation of the hypothesis only occurred decades later.
Drilling at the site in 2008 revealed rock features consistent with high-speed impacts such as those caused by meteorites.

<text>Tenoumer is considered to be an impact crater in Mauritania.

==Details==
The crater is located in the western Sahara Desert. It is in diameter and its age was estimated to be 21,400 ± 9,700 years old but as of 2016, is thought to be ~1.57 Ma. 

The crater is exposed at the surface and is nearly circular. Edges of the crater rise up to high above the base of the crater, but the bottom of the crater is covered with an approximately thick layer of sediments.

Tenoumer crater has formed in gneiss and granite of Precambrian peneplain with a thin layer of Pliocene sediments (no older). The crater is believed to be caused by an impact event due to basement rocks found outside the crater. A volcanic origin was once theorized because of the discovery of basalt and rhyodacite outside of the crater basin, but current evidence clearly indicates an impact origin.

<text>Tin Bider () is an impact crater that sits in dry, rugged terrain in Algeria. The crater was formed in the last 70 million years, perhaps in the late Cretaceous or early Tertiary Period. Spanning 6 kilometres, the crater sits at the southern end of a range of hills. The elevated position and concentric rings of Tin Bider suggest that its structure is complex.

Massive sandstones attributable to the Lower Cretaceous, known throughout the Sahara, are only exposed in the craters centre, about 500 meters above its usual stratigraphic position. 

Because of the large prominence of ductile deformation, Tin Bider significantly differs from other craters. While there is yet no conclusive explanation for this unique condition, Tin Bider could provide important information toward a better understanding of large-scale impact cratering.

<text>Tookoonooka is a large meteorite impact structure (astrobleme) situated in South West Queensland, Australia. It lies deeply buried within Mesozoic sedimentary rocks of the Eromanga Basin and is not visible at the surface.

== Description ==
Tookoonooka was discovered using seismic data collected during routine petroleum exploration and first reported in a publication in 1989, with proof of the impact theory coming from the discovery of shocked quartz in drill core. Estimates of the crater diameter range from to . The impact occurred during deposition of the Cretaceous Cadna-owie Formation, the age of which is variously estimated at being between 123 and 133 Ma, or 115–112 Ma. Tookoonooka is associated with several small oil fields.

== Talundilly impact structure ==
The seismic data reveal a similar nearby structure of the same age referred to as Talundilly. Although it seems likely that Tookoonooka and Talundilly are paired impact structures, proof that the latter is of impact origin is not possible without drilling. Another proposed paired impact structures are the larger West and East Warburton Basin structures in the nearby state of South Australia.

<text>A possible world is a complete and consistent way the world is or could have been. Possible worlds are widely used as a formal device in logic, philosophy, and linguistics in order to provide a semantics for intensional and modal logic. Their metaphysical status has been a subject of controversy in philosophy, with modal realists such as David Lewis arguing that they are literally existing alternate realities, and others such as Robert Stalnaker arguing that they are not.

== Logic ==
Possible worlds are one of the foundational concepts in modal and intensional logics. Formulas in these logics are used to represent statements about what &quot;might&quot; be true, what &quot;should&quot; be true, what one &quot;believes&quot; to be true and so forth. To give these statements a formal interpretation, logicians use structures containing possible worlds. For instance, in the relational semantics for classical propositional modal logic, the formula formula_1 (read as &quot;possibly P&quot;) is actually true if and only if formula_2 is true in some world which is &quot;accessible&quot; from the actual world.

Possible worlds play a central role in the work of both linguists and/or philosophers working in formal semantics. Contemporary formal semantics is couched in formal systems rooted in Montague grammar, which is itself built on Richard Montague&#x27;s intensional logic. Contemporary research in semantics typically uses possible worlds as formal tools without committing to a particular theory of their metaphysical status. The term &quot;possible world&quot; is retained even by those who attach no metaphysical significance to them.

In the field of database theory, possible worlds are also a notion used in the setting of uncertain databases and probabilistic databases, which serve as a succinct representation of a large number of possible worlds.

==Argument from ways==
Possible worlds are often regarded with suspicion, which is why their proponents have struggled to find arguments in their favor. An often-cited argument is called the &quot;argument from ways&quot;. It defines possible worlds as &quot;ways things could have been&quot; and relies for its premises and inferences on assumptions from natural language, for example:

# The Black Death could have killed 99% of the European population, rather than the estimated 25 to 60%.
# So there are other ways things could have been.
# Possible worlds are ways things could have been.
# So there are other possible worlds.

The central step of this argument happens at &quot;(2)&quot; where the plausible &quot;(1)&quot; is interpreted in a way that involves quantification over &quot;ways&quot;. Many philosophers, following Willard Van Orman Quine, hold that quantification entails ontological commitments, in this case, a commitment to the existence of possible worlds. Quine himself restricted his method to scientific theories, but others have applied it also to natural language, for example, Amie L. Thomasson in her paper entitled &quot;Ontology Made Easy&quot;. The strength of the &quot;argument from ways&quot; depends on these assumptions and may be challenged by casting doubt on the quantifier-method of ontology or on the reliability of natural language as a guide to ontology.

== Philosophical issues and applications ==

=== Metaphysics ===

The ontological status of possible worlds has provoked intense debate. David Lewis famously advocated for a position known as modal realism, which holds that possible worlds are real, concrete places which exist in the exact same sense that the actual world exists. On Lewis&#x27;s account, the actual world is special only in that we live there. This doctrine is called &quot;the indexicality of actuality&quot; since it can be understood as claiming that the term &quot;actual&quot; is an indexical, like &quot;now&quot; and &quot;here&quot;. Lewis gave a variety of arguments for this position. He argued that just as the reality of atoms is demonstrated by their explanatory power in physics, so too are possible worlds justified by their explanatory power in philosophy. He also argued that possible worlds must be real because they are simply &quot;ways things could have been&quot; and nobody doubts that such things exist. Finally, he argued that they could not be reduced to more &quot;ontologically respectable&quot; entities such as maximally consistent sets of propositions without rendering theories of modality circular. (He referred to these theories as &quot;ersatz modal realism&quot; which try to get the benefits of possible worlds semantics &quot;on the cheap&quot;.)

Modal realism is controversial. W.V. Quine rejected it as &quot;metaphysically extravagant&quot;. Stalnaker responded to Lewis&#x27;s arguments by pointing out that a way things could have been is not itself a world, but rather a property that such a world can have. Since properties can exist without them applying to any existing objects, there&#x27;s no reason to conclude that other worlds like ours exist. Another of Stalnaker&#x27;s arguments attacks Lewis&#x27;s &quot;indexicality theory of actuality&quot;. Stalnaker argues that even if the English word &quot;actual&quot; is an indexical, that doesn&#x27;t mean that other worlds exist. For comparison, one can use the indexical &quot;I&quot; without believing that other people actually exist. Some philosophers instead endorse the view of possible worlds as maximally consistent sets of propositions or descriptions, while others such as Saul Kripke treat them as purely &quot;formal&quot; (i.e. mathematical) devices.

=== Explicating necessity and possibility ===

At least since Aristotle, philosophers have been greatly concerned with the logical statuses of propositions, e.g. necessity, contingency, and impossibility. In the twentieth century, possible worlds have been used to explicate these notions. In modal logic, a proposition is understood in terms of the &quot;worlds in which it is true&quot; and &quot;worlds in which it is false&quot;. Thus, equivalences like the following have been proposed:

* &quot;True propositions&quot; are those that are &quot;true in the actual world&quot; (for example: &quot;Archduke Franz Ferdinand was assassinated in 1914&quot;).
* &quot;False propositions&quot; are those that are &quot;false in the actual world&quot; (for example: &quot;Archduke Franz Ferdinand was assassinated in 2014&quot;).
* &quot;Possible propositions&quot; are those that are &quot;true in at least one possible world&quot; (for example: &quot;Archduke Franz Ferdinand survived the assassination attempt against him in 1914&quot;). This includes propositions which are necessarily true, in the sense below.
* &quot;Impossible propositions&quot; (or &quot;necessarily false propositions&quot;) are those that are &quot;true in no possible world&quot; (for example: &quot;Melissa and Toby are taller than each other at the same time&quot;).
* &quot;Necessarily true propositions&quot; (often simply called &quot;necessary propositions&quot;) are those that are &quot;true in all possible worlds&quot; (for example: &quot;2 + 2 = 4&quot;; &quot;all bachelors are unmarried&quot;).
* &quot;Contingent propositions&quot; are those that are &quot;true in some possible worlds and false in others&quot; (for example: &quot;Archduke Franz Ferdinand was assassinated in 1914&quot; is &quot;contingently true&quot; and &quot;Archduke Franz Ferdinand survived the assassination attempt against him in 1914&quot; is &quot;contingently false&quot;).

=== Other uses ===

Possible worlds play a central role in many other debates in philosophy. These include debates about the Zombie Argument, and physicalism and supervenience in the philosophy of mind. Many debates in the philosophy of religion have been reawakened by the use of possible worlds.

==History of the concept==

The idea of possible worlds is most commonly attributed to Gottfried Leibniz, who spoke of possible worlds as ideas in the mind of God and used the notion to argue that our actually created world must be &quot;the best of all possible worlds&quot;. Arthur Schopenhauer argued that on the contrary our world must be the worst of all possible worlds, because if it were only a little worse it could not continue to exist. Scholars have found implicit earlier traces of the idea of possible worlds in the works of René Descartes, a major influence on Leibniz, Al-Ghazali (&quot;The Incoherence of the Philosophers&quot;), Averroes (&quot;The Incoherence of the Incoherence&quot;), Fakhr al-Din al-Razi (&quot;Matalib al-&#x27;Aliya&quot;), John Duns Scotus and Antonio Rubio (&quot;Commentarii in libros Aristotelis Stagiritae de Coelo&quot;).

The modern philosophical use of the notion was pioneered by David Lewis and Saul Kripke.

<text>Tswaing (Tswana for &quot;place of salt&quot;) is an impact crater enclosed by a 1,946 ha nature reserve, situated in northern Gauteng province, South Africa. The crater and reserve are situated on a base of ancient granite of the Bushveld Igneous Complex, some 40 km to the north-northwest of Pretoria (just north of Soshanguve). This astrobleme is 1.13 km in diameter and 100 m deep and its age is estimated to be 220,000 ± 52,000 years (Pleistocene). The impactor is believed to have been a chondrite or stony meteorite some 30 to 50 m in diameter that was vaporised during the impact event. Morokweng impact structure, another South African crater of chondrite origin, lies north-west of Vryburg. Since 1996 it falls under the auspices of Ditsong Museums of South Africa.

==Etymology==
The name &quot;Tswaing&quot; means &quot;place of salt&quot; in Tswana and the crater was also formerly known in English as the &quot;Pretoria Saltpan crater&quot; and in Afrikaans as &quot;Soutpankrater&quot;, due to the highly saline lake on the crater floor. 

==Palaeoclimatology==
Lipid biomarkers and carbon and hydrogen isotopic ratios from the lake indicate the existence of regional humid climatic periods between 84,000 and 80,000 years BP and between 50,000 and 39,000 BP. In contrast, intervals of high aridity occurred around 76,000 BP, from 73,000 to 69,000 BP, from 55,000 to 51,000 BP, and from 31,400 to 12,600 BP. Since 84,000 BP, the vegetation of the region around the lake has been dominated by savanna-type plants.

==History==
Stone tools from the Middle Stone Age show that the crater was regularly visited by people from as far back as 100,000 years ago in order to hunt and collect salt. Water in the crater comes from surface springs, ground water and rain water and is rich in dissolved carbonates and sodium chlorides. Tswana and Sotho people harvested the salt by filtering and decoction between 1200 and 1800. Between 1912 and 1956 brine was pumped from the floor of the crater by the company &quot;SA Alkali Ltd.&quot; in order to extract soda and salt.

A scientific dispute was ongoing regarding the origin of the crater between supporters of volcanic origin (Wagner, 1922) and those who believed it is an impact crater (Rohleder, 1933) until 1990, when examination of the core from a borehole proved that it is an impact crater.

== Museum ==
The impact crater is accompanied by the Ditsong Tswaing Crater Museum.

== Status of protection ==
Tswaing is currently on the &quot;tentative list&quot; for consideration as a World Heritage Site.

<doc id="780568" wikidata="Q7722472" url="?curid=780568" title="Children's Hour with Armstrong and Miller">
<text>Children&#x27;s Hour with Armstrong and Miller is a British four-part comedy programme broadcast on BBC Radio 4 between 2 December 1998 and 30 December 1998. It stars Alexander Armstrong and Ben Miller as media journalists. Armstrong is almost unrecognisable as the adenoidal Martin Bain-Jones with Miller playing Craig (often misnamed Crag) Children in a spoof music/children&#x27;s/cultural review programme. No episode was broadcast on 23 December 1998 due to extended news coverage.

Each episode would see them attempting to get a scoop on the opposition by visiting various events such as music festivals and media parties; although most of the time they ended up making fools of themselves – on one occasion attempting to interview a non-existent band called &quot;Atering-Catering-Cat&quot;.

Their nemesis – Andy Thomas – &quot;with his frightful show on Radio 1&quot;, is a constant throughout the four programmes, and would always upstage them and do his best to interfere with their plans, such as by stealing their passes for the Leeds music festival. Another constant is Peter Davies (aged 47), an obsessed fan who always manages to cross their paths.

The series bears repeated listening, with many subtle lines, but at times can be a little confusing as it goes backwards and forwards in time, segued by records that they play on their show. There are also many instances of innuendo, typically when the records end. One typical line from Bain-Jones is &quot;... and I said no it won&#x27;t, as it&#x27;s water-based...&quot;, before realising they are on air again.

<text>Roberto Farinacci (; 16 October 1892 – 28 April 1945) was a leading Italian fascist politician and important member of the National Fascist Party before and during World War II, as well as one of its ardent antisemitic proponents. English historian Christopher Hibbert describes him as &quot;slavishly pro-German&quot;.

== Early life ==
Born in Isernia, Molise, Farinacci was raised in poverty and dropped out of school at a young age, moving to Cremona and beginning working on a railroad there in 1909. Farinacci described himself as Catholic. Around this time period, he became an irredentist socialist and a major advocate of Italy&#x27;s participation in the war when World War I began. After the war, Farinacci was an ardent supporter of Benito Mussolini and his fascist movement. He subsequently established himself as the &quot;Ras&quot; (local leader, a title borrowed from the Ethiopian aristocracy) of the Fascists in Cremona, publishing the newspaper &quot;Cremona Nuova&quot; (later on &quot;Il Regime Fascista&quot;) and organizing Blackshirts combat squads in 1919. The Cremona squads were amongst the most brutal in Italy and Farinacci effectively used them to terrorize the population into submission to Fascist rule. In 1922, Farinacci appointed himself mayor of Cremona.

== Prominence ==
Quickly rising as one of the most powerful members of the National Fascist Party, gathering around him a large number of supporters, Farinacci came to represent the most radical syndicalist faction of the party, one that thought Mussolini to be a too liberal leader (likewise, Mussolini believed Farinacci was too violent and irresponsible). Among Fascists, Farinacci was known to be particularly anti-clerical, xenophobic and antisemitic. Nevertheless, Farinacci&#x27;s career continued to rise and played a considerable role in establishing Fascist dominance over Italy during and after the 1922 March on Rome.

In 1925, Farinacci became the second most powerful man in the country when Mussolini appointed him secretary of the party. He was used by Mussolini to centralize the party and then to purge it of thousands of its radical members. Then, Farinacci was removed. He disappeared from the limelight, practicing law for much of the late 1920s and early 1930s. In a 1929 &quot;Time&quot; article, Farinacci was nicknamed the &quot;castor oil man&quot; of Fascism, based on his forcing of opponents of Fascism to swallow castor oil which he called the &quot;golden nectar of nausea&quot;. The effects of swallowing castor oil would cause the victims to suffer severe diarrhea followed by dehydration. The &quot;Time&quot; article also claims that as secretary of the party he allowed the murderers of Italian Socialist Party deputy Giacomo Matteotti to be let free in 1926.

In 1935, Farinacci fought in the Second Italo-Abyssinian War as a member of the &quot;Voluntary Militia for National Security&quot; (MVSN), the new official name of the Blackshirts, eventually attaining the rank of lieutenant general. He lost his right hand fishing with a hand grenade near Dessie, an incident for which Ettore Muti ironically nicknamed him &quot;&quot;Martin pescatore&quot; (kingfisher). In the same year, Farinacci joined the Grand Council of Fascism and returned to national prominence. In 1937, Farinacci participated in the Spanish Civil War and in 1938 became a governmental minister and enforced the antisemitic racial segregation measures declared by Mussolini.

== In World War II ==

When World War II began, Farinacci sided with Nazi Germany. He frequently communicated with the Nazis and became one of Mussolini&#x27;s advisors on Italy&#x27;s dealings with Germany. For his part, Farinacci urged Mussolini to enter Italy into the war as a member of the Axis. In 1941, Farinacci became Inspector of the Militia in Italian-occupied Albania.

In July 1943, Farinacci took part in the Grand Council of Fascism meeting which led to Mussolini&#x27;s downfall. While the majority of the council voted to force Mussolini out of the government, Farinacci did not side against him. After Mussolini&#x27;s arrest, Farinacci fled to Germany in order to escape arrest.

The Nazi hierarchy considered putting Farinacci in charge of a German-backed Italian government in Northern Italy (the Italian Social Republic), but he was passed over in favor of Mussolini when the latter was rescued by Otto Skorzeny in September through the raid known as Unternehmen Eiche. Afterwards, Farinacci went back to Cremona without taking active part in political life. However, he did continue to write politically oriented articles. He also funded the journal &quot;Crociata Italica&quot;, the main organ of a small group of clerical fascist priests led by Don Tullio Calcagno. 

 In the morning of 26 April 1945, in the closing days of World War II, Farinacci fled Cremona and headed towards Valtellina, along with a small group of Fascist diehards. Near Bergamo he parted from the main column and headed towards Vimercate along with marquise Maria Carolina Vidoni Soranzo, secretary of the female Fasces, whose sister owned a villa there. On 27 April their car ran into a partisan patrol near Brivio and refused to stop, resulting in a shootout in which the driver was killed and Marquise Vidoni Soranzo was mortally wounded. The uninjured Farinacci was captured along with twelve suitcases, filled with money and jewels; he was brought to the town hall of Vimercate and tried by a partisan court. He demanded to be brought to Cremona, claiming that &quot;there they will tell you that I did good and that I must be released&quot;&quot;, and contesting all accusations against him; there was some indecision about the sentence, as the representatives of the Christian Democracy and of the Italian Liberal Party wanted to hand him over to the Allies, whereas those of the Italian Communist Party and of the Italian Socialist Party wanted to execute him. In the end he was sentenced to death and executed by firing squad in the main square of Vimercate on 28 April 1945. The partisans wanted to shoot him in the back, but at last second he turned and was thus shot in the chest, reportedly shouting &quot;Long live Italy&quot;.

In the Florestano Vancini&#x27;s film &quot;The Assassination of Matteotti&quot; (1973), Farinacci is played by Max Dorian. Together with Giovanni Preziosi, Farinacci was one of the most prominent Fascist voices of racial antisemitism during the Mussolini regime.

<text>Joe Bowen (born April 5, 1951) is a Canadian sportscaster. He is known as &quot;The Voice of the Toronto Maple Leafs&quot;, having broadcast over 3,000 Leaf games. Bowen also does the radio play-by-play on Sportsnet 590 The Fan or TSN Radio 1050 with Jim Ralph.

==Early life==
Bowen was born on April 5, 1951, and raised in Sudbury, Ontario, Canada. While attending Sudbury High School, he was part of the Copper Cliff Redmen Northern Ontario championship hockey club in 1967. Following his school, he enrolled at the University of Windsor for a degree in communications arts. He chose the institution as it allowed him to complete a degree and still get into broadcasting. During his time at Windsor, Bowen covered university sports on the campus radio station CJAM-FM. Bowen is of Irish descent through his paternal grandfather who emigrated from County Cork.

==Career==
After graduating from the University of Windsor, Bowen returned to Sudbury where he started his career in radio, covering the Ontario Hockey League&#x27;s (OHL) Sudbury Wolves. In addition to broadcasting the games, Bowen also held the position of Sports Director at station CKSO, anchoring various sportscasts throughout the day. He spent five years with the Wolves before moving to Halifax in 1979 to announce Nova Scotia Voyageurs games and serve as the sports director for two Halifax radio stations. While in Halifax, Bowen received an offer from Len Bramson to try out for the play-by-play announcer position for Toronto Maple Leafs of the National Hockey League. Following the try-out, Bowen replaced Ron Hewat to become the fifth play-by-play radio broadcaster in the history of Toronto Maple Leafs. Bowen made his debut as the Leafs&#x27; play-by-play announcer on October 6, 1982, at the Chicago Stadium. He joined CJCL, the Telemedia flagship station, in 1983 and took over as morning sports anchor and radio voice of the Leafs. 

Bowen remained a mainstay in the Leafs&#x27; broadcasting booth throughout the 1990s, despite rumours circulating in 1995 that he would be replaced. In 1995, the Telemedia Sports Network lost out in the bidding war for the rights to air the Leafs on the radio to Q107. The new radio station wanted a full-time announcer for its 82 regular-season games and playoffs instead of allowing Bowen to work both radio and TV. He eventually chose to join Q107 instead of Telemedia Sports Network. As the radio station did not allow him to also feature on television, Bowen&#x27;s former TV partner Gord Stellick was partnered with Mark Hebscher. In 1997, Bowen replaced Jiggs McDonald on 35 mid-week TV broadcasts on Global and ONtv while still maintaining his responsibilities with Q107. In March 2000, Bowen was presented with a gold seat salvaged from the Leafs&#x27; former home, Maple Leaf Gardens, in recognition of his longtime support for the Leafs.

He also called several seasons for the NLL&#x27;s Toronto Rock, beginning in their inaugural season in Toronto in 1999, after one season in Hamilton as the Ontario Raiders. This included the 1999-2002 NLL championship games. Bowen stopped calling Rock games after the 2007 season. 

Until 2014, Bowen called Leafs games on television when the games were televised regionally outside of CBC and TSN as radio games were called by Dennis Beyak. After Rogers secured national rights to the NHL, he permanently moved to radio as the televised duties were taken over by play-by-play commentators from TSN4 or Sportsnet Ontario. March 7, 2017, Bowen called his 3,000th game as Voice of the Leafs, a 3-2 home victory over the Detroit Red Wings.

==Catchphrase==

Bowen&#x27;s catchphrase is &quot;Holy Mackinaw!&quot; (also the catch phrase from the CFL&#x27;s Hamilton Tiger Cats), typically used when an amazing goal is scored or a big save is made. It has been suggested that the phrase originated from a California spirit yell, but Bowen claims he got the phrase from his dad who said &quot;Holy Mackinaw&quot; instead of swearing.

==Outside of radio==
Bowen appeared in a TV commercial for Harvey&#x27;s promoting the &quot;bigger&quot; Angus Burger, using his famous aforementioned catchphrase (and has voiced over many Harvey&#x27;s commercials recently). He was the radio announcer in the 1986 film &quot;Youngblood.&quot;

In June 2018, the Hockey Hall of Fame announced that Bowen was named as the 2018 winner of the Foster Hewitt Memorial Award, honouring outstanding contributions by a hockey broadcaster.

Upheaval Dome is approximately in diameter and the crater is known to be less than 170 million years old (Jurassic or younger, but how much younger is not established.) The crater is clearly visible on the surface as light and dark brown concentric rings.

Stratigraphically, the oldest formation exposed in the center of the dome is the Permian Organ Rock Shale. This is overlain by the Permian White Rim Sandstone. Both are sometimes considered part of the Cutler Formation. Overlying these are the Triassic Moenkopi Formation (which is bounded top and bottom by unconformities), the Chinle Formation, the cliff-forming Wingate Sandstone, the Kayenta Formation, and the crossbedded Triassic-Jurassic Navajo Sandstone.

Structurally, the dome is anomalous. Most of the rock strata of Canyonlands National Park are flat-lying or gently dipping with the exception of a series of linear salt walls and associated synclines. Upheaval Dome is a circular, dome-shaped structure. Some strata near the center are nearly vertical in orientation. Dips of 70 degrees have been measured in the Kayenta Formation on the U-shaped plateau surrounding the center of the structure. A syncline surrounds the center, where the axis forms a complete circle approximately two miles across. The syncline is primarily visible in the Navajo Sandstone. Another anticline has been mapped to the north of this ring syncline, which is also concentric with it.

There were two well-known theories as to the origin of the upheaval. One theory was the upheaval is a salt dome, an anticlinal structure which occurs when a salt diapir is pushed up by the weight of overlying rocks.

The currently-accepted theory is an interpretation of the dome as an eroded impact crater, like the much younger Meteor Crater near Winslow, Arizona. In the 1990s, a team of geologists and seismologists from NASA and the University of Nevada at Reno performed a detailed study that included seismic refraction and rock mapping. The results of this study support the meteorite theory. In 2008, it was announced that shocked quartz was discovered in addition to the numerous impact-related features described by Kriens et al. in 1998.

<text>Vargeão Dome is a meteorite crater in Santa Catarina State, Brazil, straddling the municipalities of Vargeão, Faxinal dos Guedes, and Passos Maia.

The crater is an almost perfectly circular depression with steep walls, in diameter and up to deep, relative to its rim. It is of Early Cretaceous age, or about 123 ± 2 Ma.

The meteorite impacted on the basaltic rocks of the Serra Geral Formation (Jurassic/Cretaceous). The crater displays several concentric rings and radial faults, and an eroded central bulge. The latter consists of impact breccias and sandstones from the Botucatu/Pirambóia Formation (Cretaceous/Triassic), which have been displaced about above their mean depth in the surrounding area. At least four post-impact lava flows have been identified between the rim and core. The impact origin of the structure is attested by the presence of shatter cones and shocked quartz grains.

== Discovery and studies ==

In 1978, Brazilian geologists A. Paiva Filho, C.A.V. Andrade and L.F. Scheibe

identified an anomalous circular structure in radar images produced by the RADAMBRASIL survey, and called it the Vargeão Dome. In the early 1980s, E. Barbour Jr. and W.A.G. Correa
 studied the structure in detail, in the context of oil/gas surveys of the area, and proposed a volcanic/tectonic origin for the structure. In 1982, Á. P. Crósta and A. Paiva Filho identified it as an impact crater. Shocked quartz was identified by M. V. Coutinho in 1987, and the occurrence of maskelynite glass was reported by J. Hachiro and others in 1993 

== Conservation status ==
The area around and inside the crater has been heavily farmed since the end of the 19th century; Vargeão&#x27;s city hall is located inside the crater, near the southern rim. Nevertheless, the crater is still well-preserved. The local population is well aware of the impact origin of the structure, to the point that the town&#x27;s official nickname is &quot;Meteor City&quot;.

<text>Veevers crater is an impact crater located on a flat desert plain between the Great Sandy and Gibson Deserts in the centre of the state of Western Australia. 

The site is very remote and difficult to visit. The crater was discovered from the air in July 1975 during a government geological survey and named in honour of Australian geologist John Veevers who had worked in the area in the late 1970s. At the time of discovery a meteorite impact origin was suspected, but could not be proven. The subsequent discovery of iron meteorite fragments around the crater by E.M. and C.S. Shoemaker in 1987 removed any doubt about its origin.

== Description ==
The crater has a symmetrical bowl-shaped topography and is considered to be one of the best preserved small meteorite craters on Earth. The wide rim rises about above the plain, while the deepest point of the central depression is below the rim crest; the rim to rim diameter averages about . Based on cosmogenic nuclide exposure dating of the crater walls, the crater is less than 20 thousand years old, while the pristine state of preservation of the ejecta has been used to suggest that it may in fact be less than 4 thousand years old.

The iron meteorite fragments collected around the crater are classified as a coarse octahedrite belonging to chemical class IIAB; the fragments show considerable evidence of deformation presumably related to the impact explosion. It has been inferred that the original meteorite was in the size range of , probably closer to the latter, now dispersed as fragments within the crater breccia and ejecta.

<text>Vepriai is the largest impact crater in Lithuania, named after the town of Vepriai located at its center. The crater is not exposed to the surface, having been eroded and covered by sedimentary rocks during the last glacial period.

Vepriai crater is in diameter and its age is estimated to be greater than 160 ± 10 million years (Middle or Late Jurassic). The meteorite struck soft sandstone and limestone rocks thus its initial depth exceeded but the site was soon covered by sedimentary rocks, sand and clay. A small lake has formed in the Jurassic in the impact site.

The crater was reported in 1978, as proven by occurrence of shatter cones and impact glass in drill-core samples acquired during a geophysical research of the locality.

<doc id="780587" wikidata="Q257834" url="?curid=780587" title="Soft hyphen">
<text>In computing and typesetting, a soft hyphen (Unicode ) or syllable hyphen, is a code point reserved in some coded character sets for the purpose of breaking words across lines by inserting visible hyphens if they fall on the line end but remain invisible within the line.

Two alternative ways of using the soft hyphen character for this purpose have emerged, depending on whether the encoded text will be broken into lines by its recipient, or has already been preformatted by its originator.

== Text to be formatted by the recipient ==
The use of SHY characters in text that will be broken into lines by the recipient is the application context considered by the post-1999 HTML and Unicode specifications, as well as some word-processing file formats. In this context, the soft hyphen may also be called a discretionary hyphen or optional hyphen. It serves as an invisible marker used to specify a place in text where a hyphenated break is allowed without forcing a line break in an inconvenient place if the text is re-flowed. It becomes visible only after word wrapping at the end of a line. The soft hyphen&#x27;s Unicode semantics and HTML implementation are in many ways similar to Unicode&#x27;s zero-width space, with the exception that the soft hyphen will preserve the kerning of the characters on either side when not visible. The zero-width space, on the other hand, will not, as it is considered a visible character even if not rendered, thus having its own kerning metrics.

To show the effect of a soft hyphen in HTML, the words of the following text (from the poem &quot;Spring and Fall&quot; by Gerard Manley Hopkins) have been separated with soft hyphens:

Margaret­Are­You­Grieving­Over­Goldengrove­Unleaving­Leaves­Like­The­Things­Of­Man­You­With­Your­Fresh­Thoughts­Care­For­Can­You­Ah­As­The­Heart­Grows­Older­It­Will­Come­To­Such­Sights­Colder­By­And­By­Nor­Spare­A­Sigh­Though­Worlds­Of­Wanwood­Leafmeal­Lie­And­Yet­You­Will­Weep­And­Know­Why­Now­No­Matter­Child­The­Name­Sorrows­Springs­Are­The­Same­Nor­Mouth­Had­No­Nor­Mind­Expressed­What­Heart­Heard­Of­Ghost­Guessed­It­Is­The­Blight­Man­Was­Born­For­It­Is­Margaret­You­Mourn­For

On HTML browsers supporting soft hyphens, resizing the window will re-break the above text only at word boundaries, and insert a hyphen at the end of each line.

== Text preformatted by the originator ==
The SHY character is also used in text where paragraphs have already been broken into lines, such as certain plain text files, text sent to VT100-style terminal emulators or printers, or pages represented in page description languages. This is the application context originally considered by the EBCDIC and ISO 8859-1 standards and implemented in many VT100 terminal emulators.

Here, SHY is a visible hyphen that is usually visually indistinguishable from a regular hyphen, but has been inserted solely for the purpose of line breaking. The purpose of the soft hyphen here is to distinguish it from any regular hyphen that might have been part of the original spelling of the word. This distinction helps re-use of already formatted text, when line breaks and soft hyphens inserted during word wrapping have to be removed to convert the text back into its unformatted form. For example, the copy or paste function of a terminal emulator can offer to replace line breaks with a space character, and remove any soft hyphens including any immediately following whitespace characters.

An example application that outputs soft hyphens for this reason is the groff text formatter as used on many Unix/Linux systems to display man pages.

== Encodings and definitions ==
Soft hyphen (&quot;SHY&quot;) characters in coded characters sets, roughly in chronological order:
* EBCDIC placed a SHY character (known there as a &quot;syllable hyphen&quot;) at position 202 (0xCA hexadecimal). IBM defined its purpose as a &quot;hyphen used to divide a word at the end of a line [that] may be removed when a program adjusts lines.&quot;
* German standard DIN 31626 defined a C1 control code set defining 0x8D as an &quot;Optional Syllabification Control (OSC)&quot;, a &quot;print control character&quot; for use marking syllable boundaries in long words. This C1 control set was registered in 1979. (Note: this is not the same as the ISO/IEC 6429 C1 control code .)
* ISO 8859-1:1986 (Latin 1) inherited SHY from EBCDIC, but called it &quot;soft hyphen&quot;, placed it at position 0xAD (hexadecimal), and stated its purpose as &quot;for use when a line break has been established within a word&quot;. Other ISO 8859 parts placed it at the same position, with the exception of ISO 8859-11 (Latin/Thai), which lacks it.
* IBM code page 850 (an MS-DOS character set covering all ISO 8859-1 characters) placed it at position 240 = 0xF0.
* SGML&#x27;s &quot;Numeric and Special Graphic&quot; (isonum) character entity set (ISO 8879:1986) includes codice_1 for the ISO 8859-1 soft hyphen.
* Unicode 1.0 (1991) and ISO 10646 (1993) took the first 256 code positions from ISO 8859-1, resulting in SHY at Unicode code point of U+00AD.
* HTML 2 (1995) incorporated the &quot;&amp;shy;&quot; character entity from SGML, but explicitly discouraged its use.
* HTML 4 (1999) redefined the purpose of the character as marking a hyphenation opportunity, which only becomes visible as a hyphen at the end of a line after formatting.
* Unicode 4.0 (2002) changed the category of its SHY character from previously &quot;Pd&quot; (punctuation, dash) to &quot;Cf&quot; (other, format), thereby aligning its interpretation of the character with that of HTML 4.

Other commands for marking hyphenation opportunities in text formatting languages (similar to the HTML 4 and Unicode 4.0 interpretation of SHY):
* troff and groff: codice_2.
* TeX and LaTeX: codice_3

==Security issues==
Soft hyphens, like other invisible characters, have been used to obscure malicious domains or URLs in e-mail spam.

They are also used in emails to try to defeat spam prevention systems. For example, the phrase &quot;I need your assista­nce discreetly&quot; has a soft hyphen in the word assistance which may mean a mail system would not detect the phrase in the email body.

<text>The Vredefort impact structure is the largest verified impact structure on Earth. The crater, which has since been eroded away, has been estimated at across when it was formed. The remaining structure, comprising the deformed underlying bedrock, is located in present-day Free State province of South Africa. It is named after the town of Vredefort, which is near its centre. The structure&#x27;s central uplift is known as the Vredefort Dome. The impact structure was formed during the Paleoproterozoic Era, 2.023 billion (± 4 million) years ago. It is the second-oldest known impact structure on Earth, after Yarrabubba.

In 2005, the Vredefort Dome was added to the list of UNESCO World Heritage Sites for its geologic interest.

==Formation and structure==

The asteroid that hit Vredefort is estimated to have been one of the largest ever to strike Earth since the Hadean Eon some four billion years ago, originally thought to have been approximately in diameter. As of 2022, the bolide was estimated at between in diameter and to have impacted with a vertical velocity of .

The original impact structure is estimated to have had a diameter of at least , with the impact affecting the structure of the surrounding host rock in a circular region around in diameter. Other estimates have placed the original crater diameter closer to . The landscape has since been eroded to a depth of around since formation, obliterating the original crater. The remaining structure, the &quot;Vredefort Dome&quot;, consists of a partial ring of hills in diameter, and is the remains of the central uplift created by the rebound of rock below the impact site after the collision.

Estimates have placed the structure’s age to be 2.023 billion years (± 4 million years) or 2.019/2.020 billion years (± 2-3 million years) old, which places it in the Orosirian Period of the Paleoproterozoic Era. It is the second oldest universally accepted impact structure on Earth. In comparison, it is about 10% older than the Sudbury Basin impact (at 1.849 billion years) and the Yarrabubba impact structure is older than the Vredefort impact structure by about 0.2 billion years. Other purported older impact structures have either poorly constrained ages (Dhala impact structure, India) or highly contentious impact evidence in case of the circa 3.023 billion year old Maniitsoq structure, West Greenland and the circa 2.4 billion year old Suavjärvi structure, Russia. Their classification as impact structures remain controversial and unsettled.

The dome in the centre of the impact structure was originally thought to have been formed by a volcanic explosion, but in the mid-1990s, evidence revealed it was the site of a huge bolide impact, as telltale shatter cones were discovered in the bed of the nearby Vaal River.

This impact structure is one of the few multiple-ringed impact structures on Earth, although they are more common elsewhere in the Solar System. Perhaps the best-known example is Valhalla crater on Jupiter&#x27;s moon Callisto. Earth&#x27;s Moon has some as well. Geological processes, such as erosion and plate tectonics, have destroyed most multiple-ring impact structures on Earth.

The impact distorted the Witwatersrand Basin which was laid down over a period of 250 million years between 950 and 700 million years before the Vredefort impact. The overlying Ventersdorp lavas and the Transvaal Supergroup which were laid down between 700 and 80 million years before the meteorite strike, were similarly distorted by the formation of the impact structure. The rocks form partial concentric rings around the impact structure&#x27;s centre today, with the oldest, the Witwatersrand rocks, forming a semicircle from the centre. Since the Witwatersrand rocks consist of several layers of very hard, erosion-resistant sediments (e.g. quartzites and banded ironstones), they form the prominent arc of hills that can be seen to the northwest of the impact structure&#x27;s centre in the satellite picture above. The Witwatersrand rocks are followed, in succession, by the Ventersdorp lavas at a distance of about from the centre, and the Transvaal Supergroup, consisting of a narrow band of the Ghaap Dolomite rocks and the Pretoria Subgroup of rocks, which together form a band beyond that.

From about halfway through the Pretoria Subgroup of rocks around the impact structure&#x27;s centre, the order of the rocks is reversed. Moving outwards towards where the crater rim used to be, the Ghaap Dolomite group resurfaces at from the centre, followed by an arc of Ventersdorp lavas, beyond which, at between from the centre, the Witwatersrand rocks re-emerge to form an interrupted arc of outcrops today. The Johannesburg group is the most famous one because it was here that gold was discovered in 1886. It is thus possible that if it had not been for the Vredefort impact this gold would never have been discovered.

The centre of the Vredefort impact structure consists of a granite dome (where it is not covered by much younger rocks belonging to the Karoo Supergroup) which is an exposed part of the Kaapvaal craton, one of the oldest microcontinents which formed on Earth 3.9 billion years ago. This central peak uplift, or dome, is typical of a complex impact structure, where the liquefied rocks splashed up in the wake of the meteor as it penetrated the surface.

==Conservation==
The Vredefort Dome World Heritage Site is currently subject to property development, and local owners have expressed concern regarding sewage dumping into the Vaal River and the impact structure. The granting of prospecting rights around the edges of the impact structure has led environmental interests to express fear of destructive mining.

==Community==
The Vredefort Dome in the centre of the impact structure is home to four towns: Parys, Vredefort, Koppies and Venterskroon. Parys is the largest and a tourist hub; both Vredefort and Koppies mainly depend on an agricultural economy.

On 19 December 2011, a broadcasting licence was granted by ICASA to a community radio station to broadcast for the Afrikaans- and English-speaking members of the communities within the impact structure. The Afrikaans name &quot;Koepel&quot; Stereo (Dome Stereo) refers to the dome and announces its broadcast as KSFM. The station broadcasts on 94.9 MHz FM.
