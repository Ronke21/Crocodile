<text>Arthur Horace James (July 14, 1883April 27, 1973) was an American lawyer, politician, and judge. A Republican, he served as the 14th lieutenant governor (1927–1931) and the 31st governor (1939–1943) of Pennsylvania.

==Early life and career==
The oldest of eight children, Arthur James was born in Plymouth, Pennsylvania, to James D. James, a mine foreman, and Rachel (née Edwards) James, a schoolteacher. Both parents were Welsh immigrants. As a child, he worked as a breaker boy and mule driver in the coal mines of northeastern Pennsylvania. His mother died while he was still in grammar school, after which his father tutored him and his siblings.

After graduating from Plymouth High School in 1901, James studied at Dickinson Law School in Carlisle. where he was a member of the varsity basketball team. To help pay for his education he continued to work as a mule driver in the Plymouth mines during his summer vacations. In 1904, he earned his law degree, was admitted to the Luzerne County bar, and began to practice law, first at Plymouth, and later at Wilkes-Barre.

In 1912, he married Ada Morris. They had one son, Arthur H. James Jr., who died at the age of 20, and one daughter, Dorothy James, who studied theater at Syracuse University until the death of her mother in 1935, when she left to keep house for her father, and to act as Pennsylvania&#x27;s First Lady after he became the state&#x27;s governor in 1939.

From 1920 to 1926, he served as district attorney of Luzerne County.
In 1926, James was elected Lieutenant Governor of Pennsylvania after defeating his Democratic opponent, former state Senator W. Clayton Hackett, by 761,619 votes. After serving one term under Governor John S. Fisher, he was elected as a judge of the Superior Court of Pennsylvania, serving from 1932 to 1939.

==Governor of Pennsylvania==
In 1938, incumbent Democratic Governor George H. Earle unsuccessfully challenged Republican James J. Davis for a seat in the United States Senate. James entered the race to succeed Earle as governor, campaigning to reduce taxes, balance the budget, make the state more attractive to businesses, and end political corruption. A strong opponent of Governor Earle&#x27;s &quot;Little New Deal,&quot; he promised to &quot;make a bonfire of all the laws passed by the 1937 legislature.&quot; In the Republican primary, he defeated former Governor Gifford Pinchot, whom James claimed would sell the Republican Party &quot;down the New Deal river,&quot; by a margin of 486,000 votes. He was elected the 31st Governor of Pennsylvania in the general election, defeating Democrat Charles Alvin Jones by more than 279,000 votes. He received more votes than any previous gubernatorial candidate in Pennsylvania.

During his tenure as governor, James created the state Department of Commerce and the Anthracite Emergency Commission, extended the Pennsylvania Turnpike, signed a bill banning sit-down strikes, strengthened the civil service, and reinforced liquor control laws. He also turned the state&#x27;s $58 million deficit into a $75 million surplus. During the early part of World War II, he established the State Council of Defense and the Selective Service Board and later created the Pennsylvania Reserve Defense Corps and the Citizens&#x27; Defense Corps for homeland defense. At the 1940 Republican National Convention in Philadelphia, he was nominated for President of the United States by Joseph N. Pew Jr. He lasted for all six ballots, and endorsed the eventual winner, Wendell Willkie.

==Later life and death==
In 1941, while still governor, James married Emily Radcliffe Case (1893–1984), a widow, and in 1943, when his term as governor ended, they returned to Plymouth where James resumed his law practice. In 1944, Governor Edward Martin appointed James to fill a vacancy on the Superior Court, on which he had previously served, but that same year he was defeated in a reelection bid to remain on the court, losing to Democrat F. Clair Ross.

James died on April 27, 1973, at the age of 89, and is buried in Hanover Green Cemetery, Hanover Township, Pennsylvania.

<text>Henry James Sr. (June 3, 1811December 18, 1882) was an American theologian and the father of the philosopher William James, the novelist Henry James, and the diarist Alice James.

Following a dramatic moment of spiritual enlightenment, he became deeply absorbed in Swedenborgianism, repudiating materialism and following the utopian path to grace. In this way, he was generally out of sympathy with contemporary American leaders of philosophical thought. His influence was felt more in frequent lively debates within his own circle of friends than in public life. He said “I love the fireside rather than the forum.&quot;

==Early life==
James was born on June 3, 1811, in Albany, New York. He was one of twelve children born to Catharine (née Barber) James and William James (1771–1832), an emigrant from Bailieborough, County Cavan, Ireland, to the United States around 1789, who amassed a fortune of about $1.2 million from business dealings in upstate New York State, primarily in Albany real estate, money lending, and his involvement with the building of the Erie Canal.

At the age of thirteen, he was severely burned trying to stamp out a fire in a barn, and lost a leg to amputation. The three years he was bedridden reinforced his studious disposition. After attending The Albany Academy, he entered Union College in 1828 and graduated in 1830. His father, a Presbyterian, disapproved of his religious ideas, but when the patriarch&#x27;s will was broken, he became an independently wealthy man. He studied at Princeton Theological Seminary from 1835 to 1837 to prepare for the ministry, but found himself disconcerted by &quot;enormous difficulties which inhered in its philosophy,&quot; and abandoned the idea of becoming a minister. After Princeton, James then went to England for about a year, and returned in 1838 to New York.

==Career==

Upon James&#x27;s return to New York in 1838, he prepared an edition of Robert Sandeman&#x27;s &quot;Letters on Theron and Aspasio&quot;, which has been called the principal literary document of a Scottish sect that opposed the Presbyterian Church. In his preface to Sandeman&#x27;s work, he called it &quot;a far more faithful exhibition of Gospel truth than any other work.&quot; What specifically interested James was its radically egalitarian message. Sandeman wrote: &quot;In fine, the whole New Testament speaks aloud, that as to the matter of acceptance with God, there is no difference betwixt one man and another; — no difference betwixt the best accomplished gentleman, and the most infamous scoundrel; — no difference betwixt the most virtuous lady and the vilest prostitute ...&quot;

===Swedenborgianism===
Around 1841, James began to be interested in Swedenborgianism when he read some articles in London&#x27;s &quot;Monthly Magazine&quot; on the subject by J. J. Garth Wilkinson, who would become one of James&#x27;s closest friends. In his quest, he met and befriended Ralph Waldo Emerson, but did not find much satisfaction in Emerson&#x27;s thought.

Emerson introduced James to Thomas Carlyle. But it was in the work of Emanuel Swedenborg (1688–1772), the Swedish scientist, religious visionary and teacher, that James found a spiritual home. In May 1844, while living in Windsor, in England, James was sitting alone one evening at the family dinner table after the meal, gazing at the fire, when he had the defining spiritual experience of his life, which he would come to interpret as a Swedenborgian &quot;vastation,&quot; a stage in the process of spiritual regeneration. This experience was an apprehension of, in his own words, &quot;a perfectly insane and abject terror, without ostensible cause, and only to be accounted for, to my perplexed imagination, by some damned shape squatting invisible to me within the precincts of the room, and raying out from his fetid personality influences fatal to life.&quot;

James&#x27;s &quot;vastation&quot; initiated a spiritual crisis that lasted two years, and was finally resolved through the thorough exploration of the work of Swedenborg and Christian mystics. James became convinced that, as he put it, &quot;the curse of mankind, that which keeps our manhood so little and so depraved, is its sense of selfhood, and the absurd abominable opinionativeness it engenders.&quot; He remained attached to Swedenborg&#x27;s thought for the rest of life, and never traveled without carrying Swedenborg&#x27;s works with him.

In 1845, James again returned to the United States and began a lifetime of lecturing about his spiritual discoveries. He devoted his mornings to writing, and published a number of discursive volumes devoted to the exposition of his thought.

===Social thought===
In the late 1840s, James became interested in the former members of Brook Farm, an experiment in communal living at West Roxbury, Massachusetts that lasted from 1841 to 1847, and in Fourierism, the school of utopian socialism that grew out of the thought of French social philosopher Charles Fourier (1772–1837) and which was a major influence in the last several years of Brook Farm. James was interested in utopianism as a stepping stone to the spiritual life.

James was a stern critic of the &quot;gross materiality&quot; of American society, and found in Fourier&#x27;s thought a useful critique. He held most of the leading writers of his day in low regard, with the possible exception of Walt Whitman, though he met and cultivated many of them, including Emerson, Bronson Alcott, Henry David Thoreau, and William Makepeace Thackeray.

James was an advocate of many social reforms, including the abolition of slavery and the liberalization of divorce.

===Theology===
Theologically, James was out of sympathy with the naturalism of much of the religious thought of the nineteenth century. He regarded creation itself as &quot;a purely spiritual process, falling wholly within the realm of affection and thought.&quot; The fundamental theological problem, in his view, is theodicy, or the problem of evil. His Swedenborgian solution to the problem of evil relied on breaking the bond between God and nature, or, put alternatively, between nature and reality. True reality (or God) is, in James&#x27;s view, thoroughly spiritual, in a way that denizens of the natural world can scarcely comprehend. But through intuition of this true reality, James thought, liberation from the illusions of natural appearances—which include time, space, and selfhood—is possible. In such liberation lies salvation, in James&#x27;s view, whereas evil—more specifically, &quot;spiritual&quot; evil, since James distinguishes this from &quot;physical&quot; and &quot;moral&quot; evil—arises from action based on the delusion of selfhood. C. Hartley Grattan says that in James&#x27;s philosophy, &quot;the principle of hell is selfhood and the principle of heaven is brotherly love&quot;. But James was not a slavish follower of Swedenborg. Rather, it was in Swedenborg that he found the most fecund exploration of his central insight that the source of all evil was in attachment to the self.

===Later years===
Although the ideas of James were received by his contemporaries with little enthusiasm, and although he was altogether out of sympathy with his age&#x27;s enthusiasm for science, he never grew discouraged; in fact, some of the best expositions of his thought are to be found in the volumes of his later years. He participated actively in the lives of his children, whose education he had done so much to shape. His society was cultivated by many, who enjoyed his conversation—provided that they were strong enough to bear the sometimes devastating criticism he offered. He delighted in paradox and exaggeration and enjoyed flouting convention. But he shunned formal society, which he found uncongenial. He wrote: &quot;The bent of my nature is towards affection and thought rather than action. I love the fireside rather than the forum.&quot;

===Legacy===
Thoreau&#x27;s description of an encounter with James gives an idea of how his contemporaries saw and judged him:

I met Henry James the other night at Emerson&#x27;s, at an Alcottian conversation, at which, however, Alcott did not talk much, being disturbed by James&#x27;s opposition. The latter is a hearty man enough, with whom you can differ very satisfactorily, both on account of his doctrines and his good temper. He utters &quot;quasi&quot;-philanthropic dogmas in a metaphysic dress; but they are, for all practical purposes, very crude. He charges society with all the crime committed, and praises the criminal for committing it. But I think that all the remedies he suggests out of his head—for he goes no farther, hearty as he is—would leave us about where we are now. For, of course, it is not by a gift of turkeys on Thanksgiving Day that he proposes to convert the criminal, but by a true sympathy with each one,—with him, among the rest, who lying tells the world from the gallows that he has never been treated kindly by a single mortal since he was born. But it is not so easy a thing to sympathize with another, though you may have the best disposition to do it. There is Dobson over the hill. Have not you and I and all the world been trying to sympathize with him since he was born (as doubtless he with us), and yet we have got no further than to send him to the House of Correction once at least; and he, on the other hand, has sent us to another place several times. This is the real state of things as I understand it, at least so far as James&#x27;s remedies. We are now, alas! exercising what charity we actually have, and new laws would not give us any more. But perchance, we might make some improvements in the House of Correction. You and I are Dobson; what will James do for us? 

==Personal life==

On July 28, 1840, James was married to Mary Robertson Walsh (1810–1882), the sister of a fellow Princeton seminarian, by the mayor of New York, in his bride&#x27;s house on Washington Square. The couple lived in New York, and together had five children:

* William James (1842–1910), a philosopher and psychologist, and the first educator to offer a psychology course in the United States.
* Henry James Jr. (1843–1916), an author considered to be among the greatest novelists in the English language who was nominated for the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1911, 1912, and 1916.
* Garth Wilkinson &quot;Wilkie&quot; James (1845–1883), who married Caroline Eames Cary.
* Robertson &quot;Bob&quot; James (1846–1910), who married Mary Lucinda Holton (1849–1922).
* Alice James (1848–1892), a writer who became well known for her diary published posthumously in 1934 with a more complete version published in 1964.

James&#x27;s marriage was a happy one, and when Mary James died on January 29, 1882, his will to live seemed to die with her. His work on yet another volume flagged, and he fell into a state of indolence. He rallied briefly after visits from his sons, called to his side by his daughter, Alice. But he suffered a relapse after Henry Jr. and William left on excursions to Europe. His famous sons never saw him alive again. He died on December 18, 1882, at his residence on Vernon Street in Boston.

On the same day, his son Henry&#x27;s boat docked in New York on his way back to see his father. William James, in London at the time, was kept from full knowledge of his father&#x27;s decline in order not to interfere with a much needed vacation; when he learned that his father was on his deathbed, four days before his final demise, William James wrote a moving letter that his father never read. In it, the famous psychologist wrote:
Henry Sr. made Henry Jr. the executor of his estate, which caused resentment from his eldest son William. Under the terms of his will, Wilkie received a smaller share of the estate than his siblings, because his father felt that he had advanced enough money to him in his lifetime which had been lost in failed business ventures. However, Henry, Alice and Bob felt badly about Wilkie, who suffered from a heart condition and rheumatic fever after injuries incurred in the Civil War, so they decided to redistribute the estate equally. William strongly disagreed with this, arguing that it was easier for Alice and Henry to forfeit a larger share of the estate to Wilkie because they did not have families of their own to support. The matter had not been resolved when Wilkie died in November 1883, less than a year after his father.

<text>Fernando Manuel Silva Couto (; born 2 August 1969) is a Portuguese former professional footballer who played as a centre back.

During a 21-year professional career, he played in a number of top clubs in Portugal, Spain and Italy (12 seasons in the latter country), appearing in nearly 600 competitive matches and winning the double in each country, as well as three UEFA trophies.

At international level, Couto represented the Portugal national team in 110 games, taking part in the 2002 World Cup as well as three European Championships.

==Club career==
Born in Espinho near Porto, Couto joined FC Porto&#x27;s youth system at the age of 17. On 2 June 1988, he made his first-team – and Primeira Liga – debut, playing 90 minutes in a 1–0 away win against Académica de Coimbra in what would be his only appearance of the season for the national champions. He was then released, spending one year apiece with F.C. Famalicão and Académica.

Couto returned to Porto in 1990, being an instrumental defensive unit in the conquest of six titles during his four-year spell. He subsequently moved to Italy with Parma AC, scoring a career-best four goals in 27 games in his first season and adding the campaign&#x27;s UEFA Cup, in a 2–1 aggregate victory over fellow Serie A side Juventus FC

In summer 1996, Couto signed a four-year deal with FC Barcelona, moving alongside former Porto teammate Vítor Baía and English manager Bobby Robson as Luís Figo was also playing for the La Liga club. Regularly used during his early stint, he was less played by the next coach Louis van Gaal, but managed to appear in one of the two European finals the Catalans won, the 1996–97 edition of the UEFA Cup Winners&#x27; Cup.

After two seasons at the Camp Nou, Couto left &quot;Barça&quot; and joined Rome&#x27;s SS Lazio in late June 1998 as teammate Iván de la Peña. He appeared in 22 matches in his first year to help his team to the second place in the league, and featured one minute in the final of the last Cup Winners&#x27; Cup, in a 2–1 win against RCD Mallorca at the Villa Park in Birmingham.

In 2001, Couto failed a doping test for the steroid nandrolone. He denied having taken forbidden substances, but his &quot;B&quot; test confirmed the finding and he eventually served four months out of a nine-month worldwide ban for the offence. He continued to appear regularly for Lazio in the following seasons.

In 2005, aged 36, Couto returned to Parma after 11 years as Lazio was unable to match his wage demands for a contract renewal. After two seasons of regular use he played just 17 matches in 2007–08, with the Emilia-Romagna side also suffering top-flight relegation; as his contract expired, he decided to retire from football.

In June 2010, two years after his retirement, Couto was named general manager at S.C. Braga. He was appointed the club&#x27;s assistant manager for the 2012–13 campaign, leaving in February 2014.

==International career==
As a member of Famalicão in the third division, Couto appeared in four matches as Portugal won the 1989 FIFA World Youth Championship, being part of a group of players dubbed the &quot;Golden Generation&quot; of Portuguese football. He made his debut for the senior team on 19 December 1990, in a friendly with the United States played in Maia (1–0 win).

Always as first choice, Couto represented the nation at UEFA Euro 1996– scoring the game&#x27;s only goal for the eventual quarter-finalists in a group stage fixture against Turkey– Euro 2000 and the 2002 FIFA World Cup, partnering former Porto teammate Jorge Costa in the last two tournaments, the latter of which ended in group stage exit.

Couto became the first Portuguese player to reach 100 caps (in a total of 110) on 11 October 2003, in a 5–3 friendly defeat of Albania. He was selected as captain for Euro 2004, which was played on home soil, starting in the first game against Greece but eventually being relegated to the bench by Ricardo Carvalho; Portugal went on to reach the final of the tournament, in which the team suffered a defeat against the same opponent.

==Style of play==
Considered as one of the greatest Portuguese defenders ever, 
Couto usually played as a centre-back in zonal-marking system during his time with Porto, where he earned a reputation for being a tough and physical defender, with an aggressive and hard-tackling playing style. He was also known for his ability in the air, as well as his capacity to start quick attacking plays after winning back the ball. During his time in Italy, he also adapted himself to different tactical systems; under his Parma manager Nevio Scala, he featured as a man-marking centre-back – or &quot;stopper&quot; – on occasion, or even as a sweeper behind the back-line.

<text>James James (also known by the bardic name &quot;Iago ap Ieuan&quot;) (1832–1902) was a Welsh harpist and musician from Hollybush, Blackwood, Wales. He composed the tune of the Welsh national anthem &quot;Hen Wlad fy Nhadau&quot; (also known as &quot;Land of my Fathers&quot;). Today, the same tune is also used for the Breton anthem, &quot;Bro Gozh ma Zadoù&quot;, and the Cornish anthem, &quot;Bro Goth agan Tasow&quot;.
==Life==
James was born on 4 November 1832, at the &#x27;Ancient Druid Inn&#x27;, Hollybush, in the parish of Bedwellty, Monmouthshire. He was the son of Evan James (1809–1878) and Elizabeth Stradling of Caerphilly. His father, a Welsh poet who wrote under the pen-name of &quot;leuan ab lago&quot;, moved with his family to Pontypridd, where he carried on the business of weaver and wool merchant, in about 1844. His son James assisted him in the business.

James James composed the melody which was later to be known as &quot;Hen Wlad fy Nhadau&quot; in January 1856. Its initial title was &quot;Glan Rhondda&quot; (The banks of the Rhondda), giving rise to the tradition that the tune had come to James as he walked on the bank of the River Rhondda. His father, Evan James, wrote the lyrics that eventually became the words of the Welsh national anthem.

James James died in Aberdare in the Cynon Valley on 11 January 1902. He was buried in the local cemetery at Aberdare, in the same grave as his wife Cecilia and daughter Louisa.

A memorial to James James and his father, in the shape of two figures representing the muses of Poetry and Music, stands in Ynysangharad Park, Pontypridd.

<doc id="772780" wikidata="Q1860977" url="?curid=772780" title="Football in India">
<text>[[Association football]] is one of the most popular sports in India. The 2017 FIFA U-17 World Cup was the first FIFA event the country hosted. It was called the most successful FIFA U-17 World Cup ever, with a record-breaking attendance of 1,347,133, exceeding China&#x27;s record of 1,230,976 from 1985. India also hosted the 2022 FIFA U-17 Women&#x27;s World Cup and bid to host the 2019 FIFA U-20 World Cup.

The Indian national football team qualified for the 1950 FIFA World Cup but did not participate.

==History==

===Pre-independence===
British soldiers introduced football into India in the mid-nineteenth century. Games were initially played between army teams but clubs were soon set up around the country. In 1872, Calcutta FC was the first football club to be established, though the side may have originated as a rugby club that switched codes as late as 1894. Other early clubs include Dalhousie AC, Traders Club and Naval Volunteers Club. Several other football clubs such as Sovabazar, Mohun Bagan and Aryan Club were established in Calcutta in the 1890s. Calcutta was then the capital of British India and soon became the hub of football. Tournaments like the Gladstone Cup, the Trades Cup and the Cooch Behar Cup were started around this time. The Durand Cup and IFA Shield were both started in the late nineteenth century.

The first Indian team to achieve success was Sovabazar Club, which won the Trades Cup in 1892. Mohun Bagan Athletic Club, which was set up in modern-day West Bengal in 1889, became famous in 1911 when it became the first Indian team to win the IFA Shield, a tournament previously won only by British teams based in India. They defeated East Yorkshire Regiment 2–1 in the tournament&#x27;s final in a victory that is still regarded as one of the greatest win by an Indian football team before independence.

The Indian Football Association (IFA) was established in Calcutta in 1893 but had no Indians on its board until the 1930s. The All India Football Federation (AIFF), the national governing body of football in India, was formed in 1937 but did not become affiliated with FIFA until at least a decade later. India insisted on playing barefoot whereas other national sides wore boots. Footballer Jyotish Chandra Guha brought global attention to Indian football when he became the first Indian to appear with the English Football League club Arsenal in 1930.

===The golden age===
India qualified by default for the 1950 FIFA World Cup in Brazil because all of their scheduled opponents withdrew. India did not compete in the tournament. It was not because of a lack of financial assistance, particularly to purchase tickets for the sea journey, or because the team were not allowed to play barefoot. According to sports journalist Jaydeep Basu, the financial barrier was solved as state associations provided financial help to the AIFF and that FIFA also promised to provide money.

FIFA had imposed a rule banning barefoot play following the 1948 Olympics where India had played barefoot. According to then-captain Shailen Manna, this story was circulated to justify the AIFF&#x27;s decision to not participate. Since 1950, the Indian national team has not come close to qualifying for the World Cup. The AIFF had organised training is Calcutta for the 1950 World Cup and the board organised a series of meetings relating to India&#x27;s participation but was not able to reach a decision. One to two weeks before the World Cup, the AIFF resorted to coming up with excuses to abandon the World Cup trip. This did not face much criticism in 1948 because the FIFA World Cup was not as popular as it is now.

1951–1962 is widely considered the &quot;golden age&quot; of Indian football. In this period, the national team won numerous titles under the coaching of Syed Abdul Rahim. India won the gold medal in the first Asian Games in 1951, beating Iran by one goal. In 1956, no longer playing barefoot, India reached the semi-final in the 1956 Melbourne Olympics, becoming the first Asian country to do so and ranking fourth in the tournament. In 1962, India again won the gold in the Asian Games at Jakarta, defeating South Korea 2–1. India also won the Merdeka Cup and the Asian Quadrangular Football Tournament, while East Bengal garnered good reviews after touring Romania. Also in 1951, India achieved their highest World Football Elo Rating of 31. According to former FIFA president Sepp Blatter, India is &quot;The sleeping giant of world football&quot;.

===Decline===

Rahim&#x27;s death in the year 1963 on 11th June, caused the Indian national team to gradually lose their position as a top Asian team. India has not qualified for the Olympics since 1960. India qualified for their first Asian Cup in 1964 but failed to win the title. In an international tournament at the 1970 Asian Games, India won the bronze medal after defeating Japan 1–0. The Indian national team qualified for the 1984 AFC Asian Cup for the first time since 1964 but failed to qualify for the knockout stage after finishing last in their group of five teams.

The Indian youth team jointly won the Youth Asian Cup with Iran in 1974, the first and only title for India at the youth level. In club football, on 24 September 1977, Mohun Bagan held onto a 2–2 draw at the Eden Gardens stadium in Calcutta, against a Pelé-led New York Cosmos. Mohun Bagan would have won the tie had it not been for a controversial penalty awarded to the visiting team that ensured the draw. The next day, the newspaper &quot;Ananda Bazar Patrika&quot; described Goutam Sarkar as &quot;India&#x27;s very own Beckenbauer&quot;.

The Indian women&#x27;s team as they began playing in the 1970s. In 1975, their first manager was Sushil Bhattacharya. The Indian women&#x27;s team were runners-up in the AFC Women&#x27;s Asian Cup in 1980 and 1983. In the 1990s, the women&#x27;s team rapidly declined and a series of defeats followed. In 2009, FIFA delisted the Indian women&#x27;s team from the world rankings.

===2007–present===

In August 2007, the Indian national team won the Nehru Cup for the first time, beating Syria 1–0. In August of the following year, India defeated Tajikistan 4–1 to win the AFC Challenge Cup and qualified for the 2011 AFC Asian Cup in Qatar. In August 2009, India again won the Nehru Cup, beating Syria on penalties (6–5).

In January 2011, India played in the 2011 Asian Cup, the country&#x27;s first Asian Cup for 24 years. India was eliminated in the group stage, which included South Korea, Australia, and Bahrain.

Since the 2011 Asian Cup, the All India Football Federation (AIFF) has been working to improve Indian football. They allowed former coach Bob Houghton to coach the Indian team in the 2012 AFC Challenge Cup qualifiers. After going first in their AFC Challenge Cup group, Houghton was replaced by Wim Koevermans. The India national under-23 football team won the first round of the 2012 Olympics qualifiers against Myanmar but were eliminated by Qatar. India played their next official matches against United Arab Emirates in the 2014 FIFA World Cup qualifiers, which India lost on aggregate 5–2.

In 2014, India hosted the first Unity World Cup in Goa, Hyderabad and Bangalore. India has participated in and hosted the 2017 FIFA U-17 World Cup tournament. This was the first time a team representing India participated in the finals of a FIFA-organised world tournament. India was placed in Group A along with the United States, Ghana and Colombia. On 6 October 2017, India played their first match in the FIFA U-17 World Cup in front of 47,000 people against the United States, losing the match 0–3. India played their second match against Colombia. In the 82nd minute, Jeakson Singh became the first Indian goal scorer in the finals of a FIFA-organised tournament. For the third match of the group stage, India played Ghana, losing the match 4–0 and finishing at the bottom of Group A.

In 2018 Indian youth football teams made history by defeating Argentina U-20 2–1 in the COTIF cup, as well as Iraq U-16, the defending champions of the AFC U-16 Championship (now the AFC U-17 Championship), by 1–0. The U-16 team qualified for the 2018 AFC U-16 Championship, where they came close to qualifying for the 2019 FIFA U-17 World Cup, but lost to South Korea by a single goal in the quarterfinal.

The Indian national team qualified for the 2019 AFC Asian Cup after missing the 2015 edition. India beat Thailand by 4–1, their biggest-ever win at the Asia Cup and their first win in 55 years. Nevertheless, they lost both of their next two group matches against UAE and Bahrain by 0−2 and 0−1 respectively and finished at the bottom of the group, thus failing to move to the knockout stage.

==Administration==
Football in India is administered by the All India Football Federation (AIFF), which is affiliated with the Asian Football Confederation (AFC) and the worldwide football governing body FIFA. The India national football team has entered the regional Asian Cup competition but has never competed in a World Cup. The India women&#x27;s national football team has also played in competitions, and has its own inter-state and state competitions. Youth football is administered by the Sports Authority of India.

==National team==
The India national football team is governed by the AIFF and is a member of the Asian Football Confederation. Since 1948, the AIFF has been affiliated with FIFA, the international governing body for world football. In 1954, the AIFF became one of the founding members of the AFC. There are other Indian national teams, such as the under-23 team and the under-17 team. 

The following list includes the performance of all of India&#x27;s national teams at major competitions.

===Men&#x27;s senior team===
The Indian senior national team had several successes during their initial years, but is no longer considered one of the best in Asia. The national team&#x27;s highest achievement is winning two gold medals at the Asian Games.

===Women&#x27;s senior team===

The women&#x27;s national team was started in the 1970s; they were twice runners-up in the Women&#x27;s Asian Cup in the early 1980s. After the AIFF took charge of the team, they began to suffer massive defeats and declined in the late 2000s. In the late 2010s, the AIFF revived the team to empower women&#x27;s football. The AIFF won the hosting bid for the 2022 AFC Women&#x27;s Asian Cup.

&quot;A red box around the year indicates tournaments played within India&quot;

===FIFA World Cup===

India has never played in the finals of the FIFA World Cup. After gaining independence in 1947, India managed to qualify for the World Cup held in 1950. This was due to Myanmar, Indonesia, and the Philippines withdrawing from qualification round. However, prior to the start of the tournament, India withdrew due to the expenses required in getting the team to Brazil. But this reason was untrue because FIFA was ready to give money to India (AIFF) for their trip to Brazil. Other reasons cited for why India withdrew include FIFA not allowing Indian players to play in the tournament &quot;barefoot&quot; and the All India Football Federation not considering the FIFA World Cup an important tournament compared to the Olympics.

After withdrawing from the 1950 FIFA World Cup, India did not enter the qualifying rounds of the tournament between 1954 and 1982. Since the 1986 qualifiers, with the exception of the 1990 edition of the tournament, the team participated in World Cup qualification, but has yet to qualify for the finals again.

===AFC Asian Cup===
India has qualified for the AFC Asian Cup five times. The team played their first Asian Cup in 1964. The team managed to qualify following other nations&#x27; refusal to play against India due to political reasons. India managed to finish the tournament as runners-up to hosts Israel, with Inder Singh finishing as joint top-scorer. Since then, India has failed to progress beyond the first round of the Asian Cup, with their participation at the 1984 and 2011 Asian Cups, and most recently the 2019 Asian Cup.

In June 2022, India qualified for the 2023 AFC Asian Cup after winning all the matches in the third round of 2023 AFC Asian Cup qualification. This is the first time ever India qualified consecutively for the continental championship.

===Summer Olympics===

India competed in four straight Olympic football tournaments between 1948 and 1960. Their sole 1948 Olympics match against France was also India&#x27;s first ever international match since the country gained independence in 1947. During the match, a majority of the Indian side played barefoot. The match ended in a 2–1 defeat, with Sarangapani Raman scoring the lone goal for India. India then returned to the Olympics four years later where they took on Yugoslavia in the preliminary rounds. The team suffered a 10–1 defeat, India&#x27;s largest margin of defeat in a competitive match, and were knocked out.

Four years later, during the 1956 Olympics, India managed to reach the semi-finals and finish fourth. After India&#x27;s first round opponents, Hungary, withdrew from the tournament, the team played against hosts Australia in the quarter-finals. A Neville D&#x27;Souza hat-trick, the first by an Asian footballer in the Olympics, helped India win 4–2. However, in the semi-finals, India once again suffered defeat against Yugoslavia, going down 4–1. In the bronze medal match, India were defeated 3–0 by Bulgaria.

In 1960, India competed in Group D with Hungary, France and Peru. India ended the group in last place, drawing once. India have since failed to qualify for another Olympic games.

===Asian Games===
India competed in eleven Asian Games, starting from 1951 to 1998, except the 1990 and 1994 editions. In 1951 Asian Games India won their first match against Indonesia in the first round and then defeated Japan in semi-final and went on to win against Iran in the final in front of the home crowd. The achievement of the Indian team was a special one as they became the first ever Asian Games gold medalists in football.

Though the next two tournaments proved to be less successful for the team, they bounced back by winning gold at the 1962 Asian games by defeating the Asian Cup winners South Korea. The team failed to defend their title in 1966 and went on to claim the bronze medal in 1970.

This was the last time India ever finished on the medal podium, the next years proved to be hard to regain their dominance as the side went through a sharp decline. The team made their return in 1998.

====SAFF Championship====
India has been the most successful team in the competition, winning overall eight titles. The team played in the knockout stage of every tournament except in 1993, when the tournament was in a league format. The team also boasts a prestigious record of claiming medal at every championship played so far. India has played in the final of every championship except the 2003, tournament where they claimed bronze medal.
===South Asian Games===
India has participated in every edition of senior football at the South Asian Games, except in 1984. The team emerged as champions in 1985, 1987, and 1995. They also took home silver in 1993, and bronze medals in 1989 and 1995.

<text>Thomas L. James () is a United States Army lieutenant general who serves as the deputy commander of the United States Space Command. He previously served as the acting commander of Combined Joint Task Force–Space Operations. He is the first Army space operations officer to reach the rank of major general.

== Military career ==
James first enlisted in the Mississippi National Guard in 1983, where he was assigned in medical and special forces units. After obtaining a degree, he was commissioned into the United States Army in 1990 as an army aviator.

On 15 July 2014, James took command of the 1st Space Brigade. After this command tour, he was assigned as the director of space policy implementation of Office of the Under Secretary for Policy.

James served as deputy commander of the Joint Functional Component Command for Space. While in this position, he was promoted to brigadier general on 14 November 2017. After a 2017 reorganization, he then served as the director of operations, plans, and exercises of the Joint Force Space Component Command.

With the creation of the United States Space Command in August 2019, James became the director of operations while dual-hatted as the first commander of the newly established Joint Task Force–Space Defense (JTF-SD). After almost two years, he was nominated for promotion to major general. In 2021, he released his vision for the unit. He got promoted on 29 July 2021, making him the first Army space operations officer to achieve the rank of major general.

James relinquished command of JTF-SD on 4 November 2022. He thereafter was assigned as deputy commander of Combined Joint Task Force-Space Operations, a planned subordinate command of U.S. Space Command.

In July 2023, James was nominated for promotion to lieutenant general with assignment as the deputy commander of United States Space Command.

<text>Thomas Lemuel James (March 29, 1831 – September 11, 1916) was an American journalist, government official, and banker who served as the United States Postmaster General in 1881.

==Early life and family==
James was born in Utica, New York, to William James and Jane Maria Price. His grandparents on both sides had emigrated from Wales in 1800. He had very little formal schooling, though studied for a short time at the Utica Academy. At the age of 15, James learned the trade of printing at the office of Utica &quot;Liberty Press&quot; under Westley Bailey, a noted abolitionist of the time. The abolition paper printed here later partnered with Francis B. Fisher in Hamilton, New York to form the Whig newspaper &quot;Madison County Journal&quot; which he bought in 1851. When the Republican party made their first canvass in 1856, the newspaper merged with the &quot;Democratic Reflector&quot; under the name of the &quot;Democratic Republican&quot;, which would lead the opposition against the Know Nothing Party.

James married four times, first to Emily Ida Freedburn in 1852, then to E. R. Borden, later to Edith Colborne, and in 1911 to Florence MacDonnell Gaffney.

==Government career==
For the next ten years, he would continue in the field of journalism while also serving as a canal toll collector in Hamilton from 1854 to 1855. By 1861 he was made an inspector of customs in New York City and promoted three years later to weigher. In 1863 he received the honorary degree of Master of Arts from Hamilton College. James later received honorary LL.D. degrees from Madison College (now Colgate University), the College of St. Francis Xavier in New York City, and St. John&#x27;s University, also in New York City.

James was appointed to the position of deputy collector in 1870 and put in charge of the warehouse division and bonded warehouses of the port. James had much success in the new position, organizing the records of the division, which had been in confusion, in only a month, and bringing the work up to date, which had been up to three years behind, in only six months. Afterwards, he was appointed by Chester A. Arthur, then Collector of the Port of New York, to be a member of the civil service board of the collector&#x27;s and surveyor&#x27;s offices and made its chairman. He became one of the first public officials to advocate for the reform of civil service by appointing positions on the basis of examination and merit.

James urged President Grant to allow him to succeed Alonzo B. Cornell as Surveyor of the Port. Grant instead did one better and made him the Postmaster of New York City on March 17, 1873, and four years later reappointed by President Hayes. James instituted several reforms during his terms, including increasing the efficiency of the postal workforce and improving postal facilities wherever possible. Once General Arthur stepped down, James was offered the position but turned it down as he did not feel it right to supersede his superior. However, David M. Key resigned as Postmaster General in 1880, and James was offered that position by Hayes instead. After consulting with his friends, he declined it as well. He was asked to be the Republican nominee for mayor of New York the same year but turned this down also.

===United States Postmaster General===
On March 5, 1881, President Garfield announced his new cabinet, which included James as Postmaster General. Stepping down from his previous position as Postmaster of New York (which was to be succeeded by his son-in-law), he entered into office two days later. In only ten months he enacted lasting reforms. When he first took office, he found an annual deficit of $2 million, varying in amounts with few exceptions going back to 1851. He immediately began a policy of reform, making reductions in the star service amounting to $1,713,541, and in the steamboat service saving over $300,000, and thus clearing the debt. Moreover, he cooperated with the Department of Justice to undertake a thorough investigation of abuses and frauds within his department. The end result of this was the famous Star routes trials. In giving his annual report to Congress, he declared that his reforms would allow for a two or three-cent reduction in postage, which was enacted shortly thereafter. He also set up a convention of money ordering with Jamaica and the Australian colonies. However shortly after with the assassination of Garfield and Arthur becoming president, the entire cabinet would have been shuffled, and James decided to resign in December of the same year and withdrew from politics altogether.

==Later life==
He later became president of the Lincoln National Bank in 1882, as well as the Lincoln Safe-deposit Company of New York., and serving on their board of directors until his death. James moved to Tenafly, New Jersey in 1885. By 1896 he again entered politics, serving as the mayor of Tenafly. He died in New York City, and is interred at the Church of the Heavenly Rest in Manhattan.

James was one of the founders and the first &quot;Grand Monarch&quot; of the Mystic Order of Veiled Prophets of the Enchanted Realm, an appendant body in Freemasonry.

<doc id="772788" wikidata="Q1439330" url="?curid=772788" title="Gaunt's Ghosts">
<text>Gaunt&#x27;s Ghosts is a series of military science fiction novels by Dan Abnett, set in the &quot;Warhammer 40,000&quot; universe. It was inspired by the &quot;Sharpe&quot; series of books written by Bernard Cornwell.

As of 2019, the series spans 16 novels which document the efforts of the Tanith First, a highly skilled yet unappreciated light infantry regiment of the Imperial Guard, during the Sabbat Worlds Crusade. The protagonist is Colonel-Commissar Ibram Gaunt, one of the few political commissars of the Imperium to be officially awarded command of a regiment.

Although Gaunt is the primary character, the perspective from which the novels are told shifts regularly to encompass a wider view of events – it is usually told from the Imperial point of view, though the perspective is occasionally seen through the eyes of antagonists. Elements of the series later reappeared in other series by Abnett, including the &quot;Eisenhorn&quot; and &quot;Ravenor&quot; trilogies, and has resulted in two spin-off novels, &quot;Double Eagle&quot; and &quot;Titanicus&quot;.

The series began as a continuing set of loosely connected short stories in the Black Library magazine &quot;Inferno!&quot; (issues 4, 8, and 30). The next short piece, entitled &quot;Vermilion Level&quot;, was written out to novel length as &quot;First and Only&quot; and published as the Black Library&#x27;s first original novel (the book line up until that point consisting of reprints of novels from the pre-Black Library days and anthologies of short fiction taken from &quot;Inferno!&quot; magazine). The original short pieces subsequently appeared as flashback-chapters in &quot;Ghostmaker&quot;, the second book.

There are also ancillary novels devoted to minor characters in the main series and a mock &quot;historical book&quot; about the war in which the books take place, as well as merchandise such as badges, T-shirts, and special editions of the books themselves.

==Publication history==
The novels fall into a series of four-story arcs, of which three have been completed while publication of the last is still ongoing.

After November 2002, the first five novels (from &quot;First and Only&quot; to &quot;The Guns of Tanith&quot;) were reprinted with new cover art by Adrian Smith; Smith has since drawn every cover illustration to date, with the exception of &quot;The Iron Star&quot; which used a stock image of the Tanith regimental badge. Previously, cover artwork had been created by a variety of artists.

The &quot;Founding&quot; and &quot;Saint&quot; story arcs have been released as hardcover omnibus editions, with paperback editions which were released in February and August 2007 respectively. The publication of &quot;The Iron Star&quot; took the form of a 1,200-copy limited edition novelette which was only available for purchase at the 2008 UK Games Day and the 2009 Games Day in Germany.

A prequel novel, titled &quot;The Vincula Insurgency&quot;, was released in June 2022. 

==Synopsis==
The series follows the exploits of Colonel-Commissar Ibram Gaunt and his regiment of scouts and recon specialists, the Tanith First-and-Only (nicknamed &quot;Gaunt&#x27;s Ghosts&quot;), as they serve in the Sabbat Worlds Crusade. Their battles are normally against the forces of Chaos, although they briefly face orks on Typhon Eight. Up until &quot;Guns of Tanith&quot; the Ghosts are mainly pitted against heretical rebels armies, but on Phantine and in most of the campaigns following it they face the well-trained and elite Blood Pact. By the end of &quot;Only in Death&quot;, the Ghosts have been serving in the Crusade for roughly twelve years.
Each novel begins with an extract from a fictional book called &quot;A History of the Later Imperial Crusades&quot;, which briefly explains the situation in which the Ghosts have been deployed. These extracts are written in a past tense, implying that they were written after the Sabbat Worlds Crusade ends, and do not normally refer specifically to the Tanith First.

===&quot;First and Only&quot;===
&quot;First and Only&quot; is the first novel in the series (and, in fact, was Abnett&#x27;s first published novel), introducing Gaunt, his regiment, and the Sabbat Worlds Crusade. While deployed in the theatres of Fortis Binary and Menazoid Epsilon, the Ghosts become embroiled in a plot by an ambitious general officer to supplant Warmaster Macaroth as supreme commander of the Crusade force.

===&quot;Ghostmaker&quot;===

&quot;Ghostmaker&quot; is a collection of short stories originally printed in the short fiction magazine &quot;Inferno!&quot;, published by the Black Library. Through a series of vignettes, Abnett details the fall of Tanith and the founding of the Ghosts, followed by particular episodes focusing on the lives of some of the noteworthy members of the Ghosts, including Gaunt, Col. Colm Corbec, Maj. Elim Rawne, Sgt. Ceglan Varl, and Privates Larkin, Caffran, and Milo. The book also establishes the Ghosts&#x27; rivalry with the &quot;Royal Volpone&quot; guard regiment and their commanding officer, Colonel (later General) Sturm, which plays out in the subsequent novel &quot;Necropolis&quot;. After the fall of Tanith, the book is focused on four main theatres of operation:

====Voltis City, Voltemond====
Voltemond is described in &quot;Ghostmaker&quot; as a temperate world, similar to Earth, with extensive marshlands around Voltis City, the planetary capital, which was under Chaos control before the events of &quot;Ghostmaker&quot;. The chapter begins with the Tanith First &quot;Gaunt&#x27;s Ghosts&quot; saving the Ketzok 17th &quot;Serpents&quot; artillery regiment from an ambush by Chaos Space Marines. The Tanith are then ordered to infiltrate and assault the main water-gate and sanitation outfall of Voltis to mine the walls and form a breach for an assault by the Royal Volpone 50th storm troopers, known as the &quot;Bluebloods&quot;. The assault on the water-gate is repelled when the traitors open the floodgates and flush the Tanith out; however, Sergeant Cluggan leads a successful attack on the sanitation outfalls, creating a breach for the armoured assault. As the Ghosts withdraw, General Noches Sturm of the Royal Volpone and his adjutant, Major Gilbear, both of whom were disdainful of Gaunt and his &quot;low-born&quot; soldiers, order the Ketzok to bombard the Tanith as they fall back to their base. Three hundred men, including Sergeant Cluggan, are killed and another two hundred wounded. Gaunt almost faces a court-martial when he punches Colonel Ortiz, the Ketzok commander, but is let off when Ortiz claims that his injuries were caused by his Basilisk artillery vehicle&#x27;s recoil. He proceeds to level a threat at General Sturm.

====Fortis Binary====
Fortis Binary is described as a forge-world, a planet-wide factory that fell to Chaos. &quot;First and Only&quot; describes how the Ghosts manage to sabotage a Chaos ritual after Lord Militant General Hechtor Dravere orders them on a suicidal attack on an enemy trench line. This marks the first demonstration of the hatred that Colonel Draker Flense, the commander of the Jantine Patricians who suggested that Dravere give the assault order, has for Colonel-Commissar Gaunt.

====Menazoid Epsilon====
A death world on the edge of the Menazoid Clasp, Epsilon was the site of three shrines to Chaos, designated Primaris, Secundus and Tertius by Imperial tacticians. Beneath Shrine Target Primaris was a Standard Template Constructor, a relic from over ten millennia before the events of &quot;First and Only&quot;, which made Iron Men, a pattern of robotic warriors; the traitorous General Dravere, assisted by the mutated, radical Inquisitor Heldane, Colonel Draker Flense and his Jantine Patricians attempted to seize power and overturn the commander of the Sabbat Worlds Crusade, Warmaster Macaroth, using the Iron Men. However, the machine was corrupted by Chaos and Commissar Gaunt destroyed it, despite the psychic puppetry of the Inquisitor, who died after his &quot;instrument&quot; – Imperial Agent Fereyd, the man into whom Heldane had extended his consciousness – was explosively killed. Colonel Flense also attempted to get his revenge on Gaunt and the Ghosts, as Gaunt had field-executed Flense&#x27;s father, General Aldo Dercius, many years previously. The Jantine shock troops annihilated the Tanith Seventh platoon commanded by Sergeant Blane, but were themselves killed to a man by Gaunt&#x27;s allies, the Vitrian Dragoons. Gaunt stabbed Flense to death beneath Target Primaris, before escaping along with his men.

====Monthax====
The jungle world of Monthax is the setting for the end of &quot;Ghostmaker&quot;, when Gaunt and his men encounter the alien Eldar as they struggle to wipe out a Chaos infestation. The Ghosts have to co-operate once again with the Royal Volpone 50th, and with an inquisitor who had accused Brin Milo of witchcraft. They discover an ancient portal leading to one of the Eldar&#x27;s craftworlds, self-sustaining cities in space, which the inquisitor, Lilith Abferquan, closes after the alien Farseer guarding the portal dies. At the end of this battle, the Ghosts lost an excellent leader, Sergeant Lerod.

Aside from these battles, &quot;Ghostmaker&quot; is interspersed with short stories (originally published in &quot;Inferno!&quot;) in other war zones such as Blackshard, Caligula and Oskray Hive which are used to develop individual characters; for example, the character and leadership qualities of Dermon Caffran are displayed in his actions at Oskray Hive, where he commands an infiltration force which causes the fall of the enemy stronghold, and continue to be exhibited upon his promotion to Sergeant in &quot;His Last Command&quot;.

===&quot;Necropolis&quot;===
The beginning of the novel is told from many perspectives – ranging from the rich nobility to low-class civilians – and tells of the opening phases of the siege on Vervunhive. The mega-city&#x27;s neighbouring hive, Ferrozoica, amasses an army and marches on their former rival with an unknown agenda. The Vervun Primary militia prepares to repel the invasion forces, but as Vervunhive&#x27;s High Master refuses to believe that Ferrozoica has mobilised against them, they are not given permission to arm their defence batteries before the Zoicans fire the opening salvos. Much of Vervunhive is plunged into panic and thousands perish in the first few days, and aid from the Imperial Guard is called for.

The Tanith First-and-Only is deployed as part of the reinforcement army sent by Warmaster Macaroth. They learn that Ferrozoica, whom Vervunhive had fought in the Trade War ninety years before, had silenced communications with its neighbours in recent months and began arming. The influence of Chaos is evident. Colonel-Commissar Gaunt and his Ghosts face opposition from not only the enemy, but also their fellow Guard regiments and the local politicians.

&quot;Necropolis&quot; is a significant point in the series; at the end of the novel, the under-strength Tanith First receives an influx of replacement soldiers from the militia and general populace of Vervunhive. A number of major characters are introduced in the novel. A short story titled &quot;In Remembrance&quot; directly follows the siege of Vervunhive, and is included in &quot;The Founding&quot; (the first Omnibus).

===&quot;Honour Guard&quot;===
The Ghosts are sent to the Shrineworld Hagia, religious capital of the Sabbat worlds and homeworld of the revered Saint Sabbat herself, to reclaim the holy world from the clutches of Pater Sin and his so-called &quot;Infardi&quot;. During their campaign to reclaim the Doctrinopolis – the planet&#x27;s central city – Gaunt, who has command of the ground forces, is forced into a trap set in one of the most holy structures in the city. A warp-beacon is activated in the process, and a Chaos fleet advances on Hagia to obliterate the Imperial forces.

With just eighteen days until the fleet (large enough to wipe out the liberation force even if the fleet were a quarter its current size) arrives, Gaunt is given one last chance to redeem himself by the arrogant and pompous Lord-General Lugo: recover the Saint&#x27;s remains and holy relics from the Shrinehold in the Sacred Hills for evacuation. The Ghosts are appointed as the honour guard of these relics, and together with units from the Pardus armoured regiments they form a convoy and journey into the mountains. However, much of Sin&#x27;s Infardi horde has pulled back into the hills; leaving the Ghosts with no choice but to fight the heretics while at the same time fighting the elements and navigating the unfamiliar terrain.

&quot;Honour Guard&quot; introduces new characters who become central figures in the Tanith First, as well as those who play a key role throughout &quot;the Saint&quot; arc, such as Commissar Viktor Hark, Ayatani Zweil, Lijah Cuu and Pater Sin. It also features spectacular armour clashes and reveals more of Gaunt&#x27;s character.

===&quot;The Guns of Tanith&quot;===
The novel begins with the Tanith First training to take part in the airborne assault on Cirenholm, a dome-city perched above Phantine&#x27;s toxic Scald. The archenemy&#x27;s elite Blood Pact have captured the city, which the Imperial forces plan to use as a staging ground for their campaign to reclaim Ouranberg, one of Phantine&#x27;s largest cities and a major source of promethium. After the Ghosts successfully infiltrate the Blood Pact&#x27;s defences and prevent a disastrous loss for the Imperium, Lord-General Van Voytz re-considers his approach on the Ouranberg invasion.

A number of Ghosts are hand-picked to form specialist kill-teams, placed in a regime of additional jump-training and covertly deployed into Ouranberg prior to the invasion. Codenamed &quot;Operation Larisel&quot;, their mission is to kill Sagittar Slaith; the Chaos commander of the Blood Pact holding Ouranberg. Doing so will break the morale of the Chaos worshippers and enable the Imperial forces to recapture Ouranberg with greater ease. The task is made more daunting with the prospect of thousands of Blood Pact troopers and loxatl mercenaries standing between them and their target. However, the rest of the Tanith First face their own trials as they await deployment; a great unease is brewing between the Tanith and the Verghastite soldiers, and a crime case involving several Ghosts highlights this divide.

The Phantine XX Fighter Corps introduced in &quot;The Guns of Tanith&quot; appear in a spin-off novel – titled &quot;Double Eagle&quot;, also by Dan Abnett.

===&quot;Straight Silver&quot;===
Still under the command of Van Voytz, the Tanith First is deployed as part of the Imperial Expeditionary Force to Aexe Cardinal, where a deadlocked land war has been raging for forty years between the Aexe Alliance (a handful of loyal nation-states) and the Chaos-corrupted Shadik Republic. Warmaster Macaroth insists that the Aexe Alliance is to remain in command of the campaign, with strained success. The Alliance employs methods of warfare considered obsolete and inefficient according to the modern standard tactics of the Imperial Guard.

Gaunt is quickly frustrated with the brutal strategies and lack of reliable intelligence, and disagrees with the deployment of the scout-specialist Ghosts as grunts in the trenches. Van Voytz and Count Golke – the Alliance/Imperial liaison – negotiate with Alliance Command and agree to a compromise: one half of the Tanith First is sent to the northern Montorq forests to scout the area, while the other is redeployed to the Seiberq Pocket – the most dangerous section of the war zone – where they are tasked with infiltrating the Shadik lines and destroying the enemy&#x27;s newly developed siege guns.

&quot;Straight Silver&quot; is the first novel in which the Tanith First does not see a campaign through to its conclusion: after successfully taking out the siege-guns in the Seiberq Pocket and repelling a Blood Pact flanking manoeuvre in the Montorq Forest, the Ghosts are withdrawn from the front lines and redeployed to Herodor.

===&quot;Sabbat Martyr&quot;===
At the request of the reincarnated Saint Sabbat, the Tanith First-and-Only is summoned to the remote and tactically insignificant world Herodor. The Civitas Beati, a holy city dedicated to the Saint, is under assault from a legion of Blood Pact, led by Enok Innokenti. While the Ghosts prepare to defend the city alongside the local PDF force, Gaunt learns the truth of the situation: the woman posing as the reincarnated Saint is Sanian, an esholi whom the Ghosts encountered on Hagia. Utterly convinced that she is Sabbat, Sanian has clearly lost her mind. Lord-General Lugo – whose career has been unstable since his disgrace at Hagia – plans to use her as propaganda, and does not care that she is an imposter; he believes that he will be forever remembered as the man responsible for a miracle in the Sabbat Worlds. As far as untold thousands of pilgrims, Imperial and archenemy troops are concerned, Sanian is the true Saint.

However, things take a strange turn when Sanian actually &quot;does&quot; become the host for the Saint&#x27;s spirit, after Sabbat&#x27;s true incarnation perishes in the assault. Innokenti deploys nine specialist assassins to the Civitas Beati under the cover of the invasion. Their purpose: kill the Saint and shatter the morale of the Imperials. With the Imperial fleet all but destroyed and surrounded by an enemy who has multiple advantages over them, the Ghosts face one of their most daunting challenges yet.

The title &quot;Sabbat Martyr&quot; is a reference to the psychic message experienced by a number of Ghosts in &quot;Honour Guard&quot;. Ultimately, it is one of the Ghost&#x27;s most beloved leaders who becomes a martyr in Sabbat&#x27;s name, as he gives his life defending her from the final assassin.

===&quot;Traitor General&quot;===
Lord-General Noches Sturm, the disgraced senior officer relieved of command during the siege on Vervunhive when caught attempting to desert, is captured by the forces of Chaos while en route to a military tribunal. His memories are bound by a mind-lock, preventing him from revealing vital information about the Crusade. As enemy psykers work hard to remove the mind-lock, the Imperial forces move quickly to stop Sturm jeopardising the entire Sabbat Worlds Crusade.

By request of Van Voytz and on his own free will, Colonel-Commissar Gaunt leads a hand-picked team of Ghosts to Gereon; a Chaos-held world where Sturm is undergoing an agonising ordeal to recover his memory. The insertion team is tasked with killing Sturm to prevent him from yielding critical intelligence that would endanger the Crusade war effort. The group links up with the loyalist resistance on Gereon to locate Sturm and evade the heretical forces pursuing them. With countless fanatical soldiers and foul warp-beings standing between the rescue team and their target, Gaunt and his men must not only fight for their lives, but also resist the corruption of Chaos that threatens to overwhelm them.

&quot;Traitor General&quot; introduces Eszrah ap Niht, a partisan of the Gereon . From this novel on, Eszrah becomes a major character within the series. It is also the first appearance of Mabbon Etogaur, a former commander in the Blood Pact who returns in the &quot;Victory&quot; arc.

===&quot;His Last Command&quot;===
After sixteen months of fighting as part of the Gereon Resistance, Colonel-Commissar Gaunt and his team escape the Chaos-held world and return to Imperial territory. Instead of praise and acknowledgement of their actions, the Ghosts are met with deep mistrust and abuse. Saved from execution in Camp Xeno on Ancreon Sextus by Junior Commissar Nahum Ludd, Gaunt and the Ghosts are briefly re-united with Lord-General Van Voytz before facing trial by the Commissariat. However, halfway through the hearings all charges are dropped and the Ghosts are prepared to return to active duty. Gaunt is shocked to learn that the Tanith First has been disbanded and merged with an under-strength regiment; the 81st Belladon. Furthermore, Gaunt is relieved of command status and once again a simple field commissar, but separated from his men.

The Ghosts are sent to join the 81st/1st Recon – the merged 81st Belladon and the Tanith First, led by Colonel Lucian Wilder. The regiment is taking part in the campaign to capture the ancient step-city Sparshad Mons, occupied by the Blood Pact and disturbingly warped nocturnal predators. The situation in the Mons is grim; desertion is high, morale is low, and most of the Imperial soldiers are inexperienced grunts. Gaunt is deployed to another section of the step-city and attached to a regiment from Fortis Binary, accompanied by Ludd and Eszrah Night. The situation deteriorates rapidly as the Blood Pact launch a counter-assault against the Imperial forces.

&quot;His Last Command&quot; introduces troopers from the 81st Belladon, several of whom become key characters in the series. The title refers to both Gaunt and Wilder. When informing Gaunt of his demotion, Van Voytz tells him that the Tanith was &quot;[his] last command&quot;. Wilder issues his last command to a platoon of Belladon soldiers participating in a suicidal rearguard for the rest of the regiment, of which Gaunt assumes leadership.

===&quot;The Armour of Contempt&quot;===
The Fifth Crusade Army, led by Lord-General Van Voytz, finally advances to reclaim Gereon from the forces of Chaos after over two thousand days of brutal occupation. The majority of the Crusade force is deployed to assault the coastline fortifications known as K&#x27;ethdrac&#x27;tt Shet Magir, an action which the newly inducted Dalin Criid participates in as part of an RIP (Retraining, Indoctrination and Punishment) detail. Half of the novel follows Dalin&#x27;s experiences in basic training and his struggle to survive in the chaos of the battlefield.

The recently re-instated Tanith First is excluded from this part of the invasion and is one of a number of scout/recon regiments inserted deep into the mainland behind enemy lines. As the Ghosts liberate a country town called Cantible, Gaunt is ordered by the Commissariat to make contact with the loyalist resistance in the Gereon , and leads a small team out into the wilderness to do so. However, it becomes apparent that certain individuals have their own agenda for re-taking Gereon.

The storyline of &quot;The Armour of Contempt&quot; shifts at regular intervals, between the perspectives of Dalin Criid and the rest of the Ghosts. The novel draws its name from a fictional book called &quot;The Spheres of Longing&quot; written by Inquisitor Gideon Ravenor, the main character of another series written by Dan Abnett.

===&quot;Only in Death&quot;===
On the fortress-world Jago, Lord-General Van Voytz addresses the Tanith First personally. He &#x27;asks&#x27; the Ghosts to secure an empty stronghold to the east of Elikon, the central Imperial bastion on the planet. It is clear from the start that Gaunt resents these orders. After six days of marching through Jago&#x27;s desert-like terrain and enduring dust-storms, the Ghosts reach their objective: Hinzerhaus, dubbed the &quot;house at the end of the world&quot;.

As they attempt to secure the fortress, the Ghosts make numerous discoveries. There is no water source on site, the maps that they have been given of Hinzerhaus are inconsistent and incorrect, and strange echoes fill the halls. Many of the men become convinced that the place is haunted. These findings only cause more issues when the Blood Pact attempt to storm Hinzerhaus, and the Ghosts are forced to mount a defence against a superior foe. At the same time, strange apparitions begin to eat away at the courage and morale of the men...

The title of the novel is part of an old Imperial proverb; &quot;only in death does duty end&quot;. The beginning of each chapter opens with an extract from Commissar Viktor Hark&#x27;s field journal, which is written in a font which resembles handwriting. This style changes slightly at points when Nahum Ludd scribes on Hark&#x27;s behalf. The novel re-introduces Agun Soric, who was absent from the previous books in the &#x27;Lost&#x27; arc.

===&quot;The Iron Star&quot;===
The Iron Star is a short story released as a chapbook. The story forms a coda to &quot;Only in Death&quot;. It recounts Gaunt&#x27;s own mentally internalised struggle to survive after being severely wounded in the events of the previous novel; moments of spiritual communion also establish portents for his future. Only 1200 copies were printed for the release date in September 2008, but it has since been included in the &quot;Sabbat Worlds&quot; anthology, a background book of short stories, edited by Dan Abnett.

===&quot;Blood Pact&quot;===
After the gruelling events on Jago, the Tanith First is removed from active service for the first time since its founding and sent to Balhaut to perform garrison duties. Two years on, however, the Ghosts are becoming restless from the lack of combat and purpose. A number of them go as far as turning to petty crime and other bad habits to amuse themselves. Ibram Gaunt himself becomes increasingly idle and distracted, but remains confident that the Tanith First will return to the front again soon.

Events turn as Gaunt is summoned to Balhaut&#x27;s Commissariat headquarters. A senior officer of the arch-enemy has been captured, and refuses to speak to anyone but Gaunt. The Inquisition is attempting to secure custody of the prisoner so that they may handle him their own way. The prisoner insists that he wishes to help the Imperium, but this claim is met with speculation by Gaunt. However, he is forced to protect the prisoner and go to ground in the city when a Blood Pact insertion team storms the facility in an attempt to silence the prisoner. With heretical witchcraft influencing the populace and a determined hunter pursuing them, who can Gaunt turn to for aid? And what information does the traitor general know that prompts the enemy to openly assault an Imperial stronghold?

The plot of &quot;Blood Pact&quot; somewhat mirrors that of &quot;Traitor General&quot;, with Etogaur Mabbon in place of Noches Sturm, but differs with the assassination squad holding the upper hand over their target&#x27;s captors. The novel also provides greater detail of Gaunt&#x27;s past tour on Balhaut during his service with the Hyrkan 8th, before the founding of the Tanith First-and-Only.

===&quot;Salvation&#x27;s Reach&quot;===
Following the events of &quot;Blood Pact&quot;, Colonel-Commissar Gaunt and his Ghosts are returned to active duty, and are given one of their most formidable assignments yet; a mysterious space hulk known as &quot;Salvation&#x27;s Reach&quot;. According to the turncoat Mabbon Etogaur, the Sons of Sek, a breakaway faction within the Blood Pact commanded by the warlord Anakwanar Sek, have secretly been using &quot;Salvation&#x27;s Reach&quot; as an R&amp;D installation; concealing their activities there from all factions, even their overlord, Archon Gaur.

If Sek&#x27;s covert operations are brought to light, it will shatter the uneasy alliance between Sek and Gaur, sparking an internal feud that will tip the balance of the Sabbat Worlds Crusade in the favour of the Imperium. The Tanith First – reinforced with additional troops drawn from Verghast and Belladon – and a trio of veteran Space Marines are sent to neutralise the facility at &quot;Salvation&#x27;s Reach&quot; and gather as much intelligence as possible before they destroy it. However, Gaunt must also see to the protection of the incarcerated Mabbon, deal with the malcontents within the Tanith First, and cope with personal issues that he never anticipated.

A sub-plot in &quot;Salvation&#x27;s Reach&quot; follows Doc Dorden&#x27;s battle against terminal cancer, and his determination to serve the Tanith First until the very end. Another sub-plot explores the relationship between Captain Ban Daur and his new partner, Elodie. Through the latter, readers are granted an insight into the lives of the wives and other civilians that follow Imperial Guard regiments around the galaxy. The novel also features the appearance of Brother Kater Holofurnace of the Iron Snakes, a Chapter of Space Marines that previously appeared in Abnett&#x27;s novel, &quot;Brotherhood of the Snake&quot;.

===&quot;The Warmaster&quot;===
After the success of their desperate mission to Salvation&#x27;s Reach, Colonel-Commisar Gaunt and the Tanith First race to the strategically vital forge world of Urdesh, besieged by the brutal armies of Anarch Sek. However, there may be more at stake than just a planet. The Imperial forces have made an attempt to divide and conquer their enemy, but with Warmaster Macaroth himself commanding the Urdesh campaign, it is possible that the Archenemy assault has a different purpose… to decapitate the Imperial command structure with a single blow. Has the Warmaster allowed himself to become an unwitting target? And can Gaunt&#x27;s Ghosts possibly defend him against the assembled killers and war machines of Chaos?

===&quot;Anarch&quot;===
On the forge world of Urdesh, the massed forces of the Imperial Crusade engage in a final bloody battle with the Archenemy commander known as the Anarch, and his elite warriors - the barbaric Sons of Sek. A victory for either side will decide more than just the fate of Urdesh... it will determine the outcome of the entire Sabbat Worlds Crusade. Ibram Gaunt – now serving at the right hand of Warmaster Macaroth – finds himself at the very heart of the struggle. His regiment, the Tanith First &quot;Ghosts&quot;, holds the vital key to ultimate success. But as the forces of the Imperium and Chaos square up for the final, large-scale confrontation, Gaunt discovers that the greatest threat of all may come from inside rather than out.

==Anthologies and short stories==

<text>Alsou Ralifovna Abramova (; ; ; born 27 June 1983), better known by the mononym Alsou, is a Russian singer. She represented Russia in the Eurovision Song Contest 2000 in which she came second with the song &quot;Solo&quot; right after Denmark, giving her recognition across Europe. Alsou hosted the final of the Eurovision Song Contest 2009 held in Moscow. Merited Artists of the Russian Federation (2018).

==Biography==
===Early life===
Alsou was born in Bugulma, Tatar ASSR, Russian SFSR, Soviet Union. Her father, Ralif Rafilovich Safin, who is of Bashkir descent, is a former LUKoil executive and a current member of the Federal Council, the upper chamber of the Russian parliament. He is also the owner of the FC Zhemchuzhina-Sochi football team and was named the 100th richest citizen of Russia by &quot;Forbes&quot; magazine in 2004. Alsou&#x27;s mother, Raziya Iskhakovna, is an architect of Volga Tatar descent. Alsou is a Muslim. She has an older half-brother called Ruslan (1973), an older brother called Marat (1977, not to be confused with tennis player Marat Safin), and a younger brother called Renard (1996).

When Alsou was one year old, her family moved from Bugulma to Siberia. At age five, Alsou asked her parents for a piano. She was then allowed to attend a private music school. After living in Moscow due to her father&#x27;s business, she then moved to Syosset, New York, and later to the UK where she entered a private architecture college. While living in London, Alsou visited Russia often.

In 1998, at the wedding of her brother Marat which was celebrated on the bank of the Moskva River, Alsou sat at the grand piano and sang I Will Always Love You. After this private performance, her family began to persuade her to pursue a professional singing career.

===Later life===
On 18 March 2006 Alsou married Yan Abramov, an Azerbaijani-born Jewish businessman. The wedding reception took place at Rossiya Hotel.

On 7 September 2006, Alsou gave birth to her first daughter Safina at the Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles, California. In 2007 Alsou joined the United Russia party. On 29 April 2008, Alsou gave birth to her second daughter Mikella at Tel Aviv Sourasky Medical Center. On 10 August 2016, Alsou gave birth to her son, Rafael, at the Ihilov hospital in Tel-Aviv.
On 24 May 2024 Alsou filed for divorce. In August 2024 the divorce was finalized.

==Career==
===Beginning===
At the age of 15 Alsou was introduced to music manager Valeriy Belotserkovskiy. She again performed &quot;I Will Always Love You&quot; and impressed the manager. He began work with Alsou the next day. Her debut Russian album was the self-titled &quot;Alsou&quot; (Russian: &quot;Алсу́&quot;) was released on 16 September 1999. It was very successful in Russia and spawned 3 singles: &quot;Zimniy Son&quot; (&quot;Winter Dream&quot;) &quot;Vesna&quot; (&quot;Spring&quot;), and &quot;Inogda&quot; (&quot;Sometimes&quot;). After the huge success of Alsou&#x27;s debut Russian album she was signed to Universal Music Russia and became its first domestic artist. By 2000 more than 700.000 legal copies of CD &quot;Alsou&quot; were sold in Russia.

In 2000, Alsou recorded her first English language single &quot;Solo&quot; and was entered into the Eurovision Song Contest 2000, written by Andrew Lane and Brandon Barnes eventually finishing second overall. &quot;Solo&quot; went on to sell 100,000 copies and became the biggest-selling single of all time in Russia, surpassed only by her next single, a duet with Enrique Iglesias entitled &quot;You&#x27;re My #1&quot;. &quot;` I really enjoyed performing with him in Kremlin and I hope our paths will cross again`.&quot;

After her success in Eurovision 2000, Alsou began a large-scale tour of Russia. She celebrated her 17th birthday by performing in her native town of Bugulma, where 86,000 of the 120,000 population gathered in the main square to see her.

Alsou performed &quot;Solo&quot; again at &quot;Congratulations&quot;, the 50th anniversary Eurovision concert in Copenhagen, Denmark, in October 2005.

===English career===
During 2000–2001, Alsou began working on her debut English album also called &quot;Alsou&quot;, which was released in Russia on 28 June 2001. It was also released in (Germany), Norway, Poland, the Czech Republic and Malaysia.

The lead single &quot;Before You Love Me&quot; was released in the UK on 30 April 2001, soon after charting at No. 1 on MTV Select and several TV appearances by Alsou. However, it only managed to chart at No. 27 in the UK Singles Chart. Later that year it was released in Germany and Australia.

A follow-up single, &quot;He Loves Me&quot;, was released only in (Germany) on 15 October 2001, with limited success.

The album was canceled in the UK, though released from 2001–2002 in several European countries and Malaysia.

===Between number albums===
Alsou&#x27;s debut Russian album was re-released twice – in 2001 and 2002, spawning two singles – &quot;Osen&quot; (&quot;Autumn&quot;) and &quot;Kogda Lubov Ko Mne Pridiot&quot; (&quot;When Love Comes To Me&quot;).

In the summer of 2002, Alsou began a tour of the former Soviet countries. Her new video for an upcoming single &quot;Letyashaya Nad Oblakami&quot; (&quot;Flying Over The Clouds&quot;) was shown in Russian cinemas before the Russian romantic movie &quot;Atlantida&quot;. Alsou had recorded two songs for the movie.

===&quot;Trilogy&quot; and &quot;19&quot;===
In August 2002 more studio sessions began for a second Russian long-play. Alsou was also preparing for her concerts in Moscow at the same time. The &quot;Trilogy&quot; project was deemed by the local papers as one of the most &quot;important social and cultural events&quot;. The uniqueness of the &quot;Trilogy&quot; idea was that no one singer in the world had ever given three completely different performances during only 10 days.

The first show was held in the &quot;Rossiya&quot; concert hall, where Alsou performed her old set entitled &quot;Alsou And Her Authors&quot;, which had never been presented in Moscow before. The second show was an exclusive orchestral concert in Tchaikovsky Hall, where there were only 1,500 seats. The third show was a Europop show entitled &quot;Solo&quot;. It was held in the Olympic Sports Complex and contained new Russian and English songs, with a fantasy-oriented set. After the third show, Alsou shot a video for the song &quot;Vchera&quot; (&quot;Yesterday&quot;).

On 23 January 2003, Alsou released her new Russian album entitled &quot;19&quot;. The CD was received well by critics, and by April 2003 the sales had reached 500.000 copies. &quot;19&quot; spawned such singles as &quot;Vsyo Ravno&quot; (&quot;Anyway&quot;), &quot;Vchera&quot; (&quot;Yesterday&quot;), &quot;Perviy Raz&quot; (&quot;The First Time&quot;), &quot;Mechty&quot; (&quot;Dreams&quot;) feat. Karl Frierson (mixed by Pit Baumgartner from De Phazz), &quot;Letyashchaya Nad Oblakami&quot; (&quot;Flying Over the Clouds&quot;), and &quot;Etkey&quot; (&quot;Father&quot;, a Tatarstan single).

After the success of &quot;19&quot;, she was nominated for the First National Music Award, &quot;Muz-TV&quot;. On 5 June 2003, after arriving in Moscow from working in foreign studios, Alsou unexpectedly found herself the winner of the &quot;Best Female Artist&quot; nomination. The voting was held all over Russia, and Alsou could not stop the tears of joy. To support the sales of album &quot;19&quot;, Alsou gave successful performances in Russia, Ukraine, Georgia, Azerbaijan, Latvia, Israel and Kazakhstan.

===Second English album===
For almost four years, Alsou worked on her second English album &#x27;Inspired&#x27;. It was recorded in London and Los Angeles. The lead single, &quot;Always on My Mind&quot;, was written by Alsou and Morten Schjolin. The video was filmed in May 2004 by a well-known director Joseph Kahn. At the beginning of 2005, the single premiered on Capital FM and became the best news single of the week. However, despite the heavy UK promotion, a sexy video, touring as a support act with boyband Westlife, and performing in the London club G-A-Y, the commercial single was canceled by Alsou&#x27;s UK label Mercury Records, though physical copies were available for a short time. &#x27;Inspired&#x27; remains unreleased.

Alsou is credited on most of the tracks recorded for &quot;Inspired&quot;. The album was produced by several of the industry&#x27;s best producers including Rhett Lawrence and Bass Bros. &quot;Inspired&quot; features a cover version of Lionel Richie&#x27;s &quot;Hello&quot;. Another well-circulated track is the Nelly-featured &quot;Wish I Didn&#x27;t Know&quot;, though only a rough demo has leaked. The album is more guitar-flavored than Alsou&#x27;s previous works. Originally it was intended to record the album with mostly ballads, but then the album&#x27;s direction changed.

At a meeting of the official Russian Alsou Fan Club in Moscow on 9 June 2013 the album &#x27;Inspired&#x27; was given to the fan club members for free. The CDs were self-made by Alsou. It was the first time that the entire album came into the world.

In 2006, Alsou recorded a wedding song, &quot;Miracles&quot;, written by Alsou and her then-future husband Yan Abramov. It was released as a limited single for the guests of the wedding. The song is not part of the album &#x27;Inspired&#x27;.

===&quot;The Main Thing&quot; and &quot;Tugan Tel&quot;===
Alsou&#x27;s third Russian album &quot;Samoe Glavnoe&quot; (&quot;The Main Thing&quot;), her first LP in five years, was released on 31 March 2008 by Universal Music Russia. The singles from this album are &quot;Nebo&quot; (&quot;Sky&quot;, released back in 2005), &quot;Samoe Glavnoe&quot; (&quot;The Main Thing&quot;, 2006, the video was shot when she was pregnant though it is not visible), &quot;A u moei ljubvi&quot; (&quot;And My Love Has...&quot;, 2007, shot in California desert and directed by Alan Calzatti).
During 2008 Alsou recorded an album in Tatar language as well. Released in the fall and named &quot;Туган тел&quot; (Tugan Tel&#x27; | Mother&#x27;s Tongue), the album includes several Tatar peoples&#x27; songs, others written specially for Alsou, some Tatar music instruments, and a choir. All proceeds were given by Alsou and &quot;Universal Music&quot; for sponsorship of talented orphans from Tatarstan.

===Non-musical work===
In June 2004, Alsou performed in the British mystical thriller &quot;Spirit Trap&quot; with Billie Piper, Luke Mably, Emma Catherwood and Sam Troughton. The film premiered in August 2005. Alsou&#x27;s self-written ballad &quot;Teardrops&quot; plays over the credits. The film got poor reviews and small returns at the box office, and it was soon released on DVD. A release of her second motion picture is awaited in 2008 – earlier in 2006 she starred in the Russian historical drama &quot;Vivat, Anna!&quot; from a cycle of films about the Russian monarchy. She also recorded a song for the movie, a melody from which serves as 1st track (Intro) of &quot;Samoe Glavnoe&quot;.

===Plans===
Alsou is currently selecting a single for her next Russian album of original songs she is working on. Currently, she is also recording a double Russian album of lullabies and popular children&#x27;s songs. At the beginning of 2010, she started recording a jazz album with the help of George Benson. She has presented the final of the 2009 Eurovision Song Contest in Moscow. The hosts are normally required to translate monologue into French, which she demonstrated quite fluently for the event. Six years later, she became one of the five jurors for Russian jury panel in the Eurovision Song Contest 2015.

== Legal issues ==

Alsou&#x27;s second daughter Mikella participated in The Voice Kids (Russian season 6) of vocal competition show The Voice Kids (Russian TV series) produced by Channel One Russia, and was announced a winner of the superfinal, which was aired on April 26, 2019, as she received 56.5% of the votes. It caused a huge outrage by social media users as they suspected Mikella&#x27;s victory was a result of vote manipulation by Alsou and her husband. The outrage prompted Channel One Russia to review the voting results and, after the fraud was proven, Mikella&#x27;s victory was canceled.

<doc id="772803" wikidata="Q1170739" url="?curid=772803" title="Ernest George Jansen">
<text>Ernest George Jansen (7 August 1881 – 25 November 1959) was the penultimate Governor-General of the Union of South Africa, holding office from 1951 until his death in 1959.

==Early life and education==
Born on 7 August 1881, he was educated at the Durban High School and then graduated with a law degree from the University of the Cape of Good Hope in 1905, and was admitted as an advocate (the South African equivalent of a barrister) in 1913.

==Political career==
An ardent champion of Afrikaner interests, he joined the National Party in 1915 and was a member of Parliament from 1915 to 1920, from 1921 to 1943, and from 1947 to 1950.

In 1919, he was a member of a delegation which tried unsuccessfully to persuade American president Woodrow Wilson to call for independence to be restored to the former Boer republics of the Orange Free State and the Transvaal.

In Parliament, Jansen was Speaker of the House of Assembly of South Africa from 1924 to 1929, Minister of Native Affairs and of Irrigation from 1929 to 1934, and Speaker again from 1934 to 1943. He was highly regarded for his firm and impartial speakership.

He was Minister of Native Affairs again from 1948 to 1950, but was thought to be too soft on the new policy of apartheid, for which his department was primarily responsible. He was subsequently replaced by hardliner Hendrik Verwoerd and formally promoted by Prime Minister Daniel Malan to the politically neutral post of Governor-General once vacant. As an Afrikaner nationalist and stout republican, Jansen declined to wear the ceremonial uniform, or to take the oath of allegiance to the monarch whom he represented. He held office until his death in 1959, when he was succeeded by Minister of Justice Charles Robberts Swart.

==Personal life and legacy==
Jansen married Martha Mabel Pellissier in 1912. Both were prominent figures in Afrikaner cultural circles. Jansen was a founder member of the South African Academy for Science and Art (&quot;Suid-Afrikaanse Akademie vir Wetenskap en Kuns&quot; - SAAWEK) in 1909, of the Co-operation Union (&quot;Saamwerk-Unie&quot;) in 1917, of the Federation of Afrikaner Cultural Associations (&quot;Federasie van Afrikaanse Kultuurvereniginge&quot; - FAK) in 1929, and of the Voortrekkers (the Afrikaner equivalent of the Boy Scouts and Girl Guides) in 1930, and was master of ceremonies at the laying of the foundation stone of the Voortrekker Monument in 1938 and at its dedication in 1949.

Hoërskool Dr. E.G. Jansen (High School), in Boksburg, is named after him.

<doc id="772804" wikidata="Q2522363" url="?curid=772804" title="Victor Gollancz Ltd">
<text>Victor Gollancz Ltd () was a major British book publishing house of the twentieth century and continues to publish science fiction and fantasy titles as an imprint of Orion Publishing Group. 

Gollancz was founded in 1927 by Victor Gollancz, and specialised in the publication of high-quality literature, nonfiction, and popular fiction, including crime, detective, mystery, thriller, and science fiction. Upon Gollancz&#x27;s death in 1967, ownership passed to his daughter, Livia, who in 1989 sold it to Houghton Mifflin. Three years later in October 1992, Houghton Mifflin sold Gollancz to the publishing house Cassell &amp; Co. Cassell and its parent company Orion Publishing Group were acquired by Hachette in 1996, and in December 1998 the merged Orion/Cassell group turned Gollancz into its science fiction/fantasy imprint.

==Origins as a political house==

Gollancz was left-inclined in politics and a supporter of socialist movements. This is reflected in some of the call for the books he published. Victor Gollancz commissioned George Orwell to write about the urban working class in the North of England; the result was &quot;The Road to Wigan Pier&quot;. His break with Orwell came when he declined to publish Orwell&#x27;s account of the Spanish Civil War, &quot;Homage to Catalonia&quot;, the pair having drifted apart on political grounds. He did publish &quot;The Red Army Moves&quot; by Geoffrey Cox on the Winter War, which was critical of the Soviet attack on Finland, but also foresaw that the Red Army would defeat the Germans. He also published works by German exiles, such as Hilde Meisel.

Gollancz was the original publisher of a number of authors and their books including:
*George Orwell with &quot;Down and Out in Paris and London&quot; in 1933
*Alfred Ayer with &quot;Language, Truth and Logic&quot; in 1936
*A. J. Cronin with &quot;The Citadel&quot; in 1937
*Daphne du Maurier with &quot;Rebecca&quot; in 1938
*Kingsley Amis with &quot;Lucky Jim&quot; in 1953
*Colin Wilson with &quot;The Outsider&quot; in 1956
*John le Carré with &quot;Call for the Dead&quot; in 1961
*E. P. Thompson with &quot;The Making of the English Working Class&quot; in 1963
*Anthony Price with &quot;The Labyrinth Makers&quot; in 1971.

Many of Gollancz&#x27;s books were published in one of their familiar house dust jackets, of which the most famous was bright yellow, with the title and author rendered in a vibrant, bold typography.

The Left Book Club, the first book club in the UK, was a publishing group pioneered by Gollancz that exerted a strong left-wing influence in Great Britain from 1936 to 1948. It offered a monthly book choice, for sale to members only, as well as a newsletter that acquired the status of a major political magazine. It also held an annual rally. Membership peaked at 57,000 but it eventually ceased publishing in 1948. The books and pamphlets were published with their distinctive covers — orange for paperback (1936–1938) and red for hardback (1938–1948) editions.

==Transition to science fiction and fantasy genres==
From the early 1960s through the late 1990s, Gollancz Science Fiction was the pre-eminent hardcover science fiction publishing list in the UK, for the first quarter century being both recognisable by, and famous for, its distinctive &quot;Gollancz Yellow&quot; dust-jackets with black and magenta typography, providing a major part of the publisher&#x27;s output, alongside Gollancz&#x27; crime fiction and general fiction lists. Full-colour dust-jackets were introduced on the science fiction list from the mid-1980s adding significantly to production costs, but also to commercial sales - an important consideration with increasing pressure upon the UK&#x27;s public library system&#x27;s budgets.
In 1998, Gollancz was diminished into just the science fiction and fantasy imprint Gollancz Science Fiction after it was acquired by Orion Publishing Group. Gollancz has also proceeded to publish the SF Masterworks series, and the Fantasy Masterworks series previously appearing under the Orion sister-imprint Millennium. Gollancz has published award-winning and award-nominated books by, among others:

==Expansion into manga==
In 2005, Gollancz set up a manga publishing arm, Gollancz Manga, which published UK editions of various Viz Media properties. As of 2014, Gollancz no longer publish manga and Viz Media have re-released the publisher&#x27;s series.

The following titles have been published:
==&quot;SF Gateway&quot; website==
In 2011, Gollancz launched the SF Gateway website, an online library that features out-of-print science fiction books republished as e-books. Gollancz aims to make 5,000 or more books available by 2014 and the website will be integrated with the online &quot;Encyclopedia of Science Fiction&quot;.

==Accolades==
In terms of the number of published works that have been nominated for major awards, Gollancz ranks as one of the field&#x27;s top publishers of science fiction, fantasy and horror fiction.

<doc id="772810" wikidata="Q506859" url="?curid=772810" title="Mack David">
<text>Mack David (July 5, 1912 – December 30, 1993) was an American lyricist and songwriter, best known for his work in film and television, with a career spanning the period between the early 1940s and the early 1970s. David was credited with writing lyrics or music or both for over one thousand songs. He was particularly well known for his work on the Disney films &quot;Cinderella&quot; and &quot;Alice in Wonderland&quot;, and for the mostly-English lyrics through which Édith Piaf&#x27;s signature song &quot;La Vie en rose&quot; gained much of its familiarity among native speakers of English.

David was the elder brother of American lyricist and songwriter Hal David.

==Life and career==
David was born on July 5, 1912, in New York City to a Jewish family. David originally planned to become an attorney and attended Cornell University and St. John&#x27;s University Law School. Despite these original goals, in the mid-1940s, David began writing songs for New York&#x27;s Tin Pan Alley. These initial successes prompted David to move to Hollywood, California, to work in the film and television industries.

He enjoyed considerable success, including eight Academy Award nominations—for &quot;Bibbidi-Bobbidi-Boo&quot;, which he, Al Hoffman and Jerry Livingston wrote for Walt Disney&#x27;s &quot;Cinderella&quot; (1950), followed by the title songs from &quot;The Hanging Tree&quot; (1959), &quot;Bachelor in Paradise&quot; (1961), &quot;Walk on the Wild Side&quot; (1962), &quot;It&#x27;s a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World&quot; (1963), &quot;Hush...Hush, Sweet Charlotte&quot; (1964), &quot;The Ballad of Cat Ballou&quot; from &quot;Cat Ballou&quot; (1965) and &quot;My Wishing Doll&quot; from &quot;Hawaii&quot; (1966). David was inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame in 1975. David&#x27;s &quot;most remunerative&quot; song, &quot;Sunflower&quot;, was published in 1948, and Frank Sinatra turned it into a hit. Jerry Herman&#x27;s hit theme song for &quot;Hello, Dolly!&quot; composed over a decade later, used four bars of David&#x27;s &quot;Sunflower&quot;. When David sued Herman for copyright infringement, Herman settled out of court with David (for a reputed $250,000), claiming he had never heard David&#x27;s &quot;Sunflower&quot; prior to working on &quot;Hello, Dolly!&quot;

* Theme song to &quot;Casper the Friendly Ghost&quot; (1950 with Jerry Livingston)

David collaborated with many composers, including Raymond Scott, Al Hoffman, Alex Kramer, Count Basie, Burt Bacharach, Henry Mancini, and Jerry Livingston, on numerous songs for stage and screen, including &quot;Casper the Friendly Ghost&quot;, &quot;77 Sunset Strip&quot;, &quot;Hawaiian Eye&quot;, &quot;Bourbon Street Beat&quot;, &quot;Surfside 6&quot; and &quot;This Is It&quot; (for the 1960s &quot;The Bugs Bunny Show&quot;).

Perhaps David&#x27;s most popular lyrics were written for &quot;La Vie en rose&quot;, a French song with lyrics by Édith Piaf and music by Louiguy (Louis Guglielmi), which was Piaf&#x27;s signature song. Although David did not write an English translation of Piaf&#x27;s lyrics, his words captured the spirit of the song; his version was performed by artists such as Louis Armstrong. The song was recorded by over eighty international singers and musicians and been featured in several dozen motion pictures.

David&#x27;s song &quot;Candy&quot; (co-written with Whitney and Kramer) was recorded by Ella Fitzgerald for her 1968 album &quot;30 by Ella&quot;.

* &quot;Swing!&quot; (1999) – revue – featured songwriter for &quot;Candy&quot;

==Inventor==
David had a varied interest in musical composition. In 1975, according to the &quot;New York Times&quot; in David&#x27;s obituary: &quot;Mr. David was granted a patent for inventing an electronic system for composing songs from fractional recordings. The system, which included playback units, stored records of lyrics and melodies. The operator selected words and music that fit together and recorded the combination.&quot;

<text>Dead Again is a 1991 neo-noir romantic thriller film directed by Kenneth Branagh and written by Scott Frank. It stars Branagh and Emma Thompson, with Andy García, Derek Jacobi, Hanna Schygulla, Wayne Knight, and Robin Williams appearing in supporting roles.

&quot;Dead Again&quot; was a moderate box-office success, and received positive reviews from the majority of critics. Jacobi was nominated for a BAFTA Award for Best Actor in a Supporting Role, and Patrick Doyle, who composed the film&#x27;s music, was nominated for a Golden Globe for Best Original Score.

==Plot==

Newspapers detail the 1948 murder of Margaret Strauss, who was stabbed during a robbery; her anklet is missing. Her husband, composer Roman Strauss, is found guilty of the crime and condemned to death. Before his execution, Roman is visited by reporter Gray Baker. Asked if he killed Margaret, Roman appears to whisper something in Baker&#x27;s ear. Baker does not disclose Roman&#x27;s answer.

Forty-three years later, private detective Mike Church investigates the identity of a woman who has appeared at the orphanage where he grew up. She has amnesia, cannot speak, and has nightmares. Mike takes her in and asks his friend, Pete Dugan, to publish her picture and his contact info. Antiques dealer and hypnotist Franklyn Madson approaches Mike, suggesting that hypnosis may help her to recover her memory.

When the session is unsuccessful, Madson suggests that they experiment with past life regression. Mike is skeptical, but the woman details Margaret and Roman&#x27;s lives in the third person. When the session ends, she can speak but still has amnesia. Mike and the woman bear a striking resemblance to Roman and Margaret. 

Mike nicknames the woman &quot;Grace&quot; and falls in love with her. A man named Doug appears and claims that she is his fiancée, Katherine, but Mike discovers that he is lying and chases him off. Hypnotized, Grace remembers that Roman suffered from writer&#x27;s block and was broke, despite his earlier wealth. He believes that Margaret is flirting with Baker. Margaret cannot convince him that she is faithful and catches Frankie, the son of their housekeeper, Inga, looking through her jewelry box. She asks Roman to dismiss Inga, but Roman refuses, saying that Inga saved his life in Nazi Germany.

Grace sees Mike standing over Margaret with scissors and is convinced he intends to kill her. Mike insists that he would never hurt her, but when he accidentally calls her &quot;Margaret&quot;, he agrees to let Madson regress him. During his regression, he realizes that he was actually Margaret (and that Grace was actually Roman), but is unable to tell Madson or Grace.

Pete Dugan tells Mike that he has identified Grace as artist Amanda Sharp. It is discovered that she lost her memory due to getting mugged. Amanda (Grace), still afraid of Mike, accompanies Dugan and Madson to her apartment; her artwork focuses on scissors. Madson gives her a gun to protect her from Mike. Mike visits Gray Baker in a nursing home and asks him about Roman&#x27;s secret. Baker insists that Roman said nothing to him but rather leaned over and kissed him. Baker is convinced that Roman did not kill his wife and urges Mike to find Inga, who might know what truly happened. Baker tells Mike that Inga and Frankie started an antiques shop, and Mike realizes that Franklyn Madson is actually Frankie.

Mike breaks into Madson&#x27;s shop, where he finds and questions Inga. She reveals that in 1948, she declared her love to Roman, but he rebuffed her. Frankie blamed Margaret for his mother&#x27;s unhappiness, killed her with scissors, and stole her anklet. Roman was found covered in his wife&#x27;s blood and holding the murder weapon.

After Roman&#x27;s execution, Inga took Frankie to London, where he learned about hypnotherapy and past-life regression. After returning to Los Angeles, Frankie was convinced that Margaret&#x27;s spirit would seek revenge. Seeing Amanda&#x27;s photo in the newspaper, he knew that she had returned. He hired Doug, an actor, to separate Mike and Amanda, and distract Amanda while he waited to kill her. Inga apologizes for her role in Margaret&#x27;s death and gives Mike the anklet. After Mike leaves to find Amanda, Frankie (Madson) smothers Inga with a pillow.

Mike tries to tell Amanda the truth. Terrified, she shoots him. Madson arrives and reveals that he is Frankie. He puts the scissors that he used to kill Margaret in Mike&#x27;s hand and tries to make it look like Amanda killed him, dying by suicide. Mike revives and stabs Madson in the leg with the scissors. Dugan arrives, misconstrues the scene, and tackles Mike. As Madson reaches for the pistol, Amanda stabs him in the back with the scissors. In a rage, Madson charges Mike, but Mike positions Amanda&#x27;s scissor sculpture so that Madson impales himself.

A closing montage shows Mike and Amanda embracing, superimposed over Margaret and Roman in happier times.

==Production==

&quot;Dead Again&quot; is an international co-production between the United States and the United Kingdom. According to the director&#x27;s commentary on the DVD, the movie was filmed entirely in color. After test screenings, it was decided to use black-and-white for the &quot;past&quot; sequences to help clear audience confusion. The final frame, when the mystery is solved, blooms from black-and-white to color.

==Release==
&quot;Dead Again&quot; was released August 23, 1991, in the United States, and October 25, 1991, in the United Kingdom. It was entered into the 42nd Berlin International Film Festival in February 1992.

===Home media===
The film was released on DVD June 27, 2000, through Paramount Home Entertainment. The DVD special features include two audio commentaries and a theatrical trailer.

It was released for the first time on Blu-ray October 5, 2021, on the film&#x27;s 30th anniversary.

==Reception==

===Critical response===
&quot;Dead Again&quot; was well received by most critics. On Rotten Tomatoes, it has an approval rating of 81%, based on reviews from 52 critics. The consensus reads: &quot;Even if the somewhat convoluted plot falls apart upon close inspection, &quot;Dead Again&quot; proves Kenneth Branagh has a solid knack for enjoyable pulp.&quot; On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 66 out of 100, based on reviews from 19 critics. Audiences surveyed by CinemaScore gave the film a grade of &quot;A-&quot; on scale of A+ to F.

&quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; film critic, Roger Ebert, gave the film a glowing four-star review, drawing comparisons to the works of Orson Welles and Alfred Hitchcock, stating, &quot;&quot;Dead Again&quot; is Kenneth Branagh once again demonstrating that he has a natural flair for bold theatrical gesture. If &quot;Henry V&quot;, the first film he directed and starred in, caused people to compare him to Olivier, &quot;Dead Again&quot; will inspire comparisons to Welles and Hitchcock - and the Olivier of Hitchcock&#x27;s &quot;Rebecca&quot;. I do not suggest Branagh is already as great a director as Welles and Hitchcock, although he has a good start in that direction. What I mean is that his spirit, his daring, is in the same league. He is not interested in making timid movies.&quot;

James Berardinelli also gave the film a four-star review, praising Branagh&#x27;s direction and all levels of the production, from the screenplay by Scott Frank to Patrick Doyle&#x27;s score, stating, &quot;...Branagh has combined all of these cinematic elements into an achievement that rivals Hitchcock&#x27;s best work and stands out as one of the most intriguing and memorable thrillers of the 1990s.&quot;

Peter Travers of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; viewed the film negatively, praising some elements of Branagh&#x27;s direction, while criticizing the romance, saying, &quot;In his efforts to crowd the screen with character and incident, Branagh cheats on the one element that might have given resonance to the mystery: the love story. Branagh and Thompson (married in real life) are sublime actors, but they never develop a convincing ardor as either couple. How could they when the director is so busy playing tricks? &quot;Dead Again&quot; isn&#x27;t a disaster, merely a miscalculation from a prodigious talent who has forgotten that you squeeze the life out of romance when you don&#x27;t give it space to breathe.&quot;

Vincent Canby of &quot;The New York Times&quot; gave the film a lukewarm review, calling it &quot;a big, convoluted, entertainingly dizzy romantic mystery melodrama&quot;, and concluding, &quot;&quot;Dead Again&quot; is eventually a lot simpler than it pretends to be. The explanation of the mystery is a rather commonplace letdown, but probably nothing short of mass murder could successfully top the baroque buildup. In this way, too, the film is faithful to its antecedents, while still being a lot of fun.&quot;

In 2016, Jason Bailey at &quot;Flavorwire&quot; repeated Roger Ebert&#x27;s initial directorial comparisons, writing that, &quot;&quot;Dead Again&quot; is one of the most Hitchcockian thrillers this side of De Palma, with easily traceable influences of Olivier-fronted &quot;Rebecca&quot; (in the creepy, needy housekeeper), &quot;Psycho&quot; (the mysterious old mother in the next room), &quot;Dial M for Murder&quot; (the scissors as murder weapon), and &quot;Spellbound&quot; (the therapeutic elements, plus a quickie reference to Salvador Dalí, who advised on that film’s dream sequences).&quot;

===Box office===
&quot;Dead Again&quot; grossed $3,479,395 during its opening weekend, playing on 450 screens. It grossed more than $38 million by the end of its theatrical run.

===Accolades===
== Media ==
&quot;Dead Again&quot; was one of several influences on the 1999 conceptual album, &quot;Metropolis pt. 2: Scenes From a Memory&quot;, by the American progressive metal band, Dream Theater.

It was unofficially remade into a 1998 Malayalam movie, &quot;Mayilpeelikkavu&quot;, and in 2008, as &quot;Sila Nerangalil.&quot;

<text>Adam Wade Gontier (born May 25, 1978) is a Canadian rock musician. He is the lead singer, rhythm guitarist and main songwriter for Saint Asonia, but is best known as the co-lead singer, rhythm guitarist, and founding member of the rock band Three Days Grace. He co-founded the band in 1992, recording four albums with them before parting ways in 2013 (not counting two guest appearances on stage with the band in 2023) and eventually returning in 2024. In addition to his work with Three Days Grace and Saint Asonia, he has been involved in collaborations with other bands including Art of Dying, Apocalyptica, Breaking Benjamin, Skillet and Thousand Foot Krutch.

== Early life ==

Gontier was born in Peterborough, Ontario on May 25, 1978. He was raised in Markham, Ontario. Shortly after his parents divorced, he moved back to the Peterborough area, where he initially attended Adam Scott Collegiate and Vocational Institute. In 1992, he moved to the Norwood area, and attended Norwood District High School, where he met and befriended Three Days Grace members Neil Sanderson and Brad Walst. Gontier&#x27;s mother is a professional singer/pianist, and was an influence to him as a musician.

Gontier started playing guitar at the age of 12 and was taught by his cousin&#x27;s brother Josh. He began writing songs around the age of 14. Gontier has stated that he uses music &quot;as an outlet and release for emotions and feelings.&quot; Gontier&#x27;s influences include Pearl Jam, Alice in Chains, Jeff Buckley, Soundgarden, the Tragically Hip, and Finger Eleven.

== Career ==
===1992–2013, 2024–present: Three Days Grace===

Gontier, along with Sanderson, Walst, Phil Crowe, and Joe Grant, started out as &quot;Groundswell&quot; in Norwood, Ontario, in 1992, while attending high school. In 1997, Gontier, Sanderson, and Walst regrouped as &quot;Three Days Grace&quot;. The group was signed to Jive Records after being sought out by the company&#x27;s then-president Barry Weiss. Their Canadian rock number one debut single, &quot;I Hate Everything About You&quot;, and their debut self-titled studio album was released in 2003. Their second studio album, &quot;One-X&quot;, was released in 2006, debuting at number five on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. Their third studio album, &quot;Life Starts Now&quot;, was released in 2009 and debuted at number three on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, thus becoming the band&#x27;s highest-charting album in the US to date. In 2012, the band released their fourth studio album, &quot;Transit of Venus&quot; and peaked at number five on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. 

On January 9, 2013, Gontier resigned from Three Days Grace. He left as the band was about to embark on a co-headlining tour. Matt Walst from My Darkest Days, the brother of bassist Brad Walst, became the new lead singer. On April 19, 2023, Gontier reunited with Three Days Grace to perform &quot;Never Too Late&quot; and &quot;Riot&quot;. Gontier reunited with the band a second time for their Nashville, Tennessee concert on October 10, 2023.

On October 3, 2024, Three Days Grace confirmed Gontier’s official return (with Walst also remaining as a singer) and was in the studio recording new music with the band.

===2012–2014: Solo career===
Gontier joined singer and songwriter Martin Sexton on the road during his 2012 &quot;Fall Like Rain&quot; tour, providing opening support as a solo artist. He also joined Citizen Cope for a few shows as a solo act. Gontier continued to do shows and concerts as a solo artist. Several songs have been released, but not as singles. In early March 2013, Gontier publicly announced and launched his Adam Gontier Solo Live Tour.

===2015–present: Saint Asonia===

In April 2014, Gontier and Staind guitarist Mike Mushok began writing songs together, without the intention of creating a band. They soon garnered the interest of RCA Records. The duo later enlisted former Finger Eleven drummer Rich Beddoe, and former Dark New Day bassist Corey Lowery to complete their lineup. On May 15, 2015, the group released their debut single &quot;Better Place&quot;. The band released their debut self-titled studio album on July 31, 2015. In early 2019, the group signed with Spinefarm Records and released their second studio album, &quot;Flawed Design&quot;, later that year. In 2022, the group released two EPs, &quot;Introvert&quot; and &quot;Extrovert&quot;, before releasing both EPs physically as &quot;Introvert/Extrovert&quot; with bonus tracks on December 9, 2022.

===Notable works and collaborations===
Outside of Three Days Grace, Gontier has also written and collaborated with numerous writers, musicians and bands. Some of his collaborations include Daughtry, Ian Thornley, Max Martin, Shaun Morgan, Ben Burnley, Art of Dying, Before the Curtain, and fellow musician and long time friend Grainne Ryan.

In 2006, Gontier was a member of the rock supergroup Big Dirty Band along with Geddy Lee, Alex Lifeson, Jeff Burrows, Ian Thornley and Care Failure, covering &quot;I Fought the Law&quot;, as part of the &quot;Trailer Park Boys&quot; movie soundtrack. He has also contributed to a number of other albums. He contributed vocals and musical arrangement on &quot;I Don&#x27;t Care&quot; on Apocalyptica&#x27;s album, &quot;Worlds Collide&quot; in 2007. In 2009, Adam Gontier worked with Daughtry on their second studio album &quot;Leave This Town&quot;. The song &quot;Back Again&quot; was featured on the physical copy of Daughtry&#x27;s &quot;Leave This Town: The B-Sides&quot; EP. 

In 2011, Gontier created the record label, Sludge Factory Records, and has signed three acts, one of which is fellow Peterborough band, Before the Curtain. Gontier was also featured on the track &quot;Raining&quot; by fellow Canadian band Art of Dying on their album &quot;Vices and Virtues&quot;.

On January 24, 2020, Breaking Benjamin released their compilation album, &quot;Aurora&quot;, that included Gontier on the track &quot;Dance with the Devil&quot;. In 2021, Gontier released a song for &quot;PUBG Mobile&quot; titled, &quot;Tidal Wave&quot;. In January 2023, he was featured on Skillet&#x27;s song &quot;Finish Line&quot;, on the deluxe edition of &quot;Dominion&quot;. Gontier formed a new project called Diviidedby together with former USS MC Jason &quot;Human Kebab&quot; Parsons in April 2023. In late 2023, he was featured on the 2023 version of &quot;Let the Sparks Fly&quot; by Thousand Foot Krutch.

== Awards ==
In 2004, Gontier was named on &quot;Chart Attack&quot; magazine&#x27;s &quot;20 Sexiest Canadian Musicians&quot; list. In 2006, Gontier and Three Days Grace won the &quot;Billboard&quot; Music Awards for Rock Single of the Year. In 2008, Gontier won the BMI Pop Awards. Michael Bell handed him the &quot;Big Time Award&quot;, at the 2012 &quot;Wire Awards&quot;. Gontier was inducted into the Norwood District High School Hall of Honor in July 2022 along with Brad and Matt Walst.

== Personal life ==

Gontier married Naomi Faith Brewer in May 2004. The couple divorced in 2013. He married Jeanie Marie Larsen in March 2015. His cousin, Cale Gontier, is the bass player for Art of Dying and Saint Asonia. As of 2023, he resides in Nashville, Tennessee.

In 2005, Gontier went into rehabilitation at the CAMH (Centre for Addiction and Mental Health) in Toronto, where he wrote many of the songs for &quot;One-X&quot;, including &quot;Never Too Late&quot;, which was co-written by Adam&#x27;s ex-wife, Naomi Faith Brewer. Both Gontier and Brewer wrote the video for the song, and she also appears in the video. While in CAMH in Toronto, Gontier wrote &quot;Pain&quot;, &quot;Animal I Have Become&quot;, &quot;Get Out Alive&quot;, &quot;Over and Over&quot;, and &quot;Gone Forever&quot;. A docu-drama about his addiction, &quot;Behind the Pain&quot;, was released in 2007. Gontier has been open about his struggles with mental health. He stated that he relapsed in 2017 and went into a treatment center. Since then, Gontier has been sober and stated that he has &quot;no plans on going back to a dark place anytime soon.&quot;

<text>William Marion Jardine (January 16, 1879January 17, 1955) was an American administrator and educator. He served as the United States secretary of agriculture from 1925 to 1929 and as the U.S. minister to Egypt from 1930 to 1933.

==Early life and education==
Jardine was born in Oneida County, Idaho, to Rebecca and William Jardine. He graduated with a bachelor of science degree from Utah Agricultural College (today Utah State University) in Logan, Utah. On September 6, 1905, Jardine married the former Effie Lane Nebeker; they had three children. He attended graduate school at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign in 1906.

Jardine had a strong interest in practical farming. He was also attracted to the opportunities in education. He began his teaching in Utah, where he soon became professor of agronomy. In 1910, Jardine moved to Manhattan, Kansas, to accept the position of agronomist at the Kansas State Agricultural College. Three years later, Jardine was made dean of the Division of Agriculture and was Director of the Agriculture Experiment Station.

==President of Kansas State University==
On March 1, 1918, Jardine became the seventh President of Kansas State University. He served until February 28, 1925, when he was succeeded by Francis D. Farrell. The office had been vacant after Henry J. Waters resigned to become managing editor of the &quot;Weekly Kansas City Star&quot;.

During his time in office, Jardine penned several handbooks, such as the &quot;Suggestions for Teachers Giving Practical Instruction to City Boys in (a) Care and Handling of Work Horses (b) Care, Adjustment, and Use of Farm Machinery (c) Care and Handling of Dairy Cows and Milk&quot;, which was published by the Kansas State Council of Defense.

Jardine achieved an outstanding reputation for his work in agricultural education that extended far beyond the borders of the state of Kansas.

==Secretary of Agriculture==

On March 5, 1925, President Calvin Coolidge appointed him United States Secretary of Agriculture, a position he held for the next four years.

==United States Minister to Egypt ==
At the end of the Coolidge administration on March 4, 1929, Jardine served in President Herbert Hoover&#x27;s administration as the United States Minister to Egypt from October 13, 1930, until September 5, 1933.

==President of Municipal University of Wichita==
After returning to Kansas in 1933, Jardine became the president of the Municipal University of Wichita (currently known as Wichita State University). Jardine was appointed by the Kansas State Treasurer from October 2, 1933, and he took the oath the following day. He served in this capacity from October 3, 1933, until 1949.

==Death==

Jardine was very active in education and government services until his death on January 17, 1955, in San Antonio, Texas. He is interred at the Logan City Cemetery in Logan, Utah.

Jardine was a Congregationalist and was a member of a Freemasons, Rotary, Alpha Zeta, Beta Theta Pi, Phi Kappa Phi, and the Sigma Xi.

Jardine&#x27;s papers are archived at Wichita State University in Kansas.

<text>Jarir ibn Atiyyah al-Khatafi Al-Tamimi () () was an Umayyad-era Arab poet and satirist from Najd. He was born during the reign of Rashidun caliph Uthman ibn Affan, and was a member of the tribe Kulaib, a part of the Banu Tamim. He was a native of al-Yamamah, but also spent time in Damascus at the court of the Umayyad caliphs.

Little is known of his early life, but he succeeded in winning the favor of Al-Hajjaj bin Yousef, the governor of Iraq. Already famous for his verse, he became more widely known by his feud with rival poets Farazdaq and Akhtal. Later he went to Damascus and visited the court of the caliph Abd al-Malik and that of his successor, Al-Walid I. From neither of these did he receive a warm welcome. He was, however, more successful with Umar II, and was the only poet received by the pious caliph.

His verse, like that of his contemporaries, is largely satire and eulogy.

A long series of verses by Farazdaq cover in satire his feud with Jarir and his tribe, the Bani Kulaib. These poems are published as &quot;the&quot; &quot;Nakaid of Jarir and al-Farazdaq&quot;. It is said that the feud between them lasted 40 years, and that Jarir supposedly enjoyed it so much that when he received the news of Farazdaq&#x27;s passing, he lost the will to live and spontaneously died thereafter.

<doc id="772827" wikidata="Q423777" url="?curid=772827" title="Allyl group">
<text>In organic chemistry, an allyl group is a substituent with the structural formula . It consists of a methylene bridge () attached to a vinyl group (). The name is derived from the scientific name for garlic, . In 1844, Theodor Wertheim isolated an allyl derivative from garlic oil and named it &quot;&quot;. The term allyl applies to many compounds related to , some of which are of practical or of everyday importance, for example, allyl chloride.

Allylation is any chemical reaction that adds an allyl group to a substrate.

==Nomenclature==
A site adjacent to the unsaturated carbon atom is called the allylic position or allylic site. A group attached at this site is sometimes described as allylic. Thus, &quot;has an allylic hydroxyl group&quot;. Allylic C−H bonds are about 15% weaker than the C−H bonds in ordinary sp3 carbon centers and are thus more reactive.

Benzylic and allylic are related in terms of structure, bond strength, and reactivity. Other reactions that tend to occur with allylic compounds are allylic oxidations, ene reactions, and the Tsuji–Trost reaction. Benzylic groups are related to allyl groups; both show enhanced reactivity.

===Pentadienyl group===

A group connected to two vinyl groups is said to be doubly allylic. The bond dissociation energy of C−H bonds on a doubly allylic centre is about 10% less than the bond dissociation energy of a C−H bond that is singly allylic. The weakened C−H bonds is reflected in the easy oxidation of compounds containing 1,4-pentadiene () linkages. Some polyunsaturated fatty acids feature this pentadiene group: linoleic acid, α-linolenic acid, and arachidonic acid. They are susceptible to a range of reactions with oxygen (O2), starting with lipid peroxidation. Products include fatty acid hydroperoxides, epoxy-hydroxy polyunsaturated fatty acids, jasmonates, divinylether fatty acids, and leaf aldehydes. Some of these derivatives are signallng molecules, some are used in plant defense (antifeedants), some are precursors to other metabolites that are used by the plant.

One practical consequence of their high reactivity is that polyunsaturated fatty acids have poor shelf life owing to their tendency toward autoxidation, leading, in the case of edibles, to rancidification. Metals accelerate the degradation. These fats tend to polymerize, forming semisolids. This reactivity pattern is fundamental to the film-forming behavior of the &quot;drying oils&quot;, which are components of oil paints and varnishes.
====Homoallylic====
The term homoallylic refers to the position on a carbon skeleton next to an allylic position. In but-3-enyl chloride , the chloride is homoallylic because it is bonded to the homoallylic site.

==Bonding==
The allyl group is widely encountered in organic chemistry. Allylic radicals, anions, and cations are often discussed as intermediates in reactions. All feature three contiguous sp²-hybridized carbon centers and all derive stability from resonance. Each species can be presented by two resonance structures with the charge or unpaired electron distributed at both 1,3 positions.

In terms of MO theory, the MO diagram has three molecular orbitals: the first one bonding, the second one non-bonding, and the higher energy orbital is antibonding.

==Reactions and applications==

This heightened reactivity of allylic groups has many practical consequences. The sulfur vulcanization or various rubbers exploits the conversion of allylic groups into crosslinks. Similarly drying oils such as linseed oil crosslink via oxygenation of allylic (or doubly allylic) sites. This crosslinking underpins the properties of paints and the spoilage of foods by rancidification.

The industrial production of acrylonitrile by ammoxidation of propene exploits the easy oxidation of the allylic C−H centers:
:&lt;chem&gt;2CH3-CH=CH2 + 2 NH3 + 3 O2 -&gt; 2CH2=CH-C#N + 6 H2O&lt;/chem&gt;

An estimated 800,000 tonnes (1997) of allyl chloride is produced by the chlorination of propylene:
:&lt;chem&gt;CH3CH=CH2 + Cl2 -&gt; ClCH2CH=CH2 + HCl&lt;/chem&gt;
It is the precursor to allyl alcohol and epichlorohydrin.

===Allylation===
Allylation is the attachment of an allyl group to a substrate, usually another organic compound. Classically, allylation involves the reaction of a carbanion with allyl chloride. Alternatives include carbonyl allylation with allylmetallic reagents, such as allyltrimethylsilane, or the iridium-catalyzed Krische allylation.

Allylation can be effected also by conjugate addition: the addition of an allyl group to the beta-position of an enone. The Hosomi-Sakurai reaction is a common method for conjugate allylation.
===Oxidation===
Allylic C-H bonds are susceptible to oxidation. One commercial application of allylic oxidation is the synthesis of nootkatone, the fragrance of grapefruit, from valencene, a more abundantly available sesquiterpenoid: 
In the synthesis of some fine chemicals, selenium dioxide is used to convert alkenes to allylic alcohols:
:R2C=CR&#x27;-CHR&quot;2 + [O] → R2C=CR&#x27;-C(OH)R&quot;2
where R, R&#x27;, R&quot; may be alkyl or aryl substituents.

From the industrial perspective, oxidation of benzylic C-H bonds are conducted on a particularly large scale, e.g. production of terephthalic acid, benzoic acid, and cumene hydroperoxide.

==Allyl compounds==
Many substituents can be attached to the allyl group to give stable compounds. Commercially important allyl compounds include:
*Crotyl alcohol (CH3CH=CH−CH2OH)
*Dimethylallyl pyrophosphate, central in the biosynthesis of terpenes, a precursor to many natural products, including natural rubber.
*Transition-metal allyl complexes, such as allylpalladium chloride dimer

<text>Hoyt Wayne Axton (March 25, 1938 – October 26, 1999) was an American singer-songwriter, guitarist and actor. He became prominent in the early 1960s, establishing himself on the West Coast as a folk singer with an earthy style and powerful voice. Among his best-known songs are &quot;Joy to the World&quot;, &quot;The Pusher&quot;, &quot;No No Song&quot;, &quot;Greenback Dollar&quot;, &quot;Della and the Dealer&quot;, &quot;Never Been to Spain&quot;, and “Boney Fingers”.

He was also a prolific character actor with many film and television roles to his credit, often playing a father figure in a number of films including &quot;The Black Stallion&quot; (1979), &quot;Heart Like a Wheel&quot; (1983) and &quot;Gremlins&quot; (1984).

==Early life==
Born in Duncan, Oklahoma, Axton spent his preteen years in Comanche, Oklahoma, with his brother John. His mother Mae Boren Axton, a songwriter, cowrote the song &quot;Heartbreak Hotel&quot;, which became a major hit for Elvis Presley. Some of Hoyt&#x27;s own songs were later recorded by Presley. Axton&#x27;s father John Thomas Axton was a naval officer stationed in Jacksonville, Florida, where the family joined him in 1949.

Axton graduated from Robert E. Lee High School in 1956 and left town after a hardware store was destroyed by fire on graduation night following a misguided prank.

He attended Oklahoma State University on a scholarship, where he played football, but he left to enlist in the U.S. Navy. Axton held the rank of Petty Officer Second Class and served on two ships, the USS &quot;Princeton&quot; (CV-37) and the USS &quot;Ranger &quot;(CVA-61).

Axton was a cousin of musician Arlo Guthrie. He was also the first cousin of David Boren, who served as governor of Oklahoma and three terms in the United States Senate and was also president of the University of Oklahoma.

==Career==
After his discharge from the Navy, Axton began singing folk songs in coffee houses and nightclubs in Southern California. In the early 1960s, he released his first folk album, &quot;The Balladeer&quot; (recorded at the Troubadour), which included his song &quot;Greenback Dollar.&quot; It became a 1963 hit for the Kingston Trio.

Axton released numerous albums throughout the 1960s and 1970s. In the mid-1970&#x27;s he produced studio covers of his own music for John Davidson, and also produced &quot;Tales From the Ozone&quot;, a 1975 album by Commander Cody and His Lost Planet Airmen. He released many minor hits of his own, such as &quot;Boney Fingers&quot;, &quot;When the Morning Comes&quot; and 1979&#x27;s &quot;Della and the Dealer&quot;. His vocal style featured his distinctive bass-baritone (which later deepened to near-bass) and use of characterization.

Axton first appeared on television in a David L. Wolper ABC production of &quot;The Story of a Folksinger&quot; (1963). He appeared on &quot;Hootenanny&quot;, hosted by Jack Linkletter, during this period. In 1965, he appeared in an episode of &quot;Bonanza&quot; in which he sang duets with Pernell Roberts. In 1966, he made his film debut in &quot;Smoky&quot; playing the role of Fred Denton, the evil brother of the character played by Fess Parker. He gained fame in the 1970s and 1980s through his film roles, including those in &quot;The Black Stallion&quot; (1979), &quot;Liar&#x27;s Moon&quot; (1982), &quot;Heart Like a Wheel&quot; (1983) and &quot;Gremlins&quot; (1984). His television appearances included &quot;McCloud&quot; (1976), &quot;The Bionic Woman&quot; (1976), &quot;WKRP in Cincinnati&quot; (1979) and &quot;Diff&#x27;rent Strokes&quot; (1984, 1985). In 1980, he sang the theme song to the short-lived series &quot;Flo&quot;, and guest-starred as himself in the episode titled &quot;You Gotta Have Hoyt&quot;. Axton sang the jingle &quot;The Ballad of Big Mac&quot; for a 1969 McDonald&#x27;s Big Mac television commercial as well as &quot;Head for the Mountains&quot; in voiceovers for Busch beer in the 1980s. He appeared in a Pizza Hut commercial in 1985 and in a TV spot for FTD with Merlin Olsen in 1989. In 1991 Axton was awarded an induction to The Walk of Western Stars in Newhall, California.

Axton&#x27;s most lasting contributions, however, were songs made famous by others: &quot;Joy to the World&quot; (Three Dog Night) and &quot;Never Been to Spain&quot; for both Three Dog Night and Elvis Presley, &quot;Greenback Dollar&quot; for the Kingston Trio, &quot;The Pusher&quot; and &quot;Snowblind Friend&quot; for Steppenwolf, &quot;No No Song&quot; for Ringo Starr, and songs covered by singers such as Joan Baez, Arlo Guthrie, John Denver, Nina Simone, Waylon Jennings, Martha Reeves, Jonathan Edwards, Glen Campbell, Anne Murray, Harry Belafonte, David Clayton-Thomas and Colter Wall. Axton sang duets with Linda Ronstadt on the songs &quot;Lion in the Winter&quot; and &quot;When the Morning Comes&quot;, with Renee Armand on &quot;Boney Fingers&quot; and with Tanya Tucker on &quot;You Taught Me How to Cry.&quot; His composition &quot;Joy to the World&quot;, performed by Three Dog Night, reached #1 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 chart for six straight weeks in 1971, making it the top hit of the year. He named his record label Jeremiah after the bullfrog mentioned in the song.

==Personal life==
Axton was married four times; his first three marriages ended in divorce. He had five children. One of his children, Matt Axton, is a musician.

Axton struggled with cocaine addiction, and several of his songs, including &quot;The Pusher&quot;, &quot;Snowblind Friend&quot; and &quot;No No Song&quot;, partly reflect his experiences with the drug. He was a proponent of medical marijuana use, but he and his wife Deborah were arrested in February 1997 at their Montana home for possession of about of marijuana. His wife later explained that she offered Axton marijuana to relieve his pain and stress following his 1995 stroke. They were fined and received deferred sentences. Axton never fully recovered from his stroke, and he used a wheelchair for the remainder of his life.

==Death==
Axton died at age 61 at his home in Victor, Montana on October 26, 1999, after suffering two heart attacks in two weeks.

On November 1, 2007, Axton and his mother Mae Boren Axton were inducted posthumously into the Oklahoma Music Hall of Fame in Muskogee, Oklahoma.

<text>Carla Speed McNeil is an American science fiction writer, cartoonist, and illustrator of comics, best known for the science fiction comic book series &quot;Finder&quot;.

==Career==
McNeil&#x27;s chief work is the ongoing science fiction comic series &quot;Finder&quot;, which they began self-publishing in 1996. In 2005, they started to publish &quot;Finder&quot; as a webcomic. The comic was published and available to read on their website until it began to be published by Dark Horse Comics in 2011.

A majority of McNeil&#x27;s career is focused on collaborations with other comic artists and writers. In 2001, McNeil provided a two-page guest-illustrator spot for Warren Ellis&#x27; &quot;Transmetropolitan: Filth of the City&quot;. They continued their work with him in 2005 by illustrating the one-shot &quot;Frank Ironwine&quot; in Ellis&#x27; &quot;Apparat Volume 1&quot;.&quot; McNeil also worked as an illustrator alongside Greg Rucka on the Oni Press series &quot;Queen &amp; Country&quot; in 2004. In 2008, McNeil adapted and illustrated D. J. MacHale&#x27;s first Pendragon book, &quot;The Merchant of Death&quot;, into a graphic novel, and it was released by Simon and Schuster on May 20, 2008. In 2013, McNeil participated in multiple collaborations with other artists. They collaborated with Alex de Campi for two comics: they illustrated a few pages of the graphic novel &quot;Ashes,&quot; as well as the first issue of &quot;My Little Pony: Friends Forever,&quot; which was released by IDW Publishing. They also did illustrative work for Devin Grayson&#x27;s &quot;Legends of Red Sonja&quot;. Together with Sara Ryan, they released &quot;Bad Houses&quot; in 2013 from Dark Horse Comics, which received general acclaim upon release. In April 2015, McNeil started illustrating &quot;No Mercy&quot;, a series written by Alex de Campi and colored by Jenn Manley Lee. The series is published by Image Comics, and is ongoing.

McNeil has also worked on numerous anthologies throughout their career. In 2005, McNeil wrote a comic for the anthology &quot;Dignifying Science,&quot; which is a collection about women scientists. They have also illustrated Elizabeth Genco&#x27;s &quot;Here. In My Head&quot; for the 2008 anthology &quot;Comic Book Tattoo&quot;, which is a collection based on the songs of Tori Amos. They have done work for Saucy Goose Press&#x27; anthology &quot;Smut Peddler,&quot; which is a collection of comics centered around sex positivity&quot;.&quot; McNeil wrote and drew a story in the first edition, and illustrated the cover and end piece of &quot;Smut Peddler: 2014 Edition&quot;, which was one of the most successful Kickstarter comics of 2014. They wrote and drew the story &quot;Frog and Snake Never Play Together&quot; for the popular anthology &quot;Cautionary Fables and Fairy Tales Vol 2: Africa Edition&quot; in 2014.

In 2015, McNeil wrote and illustrated &quot;Both Ends of the Leash,&quot; a story that appeared in &quot;Sensation Comics Featuring Wonder Woman&quot;, for DC Comics.

==Awards==
In 1997, at San Diego Comic-Con, McNeil won the Lulu Awards&#x27; Kimberly Yale Award for Best New Talent for their work on &quot;Finder&quot; and &quot;Shanda the Panda&quot;. McNeil also won the Ignatz Award for Promising New Talent in 1998.

McNeil was nominated for Lulu Award Lulu of the Year in 2001 and 2002, and for an Ignatz Award for Outstanding Artist in 2001. &quot;Finder&quot; won the Ignatz for Outstanding Series in 2004 and 2005. Their work has been nominated for Eisner Awards in several categories over the years (including &quot;Best Writer/Artist&quot; in 2002 and 2003, and &quot;Best Lettering&quot; for &quot;Finder&quot; and &quot;Bad Houses&quot; in 2014), and won &quot;Best Webcomic&quot; for &quot;Finder&quot; in 2009. &quot;Finder: Voice&quot; won the 2011 Los Angeles Times Book Prize (Graphic Novel).

<text>In solar thermal collectors, a selective surface or selective [[Absorption (electromagnetic radiation)|absorber]] is a means of increasing its operation temperature and/or efficiency. The selectivity is defined as the ratio of solar radiation absorption (αsol) to thermal infrared radiation emission (εtherm).

Selective surfaces take advantage of the differing wavelengths of incident solar radiation and the emissive radiation from the absorbing surface:
* Solar radiation covers approximately the wavelengths 350 nm to 4000 nm; UV-A, visible and near infrared (NIR, or IR-A plus IR-B).
* Thermal infrared radiation, from materials with temperatures approximately in the interval -40 to 100 °C, covers approximately the wavelengths 4000 nm to 40,000 nm = 4 um to 40 um; The thermal infrared radiation interval being named or covered by: MIR, LWIR or IR-C.

== Materials ==
Normally, a combination of materials is used. One of the first selective surfaces investigated was a semiconductor-metal tandem – simply copper with a layer of black cupric oxide. Silicon on metal is also another example. A different design has ceramic–metal composites (cermets) on metal substrates. Black chromium (&quot;black chrome&quot;) and nickel-plated anodized aluminum is another selective surface that is very durable, highly resistant to humidity or oxidizing atmospheres and extreme temperatures, while being able to retain its selective properties, but expensive. One of the more popular designs – a multi-layer broadband solar absorber – consists of a metal substrate coated with multiple layers of metal and dielectric materials. While those have to be vacuum-deposited, they have been widely adopted due to their suitability for vacuum tubes.

Although ordinary black paint has high solar absorption, it also has high thermal emissivity, and thus it is not a selective surface.

Typical values for a selective surface might be 0.90 solar absorption and 0.10 thermal emissivity, but can range from 0.8/0.3 for paints on metal to 0.96/0.05 for commercial surfaces. Thermal emissivities as low as 0.02 have been obtained in laboratories.

== Other applications ==
Selective surfaces are used for other applications than solar thermal collectors, such as low emissivity surfaces used in window glasses, which reflect thermal radiation and have high transmittance factors (being transparent) for visible sunlight.

<text>Everworld is a fantasy novel series co-authored by Katherine Applegate and her husband Michael Grant, writing together under the name K. A. Applegate, and published by Scholastic between 1999 and 2001. It consists of twelve books and a companion music CD titled &quot;The Everworld Experience&quot;.

==The Plot==
The series features five protagonists: David, April, Christopher, Senna and Jalil. When Senna is kidnapped by the wolf Fenrir , the remaining protagonists in an attempt to save her are catapulted into an alternative fantasy world, called Everworld. The protagonists live in both worlds, Everworld and the normal world. Every time they fall asleep, they can see what they are doing in the normal world; where they continue to lead their lives as usual. In Everworld, however; often accompanied by the god Loki , they will have to face powerful enemies and visit places that they thought existed only in fairy tales and myths, trying to survive, to prevent evil creatures from opening a passage to the normal world and to understand the why and how of their comings and goings.

==Main characters==
* David Levin: The self-appointed leader of the protagonists. David takes on all the burdens of the group, and has been troubled by his past in which he was cowardly; he must prove himself to be a man. Before being sucked into Everworld, he was involved in a romantic relationship with Senna Wales. As such, he is most susceptible to the influence of Senna&#x27;s powers. He shows his courage and bravery before Zeus, other gods, and Vikings. David fights with the Sword of Galahad, after witnessing Sir Galahad&#x27;s death. At the end of the series, he opts to stay in Everworld to help protect it, as well as to escape his mother&#x27;s smoking and depression problems. David narrates &quot;#1: Search for Senna&quot;, &quot;#5: Discover the Destroyer&quot;, and &quot;#10: Understand the Unknown&quot;.
* Christopher Hitchcock: The reluctant clown of the group, Christopher often makes jokes specifically targeted towards the other members of the group (April (sexism), Jalil (racism), and David (antisemitism)). He does this to keep the others at a distance, so they won&#x27;t get to know him. Christopher is, in his own words, on the road to becoming an alcoholic like his parents. However, he can be a jerk one minute, and a kind, caring person the next. Christopher gave up the offer to become an immortal because he failed to save the life of Ganymede, Zeus&#x27; male lover; blaming his failure on latent homophobia causes Christopher to fall into an alcoholic depression and is the turning point for his character. Christopher also decreases in his prejudice jokes when Keith, who is part of a group of racists and anti-Semitics that plan to overthrow the government, tries to recruit him. At the end of the series, he opts to stay in Everworld to avoid his parents&#x27; alcoholic nature, escape his younger brother&#x27;s ridicule and abuse, and stay off the road to a possible alcoholic future. Christopher narrates &quot;#2: Land of Loss&quot;, &quot;#6: Fear the Fantastic&quot;, and &quot;#11: Mystify the Magician&quot;.
* April O&#x27;Brien: The heroine of the group, April is Senna&#x27;s half-sister; their personalities, however, are directly opposite, and the two hate each other with a passion. April is a devout Catholic, somewhat feminist, and very beautiful with red hair and green eyes. She is in the drama club at her real world school, and she is often singing songs from &quot;Rent&quot;. She is also said to be very popular at the main characters&#x27; high school. April carries her own burdens in the group, and is often the voice of reason next to Jalil. She is a vegetarian. She has the most reason to want to return to the Old World at the end of the series, due to how much she could possibly leave behind. Ultimately, however, she opts to remain in Everworld due to her unbearable guilt and inability to face her father over her murder of Senna, knowing that it would never be acceptable in their home world, no matter how necessary it had been in Everworld. April narrates &quot;#3: Enter the Enchanted&quot;, &quot;#7: Gateway to the Gods&quot;, and &quot;#12: Entertain the End&quot;.
* Jalil Sherman: The scientist and sole African-American of the group, he wants to find the &quot;software&quot; on which Everworld runs and control it. In the real world, Jalil is obsessive-compulsive, but in Everworld, he is unaffected. His disorder is a secret to the rest of the group for a majority of the series. Senna, however, knows of his condition and was able to temporarily cure it while the two were in the Old World, on the condition he would swear to serve her. He refused. Jalil always tries hard to search for a logical explanation for the many illogical phenomena in Everworld. He and April often butt heads when it comes to religion since he&#x27;s an atheist and naturalist, but the two often fall on the same side in arguments within the group. At the end of the series, he opts to stay in Everworld rather than return home to the Old World because he does not have to live with his disorder. His name ironically means &quot;godlike.&quot; Jalil narrates &quot;#4: Realm of the Reaper&quot; and &quot;#8: Brave the Betrayal&quot;.
* Senna Wales: The witch who intertwines all the characters. Senna is David&#x27;s girlfriend, Christopher&#x27;s ex-girlfriend, and April&#x27;s half-sister (they have the same father and different mothers) and has blond hair and gray eyes. Senna is the only main character with real magical power, and at times, uses the others for her own ends, whether through emotional manipulation or magic. Her magical power is much stronger in Everworld than in the Old World. Her name was originally Senda (meaning &quot;gateway&quot; in Spanish), but after her mother left her she began to refer to herself based on her father&#x27;s mispronunciation. Senna sometimes uses her powers on others for her own benefit, whether for protection or distraction, though usually in an effort to further her own plans. Senna&#x27;s ultimate goal is to overthrow the powers of Everworld and rule over it for her own. She is ultimately foiled in her plan, however, when she is killed by April in the penultimate book. Senna only narrates &quot;#9: Inside the Illusion&quot;.

==Recurring characters==
* Loki: The Norse god of destruction who brought David, Senna, Christopher, Jalil, and April into Everworld. Loki wants to use Senna as a gateway to the Old World to escape Ka Anor. Loki escaped from his prison when he was brought to Everworld centuries ago and at some point in the recent past overthrew and imprisoned Odin. He is also the father of Hel, Fenrir, and the Midgard Serpent.
* Ka Anor: The god-eating deity of the Hetwans who wants to devour all the gods in Everworld before they escape to the Old World. It also is trying to capture Senna, most likely to prevent the other gods from using her to escape.
* Thorolf: A Viking, in whose farm David, Christopher, Jalil, and April spend the night in &quot;Everworld #1: Search for Senna&quot;. Died and &quot;ascended&quot; to Valhalla in &quot;Everworld #8: Brave The Betrayal&quot;.
* Olaf Ironfoot: A Viking king with an iron foot, Olaf fought alongside David, Christopher, and Jalil against the Aztecs. He engaged Huitzilopoctli in personal combat wielding Mjolnir, before being sliced in half by the god. He is of African descent, likely due to the Vikings&#x27; tendency to intermarry with other peoples.
* Sven Swordeater: A young Viking who was stabbed through the cheeks, causing a speech impediment. Sven was also killed by Huitzilopoctli.
* Monsieur Jean-Claude LeMieux: A Frenchman who is brought to Everworld thanks to a nuclear explosion. He lives in and is the mayor of the Greek version of Atlantis.
* Etain: An Irish woman, the half-elf daughter of the Queen of the Elves, whom Christopher falls in love with. Etain seems to have feelings for him too; however, the series ends with the implication that she probably married the dwarf-king Baldwin in exchange for his assistance in the war to save Everworld.
* Keith: A violent and suicidal Neo-Nazi who worked with Christopher at an independent copy store for a short amount of time.
* Anica: A Wiccan who fled the Old World when Loki and other forces desiring a gateway began to search for her, taking refuge with the Egyption Pantheon of Everworld. Before leaving she left her illegitimate daughter with the girl&#x27;s father and his family, the O&#x27;Briens. Anica fears Senna&#x27;s wrath above all else, but at the same time, seeks her forgiveness. She is last seen pleading for it, but it is unknown as to whether or not she receives it from Senna.
* Merlin: The famous wizard who, along with Ka Anor and Loki, is trying to capture Senna, though in his case it is merely to keep anyone from using her, and likely to prevent her takeover of Everworld. Senna fears him the most, and refers to him as the most powerful being in Everworld, because while he lacks the power of the average god, his cleverness and imagination give him an edge. His ultimate goal is to bring all the deities and people of Everworld together to stop Ka Anor, a goal that is finally coming to fruition by the end of the series.

==People==

===Old-Worlders===
The Old-Worlders are people who do not live in Everworld and who live
in the old world (Earth).

===Gods===
Many gods were in the Everworld series. Nearly all the gods shared similar characteristics such as shape shifting, physical perfection, superhuman strength and immortality. They could only be killed by the weapon of another god such as Thor&#x27;s hammer Mjolnir or through severe injury. Even then, there is a chance they could heal. Real world weapons however do seem to harm gods. When the Sennites arrived with automatic weapons, they apparently killed Fenrir. Many of the gods had special powers related to their field and some were radically more powerful than others. Nearly all of them were portrayed as being cold and cruel in their attitude toward humans if not outright insane due to their power and long lives and would rather carry on their petty squabbles from ancient times. Most are slow to change or act unless they feel immediately threatened allowing the threat of the Hetwan to grow. The gods in Everworld included:
*Greek
**Zeus
**Athena
**Apollo
**Artemis
**Ares
**Dionysus
**Heracles
**Hera
**Hermes (not specifically named, but seen)
**Aphrodite
**Eros
**Ganymede (Eaten by Ka Anor)
**Poseidon
*Norse
**Odin
**Loki
**Baldur
**Thor
**Hel
**Midgard Serpent
**Fenrir (Apparently killed by the Sennites)
**Valkyries
*Egyptian
**Amun-Ra
**Sobek
**Osiris
**Isis
**Khnum (not specifically named, but seen)
*Roman
**Jupiter
**Neptune
**Venus
*Aztec
**Huitzilopoctli
**Quetzalcoatl
*Celtic
**Daghda (Eaten by Ka Anor)
**Brigid
**Donn
*African
**Eshu
*Mesopotamia
**Ereshkigal
*Persian
**Ahriman
*Hetwan
**Ka Anor
*Coo-Hatch
**Goddess of the Ore
**God of Fire
&quot;This list is not complete&quot;

===Vikings===
The Vikings are very similar to their real world counterparts, but in many ways are easier to relate to than other groups of people. A mixture of farmers, craftsmen and warriors that glorify battle, but are trustworthy allies. Among the peoples of Everworld they are easy to get along with and motivate into needed action instead of bickering amongst themselves. They are also the most cosmopolitan of Everworld humans, as they readily accept people of other races into their ranks (African, Asian, etc.) They worshiped Loki for an unknown period of time when he overthrew Odin and other major gods such as Thor and Balder disappeared.

===Aztecs===
The Aztecs, in their &quot;Everworld&quot; incarnation, are portrayed as an utterly savage and barbaric society of cannibals. They are first encountered at the end of the first book, &quot;Search for Senna&quot;. The Aztecs are known by many names in Everworld, including &quot;The Blood-Drinkers,&quot; &quot;The Mexica,&quot; and &quot;The Heart Eaters.&quot; Some groups worship Huitzilopoctli, while others worship Quetzalcoatl.

===Coo-Hatch===
The Coo-Hatch are strange creatures from an alien world who abandoned their gods after their God of the Flame and Goddess of the Ore brought them to Everworld against their will. A majority of the Coo-Hatch seem to be disillusioned by their deities and Everworld and want to go back to their realm. They often ally themselves with whomever they believe can achieve this goal. They have large red eyes with blue pupils, two main arms as well as two smaller arms that have more dexterity and are on the sides of their faces. Their mouths are long and tapered. Juvenile Coo-Hatch are small and flighted with needle-like mouths. The juveniles are very fast fliers, covering a space of 20 feet in the length of a human blink.

The Coo-Hatch are also master metal forgers and can create blades sharp enough to cut through any known material; they use this skill to make small, accurate throwing blades and metal tools. In exchange of April&#x27;s chemistry book, the Coo-Hatch improve Jalil&#x27;s pocket knife to their quality of metal, giving them a small blade that can cut through anything, the group dubbing it &quot;Excalibur&quot;. The Coo-Hatch had no knowledge of guns or explosives prior to the exchange. The Coo-Hatch used the textbook to develop primitive cannons. The Coo-Hatch then aided the Hetwans in almost taking over Mt. Olympus. Later, some of the tribes of the Coo-Hatch team up with the protagonists and develop cannons to use in an assault on the Hetwans (which supposedly takes place after the series end).

Their one true desire is to go back to their forges on their home world, which they cannot do without a gateway like Senna or her mother. Though this plot was not built upon later in the series, Senna&#x27;s mother was sought out to send them back to their world.

===Hetwan===
The Hetwan are large, sentient insectoid aliens that seem to exist as a collective hive rather than as a group of individuals. Male Hetwan consist of two arms, a pair of wings, fly-like eyes, and three constantly moving claws near their mouths. The claws are used to grasp a tube that is then used to project the Hetwan&#x27;s acidic saliva. They continue moving at a slower pace after death. Female Hetwan are flying translucent sacks of organs. They travel in packs, where, upon encountering male Hetwan, they are savagely torn apart, thus birthing perhaps a dozen Hetwan on the waist of the male.

The Hetwan worship Ka Anor, the dread god of terror, and serve his will to devour all the gods in Everworld. Though aliens, the Hetwan have no high-tech weaponry. They do, however, wield devices similar to long straws (nicknamed &quot;Super-Soakers&quot; by the main characters), out of which they shoot a burning, venomous acid. The Hetwan themselves seem to feel no fear of death or anything. As repeatedly stated by them they exist merely to serve Ka Anor and are absolutely loyal to him.

The Hetwan live in a great city that resembles a giant needle sticking out of a pit (referred to by Chris as &quot;Junkie Dreamland&quot;), with an assortment of strange creatures from their home world.

The main characters often fight against the Hetwan. Because Ka Anor intends to eventually kill and consume all of Everworld&#x27;s gods, most of the peoples of Everworld would be considered enemies of the Hetwan, although they generally seek to appease them out of fear of destruction.

Little is known about the Hetwans&#x27; life before Everworld, but like all alien species (those not from human mythology), they were brought there from another world (not &quot;our&quot; world) by their particular deity, the dread-god Ka Anor. They then began to conquer everything they came across, while collecting gods for their deity to consume. The Hetwan kingdom in Everworld alternates between perfectly hemispherical hills and gullies, giving a scooped-out appearance. The alien trees make strange musical sounds. The Hetwan capital, where Ka Anor resides, is a massive tower (dubbed &quot;Junkie Dream Mountain&quot; for its needle-like appearance) in the middle of a lava and glass filled crater. The only transportation across this gulf is by means of the &quot;Red Wings&quot;, giant insects that can carry passengers.

===Knights===
The knights are classic men of chivalry. Self-described as &quot;creatures of myth and legend&quot;, their main pastimes seem to be slaying dragons, rescuing young girls, and feasting. Despite witnessing April taking out several trolls, the knights still believe that women should act &quot;womanly&quot;—no fighting, allowing themselves to be looked over and pampered. They are very brave and value honor highly. The knights met in the series were all surviving members of the Knights of the Round Table such as Galahad. While they had not aged since entering Everworld they lack the immortality of many other beings. Merlin is often allied with these beings.

===Eunuchs===
The eunuchs in Everworld are male warriors with big, muscular bodies but with high-pitched voices; this is because they were castrated before they reached puberty.

The symbol on their breastplates is a bloody dagger with two red diamonds. They always say &quot;jewels&quot; when referring to testicles. The eunuchs guard the City of Hel (known only as &quot;Her City&quot;), kidnapping men to inhabit it as Hel&#x27;s personal harem. (Why Hel&#x27;s harem requires eunuchs is never explained, but perhaps indicates that her powers over or interest in castrated males is reduced or nonexistent.)

===Fairies===
The fairies share some characteristics with the wood nymphs. Like nymphs, they are about four feet tall and rather thin. Fairies can move quickly when necessary, though not as quickly as nymphs can. Unlike the fairies commonly portrayed, they do not have wings. Their typical attire is a leather tunic and a tight helmet, and their main weapons are arrows and swords. Different colored tunics signify different jobs within Fairy Land; for example, a fairy wearing a dark blue tunic is part of the fairy version of the IRS and goes around making notes on the various stands within the city, while a fairy in a black tunic is part of the police force.

Fairies in Everworld, also called &quot;leprechauns&quot;, are known for their cupidity---Fairy Land, which is very pristine and clean compared to other parts of Everworld, serves as a kind of economic center for the entire world. It has a King and Queen; though it is unclear who has official power, the Queen is portrayed as the brains of the two.

===Greeks===
In the books, the Greeks are battling the Hetwan to keep Ka Anor from conquering Mount Olympus. They live in the land surrounding the Everworld equivalent of Mt. Olympus. They worship Zeus along with the other Olympian gods such as, Ares, Hera, and Athena. Among the gods of Everworld, Olympus is implied to be one of the most powerful places due to the large number of gods living there. Athena is one of the few gods who not only acts in a sane manner, but also aides the protagonists in their quest.

===Egyptians===
The Egyptians are a reactionary race living along the Nile. Due to centuries of ritual and inbreeding the Egyptian culture became weak. The Amazons, led by Pretty Little Flower used this to their advantage and proceeded to subjugate and loot Egypt. This ended when the crocodile god Sobek freed the capital and killed Pretty Little Flower, becoming Lord of all Egypt. The rest of the Egyptian gods had become living statues due to their long lives and dedication to ritual.

===Dwarves===
Dwarves are a mountain dwelling race. Dwarves stand about four feet tall with extremely stocky builds. Most dwarves have long hair and beards. They are generally seen with chainmail and some sort of weapon. While most dwarves seen are men, often women are mistaken for men, due to their masculine appearance. They are skilled in both mining and blacksmithing.

The dwarves are led by King Baldwin, who resides in his capital of Daggermouth. Beneath Daggermouth is a mining complex known as the Five Hills, each of which produce a different kind of metal. They are known to have close relations to the Vikings, as is evidenced by their metalwork in Viking ships, as well as their reverence for Thor and Baldur.

===Mermaids===
Mermaids are ruled by Neptune. In the book, there are mermen, as well. The mermen act as guards and are part of Neptune&#x27;s army. The mermaids swim around topless, and much to Christopher&#x27;s delight, their hair rarely manages to cover their nudity. They live underwater in the Roman version of Atlantis.

===Atlanteans===
A technologically advanced race living under Everworld&#x27;s ocean. They are led by Jean-Claude LeMieux, who serves as mayor of the city. There is a Roman and a Greek version of the city.

===Irish===
In the books, the Irish have embraced technology faster than any other people; in one of their cities, they have electricity and cable cars. This is believed to come to some degree from the telegraph that the main characters brought to Everworld, but also from the goddess Brigid. Their knowledge also may have come from the Druids, who are ordered by colors; the &quot;yellow&quot; druids being those in the study of electricity and technology. The lands of the Irish are protected by the Fiannans, a special order of knights. They are ruled by a number of kings who are ruled by a high king. Merlin is closely allied with them and they attribute his wisdom to maintaining peace in their land for over two hundred years.

===Sennites===
The Sennites are a group of white supremacists Senna brought over from the Old World. With modern weapons, they are a force to be reckoned with. At the beginning of the final book, &quot;Entertain the End&quot;, with Senna dead, David and the others wonder if the Sennites might forge an alliance with Ka Anor and the Hetwan. This forces the four to make a deal with the gods in order to stem the threat.

<text>Zacazonapan (pronounced sah-kah-soh-NAH-pahn) is a municipality near Mexico City. It&#x27;s municipal seat is the village of Zacazonapan. The name comes from Nahuatl and roughly translates to &quot;in the River of the Dry Corn plants&quot;

==The village==

The area was settled by the Matlatzincas who were conquered by the Aztecs, making the area a border zone between the Aztec Empire and Purépecha lands. After the fall of the Aztec Empire by the Spaniards, the area was subdued by Andrés de Tapia and Gonzalo de Sandoval. They, among other conquistadors they exploited the area&#x27;s mineral deposits making it part of the “Real de Minas de Temascaltepec” (today Valle de Bravo). Large haciendas dedicated to growing crops and raising cattle were established here as well. Evangelization was carried out by Franciscans, who were followed by Spanish families bringing sugar cane and fruit trees to plant. In 1521, Zacazonapan was included in the Indian Republic of Tmascaltepec. The modern village of Zacazonapan has its roots in a hacienda known as Santa Maria. It was very important to the development of the area because of the irrigation system it constructed on its lands, which constituted much of what is now the municipality.

The village of Zacazonapan originally belonged to the municipality of Otzoloapan. After arriving in the late 19th century, and receiving a warm welcome, General Juan N. Mirafuentes started a movement to make the village a municipal seat separate from Otzoloapan. This was accomplished on April 5, 1879 with C. Juan de Dios Villafaña Salinas as the first municipal president.

The area saw fighting during the Mexican Revolution, but many families hid or moved away during the conflict. During the Cristero War, the area saw fighting as well including the capture and execution of three prominent Cristero priests. 

As a municipal seat in the State of Mexico, Zacazonapan was remodeled by Carlos Hank González in 1974. 

The population of the modern town as of 2005 was 2,718. 
The nearby ex-hacienda of Santa Maria, constructed in the 16th century was declared a historic monument by the National Institute of Anthropology and History in 1994 as well as the house of Victoriano Arroyo Garibay, constructed in 1900 due to its architecture. There are also unexplored archeological sites in the surrounding municipality. 

The town has a song written about it, written by Rubén Méndez del Castillo, which won second place in a song contest in the state capital of Toluca in 1972.

As municipal seat, the village of Zacazonapan is the governing authority for the following communities: Alcantarilla, La Cañada, Naranjo, El Potrero, Santa María, Tizapa, Temascal, Arrastradero, El Puente, El Puerto, and Cerro Pelón along with 15 unnamed settlements. The population of the entire municipality is 3,836.

It is bordered by the municipalities of Otzoloapan, Tejupilco Temascaltepec and Valle de Bravo. The municipality has a territory of 67.14 square km.

The municipality borders the edge of the Sierra Madre del Sur giving it an uneven landscape with elevations such as the Cerro(hill) de La Pila, Cerro Sombrero, and Cerro Pelón. However, to the north there are also notable cerros such as El Xomil, Peña Colorada, and Peñas del Fraile. The most important river is the Temascaltepec, because of its year-round flow and as it receives the seasonal flow from arroyos such as the Zacazonapan, La Papaya and San José. There is also a series of freshwater springs.

In the mid 20th century, the economy of the municipality was based on fishing, agriculture and the production of piloncillo, a sugar cane product used for seasoning. Agriculture (corn, tomato and husk tomato) and fish farming are still the main occupations. The only other significant economic activity, providing a significant number of jobs, is realized by Minera Tizapa, S.A. de C.V., which mines zinc, lead and copper, with small amounts of gold and silver.

<text>Albert of Riga or Albert of Livonia ( – 17 January 1229) was the third Catholic Bishop of Riga in Livonia. In 1201, he allegedly founded the city of Riga, the modern capital of Latvia. The building of the Riga Cathedral started during his tenure there in 1221.

Albert headed the armed forces that forcibly converted the pagan indigenous population of the eastern Baltic region to Christianity as a result of the Northern Crusades. 

== Early life ==
Albert was born in Bexhövede, a part of Loxstedt, Lower Saxony, Germany. He and his brother Hermann were members of the powerful Buxhoeveden family from Bexhövede. Because of this he has also been known as Albert of Buxhoeveden (or &quot;Bexhövede&quot;, &quot;Buxhövden&quot;, &quot;Buxhöwde&quot;, &quot;Buxthoeven&quot;, &quot;Appeldern&quot;).

Albert was a canon in Bremen when his uncle Hartwig, Archbishop of Bremen and Hamburg, named him Bishop of Livonia, provided that he could conquer and hold it, and convince the pagan inhabitants to become Christians. The patent was granted on 28 March 1199, and in the beginning of spring 1200 he embarked for Livonia with a fleet of 23 vessels and more than 1,500 armed crusaders. He had the support of the Hohenstaufen German king, Philip of Swabia, as well as an implicit blessing of Pope Innocent III.

In 1200, Bishop Albert led a crusade in Livonia, providing the starting point to create an ecclesiastical State. Albert arrived in his diocese in Ikšķile (Üxküll) with a sizeable army. He was able to send reinforcements without asking permission from the Pope. These rights led him to create an annual summer expedition from Lübeck to Livonia called the &quot;perpetual crusade&quot;.

== Foundation of Riga ==
When Albert realized that the diocese of Uexküll was located far away from the Daugava river to be effective, he founded a castle nearer the sea, where a small stream joined the Daugava creating a natural harbor. This castle would be the start of the foundation of Riga.

Together with merchants from the Baltic Sea island of Gotland, Albert founded Riga in 1201, where a small community of Hanseatic traders from Lübeck held a tentative trading encampment. In 1204, he received a papal bull to sign up crusaders.

He successfully converted many Livs under their leader Caupo, offering them protection against neighboring Lithuanian and Estonian tribes; Albert also subjugated Latvian principalities of Koknese, Jersika and Tālava later on. The conquest of Livonia in full occupied almost three decades of his life.

Albert created a military order, the Livonian Brothers of the Sword, and began to build his cathedral in 1215. King Philip made him a Prince of the Holy Roman Empire, with Livonia for a fief, and thus Albert became a &quot;Prince-Bishop&quot;. In 1225, King Henry (VII) of Germany confirmed the title of Prince for Albert and his brother, Hermann. Albert declared his diocese independent of Bremen, and later Riga was raised to an archbishopric.

A first-hand account of Albert is in the contemporary &quot;Livonian Chronicle of Henry&quot; by Henry of Latvia.

Albert died in Riga in 1229. As a Catholic bishop, he left no descendants. He was venerated as a Catholic saint until the Protestant Reformation. The present-day von Buxhoeveden are descendants of his cousin Johannes von Buxhoeveden. Albert&#x27;s brother Theodoricus married a niece of the prince of Novgorod Mstislav Mstislavich and is the progenitor of the family &quot;de Raupena&quot; (&quot;de Ropa&quot;, known today as &quot;von der Ropp&quot;) that founded manors in Livonia and Courland.

Albert Street in Riga is named after Bishop Albert.

<text>The Salinas Valley (Spanish: &quot;Valle de Salinas&quot;) is one of the major valleys and most productive agricultural regions in California. It is located west of the San Joaquin Valley and south of San Francisco Bay and the Santa Clara Valley.

The Salinas River, which geologically formed the fluvial valley and generated its human history, flows to the northwest or &#x27;up&#x27; along the principal axis and the length of the valley.

The valley was named during the late 18th-century Spanish colonial Alta California period, and in Spanish &quot;Salina&quot; is the term for a salt marsh, salt lake, or salt pan. The seasonal Salinas River had brackish tule ponds in broad depressed areas, and more salinity during summer and when drought lowered flows.

The valley runs in a southeast to northwest alignment. It begins south of San Ardo, framed by the central inner California Coast Ranges, continues northwestward continuously defined on the west by the Santa Lucia Range, on the east by the Gabilan Range, to its end and the river&#x27;s mouth at the Monterey Bay.

It is also known for being the setting of the novels &quot;East of Eden&quot; and &quot;Of Mice and Men&quot;, both by John Steinbeck.

== Geography ==

The Salinas Valley runs approximately southeast from the Salinas River mouth near Castroville and Salinas towards King City and San Ardo. The valley lends its name to the geologic province in which it is located, the Salinian Block. Cities and populated places in the Salinas Valley include Bradley, Castroville, Chualar, Gonzales, Greenfield, Jolon, King City, Salinas, San Ardo, San Lucas, Soledad and Spreckels. The Salinas Valley is located in between the Gabilan and Santa Lucia mountain ranges, which border the Salinas Valley to the east and the west, respectively.

== History ==

Before colonization, the valley was inhabited by indigenous Salinans who lived by hunting and gathering and spoke the Salinan language. The Salinan people are believed to have lived south of Junipero Serra Peak, perhaps ranging from Slates Hot Springs on the coast to Soledad in the Salinas Valley and into northern San Luis Obispo County.

The Spanish colonial missions of San Miguel Arcángel, San Antonio de Padua and Nuestra Señora de la Soledad were all founded within the Salinas Valley in the late 18th century; from the last grew the city of Soledad.

The Franciscans baptized the native population at the missions. The Native Americans had no immunity to European diseases like smallpox and measles, so many died and their culture was devastated. Many of the remaining people assimilated with Spanish and Mexican ranchers in the nineteenth century.
The commercial farming sector of the Dust Bowl era forms the backdrop for several John Steinbeck stories including &quot;East of Eden&quot;, &quot;Tortilla Flat&quot;, &quot;Of Mice and Men&quot;, &quot;The Chrysanthemums&quot;, and &quot;Johnny Bear&quot;.

At a railroad crossing about one mile south of Chualar, a bus carrying Mexican migrant workers collided with a train in September 1963, killing 32 passengers and injuring 25. It was the most serious road accident in U.S. history, and helped spur abolition of the bracero program.

== Agriculture ==
Agriculture dominates the economy of the valley. Promoters call the Salinas Valley &quot;the Salad Bowl of the World&quot; for the production of lettuce, broccoli, peppers and numerous other crops. The climate and long growing season are also ideal for the flower industry and grape vineyards planted by world-famous vintners.

In particular, a large majority of the salad greens consumed in the U.S. are grown within this region. Strawberries, lettuce, tomatoes, and spinach are the dominant crops in the valley. Other crops include broccoli, cauliflower, wine grapes, artichokes, and celery. Due to the intensity of local agriculture, the area has earned itself the nickname &quot;America&#x27;s Salad Bowl.&quot; The flower industry, grown in greenhouses, is now dominated by Matsui Nursery, which has been a major philanthropic benefactor to Salinas.

Salinas Valley is also an important viticultural area. Three American Viticultural Association &quot;American Viticultural Area&quot; domains are located within Salinas Valley: the Arroyo Seco AVA, the Santa Lucia Highlands AVA, and the Monterey AVA.

Although agriculture forms an economic base, more than 100 manufacturing firms call Salinas home. Some of the largest employers in the area include: Dole Fresh Vegetable, the County of Monterey, and Salinas Valley Memorial Hospital.
== Water ==

Supplying Salinas Valley farms is an underground water supply fed, in part, by the large watershed in surrounding mountains. Two reservoirs – Nacimiento and San Antonio—store and release the water for groundwater recharge, flood control and farming. Wells access the groundwater to irrigate about of fruits and vegetables and to supply the valley cities. The Salinas River itself is a sand river, so water appears on the surface only during heavy rains or when water is released from the upstream reservoirs.

Increasing demand for water near the mouth of the valley is drawing seawater into the freshwater aquifer. The Salinas Valley Water Project, now under construction by the Monterey County Water Resources Agency, will use an inflatable dam near Salinas to capture more water during wet periods. Monterey County Water Recycling Projects, a combination of the Castroville Seawater Intrusion Project and the Salinas Valley Reclamation Project, started delivering recycled water to fields near Castroville in 1998. The project&#x27;s goal is to reduce pumping of groundwater and slow down seawater intrusion.

== Climate ==
The Salinas Valley&#x27;s weather varies from north to south. Proximity to Monterey Bay and the cool coastal waters of the Pacific cools the northern part of the valley in summer, and keeps it relatively mild in winter. The southern portion of the valley has greater extremes of temperature, hotter in summer, and colder in winter.

In summer, inland heating creates a thermal low that draws the marine layer into the valley, with fog and low clouds near Monterey Bay, sometimes extending farther down the valley.

The climate is ideal for the numerous vineyards in the Santa Lucia Highlands, promoting growth of winetasting along the River Road Wine Trail.

==Local events==
The California Rodeo Salinas, California International Airshow, the National Steinbeck Center, and the Steinbeck Festival are major attractions in Salinas.

=== 2007 &quot;Salmonella&quot; outbreak ===
On August 30, 2007, 8,000 cartons of spinach (from Metz Fresh, a King City-based grower and shipper, Salinas Valley, California) were recalled after &quot;Salmonella&quot; was discovered on routine testing. The incident led to a call from some consumer advocates and lawmakers for greater oversight in food safety, even if 90% of the suspect vegetable did not reach the shelves.

<text>Tilden is an unincorporated community, census-designated place (CDP), and the county seat of McMullen County, Texas, United States. The population was 190 at the 2020 census.

Tilden lies at the intersection of State Highways 16 and 72 in the north central part of the county. It is located roughly an hour south of San Antonio.

==History==
During the Civil War, a Home Guard post named Camp Rio Frio was built to protect the community from Apaches and bandits.

After the war, the community was called Dog Town and was reputed to be a lawless and bandit-filled place.

The first establishment was the Franklin Ranch in 1868, built by Ralph S. Franklin. Now the Lone Star Camp, it is a hunting and working ranch camp still owned by the Franklin Family.

In 1871, the community was granted a post office.

The town&#x27;s name was changed in honor of Samuel J. Tilden, the unsuccessful Democratic presidential candidate in the 1876 United States presidential election.

In 1881, Old McMullin College opened under the direction of John Van Epps Covey, and endorsed by the Baptist Church. The buildings were turned over to the Tilden School District in 1897.
==Boot Hill Cemetery==
Located in Tilden is Boot Hill Cemetery, one of the only two authentic cemeteries of its kind in the southwest. It was so named because many of those who were interred there died violently (&quot;with their boots on&quot;). Many of the early graves were those of people who were killed in accidents, murdered, or who died of cholera during an epidemic in 1869, although some were known to have died of natural causes. The cemetery was established sometime after Frio Rio came into existence in 1858. It is currently located behind the bank half a block north of the courthouse plaza on Highway 72 and half a block east of State Highway 16, across from the new sheriff&#x27;s office.

In 1877, Boot Hill Cemetery was abandoned in favor of the present Hill Top Cemetery and then neglected for more than half a century. During this time a number of the markers deteriorated, fell down, and became lost, along with the local history they contained. In 1955, when the Cenizo Garden Club was organized, its members began to clean up and restore the cemetery. They cleaned the plots, cleared out the brush, and located as many graves as possible. The grounds were enclosed by a low border of native stone and the Boot Hill Cemetery sign, a large boot made of masonry mounted on a large slab of petrified palm stump, was added to the cemetery grounds. The club was also instrumental in obtaining a historical marker, which now stands at the entrance to the cemetery.

==Demographics==
Tilden first appeared as a census designated place in the 2010 U.S. Census.

As of the 2020 United States census, there were 190 people, 72 households, and 56 families residing in the CDP.

==Education==
Public education in the community of Tilden is provided by the McMullen County Independent School District.

==Notable people==
* Lon Oden (1863–1910), was a Texas Ranger of the Old West, and a legend inside the Rangers.
* Bob Wheeler, member of Texas State Legislature from 1955 to 1961.

==Climate==
The climate in this area is characterized by hot, humid summers and generally mild to cool winters. According to the Köppen Climate Classification system, Tilden has a humid subtropical climate, abbreviated &quot;Cfa&quot; on climate maps.

<doc id="772859" wikidata="Q6016439" url="?curid=772859" title="Independent Broadcasting Authority">
<text>The Independent Broadcasting Authority (IBA) was the regulatory body in the United Kingdom for commercial television (ITV and Channel 4 and limited satellite television regulation – cable television was the responsibility of the Cable Authority) – and commercial and independent radio broadcasts. The IBA came into being when the Sound Broadcasting Act 1972 gave the Independent Television Authority responsibility for organising the new Independent Local Radio (ILR) stations. The Independent Television Commission formally replaced the IBA on 1 January 1991 in regulatory terms; however, the authority itself was not officially dissolved until 2003.

The IBA appointed and regulated a number of regional programme TV contractors and local radio contractors, and built and operated the network of transmitters distributing these programmes through its Engineering Division. It established and part-funded a National Broadcasting School to train on-air and engineering staff.

==Approach==


The IBA&#x27;s approach to regulation was more robust than that of its successors, and it assumed the ultimate role of the broadcaster (whereas today, TV licensees are termed &quot;broadcasters in their own right&quot;). The IBA took a very &quot;hands-on&quot; approach and placed the interests of the viewer before anything else. For example, if two ITV licensees wanted to merge, or another wanted to change its broadcast name, this would require approval by the IBA. This direct approach also extended to programmes; the IBA could (and did) place limits on how many soap episodes could be shown per week, if they believed programme quality would be compromised.

As well as setting guidelines on advertising content (some guidelines only, the remainder being the responsibility of the ASA), quantity and timings, the IBA also operated monitoring systems for the quality of programme content and the technical quality of programme play-out.

On 19 January 1972, the British government announced the lifting of all restrictions and limits on the number of broadcasting hours per day that both the BBC and ITV could air. Until 1972, both the BBC and ITV were limited to how many normal programming hours they could air during the course of each day – by 1971 it was limited to 8 hours per day, with exemptions for schools, adult educational, religious programming, state occasions and outdoor sporting coverage.

For ITV this meant they could start a proper daytime television schedule, allowing the smaller ITV companies to produce and sell programming to the network. The IBA ensured that along with the new daytime schedules which launched on Monday 16 October 1972 that their public service remit programming would continue after the restrictions were lifted. Schools programming were now placed in a new 2.5 hour slot each weekday from 9.30am along with the continued production of religious programming and adult education.

There were also limits on the value of prizes that could be given away – this dated from the broadcast of the UK version of &quot;Twenty-One&quot; in 1958 in which a contestant won enough money to buy both a car and a house. In 1960, two years after the quiz show scandals in America, the Independent Television Authority (predecessor of the IBA) imposed a £1,000 cap on the value of prizes which increased to £1,250 during the late 1970s with an occasional limit of £2,000 which rose to £2,500 by 1981. From 1981 to 1988, weekly winnings could average no more than £1,750. On occasion, said limit could increase to £3,500 over a course of four weeks. From 1989 to 1992, weekly winnings could not average more than £5,000 per individual contestant or £6,000 in total winnings per week. British versions of popular American quiz shows had to be adjusted – &quot;The $64,000 Question&quot; having a maximum prize initially of 64,000 sixpences (£1,600) in the late 1950s, and in the early 1990s of just £6,400. &quot;The Six Thousand Four Hundred Pound Question&quot; was only asked every other week, so as not to break the regulatory £6,000/week maximum. The Independent Television Commission abolished such limits in 1993.

Throughout its history until just before its demise, the IBA put out a short weekly programme under the title &quot;Engineering Announcements&quot;, transmitted outside normal programme hours, and not otherwise advertised. These provided valuable technical information for members of the radio and television trade. These broadcasts were shown on ITV until May 1983 after which they were shown on Channel 4 and S4C, with the final broadcast taking place on 31 July 1990.

===1980 franchise round===

Regional programming on ITV was a major concern for the IBA, particularly in the 1980 franchise round. The IBA was determined each franchise provided the best possible local service, so the South of England transmission region was split in two, with the successful applicant required to provide separate news services for the South and South East, while in the Midlands ATV&#x27;s commitment to regional output in the Midlands had been a long-running issue for the IBA; in 1980, they were allowed to keep their franchise, but with several tough conditions.

==Engineering advances==
The Experimental and Development Department, as part of the IBA&#x27;s Engineering Division, was responsible for much leading-edge research into broadcasting technology as well as being responsible for the design and manufacture of specialist equipment that could not be procured from commercial manufacturers. In particular, the IBA&#x27;s E&amp;D Department developed SABRE (Steerable Adaptable Broadcast Receiving Equipment) that enabled mainland broadcast television channels to be received for re-broadcasting in the Channel Islands. During the early 1980s, the E&amp;D Department designed and manufactured the specialised broadcast receiving and monitoring equipment used to build the national broadcast network for Channel Four. Subsequently, E&amp;D&#x27;s engineers proposed a system of analogue television encoding known as MAC (Multiplexed Analogue Component) to provide a standard for the forthcoming satellite television broadcasts that was more robust than an extension of the existing PAL system used for terrestrial broadcasts. E&amp;D&#x27;s engineers also designed and built some of the first digital audio equipment for satellite broadcasting including systems using data packets. E&amp;D&#x27;s engineers made many important contributions to digital television data-rate reduction whereby the encoding of a standard analogue PAL colour signal requiring some 130 Megabits/second has been reduced to less than 4 Megabits/second as used on current digital television broadcasting.

==Satellite broadcasting==
In the late 1980s the IBA was appointed as regulator and transmitter operator for the first DBS (direct broadcasting by satellite) service for the UK and awarded the franchise to BSB (British Satellite Broadcasting). A year before the launch of BSB, the rival Sky Television was able to launch an analogue service, and intended to overshadow BSB by leasing transponders from Société Européenne des Satellites&#x27; RCA Astro-built satellite, Astra 1A. BSB launched in early 1990 but just over six months after BSB&#x27;s launch, Sky and BSB merged.

==Succession==
The IBA was disbanded as part of the Broadcasting Act 1990, being replaced on New Year&#x27;s Day 1991 by the Independent Television Commission (ITC) (which also absorbed the Cable Authority), and the Radio Authority (RAu), which have since been merged with other regulators such as the Broadcasting Standards Commission (BSC) and Oftel (Office of Telecommunications) to form one regulator, Ofcom. All of the IBA&#x27;s engineering function, except for a limited number of quality control engineers, was transferred to a newly set-up private company, National Transcommunications Limited (NTL), which continued to run the former IBA transmitter masts. These assets are now within the portfolio operated by Arqiva. In 2008 the IBA&#x27;s extensive archive was lodged with the University of Bournemouth.

The IBA&#x27;s membership of the European Broadcasting Union was passed to United Kingdom Independent Broadcasting (UKIB).

Such was the sense of purpose and camaraderie amongst former employees of the IBA that they still meet up near Winchester for an annual reunion in late January, typically boasting an attendance of over fifty.

==Technical publications and legacy==
The engineering staff of the IBA contributed many papers to international standards groups and conferences over many years. The IBA also operated an Engineering Information service in support of the receiver industry and the general public offering information and advice about the transmitter networks and reception issues. Its lasting legacy is a set of IBA Technical Reviews published over a period of 16 years from 1972 to 1988. The complete set of these reviews, as well as some other documents and records, is available for free download.

The reviews were primarily written by the technical staff of the IBA but some articles were written by others from the Independent Television companies and by external specialists. The first volume was published in September 1972 when the Engineering Division was located in Brompton Road, London prior to its move to Crawley Court near Winchester in 1973. Other members of the Division staffed the transmitting stations and maintenance bases spread across the UK. The series ended with the 24th volume published in November 1988. One reason for the termination of the publications was the abolition of the IBA in 1990 and the subsequent privatisation of the Engineering activities as National Transcommunications Limited [NTL]; the government white paper proposing this was published in the autumn of 1988.

These reviews are valuable in recording the activities of the various departments of the division during a period of considerable change in broadcasting. IBA staff members were active not only in designing, building and operating transmitter networks they also made significant contributions to new digital broadcasting standards and their implementation. The laboratories of the IBA were in the forefront of the development of digital television technology, as can be seen in some of the reviews but, after the abolition of the IBA, NTL continued to contribute significantly to the development and implementation of the successor technology that underlies modern Freeview transmissions.

Copyright in these documents originally vested in the IBA. On its abolition, its assets were distributed between the Independent Television Commission (ITC) and NTL, each of which has subsequently been absorbed by other bodies. The ITC was absorbed by Ofcom and the original NTL has evolved into an independent company, Arqiva. The copyright is now vested in Ofcom.

<text>A solar thermal collector collects heat by absorbing sunlight. The term &quot;solar collector&quot; commonly refers to a device for solar hot water heating, but may refer to large power generating installations such as solar parabolic troughs and solar towers or non-water heating devices such as solar cookers or solar air heaters.

Solar thermal collectors are either non-concentrating or concentrating. In non-concentrating collectors, the aperture area (i.e., the area that receives the solar radiation) is roughly the same as the absorber area (i.e., the area absorbing the radiation). A common example of such a system is a metal plate that is painted a dark color to maximize the absorption of sunlight. The energy is then collected by cooling the plate with a working fluid, often water or glycol running in pipes attached to the plate.

Concentrating collectors have a much larger aperture than the absorber area. The aperture is typically in the form of a mirror that is focussed on the absorber, which in most cases are the pipes carrying the working fluid. Due to the movement of the sun during the day, concentrating collectors often require some form of solar tracking system, and are sometimes referred to &quot;active&quot; collectors for this reason.

Non-concentrating collectors are typically used in residential, industrial and commercial buildings for space heating, while concentrating collectors in concentrated solar power plants generate electricity by heating a heat-transfer fluid to drive a turbine connected to an electrical generator.

==Heating water==
Flat-plate and evacuated-tube solar collectors are mainly used to collect heat for space heating, domestic hot water, or cooling with an absorption chiller. In contrast to solar hot water panels, they use a circulating fluid to displace heat to a separated reservoir. The first solar thermal collector designed for building roofs was patented by William H. Goettl and called the &quot;Solar heat collector and radiator for building roof&quot;.

Evacuated flat-plate solar collectors are a more recent innovation and can be used for Solar Heat for Industrial Cooling (SHIC) and Solar Air Conditioning (SAC), where temperature in excess of are required. These non-concentrating collectors harvest both diffuse and direct light and can make use of steam instead of water as fluid.

===Flat plate collectors===

Flat-plate collectors are the most common solar thermal technology in Europe. They consist of an (1) enclosure containing (2) a dark-colored absorber plate with fluid circulation passageways, and (3) a transparent cover to allow transmission of solar energy into the enclosure. The sides and back of the enclosure are typically insulated to reduce heat loss to the ambient. A heat transfer fluid is circulated through the absorber&#x27;s fluid passageways to remove heat from the solar collector. The circulation fluid in tropical and sub-tropical climates is typically water. In climates where freezing is likely, a heat transfer fluid similar to an automotive antifreeze solution may be used instead of water, or in a mixture with water. If a heat transfer fluid is used, a heat exchanger is typically employed to transfer heat from the solar collector fluid to a hot water storage tank. The most common absorber design consists of copper tubing joined to a high conductivity metal sheet (copper or aluminum). A dark coating is applied to the sun-facing side of the absorber assembly to increase its absorption of solar energy. A common absorber coating is black enamel paint.

In higher performance solar collector designs, the transparent cover is tempered soda-lime glass having reduced iron oxide content same as for photovoltaic solar panels. The glass may also have a stippling pattern and one or two anti-reflective coatings to further enhance transparency. The absorber coating is typically a selective coating, where selective stands for having the special optical property to combine high absorption in the visible part of the electromagnetic spectrum coupled to low emittance in the infrared one. This creates a selective surface, which reduces black body energy emission from the absorber and improves performance. Piping can be laser or ultrasound welded to the absorber sheet to reduce damage to the selective coating, which is typically applied prior to joining to large coils in a roll-to-roll process.

Absorber piping configurations include:

*harp: traditional design with bottom pipe risers and top collection pipe, used in low pressure thermosyphon and pumped systems;
*serpentine: one continuous S-shaped pipe that maximises temperature but not total energy yield in variable flow systems, used in compact solar domestic hot water only systems (no space heating role);
* flooded: consisting of two sheets of metal molded to produce a wide circulation zone that improves heat transfer;
*boundary layer: consisting of several layers of transparent and opaque sheets that enable absorption in a boundary layer. Because the energy is absorbed in the boundary layer, heat conversion may be more efficient than for collectors where absorbed heat is conducted through a material before being accumulated in the circulating liquid.

A flat plate collector making use of a honeycomb structure to reduce heat loss also at the glass side too has also been made available commercially. Most flat plate collectors have a life expectancy of over 25 years..

===Evacuated tube collectors===


Evacuated tube collectors are the most common solar thermal technology in the world. They make use of a glass tube to surround the absorber with high vacuum and effectively resist atmospheric pressure. The vacuum that surrounds the absorber greatly reduces convection and conduction heat loss, therefore achieving greater energy conversion efficiency. The absorber can be either metallic as in the case of flat plate collectors or being a second concentric glass tube (&quot;Sydney Tube&quot;). Heat transfer fluid can flow in and out of each tube or being in contact with a heat pipe reaching inside the tube. For the latter, heat pipes transfer heat to the fluid in a heat exchanger called a &quot;manifold&quot; placed transversely with respect to the tubes. The manifold is wrapped in insulation (glass wool) and covered by a protective metal or plastic case also used for fixing to supports.

Glass-metal evacuated tubes are made with flat or curved metal absorber sheets same as those of flat plates. These sheets are joined to pipes or heat pipes to make &quot;fins&quot; and placed inside a single borosilicate glass tube. An anti-reflective coating can be deposited on the inner and outer surfaces of such tubes to improve transparency. Both selective and anti-reflective coating (inner tube surface) will not degrade until the vacuum is lost. A high vacuum-tight glass-metal seal is however required at one or both sides of each evacuated tube. This seal is cycled between ambient and fluid temperature each day of collector operation and might lead to failures in time.

Glass-glass evacuated tubes are made with two borosilicate glass tubes fused together at one or both ends (similar a vacuum bottle or dewar flask). The absorber fin is placed inside the inner tube at atmospheric pressure. Glass-glass tubes have a very reliable seal, but the two layers of glass reduce the amount of sunlight that reaches the absorber. The selective coating can be deposited on the inner borosilicate tube (high vacuum side) to avoid this, but heat has then to flow through the poorly conducting glass thickness of the inner tube in this case. Moreover, moisture may enter the non-evacuated area inside the inner tube and cause absorber corrosion in particular when made from dissimilar materials (galvanic corrosion).

A Barium flash getter pump is commonly evaporated inside the high vacuum gap in between tubes to keep the internal pressure stable through time.

The high temperatures that can occur inside evacuated tubes may require special design to prevent thermal shock and overheating. Some evacuated tube collectors work as a thermal one-way valve due to their heat pipes. This gives them an inherent maximum operating temperature that acts as a safety feature. Evacuated tubes collectors can also be provided with low concentrating reflectors at the back of the tubes realising a CPC collector.

===Comparisons of flat plate and evacuated tube collectors===
A longstanding argument exists between proponents of these two technologies. Some of this can be related to the structure of evacuated tube collectors which have a discontinuous absorbance area. An array of evacuated tubes collectors on a roof has space between the individual tubes and a vacuum gap between each tube and its absorber inside, covering only a fraction of the installation area on a roof. If evacuated tubes are compared with flat-plate collectors on the basis of the area of roof occupied (gross area), a different conclusion might be reached than if the absorber or aperture areas were compared. The recent revision of the ISO 9806 standard states that the efficiency of solar thermal collectors should be measured in terms of gross area and this might favour flat plates in respect to evacuated tube collectors in direct comparisons.


Flat-plate collectors usually lose more heat to the environment than evacuated tubes because there is no insulation at the glass side. Evacuated tube collectors intrinsically have a lower absorber to gross area ratio (typically 60–80% less) than flat plates because tubes have to be spaced apart. Although several European companies manufacture evacuated tube collectors (mainly glass-metal type), the evacuated tube market is dominated by manufacturers in China, with some companies having track records of 15–30 years or more. There is no unambiguous evidence that the two designs differ in long-term reliability. However, evacuated tube technology (especially for newer variants with glass-metal seals and heat pipes) still needs to demonstrate competitive lifetimes. The modularity of evacuated tubes can be advantageous in terms of extensibility and maintenance, for example, if the vacuum in one heat pipe tube is lost it can be easily be replaced with minimal effort.
In most climates, flat plate collectors will generally be more cost-effective than evacuated tubes. However, evacuated tube collectors are well-suited to cold ambient temperatures and work well in situations of low solar irradiance, providing heat more consistently throughout the year. Unglazed flat plate collectors are the preferred devices for heating swimming pool water. Unglazed collectors may be suitable in tropical or subtropical environments if domestic hot water needs to be heated by less than over ambient temperature. Evacuated tube collectors have less aerodynamic drag, which may allow for a simpler installation on roofs in windy locations. The gaps between the tubes may allow for snow to fall through the collector, minimizing the loss of production in some snowy conditions, though the lack of radiated heat from the tubes can also prevent effective shedding of accumulated snow. Flat plate collectors might be easier to clean. Other properties, such as appearance and ease of installation are more subjective and difficult to compare.

===Evacuated flat plate collectors===
Evacuated flat plate solar collectors provide all the advantages of both flat plate and evacuated tube collectors combined. They surround a large area metal sheet absorber with high vacuum inside a flat envelope made of glass and metal. They offer the highest energy conversion efficiency of any non-concentrating solar thermal collector, but require sophisticated technology for manufacturing. They should not be confused with flat plate collectors featuring low vacuum inside. The first collector making use of high vacuum insulation was developed at CERN, while TVP SOLAR SA of Switzerland was the first company to commercialise Solar Keymark certified collectors in 2012.

Evacuated flat plate solar collectors require both a glass-metal seal to join the glass plate to the rest of the metal envelope and an internal structure to support such plate against atmospheric pressure. The absorber has to be segmented or provided with suitable holes to accommodate such structure. Joining of all parts has to be high vacuum-tight and only materials with low vapour pressure can be used to prevent outgassing. Glass-metal seal technology can be based either on metallized glass or vitrified metal and defines the type of collector. Different from evacuated tube collectors, they make use of non-evaporable getter (NEG) pumps to keep the internal pressure stable through time. This getter pump technology has the advantage of providing some regeneration in-situ by exposure to sunlight. Evacuated flat plate solar collectors have been studied for solar air condition and compared to compact solar concentrators.

====Polymer flat plate collectors====
These collectors are an alternative to metal collectors. These may be wholly polymer, or they may include metal plates in front of freeze-tolerant water channels made of silicone rubber. Polymers are flexible and therefore freeze-tolerant and can employ plain water instead of antifreeze, so that they may be plumbed directly into existing water tanks instead of needing heat exchangers that lower efficiency. By dispensing with a heat exchanger, temperatures need not be quite so high for the circulation system to be switched on, so such direct circulation panels, whether polymer or otherwise, can be more efficient, particularly at low solar irradiance levels. Some early selectively coated polymer collectors suffered from overheating when insulated, as stagnation temperatures can exceed the polymer&#x27;s melting point. For example, the melting point of polypropylene is , while the stagnation temperature of insulated thermal collectors can exceed if control strategies are not used. For this reason, polypropylene is not often used in glazed selectively coated solar collectors. Increasingly, polymers such as high temperate silicones (which melt at over ) are being used. Some non polypropylene polymer based glazed solar collectors are matte black coated rather than selectively coated to reduce the stagnation temperature to or less.

In areas where freezing is a possibility, freeze-tolerance (the capability to freeze repeatedly without cracking) can be achieved by the use of flexible polymers. Silicone rubber pipes have been used for this purpose in UK since 1999. Conventional metal collectors are vulnerable to damage from freezing, so if they are water filled they must be carefully plumbed so they completely drain using gravity before freezing is expected so that they do not crack. Many metal collectors are installed as part of a sealed heat exchanger system. Rather than having potable water flow directly through the collectors, a mixture of water and antifreeze such as propylene glycol is used. A heat exchange fluid protects against freeze damage down to a locally determined risk temperature that depends on the proportion of propylene glycol in the mixture. The use of glycol lowers the water&#x27;s heat carrying capacity marginally, while the addition of an extra heat exchanger may lower system performance at low light levels.

A pool or unglazed collector is a simple form of flat-plate collector without a transparent cover. Typically, polypropylene or EPDM rubber or silicone rubber is used as an absorber. Used for pool heating, it can work quite well when the desired output temperature is near the ambient temperature (that is, when it is warm outside). As the ambient temperature gets cooler, these collectors become less effective.

====Bowl collectors====
A &quot;solar bowl&quot; is a type of solar thermal collector that operates similarly to a parabolic dish, but instead of using a tracking parabolic mirror with a fixed receiver, it has a fixed spherical mirror with a tracking receiver. This reduces efficiency but makes it cheaper to build and operate. Designers call it a &quot;fixed mirror distributed focus solar power system&quot;. The main reason for its development was to eliminate the cost of moving a large mirror to track the sun as with parabolic dish systems.

A fixed parabolic mirror creates a variously shaped image of the sun as it moves across the sky. Only when the mirror is pointed directly at the sun does the light focus on one point. That is why parabolic dish systems track the sun. A fixed spherical mirror focuses the light in the same place independent of the sun&#x27;s position. The light, however, is not directed to one point but is distributed on a line from the surface of the mirror to one half radius (along a line that runs through the sphere center and the sun).

As the sun moves across the sky, the aperture of any fixed collector changes. This causes changes in the amount of captured sunlight, producing what is called the &quot;sinus effect&quot; of power output. Proponents of the solar bowl design claim the reduction in overall power output compared with tracking parabolic mirrors is offset by lower system costs.

The sunlight concentrated at the focal line of a spherical reflector is collected using a tracking receiver. This receiver is pivoted around the focal line and is usually counterbalanced. The receiver may consist of pipes carrying fluid for thermal transfer or photovoltaic cells for direct conversion of light to electricity.

The solar bowl design resulted from a project of the Electrical Engineering Department of the Texas Technical University, headed by Edwin O&#x27;Hair, to develop a 5 MWe power plant. A solar bowl was built for the town of Crosbyton, Texas as a pilot facility. The bowl had a diameter of , tilted at a 15° angle to optimize the cost/yield relation (33° would have maximized yield). The rim of the hemisphere was &quot;trimmed&quot; to 60°, creating a maximum aperture of . This pilot bowl produced electricity at a rate of 10 kW peak.

A diameter Auroville solar bowl was developed from an earlier test of a bowl in 1979–1982 by the Tata Energy Research Institute. That test showed the use of the solar bowl in the production of steam for cooking. The full-scale project to build a solar bowl and kitchen ran from 1996 and was fully operational by 2001.

In locations with average available solar energy, flat plate collectors are sized approximately 1.2 to 2.4 square decimeter per liter of one day&#x27;s hot water use.

=== Applications ===
The main use of this technology is in residential buildings where the demand for hot water has a large impact on energy bills. This generally means a situation with a large family or a situation in which the hot water demand is excessive due to frequent laundry washing. Commercial applications include laundromats, car washes, military laundry facilities and eating establishments. The technology can also be used for space heating if the building is located off-grid or if utility power is subject to frequent outages. Solar water heating systems are most likely to be cost effective for facilities with water heating systems that are expensive to operate, or with operations such as laundries or kitchens that require large quantities of hot water. Unglazed liquid collectors are commonly used to heat water for swimming pools but can also be applied to large-scale water pre-heating. When loads are large relative to the available collector area, the bulk of the water heating can be done at low temperature, lower than swimming pool temperatures where unglazed collectors are well established in the marketplace as the right choice. Because these collectors need not withstand high temperatures, they can use less expensive materials such as plastic or rubber. Many unglazed collectors are made of polypropylene and must be drained fully to avoid freeze damage when air temperatures drop below on clear nights. A smaller but growing percentage of unglazed collectors are flexible meaning they can withstand water freezing solid inside their absorber. The freeze concern only needs to be the water-filled piping and collector manifolds in a hard freeze condition. Unglazed solar hot water systems should be installed to &quot;drainback&quot; to a storage tank whenever solar radiation is insufficient. There are no thermal shock concerns with unglazed systems. Commonly used in swimming pool heating since solar energy&#x27;s early beginnings, unglazed solar collectors heat swimming pool water directly without the need for antifreeze or heat exchangers. Hot water solar systems require heat exchangers due to contamination possibilities and in the case of unglazed collectors, the pressure difference between the solar working fluid (water) and the load (pressurized cold city water). Large-scale unglazed solar hot water heaters, like the one at the Minoru Aquatic Center in Richmond, BC operate at lower temperatures than evacuated tube or boxed and glazed collector systems. Although they require larger, more expensive heat exchangers, all other components including vented storage tanks and uninsulated plastic PVC piping reduce the costs of this alternative dramatically compared to the higher temperature collector types. When heating hot water, we are actually heating cold to warm and warm to hot. We can heat cold to warm as efficiently with unglazed collectors, just as we can heat warm to hot with high-temperature collectors.

==Heating air==
A simple solar air collector consists of an absorber material, sometimes having a selective surface, to capture radiation from the sun and transfers this thermal energy to air via conduction heat transfer. This heated air is then ducted to the building space or to the process area where the heated air is used for space heating or process heating needs. Functioning in a similar manner as a conventional forced-air furnace, solar-thermal-air systems provide heat by circulating air over an energy collecting surface, absorbing the sun&#x27;s thermal energy, and ducting air coming in contact with it. Simple and effective collectors can be made for a variety of air conditioning and process applications.

Many applications can utilize solar air heat technologies to reduce the carbon footprint from the use of conventional heat sources, such as fossil fuels, to create a sustainable means to produce thermal energy. Applications such as space heating, greenhouse season extension, pre-heating ventilation makeup air, or process heat can be addressed by solar air heat devices. In the field of &#x27;solar co-generation&#x27;, solar thermal technologies are paired with photovoltaics (PV) to increase the efficiency of the system by taking heat away from the PV collectors, cooling the PV panels to improve their electrical performance while simultaneously warming air for space heating.

===Space heating and ventilating===
Space heating for residential and commercial applications can be done through the use of solar air heating panels. This configuration operates by drawing air from the building envelope or from the outdoor environment and passing it through the collector where the air warms via conduction from the absorber and is then supplied to the living or working space by either passive means or with the assistance of a fan. A pioneering figure of this type of system was George Löf, who built a solar-heated air system in 1945 for a house in Boulder, Colorado. He later included a gravel bed for heat storage.

Ventilation, fresh air or makeup air is required in most commercial, industrial and institutional buildings to meet code requirements. By drawing air through a properly designed unglazed transpired air collector or an air heater, the solar heated fresh air can reduce the heating load during daytime operation. Many applications are now being installed where the transpired collector preheats the fresh air entering a heat recovery ventilator to reduce the defrost time of HRV&#x27;s. The higher your ventilation and temperature the better your payback time will be.

===Process heating===
Solar air heat is also used in process applications such as drying laundry, crops (&quot;i.e&quot;. tea, corn, coffee) and other drying applications. Air heated through a solar collector and then passed over a medium to be dried can provide an efficient means by which to reduce the moisture content of the material.

High temperature process heat can be produced by a solar furnace.

===Solar air heating collector types===
Collectors are commonly classified by their air-ducting methods as one of three types:
* through-pass collectors
* front-pass
* back pass
* combination front and back pass collectors

Collectors can also be classified by their outer surface:
* glazed
* unglazed

===Through-pass air collector===

Offering the highest efficiency of any solar technology the through-pass configuration, air ducted onto one side of the absorber passes through a perforated material and is heated from the conductive properties of the material and the convective properties of the moving air. Through-pass absorbers have the most surface area which enables relatively high conductive heat transfer rates, but significant pressure drop can require greater fan power, and deterioration of certain absorber material after many years of solar radiation exposure can additionally create problems with air quality and performance.

====Back, front, and combination passage air collector====
In back-pass, front-pass, and combination type configurations the air is directed on either the back, the front, or on both sides of the absorber to be heated from the return to the supply ducting headers. Although passing the air on both sides of the absorber will provide a greater surface area for conductive heat transfer, issues with dust (fouling) can arise from passing air on the front side of the absorber which reduces absorber efficiency by limiting the amount of sunlight received. In cold climates, air passing next to the glazing will additionally cause greater heat loss, resulting in lower overall performance of the collector.

====Glazed systems====
Glazed systems usually have a transparent top sheet and insulated side and back panels to minimize heat loss to ambient air. The absorber plates in modern panels can have absorptivity of more than 93%. Glazed Solar Collectors (recirculating types that are usually used for space heating). Air typically passes along the front or back of the absorber plate while scrubbing heat directly from it. Heated air can then be distributed directly for applications such as space heating and drying or may be stored for later use. Payback for glazed solar air heating panels can be less than 9–15 years depending on the fuel being replaced.

====Unglazed systems====
Unglazed systems, or transpired air systems have been used to heat make-up or ventilation air in commercial, industrial, agriculture and process applications. They consist of an absorber plate which air passes across or through as it scrubs heat from the absorber. Non-transparent glazing materials are less expensive and decrease expected payback periods. Transpired collectors are considered &quot;unglazed&quot; because their collector surfaces are exposed to the elements, are often not transparent and not hermetically sealed.

===Unglazed transpired solar collectors===
====Background====
The term &quot;unglazed air collector&quot; refers to a solar air heating system that consists of a metal absorber without any glass or glazing over top. The most common type of unglazed collector on the market is the transpired solar collector. The technology has been extensively monitored by these government agencies, and Natural Resources Canada developed the feasibility tool RETScreen™ to model the energy savings from transpired solar collectors. Since that time, several thousand transpired solar collector systems have been installed in a variety of commercial, industrial, institutional, agricultural, and process applications in countries around the world. This technology was originally used primarily in industrial applications such as manufacturing and assembly plants where there were high ventilation requirements, stratified ceiling heat, and often negative pressure in the building. With the increasing drive to install renewable energy systems on buildings, transpired solar collectors are now used across the entire building stock because of high energy production (up to 750 peak thermal Watts/square metre), high solar conversion (up to 90%) and lower capital costs when compared against solar photovoltaic and solar water heating.
Solar air heating is a renewable energy heating technology used to heat or condition air for buildings or process heat applications. It is typically the most cost-effective of all the solar technologies, especially in large scale applications, and it addresses the largest usage of building energy in heating climates, which is space heating and industrial process heating. They are either glazed or unglazed.

====Method of operation====
Unglazed air collectors heat ambient (outside) air instead of recirculated building air. Transpired solar collectors are usually wall-mounted to capture the lower sun angle in the winter heating months as well as sun reflection off the snow and achieve their optimum performance and return on investment when operating at flow rates of between 4 and 8 CFM per square foot (72 to 144 m3/h.m2) of collector area.

The exterior surface of a transpired solar collector consists of thousands of tiny micro-perforations that allow the boundary layer of heat to be captured and uniformly drawn into an air cavity behind the exterior panels. This heated ventilation air is drawn under negative pressure into the building&#x27;s ventilation system where it is then distributed via conventional means or using a solar ducting system.

Hot air that may enter an HVAC system connected to a transpired collector that has air outlets positioned along the top of the collector, particularly if the collector is west facing. To counter this problem, Matrix Energy has patented a transpired collector with a lower air outlet position and perforated cavity framing to perpetrate increased air turbulence behind the perforated absorber for increased performance.

This cutaway view shows the MatrixAir transpired solar collector components and air flow. The lower air inlet mitigates the intake of heated air to the HVAC system during summer operation.

The extensive monitoring by Natural Resources Canada and NREL has shown that transpired solar collector systems reduce between 10 and 50% of the conventional heating load and that RETScreen is an accurate predictor of system performance.
Transpired solar collectors act as a rainscreen and they also capture heat loss escaping from the building envelope which is collected in the collector air cavity and drawn back into the ventilation system. There is no maintenance required with solar air heating systems and the expected lifespan is over 30 years.

====Variations of transpired solar collectors====
Unglazed transpired collectors can also be roof-mounted for applications in which there is no suitable south-facing wall or for other architectural considerations. Matrix Energy Inc. has patented a roof-mounted product called the &quot;Delta&quot;, a modular, roof-mounted solar air heating system where south-, east-, or west-facing facades are simply not available.

Each ten-foot (3.05 m) module will deliver 250 CFM (425 m3/h)of preheated fresh air typically providing annual energy savings of 1100 kWh (4 GJ) annually. This unique two-stage, modular roof-mounted transpired collector operating a nearly 90% efficiency each module delivering over 118 L/s of preheated air per two square meter collector. Up to seven collectors may be connected in series in one row, with no limit to the number of rows connected in parallel along one central duct typically yielding 4 CFM of preheated air per square foot of available roof area.

Transpired collectors can be configured to heat the air twice to increase the delivered air temperature making it suitable for space heating applications as well as ventilation air heating. In a 2-stage system, the first stage is the typical unglazed transpired collector and the second stage has glazing covering the transpired collector. The glazing allows all of that heated air from the first stage to be directed through a second set of transpired collectors for a second stage of solar heating.

==Generating electricity==
Parabolic troughs, dishes and towers described in this section are used almost exclusively in solar power generating stations or for research purposes. Parabolic troughs have been used for some commercial solar air conditioning systems. Although simple, these solar concentrators are quite far from the theoretical maximum concentration. For example, the parabolic trough concentration is about 1/3 of the theoretical maximum for the same acceptance angle, that is, for the same overall tolerances for the system. Approaching the theoretical maximum may be achieved by using more elaborate concentrators based on nonimaging optics. Solar thermal collectors may also be used in conjunction with photovoltaic collectors to obtain combined heat and power.

===Parabolic trough===

This type of collector is generally used in solar power plants. A trough-shaped parabolic reflector is used to concentrate sunlight on an insulated tube (Dewar tube) or heat pipe, placed at the focal point, containing coolant which transfers heat from the collectors to the boilers in the power station.

===Parabolic dish===
With a parabolic dish collector, one or more parabolic dishes concentrate solar energy at a single focal point, similar to the way a reflecting telescope focuses starlight, or a dish antenna focuses radio waves. This geometry may be used in solar furnaces and solar power plants.

The shape of a parabola means that incoming light rays which are parallel to the dish&#x27;s axis will be reflected toward the focus, no matter where on the dish they arrive. Light from the sun arrives at the Earth&#x27;s surface almost completely parallel, and the dish is aligned with its axis pointing at the sun, allowing almost all incoming radiation to be reflected towards the focal point of the dish. Most losses in such collectors are due to imperfections in the parabolic shape and imperfect reflection.

Losses due to atmospheric scattering are generally minimal. However, on a hazy or foggy day, light is diffused in all directions through the atmosphere, which significantly reduces the efficiency of a parabolic dish. In dish stirling power plant designs, a stirling engine coupled to a dynamo is placed at the focus of the dish. This absorbs the energy focused onto it and converts it into electricity.

===Power tower===
A power tower is a large tower surrounded by tracking mirrors called heliostats. These mirrors align themselves and focus sunlight on the receiver at the top of the tower, collected heat is transferred to a power station below. This design reaches very high temperatures. High temperatures are suitable for electricity generation using conventional methods like steam turbine or a direct high-temperature chemical reaction such as liquid salt. By concentrating sunlight, current systems can get better efficiency than simple solar cells. A larger area can be covered by using relatively inexpensive mirrors rather than using expensive solar cells. Concentrated light can be redirected to a suitable location via optical fiber cable for such uses as illuminating buildings. Heat storage for power production during cloudy and overnight conditions can be accomplished, often by underground tank storage of heated fluids. Molten salts have been used to good effect. Other working fluids, such as liquid metals, have also been proposed due to their superior thermal properties.

However, concentrating systems require sun tracking to maintain sunlight focus at the collector. They are unable to provide significant power in diffused light conditions. Solar cells are able to provide some output even if the sky becomes cloudy, but power output from concentrating systems drops drastically in cloudy conditions as diffused light cannot be concentrated well.

==General principles of operation==

A solar thermal collector functions as a heat exchanger that converts solar radiation into thermal energy. It differs from a conventional heat exchanger in several aspects. The solar energy flux (irradiance) incident on the Earth&#x27;s surface has a variable and relatively low surface density, usually not exceeding 1100 W/m2 without concentration systems. Moreover, the wavelength of incident solar radiation falls between 0.3 and 3 μm, which is significantly shorter than the wavelength of radiation emitted by most radiative surfaces.

The collector absorbs the incoming solar radiation, converting it into thermal energy. This thermal energy is then transferred to a heat transfer fluid circulating within the collector. The heat transfer fluid can be air, water, oil, or a mixture including glycol (an antifreeze fluid), especially in forced circulation systems. Concentration systems may utilize phase change materials such as molten salts. The thermal energy of the heat transfer fluid can then be used directly or stored for later use. The transfer of thermal energy occurs through convection, which can be either natural or forced depending on the specific system.

<text>GMTV (an initialism for Good Morning Television), now legally known as [[ITV Breakfast|ITV Breakfast Broadcasting Limited]], was the name of the national ITV breakfast television contractor/licensee, broadcasting in the United Kingdom from 1 January 1993 to 3 September 2010. It became a wholly owned subsidiary of ITV plc in November 2009. Shortly after, ITV plc announced the programme would end. The final edition of &quot;GMTV&quot; was broadcast on 3 September 2010.

GMTV transmitted daily from 6 am with GMTV&#x27;s weekday breakfast magazine programme &quot;GMTV&quot; broadcasting until 8:25 (9:25 on Friday), followed by &quot;GMTV with Lorraine&quot; (Monday to Thursday), until the regional ITV franchises took over at 9:25 am. In later years, the switchover was practically seamless and the station was &#x27;surrounded&#x27; in the most part by ITV Network continuity on either side of transmission. Consequently, most viewers perceived GMTV simply as a programme on ITV; however, until the complete buyout by ITV plc., it was essentially an independent broadcaster with its own news-gathering operation, sales and management teams and in-house production team. GMTV also broadcast its own children&#x27;s programmes, independent from CITV until &quot;Boohbah&quot; was cross-promoted on both sides, with different credits for each.

==History==

===Creation===
GMTV won the licence for the breakfast Channel 3 franchise from 1993, outbidding the previous licence holder, TV-am, in the 1991 franchise round for £34 million. The station was backed by LWT, STV, Disney, and the Guardian Media Group. GMTV promised a &#x27;cheerful morning and with more information&#x27; - termed the &#x27;F-factor&#x27;. A new children&#x27;s news bulletin was to be broadcast at 7:20 am every morning, while at 8:50 am during the week, a new female-led format was also planned. Carlton bought a 20% stake in the consortium in November 1991. GMTV was originally intended to be called &#x27;Sunrise Television&#x27;, but as Sky News&#x27; breakfast programming also went by that name (and did so until 2019), Sky protested, resulting in the change of name.

In May 1992, GMTV was criticised after unveiling its plans for a more family orientated format with business and city news being dropped. Director of Programmes Lis Howell stated:

GMTV also turned down an offer from David Frost to continue with his Sunday morning programme, instead choosing to introduce a new leisure programme about family matters, as it believed &#x27;TV-am flung its audience away on Sundays&#x27;.

===Broadcasting===
The first edition of GMTV was broadcast on 1 January 1993, presented by Eamonn Holmes and Anne Davies. Its main weekday presenters at its launch were Fiona Armstrong and Michael Wilson (Monday to Thursday), broadcast from Studio 5 at The London Studios on the South Bank.

Within six weeks of broadcasting, the station had lost 2 million viewers. Mark Lawson of &quot;The Independent&quot; dubbed the new franchise &#x27;Grinning Morons Television&#x27;. Greg Dyke was appointed chairman of the GMTV board and tasked with overhauling the station format, which included &#x27;more popular journalism&#x27;. His role was primarily to bring new and imaginative ideas to the station without taking on full day-to-day running. Within three days, Howell had resigned; Dyke had refused to endorse any of her programming strategy for GMTV. Her replacement was Peter McHugh.

On 8 February, following continued poor ratings, Wilson had moved to present a new &#x27;news-focused&#x27; slot from 6 to 7am (which in 1994 became the &quot;Reuters News Hour&quot;). Armstrong continued to co-present with Holmes until 12 March, Armstrong was replaced by Lorraine Kelly, with her former position as presenter of the post 9am slot &quot;Top of the Morning&quot; taken up by Fern Britton.

On 19 April, GMTV was revamped, including a new set that mimicked that of TV-am. Sally Meen become the new weather presenter while Penny Smith became the main newsreader, joining from Sky News.

Within the first six months, GMTV had reported £10 million losses which was double that it initially budgeted for. In early September, GMTV approached the Independent Television Commission (ITC) regarding the possibility of decreasing its quota of news. Just two months earlier, the ITC had criticised the company for being &#x27;too entertainment-led&#x27;, expressing concerns about other programme areas. The ITC said: &#x27;They [GMTV] will have to put forward a strong case for changing the licence based on the viewers&#x27; preferences.&#x27; The request was denied, and by the end of its first year on air, the ITC had issued GMTV a formal warning for its &#x27;unsatisfactory performance&#x27;.

A final warning was given in May 1994; GMTV would face a fine of £2 million unless standards improved. The ITC acknowledged that considerable improvements had taken place up to the start of that year, but its news bulletins continued to be &#x27;unsatisfactory, and initially too short to cover depth or authority&#x27;, adding: &#x27;its current affairs and children&#x27;s material did not meet the aspirations... in terms of quality or production.&#x27; As part of the package to rectify the issues, American children&#x27;s television series &quot;Barney &amp; Friends&quot; was introduced, in addition to the &quot;Reuters News Hour&quot; and an upmarket Sunday morning programme. By 1994, GMTV had achieved high enough standards to avoid the fine and for the first time, had made a profit.

In July 1994, Anthea Turner joined GMTV to present - along with Mr. Motivator - the summer holiday feature &quot;Fun in the Sun&quot;, before being paired up with Holmes to present the main programme shortly afterwards. Turner left the station on 24 December 1996, after a dramatic falling out between the pair, which finally resulted in Holmes publicly calling her &#x27;Princess Tippy Toes&#x27;. However, management denied she was &#x27;squeezed out&#x27;, with Turner claiming she had left on her own accord. Fiona Phillips took over her role on 6 January 1997.

In 1998, GMTV returned into the red, with losses of £12 million and a turnover of £80 million In November of that year, GMTV finally received a windfall: the ITC reduced the amount the station had to pay to the treasury from £50 million to £20 million - the most dramatic reduction of all the licenses. The ITC believed this would allow GMTV the money to invest in more programming.

GMTV continued to strengthen its output, receiving further praise from the ITC in its Annual Performance Review of 1999: &#x27;The overall programme quality improved...with more feature items and greater breadth of coverage, better journalistic and technical resources.&#x27; This led to increased audience share for GMTV among adult viewers; the weekend output for children was also strengthened. The ITC praised GMTV&#x27;s greater emphasis on overseas coverage and access to key figures in the news, particularly for live interviews.

Social action programming was particularly successful. There were signs of improvement in the information content of the magazine programme for older children, Diggit (previously criticised by the ITC). The ITC proposed improvements in two areas to be made priorities for the year ahead: &#x27;... In Sunday programming for adults, where there is scope for better background and analysis to key political stories alongside the major interviews, and in information content in programming for school age children.&#x27;

===2000s===
During 1999, the STV Group held talks into buying out the other shareholders in GMTV, with Disney believed to be keen on the idea. By September, an agreement had been reached to acquire Guardian Media Group&#x27;s 15% stake for £20 million, but both Carlton and Granada objected to the deal. Guardian Media Group concluded in selling off its 15% stake in GMTV for £18 million in January 2000, with all three companies receiving 5% - allowing the four remaining stakeholders to have an equal 25% stake in the company.

In October 2003, STV made public its interest in acquiring Carlton and Granada&#x27;s stakes in GMTV. Andrew Flanagan, chief executive, was quoted as saying: &#x27;We would be interested in buying GMTV. You need a trigger to try to do something and that&#x27;s what we have tried to engineer.&#x27; STV believed having a controlling stake in GMTV would allow an effective command against the newly formed ITV sales department. In September 2004, ITV plc purchased STV Group&#x27;s 25% in the company for £31 million&lt;ref name=&quot;http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2004/may/10/smg.citynews&quot;&gt;ITV buys GMTV stake from SMG Chris Tryhorn Media Guardian, 10 May 2004&lt;/ref&gt; after being given the go ahead from the Office of Fair Trading - despite advertisers&#x27; fears it could give ITV influence over pricing. SMG said: &#x27;[We] are pulling out of GMTV because it did not want to hold a minority interest in someone else&#x27;s media business.&#x27;

In 2005, Holmes left the station. It was later exposed he was deeply unhappy with the &#x27;dumbing down and commercialisation&#x27;, which resulted in him hating his bosses.

In April 2007, BBC One&#x27;s programme &quot;Panorama&quot; made claims that Opera - a company dealing with GMTV&#x27;s phone-in competitions - were finalising shortlists of potential winners &#x27;long before&#x27; lines closed, which resulted in viewers wasting an estimated £10 million a year since April 2003 on entering premium rate phone competitions. Paul Corley, managing director of GMTV, said: &#x27;I&#x27;d just like to apologise for everything that&#x27;s gone on. GMTV had trusted Opera, but, the fact is it appears two or three people at this telecoms company were taking it upon themselves to do this even without the knowledge of the management. This contradicted claims made by &quot;Panorama&quot; that in 2003, sales director Mark Nuttall at Opera had discovered the situation and sent an e-mail to staff, saying: &#x27;Make sure they never find out you are picking the winners early.&#x27; Two senior executives resigned: Controller of Enterprises Kate Fleming, and Managing Director Paul Corley.

On 24 September that year, Opera was fined £250,000, while GMTV was fined £2 million by Ofcom, who stated: &#x27;the breaches constituted a substantial breakdown in the fundamental relationship of trust between a public service broadcaster and its viewers. The breaches were extremely serious as they involved longstanding and systematic failures in the conduct of broadcast competitions.&#x27; GMTV pledged to refund a total of £35 million to all viewers affected.

A month later, the Serious Fraud Office took the decision to review the evidence from Ofcom into the phone-in scandal. An SFO spokeswoman said: &#x27;Following media reports and some complaints received from the general public about GMTV&#x27;s use of premium rate telephone services, we are in touch with Ofcom although no SFO investigation is under way...furthermore, the SFO will await the outcome of Ofcom&#x27;s investigation into ITV&#x27;s use of premium rate telephone services as highlighted in the Deloitte report.&#x27; On 10 March 2008, the Serious Fraud Office decided not to investigate the phone-in scandal, stating it did not meet its criteria for an investigation.

===2008–09===
A major overhaul of GMTV output took place during the summer of 2008 - resulting in part from the loss of viewers to new competition from other digital channels, and to counter criticism that its output had become too lightweight. Red Bee Media was brought in as a consultant, with a view to refreshing the station&#x27;s on-screen look, which had changed very little since 1993. ITV and Disney agreed a £4.5 million investment to modernise the production of the programme, including new equipment such as Avid editing suites. This then led to the relaunch of GMTV on 5 January 2009, introducing Emma Crosby and Kirsty McCabe, who themselves replaced Fiona Phillips and Andrea McLean.

In July 2008, it was announced that McLean would quit working on GMTV to focus on her role on &quot;Loose Women&quot;, to share the permanent host job with Jackie Brambles. On 31 December that year, McLean left GMTV after 11 years as a weather presenter.

Phillips left GMTV on 18 December that same year, after 12 years as its main presenter. She told viewers that leaving was &#x27;one of the hardest decisions I&#x27;ve ever made&#x27;.

===ITV plc ownership===
ITV plc attempted to buy out Disney&#x27;s stake in GMTV, following its gaining of 75% control, in order to secure 24-hours control of Channel 3 in England and Wales; it eventually paid £18m for the remaining 25% on 25 November 2009.

As a result, many changes were made shortly after:

*The editor of GMTV, Martin Frizell, was sacked in December 2009 with Sue Walton temporarily replacing him.
*On 4 March 2010, it was announced that presenter and newsreader Penny Smith was leaving GMTV, with presenter John Stapleton being redeployed as special correspondent. Smith presented her final broadcast on 4 June 2010.
*Also announced on that same day was the decision of political correspondent Gloria De Piero to quit GMTV in February 2010, to stand as a Labour Party parliamentary candidate.
*On 6 March, GMTV Kids presenters Jamie Rickers and Anna Williamson were made redundant. They appeared for the last time on the programme in May 2010, meaning no presenter linked between programmes in the &quot;Toonattik&quot; strand.
*In early April, there was speculation that Eamonn Holmes and Kate Thornton were in the running to present the new revamp programme. A source said: &#x27;With Eamonn and Kate, it will almost be like a pilot. If it works, they will be licking their lips. It has not been signed but all sides are actively considering it. There is still some work to do but it is looking very likely.&#x27;
*On 19 April, it was announced BBC presenter Adrian Chiles was quitting his roles with the corporation, to join ITV plc on a six-year contract, co-presenting on GMTV and casting doubt over the futures of incumbent male hosts Andrew Castle and Ben Shephard.
*On 21 April, it was confirmed that Ben Shephard was leaving GMTV after 10 years, after earlier telling management he would not be renewing his contract.
*On 7 May, it was announced that former &quot;The One Show&quot; editor Ian Rumsey would take editorial control of the programme from June, with Paul Connolly as his deputy, taking over the temporary placement of Sue Walton, as she moved to tackling the move of &quot;GMTV with Lorraine&quot; to a new stand-alone programme.
*On 10 June, it was confirmed that Andrew Castle would leave GMTV after 10 years. On the same day, ITV plc. announced that they would be dropping the GMTV brand name from the breakfast franchise in favour of a relaunched format later in the year.
*On 20 June, ITV plc. announced that Christine Bleakley would join Chiles as lead female host, after signing an exclusive three-year deal to present on the breakfast slot, and other prime-time entertainment shows. The pair had previously worked together on the BBC&#x27;s &quot;The One Show.&quot;
*As of July, GMTV came from Studio 3 at TLS (where &quot;Loose Women&quot; came from); this move was because Al Jazeera Sports, which originally came from Studio 7, had to move to Studio 5, so that Studio 7 could be made ready for &quot;Daybreak&quot;. (This was also where the final programme was broadcast from.)
*On 9 July it was confirmed that the new ITV plc. breakfast programme, from 6 September, would be named &quot;Daybreak&quot; and that &quot;GMTV with Lorraine&quot; was set to become a standalone programme with the title &quot;Lorraine&quot;, while &#x27;GMTV Limited&#x27; was rebranded ITV Breakfast Limited.
*On 20 July, it was confirmed that Kate Garraway would move from a presenting position on &quot;GMTV&quot; to the role of entertainment editor on &quot;Daybreak&quot;. Other members of the team, moving over from &quot;GMTV&quot;, were confirmed as John Stapleton continuing in the role of special correspondent, Dan Lobb as sports editor, Dr. Hilary Jones becoming health editor, and Richard Gaisford continuing in the role of chief correspondent.
*On 20 July, Richard Arnold and Carla Romano announced they would be leaving GMTV, after 10 years with the company, to pursue their careers elsewhere.
*On 1 August, Emma Crosby confirmed that she would not be part of the new programme.
*&quot;GMTV with Lorraine&quot; aired for the last time, with Myleene Klass presenting on 2 September, whilst GMTV came to an end with Andrew Castle and Emma Crosby presenting the next day.

<text>The Center for Studies on New Religions (), otherwise abbreviated as CESNUR, is a nonprofit organization based in Turin, Italy that focuses on the academic study of new religious movements and opposes the anti-cult movement. It was established in 1988 by Massimo Introvigne, Jean-François Mayer, and Ernesto Zucchini.

CESNUR has been described as &quot;the highest profile lobbying and information group for controversial religions&quot;. CESNUR&#x27;s scholars have defended such diverse groups as the Unification Church, the Church of Scientology, and Shincheonji Church of Jesus, accused of having aided the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic in South Korea.

CESNUR describes itself as an independent scholarly organization, but the organization has met with criticism for alleged personal and financial ties to the groups it studies; anthropologist Richard Singelenberg questioned in 1997 whether CESNUR is &quot;too friendly and does not make enough critical comments about new religious movements and sects&quot;. According to sociologist Stephen A. Kent, &quot;many scholars, however, see both CESNUR and INFORM in a favourable light, and they share its criticism of the &#x27;sect-monitors&#x27; in France, Germany, and Belgium.&quot;

CESNUR publishes &quot;The Journal of CESNUR&quot;, focusing on the academic study of new religious movements, and &quot;Bitter Winter&quot;, a daily magazine on religious issues and human rights in China.

==History==

CESNUR was founded in 1988 at a seminar organized by Massimo Introvigne, Jean-François Mayer, and Ernesto Zucchini in Italy. Introvigne is an Italian intellectual-property attorney and sociology lecturer who also serves as the group&#x27;s director. A member of the Catholic conservative organization Alleanza Cattolica since 1972, Introvigne served as that group&#x27;s vice president until 2016. Mayer is a Swiss historian specialized in new religious movements. He was for a time a lecturer at University of Fribourg and in 2012, he was appointed by the Canton of Fribourg to prepare a report on the situation of religious communities there. Zucchini is a Catholic priest, who became in 2009 professor of theology in the Theological School of the Diocese of Massa Carrara-Pontremoli in Italy and published and lectured about the Italian mystic Maria Valtorta and about the Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses.

Giuseppe Casale, a Catholic historian and Archbishop of the Archdiocese of Foggia-Bovino, was appointed as the first president of CESNUR. Later, Luigi Berzano became CESNUR&#x27;s president. Reviewing the proceedings of one of the first CESNUR conferences, French sociologist Jean Séguy wrote in 1988 that most participants were Catholic and presented the traditional Catholic view of phenomena such as Spiritualism and the New Age.

Other members of CESNUR&#x27;s board include Luigi Berzano, Gianni Ambrosio, Reender Kranenborg, Eileen Barker and J. Gordon Melton. Berzano, who later became CESNUR&#x27;s president, is a professor of sociology at the University of Turin. Ambrosio is an Italian sociologist who became in 2007 bishop of the Catholic Diocese of Piacenza-Bobbio. Kranenborg is a Dutch Reformed theologian. Barker is a sociologist who wrote &quot;The Making of a Moonie: Choice or Brainwashing?&quot; (1984) and formed the Information Network Focus on Religious Movements (INFORM) in 1988. Melton is Distinguished Professor of American Religious History at Baylor University in Waco, Texas.

In 1995 the French Parliamentary Commission on Cults in France, after the events of the Order of the Solar Temple, published a critical report on cults. This was followed by similar reports by other governments. CESNUR claimed these texts relied excessively on information supplied by the anti-cult movement and criticized them publicly, particularly through a book called &quot;Pour en finir avec les sectes&quot;. Canadian scholar Susan Jean Palmer wrote that the title, translated as &quot;To Put an End to the Sects&quot;, had a double meaning and was &quot;deliberately misleading&quot;, as, rather than to sects of cults, the authors wanted to put an end to governmental criticism of them. French sociologists Jean-Louis Schlegel and Nathalie Luca reviewed the book critically, noting that while the authors were right in criticizing some mistakes of the Parliamentary report, CESNUR had moved with the volume from a scholarly to a militant advocacy position and to a one-sided defense of cults. According to Palmer, the book upset the French authorities so much so that one of its co-authors, French historian Antoine Faivre, was placed by the police under temporary arrest (garde à vue), accused of having disclosed confidential details about the persons interviewed by the Parliamentary Commission, although he was detained for a few hours only and a judge later dropped the charges.

== Organization ==
According to its official website, CESNUR &quot;is a network of independent but related organizations of scholars in various countries, devoted to promote scholarly research in the field of new religious consciousness, to spread reliable and responsible information, and to expose the very real problems associated with some movements, while at the same time defending everywhere the principles of religious liberty.&quot; The Italian authorities recognized CESNUR as a public non-profit organization in 1996 and were contributors to CESNUR projects. Other sources of income include book royalties and member contributions.

While established by a group composed mostly of Catholic scholars, CESNUR is not affiliated with any religious group or denomination and has from the outset included scholars of various religious persuasions. CESNUR is critical of concepts like mind control, thought reform and brainwashing, asserting that they lack scientific and scholarly support and are mainly based on anecdotal evidence.

In a 2018 history of the academic study of new religious movements, American scholar W. Michael Ashcraft described CESNUR as &quot;the largest outlet currently supporting research on NRMs.&quot; In 2018, &quot;The Korea Times&quot; described CESNUR as &quot;the largest international association of scholars specializing in the study of new religious movements.&quot;

===Activities and publications===
Since 2017, CESNUR has published &quot;The Journal of CESNUR&quot;, a periodic about new religious movements. CESNUR sponsors yearly conferences in the field of new religions. The 2019 conference at the University of Turin included over 200 attendees. The journal&#x27;s articles are typically sourced from CESNUR&#x27;s annual conferences. The journal is open access, and Introvigne is the founder and lead editor. Benjamin E. Zeller noted in 2020 that, while too recently founded to give a proper analysis, the journal&#x27;s articles tended to disproportionately focus on East Asia. 

Introvigne has spoken before the Commission on Security and Cooperation in Europe and the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe. He testified on behalf of Scientologists in a criminal trial in Lyon. In 1995, Introvigne argued that Order of the Solar Temple members who died by mass suicide had acted on their own initiative as opposed to being victims of the leader&#x27;s manipulations. In 1997, Melton appeared as an expert witness on behalf of the Singapore branch of the International Churches of Christ, arguing that the group was not a &quot;cult&quot;. The testimony garnered attention for Melton&#x27;s admission on cross-examination that he had publicly made similar claims about Peoples Temple, responsible for 918 deaths in Jonestown, Guyana.

In 2001 and 2006 CESNUR published two editions of its encyclopedia of religions in Italy.

====&quot;Bitter Winter&quot;====
&quot;Bitter Winter&quot; was launched in May 2018 as an online magazine which covers religious freedom and human rights in China. According to the magazine it is supported by volunteer contributions and is published daily in five languages.

Some of the magazine&#x27;s correspondents were arrested in late 2018 by the authorities for their work documenting and publicizing antireligious campaigns of the Chinese Communist Party. The United States Department of State in the chapter on China of its 2019 Human Rights Report noted that, among 45 &quot;Bitter Winter&quot; contributors the magazine reported had been arrested in 2018, in 2019, 4 of the 22 detained in Xinjiang were released, and among the 23 detained in Henan, Fujian, Zhejiang and Shanxi, &quot;several had been released after indoctrination training,&quot; while &quot;online media reported that police tortured&quot; those arrested in Fujian.

The same United States Department of State quoted repeatedly &quot;Bitter Winter&quot; as &quot;an online magazine on religious liberty and human rights in China&quot; in the China section of its 2018 International Religious Freedom Report. The American evangelical magazine &quot;World&quot; called &quot;Bitter Winter&quot; &quot;a thorn in the side&quot; of the Chinese Communist Party, and reported that in a secret document &quot;the Chinese government has called &quot;Bitter Winter&quot; an &#x27;overseas hostile website&#x27; [境外敌对网站] and instructed its intelligence agency, the Ministry of State Security, to investigate the group.&quot;

==Criticism==
In a 1996 piece in &quot;Charlie Hebdo&quot;, French essayist Renaud Marhic accused CESNUR of being &quot;a scientific screen used to relay [Introvigne&#x27;s] theses to the complacent media&quot;. Scholars Stephen A. Kent and Raffaella Di Marzio have argued that CESNUR&#x27;s representation of the brainwashing controversy is one-sided, polemical and sometimes without scholarly value, while anthropologist Richard Singelenberg questioned in 1997 whether CESNUR is &quot;too friendly and does not make enough critical comments about new religious movements and sects&quot;. Kent further observed: &quot;Many German and French officials working on issues related to religious &#x27;sects&#x27; and human rights do not see CESNUR and Introvigne as neutral parties in the ongoing debates... Consequently, other people and organizations have damaged their reputations (rightly or wrongly) among these officials by associating too closely with CESNUR&quot;. Later on, Raffaella Di Marzio changed her mind and became a collaborator of CESNUR. According to Kent, &quot;many scholars, however, see both CESNUR and INFORM in a favourable light, and they share its criticism of the &#x27;sect-monitors&#x27; in France, Germany, and Belgium.&quot;

CESNUR again met with controversy when one of the scheduled speakers at the 1997 CESNUR conference, who was to present scholarship on the religious group New Acropolis, was discovered to be a member of the very group she purported to study. Michiel Louter writing for Dutch magazine &quot;De Groene Amsterdammer&quot; opined: &quot;It is difficult to believe that CESNUR-director Introvigne was not up-to-date on her membership in the group&quot;. The participation of the New Acropolis speaker to the conference was canceled after the connection was publicly reported by Dutch publication &quot;Trouw&quot;.

In 2001, French journalist accused CESNUR of &quot;systematic interventions in favor of sects brought to justice&quot;, naming Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses, Scientology, Order of the Solar Temple, the Unification Church and Aum Shinrikyo and opined that &quot;all the sects know they can count on CESNUR&quot;.

===Aum Shinrikyo sarin gas attack of 1995===
In the aftermath of the 1995 sarin gas attack on the Tokyo subway, CESNUR board member J. Gordon Melton and occasional CESNUR conference speaker James R. Lewis flew to Japan at the expense of Aum Shinrikyo; they then held press conferences in Japan stating their belief that the group did not have the ability to produce sarin and was being scapegoated. Melton later revised his judgment. A paper mentioning the investigation was presented at the 1995 CESNUR conference.

Though CESNUR director Massimo Introvigne defended what he termed the &quot;much maligned&quot; investigation, others in the field felt that the scholars&#x27; defense of Aum Shinrikyo led to a crisis of confidence in religious scholarship when Aum&#x27;s culpability was proven. Scholar Ian Reader disputed Introvigne&#x27;s defense, writing &quot;the case in hand certainly shows that some scholars are capable of saying what those who call on them want them to say, even when the evidence points the other way&quot;.

===Eastern Lightning and the murder of Wu Shuoyan===
In 2018, &quot;Bitter Winter&quot; was criticized for its sympathetic coverage of Eastern Lightning, a group regarded as a cult in China. Introvigne discussed in &quot;Bitter Winter&quot; the 2014 murder of Wu Shuoyan, attributed by Chinese authorities to Eastern Lightning. He supported the position first presented in articles of the Chinese daily &quot;The Beijing News&quot; in 2014, then advocated in 2015 by Australian scholar Emily Dunn, that the perpetrators were not members of Eastern Lightning at the time of the murder. This position was described in 2020 by reporter Donald Kirk as common among scholars. However, while Dunn wrote that the two leaders of the group that committed the murder &quot;started out as members of Eastern Lightning (in 1998 and 2007 respectively), [but] they had outgrown it&quot; and were no longer part of the sect in 2014. Introvigne, based on a different interpretation of the same Chinese sources quoted by Dunn, argued, both in &quot;Bitter Winter&quot; and in his 2020 book &quot;Inside The Church of Almighty God&quot;, that they had never been members of Eastern Lightning.

Mainstream reporting held that in 2002, members of Eastern Lightning kidnapped 34 members of the China Gospel Fellowship and held them captive for two months, with the aim of coercing them to join Eastern Lighting. Introvigne, however, suggested in 2018 that China Gospel Fellowship invented the story of the kidnapping as justification for the fact that many of its members, including national leaders, had converted to Eastern Lightning. In his 2020 book, he adopted a more nuanced position, suggesting that China Gospel Fellowship members described as &quot;kidnapping&quot; what was in fact &quot;deception,&quot; as they were invited, and went voluntarily, to training sessions without being told that they were organized by Eastern Lightning.

In 2019, CESNUR&#x27;s &quot;Bitter Winter&quot; co-hosted in Seoul with Human Rights Without Frontiers a conference supporting the right of asylum of Eastern Lightning and Uyghur refugees from China living in South Korea. Members of Eastern Lightning and the Uyghur diaspora also spoke in the conference.

===Shincheonji and spread of COVID-19===
On November 29, 2019, CESNUR co-organized a seminar in Seoul claiming that thousands of members of Shincheonji, a group many in South Korea regard as a cult, had been subject to forcible deprogramming. Introvigne was among the speakers.

Regarding the Shincheonji organization&#x27;s association with a coronavirus outbreak in 2020, CESNUR and Human Rights Without Frontiers released a joint white paper claiming that, although Shincheonji made &quot;mistakes&quot; in its management of the crisis, the organization had also been discriminated against because of its unpopular status. The founder of Shincheonji had been prosecuted for his alleged responsibility in the spreading of the Covid, and has been acquitted on January 13, 2021.

<doc id="772871" wikidata="Q1154059" url="?curid=772871" title="Kirby's Adventure">
<text>Kirby&#x27;s Adventure is a 1993 action-platform game developed by HAL Laboratory and published by Nintendo for the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES). It is the second game in the &quot;Kirby&quot; series after &quot;Kirby&#x27;s Dream Land&quot; (1992) on the Game Boy and the first to include the Copy Ability, which allows the main character Kirby to gain new powers by eating certain enemies. The game centers around Kirby traveling across Dream Land to repair the Star Rod after King Dedede breaks it apart and gives the pieces to his minions.

Masahiro Sakurai returned as director after serving the same role for &quot;Kirby&#x27;s Dream Land&quot;. He conceived the copy ability to add more challenge and replay value after the last game received criticism for its simplicity. Because the NES hardware had greater graphical power than the Game Boy and programmers were skilled with the now antiquated hardware, HAL Laboratory was able to create impressive visuals. &quot;Kirby&#x27;s Adventure&quot; is the first game to depict Kirby in color. Sakurai had always planned him to be pink, much to the surprise of other staff.

&quot;Kirby&#x27;s Adventure&quot; was well received and commended for its tight controls, level variety, and the new copy ability. It was remade in 2002 for the Game Boy Advance with enhanced graphics and multiplayer support, titled Kirby: Nightmare in Dream Land. The original NES version was re-released later via Nintendo&#x27;s Virtual Console digital distribution services, the Wii compilation disc &quot;Kirby&#x27;s Dream Collection&quot;, the NES Classic Edition, Nintendo Switch Online, and with stereoscopic 3D for the 3D Classics product line for the Nintendo 3DS. In retrospect, journalists have ranked it among the best NES games.

==Gameplay==

Like its predecessor &quot;Kirby&#x27;s Dream Land&quot; (1992), &quot;Kirby&#x27;s Adventure&quot; is a 2D side-scrolling platform game. In the game&#x27;s scenario, an evil entity named Nightmare corrupts the Fountain of Dreams, which provides restful sleep to the residents of Dream Land. King Dedede steals the Star Rod that powers the fountain and gives pieces of it to his friends in an effort to stop Nightmare. Kirby, the player character of the single-player game, mistakenly believes that Dedede stole the rod for evil and sets out to reunite the pieces. When Kirby defeats Dedede and returns the rod to the fountain, Nightmare goes into outer space to spread bad dreams, but Kirby follows him and uses the rod&#x27;s power to defeat him.

Kirby retains his abilities from &quot;Kirby&#x27;s Dream Land&quot;: he can walk left or right, crouch, and jump. To attack, Kirby inhales enemies or objects and spits them out as star-shaped bullets. He can also fly by inflating himself; while flying, Kirby cannot attack or use his other abilities, but he can exhale at any time, releasing a puff of air that cancels his flight and can be used to damage enemies or destroy blocks. New moves include the abilities to run at a fast pace and to perform a sliding kick. A major aspect of the game is Kirby&#x27;s copy abilities. By inhaling and swallowing certain enemies, Kirby will obtain powers based on the special ability the enemy possessed. Copy abilities allow Kirby to access new areas and experience levels in different ways. Certain copy abilities can only be used a limited number of times. Kirby can discard his ability at any time or lose it when he is hit by an enemy; he must reacquire it quickly or it will disappear.

The game consists of forty-one levels across seven worlds, each containing a lobby with doors leading to four to five regular levels, a boss fight, and a Warp Star door which enables Kirby to travel back to previous worlds. Most worlds also contain minigames which allow Kirby to gain extra lives, museums where Kirby may easily gain certain powers, and arenas where Kirby must battle with a miniboss to win health and allow him to copy the boss&#x27;s special ability. The game automatically saves the player&#x27;s progress after each level. The objective of each main level is simply to reach its end. If Kirby touches an enemy or a dangerous object, he will lose a section of his health meter. If all of his health is lost or he falls off the bottom of the screen, the player loses a life. Losing all lives results in a game over. Kirby can touch or eat food items to replenish health or gain temporary invulnerability.

==Development==

&quot;Kirby&#x27;s Adventure&quot; was developed by HAL Laboratory in Kōfu as a Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) successor to their 1992 Game Boy game &quot;Kirby&#x27;s Dream Land&quot;. Masahiro Sakurai returned as director and designer, with Takashi Saitou assisting designing. Hiroaki Suga was lead programmer, while Satoru Iwata, Shigeru Miyamoto, and Takao Shimizu were the producers; Iwata also provided programming assistance. According to Sakurai, development began in 1992, after he was asked to port &quot;Kirby&#x27;s Dream Land&quot; to the NES. Since the Game Boy title was aimed at beginners and the NES player base was more experienced, Sakurai chose to create a new game instead. As a result, little of &quot;Kirby&#x27;s Adventure&quot; is based on &quot;Kirby&#x27;s Dream Land&quot;: &quot;Even though we could use the same pixel art for Kirby, when it came to capacity and what was possible, all that expanded greatly with NES.&quot;

HAL Laboratory wanted to expand Kirby&#x27;s existing repertoire of moves. &quot;Kirby&#x27;s Dream Land&quot; was designed for beginner players, but as a result received criticism from more experienced players looking for a challenge. With &quot;Kirby&#x27;s Adventure&quot;, Sakurai wanted to retain simple gameplay, but improve it so skilled players would enjoy it. This led to the conception of the Copy Abilities, which the team hoped would allow players to experiment and improve the replay value. HAL Laboratory created over 40 Copy Abilities, after which they selected their favorites to include in the final game. They also added minigames because they feared that Kirby&#x27;s expanded set of moves would give players the impression that &quot;Kirby&#x27;s Adventure&quot; was a difficult game. They were designed to be simpler and easier than the main game. Kirby was also given the ability to run faster and perform a slide attack to increase the game&#x27;s pace.

Programmers were skilled with squeezing power out of the ten-year-old NES hardware by 1993. Kirby&#x27;s spit attack was made stronger if multiple enemies or objects were inhaled, something they had wanted to implement in &quot;Kirby&#x27;s Dream Land&quot;. &quot;Kirby&#x27;s Adventure&quot; is the first game to depict Kirby in color. Sakurai had always envisioned Kirby as pink, but the Game Boy&#x27;s monochrome visuals rendered him white in &quot;Kirby&#x27;s Dream Land&quot;. The other staff were shocked when they learned Kirby was pink. Kirby&#x27;s sprite was also made larger after players complained he was too small in his Game Boy debut. While backgrounds are typically designed by someone experienced in game mapping, for &quot;Kirby&#x27;s Adventure&quot;, HAL Laboratory had an artist draw pictures of the backgrounds, which were then handed to the mapper to work into the game. According to Saitou, they were supposed to be &quot;pretty enough just to look at on their own.&quot; &quot;Kirby&#x27;s Adventure&quot; also marks the first appearance of Meta Knight, who appears as an unnamed boss in one of the game&#x27;s levels.

The game was published by Nintendo in Japan on March 23, 1993, in North America in May 1993, and in Europe on September 12, 1993. It was released late in the NES&#x27;s lifecycle, ten years after the system launched in Japan. By 1993, most gamers had already moved on to playing primarily on 16-bit systems. However, the game topped the &quot;Famitsu&quot; sales chart in Japan in May 1993.

==Rereleases==

In October 2002, Nintendo released &quot;Kirby: Nightmare in Dream Land&quot;, an enhanced remake of &quot;Kirby&#x27;s Adventure&quot; for the Game Boy Advance (GBA). The core gameplay and level design were left mostly unchanged; minor tweaks include hidden entrances being easier to find and boss fights being more difficult. However, all the graphics and sound effects were redone from scratch to take advantage of the GBA&#x27;s more powerful hardware. &quot;Nightmare in Dream Land&quot; adds more gameplay modes, including three new minigames and a cooperative multiplayer mode that supports up to four players. It also features &quot;Meta Knightmare&quot;, an unlockable mode in which the player controls Meta Knight. According to &quot;Next Generation&quot;, 970,000 copies were sold worth $29 million in revenue. The game was sold out in three weeks according to 4Kids Entertainment.

A port of &quot;Kirby&#x27;s Adventure&quot; was released as a downloadable game for the Nintendo 3DS&#x27;s eShop in the west on November 17, 2011, and in Japan on April 25, 2012. As a part of the 3D Classics line of rereleases, it has the ability to use the 3DS&#x27;s stereoscopic 3D functionality. The game is otherwise unchanged.

&quot;Kirby&#x27;s Adventure&quot; is available in emulated form through the Virtual Console digital distribution service. It was released on the Wii Virtual Console worldwide in February 2007 and on the Wii U Virtual Console in April 2013. The GBA version was released on the Wii U Virtual Console in 2014. The NES version is also included in &quot;Kirby&#x27;s Dream Collection&quot; (2012), a compilation of &quot;Kirby&quot; video games that commemorates the series&#x27; 20th anniversary, and on the NES Classic Edition (2016) dedicated console. It was added to the library of NES games available through the Nintendo Switch Online subscription service on February 13, 2019.

==Reception==
Most aspects of &quot;Kirby&#x27;s Adventure&quot; were well received in contemporary reviews, and critics agreed that it was an improvement over &quot;Kirby&#x27;s Dream Land&quot;. Some of the most common highlights by reviewers were the game&#x27;s innovative copy ability and unique enemy designs, the size and variety of the levels, the tight controls, and the quality and cuteness of the graphics and animation. &quot;Nintendo Power&quot; thought the game was more difficult than its cute theme may lead gamers to believe. &quot;Joypad&quot; believed the game was aimed towards younger children and provided two review scores for gamers over and under 12 years old, with the score for children being higher. They compared the game to &quot;Tiny Toon Adventures&quot; (1991) by Konami, writing that the graphics and sound were better in &quot;Tiny Toon Adventures&quot;, but &quot;Kirby&#x27;s Adventure&quot; had better animation and was more original. Some reviewers complained that the character sprites, especially Kirby&#x27;s, were too small. &quot;GamePro&quot; gave &quot;Kirby&#x27;s Adventure&quot; the 1993 NES Game of the Year award.

Retrospective reviews for the game&#x27;s rerelease on the Wii Virtual Console were likewise positive. &quot;IGN&quot; called it one of the best NES games, and one of the system&#x27;s greatest visual and auditory technical achievements. &quot;Eurogamer&quot; believed it to be one of the best &quot;Kirby&quot; games, and agreed with &quot;IGN&quot;&#x27;s sentiments, writing, &quot;Kirby&#x27;s first and only NES outing is undeniably charming and, with its parallax scrolling and colourful characters, really showcases just how much juice developers were squeezing from the tiny system towards the end of its life.&quot; &quot;Racketboy&quot; notes the advanced visuals: &quot;...the rich colors do not attempt to emulate 16 bit, but instead try to make 8 bit as beautiful as possible.&quot; &quot;Nintendo Life&quot; and &quot;GameSpot&quot; agreed that the game pushed the NES&#x27;s technical capabilities. The game&#x27;s other elements were commended as they were in 1993, including their originality, cuteness, and stage variety. &quot;GameSpot&quot; wrote that &quot;Kirby&#x27;s Adventure&quot; had stood the test of time well, although they felt the game was somewhat short and easy. Others also criticized the game for its length and lack of challenge. For the 3D Classics rerelease, the 3D effect added into the game was seen as underwhelming compared to games like &quot;Excitebike&quot; and &quot;TwinBee&quot; which took greater advantage of parallax and depth effects.

===&quot;Nightmare in Dream Land&quot;===

The new graphics made for the GBA remake were well received. &quot;GameSpot&quot; highlighted the multiple layers of scrolling, transparency effects, and other visual flair as an improvement over the original. However, they did not think the game was visually up to par with other GBA games such as &quot;Yoshi&#x27;s Island&quot; and &quot;&quot;. The new minigames and multiplayer modes were also praised for adding new replay value. Since the main gameplay and level design was borrowed from the original, it was generally commended but with some criticism again directed toward its short length and easiness. &quot;GameSpy&quot; wrote: &quot;the simplicity means you can enjoy it as a light snack instead of a main course such as &quot;Metroid Fusion&quot; or &quot;Castlevania: Harmony of Dissonance.&quot;&quot; They thought the game would be best enjoyed by children watching the anime airing on television at the time, &quot;&quot;. &quot;GameSpot&quot; agreed, explaining the game was not as deep as &quot;Metroid Fusion&quot; or &quot;Yoshi&#x27;s Island&quot;, but was suited for &quot;younger players or the young at heart.&quot; &quot;Eurogamer&quot; found it difficult to recommend the game at full price because it was only a remake and also a short game.

==Legacy==
Game journalists have consistently listed &quot;Kirby&#x27;s Adventure&quot; among the best NES games. &quot;Official Nintendo Magazine&quot; listed it as the 69th best game on a Nintendo console in 2009, and &quot;IGN&quot; ranked it as 84th on a similar list of best &quot;Nintendo games&quot;. In August 2006, &quot;Next Generation&quot; ranked &quot;Nightmare in Dream Land&quot; as the 17th best handheld video game of the 2000s.

The Copy Ability introduced in &quot;Kirby&#x27;s Adventure&quot; would go on to become a staple mechanic in Kirby&#x27;s move repertoire. The game was also the first &quot;Kirby&quot; game to introduce unlockables for finding certain items hidden throughout the levels, which again became a recurring theme in later games. Meta Knight became a recurring playable character in the &quot;Super Smash Bros.&quot; series, starting with &quot;Super Smash Bros. Brawl&quot; in 2008.

The multiplayer mode in the remake &quot;Nightmare in Dream Land&quot; would reprise the yellow coloration used for a second-player Kirby in &quot;Kirby&#x27;s Dream Course&quot; (1994), itself the initial coloration for Kirby proposed by Shigeru Miyamoto before the original &quot;Kirby&#x27;s Adventure&quot;″s release. In subsequent games, a yellow color palette would become a recurring colorization for multiplayer Kirbys in the &quot;Kirby&quot; and &quot;Super Smash Bros.&quot; series, often as the default color for the second player.

<doc id="772876" wikidata="Q133482" url="?curid=772876" title="Visual Concepts">
<text>Visual Concepts Entertainment is an American video game developer based in Novato, California. Founded in May 1988, the company is best known for developing sports games in the &quot;2K&quot; franchise, most recently &quot;NBA 2K&quot; and &quot;WWE 2K&quot;, and previously &quot;NFL 2K&quot;. Visual Concepts was acquired by Sega in May 1999 and sold to Take-Two Interactive in January 2005. The acquisition of the company led Take-Two Interactive to open their 2K label which Visual Concepts became part of, on the day following the acquisition. As of December 2018, the company employs more than 350 people.

== History ==

Visual Concepts was founded in 1988 by programmer Scott Patterson and brothers Greg and Jeff Thomas, and was originally based in a small office above a bank in Novato, California. On January 25, 1995, Electronic Arts announced that they had acquired a stake in the company. In September 1997, Sega announced their intentions to acquire the company; the deal was closed on May 18, 1999, and Visual Concepts switched ownership for an undisclosed sum.

Following a June 2004 deal between Sega and Take-Two Interactive, wherein the two would co-publish and distribute titles in Visual Concepts&#x27; ESPN-based game series, rumors started spreading in December 2004, which suggested that Take-Two Interactive was planning to acquire Visual Concepts from Sega. On January 24, 2005, Take-Two Interactive announced to have completed a transaction of to Sega for the acquisition of Visual Concepts, its subsidiary Kush Games, and the intellectual property to the &quot;2K&quot; franchise. The publisher&#x27;s 2006 Form 10-K filing later showed that a total of had been paid to Sega for the acquisition of Visual Concepts and affiliated properties by January 2006. On January 25, 2005, the day following the acquisition, Take-Two Interactive announced their new publishing label, 2K, which would henceforth manage Visual Concepts and Kush Games.

A March 2009 research study on Metacritic scores, conducted by GameQuarry, ranked Visual Concepts as the number one &quot;most consistent&quot; video game developer on the review aggregator website, with 50 out of their 72 games at the time having received an aggregated review score of 80/100 or higher. In August 2010, Visual Concepts laid off 30 employees due to &quot;the need for resource alignment and better efficiency&quot;. In December 2018, at The Game Awards 2018, Greg Thomas was honored with the &quot;Industry Icon&quot; award for his 30-year services with Visual Concepts.

2K acquired HookBang&#x27;s game division, which had worked with Visual Concepts on the &quot;NBA 2K&quot; games previously, in March 2021. The division was rebranded as Visual Concepts Austin to continue to support Visual Concepts. In February 2024, an unknown number of employees at Visual Concepts Austin were affected by layoffs.

<doc id="772878" wikidata="Q910914" url="?curid=772878" title="Tablet weaving">
<text>Tablet weaving (often card weaving in the United States) is a weaving technique where &quot;tablets&quot; or &quot;cards&quot; are used to create the shed through which the weft is passed. As the materials and tools are relatively cheap and easy to obtain, tablet weaving is popular with hobbyist weavers. Most tablet weavers produce narrow work such as belts, straps, or garment trims.

== History ==
Tablet weaving dates back at least to the 8th century BCE in early Iron Age Europe where it is found in areas employing the warp-weighted loom. Historically the technique served several purposes: to create starting and/or selvedge bands for larger textiles such as those produced on the warp-weighted loom; to weave decorative bands onto existing textiles; and to create freestanding narrow work.

Early examples have been found at Hochdorf, Germany, and Apremont, Haute-Saône, France, as well as in Italy, Greece, and Austria. Elaborate tablet-woven bands are found in many high status Iron Age and medieval graves of Europe as well as in the Roman period in the Near East. They are presumed to have been standard trim for garments among various European peoples, including the Vikings. Many museum examples exist of such bands used on ecclesiastical textiles or as the foundation for elaborate belts in the European Middle Ages. In the 17th century, tablet weaving was also used to produce some monumental silk hangings in Ethiopia.

Tablet weaving is often erroneously believed to date back to pharaonic Egypt. This theory was advanced early in the 20th century based on an elaborate woven belt of uncertain provenance, often called the Girdle of Rameses, as it bore an inked cartouche of Rameses III. Arnold van Gennep and G. Jéquier published a book in 1916, , predicated on the assumption that the ancient Egyptians were familiar with tablet weaving. Scholars argued spiritedly about the production method of the belt for decades. Many popular books on tablet weaving promoted the Egyptian origin theory until, in an appendix to his book &quot;The Techniques of Tablet Weaving&quot;, Peter Collingwood proved by structural analysis that the linen belt could not have been woven on tablets.

== Tools for tablet weaving ==

The tablets used in weaving are typically shaped as regular polygons, with holes near each vertex and possibly at the center, as well. The number of holes in the tablets used is a limiting factor on the complexity of the pattern woven. The corners of the tablets are typically rounded to prevent catching as they are rotated during weaving.

In the past, weavers made tablets from bark, wood, bone, horn, stone, leather, metal or a variety of other materials. Modern cards are frequently made from cardboard. Some weavers even drill holes in a set of playing cards. This is an easy way to get customized tablets or large numbers of inexpensive tablets.

The tablets are usually marked with colors or stripes so that their facings and orientations can be easily noticed.

== Procedure ==

The fundamental principle is to turn the tablets to lift selected sets of threads in the warp. The tablets may be turned in one direction continually as a pack, turned individually to create patterns, or turned some number of times &quot;forward&quot; and the same number &quot;back&quot;. Twisting the tablets in only one direction can create a ribbon that curls in the direction of the twist, though there are ways to thread the tablets that mitigate this issue.
Some weavers prefer the backstrap method of weaving, where one end of the warp was tucked into (or wrapped around) the weaver&#x27;s belt and the other is looped over a toe/tied to a pole or furniture. Other weavers prefer to use &quot;Inkle&quot; looms, which are a more modern invention and act as both loom and warping board for the project. Some traditional weavers weave between two poles and wrap the weft around the poles (similar to the Oseberg loom found in Norway dating from the 9th century). Commercial &quot;tablet weaving looms&quot; adapt this idea and are convenient because they make it easy to put the work down.
Some patterns require that weavers thread each card individually. Others allow &quot;continuous warping&quot;, which puts the threads through the holes of an entire deck – the four threads in the deck of cards are wrapped around two stationary objects, dropping one card each time around the fixed points. Cards are threaded in either S (in through the right of the card) or Z (in through the left of the card) directions, which alters the pattern created by turning the cards.

A shuttle about long is placed in the shed to beat the previous weft, then carry the next weft into the shed. Shuttles made for tablet weaving have tapered edges to beat down the weft. Simple flat wooden or plastic shuttles work well for weaving any kind yarn from wool to cotton to silk.
Patterns are made by placing different-colored yarns in different holes, then turning individual cards until the desired colors of the weft are on top. After that, a simple pattern, like a stripe, small diamond or check, can be repeated just by turning the deck of tablets.

Tablet weaving is especially freeing, because any pattern can be created by turning individual tablets. This is in contrast to normal looms, in which the complexity of the pattern is limited by the number of shafts available to lift threads, and the threading of the heddles.

Tablet weaving can also be used to weave tubes or double weave. The tablets are made to have four levels in the warp, and then two sheds are beat and wefted, one in the top pair of warps, and the other in the bottom pair, before turning the deck. Since groups of tablets can be turned separately, the length, width and joining of the tubes can be controlled by the weaver.

<text>The Illawarra Mercury is a daily newspaper serving the Illawarra region of New South Wales, Australia. It has been published since 1855, making it one of Australia&#x27;s oldest newspapers and the second-oldest regional newspaper in New South Wales. It has been published daily since December 1949, and has had no local daily competition since the 1960s. It has strong links to the Illawarra community.

Under editor Peter Cullen, the &quot;Mercury&quot; was jocularly known as &quot;The Mockery&quot; among Illawarra residents for its poor copy editing, resulting in frequent typographical errors. As a result, it became a running gag on the ABC&#x27;s &quot;Media Watch&quot; in the period when Stuart Littlemore hosted the programme. The &quot;Mercury&quot; is published in the standard Australian tabloid format, with each page having an approximate size of A3.

The &quot;Mercury&quot; has had several Walkley Award winners on staff, most recently journalists Mario Christodoulou (2008), Nicole Hasham and Laurel-Lee Roderick (2010), and photographer Sylvia Liber (2014).

The paper has often supported Labor at state and federal elections, but backed the Liberal Party for the 2011 New South Wales state election. It has links to neither party. Alistair Langford-Wilson became editor in April 2012.

The &quot;Illawarra Mercury&quot; is owned by Australian Community Media, though the newspaper is editorially independent. Fairfax Media became a major shareholder in 1962 only to later acquire the paper in 1969. Fairfax merged with Nine Entertainment in 2018.

== History ==
The &quot;Illawarra Mercury&quot; was established by Thomas Garrett and W. F. Cahill in 1855. The first issue was printed as 8 large folio pages and was circulated on 8 October 1855. Initially the newspaper was published once a week then increased to twice weekly in 1929. During the 1930s the depression had a significant effect on the region and forced the newspaper to revert to a weekly publication. It wasn’t until 1950 that the newspaper increased its publication to a daily paper; this led to the newspaper changing its name to the &quot;Illawarra Daily Mercury&quot;, which lasted until 1954. In 1979 and after having dropped the &quot;Daily&quot; from its title the &quot;Illawarra Mercury&quot; officially became a metropolitan daily newspaper.

One of the significant events of the newspaper includes the amalgamation with the &quot;Bulli Times&quot; and &quot;Port Kembla Pilot&quot; in February 1949. The paper also later merged with the &quot;South Coast Times&quot; in 1968.

In 1981 the &quot;Illawarra Mercury&quot; acquired a new offset press that allowed the newspaper to be brought to life in full colour. As technology emerged an order was placed in 1988 for a new electronic colour scanner which would enhance the newspaper&#x27;s production and appearance. It was the first newspaper in Australia to use the state-of-the-art Itek 210S scanner.

In 2012 Fairfax relocated the editorial production, involving subeditors and page layout, of &quot;Illawarra Mercury&quot; to New Zealand.

== Readership ==
Despite being marketed towards residents of the Illawarra and surrounding regions, it can be purchased throughout the Sydney metropolitan region where it is popular due to the high quality of its horse-racing and sport coverage.

== Awards ==
In 2005 The &quot;Mercury&quot; was named Newspaper of the year 20,000-50,000 circ. by the Pacific Area Newspaper Publisher&#x27;s association PANPA.

In 2004 the &quot;Illawarra Mercury&quot; won the Walkley Award for Investigative Journalism and the Pacific Area Newspapers Publishers’ Association Marketing prize.

Its editorial cartoonist, Vince O&#x27;Farrell, has won international awards for his work - his cartoon immediately after the 11 September 2001 attacks depicting tears rolling down the Statue of Liberty&#x27;s cheeks is one example. O&#x27;Farrell is a six-time winner of the Rotary cartoons award.

The &quot;Illawarra Mercury&quot; in 1972 won two of the State’s leading newspaper awards – a W. A. Richard award for technical excellence in newspaper production and a &quot;certificate of merit in journalism&quot;.

== Archives ==
The newspaper is available on microfilm at Wollongong City Library and the State Library of New South Wales. It has been digitised by the National Library of Australia under its Newspaper Digitisation Program.

== Digitisation ==
The issues of this paper from 1856 to 1954 have been digitised as part of the Australian Newspapers Digitisation Program project of the National Library of Australia.

<doc id="772884" wikidata="Q3717474" url="?curid=772884" title="NFL 2K">
<text>NFL 2K is an American football video game series developed by Visual Concepts and published by Sega. The series was originally exclusive to Sega&#x27;s Dreamcast video game console due to the absence of EA Sports&#x27;s Madden NFL series on the system. As the foremost &quot;2K&quot; title, it marked the beginning of a running athletics series that eventually led to the spinning off of 2K&#x27;s sports publishing business under the name of 2K Sports. Upon the Dreamcast&#x27;s discontinuation, the series continued to be published for other sixth generation game systems and became the chief competitor of the &quot;Madden&quot; series.

After the competitively priced &quot;NFL 2K5&quot; significantly reduced sales of that year&#x27;s &quot;Madden&quot; release, EA signed an exclusivity deal with the NFL that made &quot;Madden NFL&quot; the only series allowed to use NFL team and player names.

In 2020, 2K announced the NFL 2K series will return in 2021 as an arcade video game. In May 2021 2K announced that the game had been delayed until March 2022 and was delayed multiple times after that.

In April 2024, 2K Games released a mobile video game titled &quot;NFL 2K Playmakers&quot;, a card game similar to Madden NFL&#x27;s Ultimate Team mode.

==Games==
===NFL 2K===

The series was introduced by Sega to address EA Sports&#x27;s decision not to publish games, including the &quot;Madden NFL&quot; series, for the Dreamcast. The first installment, &quot;NFL 2K&quot;, was released exclusively for the system, in time for its September 9, 1999 launch in North America. All 31 NFL teams were included in the game (including the returning Browns) along with alumni teams, and All-Pro teams for the AFC, NFC, and NFL. The game received positive reception upon its release, with praises for its visuals, presentation, and overall gameplay.

===NFL 2K1===

A sequel, &quot;NFL 2K1&quot;, was released for the Dreamcast on September 7, 2000, to critical acclaim. Improvements over its predecessor include a significant amount of new player animations, larger play-books, improved AI, and tweaks to the running game, the passing game, and defense. &quot;2K1&quot; also introduced a multi-season franchise mode and online play.

===NFL 2K2===

With the demise of the Dreamcast, the &quot;NFL 2K&quot; series was re-positioned as the main multi-platform rival to the &quot;Madden NFL&quot; series. &quot;NFL 2K2&quot;, the third installment, was released on September 19, 2001, for the Dreamcast. PlayStation 2 and Xbox versions of the game were later released with enhanced graphics. Reception for the game was positive, with critics noting improved AI, enhancements to the passing game, and new player animations. However, the franchise mode was criticized for lacking depth, as it remained nearly unchanged from &quot;2K1&quot;. The Houston Texans were included in the game, featuring stock players as the team did not yet have a real-life roster.

=== NFL 2K3 ===

&quot;NFL 2K3&quot; was released for PlayStation 2, Xbox, and GameCube in August 2002. The game featured licensed ESPN-styled presentation, with halftime reports, player awards, and post-game and weekly wrap-ups. ESPN&#x27;s Dan Patrick is featured in the opening intro. Franchise mode was greatly expanded upon in &quot;2K3&quot;, and featured interactive menus along with much greater depth. Historic teams were included for the first time, and current real-life coaches were introduced to the series (along with the ability to create ones). &quot;2K3&quot; was the first game in the series to include Xbox Live capabilities.

===ESPN NFL Football===

&quot;ESPN NFL Football&quot; was released in September 2003 for PlayStation 2 and Xbox. It is the only game in the series not featuring &quot;2K&quot; in the title; &quot;2K4&quot; was instead relegated to the bottom corner of the box art. The game would expand upon the series&#x27; ESPN license, with players receiving reports and highlights from ESPN&#x27;s Chris Berman and Suzy Kolber. New features were added such as first-person football and &quot;The Crib&quot;, which serves as the player&#x27;s own digital apartment and trophy room.

===ESPN NFL 2K5===

With the cancellation of &quot;NFL GameDay&quot; (989 Sports) on PlayStation 2 and the &quot;NFL Fever&quot; (Microsoft Game Studios) franchise, the series truly became &quot;Madden NFL&quot;&#x27;s primary competition. In what Grantland later called &quot;one of the greatest, most insidious guerrilla-warfare moves in the history of video game competition&quot;, Sega released &quot;ESPN NFL 2K5&quot; in July 2004 for $19.99, giving the game significant market share versus the $49.95 &quot;Madden NFL&quot;. One EA developer recalled that Sega&#x27;s aggressive pricing &quot;scared the hell out of us&quot;; EA later reduced &quot;Madden NFL&quot;″s price to $29.95. In December 2004, however, EA signed an exclusive agreement with the NFL for an undisclosed amount of money, making &quot;Madden NFL&quot; the only series allowed to use NFL team and player names. Comparatively, the NFL signed a similar six year exclusivity deal with Visa Inc. worth $400 million in January 2004. EA also signed an agreement with ESPN to become the only licensee of ESPN&#x27;s brand in sports games on all platforms. This was an immense blow to Sega&#x27;s franchise in their MLB, NBA, and NHL series. In 2020, EA signed an extension with the NFL, giving them sole licensing rights through the 2025 season.

==Voice commentary==
The play-by-play and color commentary in each game is done by the fictional sportscasters Dan Stevens (Terry McGovern) and Peter O&#x27;Keefe (Jay Styne). Fictional reporter Michelle Westphal (Marcia Perry) provides occasional sideline reports from &quot;NFL 2K&quot; through &quot;NFL 2K3&quot;, while ESPN&#x27;s real-life Suzy Kolber provides reports in &quot;ESPN NFL Football&quot; and &quot;ESPN NFL 2K5&quot;. Pre-game and post-game shows, halftime reports, and weekly SportsCenter wrap-ups are hosted by ESPN&#x27;s Chris Berman in the latter two games.

Terry McGovern and Jay Styne returned as Dan Stevens and Peter O&#x27;Keefe in All-Pro Football 2K8.

<text>Maryland County is a county in the southeastern portion of Liberia. One of 15 counties that comprise the first-level of administrative division in the nation, it has two districts. Harper serves as the capital with the area of the county measuring . As of the 2022 Census, it had a population of 172,202, making it the ninth most populous county in Liberia.

Named after the State of Maryland in the United States, it was an independent country as the Republic of Maryland from 1854 until it joined Liberia in 1857. The most populous city in the county is Pleebo, with 22,963 residents, while Maryland&#x27;s County Superintendent is Nazarine Tubman. The county is bordered by Grand Kru County to the west and River Gee County to the north. The eastern part of Maryland borders the nation of Ivory Coast (&quot;Côte d&#x27;Ivoire&quot;), separated by the Cavalla River.

==History==
Maryland was first established as a colony of the Maryland State Colonization Society in 1834, but was not granted independence until 1854. The Maryland Society had played a pivotal role in the formation of the larger American Colonization Society years before. Following a referendum in 1853, the colony declared its independence from the Colonization Society across the Atlantic Ocean and formed the Republic of Maryland. It held the land along the south coast between the Grand Cess and San Pedro Rivers.

In 1856, the Republic of Maryland requested military aid from nearby Liberia in a war with the Grebo and Kru peoples who were resisting the Maryland settlers&#x27; efforts to control their trade in slaves. Liberian President Joseph Jenkins Roberts assisted the Marylanders, and a joint military campaign resulted in victory. Following a referendum in February 1857 the Republic of Maryland joined Liberia as Maryland County on 6 April 1857. As of May 2004, a DRC census estimated the county&#x27;s population to be 107,100.

During the 1970s, Maryland County was terrorized by ritual killings. The crimes have been regarded as &quot;Liberia&#x27;s most notorious ritual killing case&quot; due to the number of murders, the involvement of high-ranking government officials, and their subsequent public executions.

==Districts==
Districts of Maryland County include (2008 population):

* Harper District
* Barrobo District
* Pleebo/Sodeken District
* Karluway District

==Details==

Farming is the main economic activity in Maryland County, accounting for the employment of approximately 60% of residents. Rice and cassava are the main crops raised in the county. It is roughly estimated that about 98% of the county&#x27;s population is Christian, 1% Muslim, and 1% Animist.

The flag of Maryland County consists of a drawing of a tree and a lighthouse on a cliff with a small Liberian flag in the upper left corner.

In 2007, WBAL-TV in Baltimore produced a documentary special titled &quot;Africa&#x27;s Maryland&quot;, which focused on this region and its cultural roots in the American state of Maryland. After the documentary aired, the state signed a sister state agreement with Bong and Maryland counties.

<doc id="772891" wikidata="Q352441" url="?curid=772891" title="Gioachino Greco">
<text>Gioachino Greco ( – ), surnamed Cusentino and more frequently &quot;il Calabrese&quot;, was an Italian chess player and writer. He recorded some of the earliest chess games known in their entirety. His games, which never indicated players, were quite possibly constructs, but served as examples of brilliant combinations.

Greco was very likely the strongest player of his time, having played (and defeated) the best players of Rome, Paris, London, and Madrid. Greco&#x27;s writing was in the form of manuscripts for his patrons, in which he outlined the rules of chess, gave playing advice, and presented instructive games. These manuscripts were later published to a wide audience and became massively influential after his death.

== Name ==
The name &quot;Greco&quot; is often assumed to be indicative of a Greek heritage. Indeed, Calabria, the region in which Greco was born, has a long history of Greek immigration and use of Greek as the vernacular. One prominent writer, Willard Fiske, even suggests (in &quot;The Book of the First American Chess Congress&quot;, 1859) that Greco was born in Morea, Greece, before moving to Calabria. Fiske gives no specific evidence for this claim, however; neither do other writers claiming that in this case &quot;Greco&quot; signified &quot;Greek&quot;. The origin of &quot;Greco&quot; is therefore largely speculative.

Greco&#x27;s other names have more concrete origins. &quot;Cusentino&quot; is known from the Corsini manuscript, and means that he was born near Cosenza. &quot;il Calabrese&quot;, literally &quot;the Calabrian&quot;, meant that Greco was from the Calabria region.

== Life ==
Little is known about the life of Greco. The most reliable information about his life comes from his manuscripts. He was born around 1600 in Celico, Italy. Greco apparently showed an early aptitude for chess, leaving home uneducated and at a young age to make a living abroad. By 1620 Greco had become experienced enough to write his earliest dated manuscript, &quot;Trattato Del Nobilissimo Gioco De Scacchi&quot;..., copies of which were given to his patrons in Rome.

Greco is said to have traveled to Paris, although this visit is conspicuously unattested by existing manuscripts. There he continued to find great success. His victories over the strongest French players – among them the Duc de Nemours, M. Arnault le Carabin, and M. Chaumont de la Salle – granted him both fame and riches. By 1622 Greco was travelling to England with a large sum of money; in Paris he had gained the equivalent of 5,000 crowns.

Greco was apparently waylaid during this journey, however, resulting in the loss of his newfound wealth. Undeterred, he continued to London and played the English chess elite. During his stay in London, Greco began recording entire chess games rather than single instructive positions, as had been the usual manner.

Greco returned to Paris in 1624 and began rewriting his collection of manuscripts. It is unclear whether he actually played these games – to modern eyes, his opponents&#x27; play seems dubious at best. The games&#x27; provenance is perhaps inessential; having composed them, Greco was &quot;certainly capable of playing them&quot; on a board.

Not one to remain in one place for long, Greco left Paris for the court of Philip IV in Spain. Greco managed to defeat all his opponents there, as well. By this point Greco had shown himself to be the greatest player in Europe with victories over the champions of Rome, Paris, London, and Madrid.

Having conquered the Old World, Greco traveled to the New. Greco is said to have succumbed to disease in the West Indies soon after arriving. The exact date of his death is unknown, but most sources have him dead by 1634. His chess earnings were given to the Jesuits.

== Legacy ==
Greco was a remarkable chess player who lived during the era between Ruy López de Segura and François-André Danican Philidor. At that early date, no great corpus of chess knowledge had yet been amassed. It is for this reason that Greco&#x27;s games should be understood as those of a brilliant inventor and pioneer rather than as guides to sound play. They are also valuable examples of the Italian Romantic school of chess, in which and are eschewed in favour of aggressive attacks on the opponent&#x27;s king. Greco paved the way for many of the attacking legends of the Romantic era, such as Philidor, Adolf Anderssen, and Paul Morphy.

Mikhail Botvinnik considered Greco to be the first professional chess player. Other chess writers from the early period of modern chess had professional occupations, except Paolo Boi, who was wealthy through inheritance, and Giulio Cesare Polerio, who was a servant to a wealthy family. Greco, however, relied on chess to make a living.

Greco&#x27;s innovation to record entire games is perhaps his greatest legacy. Although his manuscripts were initially kept privately by his patrons, they would eventually become public; in 1656, years after his death, one of Greco&#x27;s now-lost manuscripts was adapted as &quot;The Royall Game of Chesse-Play&quot; by Francis Beale in London. Beale&#x27;s book—and others like it—helped Greco&#x27;s work reach a much larger audience than had his predecessors&#x27;. In particular, &quot;Le Jeu Des Eschets&quot;, published in Paris 1669 became the principal source for the later English editions by William Lewis (1819) and Louis Hoffmann (1900).

Games (as published by Beale) were not described in notation; rather, the movement of each piece was described in English, for example:

&lt;poem style=&quot;width:280px;&quot;&gt;
&quot;The Fooles Mate&quot;.
Black Kings Bishops pawne one house.
White Kings pawne one house.
Black kings knights pawne two houses
White Queen gives Mate at the contrary kings Rookes fourth house.
&lt;/poem&gt;

in which &quot;house&quot; refers to a square on the chessboard.

In addition to the games (&quot;Gambetts&quot;) listed in his manuals, Greco often gave general advice to his readers and an overview of the rules of chess (&quot;The Lawes of Chesse&quot;). These ranged from the familiar (&quot;If you touch your man you must play it, and if you set it downe any where you must let it stand&quot;) to the obsolete (&quot;If at first you misplace your men, and play two or three draughts, it lieth in your adversaries choice whether you shall play out the game or begin it again.&quot;). Greco also describes the necessity of announcing check to one&#x27;s opponent (still common in informal play but not in competition) and the disgrace of what he calls a &quot;blind Mate&quot; – a checkmate given but not noticed.

The &quot;Lawes of Chesse&quot; were also not entirely standardized in Greco&#x27;s time; for that reason, the rules as published by Beale would have been meant for a specific population. For example, Greco specifies that when castling in France, &quot;the Rook... goeth into the Kings house&quot;. In other countries the rules for castling were different. Modern castling, which Greco also describes, is sometimes called &quot;alla Calabrese&quot; in Greco&#x27;s honour.

=== Openings named for Greco ===

* Greco Defence: 1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Qf6 – A popular opening choice by novice players, it has also been used by players who, according to International Master Gary Lane, &quot;should know better&quot;. Also known as the McConnell Defense.
* Greco Countergambit: 1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 f5 – An aggressive but rather dubious choice for Black which often leads to wild and tricky positions. FIDE Master Dennis Monokroussos even goes so far as to describe it as &quot;possibly the worst opening in chess.&quot; Also known as the Latvian Gambit.
* Calabrese Countergambit: 1.e4 e5 2.Bc4 f5
* Bishop&#x27;s Opening, Greco Gambit: 1.e4 e5 2.Bc4 Nf6 3.f4

* Queen&#x27;s Gambit Accepted, Central Variation, Greco Variation: 1.d4 d5 2.c4 dxc4 3.e4 b5

=== Greco&#x27;s mate ===
Greco&#x27;s mate is a checkmate pattern that occurs when a bishop (or queen) blocks the escape of a king on the back rank (or file), while a rook (or queen) delivers checkmate.

=== Example games ===
As one of the players during the age of the Italian Romantic style, Greco studied the Italian game (1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bc4), among other openings. His games are regarded as classics of early chess literature and are sometimes still taught to beginners. Greco himself presented his games as between &quot;White&quot; and &quot;Black&quot;; the modern convention is to name the participants Greco and , for the Latin &quot;nomen nescio&quot;.

Among his games were the first smothered mate:

=== Compositions ===
Although Greco is known for recording entire games, he also included a number of chess problems in his manuscripts. Many of these were either copied directly, or adapted with modifications, from the works of previous authors.

This puzzle uses the theme of the wrong rook pawn, and is probably an original composition by Greco:

And here is one inspired by an earlier composition by Salvio:

== Quotes about Greco ==
* &quot;Greco was the Morphy of the seventeenth century, and it may safely be said that in brilliancy and fertility of invention he has never been surpassed.&quot; (J.A. Leon, 1900)
* &quot;He [Greco] was the most productive and inventive chess author of the classical era.&quot; (Peter J. Monté, 2014)
* &quot;The games of Calabrisian Greco can be considered as a great education for beginners and intermediate players; even the most dedicated connoisseur of the board wants to find in its many unknown twists and elegant ways of playing, which enrich or round off his experiences.&quot; (translated from German, Max Lange)
* &quot;At the start of your career, you make a move against me, because of your proud step all my plans fail, as you approach I see all my defenses crumble, my champions fall while I resist in vain, my King Knight Rook and Queen don&#x27;t measure up to your pawns.&quot; (translated from French, unknown)
== Manuscripts ==
What follows is a list of manuscripts written by Greco, as given by Murray. There is a large amount of overlap among the contents of many of the works; many also have identical (or near-identical) titles. Efforts to list and date Greco&#x27;s manuscripts have been made by Antonius van der Linde (1874), J. A. Leon (1900), Murray (1913), J. G. White (1919), Alessandro Sanvito (2005), and Peter J. Monté (2014).

All Greco&#x27;s manuscripts had Italian text, though some were given English titles. The title pages or first pages were the work of calligraphers, while the text was in Greco&#x27;s own hand. Furthermore, some works survive only as later copies or translations, and therefore only their translated titles are known.

<text>Samuel Phillips Lee (February 13, 1812 – June 5, 1897) was an officer of the United States Navy. In the American Civil War, he took part in the New Orleans campaign before commanding the North Atlantic Blockading Squadron, covering the coastlines and inland waters of Virginia and North Carolina, and finally the Mississippi River Squadron. As a cousin of Robert E. Lee, his refusal to join the Confederates&#x27; side by remaining loyal to the U.S. demonstrated how the war had divided families. Lee married Elizabeth Blair the daughter of Francis P. Blair Sr., and their house in Washington is now the president&#x27;s official guest house.

==Early life and education==
Lee was born on February 13, 1812, at the Sully Plantation in Fairfax County, Virginia, to Francis Lightfoot Lee II and Jane Fitzgerald. He was the grandson of Richard Henry Lee, great-nephew of Francis Lightfoot Lee I, brother-in-law of Francis Preston Blair Jr., and of Montgomery Blair, and was third cousin of Robert E. Lee.

==Career==

He was appointed a midshipman in the U.S. Navy in November 1825 and subsequently saw extensive service at sea, including combat action during the Mexican–American War and exploration, surveying, and oceanographic duty.

At the outbreak of the American Civil War in 1861, Lee held the rank of commander and was captain of the sloop-of-war in the East Indies, sailing her home on his own initiative to join the blockade of the Southern coast. Commander Lee commanded the new steam sloop during the New Orleans campaign and subsequent operations on the Mississippi River in the first half of 1862. David Farragut had given Commander Lee smaller vessels to ascend the Mississippi River as far as Vicksburg shortly after the naval battle at New Orleans to cut off Confederate supplies from the west and then later the command of five larger vessels to effect the surrender of Vicksburg which Farragut and others assumed would be forthcoming. The Confederates rebuffed Lee&#x27;s offer of surrender and ordered civilians to evacuate the river city in view of a naval bombardment which never came. Lee was replaced by Captain James Palmer.

When asked about his loyalty, Lee famously replied, &quot;When I find the word Virginia in my commission I will join the Confederacy.&quot; This quote is often referenced by historians in contrast to the actions of his cousin Robert E. Lee, to show how the war divided families.

In September 1862, Lee was placed in command of the North Atlantic Blockading Squadron with the rank of Acting rear admiral. He led this force for over two years, during which it was responsible for the blockade of the North Carolina coast and operations on North Carolina and Virginia inland waters, all areas of very active combat between Union and Confederate forces. In September 1863 with some supplies being scarce, the admiral advised the naval station at Wilmington, North Carolina that a single small vessel could be used for patrols of that port. Acting Rear Admiral Lee transferred to the command of the Mississippi River Squadron in October 1864 and led it to the end of the Civil War in 1865.

Reverting to his permanent rank of captain after the Civil War, Lee extensively served in the Washington, D.C., area. He was promoted to rear admiral in 1870 and retired from active service in February 1873.

==Personal life==

Lee married Elizabeth Blair on April 27, 1843. During the Civil War, he was away for long periods. Elizabeth&#x27;s letters to her husband describe wartime life in her homes of Washington, D.C., and Silver Spring, Maryland. Her letters are published in the book &quot;Wartime Washington : the Civil War letters of Elizabeth Blair Lee&quot;. Lee became well known in Washington society due to the influence of his wife, the former Elizabeth Blair of Maryland.

In 1859, Lee&#x27;s father-in-law, Francis Preston Blair, built a house for Lee and his wife Elizabeth next door to his own. These two houses, within a block of the White House in Washington, D.C., were later combined into one house and became the property of the U.S. government. Today they are the Blair-Lee House, used by the president as his guest house. Upon retirement, he moved to the family home in Silver Spring, Maryland, where he died on June 5 or June 7, 1897.

==Legacy==
Two U.S. Navy ships have been named in honor of Rear Admiral Samuel Phillips Lee, the destroyer , which was commissioned in October 1920 and lost by stranding in September 1923, and the research vessel (later T-AG-192), which was in naval service between 1968 and 1974.

<doc id="772896" wikidata="Q2453037" url="?curid=772896" title="How Do You Sleep? (John Lennon song)">
<text>&quot;How Do You Sleep?&quot; is a song by English rock musician John Lennon from his 1971 album &quot;Imagine&quot;. 

The song makes scathing personal attacks aimed at his former Beatles bandmate and songwriting partner, Paul McCartney. Lennon wrote the song in response to what he perceived as personal slights by McCartney on the latter&#x27;s &quot;Ram&quot; album, particularly on the song &quot;Too Many People&quot;.

The track includes a slide guitar solo played by George Harrison, and was co-produced by Lennon, Phil Spector and Yoko Ono.

==Composition and lyrics==

Lennon wrote &quot;How Do You Sleep?&quot; in the aftermath of Paul McCartney&#x27;s successful lawsuit in the London High Court to dissolve the Beatles as a legal partnership. This ruling was caused by the publication of Lennon&#x27;s remarks about the Beatles in a December 1970 interview with &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine, and McCartney and his wife taking full-page advertisements in the music press, in which, as an act of mockery towards Lennon and Yoko Ono, they were shown wearing clown costumes and wrapped up in blankets, which some perceive as being a reference to bagism. Following the release of McCartney&#x27;s album &quot;Ram&quot; in May 1971, Lennon felt attacked by McCartney, who later admitted that lines in the song &quot;Too Many People&quot; were intended as digs at Lennon. Lennon thought that other songs on the album, such as &quot;3 Legs&quot;, contained similar attacks, although McCartney denied the claim.

The lyrics of &quot;How Do You Sleep?&quot; refer to the &quot;Paul is dead&quot; conspiracy theory (&quot;Those freaks was right when they said you was dead&quot;). The song begins with the line &quot;So Sgt. Pepper took you by surprise&quot;, referring to the Beatles&#x27; landmark 1967 album. Preceding this first line are ambient sounds evocative of those heard at the beginning of the &quot;Sgt. Pepper&#x27;s Lonely Hearts Club Band&quot; album.

The lyrics &quot;The only thing you done was yesterday / And since you&#x27;ve gone you&#x27;re just another day&quot; are directed at McCartney, referencing the Beatles&#x27; 1965 song &quot;Yesterday&quot; and McCartney&#x27;s single &quot;Another Day&quot;, released in February 1971. Lennon initially penned the lyrics &quot;You probably pinched that bitch anyway&quot;, as a reference to McCartney&#x27;s claims that he was not sure if he had plagiarized &quot;Yesterday&quot;, having asked Lennon, Harrison, George Martin and others if they had heard that melody before. Although Lennon received the sole writing credit for &quot;How Do You Sleep?&quot;, a contemporary account by Felix Dennis of &quot;Oz&quot; magazine indicates that Yoko Ono, as well as Allen Klein, Lennon&#x27;s manager, also contributed lyrics.

==Recordings==
Lennon recorded &quot;How Do You Sleep?&quot; on 26 May 1971 at Ascot Sound Studios, during the sessions for his &quot;Imagine&quot; album. String overdubs took place on 4 July 1971 at the Record Plant, in New York City. The song features a slide guitar part played by George Harrison. Aside from Lennon on rhythm guitar and vocals, the track also includes Klaus Voormann on bass, Alan White on drums, acoustic guitar played by Ted Turner, Rod Linton and Andy Davis, as well as additional piano parts by Nicky Hopkins and John Tout. Although he had been united with Lennon, Ringo Starr and Klein, against McCartney, in the recent lawsuit, Harrison recalled that the period was one of &quot;very strange, intense feelings&quot; among all the former Beatles, and he was initially wary of Lennon&#x27;s invitation to play on the new album. Given this, Harrison added, he was relieved that Lennon was &quot;openly pleased I came&quot;.

As with all the tracks on &quot;Imagine&quot;, several outtakes of &quot;How Do You Sleep?&quot; became available on bootleg albums and in documentary films about Lennon. A run-through of the song in the 2000 film &quot;Gimme Some Truth&quot; includes what authors Chip Madinger and Mark Easter describe as &quot;John&#x27;s query to Paul&quot;, as Lennon faces the camera and sings: &quot;How do you sleep, ya cunt?&quot; Starr visited the studio during the recording of the song and was reportedly upset, saying: &quot;That&#x27;s enough, John.&quot; The final mix version as released on the album is in mono rather than stereo, unlike all the other tracks. In 2018, two versions of the original recording sessions were released in 5.1 surround sound as part of the &quot;Imagine&quot; box set.

==Critical reception==
In a contemporary review of &quot;Imagine&quot;, Ben Gerson of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; highlighted &quot;How Do You Sleep?&quot; among the album&#x27;s three &quot;really worthy, musically effective numbers&quot; but found it &quot;horrifying and indefensible&quot; as a song that &quot;lay waste to Paul&#x27;s character, family and career&quot;. Gerson concluded: &quot;The motives for &#x27;Sleep&#x27; are baffling. Partly it is the traditional bohemian contempt for the bourgeois; partly it is the souring of John&#x27;s long-standing competitive relationship with Paul.&quot; Writing in the &quot;NME&quot;, Alan Smith said of the track: &quot;Musically, it&#x27;s tremendous – open, big, powerful, thundering, dramatic – but this is a song which will be remembered for its lyrics …&quot; As its ultimate putdown of McCartney, Smith identified the couplet &quot;The sound you make is muzak to my ears / You must&#x27;ve learned something in all those years.&quot; In &quot;Melody Maker&quot;, Roy Hollingworth lauded &quot;Imagine&quot; as the best work that Lennon had ever done and described &quot;How Do You Sleep?&quot; as &quot;the unnerving slash at McCartney … a slow funk with Commanche or maybe Sioux flavoured strings&quot;.

Thomas MacFarlane wrote about the song:

A few months after &quot;Imagine&quot; was released, Lennon stated that the song &quot;was an answer to &quot;Ram&quot;&quot; but added: 

Shortly before his death in 1980, Lennon stated in an interview with &quot;Playboy&quot;: &quot;I used my resentment against Paul … to create a song … not a terrible vicious horrible vendetta … I used my resentment and withdrawing from Paul and The Beatles, and the relationship with Paul, to write &#x27;How Do You Sleep&#x27;. I don&#x27;t really go &#x27;round with those thoughts in my head all the time&quot;.

<text>The third USS &quot;Philadelphia&quot; was the flagship of Rear Admiral Samuel Phillips Lee when he commanded the North Atlantic Blockading Squadron during the American Civil War.

==Service history==
A side-wheel, iron-hulled steamer, &quot;Philadelphia&quot; was built at Chester, Pennsylvania, in 1859 as the commercial vessel of the same name. She was operating as a trading vessel between Aquia Creek, Virginia and Washington, D.C. at the outbreak of the Civil War. Seized on 21 April 1861, in accordance with a Presidential order, she was ordered to the Washington Navy Yard, where she fitted out for naval service. &quot;Philadelphia&quot; — Lieutenant William Nicholson Jeffers commanding — operated on the Potomac River as a patrol vessel. In May, she was detailed to transport ordnance stores to Fortress Monroe, to Philadelphia and to New York. Upon return to the Washington Navy Yard, Jeffers reported that the steamer was in no respect suitable for outside service. She continued to operate on the Potomac River until October 1861, primarily transporting troops downriver to Fort Washington.

&quot;Philadelphia&quot; was assigned duties with the North Atlantic Blockading Squadron in October, and in January–February 1862 served as squadron flagship. &quot;Philadelphia&quot; took part in the expedition to Hatteras Inlet in January and served as flag-steamer to Flag Officer Louis M. Goldsborough at the battle of Roanoke Island North Carolina on 7–8 February. She also took part in the Battle of New Bern in March, and later participated in the expedition to the Dismal Swamp Canal on 17–20 April. From August 1863 – 1865, &quot;Philadelphia&quot; was flagship of the South Atlantic Blockading Squadron. The highlight of her activities during this period was her participation in the operation against Charleston, South Carolina in the fall of 1863. With the close of hostilities &quot;Philadelphia&quot; was sent to the Washington Navy Yard where she decommissioned on 31 August 1865. She was sold at public auction on 15 September to N. L. and G. Griswold. Renamed &quot;Ironsides&quot; in 1869, she was lost by stranding at Hog Island, Virginia on 29 August 1873.

<text>Paulo Renato Rebocho Ferreira (; born 18 January 1979) is a Portuguese former footballer who played as a full-back.

After starting out at Estoril, he went on to spend the vast majority of his 16-year professional career with Porto and Chelsea, signing with the latter in 2004 for €20 million. He won several major titles with both clubs, including two Primeira Liga titles, three Premier League trophies and the 2004 and 2012 editions of the Champions League.

Ferreira earned 62 caps for the Portugal national team between 2002 and 2010, playing at two European Championships and two World Cups and finishing as runner-up at Euro 2004.

==Club career==
===Early career===
Born in Cascais, Lisbon District, Ferreira started his career in the Segunda Liga with Estoril. In the following two seasons he was relatively played, representing the club in both that and the third divisions.

Ferreira signed with Vitória de Setúbal for 2000–01, scoring two goals in 33 games during the campaign to help his team promote to the Primeira Liga after finishing in third place. His first appearance in the competition took place on 13 August 2001, in a 3–1 away loss against Marítimo.

===Porto===
Ferreira moved to Porto in the summer of 2002, signed by coach José Mourinho who converted him from right midfielder to right-back. He only missed two league games over his two-year stint, as the club won back-to-back national championships.

Ferreira was also in the starting XI in the 2003 UEFA Cup final against Celtic in Seville (which ended with a 3–2 win), that year&#x27;s 1–0 defeat of União de Leiria in the Taça de Portugal which meant the conquest of the treble and the 2004 UEFA Champions League final, won against Monaco.

===Chelsea===
On 22 June 2004, Ferreira joined Chelsea for €20 million (£13.2 million), reuniting at Stamford Bridge with both Mourinho and former Porto teammate Ricardo Carvalho, both of whom were also signed in the off-season. He impressed greatly in his first year, appearing in 42 competitive matches and helping to the Premier League title after a 50-year wait.

Ferreira scored his first competitive goal for the Blues on 19 February 2006, in a 3–1 home victory over Colchester United in the FA Cup&#x27;s fifth round. On 30 April, as his team wrapped up a second successive league title with a 3–0 win over Manchester United, his tackle on Wayne Rooney fractured the England striker&#x27;s metatarsal and jeopardised his chance&#x27;s of going to June&#x27;s World Cup. Rooney admitted in 2022 that this injury was caused in part by his choice to wear longer studs on his boots, ironically in order to hurt others.

In 2006–07, Ferreira lost his importance in the squad, first being overtaken in his position by Khalid Boulahrouz and then midfielders Lassana Diarra and Geremi; he did play the full 120 minutes of the 1–0 FA Cup win against Manchester United on 19 May 2007, the first final to be played at the new Wembley.

In 2007–08, Ferreira played second-fiddle to Juliano Belletti and Michael Essien. He signed a new five-year deal with Chelsea on 18 February 2008, switching from jersey #20 to #19 at the start of the following season following Deco&#x27;s arrival.

On 23 September 2009, following a lengthy injury lay-off, Ferreira returned to action in a League Cup match against Queens Park Rangers. On 2 December, in the same competition, he netted his second and last goal for the Londoners, a late equaliser in extra time of the quarter-finals at Blackburn Rovers which ended in a penalty shootout loss.

Following physical problems that afflicted José Bosingwa, Ashley Cole and Branislav Ivanović, Ferreira was given a more consistent role as a starter as Yuri Zhirkov featured in the other defensive wing, most significantly in the 7–1 rout of Aston Villa and the 2–1 victory at Manchester United. He still contributed with 20 official appearances, helping his team win the double.
Ferreira appeared in his 200th game for Chelsea on 20 April 2011, playing the entire 3–1 home win against Birmingham City. He was once described by Mourinho as &quot;a player who will never be &quot;Player of the match&quot; but will always score 7/10 for his individual display&quot;.

Ferreira featured often under Carlo Ancelotti but, after his sacking and his replacement with André Villas-Boas, found it hard to find a place in the squad as the latter manager opted for a younger squad in detriment of several veterans. His first game of the 2011–12 campaign was on 21 September 2011, on a penalty shootout win over Fulham for the League Cup. His first league appearance occurred on 22 December, after coming on for injured Ivanović in a 1–1 draw away to Tottenham Hotspur; in the final minutes of that match, he suffered a fractured cheekbone in a clash with Gareth Bale.

On 27 March 2012, in his first UEFA Champions League start of the season, Ferreira had another solid defensive performance to help Chelsea defeat Benfica 1–0 at the Estádio da Luz. and eventually win the quarter-final tie 3–1. On 19 May, he was an unused substitute in the final against Bayern Munich.

Ferreira&#x27;s contract ran through the summer of 2013, and both player and club confirmed that they would not renew it upon its expiration. He made his last appearance in a league fixture with Everton on 19 May 2013, coming on as a late substitute to a round of applause as the 2–1 win secured the hosts a spot in the Champions League group stage. Afterwards, teammate Frank Lampard addressed the crowd and praised the 34-year-old defender, who announced he was retiring from professional football and thanked the fans for their continued support; over nine seasons, he appeared in 217 official games.

==International career==

Between the Portuguese under-20 and under-21 sides, Ferreira appeared in a total of 27 matches. He made his debut for the full side on 7 September 2002, playing the second half of a 1–1 friendly draw with England at Villa Park.

Ferreira was selected by coach Luiz Felipe Scolari for the UEFA Euro 2004 tournament. He started their opening match against Greece, but a series of mistakes in the 1–2 loss saw him dropped for Miguel for the rest of the tournament. Following an injury to the latter late into the first half of the final, however, he returned to action in another defeat to the same opponent, now 1–0.

Ferreira made two appearances for Portugal in the 2006 World Cup: in the 0–1 semi-final loss against France, he replaced injured Miguel during the second half, and started the third place play-off against the host country Germany (1–3 defeat). Subsequently, he faced competition from Bosingwa and Miguel for the right-back slot, and was often deployed at the opposite flank following the retirement of Nuno Valente.

Ferreira was named in the squad for the Euro 2008. He started all four games as a left-back, in an eventual quarter-final exit.

A regular in the 2010 World Cup qualifying phase, Ferreira would then be included in the 23-men squad to represent the &quot;Selecção&quot; in the finals. He only played the opening game in South Africa, a goalless draw to the Ivory Coast.

On 30 August 2010, Ferreira announced he would be also retiring from the national team, shortly after Simão Sabrosa did.

==Post-retirement==
After retiring, Ferreira worked for Chelsea as an ambassador and assistant loan player technical coach. On 5 July 2023, he was appointed assistant manager at French Ligue 1 club Lille, joining his compatriot Paulo Fonseca&#x27;s staff.

The pair continued working together subsequently, at AC Milan and Lyon.

<text>The Gateway Cities region, or Southeast Los Angeles County, is an urbanized region located in southeastern Los Angeles County, California, between the City of Los Angeles proper, Orange County, and the Pacific Ocean. The cluster of cities has been termed &quot;Gateway Cities&quot; in that they serve as a &quot;gateway&quot; between the LA and Orange counties, with the city of Cerritos equidistant from Downtown L.A., Long Beach, and Santa Ana in Orange County. As such, the area is central to the Los Angeles-Long Beach-Anaheim, CA Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA), and has a population of approximately 2,000,000 residents.

Despite a predominating urban fabric of single-family homes and low-rise multifamily residential structures, Southeast LA County comprises some of the most densely populated municipalities in the United States. As with other regions of Los Angeles, Southeast LA&#x27;s demographics are notable for ethnic and age diversity.

The Gateway Cities Council of Governments (GCCOG), the coordinating body for the Southeast LA Region, is located in the city of Paramount.

<text>USS &quot;New London&quot; was a screw steamer of the Union Navy during the American Civil War. She was outfitted with a Parrott rifle and 32-pounders, and was assigned as a gunboat in the Union blockade of the Confederate States of America.

== Service history ==

&quot;New London&quot; was built at Mystic, Connecticut in 1859, purchased by the Navy at New York City on 26 August 1861; and commissioned at New York Navy Yard on 29 October 1861, with Lieutenant Abner Read in command. Ordered to the Gulf of Mexico on 2 November, &quot;New London&quot;, aided by , captured the schooner &quot;Olive&quot; laden with lumber shortly before midnight on 21 November. Early the next morning, she took the steamboat &quot;Anna &quot;carrying turpentine and rosin from Pascagoula, Mississippi, to New Orleans, Louisiana. About dawn a week later, she took the steamboat &quot;Henry Lewis &quot;carrying sugar and molasses; and that afternoon she captured a schooner trying to slip through the blockade with naval stores for Havana, Cuba. On 28 November 1861 she captured , which was later put into service in the U.S. Navy. &quot;New London&quot; captured the steamer &quot;Advocate&quot; on 1 December; and the schooner &quot;Delight&quot; with sloops &quot;Empress&quot; and &quot;Osceola&quot; on 9 December. On the 28th the schooner &quot;Gypsy&quot; became her prize.

Not content just to capture ships, &quot;New London&quot;, with and &quot;Henry Lewis&quot;, rounded out her record on the last day of 1861 by sending a landing party ashore to capture Biloxi, Mississippi, destroying a Confederate battery and taking possession of two guns and the schooner &quot;Captain Spedden&quot;. On 20 February 1862 a boat expedition from &quot;New London&quot; landed on Cat Island, Mississippi and interned 12 small sloops and schooners suspected of being pilot boats for blockade runners. On 4 April, with and , &quot;New London&quot; engaged CSS &quot;Carondelet&quot;, CSS &quot;Pamlico&quot;, and CSS &quot;Oregon&quot; while &quot;Henry Lewis&quot; landed 1,200 Union Army troops at Pass Christian, Mississippi and destroyed a Confederate camp there. Boats from &quot;New London&quot; captured the yachts &quot;Comet&quot; and &quot;Algerine&quot; near New Basin Canal, Louisiana on 2 June. On 17 June she captured and destroyed batteries at North and South passes.

On 18 July, accompanied by the &quot;Grey Cloud&quot;, the &quot;New London&quot; approached the large hotel at Pascagoula and announced its arrival by firing two shells over the hotel. Both steamers had been reinforced by men from the for this raid. The &quot;New London&quot; docked at the Hotel Wharf at Pascagoula, Mississippi, and deployed about 60 sailors and marines to the village to capture mails and confiscate the telegraph equipment. Sentries quickly spotted a Confederate cavalry patrol and the sailors and marines withdrew to their gunboats. The &quot;Grey Cloud&quot; moved about a half-mile west and attempted to enter the Pascagoula River with the intent on capturing local schooners with turpentine and lumber. However, the mouth of the river was obstructed to prevent passage. At this point the gunboats stood off shore and put in three launches loaded with about 25 sailors and marines each and proceeded up the river. About a mile from the mouth, where the river is not but 200 yards wide, the launches were ambushed by a platoon of 30 troopers of the Mobile Dragoons under Lieut Hallett, a cavalry unit armed with Sharps carbines. The launches returned fire, but where in the open and withdrew to the mouth of the river with eight or nine wounded. Once the launches were clear, the &quot;New London&quot; fired 25 shells into the village and the &quot;Grey Cloud&quot; fired seven shells; however, only one civilian was reported slightly wounded. After sitting off shore 19 July, the ships withdrew from the shoreline. Ref: Charleston Daily Courier, 29 July 1862

During the ensuing years &quot;New London&quot; served on blockade duty in the Gulf of Mexico, operating primarily off the Texas coast. She and captured the British schooner &quot;Tampico&quot; off Sabine Pass, Texas, attempting to run out laden with cotton on 3 April 1863. On the 10th, while reconnoitering near Sabine City, a boat crew from &quot;New London&quot; captured a small sloop. Among the prisoners was Capt. Charles Fowler, CSN, who had commanded CSS &quot;Josiah Bell&quot; when the Confederate warship took and in January. On 18 April, another boat expedition was surprised and driven off by Confederate troops. On 7 July, with , &quot;New London&quot; engaged batteries below Donaldsonville, Louisiana. Three days later, while steaming to New Orleans, the ship engaged Confederate batteries at White Hall Point, Mississippi. Back off the Texas coast, she captured the schooner &quot;Raton del Nilo&quot; on 3 December.

&quot;New London&quot; continued to serve the West Gulf Blockading Squadron through the end of the Civil War. She sailed north on 12 July 1865 and decommissioned at Boston, Massachusetts, 3 August 1865. She was sold at public auction on 8 September 1865 to M. M. Comstock. Redocumented as &quot;Acushnet&quot; on 27 December 1865, she operated in merchant service until 1910.

<text>A rag doll is a doll made from scraps of fabric. They are one of the oldest children&#x27;s toys in existence. Today, many rag dolls are commercially produced to mimic aspects of the original home-made dolls, such as simple features, soft cloth bodies, and patchwork clothing.

== History ==
Traditionally home-made from (and stuffed with) spare scraps of material, they are one of the oldest children&#x27;s toys in existence. The British Museum has a Roman rag doll, found in a child&#x27;s grave dating from the 1st to 5th century AD. Historically, rag dolls have been used as comfort objects, and to teach young children nurturing skills. They were often used to teach children how to sew, as the children could practice sewing clothes for the doll and make some simple dolls themselves. In America, from the colonial era up to the early 20th century, children of various statuses would play with dolls made from rags or corn husks. Mass production of rag dolls began around 1830, when fabric color printing was first developed.

== Types ==

=== Amish ===

Amish dolls are a type of traditional American rag dolls which originated as children&#x27;s toys among the Old Order Amish people. These dolls commonly have no facial features.

=== Mexican ===

=== Slavic ===

Motanka dolls (Polish &quot;motanka&quot;, Ukrainian &quot;мо́танка&quot;, from &quot;motać&quot;/&quot;мотати&quot; - to tangle/spool/wind) are a type of traditional amulet dolls made in Poland, Ukraine and Belarus. They were a part of folk culture (Vasilisa the Beautiful) and its magical beliefs, made and tied without the use of a needle or other sharp objects, to &quot;not poke/hurt the fate&quot; and traditionally had no facial features, sometimes with a cross instead. Motanka dolls were made with specific intentions and wishes/tasks for them to grant, of various sorts, such as guarding the family or a prosperous marriage. Nowadays motanka dolls are coming back to popularity as a part of interest in Slavic cultures of the past, often as an educational device during educational and ethnographic workshops, or as a work of folk artists.

=== Commercially produced ===

Today, many rag dolls are commercially produced to mimic aspects of the original home-made dolls, such as simple features, soft cloth bodies, and patchwork clothing. One prominent example of a commercially produced ragdoll is the Raggedy Ann doll. Raggedy Ann first appeared in 1918 as the main character of a series of children&#x27;s stories by Johnny Gruelle. Raggedy Andy, her brother, was introduced in 1920. 

== Traditional materials ==
In their earlier forms, rag dolls were made out of cloth scraps or cornhusks. In the 19th and 20th century, rag dolls were made out of stockinette, felt, or velvet.

<doc id="772928" wikidata="Q5184424" url="?curid=772928" title="Crescent Shipyard">
<text>Crescent Shipyard, located on Newark Bay in Elizabeth, New Jersey, built a number of ships for the United States Navy and allied nations as well during their production run, which lasted about ten years while under the Crescent name and banner. Production of these ships began before the Spanish–American War and occurred far before the outbreak of World War I. Arthur Leopold Busch, a recent emigre from Great Britain, started the yard with former Navy Lt. Lewis Nixon in January 1895. Both men previously worked for William Cramp &amp; Sons in Philadelphia. Both Nixon and Busch were regarded to be amongst the best in their respected fields - and what they did at this time - as designers and builders of the latest, most advanced types of ships.

Nixon, a cofounder of Crescent Shipyard was also the lead designer of America&#x27;s first class of battleships at William Cramp &amp; Sons Shipyard, in Philadelphia. He also built the Anstice yacht (1902) that was renamed the &quot;Sandy Hook&quot;.

Isaac Rice&#x27;s Electric Launch Company, which was started to build electrically propelled launches and small craft, also began its operations here.

The Crescent Shipyard was operated by Nixon until 1904. In 1904 Crescent Shipyard was acquired by Bethlehem Steel in 1904. Bethlehem Steel leased the yard to John W. Sullivan and part to New Jersey Dry Dock &amp; Transportation Company. In 1916, Bethlehem Steel took over operation of the shipyard. The yard was closed permanently shortly after the conclusion of World War I in 1921.

==Submarine works==
Busch, as this shipyard&#x27;s superintendent, supervised several classes of naval ships, including gunboats, monitors, and cruisers in addition to the first commissioned submarine of the United States Navy, USS Holland (SS-1). The Holland is considered technologically revolutionary in several respects. This submarine was considered a historic first, and revolutionary in a timeline of naval innovations in world history. Internationally, many &quot;advanced&quot; industrialized nations around the world took note – almost immediately – and some acquired the rights to build them soon after the purchase of the &quot;Holland VI&quot; on 11 April 1900.

Busch, as shipyard construction chief and naval architect for Lewis Nixon, went on to supervise the building of the prototype &quot;Fulton&quot;, which followed the USS &quot;Holland&quot; and was used as an example and template in development of America&#x27;s A-class or s. Busch reviewed the engineering plans of &quot;Fulton&quot; with Holland, who approved the works of Busch. These pioneering submarines were built for the Holland Torpedo Boat Company named after this company&#x27;s founder John Philip Holland. Work on these submarines began at this shipyard in the late fall of 1896 with the keel to the &quot;Holland VI&quot; being laid down by early December of that year.

Holland&#x27;s company evolved into the Electric Boat Company after this company was officially incorporated on 7 February 1899. Japan&#x27;s first five submarines were developed under Busch&#x27;s direction while working at Fore River Ship and Engine Company in Quincy, Massachutsetts for Electric Boat and Admiral Francis T. Bowles, President of the shipyard in 1904. Electric Boat had subcontracted with the Fore River Shipbuilding yard for some twenty years (since this time) before moving to their present location in Groton, CT.

==Bethlehem Elizabethport==
Bethlehem Elizabethport built United States Shipping Board cargo Ships, tugboats, reefer ships, tanker ships starting in 1918 for World War I. The ships were part of the Emergency Fleet Corporation program.

The site of the shipyard at Front and Marshall Streets is now Veterans Memorial Waterfront Park.

==John W. Sullivan Company==
John W. Sullivan Company from 1914 to 1926 built: cargo ships. tungboats, minesweepers, Ferry ships, tankers, fireboats and salvage ship.

==New Jersey Dry Dock &amp; Transportation Company==
The New Jersey Dry Dock &amp; Transportation Company from 1914 to 1916 built: tugs, a cutter, Fire Boat and a barge.

==Samuel L Moore &amp; Company==
Samuel L Moore &amp; Company built from 1890 to 1893 tug, gunboat, ferry, lighthouse tender and yacht.

<text>Union Iron Works, located in San Francisco, California, on the southeast waterfront, was a central business within the large industrial zone of Potrero Point, for four decades at the end of the nineteenth and beginning of the twentieth centuries.

==History==
Peter Donohue, an Irish immigrant, founded Union Brass &amp; Iron Works in the south of Market area of San Francisco in 1849. It was later run by his son, James Donohue. After years as the premiere producer of mining, railroad, agricultural and locomotive machinery in California, Union Iron Works, led by I. M. Scott, entered the ship building business and relocated to Potrero Point where its shipyards still exist, making the site on the north side of the Potrero the longest running privately owned shipyard in the United States. After Bethlehem Shipbuilding Corporation bought the works in 1905, the consolidated company came to include the Alameda Works Shipyard, located across the San Francisco Bay in Alameda and the Hunter&#x27;s Point shipyard to the south.

In 1885, the Union Iron Works launched the first steel-hulled ship on the west coast, , built with steel from the Pacific Rolling Mills. In 1886, UIW was awarded a $1,000,000 contract to build the cruiser for the United States Navy, which they completed in eighteen months. From the completion of &quot;Arago&quot; in 1884 to 1902, UIW built seventy-five marine vessels, including two of the most famous vessels of the Spanish–American War, and .

An 1892 description of the yards stated that between 1200 and 1500 men were employed and the yearly gross revenue was between $2,000,000 and $4,000,000. By the turn of the century, the shipyard had expanded in area and employment had more than doubled to 3,500. These industrial facilities used five types of power, distributed throughout; electricity, compressed air, steam, hydraulic and coal or gas fire.
Union Iron works built a number of ships for the United States Navy. These ships include USS &quot;Oregon&quot; laid down in 1891, and s and which were launched in 1902 and 1903, respectively. The latter two were subcontracted from the Holland Torpedo Boat Company, and were the first submarines built on the West Coast.

In 1902, the Union Iron Works was absorbed into a combine called the United States Shipbuilding Company and was mired in three years of litigation. In 1905, the entire shipyard was purchased by Bethlehem Shipbuilding Corporation for one million dollars. Charles M. Schwab stood on the steps of the UIW office building on 20th Street during the auction. At this point, he was the only bidder. Schwab was widely believed to have engineered the demise of the U.S. Shipbuilding Corporation in order to gain control of the industry. Whether or not that was true, he certainly benefited from the collapse of the US Shipbuilding combine.


At the time of the 1906 San Francisco earthquake, the coastal passenger liner of the San Francisco and Portland Steamship Company had been undergoing a refit at the yard&#x27;s hydraulic drydock. The earthquake caused the iron-hulled &quot;Columbia&quot; to shift off her supports and roll onto the drydock on her starboard side. This damaged the drydock, a key feature of the yard, beyond economic repair. &quot;Columbia&quot; on the other hand, despite being partially flooded and damaged, was repaired and returned to service in January 1907. In 1908, Bethlehem Shipbuilding Corporation bought the Hunter&#x27;s Point drydocks. In the pre-World War I era, Union Iron Works built several navy ships that became internationally famous due to the Spanish–American War including Commodore Dewey&#x27;s flagship the &quot;Olympia&quot;. After 1905, the shipyard operated as part of Bethlehem Steel, and produced both warships and merchant ships. The shipyard was expanded in 1911 by purchasing Risdon Iron Works, the land next to the shipyard. Risdon Iron Works built locomotives, this was closed and a new shipyard was built to build US Navy including destroyers and submarines. Risdon Iron Works was founded by John Risdon of Saline, Michigan in 1896. Risdon Iron Works started by building boilers, iron pipes, steam engines and gas engines. From 1873 to 1909 Risdon Iron Works also built ships, tugs, ferries and barges. John Risdon held the patents for the first river mining dredge.

<text>Orbe (; ; older , ; ) is a municipality in the Swiss canton of Vaud. It was the seat of the former district of Orbe and is now part of the district of Jura-Nord Vaudois.

==History==
Orbe is first mentioned about 280 as &quot;Urba&quot;. In 1179, it was mentioned as &quot;versus Orbam&quot;.

===Ancient history===
During the Roman era, Orbe – then known as Urba – was a town of Gallia, in the territory of the Helvetii. In the Antonine Itinerary, it is placed between Lacus Lausonius and Ariolica, xviii m.p. from Lacus Lausonius and xxiiii m.p. from Ariolica.

On the Boscéaz hill are the remains of a vast and luxurious Roman villa, the large, exquisite mosaics of which are visible.

===Middle ages===

By the Middle Ages, Orbe sat on the road over the Jougne Pass and at the crossroads of two major transportation routes. One stretched from the Jura Mountains to the Alps while the other ran from the Rhine River to the Rhone River. The municipality grew up on both sides of the Orbe. On the left side was the villa Tavellis and the parish church of Saint-Germain, while the right side had the villa Tabernis with the church of Saint-Martin. At some point during the Middle Ages, a bridge was built across the river which joined the two settlements. Orbe Castle and the town&#x27;s market were built on the hill above the river and the bridge.

In 888, the town was owned by the Burgundian king Rudolf I. The next records of the town come from silver coins which the town&#x27;s mint produced for Conrad the peaceful between 937 and 993. The town remained part of the independent Kingdom of Burgundy until the death of the last king, Rudolf III in 1032. Before Rudolph&#x27;s death, the Emperor Conrad II of the Holy Roman Empire had forced him to name Conrad as his successor. With Rudolph&#x27;s death, the entire kingdom, including Orbe, was incorporated into the empire. In 1076, Emperor Henry IV replaced the Burgundian noble in Orbe with one of his vassals, Count Wilhelm II.

Land and rights in the town passed through several nobles, and in 1168, Amadeus II of Montfaucon, the count of Montbéliard, bought about half of the town of Orbe. In a record from 1183, the town&#x27;s churches and much of the land were owned by Baulmes and Payerne Priories. Around the end of the 11th century, Romainmôtier Abbey acquired some land in the town, on which they built a hospital. In 1139, they expanded the building into the nearby Notre-Dame chapel.

In addition to the religious land owners, the Counts of Montfaucon-Montbeliard began to live in the town. In 1233, they built a round keep in Orbe Castle. Two years later, Amadeus III of Montfaucon-Montbeliard built the Bourg-Vieux and Bourg-Neuf to help protect the town. By fortifying the town and castle, the counts and the town were able to control the trade routes that passed through the valley.

===Early modern and modern Orbe===
In 1352, Orbe became a town with a town charter modeled on Moudon&#x27;s. After the death of Girard de Montfaucon and of his wife, Orbe was inherited by Count Montbeliard in 1379. In 1410, it passed to Louis de Chalon, the Prince of Orange. The Chalon family held the town until it was captured by the Swiss Confederation in 1475 during the Burgundian Wars. However, the Swiss were unable to hold it and Hugh de Chalon recaptured it in the same year. In the following year, Charles the Bold met with Swiss messengers at Orbe. Due to the Swiss victory in the Burgundian Wars, the confederation acquired much of the old Burgundian land near the Jura Mountains in 1484. The de Chalon lands, including Orbe and nearby Echallens, became a joint condominium or &quot;gemeine Herrschaft&quot; which was administered by Bern and Fribourg. It remained a subject territory until the 1798 French invasion and the creation of the French-backed Helvetic Republic. Under the Helvetic Republic, Orbe became the capital of the District of Orbe. The Helvetic Republic, which espoused the ideals of the French Revolution, was very popular with the urban residents of Orbe. The reforms of the Helvetic Republic were too much for many Swiss to accept, and the republic was overthrown by the Stecklikrieg revolution. As the Helvetic government retreated in September 1802 from Bern to Lausanne, government troops briefly occupied Orbe. Under the Act of Mediation, Orbe remained the capital of its own district.

<text>Georg Ritter von Schönerer (17 July 1842 – 14 August 1921) was an Austrian landowner and politician of Austria-Hungary active in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. A major exponent of pan-Germanism and German nationalism in Austria who endorsed the annexation of Austrian Germans and Austria to Germany in an &quot;Anschluss&quot;. 

Schönerer was a radical opponent of political Catholicism and a fierce antisemite who exerted much influence on the young Adolf Hitler. He was known for a generation as the most radical pan-German nationalist in Austria.

==Life and career==
===Early life===
Schönerer was born in Vienna as Georg Heinrich Schönerer; his father, the wealthy railroad pioneer Matthias Schönerer (1807–1881), an employee of the House of Rothschild, was knighted (adding the hereditary title of &quot;Ritter&quot;, &quot;Knight&quot;, and the nobiliary particle of &quot;von&quot;) by Emperor Franz Joseph in 1860. His wife was a great-granddaughter of Rabbi Samuel Löb Kohen, who died at Pohořelice in 1832. He had a younger sister, Alexandrine, later director of the &quot;Theater an der Wien&quot;, who strongly rejected her brother&#x27;s politics.

From 1861, Georg studied agronomy at the universities of Tübingen, Hohenheim and Magyaróvár (&quot;Ungarisch-Altenburg&quot;, today a campus of the University of West Hungary). He then conducted the business affairs of his father&#x27;s estate at Rosenau near Zwettl in the rural Waldviertel region of Lower Austria, where he became known as a generous patriarch of the local peasants and great benefactor.

Shaken by Austria&#x27;s defeat in the 1866 Austro-Prussian War, the dissolution of the German Confederation, and the foundation of the German Empire in 1871, Schönerer became a political activist and ardent admirer of the German Chancellor Otto von Bismarck. He wrote passionately admiring letters to Bismarck, and continued doing so even after Bismarck made clear that he rejected any sort of Austro-German nationalism and would not allow Austria&#x27;s pan-Germans to jeopardize the Dual Alliance.

===Entering parliament===
During the Panic of 1873, Schönerer was elected to Cisleithanian Austria’s Imperial Council as a liberal representative, but became a more and more extreme and vocal German nationalist as his career progressed. He became widely known for his oratory and was considered a firebrand in Parliament. He broke with his party three years later, agitating against &quot;Jewish&quot; capitalism, against the Catholic Imperial House of Habsburg, and against the Austro-Hungarian occupation of Bosnia and Herzegovina in 1878, which he condemned as a betrayal of ethnic German interests. In a speech, he said, &quot;More and more, and ever more loudly, one can hear the German crown provinces exclaim: If only we already belonged to the German Reich and were finally rid of Bosnia and its entourage!&quot;
Tensions rose even further in 1879 due to the accession of minister-president Eduard Taaffe, a member of the Austrian nobility of Irish descent and whose Catholic, monarchist, and pro-minority policies so enraged Schönerer and his followers that they accused Taafe of being &quot;anti-German.&quot;

In 1882 Schönerer, Viktor Adler, and Heinrich Friedjung, drafted the Linz Program, which they proudly called &quot;not liberal, not clerical, but national&quot;, of the Austro-German national movement, which became a major force in Imperial politics.

The framers proposed either complete autonomy for the non-German-speaking Crownlands of Galicia, Bukovina, and Dalmatia or ceding all three to the Kingdom of Hungary. They further demanded that Austria&#x27;s union with Hungary be reduced to having a common monarch, with no other administrative or legislative consequences. Additionally, German was to remain the sole official language of Austria, the Czech people in Bohemia and Moravia were to be coercively Germanized, and a Customs union, which was to be added to the constitution, was to strengthen ties between Austria and the German Empire ruled by the House of Hohenzollern.

Ironically, this manifesto fit in very well with the dreams of Polish, Hungarian and Croatian nationalists. The anti-Slavic inclinations of the framers, however, are well represented in the following excerpt from their manifesto: &quot;We protest against all attempts to convert Austria into a Slavic state. We shall continue to agitate for the maintenance of German as the official language and to oppose the extension of federalism ... [W]e are steadfast supporters of the alliance with Germany and the foreign policy now being followed by the empire.&quot;

===Adoption of antisemitism===
During the 1880s, Schönerer came to consider his struggle for the German Austrians a fight against the Jews. By the peak of his career, he had transformed into a far-right politician. Schönerer developed a political philosophy that featured elements of a violent racial opposition to Jews that disregarded religious affiliations. His campaigning became especially vocal upon the arrival of Jewish refugees during the Russian Empire&#x27;s pogroms, starting in 1881. He fiercely denounced the influence of &quot;exploitative international Jews&quot; and in 1885 had an Aryan paragraph added to the Linz program, which led to the ultimate breach between him and Adler and Friedjung.

Schönerer&#x27;s approach became the model for German national &quot;Burschenschaften&quot; (student fraternities) and numerous associations in Cisleithanian Austria. In turn, Jewish activists like Theodor Herzl began to adopt the idea of Zionism. Schönerer&#x27;s authoritarianism, popular solidarism, nationalism, pan-Germanism, anti-Slavism, and anti-Catholicism appealed to many Viennese, mostly working-class. This appeal made him a powerful political figure in Austria, and he considered himself leader of the German Austrians. Defying the Austrian education ministry&#x27;s prohibition of pan-German symbols in schools and colleges, Schönerer urged German Austrians to wear blue cornflowers (known to be the favourite flower of German Emperor William I) in their buttonholes, along with cockades in the German national colours (black, red, and yellow), as a way to show pride in their German identity and dismissal of the multi-ethnic Austro-Hungarian Empire. Like many other Austrian pan-Germans, Schönerer hoped for the dissolution of the Austro-Hungarian Empire and an &quot;Anschluss&quot; with Germany.

Schönerer&#x27;s movement had various strict criteria: it only allowed its members to be Germans; none of the members could have relatives or friends who were Jews or Slavs, and before any member could marry, they had to prove &quot;Aryan&quot; descent and be checked for health defects. Other pan-German movements generally followed suit by expelling Jews and generally Slavs as well.

Schönerer was addressed by his supporters as the &quot;Führer,&quot; and he and his followers also used the &quot;Heil&quot; greeting, things Hitler and the Nazis later adopted. Schönerer and his followers often met during the summer and winter to celebrate German history and listen to German battle songs. Schönerer told his followers to prepare for a battle between Germans and Jews; he said, &quot;If we don&#x27;t expel the Jews, we Germans will be expelled!&quot;

In 1888, Schönerer was temporarily imprisoned for ransacking a Jewish-owned newspaper office and assaulting its employees for prematurely reporting the imminent death of the German emperor Wilhelm I. His attack increased his popularity and helped members of his party get elected to the Austrian Parliament. Nevertheless, the prison sentence also resulted not only in the loss of his status as a noble, but also of his mandate in parliament. Schönerer was not reelected to the Imperial Council until 1897, while rivals like the Vienna mayor Karl Lueger and his Christian Social Party took the chance created by his disfavor to get ahead.

Schönerer left the Catholic Church in January 1900, and converted to the Lutheran denomination.

===End of career in politics===
In 1897, Schönerer helped orchestrate the expulsion of Minister-President of Cisleithania Kasimir Felix Graf Badeni from office. Badeni had proclaimed that civil servants in Austrian-controlled Bohemia must know the Czech language, an ordinance that prevented many Bohemian ethnic German speakers, most of whom did not speak Czech, from applying for government jobs. Schönerer staged mass protests against the ordinance and disrupted parliamentary proceedings, actions that eventually led Emperor Franz Joseph to dismiss Badeni.

During these years, while the &quot;Kulturkampf&quot; divided Imperial Germany, Schönerer founded the &quot;&quot;Los von Rom!&quot;&quot; (&quot;Away from Rome!&quot;) movement, which advocated the conversion of all Roman Catholic German-speaking people of Austria to Lutheran Protestantism, or, in some cases, to the Old Catholic Churches. Schönerer became even more powerful in 1901, when 21 members of his party gained seats in the Parliament. But his influence and career rapidly declined thereafter due to his forceful views and personality. His party also suffered, and had virtually disintegrated by 1907. But his views and philosophy, not to mention his great skill as an agitator, influenced and inspired Hitler and the Nazi Party.
===Death===
Schönerer died at his Rosenau manor near Zwettl, Lower Austria on 14 August 1921. He had arranged to be buried near Bismarck&#x27;s mausoleum on his estate at Friedrichsruh, Lauenburg, in present-day Schleswig-Holstein, northern Germany.

== Reception ==
Hannah Arendt, in her book &quot;The Origins of Totalitarianism&quot;, described Georg Schönerer as the &quot;spiritual father&quot; of Adolf Hitler.

<text>The Student Society in Trondheim (, Samfundet for short) is Norway&#x27;s largest student society.

Besides housing a café, a restaurant, several bars and frequently hosting concerts and other activities (among them Norway&#x27;s biggest culture festival, UKA), it is an independent organization for all students and teachers in Trondheim, owned fully by its members. At the end of 2011, it had around 9000 members.

Many famous artists have held concerts here. Among others, Sex Pistols, Iggy Pop, N.E.R.D., Phoenix, Public Enemy, White Lies, Crystal Fighters, Tom McRae, Motörhead, Suede, Motorpsycho, Dum Dum Boys, In Flames and many, many more. Quite a few famous Norwegian bands have started their careers on one of Samfundet&#x27;s many stages. Some examples are Knutsen &amp; Ludvigsen, deLillos and Postgirobygget.

Every other year world figures attend The Student Society through its festival ISFiT and past speakers include the Dalai Lama, former Director-General of WHO Gro Harlem Brundtland and Nobel Peace Prize Laureates José Ramos-Horta and Wangari Maathai.

From 1992 to 2014 Samfundet transformed into Trondheim InterRail Center (TIRC) during the summer (from late June to mid August). 
TIRC was started in 1992 by members of the Student Society, and was run by society volunteers every summer.

==History==
One week after the opening of the Norwegian Institute of Technology (NTH) (later the Norwegian University of Science and Technology, NTNU) on September 15, 1910, a group of students met and decided to create a student society, and the following week, on October 1, &quot;Norges Tekniske Høgskolens Studentersamfund&quot; (&quot;The student society of NTH&quot;) came into existence.

At first, membership was limited to NTH students; this was later expanded to all students (aged 18 and older) in the Trondheim area, and thus, in 1912, the name changed into &quot;Studentersamfundet i Trondhjem&quot; (&quot;The student society of Trondheim&quot;), which still is its current name, although the city has switched names twice since.

In the first two years, Samfundet did not have its own building, but in 1912, they bought an old abandoned circus building (only known as &quot;Cirkus&quot;), and 15 years later, in 1927, building of the characteristic red round house began, which is known today as Samfundet. In 1929, the building was finished and the activities were moved. Although Cirkus was abandoned, the old traditions were carried through by architect Eystein Michaelsen; &quot;Storsalen&quot; (the main concert hall) still looks very much like a circus.

The building still stands, with active maintenance on a day-to-day basis and bigger projects taking place every two years (related to UKA).

==Architecture==
It has been said that there were two demands for the original drawings of Samfundet: First of all, it was to have some element of circus (in remembrance of Cirkus, the old building), which has been taken care of in &quot;Storsalen&quot;.

Second, it was to have elements from mazes. Samfundet is split into two parts, the &quot;public&quot; and &quot;private&quot; areas. The public areas can be complicated enough, even though they are mainly dominated by a few larger rooms (most being used as stages of various kinds in the weekends) and hallways in-between. However, the private areas, which are normally only open to the staff, are a true maze. There are over 200 rooms, 40 different levels and various hallways, doors and ladders. Nobody has ever managed to get an exact count of how many rooms or doors the building has; attempts to make CAD models of the building have failed (except for a very coarse model used during modelling of the fire extinguisher system), simply because the pieces do not seem to fit together. Most people get lost at least a few times, and the shortest path between two given places can easily involve fifteen or twenty turns and rooms.

==Committees==
Samfundet is mostly run by its members, more precisely people volunteering for jobs in one of its twenty or so committees (so-called &quot;gangs&quot;). About a thousand students do their share in helping the house (which is known as &quot;the red round house&quot; among its members) keep going, by doing work such as concert booking, doing PA work during concerts, serving food and drinks or managing the internal IT systems. In addition, Samfundet hosts several choirs and other non-technical activities.

==Size==
In 2022 the construction of the appendage started on top of the old Vollan prison plot. 

The appendage opened in August, 2024 and Samfundet is now the 8th biggest nightclub spanning over 13.000m2 and with a legal capacity of around 3800 people.

<doc id="772966" wikidata="Q2620997" url="?curid=772966" title="Cheetah (character)">
<text>The Cheetah is a supervillain appearing in DC Comics publications and related media, most commonly as the archenemy of the superhero Wonder Woman. Like her nemesis, she was created by William Moulton Marston and H. G. Peter, debuting in the autumn of 1943 in &quot;Wonder Woman&quot; #6.

There have been four incarnations of Cheetah: Priscilla Rich (Golden and Silver Age), Deborah Domaine (Bronze Age), Dr. Barbara Ann Minerva (post-&quot;Crisis&quot; and current), and Sebastian Ballesteros (a male usurper who briefly assumed the role in 2001).

The Cheetah character has been adapted in various forms of media outside of comics, including animated series, films, and video games. Kristen Wiig portrayed the Barbara Minerva version of the character in the 2020 DC Extended Universe film &quot;Wonder Woman 1984&quot;, marking the character&#x27;s live-action debut.

==Publication history==
==Fictional character biography==
===Golden Age, Silver Age, and Post-Crisis comics history===
Before the 12-issue DC Comics series &quot;Crisis on Infinite Earths&quot; in 1985 (which is regarded as the starting point for DC&#x27;s continuity before the 2011 New 52 reboot), there were two women who donned spotted cat costumes to fight Wonder Woman as the Cheetah: socialite Priscilla Rich and her niece Deborah Domaine. While modern incarnations of Cheetah possess superhuman powers, Rich and Domaine do not.

There are two Post-&quot;Crisis&quot; Cheetahs: Barbara Minerva and Sebastian Ballesteros, Minerva being the more prominent of the two. While the pre-&quot;Crisis&quot; Cheetahs are simply women in costumes, the Post-&quot;Crisis&quot; Cheetahs are mystical werecats.

===Priscilla Rich===
The first woman to become the Cheetah is Priscilla Rich, a 1940s-era blonde Washington, D.C., debutante and aristocrat. She has a split personality that compels her to commit crimes dressed as a cheetah.

Following conflicts with Wonder Woman, Rich eventually retires and dies of old age.
Rich does not appear as the Cheetah following the &quot;Crisis on Infinite Earths&quot; reboot, and is killed by successor Barbara Minerva.

===Deborah Domaine===
Deborah &quot;Debbie&quot; Domaine is Priscilla Rich&#x27;s niece, who was kidnapped by Kobra and forced to become Cheetah.

Debbie also serves as a member of the Secret Society of Super Villains and battles the Justice League and Justice Society. She has not appeared since &quot;Crisis on Infinite Earths&quot;.

===Barbara Ann Minerva===

The third Cheetah is British archaeologist Barbara Minerva, the heiress to a vast fortune in her ancient family seat in Nottinghamshire. Ambitious, selfish, and severely neurotic, Barbara develops a passion for archaeology that leads her to finance an expedition to find a tribe in Africa, which is said to be protected by a female guardian with the powers of a cheetah. A band of marauders kill the guardian and most of the expedition party. Barbara, with the aid of a tribal priest named Chuma, the caretaker of the ancient plant god Urzkartaga, agrees to become the tribe&#x27;s new guardian after being told that she would gain immortality. Her powers are conferred to her by ingesting a potion made from human blood and the berries and leaves of Urzkartaga, which gives her orange skin with black spots, a tail and claws, as well as superhuman senses and reflexes. Unfortunately for Minerva, the host of the Cheetah persona is intended to be a virgin. Minerva is not, so her transformations were part curse and part blessing, as she experiences severe pain and physical disability while in her human form and bloodthirsty euphoria while in her cat form.

This Cheetah was active before Wonder Woman&#x27;s post-&quot;Crisis&quot; appearance, and confronts Catwoman in Rome during the events of &quot;Batman: Dark Victory&quot; and &quot;Catwoman: When in Rome&quot;.

This version of Cheetah first comes into Wonder Woman&#x27;s world when Barbara discovers that Diana possesses the Lasso of Truth. As an archaeologist, Barbara covets the lasso, hoping to add it to her collection of historical items. She first attempts to do so through trickery, claiming that there is a matching ancient Golden Girdle of Gaea of the same kind from which the lasso was fashioned. Although the scheme proceeds far enough for Minerva to hold the lasso, its magical power to make people tell the truth forces her to confess her true intentions. Diana, profoundly distraught that she would be so treacherous, takes back the lasso and returns home in tears. With the subtle approach having failed, Minerva resorts to attacking the Amazon as the Cheetah to rob her of the lasso. Their initial battle ends with inconclusive results, as Diana&#x27;s friend, Julia Kapatelis, shoots the Cheetah and forces her to retreat.
Over the years, Barbara&#x27;s interest in the lasso wanes and she becomes more interested in besting Diana in battle due to her bruised ego. The rivalry between the Cheetah and Wonder Woman fluctuates over time, however. Wonder Woman saves the Cheetah&#x27;s life during an adventure in the Balkan country of Pan Balgravia. The country&#x27;s dictator, Baron von Nastraed, for unknown reasons, chooses to aid a demon named Drax by capturing a powerful metahuman woman. The captive woman&#x27;s body would be used to provide a body for Drax&#x27;s alternate dimension bride Barremargux to inhabit. When the Baron captures the Cheetah for this purpose, Wonder Woman travels to the country to save her. At the last moment, when Barremargux is about to enter Earth-One, Barbara closes the gateway before the crossing could be completed by jumping into the gateway instead. Barbara is trapped in this demonic dimension until Boston mob boss Julianna Sazia has her scientists open the dimensional gateway to retrieve Barbara for use as a living weapon. Barbara double-crosses Julianna, choosing to aid Wonder Woman when she is caught up in a war between Sazia and rival mobster Paulie Longo. Considering her debt to Wonder paid, the Cheetah continues her quest to defeat Wonder Woman, but only when it is convenient to her.

For a brief period of time, Minerva loses her powers to businessman Sebastian Ballesteros, who convinces Urzkartaga that he could be a more effective Cheetah than she was. Minerva later kills Ballesteros, offers his remains as a sacrifice, and regains her powers.

The relationship Minerva has with Urzkartaga is strained at times, despite Minerva showing complete deference and loyalty to her patron god. At one point, the god punishes her for her failures by leaving one of Minerva&#x27;s hands human looking and untransformed even while she is in her Cheetah form, though it appears to still be fully empowered as the rest of her body and equally as deadly. With help from Zoom, Minerva attains a level of super-speed even greater than she previously possessed. She accomplishes this by murdering Priscilla Rich, who previously went by the alias of Cheetah, thus seemingly establishing herself as the true Cheetah based on Zoom&#x27;s own psychological insight. They later join the latest Secret Society of Super Villains and seem to be engaged in a sexual relationship, though Zoom considers himself to still be married to his former wife.

In the &quot;One Year Later&quot; storyline, the witch Circe places a spell on Minerva that allows her to change her appearance from human to the Cheetah at will, even though she still remains in her Cheetah form in either guise. She also gains control over three actual cheetahs and still possesses her super-speed, which is demonstrated by her ability to steal the golden lasso away from Donna Troy several times in battle. She is later seen in the &quot;Justice League of America Wedding Special&quot;, forming a new Injustice League alongside Lex Luthor and the Joker. She also appears in &quot;Salvation Run&quot;. Later still, in &quot;Final Crisis: Resist&quot;, she joins forces with Checkmate to rebel against Darkseid, and has a brief relationship with Snapper Carr. In the pages of &quot;Wonder Woman&quot;, she is revealed as the power behind the Secret Society, having taken responsibility for the creation of Genocide. She arranges to have her ally Doctor Psycho take the place of Sarge Steel as director of the Department of Metahuman Affairs which, in the middle of Genocide&#x27;s onslaught, she targets for destruction.

====The New 52====
In 2011, DC relaunched its comic books and rebooted its continuity in an initiative called The New 52. The character was re-made to be a corrupt image and antecedent to Wonder Woman and the ideals she represents. Barbara Minerva (having used several aliases that happen to be the names of various incarnations of the character) is given a revised backstory: she is established as an ally of Wonder Woman&#x27;s due to her knowledge of dangerous relics, and having previously grown up in an all-woman commune called &quot;Amazonia&quot;. In the possession of a dagger once belonging to a lost tribe of Amazons, she accidentally cut herself on it. This caused her to become possessed by the &quot;Goddess of the Hunt&quot;, transforming her into a human-cheetah hybrid. Her claws transform Superman into a cheetah-like being when she scratches him. The origin of Cheetah is dated back to the Sun Tribe, who for centuries had hunted alongside the cheetahs. Every generation, one of their members is chosen to become the host of the Goddess of the Hunt, until one day a hunter killed the current host; the knife used to kill her was cursed until it fell into the hands of Minerva. The Cheetah is subdued by the Justice League and placed in Belle Reve. However, once there, she makes contact with someone telling him she is where he requested, implying her capture was staged as a part of a bigger plan.

During the &quot;Forever Evil&quot; storyline, Cheetah&#x27;s mysterious benefactor is revealed to be the Crime Syndicate to join the Secret Society of Super Villains. Psi shares a vision with Steve Trevor showing Cheetah in possession of Wonder Woman&#x27;s lasso and hiding out in Central Park. When Steve Trevor and Killer Frost arrive in Central Park to look for the Cheetah, they end up being ambushed by the Cheetah and her Menagerie (consisting of Elephant Man, Hellhound, Lion-Mane, Mäuschen, Primeape, and Zebra-Man). The Cheetah manhandles Trevor using Wonder Woman&#x27;s lasso. Steve Trevor manages to overcome the lasso and explains that only Diana could use it, as she was herself truthful and pure. As the Cheetah is not that, Trevor manages to get the lasso off and onto the Cheetah. While Killer Frost escapes and freezes the Cheetah&#x27;s Menagerie, Steve Trevor knocks the Cheetah out.

====DC Rebirth====
After the events of DC Rebirth, the Cheetah&#x27;s origin was altered once more. As a young girl, Barbara Cavendish enjoyed mythology and showed an affinity for languages. Her father disparaged her interest in mythology, deriding it as childish. In defiance of her father, her passion for myth and legend remained and as an adult, she changed her surname to Minerva in honor of her late mother. By age 26, she had mastered seven languages and earned two PhDs in archaeology. On a dig in Ukraine, she discovered proof of the existence of the Amazons, but the dig site collapsed and was abandoned. Minerva was able to take photos before the collapse and continued her investigation until she found herself at a dead end when she reached a seemingly deserted island in the Black Sea. After Princess Diana of the Amazons returned U.S. Navy SEAL Steve Trevor to the United States, the Navy assigned Dr. Minerva to translate for Diana as she spoke only the Amazonian language. Minerva became close friends with Diana and her minder, Lt. Etta Candy, and with her help, Diana learned English and several other languages. After the war god Ares attacks the naval base where Diana is staying and several of the Olympian Gods (in the forms of animals) assist Diana in defeating him, Minerva became even more obsessed with the divine. Seeking out proof of other deities, Minerva learns of Urzkartaga and obtains funding for an expedition to the fictional African nation of Bwunda from industrialist Veronica Cale. Unbeknownst to Minerva, Cale was acting on behalf of the sons of Ares, Deimos and Phobos, who intend to turn Minerva into a demigod like Diana so she can help them locate Themyscira. Diana provides Minerva with a Wayne Enterprises GPS signaling device in case she needed help, which Doctor Cyber, a secret ally of Ares, remotely disabled. As a result, Wonder Woman was unable to prevent Minerva from being &quot;wed&quot; to Urzkartaga and undergoing a ritual to become the Cheetah. Blaming Diana for letting her be transformed into a beast consumed by bloodlust and cannibalistic urges, the Cheetah joined Cale&#x27;s Godwatch group.

Years later, Wonder Woman traveled to Bwunda in search of her old friend. She was met with aggression from the Cult of Urzkartaga, a pack of were-hyenas, and ultimately the Cheetah herself. The battle continued until Wonder Woman revealed to the Cheetah that she was unable to locate Themyscira and needed her enemy&#x27;s help. In exchange for Minerva&#x27;s assistance in finding Themyscira, Wonder Woman agreed to kill Urzkartaga to restore Minerva&#x27;s humanity. The pair battled their way through Urzkartaga&#x27;s Bouda (were-hyena) minions and defeated Andres Cadulo, a worshiper of Urzkartaga that planned to sacrifice Steve Trevor to the plant god. Minerva then learned that she had not been turned into the Cheetah because she wasn&#x27;t a virgin, which turned out to be a lie told to her by Urzkartaga. The Cheetah and the women before her were actually his wardens, charged with keeping the evil plant god imprisoned. Cheetah used the Lasso of Truth to bind the plant god back into a harmless plant form and prevent his escape. She then became human once again and agreed to help Wonder Woman find her way back to Paradise Island.

Shortly thereafter, Minerva and Etta Candy, who at that point were in a loving relationship, were attacked by Godwatch. After reuniting with Steve Trevor, Minerva and Candy were again attacked by Godwatch, and Minerva ultimately surrendered to them in the hopes of reasoning with Cale. Cale, having taken possession of the Urzkartaga plant, threatened to have Candy and Trevor killed unless Minerva agreed to become the Cheetah again. Cale then flew them and her daughter Isadore (whose soul the sons of Ares had stolen to force Cale to do their bidding) to the island in the Black Sea that Minerva had mistaken for Themyscira. Wonder Woman and Trevor arrived and fought the Cheetah and Cale until Diana&#x27;s blood opened a gateway to Ares&#x27; prison. Diana, Cale, and Isadore went through the gateway, leaving the Cheetah and Trevor behind. By the time they returned, the Cheetah had gone into hiding, only coming out when everyone had left. Approaching the gate to Ares&#x27; prison, she begged to be let in but was rebuffed. Enraged by the gods&#x27; rejection, the Cheetah swore revenge against them and the Amazons. She later went to Cale&#x27;s home and, stating that she is content with being the Cheetah, attacks Cale. Diana intervenes and subdues her, but the Cheetah escapes custody shortly thereafter, her friendship with Diana broken for good.

Shortly after, Lex Luthor recruited the Cheetah into his new Legion of Doom. She accompanied Luthor, the Joker, Sinestro, Black Manta, and Gorilla Grodd as they ambushed Vandal Savage&#x27;s hideout. As a member of the Legion of Doom, Cheetah hunted down and killed the sea god Poseidon. She was later given the mythical &quot;God Killer&quot;, a sword able to kill even the strongest of the Olympian Gods. She used the God Killer to strike down Wonder Woman&#x27;s patron goddess Aphrodite. With the loss of Aphrodite&#x27;s influence, the weakened Wonder Woman was easily defeated by Cheetah.

After a series of battles, Wonder Woman managed to defeat Cheetah and destroy the God Killer blade. As punishment, Cheetah was condemned to imprisonment in Doom&#x27;s Doorway, a prison deep beneath Themyscira. The mysterious Dark Fates then freed Cheetah, who went on a killing spree throughout Themyscira. With Hera&#x27;s assistance, Wonder Woman defeated Cheetah using the Lasso of Truth.

Cheetah later recruited the Queen of Fables into creating a perfect storybook world where she would be known as Queen Cheetah. Deathstroke was hired to travel to Cheetah&#x27;s storybook world and bring her into custody. Deathstroke battled his way through Cheetah&#x27;s feline forces and confronted her. While Cheetah easily overpowered Deathstroke, the assassin ultimately destroyed the magical page which ended Cheetah&#x27;s fantasy world. In exchange for her release, Cheetah provided information about the villainous organization T.R.U.S.T., then returned to the Legion of Doom.

During &quot;Dark Crisis&quot;, Cheetah and many other members of the Legion of Doom were possessed by the Great Darkness.

At some point, Cheetah was captured by Veronica Cale&#x27;s company and brought to Brazil where she was brainwashed into becoming a feral creature. Wonder Woman rescued Cheetah and used her magic lasso to restore Barbara&#x27;s intellect. With her humanity restored, Cheetah temporarily joined Checkmate to help Wonder Woman defeat Hera&#x27;s forces.

Soon after the United States government turned on the Amazons and formed the Amazon Extradition Entity (A.X.E.), Cheetah was captured by the mysterious Sovereign, the secretive king of America. The Sovereign imprisoned Cheetah on an unspecified island. After several failed attempts to break Wonder Woman, the Sovereign left the amazon princess on the same island as Cheetah, hoping that the starved monster would accomplish what he could not. Cheetah battled Wonder Woman for several days and ultimately defeated her. However, Cheetah spared her life when Wonder Woman stated that she felt hope and love for Cheetah. Later that night, Cheetah bonded with Wonder Woman over their mutual love/hate relationship. She then agreed to assist Wonder Woman and her allies against the Sovereign, who noted that the relationship between the two archenemies is more complicated than that of Batman&#x27;s with the Joker or Superman&#x27;s with Lex Luthor.

===Sebastian Ballesteros===

Argentine business tycoon Sebastian Ballesteros becomes the fourth Cheetah, as well as the only male Cheetah. He is an agent of the Amazon&#x27;s enemy, Circe, as well as her lover. He seeks the plant god Urzkartaga to become a new version of Cheetah, a supernatural cat-creature like Barbara Minerva. Appealing to Urzkartaga&#x27;s ego, Sebastian makes the case that the previous Cheetahs have failed in their actions and that a male Cheetah could be superior. Once Urzkartaga is convinced, Minerva&#x27;s access to the Cheetah is cut off and Sebastian is given the power in her place. Later, Sebastian proves responsible for turning Wonder Woman&#x27;s old friend, Vanessa Kapatelis, into the third Silver Swan. Angered at the loss of her powers, Minerva battles Ballesteros for control of the Cheetah&#x27;s power by becoming the temporary host of Tisiphone. Minerva kills Sebastian, regains her powers, and gives Sebastian&#x27;s blood to Urzkartaga as a sacrifice.

Sebastian does not appear following &quot;The New 52&quot; reboot.

==Powers and abilities==
The Barbara Minerva and Sebastian Ballesteros incarnations of Cheetah exhibit similar abilities. Their basic attributes consist of enhanced strength and speed on par with Wonder Woman, as well as heightened senses of smell and hearing for hunts and night vision for stealth. Their reflexes and agility are similarly augmented, allowing them superior gymnastic abilities for inhuman mobility. These superhuman traits allow them to challenge Wonder Woman in physical battles. Additionally, their fangs and claws are preternaturally sharp and strong. While the two more modern incarnations of Cheetah possess superhuman powers, the earlier versions of Priscilla Rich and Deborah Domaine do not.

Originally only able to change during a full moon and remaining weak and frail in her human body, Barbara Minerva was chemically enhanced by the sorceress Circe to remain in her Cheetah body indefinitely and change at will. This also gave her dominion over all species of felines. In &quot;The New 52&quot; continuity, Barbara Minerva is shown to pierce Superman&#x27;s invulnerable skin with her fangs just as easily as if he were human. Additionally, her bite transfers some of her powers into her victims, turning them into feline hybrids under her control.

== Cultural impact and legacy ==
Every since her first appearance, Cheetah has been refer to as most iconic Wonder Woman villain. Abraham Josephine Riesman of &quot;The Vulture&quot; referred to her as an Big Deal stating &quot;she’s one of the all-time most iconic Wonder Woman foes. She’s ubiquitous and colorful enough to possibly be defined as Diana’s Joker. Case in point: When the legendary Challenge of the Super Friends DC cartoon aired back in the day, WW’s counterpart on the Legion of Doom was Cheetah, confirming her archnemesis status&quot;. Sarah Moran of &quot;Screen Rant&quot; stated &quot;Ares isn&#x27;t Diana&#x27;s most iconic villain, he isn&#x27;t her Joker or Lex Luthor. That would be Cheetah, Rachel Leishman of &quot;The Mary Sue&quot; wrote, &quot;Minerva is a fun villain in general because she often connects with people like Lex Luthor or the Joker to come after our heroes, and while neither of them are in 1984, it could set up future connections between the Superman and Batman villains and Cheetah as DC’s interconnected movie universe finds its path forward. The more I look at Wiig as Cheetah, though, the more I’m concerned that I’m going to end up really loving her as the villain&quot;.

<text>The Gateway Sports and Entertainment Complex is an entertainment complex located in downtown area of Cleveland, Ohio It opened in 1994 and is owned by the city of Cleveland and Cuyahoga County and is managed by the Gateway Economic Development Corporation, a non-profit group with board members who are appointed by county and city leaders.

The complex mainly consists of Progressive Field, a 34,830-seat baseball park that serves as home of the Cleveland Guardians of Major League Baseball, and Rocket Arena, a 19,432-seat arena primarily the home of the Cleveland Cavaliers of the National Basketball Association. In addition, the complex includes a transitional space known as Gateway Plaza and the Gateway East parking garage.

Gateway is roughly bounded by East 9th Street to the east, Huron Road to the north, Ontario Street to the west, and Carnegie Avenue to the south, and forms the basis of the larger Gateway District of downtown Cleveland.

The two facilities are connected to Tower City Center and the RTA Rapid Transit system via an underground walkway.

==Facilities==
[[file:Jacobs Field Cleveland.JPG|thumb|1999 aerial view of the complex and [[downtown Cleveland|downtown area]] of [[Cleveland, Ohio]
[[Progressive Field]] was completed first, opening on April 4, 1994, as Jacobs Field. It cost approximately $175 million to build, of which $91 million, or 52%, came from Indians owner [[Richard Jacobs (businessman)|Richard E. Jacobs]]. The remaining $84 million, or 48%, was from a 15-year [[sin tax]]. It was designed by HOK Sport (now known as [[Populous (architects)|Populous]]), a division of [[Hellmuth, Obata and Kassabaum]]. HOK designed it as a [[Baseball park#Retro-modern ballparks|retro-modern ballpark]], similar to their just-completed [[Oriole Park at Camden Yards]] in Baltimore, with asymmetrical fences of varying heights, a smaller upper deck, and stepped tiers. The ballpark was situated in a way that would showcase Cleveland&#x27;s downtown skyline.

[[Rocket Mortgage FieldHouse|Rocket Arena]], originally named Gund Arena and later known as Quicken Loans Arena and Rocket Mortgage FieldHouse, has dimensions of long by wide by high (). It was designed by [[Ellerbe Becket]] Sports &amp; Venue and Robert P. Madison International Inc., a local architectural firm. Similar to the ballpark&#x27;s downtown views, the arena has a by bay window that faces southeast and shows off the city&#x27;s industrial [[The Flats|Flats]]. The construction and engineering were completed by an integrated team from Ellerbe Becket. The underground service area can accommodate 26 tour buses. It was built for approximately $152 million and opened on October 17, 1994.

Gateway Plaza is multifunctional open space situated between Rocket Arena to the north, Ontario Street to the west, Gateway East parking garage to the west, and Progressive Field to the south. However, it is technically bordered by Bolivar Road, Ontario Street, East 6th Street, and Larry Doby Way. It is primarily concrete roadway, but it does features decorative industrial art pieces and limited green space. On game days, it frequently hosts on-location radio and television broadcasts, along with [[satellite truck]]s for TV broadcast [[uplink]]s, as well as other game-related events. Some events for the [[1997 MLB All-Star Game]] Fan Fest were held in Gateway Plaza.
The complex was built with two parking garages, which can hold a combined 3,300 cars. On the north end of the complex is the Jack Parking Garage, previously the Gateway North garage. It is a rectangular-shaped structure, with its main entrance on Ontario Street and another two on High Street. Originally, a third floor enclosed walkway above Huron Road connected its southeast corner to Rocket Arena, but this was removed in 2018 as part of a major renovation project on the arena. A second enclosed walkway was built in 2013 on the northwest corner of the garage that connects to [[Jack Cleveland Casino]]. The city of Cleveland built a downtown [[bike station]] in this garage in 2011. That same year, the facility was sold to Rock Caesar&#x27;s Ohio and renovated to include a valet service and to serve as the main parking area for the casino. The garage is still available for events at Gateway, though is managed by the casino.

In between Rocket Arena and Progressive Field is the Gateway East garage, an L-shaped structure with two elevated walkways. A third floor enclosed walkway above East 6th Street connects on its western side to the arena, while an open walkway on the south side of the garage connects to the ballpark above Larry Doby Way. Originally there was an additional walkway over Larry Doby Way to the ballpark, but it was removed in 2014 during renovations to Progressive Field. The Gateway East Garage main entrance is on Huron Road, with a season-ticket holders entrance at East 6th and Bolivar and another at East 7th and Bolivar. It is managed by Standard Parking.

==History==

===Greater Cleveland Dome Stadium Corporation===
The Gateway complex had its genesis in the early 1980s. The city of Cleveland had longed to bring the Cavaliers back to Cleveland since the team left for the [[Richfield Coliseum]] in 1974. Moreover, the Browns and Indians were housed in [[Cleveland Stadium]], which was costing the city money in a time when it could ill-afford it. A major-league caliber sporting facility hadn&#x27;t been built in Cleveland itself since the now-demolished [[Cleveland Arena]] opened in 1937.

A multipurpose dome would be the new home to the Browns and Indians, and would attract the Cavaliers back to Cleveland, according to the original proposal by County Commissioner Vincent Campanella. The concept was modeled after the [[Pontiac Silverdome]], then home to the [[Detroit Lions]]. Browns owner [[Art Modell]] backed the domed stadium idea, as did Ohio Governor [[Dick Celeste]], however, he did not like funding the project with property taxes. On May 8, 1984, a ballot initiative for the $150 million dome stadium went down in defeat by a 2-1 margin. In 1985, another dome called Hexatron, a six-sided structure with a [[retractable roof]] designed by local architect Robert Corna, was proposed but never left the drafting table. The proposed funding for Hexatron would be a [[sin tax]] on alcohol and cigarettes in [[Cuyahoga County]], an idea floated by a young member of the [[Ohio House of Representatives]] named [[Jeff Jacobs|Jeffery P. Jacobs]], the son of the future Indians owner [[Richard Jacobs (businessman)|Richard E. Jacobs]].

Still, Cleveland Mayor [[George Voinovich]] and Governor Celeste pushed forward to create the Greater Cleveland Dome Stadium Corporation, borrowing $22 million from banks and the state of Ohio. Cleveland Tomorrow, a group of top executives from Cleveland&#x27;s biggest firms, launched a development fund to further the project, and acquisition of property began in December 1985. By 1989, the site of the former Central Market, a fruit and vegetable market that dated back to 1856, and other adjacent buildings were razed and made into parking lots. However, there were funding gaps and big disagreements as to who would pay to build the project, along with a change in leadership.

===Ballot Issue 2===
In 1990, new leadership took the baton from the dome stadium group. The team was a partnership of Cleveland Tomorrow, led by lawyer [[Tom Chema]], and a group of elected officials. The group included newly elected Mayor [[Michael R. White (politician)|Michael R. White]], newly elevated [[Cleveland City Council]] President [[Jay Westbrook]], along with Cuyahoga County Commissioners [[Tim Hagan]], Virgil Brown, [[Mary O. Boyle|Mary Boyle]], and [[Jim Petro]]. The group hastily coordinated a plan to finance the complex by asking county voters for a 15-year sin tax, styled after the Hexatron plan. The tax, which amounted to 1.9 cents on a can of beer, 1.5 cents per ounce of liquor, and 4.5 cents on a pack of cigarettes, would be a way get suburban county voters to pay for the project. But it required a countywide vote, which added it to the May primary election ballot as &quot;Issue 2&quot; in the hopes that it would pass with the normally light turnout.

There was heavy advertising both for and against Issue 2. There was also a [[1990 Major League Baseball lockout|Major League Baseball lockout]] in February 1990 over player salaries. It directly threatened weaker teams, such as the Indians, that did not have the cushion of additional revenues from luxury boxes and other stadium amenities. Just days before the vote, baseball commissioner [[Fay Vincent]] attended a city council finance committee meeting and stated, &quot;should the vote [on Issue 2] be a negative one, we may find ourselves confronting a subject we want to avoid.&quot;

These factors helped drive a large turnout, as 49.6% of registered voters cast ballots. On May 8, 1990, Issue 2 passed by a slim 51% margin (198,390-185,209). A month later, Mayor White and Commissioner Hagan created Gateway [[Economic Development Corporation]], a non-profit organization, and installed Chema as its executive director.

Both venues were completed in 1994. Todd Greathouse is the current executive director of the Gateway Economic Development Corporation.

<text>Warren White is a professor emeritus, and a former Research Oceanographer at the Marine Biological Research Division at Scripps Institution of Oceanography at UC San Diego.

White, with &#x27;Buzz&#x27; Bernstein, was instrumental in the development and operation of the TRANSPAC XBT Volunteer Observing Ship program. Between 1976 and 1984, commercial ships crossing the Pacific Ocean recorded expendable bathythermograph (XBT) data. This data became instrumental in a number of studies, particularly around the Kuroshio Current. As well as its direct oceanographic value, this data was also important for determining the scale of features of interest, thus influencing the design of later observational networks.

His research interests included:
* Planetary wave dynamics
* Interdecadal oscillations and their relation to El Niño and La Niña
* Global climate change
* Coupled ocean-atmosphere interaction

He is known for his work on the Antarctic Circumpolar Wave.

<text>Pál Maléter (4 September 1917 – 16 June 1958) was the military leader of the 1956 Hungarian Revolution.

Maléter was born to Hungarian parents in Eperjes, a city in Sáros County, in the northern part of Kingdom of Hungary, today Prešov, Slovakia. He studied medicine at the Charles University, Prague, before moving to Budapest in 1938, going to the military academy there. He fought on the Eastern Front of World War II for the Axis, until captured by the Red Army. He became a communist, trained in sabotage, fought against the Germans in Transylvania and was sent back to Hungary, where he was noted for his courage and daring. In 1945 he joined the Hungarian Communist Party.

In 1956 he was a Colonel and served with the General Staff in Budapest when during the Hungarian Uprising he was sent to relieve a unit at the Kilian barracks with some tanks and a company of officer cadets. However, only Maléter&#x27;s tank arrived at the barracks, and with the permission of his superiors, he agreed to a cease-fire with the insurgent groups in the area. Later (the exact time of this is disputed) he switched to the insurgents&#x27; side, helping them to defend the Kilian Barracks against Soviet troops. He was the most prominent member of the Hungarian military to change sides, allying himself with the insurgents, rather than with Ernő Gerő&#x27;s communist government.

As the chief military presence on the insurgents&#x27; side, he came into contact with the new government and on 29 October, he was appointed Minister of Defense, and was promoted to Major General on 2 November. On 3 November, he went to Tököl, located near Budapest, to negotiate with the Soviet military forces based there. During discussions on the following day, and against international law, Soviet officers arrested Maléter at the conference and imprisoned him.

He was executed, along with Imre Nagy and others, in a Budapest prison on 16 June 1958 on charges of attempting to overthrow the Hungarian People&#x27;s Republic. His first wife and three children went to the U.S. in the wake of the uprising, and his second wife remained in Hungary. Both wives subsequently remarried. His only son, Pál Maléter II (1946 – January 4, 2017), was trained at the Hotchkiss School and Columbia University before becoming an architect in the United States Department of Veterans Affairs.

In June 1989, on the anniversary of their deaths, Imre Nagy, Pál Maléter, three others who had died in prison and a sixth empty coffin, symbolising all those who had died, were formally reburied in Budapest with full honours. He was also promoted to Colonel General posthumously.

A pine cultivar has been named after him, a dwarf variety. Maléter was known for his great height; according to historian Victor Sebestyen, Maléter was &quot;more than two meters tall&quot;, or at least six feet eight inches ().

<text>The Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS) is a program of the Australian Government that subsidises prescription medication for Australian citizens and permanent residents, as well as international visitors covered by a reciprocal health care agreement. The PBS is separate to the Medicare Benefits Schedule, a list of health care services that can be claimed under Medicare, Australia&#x27;s universal health care insurance scheme.

The out-of-pocket amount for some medications has increased since 1960, with increased subsidies for concession holders beginning in 1983. Safety nets were introduced in 2000 and expanded in 2004, limiting the total out-of-pocket expense singles or families would pay per year for health care in Australia.

==History==
In 1944, the Curtin Labor government passed the &quot;Pharmaceutical Benefits Act 1944&quot; as part of a wider plan to create a British-style National Health Service. The Act was an extension of the similar Repatriation Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme established in 1919 for Australian servicemen and women who had served in the Boer War and World War I. The Act provided for free pharmaceuticals, with benefits restricted to medicines listed in the Commonwealth Pharmaceutical Formulary, and only on the presentation of a prescription, written by a registered medical practitioner on an official government form, to a Commonwealth approved pharmacist. A Formulary Committee was established with the role of advising the Minister on the composition of the formulary. The committee was a precursor to the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee.

However, the Australian Branch of the British Medical Association (BMA) challenged the Act and the High Court of Australia in &quot;Attorney-General (Vic) ex rel Dale v Commonwealth&quot;. declared the Act unconstitutional on the basis that the Commonwealth did not have the power to spend money on the provision of medicines. The decision prompted the 1946 referendum which amended the Constitution to allow for Commonwealth provision of pharmaceutical benefits. A new &quot;Pharmaceutical Benefits Act 1947&quot; was subsequently passed. However, ongoing resistance by the medical profession forced amendments to provisions that required practitioners to use Commonwealth prescription forms or face a fine. Again the BMA challenged the Act and again the High Court found it unconstitutional. In November 1947, under Section 15 of the 1947 Act, the Commonwealth made arrangements to supply free products for immunisation against diphtheria and whooping cough. Despite the High Court finding, the Commonwealth attempted to implement the scheme with voluntary participation. However, only few doctors participated. The PBS commenced on 1 July 1948.

Finally, the High Court in October 1949 ruled that the PBS was constitutional in &quot;British Medical Association v Commonwealth&quot; (1949).

With the election of the Menzies Liberal government in December 1949, the comprehensive scheme proposed under the 1947 Act was altered to limit the PBS list to 139 &#x27;life saving and disease preventing drugs&#x27;. The new regulations came into force on 4 September 1950. Changes to PBS were introduced on 1 March 1960 by the &quot;National Health Act No. 72 1959&quot;, which combined the existing pensioner and general schemes, expanded the range of drugs for the general public, and introduced a patient contribution (or co-payment) of 5 shillings to provide some control on volumes and expenditure. Despite the introduction of the co-payments, prescription volumes increased from 24.6 million in 1959/60, to 60.4 million in 1968/69, and Commonwealth expenditure rose from $43 million to $100 million at the end of the decade.

By 2003 the number of drugs included under the scheme had expanded to 601 general products which were marketed as 2,602 different brands. The scheme was appealing to policy makers because it required no major capital works program and could be implemented immediately without lengthy consultation with the medical profession.

==Operations==

PBS is governed by the &quot;National Health Act 1953&quot; and &quot;National Health (Pharmaceutical Benefits) Regulations 1960 (Cth)&quot;. Pharmaceutical benefits under PBS may only be supplied by pharmacists and medical practitioners approved under the Act.

Applications to list a drug on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Schedule are administered by the Department of Health. Pharmaceutical benefits under the PBS are administered by Medicare Australia (formerly the Health Insurance Commission) under the &quot;Health Insurance Act 1973 (Cth)&quot;.

A benefit under PBS is only given on medications which are listed in the Pharmaceutical Benefits Schedule. The medication may be listed for general use as an unrestricted benefit, or for a specific indication as a restricted benefit. When a PBS medication is dispensed by a pharmacist, the patient pays the patient contribution (subject to concessions and safety nets) and Medicare Australia pays the remainder of the agreed cost of the medication to the pharmacist.

The cost of a medication is negotiated between the government, through the Department of Health, and the supplier of the drug. The agreed price becomes the basis of the dispensed price of the medication which is negotiated between the government and the Pharmacy Guild of Australia under the current Community Pharmacy Agreement. The dispensed price includes the wholesaler&#x27;s markup, pharmacist&#x27;s markup, and a dispensing fee. Pharmacies purchase PBS-listed drugs from the wholesaler or supplier, and claim the difference between the dispensed price and the patient co-payment contribution from Medicare Australia.

===Patient contribution and safety net===
When purchasing a medication under PBS the maximum price a patient pays is the patient contribution (also called a co-payment or out-of-pocket cost), which in 2019 was A$40.30 for general patients. For PBS medications costing less than $40.30, the patient pays the PBS dispensed price plus an additional $1.17 safety net recording fee plus an optional pharmacy charge of $4.33 or less, provided that the total charge does not exceed $40.30.

Concessional patients – i.e., low-income earners, welfare recipients, Health Care Card holders, etc. and those covered under the Repatriation Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (RPBS) – pay a patient contribution of $6.50 in 2019. Patient contributions are compulsory and cannot be discounted by pharmacies.

Safety net provisions in PBS reduce patient contributions when singles and families exceed in a calendar year the PBS safety net threshold: when a general patient reaches the general PBS threshold, their co-payment reduces to the concession price for the remainder of that calendar year; while concession patients who reach the concession PBS threshold do not pay anything on PBS medications for the remainder of the year. The PBS safety net is separate from and in addition to the Medicare safety nets.

Changes in patient contributions and the safety net over the years are as follows:

===Foreign visitors===
PBS subsidised medications are also available to foreign visitors whose countries have entered into a Reciprocal Health Care Agreement with Australia. These countries are the United Kingdom, Ireland, New Zealand, Malta, Italy, Sweden, the Netherlands, Finland, Norway, Belgium and Slovenia. Eligible foreign visitors must produce a passport to obtain subsidised medications.

===2012 Price drop===
The biggest cuts on prices of medicines occurred from 1 April 2012 under the Gillard Labor government. This reduced the price of some medicines to below the PBS general copayment amount resulting in cost savings for Australians.

=== 2023 Safety net and copayment reductions ===
In 2013 the Abbott government was elected and the Liberal Party remained in office until 2022. Through the term that the Liberal party held office, copayment prices steadily increased to be $42.50 and $6.80 general and concession respectively by 2022. 

In May 2022 the Albanese government was elected and rapidly implemented changes to the PBS as a cost of living measure. On 1 July the safety net thresholds were reduced. 

In October 2022, a legislative amendment was passed to reduce the general copayment to $30 from 1 January 2023; there was no reduction to the concession copayment. Despite the changes being announced to assist Australians with the cost of living amid rising interest rates and the general copayment rate reduced to be 20% lower than when Labor last held office in 2013, the concession rate remained 19% higher than it had been in 2013. 

The 1 January 2023 general copayment reduction was the first decrease since the inception of the PBS.

==Integrity and cost containment measures==

===Safety net 20-day rule===
In an effort to limit the cost of PBS by discouraging patients from filling PBS prescriptions earlier than needed, in 2009 the safety net 20-day rule was brought in. Under the rule, a repeat prescription supplied within 20 days of a previous supply of the same medicine will not count towards the PBS safety net threshold. If the patient has already reached the safety net threshold, they will be charged the normal patient contribution instead of the reduced safety net amount.

===Brand Premium and generic medicines===
In an effort to limit the cost of PBS, in July 2007 the Australian Government introduced brand premiums on medications where cheaper generic brands were available. The Brand Premium is usually the price difference between the innovator brand and the generic brand. The patient pays the Brand Premium in addition to the normal patient contribution if they decline to purchase the generic brand. The Brand Premium paid does not count toward either safety net threshold and must still be paid even after the threshold is reached.

Pharmacists are allowed to substitute generic brands for prescribed brands if the brands are flagged &quot;a&quot; in the Schedule of Pharmaceutical Benefits, and if consent is obtained from the patient and prescriber. The prescriber&#x27;s consent is always assumed to be granted unless &quot;brand substitution not permitted&quot; is indicated on the prescription.

The &quot;National Health Act 1953 (Cth)&quot; divided the PBS formulary into an F1 category (for patented, single brand medicines) and an F2 category (for generic medicines) with reduced reference pricing between them. Academic opinion is divided about the value of these changes and the extent to which they arose from industry lobbying drawing strength from Annex 2C of the AUSFTA.

===Therapeutic Group Premium===
On 1 February 1998, another effort to limit the cost of the PBS involved the introduction of Therapeutic Group Premiums (TGPs) on medications that are priced significantly above the cheapest medication in a defined therapeutic sub-group where the drugs are considered to be of similar safety and efficacy. The TGP is the price difference between the premium brand and the benchmark (base) price for drugs in the class. The patient must pay this TGP in addition to the normal patient co-payment contribution if they have been prescribed such a medication. The TGP paid does not count toward the Safety Net threshold.

However, a prescriber may obtain an exemption from the TGP if:
* adverse effects occurring with all of the base-priced drugs; or
* drug interactions occurring with all of the base-priced drugs; or
* drug interactions expected to occur with all of the base-priced drugs; or
* transfer to a base-priced drug would cause patient confusion resulting in problems with compliance.

Such an exemption requires an approved PBS Authority prescription from Medicare Australia.

===Need for Medicare card===
Since 2002, a Medicare card has been required to be shown at a pharmacy when collecting PBS medications. The pharmacy can retain the card number for use when the cardholder returns with another prescription.

===Prescription Shopping Programme===
The Prescription Shopping Programme (PSP) has been set up to identify patients who may be getting more PBS subsidised medicines than they need, which is also related to “doctor shopping”. The programme identifies patients who, in any 3-month period, receive:
* any PBS items prescribed by 6 or more different prescribers
* a total of 25 or more PBS target items
* a total of 50 or more items. This includes PBS items both target and non-target, supplied to the patient.

==Schedule of Pharmaceutical Benefits==
The Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee (PBAC) makes recommendations to the Minister for Health and Ageing regarding drugs which should be made available as pharmaceutical benefits, which are listed on the Schedule of Pharmaceutical Benefits. The Schedule is published monthly since January 2007, (prior to this it was published three times a year).

In considering a medication for listing on the PBS, the PBAC considers factors including:
* The conditions for which the drug has been approved for use in Australia by the Therapeutic Goods Administration. The PBAC only recommends the listing of a medicine for use in a condition which is in accordance with the Australian Register of Therapeutic Goods.
* The conditions in which use has been demonstrated to be effective and safe compared to other therapies.
* The costs involved. The PBAC is required to ensure that the money that the community spends in subsidising the PBS represents cost-effective expenditure of taxpayers&#x27; funds.
* A range of other factors and health benefits. These factors may include, for example, costs of hospitalisation or other alternative medical treatments that may be required, as well as less tangible factors such as patients&#x27; quality of life.

Decisions on PBS listing are generally made on a health economics perspective, using cost-effectiveness analysis. Cost-effectiveness analysis evaluates the cost and health effects of one technology versus the cost and health effects of another technology, which is usually standard of care. A new technology whose incremental health benefit justifies its additional expense is deemed to be cost-effective and thus reimbursed by PBAC. Drugs that provide little health benefit at considerable additional expense, such as the PDE5 inhibitors (e.g. sildenafil) and certain expensive cancer chemotherapy drugs are not listed on the basis of poor cost-effectiveness. Nonetheless, cost-effectiveness may not be the decisive factor. For example, for a drug that is the only available treatment for a severe illness, listing may be recommended on the basis of the &quot;rule of rescue&quot;. The principles that are applied during the evaluation of drugs for PBS listing are described in the PBAC Guidelines.

===Unrestricted benefits===
Drugs that have unrestricted benefit listing on the PBS are available for general use without being limited to particular indications. Such items are typically those whose use in clinical practice is widely accepted. Examples include methotrexate, prednisone and amoxycillin.

===Restricted benefits===
Certain medications listed on the PBS are available only for specific therapeutic indications or to patients meeting specific criteria where the PBAC has deemed that the cost-benefit analysis is favourable only in those indications/patients. These are noted as &quot;restricted benefits&quot; on the Schedule. Medicare Australia places the onus of policing restricted benefits on the prescribers themselves and the pharmacists dispensing (unless the listing is also &#x27;Authority Required&#x27;). For example, the COX-2 inhibitor celecoxib is listed on the PBS as a restricted benefit for the symptomatic treatment of osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis. Prescribers using celecoxib for other indications are expected to indicate &quot;non-PBS&quot; on the prescription, and/or the pharmacist dispensing the celecoxib should charge the patient the full cost.

===Authority required benefits===
Some PBS medications are restricted and require prior approval from Medicare Australia. These are noted as &quot;authority required benefits&quot; on the Schedule. Again, the PBAC has deemed that the cost-benefit analysis is favourable only under in specific indications/patients under certain circumstances. Authority may be obtained by telephone to Medicare Australia (known as &quot;phone approval&quot;) or in writing from an authorised delegate of the Minister for Health. Prescriptions must be written on an Authority Prescription Form, and the approval number must be noted on the prescription. Pharmacists cannot dispense the item as a pharmaceutical benefit unless it has been approved by Medicare Australia (indicated by the presence of the approval number).

In obtaining a phone approval, the doctor simply identifies themselves (using their name and provider number), the patient (using their Medicare number), and when asked by the operator, confirms which of the conditions eligible for an authority the patient is suffering from. Medicare normally accepts the doctor&#x27;s assertion that the condition exists as sufficient. For a written Authority however, evidence of diagnosis and patient eligibility criteria such a pathology test results are usually required.

Some drugs may have Authority Required (Streamlined) status which does not require an explicit approval from Medicare, instead the doctor can use the Authority code found in the published Schedule for a given drug/indication.

===2016 removal of medications ===
In 2016, 17 types of medication were removed from the PBS, including Panadol Osteo, aspirin, iron/folic supplements, electrolytes, and laxatives. Other medications include medication for reflux, skin allergies, antacids, urine test strips, and Vitamin B12 injections. The change is expected to save approximately $87 million a year.

== Prescribers who can write PBS-subsidised prescriptions ==
Medical practitioners, dentists, optometrists, midwives and nurse practitioners who are registered with the Australian Health Practitioner Regulation Agency (AHPRA) can write PBS-subsidised prescriptions. Pharmacists can prescribe scheduled medicines, but these are not subsidised by the PBS. Podiatrists can prescribe from an authorised list of medicines, but these are also not available on the PBS.

==Sustainability==
According to the Department of Health Annual Report, the cost of the PBS in 2014-15 was $9.1 billion. According to a report by the Australian Productivity Commission the PBS is expected to cost 2.6% of Australia&#x27;s GDP by 2045 up from 0.7% in 2005. Further attempts to restrain the growth in costs of the PBS may be needed, however, attempts to increase consumer prices of drugs have always proved politically unpopular. The comparative cost-effectiveness processes of the PBS nonetheless ensure it provides Australian citizens with more equitable access to medicines than in many other developed nations and for many the issue of sustainability of the PBS as a key component of the egalitarian architecture of Australian society is equivalent to asking whether that nation&#x27;s education system or defence forces are sustainable.

Former federal Treasurer Peter Costello and the Liberal Party attempted to raise the patient co-payment of PBS medicines by up to 30 per cent in the 2002 Federal Budget, however this measure was blocked in the Senate in which various minor parties held the balance of power. However, in June 2004 the main opposition party, the Australian Labor Party, announced that it would allow the PBS co-payment increases to proceed through the Senate.

===The Grattan Institute Report March 2013===
Grattan Institute Health Program released a report titled &quot;Australia’s bad drug deal&quot; by Dr Stephen Duckett, in which he states that Australia&#x27;s Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme pays at least $1.3 billion a year too much for prescription drugs. New Zealand, which has capped its budget and appointed independent experts to make decisions through the Pharmaceutical Management Agency (Pharmac), pays a sixth as much as the PBS for the same drugs. Public hospitals in two Australian states pay much lower prices than the PBS. In one case, the prices are just a sixth of PBS prices. In one extreme example the report states that &quot;The price of one drug, Olanzapine, is 64 times higher on the PBS than in Western Australian public hospitals&quot;. This report proposes three ways Australia can regain its lost leadership in pharmaceutical pricing.

== Research purposes ==
An anonymised 10% sample of all people eligible for medicines subsidised by the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS) are made available for research purposes. Licences are held between Services Australia, who hold the data for the PBS, and academics at Monash University, University of New South Wales, University of South Australia and the University of Western Australia to use the 10% sample for research purposes. Research outputs from these data have to be approved by Services Australia prior to publication. These data create a useful picture of all dispensed medicines in Australia and allow for pharmacovigilance and to explore trends in medicines usage.

<doc id="772992" wikidata="Q3788578" url="?curid=772992" title="Carmen Rasmusen">
<text>Carmen Rasmusen Herbert (born March 25, 1985) is a Canadian-American country music artist who ranked sixth on the second season of &quot;American Idol&quot; in 2003. Rasmusen also plays piano and guitar.

==Early life==
Rasmusen was born on March 25, 1985, in Edmonton and is of Norwegian heritage. She is a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. The second of four children, Rasmusen has been performing in public since the age of five: singing, dancing (including cheerleading, tap, ballet and hip-hop dance), and playing the piano.

She graduated from Woods Cross High School in Northern Utah in 2003, and is an alumna of Brigham Young University.

==&quot;American Idol&quot;==
Rasmusen auditioned initially in Los Angeles and was put through to Hollywood. She was originally eliminated by the judges during the Top 100 stage. In a surprise move, Rasmusen and three other young female singers were brought back to compete in the Wild Card show. No clear reason was made public, but speculation at the time centered on the show&#x27;s producers wanting to provide a greater demographic diversity in the Final 12.

Rasmusen performed &quot;Can&#x27;t Fight the Moonlight&quot; by LeAnn Rimes for her Wild Card performance. Although the judges, including Simon Cowell, opined that it was not a good enough performance to advance, the next night Cowell chose her as his &quot;judge&#x27;s choice&quot; to move into the Top 12. Carmen survived for seven weeks in the finals, earning generally mixed reviews from the judges throughout her stay. Her performances of &quot;You Can&#x27;t Hurry Love&quot; and &quot;Turn the Beat Around&quot; received relatively high marks from both judges and viewers, while her rendition of Blondie&#x27;s &quot;Call Me&quot; during Billboard Number One Hits Night drew brickbats. Judge Randy Jackson was often one of her harshest critics.

Rasmusen was praised by her fans as having a wholesome, girlish appeal and for refusing to wear outfits she thought were inappropriate for her. Fans also cited her on-stage energy and strong vocal projection. Detractors pointed to her recurring difficulty in controlling her natural vibrato and her tendency to yodel when changing registers. She was also one of the most outspoken defenders of the show among the second season finalists in the wake of the scandal involving Corey Clark&#x27;s allegations regarding Paula Abdul.

As the only contestant in the second season under the age of eighteen, she had to spend three hours a day with an on-set tutor. Her mother had to accompany her with the other contestants to the special &quot;American Idol&quot; house, where they all lived during the competition. She also became close friends with season 2 runner-up Clay Aiken.

After her elimination, she went on to appear in numerous shows promoting &quot;American Idol&quot; and she appeared on the last episode of the second season singing with the other finalists. Rasmusen also appeared on the American Idol Season 2: All-Time Classic American Love Songs singing &quot;How Do I Live&quot; by LeAnn Rimes.

In June 2008, Rasmusen starred as one of the headliners for a live music show in Branson, MO, called &quot;America&#x27;s Favorite Finalists&quot;. The show featured six top 12 American Idol Finalists performing their own music, cover songs and group numbers. The show ran at the Grand Palace.

<text>A murder hole or meurtrière is a hole in the ceiling of a gateway or passageway in a fortification through which the defenders could shoot, throw or pour harmful substances or objects such as rocks, arrows, scalding water, hot sand, quicklime, or boiling oil, down on attackers. Boiling oil was rarely used because of its cost. 
==Murder holes and machicolations==
Similar holes, called machicolations, were often located in the curtain walls of castles, fortified manor houses, and city walls. The parapet would project over corbels so that holes would be located over the exterior face of the wall, allowing the defenders to target attackers at the base of the wall. The primary difference between these two features is in their location. Murder holes were located on the interiors of castles and other fortified buildings at the entranceway. Their supposed intention was to discourage (or kill) invaders once they had breached the walls, though it has been suggested that they may have in some cases also facilitated more prosaic activities, such as communication between levels. For example, the murder hole at Audley&#x27;s Castle in County Down, Northern Ireland is located not over the main threshold, but over the entry way to an interior room.
==Location==
In tower houses, often considered aetiologically to be small castles, the most common location for these features is located over the lobby, the effective equivalent of locating them over a gatehouse in a true castle. It bears note that most, if not all, murder holes have only a restricted view of the lobbies below, supporting the idea that other uses may have been common. However, murder holes have been described in a variety of areas within fortified buildings, and there is no completely reliable formula for their placement. The murder hole in Tully Castle, County Fermanagh, Northern Ireland is located in the central portion of the first floor of the house, west of a cross-wall and piercing the vault of the lower chamber.

<doc id="773000" wikidata="Q2699519" url="?curid=773000" title="Roman Candle (album)">
<text>Roman Candle is the debut studio album by American singer-songwriter Elliott Smith. It was recorded in late 1993 and released on July 14, 1994, by record label Cavity Search.

== Background and recording ==
&quot;Roman Candle&quot; was recorded and released while Smith was still in Heatmiser. According to Benjamin Nugent&#x27;s biography &quot;Elliott Smith and the Big Nothing&quot;, Smith recorded the album in the basement of the home of then-girlfriend and Heatmiser manager JJ Gonson.

The album was never intended for release, as Smith only expected to get a deal for a 7-inch single; however, after Gonson played the album for Cavity Search, they immediately requested permission to release it in its entirety. Smith at first hesitated, and then allowed permission.

== Content ==
The album has a raw, homemade sound, with Smith playing each instrument and recording it on his four-track recorder. Additionally, he used a Shure SM57 and an inexpensive RadioShack dynamic microphone to capture the sound.

The front cover features a photograph of Neil Gust (of Heatmiser) and friend Amy Dalsimer, taken by Gonson. Smith chose the image because he &quot;liked the way the picture looked as a &#x27;piece of art&#x27;&quot;.

== Release ==
&quot;Roman Candle&quot; was released on CD and cassette on July 14, 1994.

In 1998, &quot;Roman Candle&quot; was released on vinyl for the first time by Domino Records in the UK only. It later saw vinyl release in the United States in 2010. 

&quot;Roman Candle&quot; was reissued on April 6, 2010, by record label Kill Rock Stars. It was remastered by Larry Crane, with the original mixes by Smith remaining intact. On the official press release on Sweetadeline.net, Crane said of the remaster:

The intention that I had was to make the album more listenable. I felt that a lot of the guitar &quot;squeaks&quot; were jarring and very loud, and that many of the hard consonants and &quot;s&quot; sounds were jarring and scratchy sounding. I felt by reducing these noises that the music would become more inviting and the sound would serve the songs better. When I went to Roger Seibel&#x27;s SAE Mastering, he proceeded to equalize the tracks a small amount and to make the volume slightly louder. We never tried to make this CD as loud as current, over-limited trends, but just to match the volume of the rest of Elliott&#x27;s KRS catalog in a graceful way. Please note that none of this album is &quot;remixed&quot; from the master tapes – it is still composed of the mixes Elliott created himself.

== Reception ==

According to Nugent, the initial response to &quot;Roman Candle&quot; was mixed, with some passing it off as being derivative of Simon &amp; Garfunkel. &quot;The Rocket&quot; wrote that &quot;Smith conveys an all-too convincing anguish, noble, credible and alluring in its understatement.&quot;

&quot;Roman Candle&quot; has since been well received by critics. In its retrospective review, BBC Music opined that the album &quot;remains a searingly honest and decisive collection. As a genesis of exceptional talent it is flawless, and heartbreakingly so.&quot; &quot;Consequence of Sound&quot; called the album &quot;far from a genius effort, but nonetheless an important solo performance pointing towards where his many strengths and few weaknesses as a singer and songwriter were.&quot; &quot;Pitchfork&quot; has described the album&#x27;s musical style as &quot;lo-fi folk&quot;.

<text>James Stephen Baulch (born 3 May 1973) is a retired Welsh sprint athlete and television presenter. He won the 400 metres gold medal at the 1999 World Indoor Championships. As a member of British 4 × 400 metres relay teams, he won a gold medal at the 1997 World Championships, and got the silver medal at the 1996 Olympic Games. He represented Wales at the Commonwealth Games where he got an individual silver and a bronze medal in the 4 × 400 m relay.

== Athletics career ==
===Early career===
Baulch made his debut for the GB &amp; NI team at a Junior International in Salamanca, Spain, in 1991, winning the 200m and breaking the Welsh record in that race. Baulch then changed his distance preference becoming a 400 metres specialist. Baulch particularly excelled at running the distance indoors (where races are usually run on 200m tracks rather than outdoor tracks which are 400m long). He won the 400m gold medal at the World Indoor Championships in 1999, and also claimed silver and bronze medals at the event in 1997 and 2003.

In 1993 Baulch ran a Welsh record 46.50 at Sheffield in his first individual race at the distance since 1990, and he made a breakthrough in 1995 when he progressed to 45.14.

===1996-99===
In 1996 Baulch ran a 44.19 second leg for Britain&#x27;s Olympic silver medal team that set a European record, and set his fifth Welsh record with 44.57.

Baulch was a member of the British 4 × 400 m relay team which finished second in the 1997 World Championships. However, on 7 January 2010, it was announced the British team were to be awarded the gold medal as they were beaten by a United States team which included Antonio Pettigrew, who subsequently admitted to having taken performance-enhancing drugs, thus disqualifying the US team. Baulch received his World Championship gold medal in May 2010 and, although he was happy, he said: &quot;It would have been great to have been in front of 80,000 people up on the rostrum...nothing can replace that. This is a second best unfortunately, but it&#x27;s nice to be recognised&quot;.

In 1997 he set Welsh indoor records at 46.36 and 46.13 before breaking Todd Bennett&#x27;s 12-year-old UK and Commonwealth indoor record of 45.56 with 45.39 at the UK Trials and then took the World Indoor silver behind Sunday Bada (Nigeria). Later he made the World final outdoors with a season&#x27;s best 44.69 in the semis and ran a 44.08 third leg on the British silver-medal relay team.

In 1999 he won all of his five competitions at 400m, including taking the gold medal at the World Indoor Championships in Maebashi, Japan and running a best time of 45.60 in Birmingham.

Outdoors he had a best of 44.82 in Lausanne, which he followed with a clear win at the AAAs in 45.36. At the World Championships he had four individual runs in the low-45s, again making the final, and ran a 44.24 anchor leg for the British team that went out in the heats of the 4 × 400 m.

===2000-03===
In 2000 Baulch won over 400m at the European Cup and had a season&#x27;s best of 45.06, but had a disappointing Olympic Games, going out in the heats of the 400m in 46.52, although producing a final leg of 44.65 to ensure that Britain made the final of the relay.

Baulch was selected as captain of the British team at the 2001 World Indoors, but had to withdraw through injury and struggled for form in the summer, with a season&#x27;s best of 46.15 in the heats at Edmonton, where he ran an encouraging 44.4 second leg for the British team in the final of the World 4 × 400 m. With an individual best of 46.01, he was again seen to best effect in relays in 2002, with a third leg of 45.1 to help Britain to victory in the European Cup 4 × 400 m and a third leg of 44.5 for the Welsh team that took the silver medal at the Commonwealth Games in a race against England.

He came back to form in 2003 with two bronze medals at the World Indoors, when he ran 45.99 to share the individual bronze medal with Paul McKee and in the relay. He ran a solid third leg for the British 4 × 400 m team at the European Cup, but had a disappointing outdoor season with a best of 46.43.

=== Change of coach ===
Baulch left coach Linford Christie in a bid to revive his athletics career, moving to Atlanta with new trainer Innocent Egbunike of Nigeria, a 4 × 400 m bronze medallist at the 1984 Olympics and a silver medallist in the individual 400m at the world championships in 1987.

== Media career ==
In 1999 and 2000, Baulch hosted the British children&#x27;s series &quot;Energize!&quot; He has also appeared on &quot;A Question of Sport&quot;, and finished third in the BBC programme &quot;Superstars&quot; in 2003. He was a trainee ranger in &quot;Safari School&quot;, broadcast in January–February 2007, and competed in &quot;Celebrity Mastermind&quot; in 2014. His specialist subject was the musician, Prince. Baulch became part of a circus act on Cirque de celebrite.

An Olympic special of &quot;Dancing on Ice&quot; aired in July 2012, before the London 2012 Summer Olympics. It featured medal-winning Olympic athletes, including Baulch.

== Post-Athletics and business ventures ==
After his retirement from athletics in 2005 Baulch set up several different businesses including Definitive, a sports management company and sports memorabilia company Authentic Sports. 
Baulch also launched fundraising platform uWin, and silent auction hosting company, BidAid.

Baulch is part-owner of fashion brand Crow &amp; Jester.
Baulch is also known to be actively involved with Jaguar Cars. From 2009- 2015 Jamie was an Ambassador for the Jaguar Academy of Sport, playing a key role in mentoring the next generation of British sporting talent.

Jamie heads up The &quot;21 Day ShapeUp by the Family&quot; online challenge.

Baulch also became a squad member for the Welsh touch rugby team in 2010 which won the European cup later that year.

<text>Gen. Piotr Jaroszewicz (; 8 October 1909 – 1 September 1992) was a post-World War II Polish political figure. He served as the Prime Minister of Poland between 1970 and 1980. After he was forced out of office, he lived quietly in a suburb of Warsaw until his murder in 1992.

==Life and career==
Jaroszewicz was born on 8 October 1909 in Nieśwież, in the Minsk Governorate of the Russian Empire (present-day Belarus). After finishing the secondary school in Jasło he started working as a teacher and headmaster in Garwolin. After the outbreak of World War II and the Nazi-Soviet alliance established by the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact he moved to Soviet-occupied zone of Poland. It has been claimed that he was a headmaster in Pinsk gymnasia. However, on 10 July 1940 he was deported to Slobodka, Krasnoborski region, Arkhangelsk, from Stolin together with his first wife Oksana Gregorevna (born in Salov/Calow 1914) and daughter Olila (born 1940). In 1943 he joined the 1st Polish Army of Gen. Zygmunt Berling. The following year he joined the Polish Workers Party and was promoted to deputy political commander of the 1st Army.

After the war he became the deputy minister of defense (1945–1950). Since 1956 he was the Polish ambassador to COMECON. At the same time between 1952 and 1970 he served as a deputy Prime Minister of Poland and briefly (1954–1956) as the minister of mining industry. Jaroszewicz was a member of the Central Committee of the Polish United Workers&#x27; Party since its creation in 1948 and since 1964 he was also a member of the Political Bureau. From December 1970 until February 1980 he was the Prime Minister of Poland. The economical policies of Jaroszewicz and Edward Gierek led to a wave of protests in 1976 and 1980. In 1980 he gave up all his party posts and was expelled from the party the following year.

==Death==
After his departure from office and the party, Jaroszewicz and second wife Alicja Solska settled in the Warsaw suburb of Anin. The couple largely kept to themselves and did not socialize much. Jaroszewicz was obsessed with security; he had a 3.3-metre (11-foot) fence topped with barbed wire installed around their villa. When he walked their [Schnauser], neighbours said, he often carried a pistol with him.

Despite these measures, their son Jan Jaroszewicz found the couple murdered when he entered the house on 3 September 1992. Poison gas had been used to incapacitate the dog. Jaroszewicz&#x27;s body, found in his upstairs study, had the belt that had been used to strangle him secured by an antique ice axe from his collection. The attackers had also beaten him, yet had bandaged the wounds.

Solska&#x27;s body was next to her husband&#x27;s. Her hands had been tied behind her back, and she had been shot in the head at close range with one of the couple&#x27;s hunting rifles. Investigators believe that she had earlier managed to injure one of the killers during a struggle, since blood from her and an unknown individual were found in another room in the house.

The killers appeared to have searched every room in the house. It was initially reported that they only took what were presumed to have been documents from one safe and left behind valuable old coins and art, suggesting the thieves were not motivated by financial gain. However police records show the thieves actually stole two guns, 5,000 German marks, five gold coins and a ladies&#x27; watch.

Friends and family said that Jaroszewicz had been even more paranoid than usual in the days before the murders, which were determined to have occurred on 1 September, two days before the bodies were discovered. The killings received significant media attention in Poland, due both to Jaroszewicz&#x27;s past leadership and the brutality of the crime. While initial theories suspected that the murders were politically motivated, in 2017 Warsaw police revealed the burglary had been committed by the &#x27;Karate Gang&#x27; of Radom, a group of violent criminals active through the 1990s. They had broken into Jaroszewicz&#x27;s home expecting to find significant sums of money and tortured him in an effort to find it. When Jaroszewicz broke free the gang murdered both him and his wife, then hurriedly left. Several Karate Gang members went on trial for this and other crimes in 2021. They denied any political motivation for the burglary.

<doc id="773022" wikidata="Q5511116" url="?curid=773022" title="Fuzzy game">
<text>In combinatorial game theory, a fuzzy game is a game which is incomparable with the zero game: it is not greater than 0, which would be a win for Left; nor less than 0 which would be a win for Right; nor equal to 0 which would be a win for the second player to move. It is therefore a first-player win.

==Classification of games==
In combinatorial game theory, there are four types of game. If we denote players as Left and Right, and G be a game with some value, we have the following types of game:

1. Left win: G &gt; 0 
:No matter which player goes first, Left wins.
2. Right win: G &lt; 0
:No matter which player goes first, Right wins.
3. Second player win: G = 0
:The first player (Left or Right) has no moves, and thus loses. 
4. First player win: G ║ 0 (G is fuzzy with 0)
:The first player (Left or Right) wins.

Using standard Dedekind-section game notation, {L|R}, where L is the list of undominated moves for Left and R is the list of undominated moves for Right, a fuzzy game is a game where all moves in L are strictly non-negative, and all moves in R are strictly non-positive.

==Examples==
One example is the fuzzy game * = {0|0}, which is a first-player win, since whoever moves first can move to a second player win, namely the zero game. An example of a fuzzy game would be a normal game of Nim where only one heap remained where that heap includes more than one object.

Another example is the fuzzy game {1|-1}. Left could move to 1, which is a win for Left, while Right could move to -1, which is a win for Right; again this is a first-player win. 

In Blue-Red-Green Hackenbush, if there is only a green edge touching the ground, it is a fuzzy game because the first player may take it and win (everything else disappears).

No fuzzy game can be a surreal number.

<text>Adrian Joseph Cronauer (September 8, 1938 – July 18, 2018) was an American radio personality and United States Air Force Sergeant, whose experiences as an innovative disc jockey on American Forces Network during the Vietnam War inspired the 1987 film &quot;Good Morning, Vietnam&quot; starring Robin Williams as Cronauer.

==Early life==
Cronauer was born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. His father was a steelworker, and his mother a teacher. He began his broadcasting career at the age of 12 as a semi-regular guest for a Pittsburgh-area children&#x27;s . 
Cronauer attended the University of Pittsburgh where he led a group that founded the school&#x27;s first student radio station, now WPTS-FM.

==Military service==
In the early 1960s, Cronauer chose to enlist instead of waiting for the draft. After considering flight training (which entailed a longer service commitment), Cronauer chose broadcasting and media operations, ultimately becoming a U.S. Air Force Radio and Television Broadcasting Specialist. His service spanned the years from 1963 to 1967. He did his training in Texas, and eventually rose to the rank of Sergeant (E-4 at the time). While Cronauer is best known for his service in Vietnam, he began by working on training films and then was sent for a year and a half to the island of Crete in Greece, where he was stationed at Iraklion Air Station. 

In 1965, Cronauer volunteered for a transfer to Vietnam because he wanted to travel. Upon arriving there, his first job was as news director for Armed Forces Radio in Saigon, but when the morning host&#x27;s slot became vacant shortly after his arrival, he took over the show, known as &quot;Dawn Buster&quot; because it started at 6 a.m. He opened it with the greeting &quot;Goooooood morning Vietnam!&quot;, which was immortalized in the subsequent movie&#x27;s title. Cronauer left Saigon in 1966, but subsequent DJs continued to use his signature greeting, including Pat Sajak. His military awards include the Air Force Good Conduct Medal, the National Defense Service Medal, the Vietnam Service Medal with bronze service star, the Air Force Longevity Service Award, the Vietnam Gallantry Cross Unit Award and the Vietnam Campaign Medal.

After the Vietnam war, Cronauer worked at various radio stations as a news anchor and in other capacities. He did voice-over work in New York and owned his own advertising agency, during which time he also earned a master&#x27;s degree in Media Studies from the New School for Social Research.

==&quot;Good Morning, Vietnam&quot;==
In the late 1970s, while working as the classical music morning host at WVWR in Roanoke, Virginia (now Virginia Tech&#x27;s WVTF), Cronauer had an idea for a television sitcom that would be a blend of &quot;M*A*S*H&quot; and &quot;WKRP in Cincinnati&quot;, two popular TV series of the era. In 1979 he tried to sell a treatment of this idea, basing the story on his experiences in Vietnam, but without success. A few years later he pitched a made-for-TV movie on the same theme: this time, a friend&#x27;s agent in Hollywood got the treatment into the hands of Robin Williams, who thought the idea was good enough to warrant a feature-length movie starring himself. However, according to Cronauer, little of the film reflects his real life. Among other things, Cronauer was not a subversive person but a &quot;lifelong card-carrying Republican&quot;, and later took an &quot;active role&quot; in both Bob Dole&#x27;s unsuccessful 1996 presidential campaign and George W. Bush&#x27;s successful 2004 presidential reelection campaign. Cronauer did teach English when off-duty in Saigon, but he did not teach swear words or New York street slang. He was never in a Jeep that got hit by a land mine, but he did witness the bombing of a restaurant near the radio station. In a 2014 &quot;Military Times&quot; interview, Cronauer said if he had done some of what the movie said he did, &quot;I&#x27;d still be in Leavenworth.&quot;

The movie, directed by Barry Levinson, told a heavily fictionalized story based on a screenplay by Mitch Markowitz, a screenwriter who had worked on &quot;M*A*S*H&quot;. Cronauer later told friends that Levinson had insisted that Williams and Cronauer not meet until the film was completed as Levinson did not want Williams to try to imitate Cronauer&#x27;s actions and vocal delivery style.

==Law career and later life==
The money Cronauer received from the movie enabled him to earn a Juris Doctor degree from the University of Pennsylvania Law School. He then founded the Cronauer Law Center and practiced law, specializing in the areas of information and communications law. In 1992, Cronauer earned awards for a special program on National Public Radio about the role of the American Forces Vietnam Network (AFVN-military radio and television). 

Cronauer was active in veterans&#x27; causes, and during George W. Bush&#x27;s presidency, became an adviser to the Defense Department&#x27;s POW-MIA office, and a confidential advisor to the Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense. His title was Special Assistant to the Director of the Defense Prisoner of War/Missing Personnel Office, and he was responsible for outreach to veterans and their families. He traveled widely and gave frequent media interviews and public appearances. This led to his becoming a popular after-dinner speaker and lecturer. He appeared as a guest on radio and television talk shows such as NBC Radio&#x27;s &quot;Jim Bohanan Show&quot;; NBC TV&#x27;s &quot;Today&quot; show; Fox News&#x27;s &quot;Hannity &amp; Colmes&quot;, ABC&#x27;s &quot;Bill Maher&quot;; and the PBS series &quot;Freedom Speaks&quot;. He also appeared on the Oliver North and G. Gordon Liddy radio programs. His commentaries were featured in many newspapers and on NPR radio. He was also on the board of the National D-Day Memorial, and was a trustee of the Virginia War Memorial. 

===Disbarment===
In October 2014, the National Community Reinvestment Coalition (NCRC) filed complaints against Cronauer and the Cronauer Law Center with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) and the Federal Trade Commission (FTC). The NCRC alleged that Cronauer had engaged in mortgage scams under the guise of offering assistance to property owners threatened with foreclosure. Cronauer consented to disbarment rather than contest the matter, which means that the facts and circumstances of the admitted misconduct remained confidential. However, the president of the NCRC made this statement: &quot;The rules apply to celebrities as well. We believe Mr. Cronauer and the Cronauer Law Center to be in violation of the Federal Trade Commission Act, the Mortgage Assistance Relief Act rules, and other state and federal laws.&quot;

===Death===

Cronauer died on July 18, 2018, at a nursing home in Troutville, Virginia at the age of 79.

==Personal life==
At the time of his death, Cronauer lived in Troutville, Virginia. He was married to Jeane Cronauer (née Steppe), who died in 2016. She had a son by a previous marriage, Michael Muse. Cronauer was a member of Mensa.

==Military awards==
Sergeant Cronauer received the following military awards.

<text>Charles Preston Nelson (5 February 1877 – 16 November 1935) was an officer of the United States Navy. He would attain the rank of Rear Admiral by the end of his career. He is known for his work with torpedo boats and submarines.

<text>Cavan ( ; ) is the county town of County Cavan in Ireland. The town lies in Ulster, near the border with County Fermanagh in Northern Ireland. The town is bypassed by the main N3 road that links Dublin (to the south) with Enniskillen, Ballyshannon and Donegal Town (to the north).

==History==
===Gaelic Cavan 1300–1607===
Cavan was founded by the Irish clan chief and Lord of East Breifne, Giolla Íosa Ruadh O’Reilly, between 1300 and his death in 1330. During his lordship, a friary run by the Dominican Order was established close to the O’Reilly stronghold at Tullymongan and was at the centre of the settlement close to a crossing over the river and to the town&#x27;s marketplace. It is recorded that the (Cavan) Dominicans were expelled in 1393, replaced by an Order of Conventual Franciscan friars. The friary&#x27;s location is marked by an eighteenth-century tower in the graveyard at Abbey Street which appears to incorporate remains of the original medieval friary tower. The imprint of the medieval town can be followed in the area of Abbey Street, Bridge Street and Main Street (townlands of Tullymongan Upper and Lower).

Clan O&#x27;Reilly later built a new castle in the late fourteenth century on Tullymongan Hill, overlooking the town centre. In the 15th century, the local ruler, Bearded Owen O&#x27;Reilly, expanded the town marketplace which attracted merchants from Dublin and Drogheda. The phrase &quot;life of Reilly&quot; is believed to derive from the great wealth and power of the Chief of Clan O&#x27;Reilly, some of which came from the market. The Chiefs also allowed, however, counterfeit English and Scottish coins to be minted in their territory at this time.

During the Elizabethan era religious persecution of the Catholic Church in Ireland, Archbishop Dermot O&#x27;Hurley, who would be one of the most celebrated of the 24 Irish Catholic Martyrs, was covertly sheltered by Thomas Fleming, 10th Baron Slane at Slane Castle, where the Archbishop was allegedly concealed inside a priest hole, but from whence O&#x27;Hurley covertly travelled to and from Cavan to visit with some fellow priests whom he had known while living in Catholic Europe.

===Early modern history===
King James I granted the town a charter in 1611. This also entitled Cavan town to send two members to the Irish parliament. In February 1690, during the Glorious Revolution, the Battle of Cavan took place after Williamite Inniskillinger forces led by Colonel William Wolseley attacked the strategic fort overlooking Cavan town at Tullamongan which was held then by the Duke of Berwick Jacobite army. During the battle much of the town was burned by Colonel Wolseley&#x27;s soldiers and Jacobite general William Nugent was killed. Later, during the 18th century, local administrative influence and power passed to the Maxwell family, descendants of Robert Maxwell, Church of Ireland Bishop of Kilmore (1643–1672), a family who later entered the peerage as Baron Farnham.

Farnham House, located at Farnham, a small rural district to the north-west of Cavan, is one of the largest country houses in the county. It was built for Barry Maxwell, 3rd Lord Farnham (later created, by the second creation, Earl of Farnham), head of the Maxwell dynasty, around 1780. The house was designed by James Wyatt. It was extended in 1810 to the design of Francis Johnston, a County Armagh-born, but Dublin-based, architect. It was sold by Diana, Lady Farnham (widow of Barry Maxwell, 12th Lord Farnham), to a local entrepreneur in 2001, and the house and estate has per 2006 been converted into a luxury hotel and leisure complex under the Radisson SAS international hotel group.
Developments in Cavan during the early 19th century saw the building of a new wide street that still bears the name &#x27;Farnham Street&#x27;. This was lined with comfortable town houses, public buildings (such as Cavan Courthouse which dates from 1824) and churches. From the mid-19th century, Cavan became an important rail junction for the Midland Great Western Railway (MGWR) and those of the Great Northern Railway (GNR). Cavan Town Hall was built between 1908 and 1910.

===20th century===

In 1938, work began on the Cathedral of Saints Patrick and Felim; the original Kilmore cathedral was built c.1455, as the main church of the Catholic Diocese of Kilmore located around five kilometres (3 mi) south-west of Cavan Town, on the R198. During the Plantation of Ulster in the seventeenth century, this church became the main Church of Ireland Kilmore Diocese church known as St. Feidhlimidh Cathedral. A new Kilmore Cathedral church was built in 1860 and dedicated to the memory of Bishop William Bedell who died and was buried here in 1642. Bedell was also famously noted for his translation of the old testament Bible into the Irish language. The present Cathedral contains a Hiberno Romanesque doorway dating from c. 1170, in the twelfth century, conjectured locally &quot;(but unlikely)&quot; originally to have come from Holy Trinity priory located a short distance away upon Trinity Island in Lough Oughter. Holy Trinity priory was built mid-thirteenth century. A short distance from the Kilmore Cathedral is the See House, a late Georgian-style house constructed in the 1830s. This house, designed by William Farrell, was formerly the official residence (or &quot;Bishop&#x27;s Palace&quot;) of the Church of Ireland Bishops of Kilmore, Elphin and Ardagh.

On 23 February 1943, a fire at St Joseph&#x27;s Orphanage in the town claimed the lives of 35 children and an elderly woman. A public inquiry found no culpability on the part of the nuns who ran the orphanage, but the circumstances surrounding the high death toll in the fire remain controversial to this day. The secretary of the Commission of Enquiry, Brian O&#x27;Nolan, is better known to posterity as the writer Flann O&#x27;Brien.

The former Cavan Town Royal Irish Constabulary Barracks was demolished in 1968. Its successor stood on the corner of Farnham Street (also known as Casement Street, named after Sir Roger Casement) and Abbey Street. The current Garda Station is further along Farnham Street, just across from the Courthouse.

Adjacent to the Courthouse is the Cavan Central Library building constructed in 2006. The entrance is dominated by an aquarium, with commissioned bog oak sculptures by local artist Joey Burns that portray Cavan history. An arts feature based on &quot;Gulliver&#x27;s Travels&quot; enriches the interior space, and two large paintings by award-winning author PJ Lynch were commissioned by Cavan Library Service, in a lasting tribute to Jonathan Swift and to Cavan where &quot;Gulliver&#x27;s Travels&quot; was written.

In the 1990s and 2000s Cavan town expanded rapidly with extensive urban regeneration and suburban expansion. It is one of the main economic hubs of the north central part of Ireland and has an extensive range of financial services, legal, medical, industrial and retail enterprises.

==Transport==

===Road===
The town is located on the junction of two national routes, the N3 to Dublin and N55 to Athlone. The National Development Plan provides for a major upgrading of the route with an M3 motorway from Kells to Dublin (completed and officially opened on 4 June 2010) and type 2 dual carriageway from Whitegate on the Meath border to Cavan, which will eventually bypass Virginia too. The N3 and N55 eastern bypass around Cavan town was fully completed in March 2006, eliminating the need for heavy traffic to pass through an already congested town.

===Railway===


Although Cavan has no railway links today, there were once two railway stations on separate lines, linking the Great Northern Railway (GNR) and Midland Great Western Railway, then an end junction of the Belfast-Cavan route linking Clones with a branch line to Crossdoney and Killeshandra. With the Cavan-Dublin route, via Inny Junction, Longford and Mullingar on the Dublin-Sligo railway line. There is an old railway line running through Kingscourt on the border of County Meath; this line is now overgrown.

A branch of the Cavan and Leitrim Railway was also indirectly linked to Cavan town via Belturbet (the C&amp;L terminus) and Ballyhaise on the GNR line. When the Government of Northern Ireland closed the section of the Belfast line from Portadown to Glaslough in 1957, it was found to be uneconomical to keep running the rump section from Monaghan to Cavan. All these lines (including the Cavan and Leitrim Railway) were closed by 1960. The (GNR) Virginia Road Station, from 1863 to 1958 serviced the Drogheda and Navan extension route to Kells and Oldcastle. Cooperation between the Cavan and Westmeath county councils is striving to integrate this into the national and regional development plan. Cavan railway station opened on 8 July 1856, closed for passenger services on 14 October 1957, and finally closed altogether on 1 January 1960.

===Bus===
Cavan&#x27;s bus station is owned and operated by Bus Éireann and is located on Farnham Street. It is a single-storey accessible building with a ticket office, waiting room, public &#x27;phone, restaurant and toilets. The station is served by the Donegal Town – Enniskillen – Dublin Airport – Busáras Expressway route 30 which generally operates every two hours in each direction. Route 165 operates less frequently to Athlone and Belfast. The station is the terminus of several local routes, including route 109 to Dublin, which operates hourly each way. Other local routes are the 111 to Ballinagh, Granard, Castlepollard and Athboy, the 166 to Dundalk, the 175 to Monaghan via Cootehill, the 175A to Monaghan via Cloverhill and Clones and the Tuesdays-only 465 to Carrigallen.

Leydons Coaches operate route 930 to Enniskillen via Belturbet, Ballyconnell, Bawnboy and Swanlinbar.

Whartons Travel operate a route to Longford railway station via Crossdoney, Arvagh, Drumlish and Longford.

There are also a number of TFI Local Link routes serving Cavan:

* Route C1 ;
* Route C2 ;
* Route C3 with Drumliff also at the weekend;
* Route 176 ;
* Route 929 .

==Education==
Cavan town has four secondary level schools: Saint Patrick&#x27;s College, Loreto College, Breifne College, and the oldest, Royal School Cavan, founded in the early 17th century.

Breifne College is a co-educational Vocational Education School administered by the County Cavan Education and Training Board.

Saint Patrick&#x27;s College and Loreto College are respectively all boys and all girls Catholic voluntary schools, with The Royal School being a co-educational school with a Protestant ethos. These schools are administered by their respective patrons in conjunction with the Department of Education and Science.

The town has a third level college, Cavan Institute (formerly Cavan College of Further Studies), which was founded in 1985 and is the largest provider of FETAC courses in the northeast region. The college offers Further Education and Training Awards Council (FETAC) across its five schools; Business &amp; Humanities, Healthcare, Sport &amp; Education, Beauty Therapy &amp; Hairdressing, Computing, Engineering &amp; Science Design, Performing Arts &amp; Services. Graduates are entitled to exemptions within most third level colleges and usually transfer to study a degree further completing their course by in their chosen field. The majority of students are Cavan locals, with a large proportion of its other students coming from nearby counties such as Leitrim, Roscommon, Monaghan, Meath and Westmeath. The college&#x27;s main campus is located on Cathedral Road with other sites in the town centre and at the former Army Barracks on the Dublin Road.

==Tourism and events==
===All-Ireland Fleadh===
In 2010, 2011 and 2012, Cavan Town hosted the &quot;Fleadh Cheoil na hÉireann&quot;.
The 2010 Fleadh was held from 16 to 22 August. The Fleadh is the premier annual Irish traditional music, song and dance festival and series of competitions, which is run by Comhaltas Ceoltóirí Éireann (CCÉ). Fleadh 2010 was the 50th annual &quot;Fleadh Cheoil na hÉireann&quot;, and the first to be carbon neutral. That year it returned to Cavan for the first time since 1954. Up to 250,000 visitors attend the annual &quot;Fleadhann&quot;, and about 10,000 musicians compete. It is also estimated that the annual All-Ireland Fleadh generates €20-€25 million for the local economy of its host town.

===Heritage and tourism development===
In the County Heritage Plan 2006–2011, published by Cavan County Council, a guiding principle was stated as: &quot;The unique and diverse heritage of County Cavan is conserved, sustained and, above all, cherished and celebrated by the people of the County&quot;. Located in Ireland&#x27;s lakelands, the wildlife and wetlands environment of County Cavan&#x27;s loughs reputedly offers opportunities for sustainable tourism development. Lough Oughter and Killykeen, located a few kilometres from Cavan town has some infrastructure for ecotourism development.
