<text>Poznań, today Poland&#x27;s fifth largest city, is also one of the country&#x27;s oldest cities, and was an important political and religious center in the early Polish state of the 10th century. Poznań Cathedral is the oldest church in the country, containing the tombs of the first Polish rulers, Duke Mieszko I and King Bolesław I Chrobry.

Although the centre of national political power moved to Kraków in the 11th century, and later to Warsaw, Poznań remained an important regional center, being the chief city of the Greater Poland (Wielkopolska) region. It came under Prussian (later German) rule for most of the period from 1793 to 1918, during which it expanded significantly, and was also heavily fortified. The city resumed its role as a Polish voivodeship capital in the Second Polish Republic, and later, following the 1939–1945 Nazi German occupation, in the communist Polish People&#x27;s Republic. Since 1999 Poznań has been the capital of Greater Poland Voivodeship.

== Early times and Piast Poland (to 1138) ==

The first settlements in and near-by what is now Poznań can be traced to the late period of the Stone Age. Later various cultures developed there in the Bronze Age and Iron Age. Famous are the originally Bronze Age burial mounds at Łęki Małe, built between 2150 BC and 1800 BCE during the Únětice Culture. By the mid 20th century, nine mounds were still visible, and originally there were probably 14 mounds.

A recent study, based on a multi-proxy approach using cores from Lake Wonieść, has demonstrated the complex settlement history with changing intensities in the Poznań region throughout prehistory. Around 5250 BCE, people attributed to the Linear Pottery Culture settled in the areas of chernozem soil. A significant opening of the landscape took place during the Funnel Beaker Period from 3800 BCE. There are several boom and bust phases that correspond to archaeological complexes. For example, a boom phase appears in the records around 2150 BCE, when Early Bronze Age settlements began to appear and sites such as Bruszczewo and Łęki Małe were initiated. A bust phase appears around 1690-1640 BC, when the huge Bruszczewo settlement was abandoned.

Poznań began as a stronghold built in the 8th or 9th century AD between branches of the Warta and Cybina rivers, on what is now called Ostrów Tumski (&quot;Cathedral Island&quot;). Various other settlements sprang up nearby on the islands and on both banks of the Warta. In the 10th century the tribe inhabiting the region, the Polans, became dominant over other tribes in most of the area of today&#x27;s Poland. Consequently, this early Polish state, ruled by Duke Mieszko I and his successors in the Piast dynasty, was centred politically on Poznań and the neighbouring Polan strongholds, particularly Gniezno and Giecz. Archaeological research shows that in the late 10th century Poznań had a ducal palace (where the Church of Our Lady now stands, opposite the cathedral), with a chapel, possibly built for Mieszko&#x27;s Christian wife Dobrawa. The ceremony by which Mieszko converted to Christianity in 966, known as the Baptism of Poland, is likely to have taken place at Poznań.

Following the conversion, in 968 Poland received its first missionary bishop, Jordan, who is believed to have used Poznań as his seat. Construction began of Poznań&#x27;s cathedral. This was originally built in an early Romanesque style, and as Poland&#x27;s first cathedral had St. Peter as its patron. The first rulers of Piast Poland – Mieszko I, Bolesław I and Mieszko II – are buried beneath the cathedral.

Gniezno was created an archbishopric at the Congress of Gniezno in 1000, by agreement between Bolesław I and Holy Roman Emperor Otto III. However Jordan&#x27;s successor Unger remained as Bishop of Poznań independent of Gniezno, although it is not clear whether this continued to be a missionary bishopric subordinate to the Pope, or was attached to the Bishopric of Magdeburg.

With Mieszko II&#x27;s death in 1034, which probably occurred in Poznań (and may have been the result of an aristocratic plot), the country entered a period of anarchy and pagan reaction, which caused much devastation in the region. In 1038 Bretislaus I, Duke of Bohemia invaded, sacking and destroying Poznań and Gniezno. When Poland&#x27;s unity was restored by Casimir the Restorer in 1039, the capital was moved to Kraków, which had been relatively undamaged by the troubles. Poznań and Gniezno were rebuilt, and in spite of the decline in the region&#x27;s political importance, Poznań remained an important economic center.

== In the period of fragmentation of Poland (1138–1320) ==

Under the testament of Bolesław III, in 1138 Poland was divided into separate duchies under the late king&#x27;s sons. Poznań and its surrounding region (though without Gniezno and Kalisz) became the domain of Mieszko III the Old, the first of the Dukes of Greater Poland. The period saw much turbulence and fighting among the dukes, with the duchies and their subdivisions (such as the duchies of Poznań, Gniezno and Kalisz) frequently changing hands. Mieszko was High Duke of all Poland at various times between 1173 and his death in 1202, by which time he had also gained control of Gniezno and Kalisz, thus making Poznań a centre of power in a region covering the whole of Greater Poland. However the instability would continue throughout the 13th century.

Poznań at this time was still essentially the stronghold on the cathedral island. However, by the end of the 12th century various trade and craft settlements had developed around it, including those of St. Gotard, St. Martin and St. Adalbert (Wojciech) on the left bank of the Warta river, and Śródka on the right bank. The name Śródka derived from the Wednesday markets which were held there (&quot;środa&quot; is Polish for &quot;Wednesday&quot;). Beyond Śródka was the Church of St. John (formerly of St. Michael), and beyond that a settlement which would become known as Komandoria (after the commander of the Knights Hospitallers, to whom the church was granted in 1187).

The main arena of development, though, was the left bank. In about 1249, Duke Przemysł I began constructing a residence and castle on what is now called Przemysł Hill – this would become the Royal Castle. Przemysł also acquired the settlement of St. Gotard from the bishopric, in exchange for that of St. Adalbert, with the intention of founding a town there. In 1253 a charter was given by Przemysł (and his brother Bolesław the Pious) for the founding of a town under Magdeburg law. The charter was issued to Thomas of Gubin, who in the following years brought many German settlers to aid in the building. This city covered the area of Poznań&#x27;s present-day Old Town neighbourhood, centred on the Market Square (now &quot;Stary Rynek&quot;). Under Duke Przemysł II, the castle was strengthened and the new city surrounded with a wall, integrated with the castle (which stood at the eastern end of the town).

Przemysł II was crowned king of Poland in 1295, and thus the castle became a royal residence. However, after the king&#x27;s murder in Rogoźno the following year, the conflict and instability resumed. In 1314 Poznań finally came under the control of Władysław I the Elbow-high, who was crowned king of a reunited Poland in 1320, bringing the period of fragmentation to an end.

== In Poland and the Commonwealth (1320–1793) ==

In the reunited Poland (and later in the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth) Poznań became the seat of a voivodeship, although within the Greater Poland region Kalisz was initially of greater importance, lying on the route from Silesia to Toruń and Gdańsk. In 1331 Poznań withstood a siege by forces of John of Bohemia. With the start of the Jagiellonian period Poznań began to grow in importance, as it lay on the trading route from Lithuania and Ruthenia to western Europe. King Władysław II Jagiełło granted and confirmed numerous privileges on the city, which continued to grow in importance under his successors. Most of the surrounding settlements on the left-bank of the Warta belonged to the city, while the cathedral island (Ostrów Tumski) and the right bank formed the bishop&#x27;s possessions. Separate town rights were bestowed on Ostrów Tumski sometime before 1335, Śródka in 1425 (its western end, Ostrówek, would form a separate town), and Chwaliszewo (then a separate island) in 1444.

The city also suffered from frequent epidemics of disease, which slowed the growth of the population. It also suffered a number of fires (particularly in 1386, 1447, 1459, 1464, 1536 and 1590), which increased the popularity of brick over wood as a building material. Floods were another frequent problem. The city&#x27;s fortifications were strengthened from 1431 onwards, with the addition of wall towers, a tall observation tower and a second line of walls, a moat being created between the two lines.
The city had a significant Jewish community, which had probably existed since the mid 13th century, although the first documentary record of them dates from 1367, by which time Poznań already had a synagogue. The Jewish quarter was in the north-east of the walled city, around the street called &quot;ulica Żydowska&quot; (&quot;Jewish Street&quot;), known as &quot;ul. Tkacka&quot; (&quot;Weavers&#x27; Street&quot;) before the 15th century.

The Lubrański Academy was founded in Poznań in 1519, Poland&#x27;s second institution of higher education after the Jagiellonian University, although it did not have the right to award academic degrees.

In 1536 the city suffered a major fire. The town hall was one of the buildings affected; the damage led to a major redesign and reconstruction of the building in 1550–1560, under the direction of Giovanni Battista di Quadro.

In 1549 it is recorded that there were 550 houses belonging to the townspeople, 86 belonging to Jews, about 30 belonging to nobles and a similar number belonging to clergy. Many craftsmen by that time had moved to the settlements outside the city walls, leading to an increase in the number of residential buildings in the city. However many of the nobles&#x27; and clergy&#x27;s possessions, both within and outside the walls, had the status of &quot;jurydyka&quot;, which placed them outside the control of the city and thus reduced the city&#x27;s revenues and power. The Jewish quarter was also self-governing. It is estimated that the conurbation&#x27;s population in this period was approximately 20,000, of which 8,000 lived within the city walls. However the population was subject to large fluctuations due to fires, floods and outbreaks of disease.

At the end of the 16th century Poznań was a major centre for the fur and leather trade, particularly in skins coming from Lithuania and Russia.
During the free election period in Poland, Poznań, as one of the most influential cities of the state, enjoyed voting rights.

Attempts were made to introduce Protestantism to the city in the second half of the 16th century, but this involved mainly the nobility, the bulk of the population remaining Roman Catholic. The largest Protestant congregation, the German-speaking Lutherans, numbered 2,300 to 2,400 at the end of the century, of whom only about 600 lived within the city walls. The Catholic Church&#x27;s Counter-Reformation efforts included the founding of a Jesuits&#x27; College in the city in 1571, under the rectorship of Jakub Wujek. This institution gained the right to award academic degrees in 1611, and existed until the abolition of the order and merger with the Lubrański Academy in 1780.

From the second half of the 17th century Poznań, like Poland as a whole, suffered from a series of invasions and other disasters. The city was occupied by a Swedish army in 1655 during the Second Northern War, replaced by Brandenburgians in 1656 (the Swedes burned the suburbs when they left). The Brandenburgian garrison surrendered after a two-month siege in 1657, which left the city devastated. There were also many deaths from plague during this time. In the Third Northern War Poznań was again occupied by a Swedish army, from 1703–1709, and became the main centre of the pro-Swedish movement in the country. After 1709 the city was occupied by Saxon forces, who looted much property; there were also further outbreaks of plague until 1711. The city was captured by forces of the Tarnogród Confederation in 1716, which led to further plundering. Russian forces arrived in the region in the same year (remaining until 1719), but accepted payment not to enter the city.
A fire of 16 March 1717 spread from the Jewish quarter to the whole of the city; alleged failure of the Jews to allow fire-fighting efforts led to anti-Semitic sentiment. King August II was unwilling to assist the rebuilding of the city after these disasters; in 1728 30% of houses remained in disrepair. In 1733–1735 the city again suffered from the frequent presence of military forces during the War of the Polish Succession. This was followed by a flood of 1736, which destroyed almost all of the suburban buildings. In 1719–1753 Poznań absorbed several waves of rural settlers from Bamberg (&quot;Bambrzy&quot;), invited by the city authorities to rebuild the devastated suburbs. There were also significant groups of Dutch settlers (&quot;Olędrzy&quot;).

In spite of Poland&#x27;s non-involvement, Poznań was affected by the Seven Years&#x27; War, because of its strategic location. Russian and Prussian troops alternately occupied the city from 1758 until 1763. There was much looting of property by the occupiers, and during the time of Prussian control the townspeople were forced to sell goods at vastly reduced prices or for counterfeit money. The city received no assistance from the Polish government of August III during these events, and the election of Stanisław August Poniatowski to the throne in 1764 was widely welcomed. However Poznań again suffered military occupation and conflict during the events involving the Bar Confederation, with Russian troops occupying the city in 1768–1769, followed by confederate troops in 1769–1770, Russians again in 1770–1771, Prussians in 1771–1773 (withdrawing after the First Partition of Poland had been ratified), and Russian troops again in 1773–1775.

Various Polish Crown Army units were stationed in the city at various times, including the Prince Frederick Mounted Regiment, 1st, 7th and 9th Polish Infantry Regiments and the 2nd Polish Artillery Brigade.
In 1778 a &quot;Committee of Good Order&quot; &quot;(Komisja Dobrego Porządku)&quot; was established in Poznań (a type of body introduced by acts of the Sejm in 1764 and 1768, to oversee the restoration of the kingdom&#x27;s cities). Poznań&#x27;s committee was headed by Kazimierz Raczyński, a former general, starosta of Wielkopolska and crown official. One of its first acts was to take an inventory, which showed that within the city walls there were 390 residential buildings (80% of them brick-built), and 57 public buildings (including the three main gates and around 30 wall towers). There were also 8 abbeys, 9 Catholic churches, a Protestant congregation and a synagogue. The Committee organized repairs and improvements to buildings, construction of buildings on unbuilt land, the building of a new wall, improvements to streets, and the removal of mills from the river to make it navigable. It also reformed the city government and attempted (with partial success) to bring the &quot;jurydyki&quot; under the city&#x27;s control.

In the events leading to the Second Partition of Poland, Poznań was occupied by a Prussian army on 31 January 1793. On 10 June an order was given that all Polish offices of government were to cease their activity by 4 July. Thus Poznań (or &quot;Posen&quot;, as it was known in German), along with all of Greater Poland, came under the control of Prussia.

==In the Prussian Partition for the first time (1793–1807)==

According to Prussian figures compiled in 1794, there were 4,738 people living within the city walls, as well as another 2,355 in the formerly independent Jewish quarter. There were also 640 in the St. Wojciech settlement, 2,344 in St. Martin&#x27;s, 329 in Śródka, 255 in Ostrówek (the western part of Śródka, with separate town rights), 1,052 in Chwaliszewo, 126 in Piotrowo, 304 on Ostrów Tumski, and 425 in the abbeys. Taking account of other settlements not listed, this puts the total population of the conurbation at around 15,000. It is estimated that about 70% of the population was Polish, 20% Jewish, and about 10% German (particularly settlers living in the suburbs).

Poznań became part of the province of South Prussia (serving as the provincial capital until 1795, when Warsaw was added in the Third Partition). The Prussian authorities aimed to integrate the conurbation into a single unit. In 1796 the settlements belonging to the Church (which resisted integration) were confiscated, and in 1797 the settlements of St. Wojciech (north of the walled city) and St. Martin (to the west) were incorporated into the city. These were followed in 1800 by the island settlements of Chwaliszewo and Zagórze (on Ostrów Tumski), and Śródka, Ostrówek and Zawady on the right bank.

By this time the city covered and had a population of close to 19,000, as well as a garrison of 2,500. The old city walls were now redundant militarily and came to be taken down and the moats filled in, enabling new building as the city expanded. Major new streets and squares included the grand avenue of &quot;Wilhelms Strasse&quot; (today&#x27;s &quot;Aleje Marcinkowskiego&quot;) to the west of the old town, &quot;Wilhelms Platz&quot; (today&#x27;s &quot;Plac Wolności&quot;) adjacent to it, &quot;Königs Platz&quot; (today&#x27;s &quot;Plac Cyryla Ratajskiego&quot;) further to the west, and &quot;Gerber Strasse&quot; (today&#x27;s &quot;ul. Garbary&quot;) east of the old town. A fire of 1803 caused significant damage in the old town, and led to wider streets being marked out. In 1804 a theatre (the &quot;Arkadia&quot; building) was erected on Wilhelms Platz, serving mainly to show German plays. It was designed by architect David Gilly, who also oversaw other development projects in the city.

==In the Duchy of Warsaw (1807–1815)==

Following France&#x27;s successes against Prussia in the Napoleonic Wars, Napoleon sent Polish generals Jan Henryk Dąbrowski and Józef Wybicki to raise a Polish army to take control of South Prussia, in what was called the Greater Poland Uprising of 1806. On 1–2 November Prussian forces and many officials withdrew from Poznań, leaving Dąbrowski and Wybicki to enter the city on 3 November 1806. The city became a base for continued military action, and Napoleon himself stayed there (at the former Jesuit College) between 27 November and 12 December. In 1806, the Polish 11th Infantry Regiment was formed in Poznań. The following year Poznań became part of the semi-independent Duchy of Warsaw, and served as the capital of an administrative area called Poznań Department.

In 1812 Napoleon&#x27;s armies again passed through Poznań, this time in retreat following defeat in Russia, and Napoleon stayed in the city (in secret) on 12 December. The last French troops left on 12 February 1813, and Russian troops entered the city the same day, beginning an occupation which lasted until 1815. In that year, as agreed at the Congress of Vienna, Poznań and its region again came under Prussian control.

==In the Prussian Partition for the second time (1815–1918)==
In 1815 the official population of Poznań was 23,854. The city became the capital of the Grand Duchy of Posen, which in theory enjoyed limited autonomy, with the rights of the Poles respected, although in practice efforts at Germanization were undertaken. Poznań was the seat of the royal governor, Duke Antoni Henryk Radziwiłł. Urban development continued, including the marking out of more streets in the newer &quot;upper town&quot; and its integration with the old town, and demolition of the walls and gates of the old town (several churches were also demolished). Plans were also made for a new line of fortifications around the expanded city, including the Fort Winiary citadel in the north (now the &quot;Cytadela&quot; park). Construction work on this project began in 1828 and continued for several decades (for details, see &quot;Poznań Fortress&quot;). Military barracks and training grounds were created in the north of the city.

In 1828, the city was visited by composer Fryderyk Chopin.

Among projects financed by Poles in Poznań, the Raczyński Library, financed by Edward Raczyński, was completed in 1828. German poet Heinrich Heine was most impressed when he visited the site of the library&#x27;s construction in August 1822, though Edward Raczyński, in fear of rejection, could not disclose to the Prussian authorities he intended to house a Polish public library there until February 1829, when he sent the Prussian king the statute of its foundation and organization and on 24 January 1830 Frederick William III of Prussia did approve it. After the death of the library&#x27;s founder and then his son, Roger the Prussian authorities made effort to Germanize the Raczyński Library, but these efforts were not fully successful. An important centre of Polish culture in Poznań would be the Bazar hotel on Wilhelms Strasse, built in 1841 by a company set up by Karol Marcinkowski and other Poles. Also in 1841 Marcinkowski and Maciej Mielzynski founded the &quot;Towarzystwo Naukowej Pomocy dla Młodzieży Wielkiego Księstwa Poznańskiego&quot; (&quot;Scientific Help Society for the Youth of the Grand Duchy of Poznań&quot;), which provided academic scholarships for poor Poles. Raczyński also funded the city&#x27;s first system of water supply pipes (built of wood, from 1840). Hipolit Cegielski set up his first metal goods shop in the Bazar hotel building in 1846 – the Cegielski company would develop into one of Poznań&#x27;s largest industrial concerns (since 1919 occupying plants south of Wilda district).
In the 1830s the idea was raised of building a railway to Frankfurt an der Oder (which was already connected to Berlin). However the Prussian authorities feared that this might be exploited by Russia in case of war; they were also dissatisfied that the project was being promoted by the Polish-dominated provincial parliament. Approval for a railway was finally given in 1846, but running north to Stargard, and the concession was given to a Prussian company. The railway opened on 10 August 1848. The station was in Jeżyce (on the site now occupied by the zoo and the adjacent tram depot). It later gained connections to Breslau (today Wrocław) (1856), Berlin (1870), Inowrocław and Bromberg (today Bydgoszcz) (1872), and Upper Silesia (1875). The station on its present site, south-west of the city centre, was built in 1879. A direct line to Warsaw would not be opened until 1921.

Polish sentiment against the partitioning powers led to two insurrections, each known as a &quot;Greater Poland Uprising&quot; (&quot;powstanie wielkopolskie&quot;). The 1846 uprising was easily defeated, the insurgents being tried in Berlin the following year. The 1848 uprising initially enjoyed greater success, as it was supported by the German National Assembly which had come into being through the Spring of Nations revolutions, being seen as a force against possible Russian intervention. However this support was lost when the insurrection was seen to be directed against Germans in the region, and this uprising too was ultimately unsuccessful. The Polish National Committee was founded and based in the city. Following these events the Duchy lost its residual autonomy, being &quot;degraded&quot; to the Province of Posen (&quot;Provinz Posen&quot;), although the Prussian kings continued to use the title Grand Duke of Posen. With Prussia, the province became part of the united German Empire in 1871.

Polish national poet Juliusz Słowacki stayed in Poznań from 11 April to 9 May 1848, when he departed to Wrocław. Słowacki first met Karol Libelt in Poznań. The first obituary of Fryderyk Chopin, by poet Cyprian Norwid, and the composer&#x27;s first biography, by Marceli Szulc, were published in Poznań in 1849 and 1873, respectively.
Polish social and academic organizations continued to be set up, including the Central Economic Society for the Grand Duchy of Poznań (1861) to promote modern agriculture, the Poznań Society of Friends of Learning (1875), and the People&#x27;s Libraries Society (1880). In 1873–1875 a Polish theatre was built by public subscription (&quot;Teatr Polski&quot;, still functioning today). The authorities, however, continued efforts to Germanize the region, including through the activities of the Prussian Settlement Commission, founded in 1886. Germans accounted for 38% of the city&#x27;s population (20,000 out of 53,000) in 1867 – by 1910 their number would rise to 50,000, though this represented a smaller percentage of the total population of the city (whose boundaries had significantly expanded in the meantime). As the population increased the proportion of Jews in the city also fell: from 20.5% in 1831 to 13.3% in 1867 and 3.6% in 1910 (a total of about 5,000).

A gasworks was built on Grobla in 1853–1856, enabling the first gas streetlights to be installed in 1858 (this form of lighting would continue in use until the early 1960s). Grobla was also the site of the city&#x27;s first modern waterworks (1866) and major electricity works (1904). Sewers began to be installed on a large scale at the end of the 19th century.

To strengthen the city&#x27;s defences, in the second stage of the &quot;Festung Posen&quot; scheme, an outer ring of forts was built to encircle the city. The nine original forts were built starting in 1876, and nine intermediate forts were built between them from 1887. Poznań was by now a major military post, headquarters of the German Fifth Army Corps. However much of the original inner ring of fortifications was now redundant and could be taken down, enabling the city to expand more freely, particularly to the west. Near the old Berlin Gate a series of imposing buildings was constructed, including the neo-Romanesque imperial palace (now called &quot;Zamek&quot;), completed in 1910, which lent the city the status of a royal residence. The other buildings included the opera house, a post office headquarters (&quot;Oberpostdirektion&quot;), the railway board headquarters, a Royal Academy, and the headquarters of the Settlement Commission, where teachers and clerics were trained. (The last two are now university buildings: &quot;Collegium Minus&quot; of Adam Mickiewicz University, and &quot;Collegium Maius&quot;, occupied mainly by Poznań Medical University.)

Serious floods (reaching the Old Market) occurred in 1855, 1888 and 1889. In 1889 Emperor Wilhelm II visited the city to inspect the flood damage, and appointed a committee to take steps to prevent further such disasters. The small river branch called the &quot;Zgniła Warta&quot; (&quot;rotten Warta&quot;) flowing west of Grobla (on the line of today&#x27;s &quot;ul. Mostowa&quot;) was filled in, as was a stream following into it (today&#x27;s &quot;ul. Łąkowa&quot;). It was also planned to divert the main stream of the Warta to flow east of Chwaliszewo (in what was then a flood relief channel), but this plan would not be realized until 1968 (further major floods would occur in 1924 and 1940).

Poznań gained its first electric trams in 1898 (horse-drawn trams had operated since 1880, running from the new rail station to the Old Market Square, and later to the cathedral; see &quot;Tramways in Poznań&quot;). The first motor cars were seen on the city&#x27;s streets in 1901, and the first taxis in 1905.

In 1902 Wilhelm II visited the city to give speeches and unveil a statue of Frederick. Poles protested his visit by leaving the city or shuttering homes. The Polish management of Wilhelm&#x27;s hotel even left the building undecorated. While the ethnic Germans received Wilhelm with praise, only one hereditary Polish noble met the emperor. It was during this visit that Wilhelm called for the expansion of the city and the removal of some military fortifications. Wilhelm also gave a speech to attempt alleviate the ethnic conflicts in the region, but observers noted that the populace was unconvinced.

In 1896 the right-bank suburbs of Piotrowo and Berdychowo became part of the city. The city borders were then expanded significantly westwards in 1900, to include the former villages of Łazarz, Górczyn, Jeżyce and Wilda. Sołacz was added in 1907. Poznań now covered an area of . In 1911–1913 the St. Roch road bridge was built across the Warta close to Berdychowo (a bridge had previously stood there until 1771).

==Interwar period==

Following Germany&#x27;s defeat in World War I Polish independence seemed assured, but it was not clear whether Greater Poland would become part of the new state of Poland. A speech given in Poznań by Ignacy Paderewski on December 27, 1918 ignited the Greater Poland Uprising of 1918–1919, in which Polish troops attempted to take control of the region from Germany. The uprising was largely successful, and in the Versailles peace treaty (signed June 28, 1919) most of the region was granted to Poland, with Poznań as the capital of the newly formed Poznań Voivodeship within the Second Polish Republic. Many German inhabitants left to live within the new German borders, partly because of discrimination. Germans made up 5.5% of the city&#x27;s population in 1921, and 2.6% in 1931 (after the expansion of the city&#x27;s boundaries).

In 1919 Poznań University was opened, taking over the buildings of the Prussian Settlement Commission and Royal Academy. In 1921 Poznań first hosted trade fairs, which from 1925 became the Poznań International Fairs. From 16 May to 30 September 1929 the fairs site became the venue for a major National Exhibition (&quot;Powszechna Wystawa Krajowa&quot;, popularly &quot;PeWuKa&quot;), held to mark ten years of Polish independence. The exhibition attracted around 4.5 million visitors. The Pan-Slavic Congress of Singers was held as part of the exhibition&#x27;s opening days.

In the interwar period the city&#x27;s borders were expanded to include Główna, Komandoria, Rataje, Starołęka, Dębiec, Szeląg and Winogrady (including the Citadel) in 1925, and Golęcin and Podolany in 1933. The city&#x27;s area was now .

==World War II==

Poznań was invaded by German troops on 10 September 1939, during the invasion of Poland, which started World War II. On 12 September, the &quot;Einsatzkommando 1&quot; and &quot;Einsatzgruppe VI&quot; paramilitary death squads entered the city to commit various crimes against the population. Already in September, the occupiers carried out mass arrests and first massacres of local Poles, including at nearby Zdziechowa. The Germans also carried out mass searches of Polish institutions and libraries, and closed down Polish organizations, press and cultural institutions. Poznań was made the headquarters of the central district of the &quot;Selbstschutz&quot;, which task was to commit atrocities against Poles during the German invasion of Poland. On 8 October 1939, Poznań was annexed by Germany, and was included into a newly formed province called initially &quot;Reichsgau Posen&quot;, and later Reichsgau Wartheland (&quot;Warthe&quot; being the German name for the Warta river). The governor (&quot;Gauleiter&quot;) was Arthur Greiser, who would be hanged for crimes against humanity after the war. Ernst Damzog was appointed the police inspector for both &quot;Sicherheitspolizei&quot; and &quot;Sicherheitsdienst&quot; in German-occupied Poznań.

During the German occupation, many people were murdered, executed, tortured or detained in inhumane conditions, particularly at the notorious Fort VII concentration camp, set up in one of the late 19th-century defensive forts, and later at the camp in Żabikowo. In October 1939, the German police and &quot;Selbstschutz&quot; also carried out mass arrests of local priests (see &quot;Nazi persecution of the Catholic Church in Poland&quot;). Over 3,400 Polish prisoners of Fort VII, including college students, women and nuns, were massacred in nearby Dopiewiec and Dębienko. Several local Polish school principals and teachers were also murdered in the Mauthausen concentration camp. Mentally ill patients from the local municipal hospital were gassed in Fort VII, as part of &quot;Aktion T4&quot;.

Some 100,000 inhabitants were expelled to the General Government in the more-eastern part of German-occupied Poland. The aim of German policy was gradual extermination of Polish and Jewish population in the region, with the victims of German campaign estimated at 460,000. Many others were sent to Germany as forced labour or conscripted into the German army. Poznań was the seat the German Central Bureau for Resettlement (UWZ, &quot;Umwandererzentralstelle&quot;), a special German institution established in November 1939 to coordinate the expulsion of Poles from occupied Polish territories. Poznań&#x27;s Jewish population, which had numbered 2,000 in 1939, was largely murdered in the Holocaust. Property belonging to expelled or murdered Poles and Jews was often given to Volksdeutsche resettled from Baltic States, Eastern Europe and central Germany. Figures for 1944 show 94,000 Germans living in Poznań.

Poles were subjected to forced labour also in the city itself, and from 1941, the German labor office in Poznań demanded that Polish children as young as 12 register for work, but it is known that even ten-year-old children were forced to work. In 1943, the Germans also carried out deportations of kidnapped Polish children from Poznań to a camp for Polish children in Łódź, which was nicknamed &quot;little Auschwitz&quot; due to its terrible conditions.

From 1940 to 1945, the Germans operated the Stalag XXI-D prisoner-of-war camp for Allied POWs in Poznań.

The Polish resistance movement was active in the city. Several organizations were formed in Poznań, including &quot;Tajna Polska Organizacja Wojskowa&quot; (Secret Polish Military Organization), &#x27; (Poznań Military Organization), &#x27; (National Fighting Organization), &quot;Ojczyzna&quot; (Homeland) and &quot;Komitet Niesienia Pomocy&quot; (Relief Committee), with some later merged into larger structures. Regional branches of the nationwide Union of Armed Struggle, Bataliony Chłopskie, Gray Ranks and &quot;&quot; organizations were also founded. Activities included secret Polish schooling, printing and distribution of underground Polish press, sabotage actions, military trainings, espionage of German activity, providing aid to people in need, preparations for a planned uprising, and facilitating escapes of British prisoners of war from Stalag XXI-D. In June 1940, the Bureau of the Government Delegation for Poland for Polish territories annexed by Germany was founded, and in July 1940, even an underground Polish parliament was established in Poznań. The Germans cracked down on Polish resistance several times, with many Poles either executed or tortured and killed in prisons and concentration camps. In February 1943, a flying unit of the Union of Armed Struggle and Home Army carried out an operation to burn down Wehrmacht warehouses in the local river port, an action deemed one of the most spectacular in the region.

The Nazi authorities made further significant expansions to the city boundaries in 1940–42, incorporating most of the territory of today&#x27;s city, thus almost tripling its size to . They also replaced Polish names for districts with German ones (sometimes newly invented). The Polish names were restored after the war, but the expanded city boundaries were retained.

As the Soviet Red Army advanced into Poland in January 1945, Poznań was declared a &quot;Festung&quot;, meaning that it was to be defended at all costs. Greiser himself fled, but evacuation of civilians was forbidden until January 20. Soviet forces reached the city on January 25 and, following nine days of artillery bombardment, began their ground assault on February 18, aided by some Polish civilians and a unit of the 2nd Polish Army. On the night of February 22, the German commander, Ernst Gomell, committed suicide, and the following morning the remaining garrison surrendered. The struggle left over 55% of the city destroyed, including over 90% of the Old Town. For more details, see Battle of Poznań (1945).

==Since 1945==

Many Germans had fled the region as the Soviets advanced; the post-war expulsions of Germans from Polish territory in accordance with the Potsdam Agreement (and emigration of remaining Jews) left Poznań with an almost uniformly ethnically Polish population, which totalled 268,000 in 1946. During the early post-war years much of the city was rebuilt from ruins. The city again became the capital of Poznań Voivodeship, now within the communist People&#x27;s Republic of Poland. In 1950 the size of the voivodeship was reduced, and the city of Poznań itself was given separate voivodeship status.

In 1949, the 1572 Posnania asteroid was discovered at the Poznań Observatory, and later named after the city.

In June 1956, workers at the city&#x27;s Cegielski locomotive factory, the largest factory in Poland, demanded talks with Prime Minister Józef Cyrankiewicz to protest at low wages, lack of overtime pay, tax changes and food shortages. The government refused to talk, and after a series of strikes, on June 28 a workers&#x27; protest march was fired on by the authorities. The situation escalated; crowds ransacked the communist party headquarters and attacked the secret police headquarters, where they were repulsed by police fire. According to official figures, 67 people were killed; hundreds more were injured or arrested. The riots continued for two days until being quelled by the army. These protests are seen as an early expression of resistance to communist rule in Poland. For more details, see Poznań 1956 protests.

From the 1960s onwards intensive housing development took place, consisting mainly of pre-fabricated concrete blocks of flats. The largest areas of such development were Rataje and Winogrady. Later Piątkowo, which came within the city boundaries in 1974, would be used for similar large-scale building.

A major infrastructural change in the city centre, completed in the late 1960s, was the rerouting of the river Warta so that its main stream flowed in the former relief channel east of Chwaliszewo (as had been planned following the floods of 1889); a right branch was also created linking with the Cybina across the former Berdychowo dam (&quot;Tama Berdychowska&quot;), thus making Ostrów Tumski a true island between the two branches. The former main stream west of Chwaliszewo was filled in and the land reclaimed, and a new main road was built crossing the island, with bridges across both river branches, leading to Śródka (where significant demolition took place south of the main square).
In the administrative reforms of 1975, Poznań ceased to be a city with separate voivodeship status, and became the capital of a much smaller Poznań Voivodeship.

Following the early successes of the Solidarity movement, in 1981 a monument to the events and victims of June 1956 was erected on Adam Mickiewicz Square, with Lech Wałęsa attending. In 1983 Pope John Paul II visited Poznań.

In 1987 the most recent expansion of the city&#x27;s boundaries took place, with the addition of new areas mainly to the north, including Morasko, Radojewo and Kiekrz.

Following the fall of communism, the first free local government elections took place in 1990. A second papal visit took place in 1997. In 1998 a Weimar triangle meeting took place in Poznań between German chancellor Helmut Kohl, French president Jacques Chirac and Polish president Aleksander Kwaśniewski.

In 1997 transport communication between the northern estates of Winogrady and Piątkowo and the city centre was greatly improved with the opening of the Poznań fast tram route (&quot;Poznański Szybki Tramwaj&quot;, popularly &quot;Pestka&quot;). Poznań gained its first motorway connection in 2003 (part of the A2 &quot;autostrada&quot; running south of the city in the directions of Warsaw and Berlin).

With the Polish local government reforms of 1999, Poznań again became the capital of a larger voivodeship, now called Greater Poland Voivodeship. It also became the seat of a &quot;powiat&quot; (&quot;Poznań County&quot;), although the city itself acquired separate powiat status.
In 2006 Poland&#x27;s first F-16 Fighting Falcons arrived in Poznań. They are stationed at the 31st Air Base in Krzesiny in the south-east of the city.

Poznań continues to host regular trade fairs and international events, usually at the Poznań International Fair site. In December 2008 it hosted the United Nations Climate Change Conference. Poznań was also one of the host cities for the EuroBasket 2009 and 2012 European Football Championship.

In 2015, a medieval treasure, including 350 coins and 8,000 fragments of clay vessels, was discovered during archaeological excavations in the Old Town.

<doc id="789309" wikidata="Q978086" url="?curid=789309" title="Ecologist Party &quot;The Greens&quot;">
<text>The Ecologist Party &quot;The Greens&quot; (, , PEV) is a Portuguese eco-socialist political party. It is a member of the European Greens and a founding member of the European Federation of Green Parties.

It was the first Portuguese ecologist party, and since its foundation, in 1982, PEV has had a close relationship with the Portuguese Communist Party (PCP). From 1987 onwards, it entered all the legislative, and municipal elections as part of Unitary Democratic Coalition, which also includes the PCP. Between 1983 and 1987, PEV was part of the United People Alliance, to which the PCP also belonged. For this reason, PEV is often criticized for being an &quot;appendage&quot; of the PCP. People who expressed that opinion include former prime minister José Sócrates.

PEV holds many mandates in local assemblies, but, following the January 2022 election, it lost its parliamentary representation.

== History and general information ==
The Party was founded 1982, originally named the Portuguese Ecologist Movement – Party &quot;The Greens&quot; (&quot;Movimento Ecologista Português – Partido &quot;Os Verdes&quot;&quot;), by a group of Portuguese citizens interested in the promotion of the ecologist movement in Portuguese society, with the support of the Portuguese Communist Party, including in its founders one of its members, Zita Seabra.

In the end of the 1970s, Earth was facing new ecological problems, such as the greenhouse effect and the depletion of the ozone layer and the lack of awareness of this in Portuguese society, along with the lack of an organized Ecologist movement, led to the foundation of the &quot;Ecologist Party &quot;The Greens&quot;&quot; in order to put such problems on the political agenda.

The Party created regional groups immediately following its foundation, groups that have continued to grow since then. The growth of the Party throughout the country allowed many members to integrate the electoral lists of the CDU, some being elected to very different tasks. Currently (), The PEV has several members elected in Municipal Chambers, in Municipal Assemblies and in Parish Assemblies, but it has no members elected in the Assembly of the Republic (Portuguese parliament). There is some criticism of its close ties to the Communist Party. Given that PEV never stood in elections on its own, some right-wing politicians have gone to the point of nicknaming PEV &quot;The Watermelons – Greens Outside, Reds Inside&quot;. However, the official positions of both parties on certain questions can be quite different, of which the stance regarding bullfighting is an example.

The PEV is also present in the National Electoral Commission and also in the National Council of Education.
The youth wing of the Party is the Ecolojovem, founded in 1989, which is a founding member of the Federation of Young European Greens.

The PEV edits a newspaper, the &quot;Folha Verde&quot; (Green Leaf), which received several press prizes for its unique design and style.

The PEV supported the minority Socialist Costa Government (2015–2019) with a confidence and supply agreement.

In the 2022 legislative elections, the PEV lost its remaining parliamentary representation.

== Election results ==


In elections, the PEV is closely allied with the Portuguese Communist Party, first in the Unitary Democratic Coalition. This explains a nickname given to Os Verdes by some: &quot;melancias&quot; (lit. &quot;watermelons&quot;): green outside and red inside. The &quot;green&quot; here is a reference to the self-proclaimed ecologist nature of the party, while &quot;red&quot; means &quot;communist&quot;.

<text>Battlelords is an out-of-print collectible card game based on the Optimus Design Systems (ODS) licensed paper and pencil role-playing game titled &quot;Battlelords of the 23rd Century&quot;. The card game was released in 1995 and only one set was produced. Two planned expansion sets called &quot;Genesis&quot; and &quot;Arachnids&quot; never materialized. The card game was introduced by New Millennium Entertainment (now defunct). According to Allen Varney, the game was &quot;really good&quot; and &quot;as good as &quot;Star Wars&quot;, thought not quite as pretty&quot;. Varney also stated that the game had a &quot;steep learning curve, plays badly from a single starter, and the rulebook&#x27;s print is ludicrously small.&quot; The &quot;Battlelords of the 23rd Century&quot; license was later sold by ODS to SSDC, Inc. in September 1999.

<text>Prince Albert Kamehameha, formally Albert Edward Kauikeaouli Kaleiopapa a Kamehameha (May 20, 1858 – August 27, 1862), was the only son of Kamehameha IV and Queen Emma, who during his short life was the Crown Prince of the Kingdom of Hawaii. He was the godson of Queen Victoria.

==Early life==
He was born May 20, 1858, in the residence of &quot;Ihikapukalani&quot; that his father had built for his mother. The residence, oddly, had two names; the &quot;makai&quot; side was known as &quot;Kauluhinano&quot;, and the &quot;mauka&quot; side was known as &quot;Ihikapukalani&quot;.
Created Crown prince and heir apparent to the throne of the Kingdom of Hawaii on May 24, 1858, he was styled &quot;His Royal Highness the Prince of Hawaii&quot; by the Privy Council. Adored by the native Hawaiian public, he was affectionately known as &quot;Ka Haku O Hawaii&quot; (&quot;the Lord of Hawaii&quot;) and was believed to be last hope of the Kamehameha Dynasty. His birth was celebrated for many days not only in Honolulu, but throughout the islands. He was the first child to be born to a reigning Hawaiian monarch since Prince Keawe Aweula-o-Kalani in 1839, son of Kamehameha III, and the last ever to be born from any reigning Hawaiian monarch.

He was given the Hawaiian name Kauikeaouli Kaleiopapa after his adoptive grandfather Kauikeaouli who reigned as Kamehameha III. Translated from the Hawaiian language it means &quot;the beloved child of a long line of chiefs, a sign in the heavens.&quot; The King and Queen called their son &quot;Baby&quot;. However, when they spoke of him to their &quot;kahu&quot; (caretakers), it was as &quot;Kauikeaouli&quot;, which the Hawaiian people also used. He was named Albert Edward in honor of Albert Edward, Prince of Wales, the future King Edward VII of the United Kingdom. Despite the great differences in their kingdoms, Queen Emma and Queen Victoria would exchange letters and become lifelong friends.
Ten days after his birth, Mary Allen, second wife of the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court Elisha Hunt Allen, had a son Frederick. The two children became playmates, and Allen described the prince as &quot;an unusually sweet child, gentle and gentlemanly in his manners, bright and precocious and of a most happy, serene temperament&quot;.

Albert during his life was also made an honorary member of Fire Engine Company Number Four in Honolulu and was given his own Company Four red uniform. It was said that he would rather become a fireman. His four birthdays were national holidays.

==Death==
In August 1862, the usually serene child became restless, and his medical condition got progressively worse. The newspapers of the time reported the illness as &quot;brain fever,&quot; now known as meningitis. Writing much later, Queen Liliuokalani blamed the father for putting the child under a cold-water faucet as punishment for throwing a tantrum over a pair of boots. The parents did mistake a fever for sunstroke. A modern medical historian and Honolulu physician analyzed the possible causes of Albert&#x27;s death. They concluded the Prince most likely died from a case of appendicitis. Both the local and British naval doctors did not know the cause nor the treatment of his illness.
As the prince&#x27;s condition declined, Kamehameha IV and Queen Emma made a personal request to Queen Victoria to send a bishop from the Anglican Church to baptize the prince. They also requested Queen Victoria to be his godmother. Queen Victoria consented to both requests, and sent as a baptismal gift an elaborate silver christening cup, about three feet high. Bishop Thomas Nettleship Staley was sent but would not arrive until October. As the prince grew sicker, the American minister Ephraim W. Clark from Kawaiahao Church baptized the child on August 23. The Episcopal liturgy was used with the British Commissioner William Webb Follett Synge standing in for the godparents.

The Prince died on August 27, 1862, at the palace, four days after his baptism. His parents were grief-stricken, as they knelt by the side of the Prince&#x27;s bed. The Queen took her dead boy in her arms and, weeping over him, said to him, &quot;My Baby, my own Baby and you did not know me!&quot;
Prince Albert&#x27;s funeral was held on September 7, 1862. He was temporarily placed in a temporary tomb in front of the palace below a tamarind tree. Before the lid of the coffin closed, the King removed the star of diamonds from his uniform and laid it on the chest of his only son.

Afterwards, the King fell into despair, blaming himself for the loss of his son. The Queen rarely left the grave of her child and was given the name &quot;Kaleleokalani&quot; (The Flight of the Heavenly Chief), in memory of Albert, by her husband. The King then ordered the construction of the Royal Mausoleum in Nuuanu Valley to house his son&#x27;s body, since the old mausoleum had become too full. 
Today, the mausoleum is burial site of most of the members of the Hawaiian royal family. The King&#x27;s depression was so severe that he considered abdicating the throne. A year later, he would die as well. To express her grief, Queen Emma changed her name to Kaleleo(n)ālani &quot;Flight of the Heavenly Chief(s),&quot; to symbolize her double loss.

==Legacy==
His death left his father without a constitutionally recognized heir. Consequently, after his father&#x27;s death in 1864, the Kuhina Nui (Albert&#x27;s aunt) had to fill in the vacant office of head of state for a day until the Legislature could decide upon the accession of his uncle as king. 
Besides the Royal Mausoleum, the four-year-old prince left other marks on Hawaii. The area of Princeville on the island of Kauai was named in honor of the young prince by Scotsman Robert Crichton Wyllie, Minister of Foreign Affairs to Kamehameha III and IV, after a visit by the Kamehameha IV family in 1860. In 1867 Elisha Allen bought the property and developed it into a sugarcane plantation.
It was developed into a resort with its main street named Ka Huku Road at .

The road to Kamehameha III&#x27;s birthplace is named Kaleiopapa Street near Keauhou Bay at on the island of Hawaii. The Leiopapa a Kamehameha Building (the State Office Tower) in downtown Honolulu is also named for him. According to local folklore, his ghost is said to inhabit the building at 235 South Beretania Street, .

<text>The Pensioners&#x27; Party (&quot;Partito Pensionati&quot;, PP) is a centrist Italian political party, whose aim is to represent the interests of pensioners.

==History==
The Pensioners&#x27; Party was founded in 1987 in Milan, and its current leader is Carlo Fatuzzo.

In the 2004 European Parliament election, it gained 1.1% of the national vote and elected its leader to the European Parliament, where he sits in the European People&#x27;s Party–European Democrats group.

On 4 February 2006, the party joined The Union, the centre-left coalition led by Romano Prodi, and was decisive in the result of the 2006 general election (the PP scored 0.9% and the centre-left won by a 0.1% margin), but soon after the election the alliance with the centre-left turned cold and tense. In the European Parliament, Antonio Tajani (Forza Italia, Vice President of the European People&#x27;s Party), tried successfully to convince Fatuzzo to return to the centre-right coalition.

Finally, on 20 November 2006, Carlo Fatuzzo, in a press conference along with Antonio Tajani and Fabrizio Cicchitto (national deputy-coordinator of Forza Italia), announced that its party was re-joining the centre-right House of Freedoms coalition.

In the 2008 general election the Pensioners&#x27; Party presented its candidates into The People of Freedom, but it didn&#x27;t gained any seat.

In the 2009 European Parliament election, the party ran as part of The Autonomy, an electoral coalition including The Right, the Movement for the Autonomies and the Alliance of the Centre.

In 2012 the party enters for the first time in the Italian Parliament with one deputy, Lino Miserotti, who replaces the outgoing deputy Marco Airaghi, and with one senator, Giacinto Boldrini, who replaces the deceased senator Gianpiero Carlo Cantoni.

In the 2013 general election the Pensioners&#x27; Party ran with the Centre-right coalition, getting only the 0.16% of the vote for the Chamber and the 0.40% for the Senate.

In the 2018 general election the party signed a cooperation Agreement with Forza Italia and some members of the party were candidate in FI&#x27;s lists, including party&#x27;s secretary Carlo Fatuzzo, who was elected in the Chamber of Deputies.

<text>Fernando Jacob Hubertina Henrika Ricksen (27 July 1976 – 18 September 2019) was a Dutch professional footballer who played as a right back and central midfielder. After winning Eerste Divisie titles with Fortuna Sittard and AZ, he joined Rangers for £3.75 million in 2000. In six years with the club from Glasgow, he won two Scottish Premier League titles, two Scottish Cups and three Scottish League Cups. He left in 2006 for Zenit Saint Petersburg, initially on loan, and won honours including the UEFA Cup and UEFA Super Cup in 2008. He was dismissed by Zenit in 2009, and spent the final years of his career back at Fortuna Sittard. Internationally, he earned 12 caps for the Netherlands between 2000 and 2003.

Ricksen was elected to Rangers&#x27;s Hall of Fame in 2014. He suffered from motor neurone disease and died from the disease on 18 September 2019, aged 43.

==Club career==
===Rangers===
Ricksen, formerly of Fortuna Sittard, joined Rangers in 2000 from Dutch team AZ Alkmaar for a transfer fee of £3.75 million.

Ricksen endured a difficult start to his Rangers career, culminating in him being substituted after a torrid 21 minutes in a 6–2 defeat to Celtic. On his second trip to Celtic Park six months later, he was sent off before half-time in another defeat. He had been dropped for the two intervening derbies.

In November 2000 Ricksen became the first player in Scottish football to be banned retrospectively on television evidence. His Kung Fu-style kick on Darren Young had been missed by the referee but caught on camera, leading to a five-game ban. Ricksen subsequently used his personal website to suggest Young required &quot;straightening out.&quot;

2003–04 proved to be a failed season for Rangers, with the departure of several players from the treble-winning season, including Barry Ferguson and Lorenzo Amoruso. Ricksen, however, proved to be an important member of the Rangers team which finished second, playing 42 games, despite several injuries and disciplinary problems throughout the season. In October 2003 Ricksen pushed then Rangers chairman John McClelland into a swimming pool before a match against Panathinaikos in Athens. The same week he was banned from the Netherlands national team for smashing a hotel door down after a night out. After the events Rangers banned Ricksen from talking to the media and manager McLeish said &quot;We would rather have Fernando on the back pages and we have told him that.&quot;

In March 2004 Ricksen was again banned by the SFA video review panel. He had elbowed Derek Riordan in a CIS Cup defeat to Hibernian, resulting in a four-game ban and a £10,000 fine from his club.

The highlight of Ricksen&#x27;s career at Rangers came in the 2004–05 season seeing him jointly win the SPFA player of the year award after scoring nine goals from midfield in his 40 appearances for the club, helping Rangers to a league and league cup double.

It remained unclear whether Ricksen would be seen as a key member of the Rangers team under new manager Paul Le Guen for the 2006–07 season. An alcohol-fueled incident involving a passenger on Rangers&#x27; outbound flight to their pre-season camp in South Africa, led to Ricksen being sent home by Le Guen, who later described his behaviour as &quot;inappropriate and unacceptable for the way in which I have asked my players to conduct themselves.&quot;

On 30 March 2014, Ricksen was inducted into the Rangers Hall of Fame along with Lee McCulloch and Nacho Novo.

===Zenit Saint Petersburg===
Ricksen moved on loan to Zenit Saint Petersburg on a season long loan on 9 August 2006, the Russian club&#x27;s manager being Dick Advocaat, who signed Ricksen for Rangers. Two weeks later he returned to Ibrox in a friendly between Rangers and Zenit and was booed after injuring Chris Burke with what was described as a reckless tackle. Weeks later, Ricksen engaged in an on-field fist-fight with Zenit captain Vladislav Radimov.
On 28 November 2006, Zenit Saint Petersburg announced that they bought out Ricksen&#x27;s transfer from Rangers. Despite this, Ricksen again fought with Radimov during a match in January 2007. Ricksen was an unused substitute in the 2008 UEFA Cup Final, in which Zenit triumphed over Rangers. In January 2009, after two and a half years in Russia, Ricksen was demoted to Zenit&#x27;s reserve side, having previously refused to leave the club. On 28 August 2009, FC Zenit terminated his contract because of Ricksen&#x27;s constant disciplinary misbehaviours.

===Return to Sittard===
After being without a club for more than a year, on 2 December 2010 Ricksen agreed to rejoin his childhood team Fortuna Sittard, involved in their battle to escape relegation from the Eerste Divisie, signing a contract till the end of the season.

==International career==
Ricksen earned the first of 12 caps for the Netherlands on 15 November 2000, playing two minutes as a substitute for Paul Bosvelt in a 3–2 friendly win over Spain at the Estadio Olimpico de la Cartuja in Seville. His final cap was on 30 April 2003, a 1–1 home draw with Portugal in another friendly.

In June 2003, after a UEFA Euro 2004 qualifier away to Belarus, Ricksen got drunk and kicked down two hotel room doors. He was subsequently ostracised by manager Dick Advocaat and did not play for the Netherlands again.

==Personal life==
On 25 December 2000, Ricksen was the subject of a report to the procurator fiscal after an incident when his car crashed into a lamppost in the early hours of the morning. Ricksen denied charges of drink-driving, careless driving, committing a breach of the peace by shouting and swearing, and conducting himself in a disorderly manner. At a trial in February 2003 Ricksen was found to have been twice over the limit and was convicted of drunk-driving, receiving a £500 fine and a 12-month driving ban. He was acquitted of the other charges.

In October 2003, Ricksen was fined £7,000 after being convicted of a breach of the peace and assault in relation to a drunken late-night house party he held the previous November. Having initially denied the charges, in court Ricksen admitted conducting himself in a disorderly manner, causing a breach of the peace, repeatedly igniting fireworks, shouting and swearing and then threatening and assaulting a neighbour who had complained. During the 2004–05 football season, Ricksen abstained from alcohol. In July 2006 Ricksen checked himself into the Sporting Chance Clinic for residential treatment relating to alcohol abuse and anger management. For the previous six months he had been receiving out-patient treatment from the clinic.

Ricksen&#x27;s daughter Isabella was born in 2011. In 2014 Ricksen married Veronika, who is Russian. A documentary titled &quot;Fernando Ricksen: Hard Times&quot; was aired on Sky Sports 1 on 3 May 2015. Ricksen was Catholic but later revealed his wish to convert to Orthodoxy.

Ricksen wrote an autobiography, &quot;Fighting Spirit&quot;, which was published in 2014.

==Illness and death==
On 30 October 2013, Ricksen revealed that he was terminally ill and had been diagnosed with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (motor neurone disease). He set up a charity that raised over £1 million for research into the condition.

Ricksen died on 18 September 2019 in St Andrew&#x27;s Hospice in Airdrie, North Lanarkshire, Scotland, aged 43. His funeral was held at Wellington Church in Glasgow on 25 September, attended by dignitaries of Celtic and Rangers, after which he was cremated at Linn crematorium, in a private ceremony.

<text>A car phone is a mobile radio telephone specifically designed for and fitted into an automobile.
This service originated with the Bell System and was first used in St. Louis, Missouri, on June 17, 1946.

==Overview==
===United States===
The original equipment weighed , and there were initially only three channels for all the users in the metropolitan area (other sources claim six channels). 

On October 2, 1946, Motorola communications equipment carried the first calls on Illinois Bell Telephone Company&#x27;s new car radiotelephone service in Chicago. Due to the small number of radio frequencies available, the service quickly reached capacity.

In 1964 AT&amp;T introduced the Improved Mobile Telephone Service (IMTS). More licenses were added, bringing the total to 32 channels across three bands (See IMTS frequencies). This service was used at least into the 1980s in large portions of North America.

In 1968, almost 22 years after the initial network, the US government started to consider reserving spectrum for land mobile radio communication, to be used by private persons. The FCC initiated proceedings which resulted in the reservation of 75 MHz of spectrum in 1970. During the 1970s the FCC changed its mind a few times, such as in 1974 when it reduced the spectrum to 40 MHz. 

On May 4, 1981 the FCC released the rules for providing commercial cellular service. Over the next few years the FCC received hundreds of applications for 90 markets. The first cellular system went live on October the 13th 1983 in the Chicago market.

===Finland===

In Finland, car phone service was first available in 1971 on the zero generation ARP (Autoradiopuhelin, or Car Radiophone) service. This was succeeded in 1982 by the 1G system NMT (Nordic Mobile Telephone), used across Scandinavia and in other often remote areas.

===Sweden===
Sweden started relatively early with plans for mobile telephony service trials at the end of the 1940s. At the end of the 1950s, a trial system was built, using two channels, providing service for five mobile stations. In 1956, two commercial systems were brought online, each equipped with four channels. There were 125 subscribers by the end of the 1960s, when the network was shut down. 

Meanwhile, other mobile networks were built in the 1960s and later on, and plans were made for future networks, cumulating in the cooperation for the NMT system.

===Germany===
====West Germany====

In West Germany, the car phone service was first released in 1958 as the A-Netz service (&quot;Netz&quot; being German for network). In 1971, it reached its capacity limit of almost 11,000 subscribers and was succeeded by the B-Netz in 1972, which featured direct dialing rather than a human operator to connect calls. However, in order to reach a subscriber, one would still need to know their location since the handset would assume the local area code of the base station serving it. It was succeeded in 1985 by the C-Netz 1G system.

The C-Netz was replaced by the D-Netz, a 2G GSM system, starting in 1992. With two licensees, one building and operating the D1-Netz, the other one building and operating the D2-Netz. Both on the 900 MHz band. The D-Netz was later complemented, not replaced, by the E-Netz. Again two licenses were granted for an E1-Netz and an E2-Netz, and the technology was called DCS 1800 - a GSM variant for the 1800 MHz band. These D-Netz and E-Netz networks were where the main shift from car phones towards mobile (handheld) phones occurred.

====East Germany====
East Germany did develop an analog radio phone network. It was called URTES-Netz (&quot;UHF-Radio-Telefonie-System&quot; network). But the network was never used in East Germany (with one notable exception) due to fear by the Stasi of not having control over the communication.

In 1979 Mexico was looking for a radio phone network and awarded East Germany with the contract. Over a period of 17 month the system was then developed in East Germany from scratch and the equipment produced in East Germany. It was installed in 1981 in Mexico with a maximum capacity of 120 stations. The stations were given the type designation &quot;UDS 721 U&quot;. The call signs used during testing were &quot;Blaumeise&quot; (blue tit) followed by a number. A station weighted approximately 10 kg.

Typically the stations were installed at fixed locations in rural areas. However, one station was reportedly installed by request of the governor of Guerrero, Alejandro Cervantes Delgado in his car, making it the first, and possible only car phone in the network. A prototype of that telephone was briefly shown in a TV report about the development of the URTES network. 

Later on additional URTES networks were built in Mexico and other countries, in total half a dozen or so. 

There was a significant lack of fixed network telephone capacity in East Germany after the East German state collapsed. One attempt to bridge the gap was to use an URTES network in East Germany, making it the only live deployment of such a network where it was originally developed. However, the West German analog C-Netz was quickly extended to East Germany. The digital 2G D-Netz was also built in East Germany from 1992 onward. For a period of time C-Netz and later D-Netz car phones and lug-gable phones were a staple of business persons in East Germany.

===United Kingdom===
The UK started its TACS system in 1985. TACS was a modified version of the US AMPS system. TACS was replaced by GSM in the 1990s.

===North America===
In North America, car phones typically used the Mobile Telephone Service (MTS), which was first used in St. Louis, or Improved Mobile Telephone Service (IMTS) before giving way to analog cellular service (AMPS) in 1984. AMPS technology was discontinued in the United States in 2008.

Since a traditional car phone uses a high-power transmitter and external antenna, it is ideal for rural or undeveloped areas where mobile handsets may not work well or at all. However, due to current U.S. Federal Communications Commission regulations, carriers must pay penalties for activating any equipment that is not an E911 compliant device, such as analog.

In the 1980s, the car phone was more popular than the mobile phone. However, as mobile phones became lighter and more affordable during the mobile phone boom in the 1990s, car phones became less common. By the 2000s, car phones had become uncommon due to the convenience of mobile phones along with in-car mobile phone integrative technologies such as Bluetooth.

There were still some car phones available as recently as 2008, including the Nokia 810 and the Motorola VC6096 for use with GSM networks and a car phone made by &quot;NAL Research&quot; for the Iridium satellite network. Motorola provided US customers with the m800 and m900 car phones, for use with CDMA and GSM networks respectively. Some car phones had colour screens and supported high-speed data connections as well as the ability to access SIM cards stored in other phones via Bluetooth.

Since 2008, many automobiles have featured integrated, &quot;hands-free&quot; systems to utilize a consumer&#x27;s mobile phone, via a Bluetooth wireless link or use an integrated transceiver. The systems use an internally mounted microphone, and the car&#x27;s audio system, and may feature voice activation and control.

<text>William Pitt Leleiohoku II, born Kalahoʻolewa (January 10, 1855 – April 9, 1877), was a prince of the Hawaiian Kingdom and member of the reigning House of Kalākaua. 

At birth, Leleiohoku was &quot;hānai&quot; (informally adopted) by Ruth Keʻelikōlani and later legally adopted by her in 1862 as the heir to her vast land holdings. He was educated at St. Alban&#x27;s College, a precursor of the present ʻIolani School. After finishing his education, he worked in the governmental Foreign Office and served as an officer on the personal military staff of King Lunalilo. On February 14, 1874, his brother Kalākaua was elected king after the death of Lunalilo. Declared heir apparent to his childless brother, Leleiohoku was expected to inherit the throne of Hawaii. He also served as a Privy Councilor and member of the House of Nobles in the Legislature of the Kingdom of Hawaii. 

During Kalākaua&#x27;s trip to the United States to negotiate the Reciprocity Treaty of 1875, Leleiohoku ruled as regent from November 17, 1874, to February 15, 1875. He died at the age of 22 from rheumatic fever resulting in the proclamation of his sister Liliʻuokalani as the next heir to the throne. Leleiohoku and his siblings are honored by the Hawaiian Music Hall of Fame as &quot;Na Lani ʻEhā&quot; (&quot;The Heavenly Four&quot;) for their patronage and enrichment of Hawaii&#x27;s musical culture and history. An accomplished musical composer, Leleiohoku is remembered for composing many folk songs including &quot;Kāua I Ka Huahuaʻi&quot;, which was adapted into the popular American song &quot;Hawaiian War Chant&quot;.

==Early life and family==

Leleiohoku was born on January 10, 1855, in Honolulu on the island of Oʻahu, to Analea Keohokālole and Caesar Kapaʻakea. According to Hawaiian custom, he was named after an event linked to his birth. He was given the name &quot;Kalahoʻolewa&quot;, meaning &quot;the day of the funeral&quot; in the Hawaiian language, after the royal funeral of King Kamehameha III which occurred on the same day as his birth.
Kapaʻakea and Keohokālole were political advisors to Kamehameha III and later to his successor Kamehameha IV. His mother was the daughter of ʻAikanaka and Kamaʻeokalani while his father was the son of Kamanawa II (half-brother of ʻAikanaka) and Kamokuiki. Their family were of the aliʻi class of the Hawaiian nobility and were collateral relations of the reigning House of Kamehameha, sharing common descent from the 18th-century &quot;aliʻi nui&quot; (supreme monarch) Keaweʻīkekahialiʻiokamoku. From his parents, he also descended from Keaweaheulu and Kameʻeiamoku, two of the five royal counselors of Kamehameha I during his conquest of the Kingdom of Hawaii. Kameʻeiamoku, the grandfather of both her mother and father, was depicted, along with his royal twin Kamanawa, on the Hawaiian coat of arms. Leleiohoku and his siblings traced their high rank from their mother&#x27;s line of descent. They referred to themselves as members the &quot;Keawe-a-Heulu line&quot;, although later historians would refer to the family as the House of Kalākaua. 

The youngest surviving child of a large family, his biological siblings included: James Kaliokalani, David Kalākaua, Liliʻuokalani, Anna Kaʻiulani, Kaʻiminaʻauao, and Miriam Likelike. He and his siblings were &quot;hānai&quot; (informally adopted) to other family members. The Hawaiian custom of &quot;hānai&quot; is an informal form of adoption between extended families practiced by Hawaiian royals and commoners alike. Shortly after his birth, he became the &quot;hānai&quot; son of Princess Ruth Keʻelikōlani. She renamed him after her deceased first husband High Chief William Pitt Leleiohoku, the son of Prime Minister Kalanimoku. The English name &quot;William Pitt&quot; was originally chosen by Kalanimoku in honor of the British Prime Minister William Pitt the Younger. The Hawaiian name Leleiohoku means &quot;Fled in the time of Hoku&quot; and commemorates the day Kamehameha I died on the Hawaiian calendar in 1819. Keʻelikōlani was the half-sister of King Kamehameha IV and his successor Kamehameha V and served as the Governess of the island of Hawaii. She lost both her first husband in 1848 and their only surviving son John William Pitt Kīnaʻu in 1859. In 1862, through her second marriage with Isaac Young Davis, she gave birth to another son named Keolaokalani, who she gave to her cousin Bernice Pauahi Bishop in &quot;hānai&quot; just hours after his birth. This action infuriated her half-brother Kamehameha V who wanted the child as a potential heir. He demanded Keʻelikōlani to legally adopt Leleiohoku and give Keolaokalani in legal adoption to Pauahi. Thus, Leleiohoku became heir to her vast holding of most of the Kamehameha lands which only increased after the deaths of her half-brothers.
In her 1898 memoir &quot;Hawaii&#x27;s Story by Hawaii&#x27;s Queen&quot;, her sister Liliʻuokalani described the event surrounding the drama:
==Education and early career==

Leleiohoku was educated at the St. Alban&#x27;s College established by the Anglican Church of Hawaii in Honolulu. Founded by Bishop Thomas Nettleship Staley and his assistants Archdeacon George Mason and Reverend Edmund Ibbotson, the school was located in the Pauoa Valley on Oahu. In 1863, the school was relocated and merged with the Luaʻehu School in Lahaina, Maui, established by the Anglican Reverend William R. Scott and later administered by Archdeacon Mason. In 1870, the school was relocated back to its original site on Oahu. These institutions were the precursors of the present ʻIolani School in Honolulu. He was taught by Ibbotson and later Alatau T. Atkinson who became principal of the school after the departure of Bishop Staley.
At the school, he developed a friendship with Curtis P. Iaukea, a royal retainer of King Kamehameha IV. Their bond was later compared to the friendship of Damon and Pythias. 
Some of his other classmates included Samuel Nowlein and Robert Hoapili Baker, both of whom were politicians in later life.

Upon completing his formal education at St. Alban&#x27;s in 1872, Leleiohoku served as a clerk in the Foreign Office. In this capacity, he worked and was taught governmental affairs by William Jarrett, the Chief Clerk and Secretary of the Foreign Office.

When King Kamehameha V died in 1872 with no heir, the 1864 Constitution of the Kingdom of Hawaii called for the legislature to elect the next monarch. By both popular vote and the unanimous vote in the legislature, Lunalilo became the first elected king of Hawaii. On January 25, 1873, the new king commissioned Leleiohoku as major of the military staff of the Governor of Oahu under his brother-in-law John Owen Dominis. His brother Kalākaua was appointed as a colonel on the king&#x27;s personal military staff around the same time. Although the kingdom had an army, it was composed of the King&#x27;s Royal Guards and volunteer companies.

==Heir to the throne ==

Lunalilo died without an heir in 1874. In the election that followed, Leleiohoku&#x27;s brother, David Kalākaua, ran against Emma, the dowager queen of Kamehameha IV. On February 12, 1874, the legislative assembly voted thirty-nine to six in favor of Kalākaua over Emma. The legislature&#x27;s choice of Kalākaua and the subsequent announcement caused a riot at the courthouse. To quell the civil disruption, American and British troops were landed from three warships in the harbor with the permission of the Hawaiian government, and the rioters were arrested.
Plans were discussed to marry Leleiohoku to Queen Emma, who was eighteen years his senior; she refused such a match.

After the 1874 election, King Kalākaua concerned himself with establishing a line of succession to the throne since he and his wife Kapiʻolani were childless. In the absence of legitimate children, Article 22 of the 1864 Constitution gave the monarch the power to appoint a successor or heir with the consent of the House of Nobles. Thus, Leleiohoku was named the heir apparent to the throne and publicly proclaimed as such on February 14, 1874. He was also granted the title of Prince and style of &quot;His Royal Highness&quot;. King Kalākaua also gave royal titles and styles to their sisters, Princess Lydia Kamakaʻeha Dominis and Princess Miriam Likelike Cleghorn.

He also became a member of the Privy Council of State, an advisory body for the king, and the House of Nobles, the upper chamber of the legislature. He sat in on, and participated in, the legislative assembly of 1876 during the regular session from April 29 to September 30.
Kalākaua went on a state visit the United States from 1874 to 1875 to negotiate the Reciprocity Treaty of 1875, becoming the first reigning monarch to do so. While the king was absent, Leleiohoku ruled as regent from November 17, 1874, to February 15, 1875.

An accomplished musician, Leleiohoku founded several royal choral societies including the Kawaihau Glee Club. During the regency period, Leleiohoku’s group would compete with the singing troupes organized by his sisters Liliʻuokalani and Likelike. In later life, Liliʻuokalani admitted that &quot;those of Prince Leleiohoku were really in advance of those of his two sisters, although perhaps this was due to the fact that the singing-club of the regent was far superior to any that we could organize; it consisted in a large degree of the very purest and sweetest male voices to be found amongst the native Hawaiians.&quot;

From 1874 to 1890, the Leleiohoku Guards, which Prince Leleiohoku gave his name, was formed as a volunteer company of cavalry in the army of the Kingdom of Hawaii. Leleiohoku served as the captain of this regiment during his lifetime. 
The ranks of this regiment, along with the other known volunteer companies, were composed mainly of Hawaiian and part-Hawaiian officers with a few white officers. Each unit was subject to call for active service when necessary. An 1888 military act passed by the legislature reduced the size of the army to four volunteer companies: the Honolulu Rifles, the King&#x27;s Own, the Queen&#x27;s Own, the Prince&#x27;s Own, and the Leleiohoku Guard. In 1890, another military act further restricted the army to just the King&#x27;s Royal Guards effectively abolishing the Leleiohoku Guards.

==Death and funeral==
For the last two months of his life, Leleiohoku suffered from acute rheumatic fever and was bedridden for the final three or four weeks. The &quot;Hawaiian Gazette&quot;, noted that he was &quot;often suffering intense pain, but no fears of any fatal result had been entertained until the day preceding his death, when his symptom became more unfavorable.&quot; Treated by doctors, he was expected to recover until his symptoms worsened. Leleiohoku died at ʻIolani Palace, at 12:40 am, on April 10, 1877, at the age of 22. The ultimate cause of death was rheumatic fever to the heart. The firing of minute guns from the Punchbowl Battery in the morning announced the prince&#x27;s death to an unexpecting public. , anchored in Honolulu Harbor, flew the Hawaiian flag at half-mast. His niece Princess Kaʻiulani would also die of rheumatic fever in the joints in 1899. This has led historians to believe the family may have been more susceptible to streptococcal infections (specifically, group A β-hemolytic streptococcus) because of their Polynesian blood.

Because Leleiohoku was unmarried and had no children, his brother King Kalākaua named their sister Liliʻuokalani as his heir apparent.
Leleiohoku&#x27;s &quot;hānai&quot; mother, Keʻelikōlani, wanted to be named heir, but the king&#x27;s cabinet ministers objected as that would place Bernice Pauahi Bishop, her first cousin, next in line.

After his funeral, Leleiohoku was buried in the Royal Mausoleum at Mauna ʻAla on April 25, 1874. His coffin was placed next to those of his parents Kapaʻakea and Keohokālole. On June 24, 1910, in a ceremony officiated by his sister Queen Liliʻuokalani, his and his family&#x27;s remains were transferred to the underground Kalākaua Crypt after the main mausoleum building was converted into a chapel.

==Legacy==
Leleiohoku&#x27;s death was greatly mourned by the nation since high hopes and anticipations were placed on him as the future monarch of Hawaii. The United States Minister to Hawaii Henry A. Peirce commented on Leleiohoku&#x27;s prospect as ruler: &quot;Of correct morals, well-educated and accomplished, the late prince promised to become, had he lived to ascend the throne, a wise and popular sovereign.&quot;

In 1875, the Hawaiian postal service issued a twelve cent, black on white postage stamp featuring a portrait of Leleiohoku in uniform. The stamp was created to meet the requirements of the postal convention made with the New South Wales government in 1874. A mauve variation of the stamp was issued in 1883. Both varieties were in use until the Republic of Hawaii in 1894.

Leleiohoku&#x27;s life was dramatized in &quot;Almost a King&quot; by local Hawaiian playwright Clarence Waipa, which originally premiered in 1979 as the first act of a trilogy at St. Joseph High School in Hilo. The trilogy consists of &quot;Almost a King&quot; produced in 1979, &quot;Liliʻu E&quot;, produced in 1982 and &quot;Kaʻiulani&quot;, produced in 1986. This play was combined with &quot;Kaʻiulani&quot;, forming the first act of &quot;Ka ʻIu O Hoku&quot; by the Kamehameha Schools Hawai&#x27;i High School Hō&#x27;ike in 2017.

===Compositions===

Coming from a family of composers, Leleiohoku was regarded as the most talented of the four royal siblings. Historian George Kanahele said, &quot;In composition, he was well advanced of Likelike and Liliʻuokalani&quot;.
Today, Leleiohoku and his siblings are recognized by the Hawaiian Music Hall of Fame as &quot;Na Lani ʻEhā&quot; (&quot;The Heavenly Four&quot;) for their patronage and enrichment of Hawaii&#x27;s musical culture and history.

Influenced by Henri Berger, the bandmaster of the Royal Hawaiian Band, Leleiohoku learned from and adapted elements of the folk tunes of visiting merchants, sailors and foreign settlers of Hawaii into his compositions. Leleiohoku was also an expert guitarist. More influenced by secular topics than his other siblings, Leleiohoku composed many love songs including &quot;Adios Ke Aloha&quot;, regarded as his best composition, and &quot;Moani Ke Ala&quot;. One of his composition &quot;Kāua I Ka Huahuaʻi&quot; was adapted by Johnny Noble into the popular American song, &quot;Hawaiian War Chant&quot;.

His sister Liliʻuokalani wrote in her memoir, &quot;Hawaii’s Story by Hawaii’s Queen&quot;:

<text>A bandstand (sometimes music kiosk) is a circular, semicircular or polygonal structure set in a park, garden, pier, or indoor space, designed to accommodate musical bands performing concerts. A simple construction, it both creates an ornamental focal point and also serves acoustic requirements while providing shelter for the changeable weather, if outdoors. In form bandstands resemble ornamental European garden gazebos modeled on outdoor open-sided pavilions found in Asian countries from early times.

==Origins==
During the 18th and 19th centuries this type of performance building was found in the fashionable pleasure gardens of London and Paris where musicians played for guests dining and dancing.
They were later built in public spaces in many countries as practical amenities for outdoor entertainment.

Many bandstands in the United Kingdom originated in the Victorian era as the British brass band movement gained popularity. Smaller bandstands are often not much more than gazebos. Much larger bandstands such as that at the Hollywood Bowl may be called bandshells and usually take a shape similar to a quarter sphere. Though many bandstands fell into disuse and disrepair in the post-World War II period, the cultural project the Bandstand Marathon has seen bandstands across the UK utilized for free live concerts since 2008.

==History in Britain==
The parks where most bandstands are found were created in response to the Industrial Revolution, when local authorities realized worsening conditions in urban areas meant there was an increasing need for green, open spaces where the general public could relax. The first bandstands in Britain were built in the Royal Horticultural Society Gardens, South Kensington in 1861. Bandstands quickly became hugely popular and were considered a necessity in parks by the end of the 19th century.
To assist the war effort during World War II, iron fittings were removed from many bandstands to be melted down and transformed into weapons and artillery. Many bandstands fell into disrepair and were boarded up in the late 1940s and 1950s. Other attractions – such as the cinema and television – were becoming increasing popular and traditional recreational parks lost much of their appeal.

Between 1979 and 2001, more than half of the 438 bandstands in historic parks across the country were demolished, vandalized or in a chronic state of disuse. In the late 1990s the National Lottery and Heritage Lottery Fund invested a substantial sum in the restoration and rebuilding of bandstands across the country. As a result of this funding, over eighty bandstands were either fully restored or replaced. Between 1996 and 2010 there was over £500 million worth of investments in parks - a significant chunk of this money was spent on the restoration and building of bandstands.

==History in United States==
Gazebo bandstands appeared in the United States after the Civil War (1861–65) to accommodate the brass and percussion &quot;cornet&quot; bands found in towns of every size. Styles ranged from exotic ″Moorish″ designs to ordinary wood pavilions with mill work trim. They were found in parks, court house squares and fairgrounds. Following the Worlds Columbian Exposition (world&#x27;s fair) of 1893 in Chicago, amusement parks based on the famous Midway became popular. These were often established by trolley companies to provide a trolley destination on weekends. Bandstands and dance pavilions were an essential feature of these parks. Most are no longer in existence.

After 1900, rectangular pavilions enclosing a stage and acoustical shell providing directional sound appeared in many parks. Styles of acoustical shells took several forms during the 20th century. In 1913 Frank Lloyd Wright designed a freestanding bandshell with edge–supported cantilever roof and no side posts for his Midway Gardens (demolished 1929) in Chicago. Variations on this design were built later in the century.

The 1928 Hollywood Bowl shell in California designed by Wright&#x27;s son Lloyd Wright was a prototype for the streamlined concrete bandshell of the 1930s. Many of these shells with their distinctive concentric arches survive as landmarks in parks across the US.

Preservation of historic bandstands is by local initiative. Some are on the National Register of Historic Places, usually as part of a historic district. Continuous use as performing venues is a good incentive to keep them maintained. When this is not possible they must be maintained solely as historic landmarks. In many places a succession of bandstands, sometimes as many as three or four, were built on the same site. Because of this practice it is important to preserve postcards and photographs of earlier structures as a historical record.

== Notable bandstands ==
=== England ===
In 1993, the Deal Memorial Bandstand was opened as memorial to the eleven bandsmen killed by 1989 Deal barracks bombing. The bandstand was erected by public subscription and is maintained by volunteers.

A good example of a semi-circular bandstand is the Eastbourne Bandstand, built in 1935 to replace a circular bandstand that stood on cast iron stilts. Herne Bay, Kent contains a totally enclosed bandstand with a stage and cafe area, topped with copper-clad domes.

There is a very old bandstand at Horsham&#x27;s Carfax, built in 1892 by Walter Macfarlane &amp; C at the Saracen Foundry in Glasgow, and another one in its adjacent park. It was moved slightly from its original location, to better accommodate pedestrians and then refurbished in 1978 with funds raised by the Horsham Society and with council funding. In 1992, the original design was rediscovered in museum archives and it was then restored to its original colour scheme.

<text>The Adventures of Ozzie and Harriet is an American television sitcom that aired on ABC from October 3, 1952, to April 23, 1966, and starred the real-life Nelson family. After a long run on radio, the show was brought to television, where it continued its success, initially running simultaneously on radio and TV. In terms of seasons, it was the longest running live-action sitcom in American television history until &quot;It&#x27;s Always Sunny in Philadelphia&quot; surpassed it on December 1, 2021 (though it still retains the record in terms of total episodes produced: 435). The series starred the entertainment duo of Ozzie Nelson and his wife, singer Harriet Nelson, and their sons, David and Ricky. Don DeFore had a recurring role as the Nelsons&#x27; neighbor &quot;Thorny&quot;.

==Background==

===Early radio days===
In the early 1930s, a booking at the Glen Island Casino in New Rochelle, New York, gained national network radio exposure for Ozzie Nelson&#x27;s orchestra. After three years together with the orchestra, Ozzie and Harriet signed to appear regularly on the radio show, &quot;The Baker&#x27;s Broadcast&quot; (1933–1938), hosted first by Joe Penner, then by Robert Ripley (famed for Ripley&#x27;s Believe it or Not!), and finally by cartoonist Feg Murray. The couple married on October 8, 1935, during this series run, and realized working together in radio would keep them together more than continuing their musical careers separately.

===&quot;The Red Skelton Show&quot;===
In 1941, the Nelsons joined the cast of &quot;The Red Skelton Show&quot;, also providing much of the show&#x27;s music. The couple stayed with the series for three years. They also built their radio experience by guest appearances, together and individually, on many top radio shows, from comedies such as &quot;The Fred Allen Show&quot;, to the mystery titan &quot;Suspense&quot;, in a 1947 episode called &quot;Too Little to Live On&quot;.

===&quot;The Adventures of Ozzie and Harriet&quot; radio show===
When Red Skelton was drafted in March 1944, Ozzie Nelson was prompted to create his own family situation comedy. &quot;The Adventures of Ozzie and Harriet&quot; launched October 8, 1944, on CBS. It moved to NBC in October 1948, then made a late-season switch back to CBS in April 1949. The final years of the radio series were on ABC (the former NBC Blue Network) from October 14, 1949 to June 18, 1954. In total 402 radio episodes were produced. In an arrangement that exemplified the growing pains of American broadcasting, as radio &quot;grew up&quot; into television, the Nelsons&#x27; deal with ABC gave the network the option to move their program to television. The struggling network needed proven talent that was not about to defect to the more established and wealthier networks like CBS or NBC.

The Nelsons&#x27; sons, David and Ricky, did not join the cast until the radio show&#x27;s fifth year (initially appearing on the February 20, 1949, episode, at ages 12 and 8, respectively). The two boys were played by professional actors prior to their joining because both were too young to perform. The role of David was played by Joel Davis from 1944 until 1945 when he was replaced by Tommy Bernard. Henry Blair appeared as Ricky. Other cast members included John Brown as Syd &quot;Thorny&quot; Thornberry, Lurene Tuttle as Harriet&#x27;s mother, Bea Benaderet as Gloria, Janet Waldo as Emmy Lou, and Francis &quot;Dink&quot; Trout as Roger. Vocalists included Harriet Nelson, The King Sisters, and Ozzie Nelson. The announcers were Jack Bailey and Verne Smith. The music was by Billy May and Ozzie Nelson. The producers were Dave Elton and Ozzie Nelson. The show&#x27;s sponsors included International Silver Company (1944–49), H.J. Heinz Company (1949–52) and Lambert Pharmacal&#x27;s Listerine (1952–54).

===&quot;Here Come the Nelsons&quot; feature film===
In 1952, the Nelsons starred with Rock Hudson in the Universal-International feature film, &quot;Here Come the Nelsons&quot;. The film depicted Ozzie as an advertising executive assigned to a campaign promoting women&#x27;s underwear. The film, produced in the summer of 1951 while the radio show was on hiatus, opened theatrically on February 23, 1952. It also doubled as a pilot for the television series, as Ozzie wanted to see if his family would be as well accepted on film as they were on radio. The success of &quot;Here Come the Nelsons&quot; convinced him that Ozzie &amp; Harriet&#x27;s future was on the small screen, while continuing their weekly radio show.

==Television series==

Before the television series aired, Ozzie Nelson formed his own film production company, Stage Five Productions, and persuaded ABC to agree to a 10-year contract that paid the Nelsons whether the series was canceled or not. The unprecedented contract and Ozzie&#x27;s insistence on perfection in the series&#x27; production paid off in the series&#x27; remarkable longevity.

&quot;The Adventures of Ozzie and Harriet&quot; premiered on ABC on October 10, 1952, staying until April 23, 1966; in 1962, it became the first prime-time scripted series on American television to reach the 10-year milestone. The series strove for realism and featured exterior shots of the Nelsons&#x27; actual southern California home at 1822 Camino Palmero Street in Los Angeles as the fictional Nelsons&#x27; home. Interior shots were filmed on General Service Studios&#x27; Stage 3, recreated to look like the real interior of the Nelsons&#x27; home. Viewers naturally assumed the action took place in Los Angeles since the occasional exterior shots were of actual Los Angeles streets rather than a studio backlot. But for many years the opening credits of each episode noted that the Nelson characters were &quot;played by&quot; the Nelson family, as though taking pains to ensure viewers knew these were not literal true-life accounts. And a 1959 episode titled &quot;Ozzie Changes History&quot; 
 is devoted entirely to the history of &quot;Warfield,&quot; the fictional town where they live. This finally accounted for the small-town atmosphere of the series whereby, like the other main sitcom families of the era (the Andersons and the Cleavers), the Nelson home seemed to be within walking distance of the town center.

Like its radio predecessor (which finally ended in 1954), the series focused mainly on the Nelson family at home, dealing with everyday problems. As the series progressed and the boys grew up, storylines involving various characters were introduced. Many of the series story lines were taken from the Nelsons&#x27; real life. When the real David and Rick married June Blair and Kristin Harmon, respectively, their wives joined the cast of &quot;Ozzie and Harriet&quot; and the marriages were written into the series. What was seldom written into the series was Ozzie&#x27;s profession or mention of his lengthy and successful band-leading career. The popular joke about his career was that the only time he left the house was to go buy ice cream. According to his granddaughter, actress Tracy Nelson, Ozzie went to Rutgers to study law and when pressed would tell interviewers that the TV Ozzie was a lawyer.

By the mid-1960s, America&#x27;s social climate was changing, and the Nelsons, symbolizing the 1950s values and ideals, were beginning to seem dated. Ozzie, who wrote and directed all of the series&#x27; episodes, attempted to alter the series to fit the times, but most viewers associated the series with a bygone era. The series cracked the top thirty programs in the Nielsen ratings for the first and only time in its eleventh season (1963–1964), when it ranked in 29th place. It made the transition from black-and-white to color in the 1965–66 season. That year, Ozzie tried to recapture the series&#x27; early success by introducing nine-year-old Joel Davison and other young children to relate to younger families. Although Davison appeared in three episodes, the series&#x27; Nielsen ratings continued to decline. In January 1966, ABC moved the series to Saturdays, where it completed its 14-season run that spring.

Having run for a total of fourteen seasons, &quot;The Adventures of Ozzie and Harriet&quot;, which averaged 29–30 episodes per season, was at one point the longest-running live-action American television sitcom. On April 1, 2017, &quot;It&#x27;s Always Sunny in Philadelphia&quot; was renewed for a thirteenth and fourteenth season, and then through an eighteenth season on December 10, 2020, which led to its breaking the record for longest-running live-action scripted comedy series, but those seasons amount to only around a third as many episodes as &quot;Ozzie and Harriet&quot;.

===Springboard for Ricky Nelson&#x27;s music career===
&quot;The Adventures of Ozzie and Harriet&quot; made the Nelsons&#x27; younger son, Rick, into a music teen idol. Ozzie realized the impact his musically gifted son could have on the series, and went on to write storylines featuring Rick singing. Rick first sang in the April 10, 1957, episode, &quot;Ricky the Drummer,&quot; performing a version of Fats Domino&#x27;s hit &quot;I&#x27;m Walkin&quot;, and later signed a recording contract with Domino&#x27;s label, Imperial Records. Subsequent episodes that aired after Rick became one of the nation&#x27;s most successful musicians were some of the series&#x27; highest-rated episodes.

==Syndication==
In the decades since the series&#x27; cancellation, it has been continuously shown on stations using extensively edited prints. Between 1985 and 1994, The Disney Channel aired the series as remastered from original 35mm film elements, with new introductions by Harriet Nelson.

The series was also aired on the Nostalgia TV Network in the mid 1990s. It also has aired on Catchy Comedy as part of their &quot;Christmas Binge&quot; on the weekends of December 16-17, 2023 and December 14-15, 2024, primarily airing their Christmas themed episodes, and will have its own binge on March 16, 2025.

PBS member station KVCR-TV in San Bernardino, California (in the Los Angeles market) aired the series as late as May 2010, connected to the station&#x27;s nostalgic television series, &quot;I Remember Television&quot;.

==Home media==
Over the years, as a result of several low budget, extensively edited episodes being unofficially released on home video, including VHS and DVD by various unofficial distributors, it was incorrectly presumed that the series had fallen into the public domain. However, in addition to song performances by Ricky Nelson, the theme music and other cues, new copyrights for the episodes have been registered with the Library of Congress to protect the series as the exclusive property of Ozzie &amp; Harriet Enterprises and the Rick Nelson Company LLC.
Ozzie &amp; Harriet Enterprises, LLC and The Rick Nelson Company LLC (the Nelson family companies) also own the rights to the original film elements. An officially released video version of The Best of the Adventures of Ozzie and Harriet was released May 1, 2007, by Shout! Factory under license from The Rick Nelson Company. Additionally, Ozzie &amp; Harriet Enterprises and the Rick Nelson Company LLC currently hold copyright and ownership for any new material derived from the film elements. In 2021, the home entertainment distribution rights were acquired by MPI Home Video. Rick Nelson&#x27;s son Sam Nelson (President of Ozzie &amp; Harriet Enterprises) headed a project that restored and digitally remastered all 435 episodes from the original 35mm network negatives, including the original cast commercials. A selection of 100 of the restored episodes were first made available via a direct response offer from Time-Life in association with MPI in 2021. 
On June 21, 2022, the complete restored, digitally remastered seasons one and two were released on DVD, marking the first time authorized, complete seasons of the show have been released on home video. As of October 10, 2023, all fourteen seasons of the show have been issued, with the entire series boxed set released December 19, 2023. Many of these episodes are being made available for the first time since they first aired.

Episodes of the television series have been screened at the non-profit Mid-Atlantic Nostalgia Convention held annually in Aberdeen, Maryland. 16 mm prints were used.

Author Jim Cox addressed the radio program&#x27;s cultural significance in an article that appeared in &quot;SPERDVAC&#x27;s Radiogram&quot; in early 2008.

==&quot;Ozzie&#x27;s Girls&quot;==

In September 1972, six years after the show ended, NBC aired a pilot episode for a revival of the &quot;Ozzie and Harriet&quot; storyline. In the episode, Ozzie and Harriet rent the boys&#x27; old room to two college students, portrayed by Susan Sennett and Brenda Sykes, after David and Ricky move out. David Nelson served as producer; Ricky Nelson, at this point in his career distancing himself from his past, had no involvement. Storylines centered around the Nelsons&#x27; attempts to solve the problems of two girls after having raised two boys. NBC passed on the series, but Viacom and Filmways agreed to put the show into production and distribute it in syndication.

&quot;Ozzie&#x27;s Girls&quot; premiered on local stations, including New York&#x27;s WABC-TV, in September 1973. It ended in September 1974 after one season. (Though the show was never a major hit, Ozzie&#x27;s health was beginning to fail at the same time, and he would die in June 1975, less than a year after &quot;Ozzie&#x27;s Girls&quot; ended.)

==The Nelsons&#x27; post-TV lives==

===Ozzie===
Ozzie Nelson continued to work in show business after the failure of the short-lived sitcom &quot;Ozzie&#x27;s Girls&quot;. He took on the role of producer and director for some of TV&#x27;s popular series, most notably &quot;Adam-12&quot;, &quot;The D.A.&quot;, and &quot;Bridget Loves Bernie&quot;. In 1975, Ozzie Nelson died of liver cancer at the age of 69.

===Rick===
In the years after &quot;Ozzie and Harriet&quot; was cancelled, Rick Nelson&#x27;s career and personal life changed drastically. Rick continued to record and perform music. He shied away from his teen idol image and sound, forming the rock and roll/country-fused Stone Canyon Band. Rick and the Stone Canyon Band had success with the 1972 single, &quot;Garden Party&quot;. Rick and the Band wrote the song in response to having been booed off the stage at a rock and roll revival concert at Madison Square Garden after having refused to play his old hits. Throughout the 1970s, Rick was riddled with debt. In 1981, he and wife Kristin Harmon divorced. While touring the United States, en route to a New Year&#x27;s Eve concert in Dallas, Rick Nelson was killed in a plane accident on December 31, 1985, in DeKalb in Bowie County in northeast Texas. In 1987, Rick was inducted posthumously into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.

===Harriet===
Following Ozzie&#x27;s death in 1975, Harriet grew reclusive. In 1989, she made her last onscreen appearance in her granddaughter Tracy Nelson&#x27;s TV series, &quot;Father Dowling Mysteries&quot;. Harriet never fully recovered from Rick&#x27;s death and died of congestive heart failure and emphysema in 1994 at the age of 85.

Ozzie, Harriet, and Rick are interred together at Forest Lawn, Hollywood Hills Cemetery, in Los Angeles, California.

===David===
David Nelson continued to produce feature films and television commercials and owned his commercial production company. David died from colon cancer on January 11, 2011.

== Legacy ==
The series attracted large audiences and became synonymous with the 1950s ideal American family life. Although it was never a top-ten hit, Nelson&#x27;s long-term contract with ABC and the lower expectations that came with being on the lowest-rated of the Big Three television networks at the time ensured that the show accrued enough episodes to remain the longest-running live-action sitcom in United States television history until &quot;It&#x27;s Always Sunny in Philadelphia&quot; was renewed for a 15th season in 2021, while also still maintaining the record for most number of episodes aired to the present day for any live-action American sitcom.

<text>Willem Hendrik van den Bos (25 September 1896 – 30 March 1974) was a Dutch astronomer who worked at the Union Observatory in South Africa and became its director in 1941. He discovered nearly new double stars, made more than astronomical measurements and compiled a catalogue of Southern hemisphere double stars. He computed the orbits of more than 100 double stars using a method he invented and which later became the accepted standard.

== Biography ==
Van den Bos was born in Rotterdam in 1896. He studied astronomy at Leiden University and worked at the Leiden Observatory. In 1925 he completed his PhD in astronomy under the supervision of Willem de Sitter and was invited by R.T.A. Innes to join the Union Observatory in Johannesburg for a three-year appointment as assistant to the director, H.E. Wood. Innes was eager to have an experienced observer of double-stars to share the workload on the newly erected telescope.

Van den Bos extended his appointment at the Union Observatory indefinitely and in 1941 was appointed Director of the observatory. He retired from the observatory in 1956 but continued his observations both in South Africa and the United States until 1966 when he was forced to stop owing to severe illness.

During the 31 years of his career he discovered new double stars and made astronomical measurements. He compiled a catalogue from previous observations of southern hemisphere double stars that was incorporated into the Index Catalog of Visual Double Stars, published in 1963, with the collaboration of H.M. Jeffries and F.M. Greeby of the Lick Observatory, California. The catalogue later became the Washington Double Star Catalog.

Van den Bos developed his own method of measuring the orbits of double stars and used it to measure the orbits of more than 100 binary stars. His method became the accepted standard procedure.

== Recognition, memberships, awards ==
* President of the Double Star Commission of the International Astronomical Union for 14 years.
* Royal Danish Academy Gold Medal
* Gill Medal from the Astronomical Society of Southern Africa
* President of the Astronomical Society of Southern Africa in 1943 and 1955
*The 1969 Double-star Colloquium of the International Astronomical Union in Nice was dedicated to Van den Bos.
*The asteroid 1663 van den Bos is named after him, as is the lunar crater van den Bos.

<doc id="789434" wikidata="Q119843568" url="?curid=789434" title="Bonn Agreement (Afghanistan)">
<text>The Bonn Agreement (officially the Agreement on Provisional Arrangements in Afghanistan Pending the Re-Establishment of Permanent Government Institutions) was the initial series of agreements passed on December 5, 2001 during an international conference on Afghanistan held in Bonn. It was intended to re-create the Islamic State of Afghanistan following the U.S. invasion of Afghanistan that followed the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. Since no nationally agreed-upon government had existed in Afghanistan since 1979, it was felt necessary to have a transition period before a permanent government was established. A nationally agreed-upon government would require at least one &quot;loya jirga&quot; to be convened; however, in the absence of law and order in the wake of the rapid victory of American and Afghan Northern Alliance forces, immediate steps were felt to be required.

==Overview==
In December 2001, 25 prominent Afghans met under UN auspices in Bonn, Germany, to decide on a plan for governing the country (see list of signatories at International Conference on Afghanistan, Bonn (2001)). By inviting warlords capable enough to disrupt the state building process, a &quot;big tent&quot; strategy was enacted in order to incorporate, rather than alienate, these non-state actors in Afghan state centralization. As a result, the Afghan Interim Authority (AIA)—made up of 30 members, headed by a chairman—was inaugurated on 22 December 2001 with a six-month mandate to be followed by a two-year Transitional Authority (TA), after which elections were to be held.

One of the sections of the Bonn Agreement envisaged the establishment of the International Security Assistance Force (ISAF). Resolution 1386 of the United Nations Security Council subsequently established ISAF.

== State building in Afghanistan ==
Following the fall of the Taliban in 2001, the Bonn Agreement laid the foundation for U.S. and NATO-backed state-building efforts in Afghanistan. The agreement sought to establish a new constitution, an independent judiciary, free and fair elections, a centralized security sector, and the protection of rights of women and also minorities, such as religious and ethnic groups. This model for state-building in Afghanistan was based on a ‘maximalist model of post-conflict reconstruction’ that surfaced in the 1990s, following international interventions in the Balkans, sub-Saharan Africa and East Timor.

The Bonn Agreement provided a framework for the later constitution that was established in 2004 and the presidential and parliamentary elections that followed. It emphasized the need for strong, centralized government institutions and failed to account for the state’s cultural and political history, as the country had previously relied on informal, regional power structures to deliver security and services.

The state-building roadmap that was created by the Bonn Agreement was an inappropriate model for the Afghan case, and later led to a range of issues, including government corruption and incompetency. Since the Bonn Agreement failed to provide shared powers within the Afghanistan government, it spurred an internal war between two of the country’s “elite networks”, the North Alliance and the Pashtun Faction. As a result, the North Alliance held most of the cabinet positions in Afghanistan’s government and had large decision-making capabilities. This skew in political power and abundant intra-cabinet rivalries was noted in an early World Bank report that stated, “even within central government, current political divisions and rivalries render impossible any meaningful consensus on even the key policy elements of a comprehensive administrative reform program…” The subsequent failures of the Afghan state, including the inability to provide basic security and social services, stemmed from the ‘overambitious reconstruction model’ that was created by the Bonn Agreement, as well as practical challenges on the ground. Following this event, the Afghan government took on a more informal style in public affairs of pact-making and brokerage. As a result, the Bonn Agreement can be seen as a large setback in the development of Afghanistan as a state and its coexisting political climates.

==Constitution of Afghanistan==
Under the Bonn Agreement the Afghan Constitution Commission was established to draft a new constitution in consultation with the public. The Bonn Agreement called for a loya jirga to be convened within 18 months of the establishment of the Transitional Authority and for the use of the 1964 constitution as the basis for a new constitution. 
The constitution had been adopted by the loya Jirga on January 4, 2004.

==Legal system==
The Bonn Agreement calls for a judicial commission to rebuild the justice system in accordance with Islamic principles, international standards, the rule of law, and Afghan legal traditions.

==Judicial branch==
The Bonn Agreement called for the establishment of a Supreme Court of Afghanistan.

<doc id="789435" wikidata="Q4873169" url="?curid=789435" title="Battlelords of the 23rd Century">
<text>Battlelords of the Twenty-Third Century is a paper and pencil science fiction role-playing game designed by Lawrence R. Sims and first published in 1990. The game&#x27;s newest tagline is &quot;Roleplaying in a Galaxy at War&quot;. The &quot;Battlelords of the Twenty-Third Century&quot; license was later sold by Optimus Design Systems (ODS) to SSDC, Inc. in September 1999. In 2017, SSDC granted exclusive rights to produce games set in the Battlelords Universe to 23rd Century Productions, LLC. Subsequently, 23rd Century Productions, LLC. launched a successful Kickstarter campaign to fund the Kickstarter Edition, also known as the Revised Edition, of Battlelords of the 23rd Century.

==Setting==
&quot;Battlelords of the Twenty-Third Century&quot; is set in the year 2279. The territory of the Galactic Alliance,
spanning several galaxies, is the primary setting for the game. The Galactic Alliance is made up
of twelve races (including Humans), and is run behind the scenes by huge mega-corporations seeking
to exploit the farthest reaches of space.

Player characters usually assume the role of Battlelords, mercenaries employed by the corporations to
further their business by any means, legal or otherwise. They face various challenges, including rival
mercenaries, Rebels, hostile alien lifeforms on unexplored worlds, and the alien race known as the Arachnids.

===Races===

There are many alien races in the Battlelords universe, but twelve are presented in the basic rulebook and form the basis for the Galactic Alliance.

====Alliance Races====
* Chatilian: Psychic green-skinned humanoids with lumpy projections on their skulls. The projections can generate and store psychic energy that can be channeled and directed by the use of special attuned crystals carried or worn by the user.
** (Empath): Emotion-reading psychics.
* Cizerack: Territorial matriarchal quadrupedal Felinoid warriors. Females control all aspects of their society and males are used for breeding purposes. They make excellent scouts and spies.
* Eridani: Philosophical methane-breathing humanoids from a rigid caste-bound militocratic society. They follow &quot;Kaush-mukal&quot; (&quot;Study of the Inner Self&quot;), a philosophy that states that the individual can find enlightenment through performing their function correctly within their cultural niche. The &quot;Vax&quot; (&quot;warriors&quot;) are the upper class; they run the military and control the government. The &quot;Tolude&quot; (&quot;gentry&quot;) are the lesser families of the &quot;Vax&quot; and form the middle class. They serve as non-commissioned officers and soldiers, technicians and artisans, doctors and nurses, bureaucrats and civil servants, industrialists, bankers, and merchants. The &quot;Mudig&quot; (&quot;unclean&quot;) are the lower-class, who perform the manual trades. They serve as laborers and servants but also provide technical and support services to the military as mechanics, cooks, surgeons and medical orderlies, combat engineers, and other manual tasks. The &quot;Tolude&quot; are the most common Eridani to meet offworld as their function often requires it. &quot;Vax&quot; only leave their world to go on campaign with the military, work as a mercenary, or perform a warrior pilgrimage. &quot;Mudig&quot; cannot leave their homeworld unless they are on campaign with the military; those who show great bravery and self-sacrifice are adopted by a childless &quot;Tolude&quot; family or allowed to marry into the &quot;Tolude&quot; caste.
** (&quot;Swordsaint&quot;): Elite ascetic warrior-adepts (&quot;Mokaba Datu&quot;; &quot;Wisdom Warriors&quot;) who train in the use of sacred bladed weapons and firearms in order to achieve enlightenment through &quot;Goyoo Mabiki&quot; (&quot;Silent Peace&quot;; meditation).
** (Buddon Priest): Retired warriors who, after finding &quot;Rota Mabiki&quot; (&quot;Supreme Peace&quot;; enlightenment), have ascended to becoming teachers and philosophers. Senior priests serve as religious commissars, staff officers, and generals in the Eridani armed forces.
* Gen-Human: Genetically modified cloned Humans. After the Second Holocaust, the Human race had a low birth rate. Genetic research was used to ensure fertilization and edit out non-beneficial traits like mutations, diseases, and disorders in-vitro. This led to the ability to pre-select which positive traits a child would inherit (or insert new traits). Then biomedical corporations began breeding vat-grown genetically enhanced human clones to serve as loyal bodyguards, servants, and playthings for wealthy Humans. This was later expanded to supply semi-skilled or skilled workers for corporations and soldiers for the military, which began preferring them to Humans. Human frustration and fear gave way to bigotry. This led to the Gen Wars in 2075 AD, in which Human Supremacy groups and angry or panicked mobs attacked and killed real or suspected Gen-Humans. The Gen-Humans and their supporters fought back and a bloody stalemate occurred. This lasted until 2083 AD, when the United Earth government created the Genetics Laws. It set the Gen-Human population at no more than 15% of the total Human population and created Human quotas and Gen-Human limits for all jobs and professions. It also forced Gen-Humans to be registered; the manufacturer&#x27;s symbol, model name and serial number barcode is imprinted on their body and encoded in their DNA &quot;junk genes&quot; to aid in identification. In return, Gen-Humans were considered a sentient race rather than property and they were extended similar rights to other sapient beings. Although superior to baseline humans, Gen-Humans are treated as second-class citizens by Humans, who view them as unsettling &quot;things&quot; rather than real &quot;people&quot;. However, their superior abilities mean that they often hold high offices in the Alliance or major corporations. Because all Gen-Humans of the same model are identical, they tend to develop identity problems. To combat this, they develop quirks or unique identifiers to separate themselves from the others. Gen-Humans of the same model have difficulty forming large social groups because of this. Gen-Humans tend to breed true. If two Gen-Humans breed, their offspring will be one parent&#x27;s genotype. Even if they marry Humans, their offspring will be the same model as themselves. This lack of genetic diversity is seen as an evolutionary weakness.
* Human: Baseline Humans. A worldwide nuclear war at the dawn of Earth&#x27;s 21st Century (dubbed the &quot;Second Holocaust&quot;) killed 3 billion Humans worldwide and damaged Earth&#x27;s climate with a &quot;nuclear winter&quot;. A Mutzachan scout ship drawn to the high radiation readings made first contact with some survivors. A rescue mission used high technology to stabilize the environment in exchange for the rights to extract the radioactive waste left behind at the impact craters. Eventually terraforming technology restored the planet, but most Humans who were able to had already left for the stars. Humans, like most &quot;emigre&quot; communities, feel a nostalgic connection for the place they are from, but few actually want to go back. Pacifism is a popular and widespread belief-system due to the Second Holocaust; however, few Humans are total pacifists and most see it as a philosophy rather than a way of life. They also have a sort of &quot;Manifest Destiny&quot; belief that they are destined to control the Alliance someday because of their unique qualities; the other Alliance races think this belief is adorable.
* I-Bot (Intelligent Robot): Artificially intelligent Androids that can be made to mimic any known lifeform. Although fears of &quot;rogue&quot; I-Bots are common fodder for tri-v dramas, they are programmed to be loyal to the corporation that owns them and to the Alliance. (The former loyalty disturbingly outranks that of the latter). I-Bots have poor intuition, relying on rigid pre-programmed tactics or protocols to deal with problems. Unforeseen problems or multiple potential actions force the I-Bot to pause to analyze the situation and decide on the best option. I-Bots who are damaged have to be repaired and cannot heal on their own. Artificial intelligences are not considered true lifeforms by the Alliance and are therefore considered the property of the corporation or organization that purchased them. They usually perform jobs that are too hazardous or dangerous for sentient beings and require specialized knowledge or training, super-strength, and precise reflexes (like starcraft crew, powerplant maintenance, scientific research, star-mapping and planetary exploration, etc.). On the other hand, some hazardous tasks like war and colonization are best done using cheap fleshy beings rather than expensive machines.
* Mazian: Amorphous shape-shifter.
* Mutzachan: Small inquisitive frail psychic energy-wielding super-geniuses who tend to become addicted to the energy they manipulate. They would be labeled as megalomaniacs if they weren&#x27;t actually as powerful as they say they are. They are from the planet Trishmag of the 61 Cygni A star system in the Cygnus constellation of the Milky Way galaxy.
**(Energy Controllers): The Energy Controllers have the innate ability to manipulate energy forms and can use these forms to generate tremendous amounts of power. They love energy in its raw, uncorrupted form and view the storage of energy as useless.
* Orion: Humanoids that have pointed ears and seven fingers on each hand. They are thrill-seeking hedonists with very flexible moral and social codes.
** (Rogue) Scheming and cunning tricksters and petty criminals who belong to decentralized nomadic clans. Most Orions encountered off-world will be Rogues.
* Phentari: Haughty and treacherous methane-breathing four-armed Cephalapoid warriors. Their brains are controlled by different lobes, each with its own personality, abilities and interpretation of reality. One main lobe will control the brain for regular day-to-day activities while other more specialized lobes will take over for tasks like combat and self-defense, learning and training, reasoning and problem solving, etc. They are carnivores that prefer to eat sentient animals and sapient beings; Humans are considered a delicacy. Phentari are indigenous to the arctic methane planet Phena in the Tau Ceti star system.
* Python Lizard: Large, strong, and agile Amphibian warriors. Rather clueless. They are indigenous to the planets Pythos and Ashira of the Floridian star system.
* Ram Python: Huge, brutishly strong Reptilian shock-troopers. Extremely dumb.
* Zen Rigeln: Beloved pacifistic biokinetic healers who belong to an extremely traditional and ritualistic society.

====Additional Player Races====

=====Hostile=====
The following races are hostile to the Alliance.
* Aeodronian: Cunning bipedal Urodelate amphibians. They can regenerate lost digits and limbs. They prefer damp or humid environments, as dry environments causes their skin to become flaky and cracked. &lt;br&gt;Their original homeworld suffered a catastrophe that made it unable to support life, so they colonized new planets. They are fanatically environmentalist, so they trade or raid for all the resources they need. They are rather hypocritical, as they despise other races for abusing their own planets, yet see nothing wrong with polluting, exploiting, or damaging the ecosystems of alien-controlled worlds. &lt;br&gt;The planet is ruled by a militocracy made up of 26 Clans. Each Clan is ruled by a leader selected from the premier raiders, warlords, and merchants of each Clan. Over them is an annually elected ruler (&quot;Athyan&quot;, or &quot;All-lord&quot;) assisted by a council of advisers (&quot;Inbaltho&quot;, or &quot;Many Eyes&quot;) made up of former rulers. Each Clan has its own military and they compete to see which Clan will bring home the most plunder.
* Fott: Synthetic xenophobic and sociopathic Leporoid rednecks. They were created by scientific polymath genius, self-made gagillionaire, and super-terrorist &quot;Uncle Ernie&quot; Freiberg to stymie Alliance law. They fit the definition of a sapient race rather than a bio-weapon, making it illegal to contain them, sterilize them, or wipe them out. Fott are curious, reckless, aggressive, reproduce rapidly, and have a strange sense of entitled superiority over other races - sort of a mean parody of Humans. Other races view them as the perfect minority group - obnoxious, dim-witted, lazy, violent, oversexed, wasteful, crude, reactionary and anti-social. &lt;br&gt;Uncle Ernie seeded the race on Delphix-9 of the Netas Hydri star system in the And-3 galaxy, just as it was declared Alliance space but before it could be settled. When the Alliance first tried to colonize the planet, the Fott initiated a guerrilla war with them. Settlements were under constant siege and a war of attrition began. An Alliance fleet was dispatched to eradicate the Fott from orbit, but Human and Zen ambassadors were able to negotiate a conference that led to the Fott surrendering after signing a treaty. The Alliance set up an agency called the Fott Welfare Administration (FWA) whose purpose is to educate, house, care for and feed its clients until they are judged able to be fully assimilated into Alliance society. &lt;br&gt;The Fott resent the Alliance and resist any attempt to govern or control them. They are organized in extended family-based social groups called Kin. Kins will feud with each other but will unite against non-Fott enemies. Fott live in rural agrarian communes in which they own the land and automated machines, subjugated laborers, and domesticated animals farm it for them. The Fott have resisted any attempts to get them to liberate their workforce and have threatened a civil war if the matter is pushed too far.&lt;br&gt;Fott are omnivores who love to hunt; if an animal is inedible, they will hunt it for sport. Fott display their hunting prowess by either stuffing and mounting the bodies of their prey or making craft items and furniture out of them. These trophies are displayed in their living quarters in a special area called a &quot;den&quot;. They collect firearms, preferring gunpowder-based projectile weapons because they require great skill to use and it is easier to recover usable prey after a kill. Some Fott hunters use archaic projectile weapons like crossbows, slingshots, or muskets to make it more challenging.&lt;br&gt;Fott often find work as mercenaries because it allows them to legally work out their aggressions on outsiders and blow things up while they get paid to do it. Fott mercenaries will often collect and trade trophies like enemy weapons, spent ammo casings or power cores, dud or defused munitions, etc.; they often learn everything they can about the objects they collect. Since Fott are furry, there is an aversion to using flame-throwers or energy weapons.
* Kizanti: A humanoid race that developed on Ferron, a world in the Karanies star system in the Fornax galaxy. Kizanti have mesomorphic builds, red eyes with black oval-shaped pupils, and no earlobes. Kizanti hate the Phentari and fought a war with them once that almost wiped the Phentari out. They dislike the Alliance for intervening and protecting the Phentari.&lt;br&gt;Ferron is a &quot;Shade World&quot;, a cross-dimensional planet in and out of phase with our dimension. As a side-effect of their evolution, the Kizanti have learned to dimensionally &quot;displace&quot; themselves, making themselves invisible and intangible at will. They carry a ritual marker they are attuned to that they leave behind while phasing to help center themselves for the return jump. This can be anything from a &quot;pet rock&quot; to a 1963 Pontiac Tempest.&lt;br&gt; The Kizanti were originally a primitive race of hunter/gatherers. They were protected by the Shade effect, which hid their world from outsiders. A Phentari expedition to the Karanies system discovered the world when it was in-phase and conquered and enslaved the population. Before they left, they massacred them so they couldn&#x27;t tell Alliance authorities about their actions - a time called the Great Carnage by the survivors. Afterwards, a survival of the fittest mentality took over the race, which weeds out weak offspring so that only &quot;true&quot; Kizanti can live to pass on their genes. They spend their lives training as warriors and assassins, with little time for leisure activities. They have unknown patrons that provide training and support - probably in exchange for their services.&lt;br&gt; The Kizanti favor aggressive or provocative clothing that is designed to attract attention. They are adept at many types of weapons, but prefer using ritual high-quality bladed weapons that are covered in richly inlaid engravings (especially when killing Phentari). Warriors wear their hair in a short, stiff mohawk to indicate their status. Kizanti assassins have prosthetic earlobes, implanted contact lenses, and wear their hair long so they can pass for Human. Although the Kizanti have no unified racial language (speaking one of many regional languages with local dialects instead) and have no indigenous written language, they speak and read a form of Eridani as a common tongue (taught to them by their hidden patrons, no doubt).
* Tza Zen Rigeln: A Zen Rigeln cult of feared rogue biokinetic sadists who often use their culture&#x27;s good reputation to lure victims and fool the authorities.
* Zzzwhirr: An insectoid race allied with the Rebellion.

=====Neutral=====
The following races are seen as neutral to the Alliance.
* Andromeni: Beings of a dying race whose homeworld is contaminated by an energy-based plague. They are under quarantine to prevent the spread of the plague.
** (Energy Vampires) Some infected by the plague have the power to take on an energy form. In this form they can possess the physical bodies of material beings and feed off of them. Benign Vampires use the bodies of the newly dead or mindless lifeforms, while selfish Vampires use the bodies of living sentients.
* Frekk (introduced as a playtest race)
* Goola Goola: Hairy purple-skinned technophilic dwarves. Usually ill-tempered and rude unless they are engaged in analyzing or repairing technology. They tend to appear selfish and callous about the suffering of others. Their survival instincts promote their wellbeing above that of others and keeps them from &quot;distractions&quot; like pity and empathy that would interfere with that drive. They are scavenger omnivores from a planet that has a hostile environment full of predators. This slowed their technological development, but bred a fascination with toolmaking and technology as survival aids. Not long after they achieved spacetravel, an unknown advanced alien race attacked their homeworld and almost wiped out their entire race; this inflamed their instinctual distrust of strangers into full-blown xenophobia. Goola-Goola encountered offworld are usually trying to acquire high technology and bring it back for the defense of their people.
* Jezzadei: A race of peaceful scholarly Bovinoids. They can store psychic power effects in &quot;enchanted&quot; talisman-objects called a &quot;Bi-Athlon&quot; by using attuned ritual wands or staves called &quot;Atohk&quot; (&quot;life staff&quot;). Some large &quot;Atohks&quot; have compartments to contain &quot;Bi-Athlons&quot; to allow them to store and use psychic powers.
**(Jezzadeic Scholar) Researchers, artificers, and scientists that focus on their area of interest. They delight in finding similarities and differences between cultures they encounter, discovering something new, or rediscovering something old. Few are met off-world because the average Scholar is rather too reclusive or obsessive to travel widely.
** (Jezzadeic Priest) Missionaries that travel the universe using their psychic healing powers to help others. They want to spread their culture&#x27;s pacifist pantheistic religion. Most Jezzadei encountered off-planet will be missionaries, as they are the most common group allowed to travel.
* Misha: Frail, transparent humanoids with delicate crystalline bones. They sleep for long periods of time and are otherwise in a semi-conscious &quot;sleepwalking&quot; state. No Misha have ever been encountered in a fully conscious state.
**(Dream Merchant) They can enter a psychic &quot;Dream State&quot;, where they can perceive potential futures or manipulate a particular future into being.

=====Friendly=====
The following races are seen as friendly or are seeking Protectorate status.
* Ashanti: Slender, grey-skinned four-armed warriors; they have elongated skulls and flat faces. They show emotion through pheromones rather than facial expressions. Ashanti also have a gestalt &quot;sixth-sense&quot; that allows a group of Ashanti to perceive objects in their environment through their linked perceptions; a squad of Ashanti arranged in a circle can use it to see everything in a 360° panorama.
* Furbl: Furry absent-minded brachiating mammals known for their agility. Once thought of as clever pets by the Orions, they were freed and given race status when they were discovered to be sapient by the Alliance. They are usually found serving in a technical or skilled manual trade like mechanic or cook, as the Orions traditionally used to use them for household servants. Furbls like to steal objects or pick the pockets of a friend or co-worker as part of a ritual game they picked up from watching and studying the Orions. This is not done for gain but for fun or sport. If the item is returned after their mark discovers that it is missing, the Furbl scores a point. If the mark prevents the theft or catches the Furbl in the act, the mark scores a point.
* Gemini: Large, burly silicon-based rocky-skinned psychic humanoids that follow a philosophy that reveres all life. Normally pacifistic, they can be overcome with anger or even berserk rage by acts that harm the environment or threaten living things in their ecosystem.
* Ikrini: Humanoids with psychic powers tied to natural forces. They originated on Liara in the Crab Nebula but their homeworld was damaged by Arachnid infestations, forcing many to be refugees.
** (Geomancer): Psychics who can tap into the kinetic power of natural forces like volcanos, waterfalls, and storms.
* Tann: Tripedal humanoids from a feudalistic matriarchal theocratic monarchy led by their Queen. Cybernetics are considered holy and are granted after the child undergoes divination to determine their caste. The Tann live underground in huge labyrinth-cities.
** &quot;Tanndai&quot; (Techknight) The warrior caste of the Tann, the caste most often encountered offworld. They are programmed to be fiercely loyal to the Tann race and their Queen. Tanndai serve in color-coded military corps. They may not attack or harm members of the same corps but may fight those of rival corps. They may only kill Tanndai from rival corps in combat during wartime.&lt;br&gt; They are usually loaned out as mercenaries or serve in other races&#x27; armies to gain experience, test current or theoretical Tann military doctrines, or learn the doctrines of other races. The Tann sometimes send military advisers or aid to a losing faction in a war or fight on both sides just to test their theories.

====Non-Player Races====
* Arachnids: A race of hostile spider-like aliens. They have four walking limbs, two manipulator limbs (near the mouth), and two spinning limbs that shoot strands or globs of spidersilk. They are rumored to use captive lifeforms for food or to incubate their eggs.
* Krakeds: Large arthropods that were initially confused with the Arachnids upon First Contact. They are in a tentative truce with the Alliance. (introduced as a playtest NPC race).
* Sye-Men: Cryptic humanoids with powerful healing powers; they can even bring back the dead if they deem it worthwhile or important. They have hideous, rotting bodies bound in wrappings and covered in a hooded long robe called a &quot;newile&quot; to hide their appearance from other races. They are very cagey about their origin, claiming to be either from the future or another reality. Staying in this time and space and using their powers puts constant strain on their bodies and causes the decomposition they suffer from. The Zen-Rigeln resent the Sye-Men, calling them a mockery of everything their culture stands for and deem them a potential threat to the Alliance; the Sye-Men in return neither confirm or deny these assertions.
* Xarians: Hexapedal, flat-bodied amphibians with bumpy, moist skin; they have been described as looking like &quot;bumpy, slimy endtables&quot;. The first two pairs of legs are also used as hand-like manipulators; all six legs are fully rotational. They speak and eat with a long thin mouth mounted between the first set of legs and have a long tri-forked tongue that can be used as a manipulator for delicate work or to grasp or strike far-off objects. They have four small eyes along the front of their bodies above their mouth. They wear clothing made of &quot;t-cloth&quot; that keeps their skin from drying out. They store oxygen in the bumps on their skin and can use them to float in water. The Xarians are merchants; their society is divided into oligarchical clans called Confederations, each of which is ruled by the richest and oldest member of that Confederation. The head of the most powerful Confederation serves as the &quot;CEO&quot; and heads the alliance of confederations called the Hegemony. Their ambition is to destroy or subjugate the Alliance, which they see as a competitor and business rival.

===Locations===
The Galactic Alliance spans portions of several galaxies, including the Milky Way, Andromeda, Fornax, Spirax, M32, and the Magellanic Clouds. Details of two &#x27;sectors&#x27; of the Fornax Galaxy are presented in the planetary atlas supplements, &quot;No Man&#x27;s Land&quot; and &quot;Hell&#x27;s Kitchen&quot;.

==System==
&quot;Battlelords of the Twenty-Third Century&quot; features a d100 (percentile) based system for resolving combat and skill checks.

===Character Statistics and Skills===
Each character has eight Vital Statistics scores (Strength, Manual Dexterity, Intelligence Quotient, Agility, Constitution, Aggression, Intuition, and Charisma). These are used to calculate the four Secondary Statistics scores (Knowledge, Military Leadership, Persuasion, and Bargaining). These scores are significantly influenced by the character&#x27;s race. There are no character classes or character levels in &quot;Battlelords of the Twenty-Third Century&quot;; the system is skill-based, with skills being increased with experience earned. Some races have &quot;matrix abilities&quot; (psionics) which can also be advanced with character experience, while other races are more suited for physical combat or other occupations.

===Growing Up===
&quot;Battlelords of the Twenty-Third Century&quot; features a detailed character generation process called &quot;I Was Just Growing Up&quot; (IWJGU). It not only encompasses the eight Vital Statistics and four Secondary Statistics, which are generated using d100 (percentile) dice, but allows for determining events from the characters past. These are a mix of good and bad; granting a character several thousand credits worth of equipment or horribly maiming them. They are featured in several tables including a racial specific table and a job specific table which is chosen by the player.

===Combat===
Combat is resolved through the use of d100 attack rolls and detailed hit location tables; futuristic armor systems and massive critical hits feature prominently. Actions are resolved in half actions (1 second each) and full actions (3 seconds each). Each character can perform two half actions or one full action in a 3-second round. These include but are not limited to; aiming, firing a single round, swinging a sword, dying quickly, diving for cover, running, and dying with a lengthy speech.

===Other system features===
As of 2007, the system does not feature rules for space combat. These rules are planned for forthcoming supplements.
Vehicle rules were added to the system with the publication of &quot;Engines of War&quot; in 2007.

*&quot;Do Not Be Alarmed: This is Only a Test&quot; (1992) - The characters are recruited by a private mercenary corporation. They are sent to attend bootcamp and specialized training at a secure area that uses simulation equipment instead of live weapons and munitions, and robots instead of hostiles, insurgents, and natives. While there, recruits and staff begin to die in bizarre training accidents. Then the planet is invaded by an actual hostile force with real weapons.
*&quot;Injection&quot; (3rd edition - 1993/ 4th edition - 1994) - The characters are given a mission to extract a deep cover operative. They have very damaging information about the target, a very powerful rival corporation. It goes wrong, gets very complicated, and soon leads to the characters barely escaping. The characters must now chase an elusive enemy across the galaxy while fighting for their lives.

==Reception==
Allen Mixson reviewed &quot;Battlelords of the 23rd Century&quot; in &quot;White Wolf&quot; #35 (March/April, 1993), rating it a 3 out of 5 and stated that &quot;Despite [its flaws], if you are looking for a fairly quick and easy system, check out &quot;Battlelords of the 23rd Century&quot;. It provides a basis for a beginning game cosmos.&quot;

<doc id="789442" wikidata="Q1683976" url="?curid=789442" title="Jason Robert Brown">
<text>Jason Robert Brown (born June 20, 1970) is an American musical theatre composer, lyricist, and playwright. Brown&#x27;s music sensibility fuses pop-rock stylings with theatrical lyrics. He is the recipient of three Tony Awards for his work on &quot;Parade&quot; and &quot;The Bridges of Madison County&quot;.

==Career==
Brown grew up in the suburbs of New York City, and attended the Eastman School of Music in Rochester, New York for 2 years, rooming with fellow student, and vocalist, Christopher Mooney. During summer, he attended French Woods Festival of the Performing Arts in Hancock, New York. He said &quot;Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street&quot; and &quot;Sunday in the Park with George&quot; were two of his biggest influences, and had it not been for them, he would have joined a rock band and tried to be Billy Joel.

He began his career in New York City as an arranger, conductor, and pianist, working on shows such as William Finn&#x27;s &quot;A New Brain&quot;, and playing at several nightclubs and piano bars in the city. &quot;Songs for a New World&quot; marked the first major New York production of Brown&#x27;s songs. An off-Broadway revue with a limited run, the show was directed by Daisy Prince, daughter of director/producer Hal Prince, and featured the 25-year-old Brown&#x27;s pop-rock-influenced music. The song &quot;Stars and the Moon&quot; has since become a cabaret standard, and is probably Brown&#x27;s best-known composition to date.

Brown was subsequently hired to write songs for the Broadway musical &quot;Parade&quot;, based on the trial and lynching of Leo Frank, after meeting Hal Prince. &quot;Parade&quot;, directed by Prince and with a book by Alfred Uhry, won Brown the 1999 Tony Award for Best Original Score. During this production, Livent, one of the producers of &quot;Parade&quot;, pulled out after reviews were not as positive as they&#x27;d hoped. RCA Victor, the other major producer, decided it would pull out as well. Brown said of the event in 1999, &quot;Livent dropped out shortly after the reviews came out. They announced they would not spend another dime on the show. RCA had an agreement to record all of Livent&#x27;s shows. But when Livent pulled out of &#x27;Parade,&#x27; the RCA higher-ups said they were pulling out, too. I had to go to Billy Rosenfield and ask him: &#x27;What if we pay for this record and you just distribute it?&#x27; Billy said, &#x27;Sure.&#x27;&quot; Brown had to try to scrounge money from every corner, &quot;In the end, RCA put in $25,000, Lincoln Center put in a big chunk, around $200,000, including the producer Scott Rudin&#x27;s $25,000, and there was a contribution from the Gilman and Gonzalez-Falla foundation, which has helped support a lot of musical theatre composers over the years, of $40,000. Even Roy Furman, the new guy at Livent, gave us a little money. Somehow, we pulled it together.&quot; Livent also was struggling at the time because the company had mishandled funds while applying for bankruptcy protection.

Brown went back to working with Daisy Prince for his third major show &quot;The Last Five Years&quot;, for which he wrote the book as well as songs. Inspired by his own failed first marriage, the show is a two-person musical that tells the history of a relationship from two different perspectives. The male&#x27;s narrative begins at the beginning of the story and progresses through marriage, infidelity, and divorce, while the female narrative begins at the end of the relationship and ends with the couple&#x27;s first date; the two actors&#x27; only direct interaction takes place midpoint, during the wedding sequence. The original Chicago cast consisted of Norbert Leo Butz and Lauren Kennedy, with Sherie Rene Scott over the New York run. &quot;The Last Five Years&quot; received mixed critical reviews and was not a commercial success, lasting only two months off-Broadway, although Brown garnered 2 Drama Desk Awards for music and lyrics. Additionally, due to the cast recording featuring Scott and Butz, the show has gained popularity among contemporary musical theatre aficionados and is an oft-performed piece in regional and community theatres. A film version of the show, featuring Anna Kendrick and Jeremy Jordan, was released in February 2015.

Brown contributed several songs to the Broadway flop &quot;Urban Cowboy&quot;. He had worked as an orchestrator with director Phillip Oesterman on the Off-Broadway musical &quot;New York Rock&quot;, and Oesterman called on him to help him out with &quot;Urban Cowboy&quot;. &quot;Urban Cowboy&quot; had been denied the use of the Clint Black catalog, and Brown came in and wrote a few songs (with help from director Lonny Price, who replaced Oesterman after he died). The show was nominated, with 30 other composers, for the 2003 Tony Award for Best Musical Score, losing out to &quot;Hairspray.&quot;

In June 2005, Brown released a solo album, entitled &quot;Wearing Someone Else&#x27;s Clothes&quot;.

In December 2005, his &quot;Chanukah Suite&quot; received its world premiere with two performances by the Los Angeles Master Chorale at the Walt Disney Concert Hall.

He also teaches courses in musical theatre performance and composition at the University of Southern California. Brown is an active performer of his own work, singing and playing the piano with or without his band, the Caucasian Rhythm Kings (Gary Sieger, guitar, and Randy Landau, bass).

Brown&#x27;s tween-oriented musical &quot;13&quot; premiered at the Mark Taper Forum in Los Angeles, CA on January 7, 2007. It opened on Broadway October 5, 2008, at the Bernard B. Jacobs Theatre, and closed on January 4, 2009. The film adaptation, retitled &quot;13: The Musical&quot;, was released in August 2022.

His &quot;Bridges of Madison County&quot;, a musical adaption of Robert James Waller&#x27;s 1992 novel with a book by Marsha Norman premiered at the Williamstown Theatre Festival on August 1, 2013. Directed by Bartlett Sher, the cast featured Elena Shaddow as Francesca and Steven Pasquale. The musical opened on Broadway on February 27, 2014, at the Gerald Schoenfeld Theatre, starring Kelli O&#x27;Hara as Francesca.

Brown wrote the music for the 2022 musical, &quot;Mr. Saturday Night&quot; with lyrics by Amanda Green and a book by Billy Crystal,
Lowell Ganz &amp; Babaloo Mandel. Brown was nominated for best score at the 2022 Tony Awards.

According to Brown, Bree Lowdermilk used to be an assistant to him. In 2010, Brown publicized his personal efforts to discourage the unauthorized online sharing of his copyrighted sheet music via an e-mail conversation with a teenager named Eleanor.
As of 2020, Brown was working on a musical adaptation of Farewell My Concubine. He is also working on a musical adaptation of &quot;Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil&quot;. 

==Musical style==
Brown has many trademarks in his composing style, which is often rhythmically dynamic and harmonically unconventional, calling for a wide vocal range. His lyric writing often includes internal rhymes, and his music is composed of melodic phrases which do not adhere to a predictable 4-measure length. He favors songs written in AABA&#x27; form, with some exceptions to this form in his show &quot;Parade&quot;. Perhaps most characteristic are his love duets; all five (&quot;I&#x27;d Give it All for You&quot; from &quot;Songs for a New World&quot;, &quot;All the Wasted Time&quot; from &quot;Parade&quot;, &quot;The Next Ten Minutes&quot; from &quot;The Last Five Years&quot;, &quot;Tell Her&quot; from &quot;13&quot;, and &quot;One Second And A Million Miles&quot; from &quot;The Bridges of Madison County&quot;) are written in a very distinct format: male-female-both, compound time in the duet section (two using hemiola), and four of the five end with the couple singing the same pitch.

In 2005, Brown was cited by Mark Shenton as one of the leading new theatrical composers (a list that includes Michael John LaChiusa, Adam Guettel, Andrew Lippa, and Jeanine Tesori, among others).

==Personal life==

<text>Whalley is a large village and civil parish in the Ribble Valley on the banks of the River Calder in Lancashire, England. It is overlooked by Whalley Nab, a large wooded hill over the river from the village. The population of the civil parish was 2,645 at the census of 2001, and increased to 3,629 at the census of 2011.

The main road through Whalley is King Street, which leads through to Clitheroe Road. Neighbouring Whalley are the small villages of Wiswell, Billington, Barrow, and Read. Close by is Downham village and Pendle Hill which was made famous in William Harrison Ainsworth&#x27;s book &quot;The Lancashire Witches&quot;.

==History==
Portfield Hillfort also known as Planes Wood Camp, thought to date from late Bronze Age or Iron Age, is located on a slight promontory overlooking the valley of the River Calder southeast of the town. It is one of over 140 Scheduled monuments in Lancashire.

===Flooding===

Whalley was severely affected by flooding in December 2015. Hundreds of homes were damaged and many residents required rescue as flood water from the nearby River Calder engulfed their homes. The restoration of many homes damaged by the flood remains in progress.

In February 2020, Whalley was hit by flooding caused by Storm Ciara.

==Landmarks==

===Whalley Viaduct===

Known locally as &quot;Whalley Arches&quot;, Whalley Viaduct is a 48-span railway bridge crossing the River Calder. It is a Grade II listed building. It was built between 1846 and 1850 under the engineering supervision of Terrence Wolfe Flanagan and formed part of the Bolton, Blackburn, Clitheroe and West Yorkshire Railway. It is a red brick arch structure and the longest and largest railway viaduct in Lancashire. It carries the railway, now known as the Ribble Valley Line, 21.3m over the river for 620m. Over seven million bricks and 12,338 cubic metres of stone were used in construction. 3,000m of timber were used for the arch centring, temporary platforms and the permanent foundation piles. During construction on 6 October 1849, two of the 41 arches then completed collapsed, with the loss of three lives. The east side of the bridge, nearest the remains of the Abbey, has the only decorative treatment.

===Whalley Abbey===
The village has the ruins of Whalley Abbey, a 14th-century Cistercian abbey. The monks of Whalley described the site of their abbey beneath Whalley Nab, on the banks of the Calder, as &quot;locus benedictus&quot; - a blessed place.

===Other places of interest===

The parish church of St Mary and All Saints dates to 628 in the period when St. Paulinus was said to have preached at Whalley. The church has a large number of notable misericords, eighteen 15th century and four Victorian, the former known to have originated at Whalley Abbey. It is a Grade I listed building. The church-yard has three Anglo-Saxon crosses, which are listed scheduled monuments. It also contains war graves of 8 servicemen of World War I and 5 of World War II. A Roman Catholic church, The English Martyrs, lies near the Abbey. The village has a total of 23 listed buildings at Grade I, II* and II.

===Calder&#x27;s waterfall and isles===
The River Calder has a man made weir section at Whalley, which supposedly allowed the monks of Whalley Abbey to collect water easily. It has been suggested that was one of the main reasons for the abbey being built where it was. The river here has two small islands made of pebbles and rocks.

The dam/weir was built to guide water to a channel, that fed a water wheel in the Corn Mill, (there is a sluice gate where the dam meets the channel, this turns the wheel on and off) this gave power to grind the various products (Wheat, Barley etc.). The power to the Mill was all belt driven through a pulley system. The mill has now been transformed into flats, but you can still see the remains of the wheel through an opening at the back of the building.

In 2015 a 100 kW hydro installation and fish pass was completed at Whalley Weir on the River Calder in Whalley. The micro hydroelectric generating plant uses a variable speed Archimedean screw.

==Shops and amenities==
Whalley has many independent shops, hairdressers, numerous take aways and estate agents, a SPAR and a new Coop in the former Whalley Arms pub, a pharmacy and wine shop. The centre of the town is dominated by three pubs, The Dog, The Swan Hotel (established in 1780) and The DeLacy Arms. There is also a small night club named Rendezvous (Rio&#x27;s) and a public library, doctors&#x27; surgery and an adult learning centre.

Whalley is home to the Calderstones Partnership NHS Mental Health Trust. The hospital was founded in 1915 as &quot;Queen Mary&#x27;s Military Hospital&quot;. It then became &quot;Whalley Asylum&quot; and eventually, from 1929 to 1993, &quot;Calderstones Hospital&quot; and is now known as &quot;Mersey Care&quot;

The hospital has a burial ground, at the end of which is the Whalley (Queen Mary&#x27;s Hospital) Cemetery, containing 42 graves of Commonwealth service personnel (primarily military patients), 33 from World War I and nine from World War II, together with a memorial to nearly 300 servicemen who died in the hospital. The cemetery is accessible via the more recently established Ribble Valley Remembrance Park.

Oakhill School is a private Roman Catholic school located in the village.

==Transport==
There are hourly trains from Whalley railway station to Blackburn and Manchester Victoria running over the imposing Whalley Viaduct. These are operated by Northern. There are also bus services to Accrington, Blackburn, Burnley, Clitheroe, Longridge, Skipton from the village&#x27;s central street and Whalley Bus Station.

Bus services are operated by Blackburn Bus Company, Burnley Bus Company, Pilkington Bus and Preston Bus. The small bus station consists of three stands for buses heading south. Buses heading north, towards Clitheroe and beyond, use the bus stop located almost opposite, on King Street, the main street running through the village.

==Sport==
A local club staged speedway meetings at Dean&#x27;s Pleasure Grounds in the end of the 1920s. The track was very small and only two riders were allowed to race at any one time. A contemporary photo shows the track on flat land adjacent to a river and the showground with a helter skelter. Today there are sports facilities including tennis courts, football pitches, a bowling green and cricket ground. In 1867, Whalley hosted the first Roses Match between Lancashire County Cricket Club and Yorkshire County Cricket Club at Station Road.

==Culture==
Whalley Pickwick Night (named after the Charles Dickens novel &quot;The Pickwick Papers&quot;) is an event in December of each year with people in Victorian costume to raise funds for charity. The first event was in the 1980s as a late night (6pm–9 pm) Christmas shopping event, and in more recent years has since expanded with stalls, indoor events and a religious service.

The town participates with the adjacent village of Billington in &quot;Billington and Whalley Brass Band Club.&quot;

<doc id="789458" wikidata="Q1638544" url="?curid=789458" title="L'Année sociologique">
<text>L&#x27;Année sociologique is a biannual peer-reviewed academic journal of sociology established in 1898 by Émile Durkheim, who also served as its first editor-in-chief. It was published annually until 1925, changing its name to &quot;Annales Sociologiques&quot; between 1934 and 1942. After World War II it returned to its original name. Durkheim established the journal as a way of publicizing his own research and the research of his students and other scholars working within his new sociological paradigm.

==History==
Until 1969 a part of the journal was classified into three groups: (1) anthropology and sociology, (2) empirical qualitative sociology, and (3) empirical quantitative sociology. The rest was dedicated to book reviews. Durkheim wanted to use the journal to describe the contents of the books reviewed.

Many well-known sociologists were initial contributors to the journal, including Célestin Bouglé, Henri Hubert, Marcel Mauss, François Simiand, and Georg Simmel. During Durkheim&#x27;s editorship of the journal, the editorial board comprised a team of approximately fifty researchers, a group which became known as the &quot;French School of Sociology&quot;.

The journal was relaunched following a break in publication due to World War I and the death of Durkheim in 1917. Mauss&#x27; essay &quot;The Gift&quot; was the only article included in the relaunched edition, preceded by his eulogy to colleagues who had died since the previous edition in 1912.

===Modern journal===
Although originally influenced by Émile Durkheim, the modern journal is based on research in the history of the social sciences. Originally publishing in French only, the journal now also publishes translations from French and articles written in English.

==Abstracting and indexing==
The journal is abstracted and indexed in
*EBSCO databases
*FRANCIS
*Index Islamicus
*International Bibliography of Periodical Literature
*ProQuest databases
*Scopus

<doc id="789462" wikidata="Q1384364" url="?curid=789462" title="John S. Paraskevopoulos">
<text>John Stefanos Paraskevopoulos (Greek: Ιωάννης Στέφανος Παρασκευόπουλος; June 20, 1889 – March 15, 1951) also known as John Paras, was a Greek and South African astronomer. He spent most of his career in the Boyden Observatory, for the establishment of which he played a crusial role. 

He was born in Piraeus, Kingdom of Greece and graduated from the University of Athens, where he obtained his PhD in physics in 1910, under the supervision of Timoleon A. Argyropoulos. His thesis was entitled &quot;Variability in absorption spectra&quot;. After his graduation he spent several years as laboratory assistant in Physics and Chemistry at the University of Athens, with King George II attending laboratory courses under him at that time.

His scientific career was interrupted by nine years of military service in the Greek army during the Balkan Wars and World War I. This prevented him proceeding abroad with a scholarship he had won in 1912. He ended his military career with the rank of First Lieutenant and received multiple war medals including thirteen bars for battles in which he had fought. During part of his military service he was an instructor in Navigation at the National Observatory of Athens. He worked as an assistant of Prof. Demetrios Eginitis at the National Observatory of Athens, and in 1919, he went to the US with a two-year fellowship, spending part of that time working at Yerkes Observatory. There he met and married Dorothy W. Block. He also worked for several months at the Mount Wilson Observatory and at the United States Weather Bureau in Washington D.C..

In 1921, he returned to Athens where he became head of the astronomy department of the National Observatory of Athens with a goal to build a large telescope in Greece. However, due to the Greco-Turkish War during that period and the political instability that followed it soon became evident that the large telescope for the observatory would not materialise.

In September 1923, Dr Paras accepted an offer from Dr Harlow Shapley, to become the Superintendent of the Harvard Observatory&#x27;s Southern Station. He left this post due to a lack of funding and went to Arequipa, Peru to work at Boyden Station, a branch of Harvard Observatory, with a view to finding a more suitable location for it. The decision was made to move Boyden Station to the Union of South Africa due to better weather conditions, and Paraskevopoulos served there as director of Boyden Observatory in South Africa from 1927 to 1951, the year of his death. While in South Africa he was an extramural Professor of Astronomy at the University of the Orange Free State and he was given a honorary degree of Master of Arts from Harvard University. In 1950, he was awarded the medal of &quot;Commander&quot; of Order of the Phoenix, one of the greatest honours awarded by Greece. 

John Paraskevopoulos was a member of multiple scientific societies, including the Royal Astronomical Society, the American Astronomical Society, the South African Association for the Advancement of Science and the Societe Astronomique de France.

He co-discovered a couple of comets, including C/1941 B2 (de Kock–Paraskevopoulos), which became visible with naked eye. The crater Paraskevopoulos on the Moon and the asteroid 5298 Paraskevopoulos are named after him.

<text>Claes Rålamb (8 May 1622 – 14 March 1698) was a Swedish statesman. In 1660 he was appointed Governor of Uppland County and in 1664 he served in the Privy Council. Between 1673 and 1678, he served as the Governor of Stockholm.

== Life ==
Claes Rålamb was born on 8 May 1622 in Stockholm. In 1656–1658, he led a Swedish embassy to the Ottoman Empire&#x27;s Sublime Porte.

He died on 14 March 1698.

==The Rålamb Album of Costumes==
The Rålamb Album of Costumes contains 121 paintings depicting costumes of the Ottoman court and men and women of various ranks in Ottoman society. Each figure is drawn in Indian ink with gouache and some gilding on separate sheets of paper sized 14.5 x 10 cm. The sheets are trimmed and bound together into one volume, all as right sides that alternate top to bottom. Most leaves have inscriptions on the front or back in Swedish, French, Italian, or Latin, indicating what they represent, and each is numbered in ink on the upper right corner.

They were acquired in Constantinople in 1657–1658 by Claes Rålamb who led a Swedish embassy to the Sublime Porte, and arrived in the Swedish Royal Library / Manuscript Department in 1886.

This volume is a variant of the so-called muraqqa-album type, which is rather common in libraries in Europe. They were probably manufactured for European visitors, as precursors of the 19th century &#x27;pittoresque&#x27; photos and the present-day folklore postcards.

The miniatures have strong connections with the &#x27;Rålamb Procession Paintings&#x27;, a series of 20 paintings depicting the Sultan&#x27;s procession to Adrianople, which are now displayed in the Nordiska Museet in Stockholm. Rålamb witnessed this procession and described it at length in his diary. The paintings were executed to his order, probably by a European artist. The miniatures may well have served as models for the artist.

<text>Vladimir Aleksandrovich Fock (or Fok; ) (December 22, 1898 – December 27, 1974) was a Soviet physicist, who did foundational work on quantum mechanics and quantum electrodynamics. 

==Biography==
He was born in St. Petersburg, Russia. In 1922 he graduated from Petrograd University, then continued postgraduate studies there. He became a professor there in 1932. In 1919–1923 and 1928–1941 he collaborated with the Vavilov State Optical Institute, in 1924–1936 with the Leningrad Institute of Physics and Technology, in 1934–1941 and 1944–1953 with the Lebedev Physical Institute.

==Scientific work==
His primary scientific contribution lies in the development of quantum physics and the theory of gravitation, although he also contributed significantly to the fields of mechanics, theoretical optics, physics of continuous media. In 1926, he derived the Klein–Gordon equation. He gave his name to Fock space, the Fock representation and Fock state, and developed the Hartree–Fock method in 1930. He made many subsequent scientific contributions during the rest of his life. Fock developed the electromagnetic methods for geophysical exploration in a book &quot;The theory of the study of the rocks resistance by the carottage method&quot; (1933), methods called well logging in modern literature.

Fock made significant contributions to general relativity theory, specifically for the many-body problems. Fock criticised on scientific grounds both Einstein&#x27;s general principle of relativity, as being devoid of physical substance, and the equivalence principle, as interpreted as the equivalence of gravitation and acceleration, as having only a local validity.

In Leningrad, Fock created a scientific school in theoretical physics and raised the physics education in the USSR through his books. He wrote the first textbook on quantum mechanics &quot;Fundamentals of Quantum Mechanics&quot; (1931, 1978) and a very influential monograph &quot;The Theory of Space, Time and Gravitation&quot; (1955).

Historians of science, such as Loren Graham, see Fock as a representative and proponent of Einstein&#x27;s theory of relativity within the Soviet world. At a time when most Marxist philosophers objected to relativity theory, Fock emphasized a materialistic understanding of relativity that coincided philosophically with Marxism. 

He was a full member (academician) of the USSR Academy of Sciences (1939) and a member of the International Academy of Quantum Molecular Science.

<doc id="789474" wikidata="Q126781" url="?curid=789474" title="Cieszyn Silesia">
<text>Cieszyn Silesia, Těšín Silesia or Teschen Silesia ( ; or ; or ) is a historical region in south-eastern Silesia, centered on the towns of Cieszyn and Český Těšín and bisected by the Olza River. Since 1920 it has been divided between Poland and Czechoslovakia, and later the Czech Republic. It covers an area of about and has about 810,000 inhabitants, of which (44%) is in Poland, while (56%) is in the Czech Republic.

The historical boundaries of the region are roughly the same as those of the former independent Duchy of Cieszyn. Currently, over half of Cieszyn Silesia forms one of the euroregions, the Cieszyn Silesia Euroregion, with the rest of it belonging to Euroregion Beskydy.

== Administrative division ==

From an administrative point of view, the Polish part of Cieszyn Silesia lies within the Silesian Voivodeship and comprises Cieszyn County, the western part of Bielsko County, and the western part of the town of Bielsko-Biała.

The Czech part lies within the Moravian-Silesian Region and comprises the Karviná District, the eastern part of the Frýdek-Místek District, and the eastern parts of the Ostrava-City District and of the city of Ostrava itself.

==History==

Cieszyn Silesia covers the area of the former Duchy of Teschen, which existed from 1290 to 1918. Before 1290 the area constituted a castellany, which together with Castellany of Racibórz formed the Duchy of Racibórz in 1172. From 1202 it was a part of the united Duchy of Opole and Racibórz. From 1290 to 1653 the Duchy of Cieszyn/Teschen was ruled by the local branch of the Piast dynasty. In 1327 Casimir I, Duke of Cieszyn, swore homage to the Bohemian king John of Bohemia, and the duchy became an autonomous fiefdom of the Kingdom of Bohemia and later the Bohemian Crown. Piast rule continued until 1653 and the death of the last Piast descendant, Elizabeth Lucretia, Duchess of Cieszyn, after which it lapsed directly to the Kings of Bohemia, at that time from the Habsburg dynasty. From 1722, the dukes of Teschen hailed from the Dukes of Lorraine dynasty, from 1767 to 1822 from the Wettin dynasty, and from 1822 to 1918 from the Habsburg-Lorraine dynasty.

Cieszyn Silesia was cemented as a uniform historic, geopolitical, socio-cultural and economic entity during the period of Habsburg rule. It is distinct from the rest of Silesia because after the First Silesian War between the Habsburg Monarchy and Prussia it remained part of Austria, whereas most of Silesia became a part of Prussia.

After the end of World War I, both of the two newly created independent states of Poland and Czechoslovakia claimed the area. Czechoslovakia claimed the area partly on historic and ethnic grounds, but especially on economic and strategic grounds. The area was important for the Czechs, as the crucial railway line connecting Czech Silesia with Slovakia crossed the area (the Košice–Bohumín Railway, which was one of only two railroads that linked the Czech provinces to Slovakia at that time). The western area of Cieszyn Silesia is also very rich in coal. Many important coal mines, facilities and metallurgy factories are located there. The Polish side based its claim to the area on ethnic criteria: a majority of the area&#x27;s population was Polish according to the last (1910) Austrian census.

Two local self-government councils, Polish and Czech, were created. Initially, both national councils claimed the whole of Cieszyn Silesia for themselves, the Polish &quot;Rada Narodowa Księstwa Cieszyńskiego&quot; in its declaration &quot;Ludu śląski!&quot; of 30 October 1918 and the Czech &quot;Národní výbor pro Slezsko&quot; in its declaration of 1 November 1918. On 31 October 1918, in the wake of World War I and the dissolution of Austria-Hungary, most of the area was taken over by local Polish authorities. The short-lived interim agreement of 2 November 1918 reflected the inability of the two national councils to come to final delimitation, and on 5 November 1918 the area was divided between Poland and Czechoslovakia by another interim agreement. In 1919 the councils were absorbed by the newly created and independent central governments in Prague and Warsaw.

The former was not satisfied with the situation and on 23 January 1919 invaded the area while both parties were engaged in much larger conflicts elsewhere, Poland in its war against the West Ukrainian National Republic and Czechoslovakia in the war with the Hungarian Soviet Republic over Upper Hungary. The impetus for the Czech invasion in 1919 was Poland&#x27;s organising of elections to the Sejm (parliament) of Poland in the disputed area. The elections were to be held in the whole of Cieszyn Silesia. The Czechs claimed that the polls must not be held in the disputed area, as the delimitation was only interim and no sovereign rule should be executed there by any party. The Czech demand was rejected by the Poles and, following the rejection, Czechs decided to resolve the issue by force. Czech units led by Colonel Josef Šnejdárek and Polish units commanded by General Franciszek Latinik clashed after the swift Czech advance near Skoczów where a battle took place on 28–30 January. It was inconclusive, and before the reinforced Czech forces could resume the attack on the town, they were pressed by Entente to stop operations and a cease-fire was signed on 3 February.

In this tense climate it was decided that a plebiscite would be held in the area asking its people which country the territory should join. Plebiscite commissioners arrived there at the end of January 1920 and after analysing the situation declared a state of emergency in the territory on 19 May 1920. The situation in the territory remained very tense. Mutual intimidation, acts of terror, beatings and even killings affected the area. A plebiscite could not be held in this atmosphere. On 10 July both sides renounced the idea of plebiscite and entrusted the Conference of Ambassadors with the decision. Eventually 58.1% of the area of Cieszyn Silesia, along with 67.9% of the population, was taken over by Czechoslovakia on 28 July 1920 by decision of the Spa Conference. This decision divided a historically unified region, leaving a sizeable Polish minority in Czechoslovakia and in practice created Trans-Olza, the eastern part of the Czech part of Cieszyn Silesia delimited by the Olza River. The division of 1920 had an immediate impact on the life of the region. Many families were divided by the new border. Several municipalities were divided between the two states—Cieszyn (PL) / Český Těšín (CS), Leszna Górna (PL) / Horní Líštná (CS), and Marklowice Górne (PL) / Dolní Marklovice (CS), to name a few.

On 1 October 1938 Trans-Olza was annexed by Poland following the Munich Conference. On 1 September 1939 Zaolzie was annexed by Nazi Germany after it invaded Poland. During World War II Cieszyn Silesia was a part of Nazi Germany. Immediately after the war, its borders were returned to their 1920 state. Poland signed a treaty with Czechoslovakia in Warsaw on 13 June 1958 confirming the border as it had existed on 1 January 1938. The Czech part of Cieszyn Silesia continued to be part of Czechoslovakia until the latter&#x27;s dissolution in 1993 and since then has been part of the Czech Republic.

==Geography==
The region is separated from the rest of Silesia (and Upper Silesia in particular) by the Vistula River (the part beginning in Strumień) and from the region of Lesser Poland by the Biała River and Barania Góra mountain, the highest peak of the Polish part of the region at . The highest peak of the region is Lysá hora () in the Czech part. The region also borders Slovakia, along the Polom mountain range and Jablunkov Pass at Mosty u Jablunkova, and Moravia across the rivers Ostravice and Oder. Geomorphologically, the area of Cieszyn Silesia is located in the Western Carpathians and extends into the mesoregions:
*Ostrava Basin
*Moravian-Silesian Foothills
*Moravian-Silesian Beskids
*Jablunkov Furrow
*Jablunkov Intermontane
*Silesian Beskids
*Silesian Foothills
*Oświęcim Basin

Major towns of the Polish part of the region include Cieszyn, Bielsko (western part of Bielsko-Biała), Czechowice-Dziedzice, Skoczów, Strumień, Ustroń and Wisła. The Czech part of the region includes the eastern part of Ostrava (called &quot;Slezská Ostrava&quot;), Bohumín, Český Těšín, Frýdek (the eastern part of Frýdek-Místek), Havířov, Karviná, Orlová and Třinec.

Historically Duchy of Teschen and therefore Cieszyn Silesia formed a part of Upper Silesia. After Silesian Wars in the 18th century it was separated from the rest of Silesia, which began the process of forming its own specificity, to the extent that some contemporary authors claim that Cieszyn Silesia and Upper Silesia are separate regions.

== Culture, language and religion ==
Cieszyn Silesia as a region consolidated in the 19th century, which later became a discrete eastern part of Austrian Silesia, crownland of the Cisleithanian part of Austria-Hungary, which helped to form a distinct local identity based on language, religious and ethnic pluralism, and distinctiveness from other parts of Silesia.

The region was inhabited by several ethnic groups. Most numerous were Poles (historically called also Wasserpolaks), Czechs (mainly in the western part of the region), Germans (especially in the German language island of Bielsko-Biała) and Jews. The northern part, strongly industrialised and urbanised, is more densely populated than the southern part, which is more mountainous. The population density of Cieszyn Silesia is about 360/km2 (932/mi2). The southern, mountainous part of the region is home to the Silesian Gorals, the indigenous people of the region. They have their own distinct culture which has influenced the culture of whole region.

Cieszyn Silesia is known for its religious pluralism. The most widespread religions are Roman Catholicism and Lutheranism. The region is distinct in large part because of its Protestantism, which has an influence on the whole region. Some of the municipalities with a Protestant majority include those in the vicinity of Skoczów and Wisła, the only town in Poland with a Protestant majority. Protestant influence is reflected in the regional saying in the Cieszyn Silesian dialect &quot;Dzierży sie twardo jak lutersko wiara kole Cieszyna.&quot; (Stays strong like the Lutheran faith around Cieszyn.) Several towns, especially Bielsko, Cieszyn and Fryštát, in the past had a larger Jewish community, but the local Jews were almost completely annihilated by the Nazis during World War II and the local Germans were all deported to Germany or Austria after the war. Today, many other religious, mostly Christian, denominations are present in small numbers, including Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses, Seventh-day Adventists and Pentecostals whose movement within Poland originated in Cieszyn Silesia.

Cieszyn Silesia is also distinct for its dialect, the Cieszyn Silesian dialect, which differs from the other Silesian dialects spoken in Upper Silesia. It is a distinct dialect with predominantly Polish influences; Czech and German influences are also strong. The inhabitants of Cieszyn Silesia feel a strong regional (Cieszyn Silesian, Goral etc.) identity – locals will say they are &quot;(tu) stela&quot; (from here) – but the vast majority declare themselves to be of Polish or Czech nationality in their respective national censuses. This is somewhat different from the situation in Upper Silesia where a tendency toward autonomy still exists.

Local people however regard the Habsburg era rather fondly. The time of Maria Theresa and Franz Josef is viewed nostalgically as a time of justice, development, order and peace. This is in fact also partly rooted in a liberal and pluralistic attitude toward national and ethnic groups, liberal in comparison to other empires of that time, especially Prussia and the Russian Empire. Even in 2006 there were still portraits of Habsburg rulers on the wall in the assembly room of the Cieszyn local council.

The most widespread folk costume in the area used to be a Cieszyn folk costume associated with Cieszyn Vlachs.

== Historical ethnic structure ==
In 1900 Cieszyn Silesia had 361,015 inhabitants, of whom 218,869 were Poles (60.6%), 85,553 Czechs (23.7%) and 56,240 Germans (15.6%).

<text>Harry Edwin Wood (3 February 1881 – 27 February 1946) was an English astronomer, director of the Union Observatory in Johannesburg, and discoverer of minor planets.

Wood was born in Manchester, graduating from Manchester University in 1902 with first class honours in physics, going on to gain an MSc in 1905. In 1906 he was appointed the Chief Assistant at the &quot;Transvaal Meteorological Observatory&quot;, which soon acquired telescopes and which became known as the Union Observatory and later Republic Observatory. In July 1906, he established South Africa&#x27;s first 24-hour weather forecasts through telegraph in the Transvaal. In 1909, he married Mary Ethel Greengrass, also a physics graduate of Manchester University. Wood served as the observatory&#x27;s director from 1928 to 1941, succeeding Robert Innes. He also served as the president of the &quot;Astronomical Society of South Africa&quot; from 1929 to 1930.

Wood is credited by the Minor Planet Center with the discovery of 12 numbered asteroids during 1911–1932.

He died in Mortimer, near Cradock, South Africa, in 1946. The asteroid 1660 Wood, discovered by his colleague Jacobus Bruwer at Johannesburg, is named in his honour ().

<doc id="789487" wikidata="Q863022" url="?curid=789487" title="Billy Bonds">
<text>William Arthur Bonds (born 17 September 1946) is a former professional footballer and manager, who is most often associated with West Ham United with whom he spent 27 years as player and manager. He played 799 first-team games for West Ham in a career spanning 21 seasons.

==Background==
Born in Woolwich, south-east London, Bonds grew up in nearby Eltham, where he played for a Sunday boys&#x27; team, Moatbridge, and Kent Schoolboys and joined the groundstaff at Charlton Athletic after leaving school at 15. He played in the youth and A team and occasionally in the reserves before joining the playing staff shortly before his 18th birthday in September 1964.

==Club career==
Bonds made his League debut for Charlton against Northampton Town in February 1965 and became a regular in the first team, going on to make 95 League appearances, scoring one goal, before being signed by Ron Greenwood for West Ham United for a fee of £50,000 in May 1967. He made his first appearance for West Ham in a testimonial match for Ken Brown in the same month and made his League debut against Sheffield Wednesday in the opening game of the 1967–68 season. He was ever-present in the 1968–69 and 1969–70 seasons and played 124 consecutive league games until injury ended his run of appearances in October 1970.
Bonds played his first three seasons as a right-back before Greenwood switched him to midfield in the 1970–71 season where he counterbalanced the skills of Trevor Brooking. Bonds was at his peak in the early 1970s, helping West Ham to the semi-final of the Football League Cup in the 1971–72 season, where they lost to Stoke City after a second replay, and topping the scorers list at West Ham in the 1973–74 season with 13 goals, including a hat-trick against Chelsea. After the departure of Bobby Moore in March 1974, Bonds was appointed to the captaincy and led the club to an FA Cup final victory over Fulham in 1975 and to the final of the 1976 European Cup Winners&#x27; Cup despite a groin injury that interrupted the latter half of the 1974–75 season and part of the 1975–76 season. Greenwood moved Bonds from midfield to the back four as centre-half alongside Tommy Taylor shortly before the end of the 1976–77 season, where he was able to come out from defence with the ball.

He experienced relegation with West Ham at the end of the 1977–78 season but led West Ham to a second FA Cup victory over First Division club Arsenal in 1980, becoming the only West Ham captain to lift the FA Cup on two occasions. In 1980–81, he led West Ham to the final of the League Cup, which was lost to Liverpool after a replay, and to promotion back to the First Division.

Bonds passed Bobby Moore&#x27;s club record of appearances in 1982–83 and &#x27;officially&#x27; retired in May 1984, relinquishing the captaincy to Alvin Martin. A spate of injuries to first-team players saw him return to the squad and make 26 league and cup appearances in 1984–85. He missed the entire 1985–86 season due to a toe injury but, having passed his 40th birthday, he was able to re-establish himself in the first-team during the 1986–87 season. A knee injury that forced him out of the last two games of the 1987–88 season led to a decision to finally retire in the summer of 1988, having played his last game at Southampton in April 1988 at the age of 41 years and 226 days.

Bonds had remained at the club as a player for over 20 years, scoring 48 goals in a club record 663 League appearances. He established himself as a local hero and was the supporters&#x27; choice for &#x27;Hammer of the Year&#x27; in 1971, 1974, 1975 and 1987. He was appointed Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) in January 1988 and was presented with the PFA Merit Award in April 1988 by his fellow professional players. In May 2013 Bonds was awarded West Ham United&#x27;s first ever lifetime achievement award.

On 6 February 2019, it was announced that the East Stand at London Stadium would be renamed the Billy Bonds Stand. The unveiling took place ahead of West Ham&#x27;s home fixture against Newcastle United on 2 March.

==International career==
Bonds was capped twice at England Under-23 international level and was on the bench as a non-playing substitute for the senior international team for a World Cup qualifying match against Italy in November 1977. A collision with goalkeeper Phil Parkes in the last game of the 1980-1981 season broke two of Bonds&#x27; ribs, and ruled him out of selection for England against Brazil in May 1981. Bonds and Alvin Martin were in line to make their England debuts in that game.

==Managerial career==
After Bonds retired as a player in 1988, West Ham manager John Lyall appointed him as youth coach. He unsuccessfully applied for the manager&#x27;s post when Lyall left the club in July 1989 after West Ham had been relegated. However, when new manager Lou Macari resigned seven months later, Bonds was appointed manager in February 1990. In his first full season in charge, he took the club to promotion, when they finished as runner-up to Oldham Athletic in 1990-91 season, also reaching the semi-finals of the FA Cup where they lost to Nottingham Forest. He was awarded a second testimonial in the same season.

West Ham were relegated in the 1991–92 season in bottom place, but the board kept faith in Bonds and he led them to promotion the following season, when they finished as runner-up to Newcastle United. Bonds guided West Ham to a 13th-place finish in the 1993–94 Premier League. He resigned in August 1994, just before the new season began, when he was replaced by Harry Redknapp. He had spells in coaching at Queens Park Rangers and Reading before making a return to management with Millwall in May 1997. He managed 53 games before being sacked by the club the following year as they finished in the bottom half of Division Two.

<doc id="789489" wikidata="Q4776854" url="?curid=789489" title="Antonio Pantojas">
<text>Antonio Pantojas (November 25, 1948 – October 2, 2017) was an actor, comedian, dancer and a pioneer in the art of drag.

==Early years==
Antonio Pantojas was born in Santurce and raised in Río Piedras, the largest district of the city of San Juan, Puerto Rico, in the San José area. At the age of 10, his greatest passion was dancing. His dance teachers at the time were Madame Brewer and Mario Cox. Later, in his high school years, his Spanish teacher offered him a scholarship with dancing professor Ana García.

Pantojas&#x27;s professional training led him to become the dancing instructor and director of the San José Ballet, in Río Piedras. His mission was to promote wholesome and enjoyable cultural, folkloric, and ballet dancing in his town. Later he enrolled in Ballets de San Juan (the San Juan Ballet Company), and participated in the &quot;Ita Medina&quot; and &quot;Sarita Ayala&#x27;s&quot; ballet companies as well.

Pantojas, broadening his horizons, started taking acting lessons with &quot;Ernesto Concepción&quot; in Walter Mercado&#x27;s Academy. He also earned a Bachelor&#x27;s degree in theater at the &quot;Departamento de Drama&quot; (Drama Faculty) of the University of Puerto Rico in Río Piedras.

==Theater debut==
As the 1970s came about, he made his professional debut as an actor at the Latin American Theater Festival in the &quot;Coop-Arte&quot; theater in &quot;Barrio Obrero&quot; Santurce. He later performed the role of Herod, in &quot;Jesus Christ Superstar&quot; at the Matienzo Theater in Santurce, alongside Marian Pabón, among others.

==Drag performances==
Pantoja&#x27;s career as a transvestite performer began when he was auditioning for a role in a theater production, and the only one left was a woman&#x27;s part. He accepted the challenge to portray that role, and it was an epiphany. From then on, it became his primary career.

He wrote over 20 club acts, which he took throughout Puerto Rico, the Dominican Republic, the United States, Mexico and Peru. He also hosted his own talk show, &quot;Estoy aquí&quot; (I&#x27;m Here), on WIPR-TV, channel 6-affiliated broadcasting (from PBS).

A seasoned night club varieté entertainer, Pantojas made waves beginning in the Puerto Rico night club scene during the 1970s, with his musical incendiary political satires and his gender-bending characters. A versatile thespian, he played roles as diverse as Estragon and Pozzo in &quot;Waiting for Godot&quot;, Juliet in &quot;El público&quot; (The Audience) by Federico García Lorca (in its world premiere in Puerto Rico in 1978), and the small-time street-wise narrator in &quot;La verdadera historia de Pedro Navaja&quot;, one of the longest-running plays in Puerto Rico&#x27;s history, based on the &quot;Three Penny Opera&quot;. Pantojas produced, directed, taught, wrote and performed for more than 12 years for the &quot;Productora Nacional de Teatro, Inc.&quot;, a department from the &quot;Instituto de Cultura Puertorriqueña&quot; (National Cultural Ministry) in Puerto Rico from which he staged his versions of Alexandre Dumas, fils’ &quot;Camille&quot;, Lorca&#x27;s &quot;La casa de Bernarda Alba&quot; (The House of Bernarda Alba), Jules Tasca, An American Comedy, Venezuelan Isaac Chocrón&#x27;s &quot;La revolución&quot; (The Revolution), Argentine Alejandro Robino&#x27;s &quot;Manzana podrida&quot; (Rotten Apple) and Chilean Marco Antonio De la Parra&#x27;s &quot;La secreta obscenidad de cada día&quot; (The Secret Obscenity of Every Day), as well as the theatrical versions of &quot;Weekend at Bernie&#x27;s&quot; and &quot;The Full Monty&quot;. Pantojas also appeared in various plays, including &quot;La Cage Aux Folles&quot; (The Bird&#x27;s Cage), as &quot;Zaza&quot; and &quot;Albin&quot;, and &quot;Love, Valour and Compassion&quot; as &quot;Buzz&quot;. As a playwright, he took several workshops in New York City (writing) and Florence (creativity).

==Recent years==
In 2003, Pantojas moved to New York, and decided that due to his age he would not perform again as a transvestite actor. Pantojas stated that his face and his body had changed, and as he was a versatile actor, he could carry out different roles, pursuing his career as a performer in many ways.

He portrayed a priest, Father Amado, in the theater production &quot;El silencio es salud&quot; (Silence Is Health), performed at the Centro Cultural Clemente Soto Vélez (The Clemente Soto Cultural Center) in the Lower East Side of Manhattan, and he was featured as Amalia in the motion picture &quot;Under My Nails&quot; (2012).

He died of a heart attack on October 2, 2017.

<text>Amazing Adventures is the name of several anthology comic book series, all but one published by Marvel Comics.

The earliest Marvel series of that name introduced the company&#x27;s first superhero of the late-1950s to early-1960s period fans and historians call the Silver Age of Comic Books. That same series also included the first comic book to be labeled &quot;Marvel Comics&quot;.

==Ziff-Davis==
The first series titled &quot;Amazing Adventures&quot; was a 1950s science fiction anthology produced by Ziff-Davis and featuring painted covers. It ran for six issues, beginning c. 1950. with the first two issues being undated. Subsequent issues were dated June, August, and November 1951, and fall 1952. Its artists included Murphy Anderson, Bernard Krigstein, and Don Perlin, and at least one issue (#2) featured a cover painting by Alex Schomburg.

==Marvel Comics==
===1961 series===
Marvel&#x27;s first series of this title ran six issues, premiering with June 1961 cover-date. It featured primarily science fiction and drive-in movie-style monster stories, virtually all drawn by either Jack Kirby or Steve Ditko. Its first issue introduced the supernatural monster-hunter Doctor Droom, Marvel&#x27;s first Silver Age of Comic Books superhero. Droom had powers of telepathy and hypnotic suggestion taught him by a Tibetan lama who had requested that someone travel from the U.S. to give him medical attention.

Doctor Droom vanished into obscurity for years when the comic was re-titled and reformatted as &quot;Amazing Adult Fantasy&quot; from issues #7–14 (Dec. 1961 – July 1962). He resurfaced in the 1970s as Doctor Druid, having been renamed to avoid confusion with Doctor Doom. The series was re-titled once more for its final issue, published as &quot;Amazing Fantasy&quot; #15 (Aug. 1962), the comic book that introduced Spider-Man.

===1970 series===

Marvel&#x27;s next &quot;Amazing Adventures&quot; was a split title featuring the Inhumans (initially both written and drawn by Jack Kirby, later drawn by Neal Adams) and the Black Widow (initially by writer Gary Friedrich and penciler John Buscema). The Widow was dropped after (vol. 2) #8, and full-length Inhumans stories ran for two issues before that feature, too, was dropped.

Vol. 2 #11 (March 1972) introduced solo stories of erstwhile X-Men member the Beast, in which he was mutated into his modern-day blue-furred (originally grey-furred) form. The initial story was by writer Gerry Conway, penciler Tom Sutton, and inker Syd Shores. Steve Englehart became the feature&#x27;s writer with issue #12 and added Patsy Walker and her then-husband, &quot;Buzz&quot; Baxter, to the Beast&#x27;s supporting cast in issue #13.

In the fall of 1972, writers Englehart, Conway and Len Wein crafted a metafictional unofficial crossover spanning titles from both major comics companies. Each comic featured Englehart, Conway, and Wein, as well as Wein&#x27;s first wife Glynis, interacting with Marvel or DC characters at the Rutland Halloween Parade in Rutland, Vermont. Beginning in &quot;Amazing Adventures&quot; (vol. 2) #16 (by Englehart with art by Bob Brown and Frank McLaughlin), the story continued in &quot;Justice League of America&quot; #103 (by Wein, Dick Dillin and Dick Giordano), and concluded in &quot;Thor&quot; #207 (by Conway and penciler John Buscema). As Englehart explained in 2010: &quot;It certainly seemed like a radical concept and we knew that we had to be subtle (laughs) and each story had to stand on its own, but we really worked it out. It&#x27;s really worthwhile to read those stories back to back to back – it didn&#x27;t matter to us that one was at DC and two were at Marvel – I think it was us being creative, thinking what would be really cool to do&quot;. The Beast&#x27;s feature ended with (vol. 2) #16 (Jan. 1973).

Following an issue that reprinted the back-up features recounting the Beast&#x27;s origin (edited from &quot;[Uncanny] X-Men&quot; #49–53 (with a new, single-page introduction by writer Englehart and penciler Jim Starlin), the title introduced the series &quot;War of the Worlds&quot; and its central character, Killraven, in (vol. 2) #18 (May 1973). Created by co-plotters Roy Thomas and Neal Adams, scripter Conway, and pencilers Adams and Howard Chaykin, it was taken over by writer Don McGregor for an acclaimed run from (vol. 2) #21 (Nov. 1973) to the final issue, (vol. 2) #39 (Nov. 1976). Pencillers were Herb Trimpe, Rich Buckler, Gene Colan, and, most notably, P. Craig Russell from (vol. 2) #27.

Its sister publication was &quot;Astonishing Tales&quot;. Additionally, plans were announced for a never-realized third split book featuring Doctor Strange and the Iceman.

===1979 series===
Volume 3 was a reprint series running 14 issues (Dec. 1979 – Jan. 1981). It reprinted &quot;X-Men&quot; #1–8 (Sept. 1963 – March 1964), the first six issues of which were split into two-part stories with an accompanying back-up feature. For all but issue #12, this was the &quot;Origin of the X-Men&quot; back-up feature from &quot;X-Men&quot; #38–48. The exception was the incongruous, 11-page Jim Steranko &quot;Nick Fury, Agent of S.H.I.E.L.D.&quot; story, &quot;Today Earth Died&quot;, from &quot;Strange Tales&quot; #168 (May 1968).

Eight covers of this 1979 series were reprints of the Jack Kirby originals; artists for the rest included penciler John Byrne on (vol. 3) #6 and 9.

===Other===
The similarly named &quot;Amazing High Adventure&quot; was a sporadically published anthology of historical, biblical and science-fiction adventure stories from August 1984 to December 1986. Like the 1950s Ziff-Davis &quot;Amazing Adventures&quot;, it, too, featured painted covers, with the artists including Joe Chiodo, Frank Cirocco, Dan Green, and John Bolton. A one-shot, cover-billed as &quot;Amazing Adventures&quot; (July 1988) but listed as &quot;Amazing Adventure&quot; in the copyright indicia, was similarly an anthology with a painted cover.

<doc id="789499" wikidata="Q5195845" url="?curid=789499" title="Curtis P. Iaukea">
<text>Colonel Curtis Piʻehu Iaukea (December 13, 1855 – March 5, 1940) served as a court official, army officer and diplomat of the Kingdom of Hawaii. He later became an influential official for the subsequent regimes of the Provisional Government and the Republic and the Territory of Hawaii.

Iaukea was raised from an early age to serve the Hawaiian royal family. He first gained prominence during the reign of King Kalākaua when he served as an important court official and an army officer in the volunteer army of the Kingdom of Hawaii. He held numerous significant positions including governor of Oahu and chamberlain to the Royal Household. He also served as Hawaii&#x27;s ambassador to Europe and Asia, attending the coronation of Tsar Alexander III of Russia and the Golden Jubilee of Queen Victoria. Iaukea received numerous Hawaiian honors and foreign decorations during his service to the kingdom. Following the overthrow of the monarchy, he continued to work for the subsequent regimes of the Provisional Government and the Republic of Hawaii. He served as an officer on the military staff of President Sanford B. Dole and represented the Republic at the Diamond Jubilee of Queen Victoria.

After Hawaii&#x27;s annexation to the United States, he became a member of the Democratic Party of Hawaii and served in many official positions in the newly created Territory of Hawaii including sheriff of Honolulu County, senator of the Third District, secretary of Hawaii, and acting governor of Hawaii. As one of the last surviving representatives of the Hawaiian royal court, he served as business manager and private secretary to the deposed Queen Liliʻuokalani until her death in 1917.

== Early life and family ==
Curtis Piʻehu Iʻaukea was born December 13, 1855, in Waimea, on the island of Hawaii. Descended from the Hawaiian &quot;aliʻi&quot; (noble) class, his parents were John W. Iaukea and Lahapa Nalanipo. His father served as the district magistrate of Hamakua and their family were well-known on the island of Hawaii. From his paternal line, he descended from Namiki, a priest of the Pa‘ao order, and Kahiwa Kānekapōlei, a daughter of Kamehameha I. On his mother&#x27;s side, he descended from Kalanipo or Nalanipo, a descendant of the ʻI clan of Hilo and the Mahi clan of Kohala. His mother&#x27;s family were also related to Kekuʻiapoiwa II, the mother of King Kamehameha I. His family were considered to be of the Hawaiian &quot;kaukau aliʻi&quot; rank, or lower ranking chiefs in service to the royal family.

He and his sister Maraea were born in the family&#x27;s home in Waimea, which stood across the Waikōloa Stream from the residence of early American Protestant missionary Lorenzo Lyons who was a close friend of the family. Iaukea was given the first name Curtis after Lyons&#x27; son Curtis Jere Lyons. When he was later presented to King Kamehameha IV as a young child, the king gave him the additional name Piʻehu in respect of his shyness and lighter skin complexion. At court, he was known and referred to by his Hawaiian name Piʻehu.

Shortly after birth, he was adopted by his maternal uncle Kaihupaʻa to be raised in the Hawaiian custom of &quot;hānai&quot;, an informal form of adoption between extended families practiced by Hawaiian royals and commoners alike. His uncle had been educated by the American Protestant missionary Levi Chamberlain and had served his entire life as a personal assistant and servant to King Kamehameha III and later his successor Kamehameha IV. Iaukea was taken to the kingdom&#x27;s capital at Honolulu to live with Kaihupaʻa and his wife Keliaipala. They lived near the grounds of the old ʻIolani Palace, in the building of the former Royal School. Renamed Halepoepoe (meaning circular or round house), this building had been turned into a home for royal retainers and the &quot;kahu&quot; (caretakers) for the reigning King Kamehameha IV. Around the time he was five or six, Iaukea fell into a well and his uncle Kaihupaʻa broke his foot in the process of saving him, later dying from the injuries he sustained.

== Childhood and education ==
Iaukea was raised at the Hawaiian court to become a &quot;kahu&quot; and continue his family &quot;kuleana&quot; (responsibility) of serving the Hawaiian royal family. The young boy was intended to be raised as a page or valet, and companion for Prince Albert Edward Kamehameha, the only son and heir of Kamehameha IV and his wife Queen Emma. These plans were never realized because the prince died in 1862, at the age of four. In later life, Iaukea noted,


As a ward of the Hawaiian government, he was sent to an Anglican boarding school. Around 1862 or 1863, Iaukea was enrolled in St. Alban&#x27;s College, founded by Bishop Thomas Nettleship Staley and his assistants Archdeacon George Mason and Rev. Edmund Ibbotson, which was located in the Pauoa Valley. Here he first developed a friendship with William Pitt Leleiohoku, the &quot;hānai&quot; son of Princess Keʻelikōlani. Their bond was later compared to the friendship of Damon and Pythias. 

In 1863, the school was relocated and merged with the Luaʻehu School, in Lahaina, Maui, established by the Anglican Rev. William R. Scott and later administered by Archdeacon Mason who served as Iaukea&#x27;s mentor. In 1870, he returned to Oahu when the school was again relocated back to its original site. These institutions were the precursors of the present ʻIolani School in Honolulu. Some of his other classmates included Samuel Nowlein and Robert Hoapili Baker, both of whom were politicians in later life.

== Service to the monarchy ==
In 1871, before leaving Hawaii, Archdeacon Mason informed Iaukea that had Kamehameha IV still been living, he would have intended for him to continue his education in Europe, and eventually to groom him to become an ordained chaplain for the royal family. Iaukea was deeply touched by the high expectations of his deceased benefactor. After finishing his education, he served King Kamehameha V as a kāhili bearer and steward at the palace, awaiting an assignment from the king. 

In 1872, the king sent Iaukea and William K. Hutchison, the son of Ferdinand William Hutchison, to Lahaina where they learned the art of sugar boiling in the growing sugar industry on Maui, and helped manage the West Maui Sugar Plantation, in which the king had a share. They were placed under the care of Governor Paul Nahaolelua. After the king&#x27;s death in 1872, Iaukea briefly left his service to the royal court and moved to Hilo to live with his sister Maraea and her husband Charles Akono Nui Akau, a Chinese-Hawaiian manager of the Paukaʻa Sugar Plantation. The listless Iaukea enjoyed his new-found independence, but he also felt unfulfilled. He later wrote: &quot;I was dangling at a loose end. And even though I was enjoying my independence, I was aware that I did not know just where I was going or what I ought to do. I was frustrated without realizing it.&quot;

=== Reign of Kalākaua ===

Following the short reign of Lunalilo, King Kalākaua ascended to the throne of Hawaii in 1874. During a tour of the island of Hawaii, Iaukea caught the eye of the new king who commanded him to return to the royal court. He became a personal aide to the king&#x27;s younger brother, and former schoolmate, Prince William Pitt Leleiohoku. Both men were of a similar age and shared the same interest in sports and music. He became a member of the 
Kawaihau Glee Club, sponsored by the Prince and his friends, which competed with the singing clubs of the king, Princess Liliʻuokalani and Princess Likelike. Liliʻuokalani noted her brother&#x27;s group &quot;consisted in a large degree of the very purest and sweetest male voices to be found amongst the native Hawaiians&quot;. In later life, Iaukea recalled, &quot;Happy days those were; the days when &#x27;Wine, Women and Song&#x27; were the rule of the day.&quot; The Prince died on April 7, 1877.

On April 15, 1878, Iaukea was commissioned as captain of the Prince’s Own Artillery Corps, Company A. This unit was a voluntary military regiment reorganized in 1874 and originally headed by King Kalākaua. At this time, the army of the Kingdom of Hawaii consisted of five volunteer companies, including the Prince&#x27;s Own, and the regular troops of the King&#x27;s Household Guard. Each unit was subject to being called for active service when necessary. 

On November 29, 1878, Iaukea was also appointed to King Kalākaua&#x27;s personal military staff, with the rank of colonel. The reign of Kalakaua was characterized by his emphasis on military pomp. On October 4, 1886, Iaukea was created adjutant general to the Forces of the Kingdom, succeeding upon the resignation of Charles T. Gulick. According to the military act of 1886, as adjutant general, he was the second-in-command after John Owen Dominis, who was appointed lieutenant general and commander-in-chief with the king as supreme commander and generalissimo.

At different times during the king&#x27;s reign he held the important posts of tax collector for Koolaupoko, member of the Privy Council of State, commissioner to the Great International Fisheries Exhibition in London, member of the Board of Health, disbursing agent for the Royal Guard, collector general of Customs, commissioner of Crown Lands and land agent, and private secretary to the king, as well as other minor positions and appointments. He served as chamberlain to the Royal Household from 1886 to 1888, succeeding to this post upon the resignation of Charles Hastings Judd. After Dominis&#x27; appointment as lieutenant general, Iaukea was appointed as his successor as the governor of Oahu. He served in this position from October 4, 1886, to August 5, 1887, when Dominis was reappointed to the post.

From 1880 to 1883 he served as the secretary of the Foreign Office. In this capacity, he worked as the chief clerk and secretary for Minister of Foreign Affairs William Lowthian Green and later Green&#x27;s successor Walter Murray Gibson. After a period in the service of this new foreign minister, he was asked to resign by Gibson who appointed his friend Joseph S. Webb to the position instead. Iaukea returned to serve as a staff member of the king, fast becoming a favorite in the royal entourage. During Kalākaua&#x27;s coronation ceremony in 1883, he played a large ceremonial role as the bearer of the Sword of State, while his wife served as one of the ladies-in-waiting to Queen Kapiʻolani. 

Following the coronation ceremony, the king informed Iaukea that he and his cabinet had commissioned him as the head of a diplomatic trip around the world. Iaukea was taken aback by the honor since he had no experience in diplomacy and was only twenty-eight at the time. In this role, Iaukea would become the most traveled member of the Hawaiian administration after Kalākaua who had made a similar world tour in 1881. Commissioned as the kingdom&#x27;s ambassador with the rank of envoy extraordinary and minister plenipotentiary, he represented Hawaii at the coronation of Tsar Alexander III of Russia on May 27, 1883, and led a subsequent diplomatic tour of the courts of Europe and Japan. Traveling with his secretary, the part-Hawaiian Henry F. Poor, Iaukea made a favorable impression on the courts of Europe. In Russia, they had an audience with the new tsar and tsarina, met Russian Foreign Minister Nikolay Girs, and socialized on an equal footing with the other foreign dignitaries. Iaukea later noted, &quot;the sight of my country&#x27;s flag floating over the entrance to the Hotel Duseaux besides those of the United States and Japan, gave me an added incentive to meet the responsibilities that lay ahead and discharge them with honor&quot;. The two Hawaiians traveled to the courts of Berlin, Vienna, Belgrade, London, Rome, and India and Japan via the Suez Canal. In London, he visited the International Fisheries Exhibition. In Japan, he met with the Emperor Meiji and helped finalize an immigration plan between Japan and Hawaii previously negotiated by Kalākaua during his world tour.

In 1887, he was appointed ambassador to Great Britain, with the rank of envoy extraordinary and minister plenipotentiary to the Court of St James&#x27;s, and accompanied Queen Kapiʻolani and Princess Liliʻuokalani to the celebration of Queen Victoria&#x27;s Golden Jubilee. The diplomatic party also included Governor John Owen Dominis, husband of the princess, Colonel James Harbottle Boyd, secretary and attaché to Iaukea, and their attendants. On the journey across the United States, they visited Washington, DC and met with President Grover Cleveland. The Hawaiian party was graciously received during the Jubilee and given the same honor as every nation in attendance. Iaukea translated for Queen Kapiʻolani, who spoke only Hawaiian, during her official audience with Queen Victoria.

Iaukea was decorated with the Royal Order of Kapiolani and the Royal Order of the Crown of Hawaii in 1884, and biographies of him claim he also received all the Hawaiian orders during the reign of Kalākaua, i.e. the honors of the Royal Order of Kamehameha I, the Royal Order of Kalākaua, and the Royal Order of the Star of Oceania. He also received many foreign honors and decorations including Commander (Third Class) Order of the Crown of Thailand, Commander of an unspecified order from the Ottoman Empire, Grand Cross and Cordon of Order of Saint Stanislaus of Russia, the Grand Cross and Ribbon of the Order of the Cross of Takovo of Serbia, the Legion of Honour of France, Grand Cross of the Order of the Crown of Italy, Knight Commander of the Order of St. Olav of Sweden-Norway, Knight Commander of the Order of the Rising Sun of Japan, the Belgian Red Cross, Grand Officer of the Order of the Liberator of Venezuela, the British Queen Victoria Golden Jubilee, and Diamond Jubilee Medal.

== Following the overthrow ==
After Kalākaua&#x27;s death and the accession of Queen Liliʻuokalani, Iaukea was reappointed colonel of the queen&#x27;s personal military staff, and as agent of the Crown Lands. The monarchy was overthrown on January 17, 1893, by the Committee of Safety, with the support of United States Minister John L. Stevens, and the landing of American forces from the USS &quot;Boston&quot;. After a brief transition under the Provisional Government, the oligarchical Republic of Hawaii was established on July4, 1894, with Sanford B. Dole as president.
Following the overthrow, Iaukea was asked by the Provisional Government to remain in his post as agent of the Crown Lands. He took the oath of allegiance to the new regime on January 24, 1893. According to Iaukea, in later life, he decided to continue working for the two subsequent regimes after consulting with the deposed queen and gaining her approval. He also cited the economic necessity of working for the government since he and his wife had to sell their Honolulu residence around this time. From this point his friendship with Liliʻuokalani cooled with Iaukea noting that &quot;my calls on [her] lacked the personal informality of happier days&quot;.

During this period, he worked as the sub-agent of Public Lands. He also served on the Board of Prison Inspectors in 1893, and was appointed special police constable of the Kona District of Oahu in 1894. On November 27, 1895, he was commissioned with the demoted rank of major and quartermaster on the General Staff of the Republic.
Having developed a close friendship with the British Crown, Iaukea returned to the United Kingdom to celebrate the Diamond Jubilee of Queen Victoria in 1897. Representing the Republic, he served at the demoted rank of secretary and military attaché to Special Envoy Samuel Mills Damon. In January 1898, he accompanied President Dole and his wife to Washington, DC, also in the role of secretary and military attaché.

== After annexation ==
When the United States annexed Hawaii and established the Territory of Hawaii, Iaukea became involved in local politics as a member of the Democratic Party of Hawaii. In the general election of 1904, he unsuccessfully challenged Prince Jonah Kūhiō Kalanianaʻole, a Republican, for the position of congressional delegate from Hawaii on the Democratic ticket. In the 1906 election, he was elected as the second sheriff of the County of Honolulu, succeeding Arthur M. Brown. He served in this position from 1907 to 1909. He was a trustee of the Queen&#x27;s Medical Center from 1905 to 1909.

He served as a Democratic member of the Territorial Senate from 1913 to 1915, representing the Third District of Oahu. Under the Democratic Governor Charles J. McCarthy, Iaukea was appointed by President Woodrow Wilson as the Secretary of Hawaii from May 3, 1917, to October 12, 1921, and acting governor of the Territory from December 30, 1919, to March 30, 1920.

After the death of Joseph Oliver Carter, Iaukea became the private secretary and business agent of Liliʻuokalani. From 1909 to 1917, he served in this role and became a trustee of The Queen Liliʻuokalani Trust, a charitable trust established by the queen to manage her landholdings and estate after her death. Iaukea and his wife Charlotte were at Liliʻuokalani&#x27;s side when she died in 1917. He was the one who raised her royal standard (flag) over Washington Place to signal her death, and was in charge of planning Liliʻuokalani&#x27;s state funeral. He served as an honorary pallbearer during the funeral procession while his son Frederick Hank Iaukea served as an active pallbearer carrying the catafalque bearing the casket of the queen to her final resting place for entombment with her family members in the Kalākaua Crypt of the Royal Mausoleum of Mauna ʻAla. As a former chamberlain, and one of the last surviving representatives of the former dynasty, he had planned the royal funerals of Princess Kaʻiulani in 1899, Prince David Kawānanakoa in 1908, and Prince Jonah Kūhiō Kalanianaʻole in 1922. He was chairman of the Hawaiian Homes Commission from 1933 to 1935, member of the Archives Commission from 1937 and custodian of the throne room of Iolani Palace from 1937.

Iaukea died in Honolulu, on March 5, 1940, at the age of 84. He was buried at the Oahu Cemetery. As the last surviving court member of the defunct monarchy, Iaukea was regarded as an important authority on the past during his lifetime but also as a positive example of those who adapted to the changing politics of the islands. His great-great-granddaughter Sydney Lehua Iaukea noted:

Curtis P. Iaukea not only embodied these changes but was directly implicated in this process as a permanent figure in the government of both the Hawaiian Kingdom and the Territory of Hawai‘i. Toward the end of his life, he was celebrated as one Hawaiian who made the leap to American citizenry successfully ...
Curtis P. Iaukea was celebrated as a Hawaiian who survived the monarchy and lived to tell about it. He was also regarded as representing all that was apparently good about becoming American, even though until the end of his life the photos of my great-great-grandfather show him proudly wearing the uniforms and medals that accompanied his trips to faraway places as a diplomat for the Hawaiian Kingdom. He was never pictured wearing his uniforms, after the fact, for the Republic of Hawai‘i as its official diplomat. Even so, the territorial government regularly drew on his memories to close the gap between the Hawaiian Kingdom and the territory and in order to legitimize its own existence in the process. It needed to insert its inevitability into the historical narrative, and used my great-great-grandfather’s public memories to represent its &quot;evidence of inheritance.&quot;

== Personal life ==

Iaukea married Charlotte Kahaloipua Hanks (1856–1936) on April 7, 1877. They had met through the acquaintanceship of Charlotte&#x27;s aunt Uwini Auld and Queen Emma. The only daughter of American businessman Frederick Leslie Hanks and Chinese-Hawaiian Akini, Charlotte was of mixed-Caucasian, Native Hawaiian and Chinese descent. Her father was allegedly a relative of Nancy Hanks, the mother of President Abraham Lincoln, and had settled in Hawaii after his second visit in 1853. A descendant of the Kahaloipua line of chiefs, her genealogy was considered of a higher rank than her husband. Her maternal grandfather was the early Chinese businessman Tyhune (i.e. Wong Tai-hoon), who owned the Tyhune Store in downtown Honolulu from the 1830s to the 1850s and invested in sugar, shipping, merchandise, and liquor sales. She inherited lands in Waikiki and Honolulu from her maternal grandmother Wahinekapu, a Hawaiian chiefess and the daughter or sister of Kahanaumaikai, who had been a recipient of land in the Great Māhele. Charlotte served as a lady-in-waiting for Queen Kapiʻolani, and was a close friend of Liliʻuokalani. During the monarchy, she received the honor of Knight Companion of the Royal Order of Kapiolani.

The couple had two children: a son named Frederick Hanks Nalaniahi Iaukea (1881–1944) and a daughter named Lorna Kahilipuaokalani Iaukea (1885–1973), who married Edward B. Watson.
Before his death, Iaukea had hired writer and researcher Jeanne Hobbs to write his memoir entrusting her with many of his personal papers. However, he later sued her for not finishing the memoir and demanded the return of these papers, but died before getting them back. Reclaiming these documents from Hobbs after her death in 1953, his daughter Lorna wrote and published the book &quot;By Royal Command: The Official Life and Personal Reminiscences of Colonel Curtis Piehu Iaukea at the Court of Hawaii&#x27;s Rulers&quot; using the personal writings of her father. In 2012, his great-great-granddaughter Sydney Lehua Iaukea wrote &quot; The Queen and I: A Story of Dispossessions and Reconnections in Hawaiʻi&quot;, a book about Iaukea and the role he played in the estate of Queen Liliʻuokalani. Other notable descendants of Iaukea and Charlotte include writer Lesley Kehaunani Iaukea, and professional wrestlers King Curtis Iaukea and Rocky Iaukea.

<text>John Glashan (born John McGlashan, 24 December 1927 – 15 June 1999) was a Scottish cartoonist, illustrator and playwright. He was the creator of the &quot;Genius&quot; cartoons.

Glashan&#x27;s cartoons typically included small pen-and-ink figures drawn over a fabulous backdrop often featuring fantastic Gothic or imaginary architecture, surreal landscapes or gloriously impractical ingenious-looking machines.

==Life and work==

Born in Glasgow and the son of the portrait painter Archibald A. McGlashan, John McGlashan studied painting at the Glasgow School of Art after national service in the army. He moved to London intending to make a living from painting portraits, but was unable to do so. After switching to cartooning and illustrating he shortened his surname to &quot;Glashan&quot;.

Glashan&#x27;s cartoons appeared in &quot;Lilliput&quot;, &quot;Queen&quot;, &quot;The Spectator&quot;, &quot;Punch&quot;, &quot;Private Eye&quot;, and various London newspapers, as well as &quot;Holiday&quot; and the &quot;New Yorker&quot;.

Glashan&#x27;s illustrations were also used in advertising material for brands such as ICI, Aalders and Marchant, and Blue Nun.

A series of humorous guidebooks created with Jonathan Routh in the late 1960s allowed extensive expression of Glashan&#x27;s graffiti-like style, combining small figures (often bearded men) with scrawled text – but, even here, often with elaborate backdrops.

The &quot;Genius&quot; cartoons, which allowed Glashan to use colour and a great expanse of space, ran in the &quot;Observer Magazine&quot; from 1978 to 1983, whereupon he concentrated on landscape painting. His cartoons reappeared from 1988 in the &quot;Spectator&quot;.

==Publications==
===Books===

* &quot;The Eye of the Needle.&quot; London: Dennis Dobson, 1961. A hardback of about eighty (unnumbered) pages. Some stories spread over as many as seven pages; many others are just single frames. Glashan&#x27;s style already seems fully formed: little bearded men (by themselves, in small groups, or even in their thousands) are rendered even smaller by lovingly drawn but oppressive neo-renaissance or rococo backdrops. In the inner rear flap, we are told that Glashan was previously a brain surgeon. Much, perhaps all of the content of the book had previously appeared in &quot;Lilliput&quot; (a fact that goes unmentioned).
* &quot;Speak Up You Tiny Fool.&quot; New York: Dial, 1966. A hardback of about ninety (unnumbered) pages, in a larger format than &quot;The Eye of the Needle&quot; and duplicating much of the content of the earlier book, with additions. Jules Feiffer provides an introduction.
* &quot;The Penguin John Glashan.&quot; Harmondsworth, Middx: Penguin, 1967. A paperback of about a hundred (unnumbered) pages, duplicating much of &quot;Speak Up You Tiny Fool&quot;.
* &quot;Private Eye Cartoon Library 7: The Jokes of John Glashan.&quot; London: Private Eye &amp; André Deutsch, 1975. (On the front cover: &quot;Private Eye Cartoon Library 7 / John Glashan / The Meths Festival and Other Celebrations&quot;.) Contains about one hundred (unnumbered) pages of cartoons, of which most were drawn from the book rather than reproduced from &quot;Private Eye&quot; (or so the copyright page informs us). Perhaps three quarters of the book is devoted to &quot;The Meths Festival and other celebrations&quot;, a story about what transpires during one annual festival held in &quot;the sleepy pig iron town of Grinding Mallet&quot;, a grim place whose every brick is lovingly delineated. While the Head Methner of the Meth Chateau shows around an appreciative group of Japanese businessmen, festival-goer Filbert learns to walk with his head tilted to one side.
* &quot;The Mental Health Work-Out Book: An Account of the Darren Whitlow Technique.&quot; London: Crystal Clear, 1986. . &quot;Researched&quot; (written and illustrated) by Glashan. On the back cover: &quot;This volume shows how you too can build a Powerful Brain and enjoy the Benefits of Radiant Mental Health.&quot;
* &quot;John Glashan&#x27;s World.&quot; London: Robinson, 1991. . An anthology of Glashan&#x27;s work.

<text>A conservatory is a building or room having glass or other transparent roofing and walls, used as a greenhouse or a sunroom. Usually it refers to a space attached to a conventional building such as a house, especially in the United Kingdom. Elsewhere, especially in America, it can often refer to a large freestanding glass-walled building in a botanic garden or park, sometimes also called a palm house if tall enough for trees. Municipal conservatories became popular in the early 19th century.

==Description==

Many cities, especially those in cold climates and with large European populations, have built municipal conservatories to display tropical plants and hold flower displays. This type of conservatory was popular in the early nineteenth century, and by the end of the century people were also giving them a social use (e.g., tea parties). Conservatory architecture varies from typical Victorian glasshouses to modern styles, such as geodesic domes. Many were large and impressive structures and are included in the list below.

In the UK, the legal definition of a conservatory is a building that has at least 50% of its side wall area glazed and at least 75% of its roof glazed with translucent materials, either polycarbonate sheeting or glass. Today, the terms sunroom, solarium and conservatory are used interchangeably by the public, but in general the term conservatory and particularly English conservatory evoke the image of an ornate structure, echoing the traditions of that Victorian era of conservatory building. Modern conservatories tend also to be graced with a traditional cresting and finial, along with single, double patio or even bi-folding doors.
These structures have been designed and built around the world, in private gardens, parks, and botanical institutions. Smaller &quot;garden conservatories&quot; have become popular, which may be dual-function, equally devoted to horticulture and recreation, or favor the latter, as a solarium or sunroom.

==History==

Conservatories originated in the 16th century when wealthy landowners sought to cultivate citrus fruits such as lemons and oranges that began to appear on their dinner tables brought by traders from warmer regions of the Mediterranean. Preservation of citrus and other tender plants started out as crudely as building a pergola over potted plants or beds, or simply moving potted plants indoors for the cold season. Known in Italy as limonaia, these early structures employed wood panels or open galleries to protect from the cold.

Further north in Europe, the preservation of orange trees became the trend with special-purpose buildings built to protect the tasty, but delicate fruit. Orangeries, as they came to be called, were typically enclosed structures built with wood, brick or stone with tall vertical windows on the south walls. The citrus trees were typically in huge pots or tubs, and wheeled outside for the summer months, as at the Gardens of Versailles. Use of these rooms expanded socially and practically, being used to entertain and to host a wider variety of plants. The term greenhouse came to describe the rooms and conservatories for tender plants. In the 18th century, sloped glass began to be used in conservatory design to allow more light into the structure, enhancing conditions for plant growth. This innovation may have been influenced by the work of Dutch scientist Jan Ingenhousz, who studied the role of light in photosynthesis. However, while his research likely contributed to advancements in horticultural practices, it is not definitively known if he directly influenced the adoption of sloping glass for conservatories.

The 19th century was the golden age of conservatory building, primarily in England. English conservatories were the product of English love of gardening and new technology in glass and heating technology. Many of the magnificent public conservatories, built of iron and glass, are the result of this era. Kew Gardens in London is an example of a large greenhouse used for growing tender and rare plants, or, less often, for birds and rare animals – sometimes with the plants and animals living together. Other examples include the Great Palm House at Kew Gardens that was built in 1844, built by Decimus Burton and the Crystal Palace, built for London&#x27;s Great Exhibition of 1851 by Sir Joseph Paxton.

The widespread construction of UK conservatories came to a halt with the onset of World War II. While the advent of insulated glass in the 1950s and 1960s saw the development of simple sunroom structures, it was not until the 1970s that creative architects and builders began to recreate the Victorian styling of 19th-century English conservatories in smaller domestic versions using insulated glass. In contemporary construction, a conservatory differs from an orangery in having more than 75% of its roof surface made from glass. Frame and roof materials include aluminium, PVCu and timber. A conservatory by definition must have more than 50% of its wall surface glazed. Contemporary conservatories use a number of technologies to ensure glass is as energy efficient as possible, ensuring it lets in the maximum light possible while maintaining a steady temperature throughout summer and winter. Technologies include argon-impregnated glass, easy clean coatings, heat reflective film, thermal ribbons or thermal breaks – hollow sections of glass that intercept heat. The latest glass technologies involve self-tinting glass that darkens as heat builds up during a summer&#x27;s day and then lightens as the surface temperature of the glass cools later in the day.

<text>Varney Air Lines was an American airline company that started service on April 6, 1926, as an airmail carrier. Formed by Walter Varney, the airline was based in Boise, Idaho, United States. The airline is one of the predecessors of United Airlines.

==Historical background==
In 1925, the Congress passed HR 7064 entitled &quot;An Act to encourage commercial aviation and to authorize the Postmaster General to contract for Air Mail Service&quot; (aka &quot;The Kelly Act&quot;) which directed the U.S. Post Office Department to contract with private airlines to carry the mail over designated routes many of which connected with the Government operated Transcontinental Air Mail route between New York and San Francisco. Varney won the contract for CAM-5 as the only bidder. Its first flight under contract with the USPOD was from Pasco, Washington to Elko, Nevada with an intermediate stop in Boise. That air freight contract grew into the birth of one of the world&#x27;s biggest airlines.

Pasco at the time was a rail center, more or less midway between Portland, Seattle, and Spokane. Mail trains leaving those cities in the evening arrived in Pasco early the next morning. Mail could be transferred to and from the biplanes cutting coast to coast delivery by days. This was the logic for basing the CAM service in Pasco.

==First flight==
Pilot Leon D. Cuddeback flew the first eastbound CAM-5 flight, leaving in the early dawn hours from Pasco. Between 4,000 and 6,000 cheering people sent the pilot off with of mail.

==Later history==
Varney added a Breese-Wilde Model 5 and replaced its original Swallows with Stearman C3s and thereafter upgraded as new equipment became available. Subsequent aircraft included the larger Stearman M-2 Speedmail and the Boeing Model 40 dedicated mail planes, and finally the more modern Boeing 247 twin-engine monoplane. Arriving in 1933, the 247 greatly expanded Varney&#x27;s ability to carry passengers as well as mail.

Varney soon added Salt Lake City, Portland, and Seattle to its route.

In 1930, Varney was acquired by United Aircraft and Transport Corporation, itself formed by a merger of Boeing and Pratt &amp; Whitney Aircraft, and folded into its airlines group along with the other acquired airlines: Pacific Air Transport, Boeing, and National Air Transport.

In 1934, the Air Mail scandal resulted in the passage of the Air Mail Act which forbade aircraft manufacturers from operating airlines. As a result, United Aircraft and Transport Corporation was broken up. The airlines group became United Airlines. Since Varney was a part of United, the founding year of United is 1926, and making United the oldest commercial airline in the United States.

===Continental Airlines===
Following cancellation of all domestic airmail contracts by the Roosevelt administration in 1934, Robert F. Six learned of an opportunity to buy into the Southwest Division of Varney Speed Lines which needed money to handle its newly acquired Pueblo-El Paso route. Six was introduced to Louis Mueller, who had helped found the Southwest Division of Varney in 1934, and bought into the airline with US$90,000 becoming general manager on July 5, 1936. The carrier was renamed Continental Air Lines (later changed to &quot;Airlines&quot;) on July 8, 1937. Six changed the name to &quot;Continental&quot; because he wanted the airline name to reflect his desire to have the airline fly all directions throughout the United States. Decades later, in 2010, United (the direct successor to Varney) would merge with Continental as well.

<doc id="789544" wikidata="Q221142" url="?curid=789544" title="Angelos Basinas">
<text>Angelos Basinas ( , born 3 January 1976) is a Greek former professional footballer who played as a defensive midfielder. He could also operate as a central midfielder and a centre back. He is best remembered for his key role in the Greece national team that won the 2004 European Championship. He provided the corner kick through which Angelos Charisteas scored the winning goal in the final against Portugal.

==Club career==
===Panathinaikos===
Basinas started his career with Greek side Panathinaikos, during his time at Panathinaikos he won both the league and the Greek Cup in 2004.
After a row broke out between Basinas, the manager and the Panathinaikos board over wages, Basinas was released on 21 September 2005, which brought an end to a career at the club which lasted over ten years, during this time he made over 150 appearances for the club scoring many crucial goals both domestically and in European competitions. ( He played 153 games (26 goals, five assists) with the club in all competitions).

===Mallorca===
Although rumored to go to Birmingham City, Everton, AEK Athens and Olympiacos during the 2006 winter transfer window, Basinas signed a contract with Mallorca preferring to leave Greece and join the Spanish Primera División.

In the second half of the 2005–06 season, Basinas completed a successful first period at Mallorca, helping to save the team from relegation proving a key part of the struggling team&#x27;s survival.
In his second year at the club he helped the team to finish in seventh position, one point from European qualification.

He was released by Mallorca on 1 July 2008 after his -year contract came to an end. He played 81 games (one goal, one assist) with the club in all competitions.

===AEK Athens===
On 31 July 2008, Basinas signed a three-year contract of €1.4 million per annum with AEK Athens, choosing the number 14. Despite the pre-season odds, AEK underachieved during the first half of the season and lost the title race too early, making Basinas favourable towards a new move during the winter transfer period.

===Portsmouth===
On 2 February 2009, Portsmouth confirmed the signing of Basinas on an eighteen-month contract. He made his debut for Portsmouth on 7 February 2009 against Liverpool. Just a few hours after his debut, manager Tony Adams, who brought Basinas in, was sacked by the club and replaced by Paul Hart. Under the new manager, Basinas hardly played and was benched for the rest of the season after only making three appearances for Portsmouth. Despite little playing time in his first season at Portsmouth, Basinas stated that he wanted to stay at the club. When Avram Grant became the manager of the club, Basinas had continued to impress for Portsmouth when called upon and a poll among Portsmouth fans on 23 January 2010, showed that he&#x27;s appreciated by the fans. 77% of fans believe that &quot;Basinas has the creative touch and must play&quot;, while only 2% believed he should leave the club. With Portsmouth Basinas reached the 2010 FA Cup Final against Chelsea of Carlo Ancelotti, but he was left out of the matchday squad.

===Arles-Avignon===
In the summer 2010, Basinas moved to Arles, with his teammate Angelos Charisteas, in the Ligue 1. He made his debut on 21 August 2010 in a 2–1 away defeat against Toulouse. Basinas made a total of five appearances in Ligue 1 and French Cup. The contract was broken two months later.

==International career==
Basinas won his first cap in a 3–1 win over El Salvador on 18 August 1999 and scored his first goal in just his second match, also against El Salvador just two days later. He remained a part of the national team setup since his debut and was a regular after Otto Rehhagel took over in 2001.

He was a key player in Greece&#x27;s upset Euro 2004 victory, scoring a penalty in his country&#x27;s 2–1 upset win over host team Portugal in the tournament&#x27;s opening game. Basinas was a vital player in the hard-working midfield of the Greek team throughout the tournament. In the final, Charisteas scored the winning goal for Greece against Portugal off a corner kick by Basinas, which saw Greece win the trophy.

After Theodoros Zagorakis retired, Basinas was selected to take the captain&#x27;s arm band. Basinas earned his 100th cap for Greece 1 April 2009 in a FIFA World Cup 2010 qualifier against Israel. At the time, he was only the second Greek player to achieve 100 national team appearances alongside Theodoros Zagorakis.

<text>William Dennison Stephens (December 26, 1859 – April 25, 1944) was an American federal and state politician. A three-term member of the U.S. House of Representatives from 1911 to 1916, Stephens was the 24th governor of California from 1917 to 1923. Prior to becoming Governor, Stephens served as the 27th lieutenant governor of California from 1916 to 1917, due to the death of John Morton Eshleman, and served a brief time as Mayor of Los Angeles in 1909 due to the resignation of Arthur C. Harper. He served as the 27th Mayor of Los Angeles in 1909.

As governor, he was a Progressive who kept the reforms of his predecessor, Hiram Johnson, and remained visible throughout his governorship. He lost a bid for re-nomination in 1922 to California State Treasurer Friend William Richardson, who campaigned as a conservative.

==Early life and career==
Stephens was born in Eaton, Ohio, on December 26, 1859. He was the third child out of a total of nine children born to Martin and Alvira Stephens. With ambitions to become a lawyer, Stephens studied earnestly in law to become a lawyer, yet family fortunes required all of his earnings to go to his family instead.

Following his graduation from Eaton High School in 1876, Stephens had worked for three years as a school teacher before joining the railroad business to become an engineer. Between 1880 and 1887, Stephens helped survey the construction of railroads in Ohio, Indiana, Iowa and Louisiana. His days in the railroads came to an end in 1887 when his mother, Alvira, now falling ill, sought a hot and drier climate to improve her health. The Stephens family, including William, relocated to Los Angeles that year, though Alvira would be dead within a year.

After relocating to Los Angeles, Stephens began to work as a traveling salesman and later as a grocery manager. In 1891, Stephens married Flora E. Rawson (1869–1931). In 1902, he became a partner in Carr and Stephens Groceries, giving Stephens wide name recognition throughout Los Angeles. Increasingly, Stephens became involved in business and municipal politics, serving on the board of directors of the Los Angeles Chamber of Commerce from 1902 to 1911, as well as being elected to the Los Angeles Board of Education from 1906 to 1907. Stephens further served on the Los Angeles Board of Water Commissioners, working alongside William Mulholland in an advisory committee for the construction of the Los Angeles Aqueduct.

In 1906, Stephens served briefly as a major in the California Army National Guard during the San Francisco earthquake as part of the First Brigade. In 1909, he became vice president of the American National Bank.
Following Los Angeles Mayor Arthur C. Harper&#x27;s resignation from office shortly before a crucial recall election, Stephens was appointed to replace Harper on March 15, 1909, becoming the city&#x27;s 27th mayor. Stephens&#x27; mayoralty lasted for less than two weeks before George Alexander, the winner of the election, assumed the office.

After his brief stint as mayor of Los Angeles, Stephens entered the realm of federal politics. In 1910, Stephens was elected as a Republican to the U.S. House of Representatives from the 7th district, after defeating his fellow Republican, incumbent James McLachlan, in the primary. Due to redistricting, Stephens changed constituencies to the newly created 10th district for the 1912 election, which he also won. During this period, Stephens increasingly identified himself as a member of the Progressive movement, becoming a member of the Progressive Party, led by former president Theodore Roosevelt and California Governor Hiram Johnson. Stephens was one of 13 Progressives to be elected to the U.S. House in the 1910s; four of them (including himself) came from California. He successfully defended his seat again in 1914, winning a third term in the House. Stephens would continue as a member of the Progressive Party until its dissolution in 1916, when he rejoined the Republican Party.

Following Lieutenant Governor John Morton Eshleman&#x27;s death from tuberculosis on February 28, 1916, Governor Hiram Johnson sought a replacement for his subordinate. By mid-year, Johnson had selected Stephens as Eshleman&#x27;s successor, forcing him to resign his U.S. House seat and assume the position of lieutenant governor on July 22.

Stephens&#x27; tenure as lieutenant governor was short-lived. Governor Johnson was elected to the U.S. Senate in November, 1916, leaving the governorship to his recently installed lieutenant governor. Johnson submitted his resignation to take his Senate seat on March 15, 1917, with Stephens succeeding him to become California&#x27;s 24th governor.

==Governorship==
Nearly immediately, Stephens faced controversy regarding the Preparedness Day Bombing, a terrorist attack on the San Francisco Preparedness Day parade on July 22, 1916 (the day Stephens had become lieutenant governor). The attack was blamed on left wing radicals, in particular former Industrial Workers of the World member Thomas Mooney, and his alleged accomplice, Warren Billings. Both Mooney and Billings were convicted, though critics said later that the trial was conducted in a lynch mob atmosphere. Governor Stephens supported both convictions. However, international sympathy for Mooney quickly spread, making him one of the United States&#x27;s most famous political prisoners. There was national and international pressure on Stephens to intervene for Mooney. President Woodrow Wilson personally telegraphed Stephens to ask him to review the case against Mooney. Stephens yielded, but only slightly, commuting Mooney&#x27;s death sentence to life imprisonment.

Despite this slight clemency, militant labor radicals continued to pressure Stephens, resulting in threats, and eventually, actions of violence. On the evening of December 17, 1917, a dynamite bomb exploded at the foot of the Governor&#x27;s Mansion in Sacramento. Although Stephens was not injured, the explosion caused considerable damage to the kitchen. Radicals from the IWW were later blamed for the attack. In an unrelated threat, labor radicals also threatened to destroy both the California State Capitol and the Governor&#x27;s Mansion if a $50,000 ransom was not met.

Stephens responded to threats from labor radicals, and to subversion worries during World War I, with the 1919 California Criminal Syndicalism Act, targeting radical labor unionists and their advocacy of violent confrontation with state authorities. Despite numerous threats on his life and state property, Stephens refused to pardon Thomas Mooney for the remainder of his administration. Mooney was eventually pardoned by Democratic governor Culbert Olson in 1939.

A Progressive like his predecessor Hiram Johnson, Stephens chose not to expand on the reforms made by Johnson. Instead, Stephens sought to keep the electoral and bureaucratic reforms already put in place.

In the 1918 state general election, Stephens won renomination for the Republican Party, campaigning on a platform to solidify Progressive reforms within the state government. He easily won the election, trouncing independent and former Democratic nominee Theodore A. Bell by a 20% margin. Other candidates included Republican Mayor of San Francisco James Rolph, who appeared as a write-in candidate at 3%, and Henry H. Roser of the Socialist Party of America with 4.2%.

After his successful election to a full four-year term as governor, Stephens grew increasingly concerned over the needs of returning World War I veterans. Stephens argued that the state government had a mandate to provide benefits for returning veterans, such as government-sponsored retraining and funds to help re-employment. Through his advocacy, a veteran assistance program was established. During the same time period, Stephens also supported state and federal prohibition of alcohol.

Like his predecessor Hiram Johnson, Stephens remained highly suspicious of Asian immigration to California, especially from Japan, which he viewed as an increasingly belligerent nation. In 1919, Stephens openly urged the California State Legislature to enact stricter exclusion laws to restrict Japanese immigrants. He declared that the influx of Japanese was a threat not only to California but to the United States. Through the remainder of his governorship, Stephens sought the aid of other governors and public officials to restrict Japanese immigration. In part, some of his goals were realized by the federal Immigration Act of 1924.

Despite threats on his life, Stephens remained publicly visible throughout his governorship. He was part of the general welcoming committee when Edward, Prince of Wales, arrived aboard in San Diego Bay in 1920, during the future British monarch&#x27;s first visit to California. Stephens was also present when his daughter, Barbara (Mrs. Randolph T.) Zane, ceremonially launched the battleship &quot;&quot;.

During his governorship, Stephens realized his lifelong dream by passing the California Bar to become a lawyer.

In the final months of his governorship, Stephens vetoed bills that would deregulate state utilities, vowing to keep Johnson&#x27;s Progressive reforms.

In 1922, Stephens sought another term as governor. However, Republican ranks had grown decidedly more conservative since 1918. He lost the Republican gubernatorial primary to California State Treasurer Friend William Richardson.

==Later life==
After failing in his bid for renomination, Stephens returned to Los Angeles to establish a law practice. He would never again hold public office, though he remained active in public affairs.

He died on April 25, 1944, at Santa Fe Hospital in Los Angeles of a heart ailment. He was 84 years old. He is interred in Angelus-Rosedale Cemetery, Los Angeles.

<text>Kenneth Raymond Forssi (March 30, 1943 – January 5, 1998) was an American musician, best known as the original bass player in the band Love.

== Early life ==
He was born in Cleveland, Ohio, the older of two sons, along with brother Charles, born to Raymond B. and Lola G. Forssi. When he was about 9 years old, his family moved to Siesta Key, on the Florida west coast, and shortly thereafter to the nearby city of Sarasota. Ken Forssi attended Sarasota High School where he demonstrated considerable talent in engineering drawing. Several pen and ink drawings, of the multi-geared transmission of a helicopter and of a large jet aircraft engine, won local prizes, and he was encouraged to follow a career in that field. He also proved to be mechanically skilled as a teenager, working on both motorcycles and cars, sometimes as a paid part-time employee of local businesses. He was eventually employed as a draftsman at a large Sarasota aerospace engineering company.

Music was a modest part of his life then, but as his skill on the bass guitar increased, he was hired for a number of engagements with local groups.

Forssi was a good enough artist that he obtained a scholarship to the Art Center College of Design in Pasadena, California. Along with several Sarasota friends, he migrated to Anaheim, California in 1964, and began commuting to the school. At this time, his interest in music became much more intense. His natural ability was substantial, and he learned new techniques very rapidly. In fact, his ability was soon sufficient to earn a position as bass player in a late-period lineup of The Surfaris, a group that previously rose to brief fame with their first record &quot;Wipe Out&quot;, which according to &quot;The Illustrated Book of Rock Records&quot; is the number one surf hit of all time (based on record sales and chart positions).

== Love ==
Forssi continued to attend college and study art, using his earnings from The Surfaris&#x27; Japanese tour to rent an apartment closer to the school. He found a roommate, Alban &quot;Snoopy&quot; Pfisterer, who was also a student there. In 1965 he met Arthur Lee, who then had a band called Grass Roots (a name that was rapidly dropped under legal pressure from the better-known band of the same name) and was greatly impressed. Lee hired Forssi as bassist, and soon officially formed Love. Shortly thereafter, Snoopy Pfisterer could also be found with the group, as an occasional substitute drummer. Forssi was a true believer, along with many new fans, in the artistic talent of Lee, and in the quality of the band.

Love proved to be quite popular and successful in 1966–1968, especially in California, and Forssi was now a rock star. The band released three albums over a two-year period: (&quot;Love&quot;, &quot;Da Capo&quot;, and &quot;Forever Changes&quot;). Forssi&#x27;s work on some of these has been highly praised, particularly the hit, &quot;7 and 7 Is&quot;.

== After Love ==
The success of Love was short-lived though, and the original group broke up. For a time, his considerable talent as a bassist gained him studio session work and offers to join various other rock groups. He played briefly with a band called &quot;The Elves Themselves&quot; and worked on a record with Jimi Hendrix. During that time Forssi had no steady job. He never again reached any level of fame.

After the original members of Love scattered, Forssi moved back to Sarasota in the early 1970s, where he found fewer and fewer opportunities to use his musical talents. He mostly worked at various odd jobs over the years, his employment usually hampered by long-term substance-abuse problems which seem to have started during the years of fame.

During Forssi&#x27;s last years, he became very concerned about the possible existence of world political conspiracies. In the early 1990s he moved to the little town of Greenville, Florida, where his mother then lived. Forssi died in nearby Tallahassee on January 5, 1998, according to his &quot;Tallahassee Democrat&quot; obituary, due to a brain tumor.

<text>William V. Bell is an American politician and engineer who served as the mayor of Durham, North Carolina.

Formerly a senior engineer for IBM, Bell was first elected to the Durham County Board of Commissioners in 1972, where he served until 1994, and again from 1996 to 2000. He was the chairman of the Durham County Commissioners from 1982 to 1994. Bell was first elected mayor of Durham in 2001 and was subsequently re-elected seven more times.

Bell is currently Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer of UDI Community Development Corp., a non-profit organization. He is a member of the Mayors Against Illegal Guns Coalition, a bi-partisan group with a stated goal of &quot;making the public safer by getting illegal guns off the streets.&quot; The Coalition was co-founded by Boston Mayor Thomas Menino and New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg.

==2007 Mayor Re-election Campaign==

In 2007, Bell was challenged by Republican Thomas Stith, III. Thomas Stith attacked Bell over several city issues including violence. During the weekend of October 13 and October 14, two people were murdered in Durham. On October 15, Bell tried to calm the public about the murders, claiming the city was safe and the weekend murders were not random. The next day, Stith went after Bell, pointing out that Durham&#x27;s murder rate was up nearly 50 percent over the previous year. Stith and Bell continued to argue over how to deal with Durham crime. Stith consistently claimed that he would fight crime more consistently than Bell had, while Bell said that Stith had six years on the town council to do that. Stith said he wanted to see more police officers on the streets, while Bill Bell said the current police officers are well equipped.

In late October 2007, after lead was found in Durham drinking water, Stith sent out a campaign mailer that said in bold letters: &quot;Bill Bell knew and didn&#x27;t tell us our water was dangerous to drink.&quot; Bell responded to this by saying, &quot;That mailer sent out by Thomas Stith was a complete lie.&quot; Bell also said that Stith had no leadership experience.

Bell was re-elected in the November 6, 2007 election, getting 58% of the vote as opposed to Stith&#x27;s 42%.

==Controversy==
It was later revealed that Bell endorsed and donated money to now-disgraced, former district attorney Mike Nifong during his reelection campaign surrounding the 2006 Duke University lacrosse case.

<doc id="789596" wikidata="Q11704342" url="?curid=789596" title="Terra Branford">
<text>Terra Branford, known as in Japanese media, is a character in the &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; series and one of the main protagonists of &quot;Final Fantasy VI&quot;. Yoshitaka Amano and Tetsuya Nomura designed her for the main series installment, with Kazuko Shibuya designing her in-game sprites alongside the rest of the characters. She also appears in the spin-off fighting game series &quot;Dissidia Final Fantasy&quot; and the rhythm series &quot;Theatrhythm Final Fantasy&quot;. She has made small appearances in several other games in and outside the &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; series.

Terra is the 18-year-old daughter of a human mother and a father who is an Esper, a magical creature with the natural ability to use powerful magic. She was mentally enslaved by the evil Gestahlian Empire, who used her gifted powers to wage war on the empire&#x27;s neighboring countries. Several rebels rescue her at the beginning of &quot;Final Fantasy VI&quot;, and she decides to aid their campaign and protect those whose lives were affected by the Empire.

Developers, who initially planned Branford to be a young man, designed her character to start as a passive person in the first half of the game to show her growth throughout the story. Terra&#x27;s character has received widespread critical acclaim, with game journalists and fans alike praising her complexity and unique backstory. She has been on many lists of gamers&#x27; favorite &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; characters and is one of the most well-known video game characters to date.

==Conception and creation==
Developers initially conceived of the character that would become Terra Branford as a half-esper young man in his early 20s. He was to be a partner and rival of the dark, mysterious Locke Cole. The character&#x27;s design changed over time, however, to that of an eighteen-year-old half-esper woman. Character designer Yoshitaka Amano initially created the concept art for Terra, while Tetsuya Nomura, one of the game&#x27;s graphic directors, redesigned her in chibi form for her representation in the game. Her in-game sprites were designed by Kazuko Shibuya, based on their artwork. While in the concept art she is blonde, Shibuya insisted it be changed to emerald green, worrying that blonde hair would not work well with her design on screen. In a 2006 interview, Amano said that Terra was his favorite video game character to design.

The developers intended for the game to have an ensemble cast with no unique protagonist. For this reason, the second half of the game opens with another character, Celes Chere, instead of Terra, who opened the first. Another reason for this shift is that the team wanted Terra&#x27;s story arc to progress in a new direction after the first half. The game story made Terra a very passive character in the first half of the game to show her personal growth and strength as the story progressed. At the end of the game, Terra was initially going to die when magic left the world, but the development team decided that this would be &quot;excessive&quot; as she had finally discovered her humanity and let her live without her magic powers. Despite the lack of a main protagonist in &quot;Final Fantasy VI&quot;, Shibuya felt that Terra was in her eyes such, due to the heavy amount of art Amano drew of her.

Although the character&#x27;s name is &quot;Tina Branford&quot; in Japanese media, American playtesters &quot;hated the name Tina, almost to a person!&quot;, according to the game&#x27;s translator Ted Woolsey. For this reason, Woolsey renamed the character &quot;Terra&quot; in the North American English version of the game. While acknowledging that some might dislike the name change, he noted that the games he worked on &quot;were meant for a broader audience than the one which buys and plays Japanese imports&quot;, and those who know Japanese should play the original versions. In the game &quot;Dissidia Final Fantasy&quot;, Nomura chose Terra as the representative hero for &quot;Final Fantasy VI&quot;. He reasoned that without her, there would be no female hero character in the game&#x27;s roster. Nomura stated that &quot;based on [his] feelings&quot; from &quot;Final Fantasy VI&quot;″s production, he &quot;thought it had to be Terra&quot; as she appeared on the game&#x27;s cover art and advertisements. Gameplay-wise, Terra is Nomura&#x27;s favorite character in &quot;Dissidia Final Fantasy&quot;.

== Appearances ==
=== &quot;Final Fantasy VI&quot; ===
Terra is the first introduced character, a mentally-enslaved Imperial super-soldier who possesses destructive magic. She is made to participate in an armored assault on the town of Narshe, exterminating most of the town&#x27;s militia in pursuit of a recently unearthed magical creature which are known as Espers. Upon encountering the creature, her fellow soldiers are killed and her armor destroyed. She wakes up in the home of a man named Arvis, now free of her slave crown and suffering amnesia. Pursued into the depths of Narshe&#x27;s mines by Imperial forces, the thief Locke and a horde of moogles eventually rescue her. After events in Figaro kingdom and another Imperial invasion on Narshe to claim the Esper, she learns she is the daughter of an Esper father and human mother, explaining her magical abilities. Having been previously brain-washed and extensively trained, Terra realizes she was instrumental in the Empire&#x27;s conquest of the other city-states on the southern continent. She discovers that her power had caused the deaths of fifty Imperial troops in moments. Terra became a vital part of the revolutionary movement known as the &quot;Returners&quot;, whose strategy was to try and ally with the Espers, who live beyond the sealed gate, against the Empire. Terra succeeded in opening the barrier between worlds and unleashed the Espers&#x27; upon the Empire, leaving its capital in ruins.

In the game&#x27;s post-apocalyptic second half, Terra is found no longer wishing to fight. For the orphans of the town of Mobliz, she has become a mother figure. She fails to stop an attack on the town by a legendary demon known as Humbaba, requiring the players&#x27; party&#x27;s intervention to drive it away. Returning to the village later, the player finds her ready to stand up against Humbaba. She joins the player to defeat it and vows to make the world safe for children. At the game&#x27;s conclusion, Terra expects to fade from existence with the remaining Espers as magic leaves the world. Her fathers&#x27; spirit, however, tells her that she will not die because she is half-human.

=== Other appearances ===
Terra is the heroine representing &quot;Final Fantasy VI&quot; in &quot;&quot;, a crossover fighting game featuring different characters from the &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; series. She returns in &quot;Dissidia 012&quot; as a member of the evil Chaos army, and also appears in the next game, &quot;Dissidia NT&quot; with an alternate appearance featuring her green hair from &quot;Final Fantasy VI&quot;. Her character appears in the mobile title &quot;Dissidia Opera Omnia&quot;.

Terra is a playable character in &quot;Theatrhythm Final Fantasy&quot;, &quot;Final Fantasy Explorers&quot;, &quot;Airborne Brigade&quot;, and &quot;World of Final Fantasy&quot;, where she is voiced by Yukari Fukui. She is also one of the randomly purchasable &quot;Premium&quot; characters in &quot;Final Fantasy: All the Bravest&quot; and a collectible character in &quot;Record Keeper&quot; and &quot;Brave Exvius&quot;. &quot;Final Fantasy Tactics S&quot; briefly allowed Terra and other &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; characters to join their parties. Players can outfit their characters in Terra&#x27;s outfit in &quot;Gunslinger Stratos 2&quot;. Her character was included in the technical demo &quot;Final Fantasy VI: The Interactive CG Game&quot;. Merchandise items featuring the character such as gashapon figurines and full models have been produced.

== Reception ==
The character was very well received, especially among the Japanese fans of &quot;Final Fantasy&quot;. Though she does not form a couple with anyone in &quot;Final Fantasy VI&quot;, &quot;Terra and Edgar&quot; and &quot;Terra and Locke&quot; were popular fan wishes in polls of Japanese fans. That same year, she was ranked sixth in &quot;V Jump&quot;″s poll for the most popular characters in the &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; series. A 2013 poll by Square Enix saw that Terra was the sixth most popular &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; female character in Japan. In an article about &quot;Dissidia Final Fantasy&quot;, &quot;IGN&quot; editor Ryan Clements called her one of the most recognizable and well-loved characters to fight against evil alongside other &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; protagonists.

In 1996, &quot;Next Generation&quot; chose the scene of Terra learning to love again by taking care of orphaned children as the most memorable moment in the &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; series: &quot;It&#x27;s safe to say that no other game series has tackled such big issues, or reached such a level of emotional complexity. It truly is beautiful&quot;. In 2013, Gus Turner of &quot;Complex&quot; called her &quot;a physical embodiment of the clash of man and magic that has defined much of the [&quot;Final Fantasy&quot;] franchise&quot;, praising the multi-dimensional aspects of her character and personality, and noted that as the game progressed, &quot;we can&#x27;t help ourselves from attaching to her on an emotional level&quot;. That same year, Tom&#x27;s Guide&#x27;s Marshall Honorof described her as &quot;exactly what a maturing &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; series needed: a three-dimensional protagonist who is not a natural-born leader, but rather acquires compassion, focus and a genuine desire to make the world a better place&quot;, further arguing that she set a high standard for female protagonists that came afterward.

Terra has also been the subject of academic study. The book &quot;Japanese Culture Through Videogames&quot; praised the representation of her identity crisis as a character through the &quot;Morph&quot; ability in her gameplay, but noted that while she represented many of the game&#x27;s thematic elements it was harder to see her as the protagonist of the game, due to the presence of so many other characters. It further called her care for the children in Mobilz a turning point for her, in relation to her own experiences, and further used her as a baseline for comparison to characters with similar states in other franchises such as &quot;Tekken&quot;″s Jin Kazama. In the book &quot;The Legend of Final Fantasy VI&quot;, Pierre Maugein described Terra as initially portraying the archetypal &quot;frail, protected heroine who is led to her truth by men&quot;, citing a belief that Japanese ethos and culture played a big part in this aspect. He noted however that she was an analogue to Kefka&#x27;s reaction to societal rejection: where he sought to destroy, she utilized love and reconciliation. He further emphasized the importance of her being the character to force Kefka to justify his actions, adding that while some would not see her as the true protagonist of the game, she is just as essential for setting events in motion and the embodiment of transition from one era to another.

Dr. Kathryn Hemmann in an article for &quot;Kill Screen&quot; described her as a variation of the &#x27;magical girl&#x27; archetype of late-20th century Japanese pop culture through her &quot;Morph&quot; ability, and further argued that alongside Celes she represented the game exploring posthumanism themes. She further described them as the protagonists of the game, and in the context of so many works of science fiction focusing on male protagonists, &quot;the game&#x27;s narrative emphasis on Terra and Celes is striking&quot;. She lastly added that &quot;Terra and Celes are not characters to be consumed, but identities to be embraced and managed&quot;, feeling they represented in many ways the discussions of bioethics prominent in the 1990&#x27;s, and that &quot;humanity, in all its forms, can bravely continue on into an optimistic future&quot;.

<doc id="789597" wikidata="Q1154330" url="?curid=789597" title="Insurrection of 10 August 1792">
<text>The insurrection of 10 August 1792 was a defining event of the French Revolution, when armed revolutionaries in Paris, increasingly in conflict with the French monarchy, stormed the Tuileries Palace. The conflict led France to abolish the monarchy and establish a republic.

Conflict between King Louis XVI and the country&#x27;s new revolutionary Legislative Assembly increased through the spring and summer of 1792 as Louis vetoed radical measures voted upon by the Assembly. Tensions accelerated dramatically on 1 August when news reached Paris that the commander of the allied Prussian and Austrian armies had issued the Brunswick Manifesto, threatening &quot;unforgettable vengeance&quot; on Paris should harm be done to the French royal family. On 10 August, the National Guard of the Paris Commune and &quot;fédérés&quot; from Marseille and Brittany stormed the King&#x27;s residence in the Tuileries Palace in Paris, which was defended by the Swiss Guards. Hundreds of Swiss guardsmen and 400 revolutionaries were killed in the battle, and Louis and the royal family took shelter with the Legislative Assembly. The formal end of the monarchy occurred six weeks later on 21 September as one of the first acts of the new National Convention, which established a republic on the next day.

The insurrection and its outcomes are most commonly referred to by historians of the Revolution simply as &quot;the 10 August&quot;; other common designations include &quot;the day of the 10 August&quot; () or &quot;the Second Revolution&quot;.

==Background ==

On 20 April 1792, France declared war against the King of Bohemia and Hungary (Austria). The initial battles were a disaster for a French army partially disorganised by mutinies, emigration of officers, and political change. Prussia then joined Austria in active alliance against France, eventually declaring war on France on 13 June. The blame for these opening setbacks was put upon the King and his ministers (the Austrian Committee), and after upon the Girondin party.

The Legislative Assembly passed decrees sentencing any priest denounced by twenty citizens to immediate deportation (27 May), dissolving the King&#x27;s Constitutional Guard, incorrectly alleging that it was manned by aristocrats (29 May), and establishing in the vicinity of Paris a camp of 20,000 &quot;fédérés&quot; (8 June). The King vetoed the decrees and dismissed Girondists from the Ministry. When the King formed a new cabinet mostly of constitutional monarchists (&quot;Feuillants&quot;), this widened the breach between the King and the Assembly and the majority of the common people of Paris. These events happened on 16 June when Lafayette sent a letter to the Assembly, recommending suppression of &quot;anarchists&quot; and political clubs in the capital.

The King&#x27;s veto of the Legislative Assembly&#x27;s decrees was published on 19 June, one day before the third anniversary of the Tennis Court Oath, which had inaugurated the Revolution. The popular &quot;journée&quot; of 20 June 1792 was organized to put pressure on the King. Appearing before the crowd, the King put on the &quot;bonnet rouge&quot; of liberty and drank to the health of the nation, but refused to ratify decrees or to recall the ministers. The republican mayor of Paris, Jérôme Pétion de Villeneuve, was suspended by the Directory of the Seine &quot;département&quot; for having neglected to protect the Tuileries Palace on 20 June. On 28 June, General Lafayette left his post with the army and appeared before the Assembly to call on the deputies to dissolve the Jacobin Club and punish those who were responsible for the demonstration of 20 June. The deputies indicted the general for deserting his command. The King rejected all suggestions of escape from Lafayette, the man who had long presided over his imprisonment. The crowd burnt him in effigy at the Palais-Royal. There was no place for Lafayette beside the republican emblem, nor in the country which had adopted it. Within six weeks he was arrested whilst fleeing to England and placed in an Austrian prison. Lafayette failed because his views clashed with French national sentiment, and his passive leadership of French armies had given the Prussians time to finish their preparations and concentrate upon the Rhine undisturbed.

A decree of 2 July authorized National Guards, many of whom were already on their way to Paris, to come for the Federation ceremony. A decree of 5 July declared that in the event of danger to the nation all able-bodied men could be called to service and necessary arms requisitioned. Six days later the Assembly declared &quot;la patrie est en danger&quot; (the homeland is in danger). Banners were placed in the public squares, with the words:

==Toward crisis==
On 3 July Pierre Vergniaud gave a wider scope to the debate by uttering a threat against the King&#x27;s person: &quot;It is in the King&#x27;s name that the French princes have tried to rouse all the courts of Europe against the nation, it is to avenge the dignity of the King that the treaty of Pillnitz was concluded and the monstrous alliance formed between the Courts of Vienna and Berlin; it is to defend the King that we have seen what were formerly companies of the Gardes du Corps hurrying to join the standard of rebellion in Germany; it is to come to the assistance of the King that the &quot;émigrés&quot; are soliciting and obtaining employment in the Austrian army and preparing to stab their fatherland to the heart... it is in the name of the King that liberty is being attacked... yet I read in the Constitution, chapter II, section i, article 6: &quot;If the king place himself at the head of an army and turn its forces against the nation, or if he do not explicitly manifest his opposition to any such enterprise carried out in his name, he shall be considered to have abdicated his royal office.&quot;&quot; Vergniaud recalled the royal veto, the disorders it had caused in the provinces, and the deliberate inaction of the generals who had opened the way to invasion; and he implied it to the Assembly that Louis XVI came within the scope of this article of the Constitution. By this means he put the idea of deposing the King into the minds of the public. His speech was circulated by the Assembly through all the departments.

Evading the royal veto on an armed camp, the Assembly had invited National Guards from the provinces, on their way to the front, to come to Paris, ostensibly for 14 July celebrations. By mid-July the &quot;fédérés&quot; were petitioning the Assembly to dethrone the king. The &quot;fédérés&quot; were reluctant to leave Paris before a decisive blow had been struck, and the arrival on 25 July of 300 from Brest and five days later of 500 Marseillais, who made the streets of Paris echo with the song to which they gave their name, provided the revolutionaries with a formidable force.

The &quot;fédérés&quot; set up a central committee and a secret directory that included some of the Parisian leaders and to assure direct contact with the sections. A coordinating committee had been formed of one federal from each department. Within this body soon appeared a secret committee of five members. Vaugeois of Blois, Debesse of The Drome, Guillaume of Caen, and Simon of Strasbourg were names nearly unknown to history: but they were the creators of a movement that shook France. They met at Maurice Duplay&#x27;s house in the Rue Saint-Honoré, where Robespierre had his lodgings, in a room occupied by their fifth member, Antoine, the mayor of Metz. They conferred with a group of section leaders hardly better known than themselves—the journalists Carra and Gorsas, and of the &quot;Faubourg Saint-Marceau&quot;, Fournier &quot;the American&quot;, Westermann (the only soldier among them), the baker Garin, Anaxagore Chaumette and Antoine Santerre of the Faubourg Saint-Antoine. Daily meetings were held by the individual sections, and on 25 July the assembly authorized continuous sessions for them. On the 27th Pétion, who had been reinstated as Paris mayor by the Assembly on 13 July, permitted a &quot;correspondence office&quot; to be set up in the &quot;Hôtel de Ville&quot;. Not all sections opposed the King, but passive citizens joined them, and on the 30th the section of the &quot;Théâtre Français&quot; gave all its members the right to vote. At the section meetings, Jacobins and &quot;sans-culottes&quot; clashed with moderates and gradually gained the upper hand. On 30 July a decree admitted passive citizens to the National Guard.

On 1 August came news of a manifesto signed by the Duke of Brunswick, threatening as it did summary justice on the people of Paris if Louis and his family were harmed: &quot;they will wreak an exemplary and forever memorable vengeance, by giving up the city of Paris to a military execution, and total destruction, and the rebels guilty of assassinations, to the execution that they have merited.&quot; This Brunswick Manifesto became known in Paris on 1 August and heated the republican spirit to revolutionary fury.

Insurrection threatened to break out on the 26 July, again on the 30 July. It was postponed both times through the efforts of Pétion, who was to present the section petitions to the Assembly on 3 August. On 4 August, the section of the Quinze-Vingts, the Faubourg Saint-Antoine, gave the Legislative assembly an ultimatum: until 9 August to prove itself. Of the forty-eight sections of Paris, all but one concurred. Pétion informed the Legislative Assembly that the sections had &quot;resumed their sovereignty&quot; and that he had no power over the people other than that of persuasion. On 9 August the Assembly refused to indict Lafayette. That night the tocsin rang.

==Insurrection==
Throughout the night of 9 August, the sections sat in consultation. At 11 o&#x27;clock the &quot;Quinze-Vingts&quot; section proposed that each section should appoint three of its members onto a body with instructions &quot;to recommend immediate steps to save the state&quot; (&quot;sauver la chose publique&quot;). During the night 28 sections answered this invitation. Their representatives constituted the Insurrectional Commune. Carra and Chaumette went to the barracks of the Marseilles &quot;fédérés&quot; in the section of the Cordeliers, while Santerre roused the &quot;Faubourg Saint-Antoine&quot;, and the &quot;Faubourg Saint-Marceau&quot;.

The municipality was already in session. From midnight until three o&#x27;clock the next morning the old and new, the legal and the insurrectional communes, sat in adjoining rooms at the Town Hall (&quot;Hôtel de Ville&quot;). The illegal body organized the attack on Tuileries. The legal body, by recalling the officer in charge of the troops at the Tuileries, disorganized its defense. Between six and seven in the morning this farcical situation was brought to an end. The Insurrectional Commune informed the municipal body, in a formally worded resolution, that they had decided upon its suspension; but they would retain the mayor (Pétion), the prosecutor (Manuel), the &quot;deputy-prosecutor&quot; (Danton), and the administrators in their executive functions. The resolution stated that &quot;When the People puts itself into a state of insurrection, it withdraws all powers and takes it to itself.&quot;

===Tuileries defenses===
The King had failed to buy off the popular leaders. According to Malouet, 37,000 livres had been paid to Pétion and Santerre for worthless promises to stop the insurrection. He rejected the last-minute advice, not only of Vergniaud and Guadet, now alarmed by a turn of affairs they brought about and also of his loyal old minister Malesherbes, to abdicate the throne. He was determined to defend the Tuileries. His supporters had anticipated and prepared for the attack long beforehand, and were confident of success. A plan of defense, drawn up by a professional soldier, had been adopted by the Paris department on 25 June: for it was their official duty to safeguard the Executive Power. The palace was easy to defend. It was garrisoned by the only regular troops on either side—950 veteran Swiss mercenaries of the Swiss Guards brought in from their barracks on the outskirts of Paris during the night of 9–10 August. The Swiss were backed by 930 &quot;gendarmes&quot;, 2,000 national guards, and 200–300 &quot;Chevaliers de Saint Louis&quot;, and other royalist volunteers. Five thousand men should have been an ample defense; though it appears that, by some oversight, they were seriously short of ammunition. Police spies reported to the commune that underground passages had been constructed by which additional troops could be secretly introduced from their barracks. Mandat, the commander of the National Guard, was not very sure of his forces, but the tone of his orders was so resolute that it seemed to steady the troops. He had stationed some troops on the Pont Neuf so as to prevent a junction between the insurgents on the two sides of the river, which could prevent any combined movement on their part.

===Dislocation of the defense===
Pétion, the mayor of Paris, Roederer the prosecutor of the Paris department, and Mandat, the commander of the National Guard and the officer in charge of the troops detailed for the defense of the Tuileries. Pétion professed that he had to come to defend the royal family; but at about 2 a.m., hearing himself threatened by a group of royalist gunners, he obeyed summons to the Parliament-house, reported that all precautions had been taken to keep the peace, and retired to the &quot;Mairie&quot;, where he was confined on the orders of the Insurrectional Commune. Roederer&#x27;s first act was to assure the royal family that there would be no attack. His second act, when a series of bulletins from Blondel, the secretary of the department, made it clear that an attack was imminent, was to persuade Louis to abandon the defense of the palace and to put himself under the protection of the assembly. Mandat, after seeing to the defense of the palace, was persuaded by Roederer (in the third and fatal mistake of the Tuileries defense) to obey a treacherous summons from the Town Hall. Mandat knew nothing of the formation of the Insurrectional Commune, and thus he departed without any escort. He was put under arrest, and shortly after murdered. His command was transferred to Santerre.

At about 7 a.m. the head of the federal column was seen debouching on the back of the palace, there was no one to order the defense. Louis, sleepily reviewing his garrison, &quot;in full dress, with his sword at his side, but with the powder falling out his hair,&quot; was greeted by some of the National Guards with cries of &quot;&quot;Vive la nation!&quot; and &quot;A bas le véto!&quot;&quot;. Louis made no reply and went back to the Tuileries. Behind him, quarrels were breaking out in the ranks. The gunners declared they would not fire on their brethren.

Hating violence, and dreading bloodshed, Louis listened willingly to Roederer&#x27;s suggestion that he should abandon the defense of the palace. The Queen urged in vain that they should stay and fight. Before even a single shot had been fired, the royal family were in retreat across the gardens to the door of the Assembly. &quot;Gentlemen,&quot; said the King, &quot;I come here to avoid a great crime; I think I cannot be safer than with you.&quot; &quot;Sire,&quot; replied Vergniaud, who filled the chair, &quot;you may rely on the firmness of the national assembly. Its members have sworn to die in maintaining the rights of the people, and the constituted authorities.&quot; The King then took his seat next to the president. But François Chabot reminded him that the assembly could not deliberate in the presence of the King, and Louis retired with his family and ministers into the reporter&#x27;s box behind the president. There, the King was given a seat and he listened, with his customary air of bland indifference, whilst the deputies discussed his fate. The Queen sat at the bar of the House, with the Dauphin on her knees.

===Assault on the Tuileries===
The incentive for resistance fell away with the King&#x27;s departure. The means of defense had been diminished by the departure of a detachment of National Guardsmen who escorted the royal family to the National Assembly. The &quot;gendarmerie&quot; left their posts, crying &quot;Vive la nation!&quot;, and the National Guard&#x27;s inclination began to move towards the insurgents. On the right bank of the river, the battalions of the &quot;Faubourg Saint-Antoine&quot;, and, on the left, those of the &quot;Faubourg Saint-Marcel&quot;, the Bretons, and the Marseilles &quot;fédérés&quot;, marched forth as freely as if going to parade. At many places that had been ordered guarded, no resistance was put up at all, like at the Arcade Saint-Jean, the passages of the bridges, alongside the quays, and in the court of the Louvre. An advance guard consisting of men, women, and children, all armed with cutters, cudgels, and pikes, spread over the abandoned Carrousel, and around eight o&#x27;clock the advance column, led by Westermann, was in front of the palace.

The assault on the palace began at eight o&#x27;clock in the morning. As per the King&#x27;s orders, the regulars of the Swiss Guard had retired into the interior of the building, and the defense of the courtyard had been left to the National Guard. The Marseillais rushed in, fraternized with the gunners of the National Guard, reached the vestibule, ascended the grand staircase, and called on the Swiss Guard to surrender. &quot;Surrender to the Nation!&quot;, shouted Westermann in German. &quot;We should think ourselves dishonored!&quot; was the reply. &quot;We are Swiss, the Swiss do not part with their arms but with their lives. We think that we do not merit such an insult. If the regiment is no longer wanted, let it be legally discharged. But we will not leave our post, nor will we let our arms be taken from us.&quot;

The Swiss filled the windows of the château and stood motionless. The two bodies confronted each other for some time, without either of them making a definitive move. A few of the assailants advanced amicably, and, in what was taken by the revolutionaries to be a gesture of encouragement, some of the Swiss threw some cartridges from the windows as a token of peace. The insurgents penetrated as far as the vestibule, where they were met by a less friendly group of Swiss defenders of the palace, commanded by officers of the Court. The two bodies of troops remained facing each other on the staircase for forty-five minutes. A barrier separated them, and there the combat began; it is unknown which side took the initiative. The Swiss, firing from above, cleaned out the vestibule and the courts, rushed down into the square and seized the cannon; the insurgents scattered out of range. The Marseillais, nevertheless, rallied behind the entrances of the houses on the Carrousel, threw cartridges into the courts of the small buildings and set them on fire. Then the Swiss attacked, stepped over the corpses, seized the cannon, recovered possession of the royal entrance, crossed the Place du Carrousel, and even carried off the guns drawn up there. As at the Storming of the Bastille, the cry of &quot;Treachery!&quot; went up. The attackers assumed that they had been drawn into a deliberate ambush and henceforth the Swiss were the subject of violent hatred on the part of &quot;sans-culottes&quot;.

At that moment the battalions of the &quot;Faubourg Saint-Antoine&quot; arrived, and the reinforced insurgents pushed the Swiss back into the palace. Louis, hearing from the &quot;manége&quot; the sound of firing, wrote on a scrap of paper: &quot;The King orders the Swiss to lay down their arms at once, and to retire to their barracks.&quot; To obey this order in the midst of heavy fighting meant almost certain death and the Swiss officers in command did not immediately act upon it. However, the position of the Swiss Guard soon became untenable as their ammunition ran low and casualties mounted. The King&#x27;s note was then produced and the defenders were ordered to disengage. The main body of Swiss Guards fell back through the palace and retreated under fire through the Tuileries Garden at the rear of the building. They were brought to a halt near the central Round Pond, broken into smaller groups and slaughtered. Some sought sanctuary in the Parliament House: about sixty were surrounded, taken as prisoners to the Hôtel de Ville, and put to death by the crowd there, beneath the statue of Louis XIV.

The victims of the massacre also included some of the male courtiers and members of the palace staff, although being less conspicuous than the red-coated Swiss Guards others were able to escape. No female members of the court seem to have been killed during the massacre. According to Jeanne-Louise-Henriette Campan, after the royal family left the palace only in the company of Princess de Lamballe and Madame de Tourzel, the remaining ladies-in-waiting were gathered in a room in the queen&#x27;s apartment, and when they were spotted, a man prevented an attack upon them by exclaiming, in the name of Pétion: &quot;Spare the women! Don&#x27;t disgrace the nation!&quot; As the queen&#x27;s entire household was gathered in her apartment, this may also have included female servants. Campan also mentioned two maids outside of this room, neither of whom was killed despite a male member of the staff being murdered beside them. The ladies-in-waiting were, according to Campan, &quot;escorted to prison.&quot; This is more or less confirmed in the memoirs of Pauline de Tourzel, who states that when the mob entered the chamber where the ladies-in-waiting were gathered, the Princesse de Tarente approached one of the rebels and asked for his protection for her colleagues Madame de Ginestous and Pauline de Tourzel, upon which he replied: &quot;We do not fight with women; go, all of you, if you choose&quot;. Following this example, the rest of the ladies-in-waiting departed the palace in about the same way, and all passed safely out.

The total losses on the King&#x27;s side were perhaps eight hundred. Out of the nine hundred Swiss on duty at the palace only about three hundred survived the fighting, and of these an estimated two hundred either died of their wounds in prison or during the September Massacres that followed. A further three hundred Swiss Guards had been sent to Normandy to escort grain convoys a few days before 10 August and escaped the massacre. The commander of all Swiss mercenaries in French service, Louis-Auguste-Augustin d&#x27;Affry, who had been absent on 10 August due to illness, reported on 12 November that about 300 Swiss guardsmen had been killed at the Tuileries. On the side of the insurgents, three hundred and seventy-six were either killed or wounded. Eighty-three of these were &quot;fédérés&quot;, and two hundred and eighty-five members of these were the National Guard: common citizens from every branch of the trading and working classes of Paris, including hair-dressers, harness-makers, carpenters, joiners, house-painters, tailors, hatters, boot-makers, locksmiths, laundry-men, and domestic servants. Two female combatants were among the wounded.

==Aftermath==
The crisis of the summer of 1792 was a major turning-point of the Revolution. By overthrowing the monarchy, the popular movement had effectively issued a challenge to the whole of Europe; internally, the declaration of war and overthrow of the monarchy radicalized the Revolution. If the Revolution was to survive it would have to call on all of the nation&#x27;s reserves.

A second revolution had, indeed, occurred, ushering in universal suffrage for men and, in effect, a republic. However, it did not have the warm and virtually unanimous support that the nation had offered the first. Events since 1789 had brought difference and divisions: many had followed the refractory priests; of those who remained loyal to the revolution some criticized 10 August while others stood by, fearing the day&#x27;s aftermath. Those who had participated in the insurrection or who approved it were few in number, a minority resolved to crush counter-revolution by any means.

Among the Swiss Guards who survived the insurrection, up to 350 later enlisted in the Revolutionary Army of the First French Republic, while others joined the counter-revolutionaries in the War in the Vendée. In 1817, the Swiss Federal Diet awarded 389 of the survivors the commemorative medal &quot;Treue und Ehre&quot; (Loyalty and Honor).

===Legislative Assembly===
Over half of the Legislative Assembly&#x27;s members fled and on the evening 10 August only 284 deputies were in their seats. The Assembly looked on anxiously at the vicissitudes of the struggle. So long as the issue was doubtful, Louis XVI was treated like a king. As soon as the insurrection was definitely victorious, the Assembly announced the suspension of the King. The King was placed under a strong guard. The Assembly would have liked to assign him the Luxembourg Palace, but the insurgent Commune demanded that he should be taken to the Temple, a smaller prison, which would be easier to guard.

14 July had saved the Constitutional Assembly, 10 August passed sentence on the Legislative Assembly: the day&#x27;s victors intended to dissolve the Assembly and keep power in their own hands. But because the new Commune, composed of unknowns, hesitated to alarm the provinces, the Girondins were kept and the Revolution was mired in compromise. The Assembly remained for the time being but recognized the Commune, increased through elections to 288 members. The Assembly appointed a provisional Executive Council and put Gaspard Monge and Pierre Henri Hélène Marie Lebrun-Tondu on it, along with several former Girondin ministers. The Assembly voted that the Convention should be summoned and elected by universal suffrage to decide on the future organization of the State. One of its first acts was to abolish the monarchy.

===Social changes===
With the fall of the Tuileries, the face of Parisian society underwent an abrupt change. The August insurrection greatly increased sans-culotte influence in Paris. Whereas the old Commune had been predominantly middle class, the new one contained twice as many artisans as lawyers—and the latter were often obscure men, very different from the barristers of 1789. Moreover, the Commune itself was little more than &quot;a sort of federal parliament in a federal republic of 48 states&quot;. It had only a tenuous control over the Sections, which began practicing the direct democracy of Rousseau. &quot;Passive&quot; citizens were admitted to meetings, justices of the peace and police officers dismissed and the &quot;assemblée générale&quot; of the Section became, in some cases, a &quot;people&#x27;s court&quot;, while a new &quot;comité de surveillance&quot; hunted down counter-revolutionaries. For the Parisian nobility, it was 10 August 1792 rather than 14 July 1789 that marked the end of the ancien régime.

The victors of 10 August were concerned with establishing their dictatorship. The Commune silenced the opposition press, closed the toll gates, and seized a number of refractory priests and aristocratic notables. On 11 August the Legislative Assembly gave municipalities the authority to arrest suspects. The volunteers were preparing to leave to the front and the rumours spread rapidly that their departure was to be the signal for prisoners to stage an uprising. The wave of executions in prisons followed, what later was known as The September Massacres.

===War===
To convince the revolutionaries that the insurrection of 10 August had decided nothing, the Prussian army crossed the French frontier on the 16th. A week later the powerful fortress of Longwy fell so quickly that Vergniaud declared it to &quot;have been handed over to the enemy.&quot; By the end of the month the Prussians were at Verdun, the last fortress barring the road to Paris. In the capital, there was a well-justified belief that Verdun would offer no more than a token resistance. The war, which had appeared to bring the triumph of the Revolution, now seemed likely to lead it to disaster.

On 2 September the alarm gun was fired and drums beat the citizens to their Sections again. The City walls of Paris were plastered with recruiting posters whose opening sentence, &quot;To arms, citizens, the enemy is at our gates!&quot; was taken literally by many readers. In the Assembly, Danton concluded the most famous of all his speeches: &quot;De l&#x27;audace, encore de l&#x27;audace, toujours de l&#x27;audace, et la France est sauvée!&quot; (&quot;Audacity, and yet more audacity, and always audacity, and France will be saved!&quot;) Once more the sans-culottes responded and in the next three weeks, 20,000 marched from Paris for the defense of the Revolution.

<doc id="789598" wikidata="Q7794208" url="?curid=789598" title="Thomas Stith III">
<text>Thomas A. Stith III is a North Carolina political figure. Stith was a member of the city council of Durham, North Carolina from 1999 to 2007. More recently, he has served as Program Director for Economic Development at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill&#x27;s Frank Hawkins Kenan Institute of Private Enterprise, and then as North Carolina district director for the federal Small Business Administration. In December 2020, Stith was selected as the next president of the North Carolina Community College System.

==Political career==
An alumnus of North Carolina Central University, Stith worked for the conservative John William Pope Civitas Institute. He was first elected to the Durham City Council in 1999 and re-elected in 2001 and 2003, holding one of the at-large seats on the council.

Stith unsuccessfully campaigned for the Republican nomination for North Carolina Lieutenant Governor in the 2004 election cycle.

===2007 mayoral campaign===

Stith ran for mayor of Durham against incumbent Democrat Bill Bell in 2007. Stith attacked Bell over several city issues including violence. During the weekend of October 13 and October 14, two people were murdered in Durham. On October 15, Bill Bell tried to calm the public about the murders, claiming the city was safe and the weekend murders were not random. The next day, Stith went after Bell, pointing out that Durham&#x27;s murder rate was up nearly 50 percent over the previous year. Stith and Bell continued to argue over how to deal with Durham crime. Stith consistently claimed that he would fight crime more consistently than Bell had, while Bell said that Stith had six years on the town council to do that. Stith said he wanted to see more police officers on the streets, while Bell said the current police officers are well equipped.

In late October 2007, after lead was found in Durham drinking water, Stith sent out a campaign mailer that said in bold letters: &quot;Bill Bell knew and didn&#x27;t tell us our water was dangerous to drink.&quot; Mayor Bell responded to this by saying &quot;That mailer sent out by Thomas Stith was a complete lie.&quot; Mayor Bell also said that Stith had no leadership experience.

Stith lost to Bell in the election on November 6, 2007, garnering approximately 42% of the vote to Bell&#x27;s 58%. Stith&#x27;s at-large seat on the City Council was won by Farad Ali, marking the end of Stith&#x27;s stint as a council member.

===McCrory administration===
In 2012, Governor-elect Pat McCrory named Stith his transition director and he then served as the Governor&#x27;s Chief of Staff when McCrory assumed office in January 2013.

<text>John Gould Stephenson (March 1, 1828 – November 11, 1883) was an American physician and soldier who served as Librarian of Congress from 1861 to 1864. Born in Lancaster, New Hampshire, to a prominent merchant family, he attended the Dartmouth Medical College and Castleton Medical College, where he received his M.D in 1849. Stephenson moved to Terre Haute, Indiana, in the early 1850s, where he became active in the temperance movement and the nascent Republican Party. He campaigned for Abraham Lincoln in the 1859 Senate race in Illinois and the 1860 presidential election. He pursued an appointment as Librarian of Congress immediately following Lincoln&#x27;s election, possibly due to his brother&#x27;s work as a librarian in Cincinnati. After a lengthy pressure campaign from prominent Republicans, Lincoln appointed Stephenson as Librarian of Congress, replacing long-term incumbent John Silva Meehan despite opposition from the Joint Committee on the Library.

Believing the library had fallen into neglect under Meehan&#x27;s administration, Stephenson began a mass change of staff soon after taking office, firing all but one assistant. He hired journalist Ainsworth Rand Spofford, a friend of his brother, as assistant librarian in August 1861. Although never formally commissioned, Stephenson began serving in the Union Army soon after his appointment as Librarian of Congress. He briefly served as an acting naval surgeon to the 19th Indiana Infantry in 1861, before serving as an aide-de-camp in the Indiana militia, where he achieved the rank of colonel. In 1863, he served as the aide-de-camp of Solomon Meredith, commander of the Iron Brigade, and saw action at the battles of Chancellorsville and Gettysburg. He resigned as librarian for unclear reasons in December 1864, and was succeeded by Spofford. He served in various positions as a legal clerk during the 1870s, and was appointed as a medical examiner at the Bureau of Pensions in Washington in the early 1880s. He died after a period of illness and was buried in the Congressional Cemetery.

== Early life and career ==
On March 1, 1828, John Gould Stephenson was born in Lancaster, New Hampshire, to Reuben and Mary King Stephenson (), the fourth of eight children. Reuben Stephenson was a merchant who operated a general store in Lancaster, additionally serving as a selectman, county coroner, deputy sheriff, constable, fire warden, and high sheriff. Other members of the Stephenson family were elected to a variety of local civic positions. John Stephenson attended school at the Lancaster Academy, which his father had co-incorporated in 1828. Stephenson was active in theater at the academy, performing in a variety of plays. He initially pursued further education at Dartmouth Medical School before transferring to Castleton Medical College, where he received his Doctor of Medicine on November 23, 1849.

The 1850 census lists Stephenson as a physician in Lancaster, but it is unclear if he ever practiced medicine in the town. He likely moved to Terre Haute, Indiana, in 1851, where he worked as a physician and surgeon. While in Terre Haute, he became involved with the temperance movement, joining the local Sons of Temperance chapter, as well as with the nascent Republican Party. He campaigned on behalf of Abraham Lincoln in the 1859 Senate race in Illinois against Stephen Douglas, where Stephenson was described as an &quot;efficient speaker&quot; by Indiana politician William P. Dole.

Stephenson was one of Lincoln&#x27;s earliest advocates for the 1860 Republican National Convention in Chicago, writing in support of his candidacy in March 1860. At the convention, he worked to influence the Kentucky delegation into supporting Lincoln. He campaigned for Lincoln in both Indiana and Illinois, writing that he spent several weeks campaigning for him in Clark County and Edgar County, Illinois.

== Librarian of Congress ==

=== Appointment ===

Shortly after Lincoln&#x27;s victory in the presidential election, Stephenson began to pursue a political appointment as the librarian of Congress, using connections within the Republican Party. His brother, Reuben Henry Stephenson, worked as the librarian of the Young Men&#x27;s Mercantile Library of Cincinnati, and this may have influenced him to pursue the position. Many testimonials in favor of appointing Stephenson to the position were sent to Lincoln, beginning within a few weeks after the election. Various figures, including local physicians and a Kentucky Republican convention delegate, wrote to Lincoln, emphasizing Stephenson&#x27;s service to the Republican Party and the Lincoln campaign. In March 1861, Senator Henry S. Lane wrote to Lincoln in support, stating that Stephenson was a &quot;gentleman of fine education&quot; and that his appointment would &quot;give great pleasure to the Republicans of his neighborhood&quot;. At least one other candidate, Hezekiah Lord Hosmer, ran for the position.

Stephenson arrived in Washington, D.C., at some point before May 1861 and wrote a letter to Lincoln asking to be appointed, urging haste so as to become acquainted with the library before the opening of the next session of Congress. Dole, Lincoln&#x27;s Commissioner of Indian Affairs, described meeting with Lincoln to urge Stephenson&#x27;s appointment:

The incumbent librarian, John Silva Meehan, had held the position since 1829. Meehan&#x27;s longtime ally and associate James Pearce&#x27;s lack of clear support for the Union following the secession of the Southern states significantly impacted his political influence. Although publicly apolitical, Meehan himself faced rumors of Southern sympathies. Librarian of Congress Ainsworth Rand Spofford attributed Meehan&#x27;s age and period of service as the primary factor for his replacement, writing that he had become &quot;a very ancient fossil&quot;. Pearce urged the president not to replace Meehan, gaining support from the other two senators of the Congressional Joint Committee on the Library. Despite this, Lincoln asked Secretary of State William H. Seward to send him a commission for Stephenson on May 23, with Stephenson accepting the following day, becoming the fifth librarian of Congress. Meehan calmly accepted his dismissal and left his duties at the end of May.

=== Tenure ===
In the months after assuming office, Stephenson became irritated with the state of the library, viewing it as having fallen into disrepair and neglect under his predecessor. He threw out what he deemed low-quality books and initiated a mass change of staff, firing all assistants except Meehan&#x27;s son, Law Library head C.H. Wharton Meehan. The rapid change of staff alarmed the members of the Joint Committee. Pearce believed Stephenson had gone beyond his authority, especially in the disposal of books, but noted that the Joint Committee was largely powerless to stop him. Lincoln was confused by the change of staff, and asked Caleb B. Smith if Stephenson had resigned. Stephenson defended his actions to the Joint Committee, stating in the annual report that the firing of the previous staff was because &quot;his conviction, induced by several months of trial and observation, as well as by the facts as to the condition of the Library already recited, of their incapacity for their several posts.&quot;

Stephenson was infuriated by the presence of the War Department&#x27;s bakeries in the Capitol basement during the Civil War, installed to feed troops stationed nearby. Smoke and soot from the ovens drifted up into the Library of Congress, staining books and tables. The bakeries also disabled the library&#x27;s heating systems during operation, as a flue for the baking operation had been built inside the preexisting flue used by the library&#x27;s furnace. Senator Solomon Foot rallied Senate members in favor of the removal of the bakeries, upset with smoke drifting into the Senate chambers. Representative Charles R. Train also advocated against the ovens, citing the damage to the Library of Congress, but the resolution failed in the House. They were not removed until October 1862, following a letter to Lincoln from Stephenson and commissioner B.B. French.

==== Appointment of Spofford ====
Around the beginning of August 1861, Stephenson offered the position of assistant librarian to Ainsworth Rand Spofford, a war journalist who had begun to browse the Library of Congress when not writing. Stephenson&#x27;s brother, Reuben, had long been a close friend of Spofford, both being members of the Literary Club of Cincinnati. Spofford agreed after some deliberation, and began working in late September. Stephenson departed Washington the same day Spofford began work to care for wounded soldiers. He did not return for two months. Spofford held warm feelings towards him, writing that he was a &quot;thorough good fellow—liberal—high-minded—active—but with no special knowledge of books&quot;. Spofford and fellow assistant librarian Edward B. Stelle signed many of the library documents during the period. Library of Congress historian Lucy Salamanca described Stephenson&#x27;s appointment of Spofford as &quot;his single greatest contribution to the development of the library&quot;.

====Military service====
Due to the ongoing civil war, Stephenson began to spend extended periods in military service soon after his appointment as Librarian of Congress. Spofford noted that he &quot;devoted a large portion of his time&quot; to care for ill soldiers of the 19th Indiana Infantry Regiment in late September 1861, placed into a temporary hospital inside the Patent Office. Stephenson never enlisted or was formally commissioned into formal military, but served in a number of medical roles during the war. He reported that he briefly served as acting naval surgeon of the 19th Indiana Infantry Regiment in 1861. On January 10, 1862, Stephenson was commissioned into the Indiana Legion, the state militia, as an aide-de-camp, later achieving the rank of colonel. In 1863, he served as the aide-de-camp of Solomon Meredith, commander of the Iron Brigade of the Army of the Potomac, seeing action at Fitzhugh&#x27;s Crossing, Chancellorsville, and Gettysburg. He received a citation for his service at Gettysburg from Major General Abner Doubleday. Meredith wrote to Lincoln shortly after Gettysburg, recommending a promotion for Stephenson.

==== Resignation and legacy ====
For unclear reasons, Stephenson indicated an intention to resign in late 1864. Seeking to succeed him as librarian, Spofford began a lengthy letter-writing campaign, soliciting endorsements from every congressional representative and senator. Charles Lanman, former librarian of the House of Representatives, was also a candidate for the position. Stephenson announced his resignation on December 22, 1864, with Spofford officially succeeding him on December 31. William Dawson Johnston, writing in 1904, attributed Stephenson&#x27;s resignation to his engagement in &quot;speculations created by the War&quot;, but no firm evidence has emerged corroborating the claim. In 1872, the library&#x27;s former London agent, was awarded $1,480 by Congress after he was found to have been &quot;unjustly defrauded by the conduct of the Librarian&quot; in 1863; this may have been related to Stephenson&#x27;s financial speculations. 

Stephenson&#x27;s short tenure as librarian was mainly occupied by his military service, with little direct contribution to the library and its policies. Twentieth-century librarian Keyes Metcalf described him as the last representative of an era of highly political appointees to the Library of Congress, writing that his appointment of Spofford was his &quot;chief claim to fame&quot; due to the latter&#x27;s reforms to the library. Historian David C. Mearns described Stephenson&#x27;s tenure as &quot;difficult to appraise&quot;, but noted the library taking a diminished role during the Civil War, whether from Stephenson&#x27;s absences or merely the war itself.

== Later life and death ==
Little information is known about Stephenson&#x27;s later life. He stated that he was employed &quot;in various capacities as a clerk not in service of the United States&quot; between 1865 and 1880, although the exact location or locations of his residence during this time is unknown. He may have stayed in Washington, D.C., or temporarily returned to Indiana. At some point, he served as a clerk to the District of Columbia Legislative Assembly. He is recorded as a resident of Washington, D.C., in the 1870 census, in a 1871 edition of &quot;Boyd&#x27;s Directory&quot;, and in two 1877 court cases revolving around a furniture ownership dispute. In April 1880, Captain Albert Grant wrote to Alexander Ramsey, the Secretary of War, forwarding Stephenson&#x27;s request to be appointed as a clerk within the Office of the Surgeon General, and noting his services during the Civil War and his &quot;unwavering devotion to the Republican Party since its first organization&quot;. He was appointed to the Record and Pension Division of the Office in September 1880, and served until March 30, 1881, when he was discharged without a stated cause.

In either November 1881 or July 1883, Stephenson entered employment as a medical examiner in the Bureau of Pensions in Washington, D.C. In August 1883, he saw a physician for persistent insomnia, and by mid-October was too ill to continue work. Captain Grant invited Stephenson to stay at his home to recover, where he died on November 11, 1883. A medical examiner attributed his death to heart disease. Veterans of the First Army Corps organized his funeral at the Metropolitan Presbyterian Church, and he was buried at the Washington Congressional Cemetery.

<doc id="789610" wikidata="Q310505" url="?curid=789610" title="Aloysius Stepinac">
<text>Aloysius Viktor Stepinac (, 8 May 1898 – 10 February 1960) was a Croat prelate of the Catholic Church. Made a cardinal in 1953, Stepinac served as Archbishop of Zagreb from 1937 until his death, a period which included the fascist rule of the genocidal Ustaše regime with the support of the Axis powers from 1941 to 1945 during World War II. 

He was tried by the communist Yugoslav government after the war and convicted of treason and collaboration with the Ustaše regime. The trial was depicted in the West as a typical communist &quot;show trial&quot;, and was described by &quot;The New York Times&quot; as biased against Stepinac. However, John Van Antwerp Fine Jr. was of the opinion that the trial was &quot;carried out with proper legal procedure&quot;. In a verdict that polarized public opinion both in Yugoslavia and beyond, the Yugoslav authorities found him guilty on the charge of high treason (for collaboration with the Ustaše regime), as well as complicity in the forced conversions of Orthodox Serbs to Catholicism. Stepinac advised individual priests to admit Orthodox believers to the Catholic Church if their lives were in danger, such that this conversion had no validity, allowing them to return to their faith once the danger passed. Jozo Tomasevich notes that Stepinac and the Church were &quot;willing to cooperate with the regime&#x27;s forced conversions, provided the canonical rules were followed&quot;, when in fact the Ustaše ignored these rules, committing atrocities, including the mass killing of converts.

Stepinac was sentenced to 16 years in prison, but served only five at Lepoglava before being released, with his movements confined to his home district of Krašić. In 1953 he was elevated to the rank of cardinal by Pope Pius XII. He was unable to participate in the 1958 conclave due to government restrictions on his travel. On 10 February 1960, still confined to Krašić, Stepinac died of polycythemia, for which he had been receiving treatment for a number of years. On 3 October 1998, Pope John Paul II declared him a martyr and beatified him before 500,000 Croatians in Marija Bistrica near Zagreb.

His record during World War II, conviction for treason, and subsequent beatification remain controversial. Some point to Stepinac&#x27;s efforts to save individual Jews, while others note that his public support of the Nazi-puppet Independent State of Croatia gave it legitimacy, helping the Ustaše maintain power and commit genocides against Jews, Serbs and Roma. Criticism has also been levelled for Stepinac&#x27;s failure to speak out publicly against the genocide of the Serbs, against forced conversions and the killing of 157 Orthodox priests and 5 bishops, among other Ustaše crimes against Serbs. On 22 July 2016, the Zagreb County Court annulled his post-war conviction due to &quot;gross violations of current and former fundamental principles of substantive and procedural criminal law&quot;. Pope Francis invited Serbian prelates to participate in canonization investigations, but in 2017 a joint commission was only able to agree that&quot;[i]n the case of Cardinal Stepinac, the interpretations that were predominantly given by Catholic Croats and Orthodox Serbs remain divergent&quot;.

==Early life==
Alojzije Viktor Stepinac was born in Brezarić, a village in the district of Krašić in the Austro-Hungarian Kingdom of Croatia-Slavonia on 8 May 1898, to a wealthy viticulturalist, Josip Stepinac, and his second wife Barbara (). He was the fifth of nine children, and he had three more siblings from his father&#x27;s first marriage.

His mother, a devout Roman Catholic, prayed constantly that he would enter the priesthood. The family moved to Krašić in 1906, and Stepinac attended primary school there, then attended high school in Zagreb from 1909 to 1915, boarding at the Archdiocese of Zagreb orphanage. This was followed by study at the lycée of the archdiocese, as he was seriously considering taking holy orders, having sent in his application to the seminary at the age of 16.

He was conscripted into the Austro-Hungarian Army for service in World War I, and had to accelerate his studies and graduate ahead of schedule. Sent to a reserve officers school in Rijeka, after six months training he was sent to serve on the Italian Front in 1917 where he commanded Bosnian soldiers. In July 1918, he was captured by Italian forces who held him as a prisoner of war. His family was initially told that he had been killed, and a memorial service held in Krašić. A week after the service, his parents received a telegram from their son telling them he had been captured. He was held in various Italian prisoner-of-war camps until 6 December 1918.

After the formation of the State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs on 1 December 1918, he was no longer treated as an enemy soldier, and he volunteered for the Yugoslav Legion that had been engaged on the Salonika front. As the war had already ended, he was demobilized with the rank of second lieutenant and returned home in the spring of 1919.

After the war he enrolled at the Faculty of Agriculture at the University of Zagreb, but left it after only one semester and returned home to help his father in his vineyards. His father wanted him to marry, and in 1923 he was briefly engaged to a teacher, Marija Horvat, but the engagement was broken off. In 1922, Stepinac was part of the politically conservative Catholic &quot;Hrvatski orlovi&quot; (Croatian Eagles) youth sport organisation, and traveled to the mass games in Brno, Czechoslovakia. He was at the front of the group&#x27;s ceremonial procession, carrying the Croatian flag.

On 28 October 1924, at the age of 26, Stepinac entered the Collegium Germanicum et Hungaricum in Rome to study for the priesthood. During his studies there he befriended the future Austrian cardinal Franz König when the two played together on a volleyball team. Granted an American scholarship, he went on to study for doctorates in both theology and philosophy at the Pontifical Gregorian University. Along with Croatian, he was fluent in Italian, German and French.

He was ordained on 26 October 1930 by Archbishop Giuseppe Palica, Vicegerent of Rome, in a ceremony which also included the ordination of his eventual successor as Archbishop of Zagreb, Franjo Šeper. On 1 November, he said his first mass at the Basilica di Santa Maria Maggiore. Stepinac wanted to serve the common people, and wanted to be a parish priest.

He celebrated his first mass in his home parish of Krašić on 1 July 1931, but instead of being appointed to a parish he was appointed as liturgical master of ceremonies to the Archbishop of Zagreb Antun Bauer on 1 October. He also established the archdiocesan branch of the Catholic charity Caritas in December of that year, and initiated and edited the Caritas magazine. He also temporarily administered the parishes of Samobor and Sveti Ivan Zelina. By this time, Stepinac had become a strong Croatian nationalist, but was not active in Catholic Action or the politically conservative Croatian Catholic movement. He was considered &quot;conscientious and devoted to his work&quot;.

== Coadjutor archbishop ==
=== Appointment ===
Stepinac was appointed coadjutor bishop to Bauer on 28 May 1934 at the age of 36 years, having been a priest for only three-and-a-half years, being selected after all other candidates had been rejected. Both Pope Pius XI and King Alexander I of Yugoslavia agreed with his appointment, and although the king wanted to withdraw his assent after he received further information about Stepinac, he was dissuaded by Bauer. According to some sources, Stepinac was the fifth or even eighth candidate to be considered for the role, which brought with it the right to succeed Bauer. Stepinac&#x27;s decision to join the Yugoslav Legion in 1918 made him a more acceptable candidate to King Alexander.

According to Stepinac&#x27;s biographer, Friar Šimun Ćorić, Bauer asked Stepinac if he would give his formal consent to being named as Bauer&#x27;s successor, but after considering the issue for several days, Stepinac refused, saying that he considered himself unfit to be appointed as a bishop. In this version of events, Bauer persisted, and once it was clear that King Alexander had agreed to his appointment, Stepinac consented. Upon his naming, he took &quot;In te, Domine, speravi&quot; (I place my trust in You, my Lord) as his motto.

At the time of his consecration on 24 June 1934, Stepinac was the youngest bishop in the Catholic Church, and was completely unknown to the Croat people. Two weeks after his consecration, he led a 15,000-strong pilgrimage to the old Marian shrine of the Black Madonna at Marija Bistrica. Stepinac followed this with annual pilgrimages to the site. Bauer delegated many tasks and responsibilities to Stepinac, and he travelled widely within the country.

=== Political situation ===
Stepinac&#x27;s appointment came at a time of acute political turmoil in Yugoslavia. In June 1928, the popular leader of the Croatian Peasant Party (Latn|Hrvatska seljačka stranka}}, HSS) Stjepan Radić and several other Croatian deputies had been shot by a Serb deputy in the Yugoslav Parliament. Two had died immediately and Radić had succumbed to his wounds two months later, the incident causing widespread outrage among Croats. In January of the following year, King Alexander had prorogued Parliament and had effectively become a royal dictator.

In April 1933, the new leader of the HSS Vladko Maček had been sent to prison for three years on charges of separatism after he and other opposition figures had issued the Zagreb Points condemning the royal regime and its policies. While Maček was in prison, his deputy Josip Predavec was apparently murdered by the police. When Stepinac wanted to visit Maček in prison to thank him for his well-wishes on Stepinac&#x27;s appointment as coadjutor bishop, his request was denied.

In response to the many messages of support, Stepinac &quot;was sincerely thankful for all the congratulations, but said that he was not enthusiastic about the appointment because it was too heavy a cross for him&quot;.

On 30 July 1934, Stepinac received the French deputy Robert Schuman, whom he told: &quot;There is no justice in Yugoslavia. ... The Catholic Church endures much&quot;. Throughout 1934, Stepinac spoke with veteran Croatian politician and de facto head of the HSS Ante Trumbić on several occasions. On his views regarding the Kingdom of Yugoslavia, Trumbić recorded that Stepinac had

loyalty to the state as it is, but with the condition that the state acts towards the Catholic Church as it does to all just denominations and that it guarantees them freedom.

After his consecration, Stepinac visited Belgrade to pledge his allegiance to King Alexander. The journalist Richard West quotes Stepinac:

I told the King that I was not a politician and that I would forbid my clergy to take part in party politics, but on the other hand I would look for full respect for the rights of Croats. I warned the King that the Croats must not be improperly provoked and even forbidden to use the very name of Croat, something which I had myself experienced.

On 9 October 1934, King Alexander was assassinated in Marseilles by a Bulgarian gunman backed by the Croatian nationalist organisation, the Ustaše. Stepinac, along with Bishops Antun Akšamović, Dionizije Njaradi and Gregorij Rožman, were given special permission by the Papal Nuncio in Belgrade to attend the Serbian Orthodox funeral. Less than a month after the assassination, Stepinac was among those who signed what became known as the &quot;Zagreb Memorandum&quot;, which listed a number of demands, including the exoneration of Maček, a general amnesty, freedom of movement and association, restrictions on the activities of government-authorised paramilitaries, and free elections. The key demand of the Memorandum was that the regency that had succeeded the king should address the &quot;Croatian question&quot;, the desire of many Croats for self-determination.

=== Other activities ===
In 1936, he climbed Mount Triglav, the tallest peak in Yugoslavia. In 2006, the 70th anniversary of his climb was commemorated with a memorial chapel being built near the summit. In July 1937, he led a pilgrimage to the Holy Land (then the British Mandate of Palestine). During the pilgrimage, he blessed an altar dedicated to the martyr Nikola Tavelić, who had already been beatified at that time, and was later canonised as a saint. After his return from Palestine, Stepinac began a campaign for the canonisation of Tavelić, and proposed that a monument to him be built in the Velebit mountains overlooking the Adriatic Sea.

== Archbishop of Zagreb ==

On 7 December 1937, Bauer died, and though still below the age of forty, Stepinac succeeded him as Archbishop of Zagreb. Presaging the Ustaše reign of terror during World War II, Stepinac addressed a group of university students during Lent in 1938, saying,

Love for one&#x27;s own nation must not turn a man into a wild animal, which destroys everything and calls for reprisal, but it must enrich him, so that his own nation respects and loves other nations.

In 1938, the Kingdom of Yugoslavia held its last election before the outbreak of war. Stepinac voted for Maček&#x27;s opposition list, while Radio Belgrade spread the false information that he had voted for Milan Stojadinović&#x27;s Yugoslav Radical Union. In the latter half of 1938, Stepinac had an operation for acute appendicitis.

In 1940, Stepinac received the regent Prince Paul at St. Mark&#x27;s Church as he arrived in Zagreb to garner support for the 1939 Cvetković–Maček Agreement, which had created the autonomous Banovina of Croatia within Yugoslavia. The Agreement was intended to address the &quot;Croatian question&quot;, but did not satisfy those demanding full independence. Pope Pius XII declared the period from 29 June 1940 to 29 June 1941 as a jubilee year to celebrate 1300 years of Christianity among the Croats. In 1940, the Franciscan Order celebrated 700 years in Croatia and the order&#x27;s Minister General Leonardo Bello came to Zagreb for the event. During his visit, Stepinac joined the Third Order of Saint Francis, on 29 September 1940. After the death of Bauer, Stepinac attempted to remain aloof from politics, and tried to unify Croatian Catholic organisations and subordinate them directly to his authority. He was unable to achieve this, probably because he was young and relatively inexperienced, and did not command the level of respect and authority usually accorded an Archbishop of Zagreb.

The historian Mark Biondich observes that the Catholic Church had historically been on the fringes of Croatian mass politics and public life, and that the influence of the Church had been further eroded during the interwar period due to the royal dictatorship and the popularity of the anti-clerical HSS.

== Political and religious views prior to World War II ==

During his period as coadjutor archbishop and as Archbishop of Zagreb up to the German-led Axis invasion of Yugoslavia in April 1941, Stepinac made his views clear on a number of political and religious issues. Foremost among these statements were those regarding Protestantism, Eastern Orthodoxy, communism and Freemasonry.

Stepinac criticized Protestantism, stating in a speech in 1938 that &quot;the Catholic Church was the greatest civilising force in human history&quot;, and railed against those that wanted to deprive the Catholic Church of any influence in public life. He referred to the Reformation as the &quot;Deformation&quot;, and denounced Luther as a false prophet who &quot;demolished the principles of legal authority given by the Lord&quot;. He went on to blame Protestantism for the &quot;hell in which human society suffers today&quot;, and said that it had opened the road to &quot;anarchy in all forms of human life.&quot; Stepinac was also highly critical of Eastern Orthodoxy, seeing it as a serious danger to both the Catholic Church and Croats in general. The day after the Yugoslav coup d&#x27;état of 27 March 1941, carried out by British-supported Serb officers against a pact with the Axis powers, he wrote in his diary:

All in all, Croats and Serbs are two worlds, the north and south poles, which will never become close except by a miracle of God. The schism is the greatest curse of Europe, almost greater than Protestantism. In it there is no morality, no principle, no truth, no justice, no honesty.

On the same day he issued an encyclical to his clergy, calling on them to pray for the young king, and that Croatia and Yugoslavia would be &quot;spared the horrors of war&quot;. This was consistent with long-standing practice of the Catholic Church to show loyalty to the state and its leadership.

Stepinac was well aware of the fact that an estimated 200,000 mostly Croatian Catholics had converted to the Serbian Orthodox Church in the interwar period. Actual census data contradict these claims, showing slightly greater percentage increase in the number of Catholic Croats compared to Orthodox Serbs in both Croatia and Bosnia. He later claimed that Catholics were forced to convert to Orthodoxy during the period between the wars, but according to the historian Jozo Tomasevich, the principal reason for their conversions was the pro-Serb public policy in the Serb-dominated Yugoslav state meant that it was advantageous both politically and for career prospects to be a member of the dominant religion. Tomasevich also notes that despite the fact that it was the national church of the dominant nation in the country, the Serb Orthodox Church felt threatened by Rome, particularly in Bosnia where the Catholic Church was extremely dynamic - in just one diocese, encompassing half of Bosnia&#x27;s Catholics, it created 17 new parishes in the interwar period. Tomasevich cites Vladko Maček, the leading prewar Croatian opposition leader, who when attacked by an Ustaše priest, for failing to state in his autobiography that the Catholic Church was persecuted in prewar Yugoslavia, Maček responded: &quot;I could not write about the persecution of the Catholic Church because to the best of my knowledge such persecution did not exist.&quot; Yet, Stepinac viewed the Yugoslav state as essentially anti-Catholic, particularly after the failure of the Yugoslav Parliament to ratify the already signed Concordat with the Vatican, which would have put the Catholic Church on a more equal footing with the Orthodox Church. He was also sensitive to the fact that the Concordat had been vetoed in the Yugoslav parliament partly due to pressure exerted by the Serbian church.

The political scientist Sabrina P. Ramet has detailed a range of anti-Catholic aspects to the interwar Yugoslav state, including that King Alexander tried to regulate the religious life of the state, entrenching discrimination against adherents of religious groups other than the Serbian Orthodox Church, and trying to erode their influence by allowing Orthodox proselytising in Catholic areas. Yet Stella Alexander states that both the Catholic and Orthodox churches proselytized in interwar years, with the Catholic Church doing so more openly and aggressively than the Orthodox, especially in Bosnia Hercegovina which had a mixed Catholic, Muslim and Orthodox population. The press was used to accuse the Catholic Church of being pro-fascist, despite the Yugoslav government itself having fascist traits at the time. The government promoted the Old Catholic Church, a rival organisation which has been established when some Catholics refused to accept the doctrine of papal infallibility after the First Vatican Council. Despite the fact that in 1921, Catholics made up 39.3 per cent of the population, and Orthodox comprised 46.7 per cent, the Ministry of Faiths initially allocated fourteen times more money to the Orthodox Church than the Catholic Church. While this was adjusted, the funding proportions remained very inequitable. All of these strategies worked to undermine the role of the Catholic Church in Yugoslavia. The promotion of Serbdom was at the centre of government education policy, with school books promoting the importance of Serbian Orthodox monasteries in Dalmatia while ignoring Catholic ones. The official newspaper of the Serbian Orthodox Church stated that it wanted to achieve the &quot;victory of Serbian Orthodoxy&quot; throughout Yugoslavia. Under the constant pressure from the state and the Serbian Orthodox Church, between 1923 and 1931 the proportion of Catholics in Yugoslavia declined to 37.4 per cent and that of Serbian Orthodox believers increased to 48.7 per cent. The Croatian theologian Roko Rogošić claimed that 100,000 Roman Catholics had converted to Eastern Orthodoxy under pressure from the Yugoslav government and the Serbian Orthodox Church in 1935 alone. However, census data contradict these claims, showing a slightly greater percentage increase in the number of Catholic Croats compared to Orthodox Serbs in both Croatia and Bosnia in the interwar years.

In 1930&#x27;s Croatia the Catholic movement shifted rightward toward authoritarian, radical Catholicism. Under Stepinac the hierarchical &quot;Crusaders&quot; Catholic youth organization grew to 40,000 members by 1938. Via uniformed parades and public rallies, and their slogan &quot;God, Church, Homeland&quot;, they blended radical Catholicism and Croat nationalism, opposing liberalism, communism and Greater Serbianism They adopted a Greater Croatia ideology, which envisaged Croatia expanding its borders to claim Bosnia-Herzegovina and Bačka. In 1941 the Crusaders became enthusiastic supporters of the Ustaše regime. Stepinac was the leader of the Croatian Catholic Action in the Zagreb Archdiocese, whose newspaper, &quot;Hrvatska straža (Croatian Guard)&quot; proclaimed they are &quot;always radical Croats and always radical Catholics&quot;, that &quot;communism is the greatest evil&quot; and &quot;the fruit of the Jew Karl Marx&quot;. In the Spanish Civil War they sided with Franco, Italy and Germany, because &quot;they do not tolerate Jews or communists or insidious, dangerous Freemasonry.&quot; &quot;Katolički list&quot;, the official newspaper of Stepinac&#x27;s archdiocese, proclaimed: &quot;Jews are the main enemies of humanity. They are the true curse of the human race.&quot; On the domestic front, Catholic newspapers especially attacked the politics of the Croatian Peasants Party and Vladko Maček in particular. In the late 1930s a significant segment of the Croatian Catholic movement attacked the Croatian Peasant Party&#x27;s commitment to democracy, pacifism and negotiation, and instead moved toward independence and authoritarianism, with prominent Catholic intellectuals joining the Ustaše before WWII. After 1941, these Catholic activists - men like Ivo Guberina, Milivoj Magdić, Ivan Oršanić, Ivo Bogdan and others - became leading Ustaše propagandists and apologists, some served as officials in the Ustaše regime. Thus a leader of the Crusaders, Ivan Oršanić, first led the State Secretariat for Propaganda in the NDH, then became the leader of the Ustaše Youth, reporting directly to Pavelić.

In 1937 Archbishop Stepinac founded the Committee for Refugee Assistance in Zagreb, which extensively helped the Jews fleeing from Nazi Germany. Terezija Skringar, the secretary of that Committee, would be apprehended by Gestapo immediately after the arrival of Wehrmacht forces in Zagreb in April 1940, and spent 5 months in German detention. Stepinac preached against racism in several sermons, starting from 1938. &quot;To consider oneself as some higher beings - superhuman and despise another, when it is known that all men are in themselves dust and ashes, and by the mercy of God, all the children of one Heavenly Father&quot;, he preached in 1938. Stepinac considered Nazis as &quot;pagans&quot;, and always held a reserved attitude in any contact with German representatives. The Gestapo in Zagreb reported that Stepinac held a clear antipathy against Nazism, and made numerous acts to help persecuted Jews in the 1941–1945 period.

In 1940, Stepinac told Prince Paul:

The most ideal thing would be for the Serbs to return to the faith of their fathers, that is, to bow the head before Christ&#x27;s representative, the Holy Father. Then we could at last breathe in this part of Europe, for Byzantinism has played a frightful role in the history of this part of the world.

Of all the threats he perceived to the Croatian people and the Catholic Church, Stepinac railed most against the dangers of communism. In August 1940, in response to the recent establishment of diplomatic relations between Yugoslavia and the Soviet Union, Stepinac sermonised that there could be no co-operation between the Church and communists, stated that the Church was not afraid of communists, and that communists would make Croatia &quot;a nation of killers and robbers, debauchees, and thieves&quot;.

Stepinac was particularly obsessed with Freemasonry, which was closely associated with support for the unification of Yugoslavia and opposed what it considered the Catholic Church&#x27;s &quot;authoritarianism and anti-liberal ideology.&quot; In 1934 Stepinac wrote in his diary: &quot;In Yugoslavia, today, Freemasonry rules. Unfortunately, in the heart of the Croatian nation also, in Zagreb, this hellish society has entrenched itself, a lair of immorality, corruption, and all kinds of dishonesty, the sworn enemy of the Catholic Church and therefore also of the Croatian nation. Without the knowledge and approval of the Freemasons, nobody can be appointed to any influential position. It is no joke to join battle with it, but it must be done in the interests of the church, the Croatian people, and even the state of Yugoslavia if it wants to continue to exist, because the violence that rules today is supported by Freemasonry.&quot;

Tomasevich notes that such vehement sentiments against Freemasonry were not unusual among conservative senior churchmen prior to the Second Vatican Council. Tomasevich further observes that despite papal encyclicals against both Italian fascist abuses against Catholic Youth organizations in 1931 and German Nazism in 1937, Stepinac refrained from condemning or even mentioning Fascism or Nazism, pointing out that in 1938 the Catholic Church was supporting the Italian and German allies of Franco Spanish Civil War, and public criticism of their political ideologies would not have been helpful. Finally, Tomasevich stresses that the Vatican saw Germany as the most important opponent of communism. Nevertheless, Stepinac was a member of the Yugoslav Catholic Bishops&#x27; Conference that issued warnings against both Nazism and Communism after the 1937 papal encyclical against Nazis ideology. Stepinac feared both Nazism and communism, even as he disdained western parliamentary democracy. This can be seen from Stepinac&#x27;s diary entry of 5 November 1940, when he wrote,

If Germany wins [the war], there will be appalling terror and the destruction of little nations. If England wins, the masons, [and] Jews will remain in power ... If the USSR wins, then the devil will have authority over both the world and hell.

West describes Stepinac as a &quot;puritanical zealot&quot;, who gathered together those opposing communism, liberalism, secular education, divorce reform, profanity, sexual intercourse outside of marriage, and birth control, under the umbrella of the Croatian Catholic movement. Stepinac even railed against &quot;mixed sunbathing and swimming&quot;. West also observes that by 1934, Stepinac had developed into an

ardent, almost obsessive, Croatian nationalist whose bigotry was softened only by his piety and a measure of human kindness.

According to the journalist Marcus Tanner, by the time he became coadjutor bishop, Stepinac had become a determined opponent of the Serb-centric approach of the Yugoslav government, and by the time he became archbishop he was a strong supporter of the HSS, making it clear that he had voted for Maček in the 1938 elections.

Stella Alexander wrote of Stepinac&#x27;s political outlook:

He was in many ways a typical son of the Church in Croatia of that time, fervidly pious, narrow and dogmatic, believing, in his own words, that &quot;Jews, freemasons and communists&quot; were &quot;the worst enemies of the Church&quot;, and that the Orthodox Serbs, the schismatics must whenever possible be brought back to the true Church. This was coupled not only with great courage, but with social concern and charity, especially when he was confronted with individual cases; he was a good pastor and felt close to his people. The impression he makes is also, unexpectedly, one of simplicity and personal modesty. He was conscious of the dignity and weight of his office but never of himself. His courage, which was always great, increased as the pressures on him grew heavier and in the end could be described as heroic; this and his devotion to duty made flight or even withdrawal from his diocese unthinkable. But his political short-sightedness limited his grasp of the apocalyptic events of 1941 to the immediate future of Croatia and the Catholic Church in Croatia, and this left him open to the charge of complicity in the terrible crimes of the ustaše. The same blinkered outlook kept him from establishing some kind of modus Vivendi with the new government immediately after the war.

== World War II ==

After the outbreak of war in September 1939, the Kingdom of Yugoslavia declared its neutrality, and the United Kingdom worked hard to help Yugoslavia maintain its stance. In the face of steadily mounting pressure from Germany and Italy, by March 1941 Yugoslavia had been completely surrounded by members of the Axis. In this situation, some senior government figures were advocating for Yugoslavia to also join the Tripartite Pact.

After a number of delays, Prince Paul and Prime Minister Cvetković signed the Pact on 25 March, but the following day there were demonstrations in Belgrade, with protesters chanting &quot;Better the grave than a slave, better a war than the pact&quot;. In the early hours of 27 March a bloodless military &quot;coup d&#x27;état&quot; was executed. In the wake of the coup, the new government refused to ratify Yugoslavia&#x27;s signing of the Tripartite Pact, but did not openly rule it out. The coup found little support with the Croatian population, and on the day after the invasion commenced Maček resigned from the government and returned to Zagreb in anticipation of unrest.

=== Invasion and establishment of the Independent State of Croatia ===

Hitler was furious when he learned of the coup, and later on 27 March 1941 he ordered the invasion of Yugoslavia. Commencing on 6 April, a German-led Axis invasion force began its assault from multiple directions, quickly overcoming the limited resistance. During the fighting, several Croat units mutinied and others performed poorly or defected. On 10 April 1941, with the assistance of the Germans, the senior Ustaše figure in the country, Slavko Kvaternik, proclaimed the establishment of the Independent State of Croatia (, NDH). German tanks entered Zagreb later that same day and were greeted by cheering crowds.

Before the war the Ustaše were a fascist, ultranationalist, racist and terrorist organization, fighting for an independent Croatia. Ustaše terrorists set off bombs on international trains bound for Yugoslavia, and were convicted in the 1934 assassination of the Yugoslav King and French foreign Minister in Marseilles. Ante Pavelić, Kvaternik and other Ustaše leaders were sentenced to death in absentia by French courts, as the true assassination ringleaders. The Ustaše &quot;17 Principles&quot; proclaimed that those who were not &quot;of Croat blood&quot; (i.e. Serbs and Jews), will not have any political role in the future Croat state. In his 1936 tract, &quot;The Croat Question&quot;, the Ustaše leader, Pavelić, spouted anti-Serb and anti-Semitic hatred, calling Jews the enemy of the Croat people.

On 12 April, Stepinac visited Kvaternik and pledged his loyalty to the NDH. The following day, when the Ustaše leader Ante Pavelić arrived in Zagreb, Stepinac did not participate in the welcome, but he did visit Pavelić on 16 April. These meetings and a radio broadcast all occurred prior to the capitulation of the Yugoslav armed forces on 17 April. That evening, Stepinac hosted a dinner party for Pavelić and the leading Ustaše. On 27 April, Stepinac recorded in his diary that Pavelić assured him he will act per the Catholic Church&#x27;s desires, and that Pavelić stated he will &quot;exterminate&quot; the Old Catholic Church (which rejects Papal authority) and will not be tolerant of the Serbian Orthodox Church, because it was not the Church for him, but a political organization. Based on this Stepinac concluded in his diary that Pavelic is &quot;a sincere Catholic and that the Church would enjoy freedom to carry out its work&quot;, although he recognised that difficulties lay ahead. On the same day, the official Croatian Catholic newspaper &quot;Nedelja&quot; praised both Pavelić and Hitler, saying:

God, who directs the destiny of nations and controls the hearts of kings, has given us Ante Pavelić and moved the leader of friendly and allied people, Adolf Hitler, to use his victorious troops to disperse our oppressors and enable us to create an Independent State of Croatia. Glory be to God, our gratitude to Adolf Hitler, and infinite loyalty to our Poglavnik, Ante Pavelić.

Immediately the Ustaše implemented draconian decrees specifying death as the sole penalty for those who attempt to act against the regime (April 17), opened the first concentration camp (April 15), and initiated the persecution of Jews and Serbs. Aware the Ustaše were preparing Nazi-style Race Laws, on April 23 Stepinac wrote Ustaše interior minister Andrija Artuković a letter, in which Stepinac calls the Race Laws &quot;necessary&quot;, and only asks that Jewish converts to Catholicism be exempted. Five days later, on 28 April, Stepinac issued a &quot;rapturous&quot; encyclical to his diocese regarding the creation of the &quot;young Croatian state&quot;, which included the words:

Our people has come face to face with its age-old and ardently desired dream. The times are such that it is no longer the tongue which speaks but the blood with its mysterious links with the country, in which we have seen the light of God, and with its people from whom we spring. Do we need to say that the blood flows more quickly in our veins, that the hearts in our breasts beat faster? ... It is easy to see God&#x27;s hand at work here.

Stepinac urged the clergy of his archdiocese to fulfill their duty to the new Croatian state and pray that the head of state, i.e. the Ustashe leader Pavelić,

may have the spirit and wisdom in order to fulfill noble and responsible office for the glory of God and the salvation of the people in truth and justice.

Stepinac&#x27;s letter captured what was a common sentiment among Croatian nationalists and much of the Catholic Church in the new state. Considering the marginal role of the Church in the political arena during the interwar period, the creation of the NDH appeared to offer the Church and the Croatian Catholic movement an opportunity. The leaders of the new state appeared willing to work with Church leaders, and thus reduce the marginalisation the Church had been subject to under the Yugoslav state.

Stepinac&#x27;s immediate visits to Kvaternik and Pavelić, and his diocesan letter all assisted the Ustaše in consolidating their control of the new state, and enhanced its credibility with the Croatian people. Cornwell notes that this letter was issued on the same day that nearly 200 Serbs were massacred by the Ustaše near Bjelovar. Even prior to Stepinac&#x27;s letter, Ustaše and Volksdeutche had already destroyed the Osijek synagogue (14 April), and on 17 April Pavelić had issued the Decree on the Protection of the Nation and the State, the first of the acts that placed Serbs, Jews and Roma outside the law, leading to their persecution and destruction. The Ustaše had opened and started filling their first concentration camp (15 April), and had instituted additional discriminatory edicts against Jews and Serbs (14, 19, 22 and 25 April). Stepinac already knew of the planned racial laws, which Pavelić signed only 2 days after Stepinac issued his letter praising Pavelić and the Ustaše state.

On 30 April 1941, Pavelić signed the main race laws - the &quot;Legal Decree on Racial Origins&quot;, and the &quot;Legal Decree on the Protection of Aryan Blood and the Honor of the Croatian People&quot;. In a letter to the Pope from May 16, Stepinac wrote that the race laws were meant to appease the Nazis, and concludes that &quot;it was a much lesser evil that the Croats passed this law rather than that the Germans took all power into their own hands&quot;. In a May 14 letter to the Pope, when he knew of the slaughter of 260 Orthodox Serbs held in the Glina Church, Stepinac praised Ustaše efforts to turn Croatia into a &quot;Catholic country&quot;, and praised Pavelić in particular, noting he will &quot;liquidate&quot; (eliminate) Orthodox Serbs from Croatia:

Completely honestly, I notice that in the circles of power there is the utmost desire to turn Croatia into a Catholic country. The Minister of War [Slavko Kvaternik] absolutely guaranteed me: either Croatia will be a Catholic country, or let it disappear…The desire of those who currently rule Croatia to implement the teachings of the Catholic Church obliges us to help and support them with all the loyalty and strength we have.&quot; Stepinac added: &quot;Pavelić is a true Catholic practicing believer, and he wants to create, despite huge obstacles, a Catholic state in Croatia ... I believe that if the Poglavnik, Pavelić, were head of government for 20 years, the schismatics [i.e. Orthodox Serbs] would be completely liquidated (eliminated) from Croatia.&quot; Referencing Nazi plans to expel 260,000 Slovenes, Stepinac wrote: &quot;Earlier [Pavelić] asked me what I thought if he decided to ask the German authorities to change the fate of Slovenes and transfer them as Catholics to Croatia, among Catholics, and transfer the same number of schismatic Serbs from Croatia to Macedonia. I replied to [Pavelić] that such a solution would be better for the unfortunate Slovenes&quot;

Croatian historian, Hrvoje Klasić, notes Stepinac supported actions that today&#x27;s courts would classify as ethnic cleansing of Serbs. In May 1941 Pavelić visited the Pope. Phayer writes that Stepinac arranged the audience with Pius XII, and &quot;recommended the dictator to the Holy See&quot;. Ester Gitman writes that &quot;Stepinac chose not to join Pavelić&quot; and that he was given a private audience with the Pope. Pavelić put pressure on Archbishop Stepinac to write to Pope Pius XII, via Cardinal Maglione, to request official recognition of the Independent State of Croatia. The answer came back in July - in accordance with long-standing tradition during wartime, no Vatican recognition of the NDH was forthcoming. But the Pope did send Abbot Giuseppe Marcone as apostolic visitor, who acted as papal nuncio, which satisfied Stepinac, since he felt &quot;the Vatican had de facto recognized the new state&quot;.

In May 16 report to the Pope, Stepinac wrote:

It is obvious for now, the pressure of the Germans, who are very much felt in the laws against Jews, although they claim that they do not want to interfere in the internal affairs of the Croatian State. Indeed, the racist law passed these days must be attributed to the severe pressures of Germany, because I know from personal encounters with people who run the state that they do not intend to keep the law in full force for long as it has been published. It is much less evil that the Croats passed this law than if the Germans had taken all power into their own hands. 
Pavelić met Hitler for the first time on 7 June 1941, and told him that many younger clergy were supportive of the Ustaše regime, but mentioned that Stepinac had advised him that he could only rule if he was &quot;as forebearing as possible&quot;. Biondich notes that Stepinac was unhappy that many younger priests were overtly supporting the Ustaše. On 26 June 1941, Stepinac met with the Archbishop of Vrhbosna and the bishops of Belgrade, Banja Luka, Split, Hvar, Šibenik and Senj-Modruš. The Bishop of Mostar sent a friar to the meeting. The group decided to go to Pavelić to express their devotion and trust. At the reception with Pavelić, Stepinac stated that &quot;love of religion and country spring only from God&quot;, then promised Pavelić their loyalty and co-operation.

Despite initially welcoming the Independent State of Croatia, Stepinac subsequently condemned the Nazi-aligned state&#x27;s atrocities against Jews and Serbs. He objected to the persecution of Jews and Nazi laws, helped Jews and others to escape and criticized Ustaše atrocities in front of Zagreb Cathedral in 1943. Despite this, Stepinac never broke with the Ustaše regime and continued to attend public gatherings at their side. After the invasion and Italian annexation of much of the Dalmatian coast, the ecclesiastical province of the Zagreb archbishopric included the Archdiocese of Zagreb, as well as the dioceses of Đakovo and Senj-Modruš, and the Greek Catholic Bishopric of Križevci. Stepinac had very limited formal authority over the suffragan bishops of his province, being more of a &quot;first among equals&quot; than a superior. Biondich states that Stepinac did not have the power to dictate policy or control the behaviour of the Sarajevo-based Archbishop of Vrhbosna, Ivan Šarić, or the other bishops in the NDH. Yet Goldstein notes that Stepinac communicated with Sarajevo Archbishop Ivan Šarić, but apparently never even privately condemned his public support for the Ustaše genocides, unlike the Croatian Peasant Party members in London who vehemently condemned Šarić.

By the end of Summer 1941, Ante Pavelić publicly blamed the irregular &quot;Wild Ustashe&quot; (some 25,000-30,000 of them, including many criminal elements) for all the atrocities performed by the Ustashe in the previous months. The state authorities never paid members of &quot;Wild Ustashe&quot;, nor acknowledged them to be in the military service, though government-controlled press and Ustashe officials in former months clearly encouraged those aggressive but undisciplined groups to go against the &quot;enemy elements&quot;, as the regime needed the manpower to execute ethnic cleansing and genocide within the NDH. Some members of that irregular part of the Ustashe Militia were arrested, tried and executed for the crimes against Serbs and Gypsies. This was done to convey a message to the rest of the &quot;Wild Ustashe&quot; to become part of the Ustashe hierarchy through regimentation. Persecution against Serbs, Jews and Roma persisted, however.

=== Relations with the government ===
The historian, Jozo Tomasevich, states that the NDH regime unleashed genocidal policies against Jews, Serbs and Roma, while also subjecting Croats to the greatest repression they experienced in their history. According to John Fine, Stepinac enjoyed close associations with the Ustaše leaders, as he was the archbishop of the capital. During the war Stepinac personally celebrated Te Deums on the anniversary of the founding of the NDH, including on April 10., 1945. Stepinac served as the military Vicar of the NDH army throughout the war. He appeared in photographs numerous times in Ustaše newspapers, alongside Pavelić and other Ustaše leaders. Although he later sought to distance himself from the Ustaše, especially when it became clear the Axis powers and the Ustaše would lose the war, Stepinac and the hierarchy of Catholic Church in Croatia nevertheless continued to publicly support the Ustaše regime until the very end.

In mid-May 1941, Maglione was already noting that Stepinac and other bishops were treading cautiously with the NDH authorities to avoid &quot;compromising themselves&quot; with the Ustaše leadership. In July 1941, no Te Deum was sung at the Zagreb Cathedral in celebration of Pavelić&#x27;s birthday, which contributed to tension between Stepinac and the Ustaše leader. Yet that same month, at the end of the first NDH Bishop&#x27;s conference, the bishops were received by Pavelić. Stepinac personally greeted Pavelić and stated that the bishops were visiting him &quot;as the legitimate representatives of the Church of God in the NDH, with the promise of sincere and loyal cooperation for a better future of our homeland&quot;. In October 1941, shortly after the Ustaše destroyed the main synagogue in Zagreb, Stepinac preached a sermon in which he said,

&quot;A House of God, of whatever religion, is a holy place. Whoever touches such a place will pay with his life. An attack on a House of God of any religion constitutes an attack on all religious communities.&quot; (Ivo Goldstein notes that claims that Stepinac said this come from a single individual, and are not confirmed by any other source, despite the fact Stepinac supposedly made the speech in the Zagreb cathedral. Goldstein also notes it&#x27;s contrary to the rather gentler criticism of Ustaše race laws in well-documented, private-only communications at that time)

In November 1941, Stepinac chaired a bishop&#x27;s conference, during which he heard reports from various bishops within the NDH. What he heard made his enthusiasm wane for the new Croatian state. On 20 November he wrote to Pavelić including some of the reports he had received. He stated that he believed that the worst of the atrocities were over, and that he believed they were the work of individuals. Yet contrary to Stepinac blaming individuals, historians state the Ustaše regime carried out systematic genocidal policies against Jews, Serbs and Roma. The letter did challenge Pavelić, stating that &quot;no-one can deny that these terrible acts of violence and cruelty have been taking place&quot;, pointing out that Pavelić himself had condemned the atrocities committed by the Ustaše. He said, &quot;The Croatian nation has been proud of its 1000-year-old culture and Christian tradition. That is why we wait for it to show in practice, now that it has achieved its freedom, a greater nobility and humanity than that displayed by its former rulers&quot;. Tomasevich notes that Stepinac never made this letter public, e.g. in the form of a pastoral letter, which could have had a beneficial effect on restraining Ustaše crimes. In fact Tomasevich writes that neither Stepinac, nor anyone else in the Church hierarchy ever uttered one word of public protest against Ustaše crimes against Serbs, by far the most numerous victims of NDH genocidal policies.

In December 1941, Pavelić met with the Italian foreign minister, Count Galeazzo Ciano, and told him that the lower levels of Catholic clergy displayed a very positive attitude towards the Ustaše regime, but that some of the bishops were openly hostile to the government. Also in December, Stepinac declared membership in Catholic Action and in the Ustaše to be incompatible. Cornwell states that Stepinac was &quot;wholly in accord with the general goals of the new Croatian state&quot;. Tomasevich states that the Catholic Church fully supported Ustaše policies, and failed to publicly condemn crimes against Serbs. Many priests and well-known Catholic laymen openly sided with the Ustaše, assumed responsible positions in the NDH, while the Catholic press praised the Pavelić regime. On more than one occasion, the archbishop proclaimed his support for the Independent State of Croatia and welcomed the demise of Yugoslavia. On 10 April each year during the war he celebrated a mass to celebrate proclamation of the NDH. In June 1945 the Papal legate to the NDH, Marcone, related to a British officer in Zagreb that the Croatian Catholic Church during the war &quot;tended to identify itself too closely with the Ustaše&quot;, because (1) many Croat priests were passionate believers in Croatia&#x27;s independence, thus they were tempted to turn a blind eye on Ustaše atrocities, and (2) they were drawn to leading Ustaše because they were devout Catholics, including the worst criminals like Pavelić, Rukavina and Luburić.

In May, 1943, Stepinac sent a report to the Papal secretary of state, on the attitude of the Catholic Church in Croatia towards the Ustaše regime. Responding to criticisms that the Church had not done enough to oppose Ustaše crimes, Stepinac enumerated the main benefits the Church received from the Ustaše regime: it fights abortion, which Stepinac claimed is mainly performed by Jewish and Serb doctors, and has banned pornography, according to Stepinac, published by Jews and Serbs; that it abolished Freemasonry and vigorously fought against communism, that it issued decrees against swearing. The Ustaše government ensured the Christian education of NDH soldiers; insisted on religious education in schools; that it increased financial aid to Catholic religious institutions, increased the salaries of the clergy, supported the Church&#x27;s charitable activities, financially supported the construction of new and the repair of existing churches. According to Stepinac, all these were indicators of the Ustaše regime&#x27;s goodwill towards the Catholic Church, and &quot;as the Archbishop&#x27;s report makes clear, the Church reciprocated in kind.&quot;

In the same letter Stepinac described Yugoslav government-in-exile complaints against the Ustaše regime as &quot;enemy propaganda&quot; aimed at bringing the NDH into disrepute in the eyes of the Vatican. He admitted that atrocities had been committed against Serbs by irresponsible people without the sanction of the NDH authorities, and claimed that many of those responsible had been executed by the government. He deplored and condemned the atrocities, but stated that they were a reaction to Serb behavior during the interwar period during which, he claimed, Serbs had violated all the rights of the Croatian people. He also reminded the Cardinal of the assassination of the Croatian deputies in the Parliament in 1928. Tomasevich notes the Ustaše also sought to justify, what they regularly referred to as &quot;some excesses&quot; by individual Ustaše and &quot;wild Ustaše&quot;, by invoking prewar repressive acts by the Serb-dominated Yugoslav regime. However, contrary to Stepinac&#x27;s views, Tomasevich writes that &quot;the wartime Ustaše policies against the Serbs were of a genocidal nature and totally out of proportion to earlier [Serb] anti-Croatian measures, both in nature and extent&quot;. Furthermore, the Ustaše regime also carried genocides against Jews and Roma, in NDH state-run concentration camps.

Pavelić attended services at Zagreb Cathedral only once in the four years he was in power, and Stepinac did not greet him at the entrance on that occasion. Stepinac lost control of the Archdiocese&#x27;s publication &quot;Katolički List&quot; under the new regime. In 1942, officials from Hungary lobbied to ecclesiastically attach Hungarian-occupied Međimurje to a diocese in Hungary. Stepinac opposed this and received guarantees from the Holy See that diocesan boundaries would not change during the war. On 26 October 1943, the Germans killed the archbishop&#x27;s brother Mijo.

According to Tanner, Stepinac remained naive about politics and the nature of the Ustaše regime. In 1943, Stepinac travelled to the Vatican and came into contact with the Croatian artist Ivan Meštrović. According to Meštrović, Stepinac asked him whether he thought Pavelić knew about the killings of Serbs. When Meštrović replied that Pavelić must know everything, Stepinac went pale and burst into tears.

The historian Martin Gilbert wrote that despite initially welcoming the Independent State of Croatia, Stepinac later &quot;condemned Croat atrocities against both Serbs and Jews, and himself saved a group of Jews in an old age home&quot;. According to West, Stepinac and the entire Catholic Church remained loyal to Pavelić and the NDH. West states that Stepinac was one of the priests and father-confessors to senior Ustaše such as Pavelić, Budak, Kvaternik and Artuković.

In 1944, the NDH Ministry for Justice and Religion proposed, and Stepinac accepted the Order of Merit medal from Pavelić, for &quot;having as archbishop unmasked inside and outside the country the opponents of the Independent State of Croatia&quot;

The Catholic Church in the NDH then began to criticise actions taken by the government, and attempted to distance itself to some extent from the authorities. It had no real alternative, given that the likely alternate governments were led by Serb-chauvinist Chetniks or communists. By that time the Ustaše had long lost the support of the great majority of the Croatian people, and most members of the main Croatian prewar party, the Croatian Peasant Party, were supporting the Partisans. Contrary to this, the Church maintained its support of the NDH government to the bitter end. This is demonstrated by the pastoral letter issued after the episcopal conference of 24 March 1945, in which the Croatian Catholic Church maintained its formal support for the puppet state and its rulers, despite the fact that most senior regime figures were preparing to flee the country. The Episcopal Conference was convened at the urging of the Ustaše government, who also had a hand in drafting the letter, issued after the formation of the new, unified Yugoslav government, which had already been recognized by the Allies. According to a later British representative in Zagreb, the papal legate Marcone stated that if he had known of the Bishops&#x27; letter of support for the NDH, he would have done everything to prevent its publication (during the war the Vatican recognized the Yugoslav government in exile, and postwar recognized the new Yugoslav government). The Catholic press in the NDH also maintained its support of Pavelić right to the end.

Ivo Goldstein notes Stepinac&#x27;s protests against Ustaše crimes, yet states that Stepinac&#x27;s biggest failure was his public support for the criminal NDH, from its first dayt to its last - he celebrated the coming of the Ustaše to power, held Te Deums on the anniversaries of the NDH (even on April 10, 1945), on numerous occasions he was photographed with Pavelić and other Ustaše officials, all of which provided legitimacy to Ustaše regime, allowing it to maintain power and commit crimes. The Ustaše ignored Stepinac&#x27;s private criticisms, while only a relatively small number of people heard his few public criticisms. On the other hand, countless people saw and read about Stepinac&#x27;s public support for the NDH. Furthermore, Stepinac expressed much of his criticisms only after the Ustaše had already committed most of their genocidal crimes.

Biondich concludes that claims that Stepinac was an Ustaše sympathiser, and even the spiritual leader of the regime are unfounded. He further states that while Stepinac supported independence, he &quot;began privately to distance himself from the regime within weeks, and certainly within months of the Croatian state&#x27;s formation.&quot; He also observes that while Stepinac continued to attend to his ceremonial duties at official state events, he was privately raising his concerns with the Ustaše leaders. However Biondich also states that Stepinac was not the outspoken critic of the Ustaše regime that many of his defenders claim.

On the other hand, historian Robert McCormick states, &quot;for all the Archbishop&#x27;s hand wringing, he continued to be a tacit participant in the Independent State of Croatia (ISC). He repeatedly appeared in public with the Poglavnik (the Ustaše leader Ante Pavelić), and issued Te Deum&#x27;s on the anniversary of the NDH&#x27;s creation. His failure to publicly denounce the Ustaše&#x27;s atrocities in the name of the NDH, was tantamount to accepting Pavelić&#x27;s policies&quot;.

On 10 April 1945, Stepinac held a mass in the Zagreb Cathedral for the 4th anniversary of the NDH&#x27;s founding, and Te Deum&#x27;s were sung for what was left of the Ustaše state. Richard West writes that, on 15 April, as Pavelić and other Ustaše leaders were getting ready to flee, &quot;Archbishop Stepinac devoted his sermon to what he believed was Croatia&#x27;s worst sin, not mass murder, but swearing.&quot;

=== Response to Ustaše atrocities ===
The atrocities committed by the Ustaše can be categorised into four broad areas, all of which fell largely on the Serb population of the NDH; racial laws, mass killings and concentration camps, deportations, and forced conversions to Catholicism.

==== Racial laws ====
On 23 April 1941, Stepinac wrote to the Ustaše Interior Minister, Artuković, &quot;on the occasion of the announced passage of anti-Jewish laws&quot;, to caution of &quot;good Catholics who are of the Jewish race and who have converted from the Jewish religion ... I consider that it would be necessary, in passing the necessary laws, to take converts of this kind into account.&quot; Historian Ivo Goldstein notes that Stepinac not only did not protest against the adoption of racial laws, he called them &quot;necessary&quot;, and only asked that Jewish converts to Catholicism be exempted. Following Pavelić&#x27;s proclamation of the Race Laws, Stepinac praised Pavelić to the Pope, as &quot;a true Catholic practicing believer&quot;, and stated that &quot;it was a much lesser evil that the Croats passed this law rather than that the Germans took all power into their own hands&quot;.

Stepinac again wrote to Artuković on 22 May to protest the race laws and their application to converted Jews, telling him that members of other races should not be discriminated against &quot;through no fault of their own.&quot; He wrote, &quot;We ... appeal to you to issue regulations so that even in the framework of antisemitic legislation, and similar legislation concerning Serbs, the principles of human dignity be preserved.&quot; Stepinac added: &quot;Everyone will certainly approve the attempt for the economy to be in national hands, not to allow a non-national and anti-national element to amass capital, or foreign elements to decide about the State and the people. But to take away any possibility of existence from members of other peoples or other races, and to brand them with the stamp of shame, this is an issue of humanity and a question of morality&quot;.

As Goldstein notes, Stepinac seemingly argued for &quot;humane&quot; race laws. On 24 May 1942, Stepinac condemned racial persecution in general terms, although he did not mention Serbs. He stated in a diocesan letter:

All men and all races are children of God; all without distinction. Those who are Gypsies, Black, European, or Aryan all have the same rights ... for this reason, the Catholic Church had always condemned, and continues to condemn, all injustice and all violence committed in the name of theories of class, race, or nationality. It is not permissible to persecute Gypsies or Jews because they are thought to be an inferior race.

In a sermon on 25 October 1942, he further commented on racial acceptance:

We affirm then that all peoples and races descend from God. In fact, there exists but one race ... The members of this race can be white or black, they can be separated by oceans or live on the opposing poles, [but] they remain first and foremost the race created by God, according to the precepts of natural law and positive Divine law as it is written in the hearts and minds of humans or revealed by Jesus Christ, the son of God, the sovereign of all peoples.

In response to criticisms by the Yugoslav government in exile, that the Church had not done enough to counter Ustaše crimes, in May 1943 Stepinac wrote a letter to the Papal secretary in which he acknowledged the crimes, yet praised the Ustaše, among other reasons, for fighting abortion and pornography, with Stepinac blaming Jews and Serbs for both.

In his homily of 31 October 1943, which some claim is his most resolute critique of the Ustaše, Stepinac first inveighed against abortion, the &quot;pagan fashions of today&#x27;s female world&quot; and &quot;all the licentiousness ... that has been observed ... at sea beaches and other bathing spots&quot;. He blames these &quot;sins&quot; for the fact that &quot;God like thunder today brings down not just cities and villages, but entire peoples&quot;. The speech&#x27;s primary theme is the defense of the Church&#x27;s actions, against those who &quot;accuse us of not having arisen in timely or appropriate fashion against the crimes in parts of our homeland&quot;. Stepinac states that &quot;the Church cannot force others to behave according to God&#x27;s laws&quot; and cannot be responsible for &quot;the hotheads in its own priestly ranks&quot;. He proclaims it was not the Church that &quot;created in the souls of people the dissatisfaction and insatiability which has produced such sad consequences&quot;, instead he blames &quot;certain circles, organizations, and members of other national groups&quot;, which some sources state is a reference to Serbs and perhaps Jews.

Stepinac then criticizes Communism, its denial of private property rights, its approval of divorce, negation of God, refusal to allow religious education in schools, etc. Finally at the end of the homily he states: &quot;The Catholic Church does not know races that lord over others, or slave races. The Catholic Church knows only races and peoples as the creatures of God, and if it values some more, it is those of noble heart, and not of stronger fist. For her, a king in the royal palace is a man, in the same way as the last pauper and gypsy under a tent ... The system of shooting hundreds of hostages for a crime in which no culprit can be found is a pagan system that never yielded a good fruit&quot;.

In this speech Stepinac condemns &quot;all the wrongdoing, all the killing of the innocent, all the burning of villages&quot;. Much of his public criticism was spoken after most of the genocides were already completed, and it became clear the Nazis and Ustaše would lose. These belated speeches were made before limited audiences, unlike his pastoral letter, condemning the Communists, that he ordered read from all the pulpits across Croatia, only 4 months after the Communists seized power. In a letter to the Vatican of May 1943, Stepinac still praised the Ustaše for the &quot;good things&quot; they had done, including the &quot;strict ban on all pornographic publications, which were first and foremost published by Jews and Orthodox!&quot;.

Stepinac was involved directly and indirectly in efforts to save Jews from persecution. Amiel Shomrony (Emil Schwartz), was the personal secretary of Miroslav Šalom Freiberger (the chief rabbi in Zagreb) until 1942. In the actions for saving Jews, Shomrony acted as the mediator between the chief rabbi and Stepinac. He later stated that he considered Stepinac &quot;truly blessed&quot; since he did the best he could for the Jews during the war. Allegedly the Ustaša government at this point agitated at the Holy See for him to be removed from the position of archbishop of Zagreb, this however was refused due to the fact that the Vatican did not recognize the Ustaše state (despite Italian pressure).

Stepinac and the papal nuncio to Belgrade mediated with Royal Italian, Hungarian and Bulgarian troops, urging that the Yugoslav Jews be allowed to take refuge in the occupied Balkan territories to avoid deportation. He also arranged for Jews to travel via these territories to the safe, neutral states of Turkey and Spain, along with Istanbul-based nuncio Angelo Roncalli. He sent some Jews for safety to Rev Dragutin Jeish, who was killed during the war by the Ustaše on suspicion of supporting the Partisans.

==== Mass killings and concentration camps ====

The Ustaše unleashed a reign of terror in which 80% of the Jews (30,000 victims) in the NDH were killed, as well as practically all the Roma (25,000 victims), and almost 20% of the Serb population (340,000 victims – see: Number of victims). As a military vicar, Stepinac dispensed blessings to the Ustaše armies. Stepinac initially responded to these mass killings with private letters of protest. Thus, on 14 May 1941, Stepinac received word of an Ustaše massacre of Serb villagers at Glina. On the same day, he wrote to Pavelić saying:

Just now I received news that the Ustaše in Glina executed without trial and investigation 260 Serbs. I know that the Serbs committed some major crimes in our homeland in these last twenty years. But I consider it my bishop&#x27;s responsibility to raise my voice and to say that this is not permitted according to Catholic teaching, which is why I ask that you undertake the most urgent measures on the entire territory of the Independent State of Croatia, so that not a single Serb is killed unless it is shown that he committed a crime warranting death. Otherwise, we will not be able to count on the blessing of heaven, without which we must perish.

According to Biondich, in the first weeks or even months after the establishment of the NDH, Stepinac may have not known that the atrocities perpetrated by the Ustaše were a key component of their plan. This view supposes that Stepinac considered the atrocities were either spontaneous or the result of so-called &quot;irresponsible elements&quot; who would be held to account by the authorities. His correspondence with Pavelić tends to suggest he did not believe that the Poglavnik would have sanctioned such actions. Although Stepinac was firmly opposed to the idea of Ustaše to establish a concentration camp within the borders of the Đakovo Bishop&#x27;s domain, the Đakovo concentration camp was established in the deserted flour mill owned by the Diocese of Đakovo on 1 December 1941.

On the other hand, Phayer writes, &quot;it is impossible to believe that Stepinac and the Vatican did not know that the Ustasha murders amounted to genocide&quot;, given the &quot;repression and terrorism of the Ustasha regime were without parallel in the history of Southeastern Europe&quot;. Stepinac clearly knew of the May 1941 Glina massacre, and early on that the Ustaše state was sending Jews, Serbs and others to concentration camps. Initially, Stepinac did not oppose these deportations of Jews and others to concentration camps as a matter of principle, but pleaded they be carried out &quot;humanely&quot;, by proposing to Pavelić, on 21 July 1941, the introduction of &quot;some particulars to mitigate the procedure: a) for people to be sent to camp in such a way to allow them to prepare what would be the most essential, to allow them to arrange their most urgent obligations both to their families and their jobs; b) for transport not to be in crowded sealed railway cars, especially to distant places; c) to give internees enough food; d) to provide those who are ill with medical treatment; e) to allow the most necessary food to be sent to them, and enable them to correspond with their families.&quot;.

After the release of left-wing activist Ante Ciliga from Jasenovac in January 1943, Stepinac requested a meeting with him to learn about what was occurring at the camp. After seven Slovene priests were killed at Jasenovac, Stepinac wrote to Pavelić on 24 February 1943, saying:

This is a shameful blot and crime which cries to heaven for revenge, as the whole Jasenovac camp is a shameful fault for the Independent State of Croatia ... the entire public, and especially the relatives of the killed priests, ask for compensation and satisfaction and ask that the killers, who are the greatest misfortune for Croatia, be brought before a court of justice.

These were still private protest letters. Although later in 1942 and 1943, Stepinac started to speak out more openly against the Ustaše genocides, this was after most of the genocides were already committed, and it became increasingly clear the Nazis and Ustaše will be defeated. Additionally, Stepinac never publicly condemned the numerically greatest Ustaše genocide, that against the Serbs, and Stepinac continued to support until the very end the Ustaše state that had committed these crimes. Addressing defenders of Stepinac&#x27;s more private approach, Ivo Goldstein notes that &quot;relatively more persecuted Jews were saved when high church dignitaries openly, energetically and in a principled manner opposed this persecution – as in France (especially the Archbishops of Toulouse and Lyon), the Netherlands, Italy and Denmark, and for a time even in Germany itself. Catholic bishops in Slovakia strongly opposed Nazi demands for radical deportations and thus saved the lives of many converted Jews, and the Orthodox Metropolitan Stefan in Sofia, by tireless public defense of Jewish lives, played a fundamental role in preventing even one Jew from being deported to the Nazi camps from Bulgaria.&quot;.

==== Deportations ====
Stepinac again wrote to Pavelić on 21 July 1941 in the wake of mass deportations of Jews and Serbs to concentration camps, stating he was sure that Pavelić was not aware of the atrocities, and that others might not be willing to tell him about them. He wrote that this situation meant there was an even greater obligation on Stepinac to bring them to Pavelić&#x27;s attention. Referring to Jews as &quot;non-Aryans&quot;, Stepinac wrote: &quot;I hear from many quarters that non-Aryans are being treated inhumanely and cruelly during deportations to concentration camps, and in the camps themselves; moreover, that children, the elderly and the sick are not exempt from such treatment.&quot; Stepinac urged Pavelić that some things be undertaken &quot;in the direction of easing the procedure: a) that they be sent to the camps in such a way that they be able to prepare the most necessary things, that they can arrange their most urgent obligations to family and service; b) that dispatch is not carried out in overcrowded sealed wagons, especially not to remote places; c) that internees are provided with sufficient food; d) that patients are provided with medical care; e) to allow the dispatch of essential foodstuffs and to facilitate correspondence with families.&quot;

Having heard that some of the deportees were recent converts to Catholicism, he had a duty to show greater concern regarding them. He asked that &quot;humane and Christian consideration ... be shown especially to weak old people, young and innocent children, and the sick.&quot; According to Biondich, it is highly likely that Stepinac shared these concerns with the Vatican. Goldstein, on the other hand, notes that in his letter to Pavelić, Stepinac did not question the deportation of Jews to concentration camps, instead only urged that these be carried out more &quot;humanely&quot;.

When deportation of Croatian Jews began, Stepinac and the papal envoy Giuseppe Marcone protested to Andrija Artukovic. Pope Pius XII had dispatched Marcone as Apostolic Visitor to Croatia, reportedly in order to assist Stepinac and the Croatian Episcopate in &quot;combating the evil influence of neo-pagan propaganda which could be exercised in the organization of the new state&quot;. Marcone served as Nuncio in all but name. Mancone reported to Rome on the deteriorating conditions for Croatian Jews, made representations on behalf of the Jews to Croatian officials, and transported Jewish children to safety in neutral Turkey.

==== Forced conversions ====
In a circular letter to his clergy, Stepinac initially insisted that conversion had to be done freely, and only after religious instruction. While this and subsequent regulations were designed to protect &quot;the church hierarchy against charges of promoting forced conversions&quot;, they also indicated &quot;the church was willing to cooperate with regime&#x27;s forced conversions, provided the canonical rules were followed&quot;. On 3 December 1941, Stepinac sent the pope a report, wherein he notes &quot;the best prospects exist for the conversions&quot;.

However, the church&#x27;s instructions were ignored by the Ustaše authorities. The authorities not only conducted forcible conversions, but on occasion they used the prospect of conversion as a means to gather Serbs together so they could kill them, which is what occurred at Glina. Some Serbs demanded that the local Catholic clergy convert them in order to save their lives. Later Stepinac advised individual priests to admit Orthodox believers to the Catholic Church if their lives were in danger, such that this conversion had no validity, allowing them to return to their faith once the danger passed.

On 18 May 1943, Stepinac wrote a letter to the pope, in which he estimated 240.000 conversions to date (despite some disputes Tomasevich states this letter is authentic). The Catholic Church in Croatia has also had to contend with criticism of what some have seen as a passive stance towards the Ustaša policy of religious conversion whereby some Serbs – but not the intelligentsia element – were able to escape other persecution by adopting the Catholic faith. According to Cornwell, through his role in the forced conversions, Stepinac displayed a &quot;moral dislocation&quot; that &quot;endorsed a contempt for religious freedom tantamount to complicity with the violence&quot;.

While Stepinac did suspend a number of priests, including Ivo Guberina and Zvonko Brekalo, he only had the authority to do so within his own diocese; he had no power to suspend other priests or bishops outside of Zagreb, as that power was reserved for the Vatican. Due to the arbitrary nature of justice in the NDH and the absence of proper systems for complaint and redress, people such as Stepinac developed an approach of intervening personally with senior government figures on behalf of victims.

===== Other crimes against the Serbian Orthodox Church =====
In addition to forced conversions, Tomasevich describes other elements of the &quot;Ustaše massive attack against the Serbian Orthodox Church&quot;. The Ustaše killed 157 Orthodox priests, among them 3 Serb Orthodox bishops (cutting the throat of the bishop of Banja Luka and killing the archbishop of Sarajevo), while they jailed and tortured the Orthodox archbishop of Zagreb, Dositej Vasić. The Ustaše expelled to Serbia 327 Orthodox priests and one bishop, while 2 other bishops and 12 priests left on their own. Thus 85% of the Orthodox priests in the Independent State of Croatia were either killed or expelled by the Ustaše, in order to &quot;leave the Orthodox population without spiritual leadership so the Ustašas&#x27; policy of forced or fear-induced conversions to Catholicism would be easier to carry out&quot;.

The Ustaše destroyed and desecrated numerous Orthodox Churches, forbade the Cyrillic script and Julian calendar (both used in the Orthodox Church), even prohibited the term &quot;Serbian Orthodox Church&quot;. Orthodox schools were shut down, and the Church was prohibited from collecting contributions from believers, robbing it of income. Orthodox Church properties were confiscated by the Ustaše, some turned over to the Croatian Catholic Church. Finally, to destroy the Serbian Orthodox Church, the Ustaše tried to create its own, alternative Croatian Orthodox Church, with an imported Russian priest. but failed to gain adherents.

Tomasevich states that this massive Ustaše attack on the Serbian Orthodox Church &quot;was approved and supported by many Croatian Catholic priests&quot;, and that the Croatian Roman Catholic Church hierarchy and the Vatican &quot;regarded Ustaše policies against the Serbs and Serbian Orthodox Church as advantageous to Roman Catholicism&quot;.

==== Overall assessments of Stepinac&#x27;s actions during WWII ====
Tomasevich assesses Stepinac&#x27;s wartime words and deeds in three categories: (1) Private actions to help certain individuals and groups, where he states Stepinac &quot;deserves highest praise, although his actions were not always successful&quot;, (2) Proclamations of general human rights, expressed in his sermons at first &quot;occasionally and mildly&quot;, but more strongly after 1943 (after the Ustashe had already perpetrated most of the genocides, and it was clear the Nazis and Ustashe would be defeated), also deserve praise, and (3) Statements dealing with overall Church policy toward the wartime Croatian state. Here Tomasevich states &quot;there are serious shortcomings in Stepinac&#x27;s statements and actions toward the Ustashe regime and its genocidal actions against the Serbs and the Serbian Orthodox Church&quot;.

Thus, despite the Ustashe genocide against the Serbs, the ethnic cleansing and forced conversions, the killings and expulsions of most Orthodox priests, the destruction and desecration of many Orthodox Churches, &quot;neither Archbishop Stepinac, nor any other Catholic bishop in the state ... uttered one word of public protest&quot; against these crimes. &quot;This was not a mere oversight. It was a deliberate policy&quot; as stated by the papal legate Abbot Marcone, when he wrote in 1943 that given the fact that most guerrillas were &quot;schismatics&quot; (i.e. Eastern-Orthodox Serbs) &quot;our Croatian episcopate does not have any special motive to protest publicly against the government in favor of the schismatics&quot;. In Stepinac&#x27;s case this was compounded by his &quot;dim view of Orthodoxy and thought that an unbridgeable gulf existed between Croats and Serbs&quot;. Additionally, given both Stepinac&#x27;s and the Vatican&#x27;s desire to see a Catholic state in Croatia and have a legate there, &quot;the Church had to refrain from publicly criticizing the government&#x27;s policies&quot;.

Tomasevich concludes &quot;the policy of the Croatian Catholic Church hierarchy and the Vatican of not publicly condemning the Ustasha regime&#x27;s actions during the war will probably remain controversial. From the standpoint of humanity, justice and common decency, it cannot be defended. But Stepinac was not the only one responsible for it, the Vatican was too&quot;.

Stella Alexander, author of &quot;The Triple Myth&quot;, a sympathetic biography of Stepinac, writes about him that

Two things stand out. He feared Communism above all (especially above fascism); and he found it hard to grasp that anything beyond the boundaries of Croatia, always excepting the Holy See, was quite real. ... He lived in the midst of apocalyptic events, bearing responsibilities which he had not sought. ... In the end one is left feeling that he was not quite great enough for his role. Given his limitations he behaved very well, certainly much better than most of his own people, and he grew in spiritual stature during the course of his long ordeal.

In another article, Stella Alexander writes the following:

From May 1942 he attacked the actions of the [ustaše] government in sermon after sermon, not only the forcible conversions but the anti-semitism and anti-Serbianism of the regime, the taking and shooting of hostages and the forcible breaking-up of Jewish-Gentile marriages, and he wrote bitterly to Pavelić about the conditions in the concentration camps, particularly the one at Jasenovac. He made repeated private interventions in individual cases, he refused to allow converted Jews to wear the yellow star in church, and he forbad military chaplains to administer the ustaSa oath if a crossed dagger and revolver were lying in front of the crucifix. Eventually he arranged for about 7,000 children, who were either orphans or had lost their families, to be accepted into Catholic homes, but forbad the clergy to baptize them into the Catholic Church. The ustaša authorities were furious with him, Pavelić detested him and according to Fr Masucci, secretary of the Vatican representative in Zagreb, asked the Vatican on three occasions to withdraw him. His friend Ivan Meštrović the sculptor, who met him in Rome during one of Stepinac&#x27;s visits to the Vatican, wrote later in his memoirs that Stepinac told him that he expected to be killed either by the ustaSe or the communists.

Mark Biondich stated that Stepinac was not an &quot;ardent supporter&quot; of the Ustaše regime legitimating their every policy, but neither was he an &quot;avowed opponent&quot; publicly denouncing their crimes in a systematic manner, that many of his defenders claim.

== Post-war period ==

The Allies recognized the new Tito–Šubašić Yugoslav government in 1944. In February 1945 the Zagreb Archdiocese newspaper reported that Stepinac and other Church dignitaries attended a congratulatory New Year&#x27;s reception at Pavelić&#x27;s, which included members of the Allied German Armed Forces, led by &quot;Generalfeldmarschall&quot; Maximilian von Weichs. On March 24, 1945, as the Partisans fought their final pitched battles against retreating German, NDH and other collaborationist forces, Stepinac and the Croatian bishops, at the behest of the Ustaše regime, issued a pastoral letter asking Croats to remain loyal to the NDH, and stand firm against the advancing Partisans. On April 10, 1945, Stepinac celebrated his last Te Deum for the NDH, which still had Race Laws, and was just then killing the last remaining 3,500 inmates, including 700-800 Jews, at the Jasenovac concentration camp. In the final days of the war Stepinac received and hid the archives of the Ustaše Ministry of Foreign Affairs, which later proved to contain gold stolen from concentration camp inmates.

Shortly after the fall of the NDH and during the surrender at Bleiburg, on 17 May 1945, Stepinac was effectively put under house arrest in Zagreb and was for the subsequent two weeks interviewed by Yugoslavia′s security, military judicial, and Communist party officials such as Veljko Drakulić, Vladimir Ranogajec, Antun Biber Tehek, whose aim was apparently to sound out his political stances with a view to finding a mode of political co-existence under the new regime.

On 2 June, Yugoslav leader Josip Broz Tito met with representatives of the Archdiocese of Zagreb, during which he advocated the idea that &quot;the Catholic Church could do more for the people if it was independent of the Vatican&quot; and more &quot;national&quot;, like the Serbian Orthodox Church. The following day, Archbishop Stepinac was released from custody. One day later, Stepinac met with Tito, during which Tito&#x27;s prime goal was to promote the idea of an autonomous Catholic Church for Yugoslavia with its own primate. This was consistent with the policy of the Yugoslav government in the immediate post-war period. The meeting with Tito, Vladimir Bakarić in attendance, on 4 June 1945 was written up in detail by Stepinac, both as a personal memo and as a report to Pope Pius XII.

On 22 June, the bishops of Croatia released a public letter accusing the Yugoslav authorities of injustices and crimes towards them. On 28 June, Stepinac wrote a letter to the government of Croatia asking for an end to the prosecution of Nazi collaborationists (collaboration having been widespread in occupied Yugoslavia) and prosecutions were being used by some as a pretext to settle old scores. On 10 July, Stepinac&#x27;s secretary, Stjepan Lacković, traveled to Rome. While he was there, the Yugoslav authorities forbade him to return. Lacković went instead to the United States.

In August, a new land reform law was introduced which legalized the confiscation of 85 percent of church holdings in Yugoslavia. During the same period the archbishop almost certainly had ties with the post-war Ustaše guerrillas, the &quot;Crusaders&quot;, and actively worked against the state. After fleeing with Pavelić, Erih Lisak, the last Ustaše chief of police, secretly returned to Croatia in September 1945, to organize remaining Ustaše forces hiding in forests, and he established contact with Stepinac&#x27;s office and Stepinac himself. Ante Moškov, a former Ustaše general, also contacted Stepinac, and the police discovered Ustaše files and gold hidden in the archbishopric cellars. Stepinac urged Tito to meet with representatives of the Croatian Peasant party and even the Ustaše to help heal the wounds of war.

In September 1945, a synod of the Bishops&#x27; Conference of Yugoslavia was held in Zagreb which discussed the confrontation with the government. On 20. September, Stepinac published a pastoral letter in which he stated that &quot;273 clergymen had been killed&quot; since the Partisan take-over, &quot;169 had been imprisoned&quot;, and another &quot;89 were missing and presumed dead&quot;. The bishops also criticized the virtual suppression of the Catholic press, the fact that religious education was restricted, the confiscation of the majority of church lands, and the confiscation of seminaries. They condemned all ideologies based on a materialist atheistic philosophy. They strongly condemned the introduction of civil marriages, in addition to church marriages.

Goldstein notes that Stepinac publicly, by name criticized the Communists even before they took power, with the pastoral letter of March 1945 read from all the pulpits across the NDH, again repeated with the pastoral letter of September 1945. This is very different from Stepinac&#x27;s criticisms of the Ustaše in front of limited audiences, never issuing a pastoral letter against the Ustaše, never even criticizing them by name, and only after the Ustaše had completed most of their genocides. Simultaneously, Stepinac continued to publicly support the same NDH which committed those crimes, until the very end. The pastoral letter&#x27;s extensive criticism of Communist actions against the Catholic Church, also contrasted with Stepinac&#x27;s complete silence, noted by Tomasevich, regarding the massive Ustaše attacks on the Serbian Orthodox Church - e.g. the Ustaše killing and exiling of 85% of Orthodox priests, efforts to eliminate the Serbian church and replace it with an Ustaše-created Orthodox church, etc.

In response to this letter Tito spoke out publicly against Stepinac for the first time by writing an editorial on 25 October in the communist party&#x27;s newspaper &quot;Borba&quot; accusing Stepinac of declaring war on the fledgling new Yugoslavia. Consequently, on 4 November a crowd of Partisans threw stones at Stepinac in Zaprešić. Tito had established &quot;brotherhood and unity&quot; as the federation&#x27;s overarching objective and central policy, one which he did not want threatened by internal agitation. In addition, with the escalating Cold War conflict and increased concerns over both Western and Soviet infiltration (see Tito–Stalin split), the Yugoslav government did not tolerate further internal subversion within the potentially fragile new federation.

In an effort to put a stop to the archbishop&#x27;s activities, Tito attempted to reach an accord with Stepinac, and achieve a greater degree of independence for the Catholic Church in Yugoslavia and Croatia. Stepinac refused to break from the Vatican, and continued to publicly condemn the communist government. Tito, however, was reluctant to bring him to trial, in spite of condemning evidence which was available. In January 1946 the federal government attempted to solicit his replacement with the Papal Nuncio in Belgrade, a request that was denied. Finally, Stepinac was himself asked to leave the country, which he refused. In September 1946 the Yugoslav authorities indicted Stepinac on multiple counts of war crimes and collaboration with the enemy during wartime. Milovan Đilas, a prominent leader in the Party, stated that Stepinac would never have been brought to trial &quot;had he not continued to oppose the new Communist regime.&quot; Stella Alexander suggests that Yugoslav authorities wished to balance the arrest and execution of Serb leader Draža Mihailović by moving against a prominent Croat; and in the words of the Public Prosecutor, &quot;to unmask before the world a concerted conspiracy by the western imperial powers against the new Yugoslavia&quot;.

Stepinac publicly condemned the new Yugoslav government and its actions during and after World War II, especially for murders of priests by Communist militants.

== Trial ==

By September of the same year the Yugoslav authorities indicted Stepinac on several counts—collaboration with the occupation forces, relations with the Ustaše regime, having chaplains in the Ustaše army as religious agitators, forced conversions of Serb Orthodox to Catholicism at gunpoint and high treason against the Yugoslav government. Stepinac was arrested on 18 September 1946 and his trial started on 30 September 1946, where he was tried alongside former officials of the Ustaše government including Erih Lisak (sentenced to death) and Ivan Šalić. Altogether there were 19 defendants.

The prosecution presented their evidence for the archbishop&#x27;s collaboration with the Ustaše regime. In relation to these events the prosecution pointed out that even if the archbishop did not explicitly order them, he also did nothing to stop them or punish those within the church who were responsible. The Court appointed two distinguished advocates to defend Stepinac – Dr. Politeo and Dr. Katicic. Stepinac defense acknowledged he paid courtesy calls on Pavelić and other Ustaše leaders as soon as they arrived, but this could be considered normal for the head of the Catholic Church. However, Alexander notes that Stepinac&#x27;s tone of welcome to Ustaše authorities could have left the clergy in no doubt that they were expected to cooperate with them. Alexander claims his lawyer defended him more convincingly on some other accusations, stating that Stepinac&#x27;s control over the censored Catholic press had been largely formal, and that he had no control outside his own diocese. When he was appointed NDH military vicar, Stepinac&#x27;s two deputies, both prominent Ustaše supporters, had already been appointed and it would&#x27;ve been virtually impossible for him to remove them. He had accepted Ustaše archives without examining them, and stowed them in the archbishopric, but later handed them over to the Partisans when they came looking for them. He admitted meeting with former Ustaše chief of police, Erih Lisak, who had secretly returned to Zagreb to fight the new authorities, but Stepinac blamed his secretary for the meeting. Alexander states that Stepinac seemed most uncertain when defending himself against the most serious accusations of forced conversions of the Serbian Orthodox population to Catholicism.

On 3 October as part of the fourth day of the proceedings, Stepinac gave a lengthy 38-minute speech during which he laid down his views on the legitimacy of the trial. He claimed that the process was a &quot;show trial&quot;, that he was being attacked in order for the state to attack the Church, and that &quot;no religious conversions were done in bad faith&quot;. He went on to state that &quot;My conscience is clear and calm. If you will not give me the right, history will give me that right&quot;, and that he did not intend to defend himself or appeal against a conviction, and that he is prepared to take ridicule, disdain, humiliation, and death for his beliefs. He claimed that the military vicariate in the Independent State of Croatia was created to address the needs of the faithful among the soldiers and not for the army itself, nor as a sign of approval of all action by the army. He stated that he was never an Ustaša and that his Croatian nationalism stemmed from the nation&#x27;s grievances in the Serb-dominated Kingdom of Yugoslavia, and that he never took part in any anti-government or terrorist activities against the state or against Serbs.

Stepinac also pointed to the fact that Yugoslav communists killed a great number of Catholic priests - on 20 September 1945 he already published a letter to the faithful where he brought to light the fact that at least 243 Catholic priests were summarily executed by the communist Yugoslav army for (alleged or real) collaboration with the NDH, with other 169 imprisoned and 89 missing priests. Tomasevich notes that all sides killed priests, starting first with the Ustaše who killed 157 Orthodox priests, including 3 Orthodox bishops. They jailed, tortured and expelled to Serbia the Orthodox archbishop of Zagreb, along with 327 more Orthodox priests. Yet Tomasevich writes that neither Stepinac nor anyone else in the Catholic Church hierarchy uttered a single word of protest against these killings and other massive attacks on the Orthodox church. On the contrary, Tomasevich states that the massive Ustaše attack on the Serbian Orthodox Church &quot;was approved and supported by many Croatian Catholic priests&quot; He also writes that in the NDH some Catholic priests joined the Ustaše, serving in the Ustaše government apparatus, others denounced Partisans, causing their death or deportation to concentration camps, a few became Ustaše officers serving in concentration camps. Above all, Catholic priests engaged in propaganda work for the Ustaše state. Tomasevich notes that most priests killed in the war&#x27;s aftermath were not killed because they belonged to a specific religion, but because they were participants in a civil war.
Stepinac was arrested on 18 September, and was only given the indictment on the 23rd−meaning his defense counsel Ivo Politeo was given only six to seven days to prepare. Stepinac&#x27;s defense counsel was only allowed to call twenty witnesses—while the prosecution was allowed to call fifty-eight, most from outside Stepinac&#x27;s diocese. The President of the Court refused to hear fourteen witnesses for the defense.

On 11 October 1946, the court found Stepinac guilty of collaboration with the fascist Ustaše regime. He was sentenced to 16 years in prison. He served five years in the prison at Lepoglava until he was released in a conciliatory gesture by Tito, on condition that he either retire to Rome or be confined to his home parish of Krašić. He chose to stay in Krašić, saying he would never leave &quot;unless they put me on a plane by force and take me over the frontier.&quot;

According to Biondich, Stepinac&#x27;s conviction for high treason was political, given that the Yugoslav authorities had a vested interest in it. Professor Bogdan Kolar of the University of Ljubljana notes that the chief trial prosecutor, Jakov Blažević, admitted in a 1985 interview with the Slovenian magazine &quot;Polet&quot; that &quot;Stepinac&#x27;s only crime was not partaking in the separation of the Church in Croatia from the Vatican.&quot;

Tomasevich writes that the government&#x27;s failure to provide the media and historians full access to all pre-trial and trial materials, puts Stepinac&#x27;s guilt in question. At the same time Tomasevich notes that Stepinac&#x27;s failure to publicly condemn the Ustaše&#x27;s genocidal measures against Serbs and the Orthodox Church, &quot;cannot be defended from the standpoint of humanity, justice and common decency&quot;. On the other hand, John Fine states that the trial &quot;was well publicized both at home and abroad by extremely biased figures on both sides, was carried out with the proper legal procedures; there was no torture and a great deal of evidence was brought before the judges, a considerable amount of which was devastating and accurate, and clearly demonstrated the archbishop&#x27;s collaboration with the Ustaše regime.&quot;

The Yugoslav Communist trial against Stepinac&#x27;s is seen by some as a part of coordinated effort by the Eastern Europe communist regimes to severe Catholic Church in their countries from Rome, and was near contemporaneous with the Communist trials against the Cardinals Josyf Slipyj of Ukraine, József Mindszenty of Hungary, Josef Beran of Czechoslovakia, and Stefan Wyszyński of Poland.

=== Reactions ===
In the escalating Cold War atmosphere, and with the Vatican putting forward worldwide publicity, the trial was depicted in the West as a typical communist &quot;show trial&quot;, in which the testimony was all false. The trial was immediately condemned by the Holy See. All Catholics who had taken part in the court proceedings, including most of the jury members, were excommunicated by Pope Pius XII who referred to the process as the &quot;saddest trial&quot; (&quot;tristissimo processo&quot;).

In the United States, one of Stepinac&#x27;s biggest supporters was the Archbishop of Boston, Richard Cushing, who delivered several sermons in support of him. U.S. Acting Secretary of State Dean Acheson on 11 October 1946 bemoaned the conditions in Yugoslavia and stated his regret of the trial.

The National Conference of Christians and Jews at the Bronx Round Table adopted a unanimous resolution on 13 October condemning the trial:

This great churchman has been charged with being a collaborator with the Nazis. We Jews deny that. We know from his record since 1934, that he was a true friend of the Jews ... This man, now the victim of a sham trial, all during the Nazi regime spoke out openly, unafraid, against the dreadful Nuremberg Laws, and his opposition to the Nazi terrorism was never relaxed.

In Britain, on 23 October 1946, Richard Stokes MP declared in the House of Commons that,

[T]he archbishop was our constant ally in 1941, during the worst of the crisis, and thereafter, at a time when the Orthodox Church, which is now &quot;comme il faut&quot; with the Tito Government, was shaking hands with Mussolini.

On 1 November 1946 Winston Churchill addressed the House of Commons on the subject of the trial, expressing &quot;great sadness&quot; at the result.

This trial was prepared in the political sphere. It was for the purpose of dividing the Catholic Church in Croatia from its leadership at the Vatican. Tito has openly expressed this purpose. ... The trial was not based on justice, but was an outrage on justice. Tito&#x27;s regime has no interest in justice. It seeks only to stifle opposition.

===Annulment of the verdict===
On 22 July 2016, Zagreb County Court annulled the verdict in the review process, as requested by the Archbishop&#x27;s nephew Boris Stepinac, &quot;due to gross violations of current and former fundamental principles of substantive and procedural criminal law&quot;. While explaining the verdict, Judge Ivan Turudić stated that the verdict had violated the principle of the right to a fair trial, appeal and a reasoned court decision, as well as the principle of the prohibition of forced labour and the rule of law, adding that it was enough to read some parts of the minutes of the trial, which demonstrated that the court mainly analyzed evidence that instructed witnesses for the prosecution to charge the defendant and that the actual decision in reality was not made by the court but by prosecutor Jakov Blažević. In conclusion, Turudić stated that the verdict has been revised after nearly 70 years which has a profound significance for the history of the Croatian people. This annulment is, however, highly controversial due to its overtly nationalist Croatian sentiments, the fact that lower court (County Court of Zagreb) annuls the verdict of the Supreme Court, the fact that the whole process of annulment was over in only six days, prosecution was on the same side with the defense (they did not appeal on the annulment) and the judge, who is openly anticommunist, obviously made his decision before the start of the trial. Thus, this annulment can be seen as an example of a show trial.

The Simon Wiesenthal Center strongly condemned the annulment, stating Stepinac &quot;openly supported the regime which committed mass murder, and afforded them spiritual comfort and support... Right now in Croatia there is a cultural, ideological war,&quot; with a segment seeking to whitewash or modify the crimes of the Ustasha. The head of the Wiesenthal Center, Efraim Zuroff, also stated that annulment in Croatia was part of a much wider phenomenon, which he has also observed in Ukraine, Lithuania and Hungary – &quot;the tendency to honor people who fought communism, without checking what they did in WWII.&quot; Following the annulment, the Yad Vashem Center reaffirmed that the reason for the Committee for the Designation of the Righteous Among the Nations did not grant Stepinac Righteous status &quot;was due to the archbishop&#x27;s close ties to the Ustasha regime.&quot;

==Imprisonment==
In Stepinac&#x27;s absence, the Archbishop of Belgrade Josip Ujčić became acting president of the Bishops&#x27; Conference of Yugoslavia, a position he held until Stepinac&#x27;s death. In March 1947 the president of the government of the People&#x27;s Republic of Croatia Vladimir Bakarić made an official visit to Lepoglava prison to see Stepinac.

He offered that he sign a plea for amnesty to Yugoslavia&#x27;s leader Josip Broz, who would, in turn, allow Stepinac to leave the country. Instead, Stepinac gave Bakarić a request to Broz that he be retried by a neutral court. He also offered to explain his actions to the Croatian people on the largest square in Zagreb. A positive response was not received from either request. During his imprisonment, Stepinac condemned the &quot;clerical societies&quot; being encouraged by the government as a way of developing more &quot;nationally-aligned&quot; churches.

The 1947 pilgrimage to Marija Bistrica attracted 75,000 people. Dragutin Saili had been in charge of the pilgrimage on the part of the Yugoslav authorities. At a meeting of the Central Committee on 1 August 1947 Saili was chastised for allowing pictures of Stepinac to be carried during the pilgrimage, as long as the pictures were alongside those of Yugoslav leader Josip Broz. Marko Belinić responded to the report by saying, &quot;Saili&#x27;s path, his poor cooperation with the Local Committee, is a deadly thing&quot;.

In February 1949, the United States House of Representatives approved a resolution condemning Stepinac&#x27;s imprisonment, with the Senate following suit several months later. Aloysius Stepinac eventually served five years of his sixteen-year sentence for high treason in the Lepoglava prison, where he received preferred treatment in recognition of his clerical status. He was allocated two cells for personal use and an additional cell as his private chapel, while being exempt of all hard labor.

In 1950 the noted Irish essayist and historian, Hubert Butler, and Quaker friends managed to visit Stepinac in prison. Troubled by the Catholic Church&#x27;s support of the Ustaše, and the Church&#x27;s role in the wartime conversions of Orthodox to Catholicism, Butler asked Stepinac why he had appointed as his deputy on conversions, the bishop Josip Šimrak, an enthusiastic advocate of converting the Orthodox. To which Butler noted, &quot;the archbishop gave the stock reply he had so often given at the trial – &quot;notre conscience est tranquille&quot; (our conscience is clear).&quot;

In 1950, a group of United States senators made foreign aid to Yugoslavia conditional on Stepinac&#x27;s release. On 11 November 1951, Cyrus L. Sulzberger from &quot;The New York Times&quot; visited Stepinac in Lepoglava. He won the Pulitzer Prize for the interview.

A visiting congressional delegation from the United States, including Clement J. Zablocki and Edna F. Kelly, pressed to see Stepinac in late November 1951. Their request was denied by the Yugoslav authorities, but Josip Broz Tito assured the delegation that Stepinac would be released within a month. Stepinac was released as a precondition for American aid, on the condition that he either retire to Rome or be confined to his home parish of Krašić. He refused to leave Yugoslavia and opted to live in Krašić under a form of house arrest, to which he was transferred on 5 December 1951. Among the reporters awaiting Stepinac in his native Krasic were those from the American Time Magazine, who reported that Stepinac &quot;walked easily and firmly&quot;, stating of his prison days that &quot;he was not maltreated, could say Mass, have visitors, books and newspapers&quot;. When asked about the conditions of his release, Stepinac responded: &quot;I was not released under any conditions. They released me on their own wish...The reason I did not ask to be released is that I don&#x27;t feel guilty.&quot; He lived in the parish presbytery and was able to say Mass in the adjacent church. He stated that: &quot;They will never make me leave unless they put me on a plane by force and take me over the frontier. It is my duty in these difficult times to stay with the people.&quot;

At a meeting of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Croatia on 5 October 1951, Ivan Krajačić said, &quot;In America they are printing &quot;Crvena ruža na oltaru&quot; [&quot;Red Roses on the Altar&quot;] of 350 pages, in which is described the entire Stepinac process. Religious education is particularly recently being taught on a large scale. We should do something about this. We could ban religious education. We could ban religious education in schools, but they will then pass it into their churches&quot;. On 31 January 1952 the Yugoslav authorities abolished religious education in state-run public schools, as part of the programme of separating church and state in Yugoslavia. In April, Stepinac told a journalist from Belgium&#x27;s &quot;La Liberté&quot;, &quot;I am greatly concerned about Catholic youth. In schools they are carrying out intensive communist propaganda, based on negating the truth&quot;.

== Cardinalate ==
On 29 November 1952, Pope Pius XII announced he would make Stepinac a cardinal in January 1953; the day coincided with Yugoslavia&#x27;s Republic Day. Stepinac did not attend the ceremony on 12 January 1953, afraid that if he travelled to Rome he would not be allowed to return to Yugoslavia. Pope Pius XII had intended to name Stepinac the first cardinal-priest of San Paolo alla Regola. On 21 December 2020, Cardinal Francesco Monterisi, who then held the title, dedicated a plaque placed at the church to honor Stepinac.

Yugoslavia severed diplomatic relations with the Vatican in October 1953. In 1954, Stepinac received a rare visit from a Swedish journalist, to whom he said, &quot;I tried to save, and did save, thousands of lives&quot;, and &quot;[a]s for the massacres in the churches, what could I do?&quot; The government also expelled the Catholic Faculty of Theology from the University of Zagreb, to which it was not restored until the first democratic elections were held in 1990, and was finally formalized in 1996.

Pope Pius wrote to Stepinac and three other jailed prelates (Cardinals Stefan Wyszyński and József Mindszenty, and Archbishop Josef Beran) on 29 June 1956 urging their supporters to remain loyal. Stepinac was prevented by his house arrest from participating in the 1958 conclave to elect a new pope, despite calls from the Bishops&#x27; Conference of Yugoslavia for his release. On 2 June 1959 he wrote in a letter to Ivan Meštrović: &quot;I likely will not live to see the collapse of communism in the world due to my poor health. But I am absolutely certain of that collapse.&quot;

==Death and canonisation controversies==
In 1953, two American medical specialists, Dr. John H. Lawrence and Dr. John Ruzic, flew to Yugoslavia and diagnosed Stepinac with polycythemia, a disease marked by an increase in red blood cells. Stepinac was also treated for the disease by internationally known German hematologist, Dr. Ludwig Heilmeyer. On 10 February 1960 at the age of 61, Stepinac died of a thrombosis. The government, which had never acknowledged his status as a cardinal, first planned a small funeral service and burial in Krasic, his native village which few were allowed to visit, but then allowed a large-scale public funeral, a reversal seen as an attempt to improve relations with the Vatican. He was buried in the Zagreb Cathedral following a service in which the protocols appropriate to his senior clerical status were, with Tito&#x27;s permission, fully observed. Archbishop Franjo Seper, who became archbishop of Zagreb upon Stepinac&#x27;s death, presided in place of Cardinal Franz König, Archbishop of Vienna, who was scheduled to preside, but was injured in a traffic accident en route. Pope John XXIII participated in a requiem mass for Stepinac on 17 February in St Peter&#x27;s Basilica. The Yugoslav government&#x27;s relations with the Vatican improved after Stepinac&#x27;s death, and developed further after the Second Vatican Council of 1962–65. Diplomatic relations were restored in 1966. Though Stepinac died peacefully at home, he was viewed as a martyr by his supporters and many other Catholics. In 1998, traces of arsenic were detected in Stepinac&#x27;s bones, leading many to believe he had been poisoned by his captors. But the administration of arsenic along with bloodletting was a standard treatment for polycythemia in the early 1950s.

Meštrović did not return to Yugoslavia until 1959 and upon his return met again with Stepinac, who was then under house arrest. Meštrović sculpted a bust of Stepinac after his death with an inscription that reads: &quot;Archbishop Stepinac was not a man of idle words, but rather, he actively helped every person─when he was able, and to the extent he was able. He made no distinctions as to whether a man in need was a Croat or a Serb, whether he was a Catholic or an Orthodox, whether he was Christian or non-Christian. All the attacks upon him be they the product of misinformation, or the product of a clouded mind, cannot change this fact.&quot;

In 1970, &quot;Glas Koncila&quot; published a text on Stepinac taken from &quot;L&#x27;Osservatore Romano&quot; which resulted in the edition being confiscated by court decree.

In May 1979, Archbishop Franjo Kuharić told Croatian pilgrims and Pope John Paul II at St. Peter&#x27;s Basilica in Rome that Cardinal Stepinac should be beatified. The beatification process began on 9 October 1981. The Catholic Church declared Stepinac a martyr on 11 November 1997, and on 3 October 1998 Pope John Paul II, on pilgrimage to Marija Bistrica to beatify Stepinac, declared that Stepinac had indeed been martyred. John Paul had earlier determined that where a candidate for sainthood had been martyred, his/her cause could be advanced without the normal requirement for evidence of a miraculous intercession by the candidate. Accordingly, he beatified him.

The beatification re-ignited old divisions between Serbs, who are mainly Eastern Orthodox, and Croats. Shortly prior, the Paris-based Simon Wiesenthal Center requested that the Holy See delay the beatification until the case was given further study; the ask served only to infuriate Croatian officials as well as the Vatican.

According to Ljubojević, Gavrilović and Perica, the mythology regarding Stepinac was created during the Cold War and newly independent Croatia with the cardinal&#x27;s beatification in 1998. Their assessment is that this myth positioned Stepinac as the primary character in Croatian mythology, crediting him as a hero and martyr who was politically impartial. This myth alleges that Stepinac resisted all forms of totalitarianism in equal measure. The authors claim that Stepinac was a much greater opponent of communism than he was of Nazism and fascism, and that his story was used by Croatian President Franjo Tudjman to legitimise Croatian independence and to bolster the role of the Catholic Church as a central pillar of Croatian statehood.

In May 2019, Pope Francis said he had sought advice and help of the &quot;great&quot; Serbian Orthodox Patriarch Irenaeus on the canonization issue. Archbishop Želimir Puljić, president of the Croatian Conference of Bishops stated that the involvement of the Serbian Orthodox Church in Stepinac&#x27;s canonisation would set a negative precedent in the Catholic Church. Mile Bigović, Bishop Emeritus of Gospić-Senj, called such a move on the part of the pope &quot;not good for the Church&quot;.

Vatican Secretary of State Cardinal Pietro Parolin addressed the issue during a visit to Croatia in September 2020. His remarks were interpreted by Croatian commentators and prelates as a clear indication that there would be no progress in Stepinac&#x27;s cause under Pope Francis.

== Legacy ==

On 14 February 1992, Croatian representative Vladimir Šeks put forth a declaration in the Croatian Sabor condemning the court decision and the process that led to it. The declaration was passed, along with a similar one about the death of Croatian communist official Andrija Hebrang. The declaration states that the true reason of Stepinac&#x27;s imprisonment was his pointing out many communist crimes and especially refusing to form a Croatian Catholic Church in schism with the Pope. The verdict has not been formally challenged nor overturned in any court between 1997 and 1999 while it was possible under Croatian law. In 1998, the Croatian National Bank released commemoratives 500 kuna gold and 150 kuna silver coins.

In 2007, the municipality of Marija Bistrica began on a project called &quot;Stepinac&#x27;s Path&quot;, which would build pilgrimage paths linking places significant to the cardinal: Krašić, Kaptol in Zagreb, Medvednica, Marija Bistrica, and Lepoglava. The Aloysius Stepinac Museum opened in Zagreb in 2007.

Croatian football international Dario Šimić wore a T-shirt with Stepinac&#x27;s image on it under his jersey during the country&#x27;s UEFA Euro 2008 game against Poland, which he revealed after the game.

In 2008, a total of 119 streets in Croatia were named after Alojzije Stepinac, making him the tenth most common person eponym of streets in the country.

=== Nomination to Righteous Among the Nations Declined ===

Several Croatian Jews (including Esther Gitman, a Jew from Sarajevo living in the USA) recommended that Stepinac be added to the list of the Righteous Among the Nations because he saved some Jews on condition of conversion to Catholicism. Yad Vashem declined, and replied: &quot;Persons who assisted Jews but simultaneously collaborated or were linked with a fascist regime which took part in the Nazi-orchestrated persecution of Jews, are disqualified for the Righteous title.&quot;

==Primary sources==
Although Stepinac&#x27;s life has been the subject of much writing, there are very few primary sources for researchers to draw upon, the main one being the &quot;Katolički List&quot;, a diocesan weekly journal.

Stepinac&#x27;s diary, discovered in 1950 (too late to be used in his trial), was confiscated by the Yugoslav authorities. Franjo Tudjman returned the diary to the Church in the early 1990s. Croatian historian, Zvonimir Despot, notes that 30 year&#x27;s later the Church has still not published the diary. Juraj Batelja, the official Church Postulator advocating Stepinac&#x27;s canonization, has for years selectively used parts of the diary for his books, without other researchers having an opportunity to see the original text. Despot notes that Stepinac did not write the diary as a private person, but as the Archbishop, and the diary is an extremely important source for Croatian history. Despot concludes by asking, &quot;why is the diary kept secret to this day, under lock and key? Who is hiding what and why?&quot;

Father Josip Vranković kept a diary from December 1951 to 10 February 1960, recording what Stepinac related to him each day; that diary was used by Franciscan Aleksa Benigar to write a biography of Stepinac, but Benigar refused to share the diary with any other researcher. The diocesan archives were also made available to Benigar, but no other researcher.

The official transcript of Stepinac&#x27;s trial &quot;Suđenje Lisaku, Stepincu&quot; etc. was published in Zagreb in 1946, but contains substantial evidence of alteration. Alexander&#x27;s &quot;Triple Myth&quot; therefore relies on the Yugoslav and foreign press—particularly &quot;Vjesnik&quot; and &quot;Narodne Novine&quot;—as well as &quot;Katolički List&quot;. All other primary sources available to researchers only indirectly focus on Stepinac.

<text>Ross Shaw Sterling (February 11, 1875March 25, 1949) was an American politician who was the 31st Governor of Texas, serving a single two-year term from January 20, 1931, to January 17, 1933.

==Early years==
Sterling was born in Anahuac in Chambers County near Houston, Texas. He grew up on a farm and, after little formal education, began working as a clerk at the age of 12.

==Career==
At the age of 21, Sterling launched his own merchandising business. In 1911, his brother Frank Sterling, other oilmen, and he formed the Humble Oil Company, a predecessor of present-day Exxon-Mobil. They were joined in the venture by their sister, Florence M. Sterling. Sterling and his brother Frank and his sister, Florence, were referred to as the &quot;Trio&quot;.

In addition to the oil industry, Sterling was involved in a railroad company, the former &quot;Houston Post&quot; newspaper, banking, and real estate in the Houston area. He was a member of the Houston Port Commission. He served as chairman of the Texas Highway Commission under his predecessor, Governor Dan Moody.

==Public service==
A Democrat, Sterling defeated former Governor Miriam &quot;Ma&quot; Ferguson and several other candidates in the 1930 primary race for governor. During Sterling&#x27;s term in office, the East Texas oil fields experienced rapid and uncontrolled development. The Railroad Commission of Texas attempted proration, but the courts struck down the plan. Because of the chaotic situation, Sterling declared martial law in four counties for six months. National Guard troops were sent to the oil fields to limit waste and control production. This action was later declared unwarranted by the federal district court and the U.S. Supreme Court, and the Railroad Commission&#x27;s plan for proration was accepted. Cotton prices continued to decline during Sterling&#x27;s term in office.

Sterling&#x27;s loss in the 1932 primary was the closest primary defeat for an incumbent governor in United States history.

==Personal life and death==

He wed Maud Abbie Gage on October 10, 1898.

Sterling died in Fort Worth on March 25, 1949, and is buried at Glenwood Cemetery in Houston.

Three Texas schools are named after him, Sterling High School in Baytown, Sterling High School in Houston, and Ross Sterling Middle School in Humble, Texas. In addition, his grand-nephew, Ross N. Sterling, a Republican, became a United States federal judge in Texas under appointment of U.S. President Gerald R. Ford Jr.

In 1925, Sterling&#x27;s daughter Mildred married the prominent architect Wyatt C. Hedrick of Fort Worth.

Sterling&#x27;s former house, built about 1910, was moved in 1999 from 106 Westheimer Road to the intersection of Bagby and Rosalie to undergo restoration. 
In 2015 it opened as a bar &amp; restaurant called Sterling House

<text>John Ewart Wallace Sterling (August 6, 1906 – July 1, 1985) was an American educator who served as the 5th President of Stanford University between 1949 and 1968.

==Life and career==
Sterling was born in Linwood, Ontario, the son of Annie (née Wallace) and William Sterling, a Methodist clergyman. He pursued his undergraduate studies at the University of Toronto and received a Master of Arts degree from the University of Alberta. Sterling played football and basketball at the University of Toronto and coached both sports at Alberta.

He began his doctoral studies in history at Stanford University in 1932, serving on the research staff of the Hoover Institution. He received a Ph.D. in 1938 with a dissertation on &quot;Diplomacy and the newspaper press in Austria Hungary, Midsummer 1914.&quot; It was never published. He joined the faculty of the California Institute of Technology. In 1948, he left Caltech to head the Huntington Library and Art Gallery and shortly afterward was offered the Stanford presidency.

Sterling was married to Anna Maria Shaver.

===Stanford presidency===
During his 20-year term as president he oversaw the growth of Stanford from a financially troubled regional university to a financially sound, internationally recognized academic powerhouse, &quot;the Harvard of the West&quot;. Achievements during his tenure included:
*Moving the Stanford Medical School from a small, inadequate campus in San Francisco to a new facility on the Stanford campus which was fully integrated into the university to an unusual degree for medical schools.
*Establishing the Stanford Industrial Park (now the Stanford Research Park) and the Stanford Shopping Center on leased University land, thus stabilizing the university&#x27;s finances. The Stanford Industrial Park, together with the university&#x27;s aggressive pursuit of government research grants, helped to spur the development of Silicon Valley.
*Increasing the number of students receiving financial aid from less than 5% when he took office to more than one-third when he retired.
*Increasing the size of the student body from 8,300 to 11,300 and the size of the tenured faculty from 322 to 974.
*Launching the PACE fundraising program, the largest such program ever undertaken by any university up to that time.
*Launching a building boom on campus that included a new bookstore, post office, student union, dormitories, a faculty club, and many academic buildings.
*Creating the Overseas Campus program for undergraduates in 1958.
In 2022, Stanford University issued a public apology for its discrimination against Jewish applicants in the 1950s, which was documented through internal memos involving Sterling.

==Memorials==
*On March 2, 2015, Stanford Archives posted 444 images of Sterling and his papers to its Flickr stream.
*An Indian rubber tree (&quot;Ficus elastica cv. doescheri&quot;), which he planted at the opening of the University of Hawaiʻi at Mānoa&#x27;s Sinclair Library, is listed by the UHM Campus Arboretum as the J. E. Wallace Sterling Namesake Tree.

<text>Henry II (June 1270 – 31 March 1324) was the last crowned King of Jerusalem (after the fall of Acre on 28 May 1291, this title became empty) and also ruled as King of Cyprus. He was of the Lusignan dynasty.

He was the second surviving son of Hugh III and succeeded his brother John I on 20 May 1285; there was some suspicion that Henry had been involved in poisoning John. He was crowned at Santa Sophia, Nicosia, 24 June 1285. Charles of Anjou, who contested John&#x27;s claim to the throne, had died in 1285, allowing Henry to recover Acre from the Angevins. With a fleet Henry attacked Acre, defended by Charles&#x27; lieutenant Hugh Pelerin, and the city was captured on 29 July 1285. Henry had himself crowned King of Jerusalem there on 15 August 1286, but returned to Cyprus and appointed his uncle Philip of Ibelin as Bailiff in his absence. By this time Acre was one of the few coastal cities remaining in the remnant of the Kingdom of Jerusalem. During his reign the Mameluks captured Tyre, Beirut, and the rest of the cities, and destroyed the similarly weakened County of Tripoli in 1289. The final siege of Acre began on 5 April 1291 with Henry present in the city. He escaped to Cyprus with most of his nobles, and the city fell to Khalil on 28 May 1291.

Henry continued to rule as King of Cyprus, and continued to claim the kingdom of Jerusalem as well, often planning to recover the former territory on the mainland. He attempted a coordinated military operation in 1299/1300 with Ghazan, the Mongol Ilkhan of Persia, when Ghazan invaded Mameluk territory in 1299 (see Franco-Mongol alliance); he tried to stop Genoese ships from trading with the Mameluks, hoping to weaken them economically; and he twice wrote to Pope Clement V asking for a new crusade. His reign in Cyprus was prosperous and wealthy, and he was very much involved with the justice and administration of the kingdom – he had the &quot;Haute Cour&quot; keep written records for the first time (in Italian or French, rather than Latin), and extended the court&#x27;s role from a feudal advisory body to a true court responsible for trying and punishing criminals. However, Cyprus was in no position to fulfill his true ambition, the recovery of the Holy Land. He suffered from epilepsy, which at times incapacitated him, and his nobles were unsatisfied with him. He had his brother Guy, the Constable of Cyprus, put to death in 1303 for conspiring against him. In 1306 his brother Amalric, Lord of Tyre, Constable of Jerusalem, conspired with the Templars to remove him from power. However, Amalric assumed the title of Governor and Regent of Cyprus, rather than of King. Henry was deposed on 26 April 1306 and exiled to Armenia, where King Oshin of Armenia was Amalric&#x27;s brother-in-law. However, upon the murder of Amalric in 1310, Oshin released Henry, who returned to Cyprus and resumed his throne with the aid of the Hospitallers on 26 August 1310, imprisoning many of Amalric&#x27;s co-conspirators, including their brother Constable Aimery, brother-in-law Balian II of Ibelin, Prince of Galilee, and other relatives of Balian. In 1313, he oversaw the dissolution of the Templars in Cyprus and the transfer of their property to the Hospitallers.

He married Constance of Sicily (1303/1307 – in Cyprus after 19 June 1344), daughter of Frederick III of Sicily and Eleanor of Anjou, at Santa Sophia, Nicosia, on 16 October 1317 but they didn&#x27;t have any children. She later married Leon V of Armenia and John of Lusignan, titular Prince of Antioch.

Henry died on 31 March 1324 at his Villa in Strovolos, near Nicosia, was buried at the Franciscan Church of Nicosia and was succeeded by his nephew Hugh IV.

<text>John Reford Ewart (26 February 1928 – 8 March 1994) was an Australian actor of radio, stage, television and film. Ewart was a double nominee (and one/time winner) of the AACTA Award for Best Actor in a Supporting Role

==Early life==
Ewart was born in Melbourne, Victoria to Alfred Adam Ewart, an insurance agent and his wife Jennie Grace Madge Lois (nee Macauley).

==Career==
Ewart began his acting career when he was cast as Dopey at the age four in a 3XY radio production of &quot;Snow White&quot;. At the age of 18, he made his film debut in the lead role of Mickey O&#x27;Riordan in Charles Chauvel&#x27;s production of &quot;Sons of Matthew&quot;.

Ewart appeared in hundreds of Australian radio, theatre, film and television productions. To many thousands of Australians who grew up in the 1950s and &#x27;60s, he will be remembered as &#x27;Jimmy&#x27;, the boyishly cheeky co-presenter of the ABC Radio &quot;Children&#x27;s Session&quot;, and in the title role of its long-running serial &quot;The Muddle-Headed Wombat&quot;.

He was well known for his role in the film &quot;Sunday Too Far Away&quot;, his ongoing role in the Australian TV series &quot;The Restless Years&quot; in 1980–81, and his lead role opposite Nicole Kidman in &quot;Bush Christmas&quot;. He was proudest of his starring role in the 1977 film &quot;The Picture Show Man&quot;.

==Personal life==
Ewart married four times, firstly to Lorraine Marie Croke, a Sydney beauty consultant in May 1951 and had twins, a son and a daughter, but divorced a few years later, he then married Susan Mary Newton, a classical singer and actress on radio, stage and TV on 17 April 1966, with whom he had two daughters. They divorced in 1978. On 24 December, he married public relations consultant Patricia De Heer. 

In 1992 he became engaged to TV presenter Jane Fennell, but they postponed the wedding after the death of her father, Ewart&#x27;s long time friend Willie Fennell. They were married on 8 March 1994 in a bedside ceremony as Ewart was dying of throat cancer. He died five days after the wedding.

<doc id="789627" wikidata="Q702996" url="?curid=789627" title="Scrapped Princess">
<text>is a Japanese light novel series by Ichiro Sakaki and illustrated by Yukinobu Azumi, also known as the popular adult dōjin artist Nakayohi Mogudan. In 2003, it was adapted into an anime series produced by Bones.

&quot;Scrapped Princess&quot; is notable for its music, which is composed by Masumi Itō, and its themes. It begins as high fantasy and then quickly mixes into varying degrees of post-apocalyptic and science fiction elements through the application of Clarke&#x27;s third law. The atmosphere has undertones of sadness, though many of the characters and situations are superficially light-hearted.

==Plot==
The story takes place in what appears to be a fantasy world and revolves around a girl named Pacifica Casull, the sister in a pair of twins born to the royal family of a kingdom called Leinwan. Pacifica is abandoned at birth. The 5111th Grendel Prophecy predicts that she is the &quot;poison that will destroy the world&quot; if she reaches her sixteenth birthday. To prevent this, she is dropped off a cliff as an infant (&quot;scrapped&quot;).

Pacifica is rescued by a court wizard and adopted by the commoner Casull family. Her foster siblings, Shannon, a swordsman, and Raquel, a wizard, become her protectors. Both siblings are extremely powerful and, more often than not, they easily break out of whatever difficult situation they face. Her siblings travel with her throughout most of the story, protecting her from the numerous attempts on her life by people who fear the outcome of the prophecy. Both siblings&#x27; skills see constant use. By contrast, Pacifica is mostly a typical fifteen-year-old and her inability to defend herself is a recurring source of self-doubt for her, as is the constantly repeated insistence that she will destroy the world.

As the series unfolds, it becomes clear that this fantasy world is actually Earth in the distant future. The truth about the prophecy gradually emerges, but as we learn more, new questions keep popping up. Pacifica must discover her hidden destiny, as powerful beings called Peacemakers, who are worshipped in this world as demi-gods, continually manoeuvre to have her destroyed. At the same time, a mysterious being called a Dragoon comes to the aid of Pacifica and her guardians, offsetting the attack of the Peacemakers. It turns out that Pacifica is not &quot;the poison that will destroy the world&quot;, but humanity&#x27;s last hope, as part of a plan that was set in motion 5000 years before by scientists among the human resistance during what were called the Genesis Wars.

Before the Genesis Wars, the Peacemakers were created by humans as weapons against humanity&#x27;s alien foes, but, determined to protect their human creators and prevent them from destroying themselves, the Peacemakers switched sides and assisted the aliens by imprisoning the survivors of the war in an artificial environment, while at the same time backing up their cultural development to the Middle Ages. The Peacemakers were able to do this with the help of a gifted psychic named Celia Mauser, who, like the Peacemakers themselves, had originally been a tool of the defense. Her powers were used to enhance humanity&#x27;s weaponry, to the point where it was possible to predict enemy movements. The Peacemakers encouraged Celia Mauser to leak information to them in exchange for the lives of her brother and sister. She was too late; her siblings died, and Celia Mauser&#x27;s treason was for nothing. Celia was then kept in an area of phase space in a sort of virtual reality for 5000 years, while humanity continued to live on unknowingly in an intangible cage, isolated on a single continent called Dusbin. Her powerful mind was programmed into the artificial environment&#x27;s control system, and the religion concocted by the aliens to control humanity worships her as a god.

For 5000 years, the Peacemakers watched over humanity, keeping cultural development at a standstill, and prepared to wipe out much of the human race if it ever showed any sign of stepping beyond its apportioned limits (as the Kingdom of Leinwan does toward the end of the series when the attempt is made to coerce the Peacemakers into helping them conquer the world). As the Peacemakers put it, &quot;You don&#x27;t know you are trapped if all you&#x27;ve ever known is your cage.&quot; Humans are completely incapable of resisting the will of the Peacemakers. Just looking a Peacemaker in the eye renders a human obedient – even Shannon and Raquel are not immune to this. Pacifica is the only human being in 5000 years who is immune to this control, and her ability will become communicable to others once she reaches her sixteenth birthday. This is why the Peacemakers are determined to destroy her, and why they have used the Grendel Prophecies to induce others to do the job for them, since Pacifica cannot be directly attacked by the Peacemakers. In the end, Pacifica&#x27;s twin brother, Prince Forsyth, who has seen the suffering inflicted on his people by the Peacemakers in their attempts to eliminate Pacifica, asks to meet her. Her guardians allow it and he uses the opportunity to stab her in the back, ten hours before she turns sixteen. This causes her to be removed to the phase sphere, where she meets Celia Mauser and is given the choice of whether humanity will remain in their prison or not. Pacifica chooses freedom.

==Timeline==
&quot;Scrapped Princess&quot; takes place somewhere between the years 7000 AD to 7500 AD (70th~75th century). In episode 13, it is discussed aboard the Skid that humankind is approximately at same progress level of the Middle Ages. It is also said the Middle Ages occurred 6,000 years ago. Considering the Middle Ages to be around 1000−1500 AD, 6000 years can be added onto that to get a rough estimate of the time frame. This also places the Genesis War between 2000 AD and 2500 AD (7500−5000=2500), since the Genesis War took place 5,000 years before the current date.

<doc id="789632" wikidata="Q2540575" url="?curid=789632" title="Marc Sleen">
<text>Marcel Honoree Nestor ([[Ridder (title)|ridder]]) Neels (30 December 1922 – 6 November 2016), known as Marc Sleen, was a Belgian comics artist. He was mostly known for his humorous adventure comic &quot;The Adventures of Nero and Co.&quot;, but also created gag comics like &quot;Piet Fluwijn en Bolleke&quot;, &quot;De Lustige Kapoentjes&quot;, &quot;Doris Dobbel&quot;, &quot;Oktaaf Keunink&quot; and &quot;De Ronde van Frankrijk&quot;.

Sleen was one of the most celebrated comics artists in his home country. His work is admired for its absurd and sometimes satirical comedy, as well for the fact that he worked completely singlehandedly without any assistance for 45 years on end, a feat that landed him a spot in &quot;The Guinness Book of Records&quot; in 1992. (This feat has been surpassed since by Jim Russell&#x27;s &quot;The Potts&quot;, which ran for 62 years.) He was one of the few comics artists in Belgium who had a museum dedicated to his work.

==Biography==
Marc Sleen was born as Marcel Neels in Gentbrugge, near Ghent. He studied drawing in Ghent. During the Second World War he was imprisoned by Nazi soldiers in Fort Breendonk because his brother worked for the resistance. He was tortured and put in the death cell, but saved by the fact that after D-Day the officers moved all the prisoners to a different prison, where he could escape. In 1944 he started to work as a political caricaturist in the Flemish newspaper &quot;De Standaard&quot;. He also contributed illustrations and short comics for the newspaper and the youth supplement, and made illustrations and his first comics for the magazine &quot;Ons Volk&quot;. He was also a courtroom sketch artist for a while.

In October 1947, Marc Sleen started a new series, &quot;The adventures of detective Van Zwam&quot; in the newspaper &quot;De Nieuwe Gids&quot;. In the first adventure Detective Van Zwam encounters a fool who thinks he is emperor Nero. After he regains his senses, they continue calling him Nero and slowly he became the star of the series. The name changes accordingly to &quot;The adventures of detective Van Zwam and Nero&quot; and after nine stories to &quot;The adventures of Nero and co&quot;.

The series appeared for 55 years with a rhythm of two strips every day. This was typical for the Flemish comic tradition, as with &quot;Suske en Wiske&quot; (&quot;Spike and Suzy&quot;). &quot;Nero&quot; became well known for its ironic humour and references to current affairs. For instance, in the album, &quot;Het Vredesoffensief Van Nero&quot; (&quot;Nero&#x27;s Peace Offensive&quot;) (1951), Nero visits Joseph Stalin to make him drink an elixir that will make him a pacifist.

Besides &quot;Nero&quot; Sleen drew several other comic strip series, many of them gag-a-day comics, for magazines like &quot;&#x27;t Kapoentje&quot; and &quot;Ons Volkske&quot;. Among the most well known were &quot;Piet Fluwijn en Bolleke&quot; (1947–1965), &quot;Doris Dobbel&quot; (1950–1965), &quot;Oktaaf Keunink&quot; (1952–1965) and &quot;De Lustige Kapoentjes&quot;. Sleen also drew a daily cartoon during the Tour de France from 1947 until 1965, called &quot;De Ronde van Frankrijk&quot;.
Between 1950 and 1965 Sleen published &quot;Nero&quot; in &quot;Het Volk&quot;, after which he moved to &quot;De Standaard&quot;. This caused a huge copyright controversy, as several newspapers fought over the rights over his syndicated comics. Thousands of readers switched from &quot;Het Volk&quot; to &quot;De Standaard&quot;, just to follow his adventures in the newspaper. After that switch, he dropped all other series and devoted himself solely to &quot;Nero&quot;.

From 1992 to 2002, he was aided by , a versatile Flemish comic artist, and at first the intention was to let Stallaert continue the series after Marc Sleen retired. But in the end, Stallaert didn&#x27;t feel ready to continue it alone, and at the end of 2002, at the age of 80, Marc Sleen ended his career as a comics artist.

Sleen designed album covers for records by Flemish actor, comedian and singer Jef Burm. Burm was a former school mate of his.

==TV documentary work==

Marc Sleen was also known as a traveller and animal friend. He made 35 safaris to Africa between 1961 and 1991, making more than 20 documentaries for the Vlaamse Radio- en Televisieomroep, mostly for the TV show &quot;Allemaal Beestjes&quot;. A few books and records about his safaris appeared as well. Many of his comics featured animals and countries he has visited.

==Legacy==

Marc Sleen is commonly considered one of the big names of the Flemish comics, together with Willy Vandersteen and Jef Nys.

In 2005 he was selected as one of the 111 nominees for the title &quot;The Greatest Belgian&quot; (De Grootste Belg) in the Flemish edition. He ended in 48th place.

On 19 June 2009, a museum dedicated to his life and career was opened in Brussels: the Marc Sleen Museum. Both Marc Sleen as well as King Albert II of Belgium were present. The king was a fan of &quot;Nero&quot; since his youth and both he and Baudouin of Belgium learned Dutch by reading &quot;Nero&quot;.

Sleen died at the age of 93 on the evening of 6 November 2016. He was buried in the Campo Santo in Ghent.

On 1 January 2030, all comic characters by Marc Sleen will officially enter public domain.

<doc id="789633" wikidata="Q1057717" url="?curid=789633" title="Gooey butter cake">
<text>Gooey butter cake is a type of cake traditionally made in St. Louis, Missouri. It is a flat and dense cake made with wheat cake flour, butter, sugar, and eggs, typically near an inch tall, and dusted with powdered sugar. While sweet and rich, it is somewhat firm, and is able to be cut into pieces similarly to a brownie. Gooey butter cake is generally served as a type of coffee cake and not as a formal dessert cake. There are two distinct variants of the cake: the original St. Louis, MO Bakers&#x27; gooey butter and a cream cheese and commercial yellow cake mix variant. The original St. Louis, MO Bakers&#x27; gooey butter is believed to have originated in the 1930s. It was made with a yeast-raised sweet dough on the bottom.

The St. Louis Convention &amp; Visitors Commission includes a recipe for the cream cheese and commercial yellow cake mix variant cake on its website, calling it &quot;one of St. Louis&#x27; popular, quirky foods&quot;. The recipe calls for a bottom layer of butter and yellow cake batter, and a top layer made from eggs, cream cheese, and, in one case, almond extract. The cake is dusted with confectioner&#x27;s sugar before being served. The cake is best eaten soon after baking it. It should be served at room temperature or warm.

The cream cheese variant of the gooey butter cake recipe (also known as &quot;Ooey Gooey butter cake&quot;, occasionally &quot;chess cake&quot;), while close enough to the original, is an approximation designed for easier preparation at home. Bakeries in the greater St. Louis area who know how to make an original formula Gooey Butter cake, including those at local grocery chains Schnucks and Dierbergs, use a slightly different recipe based on corn syrup, sugar and powdered eggs; however, no cake mix or cream cheese is involved.

== Origin and popularity ==
There are several claims to the creation of the cake. The cake was supposedly first made by accident in the 1930s by a St. Louis-area German American baker who was trying to make regular cake batter but reversed the proportions of butter and flour. John Hoffman was the owner of the bakery where the mistake was made. One story is that there were two types of butter &quot;smears&quot; used in his bakery: a gooey butter and a deep butter. The deep butter was used for deep butter coffee cakes. The gooey butter was used as an adhesive for things like Danish rolls and stollens. The gooey butter was smeared across the surface, then the item was placed in coconut, hazelnuts, peanuts, crumbs or whatever was desired so they would stick to the product. Hoffman hired a new baker who was supposed to make deep butter cakes, but got the butter smears mixed up. The mistake was not caught until after the cakes came out of the proof box. Rather than throw them away, Hoffman went ahead and baked them. This baking mistake was made during the Great Depression, which meant supplies for baking ingredients were low. The new cake sold so well that Hoffman kept baking and selling them and soon, so did the other bakers around St. Louis.

Another St. Louis baker, Fred Heimburger, also remembers the cake coming on the scene in the 1930s, as a slip up that became a popular hit and local acquired taste. He liked it well enough that Heimburger tried to promote gooey butter cake by taking samples of it with him when he traveled out of St. Louis to visit other bakers in their shops. They liked it, but they could not get their customers to buy it. Their reactions tending to regard it as looking too much like a mistake, and &quot;a flat gooey mess&quot;. As such, so it remained as a regional favorite for many decades. Other stories surround the cake&#x27;s creation; none have been historically verified.

Traditionally served as a breakfast or &quot;coffee cake&quot;, variations of Gooey Butter Cake have become popular, dessert offerings in many restaurants. The first known use of the confection as a dessert was at Clary’s Restaurant in Springfield, Missouri. In 1991, the restaurant first offered a Warm Blueberry Gooey Butter Cake with Vanilla Bean Ice Cream and Blueberry Coulis. It became a signature dessert at the popular eatery.

== Availability ==
Many St. Louis area grocery stores sell fresh or boxed gooey butter cakes. Haas Baking sold a widely distributed, square and packaged version in a box that depicts a colorful, if anachronistic scene of aviator Charles Lindbergh&#x27;s plane the &quot;Spirit of St. Louis&quot; flying past downtown St. Louis, the Gateway Arch and the modern cityscape in clouds. Independent or family bakeries make gooey butter cakes, from a time when there were still many neighborhood corner German and Austrian American bakeries in St. Louis, in neighborhoods like Dutchtown, Bevo Mill, and the Tower Grove area, and others. There are now several businesses that specialize in different flavors of gooey butter cake and sell them in coffee shops, or to walk in customers, or by order or shipment.

Panera Bread Company (original name: St. Louis Bread Company) makes a Danish with a gooey butter filling for the St. Louis market. More recently, Walgreens sells wrapped, individual slices of a version of St. Louis gooey butter cake as a snack alongside muffins, brownies, and cookies.

Gooey butter cake is now widely available outside of the St. Louis area, as Walmart has been marketing a version called Paula Deen Baked Goods Original Gooey Butter Cake. While Walmart still sells a gooey butter cake, they dropped the Paula Deen version.

Gooey butter cake (&quot;butter cake&quot;) is also widely popular in German-style bakeries throughout the Philadelphia Metropolitan Area, as well as down the Jersey Shore. Wawa has started selling different flavors of individually-wrapped gooey butter cakes.

Modern versions of this confection, originally sold as a breakfast pastry or &quot;coffee cake&quot;, have shown up on upscale restaurant menus across the Midwest and even the West coast.

== In popular culture ==
On the SyFy television series &quot;Defiance&quot;, Nolan and Rafe discuss gooey butter cake while in Old St. Louis in the episode &quot;Down In the Ground Where the Dead Men Go&quot;. It was featured on an episode of &quot;Pizza Masters&quot; titled &quot;Leave Me in St. Louis&quot;.

<doc id="789639" wikidata="Q1361324" url="?curid=789639" title="Socorro Island">
<text>Socorro Island () is a volcanic island in the Revillagigedo Islands, a Mexican possession lying off the country&#x27;s western coast. The size is 16.5 by 11.5 km (10.25 by 7.15 miles), with an area of . It is the largest of the four islands of the Revillagigedo Archipelago. The last eruption was in 1993.

== Geology ==

The island rises abruptly from the sea to in elevation at its summit. Socorro Island is the emerged summit of a massive, predominantly submarine shield volcano.

The island is part of the northern Mathematicians Ridge, a mid-ocean ridge that became largely inactive 3.5 million years ago when activity moved to the East Pacific Rise. All four islands along with the many seamounts on the ridge are post-abandonment alkaline volcanoes. Socorro Island is unusual in that it is the only dominantly silicic peralkaline volcanic island in the Pacific Ocean.

It most recently erupted in late Januaryearly February 1993, which was a submarine flank eruption off the coast from Punta Tosca. An earlier eruption was on May 21, 1951; earlier eruptions probably occurred in 1905, 1896 and 1848. The initial volcanic event probably occurred in 3090BC 500 years. Mount Evermann (Spanish: &quot;Cerro Evermann&quot;) is the name given to the summit dome complex, in honor of ichthyologist Barton Warren Evermann. The island&#x27;s surface is broken by furrows, small craters, and numerous ravines, and covered in lava domes, lava flows and cinder cones.

There are eight bays surrounding Socorro: three on the southern end of island — Vargas Lozano, Braithwaite, and Lucio Gallardo Pavon; Ensenada Grayson on the southwest; Blanca on the northwest with two inlets separated by a rocky outcropping; and North Bay on the island&#x27;s north end with two inlets separated by a volcanic formation.

There is a naval station, established in 1957, with a population of 250 (staff and families), living in a village with a church, that stands on the western side of Bahía Vargas Lozano, a small cove with a rocky beach, about east of Cabo Regla, the southernmost point of the island. The station is served by a dock, a local helipad and Isla Socorro airport, located six kilometers to the north. There is a fresh water spring about northwest of Cabo Regla, at the shoreline of Ensenada Grayson (or Caleta Grayson). This is brackish and sometimes covered by the sea at high tide. In the 1950s, a small freshwater seep was known to exist some inland at Bahía Lucio Gallardo Pavon (Binner&#x27;s Cove), northwest of the naval station.

==History==

No evidence of human habitation on Socorro exists before its discovery by Spanish explorer Hernando de Grijalva and his crew on 19 December 1533, who named it &quot;Santo Tomás&quot; (&quot;St Thomas Island&quot;; ). In 1542, Ruy López de Villalobos, while exploring new routes across the Pacific, rediscovered &quot;Inocentes&quot; and renamed it &quot;Isla Anublada&quot; (&quot;Cloudy Island&quot;) due to the clouds frequently forming on the northern slopes of Mount Evermann, and again in 1608, Martín Yañez de Armida, in charge of another expedition, visited &quot;Santo Tomás&quot; and changed its name to &quot;Isla Socorro&quot; after Our Lady of Perpetual Help (&quot;Virgen del Perpetuo Socorro&quot;).

At the beginning of the twentieth century, Barton Warren Evermann, director of the California Academy of Sciences in San Francisco promoted the scientific exploration of the island. The most comprehensive biological collections were obtained at this time. The volcano on Socorro was renamed in his honor.

Archie Smith, an American laborer from San Diego, was marooned on the island for one month in 1929 before being rescued by a passing fishing boat. This was because the expedition that brought him to the island to shear wild sheep returned to port for supplies, but went bankrupt and could not return.

In September 1997, Hurricane Linda passed near the island near peak intensity causing minor damage to meteorological instruments on the island.

==Ecology==
The lowlands of Socorro – except on the northern, more humid side – are covered with thick shrubland, consisting mainly of endemic &quot;Croton masonii&quot; and a cactus, probably Engelmann&#x27;s prickly pear (&quot;Opuntia engelmannii&quot;). Above and on the northern side, a richer vegetation occurs. This includes small trees such as &quot;Ficus cotinifolia&quot;, black cherry (&quot;Prunus serotina&quot;), and the endemic &quot;Guettarda insularis&quot;, which bear epiphytic orchids (&quot;Epidendrum nitens&quot;, &quot;E. rigidum&quot; and the endemic &quot;Pleurothallis unguicallosa&quot;).

The native land fauna is depauperate, with birds predominating and mammals absent. There is one endemic species of iguanid lizard (&quot;Urosaurus auriculatus&quot;) and the land crab &quot;Johngarthia oceanica&quot;, which also occurs on Clipperton Island.

Sheep, cats, and rodents were introduced to the island by human activity; more recently, the locust &quot;Schistocerca piceifrons&quot; has also established itself on the island. Unlike the mammals on Guadalupe Island or Clarión, their impact on the local flora was minor, but cat predation has had a drastic effect since the mid-1970s due to the fauna&#x27;s island tameness, and the locusts that swarm twice a year seriously damage vegetation during that time. There have been no recorded extinctions of plants on Socorro; several birds have been drastically affected by cat predation however, and one taxon, the Socorro dove, has gone extinct in the wild.

Socorro is an important breeding location for several seabirds, many of which have here one of their north(east)ernmost breeding colonies. The present status of these birds is not well known, and they presumably have suffered from cat predation. In 1953, the following taxa were present:
* Wedge-tailed shearwater, &quot;Puffinus pacificus&quot; (or &quot;Ardenna pacifica&quot;)
* Western red-billed tropicbird, &quot;Phaethon aethereus mesonauta&quot; – breeding suspected but not verified
* Nazca booby, &quot;Sula granti&quot; – breeding suspected but not verified
* Northeast Pacific brown booby, &quot;Sula leucogaster brewsteri&quot; – breeding suspected but not verified
* East Pacific great frigatebird, &quot;Fregata minor ridgwayi&quot; – breeding suspected but not verified; a doubtfully distinct subspecies
* East Pacific sooty tern, &quot;Onychoprion fuscatus crissalis&quot; – a doubtfully distinct subspecies
* East Pacific brown noddy, &quot;Anous stolidus ridgwayi&quot;

Non-endemic landbirds and shorebirds occur mostly as vagrants or use the island as a stopover during migration; the northern mockingbird became established in the late 20th century. Among those that are recorded not infrequently are great blue heron, Hudsonian curlew, spotted sandpiper and wandering tattler. Unlike the situation on smaller and more isolated Clarión, wind-blown or vagrant birds seem to constitute the bulk of the recorded species, including brown pelican, osprey, peregrine falcon, semipalmated plover, willet, sanderling, belted kingfisher and buff-bellied pipit. It may be that this puzzling observation is due to the presence of the red-tailed hawks and cats, which has at least made the local &quot;Urosaurus&quot; more wary than its relative on Clarión, and might deter passing birds from stopping on Socorro.

===Endemism===
Being the largest of the Revillagigedo Islands and closer to mainland than Clarion, Socorro sports a rich array of endemic taxa, mainly plants and landbirds as well as lizards. Some are threatened due to the presence of feral cats.

====Animals====

* Socorro parakeet, &quot;Aratinga brevipes&quot; (endangered)
* Socorro red-tailed hawk, &quot;Buteo jamaicensis socorroensis&quot;
* Socorro common ground dove, &quot;Columbina passerina socorroensis&quot;
* Socorro elf owl, &quot;Micrathene whitneyi graysoni&quot; (probably extinct since c. 1970)
* Socorro mockingbird, &quot;Mimodes graysoni&quot; (critically endangered)
* Socorro yellow-crowned night heron, &quot;Nycticorax violaceus gravirostris&quot; (or &quot;Nyctanassa violacea gravirostris&quot;)
* Socorro tropical parula, &quot;Parula pitiayumi graysoni&quot;
* Socorro towhee, &quot;Pipilo (maculatus) socorroensis&quot;
* Townsend&#x27;s shearwater, &quot;Puffinus auricularis&quot; (critically endangered; recently extirpated from San Benedicto and probably Clarión)
* Socorro wren, &quot;Troglodytes sissonii&quot; (near threatened)
* Socorro dove, &quot;Zenaida graysoni&quot; (extinct in the wild)
* &quot;Urosaurus auriculatus&quot; (endangered)

====Plants====

According to Plants of the World Online there are 21 species of plant that are strictly endemic to the island.

In addition there are five more species that are endemic to the Revillagigedo Archipelago growing on both Socorro and one of the other islands.

There are also an endemic variety of paintbrush flower, &quot;Castilleja bryantii&quot; var. &quot;socorrensis&quot;, and a subspecies named &quot;Lepechinia hastata&quot; subsp. &quot;socorrensis&quot; in addition to other species that are native, but not endemic.

==Visiting information==
Socorro Island is a popular scuba diving destination known for underwater encounters with dolphins, sharks, manta rays and other pelagic animals. Divers visit here on live-aboard dive vessels. The most popular months are between November and May when the weather and seas are calmer. November to December are popular months to visit for a good chance to dive with whale sharks. January and February are popular months to scuba dive with humpback whales as they are then migrating through the Revillagigedo archipelago.

<text>The Rio–Antirrio Bridge (), officially the Charilaos Trikoupis Bridge, is one of the world&#x27;s longest multi-span cable-stayed bridges and longest of the fully suspended type. It crosses the Gulf of Corinth near Patras, linking the town of Rio on the Peloponnese peninsula to Antirrio on mainland Greece by road. It opened one day before the Athens 2004 Summer Olympics, on 12 August 2004, and was used to transport the Olympic flame.

==Location==
The bridge dramatically improves access to and from the Peloponnese, which could previously be reached only by ferry or via the isthmus of Corinth in the east. Its width is —it has two vehicle lanes per direction, an emergency lane and a pedestrian walkway. Its five-span four-pylon cable-stayed portion of length is the world&#x27;s third longest cable-stayed deck; only the decks of the Jiaxing-Shaoxing Sea Bridge in Shaoxing, China and the Millau Viaduct in southern France are longer at and , respectively. However, as the former has a shorter length of main span (the length of the main span is the most common way to rank cable-stayed bridges, as the size of the main span does often correlate with the height of the towers, and the engineering complexity involved in designing and constructing the bridge) and as the latter is also supported by bearings at the pylons apart from cable stays, the Rio–Antirrio Bridge deck might be considered the longest cable-stayed &quot;suspended&quot; deck in the world.

This bridge is widely considered to be an engineering masterpiece, owing to several solutions applied to span the difficult site. These difficulties include deep water, insecure materials for foundations, seismic activity, the probability of tsunamis, and the expansion of the Gulf of Corinth due to plate tectonics.

==Construction==

Charilaos Trikoupis was a 19th-century prime minister of Greece who suggested building a bridge in the current location, but Greece&#x27;s finances at the time didn&#x27;t permit its construction.

The bridge was planned in the mid-1990s and was built by a French-Greek consortium led by the French group Vinci SA which includes the Greek companies Hellenic Technodomiki-TEV, J&amp;P-Avax, Athena, Proodeftiki and Pantechniki. The consortium operates the bridge under concession under its ΓΕΦΥΡΑ or ΓαλλοΕλληνικός Φορέας Υπερθαλάσσιας ζεύξης Ρίου-Αντιρίου (&quot;GEFYRA&quot;—Greek for &quot;bridge&quot;—or &quot;GalloEllinikós Foréas Yperthalássias zéfxis Ríou-Antiríou&quot;, French-Greek Carrier of Oversea Connection of Rio–Antirrio) subsidiary. The suspension of the blue decorative lighting was announced by the company due to the ongoing electricity crisis in Europe but also to be in line with the company&#x27;s environmental strategy. The bridge&#x27;s carbon footprint has been reduced by 84.5% from 2015 to 2022.

The lead architect was Berdj Mikaelian. Site preparation and dredging began in July 1998, and construction of the massive supporting pylons in 2000. With these complete in 2003, work began on the traffic decks. Steel fabrication was undertaken by Cleveland Bridge &amp; Engineering Company. On 21 May 2004 the main stage of construction was completed; only equipment (sidewalks, railings, etc.) and waterproofing remained to be installed.

The total cost of the bridge was about €630 million, funded by Greek state funds, the consortium, and loans by the European Investment Bank. It was finished ahead of its original schedule, which had foreseen completion between September and November 2004, and within budget. Other sources suggest the final cost was €839 million.

==Inauguration==
The bridge was inaugurated on 7 August 2004, a week before the opening of the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens. Olympic torchbearers were the first to officially cross it. One of them was Otto Rehhagel, the German football coach who won the Euro 2004 Championships for Greece. Another was Costas Laliotis, the former Minister of Public Works during whose term the project had begun.

==Engineering feats==

Due to the peculiar conditions of the straits, several unique engineering problems needed to be considered and overcome. The water depth reaches 65 m, the seabed is mostly of loose sediment, the seismic activity and possibility of tectonic movement is significant, and the Gulf of Corinth is expanding at a rate of about 30 mm a year. In addition, the hills on either side create a wind tunnel where winds are common.

For these reasons, special design and construction techniques were applied. Beneath each pier the seabed was first reinforced and stabilized by driving 200 hollow steel pipes vertically into the ground. The pier footings were not buried into the seabed, but rather rest on a bed of gravel meticulously leveled to an even surface (a difficult endeavor at this depth). During an earthquake, the piers can move laterally on the sea floor with the gravel bed absorbing the energy. The bridge decking is connected to the pylons using jacks and dampers to absorb movement; too rigid a connection would cause the bridge structure to fail in the event of an earthquake and too much lateral leeway would damage the piers. There is also provision for the gradual widening of the strait over the lifetime of the bridge. Protection from the effect of high winds on the decking is provided by the use of aerodynamic spoiler-like fairing and on the cables by the use of spiral Scruton strakes.


The bridge received the 2006 Outstanding Structure Award from the International Association for Bridge and Structural Engineering. In 2006 the bridge was featured in an episode of &quot;Megastructures&quot; on the &quot;National Geographic Channel&quot;. In 2011 the bridge returned to TV in an episode of &quot;Richard Hammond&#x27;s Engineering Connections.&quot; In 2015, construction of the bridge was chronicled in the first episode of the Science Channel series &quot;Impossible Engineering&quot;.

==Trouble with cable links==
On 28 January 2005, six months after the opening of the bridge, one of the cable links of the bridge snapped from the top of the M1 pylon and came crashing down on the deck. Traffic was immediately halted. The investigation found that a fire had broken out on the top of the M1 pylon after a lightning strike to one of the cables. The cable was immediately restored and the bridge reopened.

==Monitoring system==
A structural health monitoring system was installed during construction on the bridge. Still operating, it provides a 24/7 surveillance of the structure. The system has more than 100 sensors, including:
* 3D accelerometers on the deck, pylons, stay cables, and on the ground to characterize wind movements and seismic tremors
* Strain gauges and load cells on the stay cables and their gussets
* Displacement sensors on the expansion joints to measure the thermal expansion of the deck
* Water-level sensors on the pylon bases to detect infiltration
* Temperature sensors in the deck to detect freezing conditions
* Linear variable differential transducer (LVDT) sensors on the stay cables to measure movement
* Load cells on the restrainers for recalibration in the event of an earthquake
* Two weather stations to measure wind intensity, direction, air temperature, and relative humidity

One specific element of the system is the ability to detect and specifically treat earthquake events.

==Photography==
Photography by both professional and amateur photographers or cinematographers is allowed and encouraged by the bridge management without the need for a permit, with the bridge&#x27;s management often organizing special events inviting professional and amateur photographers and cinematographers to photograph the bridge and the cars or the pedestrians using it.

<text>Ebenezer Rockwood Hoar (February 21, 1816 – January 31, 1895) was an American politician, lawyer, and jurist from Massachusetts. He served as U.S. Attorney General from 1869 to 1870, and was the first head of the newly created Department of Justice. Hoar assisted President Ulysses S. Grant in appointing two United States Supreme Court justices and was himself nominated to the Court. His nomination was rejected by the United States Senate, in part for his positions on patronage reform. In 1871, Hoar was appointed by Grant to the United States high commission that negotiated the Treaty of Washington between the U.S. and the United Kingdom, helping to settle the Alabama Claims.

== Early life and legal career ==
Ebenezer Rockwood Hoar was born in Concord, Massachusetts, on February 21, 1816, to Samuel and Sarah Hoar (née Sherman). Hoar came from a long line of Puritan ancestry. His family had emigrated to America in 1640, initially settling in Braintree, Massachusetts. Hoar was sent to a religious private female teacher at the early age of two. By the age of three, Hoar was able to read the Bible fluently as an adult. By four, Hoar was fully literate, having surpassed his older sister in reading and writing. As Hoar grew up he was known for quick thinking and witty sayings. In 1831, Hoar entered Harvard University at the age of fifteen. Upon graduation in 1835, he moved West and served as an instructor at a school for girls in Pittsburgh. After teaching, he traveled to Kentucky and heard the famous politician Henry Clay speak, then returned to Concord to study law at his father&#x27;s office. In 1837, Hoar returned to Harvard where he studied law for eighteen months and for six months in the law office of Emory Washburn. On September 30, 1839, he passed the bar and had received a LL.B. degree from Harvard, where upon he practiced law in 1840 in Concord and Boston.

==Massachusetts politics==
In the 1840s, Hoar began his political career as an anti-slavery member of the Whig Party. Hoar stated that he was a &quot;Conscience Whig&quot; rather than a &quot;Cotton Whig&quot;, who represented the Massachusetts textile interests and the Southern cotton industry.

In 1846, Hoar was elected to the Massachusetts Senate. In 1848, Hoar worked with his father to form the Free Soil Party of Massachusetts. The new party opposed the extension of slavery in the Western territories.

In 1849, Hoar was appointed a Judge of the Court of Common Pleas in Boston and served until 1855.

In 1859, Hoar was appointed as an associate justice of the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court. While on the bench Judge Hoar was known for his critiquing of younger lawyers; one of those who impressed Hoar was Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr.

After the American Civil War, Hoar opposed the impeachment of President Andrew Johnson.

==Attorney General (1869–1870)==
On March 5, 1869, President Ulysses S. Grant appointed Hoar the 30th Attorney General of the United States. All of Grant&#x27;s appointments, including Hoar, were initially a shock to the Senate, since Grant chose his cabinet independently from leaders of the Republican Party. The Senate immediately approved all of Grant&#x27;s appointments, and press reaction was generally optimistic, applauding Grant&#x27;s cabinet as one free from &quot;trickery and corruption.&quot; Hoar served as Grant&#x27;s principal legal and political advisor, since Grant had never held public elected office until his election to the presidency. In July 1870, Hoar became the first attorney general to head the Department of Justice, created to strengthen the enforcement and investigation powers of the President.

=== Boutwell appointment ===
One of Hoar&#x27;s first duties as Attorney General was to rule on the appointment of New York businessman Alexander T. Stewart as Secretary of the Treasury. Stewart was opposed by Senators Charles Sumner and Roscoe Conkling, who cited a 1789 law prohibiting any Secretary who was &quot;concerned or interested in carrying on the business of trade or commerce.&quot; Stewart had proposed he renounce his legal title to any retail business until after his potential term ended. However, Hoar advised Grant that Stewart&#x27;s plan was legally impractical. Taking Hoar&#x27;s advice, Grant instead appointed George S. Boutwell as Secretary of the Treasury. Boutwell&#x27;s appointment, however, made Hoar&#x27;s continuance in Grant&#x27;s Cabinet tenuous, since both Boutwell and Hoar were from Massachusetts during an era in which it was traditional and politically expedient to have no more than one presidential cabinet member from any single state.

===Supreme Court nomination and rejection===
On December 14, 1869, President Grant nominated Hoar to the associate justice seat on the United States Supreme Court created by the Judiciary Act of 1869. The nomination engendered much controversy. As Attorney General, Hoar had alienated senators by not consulting them before recommending to the president nominees for circuit judge. In addition, senators were indignant about Hoar&#x27;s positions on patronage reform and about his previous opposition to the impeachment of Andrew Johnson. The nomination was referred to the Senate Judiciary Committee, which recommended against confirmation. On February 3, 1870, the Senate rejected Hoar 24-33 in a roll call vote.

Grant had an additional associate justice to fill in December 1869, when Robert C. Grier retired. Grant nominated Secretary of War Edwin Stanton to succeed Grier. Stanton was swiftly confirmed, but died soon thereafter before he took office.

On Hoar&#x27;s advice, Grant nominated William Strong and Joseph P. Bradley to fill the twin vacancies. Both were easily confirmed.

=== &quot;Hepburn v. Griswold&quot; ===
One hour after both Strong and Bradley were submitted to the Senate, the Supreme Court ruled in &quot;Hepburn v. Griswold&quot; that the 1862 Legal Tender Act that had authorized the Treasury to print paper money as legal tender was unconstitutional. President Grant, Hoar, and his entire cabinet had been against the Court&#x27;s 4–3 &quot;Hepburn&quot; ruling, believing that the nation&#x27;s money supply would be reduced and that this would ruin the economy. On March 31, 1870, Hoar went before the Supreme Court and argued that the &quot;Hepburn&quot; decision caused instability in the national economy, in case the country needed to print money during an emergency, as had been done during the American Civil War. One year later, with justices Strong and Bradley on the bench, the Court reversed the &quot;Hepburn&quot; ruling in a 5–4 decision, making paper money legal tender. Although President Grant and Hoar were accused of packing the Court, Strong and Smith&#x27;s names had been submitted to the Senate prior to the &quot;Hepburn&quot; decision.

===Reconstruction===
Hoar was a moderate Republican who opposed federal intervention in protecting African American citizens during Reconstruction. Hoar believed that Southerners would behave responsibly and find a way to protect African Americans. President Grant, however, had lost faith in the Southerners to comply with constitutional and federal law that protected African Americans.

In May 1870, Congress passed the first of three anti-terrorism laws known as Enforcement Acts to counter Klan violence in the South. In order to increase the federal government&#x27;s investigative and enforcement powers, Congress created the Department of Justice and Solicitor General in June 1870. President Grant was under increased pressure to replace Hoar with a more Radical Attorney General, one who did not oppose federal intervention to stop lawlessness in the South.

===Resignation===
In June 1870, President Grant sent Hoar a letter that requested his resignation without explanation.

Hoar was initially shocked at the sudden resignation request, and went to see Grant, having previously taken pardon requests to Grant at the White House. President Grant told Hoar that Southern Senators wanted a Southerner in the cabinet and that he needed support from Southern Senators.

Hoar complied and sent Grant a letter of resignation. Controversy ensued when Grant&#x27;s personal secretaries allowed Hoar&#x27;s resignation letter to be disclosed to the press. None of Grant&#x27;s other cabinet members knew that Grant had asked for Hoar&#x27;s resignation.

Hoar remained in Grant&#x27;s cabinet until November 1870, when his successor Amos T. Akerman was sworn in. Akerman was from Georgia and aggressively supported Reconstruction and the federal protection of African American civil rights.

==Alabama Claims==

Hoar was one of five United States members of a joint high commission with the United Kingdom to settle Civil War claims, and also territorial claims in relation to the Dominion of Canada. The commission&#x27;s work led to the signing of the Treaty of Washington in 1871. The treaty defined a method of international arbitration to settle disputed sovereign maritime and territorial issues, and also clarified the rules for maritime trade between Canada and the United States. The issues deferred to arbitration were: the Alabama Civil War claims, other claims and counterclaims growing out of the Civil War, the San Juan water boundary with the Dominion of Canada in Puget Sound, and Nova Scotia fishery rights.

A subsequent joint arbitration commission, acting under the treaty, issued a decision in September 1872, rejecting American claims for indirect war damages but ordering Britain to pay the United States $15.5 million (~$ in ) as compensation for the Alabama claims.

==U.S. Representative and retirement==
Hoar was elected as a Republican to the 43rd Congress (1873–75). He was not a candidate for renomination in 1874 and returned to practicing law.

Hoar chaired the 1875 centennial celebration of the Battles of Lexington and Concord, held in Concord and attended by many leading individuals of the day, including President Grant. He also served on the board of overseers of Harvard University from 1868 through 1882.

==Personal life==
While studying law at Harvard, Hoar met Caroline Downes Brooks (1820–1892) of Concord. The two married on November 20, 1840. Their marriage produced seven children, Caroline, Samuel, Charles Emerson, Clara Downes, Elizabeth, and Sherman; Sarah Sherman died an infant. The Hoar marriage was happy; however, Caroline had suffered from illness for many years.

Caroline was the half-sister of US Representative George M. Brooks of Massachusetts.

=== Hoar family ===
Hoar&#x27;s father Samuel Hoar was an influential lawyer and politician. Through his mother, Sarah Sherman, E. Rockwood Hoar was the grandson of American founding father Roger Sherman and Rebecca Minot Prescott. Hoar&#x27;s brother George Frisbie Hoar served as U.S. Senator from Massachusetts from 1877 to his death in 1904. Hoar&#x27;s children include U.S. Representative Sherman Hoar (1860–1898) and Samuel Hoar (1845–1904). Hoar&#x27;s grandchildren include Massachusetts State Senator and Assistant Attorney General Roger Sherman Hoar. Hoar&#x27;s first cousin Roger Sherman Baldwin was a U.S. Senator and Governor of Connecticut. Another first cousin, William Maxwell Evarts, was a U.S. Senator and Secretary of State (and immediately preceded Hoar as U.S. Attorney General), and yet another one, Sherman Day, was a California State Senator, 1855–56, U.S. Surveyor General, 1868–71, and an original trustee of the University of California. Hoar is distantly related to political commentator Tucker Carlson.

==Death==
Hoar died in Concord in 1895. He is interred in Concord&#x27;s Sleepy Hollow Cemetery.

<text>Brigadier General George Miller Sternberg (June 8, 1838 – November 3, 1915) was a U.S. Army physician who is considered the first American bacteriologist, having written &quot;Manual of Bacteriology&quot; (1892). After he survived typhoid and yellow fever, Sternberg documented the cause of malaria (1881), discovered the cause of lobar pneumonia (1881), and confirmed the roles of the bacilli of tuberculosis and typhoid fever (1886).

As the 18th U.S. Army Surgeon General, from 1893 to 1902, Sternberg led commissions to control typhoid and yellow fever, along with his subordinate Major Walter Reed. Sternberg also oversaw the establishment of the Army Medical School (1893; now the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research) and of the U.S. Army Nurse Corps (1901). The pioneering German bacteriologist Robert Koch honored Sternberg with the sobriquet, &quot;Father of American Bacteriology&quot;.

Sternberg was born at Hartwick Seminary, Otsego County, New York, where he spent most of his childhood. He was the eldest child of Levi Sternberg and Margaret Miller Sternberg. His father was a Lutheran clergyman, was descended from a German family from the Palatinate, which had settled in the Schoharie Valley in the early years of the 18th century. His father later became principal of Hartwick Seminary in Hartwick, New York, where he started his education. His mother, Margaret Levering (Miller) Sternberg, was the daughter of George B. Miller, also a Lutheran clergyman and professor of theology at the seminary, which was a Lutheran school. As an eldest child of a large family and he was given adult responsibilities from an early age. He interrupted his studies at the seminary with a year of work in a bookstore in Cooperstown and three years of teaching in nearby rural schools. During his last year at Hartwick he was an instructor in mathematics, chemistry, and natural philosophy. He was at the same time pursuing the study of medicine with Horace Lathrop of Cooperstown. For his formal medical training he went first to Buffalo, and later to the College of Physicians and Surgeons of New York (M.D. degree, 1860). After graduation he settled in Elizabeth, New Jersey, to practice, remaining there until the outbreak of the Civil War.

===Early career===

====Junior Army surgeon====
On May 28, 1861, he was appointed an Assistant Surgeon in the U.S. Army, and on July 21 of the same year was captured at the First Battle of Bull Run, while serving with General George Sykes&#x27; division. He managed to escape and soon joined his command in the defense of Washington. He later participated in the Peninsular campaign and saw service in the battles of Gaines&#x27; Mill and Malvern Hill. During this campaign he contracted typhoid fever while at Harrison&#x27;s Landing and was sent north on a transport. During the remainder of the war he performed hospital duty, mostly at Lovell Hospital at Portsmouth, Rhode Island, and at Cleveland, Ohio. On March 13, 1865, he was given the Brevets of captain and major for faithful and meritorious service.

The years following the war followed the pattern of frequent moves typical of junior medical officers of the day. He married Louisa Russell, daughter of Robert Russell of Cooperstown, on October 19, 1865, and took his bride to Jefferson Barracks, Missouri, from where he was soon transferred to Fort Harker, near Ellsworth in Kansas. Louisa did not accompany him to the latter post, but joined him in 1867 just prior to an outbreak of cholera. She was one of the first civilians to develop the disease which killed her within a few hours on July 15 and soon claimed a toll of about 75 people at the fort.

====Paleontology====
Sternberg was promoted to captain on May 28, 1866, and was soon sent to Fort Riley, Kansas (December 1867). With troops from this post he took part (1868–69) in several expeditions against hostile Cheyenne Indians along the upper Arkansas River in Indian Territory and in western Kansas. Besides his military duties, Sternberg was also interested in fossils and began collecting leaf imprints from the nearby Dakota Sandstone Formation. Some of his specimens went back East where they were studied by the famous paleobotanist, Leo Lesquereux.

Sternberg also collected vertebrate fossils, including shark teeth, fish remains and mosasaur bones, from the Smoky Hill Chalk and Pierre Shale formations in western Kansas, and sent the specimens back to Washington, D.C., where they were eventually curated in the United States National Museum (Smithsonian Institution). There they were studied and later described in publications by Joseph Leidy. The type specimen of the giant Late Cretaceous fish, &quot;Xiphactinus audax&quot;, was collected by Dr. Sternberg. His work was also credited by Edward D. Cope and Samuel W. Williston. Sternberg was also responsible for getting his younger brother, Charles H. Sternberg, started in paleontology. Charles would later credit his older brother for getting many other paleontologists of the day interested in the fossil resources of Kansas.

Sternberg served at Fort Riley until July 1870, when he was ordered to Governors Island, New York. In the meantime, he had remarried on September 1, 1869, at Indianapolis, Indiana, to Martha L. Pattison, a daughter of Thomas T. N. Pattison of that city.

===Later career===

====Yellow fever====
During two years at Governors Island and three (1872–75) at Fort Barrancas, Florida, Sternberg had frequent contacts with yellow fever patients, and at the latter post, he contracted the disease himself. He had earlier noted the efficiency of moving inhabitants out of an infested environment and successfully applied that method to the Barrancas garrison. At about this time, Sternberg published two articles in the &quot;New Orleans Medical and Surgical Journal&quot; (&quot;An Inquiry into the Modus Operandi of the Yellow Fever Poison,&quot; July 1875, and &quot;A Study of the Natural History of Yellow Fever,&quot; March 1877) which gained him status as an authority on yellow fever. While convalescing from his bout with the disease in 1877 he was ordered to Fort Walla Walla, Washington, and later that year he participated in a campaign against the Nez Perce Indians. The spent his spare hours in study and experimentation which laid a foundation for his later work. In 1870 he perfected an anemometer and patented an automatic heat regulator which later had wide negative use.

On December 1, 1875, Sternberg was promoted major, and in April 1879, he was ordered to Washington, D. C., and detailed with the 1880 Havana Yellow Fever Commission. His medical colleagues on the Commission were Doctors Stanfard Chaille of New Orleans and Juan Guiteras of Havana. Sternberg was assigned to work on the problems relating to the nature and natural history of the disease and especially to its etiology (origins). This involved the microscopical examination of blood and tissues in which he was one of the first to employ the newly discovered process of photomicrography. He developed high efficiency in its use. In the course of this work, he spent three months in Havana closely associated with Dr. Carlos Finlay, the main proponent of the theory of mosquito transmission of yellow fever.

====Bacteriology milestones====
In 1880, the Commission concluded that the solution of yellow fever causality must await further progress in the new science of bacteriology. Sternberg was soon sent to New Orleans to investigate the conflicting discoveries of &quot;Plasmodium malariae&quot; by Alphonse Laveran, and of &quot;Bacillus malariae&quot; by Edwin Klebs and Corrado Tommasi-Crudeli. His report (1881) declared that the &quot;Bacillus malariae&quot; had no part in the causation of malaria. The same year—simultaneously with Louis Pasteur—he announced the discovery of the pneumococcus, eventually recognized as the pathogenic agent of lobar pneumonia. He was the first in the United States to demonstrate the &quot;Plasmodium&quot; organism as cause of malaria (1885) and to confirm the causitive roles of the bacilli of tuberculosis and typhoid fever (1886). He was the first scientist to produce photomicrographs of the tubercule bacillus. He was also the earliest American pioneer in the related field of disinfection in which he began with experiments (1878) with putrefactive bacteria. This work was continued in Washington and in the laboratories of Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore, under the auspices of the American Public Health Association. For his essay &quot;Disinfection and Individual Prophylaxis against Infectious Diseases&quot; (1886), later translated into several languages, he was awarded the Lomb Prize. He oversaw creation the US Army enlisted hospital corps (&quot;medics&quot;) in 1887.

During the Hamburg cholera epidemic of 1892 he was detailed for duty with the New York quarantine station as a consultant on disinfection as applied to ships, their personnel, and cargo. Although some cases of the disease reached United States shores, none developed within the country.

====Surgeon General====
Sternberg was promoted to lieutenant colonel on January 2, 1891. In 1892 he published his &quot;Manual of Bacteriology&quot;, the first exhaustive treatise on the subject produced in the United States. With the retirement of Surgeon General Sutherland (May 1893), Sternberg, along with many others, submitted his claims for consideration for the vacancy. Although hardly the seniormost officer in the Medical Corps, he was among the top dozen and was without question the most eminent professional scientist in the service. He received the appointment of Surgeon General by President Grover Cleveland on May 30, 1893, succeeding Charles Sutherland and receiving promotion to brigadier general.

Sternberg&#x27;s nine-year tenure (1893–1902) as Surgeon General coincided with immense professional progress in the field of bacteriology as well as the occurrence of the Spanish–American War. He was responsible for the 1893 establishment of the Army Medical School (precursor of today&#x27;s Walter Reed Army Institute of Research), the organization of a contract dental service, the creation of the tuberculosis hospital at Fort Bayard, New Mexico, and of a special surgical hospital at Washington Barracks. The equipment of the medical school included laboratories of chemistry and bacteriology, and a liberal-minded policy was adopted in the supply of laboratory supplies to the larger military hospitals. With the Spanish–American War and its epidemic of typhoid fever, the problem of field hospitalization was confronted with fair success. (He was subjected to much criticism for conditions at these hospitals, but made little reply.) Sternberg created the Typhoid Fever Board (1898), consisting of Majors Walter Reed, Victor C. Vaughan, and Edward O. Shakespeare, which established the facts of contact infection and fly carriage of the disease. In 1900 he organized the Yellow Fever Commission, headed by Reed, which ultimately fixed the transmission of yellow fever upon a particular species of mosquito. (These became celebrated as the &quot;Walter Reed Boards&quot;). On his recommendation the first tropical disease board was also established in Manila (January 1900) where it continued for about the next two years. In 1901, Sternberg oversaw the establishment of the U.S. Army Nurse Corps. In July 1900, Sternberg recognized Elizabeth Fleischman for her radiographic work with X-rays on the wounded soldiers during the Spanish–American War.

Sternberg was retired on account of age on June 8, 1902, and devoted the later years of his life to social welfare activities in Washington, particularly to the sanitary improvement of dwellings and to the care of tuberculous patients. Sternberg died at his home in Washington, on November 3, 1915. He was buried at Arlington National Cemetery.

==Memberships and awards==
Sternberg was a member of the Military Order of the Loyal Legion of the United States, the Society of the Army of the Potomac, the Sons of the American Revolution and the Association of Military Surgeons of the United States.

He was awarded the Civil War Campaign Medal and the Indian Campaign Medal. He was posthumously eligible for the Spanish War Service Medal.

==Legacy==
On Sternberg&#x27;s monument in Arlington National Cemetery is the inscription:

Pioneer American Bacteriologist, distinguished by his studies of the causation and prevention of infectious diseases, by his discovery of the microorganism causing pneumonia, and scientific investigations of yellow fever, which paved the way for the experimental demonstration of the mode of transmission of this pestilence. Veteran of three wars, breveted for bravery in action in the Civil War and the Nez Perce Wars. Served as Surgeon General of United States Army for period of nine years including the Spanish War. Founder of the Army Medical School. Scientist, author and philanthropist. M. D., LL. D.

Along with Pasteur and Koch, Sternberg is credited with first bringing the fundamental principles and techniques of the new science of bacteriology within the reach of the average physician.

A collection of his papers is held at the National Library of Medicine in Bethesda, Maryland.

<text>John Batterson Stetson (May 5, 1830 – February 18, 1906) was an American hat maker who invented the cowboy hat in the 1860s. He founded the John B. Stetson Company in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, in 1865, and it became one of the largest hat manufacturers in the world. The company&#x27;s hats are now commonly referred to simply as Stetsons.

His philanthropy helped fund Temple University and Stetson University, as well as a YMCA and a homeless shelter/soup kitchen in Philadelphia. His mansion, the John B. Stetson House, in DeLand, Florida, was placed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1978.

==Early life==
Stetson was born on May 5, 1830, in Orange, New Jersey, one of 12 children. His father, Stephen Stetson, was a hatter and taught his son the trade. He never attended school but was taught to read and write at home by his mother. In the late 1850s, Stetson was diagnosed with tuberculosis and his doctor predicted he had only a short time to live. He left the hat-making business to explore the American West before he died.

He moved first to Illinois, and then to Saint Joseph, Missouri. In Saint Joseph, he worked in a brickyard and eventually became manager and part-owner, however the business was ruined in a flood. He attempted to enroll in the military during the American Civil War but was rejected due to his health condition. He accepted a position in a party travelling to Pike&#x27;s Peak in Colorado. During the trip to Colorado, Stetson relied on his hat-making skills to turn animal pelts into felt for usage by him and his travelling companions as water-proof tents and hats. He had the inkling of a future business when a bullwhacker bought one of his hats from him for $5. He worked as a gold miner at Pike&#x27;s Peak for one year. His health improved and he returned to Philadelphia to begin a hat making business.

==Career==

In 1865, Stetson moved to Philadelphia and founded the John B. Stetson Company to manufacture hats suited to the needs of Westerners. He created a modified sombrero and sent samples of the Boss of the Plains style he had invented to dealers in the West and was soon inundated with requests for more. These lightweight hats were natural in color with four inch crowns and brims; a plain strap was used for the band.

Due to the time he had spent with cowboys and Western settlers, Stetson knew firsthand that the headwear they wore (such as coonskin caps, sea captain hats, straw hats, and wool derbies) were impractical. He decided to offer people a better hat. Made from waterproof felt, the new hat was durable and the wide brim protected the wearer from the sun and rain.

One observer noted, &quot;It kept the sun out of your eyes and off your neck. It was like an umbrella. It gave you a bucket (the crown) to water your horse and a cup (the brim) to water yourself. It made a hell of a fan, which you need sometimes for a fire but more often to shunt cows this direction or that.&quot;

Stetson went on to build the Carlsbad, easily identified by its main crease down the front. His hat was called a Stetson, because he had his name John B. Stetson Company embossed in gold in every hatband. The Stetson soon became the most well known hat in the West. All the high-crowned, wide-brimmed, soft felt western hats that followed are intimately associated with the cowboy image created by Stetson.

The Stetson Cowboy hat was the symbol of the highest quality. Western icons such as Buffalo Bill Cody, Calamity Jane, Will Rogers, Annie Oakley, Pawnee Bill, Tom Mix, and the Lone Ranger wore Stetsons. The company also made hats for the Texas Rangers, which became the first law enforcement agency to incorporate the cowboy hat into their uniform. Stetson&#x27;s Western-style hats were worn by employees of the National Park Service, U.S. Cavalry soldiers, and U.S. Presidents, including Lyndon B. Johnson, Ronald Reagan and George W. Bush. The militaries of Britain, Canada and South Africa have incorporated the Stetson into their uniforms.

===John B. Stetson Company===
Under Stetson&#x27;s direction, The John B. Stetson Company became one of the largest hat firms in the world. The plant in Philadelphia covered over five acres and contained over 24 acres of floor space. Stetson hats won numerous awards, but as his company grew, he &quot;faced the challenge of developing a reliable labor force.&quot; Reportedly, &quot;people working in the hat trade at that time tended to drift from employer to employer&quot; and &quot;absenteeism was rampant.&quot; Stetson, &quot;guided by Baptist religious principles, believed that by providing for his employees he would lend stability to their lives and attract higher caliber ones.&quot; Unlike most other employers, Stetson decided to offer benefits to entice workers to stay. Stetson also made sure his employees had a clean, safe place to work, including building a hospital, a park and houses for his 5,000 employees. Stetson&#x27;s unusual moves helped him build a factory in Philadelphia that grew to 25 buildings on . By 1915, nine years after Stetson&#x27;s death, 5,400 employees produced 3.3 million hats.

==Philanthropy and legacy==
While Stetson profited from his business, he also wanted to give back to his community. Near the end of his life, Stetson donated almost all of his money to charitable organizations. He built grammar and high schools and helped build colleges, including Temple and Stetson Universities. He also helped establish the YMCA in Philadelphia. Stetson donated generously to the DeLand Academy in DeLand, Florida, which was renamed John B. Stetson University in 1889. In 1900, Stetson University founded the first law school in Florida: Stetson University College of Law.

In 1878, Stetson co-founded the Sunday Breakfast Rescue Mission, a homeless shelter and soup kitchen. Sunday Breakfast Rescue Mission has expanded to provide more services, changed their name to Philly House, and is still active in support of the homeless population of Philadelphia.
Stetson owned an 8,000 ft² mansion in DeLand, Florida, known as the John B. Stetson House. It is a mixture of Gothic, Tudor, and Moorish styles, and is open to the public for tours. Stetson died in his mansion on February 18, 1906. He was originally interred at Laurel Hill Cemetery in Philadelphia and re-interred in West Laurel Hill Cemetery, Bala Cynwyd, Pennsylvania.

The John B. Stetson Middle School in Philadelphia was built in 1915 and named in his honor.

<text>Micrography (from Greek, literally small-writing – &quot;Μικρογραφία&quot;), also called microcalligraphy, is a Jewish form of calligrams developed in the 9th century, with parallels in Christianity and Islam, utilizing minute Hebrew letters to form representational, geometric and abstract designs. Colored micrography is especially distinctive because these rare artworks are customarily rendered in black and white.

== Description ==
The artwork is created from text that forms an image when viewed at a distance, creating an interplay between the text and image. The photomosaic, whose tiny individual images form a mosaic when viewed from a distance, is a modern analogue. Another modern analogue is ASCII art, where ASCII or extended ASCII characters are arranged to form an image on a computer screen and/or printout.

== Motivation ==
There is a relationship between this form of art, employing both digital and analogic symbols, and the restrictions on images found in the second commandment. Micrography provides a unique solution to the visual artist who wishes to remain devout in observation of Jewish law, by using only text, not images per se. As similar restrictions exist in certain Muslim societies, this solution has been adapted in Islamic calligraphy to the Arabic alphabet as well.

<text>Edward Reilly Stettinius (February 15, 1865 – September 3, 1925) was an American executive. He was president of Diamond Match Company in Barberton, Ohio, for a time. After the start of World War I, he worked at J. P. Morgan and Company coordinating the purchase of war supplies for the Allies. When the United States entered the war, he went to work in its War Department.

==Biography==
Stettinius was born in St. Louis, Missouri. His father was a wholesale grocer.

He was educated at St. Louis University. The needs of his family obligated him to drop out of school at age 16, and he went to work for a grocery firm and then a hat and cap firm. He then tried several lines of business on his own account, but was not very successful, and went to work in a banking firm.

By 1891, both his mother and father had died, and he went to the commodity exchange at the Chicago Board of Trade, but did not find that he could satisfactorily predict the price of wheat and left to become treasurer in the Stirling Boiler Company. The business panic of 1893 obligated him to add several other tasks to the one of treasurer. As conditions improved, he began to work in sales, doing well enough that he became general manager of the company. His participation in the merger of that company and several others in the same line to form Babcock &amp; Wilcox helped his reputation, and he was recruited to work at Diamond Match Company, where he became president in 1909. His employer at Stirling was O. C. Barber, who also used his influence to make him president at Diamond Match, where Stettinius succeeded him.

At the beginning of World War I, Stettinius went to work as a partner for J. P. Morgan and Company where he worked as chief buyer of war supplies for the Allies, overseeing a work force of around 150 people. When the United States entered the war, he went to work for the War Department, in charge of procurement and production of supplies for the Army.

<text>The House of Kamehameha &quot;(Hale O Kamehameha)&quot;, or the Kamehameha dynasty, was the reigning royal family of the Kingdom of Hawaii, beginning with its founding by Kamehameha I in 1795 and ending with the death of Kamehameha V in 1872 and Lunalilo in 1874. The kingdom continued for another 21 years, until its overthrow in 1893 with the fall of the House of Kalakaua.

==Origins of the Kamehameha dynasty==

===Originating lines===
The origins of the House of Kamehameha stems from the progenitor, Keōua Kalanikupuapa`ikalaninui who was the sacred father of Kamehameha I and by the royal court of his brother Kalaniʻōpuʻu who later became king and gave his war god Kuka&#x27;ilimoku to Kamehameha I. Kalaniʻōpuʻu&#x27;s father was Kalaninuiʻīamamao and Keōua&#x27;s father was Kalanikeʻeaumoku, both were sons of Keaweʻīkekahialiʻiokamoku. They shared a common mother, Kamakaʻīmoku. Both brothers served Alapaʻinui, the ruling King of Hawaiʻi island at the time. Contemporary Hawaiian genealogy notes that Keōua may not have been Kamehameha&#x27;s biological father, and that Kahekili II might have been the figure&#x27;s real father. But official genealogies of the chiefs as well as the rulers themselves confirm that Keōua was the true father. Kamehameha I&#x27;s mother was Kekuʻiapoiwa II, a granddaughter of Keawe.

Kamehameha I&#x27;s exact birth date is uncertain. The traditional mele chant of Keaka, wife of Alapaʻinui, indicates that Kamehameha I was born in the month of &quot;ikuwā&quot; (winter) or around November. Alapaʻi gave the child to his wife Keaka and her sister Hākau to care for. Samuel Kamakau, in his newspaper article writes &quot;It was during the time of the warfare among the chiefs of [the island of] Hawaii which followed the death of Keawe, chief over the whole island (Ke-awe-i-kekahi-aliʻi-o-ka-moku) that Kamehameha I was born&quot;. However, his general dating has been challenged. Abraham Fornander writes in his publication, &quot;An Account of the Polynesian Race: Its Origins and Migrations&quot;: &quot;when Kamehameha died in 1819 he was past eighty years old. His birth would thus fall between 1736 and 1740, probably nearer the former than the latter&quot;. &quot;A brief history of the Hawaiian people&quot; By William De Witt Alexander lists the birth date in the Chronological Table of Events of Hawaiian History&quot; as 1736. He would be named Paiea but would take the name Kamehameha, meaning &quot;The lonely one&quot; or &quot;The one who has been set apart&quot;.

Kalaniʻōpuʻu, the young Kamehameha&#x27;s uncle, would raise him after his father&#x27;s death. Kalaniʻōpuʻu ruled &quot;Hawaiʻi&quot; as did his grandfather Keawe. He had a number of advisors and priests. When word reached the ruler that chiefs were planning to murder the boy, he told Kamehameha:

===Cook&#x27;s arrival and death===

In 1778 Captain James Cook visited the Hawaiian Islands and returned in 1779. When his ship, &quot;Resolution&quot; broke a foremast as they were leaving, he was forced to turn back and return to Kealakekua Bay. A fight and theft of blacksmith tools led to a situation on shore where a Hawaiian canoe was confiscated, even after the tools were recovered. Tensions were high with the Hawaiian population and one of Cook&#x27;s small boats was taken. In retaliation, Cook decided to kidnap King Kalaniʻōpuʻu. As he was being led away from his royal enclosure, his favorite wife, Kānekapōlei began to shout to the townspeople to get their attention. Two chiefs, Kalaimanokahoowaha (also known as Kanaina nui) and a royal attendant named Nuaa, saw her pleading as the King was being led away with his two sons following. As they reached the beach Kanaina, Kānekapōlei and Nuaa were able to convince Kalaniʻōpuʻu to stop and he sat where he stood. The crowd began to become aggressive and a rock was thrown and hit Cook. He took out his sword and struck Kanaina broadside without injury, but the chief reacted and immediately seized Cook and held him in his grip when the king&#x27;s attendant, Nuaa stabbed him from behind. Before the remains of Cook were returned, the bones of the man were boiled down to strip off the flesh then given to chiefs. Kamehameha received Captain Cook&#x27;s hair.

===Kamehameha I, founder of the Kingdom of Hawaii===

After Kalaniʻōpuʻu&#x27;s death, Kīwalaʻō would take his father&#x27;s place as first born and rule the island while Kamehameha would have religious authority. A number of chiefs supported Kamehameha and war soon broke out to overthrow Kīwalaʻō. After a number of battles the king was killed and envoys sent for the last two brothers to meet with Kamehameha. Keōua and Kaōleiokū arrived in separate canoes. Keōua came to shore first where a fight broke out and he and all aboard were killed. Before the same could happen to the second canoe, Kamehameha intervened. By 1795, Kamehameha had conquered all of the islands but Kauai and Niihau. He would come to control them as well in 1810 when Kaumualiʻi, king of both, formally recognized Kamehameha as his suzerain.

For his first royal residence, the new King built the first western-style structure built in the Hawaiian Islands, known as the &quot;Brick Palace&quot;. The king commissioned the structure to be built at Keawa&#x27;iki point in Lahaina, Maui. Two foreign, ex-convicts from Australia&#x27;s Botany Bay penal colony built the home. It was begun in 1798 and was completed after 4 years in 1802. The house was intended for Kaʻahumanu, but she refused to live in the structure and resided instead in a traditional Hawaiian-styled home only feet away.

Kamehameha I had many wives but held two the most high regard. Keōpūolani was the highest ranking aliʻi of her time and mother to his sons, Liholiho and Kauikeaouli. Kaʻahumanu was his favorite. Kamehameha I died in 1819 and his son, Liholiho would become the next king.

==New king and form of government==

===Kamehameha II, and the new office of Kuhina Nui===

After Kamehameha I&#x27;s death, his first born son Liholiho left Kailua for a week and returned to be crowned king. At the lavish ceremony attended by commoners and nobles of the kingdom he approached the circle of chiefs, as Kaʻahumanu, the central figure in the group and Dowager Queen, spoke: &quot;Hear me O Divine one, for I make known to you the will of your father. Behold these chiefs and the men of your father, and these your guns, and this your land, but you and I shall share the realm together&quot; Liholiho agreed officially, which began a unique system of dual-government consisting of a King and co-ruler similar to a co-regent. The new Kamehameha II would share his rule with his stepmother, Kaʻahumanu. She would defy Hawaiian &quot;kapu&quot; by dining with the young king, violating the law separating genders during meals and leading to the destruction of the old Hawaiian religion. Kamehameha II died, along with his wife, Queen Kamāmalu in 1824 on a state visit to England where they succumbed to measles. He was King for only 5 years.

When Kamehameha II and his queen died in England, the remains of the couple were returned to Hawaii by Boki. On board the ship, &quot;The Blond&quot; his wife Liliha and Kekūanaōʻa would be baptized as Christians. Kaʻahumanu would also convert and become a heavy Christian influence on Hawaiian society until her death in 1832. Since the new king was only 12 years old, Kaʻahumanu was now senior ruler and named Boki as her Kuhina Nui.

Boki would leave Hawaii on a fatal trip to find sandlewood to cover a debt and would be lost at sea. His wife, Liliha would be left the governorship of Maui and would unsuccessfully attempt to whip up revolt against Kaʻahumanu, who, upon Boki&#x27;s departure, had installed Kīnaʻu as a co-governor.

===Kaʻahumanu===

Kaʻahumanu was born on Maui around 1777. Her parents were aliʻi chiefs of a lower ranking line. She became Kamehameha&#x27;s consort when she was fourteen. George Vancouver states: &quot;[O]ne of the finest woman we had yet seen on any of the islands&quot;. To wed the young woman, Kamehameha had to consent to make Kaʻahumanu&#x27;s children his heirs to the Kingdom although, in the end, she produced no issue.

Before his death, Kamehameha selected Kaʻahumanu to rule along with his son. Kaʻahumanu had also adopted the boy. She had the highest political clout in the islands. A portrait artist remarked of her: &quot;This Old Dame is the most proud, unbending Lady in the whole island. As the widow of [Kamehameha], she possesses unbound authority and respect, not any of which she is inclined to lay aside on any occasion whatsoever&quot;. She is one of the most influential leaders in Hawaii&#x27;s history.

==Kamehameha III, Kaʻahumanu II, III, &quot;moi kuʻi, au-puni kuʻi&quot; and the Great Māhele==

Liholiho&#x27;s death elevated his younger brother, Kauikeaouli to the throne, styled as Kamehameha III at the age of twelve. When Kaʻahumanu died Kauikeaouli was 18.

With the death of the Kuhina Nui, the young king demanded to come into the possession of his full inheritance. He immediately rebelled against the Christian church and suspended all laws except murder and theft, which was a common tradition after the death of a chief. Distilleries were re-opened and the ban of alcohol lifted as was the ban on Hula. For his co-ruler, Kamehameha chose his aikāne (same sex partner), Kaomi. a young, half Tahitian man who had helped to heal the king and had been a close relationship for years. The church was outraged. Kaomi was granted true authority which he yielded. Eventually Kamehameha III, under pressure from the church, would remove the young man and would name Liliha to be the next Kuhina Nui. In November 1833, Hoapili (Liliha&#x27;s father), Kekūanaōʻa, Kanaina and Kīnaʻu, along with armed royal attendants, including Kilinahe, went to the king&#x27;s home to persuade him not to pick Liliha as Kuhina Nui. Hoapili begged the king to kill him if he should choose his daughter so the people would not blame him for her elevation. They pleaded with the king to choose Kinau as a true daughter of the House of Kamehameha. The King agreed and when he sent for Liliha to tell her the news, she was found drunk at home.

Kīnaʻu would be succeeded by Kekāuluohi as Kuhina Nui, acting for the true heir to the position, Victoria Kamāmalu, Kīnaʻu&#x27;s infant daughter. Kekāuluohi would be styled as Kaʻahumanu III. After Kekāuluohi died in 1845, the next Kuhina Nui would be Keoni Ana, the son of John Young, one of Kamehameha I&#x27;s important foreign advisors. Kauikeaouli named an heir, his nephew, Alexander ʻIolani Liholiho who took the throne styled as Kamehameha IV in 1855. The third Kamehameha instituted the Great Mahele, which gave up millions of acres of land passed from his brother, who inherited it from Kamehameha I, leaving all to him as the ruler of the kingdom. Kamehameha III had illegitimate twin sons by Jane Lahilahi named Kīwalaʻō (died young) and Albert Kūnuiākea (1851–1903).

==Kamehameha IV and Queen Emma==
Alexander ʻIolani Liholiho was the nephew of Kamehameha II and grandson of Kamehameha I. He reigned as Kamehameha IV. Along with his wife Queen Emma, Kamehameha IV would establish the Queen&#x27;s Medical Center. He was the son of Kīnaʻu, daughter of Kamehameha I and Kekūanaōʻa, a high ranking warrior chief from the conquest of the islands who became Governor of Oahu. He ascended the throne at the age of 21. He was a tall man often described as handsome. His wife was, Emma Naea Rooke, granddaughter of John Young. The couple had one child, a son named Albert Edward Kauikeaouli who died at the age of 4 years old leaving the throne to pass to his uncle.

==Kamehameha V and the last Kamehameha king==
Lot Kapuāiwa became king in 1863 styled as Kamehameha V. Lot was a bachelor up to his death in 1872 bringing to an end the Kamehameha Dynasty. However, Lot had an illegitimate daughter Keanolani by his classmate Abigail Maheha at the Chiefs&#x27; Children&#x27;s School.

On his deathbed, before his passing, he offered the throne to Elizabeth Keka&#x27;aniau and Bernice Pauahi Bishop but they both refused it. Finally, Kamehameha V stated: &quot;The throne belongs to Lunalilo; I will not appoint him, because I consider him unworthy of the position. The constitution, in case I make no nomination, provides for the election of the next King; let it be so.&quot; He would die the following morning. This enabled an election from the original stock of ali&#x27;i who were groomed for the position to rule by royal decree of King Kamehameha III. The Princes and Chiefs of rank, eligible to be rulers who were groomed at the original Chiefs&#x27; Children&#x27;s School.

==Lunalilo==
William Charles Lunalilo was the highest chief in the Hawaiian Kingdom of his time. He became the first elected monarch of the Hawaiian Kingdom and would be the last of the Kamehameha dynasty. Lunalilo was the son of Charles Kanaʻina and Miriam Auhea Kekauluohi, a niece of Kamehameha I through her father Kalaimamahu, Kamehameha I&#x27;s half-brother. However, she was a formal member of the House of Kamehameha as a wife of the founding monarch in his last years. Lunalilo was also a member of the House of Keōua and the House of Moana. His mother was taken by Kamehameha, after her birth and given to Kaʻahumanu because she could not conceive. Kekauluohi was a punalua child, having dual parentage. Lunalilo was the last Kamehameha monarch.
==Family tree==

==Legacy==
The British name of the &quot;Sandwich Islands&quot; was replaced with &quot;Hawaiʻi&quot; due to the influence of the House of Kamehameha.

A good portion of the legacy of the Kamehamehas&#x27; lies in the lands and fortunes passed down to Bernice Pauahi Bishop. After her death in 1884, her husband, Charles Bishop, acting as one of five trustees and a co-executer of Pauahi&#x27;s will, began the process of establishing the Kamehameha Schools which was founded in 1887. Charles Bishop would serve as president of the Board of trustees for the Bernice Pauahi Bishop Estate, a perpetual trust with Kamehameha Schools the sole beneficiary, and gave back to the estate all lands deeded to him during his life and helped fund the first structures of the school out of his own money. In 1889, the Bernice Pauahi Bishop Museum was founded and endowed by Charles Bishop as a repository for the priceless Hawaiian artifacts from Pauahi&#x27;s family. Princess Ruth Ke&#x27;elikōlani was the daughter of Pauahi and Mataio Kekūanaōʻa, and a governess of the Big Island of Hawai&#x27;i.
