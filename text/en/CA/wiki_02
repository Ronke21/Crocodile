<text>Yossel Mashel Slovo (23 May 1926 – 6 January 1995), commonly known as Joe Slovo, was a South African politician, and an opponent of the apartheid system. A Marxist-Leninist, he was a long-time leader and theorist in the South African Communist Party (SACP), a leading member of the African National Congress (ANC), and a commander of the ANC&#x27;s military wing uMkhonto we Sizwe (MK).
Slovo was a delegate to the multiracial Congress of the People of June 1955 which drew up the Freedom Charter. He was imprisoned for six months in 1960, and emerged as a leader of uMkhonto we Sizwe the following year. He lived in exile from 1963 to 1990, conducting operations against the apartheid régime from the United Kingdom, Angola, Mozambique, and Zambia. In 1990, he returned to South Africa, and took part in the negotiations that ended apartheid. He became known for proposing the &quot;sunset clauses&quot; covering the 5 years following a democratic election, including guarantees and concessions to all sides, and his fierce non-racialist stance. After the elections of 1994, he became Minister for Housing in Nelson Mandela&#x27;s government. He died of cancer in 1995.

== Life ==
Slovo was born on 23 May 1926 in Obeliai, Lithuania, to a Jewish family that emigrated to the Union of South Africa when he was eight. His father worked as a truck driver in Johannesburg. Although his family were religious, he became an atheist who retained respect for &quot;the positive aspects of Jewish culture&quot;. Slovo was educated at King Edward VII School and left school in 1941 and found work as a dispatch clerk. He joined the National Union of Distributive Workers and, as a shop steward, was involved in organising a strike.

Slovo joined the South African Communist Party in 1942. Inspired by the Red Army&#x27;s battles against the Nazis on the Eastern Front of World War II, Slovo volunteered to fight in the war. He served as a Signaler in combat operations for the South African forces in North Africa and Italy, and on his return to South Africa he joined the Springbok Legion, a multiracial radical ex-servicemen&#x27;s organization.

Between 1946 and 1950 he completed a law degree at the University of the Witswatersrand and was a student activist. He was in the same class as Nelson Mandela and Harry Schwarz. In 1949 he married Ruth First, another prominent Jewish anti-apartheid activist and the daughter of SACP treasurer Julius First. They had three daughters, Shawn, Gillian and Robyn. Ruth First was assassinated in 1982 in Maputo, by order of Craig Williamson, a major in the South African Police.

In 1950, the SACP was banned and both First and Slovo were listed as communists under the Suppression of Communism Act and could not be quoted or attend public gatherings in South Africa. He became active in the South African Congress of Democrats (an ally of the ANC as part of the Congress Alliance) and was a delegate to the June 1955 Congress of the People organised by the ANC and Indian, Coloured and white organisations at Kliptown near Johannesburg, that drew up the Freedom Charter. He was arrested and detained for two months during the Treason Trial of 1956. Charges against him were dropped in 1958. He was later arrested for six months during the State of Emergency declared after the Sharpeville massacre in 1960.
In 1961, Slovo and Abongz Mbede emerged as two of the leaders of uMkhonto we Sizwe (MK), the military wing of the ANC, formed in alliance between the ANC and the SACP. In 1963 he went into exile and lived in Britain, Angola, Mozambique and Zambia. In his capacity as chief of staff of MK he codetermined its activities, like the 1983 Church Street bombing. In 1982, Slovo&#x27;s wife, Ruth First was assassinated in Maputo, Mozambique, where the couple lived in exile. In 1984, Slovo, an ANC and SACP member, was forced to leave Mozambique in terms of the Nkomati Accord between the Marxist People&#x27;s Republic of Mozambique and apartheid South Africa. In 1984, he was elected general secretary of the SACP in Lusaka, Zambia, and in 1985, he became the first white member of the ANC&#x27;s national executive.

Slovo was a leading theoretician in both the SACP and the ANC. In the 1970s he wrote the influential essay &quot;South Africa: No Middle Road&quot;, which argued that the apartheid government would be unable to achieve stability, co-opt significant sections of the small but growing black middle class, or democratise: the only choice was between an insurrectionary overthrow of apartheid, centred on MK, or even greater repression.

At the time the SACP&#x27;s orthodox pro-Soviet and two-stage view of change in South Africa – &quot;national democratic revolution&quot; first, socialism later – was dominant in the ANC-led liberation movement. Slovo&#x27;s 1988 &quot;The South African Working Class and the National Democratic Revolution&quot; defended the two-stage conception, insisting that &quot;national democratic revolution&quot; would &quot;implement economic measures which go far beyond bourgeois-democracy&quot; and so &quot;erect a favourable framework for a socialist transformation but will not, in themselves, create, or necessarily lead to, socialism&quot;.

In 1989, he wrote &quot;Has Socialism Failed?&quot; which acknowledged the weaknesses of the socialist movement and the excesses of Stalinism, while at the same time rejecting attempts by the left to distance themselves from socialism. Slovo insisted on having a &quot;justified confidence in the future of socialism and its inherent moral superiority&quot;, and pointing to &quot;the failures of capitalism&quot;, although he now rejected the one-party state model.

In May 1990, after 27 years of exile, Slovo returned to the country to participate in the early &quot;talks about talks&quot; between the government and the ANC. Ailing, he stood down as SACP general secretary in 1991 and was given the titular position of SACP chairperson. Slovo was succeeded by Chris Hani, who was assassinated two years later by a white right-winger. Slovo was a long-demonised figure in white South African society, widely misrepresented as a KGB colonel or Russian secret agent, and attracted a great deal of press after his return.

In 1992, Slovo secured a major breakthrough in the negotiations to end apartheid in South Africa by presenting the &quot;sunset clauses&quot; developed by the ANC/ SACP leadership: a coalition government for five years following democratic elections, guarantees for civil servants, including the homelands and armed forces, and an amnesty process. These were intended to head off right-wing coups and destabilisation. However, Slovo specifically rejected any compromise on full majority rule, and any agreement that &quot;constitutionally prevented permanently&quot; a new government &quot;from effectively intervening to advance the process of redressing the racially accumulated imbalances in all spheres of life&quot;.

Slovo was a harsh critic of Israel, which he viewed as an apartheid state, and has been described among &quot;people who want to see justice in struggles wherever they are fought&quot;.

After the elections of 1994, Slovo became Minister for housing in Nelson Mandela&#x27;s government, until his death in 1995 of cancer. His funeral was attended by the entire high command of the ANC, and by most of the highest officials in the country, including both Nelson Mandela and Thabo Mbeki, and he was buried in Avalon Cemetery, Soweto, which was unheard of for a white South African. 50,000 people, virtually all black, attended the event.

=== Civic and similar tributes ===
In 2004 Slovo was voted 47th in the Top 100 Great South Africans. Shack settlements built on land occupations in both Durban and Cape Town were named after Joe Slovo by their founders. Harrow Road in Johannesburg and Field Street in Durban Central were renamed Joe Slovo Drive and Joe Slovo Street respectively. A newly constructed Residence building at Rhodes University in Grahamstown, South Africa, has been named &quot;Joe Slovo&quot; in honour of the man. The Congress of South African Trade Unions, the largest union federation in South Africa, and an ally of the ANC and SACP, helps organise the annual Joe Slovo Memorial Lecture and normally issues a statement on the anniversary of his death. Slovo was widely admired across southern Africa, leading Zimbabwean magazine, &quot;Southern African Political and Economic Monthly&quot; running a special issue on his death, and describing Slovo in an obituary as a &quot;liberation war hero&quot; and &quot;African patriot&quot; completely immersed in the struggle for black freedom.

=== Cinema and music ===
Joe Slovo appears as a character in two films for which his daughter Shawn Slovo wrote the screenplay. In the award-winning 1988 movie &quot;A World Apart&quot;, he is depicted as &quot;Gus Roth&quot; (played by Jeroen Krabbé). He is played by Malcolm Purkey in the 2006 film &quot;Catch A Fire.&quot;

<doc id="757159" wikidata="Q7241254" url="?curid=757159" title="President and Fellows of Harvard College">
<text>The President and Fellows of Harvard College, also called the Harvard Corporation or just the Corporation, is the smaller and more powerful of Harvard University&#x27;s two governing boards. It refers to itself as the oldest corporation in the Western Hemisphere. At full capacity, as of 2024, the corporation consists of twelve fellows as well as the president of Harvard University, for a total of thirteen members.

The Corporation and the Board of Overseers exercise institutional roles that, at most other colleges and universities, are more commonly consolidated into a single board of trustees.

Although the institution it governs has grown into a university of which Harvard College is one component, the corporation&#x27;s name remains &quot;The President and Fellows of Harvard College&quot;.

== Structure ==
The Harvard Corporation is a 501(c)(3) and the owner of all of Harvard University&#x27;s assets and real property. 

As a governing board, the Corporation traditionally functioned as an outside body whose members were not involved in the institution&#x27;s daily life, meeting instead periodically to consult with the day-to-day head, the president of Harvard University, whom it appoints, and who also serves as a member. The Corporation is self-perpetuating, appointing new members to fill its own vacancies as they arise.

For most of its history, the Corporation consisted of six fellows in addition to the president. But after the presidency of Lawrence Summers from 2001 to 2006, and a large endowment decline after the Great Recession in 2008–2009, a year-long governance review was conducted. In December 2010, it announced that the Corporation&#x27;s &quot;composition, structure, and practices&quot; would be altered: the number of fellows would increase from six to twelve, with prescribed terms of service, and several new committees would endeavor to improve the group&#x27;s integration with the activities of the University as a whole, especially its long-term planning.
==History==
=== 17th century ===
Starting in 1636, the affairs and funds of Harvard College were managed by a committee of the Great and General Court of Massachusetts. In 1650, at the request of Harvard&#x27;s first president Henry Dunster, the Great and General Court of Massachusetts issued the body a charter. 

The Charter of 1650 established the Harvard Corporation board which consisted of seven members: a President, five Fellows, and a Treasurer. The Corporation had the authority to manage the College&#x27;s finances, real estate, and donations, act as a legal entity in courts of law, select officers and servants, and create orders and bylaws for the College, with the approval of the Board of Overseers.

The founding members of the Harvard Corporation were respectively: Henry Dunster as President, Samuel Mather, Samuel Danforth, Jonathan Mitchell, Comfort Starr and Samuel Eaton as the five Fellows and Thomas Danforth as the Treasurer. These men had, in perpetual succession, the duties of managing the College.

=== 18th century ===
The 1780 Constitution of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts reaffirmed that, despite the change in government due to the American Revolution, the corporation would continue to &quot;have, hold, use, exercise and enjoy&quot; its property and legal privileges. However it further noted that &quot;nothing herein shall be construed to prevent the legislature of this commonwealth from making such alterations in the government of the said university.&quot;

=== 19th century ===
In 1805, the election of Henry Ware as Hollis Professor of Divinity placed the Corporation, then politically Federalist and religiously Unitarian, at odds with Massachusetts politics that was increasingly Democratic-Republican and still Trinitarian.

=== 21st century ===
In December 2023, the Corporation came under scrutiny by the United States House of Representatives, after a House Committee hearing on antisemitism. The following month, in January 2024, the House Ways and Means Committee, which has jurisdiction over university tax status and endowments, probed the tax status of Harvard and three other universities, over allegations of inadequate responses to antisemitism.

On May 22, 2024, one day before the annual Harvard Commencement ceremony, the corporation refused to give diplomas to thirteen seniors of Harvard College involved in pro-Palestinian protests, overruling a vote of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences that included the students on the list of graduating students. Critics called it an attempt &quot;to kill faculty governance&quot; from a body that is usually &quot;publicity-shy&quot;.

==Current membership==
As of May 2024, there are currently thirteen members of the Corporation, including the University president, who sets the agenda but does not vote.

<text>David Merrill Markson (December 20, 1927 – June 4, 2010) was an American novelist. He was the author of several postmodern novels, including &quot;Springer&#x27;s Progress&quot;, &quot;Wittgenstein&#x27;s Mistress&quot;, and &quot;Reader&#x27;s Block&quot;. His final book, &quot;The Last Novel&quot;, published in 2007, was called &quot;a real tour de force&quot; by &quot;The New York Times&quot;.

Markson&#x27;s work is characterized by an unconventional and experimental approach to narrative, character development and plot. The late writer David Foster Wallace hailed &quot;Wittgenstein&#x27;s Mistress&quot; as &quot;pretty much the high point of experimental fiction in this country&quot;. While his early works draw on the modernist tradition of William Faulkner and Malcolm Lowry, his later novels are, in Markson&#x27;s words, &quot;literally crammed with literary and artistic anecdotes&quot; and &quot;nonlinear, discontinuous, collage-like, an assemblage.&quot;

In addition to his output of modernist and postmodernist experimental literature, he published a book of poetry, a critical study of Malcolm Lowry, three crime novels, and an anti-Western, &quot;The Ballad of Dingus Magee&quot;, adapted into the film &quot;Dirty Dingus Magee&quot;, starring Frank Sinatra.

== Biography ==

He was of Jewish origin. David Merrill Markson was born in Albany, New York, on December 20, 1927.

Educated at Union College and Columbia University, Markson began his writing career as a journalist and book editor, periodically taking up work as a college instructor at Columbia University, Long Island University, and The New School.

Though his first novel was published in the late 1950s, he did not gain prominence until the late 1980s, when he was over 60 years old, with the publication of &quot;Wittgenstein&#x27;s Mistress&quot;. From that point, his reputation as a writer steadily grew, so much so that he told an interviewer: &quot;One of my friends told me to be careful before I become well known for being unknown.&quot;

Markson died in New York City, in his West Village apartment where, according to the author&#x27;s literary agent and former wife Elaine Markson, Markson&#x27;s two children found him on June 4, 2010 in his bed.

Upon David Markson&#x27;s death, his entire personal library was donated to the Strand Bookstore, according to his wishes.

== &quot;Wittgenstein&#x27;s Mistress&quot; ==

&quot;Wittgenstein&#x27;s Mistress&quot;, widely considered his masterpiece, was published in 1988 by Dalkey Archive Press. Though Markson&#x27;s original manuscript was rejected 54 times, the book, when finally published, met with critical acclaim. It is a highly stylized, experimental novel in the tradition of Beckett. The novel is mainly a series of statements made in the first person; the protagonist is a woman who believes herself to be the last human on earth. Though her statements shift quickly from topic to topic, the topics are often recurrent, and often reference Western cultural icons, ranging from Zeno to Beethoven to Willem de Kooning. Readers familiar with Ludwig Wittgenstein&#x27;s &quot;Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus&quot; will recognize striking stylistic similarities to that work.

Amy Hempel praised it for &quot;address[ing] formidable philosophic questions with tremendous wit.&quot; A decade later, David Foster Wallace described it as &quot;pretty much the high point of experimental fiction in this country&quot; in an article for Salon entitled &quot;Five direly underappreciated U.S. novels &gt;1960.&quot;

== Markson&#x27;s Tetralogy (aka &quot;The Notecard Quartet&quot;) ==

Markson&#x27;s late works further refine the allusive, minimalist style of &quot;Wittgenstein&#x27;s Mistress&quot;. He hoped that these four novels might eventually be published together in one volume. Thus, critics often discuss them as a tetralogy and, though Markson himself gave no title to this collection of novels, many critics have adopted the name &quot;The Notecard Quartet&quot; to describe this work as a whole.

Markson described the action of this tetralogy as a character &quot;sitting alone in a bedroom with a head full of everything he’s ever read.&quot; Most of the traditional comforts of the novel form are absent, as an author-figure closely identified with Markson himself considers the travails of the artist throughout the history of culture. In &quot;Reader&#x27;s Block&quot;, he is called Reader; in &quot;This Is Not A Novel&quot;, Writer; in &quot;Vanishing Point&quot;, Author; in Markson&#x27;s last novel, &quot;The Last Novel&quot;, he is known as Novelist. His working process involved &quot;scribbling the notes on three-by-five-inch index cards&quot; and collecting them in &quot;shoebox tops&quot; until they were ready to be put &quot;into manuscript form.&quot; 

The first in the “personal genre,” &quot;Reader&#x27;s Block&quot;, was published by Dalkey Archive Press in 1996. It was followed by &quot;This Is Not A Novel&quot; (Counterpoint, 2001), &quot;Vanishing Point&quot; (Shoemaker &amp; Hoard, 2004) and &quot;The Last Novel&quot; (Shoemaker &amp; Hoard, 2007). Of &quot;Reader&#x27;s Block&quot;, fellow writer and friend Kurt Vonnegut wrote, &quot;David shouldn’t thank Fate for letting him write such a good book in a time when large numbers of people could no longer be wowed by a novel, no matter how excellent.&quot;

The second book, &quot;This Is Not a Novel&quot;, describes itself in a number of terms:

* &quot;A novel&quot; (p. 18)
* &quot;An epic poem&quot; (p. 21)
* &quot;A sequence of cantos awaiting numbering&quot;(p. 23)
* &quot;A mural of sorts&quot; (p. 36)
* &quot;An autobiography&quot; (p. 53)
* &quot;A continued heap of riddles&quot; (p. 70)
* &quot;A polyphonic opera of a kind&quot; (p. 73)
* &quot;A disquisition on the maladies of the life of art&quot; (p. 86)
* &quot;An ersatz prose alternative to &quot;The Waste Land&quot;&quot; (p. 101)
* &quot;A treatise on the nature of man&quot; (p. 111)
* &quot;An assemblage [nonlinear, discontinuous, collage-like]&quot; (p. 128)
* &quot;A contemporary variant on [&quot;The Egyptian Book of the Dead&quot;]&quot; (p. 147)
* &quot;A kind of verbal fugue&quot; (p. 170)
* &quot;A classic tragedy [in many ways]&quot; (p. 171)
* &quot;A volume entitled &#x27;Writer&#x27;s Block&#x27;&quot; (p. 173)
* &quot;A comedy of a sort&quot; (p. 184)
* &quot;His synthetic personal &quot;Finnegans Wake&quot;&quot; (p. 185)
* &quot;Nothing more than a fundamentally recognizable genre all the while&quot; (p. 189)
* &quot;Nothing more or less than a read&quot;
* &quot;An unconventional, generally melancholy though sometimes even playful now-ending read.&quot;

In &quot;This Is Not a Novel&quot;, the Writer character states, &quot;A novel with no intimation of story whatsoever, Writer would like to contrive&quot; (p. 2). &quot;Reader&#x27;s Block,&quot; likewise, calls itself &quot;a novel of intellectual reference and allusion, so to speak minus much of the novel&quot; (p. 61). Rather than consisting of a specific plot, they can be said to be composed of &quot;an intellectual ragpicker&#x27;s collection of cultural detritus.&quot; This seemingly-random set of quotes, ideas, and nuggets of information about the lives of various literary, artistic, and historical figures cohere to form a new kind of novel. Despite their unconventional form and appearance, Markson insisted on calling them &quot;novels.&quot;

Though the last three novels of &quot;The Notecard Quartet&quot; have been published together in one book, &quot;This Is Not a Novel and Other Novels&quot;, because the first book of the tetralogy was published by a different publisher, the entire quartet of novels has yet to be published together in one collection.

<text>In computer networking, port forwarding or port mapping is an application of network address translation (NAT) that redirects a communication request from one address and port number combination to another while the packets are traversing a network gateway, such as a router or firewall. This technique is most commonly used to make services on a host residing on a protected or masqueraded (internal) network available to hosts on the opposite side of the gateway (external network), by remapping the destination IP address and port number of the communication to an internal host.

==Purpose==
Port forwarding facilitates the connection by remote computers, for example, Internet hosts, to a specific computer or service within a local area network (LAN).

In a typical residential network, nodes obtain Internet access through a DSL or cable modem connected to a router or network address translator (NAT/NAPT). Hosts on the private network are connected to an Ethernet switch or communicate via a wireless LAN. The NAT device&#x27;s external interface is configured with a public IP address. The computers behind the router, on the other hand, are invisible to hosts on the Internet as they each communicate only with a private IP address.

When configuring port forwarding, the network administrator sets aside one port number on the gateway for the exclusive use of communicating with a service in the private network, located on a specific host. External hosts must know this port number and the address of the gateway to communicate with the network-internal service. Often, the port numbers of well-known Internet services, such as port number 80 for web services (HTTP), are used in port forwarding, so that common Internet services may be implemented on hosts within private networks.

Typical applications include the following:
* Running a public HTTP server within a private LAN
* Permitting Secure Shell access to a host on the private LAN from the Internet
* Permitting FTP access to a host on a private LAN from the Internet
* Running a publicly available game server within a private LAN

Administrators configure port forwarding in the gateway&#x27;s operating system. In Linux kernels, this is achieved by packet filter rules in the iptables or netfilter kernel components. BSD and macOS operating systems prior to Yosemite (OS 10.10.X) implement it in the Ipfirewall (ipfw) module while macOS operating systems beginning with Yosemite implement it in the Packet Filter (pf) module.

When used on gateway devices, a port forward may be implemented with a single rule to translate the destination address and port. (On Linux kernels, this is DNAT rule). The source address and port are, in this case, left unchanged. When used on machines that are not the default gateway of the network, the source address must be changed to be the address of the translating machine, or packets will bypass the translator and the connection will fail.

When a port forward is implemented by a proxy process (such as on application layer firewalls, SOCKS based firewalls, or via TCP circuit proxies), then no packets are actually translated, only data is proxied. This usually results in the source address (and port number) being changed to that of the proxy machine.

Usually only one of the private hosts can use a specific forwarded port at one time, but configuration is sometimes possible to differentiate access by the originating host&#x27;s source address.

Unix-like operating systems sometimes use port forwarding where port numbers smaller than 1024 can only be created by software running as the root user. Running with superuser privileges (in order to bind the port) may be a security risk to the host, therefore port forwarding is used to redirect a low-numbered port to another high-numbered port, so that application software may execute as a common operating system user with reduced privileges.

The Universal Plug and Play protocol (UPnP) provides a feature to automatically install instances of port forwarding in residential Internet gateways. UPnP defines the Internet Gateway Device Protocol (IGD) which is a network service by which an Internet gateway advertises its presence on a private network via the Simple Service Discovery Protocol (SSDP). An application that provides an Internet-based service may discover such gateways and use the UPnP IGD protocol to reserve a port number on the gateway and cause the gateway to forward packets to its listening socket.

==Types==
Port forwarding may be distinguished by the following specific types: local, remote, and dynamic port forwarding.

===Local port forwarding===
Local port forwarding is the most common type of port forwarding. It is used to let a user connect from the local computer to another server, i.e. forward data securely from another client application running on the same computer as a Secure Shell (SSH) client. By using local port forwarding, firewalls that block certain web pages, can be bypassed.

Connections from an SSH client are forwarded, via an SSH server, to the intended destination server. The SSH server is configured to redirect data from a specified port (which is local to the host that runs the SSH client) through a secure tunnel to some specified destination host and port. The local port is on the same computer as the SSH client, and this port is the &quot;forwarded port&quot;. On the same computer, any client that wants to connect to the same destination host and port can be configured to connect to the forwarded port (rather than directly to the destination host and port). After this connection is established, the SSH client listens on the forwarded port and directs all data sent by applications to that port, through a secure tunnel to the SSH server. The server decrypts the data, and then redirects it to the destination host and port.

Some uses of local port forwarding :
* Using local port forwarding to receive mail 
* Connect from a laptop to a website using an SSH tunnel.

=== Remote port forwarding ===
This form of port forwarding enables applications on the server side of a Secure Shell (SSH) connection to access services residing on the SSH&#x27;s client side. In addition to SSH, there are proprietary tunneling schemes that utilize remote port forwarding for the same general purpose. In other words, remote port forwarding lets users connect from the server side of a tunnel, SSH or another, to a remote network service located at the tunnel&#x27;s client side.

To use remote port forwarding, the address of the destination server (on the tunnel&#x27;s client side) and two port numbers must be known. The port numbers chosen depend on which application is to be used.

Remote port forwarding allows other computers to access applications hosted on remote servers. Two examples:
* An employee of a company hosts an FTP server at their own home and wants to give access to the FTP service to employees using computers in the workplace. In order to do this, an employee can set up remote port forwarding through SSH on the company&#x27;s internal computers by including their FTP server’s address and using the correct port numbers for FTP (standard FTP port is TCP/21) 
* Opening remote desktop sessions is a common use of remote port forwarding. Through SSH, this can be accomplished by opening the virtual network computing port (5900) and including the destination computer’s address.

=== Reverse port forwarding ===
Another name: reverse SSH tunnel. Simply speaking, when your laptop connects to a remote machine in such way, that incoming calls to the IP of that remote machine get transferred to your laptop - and response back.

===Dynamic port forwarding===
Dynamic port forwarding (DPF) is an on-demand method of traversing a firewall or NAT through the use of firewall pinholes. The goal is to enable clients to connect securely to a trusted server that acts as an intermediary for the purpose of sending/receiving data to one or many destination servers.

DPF can be implemented by setting up a local application, such as SSH, as a SOCKS proxy server, which can be used to process data transmissions through the network or over the Internet. Programs, such as web browsers, must be configured individually to direct traffic through the proxy, which acts as a secure tunnel to another server. Once the proxy is no longer needed, the programs must be reconfigured to their original settings. Because of the manual requirements of DPF, it is not often used.

Once the connection is established, DPF can be used to provide additional security for a user connected to an untrusted network. Since data must pass through the secure tunnel to another server before being forwarded to its original destination, the user is protected from packet sniffing that may occur on the LAN.

DPF is a powerful tool with many uses; for example, a user connected to the Internet through a coffee shop, hotel, or otherwise minimally secure network may wish to use DPF as a way of protecting data. DPF can also be used to bypass firewalls that restrict access to outside websites, such as in corporate networks.

<text>The Peconic Bay is the parent name for two bays (Great Peconic Bay and Little Peconic Bay) between the North Fork and South Fork of Long Island in Suffolk County, New York, United States. It is separated from Gardiners Bay by Shelter Island.

== Description ==
Peconic Bay is divided by Robins Island into the Great Peconic Bay on the west and Little Peconic Bay on the east. The west end of Great Peconic Bay is also called Flanders Bay. Great Peconic is a shallow bay, less than deep, while Little Peconic reaches depths of over . The Shinnecock Canal provides access from the Great Peconic Bay to Shinnecock Bay. The two Peconic Bays are often collectively referred to as &quot;the Peconics&quot;.

The Peconics are a tidal estuary system fed at the western end by the Peconic River. Other notable tidal estuary creeks which provide brackish water to the system are Meeting House Creek, Brushes Creek, James Creek, and Deep Hole Creek on the North Fork. These and others bring lesser salinity to the water compared to the Atlantic Ocean. For that reason, the clams, oysters and bay scallops were numerous for generations since they require brackish water and the bountiful phyto and zooplankton which give the system its first tier of life. Reseeding of shellfish in 2005 and 2006 and leasing of the bottom to commercial farmers for clams and oysters have given rise to hope for the ecosystem.

The winter flounder fishing usually caught in the spring has all but collapsed, but fluke (summer flounder), bluefish, porgy (scup) and some northern weakfish are to be found, using clams, squid and spearing for bait. Snappers (young spawned bluefish of the year) give youngsters a real thrill in late summer. August is a time of blue claw crabbing and recent catches 2006 and 2007 in the inlets and creeks have been bountiful.

A boaters&#x27; paradise for its calm waters in summer and fresh sou&#x27;westers in late afternoon for sailing has become a popular vacation spot for New Yorkers and East coasters.

== Regional influence ==
Peconic Bay gives its name to the proposed Peconic County, which would comprise the eastern portion of existing Suffolk County surrounding Peconic Bay and would include the five easternmost towns: East Hampton, Riverhead, Shelter Island, Southampton, and Southold. While this movement to split Suffolk County along economic lines (the western half is more suburban in character, while the eastern half is more rural) has a long history, it has not gained significant traction in Albany since 1997, when the New York State Legislature refused to allow it to separate from Suffolk County.

<text>Samuel C. Hyde (April 22, 1842 – March 7, 1922) was an American attorney and politician from Washington. A Republican, he was most notable for his service as prosecuting attorney of Spokane County from 1880 to 1886 and a member of the United States House of Representatives from 1895 to 1897.

==Early life==
Samuel Clarence Hyde was born in Ticonderoga, New York on April 22, 1842, a son of Eli N. and Susan S. Hyde. He was a twin, and his sister Salina Clarissa died when she was eight months old. When Hyde was three, his parents relocated to a farm near Oshkosh in Winnebago County, Wisconsin, where Hyde was raised and educated.

==Start of career==
In December 1861, Hyde enlisted in the Union Army for the American Civil War. He joined Company K, 17th Wisconsin Volunteer Infantry as a private, with his enlistment credited to the town of Utica in Winnebago County. Hyde attained the rank of sergeant and served until July 1862, when he was discharged for disability.

After leaving the army, Hyde worked as an explorer and surveyor of timber and mining lands in Michigan&#x27;s upper peninsula. In 1871, he began to farm in Lyon County, Iowa. In the early 1870s, he attended Iowa State University, where he studied law. He was admitted to the bar in 1872, and began to practice in Rock Rapids, Iowa. In addition to practicing law, Hyde was publisher of the &quot;Lyon County Press&quot; newspaper. Hyde also became active in politics as a Republican, and served as chairman of the party&#x27;s central committee in Lyon County, Iowa.

==Continued career==
In 1877, Hyde moved to Washington Territory, and he resided and practiced law in both Seattle and Tacoma. In 1879, he relocated to Spokane, where he continued practicing law. As an early resident of Spokane, Hyde was one of its developers, including construction and management of several commercial buildings. In 1881, he was appointed Prosecuting Attorney of Spokane County and Stevens County, and he served in this position for six years.

In 1894, Hyde was the successful Republican nominee for the U.S. House of Representatives from Washington&#x27;s at-large congressional district. He served in the 54th Congress, March 4, 1895 to March 3, 1897. During his Congressional term, Hyde successfully advocated for construction of the Fort George Wright army base near Spokane. Hyde was an unsuccessful candidate for reelection in 1896 and resumed practicing law in Spokane. He was a longtime justice of the peace and heard cases in Spokane&#x27;s justice court until retiring for ill health shortly before his death.

==Death and burial==
Hyde died in Spokane on March 7, 1922. He was buried at Fairmount Cemetery in Spokane. Hyde&#x27;s funeral took place at Spokane&#x27;s Central Methodist Church, and he received funeral honors from members of the local Grand Army of the Republic post.

==Family==
In 1869, Hyde married Mattie A. Rogers (1850-1891) of Rosendale, Wisconsin. They were married until her death, and were the parents of two children, daughter Katherine and son Earl. Hyde&#x27;s siblings included E. B. Hyde, a Spokane banker and real estate developer who also served in the Washington State Senate.

<text>The Province of West Prussia (; ; ) was a province of Prussia from 1773 to 1829 and from 1878 to 1919. West Prussia was established as a province of the Kingdom of Prussia in 1773, formed from Royal Prussia of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth annexed in the First Partition of Poland. West Prussia was dissolved in 1829 and merged with East Prussia to form the Province of Prussia, but was re-established in 1878 when the merger was reversed and became part of the German Empire. From 1918, West Prussia was a province of the Free State of Prussia within Weimar Germany, losing most of its territory to the Second Polish Republic and the Free City of Danzig in the Treaty of Versailles. West Prussia was dissolved in 1919, and its remaining western territory was merged with Posen to form Posen-West Prussia, and its eastern territory merged with East Prussia as the Region of West Prussia district.

West Prussia&#x27;s provincial capital alternated between Marienwerder (present-day Kwidzyn, Poland) and Danzig (Gdańsk, Poland) during its existence. West Prussia was notable for its ethnic and religious diversity due to immigration and cultural changes, with the population becoming mixed over the centuries. Since the early Middle Ages the bulk of the region was inhabited by West Slavic Lechitic tribes (Pomeranians in the Pomerelia region and Masovians in Kulmerland), while the actual Old Prussians (Pomesanians and Pogesanians) populated only the remaining part of the territory lying to the east of the Vistula River. The Teutonic Order&#x27;s conquest of the region resulted in German colonization in the 14th century. As a result of Germanisation, Germans became in the middle of the 19th century the most numerous ethnic group in West Prussia as a whole, remaining as such until the dissolution of the province in 1920, though their distribution was uneven: their majority was concentrated in Danzig, the western lands of the province, along the Vistula river, and in the Pomesanian and Pogesanian portion of the province located east of the Vistula, with a small admixture of Poles (Gedanians and Powiślans). Meanwhile, Poles (Kociewians, Borowians and Chełminians) as well as Kashubians continued to predominate in parts of Pomerelian territories west of Vistula and in parts of the Chełmno Land, forming altogether around 36% of the population of the province as a whole. There were also sizeable minorities of Mennonites and Jews settling in the region.

==Geography==

The landscape of West Prussia consisted of the lower reaches of the Vistula River (, ) near its mouth on the Baltic Sea, and neighboring lands to the west and east.

In the west, the province shared a border with easternmost Brandenburg, and comprised those lands between the provinces of Posen and Pomerania. This region of the province was characterized by the Baltic Uplands, with southward flowing rivers joining the Noteć (). The Brda () drains much of this area, joining the Vistula after passing through Bydgoszcz (). Numerous large expanses of woodland, including the Tuchola Forest, were located in this part of the province. Further north near the sea is the Kashubian Lake District, where the highest point of the former province, Wieżyca (), reaches 329 meters above sea level. The headwaters of Pomeranian rivers such as the Słupia () and Łeba () are located in these uplands.

In the north was the Baltic coast, consisting of a graded shoreline with landmarks such as the Hel Peninsula stretching 35 kilometers into the Gdańsk Bay, and the Vistula Fens where that river meets the sea. The Vistula delta encompasses a heavily cultivated area of approximately 2,000 square kilometers of land, much of it below sea level. Gdańsk (), the largest city of the province, was found at the northwestern end of the delta. The Nogat river, a distributary of the Vistula, flows to the northeast past the city of Malbork () and into the Vistula Lagoon. Further east near Elbląg (), the border with East Prussia crossed the Vistula Spit, Vistula Lagoon, and the Elbląg Upland.

In the southeast, the course of the Vistula river forms a wide, flat plain, with adjacent escarpments sometimes exceeding 60 meters in height above the river valley. This area includes the fertile Chełmno Land (), with historic cities such as Chełmno (), Toruń (), and Grudziądz (). The Chełmno Land stretched eastward to the border with East Prussia, partially bound on the south by the path of the river Drwęca (), which formed part of the province&#x27;s southeastern border with Congress Poland and the Russian Empire.

==History==
===Context===
The region of Pomerelia or Gdańsk Pomerania, historically Polish and never inhabited by Old Prussians, was forcibly occupied by the monastic state of the Teutonic Knights in 1308, following an invasion of Poland under the pretext of helping the King Władysław I Łokietek to quell a rebellion, with subsequent Teutonic atrocities against the Polish population, such as the Slaughter of Gdańsk. The possession of Danzig and Pomerelia by the Teutonic Order was questioned consistently by the Polish kings Władysław I and Casimir the Great in legal suits in the papal court in 1320 and 1333. Both times, as well as in 1339, the Teutonic Knights were ordered by the Pope to return Pomerelia and other lands back to Poland, but did not comply. These events resulted in a series of Polish–Teutonic Wars throughout the 14th and 15th centuries. Under the Teutonic rule, an influx of western, mainly German-speaking farmers, traders and craftsmen was encouraged. Subsequent rebellions organized by the local population against the Teutonic state, initially by the Lizard Union and later by the Prussian Confederation, both pledging allegiance to the Polish king, caused the Thirteen Years&#x27; War which ultimately led to the Second Peace of Thorn, when most of the region and was reclaimed by Poland and henceforth formed Royal Prussia, consisting of the originally Polish Pomerelia and Chełmno Land, expanded by the addition of parts of the formerly Old Prussian territories of Pomesania, Pogesania and Warmia. The region had initially a degree of autonomy with an own local legislature, the Prussian Estates, and maintaining its own laws, customs and rights, but was ultimately re-absorbed directly into the Crown of the Kingdom of Poland, following the Union of Lublin in 1569. The locally spoken language differed among social classes, with the aristocracy and urban burghers initially highly Germanised as a result of earlier Teutonic policies, but gradually Polonized in the later years, while the peasantry continued as predominantly Kashubian- and Polish-speaking. A small area in the west of Pomerelia, the Lauenburg and Bütow Land, was granted to the rulers of Pomerania as a Polish fief before it was reintegrated with Poland in 1637, and later again transformed into a Polish fief, which it remained until the First Partition of Poland.

East Prussia around Königsberg, on the other hand, remained with the State of the Teutonic Knights, who were reduced to vassals of the Polish kings. Their territory was secularised to become the Lutheran Duchy of Prussia according to the 1525 Treaty of Kraków and the Prussian Homage. The duchy was later ruled in personal union with the Imperial Margraviate of Brandenburg from 1618. The Hohenzollern rulers of Brandenburg-Prussia were able to remove the Polish suzerainty by the 1657 Treaty of Wehlau, taking advantage of the Russo-Swedish Deluge, shortly thereafter transforming their possessions into a kingdom. This development turned out to be fatal to the Polish monarchy, as the two parts of the rising Kingdom of Prussia were separated by Polish land. Subsequently, the newly established kingdom entered into an alliance with Austria and Russia, invading Polish territories.

Even though some German authors viewed the establishment of West Prussia as a historic reunification of the lands of the Teutonic State, officially, the Prussian government shunned from justifying the annexation by such argument. The reason was that the Teutonic Order still called for reestablishment of their rule over East- and West Prussia.

===Establishment===
In the 1772 First Partition of Poland the Prussian king Frederick the Great took the occasion to annex most of Royal Prussia. The addition gave Prussia a land connection between the Province of Pomerania and East Prussia, cutting off the Polish access to the Baltic Sea and rendering East Prussia more readily defensible in the event of war with the Russian Empire. The annexed voivodeships of Pomerania (i.e. Pomerelia) excluding the City of Danzig, Malbork () and Chełmno () excluding the City of Thorn () were incorporated into the province of West Prussia the following year, along with the formerly East Prussian Marienwerder Kreis. Ermland () became part of East Prussia while the annexed parts of Greater Poland and Kuyavia formed a separate Netze District located to the south. The Partition Sejm ratified the cession on 30 September 1773, complemented by renouncement by the Polish king of his royal title in regard to Prussia. Thereafter, Frederick finally started to style himself &quot;King &quot;of&quot; Prussia&quot; rather than &quot;King &quot;in&quot; Prussia.&quot; Both abovementioned exempted cities were ultimately captured by the Kingdom of Prussia upon the Second Partition of Poland in 1793.

The Polish administrative and legal code was replaced by the Prussian system, and 750 schools were built from 1772 to 1775. Both Protestant and Roman Catholic teachers taught in West Prussia, and teachers and administrators were encouraged to be able to speak both German and Polish. Frederick II of Prussia also advised his successors to learn Polish, a policy followed by the Hohenzollern dynasty until Frederick III decided not to let William II learn Polish. Despite this, Frederick II (Frederick the Great) looked askance upon many of his new citizens. In a letter from 1735, he calls them &quot;dirty&quot; and &quot;vile apes&quot;. He had nothing but contempt for the , the numerous Polish nobility, and wrote that Poland had &quot;the worst government in Europe with the exception of Ottoman Empire&quot;. He considered West Prussia less civilized than Colonial Canada and compared the Poles to the Iroquois. In a letter to his brother Henry, Frederick wrote about the province that &quot;it is a very good and advantageous acquisition, both from a financial and a political point of view. In order to excite less jealousy I tell everyone that on my travels I have seen just sand, pine trees, heath land and Jews. Despite that there is a lot of work to be done; there is no order, and no planning and the towns are in a lamentable condition.&quot; Frederick invited German immigrants to redevelop the province. Many German officials also regarded the Poles with contempt. According to the Polish historian Jerzy Surdykowski, Frederick the Great introduced 300,000 German colonists. According to Christopher Clark, 54 percent of the annexed area and 75 percent of the urban population were German-speaking Protestants. Further Polish areas were annexed in the Second Partition of Poland in 1793, now including the cities of Danzig () and Thorn ().

===Napoleonic Wars===
After the defeat of Prussia by the Napoleonic French Empire at the 1806 Battle of Jena-Auerstedt followed by the Treaties of Tilsit, West Prussia lost its southern territory in the vicinity of Thorn and Kulm (Chełmno) to the short-lived Duchy of Warsaw; it also lost Danzig, which was a Free City from 1807 until 1814. After the final defeat of Napoleon in 1815, Danzig, Kulm, and Thorn were returned to West Prussia by resolution of the Vienna Congress. Some of the areas of Greater Poland annexed in 1772 that had formed the Netze District were added to West Prussia as well (the remainder became part of the Grand Duchy of Posen).

=== Restoration ===
The Congress of Vienna established the German Confederation (), an association of 39 German-speaking states in Central Europe under the nominal leadership of Austrian Empire, as a replacement for the dissolved Holy Roman Empire. Its boundaries largely followed those of its predecessor, the Holy Roman Empire, defining the territory of Germany for much of the 19th century.

Except for the Lauenburg and Bütow Land and the former Starostwo of Draheim, the Prussian lands which had been outside the Empire remained outside the Confederation, namely the former Ducal Prussia and those territories gained during the partitions of Poland. This included both predominantly Polish- or Kashubian-speaking areas (former Greater Poland and Pomerelia within West Prussia and the Grand Duchy of Posen) and German-speaking areas (Malbork Land within West Prussia and most of East Prussia). A failed attempt to include these lands in the German Empire (1848–49) was undertaken by the Frankfurt Parliament.

In 1815, the province was administratively subdivided into the Danzig and Marienwerder. From 1829 to 1878, West Prussia was combined with East Prussia to form the Province of Prussia, after which they were re-established as separate provinces. In 1840, King Frederick William IV of Prussia sought to reconcile the state with the Catholic Church and the kingdom&#x27;s Polish subjects by granting amnesty to imprisoned Polish bishops and by re-establishing Polish instruction in schools in districts having Polish majorities.

===Incorporation into Germany===

With rise of nationalism, the Hohenzollern-ruled territory increasingly became a target of aggressive Germanisation efforts, German settlement, anti-Catholic campaigns (Kulturkampf), as well as disfranchisement and expropriations of Poles, and was finally annexed into Germany following the North German Confederation Treaty (1866). The Polish historian Andrzej Chwalba cites Germanization measures that included:
*Ethnic Germans were favoured in government contracts, and only they won them over Poles.
*Ethnic Germans were also promoted in investment plans and supply contracts.
*German craftsmen in Polish territories received the best locations in cities from authorities so that they could start their own business and prosper.
*Soldiers received orders that banned them from buying in Polish shops and from Poles under the threat of arrest.
*German merchantmen were encouraged to settle in Polish territories.
*Tax incentives and beneficial financial arrangements were proposed to German officials and clerks if they would settle in Polish-inhabited provinces.

At the time of German Unification in 1871, the Kingdom of Prussia was the largest and dominant part of the North German Confederation, the predecessor of the newly-formed German Empire.

In the German census of 1910, the population of West Prussia was put at 1,703,474, of whom around 64 percent listed their first language as German, 28 percent Polish and 7 percent Kashubian. According to Polish authors the real share of Poles and Kashubians was 43% (rather than 35.5% as in official figures), but many of them were counted as Catholic Germans by Prussian census clerks.

===Dissolution===
In 1910, ethnic Poles were between 36% and 43% of West Prussia&#x27;s populace. After the Treaty of Versailles in 1919, most of pre-war West Prussia&#x27;s territory (62%) and population (57%, the majority of whom were Polish) was granted to the Second Polish Republic or the Free City of Danzig (8% of territory, 19% of population), while parts in the west (18% of territory, 9% of population) and east (12% of territory, 15% of population) of the former province remained in Weimar Germany. The western remainder formed Grenzmark Posen-West Prussia in 1922, while the eastern remainder became part of Regierungsbezirk West Prussia within East Prussia.

The 1920 East Prussian plebiscite was also held in the eastern part of West Prussia, which was known as the &quot;Marienwerder Plebiscite Area,&quot; and included partially or fully, the districts of Marienwerder, Stuhm, Rosenberg and Marienburg. The residents of this region voted by a majority of 92.4% to remain with Germany.

=== World War II ===
In 1939, the region was invaded, then included in the Reichsgau Danzig-West Prussia within Nazi Germany during World War II and settled with 130,000 German colonists, while between 120,000 and 170,000 Poles and Jews were removed by the Germans through expulsion, massacres, enslavement or killed in extermination camps. As in all other areas, Poles and Jews were classified as &quot;Untermenschen&quot; by the German state, with their fate being slavery and extermination, the latter in particular during Intelligenzaktion Pommern, as well as in the Stutthof concentration camp. Later in the war, many West Prussian Germans fled westward as the Red Army advanced on the Eastern Front. All of the areas occupied by Nazis were restored to Poland according to the post-war Potsdam Agreement in 1945, along with further neighbouring areas of former Nazi Germany and areas that had been part of Germany before. The vast majority of the remaining German population of the region that had not fled was subsequently expelled westward. Many German civilians were deported to labor camps like Vorkuta in the Soviet Union, where a large number of them perished or were later reported missing. In 1949, the refugees established the non-profit Landsmannschaft Westpreußen to represent West Prussians in the Federal Republic of Germany.

== Historical population ==

Perhaps the earliest estimations on ethnic or national structure of West Prussia are from 1819. At that time West Prussia had 630,077 inhabitants, including 327,300 Poles (52%), 290,000 Germans (46%) and 12,700 Jews (2%).

Karl Andree, &quot;&quot; (Leipzig 1831), gives the total population of West Prussia as 700,000 – including 50% Poles (350,000), 47% Germans (330,000) and 3% Jews (20,000).

The population more than doubled during the next seven decades, reaching 1,433,681 inhabitants (including 1,976 foreigners) in 1890.

*1875 – 1,343,057
*1880 – 1,405,898
*1890 – 1,433,681 (717,532 Catholics, 681,195 Protestants, 21,750 Jews, others)
*1900 – 1,563,658 (800,395 Catholics, 730,685 Protestants, 18,226 Jews, others)
*1905 – 1,641,936 
*1910 – 1,703,474 (according to German statistics there were 35.5% Poles, while acording to Polish statisticians the percentage of Poles was 42.5%)

According to the German census of 1910, in areas that became Polish after 1918, 42% of the populace were Germans (including German military, officials and colonists), while the Polish census of 1921 found 19% of Germans in the same territory.

Contemporary sources in late 19th and early 20th centuries gave the number of Kashubians between 80,000 and 200,000.

== Subdivisions ==
Note: Prussian provinces were subdivided into districts called (singular , abbreviated ). Cities would have their own (urban district) and the surrounding rural area would be named for the city, but referred to as a (rural district).

<doc id="757202" wikidata="Q1568360" url="?curid=757202" title="Bell-bottoms">
<text>Bell-bottoms (or flares) are a style of trousers that become wider from the knees downward, forming a bell-like shape of the trouser leg.

==History==
===Naval origins===
In the early 19th century, when standardised uniforms for British ratings in the Royal Navy or enlisted men in the U.S. Navy did not as yet exist, some sailors adopted a style of wide trousers ending in bell-shaped cuffs. In 1813, one of the first recorded descriptions of sailors&#x27; uniforms, written by Commodore Stephen Decatur, noted that the men on the frigates &quot;United States&quot; and &quot;Macedonia&quot; were wearing &quot;glazed canvas hats with stiff brims, decked with streamers of ribbon, blue jackets buttoned loosely over waistcoats, and blue trousers with bell bottoms.&quot;

The Royal Navy had often been a leader in nautical fashion, but bell-bottoms did not become part of the standard uniform until the mid-19th century. These bell-bottoms were often just very wide-legged trousers, rather than shaped trousers that flared below the knee. They continued in use as a distinctive feature of the RN rating&#x27;s &quot;square rig&quot; uniform until replaced by more conventionally flared trousers in 1977.

Although the trousers of the present-day uniform of the United States Navy are still referred to as bell-bottomed, they simply have large straight legs. The wearer&#x27;s thigh fills the upper trouser leg, making the bottom of the pants leg appear flared. This style has been popular for many years, perhaps originally because the trouser leg can be rolled up easily, allowing the wearer to work in bare feet, but there is no reliable documentation that confirms a specific timeline or reason for the popularity of bell-bottomed trousers in naval apparel.

Some modern naval uniforms continue to use bell-bottomed trousers as a potential life-saving device. The trouser material is made of cotton fibers that swell when wet and can hold air. In the event of a sailor falling overboard or having to abandon ship without a life vest, the bell-bottomed trousers can be quickly removed in the water without having to remove footwear. As part of their survival training, sailors are taught to remove the trousers while floating, tie the leg bottoms in a knot, and then use one of several methods to inflate the trousers with air. The inflated trousers can provide extra flotation while awaiting rescue.

===Other traditional usages ===
Bell-bottoms have also been worn for centuries by European carpenters, which is explained by the fact that the widening legs prevent sawdust from falling onto their shoes or feet. Bell-bottoms are still worn by carpenters who decide to spend their time after the apprenticeship as journeymen on the road.

===1960s, 1970s, 1980s and 1990s===
In the 1960s, bell-bottoms became fashionable for both men and women in London and expanded into Europe and North America. Often made of denim, they flared out from the bottom of the calf, and had slightly curved hems and a circumference of at the bottom of each leg opening. They were usually worn with Cuban-heeled shoes, clogs, or Chelsea boots. Toni Basil, who was a go-go dancer when the 1964 concert film the &quot;T.A.M.I. Show&quot; was released, appeared in the film wearing bell-bottoms with a baby doll blouse.

Bell-bottoms are mentioned in the popular 1971 music single &quot;Bell Bottom Blues&quot; by blues-rock group Derek and the Dominos.

In the 1970s, bell-bottoms moved back into mainstream fashion via Brian Spiller; Sonny and Cher helped popularize bell-bottoms in the US by wearing them on their popular television show. The pants were typically flared from the knee down, with bottom leg openings of up to twenty-six inches. Made from denim, bright cotton and satin polyester, they were so popular that they became a symbol of the outlandish and colorful style of the decade.

&quot;Loon pants&quot; (shortened from &quot;balloon pants&quot;) are a variant on bell-bottomed trousers, with an increased flare. They were worn occasionally by go-go dancers on the British television music variety show &quot;Ready Steady Go!&quot; in 1966.

&quot;Elephant bells&quot;, popular in the mid-to-late 1970s, are similar to loon pants, but were typically made of denim. Elephant bells had a marked flare below the knee, often covering the wearer&#x27;s shoes. The preferred shoes were platform shoes with soles at least thick and heels to keep the pants&#x27; hems off the ground.

After the rise of punk rock in the late 1970s, bell-bottoms began to become less fashionable as the decade drew to a close. By 1979, skin-tight trousers or 1950s-style drain pipes were much more in vogue, with bell-bottoms seen as having had their day, remaining in fashion circa 1967–1979.

A revival of bell-bottoms occurred after bands such as The Stone Roses, Happy Mondays and The Charlatans re-introduced them in late 1989 and the early 1990s.

===Mid-1990s to 2000s===
In 1996, women&#x27;s bell-bottoms were reintroduced to the mainstream public, under the name &quot;boot-cut&quot; (or &quot;bootleg&quot;) trousers as the flare was slimmer. By 1999, flare jeans had come into vogue among women, which had a wider, more exaggerated flare than boot-cuts. The boot-cut style ended up dominating the fashion world for 10 years.

By around 2006, the bell-shaped silhouette started to fade as the skinny jean rose in popularity. Sharon Haver, the founder and editor-in-chief of online fashion magazine &quot;FocusOnStyle.com&quot;, commented &quot;It&#x27;s as if all the girls wearing premium boot-cut jeans threw them away one day, and the next day began wearing skinny jeans and flats.&quot;

Women&#x27;s boot-cut jeans are tighter at the knee than men&#x27;s, and flare out from knee to hem. Men&#x27;s styles are traditionally straight-legged, although the pants came in a more flared style in the early and mid 2000s, but this was optional. The bell-bottoms of the 1960s and 1970s can be distinguished from the flare or boot-cut of the 1990s and 2000s by the tightness of the fabric at the knee.

===2020s===

With the onset of a spectrum of revivalist fashion trends as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, there has also been revived interest in clothing trends of the 1960s and 1970s, which includes bell-bottoms and flared trousers. Bell-bottoms were still trending on the runway in September 2022, as well as the return to the wide leg bell-bottom in 2023.

<doc id="757205" wikidata="Q1984009" url="?curid=757205" title="Death (Discworld)">
<text>Death is a fictional character in Terry Pratchett&#x27;s &quot;Discworld&quot; series and a parody of several other depictions of the Grim Reaper across Europe. He is a black-robed skeleton who usually carries a scythe and on occasion a sword for dispatching royalty. His jurisdiction is specifically the Discworld itself; he being only a minion of Azrael, the Death of all things across the Universes – in much the same way as the Death of Rats is an infinitesimally small part of Death himself. 

Pratchett explores human existence through his depiction of death, which becomes more sympathetic throughout the series as it progresses.

Death almost never &quot;kills&quot; anyone or anything but — acting in the form of a psychopomp — he merely ensures that when lives comes to an end, they move on to where they believe they should go if they are sentient, which often involves a desert to be crossed.

==Works==
Death appears in every single Discworld novel — to greater or lesser degree — except for &quot;The Wee Free Men&quot; and &quot;Snuff&quot;. In some of the novels, he is just a momentary humorous aside, whereas in others he has a more significant bearing on a plot point. 

The character of Death evolves over the progression of the novels, developing more across the earlier books with his character gradually stabilising in later ones. 

Death is the leading or an important central character in the following — in which he goes through significant character development — and these are considered to be the &quot;Death strand&quot; novels:

*&quot;Mort&quot; — 1987
*&quot;Reaper Man&quot; — 1991
*&quot;Soul Music&quot; — 1994
*&quot;Hogfather&quot; — 1996
*&quot;Thief of Time&quot; — 2001

==Character==
The books represent Death&#x27;s hollow, peculiar voice with unquoted — since as a skeleton, he has no vocal cords — and his words seem to enter the head without involving the ears. Pratchett wrote that his voice was like two slabs of granite rubbing together, or the slamming of coffin lids. These descriptions became frequent in later novels.

Death is not invisible, but most people&#x27;s brains refuse to process who he is unless he insists. Generally, only magical people like witches and wizards, children, and cats can allow themselves to see him. Death can ignore things like walls because he is eternal and things that last mere centuries are not as real as he is. He can also adjust time for himself and others nearby.

Wizards, witches, and other significant figures like kings are collected by Death himself rather than by some lesser functionary such as a scrofula. Death himself must collect some minimum number of souls, to keep the balance. His selection from ordinary deaths is worked out by a system called the &quot;nodes&quot; possibly based on the showiness of the death. A common thief incinerated by a dragon might qualify for example. He has shown up for at least two kittens, a swan, and a red flower-like sea creature. These events are usually of incidental importance within the story, so Death&#x27;s appearance may be considered an in-joke rather than a plot device. He sometimes appears for characters in mortal peril. Rincewind has seen him on numerous near-fatal occasions. Similarly, in &quot;Thud!&quot;, Vimes has a near-death experience, for which Death appears, sitting in a deckchair reading a mystery novel as he waits to see if Vimes will die. 

He is fond of cats, who can see him at all times (he seems particularly furious when he once attends to a sack of drowned kittens), and curry, the consumption of which he describes as like biting a red-hot ice cube. Being a skeleton with no digestive organs, it is not revealed how he is able to partake of food and drink. Anyone who dines with him tends to become extremely focused upon their own meal, and merely notices Death&#x27;s plate being full one moment and empty the next. He occasionally smokes a pipe, with the smoke drifting out of his eye sockets. He pays for goods and services with an assortment of copper coins, many turned blue or green with age, which he says he acquired .

Death is fascinated by humanity. His interest is coupled with bafflement: it&#x27;s a favorite point of Pratchett&#x27;s that the habits and beliefs that are grown into instead of being rationally acquired are an essential part of being human. As Death is an outside observer, his imitations of humanity are intricate but marked by a fundamental lack of comprehension. When acting as a stand-in for the Hogfather (a figure similar to Santa Claus) he starts by greeting the children with from force of habit until reminded not to do so. He is especially intrigued by humanity&#x27;s ability to complicate their own existence, and their ability to actually get up in the morning without going insane from the sheer prospect of what life entails (from his perspective).

This fascination with humanity extends to the point of sympathy towards them, and he will often side with humans against greater threats, notably the Auditors of Reality. He has on a number of occasions bent the rules to allow a character extra life (e.g., the little girl rescued from the fire in &quot;Reaper Man&quot;, or the Little Match Girl in &quot;Hogfather&quot;). Death has also indicated that he will oblige dying humans by playing a game with them for their lives, much like the personification of Death in &quot;The Seventh Seal&quot;; the games he offers include chess, though he consistently has trouble remembering how the knights move, and another game (referred to by Death as &quot;Exclusive Possession&quot; in the book, presumably based on Monopoly), which the challenger lost despite having &quot;three streets and all the utilities&quot;. Granny Weatherwax was able to play cards against Death in a successful bid to save a child&#x27;s life, Granny&#x27;s hand having four queens while Death&#x27;s had only four &quot;ones&quot;. (A hand of four aces would generally beat a hand of queens in poker, but Death chose to consider them low, giving the old witch a &quot;wink&quot; in the process.)

In the same way that his granddaughter, Susan, has been described as &quot;Helpfulness Personified&quot; in terms of her personality, Death, by his own admission, could very well be described as &#x27;Duty Personified&#x27; in terms of personality; in &quot;Hogfather&quot;, in a discussion with Albert, Death comments He does not cause people to die, nor does he concern himself with their goodness or badness in life; it is simply his job to collect their souls at the appointed time.

In many ways, he epitomizes the bleakness of human existence. In &quot;Reaper Man&quot;, in which he is rendered temporarily mortal (or at least the imagination of being mortal, since his state of being &quot;it/death&quot; is, as mentioned in &quot;Discworld Noir&quot;, constant), he becomes frustrated and infuriated with the unfair inevitability of death, a theme that continues through later books. In &quot;Soul Music&quot; he expresses misery at the fact that he is capable of preventing deaths but is forbidden to do so; during his time as the Hogfather, he uses his new dual role to save a little match girl from dying of the cold by employing a loophole through giving her the gift of a future, thus allowing him to avoid the usual complications that arise from his breaking the rules. Despite his general lack of emotion, the Auditors of Reality are one of the few things actually capable of angering him. He also gets angry upon hearing of Rincewind: In &quot;Eric&quot;, for example, his eyes turn red at the mention of Rincewind. Pratchett even says in &quot;The Art of Discworld&quot; that he has received a number of letters from terminally ill fans in which they hope that Death will resemble the Discworld incarnation — he also says that those particular letters usually cause him to spend some time staring at the wall.

Death has developed considerably since his first appearance in &quot;The Colour of Magic&quot;. In this, he was quite a malicious character and followed Rincewind around wanting him to die after circumstances resulted in Rincewind missing his scheduled appointment. At one point he even deliberately stops a character&#x27;s heart, though later in the book it was shown to have been the actions of Death&#x27;s stand-in, Scrofula. By the time of &quot;Mort&quot; he had gained the sympathetic and humorous personality he has in later books. In later novels he has been used to examine developments in theoretical physics as, being supernatural, he is able to witness such events firsthand although, being a cat lover, he is not fond of the Schrödinger&#x27;s cat thought experiment, believing it cruel to the cats involved.

==Home==
Death resides in an extra-dimensional realm called Death&#x27;s Domain. His home there is a Victorian house with a well-tended garden in shades of black and a skull and crossbones motif. Its name, &quot;Mon Repos&quot;, (Quirmian means &quot;my rest&quot;), and is much larger inside than outside. Death has not mastered scale, not understanding real distance nor perspective either, so its surroundings are blurred and seem distant. Death adds a large golden wheat field to the grounds after the events of &quot;Reaper Man&quot;. A tree swing he built for his granddaughter Susan, swings through the trunk of the tree.

The doors reach a height of several yards yet are only a few feet tall. He has a bathroom which he never uses, with a bar of bone-white, rock-hard soap and a towel rack with hard towels, not knowing that towels are soft and should be foldable. Plumbing confuses him, and the pipes are completely solid. He never sleeps and has a violin he tries to play. He notes in &quot;Soul Music&quot; that he can only play &quot;an empty chord,&quot; the sound made at the end of everything to signify no more sound.

Death&#x27;s house is full of cats. He also sends cats to heaven where Maurice encounters Death.

==Death&#x27;s gender==

The initial books did not pronounce themselves about the sex of Death, using the pronoun &quot;it&quot;, although Ysabell called him &#x27;Daddy&#x27;. In &quot;Mort&quot;, Death&#x27;s pronoun is given as &quot;he&quot; and &quot;his&quot; without the special capital as in the earlier books. Also, when he goes to an employment agent, the agent refers to him as &quot;Mister …&quot;, unable to recall his name to start. In &quot;Reaper Man&quot;, Death is unambiguously identified as a male, and in &quot;Soul Music&quot; and &quot;Hogfather&quot; Susan calls him her grandfather or &quot;Granddad&quot;. When asked to describe Death, in the second Discworld computer game, the protagonist Rincewind hazards a guess, &quot;Well, I suppose he&#x27;s a man. You have to look at the pelvis, don&#x27;t you?&quot; In the comic strip adaptation of &quot;Mort&quot;, Death is seen in mirrors as a black-bearded human wearing a black cloak, a look he takes when he needs to be seen by the living.

Many languages must provide a grammatical gender to each object, and &#x27;death&#x27; is often a feminine noun. As such, translations of early novels sometimes refer to Death as a woman. This is generally changed, by the time of &quot;Reaper Man&quot;. Also, the personification of Death varies from country to country leading to further confusion; for example the Russian personification is that of an old woman, while the Czech version uses for his name a normally nonexistent masculine variant of the feminine word for death. Explanations are given in footnotes, often with a pun.

==Relations and associates==
Death is both the servant and a part of the Old High One known as Azrael, the Death of Universes and ruler of all deaths.

In earlier books and also &quot;Thief of Time&quot; Death works with War, Pestilence, and Famine, three other Horsemen of the Apocalypse. Like him they have grown more human than required. &quot;Form defines function&quot;, Death explains in &quot;Thief of Time&quot;, where Kaos, the Fifth Horseman, left the group before it became famous to work as a milkman under the name Ronnie Soak, before reuniting with the other Horsemen at the end.

===Lord Mortimer, Duke of Sto Helit===

Mortimer — shortened to &quot;Mort&quot; (but also &#x27;death&#x27; in French and the fictional Quirmian) and so linking him to his master, Death — is the title character in the fourth &quot;Discworld&quot; novel, &quot;Mort&quot;. Mort is described as being very tall and skinny, with muscles like knots in string. He has a shock of bright red hair, and walks as if he is made entirely of knees. He is first seen as the over-thoughtful son of a farmer in the Octarine Grass Country, near the Ramtops. Having proved himself unworthy as a scarecrow, he is chosen by Death to be his apprentice. 

Mort starts off at the bottom, learning to accept his position while mucking out the stables, and trying to ignore Ysabell, Death&#x27;s adopted daughter. When Death feels in need of a break, Mort is charged with taking over &quot;The Duty&quot;. Unfortunately for Mort, his feelings for Keli, the teenage princess of Sto Lat get in the way of his job, and he starts off a chain reaction of events by interfering and impulsively preventing her assassination. Reluctant to tell his master about his complete gaffe, Mort tries various, more and more extreme, unsuccessful methods to rectify the situation. This culminates with taking Keli out of the Disc, whereupon Death brings the fiasco to an end. After fighting a duel with Death and losing to his master, Mort is given an extra lease of life when the Grim Reaper chooses to turn over his Lifetimer, thus allowing Mort to stay in the world of the living.

At the end of the events of &quot;Mort&quot;, Mort leaves Death&#x27;s service and marries Ysabell. The couple are given the titles of Duke and Duchess of Sto Helit. Later, they become the parents of Susan Sto Helit. They subsequently meet their end after a freak accident that sends their carriage plunging into a ravine, as revealed in the opening of &quot;Soul Music&quot;. They had discussed this with Death and had turned down his offer to extend the duration of their existence on the ground that it would not be the same as actually lengthening their lives.

In &quot;The Light Fantastic&quot;, Rincewind overhears Twoflower teaching the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse — Death, Famine, Pestilence and War — how to play bridge. At one point, War refers to Death as &quot;Mort&quot;, but we later learn that the only people in the room (other than Twoflower), were Death, Famine, Pestilence, and War. The name is probably the reason as to why Death chose Mort as his apprentice.

In the Cosgrove Hall animation of &quot;Soul Music&quot;, Mort is voiced by Neil Morrissey. In 2004, BBC Radio 4 adapted &quot;Mort&quot;, with the title character being voiced by Carl Prekopp.

Mort is included in Wayne Barlowe&#x27;s &quot;Barlowe&#x27;s Guide to Fantasy&quot;.

===Lady Ysabell, Duchess of Sto Helit===
Ysabell is the adopted daughter of Death who saved her life when she was a baby after her parents died in the Great Nef Desert. Why he did so is uncertain. &quot;He didn&#x27;t feel sorry for me, he never feels anything... He probably &quot;thought&quot; sorry for me&quot; Ysabell says. When first encountered she is as a sixteen-year-old girl with silver hair and silver eyes who, it transpires, has been sixteen for 35 Discworld &#x27;years&#x27;; since no time passes in Death&#x27;s Domain. 

Ysabell first appears in a brief cameo role in the second Discworld novel, &quot;The Light Fantastic&quot;, Her encounter with Rincewind is flamboyant enough to make him believe she is &#x27;bonkers&#x27; and she is surprised to learn that he is not dead. This state of affairs might not have continued long if the Luggage had not intervened.

When Mort first encountered Ysabell, he got the impression of &quot;too many chocolates&quot; (though Pratchett notes that he would have described her as &#x27;Pre-Raphaelite&#x27; if he had ever heard the word). She also has a fixation on the colour pink. Until Mort&#x27;s arrival, she just shared Death&#x27;s home with Albert the manservant. During the events of the fourth Discworld novel, &quot;Mort&quot;, it became clear that Ysabell was competent in the family business, including &#x27;The Duty&#x27; and &#x27;doing the nodes&#x27;. This mainly involved figuring out which deaths needed to be attended to personally, an important aspect of all reality. 

Ysabell marries Mort and becomes ennobled as the Duchess of Sto Helit at the end of &quot;Mort&quot;, but does not enjoy a long life as she is killed with her husband in an accident at the opening of the 14th Discworld novel, Soul Music to be succeeded by their infant daughter, Susan. 

BBC Radio 4 adapted &quot;Mort&quot; in 2004, Clare Corbett voiced Ysabell.

===Lady Susan, Duchess of Sto Helit===

Susan Sto Helit was Mort and Ysabell&#x27;s daughter and only child. When she first appeared as a schoolgirl in &quot;Soul Music&quot;, Susan had, at age sixteen, just inherited the duchy on the death of her parents. During her upbringing, her parents had hidden her background from her and brought her up to be logical, so it comes as a shock when the Death of Rats and Quoth the Raven come looking for her. She had to act as a stand-in for Death when he disappeared, but subsequently returned to her education. Although she inherited all of her grandfather&#x27;s abilities (despite being technically unrelated, as genetics work differently on the Discworld), she longed to be normal, and got human jobs, first as a governess in &quot;Hogfather&quot;, and then as a schoolteacher in &quot;Thief of Time&quot;. Death constantly dragged her back into his world. At the end of &quot;Thief of Time&quot;, she begins a relationship with Lobsang Ludd, the anthropomorphic personification of Time.

===Albert===

Albert is Death&#x27;s manservant, butler, and cook, was originally the noted wizard and founder of Unseen University, Alberto Malich. He attempted to gain immortality by reciting backwards a ritual to summon Death, the Rite of AshkEnte, believing this would force Death to stay away from him; instead it brought him directly to Death&#x27;s Domain. Since time does not flow in the same way in Death&#x27;s Domain as it does on the Discworld, Albert succeeded, in a way, in gaining immortality. Before he returned to the world in &quot;Mort&quot; when he is first encountered, Albert had 91 days, three hours, and five minutes of time left on the Disc, most of which he spent shopping and using the soap and baths at the &quot;Young Men&#x27;s Reformed Cultist of the Ichor-God-Bel-Shamharoth&#x27;s Association&quot; (Death is not very good at plumbing). After &quot;Soul Music&quot;, he had only a few seconds left, and could no longer leave Death&#x27;s Domain. Albert was a highly idiosyncratic cook, who believed everything needed to be fried to get rid of the germs, including porridge.

The founder&#x27;s statue of Alberto in a hallway of Unseen University was inscribed, (apart from the usual student scribbles), with: &quot;We shall not see his like again&quot;. This turned out to be entirely wrong. After the statue was destroyed at the end of &quot;Mort&quot; when Albert decides it is a poor likeness of him, the wizards believed that the returned Albert was in fact the statue come to life, and it was suggested that a new one be built in a very secure place — such as the dungeon, allegedly to prevent it being defiled by students. Alberto Malich was a powerful wizard, perhaps the most powerful a wizard could be. This was why he so easily devised a spell to slow the passage of time indefinitely around a small area, a near-impossible feat with Discworld magic.

When Death went missing in &quot;Soul Music&quot;, Albert tried to find him on the Disc, but got robbed and his life-timer was broken. After this incident, Albert had approximately 34 seconds left, and thus could no longer return to the world of the living, as Death cannot make his life longer. The remaining sand was kept in a bottle in Albert&#x27;s bedroom. Albert was able to temporarily return to the Discworld during the events of &quot;Hogfather&quot;, although merely in the pseudo-reality that allowed the Hogfather to travel around the entire world in a single night, and hence not actually &quot;in&quot; the world, strictly speaking.

Albert&#x27;s childhood was touched upon lightly in &quot;Hogfather&quot;. He came from a very poor family, even by the standards of Ankh-Morpork. This novel also suggested that he was fond of pork pies with mustard and sherry.

While Death and Albert got on rather well, it was a fragile relationship. In &quot;Mort&quot;, Albert returned to the world to help Death, but seemed ready to attack him when it looked like he had his former job as Archchancellor back. He also seemed not to trust Death with his life-timer, and took it with him in &quot;Soul Music&quot;, although Death later reflected that the action was pointless, as he would never have done anything to it. Albert frequently found himself trying to keep Death &quot;on course&quot; when his master became too human. He and Susan did not get on very well.

===Binky===
Binky is Death&#x27;s steed, so named by Death because it is &quot;a nice name&quot;. He is a living horse. Death tried a skeletal steed, but kept having to &quot;stop and wire bits back on&quot;. Death also tried a fiery steed, but it repeatedly set his barn and his robe on fire.

Binky is rather more intelligent than most horses and is absolutely pure milky white. He can fly by just creating his own ground-level, and travel through time and across dimensions, sometimes leaving glowing hoofprints in his wake, but in all other respects is a perfectly ordinary horse. He is well-treated, and loyal to his master and Susan. He is shod by Jason Ogg, a Lancrastian blacksmith of mythical skill. Binky is not immortal, but while in Death&#x27;s service does not age. Binky gained some of his powers by sharing one of Death&#x27;s qualities: being so much &quot;realer&quot; than ordinary things such as walls, great distances, or time that he can simply ignore them.

Death gave Susan a &quot;My Little Binky&quot; gift set for her third birthday. It was returned by her parents, who feared that it would make her a less &quot;normal&quot; child.

===The Death of Rats===
The Death of Rats, also known as the Grim Squeaker, is not, strictly speaking, a personification in his own right but rather an aspect of Death, allowed an independent existence. His purpose is to usher on the souls of dead rodents, and assist Death in other ways. His jurisdiction also seems to cover certain kinds of &quot;ratty&quot; humans, such as Mr Clete in &quot;Soul Music&quot;, Mr Pin in &quot;The Truth&quot;, and Mr Pounder in &quot;Maskerade&quot;.

He was one of a disparate multitude of death-personifications created during Death&#x27;s absence in &quot;Reaper Man&quot;. The Death of Rats fought and refused to be reabsorbed into Death himself upon the latter&#x27;s resumption of his duties, and Death kept him around for company. The Death of Fleas also escaped resorption, but was not seen after &quot;Reaper Man&quot;. The Death of Rats resembles a murine skeleton walking on its hind legs, wearing a black robe, and carrying a tiny scythe, since his form took shape from the latent form of Death in &quot;Reaper Man&quot;, and he came into existence in the vicinity of Death&#x27;s alter ego, Bill Door.

The Death of Rats finds ways around the rules more easily than Death, and assisted Susan in &quot;Soul Music&quot;, &quot;Hogfather&quot;, and &quot;Thief of Time&quot;. He sometimes travels with a talking raven named Quoth, who acts as his translator.

The Death of Rats, like Death, speaks in , but has a vocabulary consisting of words such as &#x27;, and &#x27; when he laughs, although his speech could be interpreted from context in the same way as the Librarian&#x27;s.

In the mythology of the Changeling Clan of talking rats in &quot;The Amazing Maurice and his Educated Rodents&quot;, the Death of Rats was known as the Bone Rat.

===Quoth===

Quoth is a talking raven who accompanies the Death of Rats. He was named Quoth by his previous owner, a wizard with no sense of humour attempting to make a joke by referencing the famous line in &quot;The Raven&quot; by Edgar Allan Poe — but Quoth refused to give in to this stereotype by saying &quot;the N word&quot; (&#x27;nevermore&#x27;). At times, he acts as steed and interpreter for the Death of Rats. He has a constant craving for eyeballs and frequently (and hopefully) mistakes various other small round objects for eyeballs, such as olives and walnuts. He was originally one of the ravens from Unseen University&#x27;s Tower of Art, the magical properties of which gave him his ability to speak.

He was first seen in &quot;Soul Music&quot;, then appeared in all novels involving Susan Sto Helit. Neil Pearson voiced him in the Sky One adaptation of &quot;Hogfather&quot;.

===New Death===
The New Death appeared in &quot;Reaper Man&quot; when he came to collect the old Death, then known as &quot;Bill Door&quot;. The New Death was the old Death&#x27;s replacement as a result of the plot by the Auditors of Reality to rid the world of sloppy thinking.

The New Death came from human belief, but was quite different from the original, having been formed by modern Discworlders who thought of death as malevolent rather than a simple cessation of life. Though he had the usual black robe, he was larger and had only smoke beneath his robe rather than bones, and wore a crown to the disgust of the original Death. He rode the classic skeletal steed, in contrast to the special, but very real Binky. Instead of a scythe he wielded a weapon &quot;which may, at some point in its evolution, have incorporated aspects of a scythe, in the same way a scalpel incorporated aspects of a stick&quot;. In place of a face or skull, the new Death had just his crown and was prideful, dramatic, cold, and cruel, the literal embodiment of humanity&#x27;s fear of death. He chose to arrive exactly at midnight and appeared in a flash of lightning purely for the dramatic effect, which the old Death found degrading and rather excessive. When he cornered Bill Door, he mocked and beat him instead of finishing the job.

Bill Door was disgusted and horrified by the New Death&#x27;s callous attitude toward humanity, and his victory is the triumph of the compassionate &quot;reaper man&quot; over a tyrant who has no care for the harvest. The new Death was destroyed by Bill Door using the scythe he used on the farm; a humble garden tool, not the infinitely sharp implement of Death, but sharpened by his rage and the harvest. 

==Rite of AshkEnte==
The Rite of AshkEnte — also written as Ashk&#x27;Ente or Ash&#x27;Kente — was an ancient magic ritual that summoned and bound Death in a circle and prevented him from leaving until invited to do so by the summoning wizard. This may have been wishful thinking on the part of the wizards as, in &quot;Eric&quot;, Death appeared outside the circle, behind the wizards, and in &quot;Reaper Man&quot; a wizard commented that he believed Death only stayed in the circle for the look of the thing. The Rite is not tuned to Death himself, but rather to whoever happened to be performing his duties — Mort (then as Death&#x27;s apprentice) was almost forced to respond to the summons, until Ysabell&#x27;s intervention, and Susan Sto Helit (his granddaughter) was summoned and subsequently bound in &quot;The Hogfather&quot;. The rite does not appear to apply to Death himself, although he may just appear out of politeness.

Since Death was professionally involved in almost everything going on everywhere, the Rite was usually performed to question him on otherwise inexplicable phenomena. This was usually done only when all other avenues were exhausted, as most powerful wizards were quite old and therefore unwilling to attract the attention of Death. Death hated being summoned, because he was always summoned at the &quot;worst possible time&quot;, such as when at a party.

The Rite also caused Albert&#x27;s affiliation with Death; while he was still Archchancellor of Unseen University, Albert attempted to become immortal by performing the Rite backwards, reasoning that this would banish Death from him, but instead it transferred Albert to Death&#x27;s realm, where he decided to remain on the grounds that time did not pass in Death&#x27;s realm and he was thus essentially immortal.

There were twelve ways to perform the Rite, but eight of them caused instant death, and might summon Death in the &quot;usual&quot; manner, and the ninth is very hard to remember. This left three ways to safely summon death: Although the Rite could be performed by a couple of people with three small sticks and 4 cc of mouse blood, or even with a fresh egg and only two small sticks, the wizards (Ridcully excepted) preferred to do it the old fashioned way, with heavy equipment consisting of numerous drippy candles, octograms on the floor, thuribles, and similar paraphernalia. They felt it was not &quot;proper&quot; wizardry if it wasn&#x27;t showy enough.

The Rite has been used several times In the &quot;Discworld&quot; books:
*In &quot;The Light Fantastic&quot;, Death was summoned to be asked about the recent mass wave of magic that had apparently done nothing, revealing that the Octavo had taken action to prevent the eighth spell dropping off the Disc so that all eight spells could be used to prevent the imminent destruction of the world. Death later returned to collect one of the high-ranking wizards present at the Rite as his time had run out. The wizard, realising his time was near, locked himself in a room sealed both magically and physically against all ills. A later book notes that doing so probably made him &quot;more&quot; likely to be found by Death.
*In &quot;Mort&quot;, Albert, briefly returned to the world, summoned Death, who was having a holiday, to let him know that Mort, his apprentice, was doing a terrible job as his replacement. It almost summoned Mort instead.
*In &quot;Eric&quot;, Death was asked about an occult disturbance that turned out to be Rincewind. Death appeared outside of the binding octogram and walked into it only at the insistence of the gathered wizards.
*In &quot;Reaper Man&quot;, when Death was forced to retire by the Auditors, an Auditor appeared in Death&#x27;s place to inform the wizards of the situation and when they asked about the sudden abundance of life force, assured them that &#x27;normal service&#x27; would resume shortly.
*In &quot;Soul Music&quot;, when Death had again taken a break from work, the Rite instead summoned his granddaughter Susan, who was filling in.
*The Rite is also used in the computer game &quot;Discworld 2&quot;. The game requires the player to find not only the three small sticks (of equal length) and 4 cc of mouse blood mentioned above, but also dribbly candles, a vile stench, and some glitter. During the ritual, the wizards perform an off-key version of &quot;Day-O (Banana Boat Song)&quot; and Death appears behind them, fresh from vacation, wearing a cork hat.

==Appearances in other media==

===Film===
In the 2022 international co-production CGI-animated film of &quot;The Amazing Maurice&quot; – adapted fairly directly from the 28th &quot;Discworld&quot; novel of 2001, &quot;The Amazing Maurice and his Educated Rodents&quot; – Death is voiced by the noted British actor and comedian Peter Serafinowicz alongside Hugh Laurie as the titular cat of equally prodigious capabilities.

===Television===
====Animated====
In the Cosgrove Hall 1997 animated adaptations of &quot;Soul Music&quot; and &quot;Wyrd Sisters&quot; (and the &quot;Welcome to the Discworld&quot; pilot based on a extract from &quot;Reaper Man&quot;), Death was voiced by Christopher Lee. In &quot;Soul Music&quot;, the voice actors are: 
* Albert – Brian Pringle 
* Susan Sto-Helit – Debra Gillett 
* Mort – Neil Morrissey 
* Ysabell – Melissa Sinden
* Quoth the Raven and the Death of Rats are uncredited.

====Live-action====
In the 2006 Sky One adaptation of &quot;Hogfather&quot; he was voiced by Ian Richardson. The actor who played the physical Death in Hogfather was Marnix van den Broeke, a tall Netherlander.

In the 2008 Sky One adaptation of &quot;The Colour of Magic&quot;, van den Broeke reprised the physical role, with Christopher Lee returning to the voice the character, after the death of Richardson.

In the 2021 series &quot;The Watch&quot;, Wendell Pierce voiced Death.

===Radio===
Death has been voiced in all five BBC Radio adaptations of Discworld novels. Geoffrey Whitehead played the part in the adaptation of &quot;Mort&quot;, and also in Episode 1 of &quot;Eric&quot;. John Rowe played him in &quot;The Amazing Maurice and His Educated Rodents&quot;, and Michael Kilgarriff voiced Death in Episode 4 of &quot;Small Gods&quot;. In both &quot;Guards! Guards!&quot; and &quot;Wyrd Sisters,&quot; Death is credited as being played by himself (in &quot;Guards! Guards!&quot; he is actually voiced by Stephen Thorne, who also played Sergeant Colon).

===Computer games===
Death has appeared in various other media: in the Discworld game series he is voiced firstly by Rob Brydon and later by Nigel Planer.

===Theatre===
Death has also been played by numerous actors in amateur stage productions of &quot;Wyrd Sisters&quot;, &quot;Mort&quot;, &quot;Soul Music&quot;, and &quot;Hogfather&quot;, as well as various other plays based on the novels.

===Internet culture===
After his death in March 2015, Pratchett&#x27;s daughter Rhianna wrote in three tweets from her father&#x27;s Twitter account:

Fans launched a tongue-in-cheek petition on Change.org, requesting for Death to return Pratchett to life because, &quot;Terry Pratchett turned Death from a figure of hate into a much loved and sometimes welcomed character. No-one else cared about you Death. You owe him!&quot;

==Associates of Death in other media==
===The Death of Rats===
The Death of Rats appeared in the animated &quot;Soul Music&quot; and the radio play &quot;The Amazing Maurice and His Educated Rodents&quot;, but no voice credit was given for either. In the &quot;Hogfather&quot; TV series the voice was credited to Dorckey Hellmice (an anagram of Michelle Dockery who played Susan Sto Helit in the same TV series), while in the &quot;Discworld 2&quot; game, the voice is credited as Katherine the Crocodile. The Death of Rats also appears in &quot;Discworld Noir&quot;.

===Albert===
In Cosgrove Hall&#x27;s 1996 animated &quot;Soul Music&quot;, Albert was voiced by Bryan Pringle. In BBC Radio 4&#x27;s 2004 adaptation of &quot;Mort&quot;, he was voiced by Philip Jackson.

In Sky One&#x27;s live-action version of &quot;Hogfather&quot;, Albert was played by David Jason.

Albert also makes an appearance in the computer game &quot;Discworld 2: Missing Presumed...!?&quot;, voiced by Nigel Planer.

<text>Baltimore Memorial Stadium was a multi-purpose stadium in Baltimore, Maryland, United States, that formerly stood on 33rd Street on an oversized block officially called Venable Park, a former city park from the 1920s. The site was bound by Ellerslie Avenue to the west, 36th Street to the north, and Ednor Road to the east. 

Two stadiums were located here — a 1922 version known primarily as Baltimore Stadium or Municipal Stadium; and a rebuilt, double-deck, multi-sport stadium, completed in mid-1954, and rechristened Baltimore Memorial Stadium — Memorial Stadium for short.

==History==
===Construction of the football stadium===
Memorial Stadium was launched as Municipal Stadium, also sometimes known as Baltimore Stadium or Venable Stadium. Designed by Pleasants Pennington and Albert W. Lewis, it was built in 1922 over a six-month period at the urging of the Mayor, William F. Broening in a previously undeveloped area just north beyond the city&#x27;s iconic rows of rowhouses. The stadium was constructed in what was formerly Venable Park and was operated by the city&#x27;s Board of Park Commissioners. 

It was primarily a football stadium, a large horseshoe with an earthen-mound exterior and its open end with a large stone gateway of a Greek/Roman colonnade and porticoes on the open-faced south side facing the new 33rd Street boulevard/parkway which had just recently been cut through east to west. In this configuration, it seated anywhere from 70,000 to 80,000 people.

In its early years it hosted various public and private high school and college-level games, including the annual &quot;City - Poly Game&quot; on the regular Thanksgiving Day &quot;double-header where the &quot;Collegians&quot; (later known as the &quot;Black Knights&quot; in reference to their iconic &quot;Castle on the Hill&quot;) of Baltimore City College opposed its rival Baltimore Polytechnic Institute &quot;Engineers&quot; (since 1889), along with the Roman Catholic high schools&#x27; &quot;Loyola - Calvert Hall&quot; Game pitting the Cardinals of Calvert Hall College against Loyola High School at Blakefield&#x27;s Dons. 

Home games for the University of Maryland at College Park&#x27;s Terrapins football and the United States Naval Academy Midshipmen were sometimes held at the stadium, attracting a national audience and media coverage.

===Baseball park===

In July 1944, Municipal Stadium was pressed into service as a baseball park by the Baltimore Orioles of the International League, when their previous home, &quot;Oriole Park,&quot; located in the Abell neighborhood to the southwest, was destroyed by fire. 

The minor league Orioles went on to win the International League championship and the Junior World Series that year. The large post-season crowds in attendance at Municipal Stadium, which would not have been possible at Oriole Park, even surpassing the attendance of Major League Baseball&#x27;s 1944 World Series, caught the attention of professional team owners, and Baltimore suddenly became regarded as a viable option for teams looking to relocate.

Further momentum for sports in Baltimore was spurred when the failing Miami Seahawks franchise of the fledgling All-America Football Conference (AAFC) was relaunched in the fall of 1947 as the Baltimore Colts. 

The presence of professional football and the prospect of professional baseball spurred the city to rebuild Municipal Stadium into a facility of &quot;major league caliber.&quot; This reconstructed stadium was to be renamed Baltimore Memorial Stadium in honor of the thousands of the city&#x27;s dead of the recently concluded World War II. Baltimore mayor Thomas D&#x27;Alesandro Jr. championed the new stadium project and overcame various legal and political hurdles which delayed progress on the project.

The initial plan called for a single, horseshoe-shaped deck to be built, with the open end facing north, and was designed to host football as well as baseball. It was engineered with enough strength to eventually support a second deck and a roof.

The lower deck reconstruction began in the spring/early summer of 1949 and was done in stages, first at the previously open south end of the stadium, and slowly obliterating the old Municipal Stadium stands, even as the International League Orioles continued playing on their makeshift diamond, along with the new Baltimore Colts of the former All-America Football Conference merged with the reorganized National Football League.

The old seating at the north end was retained for the pro and college football seasons that fall. By year&#x27;s end, the horseshoe was sufficiently completed to allow the baseball infield to be relocated from the northwest corner of the field to the south end, and the Orioles opened the 1950 season at the newly oriented diamond. Construction continued on the single deck, until finally all the remnants of the old stadium were gone. The new facility could seat around 31,000.

===Second deck===

The first Baltimore Colts franchise terminated operations for financial reasons at the end of the 1950 season. Community support for a second NFL franchise remained strong, however, and late in 1952 a group of Baltimore businessmen pooled their resources in a bid to win a new league franchise. A &quot;Bring Back the Colts&quot; drive launched in December 1952 generated the presale of 15,000 season tickets in just six weeks. The campaign made an impression and Baltimore, then the sixth largest city in the United States, was awarded an expansion team for the 1953 NFL season.

With the NFL back and realistic rumors simultaneously circulating of the arrival of major league baseball, the second deck construction was begun during the summer of 1953. First, two groups of sections were built facing the 50 yard line. Then they were extended toward the south end, completing the upper deck horseshoe. Additional plans to fully enclose the stadium and add a roof to the upper tier were never implemented, although an extra upper deck section would be added on each side in 1964.

Work accelerated in November 1953 when the St. Louis Browns of the American League were announced to be moving to Baltimore to become the new major league version of the Baltimore Orioles, to begin play in April 1954, the city&#x27;s first major league franchise in over 50 years (not counting the Federal League experiment). The total cost of the multi-phase project was $6.5 million.

The expanded stadium was still under construction as of baseball&#x27;s opening day in 1954, with the new entrance plaza and the new outfield lighting not yet finished. Work was finally completed at the start of the summer.

On April 15, 1954, thousands of Baltimoreans jammed city streets as the new Orioles paraded from downtown at the Baltimore City Hall to Memorial Stadium for their first home game. During the 90-minute parade, the new &quot;Birds&quot; signed autographs, handed out pictures and threw styrofoam balls to the crowd as the throngs marched down several major city streets ending on East 33rd Street. Inside, more than 46,000 watched the Orioles beat the Chicago White Sox, 3–1, to win their home opener and move into first place (although temporarily) in the American League.


Both the new Orioles and the Colts had some great successes over coming years, with both teams becoming among the winningest and competitive franchises in their respective leagues during the late 1950s and throughout the decade of the 1960s.

===Abandonment===
The dual-use stadium was not without its critics, however. Traffic and a parking shortage made accessing the stadium difficult. Concrete poles blocked views, and unsheltered areas grew hot in the summer. Most of the seats were bench-style, with few having chair backs — let alone more modern amenities.

The NFL&#x27;s Baltimore Colts were the first to express deep dissatisfaction and to seek a new venue. In addition to sub-optimal conditions at Memorial Stadium, capacity was a concern, with the Colts selling out every home game from the start of the 1964 season to the end of 1970 and unable to meet demand for season tickets.

In 1970, Colts owner Carroll Rosenbloom announced that he was seeking a 500 acre parcel in one of three suburban Baltimore counties for construction of a new stadium. A new $20 million football-only facility was planned, with Rosenbloom adamant that the team would be leaving Memorial Stadium expeditiously due to unhappiness with stadium conditions and ongoing irritation over a September legal dispute with the city over whether a Monday Night Football game could be hosted at the site — a dispute which Rosenbloom characterized as &quot;the end of the road.&quot;

No stadium deal was ever completed by Rosenbloom.

On July 13, 1972, businessman Robert Irsay made a last-minute bid of $19 million to purchase the Los Angeles Rams from the estate of Dan Reeves. He immediately swapped franchises with Colts owner Rosenbloom, becoming the controlling partner of the Baltimore franchise that same day. Rosenbloom&#x27;s stadium problem became Irsay&#x27;s stadium problem, with the former becoming the new tenant of the capacious Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum.

Memorial Stadium&#x27;s limitations remained and its amenities continued to deteriorate over time. A decade passed and still neither Irsay nor the city could agree to desperately-needed improvements to the aging and tattered stadium. Irsay began to visit other cities, moving various civic leaders to put together stadium packages that would provide a better financial and physical situation for the Colts. Indianapolis was chosen.

In the middle of a snowy night on March 29, 1984, under threat of a measure introduced into the state legislature to initiate condemnation proceedings for the city and state assert eminent domain and take ownership of the Colts franchise, moving vans rolled in and the Colts rolled out for their new Indiana home.

Loss of the Colts left the Orioles as Memorial Stadium&#x27;s sole major league tenant and dramatically increased the level of urgency of the political establishment regarding necessary stadium upgrades.

When the decision to abandon Memorial Stadium (in favor of the new downtown ballpark) became imminent, various citizen groups began to organize opposition to the decision. In particular, the neighborhoods surrounding Memorial Stadium became anxious about the impact on their area of an abandoned &quot;white elephant&quot;: there simply wasn&#x27;t any other use that would generate the funds to properly maintain the site, and there were no funds for demolition and redevelopment. While the stadium events may have created periodic disruptions to local life, it did provide easy access to major league sports and special attention from the city for maintenance of the area.

The mayor and other power brokers knew of strong general public opposition to subsidizing a new ballpark. City-wide and local community leaders also knew of this potential, but there was also a shortage of leaders willing to take on this task (although this was never stated, and may not have been known by Mayor Schaefer). During this pivotal period, local community leaders decided to &quot;bargain away the petition drive&quot; for certain considerations. To do this, area community groups formed the &quot;Stadium Neighborhoods Coalition&quot; (SNC) and negotiated the following: (1) Establishment of an official Memorial Redevelopment Stadium Task Force with public meetings and minutes; and, (2) a written pledge by then Mayor Schaefer to provide upfront funding for any demolition and redevelopment resulting from this community process.

The Orioles played their final game at the stadium on October 6, 1991, which ended in a defeat at the hands of the Detroit Tigers, 7-1; a postgame ceremony was held with 78 past Oriole players meeting, and ended with home plate being removed by the grounds crew and placed in a stretch limousine. It was sent across town to Camden Yards under police escort where it would be placed at the new stadium minutes later.

For the next decade, while the community input process lumbered on, Memorial Stadium hosted a minor league baseball team and two new professional football teams. The Bowie Baysox, a minor league affiliate of the Orioles, played their inaugural 1993 season at Memorial Stadium while their permanent home ballpark was being built. As the Orioles were then in their second season at Camden Yards, this gave Baltimore the rare distinction of hosting both major league and minor league teams simultaneously; currently, New York City has that honor with the presence of the Brooklyn Cyclones, who are affiliated with the Mets.

The Baltimore Stallions played during the Canadian Football League&#x27;s &quot;southern expansion&quot; experiment to the United States for two seasons in 1994 and 1995. The team was originally known as the &quot;Baltimore CFL Colts&quot;, but they were forced to change their name to the Stallions (after one year of playing without an official name) when the NFL was granted a legal court injunction which prevented the CFL franchise from reclaiming the &quot;Colts&quot; name. Owner Jim Speros took over the facility, exchanging tickets to contractors for renovations to help bring the dilapidated stadium to workable condition. Memorial Stadium was unique in that it was one of the few U. S. stadiums that could accommodate the full 65-yard width and 150-yard length of a regulation Canadian football field (most likely since it had been designed for baseball as well as American football). They had winning records in each of the 1994 and 1995 seasons, and in both years advanced to the championship game. Averaging more than 30,000 spectators a game for two years, the Stallions would eventually become the only American team to win the Grey Cup in 1995.

The CFL Stallions were ultimately forced out of town when Cleveland Browns owner Art Modell announced he was moving his team to Baltimore. Following protracted negotiations between Modell, the two cities and the NFL, it was decided that Modell would be allowed to take his players and organization to Baltimore as the Ravens, while leaving the Browns name and legacy for a replacement team that returned in 1999. The Ravens were tenants of the stadium until the end of the 1997 NFL regular season, when they moved to what is now M&amp;T Bank Stadium. It was bid farewell in style by both the Orioles (in a field-encircling ceremony staged by many former Oriole players and hosted by Hall of Fame announcer Ernie Harwell, who began his announcing career here) and the Ravens (who had many former Colts assemble for a final play, run by Unitas. The play had Unitas hand the ball off to Lydell Mitchell, who then handed the ball to Lenny Moore in a reverse and Moore ran in for a touchdown).

Through all of this, the official Redevelopment Task Force met off and on, deliberating on prospects for long-term use. The community remained quite sensitized about any inappropriate use of this center-of-the-neighborhood structure. When word leaked that the stadium was being considered for staging rock concerts, a group of neighbors organized the group &quot;People Against Concerts at Memorial Stadium&quot; (PACAMS). As Baltimore was deciding to confirm or deny this story—with no immediate answer—a large public opposition developed. With the resulting outpouring of anger, the City publicly confirmed its decision not to lease the site for rock concerts.

In resolving the rock concert problem, a new spirit of proactive advocacy was ignited in the community. In fact, there had been developing a division within established neighborhood groups about the best tactics in securing a good future for the stadium. Should the groups make further use of the direct action tactics of PACAMS, or use quiet lobbying by established groups?

That division was never resolved, as individuals continued to work in different paths. In fact, PACAMS, after its success in preventing the stadium&#x27;s use for concerts, reconstituted itself as &quot;People Advocating a Community Agenda for Memorial Stadium&quot;—continuing with the successful PACAMS acronym. With PACAMS&#x27; public advocacy, and the established groups&#x27; holding fast to more traditional lines of community, there ultimately resulted in a large, and well attended, public meeting where several redevelopment proposals were presented. The resulting community preference for a mixed used development led to the successful development now on site.

===Demolition and redevelopment===

The City of Baltimore solicited proposals for development of the site. Most proposals preserved some or all of the stadium, including the memorial to World War II veterans and words on the facade. One proposal even had a school occupying the former offices of Memorial Stadium and the field used as a recreational facility for the school. Mayor Martin J. O&#x27;Malley, however, favored the proposal that resulted in the total razing of the stadium, an act that many fought and protested. Former mayor and governor William Donald Schaefer protested that the stadium was razed for political reasons. The venerable and historic stadium was demolished over a 10-month period beginning in April 2001. Approximately of concrete rubble from it was used to build an artificial reef over a site in the Chesapeake Bay west of Tolchester Beach in 2002.

As of 2005, the former site of Memorial Stadium housed Maryland&#x27;s largest YMCA facility and the developing vision of &quot;Stadium Place&quot;, a mixed income community for seniors in Baltimore City. Currently there are four senior apartment complexes up and running on site.
All of this, the political wranglings, the sports history and the city&#x27;s attachment to a doomed landmark was captured in a documentary, &quot;The Last Season, The Life and Demolition of Memorial Stadium.&quot;

There was also a plan initially to keep the front of the stadium as a dedication to commemorate all who served America during both World Wars, but it had to also be taken down because alone, it was structurally unsafe.

===New field===
In 2010, work started on developing a new recreational baseball/football field on the site (Cal Ripken Senior Youth Development Field), with home plate being in the same exact location as it was when Memorial Stadium existed. The field was completed in December 2010. A ribbon-cutting ceremony on December 7 was attended by Billy and Cal Ripken, and Governor Martin O&#x27;Malley.

==Layout==
The general layout of Memorial Stadium resembled a somewhat scaled-down version of Cleveland Stadium (then home of the MLB Indians and NFL Browns). Due to the need to fit a football field on the premises, the playing area was initially quite large, especially in center field and foul territory. The construction of inner fences after 1958, however, reduced the size of the outfield. The addition of several rows of box seats also reduced the foul ground, ultimately making the stadium much more of a hitters&#x27; park than it was originally. It did host the Major League Baseball All-Star Game that year. Memorial Stadium was one of the nation&#x27;s few venues to host a World Series, an MLB All-Star Game, and an NFL Championship game.

===Incidents===
At least two serious incidents occurred within Baltimore Memorial Stadium.

====Fatal escalator accident====
On May 2, 1964, a freak accident involving a stadium escalator caused the death of a teenaged girl and injuries to 46 other children. That day, the Orioles held &quot;Safety Patrol Day&quot; to honor schoolchildren who served in their schools&#x27; safety patrols, in which they helped their fellow students travel to and from school safely. For the event, 20,000 schoolchildren from around the state of Maryland were given free admission to the Orioles&#x27; game against the Cleveland Indians.

While the national anthem was playing before the start of the game, hundreds of children began getting onto an escalator that traveled from the lower deck to the upper deck on the stadium&#x27;s third base side. Unfortunately, while three or four children at a time were getting on the escalator at the bottom, the top of the escalator was partially blocked by a narrow metal gate that allowed only one person to pass through. The mass of children was thus blocked at the top, and children began falling back on top of one another in a crush of bodies as other children continued to get on at the bottom and as the jagged metal steps of the escalator continued to move beneath all of them. The moving steps cut and mutilated the children until a stadium usher, 65-year-old Melville Gibson, finally reached the escalator&#x27;s emergency shut-off switch and turned the escalator off. Previously, the shut-off switch had been moved to a wall across from the escalator in order to prevent pranksters from turning it off while people were on it.

A 14-year-old girl named Annette S. Costantine was killed in the accident. 46 other children were injured, some more seriously than others.

The gate at the top of the escalator — called a &quot;people channeler&quot; — had apparently been left there after a previous event, when the escalator&#x27;s direction had been switched to move people downward. The gate&#x27;s purpose was to control the flow of people getting onto the escalator. Shortly before the tragedy, Orioles management had decided to open the stadium&#x27;s upper deck to Safety Patrol members who were still arriving by game time, after early-arriving children had filled the bleachers. Children heading for the upper deck then got onto the escalator. It was considered the worst accident in the history of the stadium.

====Airplane crash====
A small private airplane crashed on the stadium premises on December 19, 1976, just minutes after the conclusion of an NFL playoff game of the Colts&#x27; game with the Pittsburgh Steelers. The airplane, a Piper Cherokee, buzzed the stadium, and then crashed into the upper deck overlooking the south end zone. The Steelers had won the game handily (40–14), and most of the fans had already exited the stadium by the time the game ended. There were only four light injuries, and the pilot was arrested for &quot;reckless flying&quot;. Donald Kroner was the 33-year-old pilot charged with reckless flying, littering, and making a bomb threat against former Baltimore Colts linebacker Bill Pellington, who owned a bar and restaurant from which Kroner was once ejected for using foul language.

<text>Rob Hubbard (born 1955) is a British composer best known for his musical and programming work for microcomputers of the 1980s, such as the Commodore 64.

==Early life and career==
Hubbard was born in 1955 in Kingston upon Hull, England. Hubbard first started playing music at age seven. Whilst at school he played in bands. After leaving school, he went to music college.

In the late seventies, before scoring games, he was a professional studio musician. He decided to teach himself BASIC and machine code for the Commodore 64.

==Music on the Commodore 64==
Hubbard subsequently wrote or converted music for a variety of publishers on over 75 games between 1985 and 1989. Some of his most popular tunes include &quot;Commando&quot;, &quot;Monty on the Run&quot;, &quot;Sanxion&quot;, &quot;International Karate&quot;, &quot;Skate or Die!&quot;, &quot;Crazy Comets&quot;, &quot;Master of Magic&quot;, &quot;Delta&quot;, &quot;Thrust&quot;, &quot;Lightforce&quot;, &quot;Spellbound&quot;, &quot;One Man and his Droid&quot;. The game &quot;Knucklebusters&quot; includes Hubbard&#x27;s longest tune: a 17-minute opus. Hubbard has mentioned his personal favourites are &quot;Sanxion&quot;, &quot;Kentilla&quot;, &quot;W.A.R.&quot;, &quot;International Karate&quot;, and &quot;Crazy Comets&quot;. His least favourite was &quot;Samantha Fox Strip Poker&quot;, which he admitted to having done purely for money; he was listed in the game credits with the alias &quot;John York&quot;. He has stated that he had many musical influences including Jean Michel Jarre, Larry Fast and other synth bands.

Hubbard mainly composed for the Commodore 64&#x27;s &quot;SID&quot; sound chip. He worked freelance and turned down offers from companies to work in-house.

==Move to Electronic Arts and the United States==
After working for several different companies, he left Newcastle in 1988 and had the choice to work for Electronic Arts or Microsoft. Hubbard chose EA due to their prominence in the gaming industry as Microsoft had (as yet) no gaming platform. His work with EA Electronic Arts in America was as a composer. He was the first person devoted to sound and music at EA and did everything from low-level programming to composing. One of his most famous compositions during his period at EA, is the music featured in the loading sequence of the &quot;Commodore 64&quot; version of &quot;Skate or Die&quot;, which features multiple sampled chords of electric guitar and organ. Playback of samples was facilitated by exploiting a feature in the SID sound-synthesizer chip: altering the volume register produces an audible click, and altering the register thousands of times per second enables a relatively crude (but surprisingly clear and sophisticated for eight-bit computers) form of sample playback.
He eventually became Audio Technical Director, a more administrative job, deciding which technologies to use in games, and which to develop further.

After the Commodore 64 period, he wrote some soundtracks for games which appeared on the Amiga, Atari ST, IBM PC and Mega Drive.

==Recent activities==
Hubbard recently contributed a few re-arrangements of his themes to Chris Abbott&#x27;s C64 tribute &quot;Back in Time Live&quot;. Hubbard has performed several times with the Danish C64 cover band PRESS PLAY ON TAPE who have covered many of his early tunes using a full rock-band arrangement. Hubbard has also performed his old music on piano with the support of violinist and fellow chiptune composer Mark Knight.

Hubbard left EA in 2002 and returned to England. He has recently resumed playing in a band, and he has revisited his past game-music work in concert. His recent compositions have included music for mobile-phone games.

In 2005, music from &quot;International Karate&quot; was performed live by a full orchestra at the third Symphonic Game Music Concert. The event took place in Leipzig, Germany. Hubbard arranged and orchestrated the piece.

In 2014, Hubbard appeared in and composed music for the documentary feature film &quot;From Bedrooms to Billions&quot;, a film that tells the story of the British video games industry.

In November 2016, Hubbard received an honorary degree from Abertay University for his contributions to video-game music in the 1980s.

<doc id="757221" wikidata="Q1334825" url="?curid=757221" title="Pelion">
<text>Pelion or Pelium (Modern , &quot;Pílio&quot;; Ancient Greek/Katharevousa: Πήλιον, &quot;Pēlion&quot;) is a mountain at the southeastern part of Thessaly in northern Greece, forming a hook-like peninsula between the Pagasetic Gulf and the Aegean Sea. Its highest summit, &quot;Pourianos Stavros&quot;, is amsl. The Greek National Road 38 (GR-38) runs through the southern portion of the peninsula and GR-38A runs through the middle.

==Geography and economy==

The mountain is thickly forested, with both deciduous and perennial forests, mainly of beech, oak, maple and chestnut trees, with olive, apple, pear trees and plane tree groves surrounding places with water. Pelion is considered one of the most beautiful mountains in Greece and is a popular tourist attraction throughout the year: hiking trails and stone paths give access to springs, coves and numerous beaches, sandy or pebbly, set among lusciously green slopes. Pelion is an amply watered mountain with an abundance of springs, gorges, streams and rivulets; many streams are routed in carved-stone artificial beds to bring water to the villages and their thriving orchards. The higher elevations of the mountain receive enough snowfall so as to host skiing facilities that operate from Christmas to Easter.

Pelian cuisine specializes in &quot;charcuterie&quot;, its most famed dish being &quot;spentzofáï&quot;, a hearty stew made of sliced pork sausage that is first cooked on its own, then stewed with green and red peppers, mild or hot as the case may be, and shallots or small onions; aubergine or tomatoes are added when seasonally available. Pelion is also renowned for its orchard fruit, with pride of place going to the &quot;firíki&quot;, an originally Egyptian apple varietal of very small, oval-shaped, intensely fragrant, crisp and slightly tart apples that withstand long storage without refrigeration. There is also wide cultivation of plums, especially mirabelles and greengages.

==Mythology==
In Greek mythology, Mount Pelion (which took its name from the mythical king Peleus, father of Achilles) was the homeland of Chiron the Centaur, tutor of many ancient Greek heroes, such as Jason, Achilles, Theseus and Heracles. On Mount Pelion, near Chiron&#x27;s cave, the marriage of Thetis and Peleus took place. The uninvited goddess Eris, to take revenge for having been kept outside the party, brought a golden apple with the inscription &quot;To the Fairest&quot;. The dispute that then arose between the goddesses Hera, Aphrodite and Athena resulted in events leading to the Trojan War.

When the twins Otus and Ephialtes attempted to storm Olympus, they piled Mount Pelion upon Mount Ossa (whence the idiom, to &quot;pile Pelion on Ossa&quot;).

==In Literature==

William Shakespeare references the mountain in Act II, scene i of The Merry Wives of Windsor: &quot;He will print them, out of doubt; for he cares not what he puts into the press, when he would put us two: I had rather be a giantess, and lie under Mount Pelion.&quot;

Herman Melville uses its mythological images in Book XXV of : &quot;You saw Enceladus the Titan, the most potent of all the giants, writhing from out the imprisoning earth;—turbaned with upborn moss he writhed; still, though armless, resisting with his whole striving trunk, the Pelion and the Ossa hurled back at him;—turbaned with upborn moss he writhed; still turning his unconquerable front toward that majestic mount eternally in vain assailed by him, and which, when it had stormed him off, had heaved his undoffable incubus upon him, and deridingly left him there to bay out his ineffectual howl.&quot;

==Recent history==

The Pelion railway, dating back to 1892–1903, was the first serious public investment in the area.
Electricity, radio and automobiles were first introduced in the 1950s except for Volos, which had those utilities from earlier times. Television arrived in the 1970s and the 1980s and computers and Internet in the late 1990s. The northern part of the Pelion mountains was struck by a forest fire (see Summer 2007 Wildfires in Greece) on June 26, 2007, which started in Siki and damaged its forests, mostly at the middle part of the mountain. The fire lasted for several days and stopped on July 1. Several villages were damaged. As of late August, however, a natural rebirth of the forest was already being noticed, with several trees gradually turning green again, as well as bushes appearing on the ground.

==Communications==
The mountain has a telecommunications tower that broadcasts radio and television including ANT1, Mega, ERT, Star Channel, Alter, TRT and more and radio including ERA, ANT1 FM and many more.

==Panorama==
A panorama from Pelion offers a views of the valley, the mountains of western Magnesia, Mount Olympus, the plain of Thessaly and its nearby mountains, Mavrovouni, Euboea, Central Greece and the northern Sporades islands. Depending on the humidity of the atmosphere, visitors can view the mountains of Agio Oros.

==Places==
Modern Pelion&#x27;s twenty-four villages retain traditional Pelian architecture and construction, with stone buildings made out of expertly carved local grey, blue, or green slate and red clay. They are built on terraces on the slopes and offer stunning vistas of the surrounding slopes and the sea. Houses are usually multi-storied and feature the characteristic Pelian oriel construction, with tall windows and abundant painted ornamentation. Pelian tradition calls for three-level houses, with the ground floor used for work (tools, kitchen, storage, washing, weaving), the middle floor used for socializing (common rooms), and the top floor for private rooms (bedrooms). Heat is provided by fireplaces, the chimneys of which run through the walls to provide heat to the upper levels, whereas the top level, being well ventilated, provides for summertime cooling. Interior construction is usually of chestnut timber, stained dark brown and often elaborately carved. Many of the larger Pelian mansions (the &quot;arkhontiká&quot; or &quot;lordly mansions&quot;) have been converted into boutique hotels and hostels. The largest of all the stone buildings, which serve as points of reference for the locals, are the Pelion Towers. These are huge 300-year-old buildings with exquisite visual characteristics that combine building elements of Mountain Pelion of the 17th, 18th and 19th century. 
Today, Mt. Pelion is part of the Magnesia regional unit (capital city: Volos) and embraces twenty-six villages including:

<doc id="757235" wikidata="Q1432934" url="?curid=757235" title="Paisley Underground">
<text>Paisley Underground is a musical genre that originated in California. It was particularly popular in Los Angeles, reaching a peak in the mid-1980s. Paisley Underground bands incorporated psychedelia, rich vocal harmonies and guitar interplay, owing a particular debt to 1960s groups such as Love and the Byrds, but more generally referencing a wide range of pop and garage rock revival.

==Etymology==
The term &quot;Paisley Underground&quot; originated in late 1982, and took root with a comment made by Michael Quercio of the band the Three O&#x27;Clock, during an interview with the &quot;LA Weekly&quot; alternative newspaper. As the event was later reported:

Quercio was close friends with Lina Sedillo who was the bass player with local punk band Peer Group, who had played on the same bill as The Salvation Army on occasion. One evening Sedillo taped Peer Group rehearsing and one of the numbers contained an improvised spoken middle section. Sedillo was wearing a red paisley dress she had bought from a thrift store and his eyes fell on the bass player and out came the line &quot;Words from the paisley underground.&quot; Sedillo noticed the phrase while playing the tape back the next day and immediately phoned up Quercio and repeated it to him. They ran a casual 60s music listening group together and thought it a cool name for them to use. When Quercio a few weeks later spontaneously dropped the phrase into an interview when asked to describe the Bangles, Rain Parade and the Three O&#x27;Clock sharing the same bill, the interviewer highlighted it in the article as a handy label for this group of bands. And so Quercio had unwittingly came up with the name of this new movement, the Paisley Underground. This is largely described by most people as the most superfluous use of words since the Bible was written.

The phrase later came to be &quot;hated by the bands it described,&quot; though Steve Wynn acknowledged that it was both harmless and helpful to have a &quot;banner&quot; over the movement.

==California scenes==
===Southern California===
Pat Thomas has described the Paisley Underground sound as a &quot;marriage of classic rock and punk.&quot; Although there were accomplished musicians among the groups, the scene was also rooted—as was the punk rock that preceded it—in an inspired amateurism described as &quot;a punk D.I.Y. ethic.&quot;

The Dream Syndicate, for example, combined influences from the Velvet Underground, Quicksilver Messenger Service, Crazy Horse, and Creedence Clearwater Revival with the energy of punk, influencing other musicians who &quot;wanted to move on from pro forma p‑rock but keep the intensity.&quot;

Green on Red came on as a cousin to the Doors; Rain Parade a melodic melding of Love, the Beatles, Big Star, and the Velvet Underground; the Long Ryders honored Gram Parsons and Buffalo Springfield; the Three O&#x27;Clock owed debt to the Bee Gees and the Monkees; the Bangles recalled the Mamas &amp; the Papas, and so on. The 1970s Memphis-based cult band Big Star, whose &quot;September Gurls&quot; was covered by the Bangles, was also influential, as were Britain&#x27;s Soft Boys. John Hoffs, best friend of David Roback and brother of Susanna Hoffs was an idea contributor to starting a unique new sound, a Paisley Underground all girl band.

Paisley Underground bands frequently shared bills, socialized, and collaborated on side projects. For example:
* Rainy Day was formed by members of Rain Parade, the Bangles, the Dream Syndicate and the Three O&#x27;Clock, who joined to release an eponymous album of cover versions of songs by the Velvet Underground, Buffalo Springfield, Bob Dylan, the Beach Boys, Big Star, Jimi Hendrix, and the Who.
* Danny &amp; Dusty, a duo formed by Steve Wynn of the Dream Syndicate and Dan Stuart of Green on Red, made the album &quot;The Lost Weekend&quot; in 1985, backed by members of both bands along with most of the Long Ryders.
* Clay Allison was an offshoot band composed of David Roback and Will Glenn of Rain Parade, Kendra Smith of Dream Syndicate, Sylvia Juncosa of the Leaving Trains, and Keith Mitchell of Monitor.
* Opal was adopted as a new name for Clay Allison in 1984, prior to the release of their &quot;Fell from the Sun&quot; EP.
In 1986, the Rain Parade were the first of the Paisley Underground bands to break up, followed by the Long Ryders in 1987, the Three O&#x27;Clock in 1988, the Dream Syndicate and the Bangles in 1989, and Green on Red in 1992.

===Sacramento and Davis===
Even before the Los Angeles-based Paisley Underground took shape, the Sacramento/Davis area of Northern California was an early focus of Paisley Underground bands and musicians, some of whom later moved to Los Angeles.

The Suspects were a Davis-based predecessor to Dream Syndicate, formed in 1979 by guitarist Steve Wynn and bassist Kendra Smith (who were both disc jockeys at college radio station KDVS at the time), with Russ Tolman on lead guitar and Gavin Blair on drums. They released one single in 1979, and performed in the Davis area through 1981. When Wynn and Smith left for Los Angeles in 1981 and formed Dream Syndicate, Tolman and Blair remained in Davis and started up True West.

During a brief period in 1981 between leaving the Suspects and forming Dream Syndicate, Wynn also formed the short-lived band 15 Minutes in Davis, with members of Alternate Learning. Their only single, &quot;That&#x27;s What You Always Say&quot;, was later re-recorded by Dream Syndicate for their 1982 album &quot;The Days of Wine and Roses&quot;.

Game Theory and Thin White Rope, which were both formed in Davis in 1981–82, also &quot;fit in well with the other Paisley Underground bands that started up around the same time.&quot; For example, the Three O&#x27;Clock&#x27;s Michael Quercio produced Game Theory&#x27;s 1984 &quot;Distortion&quot; EP, also contributing backup vocals. Quercio appeared as a guest on several more Game Theory albums, ultimately joining as a member in 1989, after the breakup of the Three O&#x27;Clock.

Quercio and Game Theory frontman Scott Miller co-wrote &quot;The Girl with the Guitar (Says Oh Yeah)&quot;, a Paisley song described as timeless and poignant, which first appeared on the Three O&#x27;Clock&#x27;s &quot;Arrive Without Travelling&quot;. Live and studio performances of the Game Theory version, titled &quot;Girl w/ a Guitar&quot;, appeared as CD bonus tracks on the 1993 reissue of Game Theory&#x27;s &quot;The Big Shot Chronicles&quot; and the 2014 reissue of &quot;Real Nighttime&quot;.

The band 28th Day, formed in 1982 in Chico, California (a small college town about one hour north of Davis), was also part of the Paisley Underground. 28th Day consisted of Barbara Manning (bass, vocals), Cole Marquis (guitar, vocals), and Mike Cloward (drums). Their first EP was produced by True West&#x27;s Russ Tolman and released on his Bring Out Your Dead label.

==Related scenes==
The Paisley Underground movement was paralleled in other parts of the world by genres such as New Zealand&#x27;s Dunedin sound, whose chief exponents (such as the Chills and Sneaky Feelings) were often cited as directly comparable to Paisley Underground bands. A related genre of 1980s guitar rock is named jangle pop after the ringing, light guitar sounds, such as those of R.E.M., that also often featured in Paisley Underground music.

==Legacy and influence==
Although many of the Paisley Underground groups released at least one album on a major label, by far the most commercially successful band to emerge from the movement was the Bangles, who had several mainstream hits in the 1980s, reaching number 1 in the United States with the single &quot;Walk Like an Egyptian&quot; in 1986.

The movement&#x27;s influence on 1980s contemporaries, such as English bands The Teardrop Explodes and Echo &amp; the Bunnymen, and Seattle&#x27;s The Green Pajamas, has been noted. In the mid-1980s, Prince was notably influenced by the Paisley Underground sound: not only did his 1985 album &quot;Around the World in a Day&quot; have a more psychedelic sound than any of his previous or future work, but he also named his record label (Paisley Park Records) after the movement, wrote &quot;Manic Monday&quot; for the Bangles, and signed the Three O&#x27;Clock to his label.

As the Paisley Underground bands of the 1980s broke up, some of their members came together in new combinations which continued to record through the 1990s and later:
* Viva Saturn was formed in 1989 by Steven Roback, with fellow Rain Parade alumni John Thoman and Will Glenn. Glenn later joined Mazzy Star, and was replaced by another former Rain Parade member, Matt Piucci.
* Continental Drifters, formed in 1991, included Mark Walton of the Dream Syndicate and Vicki Peterson of the Bangles. The band was originally active through 2001, and has reunited in 2009 and 2015.
* Mazzy Star evolved from Opal in 1989 when Kendra Smith was replaced by Hope Sandoval. Their fourth studio album, &quot;Seasons of Your Day&quot;, was released in 2013.
Other currently active recording artists who are cited as influenced by the Paisley Underground include the Allah-Las, Exploding Flowers, Mercury Rev, The Gentle Cycle (led by latter Rain Parade member Derek See), and Grandaddy.

In 2005, Rhino released &quot;Children of Nuggets: Original Artyfacts from the Second Psychedelic Era, 1976–1995&quot;, a four-CD box set which anthologized many Paisley Underground and related bands. The title referred to the original 1972 compilation &quot;&quot;, whose music influenced the bands featured on &quot;Children of Nuggets&quot;.

==Revival and band reunions==
True West did a number of reunion shows in the years 2006 through 2009, including a few shows with Violent Femmes, including at The Fillmore in San Francisco. True West also played the Down On The Farm festival in Norway in 2009.

2013 saw a series of reunions among the original Paisley Underground bands. After 25 years of turning down reunion offers, the Three O&#x27;Clock reformed after being presented with a chance to play at the 2013 Coachella Festival. Michael Quercio (vocals/bass), Louis Gutierrez (guitars), and Danny Benair (drums) were joined by new recruit Adam Merrin (keyboards). The group played both weekends of Coachella, appeared on the late-night talk show &quot;Conan&quot;, embarked on a brief concert tour, and released several archival recordings.

In December 2013, four reunited Paisley Underground bands – the Bangles, the Three O&#x27;Clock, Dream Syndicate, and Rain Parade – played a concert together at The Fillmore in San Francisco, followed by a benefit concert at The Fonda Theatre the next evening in Los Angeles.

In late 2018 the four bands collaborated on a Yep Roc Records album, &quot;3 x 4,&quot; where each of the four bands performed one song each that had been originated by each of the three other bands.

<text>Plastic mulch is a product used in plasticulture in a similar fashion to mulch, to suppress weeds and conserve water in crop production and landscaping. Certain plastic mulches also act as a barrier to keep methyl bromide, both a powerful fumigant and ozone depleter, in the soil. Crops grow through slits or holes in thin plastic sheeting. Plastic mulch is often used in conjunction with drip irrigation. Some research has been done using different colors of mulch to affect crop growth. Use of plastic mulch is predominant in large-scale vegetable growing, with millions of acres cultivated under plastic mulch worldwide each year.

Disposal of plastic mulch is an environmental problem. Technologies exist to provide for the recycling of used/disposed plastic mulch into viable plastic resins for re-use in the plastics manufacturing industry. However these methods are not very effective due to contamination by agrochemicals of the plastic. Other concerns include residual microplastics in the soil which can have negative effects on soil ecologies, including microbes and earthworms.

==History==
The idea of using polyethylene film as mulch in plant production saw its beginnings in the mid-1950s. Dr. Emery M. Emmert of the University of Kentucky was one of the first to recognize the benefits of using LDPE (low-density polyethylene) and HDPE (high-density polyethylene) film as mulch in vegetable production. Emmert also wrote on other topics such as the use of plastic for greenhouses instead of glass and plastic in field high tunnels. Approximately of agricultural land utilize polyethylene mulch and similar row covers for crop production in the world.
Laying plastic polythene (mulch) down over mounds formed in the soil was also pioneered in New Zealand in the mid fifties by strawberry growers in the Auckland area.
By 1960-61 all strawberries grown commercially in New Zealand were grown through black polythene usually laid by hand. The plastic promoted growth, conserved moisture brought on early fruiting and restricted weed infestation.
The earliest polythene laying machines were in use in New Zealand by the mid 1960s and were very similar to the machines sold today. The very first machines were designed by growers and built by small engineering/fabrication workshops, usually under the careful guidance and supervision of the farmer. Each machine for many years was generally similar to the last, with the occasional modification to improve performance.

==Benefits==
The use of plastic mulches along with the use of drip irrigation has many benefits such as:

===Soil temperature===
The use of plastic mulch alters soil temperature. Dark mulches and clear mulches applied to the soil intercept sunlight and warm the soil, allowing earlier planting as well as encouraging faster growth early in the growing season. White mulch reflects heat from the sun, effectively reducing soil temperature. This reduction in temperature may help establish plants in mid-summer when cooler soil might be required.

===Soil moisture retention===
Plastic mulches reduce the amount of water lost from the soil due to evaporation. This means less water will be needed for irrigation. Plastic mulches also aid in evenly distributing moisture to the soil, which reduces plant stress.

===Weed management===
Plastic mulches prevent sunlight from reaching the soil which can inhibit most annual and perennial weeds. Clear plastics prevent weed growth. Holes in the mulch for plants tend to be the only pathway for weeds to grow.

===Reduction in the leaching of fertilizer===
The use of drip irrigation in conjunction with plastic mulch allows one to reduce leaching of fertilizers. Using drip irrigation eliminates the use of flood and furrow irrigation that applies large quantities of water to the soil, which in turn tends to leach nitrogen and other nutrients to depths below the root zone. Drip irrigation applies lower amounts of water with fertilizers injected and thus these fertilizers are applied to the root zone as needed. This also reduces the amount of fertilizer needed for adequate plant growth when compared to broadcast fertilization.

===Improved crop quality===
Plastic mulches keep ripening fruits off of the soil. This reduced contact with the soil decreases fruit rot as well as keeps the fruit and vegetables clean. This is beneficial for the production of strawberries, for example.

===Reduction in soil compaction===

The plastic mulch covering the soil decreases the crusting effect of rain and sunlight. The reduction in weed quantity means a decreased need for mechanical cultivation. Weed control between beds of plastic can be done using directly applied herbicides and through mechanical means. The soil underneath the plastic mulch stays loose and well aerated, with the mulch protecting the soil it covers from erosion.

===Reduction in root damage===
The use of plastic mulch creates a practically weed-free area around the plant, removing the need for cultivation except between the rows of plastic. Root damage associated with cultivation is therefore eliminated. Due to these factors, the use of plastic mulch can lead to an improvement in the overall growth of the plant.

==Disadvantages==
There are many disadvantages to using plastic mulches in crop production as well.

===Cost===
The benefits from using plastic mulch come at a higher cost than planting in bare soil. These costs include equipment, the plastic film used as the mulch, transplanters designed for plastic beds, and additional labor during installation and removal of mulch films. Specialized mulch application equipment must be used to install plastic mulch beds into a field. These machines shape the soil and apply the plastic to the prepared soil. Transplanters designed for plastic mulch can be used to plant the desired crop. Hand transplanting is an option, but this is rather inefficient. The removal of plastic mulch also contributes to a higher cost through additional labor and equipment needed. Specialized designed undercutting equipment can be used to remove the plastic from the field after harvest.

===Environmental concerns===

If conventional plastics (e.g. PE) are used as mulch films, they are likely to accumulate in soil, since the removal and the correct disposal of these plastics are technically and economically burdensome. This accumulation could cause both crop yield reduction and environmental problems.
Biodegradable polymers are polymers that can be degraded by the naturally occurring microbial community in an environmental system. They provide a more sustainable alternative to conventionally used plastics for mulch films. Providing the same benefits as detailed above, the problem of plastic accumulation in soils could be solved. Aliphatic polyesters and aliphatic-aromatic co-polyesters have shown to be promising groups of biodegradable polymers.

==Application==

The use of plastic mulch requires a unique application process to ensure proper placement of the plastic film. This application process begins with preparing the field the same way one would for a flat seed bed. The bed must be free of large soil clods and organic residue. A machine called a plastic layer or a bed shaper is pulled over the field creating a row of plastic mulch covering a planting bed. These beds can be a flat bed which simply means the surface of the plastic mulch is level with the inter-row soil surface. Machines that form raised beds create a plastic surface higher than the inter-row soil surface. The basic concept of the plastic bed shaper is a shaping box which creates the bed, that is then covered by plastic via a roller and two coulters that cover the edges of the plastic film to hold the plastic the soil&#x27;s surface. These plastic layers also place the drip irrigation line under the plastic while the machine lays the plastic. It is somewhat important that the plastic is rather tight. This becomes important in the planting process.

==Planting==
Planting also requires specialized planting equipment. The most common planting equipment is a waterwheel type transplanter. The waterwheel transplanter utilizes a rotating drum or drums with spikes at set intervals. The drum or drums have a water supply that continuously fills the drum with water. The transplanter rolls the spiked drum over the bed of plastic. As the drum presses a spike into the plastic, a hole is punched and water flows into the punched hole. A rider on the transplanter can then place a plant in the hole. These drums can have multiple rows and varied intervals to create the desired spacing for that particular crop.

<text>The Jastorf culture was an Iron Age material culture in what is now Germany, stretching north into Jutland, and east into Poland, spanning the 6th to 1st centuries BC, forming the southern part of the Pre-Roman Iron Age.

==Periodization (Central European culture counterpart)==
*6th century BC, Jastorf A (Hallstatt D)
*5th century BC, Jastorf B (La Tène A)
*400–350 BC, Jastorf C (La Tène B)
*350–120 BC, Ripdorf (La Tène C)
*120–1 BC, Seedorf (La Tène D)

==Culture==

The Jastorf culture is named after a site near the village of Jastorf, Lower Saxony (). It was characterized by its use of cremation burials in extensive urnfields and links with the practices of the Northern Bronze Age. Archeology offers evidence concerning the crystallization of a group in terms of a shared material culture, in which the Northern Bronze Age continued to exert cultural influence on the Celtic Hallstatt culture in the southern parts of the area.

The Jastorf culture extended south to the northern fringes of the Hallstatt culture, while towards the north a general congruence with the late phases of the Northern Bronze Age can be noted. Gravefields in today&#x27;s Schleswig-Holstein, Mecklenburg, western Pomerania, in Brandenburg and in Lower Saxony show continuity of occupation from the Bronze Age far into the Jastorf period and beyond. The specific contributions from the various quarters witnessing the meeting of Celtic and indigenous cultures during the early periods can not be assessed by the present state of knowledge, although a shift to a northern focus has been noted to accompany the dwindling vitality of continental Celtic cultures later on.

The Jastorf culture&#x27;s area was first restricted to what is today northern Lower Saxony and Schleswig-Holstein. It then developed a &quot;very expansive&quot; character (Wolfram 1999), expanding towards the Harz hills and reaching by about 500 BC Thuringia, Lower Silesia, and the lower Rhine region, thus covering the southern and western parts of Lower Saxony. This was helped or propitiated by the earlier vacancy or large depopulation of these areas, as it became known in the archaeological record and from Classic sources that local Hallstatt Culture groups considered Celtic or Belgian (more or less Celtic) migrated in its D period to extensive areas further West and South as far as the Mediterranean and Atlantic Europe. In its mature phase, the Jastorf area proper in northern Lower Saxony (Lüneburger Heide, lower Elbe) can be contrasted with the so-called Nienburg (also Harpstedt-Nienburg) group to the west, situated along the Aller and the middle Weser rivers, bordering the Nordwestblock separating it from the La Tène culture proper farther south. The Nienburg group has characteristics of material culture closer to Celtic cultures, and shows evidence of significant contact with the Hallstadt and La Tène cultures. Isolated finds are scattered as far as Berlin and Mecklenburg-Vorpommern.

Finds are mostly from tumuli, flat graves and Brandgruben graves or cremation pits. There are few and modest grave goods, with the weapon deposits characteristic of migration period graves completely absent.

The southernmost extent of Germanic cultures beyond Jastorf has recently been accounted for at the final stages of the Pre-Roman Iron Age, with the paucity of Late-La Téne bracelet-types in Thuringia and northeastern Hesse proposed to suggest population movements between the central-Elbe/Saale region, Main-Franconia and the edge of the Alps and to have been triggered by the spread of the Przeworsk culture. The demographic vacuum left in the south of Germany around the upper Danube and Rhine rivers, by the migrations of Celtic groups hitherto there into much richer lands in Gaul, Spain, Pannonia and Northern Italy from 400 BC probably also played a role.

==Legacy==
The cultures of the Pre-Roman Iron Age are hypothesized to be the origin of the Germanic languages. Herwig Wolfram locates the initial stages of Grimm&#x27;s Law here.

<doc id="757254" wikidata="Q746694" url="?curid=757254" title="Drip irrigation">
<text>Drip irrigation or trickle irrigation is a type of micro-irrigation system that has the potential to save water and nutrients by allowing water to drip slowly to the roots of plants, either from above the soil surface or buried below the surface. The goal is to place water directly into the root zone and minimize evaporation. Drip irrigation systems distribute water through a network of valves, pipes, tubing, and emitters. Depending on how well designed, installed, maintained, and operated it is, a drip irrigation system can be more efficient than other types of irrigation systems, such as surface irrigation or sprinkler irrigation.

As of 2023, 3% of the world&#x27;s farmers use drip irrigation.

==History==
===Ancient China===
Primitive drip irrigation has been used since ancient times. &quot;Fan Shengzhi shu&quot;, written in China during the first century BCE, describes the use of buried, unglazed clay pots filled with water, sometimes referred to as Ollas, as a means of irrigation.

===Modern development===
====Subsurface pipe====
Modern drip irrigation began its development in Germany in 1860 when researchers began experimenting with subsurface irrigation using clay pipe to create combination irrigation and drainage systems.

====Perforated pipe====
The research was later expanded in the 1920s to include the application of perforated pipe systems.

====Plastic====
The usage of plastic to hold and distribute water in drip irrigation was later developed in Australia by Hannis Thill.

====Plastic emitter, trickle irrigation====
Usage of a plastic emitter in drip irrigation was developed in Israel by Simcha Blass and his son Yeshayahu. Instead of releasing water through tiny holes easily blocked by tiny particles, water was released through larger and longer passageways by using friction to slow water inside a plastic emitter. The first experimental system of this type was established in 1959 by Blass, who partnered later (1964) with Kibbutz Hatzerim to create an irrigation company called Netafim. Together they developed and patented the first practical surface drip irrigation emitter. Modern drip irrigation was invented in Israel in the 1960s, such irrigation also improved the efficiency of fertilizer use as well as water. The introduction of this technology was revolutionary according to the Times of Israel and could save 70% of water usage in the growth of rice.

Goldberg and Shmueli (1970) developed a significant improvement: &quot;in the Arava desert in southern Israel [Shmueli] demonstrated that a trickle-irrigation system installed on the soil surface worked exceptionally well in producing vegetable crops, even with saline water (Elfving, 1989). The system...was responsible for the greening of formerly unproductive environment&quot;.

Replacing sub-surface system with on surface system solved the disadvantage of clogging the subsurface system. Their improvement prevailed: &quot;Drip irrigation is presently the most efficient means to apply water to crops (Pathak et al. 2009; Goyal 2012)... There are two variations of the technology: surface and subsurface. The most common is surface drip irrigation, first developed in Israel (Goldberg and Shmueli 1970)... Due to the need to improve irrigation efficiency, as a measure toward sustainable use of water resources, there is wide interest in drip irrigation (Scanlon et al. 2012; Steward et al. 2013; Schaible and Aillery 2017) and is highlighted by numerous studies to evaluate its performance for the production of several crops.&quot;

Netafim developed technology to specifically water rice. Rice paddies which produce 10% of global methane emissions, the equivalent of 400 million cars. This technology was first introduced in Italy, Turkey and India. Agritech firm N-Drip developed smart drip irrigation for rice paddies. In the TOI article it was reported that N-Drip system led to yield increases of up to 33%, fertilizer reduction of 50%, a drop in greenhouse gases like carbon and methane from 50% to 85% as well as water savings of 50%.

====Drip tape====
In the United States, the first drip tape, called &quot;Dew Hose&quot;, was developed by Richard Chapin and Jaime Leal-Diaz of Chapin Watermatics in the early 1960s. The evolution of drip tape which made large-scale adoption and use possible was the introduction of T-Tape in 1987 by Plastro Irrigation, that had the first slit outlet and a laminar flow track which later evolved into a turbulent flow regulating flow track. Chapin Watermatics was acquired by Jain Irrigation in 2006 and is housed under its US subsidiary Jain Irrigation Inc, USA.

First introduced in California in the late 1960s, only 5% of irrigated land used this system as of 1988. By 2010, 40% of irrigated land in California used this system.

====Trickle ring====

A trickle ring is a circular device which evenly distributes water around the base of a tree or shrub. Connected to a water supply by a garden hose or tubing adapter fitting, trickle rings may be integrated into an irrigation network which waters many plants at the same time. By regulating the flow of water through the trickle ring, soil can be saturated at a rate which conserves water by minimizing wasteful surface runoff and losses due to evaporation.

==Significance==
Modern drip irrigation has arguably become the world&#x27;s most valued innovation in agriculture since the invention in the 1930s of the impact sprinkler, which offered the first practical alternative to surface irrigation. 

==Current developments==
Careful study of all the relevant factors like land topography, soil, water, crop and agro-climatic conditions are needed to determine the most suitable drip irrigation system and components to be used in a specific installation.

===Micro-spray heads===
Drip irrigation may also use devices called micro-spray heads, which spray water in a small area, instead of dripping emitters. These are generally used on tree and vine crops with wider root zones.

===Subsurface drip irrigation===
Subsurface drip irrigation (SDI) uses permanently or temporarily buried dripperline or drip tape located at or below the plant roots. It is becoming popular for row crop irrigation, especially in areas where water supplies are limited, or recycled water is used for irrigation.

==Global reach and market leaders==
As of 2012, China and India were the fastest expanding countries in the field of drip- or other micro-irrigation, while worldwide well over ten million hectares used these technologies. Still, this amounted to less than 4 percent of the world&#x27;s irrigated land. That year, Israel&#x27;s Netafim was the global market leader (a position it maintained in 2018), with India&#x27;s Jain Irrigation being the second-biggest micro-irrigation company. In 2017 Rivulis bought Eurodrip and became the world&#x27;s second largest irrigation systems manufacturer.

==Components and operation==


Components used in drip irrigation (listed in order from water source) include:
* Pump or pressurized water source
* Water filter(s) or filtration systems: sand separator, Fertigation systems (Venturi injector) and chemigation equipment (optional)
* Backwash controller (backflow prevention device)
* Pressure control valve (pressure regulator)
* Distribution lines (main larger diameter pipe, maybe secondary smaller, pipe fittings)
* Hand-operated, electronic, or hydraulic control valves and safety valves
* Smaller diameter polyethylene tube (often called &quot;laterals&quot;)
* Poly fittings and accessories (to make connections)
* Emitting devices at plants (emitter or dripper, micro spray head, inline dripper or inline drip tube)

In drip irrigation systems, pump and valves may be manually or automatically operated by a controller.

Most large drip irrigation systems employ some type of filter to prevent clogging of the small emitter flow path by small waterborne particles. New technologies are now being offered that minimize clogging. Some residential systems are installed without additional filters since potable water is already filtered at the water treatment plant. Virtually all drip irrigation equipment manufacturers recommend that filters be employed and generally will not honor warranties unless this is done. Last line filters just before the final delivery pipe are strongly recommended in addition to any other filtration system due to fine particle settlement and accidental insertion of particles in the intermediate lines.

Drip and subsurface drip irrigation is used almost exclusively when using recycled municipal wastewater. Regulations typically do not permit spraying water through the air that has not been fully treated to potable water standards.

Because of the way the water is applied in a drip system, traditional surface applications of timed-release fertilizer are sometimes ineffective, so drip systems often mix liquid fertilizer with the irrigation water. This is called fertigation; fertigation and chemigation (application of pesticides and other chemicals to periodically clean out the system, such as chlorine or sulfuric acid) use chemical injectors such as diaphragm pumps, piston pumps, or aspirators. The chemicals may be added constantly whenever the system is irrigating or at intervals. Fertilizer savings of up to 95% are being reported from recent university field tests using drip fertigation and slow water delivery as compared to timed-release and irrigation by micro spray heads.

Properly designed, installed, and managed, drip irrigation may help achieve water conservation by reducing evaporation and deep drainage when compared to other types of irrigation such as flood or overhead sprinklers since water can be more precisely applied to the plant roots. In addition, drip can eliminate many diseases that are spread through water contact with the foliage. Finally, in regions where water supplies are severely limited, there may be no actual water savings, but rather simply an increase in production while using the same amount of water as before. In very arid regions or on sandy soils, the preferred method is to apply the irrigation water as slowly as possible.

Pulsed irrigation is sometimes used to decrease the amount of water delivered to the plant at any one time, thus reducing runoff or deep percolation. Pulsed systems are typically expensive and require extensive maintenance. Therefore, the latest efforts by emitter manufacturers are focused on developing new technologies that deliver irrigation water at ultra-low flow rates, i.e. less than per hour. Slow-and-even delivery further improves water use efficiency without incurring the expense and complexity of pulsed delivery equipment.

An emitting pipe is a type of drip irrigation tubing with emitters pre-installed at the factory with specific distance and flow per hour as per crop distance.

An emitter restricts water flow passage through it, thus creating head loss required (to the extent of atmospheric pressure) to emit water in the form of droplets. This head loss is achieved by friction/turbulence within the emitter.

==Advantages and disadvantages==


The advantages of drip irrigation are:
* Fertilizer and nutrient loss is minimized due to a localized application and reduced leaching.
* Water application efficiency is high if managed correctly.
* Field leveling is not necessary.
* Fields with irregular shapes are easily accommodated.
* Recycled non-potable water can be safely used.
* Moisture within the root zone can be maintained at field capacity.
* Soil type plays a less important role in the frequency of irrigation.
* Soil erosion is lessened.
* Weed growth is lessened.
* Water distribution is highly uniform, controlled by the output of each nozzle.
* Labour cost is less than other irrigation methods.
* Variation in supply can be regulated by regulating the valves and drippers.
* Fertigation can easily be included with minimal waste of fertilizers.
* Foliage remains dry, reducing the risk of disease.
* Usually operated at lower pressure than other types of pressurized irrigation, reducing energy costs.
The disadvantages of drip irrigation are:
* Initial cost can be more than overhead systems. Ongoing capital costs related to replacing and maintaining the tubes can exceed water savings if the system improperly designed and set up. Drip irrigation may also be more labor intensive, especially if there is extensive crop rotation necessitating seasonal replacement of drip tubing to accommodate different row spacings.
* The sun can affect the tubes used for drip irrigation, shortening their lifespan. (See Polymer degradation);
* The risks of degrading plastic affecting the soil content and food crops. With many types of plastic, when the sun degrades the plastic, causing it to become brittle, the estrogenic chemicals (that is, chemicals replicating female hormones) which would cause the plastic to retain flexibility have been released into the surrounding environment.
* If the water is not properly filtered and the equipment not properly maintained, it can result in clogging or bioclogging.
* For subsurface drip the irrigator cannot see the water that is applied. This may lead to the farmer either applying too much water (low efficiency) or an insufficient amount of water, this is particularly common for those with less experience with drip irrigation.
* Drip irrigation might be unsatisfactory if herbicides or top dressed fertilizers need sprinkler irrigation for activation.
* Drip tape causes extra cleanup costs after harvest. Users need to plan for drip tape winding, disposal, recycling or reuse.
* Waste of water, time and harvest, if not installed properly. These systems require careful study of all the relevant factors like land topography, soil, water, crop and agro-climatic conditions, and suitability of drip irrigation system and its components.
* In lighter soils subsurface drip may be unable to wet the soil surface for germination. Requires careful consideration of the installation depth.
* Most drip systems are designed for high efficiency, meaning little or no leaching fraction. Without sufficient leaching, salts applied with the irrigation water may build up in the root zone, usually at the edge of the wetting pattern. On the other hand, drip irrigation avoids the high capillary potential of traditional surface-applied irrigation, which can draw salt deposits up from deposits below.
* The PVC pipes often suffer from rodent damage, requiring replacement of the entire tube and increasing expenses.
* Drip irrigation systems cannot be used for damage control by night frosts (like in the case of sprinkler irrigation systems)

==Drip tape==

Drip tape is a type of thin-walled dripper line used in drip irrigation. The first drip tape was known as &quot;Dew Hose&quot;.

Drip tape duct tape is made of polyethylene and sold flat on reels. The wall thickness typically ranges from . Thicker-walled tapes are commonly used for permanent subsurface drip irrigation, and thinner-walled tapes for temporary throw-away systems in high-value crops.

Water exits from tape through emitters or drippers. The typical emitter spacing ranges from . In some products, the emitters are manufactured simultaneously with the tape and formed as part of the product. In others, the emitters are manufactured separately and installed during production.

Some products are not tape but a thin-walled dripper line, but in popular parlance, both types of products are called tapes. Typical tape diameters are , , and , with the larger diameters more commonly used on permanent installations with longer runs.

Drip tape is a recyclable material and can be recycled into viable plastic resins for reuse in the plastics manufacturing industry.

== Uses ==
Drip irrigation is used in farms, commercial greenhouses, and residential gardens. Drip irrigation is adopted extensively in areas of acute water scarcity and especially for crops and trees such as coconuts, containerized landscape trees, grapes, bananas, ber, eggplant, citrus, strawberries, sugarcane, cotton, maize, and tomatoes.

Drip irrigation kits for home gardens are increasingly popular for homeowners and consist of a timer, hose, and emitter. Hoses that are in diameter are used to irrigate flower pots.

<doc id="757256" wikidata="Q3519780" url="?curid=757256" title="The Ancient Art of War">
<text>The Ancient Art of War is a computer wargame designed by Dave and Barry Murry of Evryware and published by Broderbund in 1984. It is one of the first real-time strategy or real-time tactics games.

==Gameplay==
A battlefield simulation, the game&#x27;s title comes from the classic strategy text &quot;The Art of War&quot; written by Sun Tzu around 400 B.C.

The objective of the game is to win a series of battles using four types of troops: Knights, Archers, Barbarians, and Spies. All four types are unmounted.

It uses a rock paper scissors type of unit balance typical of the genre. Knights beat barbarians in melee; barbarians have the advantage over archers; and archers have the advantage over knights, in addition to being effective at defending against attempts to storm a fort. Spies do not fight, but they can see enemy units twice as far away as anyone else and are the fastest-moving units in the game.

At the start of the game, the player is able to select from a list of eleven campaigns to play. The campaigns include both skirmishes and capture the flags style missions, while the terrain layout and initial starting units provided a variety of strategic options for game play. Advanced rule sets such as &quot;Training New Units&quot; and &quot;Supply Line Lengths&quot; allow for more customization. The player can also select from among several AI opponents represented by various historical figures such as Geronimo and Sun Tzu himself. Sun Tzu represents the most difficult level. These settings affected both AI behavior, as well as certain properties such as the speed at which enemy units moved through difficult terrain.

The game does not feature any economy management element (mining, gathering or construction), a common feature of later real-time strategy games.

===Tactics===
Each mission takes place on a map containing forts, towns, terrain features (bridges, mountains, forests, etc.), and squads. Squads can consist of up to 14 units, made up of any combination of the four unit types. A squad moves at the speed of its slowest unit (Barbarians are faster than Archers, which are faster than Knights), so a squad of all Barbarians would move faster than a mixed squad.

Squads that lose units have to make do until another squad can be merged with them. In many campaigns, squads with less than 14 units can receive random reinforcements by waiting at a fort.

When two enemy squads meet on the battlefield, they are frozen in an encounter while time continues to pass. If they are left by themselves, then, after a delay, the computer will automatically determine the outcome of the battle. Alternately, the player can choose to &quot;Zoom&quot; into the battle to resolve it immediately, gaining limited command of the soldiers in battle. It may be advantageous to leave squads in an encounter while others squads run past the enemy squad so engaged. Formations can be chosen to take advantage of a squad&#x27;s particular makeup. For example, all of a squad&#x27;s Archers can be placed in the rear while the Barbarians form a line in the front. The game supported per-type orders during battle, so one could alternately place archers upfront with a gap; put knights within the gap; order the archers to fire while the knights hold; then order the archers to fall back while the knights attacked. One could not order individual soldiers, however.

Formations only affected the tactical battles; only whole squads were ever represented on the strategic map, not individual soldiers.

A number of factors influence the outcome of a battle and elevate the game beyond a simple rock-paper-scissors strategy. Hunger, distance, terrain, and morale all affect the squads&#x27; effectiveness. Care has to be taken when marching troops full speed, or across a series of mountains, to prevent them from arriving at a battle too fatigued to fight. In addition, even the winning side in a battle suffers a slight reduction in the squad&#x27;s readiness. Troops in a poor condition fight poorly, might retreat without being ordered to do so, and could even potentially surrender outright if significantly outnumbered. Hunger is modeled through an abstract &#x27;supply&#x27; value per squad; villages and/or forts slowly replenish the supplies of nearby friendly squads. A squad that runs out of supplies diminishes in vigor and might be destroyed by what would otherwise be an inferior force.

One of the limitations of the game engine was that it could only display a certain number of units total at any time. This led some players to force the computer into having fewer (though stronger) units and thus easier to evade by creating an army of weak units.

===Editing===
The game allows players to create their own maps, formations, and missions.

The map editor provides a fixed palette of identically-sized tiles with a variety of terrain features, with which one can fill in the details on a fixed-size rectangular map. The severity of certain terrain features, such as whether moving through mountains is merely slow or potentially deadly, is controlled at game time with options, not via a property of the map.

The formation editor allows the player to configure templates for arranging squads according to the three combat troop types; there are a fixed number of slots for formations, which can then be chosen in-game.

The campaign editor controls the positioning and composition of squads on both sides, their initial condition and supply levels, the location of flags, the default opponent, and the mission briefing, including settings such as how treacherous the terrain is. Flags and squads must belong to one side or the other, as during the game. The flags positions can be randomized; if either side does not have at least one flag assigned to them in a specific location, they receive a single randomly located flag when the mission was played. This location changes every time the mission is restarted.

==Development==
&quot;The Ancient Art of War&quot; was designed by Dave and Barry Murry. It was originally released in December 1984 for MS-DOS and Apple II, and was made available for Macintosh in 1987.

==Reception==
In 1985 &quot;Computer Gaming World&quot; praised &quot;The Ancient Art of War&quot; as a great war game, especially the ability to create custom scenarios, stating that for pre-gunpowder
warfare it &quot;should allow you to recreate most engagements&quot;. In 1987 it stated that the game and its sequel &quot;are excellent war games and provide many hours of high grade entertainment&quot;. In 1990 the magazine gave the game three out of five stars, and in 1993 two stars. Jerry Pournelle of &quot;BYTE&quot; named &quot;The Ancient Art of War&quot; his game of the month for February 1986, reporting that his sons &quot;say (and I confirm from my own experience) is about the best strategic computer war game they&#x27;ve encountered ... Highly recommended&quot;. &quot;PC Magazine&quot; in 1988 called the game &quot;educational and entertaining&quot;.

Lisa Stevens reviewed the Macintosh version &quot;The Ancient Art of War&quot; in &quot;White Wolf&quot; #28 (Aug./Sept., 1991), rating it a 5 out of 5 and stated that &quot;In summary, &quot;The Ancient Art of War&quot; is a wargame that even a nonwargamer can&#x27;t help but like. It provides enough strategy to make it challenging, but enough great graphics to make it exciting. All in all, a great software package.&quot;

&quot;Macworld&quot; inducted the Macintosh version of &quot;The Ancient Art of War&quot; into the 1986 &quot;Macworld&quot; Game Hall of Fame in the Best Strategy Game category, ahead of runner-up &quot;Balance of Power&quot;. &quot;Macworld&quot; praised the game&#x27;s clear graphics that made complex movements comprehensible, the movie-style combat scenes, the quality packaging, and the editing tools.

==Legacy==
&quot;The Ancient Art of War&quot; is generally recognized as one of the first real-time strategy or real-time tactics games, a genre which became hugely popular a decade later with &quot;Dune II&quot; and &quot;Warcraft&quot;. Those later games added an element of economic management, with mining or gathering, as well as construction and base management, to the purely military.

&quot;The Ancient Art of War&quot; is cited as a classic example of a video game that uses a rock-paper-scissors design with its three combat units, archer, knight, and barbarian, as a way to balance gameplay strategies.

GameSpy ranked &quot;The Ancient Art of War&quot; No. 10 in its greatest PC games of the 1980s.

It spawned two sequels, the naval-themed &quot;The Ancient Art of War at Sea&quot; (1987) and the World War I game &quot;The Ancient Art of War in the Skies&quot; (1992). A new version called &quot;The Ancient Art of War 2&quot; is now available for PCs and mobile devices.

<text>Gerard James Butler (born 13 November 1969) is a Scottish actor and film producer. After studying law, he turned to acting in the mid-1990s with small roles in productions such as &quot;Mrs Brown&quot; (1997), the James Bond film &quot;Tomorrow Never Dies&quot; (1997), and &quot;Tale of the Mummy&quot; (1998). In 2000, he starred as Count Dracula in the gothic horror film &quot;Dracula 2000&quot;. He played Attila the Hun in the miniseries &quot;Attila&quot; (2001), then appeared in the films &quot;Reign of Fire&quot; (2002) and &quot;Lara Croft: Tomb Raider – The Cradle of Life&quot; (2003) before starring in the science fiction film &quot;Timeline&quot; (2003). He played Erik, The Phantom in Joel Schumacher&#x27;s 2004 musical &quot;The Phantom of the Opera&quot;.

Butler gained wider recognition for his portrayal of King Leonidas in Zack Snyder&#x27;s fantasy war film &quot;300&quot; (2007). In 2010, he began lending his voice to the &quot;How to Train Your Dragon&quot; franchise. Also in the 2010s, he portrayed a Secret Service agent in the action thriller &quot;Has Fallen&quot; film series, played military leader Tullus Aufidius in the 2011 film &quot;Coriolanus&quot;, and Sam Childers in the 2011 action biopic &quot;Machine Gun Preacher&quot;. Butler had further action film roles in &quot;Geostorm&quot; (2017), &quot;Den of Thieves&quot; (2018), &quot;Greenland&quot; (2020), and &quot;Plane&quot; (2023).

==Early life==
Butler was born in Paisley, Renfrewshire, Scotland, the youngest of three children of Margaret and Edward Butler, a bookmaker. However, his family, which is Catholic, is of Irish descent. His family moved to Montreal, Quebec, Canada when he was six months old. A year later, when his parents&#x27; marriage broke down, his mother left Montreal and returned to Scotland with Gerard, aged 18 months.

Butler was head boy at St Mirin&#x27;s &amp; St Margaret&#x27;s High School in Paisley and won a place at University of Glasgow School of Law. He also attended Scottish Youth Theatre while a teenager. He did not see his father again until he was 16, when Edward Butler called to meet him at a Glasgow restaurant. After the meeting, Butler cried for hours, and recalled later: &quot;That emotion showed me how much pain can sit in this body of yours; pain and sorrow that you don&#x27;t know you have until it is unleashed.&quot;

As a student, he was the president of the university law society, a position he later said he &quot;kind of blagged my way into&quot;. When Butler was 22, his father was diagnosed with cancer and died. He said of this period in his life: &quot;I had gone from a 16-year-old who couldn&#x27;t wait to grasp life to a 22-year-old who didn&#x27;t care if he died in his sleep.&quot;

Before his final year of law school, Butler took a year off to live in California—mostly in Venice Beach, where he held different jobs, traveled often, and, he says, drank heavily; at one point he was arrested for alcohol-related disorderly conduct. Describing his behaviour during that year, he recalled: &quot;I was out of control, and justifying it with this idea that &#x27;I&#x27;m young, this is life. This is me just being boisterous.&#x27; &quot; After his time off in America, he returned to Scotland to finish his final year at law school.

He had ear surgery as a child that left him with a mangled ear. He still suffers from tinnitus and has hearing loss in his right ear.

==Career==

===Legal career and early acting career===
Upon graduation, he took a position as a trainee lawyer at an Edinburgh law firm. However, he continued to stay out late drinking and frequently missed work. One week before he qualified as a lawyer, he was fired. At the age of 25, and an unqualified lawyer, he moved to London to pursue his dream of becoming famous. He admitted, &quot;When I started out, I&#x27;m not sure I was actually in it for the right reasons. I wanted very much to be famous.&quot;

Initially unable to win any acting roles, he worked in a variety of jobs including as a waiter, a telemarketer and a toy demonstrator at fairs. In London, he met an old friend from his teenage days in the Scottish Youth Theatre, who was now a London casting director. At that time, he was her boyfriend and her assistant. She took him to an audition for Steven Berkoff&#x27;s play of &quot;Coriolanus&quot;. The director said of Butler&#x27;s audition, &quot;When he read, he had such vigour and enthusiasm—so much that it made the other actors seem limp—that I decided to cast him in the ensemble.&quot;

Then aged 27, Butler had his first professional acting job. Less than a year later, he won a part in a theatre adaptation of &quot;Trainspotting&quot; at the Edinburgh Festival. At age 30, he decided to move to Los Angeles, where he won parts in &quot;Dracula 2000&quot;, &quot;Tomb Raider 2&quot;, &quot;Dear Frankie&quot; and &quot;Phantom of the Opera&quot;.

===Acting career===

In London, Butler had various odd jobs until being cast by actor and director Steven Berkoff (who later appeared alongside him in &quot;Attila&quot; (2001)) in a stage production of &quot;Coriolanus&quot;. He was cast as Ewan McGregor&#x27;s character Renton in the stage adaptation of &quot;Trainspotting&quot;, the same play that had inspired him to become an actor. His film debut was as Billy Connolly&#x27;s character&#x27;s younger brother in &quot;Mrs Brown&quot; (1997).

His film career continued with small roles, first in the James Bond film &quot;Tomorrow Never Dies&quot; (1997) and then Russell Mulcahy&#x27;s &quot;Tale of the Mummy&quot; (1998). In 2000, Butler was cast in two breakthrough roles, the first being Attila the Hun in the American TV miniseries &quot;Attila&quot; (2001). The film&#x27;s producers wanted a known actor to play the part but eventually chose Butler. He was cast as Dracula in &quot;Dracula 2000&quot; (2000).

He then appeared in &quot;Reign of Fire&quot; (2002) as Creedy and &quot;Lara Croft: Tomb Raider – The Cradle of Life&quot; (2003) as Terry Sheridan, alongside Angelina Jolie. In the role of Andre Marek in the big-screen adaptation of Michael Crichton&#x27;s novel &quot;Timeline&quot; (2003), Butler played an archaeologist who was sent back in time with a team of students to rescue a colleague.
In 2003, director Joel Schumacher was deciding on the principal casting for the film &quot;The Phantom of the Opera&quot;, a film adaptation of the Andrew Lloyd Webber musical of the same name, and thought of Butler, whom he had seen earlier in the film &quot;Dracula 2000&quot;, to play the title character. Butler, who had had no musical experience other than singing in a rock band while he was studying to be a lawyer, was surprised at the interest, but immediately began taking singing lessons with a vocal coach. He then did an acting audition with Schumacher, and a singing audition with Lloyd Webber, both of whom were impressed by his performance. The film, and Butler&#x27;s performance, received mixed reviews, though Butler was nominated for a Satellite Award for Best Actor.

Other projects that followed include &quot;Dear Frankie&quot; (2005), &quot;The Game of Their Lives&quot; (2005) and &quot;Beowulf &amp; Grendel&quot; (2005).

In 2006, he starred as Spartan King Leonidas in the Warner Bros. production &quot;300&quot;, which is often described as his breakthrough role. Butler, who said he &quot;wanted to look really strong&quot; in the film, trained with a high-intensity workout for four months prior to the film&#x27;s shooting. In 2007, he appeared in &quot;Butterfly on a Wheel&quot; co-starring Pierce Brosnan and Maria Bello, which aired on network TV under the title &quot;Shattered&quot;, and in the romantic comedy &quot;P.S. I Love You&quot; with Hilary Swank. In 2008, he appeared in &quot;Nim&#x27;s Island&quot; and &quot;RocknRolla&quot;. In 2009, he starred in the Neveldine/Taylor film &quot;Gamer&quot;, &quot;The Ugly Truth&quot; and &quot;Law Abiding Citizen&quot;, which he also co-produced. In 2010 he starred in the action/comedy &quot;The Bounty Hunter&quot; with Jennifer Aniston, and did voice acting for the 2010 animated film &quot;How to Train Your Dragon&quot; as Stoick the Vast.

On 15 and 16 October 2010, thanks to the popularity of his role as Spartan King Leonidas and the use of his lines during athletic events at Michigan State University, he was a guest at their Midnight Madness and homecoming American football game.

, Butler, while filming &quot;Playing for Keeps&quot;, was writing songs and in the process of recording an album. He disavowed gossip reports that Marilyn Manson and Johnny Depp had advised him on the project. On 18 December that year, while filming &quot;Chasing Mavericks&quot;, Butler was hospitalized after he was pulled under big waves. Subsequently, he was taken to Stanford University Medical Center and later released.

Butler starred as Secret Service agent Mike Banning in the action thriller &quot;Olympus Has Fallen&quot; (2013), opposite co-stars Aaron Eckhart and Morgan Freeman. He said he broke two bones in his neck while shooting the film, but did not realize this until he had an MRI scan. Butler reprised his voice role as Stoick in &quot;How to Train Your Dragon 2&quot; in 2014. Two years later, he reprised his role as Mike Banning in the &quot;Olympus Has Fallen&quot; sequel &quot;London Has Fallen&quot; and also portrayed Set in &quot;Gods of Egypt&quot;. Late in 2018, Butler starred as submarine captain Commander Joe Glass of the USS &quot;Arkansas&quot;, a Virginia class nuclear submarine, in the film &quot;Hunter Killer&quot;. He starred as Mike Banning again in the 2019 film &quot;Angel Has Fallen&quot; and returned as the voice of Stoick in &quot;How to Train Your Dragon: The Hidden World&quot;, which was released the same year. After release delays due to COVID-19, Butler starred in &quot;Greenland&quot; in 2020. In January 2024, Butler was announced to reprise his role as Stoick in the live-action remake of &quot;How to Train Your Dragon&quot;, which is set for a 2025 release.

He has been a member of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences in the Actor&#x27;s Branch since 2011.

==Personal life==

Since October 2011, Butler has divided his time between Los Angeles and Glasgow. In 2011, he was rushed to the Stanford University Medical Center after suffering a surfing incident in Mavericks, California, during the filming of &quot;Of Men and Mavericks&quot;. He was stable and released from the hospital later that week. 

Butler stated in an interview that he no longer drinks alcohol. In February 2012, it was announced that he had completed a course of treatment for substance abuse of painkillers at a rehabilitation facility. He was concerned he had become too reliant on prescribed pain medication, which escalated after his surfing accident.

In 2011, Butler played in a charity match for Celtic F.C., a football club he has supported since childhood. A year later he represented Celtic in a Hollywood film, starring as a &quot;has-been&quot; player in &quot;Playing for Keeps&quot;. He is also a supporter of Scotland rugby and has even been involved with promotional videos for the side including for the 2023 Rugby World Cup. In August 2013, he bought an equity stake in the Jamaica Tallawahs cricket team, part of the Limacol Caribbean Premier League (CPL). He has supported the charity Mary&#x27;s Meals since 2010. He visited the international development charity&#x27;s programme in Liberia in 2014. In 2018, he attended a fundraiser gala organised by Friends of the Israel Defense Forces, which raised $60 million. In November 2018, Butler&#x27;s home was destroyed in the Woolsey Fire in California.

<doc id="757263" wikidata="Q86359" url="?curid=757263" title="Josef Matthias Hauer">
<text>Josef Matthias Hauer (March 19, 1883 – September 22, 1959) was an Austrian composer and music theorist. He is best known for developing, independent of and a year or two before Arnold Schoenberg, a method for composing with all 12 notes of the chromatic scale. Hauer was also an important early theorist of twelve-tone music and composition.

Hauer &quot;detested all art that expressed ideas, programmes or feelings,&quot; instead believing that it was &quot;essential...to raise music to its highest...level,&quot; a &quot;purely spiritual, supersensual music composed according to impersonal rules,&quot; and many of his compositions reflect this in their direct, often athematic, &#x27;cerebral&#x27; approach. Hauer&#x27;s music is diverse, however, and not all of it embraces this aesthetic position.

== Life ==
Hauer was born in Wiener Neustadt and died in Vienna. He had an early musical training in cello, choral conducting, and organ, and claimed to have been self-taught in theory and composition. In 1918, he published his first work on music theory (a tone-color theory based on Goethe&#x27;s &quot;Theory of Colours&quot;). In August 1919, he published his &quot;law of the twelve tones&quot;, requiring that all twelve chromatic notes sound before any is repeated. This he developed and first articulated theoretically in &quot;Vom Wesen des Musikalischen&quot; (1920), before the Schoenberg circle’s earliest writings on twelve-tone technique.

Hauer wrote prolifically, both music and prose, until 1938, when his music was added to the touring Nazi &quot;degenerate art&quot; (&quot;Entartete Kunst&quot;) exhibit. He stayed in Austria through the war, and, in fear, published nothing. Even after the war, however, he published little more, although it is thought that several hundred pieces remain in manuscript. Hauer continued to write twelve-tone pieces while also teaching several students his techniques and philosophy. At the time of his death, Hauer had reportedly given away most of his possessions, living simply while retaining a copy of the &quot;I Ching&quot;.

== Musical style ==
Hauer&#x27;s compositional techniques are extraordinarily various and often change from one piece to the next. These range from building-block techniques to methods using a chord series that is generated out of the twelve-tone row (&quot;Melos&quot;) to pieces employing an ordered row that is then subject to systematic permutation. The so-called 44 &quot;tropes&quot; and their compositional usage (&quot;trope-technique&quot;) are essential to many of Hauer&#x27;s twelve-tone techniques. In contrast to a twelve-tone row that contains a fixed succession of twelve tones, a trope consists of two complementary hexachords in which there is no fixed tone sequence. The tropes are used for structural and intervallic views on the twelve-tone system. Every trope offers certain symmetries that can be used by the composer. But Hauer also employed twelve-tone rows, using one row for a single piece and subjecting that row to a series of transformations, most notably rotation (keeping the order of the elements in a series fixed but reorganizing them so that they start somewhere in the middle and wrap back around to the beginning: A B C D . . . becomes C D . . . A B, for instance.

According to one scholar, Hauer&#x27;s twelve-tone music was balanced between the &quot;obligatory rule&quot; that each composition follow an arrangement of the total chromatic: &quot;the &#x27;Constellation&#x27; or &quot;Grundgestalt&#x27; (&#x27;basic shape&#x27;),&quot; and his often emphasized concept of tropes, or unordered arrangement of a pair of hexachords. This interpretation seems largely drawn from Hauer&#x27;s theoretical writing of the early to mid-1920s in which he outlines these techniques. But a closer look at Hauer&#x27;s compositional output reveals that a significant portion of his twelve-tone music from the 1920s and 1930s employs strictly ordered rows, as do the &quot;Zwölftonspiele&quot; (&quot;Twelve-tone pieces&quot;) that follow. Despite this, Hauer is often mentioned as the inventor of the tropes in contrast to Arnold Schoenberg and the Second Viennese School, who are thought of as advocates of Schoenberg&#x27;s twelve-tone method. (In fact, many of the twelve-tone pieces by Schoenberg and his student Alban Berg do not strictly follow this method.)

After 1940, Hauer wrote exclusively &quot;Zwölftonspiele&quot;, designated sometimes by number, sometimes by date. He wrote about one thousand such pieces, most of which are lost. These pieces were all built on an ordered twelve-tone row, with the actual order often determined by chance. These pieces were not so much concert pieces as much as systematic and controlled meditations on the twelve tones—more a means than an end. Hauer believed that the twelve tempered tones provided access to the realm of the spiritual; meditating on the twelve tones was thus a prayerful act and not a public display of personal emotion or expression. In many ways Hauer&#x27;s use of chance elements, and especially his deep interest in the &quot;I Ching&quot;, are parallel to those of American composer John Cage.

==References in literature==
Since the 1920s Hauer has figured in literature, e.g., in &#x27;s novel &quot;Sonnenmelodie&quot; (1923) and Franz Werfel&#x27;s &quot;&quot; (1924 - the character Matthias Fischboeck). Late in life Hauer spoke about Thomas Mann, as well as Theodor W. Adorno, with great bitterness, for he felt that both men had misunderstood him. Adorno had written about Hauer, but only disparagingly. Because of his later achievements and developments it has also been assumed by many scholars that Hauer is also a model for the &quot;Joculator Basiliensis&quot; in Hermann Hesse&#x27;s &quot;The Glass Bead Game&quot;.

==Theoretical writings==
Hauer is considered an important figure in the development of twelve-tone theory and aesthetics. His early published writings &quot;Vom Wesen des Musikalischen&quot; (1920) and &quot;Deutung des Melos&quot; articulate the more theoretical and aesthetic aspects of Hauer&#x27;s thought, while &quot;Vom Melos zur Pauke&quot; (1925) and &quot;Zwölftontechnik, Die Lehre von den Tropen&quot; (1926) provide detailed musical examples. Because of the discussion of tropes in &quot;Zwölftontechnik&quot;, Hauer has usually been cast as an advocate for trope composition in contrast to those advocating the use of an ordered twelve-tone series. This view, however, is mistaken; tropes were only one of the many ways Hauer had of approaching a systematic circulation of all twelve tones. (Much of the music praised by those who advocated for an ordered series—the music of Schoenberg and Berg especially—was much more flexible in actual practice than the descriptions of them seems to indicate.) These early theoretical works make Hauer one of the founders of twelve-tone theory.

In his theoretical writing, Hauer often casts the twelve tempered tones as a kind of spiritual world. For Hauer, this twelve-tone world offers one access to the fundamental truths of existence, transforming composition from an act of personal expression into one of devotion and contemplation. His various twelve-tone techniques thus become a means to an end, as do the pieces themselves; the ultimate goal of music is to commune with the infinite. This mystical approach to music is drawn from 19th-century romanticism and is certainly not exclusive to Hauer, though he may have been the most publicly vocal proponent of this idea in the Vienna of his day. In fact, much of the thinking of the Second Viennese School is bound up with the idea that music provides access to spiritual truth, an idea adapted from the writing of Schopenhauer, who enjoyed considerable popularity at this time, especially among artists. Hauer often refers to the scientific writing of Goethe (the &quot;Theory of Colors&quot; especially), which most likely came to him through the editions and commentary of Rudolf Steiner.

The most important writings:

<text>War Memorial Stadium, colloquially known as The Rockpile, was an outdoor football, baseball and soccer stadium in Buffalo, New York. Opened in 1937 as Roesch Memorial Stadium, the venue was later known as Grover Cleveland Stadium and Civic Stadium. The stadium was home to the Canisius Golden Griffins (NCAA), Buffalo Indians-Tigers (AFL), Buffalo Bills (AAFC), Buffalo Bulls (NCAA), Buffalo Bills (AFL/NFL), Buffalo Bisons (IL), Buffalo White Eagles (ECPSL), Buffalo Blazers (NSL), Buffalo Bisons (EL/AA) and Canisius Golden Griffins (NCAA). It also had a race track and hosted several NASCAR events. The venue was demolished in 1989 and replaced with the Johnnie B. Wiley Amateur Athletic Sports Pavilion, which retains entrances from the original stadium.

==History==

===Planning and construction===
The stadium was built on the East Side of Buffalo for $3 million as a Works Progress Administration project in 1937. It was built on a large, rectangular block that had once housed the Prospect Reservoir.

===Opening and reception===

The 36,500-seat venue was primarily used for college football when it opened on October 16, 1937, with the Tulane Green Wave defeating the Colgate Raiders 7–6 in the inaugural game. The name changed several times in its first two years of operation, first being named after Republican Charlie Roesch, then for Democrat Grover Cleveland, before settling on the nonpartisan Civic Stadium. The Buffalo Indians-Tigers became the venue&#x27;s first professional football team in 1940.

===Alterations===
A quarter mile cinder oval race track was added to the interior perimeter of the venue in 1940 for auto racing. Both midget car racing and stock car racing were popular at the venue, attracting NASCAR events in 1956 and 1958. Due to the small size of the track, drivers were forced to leave the venue to make pit stops at nearby Masten Armory. Fans were also forbidden from sitting in the first five rows of the venue for safety reasons.

Buffalo was awarded an expansion franchise by the Continental League of Major League Baseball in January 1960, and made plans to play at the venue beginning with the 1961 season. However, the league folded before the season began. The Buffalo Bisons remained in the International League and began play at the newly renamed War Memorial Stadium in 1961, as their previous home of Offermann Stadium had already been slated for demolition.

The venue&#x27;s race track was removed in 1960 so that the stadium could accommodate both baseball and football for the Buffalo Bisons and Buffalo Bills. The stadium&#x27;s baseball diamond had an unorthodox southeast alignment (home plate to center field). The east-west alignment of the football field was also unorthodox, running along the third base line.

The stadium was expanded to hold 46,306 fans in 1965.

The venue was poorly maintained, lending to its nickname of &quot;The Rockpile&quot;. Brock Yates of &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; jokingly wrote in 1969 that the stadium, &quot;looks as if whatever war it was a memorial to had been fought within its confines.&quot;

While the Buffalo Bills were popular and regularly filled the venue, the Buffalo Bisons struggled to attract crowds. The Bisons moved mid-season in 1970 and became the Winnipeg Whips.

The stadium was deemed unsuitable for National Football League play after the AFL–NFL merger, as it sat fewer than the combined league&#x27;s 50,000 seat requirement for venues and was unable to be expanded. Rich Stadium was constructed for the Bills in suburban Orchard Park, where the team moved after the 1972 season.

The venue sat vacant until 1976 when the Buffalo Blazers of the National Soccer League began play. A new Buffalo Bisons franchise was founded in 1979 that returned baseball to the venue. That same year, Canisius College signed a 10-year agreement to use the venue for its college events.

&quot;The Natural&quot; was filmed at the venue in 1983.

===Closing and demolition===
The Bisons moved to newly constructed Pilot Field following the 1987 season. The final event at the venue saw the Akron Zips defeat the Canisius Golden Griffins 11–2 on May 6, 1989. Canisius moved its football and baseball teams to the newly built Demske Sports Complex.

War Memorial Stadium was demolished in 1989 and replaced with the Johnnie B. Wiley Amateur Athletic Sports Pavilion, a high school athletic field. Built in 1992 for $6.8 million, the complex incorporates the original entrances from War Memorial Stadium. It was previously home to the Buffalo Gladiators, an amateur football team.

The original flag pole from center field at War Memorial Stadium was preserved and installed at Pilot Field in July 1990, where it stands to this day.

==Notable events==
===Football===
A preseason neutral site Canadian Football League game between the Hamilton Tiger-Cats and the Toronto Argonauts took place at the venue on August 11, 1951. Hamilton defeated Toronto by a score of 17–11.

The venue was host to the Coaches All-America Game from 1961 to 1965. Originally called the Graduation Bowl in its inaugural year, the game was an exhibition between the best college seniors in America who were turning professional.

The stadium hosted three postseason American Football League games:

* 1963 AFL Eastern Division playoff: Boston Patriots defeated the Buffalo Bills 26–8 on December 28, 1963
* 1964 AFL Championship Game: Buffalo Bills defeated the San Diego Chargers 20–7 on December 26, 1964
* 1966 AFL Championship Game: Kansas City Chiefs defeated the Buffalo Bills 31–7 on January 1, 1967

===Baseball===

The stadium hosted two Major League Baseball exhibitions:

* International League All-Stars defeated the New York Yankees 5–0 on August 19, 1963
* Cleveland Indians and Toronto Blue Jays played to an 8–8 tie on April 5, 1987

A touring Old-Timers&#x27; Game staged Buffalo&#x27;s Grand Old Game at the venue on June 23, 1984. The American League All-Stars defeated the National League All-Stars 6–1.

===NASCAR===
The stadium hosted two NASCAR events:

* NASCAR Convertible Division event on July 7, 1956, won by Joe Weatherly
* NASCAR Grand National event on July 19, 1958, won by Jim Reed

==In media==
The 1984 film &quot;The Natural&quot; was filmed at War Memorial Stadium, with it representing the home ballpark of the fictional New York Knights.

<text>Derek Curtis Bok (born March 22, 1930) is an American lawyer and educator, and former president of Harvard University.

==Early life and education==
Bok was born in Bryn Mawr, Pennsylvania. Following his parents&#x27; divorce, he, his mother, brother and sister moved several times, ultimately to Los Angeles, where he spent much of his childhood. He graduated from Stanford University (B.A., 1951), Harvard Law School (J.D., 1954), attended Sciences Po, and George Washington University (A.M., 1958).

== Career ==
Bok taught law at Harvard beginning in 1958 and was selected dean of the law school there (1968–1971) after Dean Erwin Griswold was appointed Solicitor-General of the United States. He then served as the university&#x27;s 25th president (1971–1991), succeeding Nathan M. Pusey. He was installed as president in a private ceremony in the Faculty Room of University Hall, given his predecessor abruptly stepping down after the botched handling of anti-Vietnam War protests on campus.

In the mid-1970s, Bok negotiated with Radcliffe College president Matina Horner the &quot;non-merger merger&quot; between Harvard and Radcliffe Colleges that was a major step in the final merger of the two institutions. Bok recently served as the faculty chair at the Hauser Center for Nonprofit Organizations at Harvard, taught at the Harvard Graduate School of Education, and is the 300th Anniversary University Professor at Harvard Kennedy School.

Bok&#x27;s focus on undergraduate education was evident in his initiating the Harvard Assessment Seminar that resulted in Richard J. Light&#x27;s best-selling book, &quot;Making the Most of College: Students Speak Their Minds&quot; (Harvard University Press, 2001). This focus has continued in Bok&#x27;s numerous publications since retiring as Harvard president. He was the recipient of the 2001 University of Louisville Grawemeyer Award in Education for his book, &quot;The Shape of the River: Long-Term Consequences of Considering Race in College and University Admissions&quot;, co-authored with the former President of Princeton University, William G. Bowen. 

The Derek Bok Center for Teaching and Learning at Harvard was created during Bok&#x27;s Harvard presidency, reflecting Bok&#x27;s concern for the quality of pedagogy employed at research universities like Harvard and its peers around the world. self sourced The Harvard Extension School instituted the Derek Bok Public Service Prizes, an annual Commencement prize for the Harvard Extension School students who involve in community service or who have a long-standing records of civic achievement.

Bok served as interim president of Harvard from Lawrence Summers&#x27;s resignation on July 1, 2006, to the beginning of Drew Gilpin Faust presidency on July 1, 2007. He is a member of both the American Academy of Arts and Sciences and the American Philosophical Society.

==Personal life==
In 1955, Bok married Swedish sociologist and philosopher Sissela Bok (née Myrdal) (daughter of the Swedish economist Gunnar Myrdal and the politician and diplomat Alva Myrdal, both Nobel laureates), who received her doctorate from Harvard in 1970. His daughter, Hilary Bok, is a philosophy professor at Johns Hopkins University.

Bok is the son of Pennsylvania Supreme Court justice Curtis Bok and Margaret Plummer Bok; the grandson of Dutch-born &quot;Ladies&#x27; Home Journal&quot; editor Edward Bok and Mary Louise Curtis, founder of the Curtis Institute of Music; the cousin of prominent Maine folklorist Gordon Bok; and the great-grandson of Cyrus H. K. Curtis, founder of the Curtis Publishing Company, publisher of national magazines such as &quot;The Saturday Evening Post&quot;.

<text>A water filter removes impurities by lowering contamination of water using a fine physical barrier, a chemical process, or a biological process. Filters cleanse water to different extents, for purposes such as: providing agricultural irrigation, accessible drinking water, public and private aquariums, and the safe use of ponds and swimming pools.

==Methods of filtration==

Filters use sieving, adsorption, ion exchanges, biofilms and other processes to remove unwanted substances from water. Unlike a sieve or screen, a filter can potentially remove particles much smaller than the holes through which its water passes, such as nitrates or germs like &quot;Cryptosporidium.&quot;

Among the methods of filtration, notable examples are sedimentation, used to separate hard and suspended solids from water and activated charcoal treatment, where, typically, boiled water is poured through a piece of cloth to trap undesired residuals. Additionally, the use of machinery to work on desalinization and purification of water through the transposal of it into multiple-filtration water tanks is used. This technique is aimed at the filtration of water on bigger scales, such as serving entire cities.

These three methods are particularly relevant, as they trace back centuries and are the base for many of the modern methods of filtration used today.

==Types==
===Water treatment plant filters===
Types of water filters for municipal and other large treatment systems include media filters, screen filters, disk filters, slow sand filter beds, rapid sand filters, cloth filters, and biological filters such as algae scrubbers.

===Point-of-use filters===

Point-of-use filters for home use include granular-activated carbon filters used for carbon filtering, depth filter, metallic alloy filters, microporous ceramic filters, carbon block resin, microfiltration and ultrafiltration membranes. Some filters use more than one filtration method. An example of this is a multi-barrier system. Jug filters can be used for small quantities of drinking water. Some kettles have built-in filters, primarily to reduce limescale build-up.

===Portable water filters===

Water filters are used by hikers, aid organizations during humanitarian emergencies, and the military. These filters are usually small, portable and lightweight ( or less). These usually filter water by working a mechanical hand pump, although some use a siphon drip system to force water through, while others are built into water bottles. Dirty water is pumped via a screen-filtered flexible silicon tube through a specialized filter, ending up in a container. These filters work to remove bacteria, protozoa and microbial cysts that can cause disease. Filters may have fine meshes that must be replaced or cleaned, and ceramic water filters must have its outside abraded when they have become clogged with impurities.

These water filters should not be confused with devices or tablets that disinfect water, which remove or kill viruses such as hepatitis A and rotavirus.

===Ceramic water filters===

Ceramic filters represent low-cost solutions to water filtration and are widely adhered to despite being one of the oldest methods of filtration. These filters are found not only inside the homes of families but also used in industrial engineering (as high-temperature filters) for several processes.

The conventional ceramic filters used for day-to-day water consumption, known as candle-type filters, work with gravity and a central candle, which makes the filtration process significantly long.

==Water polishing==
The term water polishing can refer to any process that removes small (usually microscopic) particulate material, or removes very low concentrations of dissolved material from water. The process and its meaning vary from setting to setting: a manufacturer of aquarium filters may claim that its filters perform water polishing by capturing &quot;micro particles&quot; within nylon or polyester pads, just as a chemical engineer can use the term to refer to the removal of magnetic resins from a solution by passing the solution over a bed of magnetic particulate. In this sense, water polishing is simply another term for whole house water filtration systems. Polishing is also done on a large scale in water reclamation plants.

==History==
4000 years ago, in India, Hindus devised the first drinking water standards. Hindus heated dirty water by boiling it and exposing it to sunlight or dipping it seven times in hot pieces of copper, then filtering it through earthen vessels and cooling it. This was an enlightened procedure to obtain sterilized drinking water as well as to keep it aesthetically pleasing. This method was directed at individuals and households rather than for use as a community water source. In China, boiling water was found to reduce the spread of disease. To this day, hot water just below boiling point is typically served in Chinese restaurants. 

2,000 years ago, Mayan drinking water filtration systems used crystalline quartz and zeolite. Both minerals are used in modern water filtration. &quot;The filters would have removed harmful microbes, nitrogen-rich compounds, heavy metals such as mercury and other toxins from the water&quot;.

The Egyptians reportedly used alum to clarify water as early as 1500 BC.

Persian engineer Al-Karaji () wrote a book, &quot;The Extraction of Hidden Waters&quot;, which gave an early description of a water filtration process. 

Until the invention of the microscope, the existence of microscopic life was undiscovered. More than 200 years passed before the microscope was invented and the relationship between microorganisms and disease became clear. In the mid-19th century, cholera was proven to be transmitted by contaminated water. In the late 19th century, Louis Pasteur&#x27;s theory of the particulate pathogen finally established a causal relationship between microorganisms and disease. Filtration as a method of water purification was established in the 18th century, and the first municipal water treatment plant was built in Scotland in 1832. However, the aesthetic value of water was important at the time, and effective water quality standards did not exist until the late 19th century.

During the 19th and 20th centuries, water filters for domestic water production were generally divided into slow sand filters and rapid sand filters (also called mechanical filters and American filters). While there were many small-scale water filtration systems prior to 1800, Paisley, Scotland is generally acknowledged as the first city to receive filtered water for an entire town. The Paisley filter began operation in 1804 and was an early type of slow sand filter. Throughout the 1800s, hundreds of slow sand filters were constructed in the UK and on the European continent. An intermittent slow sand filter was constructed and operated at Lawrence, Massachusetts in 1893 due to continuing typhoid fever epidemics caused by sewage contamination of the water supply. The first continuously operating slow sand filter was designed by Allen Hazen for the city of Albany, New York in 1897. The most comprehensive history of water filtration was published by Moses N. Baker in 1948 and reprinted in 1981.

In the 1800s, mechanical filtration was an industrial process that depended on the addition of aluminium sulfate prior to the filtration process. The filtration rate for mechanical filtration was typically more than 60 times faster than slow sand filters, thus requiring significantly less land area. The first modern mechanical filtration plant in the U.S. was built at Little Falls, New Jersey, for the East Jersey Water Company. George W. Fuller designed and supervised the construction of the plant which went into operation in 1902. In 1924, John R. Baylis developed a fixed grid backwash assist system, which consisted of pipes with nozzles that injected jets of water into the filter material during expansion.

<text>The first USS &quot;T-1&quot; (SS-52/SF-1) was an in the service of the United States Navy; &quot;T-1&quot; was also known as Schley and AA-1.

She was laid down as USS &quot;Schley&quot; on 21 June 1916 at the Fore River Shipbuilding Company yard in Quincy, Massachusetts, by the Electric Boat Co. of New York, renamed &quot;AA-1&quot; on 23 August 1917 to free the name &quot;Schley&quot; for a destroyer, launched on 25 July 1918, sponsored by Mrs. Lilian Hovey-King, and commissioned on 30 January 1920 at Boston, Massachusetts, with Lt. Comdr James Parker, Jr. in command.

&quot;AA-1&quot; was one of three boats designed and constructed under a project charged with developing fleet submarines; that is, undersea boats possessing the sea-keeping qualities and endurance capability required for long-range operations, as scouts for the surface fleet. On 17 July 1920, while the submarine was being fitted-out, the Navy adopted its modern system of alpha-numeric hull numbers, and the fleet submarine was designated SF-1. On 20 September, she was renamed &quot;T-1&quot;. Thus, by the time she began active service that fall, she was known as &quot;T-1&quot; (SF-1).

&quot;T-1&quot;″s commissioned service lasted less than three years. She operated out of Hampton Roads, Virginia, training crews and conducting maneuvers along the east coast with other units of the U.S. Atlantic Fleet. Throughout the entire period, she remained a unit of Submarine Division 15. However, during her service, flaws in her design and construction—particularly in her propulsion plant—became apparent. On 5 December 1922, &quot;T-1&quot; was placed out of commission and laid up at the Submarine Base, Hampton Roads, Va. Later, she was moved to Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. After almost eight years of inactivity, her name was struck from the Navy list on 19 September 1930. Her hulk was broken up, and the materials were sold for scrap on 20 November 1930.

<doc id="757279" wikidata="Q36381607" url="?curid=757279" title="Disc filter">
<text>A disc filter is a type of water filter used primarily in irrigation, similar to a screen filter, except that the filter cartridge is made of a number of plastic discs stacked on top of each other like a pile of poker chips. Each disc is covered with small grooves or bumps. The discs (or rings) each have a hole in the middle, forming a hollow cylinder in the middle of the stack. The water passes through the small passages in between and the impurities are trapped behind.
The filtration quality is based on the quantity and size of particles that the filtering element is able to retain. Higher quality filtration simply means cleaner water. This depends on the geometry of the channels, including the size, length, angle, and number of generated intersection points. The discs are typically color coded to denote the level of filtration. Filtration quality is usually measured in microns, based on the smallest size particle filtered. The typical range is from 25 microns for the finest level of filtration to 400 microns for the coarsest. Sometimes the filtration quality is given as the equivalent mesh size of a comparable screen filter. Typical mesh sizes range from 40 to 600. When using mesh sizes, 40 is the coarsest and 600 is the finest or highest level of filtration.

Disc filters range in size from small units with a 3/4&quot; inlet and outlet used for landscape drip irrigation systems to very large banks of multiple filters manifolded together used for filtering large volumes of water for agricultural and industrial applications.

Some disc filters, especially the smaller ones, must be taken apart and cleaned by hand. Many of the larger ones can be backflushed in such a way that the discs are able to separate and spin during the cleaning cycle. In some cases, a booster pump may be required for backflushing. Disc filters can be used for many types of contaminants, including fine sand and organic matter. However, when used to filter organic matter, they will clog more quickly than a media filter and will have to be cleaned more often. One advantage that the disc filter has over the media filter is that it can backflush more quickly with less flush water.

Disc filters used in agricultural irrigation are covered by the ISO 9912-2 standard.

== History ==
The disc filter was originally developed in 1936 to filter hydraulic fluid in the B-17 bomber. In these filters, the discs were made of stainless steel and brass. In the 1960s, this type of filter began to be used in Israel to filter irrigation water.

<doc id="757288" wikidata="Q1072103" url="?curid=757288" title="Phosphene">
<text>A phosphene is the phenomenon of seeing light without light entering the eye. The word &quot;phosphene&quot; comes from the Greek words &quot;phos&quot; (light) and &quot;phainein&quot; (to show). Phosphenes that are induced by movement or sound may be associated with optic neuritis.

Phosphenes can be induced by mechanical, electrical, or magnetic stimulation of the retina or visual cortex, or by random firing of cells in the visual system. Phosphenes have also been reported by meditators (called &quot;nimitta&quot;), people who endure long periods without visual stimulation (the prisoner&#x27;s cinema), or those who ingest psychedelic drugs.

== Causes ==

=== Mechanical stimulation ===
The most common phosphenes are pressure phosphenes, caused by rubbing or applying pressure on or near the closed eyes. They have been known since antiquity, and described by the Greeks. The pressure mechanically stimulates the cells of the retina. Experiences include a darkening of the visual field that moves against the rubbing, a diffuse colored patch that also moves against the rubbing, well defined shapes such as bright circles that exist near or opposite to where pressure is being applied, a scintillating and ever-changing and deforming light grid with occasional dark spots (like a crumpling fly-spotted flyscreen), and a sparse field of intense blue points of light. Pressure phosphenes can persist briefly after the rubbing stops and the eyes are opened, allowing the phosphenes to be seen on the visual scene. Hermann von Helmholtz and others have published drawings of their pressure phosphenes. One example of a pressure phosphene is demonstrated by gently pressing the side of one&#x27;s eye and observing a colored ring of light on the opposite side, as detailed by Isaac Newton.

Another common phosphene is &quot;seeing stars&quot; from a sneeze, laughter, a heavy and deep cough, blowing of the nose, a blow on the head or low blood pressure (such as on standing up too quickly or prior to fainting). It is possible these involve some mechanical stimulation of the retina, but they may also involve mechanical and metabolic (such as from low oxygenation or lack of glucose) stimulation of neurons of the visual cortex or of other parts of the visual system.

Less commonly, phosphenes can also be caused by some diseases of the retina and nerves, such as multiple sclerosis. The British National Formulary lists phosphenes as an occasional side effect of at least one anti-anginal medication.

The name &quot;phosphene&quot; was coined by the French physician , better known as the ship&#x27;s surgeon of the wrecked French frigate &quot;Méduse&quot;. It was first employed by Serre d&#x27;Uzes to test retinal function prior to cataract surgery.

=== Electrical stimulation ===
Phosphenes have been created by electrical stimulation of the brain, reported by neurologist Otfrid Foerster as early as 1929. Brindley and Lewin (1968) inserted a matrix of stimulating electrodes directly into the visual cortex of a 52-year-old blind female, using small pulses of electricity to create phosphenes. These phosphenes were points, spots, and bars of colorless or colored light. Brindley and Rushton (1974) used the phosphenes to create a visual prosthesis, in this case by using the phosphenes to depict Braille spots.

In recent years, researchers have successfully developed experimental brain–computer interfaces or neuroprostheses that stimulate phosphenes to restore vision to people blinded through accidents. Notable successes include the human experiments by William H. Dobelle and Mark Humayun and animal research by Dick Normann.

A noninvasive technique that uses electrodes on the scalp, transcranial magnetic stimulation, has also been shown to produce phosphenes.

Experiments with humans have shown that when the visual cortex is stimulated above the calcarine fissure, phosphenes are produced in the lower part of the visual field, and vice versa.

=== Others ===
Phosphenes have been produced by intense, changing magnetic fields, such as with transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). These fields can be positioned on different parts of the head to stimulate cells in different parts of the visual system. They also can be induced by alternating currents that entrain neural oscillation as with transcranial alternating current stimulation. In this case they appear in the peripheral visual field. This claim has been disputed. The alternative hypothesis is that current spread from the occipital electrode evokes phosphenes in the retina. Phosphenes created by magnetic fields are known as magnetophosphenes.

Astronauts exposed to radiation in space have reported seeing phosphenes. Patients undergoing radiotherapy have reported seeing blue flashes of light during treatment; the underlying phenomenon has been shown to resemble Cherenkov radiation.

Phosphenes can be caused by some medications, such as Ivabradine.

== Mechanism ==

Most vision researchers believe that phosphenes result from the normal activity of the visual system after stimulation of one of its parts from some stimulus other than light. For example, Grüsser et al. showed that pressure on the eye results in activation of retinal ganglion cells in a similar way to activation by light. An ancient, discredited theory is that light is generated in the eye. A version of this theory has been revived, except, according to its author, that &quot;phosphene lights are [supposed to be] due to the intrinsic perception of induced or spontaneous increased biophoton emission of cells in various parts of the visual system (from retina to cortex)&quot;

== Anthropological research ==

In 1988, David Lewis-Williams and T. A. Dowson published an article about phosphenes and other entoptic phenomena. They argued that non-figurative art of the Upper Paleolithic depicts visions of phosphenes and neurological &quot;form constants&quot;, probably enhanced by hallucinogenic drugs.

== Research ==
* Research has looked into visual prosthesis for the blind, which involves use of arrays of electrodes implanted in the skull over the occipital lobe to produce phosphenes. There have been long term implants of this type. Risks, such as infections and seizures, have been an impediment to their development.
* A possible use of phosphenes as part of a brain to brain communication system has been reported. The system called BrainNet, produces phosphenes using transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). The goal of the research is to connect thoughts brain to brain using a system where signals are detected using electroencephalography (EEG) and delivered using transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). An experiment was conducted with five different groups, each containing three people. The subjects were split into two groups. Two subjects functioned as the senders, and were connected to EEG electrodes, and a third person functioned as the receiver, who wore the TMS helmet. Each person was stationed in front of a television screen with a Tetris-style game. The senders had to determine if there was a need to rotate the falling blocks, but without the ability to rotate them – only the receiver was able to perform this operation. At the edges of each screen, were two icons with two flashing lights in two different frequencies, (one at 15 Hz and the other at 17 Hz). The sender focused on one icon, or the other to signal that the block should be rotated to the right or the left. The EEG produced a unique signal, which was transmitted to the TMS helmet of the receiver, who perceived phosphenes which differed for the 15 Hz and 17 Hz signal, and rotated the block in the relevant direction. The experiment achieved 81% success.

<text>USS &quot;T-2&quot; (SS-60) was an built for the United States Navy during World War I.

==Construction and career==
The boat was laid down as &quot;AA-2&quot; on 31 May 1917 at the Fore River Shipbuilding Company yard in Quincy, Massachusetts, by the Electric Boat Co. of New York, launched on 6 September 1919, sponsored by Miss Madeline Everett, redesignated SF-2 on 17 July 1920, renamed &quot;T-2&quot; on 22 September 1920, and placed in commission at the Boston Navy Yard on 7 January 1922.

&quot;T-2&quot; was the last of three T-boats placed in commission and served actively for only 18 months. Her unique mission was long-range scouting and reconnaissance for the surface fleet. Like her sister ships, she operated in Submarine Division 15, training crews and conducting maneuvers with the Atlantic Fleet. By the fall of 1922, design and construction flaws in the three T-boats had become apparent. As a result, &quot;T-2&quot; was decommissioned on 16 July 1923 at the Submarine Base at Hampton Roads, Virginia, and was placed in reserve there. Later, she was moved to Philadelphia. Following seven years of inactivity, &quot;T-2&quot; was stricken from the Navy list on 19 September 1930. She was broken up and her metal was sold for scrap on 20 November 1930.

<doc id="757300" wikidata="Q3632569" url="?curid=757300" title="Settling basin">
<text>A settling basin, settling pond or decant pond is an earthen or concrete structure using sedimentation to remove settleable matter and turbidity from wastewater. The basins are used to control water pollution in diverse industries such as agriculture, aquaculture, and mining. Turbidity is an optical property of water caused by scattering of light by material suspended in that water. Although turbidity often varies directly with weight or volumetric measurements of settleable matter, correlation is complicated by variations in size, shape, refractive index, and specific gravity of suspended matter. Settling ponds may be ineffective at reducing turbidity caused by small particles with specific gravity low enough to be suspended by Brownian motion.

==Applications==
Settling basins are used as a separation mechanism to eliminate rejected products (i.e. waste solids management strategies) of a specified size and quantity in various fields, such as aquaculture, mining, dairy, food processing, alcohol production and wine making. Regular draining and desilting of settling basins is required to maintain satisfactory performance.

===Aquaculture===

All materials not removed from the system during harvesting are categorized as wastes including uneaten feed, excreta, chemicals and therapeutics, dead and moribund fish, escaped fish and pathogens. Settling basins in the field are simple ponds dug downstream of the farm to optimally remove suspended solids effectively, produce clarified effluent, and accumulate and thicken sludge to minimal volume. If impairment occurs in any of these functions, this might have a great impact on pond performance, which could lead to damaging the effectiveness of the process.

===Mining===

Wastewater produced by mining industries contribute to the acidity, suspended material and dissolved heavy metal ions in the aquatic environment, causing environmental problems for biological life and discoloration of the receiving waters. The application of settling basins by the Coeur d&#x27;Alene mining district of northern Idaho, United States, globally known to produce lead, zinc and silver, to treat wastewater has greatly improved the quality of water discharge from mining operations.

===Dairy waste===

By reducing flow velocity to limit solids being transported along with fast flowing liquid, separation can occur. Approximately 35–60% of the solids is removed from dilute liquid slurry, with 10 minutes detention time, with a common detention time of 30 to 60 minutes. Due to the inadequate consideration of critical design criteria, most settling basins built were oversized and had low efficiency.

Settling basins used in dairy production reduce the nutrient-loading on a vegetative filter strip from lot runoff, thus decreasing the required lagoon volume for a new facility. Moreover, settling basins are useful to remove unwanted solid materials, such as hay, straw and feathers from the waste stream before flowing to the lagoon, aids to reduce smell and avoid crust formation on the lagoon surface. A baffle may be used to retain the floating solids removed. There are two types of settling basins, based on the method of removing solids. With one type, the solids are removed mechanically (after the free water has drained away), usually with a front-end or skid-steer loader. The other type uses hydraulic (pump) removal of the solids. Typically, pumping is initiated when the basin is half full of solids and the remainder is water. Vigorous agitation is needed to mix the liquid and the solids, preferably by propeller-type agitators or pumps with agitation nozzles.

==Advantages and limitations over competitive processes==
Settling basins are designed to retain water long enough so that suspended solids can settle to obtain a high purity water in the outlet and to provide the opportunity for pH adjustment. Other processes that could be used: thickeners, clarifiers, hydro cyclones and membrane filtration are highly used techniques in the field. Compared to those processes, settling basins have a simpler and cheaper design, with fewer moving parts, demanding less maintenance, despite requiring cleaning and vacuuming of the quiescent zones at least once every two weeks.

However, settling basins can introduce new kinds of water contamination, particularly if the water supply is from a well. The basin can catch windblown contaminants, and if the water is retained for a long period, algae grows in the pool, leading to greater filtration problems. Settling ponds may also be ineffective at reducing turbidity caused by small particles with specific gravity low enough to be suspended by Brownian motion. Usually, it can only remove particles ranging from sand (2 mm in diameter) to silt (0.002 mm in diameter).

==Design considerations==
Wastewater enters the basin and very fine particles in the water are separated by means of gravity. The water must be in the basin long enough for the desired particle size to be removed. Smaller particles require longer periods for removal and thus larger basins. In some basins a flocculant may be added to help smaller particles stick together and form larger particles. Stokes&#x27; law can be used to calculate the size of a settling basin needed in order to remove a desired particle size. Stokes&#x27; law gives a settling velocity determining an effective settling basin depth; so solids removal depends upon effective settling basin surface area, while the depth component of settling basin volume remains important for storage of settled solids.

Translation of required settling time surface area to settling basin geometry requires consideration of short circuiting and turbulence induced by wind, bottom scour, or inlet and overflow design. Settling basin geometry is important because effective time of settling within the basin will be the time a volume of water spends in non-turbulent conditions before reaching the settling basin overflow. Median time is always less than the mean time calculated by dividing available volume by anticipated flow. The median time of passage through a short, wide settling basin may be significantly less than that through a long, narrow settling basin. Settling basins with overflow structures near the entrance points may hold a large volume of stagnant water while newly admitted water rapidly reaches the overflow point before settling can occur. Effective surface area for settling seldom extends perpendicularly more than a tenth the distance of a flow line from basin entrance to overflow unless baffles are installed. Effective surface area and geometry may change as accumulating sediment fills part of the originally constructed volume. Short cut channels may rapidly form through heavier sediment accumulations near the entrance to the settling basin. Flow through shallow portions of the settling basin may cause turbulence resuspending sediment from the bottom of the basin. Two feet has been recommended as a minimum settling basin depth to avoid bottom scour.

<text>USS &quot;T-3&quot; (SS-61/SF-3) was an in the service of the United States Navy originally named &quot;AA-3&quot;.

She was laid down as &quot;AA-3&quot; on 21 May 1917 at the Fore River Shipbuilding Company yard in Quincy, Massachusetts, by the Electric Boat Co. of New York, launched on 24 May 1919, sponsored by Mrs. Lilian Terhune Jordan, redesignated SF-3 on 17 July 1920, renamed &quot;T-3&quot; on 22 September 1920, and commissioned on 7 December 1920 at the Boston Navy Yard.

The second of three ships in a program to construct long-range reconnaissance submarines to operate with the surface fleet, &quot;T-3&quot; joined in Submarine Division 15, Atlantic Fleet, soon after commissioning. She operated with that division – later to include – conducting maneuvers with the Atlantic Fleet until the fall of 1922. By that time, flaws in the design and construction of the T-boats – particularly in their propulsion plants – caused them to perform poorly. The decision was made to retire all three to the reserve fleet, and &quot;T-3&quot; was the first to go. On 11 November 1922, she was decommissioned at Hampton Roads, Virginia, and berthed at the submarine base there. Later, she was moved to Philadelphia.

However, &quot;T-3&quot;″s active service did not end there. At the time of the T-boats&#x27; decommissioning, the idea of testing German-produced diesel engines in one of them had been bantered about in Navy circles. &quot;T-1&quot; had originally been designated for this purpose, but funds were not then available. In 1925, when money was forthcoming, it was &quot;T-3&quot; that came out of mothballs for the tests. On 1 October 1925, &quot;T-3&quot; was recommissioned at Philadelphia. For the following 21 months, she tested her newly installed M.A.N. diesel engines for the Bureau of Engineering. Early in the summer of 1927, she completed the tests and, on 14 July 1927, was placed out of commission at Philadelphia. After a little over three years of inactivity, her name was stricken from the Navy List on 19 September 1930. Her hulk was broken up, and the materials were sold for scrap on 20 November 1930.

<doc id="757309" wikidata="Q2615286" url="?curid=757309" title="Animas River">
<text>Animas River (&quot;On-e-mas&quot;; ) is a river in the western United States, a tributary of the San Juan River, part of the Colorado River System.

The river has experienced numerous catastrophes due to the mining nearby, the largest being the 2015 Gold King Mine waste water spill.

==Name==

Spanish explorer Juan Maria de Rivera of Santa Fe recorded the name &quot;Rio de las Animas&quot; (in English, River of Souls) in 1765. One theory is that the full name of the river was once &quot;Rio de las Animas Perdidas&quot; (River of Lost Souls) commemorating people who died in the river. A handful of commentators (3) have suggested that the origin of this river&#x27;s name is confused name with the Purgatoire River of southeastern Colorado.

==Watershed==

The Animas River rises high in San Juan Mountains of Colorado at the confluence of the West and North forks at the ghost town of Animas Forks and flows south past the ghost towns of Eureka and Howardsville. At Silverton, the river flows into the Animas Canyon. The Durango and Silverton Narrow gauge railroad follows the river through the canyon to Durango. From Durango the river flows south into New Mexico through the town of Aztec to its confluence with the San Juan River at Farmington. The only major tributary of the Animas River is the Florida River which converges just north of the Colorado–New Mexico border.

==Indigenous peoples==
The ancestral Puebloan site of Aztec Ruins National Monument is situated along the river in the present day town of Aztec and for much of its course the river flows through native Ute and Navajo lands. The ruins contain the only fully reconstructed Anasazi Kiva, a ceremonial structure, in the US.

==Engineering and development==
The Animas-La Plata Water Project was completed in 2015. The project pumps water over a low pass to fill a reservoir, Lake Nighthorse, in Ridges Basin to satisfy Southern Ute tribal water rights claims associated with the Colorado Ute Settlement Act amendments of 2000.

Numerous irrigation ditches serve the surrounding farmland along the river. The Durango Pumping Plant, completed in 2011, as part of the Animas-La Plata Water Project, draws an average annual of 57,100 acre-feet from the river, for storage in Lake Nighthorse.

A methane seep was reported on the river in Durango, Colorado in 2016.

==Wildlife and plants==
The Animas serves as habitat to resident and migratory bald eagles which arrive in the winter months to take advantage of the ice-free river.

The Animas River is home to rainbow and brown trout, most of which originate from the Animas Trout fishery in Durango. The river is the native home to the mottled sculpin, a bottom-dweller that thrives in clean mountain streams.

==2015 contaminants spill==

In August 2015, the La Plata County Sheriff&#x27;s Office closed the river to the public after a crew working for the EPA released approximately 3 million gallons of mine waste into Cement Creek, a tributary of the Animas. The plug was accidentally removed while investigating a leak at the abandoned Gold King Mine. The mine was last active in the 1920s, but it had been leaking toxic water at a rate of 50 to 250 gallons a minute for years. The spill contained the toxic metals arsenic, cadmium, and lead, as well as the metals aluminum and copper. There may be other toxic heavy metals in the plume.

The spill changed the color of the river to orange, and the spill was described as &quot;devastating&quot; by Kim Stevens, the director of Environment Colorado, who said that businesses who rely on the river for profit might have to close down. The river&#x27;s fish population might also be at risk due to the toxic waste that now runs through the river.

In February 2016, the Associated Press reported that the spill &quot;dumped 880,000 pounds of metals&quot; into the Animas River, and that &quot;most of the metals settled into the riverbed.&quot; The metals considered are &quot;cadmium, copper, lead, mercury, nickel, zinc, and possibly others.&quot;

During an Oversight Committee on September 15, 2015, it was made public that the EPA was aware of the possible blowout of waste from the mine into the river but chose to work around the problem rather than fix it.

==Recreation==

The Animas river is a major white water rafting attraction accounting for 8.9% of Colorado&#x27;s commercial rafting market while annually generating 45,411 commercial user days and direct expenditures of $5,207,033 (2011 est).

The Animas is a freestone fishery well populated with rainbow, brown, Colorado River cutthroat, and brook trout. It is considered a gold medal fishery above Rivera Bridge Crossing in Colorado. Recreational fishing with artificial lures and flies on the Animas is available year-round due to moderate winter weather. Insect hatches of aquatic diptera and mayflies occur in the winter and spring months. In late spring, summer and through fall the Animas sees caddisfly and mayfly hatches as well as terrestrials such as grasshoppers. Animas trout average . Larger trout in the are occasionally caught by anglers. Brown trout as large as have been caught in the Animas.

In the town of Farmington, a 4-mile long trail that runs along the river from Berg Park to Animas Park was listed as a National Recreation Trail in 2011.

Tico Time, a resort/waterpark/concert venue opened in 2023, adding a plethora of activities to the Animas River waterfront.

==Media==
Films have been shot with the Animas River taking center stage. In &quot;Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid&quot;, Robert Redford and Paul Newman leap to safety into the Animas River, not far from Durango. In the film &quot;City Slickers&quot;, the herd of cattle crosses the Animas River, followed by Billy Crystal rescuing a young calf from the river rapids.

The film &quot;The Naked Spur&quot; starring James Steward and Janet Leight was filmed in the area, with a central scene taking place on the Animas River.

<text>The Tenerife goldcrest, &quot;Regulus regulus teneriffae&quot;, (sometimes considered a separate species, &quot;R. teneriffae&quot;) is a very small passerine bird in the kinglet family, closely resembling the goldcrest but with a broader black band across the forehead, slightly darker underparts and a longer bill. It breeds in the Canary Islands of Tenerife and La Gomera, where it is a non-migratory resident. It prefers Canary Island Pine forests, but also occurs in laurisilva forests.

The populations on La Palma and El Hierro, previously thought to belong to this taxon, are now recognized as, at least, a distinct subspecies, the Western Canary Islands goldcrest &quot;R. (r.) ellenthalerae&quot; (Päckert &quot;et al.&quot;, 2006), which evolved from an independent colonisation of the islands.

<doc id="757334" wikidata="Q146871" url="?curid=757334" title="Emirate of Diriyah">
<text>The Emirate of Diriyah (, Imārat Dir&#x27;iyyah), also known as the first Saudi state, was established in February 1727 (1139 AH). In 1744, the emir of a Najdi town called Diriyah, Muhammad bin Saud, and the religious leader Muhammad ibn Abd al-Wahhab signed a pact to found a socio-religious reform movement to propagate the Wahhabi religious doctrine under the political leadership of the House of Saud.

==History==

===Early establishment===
The House of Saud and its allies quickly rose to become the dominant power in Arabia by first conquering Najd, and then expanding their influence over the eastern coast from Kuwait down to the northern borders of Oman. Saud&#x27;s forces also captured the highlands of &#x27;Asir, while Muhammad ibn Abd Al Wahhab wrote letters to people and scholars to join jihad. After many military campaigns, Muhammad bin Saud died in 1765, leaving the leadership to his son, Abdul-Aziz bin Muhammad. Saud&#x27;s forces went so far as to gain command of the Shi&#x27;a holy city of Karbala in 1801. Here they destroyed the shrine of the saints and monuments and killed over 5,000 civilians. In retribution, Abdulaziz was assassinated by a young Shia in 1803, having followed him back to Najd.

Muhammad bin Abd Al Wahhab died in 1792. In 1803, eleven years after his death, the son of Abdulaziz bin Muhammad, Saud bin Abdul-Aziz bin Muhammad bin Saud, sent out forces to bring the region of Hejaz under his rule. Ta&#x27;if was the first city to be captured, and later the two holy cities of Mecca and Medina. This was seen as a major challenge to the authority of the Ottoman Empire, which had exercised its rule over the holy cities since 1517.

===Decline of sovereignty===
The task of weakening the grip of the House of Saud was given to the powerful viceroy of Egypt, Muhammad Ali Pasha, by the Ottomans. This initiated the Ottoman–Saudi War, in which Muhammad Ali sent his troops to the Hejaz region by sea. His son, Ibrahim Pasha, then led Ottoman forces into the heart of Nejd, capturing town after town. Saud&#x27;s successor, his son Abdullah bin Saud, was unable to prevent the recapture of the region. Finally, Ibrahim reached the Saudi capital at Diriyah and placed it under siege for several months until it surrendered in the winter of 1818. Ibrahim then shipped off many members of the clans of Al Saud to Egypt and the Ottoman capital, Istanbul. Abdullah bin Saud was later executed in the Ottoman capital Istanbul with his severed head later thrown into the waters of the Bosphorus, marking the end of what was known as the First Saudi State. However, both the followers of the Wahhabi movement and the remaining members of the Al Saud clan stayed committed. They founded a Second Saudi State that lasted until 1891, and later a third state, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, which the Al Saud continue to rule up to the present day.

==List of rulers==
* Emir Muhammad bin Saud 1727–1765 (1139–1179 H)
* Emir Abdulaziz bin Muhammad 1765–1803 (1179–1218 H)
* Emir Saud bin Abdulaziz 1803–1814 (1218–1229 H)
* Emir Abdullah bin Saud 1814–1818 (1229–1233 H)

<doc id="757336" wikidata="Q311648" url="?curid=757336" title="Dan Wheldon">
<text>Daniel Clive Wheldon (22 June 1978 – 16 October 2011) was a British motor racing driver who won the 2005 IndyCar Series Drivers&#x27; Championship for Andretti Green Racing (AGR). He won the Indianapolis 500 in 2005 and 2011, and was co-winner of the 2006 24 Hours of Daytona with Chip Ganassi Racing (CGR).

Wheldon began competitive karting at the age of eight and achieved early success, before progressing to open-wheel car racing in the U.S. F2000 National Championship, the Toyota Atlantic Championship and Indy Lights. He began driving in IndyCar with Panther Racing in 2002. The following year, Wheldon moved to AGR, finishing as runner-up in the 2004 championship. He won the drivers&#x27; title in 2005 with the record for most victories (including that year&#x27;s Indianapolis 500) during a season. In the 2006 season, he moved to CGR, tying Sam Hornish Jr. in points but finishing second because of count-back on the number of victories taken by both drivers. During the 2007 and 2008 seasons, Wheldon&#x27;s form lowered but he won four additional races to place fourth overall in both years.

He returned to Panther Racing for the 2009 and 2010 seasons, failing to win a race but taking a further four podium results during this period. Wheldon left the team at the conclusion of the season. He drove part-time for Bryan Herta Autosport and later Sam Schmidt Motorsports in the 2011 season. He won his second Indianapolis 500 in May of that year. At the season-ending IZOD IndyCar World Championship at Las Vegas Motor Speedway, Wheldon was killed in a collision with a fence post alongside the circuit on the race&#x27;s eleventh lap. He was 33 years old and the first driver to die in IndyCar competition since Paul Dana in 2006.

==Early and personal life==
Wheldon was born in the village of Emberton near the town of Olney, Buckinghamshire, England on 22 June 1978. He was the son of plumber and domestic heat electrician Clive Wheldon and his wife Sue. Wheldon was of Irish descent. He had three younger brothers and a sister. Wheldon&#x27;s family was connected to motorsport; his father had competed in karting from an early age and his mother acted as Clive&#x27;s timekeeper. He went to the Bedford School until he completed his GCSE examinations at the age of 16. Wheldon attained good reading grades and excelled in cross-country running, rugby and squash. He was also captain of the school cricket team.

He married his long-time personal assistant Susie Behm of Armstrong, British Columbia, in 2008. They have two children, Sebastian and Oliver, who compete in go-karting events. Their sons have been supported by Andretti Autosport since 2021.

Wheldon was a guest voice over for the television series &quot;Hot Wheels Battle Force 5,&quot; and assisted in the physics development for Ignite Game Technologies&#x27; online simulation racing game &quot;Simraceway&quot;. He partook in philanthropic activities, such as raising money for Alzheimer&#x27;s disease research, contributed to the Sam Schmidt Paralysis Foundation, and met unwell children at the Peyton Manning Children&#x27;s Cancer Hospital in Indianapolis every year. Wheldon was a spokesperson for the National Guard&#x27;s Youth Challenge Program, which provides services to vulnerable young Americans. He edited and published a coffee table book of photographs of his life, called &quot;Lionheart&quot; in 2010.

==Junior career==
Wheldon began go-kart racing at the age of four but did not partake in competitive racing until he was eight due to age limits. He drove a self-built 60cc kart during the intervals before switching to a 100cc kart later on. Wheldon was inspired by racing driver Nigel Mansell, and he was sponsored by All Kart owner Bruno Ferrari and his father helped to better his son&#x27;s driving ability at Rye House Kart Circuit. He won the RAC British Cadet Karting Championship three times in 1988, 1989 and 1990. Wheldon went on to win the British B Junior title driving a Wright chassis in 1992. He was later advised by Mark Rose and Terry Fullerton as he progressed to the international level. Wheldon won the 1995 FIA Formula A World Cup with Fullerton&#x27;s team. Aged 17, he progressed to car racing, competing in the Formula Vauxhall Junior Championship for Team JLR in 1996, winning the Brands Hatch, Silverstone and Oulton Park races and taking seven top-three results to finish second overall.

The following year, Wheldon was fourth in both the British Formula Ford Championship and the European Formula Ford Championship for Andy Welch Racing, with three victories in the British series. He was named a finalist for the McLaren Autosport BRDC Young Driver of the Year Award in 1996 and 1997. Wheldon improved to third in those two series with the Van Diemen team, driving a Mygale in 1998. That year, he finished second in the Formula Ford Festival at Brands Hatch. It was during this period he developed a rivalry with fellow driver and future Formula One World Champion Jenson Button. Wheldon did not have the necessary level of funding from his father and sponsors to further his career in the United Kingdom and progress into either the British Formula 3 International Series or the British Formula Renault Championship.

At the suggestion of his former team principal and car manufacturer Ralph Firman Sr., he flew to the United States in January 1999 to test a Formula Ford 2000 car. Wheldon also observed an Indy Lights and Toyota Atlantic test session for future preparation. His funding was provided by Jayhard/Primus Racing owner Jon Baytos and Van Diemen. He competed in the U.S. F2000 National Championship in 1999 in Jayhard/Primus Racing&#x27;s Van Diemen Ford RF99 car, achieving six wins and eleven top-ten finishes to become the first British and European series champion. Wheldon&#x27;s early performance was affected by jet lag from constant travel to the United Kingdom to visit his family and his desire to compete in Formula Three. He stopped doing so after about three months, when Baytos urged him to concentrate on racing. Wheldon was named the series&#x27; Rookie of the Year, and was inducted into its Hall of Fame in 2012 as a 1999 graduate.

He progressed to the 2000 Toyota Atlantic Championship, driving for PPI Motorsports in its 3 Swift 008.a vehicle, winning the season-opening Homestead–Miami Speedway round to become the first driver in series history to win on his debut. He won the Laguna Seca race, finishing runner-up in the championship standings with 159 points and a further nine top-ten finishes. Wheldon was named the series&#x27; Rookie of the Year. For the 2001 season, Wheldon moved to the PacWest Lights team to compete in the higher-tier Indy Lights Championship. In the No. 1 Lola T97/20-Buick 3800 V6, he won two races in the championship&#x27;s second half (Gateway Motorsports Park and Road Atlanta) and placed in the top-ten in all twelve events to finish runner-up in the drivers&#x27; championship with 149 points. Wheldon was named the 2001 Indy Lights Rookie of the Year.

==IndyCar Series==

===2002–2004===
After his objective of obtaining a seat in Championship Auto Racing Teams (later Champ Car World Series) went unfulfilled, he began his association with the rival Indy Racing League (IRL) by joining Panther Racing as its test driver in June 2002. He brought capital to the team and drove their second car for the final two races of the 2002 season. Wheldon qualified seventh in the No. 15 Dallara IR02 Chevrolet V8 and finished tenth in his first IRL race, the Delphi Indy 300 at Chicagoland Speedway. He came 15th in the season-closing Chevy 500 at Texas Motor Speedway to finish his two-race campaign 36th in the points standings with 35 accrued. When funding for a second Panther Racing car fell through, Andretti Green Racing (AGR) co-owner Kim Green contacted Wheldon in October and asked him to test its IRL car and develop its Honda engine at Homestead–Miami Speedway the following month. Wheldon was signed to be the team&#x27;s test driver in November as they sought sponsorship to enable his participation in the 2003 season.

The lack of sponsorship prevented him from starting the season though he was called up to drive when regular driver Dario Franchitti broke his vertebrae in a motor bike accident in Scotland. In his first race driving the No. 27 Dallara IR-03 Honda HI3R V8 car, at the Indy Japan 300 at Twin Ring Motegi, Wheldon qualified fifth and finished the accident-shortened race seventh. Wheldon qualified fifth for his first Indianapolis 500. Late in the race, he struck a concrete retaining wall and somersaulted into the air before landing upside down, which relegated him to finishing 19th. After Franchitti returned, Wheldon was retained as a driver following the retirement of team owner and mentor Michael Andretti. He drove well thereafter with another eight top-ten finishes. Starting tenth at Chicagoland Speedway, Wheldon led for a season-high 38 laps and came fourth. He ended the season finishing third at Texas Motor Speedway, scoring 312 points for 11th in the point standings. Wheldon&#x27;s performances enhanced his reputation, and he demonstrated an accord with oval track racing that many European drivers lacked. He was awarded the 2003 IndyCar Rookie of the Year, and was voted the 2003 Autosport Rookie of the Year.

Wheldon returned to AGR for the 2004 season. At Phoenix International Raceway, the season&#x27;s second race, Wheldon won his first career pole position and finished third. He took his first series win at Twin Ring Motegi, leading an event-high 192 laps from pole position. Wheldon qualified second for the Indianapolis 500; he led 26 laps to finish the rain-shortened race third. His second win of the season came at Richmond International Raceway after holding off Team Penske&#x27;s Hélio Castroneves on the last lap. Wheldon took four top-ten finishes in four of the next six races, before achieving his third series victory in Nazareth Speedway&#x27;s final motor race to move into second in the drivers&#x27; championship. His title challenge to his teammate Tony Kanaan ended in the season&#x27;s penultimate round at California Speedway, but secured second overall from Buddy Rice at the season-ending Texas Motor Speedway race with 533 points.

===2005–2007===
For the 2005 season, Wheldon again drove for AGR. He started from eleventh to lead a race-high 158 of 200 laps of the Homestead–Miami Speedway season-opener to win. After that, Wheldon went on to win consecutive races at the Grand Prix of St. Petersburg (his first road course series win), and the Indy Japan 300 for the second successive year. His season highlight was the Indianapolis 500 where he exchanged the lead with Danica Patrick until she slowed due to a lack of fuel. Wheldon made the race-victory overtake with seven laps to go to become the first British driver to win the event since Graham Hill in 1966. He continued to drive consistently in the top six in the next seven races. At Pikes Peak International Raceway, Wheldon took his fifth win of the season (after leading 67 laps) to equal Sam Hornish Jr.&#x27;s 2002 record of five victories during a season. Two races later, at Chicagoland Speedway, he led a race-high 88 laps to surpass Hornish&#x27;s series record with his sixth win of the year. Wheldon won the championship before starting the season&#x27;s penultimate round by setting a single practice lap of Watkins Glen International. Since the last place finisher scored 12 points, his 102-point lead clinched the title with one race remaining. With a sixth-place finish at the season-closing California Speedway round, Wheldon won the championship with 628 points. He was awarded the 2005 Autosport British Competition Driver of the Year.

When Chip Ganassi Racing (CGR) owner Chip Ganassi was informed of rumours that Wheldon might leave AGR, he engaged in informal discussions with him, which led to an agreement in principle at a meeting in August 2005. His AGR contract expired on 31 October and formal discussions began soon after. CGR resigned Wheldon for the 2006 season and the team changed manufacturers from Panoz to Dallara and engine suppliers to Honda after Toyota withdrew. Wheldon made the switch because he wanted to ensure his stay in the IRL and remain competitive. To begin the season, Wheldon won the Toyota Indy 300 at Homestead–Miami Speedway. At the Indianapolis 500, he qualified in third place, and led a race-high 148 laps before falling to fourth because he had to make a pit stop to replace a puncture on the 183rd lap. Wheldon achieved eight top-ten finishes and two pole positions (at Kansas Speedway and Nashville Speedway), and entered the season&#x27;s final round at Chicagoland Speedway as one of four drivers in contention for the championship. Wheldon won the race but lost the championship on tiebreak to Sam Hornish Jr, who had won four races to Wheldon&#x27;s two.

Wheldon remained with CGR for the 2007 season. He began the season with pole position at the season-opening XM Satellite Radio Indy 300 at Homestead–Miami Speedway, and led 177 of 200 laps to win his third successive event at the track, a new series record. Wheldon went on to lead a race-high 177 laps to win the Kansas Lottery Indy 300 at Kansas Speedway, his second of the season. After qualifying sixth for the Indianapolis 500, he retired from the rain-shortened race after a late-event collision with Marco Andretti, losing Wheldon the lead of the drivers&#x27; championship. His third-place finish in the ABC Supply Company A.J. Foyt 225 at Milwaukee Mile was overshadowed by a physical confrontation with Patrick following a collision on the 88th lap; the two reconciled after a private meeting with IndyCar president Brian Barnhart. The rest of Wheldon&#x27;s season was modest, with four retirements and two further third-place finishes in the SunTrust Indy Challenge and the Detroit Indy Grand Prix. He came fourth in the final points standings with 466 accrued.

===2008–2011===
For the 2008 season, Wheldon stayed with CGR. He began the year finishing third at the season-opening Gainsco Auto Insurance Indy 300 at Homestead–Miami Speedway after moving through the field starting from 22nd. Wheldon won the RoadRunner Turbo Indy 300 at Kansas Speedway three races later, becoming IndyCar&#x27;s first driver to claim two consecutive victories at the track. He started second in the Indianapolis 500 finishing ten places lower in twelfth due to handling problems in the final 50 laps. Wheldon took his second (and final) victory of the season in the Iowa Corn Indy 250 at Iowa Speedway. He donated his winnings to help the victims of the recent tornadoes and flooding which had occurred in Iowa. As IndyCar had become more orientated towards road and street circuits following the merger of it and the Champ Car World Series, his performance diminished in the remaining races since his driving on such tracks were not as good as on ovals. He achieved one further podium finish, a second-place at Nashville Speedway, and five top-seven finishes for fourth in the drivers&#x27; championship with 492 points.

Wheldon planned to extend his CGR contract when Chip Ganassi provided him with an offer in May 2008. He decided against doing so when he learnt AGR&#x27;s Kanaan had begun discussions with the team. Though Kanaan ultimately ended up staying with AGR, Wheldon felt betrayed and began talking to other teams. Wheldon told CGR three months later in Detroit of his decision to leave them at the season&#x27;s conclusion. On 2 September, CGR announced that Wheldon would be released from his contract at the end of the season as Dario Franchitti left NASCAR and returned to IndyCar. Wheldon returned to the full-time one-car Panther Racing team for the 2009 season following an agreement with his management and team owner John Barnes in mid-August. He struggled to perform in the first three races, but he took his first top-ten finish with a fifth at the Toyota Grand Prix of Long Beach. At the Indianapolis 500, Wheldon qualified in eighteenth and finished second. The rest of Wheldon&#x27;s season saw him achieve a best finish of fourth at Iowa Speedway and three top-tens. He did not attain those results in seven of the last eight races. He was tenth in the championship standings with 354 points, his lowest finish since he placed eleventh in 2003.

Wheldon remained with Panther Racing for the 2010 season. During the season-opening São Paulo Indy 300, he made contact with Alex Tagliani, which sent him into Kanaan; he recovered to finish fifth. Three races later at the Toyota Grand Prix of Long Beach, Wheldon took a second top-ten result with a ninth. In the Indianapolis 500, Wheldon started from eighteenth. He advanced through the field on pit stop strategy to come second for the second year in a row. Wheldon remained competitive all year; challenging for wins on oval tracks. Despite strong showings, he could not claim a race victory during his time with Panther Racing, which frustrated Barnes. In the Indy Grand Prix of Sonoma at Infineon Raceway (now Sonoma Raceway), Wheldon made contact with Bertrand Baguette&#x27;s car during a warm-up lap before the start of the event. He flipped upside down and pirouetted several times but emerged unhurt. His best finish of the year was a second place in the Peak Antifreeze &amp; Motor Oil Indy 300 at Chicagoland Speedway. He came ninth at the season-ending Cafés do Brasil Indy 300 at Homestead–Miami Speedway, to rank ninth in the drivers&#x27; standings with 388 points.

After the season, Wheldon left Panther Racing because of a lack of sponsorship and the No. 4 car was driven by rookie J. R. Hildebrand. He filed a $383,400 lawsuit against Barnes in Marion County Superior Court on 18 August for late payment of his salary and of his share of earnings from his on-track achievements as well as taxation issues. The two reached a settlement on 1 October. Wheldon did not have a full-time seat for the 2011 season, and he missed the season&#x27;s first four races as he sought employment with another team to compete in the Indianapolis 500. Talks with several teams, including with Dreyer &amp; Reinbold Racing co-owner Robbie Buhl to share a car with Mike Conway fell through. He then spoke to his friend and former AGR teammate Bryan Herta who offered to assemble a car from his own low-budget operation, Bryan Herta Autosport (BHA), for Wheldon and he agreed. He drove a Dallara car from 2003 leased to Herta by BHA&#x27;s technical partner Sam Schmidt Motorsports and Curb-Agajanian Motorsports. He qualified in sixth place; in the race, Wheldon was in second place on the final lap when Hildebrand crashed leaving turn four. He took the lead to become the first driver to win the Indianapolis 500 leading only the final lap.

Wheldon&#x27;s contract expired at midnight on 30 May. He then became a color commentator and pit lane reporter for the cable television channel Versus (now NBCSN) for three IndyCar Series events (Iowa, Texas and Toronto), believing he would not race again in 2011. He impressed viewers with his expertise, quick wit and ease in interacting with other commentators. Wheldon was also employed by IndyCar, car manufacturer Dallara and designer Tony Cotman to test and develop the official prototype model of a new one-specification chassis that debuted at the beginning of the 2012 season. In early October, he drove Tagliani&#x27;s No. 77 Sam Schmidt Motorsports car for the Kentucky Indy 300 at Kentucky Speedway as preparation for the season-ending IZOD IndyCar World Championship at Las Vegas Motor Speedway. Wheldon qualified in 28th-place after failing to set a qualifying time because his car did not pass a technical inspection; he finished 14th. On the morning of 16 October, he signed a multi-year contract to replace Patrick at Andretti Autosport from 2012 on.

==Other racing ventures==
Wheldon made his endurance racing debut at the 2005 24 Hours of Daytona, sharing the No. 2 Howard-Boss Motorsports Pontiac Crawford DP03 with Dario Franchitti, Marino Franchitti and Milka Duno in the Daytona Prototype (DP) class. Their car finished 16th in its class and 33rd overall after Duno crashed with less than six hours to go. In the 2005 off-season, he competed as a wild card entrant in the 2005 Race of Champions, being eliminated from the round of 16 by Sébastien Bourdais. That year, he was offered a test driver role with BMW&#x27;s Formula One squad by team principal Mario Theissen. He declined when he discovered that he would not be assured a race seat for the season; he also felt emotionally attached to the United States. Wheldon also turned down an offer to compete for Great Britain in the inaugural A1 Grand Prix season.

In 2006, Wheldon returned to compete in the season-opening 24 Hours of Daytona for Chip Ganassi Racing with Scott Dixon and Casey Mears in the DP class. The trio won overall, completing 734 laps in the No. 02 Riley MkXI Lexus. He returned with the same team for the following year&#x27;s race, again partnered by Dixon, and they were joined by Memo Rojas. The trio retired after 538 laps because Rojas crashed the No. 2 entry on the saturated track in the race&#x27;s 21st hour. They were classified 21st in class and 41st overall. Wheldon returned for a fourth time to participate in the 24 Hours of Daytona for Chip Ganassi Racing with Dixon, Alex Lloyd and Salvador Durán. Their car, starting in tenth in its category and overall, finished 44th overall (18th in its class) after it retired with 515 laps completed due to sustaining three accidents during the event.

==Death==

IndyCar Series CEO Randy Bernard set up a challenge for the season-ending 2011 IZOD IndyCar World Championship at Las Vegas Motor Speedway on 16 October. A prize of $5 million would be divided equally between a driver and a randomly selected fan if the driver won from the back of the grid. He was unable to get an international racing driver so he offered the challenge to Wheldon who accepted. He was frustrated about his car being more than slower than others and felt it would be difficult to remain with the pack if the issue was not resolved. Wheldon was also ABC&#x27;s in-race reporter and spoke in defence of his participation in the event and IndyCar to the network&#x27;s commentary team during the warm-up laps. On lap 11 out of the planned 200, a fifteen-car accident occurred between turns one and two in which Wheldon was involved. The accident began when James Hinchcliffe was clipped by Wade Cunningham. Cunningham and J. R. Hildebrand then collided when Cunningham swerved and Hildebrand drove over the rear of his car. Hildebrand&#x27;s car became airborne and Cunningham collected Jay Howard on the inside and then Townsend Bell on the outside before crashing into the wall. Attempting to avoid the crash ahead, Vítor Meira lost control, spinning inward collecting both Charlie Kimball and E. J. Viso. At the same time Meira lost control, Tomas Scheckter was also attempting to avoid the first crash by rapidly slowing down on the outside. This led to Paul Tracy crashing into the back of Scheckter and a rapidly approaching Pippa Mann to launch over the top of Tracy after jerking to the outside to avoid crashing into Alex Lloyd. Wheldon was in 24th and travelling on the left-hand side of the track at in an attempt to avoid the pile-up and flying debris. Meira, Kimball and Viso blocked Wheldon&#x27;s path, and he decelerated to 10% of throttle usage before he hit the left-rear tyre of Kimball&#x27;s car at . He was launched semi-airborne for approximately and rotated towards the right-hand side catchfence.

Wheldon&#x27;s vehicle rotated and travelled parallel to the catchfence above the concrete wall behind the SAFER barrier alongside the track. He collided with a fence post along his car&#x27;s right-hand side, creating a deep defect in the chassis that went from the upper pedal bulkhead and through the cockpit. That deformed its roll hoop and the top of the chassis above the fuel cell compartment, which were sheared from the car. The post penetrated the cockpit and struck the lower portion of the right-hand side of Wheldon&#x27;s helmet in an impact measured at −30Gs lateral, 47Gs longitudinal, and −25Gs vertical to the chassis as he sustained &quot;two distinct impacts&quot; to his head. The race was stopped after one caution lap. He was extricated from his car by the trackside safety team and airlifted to the University Medical Center of Southern Nevada for his critical injuries. Wheldon was pronounced dead on arrival. After input from drivers and team owners, officials declared they would abandon the race. A five-lap, three-wide formation salute was held in Wheldon&#x27;s honour, along with &quot;Danny Boy&quot; and &quot;Amazing Grace&quot; played on the bagpipes in the background. His No. 77 was displayed alone atop of the scoring pylon.

An autopsy conducted by the Clark County Coroner Michael Murphy on 17 October determined that Wheldon died of a blunt trauma to his head. He was the first driver to be killed in IndyCar competition since Paul Dana died in an accident during practice for the 2006 Toyota Indy 300 at Homestead–Miami Speedway. On 22 October, Wheldon was given a funeral at the First Presbyterian Church of St. Petersburg attended by almost 1,000 mourners. Fellow drivers Franchitti, Dixon, Kanaan and Wheldon&#x27;s three brothers acted as pall-bearers. The next day, IndyCar held a public memorial service for him at Conseco Fieldhouse (now Gainbridge Fieldhouse) in Indianapolis attended by members of the motor racing community and his family and fans. A second memorial service for Wheldon took place at the All Saints&#x27; Church in his home town of Emberton on 6 November. He is buried at the Calvary Catholic Cemetery in Clearwater, Florida.

Three days after the accident, series&#x27; organisers with assistance from the Automobile Competition Committee for the United States, the United States&#x27; national governing body of motor racing, and motorsport&#x27;s world governing body, the Fédération Internationale de l&#x27;Automobile, began subjecting the race to a full investigation. The results of the investigation into Wheldon&#x27;s death were released on 15 December 2011. According to the report, there was no single cause for Wheldon&#x27;s crash. Contributing factors included the catchfence around the track, and the unlimited track movement while racing that increased contact between cars, making it difficult to predict what would occur around the drivers, and increased the likelihood of a major accident. &quot;Whilst several factors coincided to produce a perfect storm, none of them can be singled out as the sole cause of the accident. For this reason it is impossible to determine with certainty that the result would have been any different if one or more of the factors did not exist.&quot;

==Personality and legacy==
Marcus Simmons, a writer for the British motor racing magazine &quot;Autosport&quot;, called Wheldon &quot;one of a golden crop of richly-talented British drivers to graduate from karting to junior single-seaters in the mid to late-1990s&quot;, and, &quot;a man who embodied the ideal of the immigrant to the &#x27;New World&#x27; fulfilling the American Dream.&quot; Although he had a brash and confident persona that made him &quot;cocky yet likeable&quot;, journalist Maurice Hamilton noted that Wheldon was seen by many as &quot;a devoted family man, deeply respected and universally liked despite, or perhaps because of, a cheeky sense of self-awareness and a clever cultivation of his image&quot;. He had charisma, a sense of humour and warmth that made him a favourite amongst motor racing fans and the media, despite being unrecognisable in England due to Formula One being the country&#x27;s most popular motor racing series. Wheldon was a keen learner, and was focused on accomplishing his objectives.

Two days after his death, Dallara named their new one-specification chassis in Wheldon&#x27;s honour. The DW12, with the new bumper/nerf bar section being featured, was designed to prevent many similar single-seater crashes such as the one that killed him. A charity race in Wheldon&#x27;s honour was held in Milton Keynes on 6 December with drivers such as Franchitti, Jenson Button and Anthony Davidson competing. Proceeds from the event were donated to a charity selected by Wheldon&#x27;s family. That month, Wheldon was posthumously awarded the Gregor Grant Award for his lifetime career achievements that his father Clive and Franchitti collected. Former racing driver Mark Dismore&#x27;s New Castle Motorsports Park, which organises the Robo-Pong 200 endurance karting event that Wheldon won in 2005, named the trophy the Dan Wheldon Cup in 2012. The Wheldon family added a Wheldon Memorial Pro-Am to the event in 2013. On 7 March 2012, Wheldon&#x27;s widow Susie and mayor Bill Foster unveiled a street sign in St. Petersburg, Florida. Named &quot;Dan Wheldon Way&quot;, the sign was placed at the corner of Bayshore Drive and Albert Whitted Park (turn ten). A permanent memorial is also located across from the Salvador Dalí Museum.

Franchitti won the 2012 Indianapolis 500 on 27 May and dedicated his victory to Wheldon and wore white sunglasses in his honour. That year Wheldon was memorialised by a resolution passed by the Indiana Senate. A memorial plaque featuring his likeness and career achievements was unveiled in St. Petersburg outside the second turn of its street track in March 2013 and a wall in which each of the winners of the race was etched. Four months later, &quot;Autosport&quot; magazine named Wheldon one of the 50 greatest drivers to have never raced in Formula One. The Wheldons were honoured with the &quot;Dan and Susie Wheldon Make a Difference Award&quot; in September 2014. This included a $1,000 donation to charity and became part of the annual IndyCar Series prize-giving banquet. During the 2016 Kobalt 400 at Las Vegas Motor Speedway, pit lane reporter Jamie Little and motorsport publicist Brent Brush placed a Dan Wheldon Memorial plaque outside turn two, near the point where he was killed. In May 2016, a book on his life and career with contributions from the motor racing community entitled &quot;Lionheart: Remembering Dan Wheldon&quot; was published. Wheldon was inducted into the Indianapolis Motor Speedway Hall of Fame in May 2019. His death and legacy are the subject of the 2023 sports documentary &quot;The Lionheart&quot;.

=== Dan Wheldon International Driver Trophy ===
The Dan Wheldon International Driver Trophy was awarded to the best performing international driver over the race weekend of the Australian V8 Supercars Gold Coast 600. The trophy was named after Wheldon following his death, which took place a week prior to the 2011 event in which he was scheduled to participate with the Holden Racing Team. The international drivers&#x27; trophy had been unnamed when it debuted in 2010. The trophy was discontinued after 2012 when regulation changes removed the need for compulsory international co-drivers in the race.

<text>Toxic Narcotic is an American crust punk band from Boston, Massachusetts, United States, who formed in 1989. Though many label them crust or hardcore, they do not self-identify with any one specific subgenre of DIY punk. Their songs typically include anti-war, -violence, and green peace lyrics. Their name, as revealed in an interview with Vice, is associated with the movement, the lead singer saying &quot;... The name means what is says. Narcotics, chemicals, and ignorance are toxic, not just to the human mind, but also to humanity in general.&quot; Most of their albums have been released on their label, Rodent Popsicle Records. The album &quot;We&#x27;re All Doomed&quot; was released in 2002 on Go-Kart Records and a split CD with Misery was released in 2004, also on Go-Kart Records. Their 15th anniversary show in December, 2004, was filmed by Subversion Media and released on Rodent Popsicle Records. The band toured the United States and Europe extensively through their career. In 2005, the band performed at North East Sticks Together. Later that year, Toxic Narcotic went on hiatus and two of its members, Bill Damon and Will Sullivan, formed the band Mouth Sewn Shut. Bill Damon, the vocalist, runs Rodent Popsicle Records. Sam Jodrey, the drummer, hurt his back in 2008 and all following shows had to be cancelled. The band is referenced in the song &quot;I Just Saw the Gayest Guy on Earth&quot; by AxCx, in which the narrator of the song states that the titular character hangs out with them regularly, which is one of the reasons why he is the most homosexual man on Earth.

<doc id="757338" wikidata="Q153909" url="?curid=757338" title="Milovan Djilas">
<text>Milovan Djilas (; , ; 12 June 1911 – 20 April 1995) was a Yugoslav communist politician, theorist and author. He was a key figure in the Partisan movement during World War II, as well as in the post-war government. A self-identified democratic socialist, Djilas became one of the best-known and most prominent dissidents in Yugoslavia and all of Eastern Europe.

==Early life and revolutionary activities==

Milovan Djilas was born in Podbišće near Mojkovac in the Kingdom of Montenegro on 12 June 1911, into a peasant family. He was the fourth of nine children. His father Nikola, a recipient of the Obilić Medal for bravery, served in the Montenegrin Army during the Balkan Wars of 1912–1913, then World War I, after which he was awarded the Albanian Commemorative Medal. After that war he commanded the gendarmerie in Kolašin, and opposed the incorporation of Montenegro into the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes. His paternal grandfather, Aleksa, was an anti-Ottoman bandit leader, known as a , who was apparently assassinated at the direction of the Montenegrin king&#x27;s father-in-law. Djilas&#x27;s mother, Novka, was from Siberia in the Russian Empire. During World War II, Djilas&#x27;s sister Dobrinka was murdered by the Chetniks and his father was killed during a battle with the Balli Kombëtar in Kosovo.

Djilas was educated in Podbišće, Kolašin and Berane. He was exposed to literature during his schooling, and also to the works of Karl Marx and Vladimir Lenin. He commenced studying literature at the University of Belgrade in 1929, by which time he was already a committed communist. In 1929, the name of the country changed to the Kingdom of Yugoslavia. Djilas was a radical student activist and opposed the dictatorship of King Alexander I. This brought him to the attention of the police; in March 1932 he was arrested for taking part in an anti-government demonstration and was jailed for eight days as a warning. Eleven months later, having not changed his ways, Djilas was again arrested, but this time he was tortured then sentenced to three years imprisonment in the Sremska Mitrovica Prison. While in jail he met several senior members of the Communist Party of Yugoslavia (, KPJ), including Moša Pijade and Aleksandar Ranković. He was further radicalised while in jail, becoming a committed Stalinist.

After his release from prison in 1936, Djilas decided to give up his study of literature and concentrate on revolutionary activities with the KPJ. When the leader of the Soviet Union, Josef Stalin, tried to gain greater control of the KPJ, Djilas aligned himself with the general secretary of the KPJ, Josip Broz Tito. Djilas also helped recruit about 1,500 Yugoslav volunteers to fight on the Republican side in the Spanish Civil War, but Tito would not permit him to travel to Spain to take part in the war as he needed him in Yugoslavia. In 1938, Tito appointed him to the Central Committee of the KPJ, and to its politburo the following year.

== World War II ==
===Uprising in Montenegro===

In April 1941, Axis powers Nazi Germany, Fascist Italy and the Kingdom of Hungary invaded Yugoslavia and quickly defeated her armed forces. Yugoslavia was partitioned, and as part of this, most of modern Montenegro was subjected to military occupation by the Italians, who installed a civil commissioner. Initially the Italians were lenient towards the Montenegrins, but local people quickly developed grievances against them, relating to expulsions of Montenegrin people from elsewhere in occupied Yugoslavia, an influx of Serb refugees fleeing Ustaše persecution in the neighboring Independent State of Croatia, loss of traditionally Montenegrin territory and financial restrictions imposed on them.

Around 400 former Yugoslav Army officers returned to Montenegro, along with many non-commissioned officers, civil administrators and KPJ members. During the invasion, the Yugoslav Zeta Division, composed mostly of Montenegrins, had briefly counter-attacked into Albania, but had largely returned home with their weapons and equipment following the Yugoslav surrender.

Djilas helped Josip Broz Tito to establish the Yugoslav Partisan resistance and became a guerrilla commander during the war following Germany&#x27;s attack on the Soviet Union on 22 June 1941 (Operation Barbarossa) when the Communist Party of Yugoslavia&#x27;s (KPJ) Central Committee decided that conditions had been created for armed struggle.

On 4 July, the KPJ passed the resolution to begin the uprising. Djilas was sent to Montenegro to organize and raise the struggle against the Italian occupying force, which on 12 July 1941 proclaimed the fascist puppet entity Kingdom of Montenegro, to be run by Sekula Drljević and closely controlled by the Italian authority of Alessandro Biroli, Mussolini&#x27;s confidant. Djilas had an important role in the Uprising in Montenegro which was a national example, spanning ideological lines. Large parts of Montenegro were quickly liberated. Djilas remained in Montenegro until November.

===&quot;Borba&quot;===
In early November 1941, Tito dismissed Djilas from the command of Partisan forces in Montenegro because of his mistakes during the uprising, including what were called his &quot;leftist errors&quot;. Tito emphasized that Djilas made mistakes because he organized a frontal struggle of armies against a much stronger enemy, instead of connecting the Partisan struggle with the people&#x27;s uprising, and adopting the Partisan methods of resistance. Djilas was appointed as editor of the paper &quot;Borba&quot;, the Party&#x27;s main propaganda organ.

Djilas left for the communist-controlled town of Užice in Serbia, where he took up his work for &quot;Borba&quot;. Following the withdrawal of Supreme Commander Tito and other Party leaders to Bosnia, Djilas stayed in Nova Varoš in the Raška (on the border between Serbia and Montenegro). From there he retreated with the units under his command, in the middle of winter and in difficult conditions, to join the Supreme Staff. At this time, the Partisans did not have serious divisions between communists and non-communists.

===Civil war and state-building===

In March 1942, Djilas returned to Montenegro, where a civil war between Partisans and Chetniks had broken out. The historian Momčilo Cemović, who has dealt mostly with this period of Djilas&#x27;s war activities, believed that the CPY Central Committee and the Supreme Staff had sent Djilas to ascertain the actual state of affairs and to dismiss the communist leaders responsible.

In March 1944, he went as part of the military- and party-mission to the Soviet Union. During this time he met with Georgi Dimitrov, Vyacheslav Molotov and Joseph Stalin, among others.

Returning to Yugoslavia, he fought with the Partisans to liberate Belgrade from the Wehrmacht. With the establishment of the Federal People&#x27;s Republic of Yugoslavia, Djilas became Vice-president in Tito&#x27;s government. Djilas later claimed to have been sent at that time to pressure the Italians to withdraw from Istria.

Djilas was sent to Moscow to meet Stalin again in 1948 to try and bridge the gap between Moscow and Belgrade. He became one of the leading critics of attempts by Stalin to bring Yugoslavia under greater control by Moscow. Later that year, Yugoslavia broke with the Soviet Union and left the Cominform, ushering in the &quot;Informbiro&quot; period.

Initially the Yugoslav communists, despite the break with Stalin, remained as hard line as before. But they began to pursue a policy of independent socialism that experimented with self-management of workers in state-run enterprises. Djilas was very much part of that, but he began to take things further. Having responsibility for propaganda, he created a platform for new ideas and he launched a new journal, &quot;Nova Misao&quot; (&quot;New Thought&quot;), in which he published a series of articles that were increasingly freethinking.

==Dissident==
Djilas was widely regarded as Tito&#x27;s possible successor and in 1953 he was about to be chosen as President of Yugoslavia. He became President of the Federal People&#x27;s Assembly of Yugoslavia, but he only held office from 25 December 1953 to 16 January 1954. Between October 1953 and January 1954, he wrote 19 articles (only 18 were published) for &quot;Borba&quot;, the official newspaper of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia, wherein, encouraged by Tito, he developed the Yugoslav critique of over-bureaucratic Stalinism in the Soviet Union, in favour of a shift away from central planning towards more economic autonomy.

His advocacy of greater democratic input into decision-making led him eventually to argue against the one-party state itself, suggesting a relaxation of party discipline, and the retirement of the state officials he saw as profiteering from their position and blocking the road to further reform. At that point, Tito and other leading Yugoslav communists saw Djilas&#x27;s arguments as a threat to their leadership. In January 1954. Djilas was expelled from the Central Committee of the party, of which he had been a member since 1937, and dismissed from all political functions for his criticism. He resigned from the League of Communists soon afterwards, in March 1954. On 25 December 1954, he gave an interview to &quot;The New York Times&quot; in which he characterized the situation in Yugoslavia as &quot;totalitarian&quot;, adding that his country was ruled by &quot;undemocratic forces&quot; and &quot;reactionary elements&quot;. He also appealed for the formation of &quot;a new democratic Socialist party&quot;, and thus for a two-party system. For this &quot;hostile propaganda&quot; he was brought to trial and given an 18-month suspended prison sentence.

On 19 November 1956, Djilas was arrested following his statement to Agence France Presse opposing the Yugoslav abstention in the United Nations vote condemning Soviet intervention in Hungary and his article to &quot;The New Leader&quot; magazine supporting the Hungarian Revolution. He was sentenced to three years imprisonment. In 1957, Djilas published abroad &quot;The New Class: An Analysis of the Communist System&quot;, which he had already sent to the American publisher Praeger before he was jailed. In the book he argued that communism in Soviet Union and Eastern Europe was not egalitarian, and that it was establishing a new class of privileged party bureaucracy, who enjoyed material benefits from their positions. The book was a great success and was translated into more than 40 languages. For &quot;The New Class&quot;, Djilas was sentenced in 1957 to another seven years imprisonment, or ten in all, taking into account his previous term.

In prison, Djilas completed a massive scholarly biography of the great Montenegrin prince-poet-priest Njegoš as well as fictional novels (&quot;Montenegro&quot;) and short stories. In 1958, he published abroad the first volume of his memoirs, about his youth in Montenegro, entitled &quot;Land Without Justice&quot;, which he had finished in 1954, but was rejected by Yugoslav publishers. In this book, Djilas described the Šahovići massacre, a massacre of the Muslim population of the Yugoslav village of Šahovići (modern-day Tomaševo in Montenegro) and its neighboring area on 9–10 November 1924 by a mob of 2,000 Orthodox Christian men from Kolašin and Bijelo Polje who sought revenge for the earlier murder of Boško Bošković. The description was based on the testimony of his father Nikola, who participated in the massacre.

Djilas was conditionally released on 20 January 1961, after completing four years and two months in prison. During 1961, Djilas was repeatedly threatened by the Yugoslav government of being sent back to jail for his contacts with foreign journalists and scholars. The Italian magazine &quot;Tempo Presente&quot; which featured one of his short stories entitled &quot;The War&quot; was banned in the country. He would be imprisoned again in April 1962 for publishing abroad &quot;Conversations with Stalin&quot;, which became another international success and which Djilas personally considered his greatest work (see &quot;Rise and Fall&quot;). &quot;Conversations with Stalin&quot; was written in 1961 after his release, although it had long been on his mind before (&quot;Rise and Fall&quot;, p. 396). The manuscript was not smuggled out of prison, as it has been stated, including by David Pryce-Jones in &quot;Remembering Milovan Djilas&quot;. For &quot;Conversations with Stalin&quot;, Djilas was sentenced in August 1962 to another five years – or fifteen, added to the earlier punishments – allegedly for having &quot;revealed state secrets&quot;, which he denied. The book&#x27;s references to Albania and its possible union with Yugoslavia were considered embarrassing by Yugoslav communist leaders. During his internment, Djilas also translated John Milton&#x27;s &quot;Paradise Lost&quot; into Serbo-Croatian by utilizing toilet paper. On 31 December 1966, Djilas was granted amnesty and freed unconditionally after four years in jail. He was never to be imprisoned again. He continued as a dissident, living in Belgrade until his death on 20 April 1995.

==Views on the break-up of Yugoslavia and the Soviet Union==
Djilas opposed the breakup of Yugoslavia and the descent into nationalist conflict in the 1980s and 1990s, but predicted in the 1980s that a breakup would happen. In 1981, he predicted that this would happen on ethnic and bureaucratic nationalist lines due to the loss of Tito:&quot;Our system was built only for Tito to manage. Now that Tito is gone and our economic situation becomes critical, there will be a natural tendency for greater centralization of power. But this centralization will not succeed because it will run up against the ethnic-political power bases in the republics. This is not classical nationalism but a more dangerous, bureaucratic nationalism built on economic self-interest. This is how the Yugoslav system will begin to collapse.&quot;

He was critical of Serbian President Slobodan Milošević in the late 1980s and predicted that his actions would arouse separation of other republics, ethnic war, and the demise of Yugoslavia:&quot;Milošević still has possibilities... The liberalization you see has a bad cause. It is the consequence of national competition between Serbia and the other republics. Eventually Yugoslavia might be like the British Commonwealth, a loose confederation of trading nations. But first, I am afraid, there will be national wars and rebellions. There is such strong hate here.&quot;

&quot;Milošević&#x27;s authoritarianism in Serbia is provoking real separation. Remember what Hegel said, that history repeats itself as tragedy and farce. What I mean to say is that when Yugoslavia disintegrates this time around, the outside world will not intervene as it did in 1914... Yugoslavia is the laboratory of all Communism. Its disintegration will foretell the disintegration in the Soviet Union. We are further along than the Soviets.&quot;

In 1987, Djilas was interviewed by the neoconservative magazine &quot;Encounter&quot; on the subject of Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev&#x27;s economic and political reforms in the Soviet Union. Djilas described Gorbachev&#x27;s actions as a &quot;strict necessity. They have come to realize what other Communists in Yugoslavia, Poland, Hungary, Czechoslovakia and China realised much earlier—namely that Communism doesn&#x27;t work. It works neither at the economic level nor at the level of satisfying essential human needs and liberties... Communism is a 19th-century relic and a prescription for disaster.&quot;

==Views on Montenegrin nationhood==
Djilas was dubbed by Serbian nationalists as the &quot;creator of the separate Montenegrin ethnicity&quot; (as opposed to Serb). In an interview with the &quot;Borba Daily&quot; on 1 May 1945, Djilas stated that &quot;Montenegrins are of Serb origin&quot;, but had over time evolved into a separate nation and ethnic group. Djilas made great contributions to Montenegrin literature and historiography with his works. Later in life, from the mid-1980s, Djilas referred to himself as &quot;Serb&quot; (as does his Belgrade-born son Aleksa, a Harvard-graduate sociologist). After he left the party, Djilas denied there existed a separate Montenegrin ethnicity and national identity, especially in his books &quot;Njegoš: Poet-Prince-Bishop&quot; and &quot;Rise and Fall&quot;.

==Cultural references==
Djilas was a contributor for the 1992 Radio Television of Serbia documentary series entitled &quot;Yugoslavia in War 1941–1945&quot;. Djilas is mentioned in Saul Bellow&#x27;s fiction &quot;Humboldt&#x27;s Gift&quot;, where he writes about Joseph Stalin&#x27;s &quot;twelve-course all-night banquets&quot; and the theme of boredom.

<text>Samir Farid Geagea (,  , also spelled Samir Ja&#x27;ja&#x27; ; born 25 October 1952) is a Lebanese politician and former militia commander who has been the leader of the Lebanese Forces political party and former militia since 1986.

Born in Ain al-Remaneh, Geagea joined the Christian Kataeb Party in his early years. He led the Northern Front in the Lebanese Forces from 1979 to 1984. In March 1985, after the deterioration of the Christian political situation in the eastern regions after the assassination of the Lebanese Forces leader Bachir Gemayel, he led, jointly with Elie Hobeika and Karim Pakradouni, an uprising that led to control of the political situation without any bloodshed. On 15 January 1986, Geagea led a movement against the tripartite agreement sponsored by Syria to become the commander of the Lebanese Forces after the overthrow of Elie Hobeika, head of the executive body at the time and one of the signatories of the tripartite agreement.

Geagea initially supported the &quot;War of Liberation&quot; declared by disputed Prime Minister General Michel Aoun against the Syrian Army. On 31 January 1990, General Aoun declared war on the Lebanese Forces led by Geagea under the name &quot;elimination war&quot;. Under Geagea, the Lebanese Forces agreed to the Taif Accord peace agreement that ended the civil war and ceded control of its territory and weapons to the Lebanese Army in 1991. In accordance with the agreement, he immediately dissolved the military and security arm of the Lebanese Forces and surrendered all its military assets to the Lebanese Army. But as Beirut was under the control of the Syrian Army, the party members were subject to pressure and Syrian forces refused to withdraw as set out in the agreement.

On 24 January 1990, Geagea was appointed a Minister of State in the first post-war cabinet, led by Prime Minister Omar Karami. Geagea rejected the position due to the flagrant control of the cabinet by the Syrian regime. On 16 May 1992, Geagea was again appointed as a minister in the Rashid El Solh cabinet, only to refuse it again for the same reasons. In 1994, Geagea was arrested and put on trial for bombing a church and political killings in the war. He denied the accusations and claimed he was the target of a political prosecution fabricated by the Syrian-Lebanese security apparatus.

Geagea spent 11 years in solitary confinement, the only war leader to go to jail in Lebanon, while others benefited from an amnesty and took cabinet posts. Following the Cedar Revolution, and the subsequent withdrawal of Syrian forces from Lebanon, a newly elected Lebanese Parliament voted to grant him amnesty on 18 July 2005.

== Early life and education ==
Geagea was born in the Ain el-Remmeneh district in Beirut on 25 October 1952 to a modest Maronite family from the town of Bsharri in northern Lebanon. His father, Farid Geagea was an adjutant in the Lebanese Army. His brother, Joseph, is a mathematician in Maryland He attended &quot;Ecole Bénilde&quot; elementary and secondary school in Furn el-Chebek, which was a free private school. With the aid of a scholarship from the Khalil Gibran association, he studied medicine at the American University of Beirut and then at Saint Joseph University. After the outbreak of civil war in 1975, Geagea interrupted his four years studies at the American University of Beirut. He was an active member of the right-wing Phalangist Party, which became the main Christian fighting force upon the outbreak of the Lebanese Civil War in 1975. He is married to MP Sethrida Geagea.

== War period (1975–1990) ==
Geagea steadily rose through the ranks and led several operations at the request of Bachir Gemayel, then commander of the Phalangist Kataeb Regulatory Forces militia. In June 1978, following the murder of a Phalangist party leader Joud el Bayeh in the North Lebanon in a power struggle with former president Suleiman Frangieh, Bachir Gemayel ordered Geagea and Elie Hobeika to co-lead a unit to capture the suspects who were taking cover in Frangieh&#x27;s mansion in Ehden. The incident is known as Ehden massacre. The attacking force (which somehow went past over dozens of Syrian army checkpoints) was met with resistance on the outskirts of Ehden where Geagea was hit. He was transported to Beirut and admitted to Hôtel-Dieu hospital in Achrafieh, Beirut where ironically he was doing his internship. His right hand was partially paralyzed and he never continued his education. Meanwhile, the military operation resulted in the murder of Tony Frangieh and his family. Geagea was later transported to a hospital in France.

Geagea was appointed head of the Lebanese Forces&#x27; (LF) militia northern Front in the early 1980s, where he commanded around 1,500 battle-hardened soldiers, drawn mainly from his native town of Bsharri and other towns and villages in Northern Lebanon. Geagea led his men in fierce battles against the Syrian Army in El-Koura, Qnat. From 1982 to 1983, Geagea commanded the Lebanese Forces against Walid Jumblat&#x27;s Progressive Socialist Party militia, the Palestinians, and the Syrians in a battle for control of the Chouf mountains in central Lebanon.

Following the Israeli withdrawal from Sidon on 15 February 1985 Geagea launched an LF offensive from the Christian villages East and North of Sidon targeting Ain al-Hilwa refugee camp as well as the city itself. By 24 April his fighters were forced to retreat resulting in the exodus of some 60,000 Maronites from the villages of Iqlim al-Kharrub.

On 1 April 1990, during the War of Liberation, Elias Hrawi’s government mandated Fleet Admiral Elie Hayek to take over LF barracks in the governorate. This was part of an agreement between Geagea and Hrawi whereby the army would militarily and politically take over 2/3 of the canton (the remaining 1/3 being the Northern governorate and Achrafieh in East Beirut), but the militia’s 10,000 strong force would remain intact for the time being.

Michel Aoun, however, had publicly stated that he would not accept the handoff or any alliance between the LF and the Hrawi government. As the Elimination War was ravaging East Beirut and its suburbs (up to the Metn), the handoff actually began in Keserwan district – at the level of Nahr el-Kalb – up to Barbara. By May, however, the LF had taken over the entire coastline from Jounieh to Beirut from Aoun’s troops, completely cutting off naval supply routes. In addition, Geagea placed Hayek in an LF barrack in Jounieh as a symbol of his willingness to integrate with the government, defying Aoun’s refusal of any Hrawi-LF alliance. These developments, combined with the Syrian army’s support, dramatically shifted the odds in favour of the Taif agreement and its government.

=== Lebanese Forces ===
On 12 March 1985, Geagea and Elie Hobeika orchestrated an internal coup in order to end the leadership of Fouad Abou Nader in the Lebanese Forces. Abou Nader was considered to be too close to his uncle, president Amin Gemayel whose policies were not accepted by most LF leaders. On 15 January 1986, Geagea became head of the Lebanese Forces after overthrowing Hobeika, who was widely accused of treachery in the Lebanese Christian sector for agreeing to a Syrian-sponsored accord (the Tripartite Accord). During the following year, Geagea meticulously rebuilt the LF into an organized, well trained and equipped military force, one of the most advanced forces ever on Lebanese soil. He established social security and public services to fill the void that was created by the war-crippled state administration. He also extracted taxes from the Christian region, offered free open-heart operations and twinned Christians cities with foreign cities in Europe and America and tried to open an airport in the Halat region because the Beirut International Airport (located in the west suburb of Beirut) was under the control of the Syrian forces which made the access for Lebanese Christians almost impossible.

== The post-war period (1990) ==
In February 1990 General Michel Aoun launched an offensive attempting to dislodge Geagea’s Lebanese Forces from East Beirut. During the fighting the Christian areas of Beirut suffered greater destruction and more casualties than at any time during 15 years of civil war.

On 13 October 1990, Syria ousted General Aoun from the presidential palace in Baabda. Aoun was heading an interim government which filled the void in the absence of a presidential election after the end of President Amin Gemayel&#x27;s term in office. With Aoun out of the picture, Geagea was now the only leader in the Christian heartland. Geagea was subsequently offered ministerial portfolios in the new Lebanese government (formed on Christmas Eve).

=== Relations with the Kataeb party ===
In addition to being the LF leader, Geagea retained his seat in the Kataeb Politburo. In 1992, he ran for the Kataeb presidential election but lost to Georges Saadeh with whom the conflict grew. Later that year, Saadeh dismissed Geagea and all members of what was known as the &quot;Rescue Committee&quot; from the party. The committee was formed by several members of the Politburo and districts leaders loyal to the LF and Geagea.

=== Arrest and trial ===
There was increased pressure by Syria on Geagea to accept the Syrian presence or face charges. Prior to his arrest, he was contacted by several sympathetic politicians and warned about the forthcoming proceedings and offered safe passage out of Lebanon. Geagea refused to leave. The Syrians exploited the vulnerabilities of the amnesty law promulgated by then president Elias Hrawi for all the crimes and atrocities committed before 1990. This law also stated that any crime committed after that date will void the effect of the amnesty. On 26 January 1994, Geagea went to Qardaha, Syria to offer his condolences to President Hafez al-Assad, following the death of his son Bassel in a car accident. During his visit to Syria, president&#x27;s brother-in-law, Mohammed Makhlouf, asked him to talk with Syrian officers, but Geagea said that he only came for the funeral, which was considered as a refusal to cooperate with the Syrians.

On 27 February 1994, a bomb exploded in the Church of Sayyidet Al Najet (Our Lady of Deliverance) in the locality of Zouk Mikael killing 9 worshipers and injuring many. It is unknown who perpetrated the bombing and it was ultimately attributed to some shadowy groups, but Geagea was accused of the crime solely for the purpose of voiding the effect of the amnesty law of which he benefited, in the same way as all political and militia leaders from other communities and regions were benefiting despite their many unspeakable crimes throughout the Lebanese civil war. On 23 March 1994, the Lebanese government ordered the dissolution of the LF and Geagea&#x27;s deputy Fouad Malek was taken into custody. Geagea himself was arrested on 21 April 1994 in his village Ghadras, on charges of ordering the church bombing, of attempting to undermine government authority by &quot;maintaining a militia in the guise of a political party&quot;, of instigating acts of violence, and of committing assassinations during the Lebanese Civil War. He was accused of the assassinations of former prime minister Rashid Karami, National Liberal Party leader Dany Chamoun and his family, and former LF member Elias Al Zayek. He was also accused of attempting to kill Minister Michel Murr. He was acquitted in the church case but given four life sentences in the other cases. Geagea would become the only wartime leader who went to jail because of crimes committed during the war and after the Taif Accord. Amnesty International criticized Geagea&#x27;s trial and conviction, citing that it was politically motivated and unjust. 

=== Imprisonment ===
Geagea was incarcerated for 11 years in a small windowless solitary cell in the third basement level of the Lebanese Ministry of Defense in Yarze. His health status was jeopardized and he lost weight dramatically due to the unsanitary condition of the ill lit and poorly ventilated prison cell. He was deprived of access to media and the outside world and was only allowed to see his wife and close relatives. All of Geagea&#x27;s conversations were monitored and he was barred from talking politics with anyone.

For the duration of his incarceration, Geagea maintained that he meditated and reviewed his actions during the war to determine if what he did was right. He busied himself with reading literature, Hindu philosophy, the Qur&#x27;an, Christian theology and mysticism namely the works of Jesuit priest Teilhard de Chardin.

=== Release ===
Leaders of the Cedar Revolution considered the Geagea trials and sentences to be unjust, politically motivated, and orchestrated by the vassal government that ruled Lebanon during the Syrian occupation to oust Geagea from the political scene and dismantle the Lebanese Forces. When supporters of the Cedar Revolution won the majority in the 2005 parliamentary elections, they lobbied for an amnesty law to free Geagea from his disputed sentences.

The Lebanese Parliament passed an amnesty bill on 18 July 2005 to free Geagea. Given the sectarian balance of Lebanon, three dozen Islamist criminals were released with Geagea. The bill was subsequently signed by the then president Émile Lahoud. Geagea was released from prison on 26 July 2005 and left Lebanon for medical care. He returned to Lebanon on 25 October (his birthday), and lived in the Cedars region, his ancestral homeland, in northern Lebanon until 11 December 2006, after which he moved to a hotel in Bzoummar in Keserwan. On 30 June 2007, he moved to a new residence in Maarab, Keserwan.

== Current political activity ==

On the Lebanese political scene, Geagea and the LF are considered to be the main Christian component of the 14 March Alliance.

In September 2008, Geagea pronounced in front of thousands of rallying supporters in Jounieh a historical apology. The apology read:

Internationally, Geagea tried to renew his relations with influential countries such as the United States and France. On 19 March 2007, he met then French president Jacques Chirac in the Élysée Palace. In March 2008, he held talks in the US with officials at the White House, including then Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, then NSA Stephen Hadley and then chairman of the Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on the Middle East and South Asia Gary Ackerman.

A 2015 leak of documents from Saudi Arabia&#x27;s Foreign Affairs Ministry revealed that Geagea had asked for money to pay for bodyguards and boasted of his &quot;preparedness to do whatever the kingdom asks of him.&quot;

The Lebanese Forces made gains in the 15 May 2022 general elections. It became the largest Christian party in Parliament.

=== Assassination attempt (2012) ===
On 4 April 2012, at approximately 11:30 am, gunshots were heard in Geagea&#x27;s Maarab complex. Geagea&#x27;s security forces scouted the area, and found shells belonging to a 12.7 caliber sniper rifle, a high-tech rifle produced only by the United States and/or Russia, not available in the Lebanese infantries, the Lebanese Armed Forces or the black market, suggesting that the gun could only be obtained by one powerful party. Speculators claim the perpetrators to be pro-Syrian forces, most likely Hezbollah. Account of the story, as described in the press conference immediately following the attempt, claim Geagea to have been walking outside in the garden surrounding his mansion. Geagea bent over to pick up a flower, while bent over, Geagea heard gunshots, and immediately lay low on the ground, while his security forces took care of the situation. At the location where the shot would have killed him, two bullets had pierced through the wall. They claim the shooters to have been at least a kilometer away, stationed west of the residence (but the body guards were unable to see them due to the thick trees), and the operation to have been planned for months to silence Geagea, the only strong vocal critic against the Syrian/Iranian forces and the incumbent government. The Lebanese security forces have uncovered that a nine-member assassination team divided into three groups was involved in the killing attempt; two of the three groups were in charge of firing on Geagea.

The United States condemned the assassination attempt.

=== Candidacy for presidency (2014) ===
In 2014, Geagea declared his candidacy for the Lebanese presidential elections to succeed President Michel Suleiman, whose 6-year term was to end on 25 May 2014. Geagea enjoyed the comprehensive political backing of the March 14 Alliance for the presidency. Free Patriotic Movement&#x27;s MP Michel Aoun said that he would insist on holding the parliamentary election on schedule if Future Movement&#x27;s Saad Hariri did not support his candidacy for the presidency or if a new president will not be elected before September. Geagea challenged Aoun to run against him or move to a &quot;plan B&quot; that would enable a consensual candidate that is not considered partisan as being from either of the two political alliances, which, in addition to the two, are Phalange&#x27;s Amine Gemayel and Marada Movement&#x27;s Suleiman Frangieh.

After the sixth round of voting failed, Lebanese Democratic Party leader Talal Arslan suggested that the president should be directly elected by the people. In doing so, he said: &quot;The presidential crisis is a major insult to the Lebanese nation. The only way to save the nation and restore respect to the presidency is by holding the election directly by the people.&quot; Lebanese Forces MP Antoine Zahra added that Geagea remained the party&#x27;s candidate.

However, the country entered into a 2 years presidential deadlock, which ended in 2016, with Geagea backing up his longtime rival Michel Aoun for the presidency through the Maarab Accord. Aoun was elected president, ending more than two years of presidential vacuum.

=== Lebanese crisis (2019–present) ===
During the beginning of the October 17 protests, Geagea called for the resignation of the Prime Minister, due to the &quot;resounding failure to halt the deterioration of the [country&#x27;s] economic situation&quot;. Geagea had previously blamed his opponents for &quot;obstructing the necessary reforms,&quot; but since declared his &quot;lack of confidence in the current cabinet.&quot; His party held four seats within the government: Minister of Labor Camille Abou Sleiman, Minister of Administrative Development May Chidiac, Deputy Prime Minister Ghassan Hasbani, and Minister of Social Affairs Richard Kouyumjian.

On 6 August 2020, Geagea was the first politician to visit Beirut after the explosion and launched from there a relief committee, Ground-0, under the leadership of the former minister Dr. May Chidiac to support in rebuilding Beirut. In December 2020, the committee achieved repairing 709 houses, assisted 5300 individuals and 2300 families, distributed 14000 food rations, made 2540 medical consultations, and provided 2030 individuals with medicine. In addition, the committee distributed more than 150 scholarships for Beirut schools&#x27; students.

After the 2021 Beirut clashes, Geagea was summoned by military intelligence to testify about the events, as both Hezbollah and the Amal Movement accused his party of instigating the violence. Geagea denied these allegations, asserting that his supporters acted in self-defense against an attack by Hezbollah loyalists who had vandalized property in the area. On the day he was scheduled to appear, Geagea did not show up, and his supporters protested the summons, blocking roads in support. On 14 October 2021, protests were held in the Tayouneh neighborhood of Beirut by supporters of Hezbollah and the Amal Movement; several of the demonstrators were armed. They were calling for the removal of Tarek Bitar, the judge appointed to investigate the Beirut port explosion in which Hassan Nasrallah called bias. The demonstrators were shot at by snipers from nearby buildings, though the latter&#x27;s identity was unclear but Geagea&#x27;s rivals alleged it was the Lebanese Forces.

== Relations ==

=== China ===
The Lebanese Forces party maintain a good relation with the Chinese Communist party.

On 23 November 2022, Geagea received an official invitation to visit China.

=== France ===
After the 2020 Beirut explosion, Geagea refused Emmanuel Macron&#x27;s request to name Mustapha Adib to form the government.

During the 2022–2025 Lebanese presidential election, Geagea accused France of supporting Suleiman Frangieh to serves its common interest with Hezbollah. On 14 December 2023, Geagea declared that he no longer expected anything from France during an interview with French weekly magazine Valeurs actuelles.

=== Hezbollah ===
Geagea has consistently positioned the LF as a staunch opponent of Hezbollah, criticizing its military power and political influence in Lebanon. He has accused Hezbollah of undermining Lebanon&#x27;s sovereignty. In a speech during an annual martyrs event, Geagea declared his readiness for an &quot;all-out&quot; confrontation against Hezbollah, labeling the group and its allies as the &quot;axis of crime.&quot; He stated that Hezbollah would not be allowed to ascend to the presidential palace, indicating a firm stance against any political arrangements that would empower Hezbollah during the 2022 presidential elections. Geagea emphasized his refusal to negotiate with Hezbollah unless they let go of their primary candidate Suleiman Frangieh.

During the Israel–Hezbollah conflict, Geagea accused Hezbollah of initiating hostilities with Israel, stating that such actions have not benefited Lebanon or the Palestinian cause. He remarked that Hezbollah&#x27;s military operations in southern Lebanon have resulted in significant loss of life and destruction of villages, asserting that these actions have not aided Gaza but rather harmed Lebanon. He has repeatedly called for the reinforcement and implementation of Resolution 1701.

In September 2024, in a speech he accused Hezbollah of &quot;confiscating the Lebanese people&#x27;s decision on war and peace, as if there were no state,&quot; and starting &quot;a war [with Israel] that the Lebanese people reject, but has been imposed on them. It is a war that the Lebanese people do not want and over which the government has had no say. This war does not serve Lebanon, it has brought nothing to Gaza, nor alleviated its suffering one iota.&quot;

=== Kurdistan ===
On 18 January 2012, Geagea visited Iraqi Kurdistan where he received a hero&#x27;s welcome in Erbil&#x27;s predominately Christian district of Ankawa and he met Kurdistan president Masoud Barzani.

=== Saudi Arabia ===
The LF is widely regarded as Saudi Arabia&#x27;s main ally in Lebanon after Saad Hariri&#x27;s retirement from Lebanese politics. This alignment stems from shared interests in countering Hezbollah&#x27;s influence and Iranian presence in the country. In September 2017, Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman met with Geagea in Jeddah and allegedly spoke about &quot;common concerns&quot;. A 2015 leak of documents from Saudi Arabia&#x27;s Foreign Affairs Ministry revealed that Geagea had asked for money to pay for bodyguards and boasted of his &quot;preparedness to do whatever the kingdom asks of him.&quot;

<text>A Global Threat (AGT) was an American punk rock band, formed in Bangor, Maine in 1997. They released four full-length albums as well as many 7-inch EPs and toured extensively throughout the United States.

== History ==

=== 1997–2000 ===
Originally formed in Maine in 1997, the band relocated to Boston, Massachusetts in 1998 where it was based until their breakup. The band&#x27;s original members were Bryan Lothian, Brett Threat, Westie, and Tubby Tim. In 1998 the band recorded and self-released their first EP, &quot;The Kids Will Revolt Against All Authority&quot;, on Crack Rock Records. Soon after, Mike Graves and Petrov Curtis joined the band (on drums and guitar respectively) and they began playing live shows in Boston and New York. During this period, the band met Mark Civitarese (a member of Boston punk group The Unseen), who would become a major supporter of the band before later joining it himself. Mark re-released &quot;The Kids Will Revolt&quot; EP on ADD Records in late 1998. 
He then became a member of AGT in 1999 and took up dual vocal duties, with both him and Bryan singing during live shows.

In 1999, they released the &quot;What the Fuck Will Change?&quot; EP as well as a split 7-inch EP with Broken. Both these releases saw the band progressing towards the more frantic and relentless streetpunk style for which they would later become well-known. &quot;What the Fuck Will Change?&quot; was later re-released as the band&#x27;s first full-length LP on Step-1 Music, including new material as well as re-recorded songs from &quot;The Kids&quot; EP. During this time, Johnny joined the band on rhythm guitar and AGT embarked on a tour of the U.S. East Coast and South. Unfortunately, the band was involved in a three-car accident in Austin, Texas, forcing them to cancel the remaining dates of the tour. 1999 also saw the release of the &quot;Who&#x27;s to Blame?&quot; split 7-inch EP with now defunct Rochester, New York band The End on Anarchist Records/ADD Records.

Shortly thereafter, AGT secured a record deal with GMM records because Mark Noah had seen them play in Chapel Hill, NC with Patriot. That winter after a weekend of shows, original member Brett Threat was fired from the band and would subsequently move back to Maine and form the punk band USA Waste. The band then played a few shows with Johnny on bass, before he too was released from the band and went on to form USA Waste with Brett. AGT then recruited long-time friend and previous musical collaborator Gabe Crate (a.k.a. Gabe Asturd) to join the group on bass. Having now secured a more musically solid lineup they hit the studio to record their second full-length &quot;Until We Die&quot;. In November, Mark Civitarese, also known as Mark Unseen, played his last show with AGT and left due to being in two bands.

=== 2000–2007 ===
In 2000, the band set out on an East Coast tour with the short-lived Boston-based hardcore band The Statistics. However, The Statistics left the tour after only two shows, leaving AGT to finish the remaining dates on their own. The band also recorded the &quot;In The Red&quot; EP this year, and &quot;Until We Die&quot; was released on GMM Records. The band also set out on its first national tour with Awkward Thought. This tour was also joined, at points, by The Krays, Truents, Toxic Narcotic, and The Flatliners (Tx).

Shortly after the tour, Gabe was fired from the band. In 2001, AGT carried on as a three-piece with Pete on bass, Mike on drums, and Bryan on guitar and vocals, playing a handful of shows in Massachusetts and New York City. The band also recorded a split 7-inch with Toxic Narcotic before touring with The Casualties. For this tour, John Curran, who went on to form the L.A. &#x27;shitgaze&#x27; band Kiss Me Deadly in 2009, joined the band as the new bassist and Pete returned to guitar. In December, AGT recorded their 3rd full-length LP &quot;Here We Are,&quot; which was released on Punkcore Records. During this time, Bryan began playing guitar as Pete Curtis prepared to leave the band and move to L.A. Around this time, Pete Curtis and former member Gabe Crate, coincidentally also about to leave the Boston area, became involved in a violent altercation with one another at a party, during which Gabe called into question Pete&#x27;s punk rock credibility, allegedly inspiring the lyrics for a future bonus track entitled &quot;D.F.&quot; written by Pete about Gabe&#x27;s own shortcomings.

In 2001, Pete played his last show as a full-time member with the band before leaving for L.A., apparently becoming emotionally overwhelmed during the show and openly weeping. Pete, however, would rejoin the band several times in the future, rendering his tears on this occasion entirely superfluous. &quot;What the Fuck Will Change?&quot; was also re-released this year on Punkcore Records. 2002 also saw the band embark on another U.S. tour with The Casualties, as well as a U.S. tour with Defiance, for which Pete rejoined the band.

In winter and spring of 2003, the band toured the west coast and north east with Clit 45. Also that spring the &quot;Earache/Pass the time&quot; EP was released. For the summer AGT would tour the U.S. with F-minus.

In 2004–2005 AGT continued to play shows, toured the US with Casualties and then the Unseen and Career Soldiers, began work on new musical material and also searched for a new record label. They eventually landed with BYO Records.

In 2006, the band recorded what would become their final record, &quot;Where the Sun Never Sets&quot; on BYO Records. Many consider this album to be the band&#x27;s most musically complex and innovative achievement, while also maintaining the original political and musical aggressiveness for which the band has always been known and respected.

In support of the release, A Global Threat would tour southern California, then the East Coast with Strike Anywhere, the Subhumans across the Midwest US, followed by their first full Canadian tour joined in part by the Wednesday Night Heroes. They would then tour the US again with Strike Anywhere, Bane, This is Hell, Ignite and Modern Life is War for the remainder of the summer and then returned to Canada for another tour with the Wednesday Night Heroes and The Filthy.

In winter 2007 they would tour southern California and Arizona with LCB, Monster Squad and Career Soldiers. Then A Global Threat completed a U.S. tour with The Casualties before headlining another US tour with Wednesday Night Heroes and Monster Squad. Mike O&#x27;Brien of Clit 45 played guitar on the first tour of the summer, while another replacement, Ben, took over the guitar on the second tour.

That summer tour would be their last, taking the stage for the final time at Welfare records in Haverhill MA. On November 19, 2007, the band officially folded and announced their break-up. In an interview with Punkplanet.com conducted shortly after the band&#x27;s dissolution Bryan stated that, among other things, creative differences, car theft, and crippling arthritis were the main factors leading to the breakup of the band.

=== 2011 ===
It was announced that Jailhouse Records would be re-issuing the long out of print &quot;Until We Die&quot; album by A Global Threat on the Jailhouse/Sixty Nine Apple label in CD format, as well as on vinyl format for the first time.

== Band members ==

<text>Nathan Marsh Pusey (; April 4, 1907 – November 14, 2001) was an American academic. Originally from Council Bluffs, Iowa, Pusey won a scholarship to Harvard University out of high school and went on to earn bachelor&#x27;s, master&#x27;s, and doctorate degrees in the classics at Harvard. Pusey began his academic career as a professor of literature at Scripps College and Wesleyan University before serving as president of Lawrence College from 1944 to 1953.

Serving as President of Harvard University from 1953 to 1971, Pusey was the first president of Harvard from outside New England. After his time at Harvard, he was president of the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation from 1971 to 1975.

==Early life and education==
Pusey was born in Council Bluffs, Iowa to John and Rosa Pusey. His great uncle William Henry Mills Pusey had served as an Iowa state senator and member of the United States House of Representatives. He shared a name with another great uncle, Iowa state senator Nathan Marsh Pusey. The younger Pusey was educated at Harvard College (B.A.), and received M.A. (1928) and Ph.D (1937) degrees from Harvard University, studying English literature and ancient history. During his freshman year in college, he lived in Stoughton Hall.

He married Anne Woodward in 1936. The couple later had three children.

==Educational career==
Pusey&#x27;s first teaching post after he graduated was at Riverdale Country School. He then taught at Lawrence College, Scripps College, and Wesleyan University. He served as president of Lawrence College (1944–1953), and later as the 24th president of Harvard University (1953–1971).

During his presidency of Harvard, Pusey overhauled the admissions process, which had been biased heavily in favor of the alumni of New England–based boarding schools, and began admitting public school graduates based on scores obtained on standardized tests such as the SAT. This was highly controversial with the school&#x27;s alumni population but set the stage for diversifying the student body and faculty.

==Political positions==
Pusey was a devout, lifelong Episcopalian who deplored the “almost idolatrous” secularism of his era. He was an active member of All Saints Episcopal Church in Appleton, Wisconsin, during his presidency of Lawrence College.

Pusey vigorously opposed McCarthyism in the 1950s and supported the US Civil Rights Movement in the 1960s. His clashes with Joseph McCarthy were especially significant because Pusey&#x27;s position at Lawrence College placed him in the senator&#x27;s hometown (Appleton, Wisconsin) and amid the political power base of the then-conservative Fox Valley. As president of the college, Pusey held the community&#x27;s respect, and his vocal criticisms of McCarthy resounded loudly in the area. Pusey was a deeply religious man and a somewhat traditionalist scholar, and he was appalled by the student radicalism that raged in American universities in the late 1960s.

He complained bitterly that &quot;learning has almost ceased&quot; in many universities because of the violent, revolutionary activities of a &quot;small group of overeager young... who feel they have a special calling to redeem society.&quot; In April 1969, student activists occupied Harvard&#x27;s University Hall (the building that housed most of the administrative offices) in protest over the presence of ROTC on campus at the height of the Vietnam War. In response, Pusey summoned local and state police to arrest the demonstrators. Although his action was legal, it was widely criticized, and the resulting furor probably contributed to his early retirement in 1971. After his time at Harvard, Pusey was president of the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation (1971–1975) and president of the United Board for Christian Higher Education in Asia (1979–1980).

Pusey Library, an underground building named for him, was announced in 1971 and opened in 1976. It houses a number of special collections and the Harvard Archives.

<text>EuroVelo is a network of 17 long-distance cycling routes criss-crossing Europe, with 2 more in early construction across various stages of completion. When completed, the EuroVelo network&#x27;s total length will be almost . more than were in place. EuroVelo is a project of the European Cyclists&#x27; Federation (ECF). The multinational project aims to connect 40 countries via the 19 unique routes across the European continent. 

EuroVelo routes can be used for bicycle touring across the continent, as well as by local people making short journeys. The routes are made of both existing national bike routes — such as the Dutch LF-Routes, the German D-Routes, the French véloroute &quot;SN3V&quot; and the British National Cycle Network — and existing general purpose roads, together with new stretches of cycle routes to connect them.

== History ==
The idea of creating a network of international cycle routes spanning Europe started in 1995. It was initially coordinated by the ECF, &quot;De Frie Fugle&quot; (Denmark) and Sustrans (UK) and the original plan was to create 12 long-distance cycling routes.

Since August 2007, the ECF has assumed full responsibility for the project. Despite sometimes tight financial constraints, the EuroVelo project has already begun to fulfil the vision of its founders with sections of the network being implemented in countries as far apart as Finland, Cyprus, Spain and the UK. In addition, the EuroVelo brand has become widely known.

There have been various changes to the network over the years, most notably the addition of two new routes — EuroVelo 13 (the Iron Curtain Trail) and EuroVelo 15 (the Rhine Cycle Route) — in September 2011, which are the longest and shortest of the EuroVelo routes.

== Future expansion ==
In September 2023, the ECF announced that the Iberian Cycle route connecting Lisbon with Pamplona via Madrid is set to become the future EuroVelo 16 route by 2028 with a length of 1,896 km.

==Main points on the EuroVelo routes==

* Routes EV10 and EV12 are a circular tour
* Connections to other EV routes are in parentheses
* Odd routes are heading north–south, even routes are heading west–east

==Route information==

===EuroVelo 1 – Atlantic Coast Route===
Stretching the length of the continent, from North Cape, Norway to Valença, Portugal, the EV1 connects Norway, Scotland, Northern Ireland, the Republic of Ireland, Wales, the West Country of England, France, Spain and Portugal.

===EuroVelo 2 – Capitals Route===
EV2 runs between Galway, Ireland to Moscow, Russia visiting some capital cities along the way, from Eyre Square to Red Square.

Between The Hague in the Netherlands and the German-Polish border, the EV2 follows the bicycle route called &quot;European Bicycle Route R1&quot; or &quot;Euro-Route R1&quot;, an international long-distance cycling route connecting Boulogne-sur-Mer in France with St Petersburg in Russia.

===EuroVelo 3 – Pilgrims Route===
EV3 goes from Trondheim in Norway to Santiago de Compostela in Spain. The route follows traces of old roads used for pilgrimages in the Middle Ages. The route passes through Norway, Sweden, Denmark, Germany, Belgium, France and Spain. Most of these countries have a developed network of bicycle routes used as part of the EV3.

===EuroVelo 4 – Central Europe Route ===

The EV4 goes from Roscoff, France to Kyiv, Ukraine, going through France, Belgium, The Netherlands, Germany, Czechia, Poland, and Ukraine.

===EuroVelo 5 – Via Romea Francigena===
The EV5 route is inspired by the &quot;Via Francigena&quot;, a pilgrimage route from London to Rome first recorded by Archbishop of Canterbury Sigeric in the 10th century AD. However, the route of the true &quot;Via Francigena&quot; is an almost straight line path from London to Rome, while the EuroVelo 5 route takes a more easterly route that passes through Brussels, Luxembourg and Strasbourg in the Alsace. It then follows the Franco-German border, passes through Switzerland following Swiss National Bike Route no. 3, before crossing the Alps at the Gotthard Pass. It then passes through Italy (more closely following Sigeric&#x27;s route) to Rome before continuing on to the Adriatic port city of Brindisi.

===EuroVelo 6 – River Route===
Running from Saint-Nazaire on the mouth of the river Loire along that river eastward through France, EV6 passes over the border to Switzerland to Lake Constance and then on to Tuttlingen in Germany, where it begins its way down the Danube following the Donauradweg (Danube Cycle Route). It follows that river, Europe&#x27;s second longest, through Germany, Austria, Slovakia, Hungary, Serbia, Bulgaria and Romania to the river&#x27;s mouth at the Danube Delta. It then continues southwards to end in Constanța, on the Black Sea.
===EuroVelo 7 – Sun Route===
EV7 runs from the North Cape to Malta. It goes through Norway, Finland, Sweden, Denmark, Germany, Czechia, Austria, Italy, and Malta.

===EuroVelo 8 – Mediterranean Route===
EV8 follows the European coastline of the Mediterranean sea from Cádiz, Spain to Athens, Greece, going through Spain, France, italy, Slovenia, Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Montenegro, Albania, Greece, Turkey, and Cyprus.

===EuroVelo 9 – Amber Route===
EV9 (in Poland, also labeled as R9) stretches from the Baltic Sea to the Adriatic Sea. It is so named after the precious stone amber collected in the Baltic, which was taken by routes such as this to the Mediterranean. One of the shortest of the EuroVelo routes, EV9 still manages to cut across Europe from north to south, from Poland to Croatia, and in doing so passes through the Czech Republic, Austria and Slovenia en route.
===EuroVelo 10 – Baltic Route===

EV10 runs around Baltic Sea. Some of its parts are mapped on OpenStreetMap project Relation: EuroVelo 10 - Baltic Sea Cycle Route - part Sweden (63584). On the state of the route there is an OpenStreetMap wiki page 

===EuroVelo 11 – East Europe Route===
EV11 connects (theoretically) Norway&#x27;s North Cape with Athens.

===EuroVelo 12 – North Sea Route===
EV12 was the first European route, opened in June 2001, route through England, Scotland, Norway, Sweden, Denmark, Germany, the Netherlands and Belgium. It features in the &quot;Guinness Book of Records&quot; as the longest unbroken signposted cycling route. It was funded in part by the European Union&#x27;s Interreg initiative.

===EuroVelo 13 – Iron Curtain Trail===
EuV13 follows the old Iron Curtain, the divided borders of Europe during the Cold War. The ICT runs from Kirkenes, Norway on the Barents Sea, along the Finno-Russian border through to the Baltic Sea, then hugs the length of the Baltic coast to Lübeck in Germany. It then follows the old border between West Germany and the former East Germany, the current borders between the Czech Republic and both Germany then Austria, the Austrian-Slovak and Austrian-Hungarian borders before following the borders of Romania, the former Yugoslavia, Bulgaria and North Macedonia. It finishes at Rezovo in Bulgaria on the Black Sea after following the border with Greece and Turkey.

===EuroVelo 15 – The Rhine Cycle Route===
EV15, with an overall length of about passes through four countries from the headwaters of the Rhine in Andermatt in the Swiss Alps to the estuary in Rotterdam in the Netherlands, via France and Germany.

=== EuroVelo 17 – Rhone Cycle Route ===
EV17 has an overall length of about . It starts in Andermatt and runs along each side of Lake Geneva before crossing into France. Passing through Lyon and Avignon, it forks into sections which end in Montpellier and Marseille.

=== EuroVelo 19 – Meuse Cycle Route ===
EV19, with an overall length of about , is the newest and the shortest EuroVelo route. It follows one of the most significant rivers in Europe, from the source of the Meuse on the Langres plateau in France, heading north into Belgium and on to the river mouth at Hook of Holland, with the route ending in the Dutch port city of Rotterdam.

==Requirements==
The ECF has written a route development manual for those working on developing EuroVelo routes. According to the guidelines, all EuroVelo routes should fulfill the following criteria:
* They must be based on existing or planned national or regional routes of the involved countries.
* At least two countries must be involved.
* Route length must be at least .
* Steep sections should be avoided wherever possible and for very steep sections (if unavoidable) alternative transport options (i.e. public transport or alternative routes) should be provided.
* Easy to communicate - internationally recognisable identity and name (marketing potential).
* Implementation plans in place (project plan, business plan, partners).
* Signing in accordance with the regulations of the respective nations and/or regions, continuous and in both directions.
* Signage supplemented by EuroVelo route information panels, in accordance with the recommendations of UNECE and the ECF&#x27;s &quot;Signing of EuroVelo cycle routes&quot; manual.

==Route infrastructure==
In 2011 the share of route infrastructure components in the EuroVelo network was as follows:
* Bicycle path/lane: 14%
* Traffic-free asphalted road: 8%
* Traffic-free non-asphalted road: 6%
* Public low-traffic, asphalted road: 56%
* Public non-asphalted road: 3%
* Public high-traffic, asphalted road: 14%

<text>The Cape Verde shearwater (Calonectris edwardsii), or cagarra locally, is a medium-large shearwater, a seabird in the petrel family Procellariidae. It is endemic to the Cape Verde archipelago of Macaronesia in the Atlantic Ocean, off the coast of West Africa.

==Taxonomy==
The Cape Verde shearwater was originally described in 1883 by Émile Oustalet as a full species. It was later lumped as a subspecies of Cory&#x27;s shearwater but has since been separated again, by Cornelis Hazevoet in 1995, as a distinct species.

==Description==
The Cape Verde shearwater has a slim, dark bill, with head and upperparts darker than Cory&#x27;s. The flight is more typically shearwater-like than Cory&#x27;s, with stiffer and more rapid wing beats. The overall appearance, compared with Cory&#x27;s, is of a smaller, slimmer and more angular bird.

==Distribution==
The shearwaters breed only within the Cape Verde Islands. The largest colonies are on the islands of Brava, Branco and Raso, though the species also breeds in smaller numbers on other islands in the archipelago. Though their pelagic distribution and movements are not well known, they are regularly seen around the islands in the breeding season. After the breeding season they disperse and may sometimes be seen in the upwelling zone in Senegalese waters, where about 10% of the population has been recorded in October. There have been records from the South Atlantic and the eastern coast of North America. Individuals have been found offshore of Maryland and North Carolina.

==Behaviour==

===Breeding===
Following a three-month absence, the mature birds arrive at their island breeding colonies in late February and March, where they nest in cliff hollows, on offshore rocks, and under large boulders. Females lay a single egg and incubation takes place from May to July, with the chicks fledging from late September to November. Following fledging, all birds stay at sea until the next breeding season.

===Feeding===
As with other shearwaters, all food is taken at sea and consists of small fish, squid and other marine organisms.

==Status and conservation==
The total population was estimated in 1993 to number about 20,000 mature individuals (10,000 breeding pairs). Although the species is nationally protected, the chicks are harvested by fishermen for food, with an estimated 5000 birds taken from their nests on Branco and Raso each year. Numbers have declined because of over-harvesting of young birds and the species is considered to be near threatened.

<doc id="757369" wikidata="Q3544660" url="?curid=757369" title="USS Aaron V. Brown">
<text>USS &quot;Aaron V. Brown&quot; was a revenue schooner in the service of the Union Navy during the American Civil War. She was named for United States Postmaster General Aaron V. Brown, the only cutter to bear the name.

== Design and construction ==
On 11 November 1856, the United States Revenue Cutter Service put out a contract for the construction of six shallow-draft cutters for use on the Great Lakes. This contract would be issued to Merry and Grey at Milan, Ohio following their bid of $4,050 for each boat. The design was a scaled down version of a previously 140-ton plan by the Revenue Service. The ship&#x27;s construction was overseen by a Revenue Service captain and delayed by the onset of winter and a controversy surrounding where certain building materials should originate from. Construction also suffered from a $2,333 cost overrun and a lien issued against the builders, with construction finally being completed between June and July 1857. Compared to her sister ships, &quot;Brown&quot; was armed with a single six-pounder cannon. Issues regarding the overdue construction was resolved after the revenue service seized the six schooners from the shipbuilders, following the shipyard&#x27;s debt and a disagreement between the United States Treasury and Ohio financiers regarding the matter.

The ship was made of white oak, yellow pine, locust wood and copper fastenings. She was long, had a beam of a depth of , a draft of and had a centerboard which provided stability. The vessel&#x27;s rounded stern was decorated with eagle figureheads and ornamental shields.

== Service history ==

=== Peacetime ===
Prior to the Civil War, &quot;Brown&quot;, whose records have for the most part been lost, operated on the Great Lakes from her base at Milwaukee, Wisconsin. As the national crisis deepened after Abraham Lincoln was elected President, &quot;Brown&quot; was transferred to the Atlantic and, in company with sister ships , &quot;Black&quot;, , and , arrived at Boston late in December 1861.

=== Civil War service ===
Following a brief assignment at Salem, Massachusetts, she was repaired, provisioned for a deployment in Southern waters, and sailed for the sounds of North Carolina. Here, she operated out of Beaufort, North Carolina for most of 1863. Commanded by Captain John Mason Jr., USRCS, she served in the shoals of those dangerous and bitterly contested waters until May 1864, when she proceeded to New York Harbor to be sold at a cost of $3,700 on 23 August 1864.

<doc id="757383" wikidata="Q1193867" url="?curid=757383" title="Tales (video game series)">
<text>The Tales series is a franchise of fantasy role-playing video games published by Bandai Namco Entertainment (formerly Namco), and developed by its subsidiary, Namco Tales Studio until 2011 and presently by Bandai Namco Studios. First begun in 1995 with the development and release of &quot;Tales of Phantasia&quot; for the Super Famicom, the series currently spans seventeen main titles, multiple spin-off games and supplementary media in the form of manga series, anime series, and audio dramas.

While entries in the series generally stand independent of each other with different characters and stories, they are commonly linked by their gameplay, themes and high fantasy settings. The series is characterized by its art style, which draws from Japanese manga and anime, and its action-based fighting system called the &quot;Linear Motion Battle System&quot;. Multiple people have become linked with the series, including character designers Kōsuke Fujishima and Mutsumi Inomata, producers Hideo Baba and Makoto Yoshizumi, and composer Motoi Sakuraba. The series was created by Yoshiharu Gotanda.

Most of the main &quot;Tales&quot; games have been localized for North America and Europe, although almost none of the spinoff titles have been released abroad. While generally seen as a niche series in English-speaking regions, &quot;Tales&quot; is considered to be among the most important JRPG franchises in Japan. The series has been gaining popularity in the West since the release of &quot;Tales of Symphonia&quot;, which is still considered one of its most popular games. As of 2024, the series has shipped over 30 million copies.

==Titles==
===Games===
Since the first installment was released in 1995, the &quot;Tales&quot; series has grown to include the main entries and multiple spin-offs that derive multiple gameplay and narrative elements from the main entries. Except when indicated by naming, the main &quot;Tales&quot; entries are separate from each other apart from gameplay mechanics and themes. While &quot;Tales&quot; titles are often ported to new consoles after their original release, these remakes are rarely localized. The 2006 Nintendo DS game &quot;Tales of the Tempest&quot; was originally seen as a main entry in the series, but in 2007 was classified as a spin-off, possibly due to poor reception of that particular title.

==== Main series ====

The series debuted on the Super Famicom with &quot;Tales of Phantasia&quot; in 1995, and introduced multiple elements that would become staples of the &quot;Tales&quot; series. It was released in the West on the Game Boy Advance in 2006. It was also ported to the PlayStation, PlayStation Portable and iOS. The PlayStation received two original &quot;Tales&quot; games: &quot;Tales of Destiny&quot; in 1997, which was the first title to be released in North America, and &quot;Tales of Eternia&quot; in 2000, which was released in North America as &quot;Tales of Destiny 2&quot; in 2001.

Five titles were released on the PlayStation 2. The true direct sequel to &quot;Destiny&quot;, &quot;Tales of Destiny 2&quot;, was released on the PlayStation 2 in 2001 across Asian territories and ported to the PlayStation Portable in Japan in 2007; both versions have yet to receive a Western release. &quot;Tales of Symphonia&quot; was released in Japan on the PS2 and GameCube. The GameCube version was also released in North America and Europe. It was the first entry to feature 3D graphics for its characters and environments and the first to be released in Europe. &quot;Tales of Rebirth&quot; was released in 2004 and ported to the PlayStation Portable in 2008, but has not yet received a Western localization. &quot;Tales of Legendia&quot; and &quot;Tales of the Abyss&quot; were both released in Japan in 2005, with both being released in North America the following year. &quot;Legendia&quot; was the first and only &quot;Tales&quot; game developed by Namco internal development team &quot;Project Melfes&quot;, while &quot;Abyss&quot; was developed by the same team that developed &quot;Symphonia&quot;, and used its same graphics engine. &quot;Abyss&quot; was later ported to the Nintendo 3DS and released in Japan, North America and Europe.

&quot;Tales of Innocence&quot; was the next game released in Japan on the Nintendo DS in 2007. A remake of the game, &quot;Innocence R&quot; was released on the PlayStation Vita in 2012. Neither version has been released in the West. The first release on seventh-generation consoles, &quot;Tales of Vesperia&quot; for Xbox 360, was released in Japan and North America in 2008 and in Europe in 2009. A Japan-exclusive PlayStation 3 port with updated content was released in 2009, which became available worldwide in 2019 with the remastered &quot;Definitive Edition&quot; on PlayStation 4, Microsoft Windows, Xbox One and Nintendo Switch. &quot;Tales of Hearts&quot; was released on the Nintendo DS in 2008. A remake, &quot;Hearts R&quot;, was released in 2013 in Japan and 2014 in North America and Europe.

The twelfth entry, &quot;Tales of Graces&quot;, released on the Wii in Japan in 2009. A PlayStation 3 port, &quot;Graces f&quot;, was released in 2010 in Japan, and in 2012 in North America and Europe. &quot;Tales of Xillia&quot;, the series&#x27; 15th anniversary title, was released in Japan for PlayStation 3 in 2011, and in North America and Europe in 2013. &quot;Xillia&quot;″s direct sequel and the fourteenth main title, &quot;Tales of Xillia 2&quot;, was released in 2012 in Japan and 2014 in North America and Europe. The series&#x27; 20th anniversary title, &quot;Tales of Zestiria&quot;, was released in January 2015 in Japan and worldwide in October 2015, for PS3, PS4 and PC. The sixteenth main title, &quot;Tales of Berseria&quot;, was released in Japan for PS3 and PS4 in August 2016, and worldwide for PS4 and PC in January 2017. &quot;Tales of Arise&quot;, designed as a departure from series conventions, was originally set to release in 2020 for Windows, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One, but was delayed to September 2021 due to internal issues and the desire to launch the game on next-generation consoles.

As the &quot;Tales&quot; series grew, games became categorised under certain branches: &quot;Mothership&quot; for main titles, &quot;Escort&quot; for spin-offs, and &quot;Mobile&quot; for games release for mobile phones. In 2020, a different internal organization scheme was announced; &quot;Original&quot; for games featuring new stories as well as their sequels, and &quot;Crossover&quot; for secondary entries drawing characters and worlds from various past titles.

The series has received a small number of sequels, and a large number of spin-off titles and subseries. These games are derivative rather than original works. Three direct sequels have been produced: &quot;Destiny 2&quot;, &quot;Xillia 2&quot; and &quot;Tales of Symphonia: Dawn of the New World&quot;. &quot;Eternia&quot; received an MMORPG spin-off for Microsoft Windows titled &quot;Tales of Eternia Online&quot;. Multiple games have been made for mobile platforms, including the &quot;Tales of Mobile&quot; series, &quot;Tales of Kizna&quot; (released on mobile on November 22, 2011; ended service on September 25, 2014), &quot;Tales of Card Evolve&quot; (released on mobile on June 3, 2012; ended service on September 30, 2014), &quot;Tales of Link&quot; (released in Japan on iOS on March 3 and on Android on April 23, 2014; in North America on April 5, 2016; ended service on March 28, 2018) and &quot;Tales of Asteria&quot; (released on Android on April 4 and on iOS on April 23, 2014; ended service on May 18, 2023). Two titles for the PlayStation Portable have been released in Japan: &quot;Tales of VS.&quot; in 2009, and &quot;Tales of the Heroes: Twin Brave&quot; in 2012. The main spin-off subseries is &quot;Tales of the World&quot;, which has grown to include ten games beginning with &quot;Tales of Phantasia: Narikiri Dungeon&quot;, released in Japan on the Game Boy Color in 2000. Only &quot;Tales of the World: Radiant Mythology&quot; has been released in the West. A second subseries, &quot;Tales of Fandom&quot;, consists of two puzzle-adventure games released respectively for the PlayStation and PlayStation 2 in 2002 and 2007. On February 28, 2017, they had released another mobile &quot;Tales&quot; game called &quot;Tales of the Rays&quot; in Japan and worldwide on July 24, 2017. On March 28, 2018, however, &quot;Tales of Link&quot; ended their service, and a day after the closure, they announced the global version of &quot;Tales of the Rays&quot; would end their service as well on May 29, 2018, with its Japanese vesion shutting down on July 23, 2024. &quot;Tales of Crestoria&quot;, another mobile game, was released on July 16, 2020. It ended service on February 7, 2022. &quot;Tales of Luminaria&quot;, the latest part of the &quot;Tales&quot; series, was released on November 3, 2021. The game was discontinued on July 19, 2022.

===Related media===
The &quot;Tales&quot; series has expanded into other media, including CD dramas, manga and anime. Multiple &quot;Tales&quot; games have been adapted into anime OVAs and TV series. The &quot;Symphonia&quot; OVA was released in three parts between 2007 and 2011, and released as a single collection in 2013. &quot;Abyss&quot; was adapted into a 26-episode TV series between October 2008 and March 2009. &quot;Phantasia&quot; and &quot;Eternia&quot; have also received anime adaptations. The series&#x27; first theatrical film, a prequel to &quot;Vesperia&quot; called &quot;Tales of Vesperia: The First Strike&quot;, was released in 2009 in Japan and 2012 in North America. A made-for-television anime based on the opening sections of &quot;Zestiria&quot;, &quot;Dawn of the Shepherd&quot;, was produced as part of the 20th anniversary celebrations related to the title. It was also released on the game disc. A full series based on &quot;Zestiria&quot; began airing in July 2016.

Books and audio dramas have also been made. &quot;Phantasia&quot; received multiple CD dramas, including four collected into anthologies in January and March 2000. and a stand-alone drama in December 2001. &quot;Symphonia&quot; received seven audio dramas. Two CD dramas for &quot;Legendia&quot; were respectively released in August and September 2005. A manga of &quot;Phantasia&quot; was written and serialized in 2008 and 2009, while &quot;Abyss&quot; received three manga adaptations in the years after its release. &quot;Symphonia&quot; was adapted into novelizations and a manga serial. &quot;Destiny&quot;, &quot;Graces&quot; and &quot;Xillia&quot; also received adaptations of these kinds.

==Common elements==

===Gameplay===

The &quot;Tales&quot; series is classified as a role-playing video game series. Multiple gameplay elements carry over from entry to entry. The main unifying element is the combat system, the Linear Motion Battle System (LMBS for short). Considered one of the mainstays and building blocks for every main entry in the series, it undergoes multiple incremental changes and alterations from one installment to the next. Introduced in &quot;Phantasia&quot;, it is a real-time fighting system similar to a brawler, as opposed to the majority of RPGs at the time of &quot;Phantasia&quot;″s release, which primarily used turn-based battle systems.

Some features introduced in certain games have proven popular enough to remain in future installments like &quot;Free Running&quot; (the ability for a character to freely roam the battlefield). Elements of turn-based combat are also present, though to a lesser degree: an example of this is &quot;Destiny&quot;″s &quot;Chain Capacity&quot; feature (the number of skills a character can perform), which appears in later games in the series. The battle system for &quot;Legendia&quot; was deliberately designed to be similar to a brawler: the stated reason was that the team wished to combine brawler combat with the story and leveling mechanics of a &quot;Tales&quot; game. Characters generally use Artes, which are special attacks characters can perform in battle. Players can usually only control one character, though a multiplayer option was implemented for &quot;Destiny&quot; and has reappeared in later &quot;Tales&quot; games.

The battle system&#x27;s name for each installment is augmented with descriptive titles representative of features of that game&#x27;s battle system: examples are the &quot;Style Shift&quot; system from &quot;Graces&quot; (characters shifting between two types of Artes) and the &quot;Fusionic-Chain&quot; system from &quot;Zestiria&quot; (a human character merging with a magical character for a brief period to deal greater damage, termed in-game as &quot;Armatization&quot;). Characters are awarded with &quot;Titles&quot;, nicknames that sometimes grant benefits to them in battle when assigned to them. In the majority of previous &quot;Tales&quot; games, when navigating the overworld or environment and encountering an enemy, combat took place on a separate battle screen. From &quot;Zestiria&quot; onwards, combat took place in the same space as exploration.

Most &quot;Tales&quot; games have skits, side conversations between different characters that can be both dramatic and comedic in nature. They are commonly portrayed as character portraits or profiles, with text along the bottom of the screen. They were first introduced in &quot;Tales of Destiny&quot;, though the majority were cut from the English release. In the original English GameCube release of &quot;Symphonia&quot;, the voice track for the skits was removed, but for its HD re-release, the Japanese voice track, and consequently the skit voice tracks, were included. Developers noted that English voices for skits were not included in &quot;Symphonia&quot; and &quot;Abyss&quot; due to time constraints, but later entries, such as &quot;Vesperia&quot;, would include English voiced skits. Another recurring feature is the Cooking system, where characters learn and prepare dishes to restore health and forms of experience points. In &quot;Tales of Crestoria,&quot; unlike the previous titles, the combat system is a turn-based RPG, which is very rare in the series.

===Themes, plots and characters===
The prominent narrative theme of the &quot;Tales&quot; series is the issue of coexistence between different races. A particular example of this is &quot;Tales of Rebirth&quot;, which extensively explores themes of racism. Scenario writer Hiramatsu Masaki was inspired by the ethnic conflicts seen in Yugoslavia. Another recurring feature is the plot and characters, which are often rooted in and revolve around themes such as justice or faith. The theme for each entry in the series is decided by the series producer based on current world events. The chosen theme helps dictate what the game will be called: once the theme is decided, the team search through various languages to find a suitable representative word. The narratives of each story were described by Gamasutra as &quot;very typical&quot; during a 2008 interview with staff members, although it was not elaborated upon by the interviewer. The interviewers suggested that this point of view was based on the fact that Western fans were not generally experienced in Japanese culture, and so would see the stories in each entry as similar. The writers for each game are hired on a per-project basis, with both freelancers and in-house story writers being involved. Two of the recurring writers are Takumi Miyajima (&quot;Symphonia&quot; and &quot;Abyss&quot;), and Naoki Yamamoto (&quot;Hearts&quot;, &quot;Xillia&quot;, &quot;Zestiria&quot;). There are very few mainline games that share a setting: &quot;Symphonia&quot; takes place along the same &quot;time axis&quot; as &quot;Phantasia&quot;, while &quot;Zestiria&quot; and &quot;Berseria&quot; take place on the same world at different time periods.

The settings for the stories are primarily high fantasy worlds, with the producers opting not to use a dark or science fiction-based setting. An exception is &quot;Xillia 2&quot;, which mostly took place in a modern setting, and explored darker themes than usual. This direction was confirmed as a one-off experiment for the series. The main characters play a key role in the &quot;Tales&quot; games, as it is partially through them that the main theme of each entry is depicted. For &quot;Abyss&quot;, it was decided to take a risk and create an unorthodox protagonist that would be initially unlikable. For &quot;Vesperia&quot;, the team opted to raise the age limit of the target audience, showing this in the game by making the main protagonist a more mature type. A female main protagonist was included for the first time in &quot;Xillia&quot; in the form of Milla Maxwell alongside male protagonist Jude Mathis, although at the time it was stated that there were no solid plans to create a game with a single female protagonist. A sole main female character, called Velvet, was eventually included in &quot;Berseria&quot;. The way the characters interact with each other during the narrative forms one of the core aspects of designing each game. Another main priority is for players to see a part of themselves in the characters.

===Terminology===
Unique terminology is used when referring to games within the series. In 2007, Yoshizumi announced two classes of &quot;Tales&quot; games, &quot;Mothership Titles&quot; and &quot;Escort Titles&quot;. &quot;Mothership&quot; essentially means &quot;Main series&quot;, where as &quot;Escort&quot; essentially means &quot;Spinoff&quot;. One of the recurring differences between the two game types internally is that &quot;Escort&quot; titles don&#x27;t supply inspiration for main entries in the series, but draw the most popular elements from them. The games are also frequently given what is called a &quot;Characteristic Genre Name&quot;, which is essentially a short subtitle or phrase that outlines the game&#x27;s overall theme. The main reason for this, as stated by Yoshizumi, was that the series was not seen as a role-playing series by the development team, but rather &quot;Character Playing Game&quot;, with the player learning about the game&#x27;s characters and watching them grow rather than using them as avatars: the genre names are meant to distinguish them from other role-playing games. The terms, however, are largely removed from the English localized versions. There are also terms that are used in remakes or ports of games: &quot;R&quot; stands for &quot;remake&quot; or &quot;Re-imagination&quot; (as in &quot;Hearts R&quot;), while &quot;F&quot; in &quot;Graces f&quot; stood for &quot;future&quot;, in reference to the game&#x27;s extra story content.

==Development==

===History===
The &quot;Tales&quot; series originated when &quot;Phantasia&quot; began production, based on an unpublished novel titled , written by the game&#x27;s scenario writer and lead programmer Yoshiharu Gotanda. During the story development process, several elements of the original novel were dropped or changed. The game was developed by Wolf Team, an independent game development studio founded in 1986. Due to bad experiences at Telenet Japan, the previous employer of multiple Wolf Team members, the staff sought an independent publisher for the game. After an unsuccessful pitch to Enix, they entered a publishing contract with Bandai Namco (then Namco). &quot;Phantasia&quot; had a troubled development cycle for the original Super Famicom version, with many creative disagreements between Wolf Team and Namco. The disagreements led to most of the Wolf Team staff leaving after the game in order to start a new company, tri-Ace, which would go on to make the &quot;Star Ocean&quot; series. Remaining members would continue to develop games in the &quot;Tales&quot; series.

The studio remained independent until 2003, when it was acquired by Bandai Namco and renamed Namco Tales Studio. The studio&#x27;s shares were divided between Bandai Namco, Telenet Japan and series director Eiji Kikuchi. In 2006, Namco bought Telenet&#x27;s shares, then later Kikuchi&#x27;s, giving them full control over the studio. In mid 2011, a financial report indicated that Namco Tales was in serious financial trouble, having a debt of 21 million dollars and posting a loss for the previous financial year. The studio&#x27;s absorption into its parent company was formally announced in November of that year. After the absorption of Namco Tales, former series brand manager Hideo Baba was appointed as series producer. He had previously been the producer of the original version of &quot;Hearts&quot;. Alongside Baba, the chief series producer is Makoto Yoshizumi, who had produced multiple titles including &quot;Destiny&quot; and &quot;Innocence&quot;.

===Art design===

The series is distinguished by its art style, which emulates manga and anime. According to Baba, the character designs are created once the main character&#x27;s story, personality, and environment are determined by the rest of the production team. Beyond that, the artist is allowed to use their imagination, though they can be asked to alter things like costume details, and facial expressions. One of the main designers for the series is manga artist Kōsuke Fujishima. He was first brought in to design the characters for &quot;Phantasia&quot;, and has since designed for multiple entries including &quot;Abyss&quot; and &quot;Xillia&quot;. Another designer, Mutsumi Inomata, first designed for the series with &quot;Destiny&quot;, and has contributed designs for multiple entries including &quot;Eternia&quot;, &quot;Rebirth&quot; and &quot;Xillia&quot;. A third regular artist is Daigo Okumura, who designed characters for &quot;Vesperia&quot; and &quot;Xillia 2&quot;, as well as &quot;Dawn of the New World&quot;. Other designers to work on the series include Kazuto Nakazawa (&quot;Legendia&quot;), Kouichi Kimura (&quot;Xillia 2&quot;), and Minoru Iwamoto (&quot;Zestiria&quot;). The art design for each game&#x27;s world and characters has ranged between a cel-shaded anime style (&quot;Vesperia&quot;) to a more realistic style (&quot;Xillia 2&quot;). Skit character images are also directly inspired by anime art. The art style for each title is determined by the theme and story decided upon by the developers.

Anime cutscenes are included in each game, and are a primary focus for the production team as they help make the first impression on players. The series aims to avoid standard anime tropes and common narrative elements with each installment. The first game to feature such cutscenes was &quot;Destiny&quot;. The cutscenes were animated by Production I.G, which has provided cutscenes for the series until &quot;Xillia&quot;. For &quot;Xillia&quot;, aiming to demonstrate a new artistic direction for the series, production of the anime cutscenes was given to Ufotable. For the Nintendo DS release of &quot;Hearts&quot;, two identical versions of the game were released as an experiment by the production team, with one featuring traditional anime animation by Production I.G., and one featuring computer-generated cutscenes by Shirogumi Ltd. The CGI cutscenes proved less popular with fans than the established anime style. For the brand new title &quot;Tales of Arise&quot;, the world design went in a darker direction compared to earlier entries, both to further the series evolution and appeal to the Western market. Despite the overt focus on 3D graphics, 2D anime cutscenes are still planned as with previous entries. Similar to the previous games in the series, the anime sequences were produced by Ufotable.

===Technology and development teams===
The engines for the games are generally developed in-house. The cited reasons for this included problems with outsourced development. Until &quot;Vesperia&quot;, the team worked on a by-project basis, creating new development tools and engines for each installment. Due to cost increases, the development process was altered and streamlined as more user-friendly software engines became available. The studio was divided into two teams: Team Destiny worked on 2D &quot;Tales&quot; titles such as &quot;Tales of Destiny&quot;, while Team Symphonia developed 3D titles. In-house, major distinctions were made between the two studios except for some core staff Namco Tales produced the majority of the mainline &quot;Tales&quot; games until its absorption in 2011. The notable exceptions are &quot;Legendia&quot;, which was developed by an internal staff group at Bandai Namco, and &quot;Innocence&quot;, which was developed by Alfa System. Alfa System also developed many of the portable spin-off titles. After the absorption of Namco Tales by Bandai Namco, the teams and staff transferred to the new in-house development studio called Bandai Namco Studios. The size of the teams was reduced and the previous studio&#x27;s main divisions were merged. This allowed production to be streamlined, but also meant that the team could only focus on one game at a time, rather than working on two games simultaneously as they had done before.

===Music===
The regular main composer for the &quot;Tales&quot; series is Motoi Sakuraba. His first work on the series was for &quot;Phantasia&quot;, and has since contributed to nearly every main entry since there in the capacity of a freelance composer. Sakuraba has become noted for his signature musical style, which is present in the majority of his &quot;Tales&quot; scores. He also frequently collaborates with Shinji Tamura. The entries Sakuraba has not worked on are &quot;Legendia&quot;, which was composed by Go Shiina, an in-house composer, and &quot;Innocence&quot;, whose composer was Kazuhiro Nakamura. Sakuraba and Shiina had collaborated on the score for &quot;Zestiria&quot;. Multiple titles in the series use licensed theme songs by multiple Japanese artists: among the artists are Garnet Crow (&quot;Eternia&quot;), Deen (&quot;Destiny&quot;/&quot;Hearts&quot;), Kokia (&quot;Innocence&quot;), Ayumi Hamasaki (&quot;Xillia&quot;/&quot;Xillia 2&quot;) and FLOW (&quot;Berseria&quot;). One recurring aspect of many earlier localizations was the removal of the Japanese theme song, such as with &quot;Symphonia&quot;, which had its theme song replaced with an orchestral version. The first Western release of a &quot;Tales&quot; game to feature the theme song used in Japan was &quot;Vesperia&quot;.

===Localization===
Multiple &quot;Tales&quot; titles, the majority of which are spin-offs, have not been localized for the West or have only been released in North America: two examples of the former case for entries in the main series are &quot;Rebirth&quot; and &quot;Innocence&quot;, while an example of the latter is &quot;Legendia&quot;. Speaking in 2013, Baba explained that the main priority for localizations was for the main series rather than spin-offs. In addition to this, he stated that their localization team was limited and they needed to &quot;pick and choose&quot; which game to bring to the West. For its Western release, &quot;Eternia&quot;″s name was changed to &quot;Destiny 2&quot;: this was due to a possible trademark conflict and the wish to exploit the popularity of &quot;Destiny&quot;. The 2006 PSP port of &quot;Eternia&quot; retained its original title. With &quot;Zestiria&quot;, Bandai Namco planned to attempt releasing the game in the West in the same year it was released in Japan. The deciding factor in this resolution was the delayed release of &quot;Xillia&quot; and its sequel, and the reaction of Western fans to this. Fan localizations have also been created, such as for the original versions of &quot;Phantasia&quot; and &quot;Innocence&quot;. While the option of the Japanese voice tracks have been heavily requested for Western releases by fans, licensing issues have mostly prevented Bandai Namco from implementing it. Localization for mobile titles is also a low priority due to them being co-developed by Japan-based mobile developers.

==Reception and legacy==
The series has generally sold well during its lifetime. The series&#x27; strongest sales base has been Japan: in 2007, sales distribution was 87% in Japan, 8% in North America, 3% in Europe and 2% in mainland Asia. The best-selling titles of the series were &quot;Tales of Symphonia&quot; ( copies for the GameCube and PS2), &quot;Tales of Destiny&quot; ( for PlayStation and PS2), &quot;Tales of Phantasia&quot; ( for Super Famicom, PlayStation, GBA, and PSP), &quot;Tales of Eternia&quot; ( for PlayStation and PSP), and &quot;Tales of Destiny 2&quot; ( for PS2 and PSP), not including mobile or online games. Other titles that have since sold over copies worldwide include &quot;Tales of Vesperia&quot; ( copies for the Xbox 360, 465,888 for PS3, and over 500,000 for &quot;Definitive Edition&quot;), &quot;Tales of Xillia&quot; (PS3), &quot;Tales of Berseria&quot;, and &quot;Tales of Arise&quot;. By March 2023, the series in total had shipped over 29.29 million copies. By March 2024, it had shipped 30.25 copies.

While keeping a lower profile in English-speaking regions, in Japan, it is regarded as one of the biggest role-playing video game series. 1UP.com&#x27;s Jeremy Parish, speaking in 2006, referred to it as the third biggest RPG series in Japan behind &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; and &quot;Dragon Quest&quot;. Gamasutra&#x27;s Brandon Sheffield echoed these sentiments, stating that &quot;While the series doesn&#x27;t have quite the cultural cache of &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; in the West or &quot;Dragon Quest&quot; in Japan, it&#x27;s still a very popular brand worldwide&quot;. IGN&#x27;s Anoop Gantayat additionally referred to it as the third biggest Japanese role-playing series in regards to sales. Multiple entries in the series, notably &quot;Destiny&quot; and &quot;Legendia&quot; have been favorably compared with fighting games and brawlers, especially the &quot;Street Fighter&quot; series. GameTrailers ranked the Linear Motion Battle System, with particular reference to &quot;Graces&quot;, as one of the top five JRPG battle systems. Their stories and characters have generally received a more mixed response from Western critics: opinions on entries such as &quot;Legendia&quot;, &quot;Abyss&quot;, &quot;Xillia&quot; were mixed to positive, while others such as &quot;Symphonia&quot;, &quot;Graces&quot; and &quot;Xillia 2&quot; were criticized. The main criticism for these games and &quot;Legendia&quot; was that the story was either predictable or cliché. The in-game graphics have also drawn mixed responses for several games in the series, including &quot;Destiny&quot;, &quot;Eternia&quot;, &quot;Graces&quot; and &quot;Xillia&quot;.

In 2013, leading up to the release of &quot;Tales of Symphonia Chronicles&quot;, Baba called &quot;Symphonia&quot; the most successful title in the series in the West thus far, although the series&#x27; main target audience was still in Japan. In an earlier interview, Baba commented that the team behind the series put a large amount of effort and development in keeping the series fresh while retaining the base elements across each installment. The positive reaction of gamers in the US to &quot;Symphonia&quot; influenced the way the various teams developed titles after that point. Speaking in 2014, production manager Denis Lee said that, since &quot;Symphonia&quot;″s release, the popularity of the series has grown. In response, Bandai Namco have focused on getting more entries out in Western territories. Much of their research about what titles to release or develop in the future revolves around direct conversation with &quot;Tales&quot; series fans at gaming conventions and special events.

<doc id="757387" wikidata="Q1286510" url="?curid=757387" title="Snooky Pryor">
<text>James Edward &quot;Snooky&quot; Pryor (September 15, 1919 or 1921 – October 18, 2006) was an American Chicago blues harmonica player. He claimed to have pioneered the now-common method of playing amplified harmonica by cupping a small microphone in his hands along with the harmonica, although on his earliest records, in the late 1940s, he did not use this method. In 2023, he was inducted in the Blues Hall of Fame.

==Career==
Pryor was born in Lambert, Mississippi, United States. He developed a country blues style influenced by Sonny Boy Williamson I (John Lee Williamson) and Sonny Boy Williamson II (Aleck Ford &quot;Rice&quot; Miller). In the mid-1930s, in and around Vance, Mississippi, Pryor played in impromptu gatherings of three or four harmonica players, including Jimmy Rogers, who then lived nearby and had yet to take up playing the guitar. Pryor moved to Chicago around 1940.

While serving in the U.S. Army he would blow bugle calls through a PA system, which led him to experiment with playing the harmonica that way. However, most historians credit the idea to Little Walter. Upon discharge from the Army in 1945, he obtained his own amplifier and began playing harmonica at the outdoor Maxwell Street Market, becoming a regular on the Chicago blues scene.

Pryor recorded some of the first post-war Chicago blues in 1948, including &quot;Telephone Blues&quot; and &quot;Snooky &amp; Moody&#x27;s &#x27;Boogie&#x27;&quot;, with the guitarist Moody Jones, and &quot;Stockyard Blues&quot; and &quot;Keep What You Got&quot;, with the singer and guitarist Floyd Jones. &quot;Snooky &amp; Moody&#x27;s &#x27;Boogie&#x27;&quot; is of considerable historical significance: Pryor claimed that the harmonica virtuoso Little Walter directly copied the signature riff of Pryor&#x27;s song in the opening eight bars of his blues harmonica instrumental &quot;Juke,&quot; an R&amp;B hit in 1952. This claim is historically questionable at best. During the 1950s, Pryor regularly toured in the South. In 1967, Pryor moved to Ullin, Illinois. He quit music and worked as a carpenter in the late 1960s but was persuaded to make a comeback. Blues fans later revived interest in his music, and he resumed recording occasionally until his death in nearby Cape Girardeau, Missouri, at the age of 85.

In January 1973 he performed alongside Homesick James with the American Blues Legends &#x27;73 tour, which played throughout Europe. On this tour they recorded an album in London, &quot;Homesick James &amp; Snooky Pryor&quot;, for Jim Simpson&#x27;s label, Big Bear Records, with Pryor also recording a solo album, &quot;Shake Your Boogie.&quot;

Pryor appeared on Bob Margolin&#x27;s 1995 Alligator Records release &quot;My Blues and My Guitar&quot;.

Some of his better-known songs are &quot;Judgement Day&quot; (1956), &quot;Crazy &#x27;Bout My Baby&quot; (from &quot;Snooky&quot;, 1989), &quot;Where Did You Learn to Shake It Like That&quot; (from &quot;Tenth Anniversary Anthology&quot;, 1989), and &quot;Shake My Hand&quot; (1999).

Pryor&#x27;s son Richard &quot;Rip Lee&quot; Pryor is also a blues musician and performs in and around his hometown of Carbondale, Illinois.

<text>Thomas Hill (January 7, 1818 – November 21, 1891) was an American Unitarian clergyman, mathematician, scientist, philosopher, and educator.

==Biography==
Taught to read at an early age, Hill read voraciously and was well regarded for his capacious and accurate memory. His father taught him botany, and he took a delight in nature and devised scientific instruments, one that calculated eclipses and was subsequently awarded the Scott Medal by the Franklin Institute.

Though not formally educated in his youth, Hill briefly attended the Lower Dublin Academy in Holmesburg, Pennsylvania and the Leicester Academy in Massachusetts, now the Leicester campus of Becker College, leaving in 1837.

He earned his A.B. and D.Div. from Harvard University in 1843 and 1845 respectively. He was later made an honorary member of the Hasty Pudding. Hill was president of Antioch College from 1860 to 1862 until the Civil War forced the college to shut down; he then held the presidency of Harvard University from 1862 to 1868. Ill health caused his retirement from Harvard, but he was able to serve as official botanist during the &quot;Hassler&quot; Expedition circumnavigating South America through the Magellan Strait from Boston in December 1871 to San Francisco in August 1872. From 1873, he was head of the Unitarian parish in Portland, Maine.

In 1863, he was elected as a member of the American Philosophical Society. Hill claimed to have injured his testicle while gardening, an incident that made him wary of laboratory instruction at Harvard, warning students not to exert themselves too much in their studies.

Hill&#x27;s home in Waltham, Massachusetts, where he began his career, is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

<text>Leonard Hoar (1630 – November 28, 1675) was an English-born American Congregational minister and educator, who spent a short and troubled term as President of Harvard College.

==Life==
Born in Gloucestershire about 1630, he was the fourth son of Charles Hoare, by Joanna Hinkesman of Gloucester. Some time after the death of his father in 1638 he emigrated with his mother to America. Hoar, as he thenceforth called himself, graduated at Harvard College in 1650, and in 1653 returned to England, where he became a preacher. Through the interest of Henry Mildmay he was beneficed at Wanstead, Essex, from which he was ejected by the 1662 Act of Uniformity. A Cambridge Master of Arts (MA Cantab) by incorporation, he was awarded the degree of Doctor of Medicine (MD) by Cambridge &quot;per literas regias&quot; in 1671.

His niece, Anna Flynt, and her husband, Timothy Dwight, were members of the Dwight family and the ancestors of Timothy Dwight IV, Timothy Dwight V, and Theodore Dwight Woolsey, presidents of Yale University.

==Harvard Presidency and death==
In 1672 Hoar went again to Massachusetts to preach, by invitation, at the Old South Church, Boston. He brought a letter, dated 5 February 1672, addressed to the magistrates and ministers in Massachusetts Bay by thirteen nonconformist ministers in and around London, friends of the colony and agents in raising funds for a new college building, who strongly recommended Hoar for the post of president of Harvard as successor to Charles Chauncy, who died 19 February 1672. The general court voted an increase of salary on the condition that Hoar was elected. He was accordingly chosen, to the disappointment of Urian Oakes, who was widely regarded as Chauncy&#x27;s legitimate successor. Hoar was immediately elected and installed as President of Harvard on December 10, 1672; a position he held until he resigned on March 15, 1675.

Hoar had high ambitions for Harvard as research centre, as he wrote to Robert Boyle at this time. He modernized technical education by introducing a garden and orchard, a workshop, and a chemical laboratory to Harvard. He was the first president of Harvard College who was also a graduate of it; but he was not well liked by his students or the people of Massachusetts, in part because of his radical religious views. The facts of his time in office remain obscure. Samuel Sewall was educated at Harvard by Hoar, one of only three students to graduate from Harvard in 1673. He was also one of the few to come to Hoar&#x27;s defense in 1674 or 1675, just before Hoar was forced to resign. Some members of the corporation had combined against him, with the result that all the students, with the exception of three, had left. Sewall later argued that &quot;the causes of the lowness of the Colledge were external as well as internal.&quot;

Daniel Munro Wilson wrote

At all events the students fell away from the president, and &#x27;set themselves to &quot;Travestie&quot; whatever he &quot;did&quot; and &quot;said&quot;, and aggravate everything in his behavior disagreeable to them, with a design to make him Odious&#x27;.

Cotton Mather in his &quot;Magnalia Christi Americana&quot; stated that

His epitaph in the Hancock Cemetery at Quincy, Massachusetts, reads:

His wife Bridget, daughter of John Lisle the regicide, died at Boston, Massachusetts, on 25 May 1723. By her he had two daughters: 
*Bridget, who married, on 21 June 1689, the Rev. Thomas Cotton of London, a liberal benefactor of Harvard College; and 
*Tryphena.

==Works==
He produced work on biblical scholarship. He was author of:
* &#x27;Index Biblicus: or, the Historical Books of the Holy Scripture abridged. With each book, chapter, and sum of diverse matter distinguished, and a chronology to every eminent epocha of time superadded. With an Harmony of the Four Evangelists and a table thereunto, &amp;c.&#x27; [by L. H.], London, 1668 (another edition 1669). It was afterwards reissued as &#x27;Index Biblicus Multijugus: or, a Table to the Holy Scripture. The second edition, &amp;c.&#x27; [by L. H.], London, 1672.
* &#x27;The First Catalogue of Members of Harvard College,&#x27; 1674. The only copy known was found in 1842 by James Savage in the State Paper Office in London, and was printed in the &#x27;Proceedings&#x27; of the Massachusetts Historical Society for October 1864 (p. 11), a few copies with a title-page being issued separately.
* &#x27;The Sting of Death and Death Unstung, delivered in two Sermons, preached on the occasion of the death of the Lady Mildmay,&#x27; Boston [Mass.], 1680, published by Hoar&#x27;s nephew, Josiah Flint.

<text>Charles Chauncy (baptized 5 November 1592 – 19 February 1672) was an Anglo-American Congregational clergyman, educator, and secondarily, a physician. He was the second President of Harvard.

==Life==
Charles Chauncy was born at Ardeley, Hertfordshire, England. The village was then known as Yardley. The manor belonged to the Dean and Chapter of St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral, which leased the manor-house (a moated property called &quot;Ardeley Bury&quot;) and the demesne lands to the Chauncy family.

He was educated at Westminster School, then at Trinity College, Cambridge, where he later was a lecturer in Greek. In 1627 the College arranged for him to be appointed vicar of St Mary&#x27;s, the parish church of Ware, Hertfordshire. In 1633 he left Ware to become vicar of Marston St. Lawrence, Northamptonshire. At both parishes he faced disciplinary procedures for his Puritan views which included opposition to communion rails.

He emigrated to America in 1637. He preached at Plymouth until 1641, then at Scituate where, says Cotton Mather, &quot;he remained for three years and three times three years, cultivating the vineyard of the Lord.&quot; He was appointed president of Harvard College in 1654. He held that office until his death in 1671. His descendants also include Connecticut Governor and National Baseball Hall of Fame member, Morgan Bulkeley. Besides a number of sermons, Chauncy published &quot;The Doctrine of the Sacrament, with the Right Use Thereof&quot; (1642); &quot;The Plain Doctrine of the Justification of a Sinner in the Sight of God&quot; (1659), a collection of 26 sermons; and &quot;Antisynodalia Scripta Americana&quot; (1662).

During his time at Plymouth and Scituate, Chauncy got into a heated debate with the religious and secular leaders of the Plymouth Colony over the issue of baptism. Chauncy taught that only baptism by full immersion was valid, while the Separatist Elders taught that sprinkling water over the body was just as valid. The sprinkling method of baptism was much preferred in New England due to its cooler and harsher climate. The religious leaders of the Plymouth Colony held public debates, trying to convince Chauncy to change his views. When Chauncy still did not change his views, the Pilgrim leaders wrote to congregations in Boston and New Haven soliciting their views, and all the congregations wrote back that both forms of baptism were valid. Still, Chauncy did not change his teachings. It was because of this issue that Chauncy left Plymouth for Scituate in 1641. A year after arriving in Scituate, Chauncy had a chance to practice what he preached, when he publicly baptized his twin sons by full immersion. The plan backfired when one of his sons passed out due to being dunked in the water. The mother of the child who was supposed be baptized at the same event refused to let it happen, and according to John Winthrop, got a hold of Chauncy and &quot;near pulled him into the water&quot;. When Chauncy was hired to be President of Harvard, he had to promise the leaders in Boston that he would keep his views on baptism quiet.

He died on 19 February 1672 and was buried at New Cambridge.

==Family==

Chauncy married at Ware on 17 March 1630 Catherine, daughter of Robert Eyre, barrister-at-law, of Salisbury, Wiltshire. By her, who died on 24 January 1668, aged 66, he had six sons, all bred to the ministry and graduates of Harvard, and two daughters. His second son was the physician and nonconformist minister Ichabod Chauncey.

His great-grandson was also named Charles Chauncy, minister of the First Church (Congregational) of Boston 1727–1787, an Old-Light opponent of Jonathan Edwards and the New Light ministers of the Great Awakening, and a precursor of Unitarianism.

Sir Henry Chauncy, the historian, was his grandnephew.

<text>Kwai Hing () is an elevated railway station on the of Hong Kong MTR system. It is named after the nearest public housing estate, and is between Kwai Fong and Tai Wo Hau stations.

Opened on 10 May 1982, it forced most direct bus services into Kowloon to be cancelled. Nevertheless, the station provides a convenient transport service to local residents, also attracting local shuttle services with nearby settlements and factories.

Below the platforms is a small transport interchange. This interchange is with traffic, due to traffic diverted from the increasingly crowded Kwai Fong station.

==History==
Kwai Hing station opened on 10 May 1982, in sync with Tsuen Wan line. The construction of Kwai Fong station, this station, and the viaducts was done by Dragages et Travaux Publics. There has been no new changes since, other than the fitting of Platform Screen Doors.

==Station layout==
The tracks of platform 1 and 2 are located side by side in the middle of the station. Unlike the island platforms common to most MTR stations, Kwai Hing uses two side platforms and passengers have to ride different escalators from the concourse up to the correct platform for the destination they wish to go to.

Kwai Hing station is one of the three elevated stations on the Tsuen Wan line. (The others are Lai King and Kwai Fong stations.) The structure of Kwai Hing station is very similar to that of Kwai Fong station.

<text>Cornelius Conway Felton (November 6, 1807 – February 26, 1862) was an American educator. He was regent of the Smithsonian Institution, as well as professor of Greek literature and president of Harvard University.

==Early life==
Felton was born in West Newbury, Massachusetts. He was the brother of Samuel Morse Felton Sr., the half-brother of John B. Felton and the uncle of Samuel Morse Felton Jr.

He graduated from Harvard University in 1827, having taught school in the winter vacations of his sophomore and junior years. During his undergraduate years, he was also a member of the Hasty Pudding.

==Career==
After teaching in the Livingstone High School of Geneseo, New York, for two years, he became tutor at Harvard in 1829, university professor of Greek in 1832, and Eliot Professor of Greek Literature in 1834. In 1860 he succeeded James Walker as president of Harvard, which position he held until his death.

He was elected a member of the American Antiquarian Society in 1854.

Felton edited many classical texts. His annotations on Wolf&#x27;s text of the &quot;Iliad&quot; (1833) are especially valuable. &quot;Greece, Ancient and Modern&quot; (2 vols., 1867), forty-nine lectures before the Lowell Institute, is scholarly, able and suggestive of the author&#x27;s personality.

Among his miscellaneous publications are the American edition of Sir William Smith&#x27;s &quot;History of Greece&quot; (1855); translations of Menzel&#x27;s &quot;German Literature&quot; (1840), of Munk&#x27;s &quot;Metres of the Greeks and Romans&quot; (1844), and of Guyot&#x27;s &quot;Earth and Man&quot; (1849); and &quot;Familiar Letters from Europe&quot; (1865).

==Death==
He died of &quot;disease of the heart&quot; while at his brother&#x27;s house in Chester, Pennsylvania, en route to a meeting of the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, D.C. He was buried at Mount Auburn Cemetery.

==Legacy==
A historical marker in the town of West Newbury marks Felton&#x27;s birthplace.

<text>The first ship named in honor of Rear Admiral Aaron Ward, USS &quot;Aaron Ward&quot; (DD-132) was a in service with the United States Navy. In 1940, she was transferred to the Royal Navy and renamed HMS &quot;Castleton&quot;.

==Service history==

===As USS &quot;Aaron Ward&quot;===
She was laid down on 1 August 1918 at Bath, Maine by the Bath Iron Works, launched on 10 April 1919, sponsored by Mrs. Washington Lee Capps, the daughter of Admiral Ward and the wife of Rear Admiral Capps. The ship was commissioned on 21 April 1919 with Lieutenant Commander Raymond A. Spruance in command. Spruance would later rise to the rank of admiral and commanded the United States Fifth Fleet in the Pacific Theater during World War II.

Upon commissioning, the destroyer reported for duty with Destroyer Division 13 (DesDiv 13), Destroyer Squadron 2 (DesRon 2), Atlantic Fleet. She performed her first significant service for the Navy at Trepassey Bay in May 1919 when she served as one of the pickets for the transatlantic flight attempt by three Curtiss NC flying boats. One of the boats—&quot;NC-4&quot;—completed the flight successfully. &quot;Aaron Ward&quot; continued to serve with Atlantic Fleet until September, at which time she was transferred to the Pacific. Her first assignment there consisted of a month of salvage operations in Angeles Bay, Baja California, Mexico, to recover a downed Army DH.4B observation plane and the bodies of its crew who had been murdered by Mexican fishermen. At the conclusion of that mission, she began training operations with the Battle Fleet. On 17 July 1920, the Navy adopted the alphanumeric system of hull designations, and Aaron Ward became DD-132 (before this, she had been Destroyer No. 132). Her work with Battle Fleet was interrupted early in 1921 by two rescue missions near the Panama Canal Zone. Between January and March of that year, she cruised the waters along the coast of the Canal Zone searching for the flying boat &quot;NC-6&quot;, which had crashed in the vicinity. In February, she turned from that mission to pursue another errand of mercy, the rescue of survivors from the destroyer which had sunk after a collision with the merchant vessel on 26 February. &quot;Aaron Ward&quot; resumed normal duty with the Battle Fleet in March 1921, and continued that duty until she was decommissioned on 17 June 1922 and berthed with the Reserve Fleet at San Diego.

The destroyer remained inactive for almost eight years, and then was recommissioned at San Diego on 24 May 1930. After active service until mid-1932, she entered the Rotating Reserve in which she alternated active periods at sea with intervals of inactivity at pierside with a minimal crew embarked. The ship continued in that status until December 1934, when she returned to full activity. On 1 April 1937, the destroyer once more was placed out of commission and returned to the Reserve Fleet. On 30 September 1939, &quot;Aaron Ward&quot; came out of reserve for the final time. Recommissioned on that day (in response to President Franklin D. Roosevelt&#x27;s establishment of the Neutrality Patrol following the outbreak of war in Europe at the beginning of the month), she became flagship of DesDiv 65, Pacific Fleet. In December, she was transferred to the Atlantic Fleet and, on the 11th, arrived at Key West, Florida. For the rest of her U.S. Navy career, she conducted neutrality patrols in the Gulf of Mexico and in the West Indies.
===As HMS &quot;Castleton&quot;===
On 9 September 1940, &quot;Aaron Ward&quot; was decommissioned at Halifax, Nova Scotia. Transferred to Britain as one of the 50 old destroyers leased to that nation in return for the right to establish American bases on British possessions in the Western Hemisphere, she was commissioned in the Royal Navy that same day as HMS &quot;Castleton&quot;. &quot;Castleton&quot; was modified for trade convoy escort service by removal of three of the original /50 caliber guns and one of the triple torpedo tube mounts to reduce topside weight for additional depth charge stowage and installation of a Hedgehog anti-submarine mortar system.
&quot;Castleton&quot; served as convoy escort and as an escort for mine-laying operations for the remainder of the Atlantic campaign. In August 1942 &quot;Castleton&quot; and sister ship apprehended the survivors of , who had taken refuge on an Icelandic trawler after their vessel was sunk by aircraft.
In October 1944 &quot;Castleton&quot; was relegated to duty as an Air Target ship. She was paid off in March 1945 and sold for scrap in January 1948.

<text>Nicholas George Littlemore (born 6 May 1978) is an Australian musician, record producer, singer, songwriter and tour manager. As a musician, he is the frontman of the electronic project Pnau, an ex-member of the art-rock band Teenager and one part of the electro pop-duo Empire of the Sun. As a record producer, he has worked with Elton John, Lover Lover, Groove Armada and Mika. From late 2009, Littlemore had worked with the Cirque Du Soleil as a composer and musical director for the touring arena show &quot;Zarkana&quot;, which debuted on 29 June 2011. His older brother Sam La More is also a musician and record producer. In 2019, he and Peter Mayes launched the label Lab78.

==Biography==

Littlemore was born on 6 May 1978 in Sydney and was raised in Wahroonga with his older brothers, James (later a music video director) and Sam Littlemore (born February 1975, later a musician and producer). In 2011 Littlemore recalled, &quot;[m]y parents didn&#x27;t push us but led us towards creative endeavours. Early on, my brothers and I were naturally interested in that. In school holidays we were doing pottery classes or life drawing. I wasn&#x27;t very sporty&quot;. Their cousin, Xanthe Littlemore, is a singer-songwriter and has toured with Paul Kelly. When Littlemore was 10 years old, he met future bandmate Peter Mayes and the pair were making music together at the age of 13 or 14. Littlemore attended Barker College in Hornsby and finished secondary education in 1996. He attended the College of Fine Arts at the University of New South Wales studying film, sound and performance.
Littlemore and Mayes formed Pnau in the mid-1990s, initially as an acid house and trance band, while still at secondary school. The group have issued four studio albums, &quot;Sambanova&quot; (July 1999), &quot;Again&quot; (October 2003), &quot;Pnau&quot; (January 2007) and &quot;Soft Universe&quot; (July 2011). &quot;Sambanova&quot;, &quot;Pnau&quot; and &quot;Soft Universe&quot; have each peaked into the ARIA Albums Chart Top 40.

While still a member of Pnau, Littlemore has also been involved in side-projects. In 2001 he joined his brother Sam in the group L&#x27;More and issued a single, &quot;Takin&#x27; Hold&quot;. Sam subsequently performed as Sam La More, in April 2003 &quot;Takin&#x27; Hold&quot; was released in the United Kingdom. In 2004 Littlemore formed Teenager as an art rock band in Sydney and asked Pip Brown (aka Ladyhawke) to join on guitar. Brown had relocated to Australia after the disbandment of her New Zealand hard rock group, Two Lane Blacktop. Teenager issued &quot;Thirteen&quot; and the related single &quot;Bound and Gagged&quot; in 2006. Littlemore&#x27;s brother James directed the music video for &quot;Bound and Gagged&quot;. &quot;Mess + Noise&quot;″s Craig Mathieson described the album as &quot;a pop record, albeit a particularly exotic species that equally suggests creative guile and hints of self-indulgence ... &#x27;Pony&#x27; is the closest the album comes to cheap genre holidaying, approximating rock attitude when the organic and desperate growth of &#x27;Bound And Gagged&#x27; is so much more impressive&quot;. Soon after the album&#x27;s appearance Brown left to concentrate on her solo career (i.e. Ladyhawke) and she later credited Littlemore:
In 2000, Littlemore met Luke Steele of alternate rockers The Sleepy Jackson, the pair subsequently collaborated on songwriting and performing. The Sleepy Jackson&#x27;s recorded &quot;Tell the Girls That I&#x27;m Not Hangin&#x27; Out&quot; for their debut album, &quot;Lovers&quot; (2003). It had been co-written by Littlemore, Steele and The Sleepy Jackson&#x27;s Malcolm Clark. The Sleepy Jackson and Pnau both performed &quot;Modern Way&quot;, which was written by Littlemore, Mayes and Steele. In 2007 Pnau issued their self-titled album with Steele supplying lead vocals, and co-writing with Littlemore and Mayes, on &quot;Freedom&quot; and &quot;With You Forever&quot;. Ladyhawke supplied lead vocals on &quot;Embrace&quot; which was co-written by Brown, Littlemore, Mayes and La More.

While working together on &quot;Pnau&quot;, Littlemore and Steele started writing tracks for a side project, initially called Steelemore, which became the electro pop group Empire of the Sun. Littlemore was living in Sydney and Steele, then in Perth, however the pair corresponded and continued composing together. Periodically during 2007, Steele would fly to Sydney where tracks were recorded for Empire of the Sun&#x27;s debut album, &quot;Walking on a Dream&quot;. Mayes assisted with recording and mixing.

To promote &quot;Pnau&quot; internationally, Littlemore and Mayes travelled to London. In December 2007 Elton John heard Pnau&#x27;s &quot;Wild Strawberries&quot; – the lead single from the album – while in Sydney for the Australian leg of his Rocket Man Tour. After hearing the whole album John contacted Littlemore to encourage him. Pnau returned to Australia in January 2008 to perform at Big Day Out and met John who signed the duo with his United Kingdom-based management. Pnau then relocated to London more permanently, both Littlemore and Mayes worked with John. Littlemore and Mayes established a recording studio in London and worked as record producers.

In August 2008, Empire of the Sun issued their debut single, &quot;Walking on a Dream&quot;, which peaked at No. 10 on the ARIA Singles Chart. The second single, &quot;We Are the People&quot;, followed in September with the parent album released in October. The album reached No. 6 on the ARIA Albums Chart. In February 2009, Littlemore told Linda McGee of Raidió Teilifís Éireann (RTÉ) that Empire of the Sun planned to tour in August but not as a group &quot;this is not a band project. We&#x27;re not going to stand up there with guitar, bass, drums and a keyboard player and just play our songs out in a merry Indie kind of way&quot;. He described a more theatrical presentation, &quot;I&#x27;ve just finished the first draft of the script and it&#x27;s going to be more of a play, for want of a better term. So at the moment we&#x27;ve got people working in China building inflatable sets and all kinds of things and we&#x27;re working with some theatre directors in London&quot;. However, from April to September that year, Steele could not contact Littlemore. From September Empire of the Sun, without Littlemore, performed live tours of Australia.

Littlemore&#x27;s bands have won eight ARIA Music Awards, with one in 2000 for &#x27;Best Dance Release&#x27; for Pnau&#x27;s &quot;Sambanova&quot;, and seven in 2009 for Empire of the Sun&#x27;s album &quot;Walking on a Dream&quot; and the title song. Empire of the Sun – without Littlemore – performed &quot;Walking on a Dream&quot; at the ceremony with Steele collecting the awards on the band&#x27;s behalf, he quipped &quot;German Shepherd [&quot;sic&quot;] Steele gets another award ... Everybody say hi to invisible Nick!&quot;. Ladyhawke also won two awards for her solo work.

Since 2009 Littlemore has received medication to treat arthritis. From late 2009 Littlemore worked in Montreal, Canada with the Cirque Du Soleil as a composer and musical director for the touring arena show, &quot;Zarkana&quot;, which debuted on 29 June 2011 in New York. Pnau&#x27;s fourth album, &quot;Soft Universe&quot;, was recorded in London. Upon its release Mayes confirmed Littlemore and Steele were working on a second Empire of the Sun album. Littlemore expanded, &quot;We just started writing two or three weeks ago in New York ... Luke and I got into a studio, which was run by blind people – it was great. It&#x27;s good to be in weird places with Luke, we enjoy that. He has an extraordinary mind – it&#x27;s sounding so good&quot;. As from July 2011, when not touring or performing, he lives in LA. During late 2011 Pnau toured through Australia promoting their album.

<doc id="757417" wikidata="Q1669492" url="?curid=757417" title="Prince Edward station">
<text>Prince Edward is a station of the MTR rapid transit system in Hong Kong. It is located in Mong Kok, Kowloon, under the intersection of Nathan Road and Prince Edward Road West, after which it is named.

==History==
Prince Edward was primarily designed as a cross-platform interchange between the Kwun Tong and s. While the Kwun Tong line tracks had already been built in 1979, the station was not used until the opening of the Tsuen Wan line on 10 May 1982. During the first week of operation, the station served only as an interchange with no exits to the concourse or street level. On 17 May 1982, all the station&#x27;s exits were opened.

=== Prince Edward station attack ===

On the evening of 31 August 2019, amid the anti-extradition bill protests, the Hong Kong Police stormed Prince Edward station and were filmed beating passengers and firing pepper spray inside railway carriages. The MTR closed the station during the incident, while the police refused to let medics enter. The station subsequently became a flashpoint for continued discord, with protesters petitioning MTR to release CCTV footage from the evening of 31 August. The incident at Prince Edward, as well as MTR&#x27;s perceived support of Beijing (by closing stations near protests in the aftermath of criticism by Chinese state media for remaining operational), led to vandalism of other MTR stations. MTR condemned the vandalism and responded that the relevant CCTV footage would be kept for three years.

==Location==
Prince Edward station and Mong Kok station are the two closest stations in Hong Kong. They are only apart, trains take less than one minute to travel from one station to the other.

== Station layout ==
Prince Edward is an opposite-directional cross-platform interchange station for the southbound Kwun Tong line passengers going towards and the southbound Tsuen Wan line passengers going towards . Mong Kok serves as the cross-platform interchange station for passengers travelling in the same direction.

===Livery===
The station&#x27;s colour is light purple because of its association as a regal colour.

=== Entrances and exits ===
All exits are within one block of Nathan Road, stretching from Prince Edward Road in the south to Playing Field Road in the north. Prince Edward station is primarily an interchange rather than a destination since there are only seven exits; the neighbouring Mong Kok has fifteen.
* A:Playing Field Road
* B:Mong Kok Police Station
** B1:Flower Market Road
** B2:Sai Yeung Choi Street South
* C:Metropark Hotel Mongkok
** C1:Nathan Road
** C2:Tai Nan Street
* D:Yu Chau Street
* E:Cheung Sha Wan Road

==Transport connections==

===Cross-border bus services ===
There are stops of cross-border buses to Shenzhen, Dongguan, and Guangzhou on Playing Field Road (exit A) or Portland Street (exits C2 and D).

<doc id="757421" wikidata="Q233067" url="?curid=757421" title="Salome (disciple)">
<text>In the New Testament, Salome was a follower of Jesus who appears briefly in the canonical gospels and in apocryphal writings. She is named by Mark as present at the crucifixion and as one of the Myrrhbearers, the women who found Jesus&#x27;s empty tomb. Interpretation has further identified her with other women who are mentioned but not named in the canonical gospels. In particular, she is often identified as the wife of Zebedee, the mother of James and John, two of the Twelve apostles. In medieval tradition Salome (as Mary Salome) was counted as one of the Three Marys who were daughters of Saint Anne, so making her the sister or half-sister of Mary, mother of Jesus.

==Name==
&quot;Salome&quot; may be the Hellenized form of a Hebrew name derived from the root word (&quot;shalom&quot;), meaning &quot;peace&quot;.

The name was a common one; apart from the famous dancing &quot;daughter of Herodias&quot;, both a sister and daughter of Herod the Great were called Salome, as well as Queen Salome Alexandra (d. 67 BC), the last independent ruler of Judea.

==In the canonical gospels==

In Mark , Salome is named as one of the women present at the crucifixion who also ministered to Jesus: &quot;There were also women looking on afar off: among whom was Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James and of Joses; and Salome who also followed Him and ministered to Him when he was in Galilee. And many other women who followed Him to Jerusalem.&quot;(, King James Version) The parallel passage of Matthew reads thus: &quot;Among which was Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James and Joses, and the mother of Zebedee&#x27;s children.&quot; The Catholic Encyclopedia (1913) concludes that the Salome of Mark 15:40 is probably identical with the mother of the sons of Zebedee in Matthew; the latter is also mentioned in Matthew 20:20, in which she petitions Jesus to let her sons sit with him in Paradise.

In John, three, or perhaps four, women are mentioned at the crucifixion; this time they are named as Jesus&#x27; &quot;mother, and his mother&#x27;s sister, Mary the wife of Cleophas, and Mary Magdalene.&quot; (John KJV) A common interpretation identifies Salome as the sister of Jesus&#x27; mother, thus making her Jesus&#x27; aunt. Traditional interpretations associate Mary the wife of Cleophas (the third woman in the Gospel of John) with Mary the mother of James son of Alphaeus (the third woman in the Gospel of Matthew).

In the Gospel of Mark, Salome is among the women who went to Jesus&#x27; tomb to anoint his body with spices. &quot;And when the sabbath was past, Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James, and Salome, had bought sweet spices, that they might come and anoint him.&quot; (Mark KJV) They discovered that the stone had been rolled away, and a young man in white then told them that Jesus had risen, and told them to tell Jesus&#x27; disciples that he would meet them in Galilee. In Matthew 28:1, two women are mentioned in the parallel passage: Mary Magdalene and the &quot;other Mary&quot; identified previously in Matthew 27:56 as Mary the mother of James and Joses.

The canonical gospels never go so far as to label Salome a &quot;disciple&quot; (&quot;pupil&quot; &quot;mathētēs&quot;), and so mainstream Christian writers usually describe her as a &quot;follower&quot; of Jesus per references to the women who &quot;followed&quot; and &quot;ministered&quot; to Jesus (Mark 15:41). However, feminist critiques have argued that the mainstream tradition consistently underplays the significance of Jesus&#x27;s female supporters.

==In non-canonical works==

The Gospel of Thomas found at Nag Hammadi mentions among the &quot;disciples&quot; of Jesus two women, Salome and Mary. 

The Diatessaron, which is part of the Ante-Nicene Fathers collection, separates Salome and the mother of the sons of Zebedee as two distinct persons, contrary to tradition that identify them. &quot;And there were in the distance all the acquaintance of Jesus standing, and the women that came with Him from Galilee, those that followed Him and ministered. One of them was Mary Magdalene; and Mary the mother of James the little and Joses, and the mother of the sons of Zebedee, and Salome, and many others which came up with Him unto Jerusalem.&quot; (Diatessaron 52:21–23)

The controversial &quot;Secret Gospel of Mark&quot;, that was referred to and quoted in the Mar Saba letter ascribed by his modern editors to Clement of Alexandria, contains a further mention of Salome which is not present in the canonical &quot;Mark&quot; at 10:46. Clement quotes the passage in his letter: &quot;Then he came into Jericho. And the sister of the young man whom Jesus loved was there with his mother and Salome, but Jesus would not receive them.&quot; The lines complete a well-known lacuna in &quot;Mark&quot; as the text currently stands.

In the non-canonical &quot;Greek Gospel of the Egyptians&quot; (2nd century), Salome appears again as a disciple of Jesus. She asks him how long death would hold sway, and he says to her, &quot;So long as women bring forth, for I come to end the works of the female.&quot; To this Salome replies, &quot;Then I have done well in not bringing forth.&quot; It would appear from this text that there was an early tradition that Salome the disciple was childless, and possibly unmarried.

In the &quot;Gospel of Thomas&quot; there is a reference to Jesus reclining on a couch and eating at a table that belonged to Salome and being asked by her: &quot;Who are you sir, that you have taken your place on my couch and eaten from my table?&quot; Jesus answers: &quot;I am he who is from the One, and the things that belong to the Father have been given to me.&quot; Salome replies, &quot;But I am your disciple&quot;, and Jesus answers, &quot;When the disciple is united he will be filled with light, but if he is divided he will be filled with darkness.&quot;

A 2nd-century Greek, Celsus, wrote a &quot;True Discourse&quot; attacking the Christian sects as a threat to the Roman state. He described the variety of Christian sects at the time he was writing, , as extremely broad. His treatise is lost, but quotes survive in the attack written somewhat later by Origen, (&quot;Against Celsus&quot;): &quot;While some of the Christians proclaim [that] they have the same god as do the Jews, others insist that there is another god higher than the creator-god and opposed to him. And some Christians teach that the Son came from this higher god. Still others admit of a third god – those, that is to say, who call themselves gnostics – and still others, though calling themselves Christians, want to live according to the laws of the Jews. I could also mention those who call themselves Simonians after Simon, and those naming themselves Helenians after Helen, his consort. There are Christian sects named after Marcellina, Harpocratian Christians who trace themselves to Salome, and some who follow Mariamne and others who follow Martha, and still others who call themselves Marcionites after their leader, Marcion.&quot;

In the early Christian texts, there are several other references to &quot;Salome&quot;. A Salome appears in the infancy gospel attached to the name of James the Just, the Protevangelion of James, ch. XIV:
:&quot;14 And the midwife went out from the cave, and Salome met her. 15 And the midwife said to her, &quot;Salome, Salome, I will tell you a most surprising thing, which I saw. 16 A virgin has brought forth, which is a thing contrary to nature.&quot; 17 To which Salome replied, &quot;As the Lord my God lives, unless I receive particular proof of this matter, I will not believe that a virgin has brought forth.&quot;

:18 Then Salome went in, and the midwife said, &quot;Mary, show yourself, for a great controversy has arisen about you.&quot; 19 And Salome tested her with her finger. 20 But her hand was withered, and she groaned bitterly, 21 and said, &quot;Woe to me, because of my iniquity! For I have tempted the living God, and my hand is ready to drop off.&quot;

That Salome is the first, after the midwife, to bear witness to the Miraculous Birth and to recognize Jesus as the Christ, are circumstances that tend to connect her with Salome the disciple. By the High Middle Ages this Salome was often (but not always) identified with Mary Salome in the West, and therefore regarded as the believing midwife.

An apocryphal Coptic Book of the Resurrection of Christ, attributed to the apostle Bartholomew, names the women who went to the tomb. Among them were: Mary Magdalene; Mary the mother of James, whom Jesus delivered out of the hand of Satan; Mary who ministered to him; Martha her sister; Joanna (perhaps also Susanna) who renounced the marriage bed; and &quot;Salome 
who tempted him&quot;.

==Sainthood==
Saint Salome is commemorated in the Eastern Orthodox Church on the Sunday of the Myrrhbearers, i.e., the third Sunday of Pascha (Easter), and on 3 August.

Her feast day in the Latin liturgical rites of the Catholic Church is 24 April.

She is commemorated in The Episcopal Church on 3 August, as listed in &quot;Lesser Feasts and Fasts 2022&quot; as: &quot;Joanna, Mary, and Salome, Myrrh-Bearing Women.&quot; 

In the Calendar of Saints of the Lutheran Church–Missouri Synod, her feast is on 3 August with Joanna and Mary.

In art, she is often portrayed with the Holy Family in paintings of the Holy Kinship. She is also portrayed holding a thurible as a symbol of her sacrifice and faith in Jesus Christ.

==Legend of Saint Anne&#x27;s three husbands==
According to a legend propounded by Haymo of Auxerre in the mid-9th century, but rejected by the Council of Trent, Saint Anne had, by different husbands, three daughters, all of whom bore the name Mary and who are referred to as the Three Marys:
* Mary, the mother of Jesus
* Mary of Clopas
* Salome, in this tradition called Mary Salome (as in the tradition of the three Marys at the tomb)

Mary Magdalene is not part of this group. Mary Salome thus becomes the half-sister of the Virgin Mary.

This account was included in the &quot;Golden Legend&quot; of Jacobus de Voragine, written in about 1260. It was the subject of a long poem in rhymed French written in about 1357 by Jean de Venette. The poem is preserved in a mid-15th-century manuscript on vellum containing 232 pages written in columns. The titles are in red and illuminated in gold. It is decorated with seven miniatures in monochrome gray.
For some centuries, religious art throughout Germany and the Low Countries frequently presented Saint Anne with her husbands, daughters, sons-in-law and grandchildren as a group known as the Holy Kinship. During the Reformation the idea of the three husbands was rejected by Protestants, and by the Council of Trent by Catholic theologians also, but Salome continued to be regarded as probably the sister of the Virgin Mary, and the wife of Zebedee, and mother of the two apostles. The Catholic Encyclopedia of 1913 said (rather more cautiously than leading 19th-century Protestant books of biblical reference) that &quot;some writers conjecture more or less plausibly that she is the sister of the Blessed Virgin mentioned in John 19:25&quot;.

<text>SK Broadband, Inc. , formerly known as Hanaro Telecom, is a Seoul-based telecommunications company and a wholly owned subsidiary of SK Telecom. It is one of the largest broadband Internet access providers in South Korea. Until its takeover in 2008, Hanaro controlled nearly half of the Korean landline market, as it was the only last mile-competitive local exchange carrier (CLEC) other than the state-owned KT Corp. SK Broadband also has a division known as &quot;Broad &amp;&quot; that controls a large portion of the South Korean calling card market.

In October 2014, SK Broadband unveiled the world&#x27;s first 10 Gbit/s Internet service at the ITU Plenipotentiary Conference. The new Internet service is 100 times faster than existing LAN services in South Korea, which deliver download speeds of 100 Mbit/s.

==History==
Originally a domestic fixed-line carrier, Hanaro Telecom entered the broadband market in 1999 and grew from there to become a ‘Triple-Play’ provider with VoIP service, broadband Internet and an IPTV service branded as B.TV. In addition, Hanaro Telecom provides leased line services and IDC services to its corporate clients.

Since 2000, Hanaro has participated in the Cisco Powered Network Program, a joint marketing program between Cisco and network service providers which offers public services over a network powered by Cisco Systems equipment. Hanaro Telecom and Korea Thrunet shared about 45 percent of the broadband market, with Korea Telecom, South Korea&#x27;s incumbent telecommunications operator, commanding around 50 percent as of 2002. To consolidate its position in the broadband market, Hanaro acquired its second largest rival, Korea Thrunet, in March 2005 for 471.4 billion won ($460 million); the final price was five percent less than Hanaro&#x27;s original offer to outbid Dacom.

In February 2008, Hanaro Telecom was acquired by local wireless giant SK Telecom for 1.09 trillion won ($1.2 billion). Its new name, SK Broadband, was adopted in September 2008. In 2015, SK Telecom bought all of SK Broadband&#x27;s stocks in a stock swap deal, the deal was finalized on July 1, 2015, and SK Broadband became a wholly owned subsidiary of SK Telecom.

In November 2015, SK Telecom agreed to acquire a 30% stake in competitor CJ HelloVision for KRW 500 billion. The acquisition will make SK Broadband the No. 2 paid cable broadcaster in South Korea, following KT.

In September 2021, SK Broadband sued American pay television service Netflix to pay for the increased network costs and bandwidth which it blames on popular shows such as &quot;Squid Game&quot;. SK Broadband claims that Netflix’s traffic on the ISP network has exponentially increased about 24 times, from 50 Gigabits per second in May 2018 to 1,200 Gigabits in September 2021.

It is also the headquarters of the Nanzen-ji branch of Rinzai Zen. The precincts of Nanzen-ji are a nationally designated Historic Site and the Hōjō gardens a Place of Scenic Beauty. The temple was destroyed in a fire in 1895 and rebuilt in 1909.

==History==
Nanzen-ji was founded in the middle Kamakura period (1291, or Shōō 4 in the Japanese era system). It was destroyed by fire in 1393, 1447, and 1467, rebuilt in 1597, and expanded in the Edo era. A large complex, it has varied over time between nine and twelve sub-temples.

Zenkei Shibayama, who provided a popular commentary on the Mumonkan, was an abbot of the monastery.

== Significance in Zen Buddhism ==
Nanzen-ji is not itself considered one of the &quot;five great Zen temples of Kyoto&quot;; however, it does play an important role in the &quot;Five Mountain System&quot; which was modified from Chinese roots. is considered to be one of the so-called or &quot;five great Zen temples of Kyoto&quot;, along with , , , and . The head temple presiding over the &quot;Gozan&quot; in Kyoto is Nanzen-ji. After the completion of Shōkoku-ji by Ashikaga Yoshimitsu in 1386, a new ranking system was created with Nanzen-ji at the top and in a class of its own. Nanzen-ji had the title of &quot;First Temple of The Land&quot; and played a supervising role.


== Notable structures ==
=== Sanmon ===

The temple&#x27;s Sanmon gate was originally constructed in the 13th century, destroyed in 1369 at the order of the government, and reconstructed in 1628. The gate contains stairs to an elevated viewing area, which was the setting for a famous scene in the 1778 Kabuki play Sanmon Gosan no Kiri inspired by the story of the criminal Ishikawa Goemon who is said to have spoken of the beauty of the view (but who was executed prior to the construction of the current gate).

=== Hōjō ===
The hōjō (abbot&#x27;s quarters) of Nanzen-ji is notable both for its gardens and its art.

The garden of the hōjō is considered one of the most significant examples of karesansui gardens (rock gardens), and was built in the 1600s by Kobori Enshu. The garden mirrors natural forms, and is seventy percent gravel. It has been designated a national Place of Scenic Beauty.

The hōjō itself, also known as the Seiryo-den, was given to the temple by the Emperor Go-Yōzei. It contains a variety of important screen paintings on gold backgrounds, including two of tigers by Kanō Tan&#x27;yū. It has been designated a National Treasure.

=== Nanzen-ji Aqueduct ===
Constructed in 1890 through the temple grounds to carry irrigation water from the Lake Biwa Canal.

==In media==
Parts of the 2003 film &quot;Lost in Translation&quot; were filmed there.

<doc id="757434" wikidata="Q3915969" url="?curid=757434" title="Ira Magaziner">
<text>Ira Magaziner (born November 8, 1947) is an American advisor. He was born in New York City, New York, US. After being a student activist and business consultant, Magaziner became the senior advisor for policy development for President Clinton, especially as chief healthcare policy advisor. He now serves in a leadership capacity for two of the Bill, Hillary &amp; Chelsea Clinton Foundation&#x27;s international development initiatives, which are at the forefront of non-governmental organizations in addressing global health and environmental issues.

== Student activism ==
During his college years at Brown University, Magaziner was one of the two architects of the &quot;New Curriculum&quot;, a liberal academic approach which eliminates core requirements outside of the concentration the student pursues. Magaziner excelled academically at Brown and in 1969 was named valedictorian of his class.

During the 1968 black student walkout at the University, Magaziner held rallies in support of their demands, and as president of the Undergraduate Council of Students, he negotiated with the administration on the terms of their return. His valedictory address at graduation was featured in a 1969 &quot;Life&quot; magazine special on student leaders—a special which also included a story about a recent Wellesley College graduate, future First Lady, New York Senator, and Secretary of State Hillary Rodham. After his address, Magaziner led the students in turning their backs on Henry Kissinger, who was receiving an honorary degree. Magaziner also organized Brown&#x27;s Spring Weekend concerts and festivities.

He was named a Rhodes Scholar upon graduation and studied political philosophy and economics under Isaiah Berlin at Balliol College of the University of Oxford. While studying at Oxford, Magaziner met Bill Clinton, also a Rhodes Scholar, who would become a close friend and eventually boss in the 1990s. After two years, Magaziner left the program without earning a degree to organize protest rallies against the Vietnam War—at one point in cooperation with actress Vanessa Redgrave.

After Oxford, Magaziner and a group of former Brown students attempted to implement social democratic reforms in the city of Brockton, Massachusetts. These reforms included starting an agricultural cooperative, supporting liberal candidates for city council, strengthening the union movement, and printing a progressive town newspaper. Magaziner soon abandoned the project, after the group recognized that the effects of foreign business competition on the local manufacturing base would undercut their efforts. He then determined that a greater understanding of business was necessary to promote broad-based social and economic reforms.

== Business consulting ==
Magaziner went on to work for the Boston Consulting Group in Boston, London and Tokyo from 1973 to 1979. He founded Telesis in 1979, sold the company in 1986 to Towers Perrin Inc. and managed the U.S. strategy practice for Towers Perrin from 1986 to 1989. Throughout his consulting career, Magaziner&#x27;s client list has included General Electric, Corning Glass, the Governments of Ireland and Sweden and other high-tech manufacturing and health care companies.

Magaziner also has had significant influence in Rhode Island. Working alongside Governor J. Joseph Garrahy, he devised a state economic plan, known as the &quot;Greenhouse Compact&quot;, which, upon approval by the voters, aimed to resolve several key economic issues in the state, to create several business &quot;incubators&quot;, and to stimulate state exports. While initially popular among state legislators, and some civic and business leaders, it was ultimately voted down by referendum. Magaziner and his family continue to support prominent Democratic Rhode Island politicians and other social causes, including the Rhode Island Food Bank.

Magaziner has authored two books on business strategy and industrial policy: &quot;Minding America&#x27;s Business&quot; and &quot;The Silent War&quot;. The former, co-authored with future Clinton Secretary of Labor Robert Reich, laid out a plan for U.S. industrial policy in the late 1970s and early 1980s, and received critical acclaim. Emphasis was placed on eliminating subsidies for inefficient American industries, and applying fiscal and industrial policy strategies to stimulate growth in sectors for which the U.S. had &quot;cost-advantage.&quot; &quot;The Silent War&quot;, co-authored with &quot;Providence Journal&quot; columnist Mark Patinkin, tells the story of international business competition in the early 1990s, and Magaziner&#x27;s experiences in dealing with different countries&#x27; relationships to their corporate base.

== The Clinton years ==
Magaziner is best known for leading, along with Hillary Clinton, the failed Task Force to Reform Health Care in the early Clinton administration, which aimed to implement a managed competition regime for the health insurance industry, and to establish community rated insurance pools to cut costs for small businesses and the uninsured. The plan was widely criticized for being too complex. Pharmaceutical companies and health insurance companies waged a broad-based ad-campaign against the plan, which included the famous &quot;Harry and Louise&quot; ads. Despite the attacks by Republicans and industry associations, Magaziner did little to respond. People within the administration criticized Magaziner&#x27;s blunt and domineering approach, attacking critics who disagreed instead of trying to build consensus.

Brad DeLong, Deputy Treasury Secretary for the Clinton administration at the time, argues that Magaziner&#x27;s failures stemmed from having a background in management consulting instead of policy: &quot;A management consultant&#x27;s principal goal is to win a debate in front of his employer ... by making intellectual arguments, controlling the flow of information..., [and] walling-off potential adversaries from the process ... You develop a policy by forming a large coalition ... Then you have a large group of people who are enthusiastic about the proposal: they will go out and make your arguments for you.&quot;

Magaziner was court ordered to pay $285,864 to the Association of American Physicians and Surgeons, in 1997 by a federal judge for alleged cover up of whether the Task Force to Reform Health Care hired non-governmental employees and therefore had to release documents from their strategic deliberations upon public request. Magaziner was subsequently cleared of all allegations and the fine was overturned by unanimous decision of the United States Court of Appeals on August 25, 1999.

Magaziner stayed in the administration and worked to develop an E-Commerce policy initiative with OSTP staff and industry advisors. That initiative evolved to include a facilitative role in the formation of the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers to assume Internet administrative activities previously maintained by the US DARPA.

== Clinton Health Access Initiative ==
Since 2002, Magaziner is the chief executive officer and vice chairman of the Clinton Health Access Initiative (CHAI), which works to save lives in low and middle income countries by helping people gain access to essential medicines and health services.

== Personal life ==
Magaziner lives in Bristol, Rhode Island, with his wife Suzanne. He has three children: Seth, Jonathan, and Sarah. Seth Magaziner was elected General Treasurer of Rhode Island in 2014. On September 14, 2021, Seth announced his candidacy for governor, focusing on issues that included women&#x27;s rights, clean energy, reducing gun violence, fiscal responsibility, pandemic response and school improvement. Seth was elected to Congress in 2022, representing Rhode Island&#x27;s 2nd district. 

Magaziner repeatedly flew on Jeffrey Epstein’s jets and his personal phone number and private email were in Epstein’s “black book.”

<text>Chelsea Cameron (née Noble; born Nancy Mueller; December 4, 1964) is an American actress known for her role as Kate McDonnell on the ABC television sitcom &quot;Growing Pains&quot; (1989–1992). 

Noble is married to her former &quot;Growing Pains&quot; co-star, Kirk Cameron. She is also the sister-in-law of former &quot;Full House&quot; star, Candace Cameron Bure.

==Biography==
In 1988, Noble made her acting debut, appearing on &quot;Full House&quot; while she was dating series star, John Stamos. She also appeared on several episodes of &quot;Days of Our Lives.&quot; She co-starred on &quot;Growing Pains&quot; as Kate McDonnell and &quot;Kirk&quot; as Elizabeth Waters with Kirk Cameron.

Noble appeared in a 1997 episode of &quot;Seinfeld&quot; titled &quot;The English Patient&quot;. She co-starred as Hattie Durham in the &quot;Left Behind&quot; trilogies with Cameron. Prior to the those trilogies, Noble and Cameron co-starred in &quot;A Little Piece of Heaven&quot; with Cloris Leachman.

Noble has had several uncredited cameos in films starring Cameron as a &quot;kissing double&quot;. Cameron refused to kiss any woman who was not his wife, so for romantic scenes, the actress playing his love interest was replaced by Noble in an appropriate costume and filmed from a distance or behind. This can be seen in the fire station scene in the 2008 movie, &quot;Fireproof&quot;. In 2014, she co-starred with her husband in the independent movie &quot;Mercy Rule&quot;, playing a married couple with two children. Although not the first movie in which they have played husband and wife (having done so in &quot;Growing Pains&quot;), this is the first time Noble has been credited as Chelsea Cameron.

Noble met Kirk Cameron when he was visiting his sister Candace on the set of &quot;Full House.&quot; They later co-starred on &quot;Growing Pains&quot; together. The couple got married on July 21, 1991, in Cheektowaga, New York, and have six children — four adopted and two biological. The Camerons are both Christians. They founded The Firefly Foundation, which runs Camp Firefly.

<doc id="757447" wikidata="Q2168885" url="?curid=757447" title="NZ Touring Cars Championship">
<text>The New Zealand Touring Cars Championship (currently known as the Racer Products V8s for commercial reasons) is a New Zealand–based motorsport category of touring car racing. MotorSport New Zealand, New Zealand&#x27;s national governing and sanctioning body for motorsport, awarded the category &quot;New Zealand Touring Car Championship&quot; title status in 1996. Since being awarded national championship title status, drivers and teams across New Zealand had raced in what was at the time New Zealand&#x27;s premier motorsport category. In 2020, MotorSport New Zealand withdrew title status, awarding it to the new TCR New Zealand Series.

==History==
The New Zealand V8s category journeys to various race tracks around New Zealand. This series somewhat resembles but differs in many ways from the Australian V8 Supercars, primarily in terms of the level of technology. The NZ V8 series focuses on cost containment and control to make sure that the series is not dominated by one make or team. It is technically more basic than the Supercars, but also tends to be a bit more spectacular with a lot more close-action racing due to limited grip and braking capabilities. Unlike the Supercars, the NZV8 races are all sprint races so there is no requirement for elaborate pit crew setups. (In previous years a 500 km endurance race was run, but this has been dropped). The vehicles themselves are visually almost indistinguishable from Supercars, and grids are typically 10 to 28 vehicles in size. A number of Australian Supercars drivers now race in the NZV8&#x27;s such as David Besnard, Luke Youlden and Cameron McLean for example, as the series has come to be recognised as an outstanding class in its own right, rather than a poor cousin of the Australian V8 Supercars. Supercars teams have previously been involved; Team Kiwi Racing has run two-car teams in the series in the past as a development groun.

The winner of the 2005/2006 season was Kayne Scott driving a Holden Commodore, who took the trophy after a controversial season that initially saw Angus Fogg (Ford Falcon) awarded the trophy, only to lose it in the court room. The 05/06 season saw Fords dominating for the first time, and there were loud cries of lack of parity from the Holden teams. It was clear that the Falcons had a considerable edge over the Holdens in power in the low and mid-range, so significant that MSNZ changed the rules and allowed the use of a carb spacer on the Holdens to shift their torque curve. This saw an improvement in the competitiveness of the Holden teams, with Holden driver Kayne Scott dicing for the championship lead. However, Andy Booth was the only other Holden driver consistently in the top-ten, and the Falcons continued to dominate in general. The series was ultimately won in convincing style by Johnny McIntyre in a Ford.

The 07/08 season has seen a dramatic shift towards entries from Ford teams, with Fords outnumbering Holdens by nearly two to one, and many existing Holden-based teams switching to Ford, including former champion Kayne Scott. This is a direct result of the perceived lack of parity over the last two seasons, with the Fords being significantly more competitive. However, any disparity between the two camps is questionable after the first round of the 07/08 season at Pukekohe; John McIntyre (Ford) produced a convincing opening round win, but was dogged all the way by Andy Booth (Holden) who was clearly equal in performance and handling. That said, former champion Paul Manuell was the only other Holden to finish the round in the top 10.

The 07/08 season also sees a reduction to six rounds in the championship. A seventh round is still run in conjunction with the New Zealand round of the Australian V8 Supercars, but due to a conflict in television broadcasting rights it no longer forms part of the NZ competition series, and is instead treated as a separate trophy round. The 07/08 season also sees former V8 Supercar driver and two-times FIA World Touring Car champion Paul Radisich, driving a Ford Falcon in the series.
The 08/09 season was a neck and neck battle between Ford BA Falcon drivers Kayne Scott and John McIntyre, with Scott winning the title by a mere 9 points. Third was versitel driver Craig Baird.

The 09/10 season again was a close battle. This time Craig Baird came out on top from John McIntyre. McIntyre had nightmare meeting at the fourth round at Timaru failing to finish any of the three races. Baird won by 75 points. Third was defending champions Kayne Scott.

The 10/11 season was boiled with controversy. Kayne Scott was stripped of his first six rounds points for technical infringements, as was visiting Australian V8 Supercars driver Jason Bargwanna at Ruapuna. Scott and his team were livid with the ruling which handed the title to John McIntyre with Craig Baird runner up and Andy Booth in third.

==Scoring system==
==The car==

* Power: The engine is a controlled 5.0L V8 (R302ci for the Ford Falcon and 304ci for the Holden Commodore). Most parts of the engine are controlled and unlike the Australian Touring Cars (Supercars Championship) which uses fuel injection, the series uses a controlled carburettor. The other control parts for the engine are manifolds, exhausts, cam-shafts, rockers, air-filter/cold air box and ignition. The engines are rev-limited to 6400rpm. Top speed is 240 km/h.
* Gearbox: The gearing of a NZ V8 is also controlled. All teams use a controlled 4 speed gearbox produced by Richmond. The gear set, clutch, flywheel and gearbox are also controlled and made by Richmond.
* Tyres: A controlled Dunlop D14 non tread &quot;slick&quot; and R92 W08 treaded wet weather tyre. The contact patch is very small and therefore there is very little grip. Only six new tyres are given out to teams per round to spice up racing.
* Brakes: Brakes are controlled Wilwood six-piston front and four-piston rear brakes with controlled calipers, rotors and pedal box.
*Aero: A standard aerodynamic package (which is very similar to an Australian V8 Supercar in terms of look) of a rear wing and end plates/mounting pedestals, a front splitter and side skirts are supplied to the teams of each make.
*Suspension: Control Koni shock absorbers. Bars and springs are not controlled.
*Bodyshell: Each car is loosely based on either the Holden VY Commodore or Ford BA Falcon production bodyshells, with an elaborate roll cage constructed into the shell from aircraft grade materials. Other modifications include wider wheel arches and pick up points for the front splitter and rear wing.
*Weight: Minimum weight is 1420 kg with the driver included.
*Cost: Has been said that costs can have been over NZ$100,000 to build a NZ V8 and up to NZ$400,000 to build a car from scratch and running costs.

*Manfeild Autocourse
*Teretonga Park

==Champions==
Motorsport NZ granted championship status to the V8 class for the 1996–97 season, at which time it was officially known as TraNZam Lights. The class was renamed to NZ V8 Touring Cars for 1998/99, to NZV8s for 2005/06 and to NZV8s at the commencement of the 2007/08 season. It became NZ Touring Cars for the 2015/16 season then for the 2017/18 season was named the BNT V8s due to naming rights. .

<doc id="757467" wikidata="Q4824581" url="?curid=757467" title="Australian Progressive Alliance">
<text>The Australian Progressive Alliance (APA) was a minor &quot;small-l-liberal&quot; political party in Australia, formed by Meg Lees, an independent senator and former leader of the Australian Democrats, in April 2003. The party ceased to operate and was deregistered in June 2005 following Senator Lees&#x27;s defeat at the 2004 election and the expiry of her term.

==History==
Meg Lees resigned from the Democrats in July 2002 after being deposed as the party&#x27;s leader in April 2001. She sat as an independent in the Senate before forming the APA in 2003. Other APA members included the former Democrat Queensland Senator John Woodley and Elisabeth Kirkby, a former Democrat member of the New South Wales Legislative Council.

==Policy==
Lees sought to position the APA as a party of the moderate centre, arguing that the Democrats, under the leadership of Cheryl Kernot, Natasha Stott Despoja and Andrew Bartlett, had moved too far to the left. In a 2003 opinion article, she claimed the party would appeal to &quot;voters who cannot be dragged to the extremes by the Greens in any enduring way.&quot;

The party&#x27;s &quot;guiding principles&quot; were described as:

*To act with integrity, tolerance and compassion.
*To respect the freedom of the individual particularly the freedoms of association, expression and religion.
*To uphold a system of constitutional checks and balances in government, particularly the separation of powers and the rule of law.
*To commit to a socially just, environmentally responsible and economically sustainable Australia, working for a balance between, and the integration of, social needs, the protection and care of Australia&#x27;s unique biodiversity and the equitable collection and spending of revenue.
*To work for positive solutions for all Australians and not be controlled by any one particular group in the community.

==2004 Senate election==
At the 2004 federal election, the party stood Senate candidates in NSW, Victoria, Queensland, Western Australia and the ACT in addition to Meg Lees (South Australia). Lees achieved 11,061 votes (1.14%) in her state, losing her seat, while the others brought the national total to 18,856 (0.16%).

<doc id="757481" wikidata="Q6235638" url="?curid=757481" title="John Golding (British politician)">
<text>John Golding (9 March 1931 – 20 January 1999) was a Labour Party politician and trade union leader in the United Kingdom.

==Biography==
He was educated at Chester City Grammar School, Keele University and the London School of Economics. After some time working in the Civil Service he took up a research job with the Post Office Engineering Union.

Golding was elected Member of Parliament (MP) for Newcastle-under-Lyme at a by-election in 1969. He served in the governments of Harold Wilson and James Callaghan, as PPS to Eric Varley as Minister of Technology, a Labour whip in opposition, and Minister for Employment. He was an outspoken opponent of Labour left-wingers such as Tony Benn and Eric Heffer, whom he regarded as idle dreamers out of touch with the working-class.

Golding was a key figure in opposing the entryist Militant tendency, and especially in mobilising moderate trade union leaders to exercise their block votes to achieve this end. After he died, his writings were published under the title &quot;Hammer of the Left: My Part in Defeating the Labour Left&quot;, by John Golding and Paul Farrelly (see below).

In 1986, he left Parliament (by applying for the Chiltern Hundreds) to take up the post of General Secretary of the National Communications Union. He held this post until 1988. He had served as a member of the council of the Trades Union Congress.

After he vacated the Newcastle-under-Lyme seat, the resulting by-election was won by his wife Llin, who held the seat until retiring in 2001; her successor in the seat was Paul Farrelly.

John Golding&#x27;s most unusual claim to fame is that he once made a speech in committee lasting eleven hours and fifteen minutes. It nominally concerned a small amendment to the bill to privatise British Telecom. This filibuster was instrumental in delaying the privatisation until after the 1983 general election, but with Margaret Thatcher&#x27;s Conservatives obtaining a massive parliamentary majority, the privatisation was soon forced through. Changes in British parliamentary procedure mean that Golding&#x27;s record is unlikely ever to be beaten.

Golding is also credited with having found a way to introduce the now typical unpredictability of Prime Minister Questions. In 1975, he decided to ask the broader possible question about what the Prime Minister had on the agenda for the day so that he could then use his right to follow up to ask the PM anything he wanted, dodging the strict vetting system on the questions in use until then.

<text>Jintara Poonlarp (, , ; b. 6 March 1969, Kaset Wisai district, Roi Et province, Thailand) is a Thai mor lam, luk thung and pop music singer.

She is one of the most popular and prolific of the artists in the mor lam (Thai country) and luk thung (Thai pop-country) genres, having released 50 original albums and 47 singles as well as many compilations. She records roughly equal amounts of mor lam and luk thung, but two of her best-known songs are the string (Thai pop) hits &quot;Ma Tammai&quot; and &quot;Faen Ja,&quot; recorded with Thongchai McIntyre.

She is also sometimes known by her nickname Jin or the epithet &quot;sao siang pin&quot; (Thai: สาวเสียงพิณ, meaning &quot;lute-voiced girl&quot;), and she has a unique identity which is short hair with bangs. She has performed on stage for 33 years.

==Early life and childhood==
Born in Thailand&#x27;s Isan region, Jintara&#x27;s birth name was Tongbai Janlueang but this changed to Tongbai Poonlarp when her parents registered their marriage. Jintara is her stage name. Although Friday March 12-year 1971 is commonly given as her birth date she celebrates her birthday on March 6, and this is the date of birth on her ID card. On her Facebook page the year she was born is given as 1969. Her mother could not remember the exact date she was born, not uncommon in rural Thailand in previous decades.

==Music career==
She began performing in her early teens. She made 20 audio-only recordings for GMM Grammy and later a further five for the Master Tape record label. She has since made a further series of recordings for Master Tape, variously entitled &quot;Luk tung sa on&quot; and &quot;Mor lam sa on&quot;, each on VCD, CD and audio tape formats (&quot;sa on&quot; in the Isan language meaning roughly &quot;enjoyable&quot;).

A number of greatest hits collections have also been issued, some of which contain videos of songs from the first audio-only series. Her first five albums included only luk thung, but since then most have combined luk thung, mor lam and sometimes string (Thai pop). Her most famous string songs are &quot;Mah Tummai&quot; [Thai: มาทำไม] and &quot;Faen Ja,&quot; both in collaboration with Thongchai McIntyre. She tours with a live show from September to May each year and has made several appearances in Europe and North America.

Among her best-known songs is &quot;Sǎo Isǎan plát tìn&quot; [Thai: สาวอีสานพลัดถิ่น] (&quot;Isan girl separated from her home,&quot; &quot;album 9&quot;), which incorporates the typical Thai country themes of poverty, homesickness and an unfaithful lover. &quot;Arlai World Trade&quot; (&quot;Mourning the World Trade Center,&quot; album &quot;Luk tung sa on 6&quot;) aroused comment in Thailand&#x27;s English-language press for the way it addressed the September 11, 2001 attacks: &quot;the reigning Morlam superstar of Thailand laments the attacks of September 11 while young, bare-midriffed Thai girls gyrate in front of a surging American flag&quot;.

In 2003, the Thai Ministry of Culture proposed banning one of her songs, &quot;Tears of a Lieutenant&#x27;s Wife&quot; (&quot;Namta mia nairoi&quot;) on state-run media.

By February 2006, she had released 38 original albums plus numerous compilations.

In 2007, she was singer of R-Siam and she was expired in 2017. She is singer of Cat 9 studio since 2018. She returned to popularlity by song title &quot;Tao Ngoi&quot;, and hit No. 1 on Thai music charts in 2018 - 2019, earning 123M YouTube views as of September 2019.

==Acting career==
In 2001, Jintara played her first television role in the series &quot;Nai Hoy Tamin&quot;, about the life of rural people in Isan in historical times. She co-starred in the 2006 action film, &quot;Chai Lai&quot; (&quot;Dangerous Flowers&quot;), portraying a member of a top-secret team of female crimefighters.

==Personal life==
In 2004, she began studying for a degree in Faculty of Humanities and Social Sciences at Suan Sunandha Rajabhat University, Bangkok, from which she was due to graduate in 2006. Newspaper reports suggested that she was considering standing as an MP for the Chart Thai (Thai Nation) party, but would not be able to do so until she had graduated; she did not stand in the 2005 election. She was awarded an honorary degree by Roi Et Rajabhat University in October 2004.

<doc id="757487" wikidata="Q1667505" url="?curid=757487" title="Right Opposition">
<text>The Right Opposition () or Right Tendency () in the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) was a label formulated by Joseph Stalin in autumn of 1928 for the opposition against certain measures included within the first five-year plan, an opposition which was led by Nikolai Bukharin, Alexei Rykov, Mikhail Tomsky, and their supporters within the Soviet Union that did not follow the so-called &quot;general line of the party&quot;. It is also the name given to &quot;right-wing&quot; critics within the Communist movement internationally, particularly those who coalesced in the International Communist Opposition, regardless of whether they identified with Bukharin and Rykov.

==Emergence==
The struggle for power in the Soviet Union after the death of Vladimir Lenin saw the development of three major tendencies within the Communist Party. These were described by Leon Trotsky as left, right, and centre tendencies, each based on a specific class or caste. Trotsky argued that his tendency, the Left Opposition, represented the internationalist traditions of the working class. The tendency led by Joseph Stalin was described as being in the centre, based on the state and party bureaucracy, tending to shift alliances between the left and the right. The right tendency was identified with the supporters of Nikolai Bukharin and Rykov. It was asserted that they represented the influence of the peasantry and the danger of capitalist restoration. Their policy was closely identified with the New Economic Policy (NEP), with former left communist Bukharin slowly moving to the right of the Bolshevik Party and becoming a strong supporter of the NEP starting in 1921. Right Opposition policies encouraging kulaks and NEPmen to &quot;get rich&quot; were seen by Right Opposition supporters as encouraging kulaks and NEPmen to &quot;grow into&quot; socialism.

Robert J. Alexander has questioned whether the various Right Oppositions could be described as a single international tendency, since they were usually concerned only with the issues relevant for their own countries and their own communist parties. Therefore, the Right Opposition was far more fragmented than the Left Opposition. Nevertheless, the various Right Opposition groups did come together to form an International Communist Opposition (ICO). Unlike the Left Opposition, they did not tend to form separate parties as they considered themselves loyal to the Communist International (Comintern).

==Fate of the Russian Right Opposition==
Stalin and his &quot;centre&quot; faction were allied with Bukharin and the Right Opposition from late 1924, with Bukharin elaborating Stalin&#x27;s theory of socialism in one country. Together, they expelled Trotsky, Kamenev, Zinoviev, and the United Opposition from the Communist Party in December 1927. However, once Trotsky was out of the way and the Left Opposition had been illegalized, Stalin soon became alarmed at the danger posed to the Soviet state by the rising power of the capitalistic kulaks and NEPmen, who had become emboldened by the Left Opposition&#x27;s illegalization. Sensing this danger, Stalin then turned on his Right Opposition allies. Bukharin and the Right Opposition were, in their turn, sidelined and removed from important positions within the Communist Party and the Soviet government from 1928 to 1930, with Stalin ending the NEP and beginning the first five-year plan.

One of the last attempts of the Rightists to resist Stalin was the Ryutin affair in 1932, where a manifesto against the soviet policy of collectivization and Stalin was circulated. It openly called for &quot;The Liquidation of the dictatorship of Stalin and his clique&quot;. Later, some rightists joined a secret bloc with Leon Trotsky, Grigory Zinoviev, and Lev Kamenev in order to oppose Stalin. Historian Pierre Broué stated that it dissolved in early 1933.

Bukharin was isolated from his allies abroad, and, in the face of increasing Stalinist repression, was unable to mount a sustained struggle against Stalin. Unlike Trotsky, who built an anti-Stalinist movement, Bukharin and his allies capitulated to Stalin and admitted their &quot;ideological errors&quot;. They were temporarily rehabilitated, though they were allowed only minor posts and did not return to their former prominence. Bukharin and his allies were later executed during the Great Purge trials.

==Foundation of the International Communist Opposition==
The various right oppositional groups loosely aligned with Bukharin within the Comintern were forced to form their own organisations when they were, in their turn, purged from the national sections of the Comintern. In Europe, the most important and substantial of these new organisations was the Communist Party Opposition (KPO) in Germany, led by Heinrich Brandler. In the United States, Jay Lovestone, Bertram Wolfe, and their supporters founded the Communist Party (Opposition) and published the newspaper &quot;Workers Age&quot;. In Canada, the Marxian Educational League was formed as part of Lovestone&#x27;s CP(O), and it became affiliated with the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation. However, by the end of 1939, both the Toronto and Montreal groups of this organization had ceased to function.

In a few places, communist groups affiliated with the ICO achieved more success than the Comintern-affiliated organizations. For example, in Sweden, the Socialist Party of Karl Kilbom and Nils Flyg, affiliated with the ICO, received 5.7% of the vote in the 1932 elections to the Riksdag, outpolling the Comintern section that received 3.9%.

In Catalonia, Spain, the ICO-affiliated &quot;Bloc Obrer i Camperol&quot; (BOC), led by Joaquín Maurín, was for a time larger and more important than the official Spanish Communist Party. Later, the BOC merged with Andrés Nin&#x27;s &quot;Izquierda Comunista&quot; in 1935 to form the Workers&#x27; Party of Marxist Unification (POUM) which was to be a major party backing the Second Spanish Republic in the Spanish Civil War. Maurín became general secretary of the POUM but was arrested early in the civil war. As a result, Nin, a former Trotskyist, became the POUM&#x27;s new leader.

In all, the ICO had member parties in fifteen countries during the 1930s. However, the ICO and its affiliates did not consider themselves a new international, but a &quot;faction&quot; that was involuntarily excluded from the Comintern and that was anxious to return to it if only the Comintern would change its policies and allow ICO members the freedom to advocate their positions.

Despite being identified with Bukharin, the ICO generally supported Stalin&#x27;s economic policies (which Bukharin opposed), such as the five-year plans to achieve rapid industrialization, and the collectivization of agriculture. Furthermore, they even supported the early Moscow trials. Their main difference with Stalin and the Comintern was over the issue of democracy within the Communist International and the influence of the CPSU in the Comintern and its sections, and over Stalin&#x27;s international policy, particularly the Third Period and the subsequent popular front policies.

In addition, as the Moscow trials entered their second phase and turned against Bukharin and his supporters, disputes broke out within the ICO regarding whether there was any point in continuing with the concept of being an opposition within the communist movement rather than openly create a new international rival to the Comintern, as Trotsky did with his Fourth International.

==End of the Right Opposition==
The ICO began to disintegrate in 1933. With the coming to power of the Nazis, the German party had to go underground and establish an exile branch in Paris. Paris was also the new home of the international ICO headquarters, which became dominated by the Germans. The Norwegian and Swedish groups left later that year to join the new &quot;centrist&quot; International Buro for Revolutionary Socialist Unity (or London Bureau) established in Paris that August. The Czechoslovak affiliate was weakened by the defection of its Czech members in December, making the party a largely Sudeten German group at a time when that community was becoming increasingly attracted to the Nazis. The Austrian group had to go underground after the Dollfus putsch of March 1934, and the majority of the Alsatian section was expelled that summer for its pro-Nazi sympathies. The Swiss affiliate went over to the Social Democrats in 1936, and M. N. Roy took his Indian group out in 1937. Furthermore, the suppression of POUM in May 1937 and the execution of Bukharin and other &quot;rights&quot; in the Soviet Union had convinced many that the Communist International could not be reformed and the idea of being an &quot;opposition&quot; within it was untenable.

At a conference in February 1938, the International Communist Opposition affiliated with the London Bureau. This led to some confusion as to whether affiliates of the ICO were also affiliates of the London Bureau as organizations themselves. To straighten out this overlapping another conference was held in Paris in April 1939 which dissolved both entities into a new organization, the International Revolutionary Marxist Centre, to be headquartered in Paris. Membership in the new group was quickly ratified by the ILLA, the KPO, POUM, PSOP, the ILP, and the Archeio-Marxists. It ceased to exist after the fall of France.

A few groups continue the tradition of this current today. The Gruppe Arbeiterpolitik in Germany is one such group.

==Meetings==
* The first gathering of the opposition communists was held in Berlin March 17–19, 1930. It was attended by the oppositions of Germany, Czechoslovakia, Sweden, and by M. N. Roy. The meeting decided to set up an information center in Berlin to co-ordinate international activities and publish a bulletin, &quot;International Information of the Communist Opposition&quot;, which had previously been published by the KPO.
* The first official conference of the ICO was held in Berlin in December 1930. It was attended by representatives from Germany, Alsace, Sweden, the United States, Switzerland, and Norway, with letters from sympathizers in Austria, Finland, Italy and Canada. Adopts the &quot;Platform of the International Communist Opposition&quot;
* The second official congress was held in Berlin, July 2–5, 1932, attended by representatives from Germany, Switzerland, Norway, Sweden, Spain, and the US.
* An &quot;enlarged session of the Bureau&quot; was held in July 1933 to discuss the Nazi triumph in Germany and the Paris conference of &quot;centrist&quot; groups. Attended by representatives from Germany, France, Switzerland, the Netherlands and the US. The Norwegians and Swedes did not attend, as they favored participation in the Paris conference. The ICO itself declined invitation to the conference. ICO headquarters moved to Paris.

==Groups associated with the ICO==

===Germany===
The Gruppe Arbeiterpolitik, founded by Heinrich Brandler, is effectively a successor organisation.

===Austria===
The Communist Opposition of Austria was established in late 1929 when the politburo of the official Communist Party of Austria expelled Willi Schlamm, A. Reisinger, Joseph Klein]], and Richard Vovesny. They had their own periodical, &quot;Der Neue Mahnruf&quot; until the Dolfuss dictatorship came to power in 1934. Jay Lovestone happened to be in Austria at the time of the anchluss in early March 1938 at the invitation of a group called Der Funke and was able to arrange eight fake passports for eight leaders of the Austrian opposition. They left Vienna on March 14, the day before Hitler arrived in the city. Schlamm later edited a paper for Austrian exiles in Prague, &quot;Weltbühne&quot;, then emigrated to the US.

===Czechoslovakia===
===Hungary===
An Opposition group was established in Hungary in 1932. At that time the Hungarian Communist Party was already an underground movement, and the opposition claimed about 10% of its membership.

===Poland===
While never a formal organization, there was a tendency within the Polish Communist Party usually known as the &quot;three Ws&quot; after the leaders: Adolf Warski, Henryk Walecki, and Maria Koszutska (pseudonym Wera Kostrzewa). As the Party was already underground in Poland, and the communists already weak the group decided not to create a formal organization, though they were often depicted as followers of Brandler and Thalheimer by the leadership. All three died in gulags.

===Switzerland===
In Switzerland, the official Communist Party&#x27;s leader, Jules Humbert-Droz, was sympathetic to the Right Opposition, and because of that lost his powerful position in the Comintern. Later, he self-criticized and capitulated to the Communist leadership, only to be expelled in 1943. One cantonal section of the Swiss Communist Party, in Schaffhausen, did secede and form a communist opposition group. For a while, it was quite successful, dominating the local labor movement, especially among tool and watchmakers. In the 20 October 1933 elections, the CPO elected 10 of the 30 local councilors and CPO leader Walther Bringolf was chosen as mayor. By 1936, the CPO had merged with the Swiss Socialist Party.

===Italy===
There was some resistance in the Italian party to the new Third Period line. At first the two Italian ECCI members, Palmiro Togliatti and Angelo Tasca, opposed the Comintern&#x27;s actions with regard to the German party. However, at the Tenth Plenum in June 1929, Togliatti capitulated to Stalin&#x27;s wishes while Tasca was expelled. Later, at a May 1930 plenum of the Party, Politburo members Pasquini and Santini were removed for opposing the Third Period and &quot;organizational measures&quot; were taken against lower cadres.

===Spain===
===Sweden===
===Finland===
===Norway===
===Denmark===
A Danish Opposition group was founded in 1933. It lasted at least until February 1938 when its representative attended the ICO unity conference with the London Bureau.

===France===
In France the initial purge of the Communist Party in 1929 took mayors or city councilors from Clichy, Auffay, Saint-Denis, Pierrefitte-sur-Seine, Villetaneuse and Paris. The party&#x27;s general secretary and the editor of &quot;L&#x27;Humanité&quot; were also demoted. However, not all of the expelled necessarily adhered to the ICOs positions; the Parisian councilors, for instance, formed their own party, Workers and Peasants Party, which in turn joined the Party of Proletarian Unity in December 1930. The small national Opposition group joined the expelled Seine Federation of the SFIO in 1938 to form the Workers and Peasants&#x27; Socialist Party.

====Alsace====
A separate ICO party, the Opposition Communist Party of Alsace-Lorraine (KPO), was created in Alsace. The Alsatian KPO campaigned for autonomy for Alsace, and formed an alliance with clerical autonomist. The Alsatian KPO was led by Charles Hueber (mayor of Strasbourg, 1929–1935) and Jean-Pierre Mourer (member of the French National Assembly). It ran a daily newspaper of its own, &quot;Die Neue Welt&quot;. The Alsatian KPO gradually moved towards pro-Nazi positions, and was expelled from ICO in 1934. A small group remained loyal to the ICO and published a weekly, &quot;Arbeiter Politik&quot;, but had little influence.

===United Kingdom===
During most of its history the right Opposition in the United Kingdom was represented principally within the Independent Labour Party. Oppositionists joined the Revolutionary Policy Committee, part of which represented their line within the ILP. An independent Opposition group was formed in 1935, but had little influence. By 1938 the line of the ICO had turned towards the &quot;centrist&quot; position of the ILP leadership under Fenner Brockway and the work of independent factions within the party became less tenable.

===United States and Canada===
===India===
The leading Indian communist M. N. Roy was an early and outspoken supporter of the Right Opposition. While he never had more than a marginal following, he wielded extraordinary influence on the left wing of the Indian National Congress and played an instrumental role in the election of Subhas Chandra Bose to the leadership of Congress. However, after Bose split with Congress and formed the All India Forward Bloc, Roy sharply diverged to the point where he even came to oppose the Congress-led Quit India campaign. The split between Bose and Roy was in many ways analogous to the American split between Bertram Wolfe and Jay Lovestone.

===Argentina===
While never an official member of the ICO, a Right Oppositionist group led by José Penelon split from the Communist Party of Argentina in 1928. Penelon&#x27;s group formed the &quot;Partido Comunista de Region Argentina&quot; (&quot;Communist Party of the Argentine Region&quot;), which was later renamed the &quot;Partido Concentracion Obrera&quot; (&quot;Labour Gathering Party&quot;). It merged with the Social Democrats in 1971.

===Mexico===
The Marxist Workers Bloc of Mexico was founded in early 1937. It published a few issues of a newspaper called &quot;La Batalla&quot; (after POUM&#x27;s journal) and announced its adherence to the ICO. It was never heard from again.

<text>USS &quot;Aaron Ward&quot; (DD-483) was a in the service of the United States Navy. She was the second Navy ship named in honor of Rear Admiral Aaron Ward. She sank on 7 April 1943 in a shoal near Tinete Point of Nggela Sule, Solomon Islands during Operation I-Go. Her wreck was discovered on 4 September 1994.

== Construction ==
&quot;Aaron Ward&quot; was laid down on 11 February 1941 at Kearny, New Jersey by the Federal Shipbuilding and Drydock Company and launched on 22 November 1941, sponsored by Miss Hilda Ward, the daughter of the late Admiral Ward. The ship was commissioned on 4 March 1942.

== Service history ==
Following her shakedown cruise out of Casco Bay, Maine and post-shakedown availability at the New York Navy Yard, &quot;Aaron Ward&quot; sailed for the Pacific on 20 May 1942 and proceeded via the Panama Canal to San Diego. A short time later, as the Battle of Midway was developing off to the westward, the destroyer operated in the screen of Vice Admiral William S. Pye&#x27;s Task Force 1 (TF 1), built around four battleships and an escort carrier, , as it steamed out into the Pacific Ocean – eventually reaching a point some 1,200 miles (2,200 km) west of San Francisco, California and equally northeast of Hawaii – to &quot;support the current operations against the enemy.&quot; With the detachment of &quot;Long Island&quot; from the task force on 17 June, &quot;Aaron Ward&quot; screened her on her voyage back to San Diego.

=== World War II ===
After local operations off the west coast, &quot;Aaron Ward&quot; sailed for Hawaii on 30 June 1942 and then to the Tonga Islands with TF 18. Assigned to escort duties soon afterwards, she convoyed the oiler to Nouméa. During the course of the voyage she made two sound contacts, one on 5 August and the other the following day, which she developed and attacked with depth charges. Although she claimed a probable sinking in each case, neither kill was borne out in postwar accounting. Subsequently assigned to screening duties with forces seeking to cover and resupply Guadalcanal, &quot;Aaron Ward&quot; saw the fleet carrier torpedoed by on 15 September 1942.

Within a month&#x27;s time, &quot;Aaron Ward&quot; was earmarked for a shore bombardment mission on 17 October. She stood into Lunga Roads to lie to and await the arrival of a Marine liaison officer who would designate targets for the ship. Before she could embark passengers, though, she spotted five enemy bombers approaching from the west. These attacked &quot;Aaron Ward&quot; but ran into a heavy antiaircraft barrage from both the ship and marine guns on shore. The destroyer went ahead at flank speed when she spotted the attackers, to carry out evasive maneuvers and avoid the falling bombs, radically swinging to the right or left as the occasion demanded. Three bombs splashed astern of the ship. The Marines claimed two of the five attackers destroyed, while the ship and the Marines shared a third kill.

The action over, the destroyer embarked Martin Clemens, the former British consular representative on Guadalcanal, Major C. M. Nees, USMC, and Corporal R. M. Howard, USMC, a photographer, and got underway soon afterwards, reaching her target area within 40 minutes. For three hours, &quot;Aaron Ward&quot; shelled Japanese shore positions, her targets ranging from a gun emplacement to ammunition dumps; fires, smoke, and explosions marked her visit as she quit the area. Reaching Lunga Roads, she disembarked her passengers and after going on alert for a Japanese air raid that failed to materialize, cleared Lengo Channel and rejoined her task force.

Three days later, while again performing screening operations, &quot;Aaron Ward&quot; saw the cruiser take a torpedo hit on 20 October from . The destroyer went to the aid of the stricken cruiser and dropped a full depth charge pattern on &quot;Chester&quot;″s assailant, but did not record a kill. She then escorted the damaged cruiser to Espiritu Santo.

Ten days after this, &quot;Aaron Ward&quot; carried out another bombardment of Japanese positions on Guadalcanal, this time in company with the light cruiser , flagship of Rear Admiral Norman Scott, and destroyers , , and . Arriving off Lunga Point at 0520 on 30 October, the task group stood in, and &quot;Atlanta&quot; embarked a liaison officer from Major General Alexander A. Vandegrift, Commander of the 1st Marine Division, 20 minutes later.

Steaming to its designated area, the task group reached its destination within an hour&#x27;s time, and &quot;Atlanta&quot; opened fire. &quot;Aaron Ward&quot; followed suit soon afterwards; eventually, she expended 711 rounds of 5-inch ammunition. Pausing briefly to investigate a reported submarine in the vicinity, &quot;Aaron Ward&quot; then cleared the area.

==== Naval Battle of Guadalcanal, 13 November 1942 ====
&quot;Aaron Ward&quot; screened transports unloading men and material off Guadalcanal on 11 and 12 November, shooting down one enemy plane and damaging two others on the former day and two more planes off Lunga Point on the latter. The Allies learned that the Japanese were sending a large force to disrupt air operations based at Henderson Field and land reinforcements for the Japanese forces on the island. The resulting Naval Battle of Guadalcanal proved to be the climactic engagement of the Guadalcanal campaign.

On the evening of 12 November, &quot;Aaron Ward&quot; retired with her task force – five cruisers and eight destroyers under Rear Admiral Daniel J. Callaghan – in an eastward direction, escorting the transports out of what would become known after the battle as &quot;Ironbottom Sound&quot;. Later, the force reversed course and stood back through Lengo Channel. At about 0125 on 13 November, the American ships which possessed radar picked up numerous contacts on their screens – the &quot;Volunteer Attack Force&quot; under Rear Admiral Hiroaki Abe, which consisted of battleships and , the light cruiser , and 14 destroyers.

&quot;Aaron Ward&quot;, leading the four destroyers bringing up the rear of Callaghan&#x27;s column, ranged in on the Japanese ships, opening fire soon afterwards on a target she took to be a battleship. A short time later, after the ship had fired approximately ten salvos, she saw that the cruisers ahead of her had apparently changed course; &quot;Aaron Ward&quot; observed two torpedoes pass beneath her.

An instant later, blew up, torpedoed by . &quot;Aaron Ward&quot;, with the waters clear ahead of her, surged ahead once more. She prepared to fire torpedoes at a target to port, but did not because she sighted a ship which she took to be away. Observing what she took to be heading directly toward her port side, &quot;Aaron Ward&quot; put her rudder over hard to port to avoid a collision.

A short time later, the destroyer commenced firing on an enemy ship, and hurled some 25 salvos in her direction; her target may have been , which did blow up and sink, with very heavy loss of life. Changing course to bear on a new target in the melee, &quot;Aaron Ward&quot; managed to get off four salvos on director control until a Japanese shell put the director out of action and forced the destroyer&#x27;s gunners to rely on local control.

In the minutes that followed, &quot;Aaron Ward&quot; received eight more direct hits; unable to identify friend from foe and certain that the enemy had surely established her American character, the destroyer then stood out to clear the area. She lost steering control at 0225, and, steering with her engines, attempted to come to the right. Seeing no more firing after 0230, when the battle apparently ended, &quot;Aaron Ward&quot; went dead in the water at 0235, her forward engine room flooded with salt water and her feed water gone.

Using a gasoline pump, the destroyer&#x27;s crew managed to pump salt water into the tanks and light the boilers off. At 0500, &quot;Aaron Ward&quot; moved slowly ahead, bound for Sealark Channel; ten minutes later, American motor torpedo boats closed, and the destroyer signaled them to ask Tulagi for a tug. She kept up her crawling pace for only a half-hour before going dead in the water again.

Thirty minutes after she had slowed to a stop, &quot;Aaron Ward&quot; spotted the Japanese battleship &quot;Hiei&quot; steaming slowly in circles between Savo and Florida Islands. Also nearby, nearer to Guadalcanal, lay &quot;Atlanta&quot;, , and , all damaged, and the destroyers both burning. The destroyer ″s presence in the vicinity proved to be her own undoing: &quot;Portland&quot; summarily sank her.

&quot;Aaron Ward&quot;, perhaps prompted to do so with more urgency due to &quot;Hiei&quot;″s proximity, got underway at 0618, and two minutes later greeted tug , which had arrived to take the destroyer in tow. Before the towline could be rigged, &quot;Hiei&quot; spotted &quot;Aaron Ward&quot; and opened fire with her heavy guns. Four two-gun salvos were laid, the third of which straddled the crippled destroyer. However, planes sent from Henderson Field began attacking &quot;Hiei&quot;, distracting her from further fire.

Losing power again at 0635, &quot;Aaron Ward&quot; was taken in tow by &quot;Bobolink&quot;, and the ships began moving toward safety. The tug turned the tow over to a local patrol boat at 0650, and the destroyer anchored in Tulagi harbor near Makambo Island at 0830. The nine direct hits she had received resulted in 15 men dead and 57 wounded. After receiving temporary repairs locally, &quot;Aaron Ward&quot; sailed for Hawaii soon afterwards, reaching Pearl Harbor on 20 December 1942 for permanent repairs.

The destroyer rejoined the fleet on 6 February 1943 and soon resumed escort work. During one stint with a small convoy on 20 March, she aided in driving off attacking Japanese planes. On 7 April, she had escorted and three tank landing craft from the Russell Islands to Savo. Not expecting to arrive until 1400, the destroyer went ahead at to provide USS &quot;Ward&quot; and the three LCTs with air cover until they reached Tulagi. At about noon, the destroyer received notification of an impending air raid at Guadalcanal.

==== Sinking ====
As the ships neared their destination, &quot;Aaron Ward&quot; received orders at about 1330 to leave her convoy to cover the tank landing ship &quot;LST-449&quot; off Togoma Point, Guadalcanal. (One of the passengers on &quot;LST-449&quot; was then Lieutenant (junior grade) John F. Kennedy, later to become President of the United States, on his way to take command of &quot;PT-109&quot;.) Joining &quot;LST-449&quot; at 1419, the destroyer directed her to follow her movements and zigzag at the approach of enemy aircraft. While the LST maneuvered to conform to &quot;Aaron Ward&quot;″s movements, Lieutenant Commander Frederick J. Becton, commanding officer of &quot;Aaron Ward&quot;, planned to retire to the eastward through Lengo Channel, as other cargo ships and escorting ships were doing upon receipt of the air raid warning from Guadalcanal.

Sighting a dogfight over Savo Island, &quot;Aaron Ward&quot; tracked a closer group of Japanese planes heading south over Tulagi; while swinging to starboard, the ship suddenly sighted three enemy planes coming out of the sun. Surging ahead to flank speed and putting her rudder over hard to port, &quot;Aaron Ward&quot; opened fire with her 20 mm and 40 mm guns, followed shortly afterwards by her 5-inch battery. Bombs from the first three planes struck on or near the ship, and the mining effect of the near-misses proved devastating; the first bomb was a near miss, which tore holes in the side of the ship, allowing the forward fire room to take water rapidly; the second struck home in the engine room, causing a loss of all electrical power on the 5 inch and 40 mm mounts. Shifting to local control, however, the gunners kept up the fire. A third bomb splashed close aboard, holing her port side, near the after engine room. Having lost power to her rudder, the ship continued to swing to port as another trio of dive bombers loosed their loads on the now-helpless destroyer. While none of these bombs hit the ship, two landed very near her port side. Twenty men died, 59 were wounded, and seven went missing.

Despite the best efforts of her determined crew, and the assistance of and , the destroyer settled lower in the water. When it became evident that the battle to save &quot;Aaron Ward&quot; was being lost, &quot;Ortolan&quot; and &quot;Vireo&quot; attempted to beach her on a shoal near Tinete Point of Nggela Sule. At 21:35, however, &quot;Aaron Ward&quot; sank, stern-first, in 40 fathoms (70 m) of water, only from shoal water.

== Discovery ==

On 4 September 1994, divers located the wreck of &quot;Aaron Ward&quot;. The first dive to the wreck was made on 25 September 1994. Because of the depth, divers were limited to about 15 minutes at the wreck before beginning their return to the surface.

== Awards ==
&quot;Aaron Ward&quot; was awarded four battle stars for her World War II service.

<doc id="757501" wikidata="Q539715" url="?curid=757501" title="Nio (Buddhism)">
<text>are two wrathful and muscular guardians of the Buddha standing today at the entrance of many Buddhist temples in East Asian Buddhism in the form of frightening wrestler-like statues. They are dharmapala manifestations of the bodhisattva Vajrapāṇi, the oldest and most powerful of the Mahayana Buddhist pantheon. According to scriptures like the Pāli Canon as well as the &quot;Ambaṭṭha Sutta&quot;, they travelled with Gautama Buddha to protect him. Within the generally pacifist tradition of Buddhism, stories of dharmapalas justified the use of physical force to protect cherished values and beliefs against evil. They are also seen as a manifestation of Mahasthamaprapta, the bodhisattva of power that flanks Amitābha in Pure Land Buddhism and as Vajrasattva in Tibetan Buddhism.

==Manifestations==
=== Symbolic meaning ===

They are usually portrayed as a pair of figures that stand guarding temple entrance gates usually called &quot;Shānmén&quot; (山門) in China, in Japan and &quot;Geumgangmun&quot; () in Korea. The right statue is traditionally called Guhyapāda and has his mouth open, representing the vocalization of the first grapheme of Sanskrit Devanāgarī (अ) which is pronounced &quot;a&quot;. The left statue is traditionally called Nārāyaṇa and has his mouth closed, representing the vocalization of the last grapheme of Devanāgarī (ह ) which is pronounced &quot;&quot; (हूँ). These two characters together (a-hūṃ/a-un) symbolize the birth and death of all things. (Men are supposedly born speaking the &quot;a&quot; sound with mouths open and die speaking an &quot;&quot; and mouths closed.) Similar to Jaya-Vijaya, they signify &quot;everything&quot; or &quot;all creation&quot;. The contraction of both is Aum (ॐ).

=== Guhyapāda ===

Guhyapāda (Traditional Chinese: 密迹金剛; simplified Chinese: 密迹金刚; pinyin: &quot;Mìjī jīngāng&quot;; Japanese: &quot;Misshaku Kongō&quot;; &quot;Korean: Miljeok geumgang&quot;; Vietnamese: &quot;Mật tích kim cương&quot; ) is a symbol of overt violence: he wields a &quot;vajra&quot; mallet &quot;&quot; (a diamond club, thunderbolt stick, or sun symbol) and bares his teeth. His mouth is depicted as being in the shape necessary to form the &quot;ha&quot; or &quot;ah&quot; sound. In China, he is also known as General Ha (哈将 Hā Jiāng) in reference to this iconographic detail. Similarly, he is also known as Agyō (阿形, &quot;a&quot;-form, general term open-mouthed statues in aum pair) in Japan due to this detail as well. In Chinese Buddhism, Guhyapāda is regarded as one of the Twenty-Four Protective Deities, who are a grouping of dharmapalas often enshrined in the Mahavira Hall of temples and monasteries. In addition, Guhyapada is also sometimes paired or identified with the Wisdom King Ucchuṣma, who is commonly known in Chinese as &quot;Huìjì Jīngāng&quot; (穢跡金剛).
=== Nārāyaṇa ===
Nārāyaṇa (Traditional Chinese: 那羅延金剛; simplified Chinese: 那罗延金刚; pinyin: &quot;Nàluōyán Jīngāng&quot;; Japanese: &quot;Naraen Kongō;&quot; Korean: &quot;Narayeon geumgang&quot;; Vietnamese: &quot;Na la diên kim cương&quot;) is depicted either bare-handed or wielding a sword. He symbolizes latent strength, holding his mouth tightly shut. His mouth is rendered to form the sound &quot;&quot;, or &quot;heng&quot; or &quot;un&quot;. In China, he is also known as General Heng (哼将 Hēng Jiāng) in reference to this iconographic detail. Similarly, he is also known as Ungyō (吽形, &quot;um&quot;-form, general term closed-mouthed statues in aum pair) in Japan due to this detail as well.

=== Vajrapāni ===
Both &quot;Guhyapāda&quot; and &quot;Nārāyaṇa&quot; are seen as manifestations of Vajrapāni (Traditional Chinese: 執金剛神; simplified Chinese: 执金刚神; pinyin: &quot;Zhíjīngāng shén&quot;; Japanese: &quot;Shūkongōshin;&quot; Korean: &quot;Jip geumgang sin&quot;; Vietnamese: &quot;Chấp kim cang thần&quot;), with the name literally meaning &quot;&quot;vajra&quot;-wielding god&quot;.

==Nio Zen Buddhism==
Nio Zen Buddhism was a practice advocated by the Zen monk Suzuki Shōsan (1579–1655), who advocated Nio Zen Buddhism over Nyorai Zen Buddhism. He recommended that practitioners should meditate on Nio and even adopt their fierce expressions and martial stances in order to cultivate power, strength and courage when dealing with adversity. Suzuki described Nio as follows: &quot;The Niō (Vajrapani) is a menacing God. He wields the kongōsho (vajra) and he can crush your enemies. Depend on him, pray to him that he will protect you as he protects the Buddha. He vibrates with energy and spiritual power which you can absorb from him in times of need.&quot;

==Influence on Taoism==
In Chinese folk religion and Taoism, they are known as &quot;Heng Ha Er Jiang&quot; (). Within the Taoist novel &quot;Fengshen Yanyi&quot;, Zheng Lun and Chen Qi were finally appointed as the two deities.

<text>The third ship named USS &quot;Aaron Ward&quot; (DD-773/DM-34) in honor of Rear Admiral Aaron Ward was a destroyer minelayer in the service of the United States Navy.

She was laid down as an (DD-773) on 12 December 1943 at San Pedro, California by the Bethlehem Shipbuilding and launched on 5 May 1944, sponsored by Mrs. G. H. Ratliff. The ship was redesignated a destroyer minelayer, DM-34, on 19 July 1944, and commissioned on 28 October 1944.

==Service history==
Between commissioning and the end of January 1945, &quot;Aaron Ward&quot; completed fitting out and conducted her shakedown cruise off the California coast. On 9 February, she departed San Pedro, bound for Pearl Harbor, arriving on 15 February. The warship conducted additional training in Hawaiian waters, before loading supplies and ammunition and getting underway on 5 March to join the 5th Fleet at Ulithi. She entered the lagoon of that atoll in the Western Carolines on 16 March, but put to sea again on 19 March with Task Force 52, bound for the Ryūkyū Islands.

The Mine Flotilla, of which &quot;Aaron Ward&quot; was a unit, arrived off Okinawa late on 22 March. The first enemy air raid occurred on 26 March, and knocked the intruder out of the sky.

&quot;Aaron Ward&quot; supported minesweeping operations around Kerama Retto and Okinawa until the first landings. During that period, she accounted for three enemy aircraft. On 1 April, the day of the initial assault on Okinawa, the destroyer minelayer began screening the heavy warships providing gunfire support for the troops ashore. That duty lasted until 4 April, when she headed for the Marianas. She arrived at Saipan on 10 April, but sailed to Guam later that day. After several days of minor repairs, &quot;Aaron Ward&quot; headed back to Okinawa to patrol in the area around Kerama Retto. During that patrol period, she came under frequent air attack. On 27 April, she shot down one enemy plane, and the next day accounted for one more and also claimed a probable kill. Then she returned to Kerama Retto to replenish her provisions and fuel. While she was there, a &quot;kamikaze&quot; scored a hit on . &quot;Aaron Ward&quot; moved alongside the stricken evacuation transport to help fight the inferno blazing amidships. She also rescued 12 survivors from &quot;Pinkney&quot;.

On 30 April, she returned to sea to take up position on radar picket station number 10. That night, she helped repulse several air attacks; but, for the most part, weather kept enemy airpower away until the afternoon of 3 May. When the weather began to clear, the probability of air attacks rose. At about dusk, &quot;Aaron Ward&quot;″s radar picked up bogies at distance. Two of the planes in the formation broke away and began runs on &quot;Aaron Ward&quot;. The warship opened fire on the first from about and began scoring hits when he had closed range to . At that point, he dipped over into his suicide dive, but crashed about off the ship&#x27;s starboard quarter. The second began his approach immediately thereafter. &quot;Aaron Ward&quot; opened fire at about and destroyed him while he was still away.
At that point, a third and more determined intruder appeared and dove in on &quot;Aaron Ward&quot;″s stern. Though repeatedly struck by antiaircraft fire, the plane pressed home the attack. Just before crashing into &quot;Aaron Ward&quot;″s superstructure, he released a bomb which smashed through her hull below the waterline and exploded in the after engine room. The explosion flooded the after engine and fire rooms, ruptured fuel tanks, set the leaking oil ablaze, and severed steering control connections to the bridge. The rudder jammed at hard left, and &quot;Aaron Ward&quot; turned in a tight circle while slowing to about . Topside, the plane itself spread fire and destruction through the area around the after deckhouse and deprived mount 53 of all power and communication. Many sailors were killed or injured by the crash.

For about 20 minutes, no enemy plane succeeded in penetrating her air defenses. Damage control parties worked feverishly to put out fires, repair what damage they could, jettison ammunition in danger of exploding, and attend to the wounded. Though steering control was moved aft to the rudder itself, the ship was unable to maneuver properly throughout the remainder of the engagement. Then, at about 18:40, the ships on her station came under a particularly ferocious air attack. While was hit by the five successive crashes that sank her, was sunk by a single kamikaze hit; and lost her mast to a kamikaze. Just before 19:00, one plane from the group of attackers targeted &quot;Aaron Ward&quot; and began his approach from about . However, the ship shot down the attacker when he was still away. Another enemy then attempted to crash into her, but they, too, succumbed to her antiaircraft fire.

Soon after, two more Japanese planes came in on her port bow. Though chased by American fighters, one of them succeeded in breaking away and starting a run on &quot;Aaron Ward&quot;. The aircraft came in at a steep dive apparently aiming at the bridge. Heavy defensive fire, however, forced the plane to veer toward the after portion of the ship. Passing over the signal bridge, the plane carried away halyards and antennae assemblies, smashed into the stack, and then crashed close aboard to starboard.

Quickly on the heels of that attack, still another intruder swooped in toward &quot;Aaron Ward&quot;. Coming in just forward of her port beam, the plane was met with a hail of anti-aircraft fire, but continued on and released a bomb just before crashing into her main deck. The bomb exploded a few feet close aboard her port side; its fragments showered the ship and blew a large hole through the shell plating near her forward fireroom. As a result, the ship lost all power and gradually lost headway. At that point, a previously unobserved enemy crashed into the ship&#x27;s deckhouse bulkhead, causing numerous fires and injuring and killing many more crewmen.

&quot;Aaron Ward&quot; endured two more crashes. At about 19:21, a plane glided in steeply on her port quarter. The loss of power prevented any of her 5-inch mounts from bearing on him, and he crashed into her port side superstructure. Burning gasoline engulfed the deck, 40-millimeter ammunition began exploding, and still more heavy casualties resulted. The warship went dead in the water, her after superstructure deck demolished, and she was still on fire. While damage control crews fought the fires and flooding, &quot;Aaron Ward&quot; began to settle in the water and took on a decided list to port.

Just after 19:20, a final attacker made a high-speed, low-level approach and crashed into the base of her number 2 stack. The explosion blew the plane, the stack, searchlight, and two gun mounts into the air, and they all came to rest strewn across the deck aft of stack number 1. Through the night, her crew fought to save the ship. At 2106, arrived and took &quot;Aaron Ward&quot; in tow. Early on the morning of 4 May, she arrived at Kerama Retto, where she began temporary repairs. She remained there until 11 June, when she got underway for the United States. Steaming via Ulithi, Guam, Eniwetok, Pearl Harbor, and the Panama Canal, &quot;Aaron Ward&quot; arrived in New York in mid-August. 

On 28 September 1945, because her damage was so severe and the Navy had a surplus of destroyers at the time, she was decommissioned, and her name was struck from the Navy list. In July 1946, she was sold for scrapping. Her anchor is on display in Elgin, Illinois.

==Awards==
&quot;Aaron Ward&quot; earned one battle star and the Presidential Unit Citation for her World War II service.

<text>Sheila Gordon (January 22, 1927, in Johannesburg, South Africa – 2013) was an American writer who was born in South Africa. She wrote, among various other publications, &quot;Waiting for the Rain&quot;, &quot;The Middle of Somewhere&quot;, and &quot;Unfinished Business&quot;.

&quot;Waiting for the Rain&quot; tells the story of two boys growing up on a farm in South Africa during the Apartheid era. The friendship between the two boys dissipates as they grow older because one of them, who is black, seeks political equality, while the other boy, who is white, wants everything to stay the same.

Sheila lived in Cobble Hill, a small neighborhood in Brooklyn for over fifty years. She died on May 10, 2013, at the age of 86. Her husband of over 60 years, Harley Gordon, died three months later on August 8, 2013. They were survived by their three children and five grandchildren.
