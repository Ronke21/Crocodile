<text>Karl Wendlinger (; born 20 December 1968) is an Austrian professional racing and former Formula One driver.

==Mercedes Juniors==
Born in Kufstein, Wendlinger started his career in karting and in Formula Ford before entering the German Formula 3 Championship in 1988. After managing tenth place in that inaugural season, Wendlinger won the crown in 1989, which earned him also a drive in the Mercedes-Benz sportscar team for 1990.

Driving the Sauber-Mercedes C11 – alongside Michael Schumacher, Heinz-Harald Frentzen, Mauro Baldi and Jean-Louis Schlesser – the quintet managed to achieve fifth place in the 1990 World Sportscar Championship standings.

In 1991, he continued to race with Mercedes sportscars — alongside a Formula 3000 programme with the Helmut Marko team. Towards the end of the year, Mercedes&#x27;s team boss Jochen Neerpasch placed two of his protégés in Formula One. Schumacher went to the Jordan team before signing for Benetton, whilst Wendlinger made a low key Formula One debut with the Leyton House outfit for the final two Grands Prix of the season.

==Formula One==

===1991–1992: Leyton House/March===
Wendlinger&#x27;s Formula One debut came at the 1991 Japanese Grand Prix at Suzuka, bringing some money to the beleaguered Leyton House team in place of long-serving Ivan Capelli. He qualified in 22nd place in a field of 26, but was unable to convert that into anything more, after he retired due to a big collision at turn one, between himself, JJ Lehto, Andrea de Cesaris and Emanuele Pirro. His second race didn&#x27;t fare much better as the Adelaide circuit was a wash-out, torrential rain leading to a curtailed event. Wendlinger was classified in 20th place, two laps down on eventual winner Ayrton Senna, after aquaplaning on some of the huge puddles of water present that day.

Wendlinger was kept at the renamed March team in 1992, alongside Paul Belmondo. The team were struggling financially due to the withdrawal of the Leyton House organisation, the only modifications to the 1991 car being reworking the cockpit to accommodate Wendlinger&#x27;s tall frame. The results were very encouraging, including starting 7th at the opening South African Grand Prix but results were limited by the team&#x27;s financial restraints. For example, at the Spanish Grand Prix the drying track at the start saw the Footwork team make a late change of tyres to their cars on the starting grid, incurring a fine but finishing 5th and 7th. Wendlinger was 8th, March being unable to afford the fine for changing his tyres at the same time. However, at the Canadian Grand Prix in Montreal a race of attrition allowed Wendlinger to bring the car home in fourth position, albeit a lap down — but nonetheless a huge result considering the financial troubles his team were in. These three points allowed Wendlinger to finish 12th in the Drivers&#x27; Championship ahead of respected names such as Ivan Capelli, Thierry Boutsen, Johnny Herbert and former Brabham and Tyrrell driver Stefano Modena.

===1993–1995: Sauber===
For 1993, Wendlinger was re-united with Peter Sauber, who that year had become a Formula One team owner. Much was expected of the team and early on Wendlinger and teammate JJ Lehto mixed with the front runners. Initially, he was out-paced by Lehto, who scored points in two of the first four races, though some of this was down to bad luck; Wendlinger had qualified 5th at Donington for example, only to be eliminated by Michael Andretti on the first lap. At the Monaco Grand Prix Wendlinger and Lehto collided, the team blaming Lehto. After that, Wendlinger&#x27;s results improved. He scored his first point of the season in the next round and added three more points scores — the best being 4th at the Italian Grand Prix after a long battle with Andretti. Other points finishes in Portugal and Hungary helped give Wendlinger 12th in the Drivers&#x27; Championship again with seven points — two points and a place ahead of the more experienced Lehto.

For 1994, Wendlinger was retained as Mercedes made their official return to Formula One, buying a stake in Ilmor and becoming the team&#x27;s engine supplier. Heinz-Harald Frentzen arrived in place of Lehto. The season started well for Wendlinger: He scored a point in the first race of the year at Interlagos and drove to fourth place in the San Marino race, an event marred by the deaths of both Wendlinger&#x27;s countryman Roland Ratzenberger and the 3-time world champion Ayrton Senna.

The next race was in Monaco for the fourth round of the Championship. During the first practice session, Wendlinger exited the tunnel and lost control of the car under braking for the Nouvelle Chicane. The Sauber, sliding sideways, hit a barrier with considerable force; the barrier was protected by large plastic containers that were supposed to be filled with water but were not. Although his vital signs were quickly stabilized, he remained in a coma for several weeks and did not drive in a race for the rest of the year. He had planned to make his comeback at the Japanese Grand Prix, but pre-race testing revealed his neck was not strong enough.

Wendlinger recovered from his injuries before the start of the 1995 Formula One season, where he would be driving at Sauber (now with Ford engines) alongside Frentzen. However, he performed poorly and was reluctantly replaced in the team before the Monaco Grand Prix, a year on from the accident, by Jean-Christophe Boullion. Peter Sauber then recalled Wendlinger for the final two races of the season in one last attempt to regain his pre-accident form, without success. Wendlinger later recounted that he had admitted to himself that his Monaco crash had left him unable to &quot;withstand the stresses and strains of Formula One&quot;.

==After Formula One==
Since then, he has competed successfully in sports cars and touring cars, winning the FIA GT Championship (with Olivier Beretta) in 1999. After a spell racing for Abt-Audi in DTM in 2002 and 2005 he raced for JMB Racing in FIA GT again, driving a Maserati MC12 with Andrea Bertolini.

Since 2006, Wendlinger has been part of the JetAlliance Racing team, competing again in the FIA GT Championship. His teammate in 2006 was Phillip Peter, and in 2007 his teammate was Scottish driver, Ryan Sharp.

2007 Wendlinger competed at the 24 Hours of Daytona with Sigal Sport team in a BMW powered Riley DP. He crashed during the night on his in lap at the end of his second stint and was sent to the hospital as a precaution. The car eventually was retired from the damage.

===2008===
Wendlinger competed for JetAlliance Racing in 2008 alongside Ryan Sharp. They started well at the RAC Tourist Trophy round from Silverstone. Wendlinger and Sharp won the GT1 class and overall race ahead of Michael Bartels and Andrea Bertolini&#x27;s Maserati MC12.

==Personal life==
Wendlinger is married and has two children. His son is a professional footballer who plays as a goalkeeper for Dutch side Almere City FC.

<doc id="761575" wikidata="Q192419" url="?curid=761575" title="Diencephalon">
<text>In the human brain, the diencephalon (or interbrain) is a division of the forebrain (embryonic &quot;prosencephalon&quot;). It is situated between the telencephalon and the midbrain (embryonic &quot;mesencephalon&quot;). The diencephalon has also been known as the tweenbrain in older literature. It consists of structures that are on either side of the third ventricle, including the thalamus, the hypothalamus, the epithalamus and the subthalamus.

The diencephalon is one of the main vesicles of the brain formed during embryogenesis. During the third week of development a neural tube is created from the ectoderm, one of the three primary germ layers. The tube forms three main vesicles during the third week of development: the prosencephalon, the mesencephalon and the rhombencephalon. The prosencephalon gradually divides into the telencephalon (the cerebrum) and the diencephalon.

==Structure==
The diencephalon consists of the following structures:
* Thalamus
* Hypothalamus including the posterior pituitary
* Epithalamus which consists of:
** Anterior and posterior paraventricular nuclei
** Medial and lateral habenular nuclei
** Stria medullaris thalami
** Posterior commissure
** Pineal body
* Subthalamus

===Attachments===
The optic nerve (CNII) attaches to the diencephalon. The optic nerve is a sensory (afferent) nerve responsible for vision and sight; it runs from the eye through the optic canal in the skull and attaches to the diencephalon. The retina itself is derived from the optic cup, a part of the embryonic diencephalon.

==Function==

The diencephalon is the region of the embryonic vertebrate neural tube that gives rise to anterior forebrain structures including the thalamus, hypothalamus, posterior portion of the pituitary gland, and the pineal gland. The diencephalon encloses a cavity called the third ventricle. The thalamus serves as a relay centre for sensory and motor impulses between the spinal cord and medulla oblongata, and the cerebrum. It recognizes sensory impulses of heat, cold, pain, pressure etc. The floor of the third ventricle is called the hypothalamus. It has control centres for control of eye movement and hearing responses.

<text>Otto Ferdinand Graf von Abensperg und Traun (or sometimes Otto Ferdinand von Abensperg und Traun), (27 August 167718 February 1748) was an Austrian &quot;Generalfeldmarschall&quot;. The current spelling of the name, and the spelling used in his time, is mostly Abensperg.

==Life==
A member of the ancient Abensberg-Traun family, he was born at Ödenburg and was the son of Imperial Count Otto Laurenz von Abensperg und Traun (1638–1695) and his second wife, Eva Susanna Rüber von Pixendorf (1645–1695). He was sent to Halle to complete his education, but in 1693 left the university to serve with the Prussian contingent of the allied army in the Low Countries. He saw extensive service in the War of the Grand Alliance, and at its close entered the Imperial Army. The War of the Spanish Succession soon followed, in which Traun served with distinction in Italy and on the Rhine till 1709, when he became lieutenant-colonel and &quot;aide-de-camp&quot; to Field Marshal Count Guido Starhemberg (1654–1737) in Spain.

A year later, for specially distinguished services, he was made a colonel, and in 1712 the chief of a regiment of foot. Soon after the close of the war he was again actively employed, and at the action of Francavilla in Sicily (20 June 1719) he received a severe wound. For his services in this campaign in southern Italy he was promoted to &quot;Generalfeldwachtmeister&quot; in 1723. In 1727 he became governor of Messina, and in 1733 he attained the rank of lieutenant field marshal.

In 1734 he won a European reputation for his defence of the pass of S. Germano and subsequent defence of the half-ruined fortress of Capua during the southern Italian campaign of the War of the Polish Succession, which he surrendered, marching out with the honours of war on 30 November. He was at once promoted Feldzeugmeister and employed in a difficult semi-political command in Hungary, after which he was made commander-in-chief in northern Italy and interim governor-general of the Milanese, in which capacity he received the homage of the army and civil authorities on the accession of Maria Theresa in 1740. In the following year he was made a field-marshal.

He successfully conducted the Italian campaigns of the War of the Austrian Succession up to 1743, when, on the death of Field-Marshal Count Khevenhüller, he was made the principal military adviser of Prince Charles Alexander of Lorraine, who commanded the Austrians in Bohemia and on the Danube. In this capacity he inspired the brilliant operations which led up to the passage of the Rhine and the skillful strategy whereby Frederick of Prussia was forced to evacuate Bohemia and Moravia (1744) without a battle.

Traun&#x27;s last active service was the command of an army which was sent to Frankfurt to influence the election of a new emperor to succeed Charles VII. He died at Hermannstadt (Sibiu, present Romania) on 18 February 1748 and was buried in the local Jesuit Church.

<text>Island Air (officially Hawaii Island Air) was a commuter airline based in Honolulu, Hawaii. It operated scheduled inter-island passenger services in Hawaii. Its main base was the Daniel K. Inouye International Airport on Oahu.

The airline maintained a code share and frequent flyer agreement with United Airlines. Hawaiian Airlines halted its commercial relationship with Island Air in 2012 when it announced plans to begin operating ATR 42 regional turboprop airliners in the islands under its own brand. Island Air also operated its own frequent flyer program, Island Miles (formerly Cloud 9).

Island Air ceased all operations on 10 November 2017 after 37 years of service between Hawaii&#x27;s islands, carrying 13% of intra-Hawaii seats in the first three quarters of 2017, competing against Hawaiian Airlines carrying 80%. For the second quarter of 2017, Island Air posted an operating loss of $4.9 million and a net loss of $8.2 million, and filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection on 17 October as it couldn&#x27;t find new investors to satisfy lessors Wells Fargo Bank Northwest and Elix 8 who want to repossess its five Bombardier Q400s, which replaced five ATRs.

== History ==

=== Princeville Airways ===

Island Air was incorporated in 1980 by Colorado-based Consolidated Oil and Gas as Princeville Airways. It began scheduled services on September 9, 1980, between Honolulu (HNL) and Princeville, Kauai (HPV) using two de Havilland Canada DHC-6 Twin Otter STOL capable turboprop aircraft. It served this initial regular commuter route between Princeville and Honolulu primarily for Princeville Resort guests. The airline then expanded its interisland routes with service to Hana, Maui; Hoolehua, Molokai; Kahului, Maui; Kamuela, Hawaii (Big Island); Kapalua, Maui (West Maui) and Lanai City, Lanai. The Princeville Airways fleet was expanded and eventually consisted of eight DHC-6 Twin Otter aircraft.

=== Aloha Island Air ===

In May 1987, Consolidated Oil and Gas sold Princeville Airways to Aloha Air Group, the parent company of Aloha Airlines. Princeville Airways was renamed Aloha Island Air and served the growing inter-island commuter market on behalf of Aloha Airlines on routes that could not justify larger Boeing 737-200 jetliners operated by Aloha. In June 1992, Aloha Island Air registered the name Island Air as its trade name. In 1995, newly renamed Island Air was granted certification by the Federal Aviation Administration to operate larger aircraft to serve the burgeoning commuter market in Hawaii. In April of that year, Island Air took possession of its first thirty-seven seat de Havilland Canada DHC-8 Dash 8 aircraft.

===Ownership under Gavarnie Holding, LLC===
In December 2003, it was announced that Gavarnie Holding, LLC would purchase Aloha IslandAir from the Aloha AirGroup, making Island Air Hawaii&#x27;s third largest independent airline. The purchase was completed on May 11, 2004, and the company was renamed Hawaii Island Air, Inc., although the airline continued to do business as &quot;Island Air&quot;. After the purchase, Island Air expanded its business, acquiring more aircraft and flying new routes.

In May 2008, Island Air was awarded Essential Air Service routes from Kansas City International Airport to Joplin, Missouri, Grand Island, Nebraska, Harrison, Arkansas, and Hot Springs, Arkansas but did not announce specific starting dates. The following month, however, the airline withdrew from its contract after concluding that a mid-September startup date was unrealistic, citing staffing and fuel costs.

On August 17, 2009, Island Air discontinued all service to Hilo.

In 2012, as the Dash 8 fleet began to approach their useful cycle life, the airline reached out to PenAir of Alaska and wet leased a single Saab 340 turboprop aircraft for 10 months.

On July 19, 2012, Island Air revealed a new business model which included a complete image and brand overhaul. This coincided with the arrival of the airline&#x27;s new ATR fleet of turboprop aircraft in August. The airline also unveiled a new website to go alongside its new brand and image launch.

On October 4, 2012, Les Murashige was appointed as the company&#x27;s new president and CEO replacing Lesley Kaneshiro.

===Ownership under Ohana Airline Holdings, LLC===
On January 10, 2013, Island Air announced that the company would be sold to an undisclosed buyer.

On January 18, 2013, Oracle Corporation CEO Larry Ellison, who had recently acquired most of the island of Lanai from David H. Murdock, was reported to be the buyer, though this was not confirmed by the airline at the time.

On February 26, 2013, the sale to Ellison was complete. That same day, the airline certified its first ATR 72, which would go into service the following day. Ellison appointed Paul Casey, former CEO of Hawaiian Airlines and President of the Hawaii Visitors and Convention Bureau as the company&#x27;s new president and CEO.

On May 31, 2013, Island Air ended service to Kapalua/West Maui Airport, as a result of phasing out the airline&#x27;s Dash 8 aircraft and the ATR 72&#x27;s inability to land at the airport&#x27;s short runway. In conjunction, service was resumed to Kahului, Maui on April 15, 2013.

In 2014, Island Air discontinued service to Ho&#x27;olehua, Molokai.

On September 3, 2014, in a surprise announcement, Island Air appointed David Pflieger, president and chief executive officer of Fort Lauderdale, Florida-based Silver Airways to assume the roles of president and chief executive officer. Effective October 1, 2014, Pflieger replaced former Hawaiian Airlines CEO Paul Casey who was asked to step down. Prior to Silver, Pflieger led the highly successful turnaround at Fiji Airways and was a former Virgin America and Delta Air Lines senior executive.

In December, 2014, the airline announced that due to six quarters of prior losses under previous management, it was delaying delivery of new Bombardier Q400 propjet aircraft and also undertaking a comprehensive re-assessment of its fleet, network, and other aspects of its business.

On April 29, 2015, Island Air announced it would be eliminating Honolulu service to Kauai beginning June 1 and reducing daily frequency by more than half on its Lanai route starting on that date. The airline also announced it will be cutting its workforce by 20 percent as well as canceling delivery of new aircraft in the short term as the airline works to reposition itself as the second largest carrier in the islands. These changes come after the company cited record financial losses of more than $21 million last year alone.

In September, 2015, Island Air began voluntarily reporting its much improved monthly and quarterly on-time performance and flight completion factor (80.4% and 99.2% respectively) so that current and potential customers can see how the airline is performing as it continues to improve and position itself for a strong future as Hawaii&#x27;s alternative inter island airline.

On January 7, 2016, Larry Ellison&#x27;s Ohana Airline Holdings, LLC announced that it planned to sell a controlling interest in Island Air to PaCap Aviation Finance and Malama Investments, two investment companies managed by local investment firm, PacifiCap.

On February 8, 2016, following the formal approval of the transfer in ownership by the U.S. Department of Transportation, it was announced that Dave Pflieger, who joined as CEO in October 2014 and presided over its successful restructuring, turnaround, and sale, would be leaving Island Air to work directly for Ellison in an unspecified role and turning the reins back over to Les Murashige, a former Island Air executive, who would become president and CEO under the airline&#x27;s new owners, PacifiCap LLC.

===Ownership under PacifiCap===

On January 21, 2016, Island Air announced plans to restore service to Kauai beginning on March 15 after suspending flights in June 2015 due to restructuring. The airline stated that approximately 32 airport-related jobs would be created and hinted that expansion aren&#x27;t done yet with hopes to re-enter other destinations that Island Air previously served.

Island Air ended service to Lanai on March 31, 2016.

On April 14, 2016, Island Air announced its plans to restart service between Honolulu and Kona starting June 14 with five daily round-trip flights. The last time Island Air served Kona was in December 2012. This service restoration was estimated to create 25 new airport-related jobs. Island Air president and CEO Les Murashige stated that Hilo was also being evaluated.

On April 26, 2016, Island Air&#x27;s CEO Les Murashige and COO Rob Mauracher stepped down from their posts. This was the second time in two months that Island Air had experienced a reshuffling of their senior management team. Shortly thereafter, Island Air named David Uchiyama as its new president and CEO.

== Destinations ==
On its last days of operations, Island Air served the following destinations:

== Fleet ==
The airline took delivery of a Bombardier Q400 (N539DS) propjet in March 2006 via a five-year lease. In September 2006, the airline announced that it was withdrawing the aircraft from inter-island service the following month, with delivery of two additional Q400s rescheduled to 2007. The airline then returned all Q400 propjets and stated at the time that it had no plans to return these aircraft to service. However, the Q400 was eventually placed back into service by the airline.

&quot;Aviation Week &amp; Space Technology&quot; reported on May 19, 2011, that the airline was looking to add one or two additional Dash 8 aircraft, and was also discussing new aircraft options with ATR, Fokker, Saab, and SuperJet International. The airline announced in late February 2012 that it had reached an agreement to lease six ATR 72 regional turboprop aircraft, along with a smaller Saab 340 turboprop wet leased from PenAir. The airline stated in July 2012 that deliveries of ATR 42 and ATR 72 aircraft would begin the following month.

After acquiring the ATR 72 aircraft, Island Air found them to be unreliable to the point that the airline was reviewing potential replacements . On March 31, 2014, Island Air placed firm orders for two Bombardier Dash 8 Q400 regional turboprop aircraft with the intention of replacing the ATR 72 with Q400.

Due to record financial losses of more than $21 million, on April 29, 2015, Island Air announced its intention to cancel the delivery of new Bombardier Dash 8 Q400 aircraft in the short term as the airline attempted to reposition itself as the second largest air carrier in the Hawaiian islands.

On November 10, 2017, Island Air announced that they would cease operations after 37 years of service. The interisland air carrier was operating Bombardier Q400 turboprop aircraft at the time of its shutdown.

== Accidents and incidents ==
On October 28, 1989, a de Havilland Canada DHC-6 Twin Otter operating as Aloha Island Air Flight 1712 crashed into a mountainous terrain killing 20 people. The National Transportation Safety Board determined that the probable cause of this accident was the airplane&#x27;s controlled flight into terrain as a result of the decision of the captain to continue flight under visual flight rules at night into instrument meteorological conditions, which obscured rising mountainous terrain.

== Services ==
=== Island Miles ===
Island Miles (formerly Cloud 9) was the travel rewards program of Island Air. The program&#x27;s airline partners included Star Alliance member United Airlines. Island Air also had an interline agreement with American Airlines. Aloha Airlines was formerly an airline partner until it discontinued passenger operations.

The Island Miles program had no membership fee and flight credits were valid for three years following the date of the flight. Island Miles accounts which did not earn any flight credits for two years could be placed on &quot;inactive status&quot; and any credits on the account would have been forfeited. After six flight segments, a one-way award ticket was credited to the member, and after 12 flight credits, a round trip award ticket.

<text>The Constituent Cortes () is the description of Spain&#x27;s parliament, the Cortes, when convened as a constituent assembly.

In the 20th century, only one Constituent Cortes was officially opened (Cortes are &quot;opened&quot; in accordance with a mediaeval royal proclamation), and that was the Republican Cortes in 1931. It drafted a new constitution but its work was overturned by the victory of the Nationalists in the Spanish Civil War.

The Cortes in 1977 enacted a new Spanish constitution which it had drafted. It was never officially considered &quot;constituent&quot;, as the assembly chosen in the 1977 general elections was not mandated at the time to create a new constitution, but to rule under the constitution of the former dictatorship – the so-called &quot;Leyes Fundamentales&quot; (fundamental laws).

<text>José Tomás Ovalle y Bezanilla (; December 21, 1787 – March 21, 1831) was a Chilean political figure. He served twice as provisional president of Chile.

==Early life==
He was born in Santiago, the son of Vicente María Ovalle Guzmán and of María del Rosario Bezanilla y Noriega. He studied in the Convictorio Carolino and law at the Universidad de San Felipe, where he obtained his doctorate in both laws in 1809. He married his cousin, Rafaela Bezanilla Bezanilla on April 1, 1812, and had eleven children.

Ovalle was twice elected deputy for Santiago (1823 and 1824–1825), supplementary senador (1824), Vice presidente of the Provincial Assembly of Santiago and was a delegate to the Plenipotentiaries Congress of 1830, being elected vice president.

==Civil War of 1829==
When the Chilean Civil War of 1829 broke out between the conservative centralists and the liberal federalists, President Francisco Antonio Pinto was forced twice to leave the post of president to Francisco Ramón Vicuña Larraín. First, from July 14 to October 19, when Vicuña assumed power as President Delegate, and then finally when he resigned on November 2 and Vicuña assumed full power.

On December 7, 1829, the conservative troops under General José Joaquín Prieto Vial, commander of the southern army, approached Santiago from the South. The conservative army decided to halt the march onto Santiago for a while and camped a few miles outside the city. The government under Vicuña fled northward to Coquimbo. On December 14, 1829, General Prieto and his troops met the liberal army under Francisco de la Lastra and defeated them at the Battle of Ochagavía. Then, the two military leaders signed a peace treaty, which complicated the political situation further. Meanwhile, President Vicuña and his ministers were imprisoned by the victorious conservative troops in Valparaiso.

==First administration==
Chile was without a leader for a few weeks (from December 7 to 24, 1829) until a Government Junta was organized and took control, in order to avoid the continuance of hostilities, under a neutral José Tomás Ovalle who was acceptable to both sides. This junta ruled the country from December 24, 1829, to February 18, 1830. Finally an agreement was found with the involvement of Ramón Freire which nominated Francisco Ruiz-Tagle Portales as acting president.

==Second administration==
Because of internal dissent with his ministers, Ruiz-Tagle Portales resigned six weeks later on March 31, 1830, and was succeeded by vice president Ovalle who assumed as a transitional president, and held the position until the advanced state of his tuberculosis forced him to ask for a constitutional leave on March 8, 1831. He died a few days later, on March 21, 1831, at 9 AM, and his remains were interred under the altar of the Santiago Cathedral, where they were lost during the renovations of the 19th century and found again in 2004.

After José Tomás Ovalle died, he was replaced by the President of the Plenipotentiaries Congress, Fernando Errázuriz Aldunate, who took over on March 31, 1831, with the title of &quot;Accidental Vice President of the Republic&quot;. Errázuriz Aldunate called new elections, where General José Joaquín Prieto Vial was elected. General Prieto was installed on September 18, 1831, and thus began the era of the decade governments.

<text>The Deep Sea Drilling Project (DSDP) was an ocean drilling project operated from 1968 to 1983. The program was a success, as evidenced by the data and publications that have resulted from it. The data are now hosted by Texas A&amp;M University, although the program was coordinated by the Scripps Institution of Oceanography at the University of California, San Diego. DSDP provided crucial data to support the seafloor spreading hypothesis and helped to prove the theory of plate tectonics. DSDP was the first of three international scientific ocean drilling programs that have operated over more than 40 years. It was followed by the Ocean Drilling Program (ODP) in 1985, the Integrated Ocean Drilling Program in 2004 and the present International Ocean Discovery Program in 2013.

==History==

The initial contract between the National Science Foundation (NSF) and the Regents of the University of California was signed on June 24, 1966. This contract initiated the first phase of the DSDP, which was based in Scripps Institution of Oceanography at the University of California, San Diego. Global Marine, Inc. conducted the drilling operations. The Levingston Shipbuilding Company laid the keel of the &quot;Glomar Challenger&quot; on October 18, 1967, in Orange, Texas. It sailed down the Sabine River to the Gulf of Mexico, and after a period of testing, DSDP accepted the ship on August 11, 1968.

Through contracts with Joint Oceanographic Institutions (JOI), NSF supported the scientific advisory structure for the project and funded pre-drilling geophysical site surveys. Scientific planning was conducted under the auspices of the Joint Oceanographic Institutions for Deep Earth Sampling (JOIDES). The JOIDES advisory group consisted of 250 distinguished scientists from academic institutions, government agencies, and private industry from all over the world. Over the next 30 months, the second phase consisted of drilling and coring in the Atlantic, Pacific, and Indian Ocean as well as the Mediterranean and Red Sea. Technical and scientific reports followed during the period. The second phase of DSDP ended on August 11, 1972.

The success of the &quot;Glomar Challenger&quot; was almost immediate. On one of the sites with a water depth of , core samples revealed the existence of salt domes. Oil companies received samples after an agreement to publish their analysis. The potential of oil beneath deep ocean salt domes remains an important avenue for commercial development today.

As for the purpose of the scientific exploration, one of the most important discoveries was made when the crew drilled 17 holes at 10 different locations along an oceanic ridge between South America and Africa. The retrieved core samples provided strong proof for continental drift and seafloor renewal at rift zones. This confirmation of Alfred Wegener&#x27;s theory of continental drift strengthened the proposal of a single, ancient land mass, which is called Pangaea. The samples gave further evidence to support the plate tectonics theory, which at the time attempted to explain the formation of mountain ranges, earthquakes, and oceanic trenches. Another discovery was how youthful the ocean floor is in comparison to Earth&#x27;s geologic history. After analysis of samples, scientists concluded that the ocean floor is probably no older than 200 million years. This is in comparison with the 4.5 billion-year age of the Earth.

The International Phase of Ocean Drilling (IPOD) began in 1975 with the Federal Republic of Germany, Japan, the United Kingdom, the Soviet Union, and France joining the United States in field work aboard the &quot;Glomar Challenger&quot; and in post-cruise scientific research. The Glomar Challenger docked for the last time with DSDP in November 1983. Parts of the ship, such as its dynamic positioning system, engine telegraph, and thruster console, are stored at the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, D.C. With the advent of larger and more advanced drilling ships, the JOIDES Resolution replaced the &quot;Glomar Challenger&quot; in January 1985. The new program, called the Ocean Drilling Program (ODP), continued exploration from 1985 to 2003, at which point it was replaced by the Integrated Ocean Drilling Program (IODP).

==Coring operations==
Although itself a remarkable engineering accomplishment, the &quot;Glomar Challenger&quot; saw many advances in deep-ocean drilling. One problem solved involved the replacement of worn drill bits. A length of pipe suspended from the ship down to the bottom of the sea might have been as long as . The maximum depth penetrated through the ocean bottom could have been as great as . To replace the bit, the drill string must be raised, a new bit attached, and the string remade down to the bottom. However, the crew had to thread this string back into the same drill hole. The technique for this formidable task was accomplished on June 14, 1970, in the Atlantic Ocean in of water off the coast of New York. This re-entry was accomplished with the use of sonar scanning equipment and a re-entry cone that had a diameter of and height of .

One major technological advance was the extended use of the holes after drilling. Geophysical and geochemical measurements were made during and after drilling, and occasionally long-term seismic monitoring devices were installed in the holes. This extended understanding of the dynamic processes involved in plate tectonics. Another technological advance involved the introduction of the hydraulic piston corer (HPC) in 1979, which permitted the recovery of virtually undisturbed cores of sediment.
This greatly enhanced the ability of scientists to study ancient ocean environments.

From August 11, 1968, to November 11, 1983, the Glomar Challenger achieved the following accomplishments:

==Core samples, publications, and data==
The ship retrieved core samples in cores with a diameter of . These cores are currently stored at three repositories in the US, Germany, and Japan. One half of each core is called the archive half and is preserved for future use. The working half of each core is used to provide samples for ongoing scientific research.

The scientific results were published as the &quot;Initial Reports of the Deep Sea Drilling Project&quot;, which contains the results of studies of the recovered core material and the associated geophysical information from the expeditions from 1968 to 1983. These reports describe the core materials and scientific data obtained at sea and in shore-based laboratories post-cruise. These volumes were originally prepared for NSF under contract by the University of California, Scripps Institution of Oceanography. In 2007, the printed books were scanned and prepared for electronic presentation by the Texas A&amp;M University College of Geosciences.

=== Discovery and accomplishment in Antarctic region===
DSDP completed four drilling programs; Legs 28, 29, 35 and 36 around Antarctica during four Austral summers, 1972–73, 1973–74, 1974–75 and 1975–76. These programs were focused on two main objectives: Cenozoic global paleoclimatic changes and plate tectonic movements around Antarctica. 
There were a total of 15 wells drilled around the Antarctic continent, including 4 wells in the Ross Sea, 5 wells on the continental margins, 2 wells in the abyssal plain and 4 wells across the SE Indian Ridge, among which the Site 270 was drilled at the highest latitude (77° 26.45′ S). Analyses of data collected from the drilling accomplish the following results:

==== Sea floor spreading ====
Prior to the deep sea drilling program, the ages of the oceanic basalt were estimated based on magnetic lineations generated at the spreading center as the sea floor pulled apart. Sediments immediately overlying the basalt should have ages similar to the age of magnetic stripes. This is confirmed by the micropaleontologic analyses of the basal sediments sampled above the penetrated basalts. These analyses furthermore substantiate that Australia was separated from Antarctic 85 Mya [million years ago]

==== Inception of Antarctic ice cap ====
Based on paleo-soil study, the Ross shelf began to sink below sea-level about 25 Mya in the Oligocene. This suggests that Antarctic glaciers already advanced to the Ross Sea shelf. This age is consistent with the dating of the shallow unconformity seen on the seismic profiles. The unconformity was attributed to the glacier erosion when advancing to the coastal area. Development of the Circum Antarctic Current was also initiated in the Oligocene. In addition, drilling onshore around the Ross Sea and on the Antarctic Peninsular also confirms that Antarctic ice sheet already existed at least since the Oligocene.

==== Ice-rafted debris ====
The occurrence of ice-rafted debris in marine sediments is an indication of icebergs&#x27; presence. Hence the earliest occurrence in the high latitudes could possibly reveal the inception of sea-level glaciations. It should be pointed out that there are factors influencing the distribution of ice-rafted debris, such as ocean currents, and sea water near surface temperatures. Hence the earliest occurrence should be considered as the minimum age of ice rafting at sample locations. Investigations of ice-rafted debris reasonably conclude that the Antarctic ice sheet was initiated at least 25 Mya and cumulated at about 4.5 Mya, as evidenced by ice-rafted debris reaching farthest away from the continent

This interpretation of Antarctic glaciation history based on marine sediments was subsequently supported by the onshore study of the Antarctic Peninsular and by the coring results around McMurdo Ice Shelf.

==== Paleoclimate ====
Micropaleontologic data from deep sea sediments around the Antarctic continental margin indicate that since at least the late Oligocene-early Miocene, surface waters were relatively cool. With the continued cooling trend, the cold water mass gradually expanded northward until early Pliocene during which an intensified cooling episode resulted in a temperature minimum as evidenced by the northward shift of the silica/carbonate facies boundary. This deduction is similar to the conclusion based on ice-rated debris studies.

Surface temperatures inferred from the oxygen and carbon isotope analyses of both benthonic and planktonic foraminifera in high-latitude marine sediments show a general continuous cooling since early Eocene with a significant temperature drop at the Oligocene/Eocene boundary. This surface water temperature appears to indicate that Antarctic ice sheet probable at this time already reached to the coast. Glaciers on the continent at higher altitudes, however, may have started to grow since the early Eocene. This conclusion is in consistence with other reports documented above.

<doc id="761605" wikidata="Q319430" url="?curid=761605" title="Mahamane Ousmane">
<text>Mahamane Ousmane (born 20 January 1950) is a Nigerien politician. Elected as the fourth President of Niger at 43 years old, he is the youngest elected president in Africa. He was also the first democratically elected president of his country, serving from 16 April 1993 until he was deposed in a military &quot;coup d&#x27;état&quot; on 27 January 1996. He has continued to run for president in each election since his ouster, and he was president of the National Assembly from December 1999 to May 2009. Since April 2020, he is the president of the Democratic and Republican Renewal (RDR Tchanji), a major political party that is currently in opposition. RDR Tchanji formed an alliance with Ousmane&#x27;s other political vehicle, MNRD Hankuri, on 16 December 2018.

==1993 presidential election==
Ousmane, the candidate of the CDS, ran for president in the election held on 27 February 1993. He received second place, with 26.59% of the vote, behind Tandja Mamadou of the National Movement for the Development of Society (MNSD); however, with the backing of a coalition of parties known as the Alliance of the Forces of Change (AFC), Ousmane won the presidency in the second round, held on 27 March, taking 54.42%.

==Presidency==
During the second part of Ousmane&#x27;s term, the AFC, which included Ousmane&#x27;s party, held a parliamentary majority. In September 1993, however, Ousmane issued a decree that reduced the powers of the prime minister; the resignation of prime minister Mahamadou Issoufou soon followed, along with the withdrawal of his party, the Nigerien Party for Democracy and Socialism (PNDS), from the governing coalition. This left the coalition without a parliamentary majority; despite this, Ousmane appointed his CDS ally Souley Abdoulaye as prime minister, but the parliament quickly passed a vote of no confidence against Abdoulaye. Consequently, new parliamentary elections were called for January 1995. These elections resulted in a victory for the opposition, composed of a new alliance between the MNSD and the PNDS, and forced cohabitation between Ousmane and a government headed by MNSD Prime Minister Hama Amadou. This resulted in sharp rivalry and government deadlock; beginning in April, Ousmane refused to attend meetings of the Council of Ministers although he was constitutionally required to do so, and in July Amadou replaced the heads of state-owned companies, a move which Ousmane wanted to be reversed. Amadou also tried to assume the presidential role with regard to the Council of Ministers. Tensions continued to escalate, and Ousmane made clear his intention to dissolve the parliament and call new elections after the passing of one year (he was constitutionally prohibited from doing so sooner).

On 27 January 1996, Ibrahim Baré Maïnassara seized power in a military coup, pointing to the disordered political situation as justification. Ousmane was arrested and held at a military barracks for five days; he was then placed under house arrest until 24 April as were Amadou and Issoufou. In February, Ousmane was put on television, along with Amadou and Issoufou, to express the view that flaws in the operation of the political system were the cause of the coup, and to call for changes in the system.

==1996 and 1999 elections==
Ousmane received second place, with 19.75% of the vote, in the 7–8 July, 1996 presidential election, which was won by Maïnassara; on the second day of polling he was again placed under house arrest and was freed after two weeks. Following a pro-democracy demonstration on 11 January 1997, Ousmane was arrested along with Tandja and Issoufou and held until 23 January.

Ousmane took third place, with 22.51% of the vote, in the October 1999 presidential election, which occurred after the assassination of Maïnassara; he placed slightly behind second-place finisher Issoufou and therefore did not participate in the run-off held in November. Ousmane gave his support to Tandja, and Tandja defeated Issoufou to win the second round.

The November 1999 parliamentary election gave a majority to an alliance of Tandja&#x27;s MNSD and Ousmane&#x27;s CDS. Ousmane was elected to the National Assembly from Zinder constituency, and on 29 December 1999, he was elected President of the National Assembly.

==Events since 1999==
Ousmane was elected as the president of the Interparliamentary Committee of the West African Economic and Monetary Union on 9 March 2003, at its 12th session, and he was re-elected to that post at the 13th session in March 2004. He was also elected as the president of the Committee on the Human Rights of Parliamentarians of the Inter-Parliamentary Union (IPU) on 15 January 2004.

Ousmane was again chosen as the CDS presidential candidate at the party&#x27;s fifth extraordinary congress, held on 18 September 2004. He took third place in the November 2004 presidential election, receiving 17.4% of the vote. Following the December 2004 parliamentary election, Ousmane was re-elected President of the National Assembly on 16 December.

On 14 November 2006, Ousmane was elected as Speaker of the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) Parliament, defeating another Nigerien politician, Moumouni Adamou Djermakoye, by a vote of 58 to 37. He was to lead the regional parliament&#x27;s second legislature through a four-year transition period, which was set to end in 2010. In that position, he faced the task of coordinating the processes that would facilitate the introduction of direct universal suffrage in the election of members of the Parliament.

Objecting to Tandja&#x27;s efforts to call a referendum on a constitutional change that could allow him to continue as President, the CDS left the government in June 2009. Ousmane stressed that the CDS wanted the constitution to be respected and that Tandja &quot;must submit himself to the decision of the Constitutional Court&quot;, which had ruled against the referendum.

In opposition, the CDS participated in an opposition boycott of the August 2009 constitutional referendum as well as the October 2009 parliamentary election. With the hostility between the opposition and the Tandja government deepening, the authorities issued a warrant for Ousmane&#x27;s arrest; they also issued arrest warrants for PNDS President Mahamadou Issoufou and former Prime Minister Hama Amadou. Ousmane was living outside of Niger by that point. Following talks with officials from the European Union on 8 December 2009, Prime Minister Ali Badjo Gamatie announced that the arrest warrants were suspended to facilitate dialogue with the opposition. Ousmane said on 10 December that the move was encouraging, but that it was also necessary for the government to release those who he characterized as political prisoners. However, the arrest warrants were reactivated two weeks later, diminishing hopes for further dialogue. The government warned that Ousmane and the other opposition leaders would face arrest if they entered Niger.

Tandja was ousted in a military coup on 18 February 2010. That made it possible for Ousmane to return to Niger without being arrested, and he &quot;arrived discreetly&quot; on a flight from Abuja on 24 March 2010.

Ousmane was again chosen as the CDS presidential candidate for the February 2011 elections. He was unsuccessful in returning to the presidency again; this time coming in fourth place with 8.2% of the vote. In the 2016 presidential election, Ousmane again came fourth with 6.2% of the vote. In the 2020–21 election, he advanced to a runoff but lost to Mohamed Bazoum with 44.3% of the vote.

<text>Toronto Lynx was a Canadian soccer team based in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. Founded in 1997, the team last played in the 2014 season of the Premier Development League (PDL), the fourth tier of the American Soccer Pyramid, in the Great Lakes Division of the Central Conference. The team played its home games at Centennial Park Stadium, where they had played since 2003. The team&#x27;s colours were white, gold and black. The team had a sister organization, the Toronto Lady Lynx, who played in the women&#x27;s USL W-League, and also fielded a team in the USL&#x27;s Super-20 League, a league for players 17 to 20 years of age run under the United Soccer Leagues umbrella.

In 2015, the Lynx men&#x27;s senior team was incorporated into League1 Ontario side Oakville Blue Devils. In late 2017, the teams merged completely under Oakville&#x27;s umbrella.

==History==

===A-League/USL First Division===
The Toronto Lynx announced its expansion rights in Toronto on June 24, 1996, and played their first A-League game in Jacksonville, Florida, on April 12, 1997, falling 3–1 to the Jacksonville Cyclones. The Toronto Lynx set an A-League record of 10 consecutive wins during their first season in 1997. In 2000, the Lynx proceeded to the Eastern Conference Finals and only a 1–0 loss to the Rochester Raging Rhinos kept the Lynx out of the A-League Championship game. Despite these temporary successes, over the years it spent in the A-League (later renamed USL-D1), the team fared relatively poorly on the field and ultimately failed to consistently draw crowds of more than about 2000 people.

Peter Pinizzotto was the Toronto Lynx head coach from 1997 to 2003. The team made one playoff appearance under his reign. The next season he would be hired as assistant coach for rivals Montreal Impact. In September 2003, Duncan Wilde was appointed as the new Toronto Lynx head coach for the 2004 season bringing a new philosophy and vision for the club. Wilde also holds the position of Director of the Toronto Lynx Premier Soccer Academy and Super Y-League Program for accomplishing the mission of developing and inspiring youth soccer talent in the Greater Toronto Area. After just one season, Wilde resigned from his head coaching position amidst rumours of owner interference in squad selection. During the 2005 season the team was managed by former Lynx goalkeeper Hubert Busby Jr., though Wilde returned as head coach for the 2006 season. In their debut season in the Open Canada Cup Wilde led the Lynx to the final of the tournament, but were defeated 2–0 by Ottawa St. Anthony Italia.

During their time in the A-League and USL First Division, the Lynx were noted for developing a number of notable players, but failed to retain most of them for long, leading to poor results in the league standings.

On October 10, 2006, the Lynx announced they were voluntarily relegating themselves two levels, to the USL Premier Development League. The reasons for this were never fully revealed, but it was most likely due to their low attendance (the lowest in the USL 1st Division at that time) and the fact that Major League Soccer expansion franchise Toronto FC would be arriving to the city the next season.

===USL Premier Development League===
Toronto&#x27;s first year in the PDL was a difficult one; they lost their opening game 3–0 to West Michigan Edge, and didn&#x27;t pick up their first win until the fifth game of the season, a 2–0 defeat away at the Indiana Invaders. The Lynx&#x27;s main problem was inconsistency, especially away from home, where they suffered several difficult defeats, including a 4–0 thrashing at the hands of Michigan Bucks, and a 3–1 defeat to Cleveland Internationals in early August. Their home form was generally much better, and they enjoyed several excellent results, notably a comprehensive 5–0 win over Indiana Invaders that included a two–goal haul for Murphy Wiredu, and a 5–1 revenge win over Cleveland in which Wiredu scored another brace. An unexpected 3–1 victory over divisional champs Michigan on the final day of the season ended the year brightly; they finished in fourth place, just six points off a playoff spot. The prolific Murphy Wiredu was the Lynx&#x27;s top scorer, with 10 goals.

Toronto built on their 2007 form with a generally better season in 2008. They overpowered Fort Wayne Fever 4–1 in their opening fixture in front of over 1,200 fans, and enjoyed a scintillating run of form throughout the month of June, picking up five wins two ties in nine games, including a breathless 3–2 win over West Michigan Edge in which they scored twice in the last two minutes, and a strong 1–0 win over the eventual divisional champions, Michigan Bucks. Despite a pair of impressive back-to-back 4–0 wins over Indiana Invaders and Cincinnati Kings in the run-in—the last of which saw all four goals being scored by Daniel Revivo—Toronto&#x27;s final day defeat to Michigan left them in third place in the Great Lakes division, squeaking into the playoffs on &#x27;games won&#x27; ahead of Des Moines Menace, but needing to negotiate a preliminary &#x27;Divisional Round&#x27; play-in game against Cleveland Internationals. Unfortunately for the Lynx, Cleveland scored a late winner to take the game 2–1, sending the Ontarians home early. Daniel Revivo was Toronto&#x27;s top scorer, with nine goals on the season, while Welshman Lloyd Grist contributed four assists.

<text>Wilthorpe is an area of Barnsley in South Yorkshire, England.

Bisected by the A635 Huddersfield Road, Wilthorpe has several small shops and an infant school, as well as an ATS garage and a dentist.

Wilthorpe sits in the S75 area of Barnsley, along with the neighbouring districts of Pogmoor, Gawber, and Mapplewell. The village is popular among young professionals who commute to the cities of Leeds, Sheffield and Manchester.

== Amenities ==
The local pub, The Wilthorpe Hotel, closed in early 2012 and re-opened later that year as a Tesco Express.

The main attraction in Wilthorpe is the park, with stunning rose gardens, a reclaimed wildlife area, and a playground. &quot;Tinkers Pond&quot; is situated at the bottom of Woodstock Road. This fishing spot was a former reservoir according to the 1850 Ordnance Survey Map of Barnsley. The lower pond is also used for fishing and was formerly the primary water source for the Greenfoot Bleaching Works. This was originally built by Joseph Beckett to bleach locally woven linen, some time before the Barnsley Canal opened here in 1802. Today there still exists evidence of Victorian-era drainage from the old reservoir to the lower pond.

The Emmanuel Church, which was built in the late 1990s, serves the area. It also functions as a village hall with several events and clubs held there every week.

== Barnsley Business Innovation Centre ==
Wilthorpe is home to the &quot;Barnsley Business and Innovation Centre&quot; (BBIC). This was established in 1987 as a private company (limited by guarantee), with a mission to assist in the economic regeneration of the Barnsley Borough.

<text>Alfred Baphethuxolo Nzo (19 June 1925 – 13 January 2000) was a South African politician. He served as the longest-standing secretary-general of the African National Congress. He occupied this position (ANC) between 1969 and 1991. He was also the South African minister of foreign affairs from 1994 to 1999. He was also the first black health inspector in the country. The Alfred Nzo Award is now awarded to deserving health practitioners in South Africa.

==Political career==
He was sent off to the Eastern Cape to receive missionary education. After completing his matric, he enrolled for BSc degree at University of Fort Hare in 1945. At Fort Hare he joined the African National Congress (ANC) Youth League and became actively involved in students politics. In his second year of study he left university and started work as health inspector at KwaDukathole in Germiston and was later transferred to the Alexandra health and community centre in 1951.

As health inspector, Nzo developed much understanding of the lives of millions of South Africans in the 1950s. He got actively involved in the organising of the Defiance Campaign in 1952. He was also involved in the campaign to interview people about the kind of society in which they would like to live. It was this campaign that culminated in the Congress of the People in 1955, at which the Freedom Charter was adopted.

In 1956 Nzo was elected the chairperson of ANC branch in Alexandra. In 1957 he organised the Alexandra bus boycotts in which people walked nine miles from the township to the city (Johannesburg) and back every day for three months to protest the increase in fares. His involvement in political activities cost him his job. His expulsion from work meant that he also lost his residential permit to live in Alexandra. He was subsequently arrested several times and finally sentenced to five months&#x27; imprisonment for not having a residence permit. He served his sentence at Modderbee Prison, where his father once worked.

In 1958, Nzo was elected to the regional and national executive committees of the ANC. In 1962, he was placed under 24-hour house arrest and in June 1963 detained for a period of 238 days. The following year, Nzo went into exile and took up posts in various countries including Egypt, India, Zambia and Tanzania.

In 1969, Nzo was elected ANC Secretary-General at the Morogoro Conference in Tanzania, and re-elected to this position at the Kwabe Conference in 1985.

On 30 December 1979 he and Oliver Tambo met Tim Jenkin, Stephen Lee and Alex Moumbaris, ANC members and escapees from incarceration at Pretoria Central Prison as political prisoners. Their presence was officially announced by the ANC in early January and Tambo introduced them at a press conference on 2 January 1980.

After the unbanning of the liberation movements in 1989, Nzo formed part of the ANC delegation that entered into deliberations with the National Party government. Nzo lost the position of Secretary-General to Cyril Ramaphosa at the ANC July 1991 National Conference held in South Africa for the first time after the unbanning of the liberation movements. He was then elected deputy head of the ANC&#x27;s security department.
After the first democratic elections in 1994, Nzo was appointed Minister of Foreign Affairs in the government of Nelson Mandela.

After the 1999 national elections, Nzo retired from politics and in December of the same year he died of a stroke and he was survived by his wife Regina Nzo who died on 27 September 2011 at the ages of 81 years old. He was buried at the Westpark Cemetery in Johannesburg.

<text>Christopher O&#x27;Riley is an American classical pianist and public radio show host. He was the host of the weekly National Public Radio program &quot;From the Top&quot;. O&#x27;Riley is also known for his piano arrangements of songs by alternative musicians.

==Early life==
O&#x27;Riley was born in 1956 in Chicago, Illinois, United States, and grew up in Evanston, Illinois. He began classical piano studies at the age of 4, and became interested in pop music and started his own band in 6th grade. His dual-track musical interests led him to jazz-rock fusion and included a professional performance in his later high school years with the Pittsburgh alto sax player Eric Kloss. His choice of music school was fortuitous as the New England Conservatory of Music had as its president in the 1970s the composer/historian Gunther Schuller. It was upon entering NEC that O&#x27;Riley decided to pursue classical studies exclusively.

==Career==
In 1981, he won the Young Concert Artists International Auditions. He has received awards at the Leeds, Van Cliburn, Busoni and Montreal competitions, as well as an Avery Fisher Career Grant. O&#x27;Riley has made many recordings of classical music. His debut album, a collection of the works of Ferruccio Busoni, including the seldom performed &quot;Fantasia Contrappuntistica&quot;, was released in 1983. He has since released several recordings, including works of Maurice Ravel, Sergei Rachmaninoff, Jean-Philippe Rameau, John Adams, Igor Stravinsky, and Alexander Scriabin, as well as a recording of &quot;Rhapsody in Blue&quot; with the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra.

O&#x27;Riley is the former host of the weekly National Public Radio program &quot;From the Top&quot;, on which young musicians are heard and interviewed. According to its website, it is the most popular weekly one-hour classical music show on the air today. O&#x27;Riley first began performing Radiohead songs as a time-filler during a break in the program, to supplement preludes and miniatures by composers such as Debussy and Rachmaninoff. Many of those short classical pieces are found on his CD release &quot;At the Break&quot;. Initially designed as a media platform for all manner of young musicians, From The Top soon became exclusively dedicated to Classical music, and it was in this atmosphere that O&#x27;Riley decided to augment the format by inserting, unannounced, his own arrangements, presumably Classical pieces, of Radiohead songs. When listeners were apprised of the title and provenance of the pieces, emails came into the show asking &quot;Who is this Mr. Head and where can I find more of his beautiful music?&quot;

&quot;True Love Waits: Christopher O&#x27;Riley Plays Radiohead&quot;, his recording of his own piano arrangements of songs by the alternative rock band Radiohead, was released in 2003. O&#x27;Riley&#x27;s second Radiohead-derived album, &quot;Hold Me To This&quot;, followed two years later and contains a different selection of songs. Both albums had moderate success on the classical crossover charts. In 2006, he released a piano tribute to Elliott Smith, &quot;Home to Oblivion&quot;, again featuring his own arrangements.

O&#x27;Riley says that his renditions have introduced the music of Radiohead to a classical audience as well as introducing classical music to a wider or younger audience, as he sometimes performs both standard concert repertoire, such as Shostakovich or Mozart, and Radiohead, Elliott Smith or Nick Drake interpretations at the same concert. O&#x27;Riley describes himself as an obsessed Radiohead fan in interviews, and says he was attracted to the multilayered nature of the band&#x27;s music, leading him to listen to and transcribe lesser known album tracks, live bootleg recordings of performances, b-sides, and even songs never officially released, as well as some of their hit singles. In his liner notes for &quot;Home to Oblivion&quot;, he calls Elliott Smith &quot;the most important songwriter since Cole Porter,&quot; although admitting he was unaware of Smith&#x27;s music until his apparent suicide in 2003. When asked to explain his unusual choice of material for a classical pianist, O&#x27;Riley has often quoted Duke Ellington&#x27;s statement that &quot;there are two kinds of music. Good music, and the other kind.&quot;

O&#x27;Riley&#x27;s work has often been distinguished from other classical rock-tribute albums by music critics, who note O&#x27;Riley&#x27;s quality of playing. &quot;True Love Waits&quot; received 4 out of 5 stars from Rolling Stone magazine, allegedly the only &quot;classical&quot; recording to do so, while his Radiohead concert programs have received generally favorable notices from classical critics and promotion on NPR&#x27;s &quot;Performance Today&quot;.

==Personal life==
O&#x27;Riley currently resides in Los Angeles, California. His son, Conor Redmond O&#x27;Riley, was born on June 30, 1994, to Chris and his then wife, Marlene Fusaris.

<text>Robert Crompton (26 September 1879 – 16 March 1941) was an English professional footballer. He spent the entirety of his career with his hometown club, Blackburn Rovers. He also represented England on 41 occasions, captaining them 22 times.

==Playing career==
Born in Blackburn, Crompton spent his entire career at full-back for Blackburn Rovers, playing 528 games between 1896 and 1920. He won the league twice as captain of the team in 1912 and 1914. In the 1915–16 season he played for Blackpool in the regional leagues set up by the Football League during World War I where he was made club captain. His 41 England caps were a record until surpassed by Billy Wright in 1952. He began his career as a centre-half, but it was at full-back that he excelled, Charlie Buchan describing him as &quot;...the outstanding full-back of his time. A commanding personality, he was the best kicker of a ball I ever ran across.&quot;

==Managerial career==
Crompton later went on to manage Blackburn between 1926 and 1930, leading them to the FA Cup victory over Huddersfield Town in 1928. After a spell managing Bournemouth &amp; Boscombe Athletic, Crompton returned to Rovers as manager in the late 1930s to guide them to the Second Division championship.

Crompton had a heart attack in 1941 while watching Blackburn play Burnley, while he was still in charge of Blackburn. His team had just won the match 3–2. He died that evening.

==After retirement and legacy==
Crompton was in partnership with his Blackburn Rovers teammate, the Welsh international centre-forward William Davies, as motor engineers.

It was announced on 25 February 2015 via Twitter that Bob Crompton would be inducted to the Hall of Fame by the National Football Museum as a &#x27;Historic Player&#x27;.

Crompton became the first player (and manager) to be entered into the Blackburn Rovers Football Club Hall of Fame on 8 February 2019.

<text>Edgar Wilson &quot;Bill&quot; Nye (August 25, 1850February 22, 1896) was an American humorist. He was also the founder and editor of the &quot;Laramie Boomerang&quot;.

==Biography==
Nye was born in Shirley, Maine. His parents removed to a farm on the St. Croix river in northern Wisconsin in 1852, and he was educated at River Falls, Wisconsin, where he studied law. He moved to Wyoming Territory, and was admitted to the bar at Laramie City, Wyoming Territory in 1876. There he served as justice of the peace, superintendent of schools, member of the city council and postmaster. He began early to contribute humorous sketches to the newspapers, using the pen name of &quot;Bill Nye&quot; after a character in a famous poem by Bret Harte popularly known as &quot;The Heathen Chinee&quot;. He was connected with various western journals, and afterward settled in New York City.

The &quot;Boomerang&quot; was founded while Nye was the postmaster of Laramie. It launched him to national fame, gaining subscribers in every state and some foreign countries. In 1892, he wrote in &quot;The Century Magazine&quot;:

Some of his works include &quot;Bill Nye&#x27;s Comic History of the United States&quot;, &quot;Baled Hay&quot;, &quot;Remarks&quot;, &quot;Bill Nye and Boomerang&quot;, &quot;Bill Nye&#x27;s History of England&quot;, and &quot;Bill Nye&#x27;s Red Book&quot;. He is credited with the remark &quot;Wagner&#x27;s music is better than it sounds.&quot;.

Late in his career, he was briefly associated with James Whitcomb Riley with whom he wrote two books. They also appeared together on the lecture circuit. He also traveled and lectured with Luther Burbank.

He passed the later years of his life in Arden, North Carolina where he died of meningitis, and was buried in Calvary Episcopal Churchyard in Fletcher, Henderson County, North Carolina. A historical marker honoring him is located in St. Croix County, Wisconsin, between the towns of Roberts and River Falls, and a second is located in Fletcher, North Carolina. A small monument marks his birthplace in Shirley, Maine.

<doc id="761659" wikidata="Q7962862" url="?curid=761659" title="Wallace Nutting">
<text>Wallace Nutting (November 17, 1861 – July 19, 1941) was an American minister, photographer, artist, and antiquarian, who is most famous for his landscape photos of New England. He also was an accomplished author, lecturer, furniture maker, antiques expert and collector. His atmospheric photographs helped spur the Colonial Revival style.

==Early life==
He was born in Rock Bottom, Massachusetts (a village straddling Stow and Hudson), on Sunday, November 17, 1861, the second child of Albion and Elizabeth Nutting. His father was killed in the Civil War.

The family was descended from John Nutting, who came from England in 1639 and was killed by Indians during a raid against Groton, Massachusetts. The Indians severed John Nutting&#x27;s head and put it on a pole to discourage others from settling in the area.

==Education and personal life==
Wallace Nutting graduated from high school in Augusta, Maine. He studied at Phillips Exeter Academy, Harvard University, Hartford Theological Seminary and Union Theological Seminary. He graduated from Harvard with the class of 1887. Nutting earned a Doctor of Divinity degree from Whitman College in 1893. He received an honorary doctor of Humanities from Washington &amp; Jefferson College in 1938.

On June 5, 1888 he married Mariet Griswold in Buckland, Massachusetts. They had no children.

Nutting began his career as a Congregational minister in several towns including Minneapolis, Seattle, and Providence and Fryeburg, Maine, but he was forced to retire at age 43 because of poor health. He suffered from neurasthenia, and turned to bicycling as a means of relaxation and improving his health.

While in Providence, he read scripture at the funeral for Gorham Manufacturing Company Superintendent Charles Henry Baker at the Central Congregational Church.

==Work==

===Photography===
It was on these bicycle rides in the countryside that Nutting started taking photographs. In 1904 he opened the Wallace Nutting Art Prints Studio on East 23rd Street in New York. After a year he moved his business to a farm in Southbury, Connecticut. He called this place &quot;Nuttinghame&quot;. In 1912 he moved the photography studio to Framingham, Massachusetts, in a home he called &quot;Nuttingholme&quot;. That year he published a catalog of prints that was 97 pages and included about 900 images. By 1915, Nutting claimed to be earning $1,000 per day.

Nutting&#x27;s photographs ranged in subject and price to suit a variety of tastes. His catalog included pastoral scenes such as views of abbeys, cathedrals, bridges, mountains, flowers, and winding roads. One of his most common themes was &quot;Colonials&quot;, which were photos of women in traditional 18th-Century roles. These were traditional pictures of femininity, usually pictured indoors in front of a chest, chair, or looking glass. His prints sold from $1.25 to $20.

Nutting authored several books about the scenic beauties of New England, the United Kingdom, and Ireland. In the peak of his business he employed about two-hundred colorists. By his own account, Wallace Nutting sold ten million pictures. Wallace Nutting&#x27;s colorists painted the photographs which he took. These colorists would sometimes sign Wallace Nutting&#x27;s name on the photos which is why the signatures vary.

===Furniture===
Nutting had a collection of furniture which he used as props in his &quot;Colonial&quot; photography. This experience led him to start a business manufacturing and selling reproduction furniture. His expertise in this field led him to author a guidebook to American Windsor furniture in 1917. By 1918 his mail-order catalog offered dozens of Windsor chairs in several historic styles.

==Death and legacy==
Wallace Nutting died at his home at 24 Vernon St., Framingham, Massachusetts on Saturday, July 19, 1941, at age 79. His body was transported to Augusta, Maine for burial.

Nutting&#x27;s residence in Portsmouth, New Hampshire is also known as the Wentworth-Gardner House. A Wallace Nutting Society exists for the study of his work.

Today, Nutting&#x27;s furniture and photographs are widely collected.

<text>The Santa Margarita River which with the addition of what is now Temecula Creek, was formerly known as the Temecula River, is a short intermittent river on the Pacific coast of Southern California in the United States, approximately long. One of the last free-flowing rivers in Southern California, it drains an arid region at the southern end of the Santa Ana Mountains, in the Peninsular Ranges between Los Angeles and San Diego.

==History==
The Portolà expedition camped on the river on July 20, 1769 and named it for Saint Margaret of Antioch. A Santa Margarita rancheria is mentioned in 1795 and there is a February 23, 1836 land grant called Santa Margarita y San Onofre (later renamed Rancho Santa Margarita y Las Flores).

In 1881 the California Southern Railroad followed the route of the river. When the route was completed, it had 241 bridges crossing the river. While it was operating, Chinese Americans worked on the railroad. The route along the river was abandoned in 1891.

In the early 20th century, following a lawsuit against Vail Ranch in Temecula, water was guaranteed for the river to continue to flow. During much of the 20th century, and into the early 21st century, the river was the subject of a long-running water rights battle between the United States Navy and the Fallbrook Public Utility District. In August 2018, the Fallbrook Public Utility District sold its land on the river, ending its over 60-year plan to place a hydroelectric dam on the river; it will be preserved by the Wildlands Conservancy, which utilized funds from bonds authorized by Proposition 68 to purchase the land.

==Watershed and course==

The mainstem of the Santa Margarita River begins at the confluence of Temecula Creek and Murrieta Creek, in southwestern Riverside County, east of Interstate 15, southeast of Temecula. The river is formed when the two creeks merge. It flows southwest through the Temecula Canyon at the south end of the Santa Ana Mountains. Along its lower the river forms a large floodplain as it crosses Camp Pendleton Marine Corps Base. It enters the Gulf of Santa Catalina on the Pacific approximately northwest of Oceanside.

Draining , the Santa Margarita Watershed is the second largest river basin on the Southern California coastal plain. The upper watershed consists of the Murrieta Creek subwatershed and the Temecula Creek subwatershed. Although there are two dams in the upper watershed, both dams must release water that roughly corresponds to natural flows in the tributaries that they are on. As a result, the flow of water in the Santa Margarita River is very close to what it would be in the absence of those two dams.

Below the confluence of Murrieta and Temecula Creeks, the primary tributaries of the Santa Margarita River mainstem are Rainbow Creek on the left (headingdownstream) and Sandia Creek and De Luz Creeks on the right. The two latter creeks drain the Santa Rosa Plateau.

==Conservation and ecology==
Approximately of the middle course of the Santa Margarita River in Temecula Canyon are managed by San Diego State University as the Santa Margarita Ecological Reserve, a collaboration of the Bureau of Land Management, California Department of Fish and Wildlife and The Nature Conservancy. The Nature Conservancy has identified and continues to acquire land along the river for conservation. Downstream from the Ecological Preserve the river flows through lands owned by the Fallbrook Public Utility District, and empties into the Ocean through the largely undisturbed lands of Camp Pendleton. Thus the mainstem flows through undeveloped, protected lands. The river has unusual habitats with the upper mainstem one of the few remaining natural gorge rivers in Southern California and the lower mainstem has expansive riparian strips, some up to across.

Approximately 70 species of special concern (rare, threatened, or endangered) regularly inhabit the watershed, including 30 that are currently protected under the Endangered Species Act. Two federally endangered riparian birds are the least Bell&#x27;s vireo (&quot;Vireo bellii pusillus&quot;) and the southwestern willow flycatcher (&quot;Emmpidonax traillii extimus&quot;)), both of which require riparian habitat for breeding success.

Major fishes in the Santa Margarita River include the rainbow trout (&quot;Oncorhynchus mykiss&quot;), arroyo chub (&quot;Gila orcuttii&quot;), California killifish (&quot;Fundulus parvipinnis&quot;), striped mullet, longjaw mudsucker, staghorn sculpin. Pacific lamprey (&quot;Entosphenus tridentatus&quot;) recolonized the river in August 2019 for the first time since 1940, the furthest south the species has currently recolonized, south of the previous location in San Luis Obispo which recolonized in 2017. The successful recolonization has been attributed to a rebuilt weir and new fishway at Camp Pendleton which allowed the lamprey to find passage into the river. Aquatic and semi-aquatic mammals include California golden beaver (&quot;Castor canadensis subauratus&quot;), muskrat, raccoon and long-tailed weasel. Contemporary beaver populations survive at the headwaters of the Santa Margarita River at the confluence of Temecula Creek and Murrieta Creek.

Major riparian plants include arroyo, black, narrowleaf, Pacific, and red willow (&quot;Salix spp&quot;); California sycamore (&quot;Platanus racemosa&quot;), Fremont cottonwood (&quot;Populus fremontii&quot;), mulefat (&quot;Baccharis salicifolia&quot;) and White alder (&quot;Alnus rhombifolia&quot;).

<doc id="761665" wikidata="Q215148" url="?curid=761665" title="Friedrich Heinrich von Seckendorff">
<text>Friedrich Heinrich Reichsgraf von Seckendorff (5 July 1673 – 23 November 1763, aged 90) was a Franconian field marshal and diplomat, in the service of the imperial Habsburg monarchy of Austria. Later he served as commander of the Bavarian army and fought Austria.

==Family==

Seckendorff was born in Königsberg, Franconia, into the Seckendorff family of nobility. His father was an official of Saxe-Gotha and his nephew was Veit Ludwig von Seckendorff. He studied law in Jena, Leipzig, and Leyden.

==Early military career==
In 1693, Seckendorff served in the allied army commanded by William III of England, and in 1694 became a cornet in a Gotha cavalry regiment in Austrian pay. 
Leaving the cavalry, he became an infantry officer in the service of Venice, and in 1697 in that of the Margrave of Ansbach, who in 1698 transferred the regiment in which Seckendorff was serving to the Imperial army.
He served under Prince Eugene of Savoy in the Great Turkish War.

In 1699, Seckendorff married and returned to Ansbach as a court officer, but the outbreak of the War of the Spanish Succession called him into the field again as lieutenant-colonel of an Ansbach regiment, which was taken into the Dutch service. During the War of the Spanish Succession, Seckendorff led Ansbach&#x27;s regiment and, at the head of his dragoons, conquered 16 standards in the Battle of Blenheim. Promoted to &quot;Oberst&quot;, Seckendorff participated in the battles of Ramillies and Oudenaarde and the siege of Ryssel.

Disappointed with his lack of promotion in the Netherlands and Austria, Seckendorff entered the service of King Augustus II of Poland as a &quot;Generalmajor&quot; and commanded the king&#x27;s auxiliary Saxon troops in Flanders, fighting in the siege of Tournai and the battle of Malplaquet. 
As the Polish envoy to the Hague, he participated in the negotiations of the 1713 Treaty of Utrecht; in the same year he suppressed an insurrection in Poland. As a lieutenant general, Seckendorff commanded Saxon troops in the 1715 siege of Stralsund against King Charles XII of Sweden.

Seckendorff reentered imperial service as a &quot;Feldmarschallleutnant&quot; in 1717. Under the command of Eugene of Savoy, Seckendorff led two Ansbach regiments against the Ottoman Turks at Belgrade. In 1718 he successfully fought against Spain in Sicily. Granted the title of &quot;Reichsgraf&quot; in 1719, Seckendorff was appointed &quot;Feldzeugmeister&quot; two years later.

==Diplomacy==
In 1726, at the instance of Eugene of Savoy, Seckendorff became the imperial ambassador at the Prussian court in Berlin. 
He gained the trust of King Frederick William I of Prussia; king and diplomat had fought alongside one another in the War of the Spanish Succession. Seckendorff also bribed the minister of state, the influential Friedrich Wilhelm von Grumbkow, with an Austrian pension. 
In order to avoid a potential marriage between Crown Prince Frederick and a princess of the House of Hanover that would have allied Prussia and Great Britain, Seckendorff manipulated Frederick William and his son so that the crown prince instead married Elizabeth Christina of Brunswick-Bevern, a marriage more favorable to Austria.

Seckendorff&#x27;s diplomatic skill also led to recognition of the Pragmatic Sanction by the courts of numerous German principalities, Denmark, and the Dutch Republic.

==Later military career==
In 1734, Seckendorff returned to the imperial army and became Governor of Mainz. 
As imperial general of cavalry during the War of the Polish Succession, he led 30,000 troops against the French at Clausen on 20 October 1735. 
In 1737, Emperor Charles VI made Seckendorff commander-in-chief in Hungary, at the same time giving him the baton of &quot;Feldmarschall&quot;. 
Although initially successful in the Austrian-Russian campaign against the Ottomans, he was eventually forced to retreat across the Save River. 
His numerous enemies in Vienna brought about his recall, trial and imprisonment at Graz as punishment for the unsuccessful war.

Empress Maria Theresa released Seckendorff from prison in 1740, but, denied his arrears of pay, he laid down all his Austrian and imperial offices and accepted from the new Holy Roman emperor, Bavarian Charles VII, the rank of field marshal in the Bavarian service. As commander of the Bavarian army, Seckendorff relieved Munich in the War of the Austrian Succession and, by a series of battles in 1743 and 1744, forced the Austrians back into Bohemia, after which he resigned.

Following the death of Charles VII, Seckendorff negotiated a reconciliation between Austria and Bavaria in the Treaty of Füssen on 22 April 1745. Emperor Francis I reaffirmed all of Seckendorff&#x27;s honors, and the diplomat retired to his estate at Meuselwitz in Thuringia. In 1757 the death of his wife, for whom, harsh and unamiable as he was, he had a deep and abiding affection, broke down his already failing health. Frederick the Great directed Prussian hussars to abduct Seckendorff from Meuselwitz in December 1758 during the Seven Years&#x27; War. After spending half a year in detention in Magdeburg, he was exchanged for Moritz of Anhalt-Dessau, who had been captured by Austrians at Hochkirch. Returning to Meuselwitz, Seckendorff died at his estate in 1763.

==Quotes==
Frederick the Great despised Seckendorff, resenting the military diplomat for gaining the trust of Frederick William I and his involvement in the Prussian wedding plans. Regarding Seckendorff, Frederick wrote, &quot;He was sordidly scheming; his manners were crude and rustic; lying had become so much second nature to him that he had lost the use of the truth. He was a usurer who sometimes appeared in the guise of a soldier, and sometimes in that of a diplomat&quot;.

<doc id="761667" wikidata="Q1047834" url="?curid=761667" title="Elaine Marley">
<text>Elaine Marley (from &quot;Escape From Monkey Island&quot; onward called Elaine Marley-Threepwood) is a character in the &quot;Monkey Island&quot; series of graphic adventure video games. Created by Ron Gilbert for LucasArts, the character first appears in &quot;The Secret of Monkey Island&quot; and is one of the core characters in the franchise. Originally conceived as a ruthless island governor, the character evolved during development into the protagonist&#x27;s love interest. While the first two games in the series did not feature voice acting, Elaine was voiced by Alexandra Boyd in &quot;The Curse of Monkey Island&quot; and by Charity James in &quot;Escape from Monkey Island&quot;; Boyd would reprise the role for later entries in the franchise.

Elaine is the governor of the Tri-Island Area, a fictional group of pirate islands in the Caribbean. She is loved by the undead pirate LeChuck, but instead falls in love with hapless protagonist Guybrush Threepwood. She eventually marries Guybrush and relinquishes her gubernatorial responsibilities to her grandfather.

The character has enjoyed positive critical reception. Several sources commended Elaine&#x27;s aberration of the damsel in distress stereotype. Elaine has been ranked on a number of lists regarding the best female characters in the video game industry, and has received praise for her visual design and resilient personality. Critics have also complimented Boyd&#x27;s and James&#x27; voice acting for the character in the later installments of the series, though some expressed disappointment at the character&#x27;s reduced lines in &quot;The Curse of Monkey Island&quot;.

==Character design==
The original script for &quot;The Secret of Monkey Island&quot; called for a character simply named &quot;the Governor&quot;; &quot;Monkey Island&quot; creator Ron Gilbert had envisioned her as a far more ruthless character. The name &quot;Elaine&quot; was created later in development by Dave Grossman, who wrote the final scenes of the game in which protagonist Guybrush Threepwood disrupts the wedding of antagonist LeChuck and the governor. One of Grossman&#x27;s options for gatecrashing the wedding is having Guybrush scream &quot;Elaine!&quot; in a parody of a similar scene in the 1967 film &quot;The Graduate&quot;; Gilbert appreciated the reference, so Elaine was adopted as the governor&#x27;s name. As development on the game further progressed, the character evolved from being a ruthless governor to the player character&#x27;s love interest. When the player talks to a number of characters in &quot;The Secret of Monkey Island&quot;, a close-up portrait of the character is shown. Elaine&#x27;s appearance in this portrait was based on Avril Harrison, an artist working at LucasArts. Gilbert always felt bothered by these close-up portraits, stating that &quot;while they were great art, I never felt they matched the style of the rest of the game&quot;.

In &quot;The Curse of Monkey Island&quot;, Elaine realises that Guybrush is her true love, and marries him. However, Ron Gilbert did not intend for the relationship between the characters to develop in this way, stating that Elaine &quot;never really liked Guybrush and thought of him as more of a little brother&quot;. Gilbert was not involved in the production of &quot;The Curse of Monkey Island&quot;; while thinking that the new development team &quot;did a pretty good job of capturing what &quot;Monkey Island&quot; was about&quot;, the relationship between Elaine and Guybrush &quot;was the thing that bugged [Gilbert] the most about &quot;The Curse of Monkey Island&quot;&quot;.

&quot;The Curse of Monkey Island&quot; was the first &quot;Monkey Island&quot; game to feature voice acting; in it, the part of Elaine Marley was given to British actress Alexandra Boyd. Boyd explains that she got the part of Elaine as she had worked with voice director Darragh O&#x27;Farrell previously; O&#x27;Farrell brought Boyd in to read for the part. Boyd joked that &quot;I figured I got the part because I have red hair like her&quot;. Boyd was not contacted to return as the character for &quot;Escape from Monkey Island&quot;; Elaine was instead voiced by American actress Charity James. Nevertheless, Boyd reprised the role for Telltale Games&#x27; &quot;Tales of Monkey Island&quot; and the later enhanced remakes of the first two games. Boyd was glad to return, stating that the character &quot;is very well written and it’s fun doing all that shouting at LeChuck and Guybrush! Exhausting but fun&quot;. The development of Elaine&#x27;s character was one of Gilbert&#x27;s aims for &quot;Tales of Monkey Island&quot;; Gilbert wanted Elaine to &quot;be better informed and more capable than most of the other characters&quot;. In &quot;Return to Monkey Island&quot;, Ron Gilbert told &quot;Eurogamer&quot; that &quot;We actually had a very, very early incarnation of the game where their relationship was a little bit on rocky ground... they weren&#x27;t divorced, but they were definitely not getting along. But when we did our first play test, man, people hated that! They absolutely hated that&quot;.

===Attributes and depiction===
Elaine is depicted with red hair and green eyes. She wears a variety of pirate clothing consistent with the game&#x27;s Golden Age of Piracy setting. Her appearances in &quot;The Secret of Monkey Island&quot; and &quot;Monkey Island 2: LeChuck&#x27;s Revenge&quot; are in the form of pixel art, with appearances slightly differing between the EGA, Amiga and VGA versions of the games. By &quot;The Curse of Monkey Island&quot;, Elaine is rendered in a cartoon art style by LucasArts artists Larry Ahern and Bill Tiller, although the character&#x27;s choice of clothing remains consistent.

==Appearances==
Elaine Marley debuts in &quot;The Secret of Monkey Island&quot; as the governor of Mêlée Island, on which protagonist Guybrush Threepwood is striving to become a pirate. As governor, she attracts many suitors, one of these being the pirate captain LeChuck. LeChuck&#x27;s ambitions for Elaine&#x27;s hand in marriage form a major part of the franchise&#x27;s plot.

Elaine&#x27;s role is significantly reduced for the sequel &quot;Monkey Island 2: LeChuck&#x27;s Revenge&quot;, though the majority of the story is conveyed by Guybrush to Elaine in the form of a flashback. Between the games, the two have broken off their relationship and Elaine has moved to her governor&#x27;s mansion on Booty Island. When Guybrush appears at the mansion, she presumes he has come to apologize; instead he is looking for a map that belonged to Elaine&#x27;s grandfather. After discovering Guybrush&#x27;s intentions, Elaine is infuriated and refuses to speak to him.

In &quot;The Curse of Monkey Island&quot;, LeChuck&#x27;s efforts to buy Elaine&#x27;s love are again rebuked by Elaine, who is angry at LeChuck for having apparently killed Guybrush, who she realises is the true love of her life. Guybrush attempts to propose to her, but accidentally gives her a cursed ring that turns her to solid gold. Guybrush eventually removes the curse, and the two marry and leave on their honeymoon.

Elaine and Guybrush return to Mêlée Island in &quot;Escape from Monkey Island&quot; from their lengthy honeymoon to find that she has been declared legally dead; as a result, the governorship of the Tri-Island Area is up for election. Elaine and Guybrush must reverse her legal demise.

In &quot;Tales of Monkey Island&quot;, Elaine is once again kidnapped by LeChuck. While events separate Guybrush and Elaine, she befriends the now seemingly unmalicious LeChuck, and helps him return monkeys used for his voodoo spells to their homes. Elaine also attempts, without success, to arbitrate between merpeople with access to a cure for the pox and infected pirates.

In &quot;Return to Monkey Island&quot;, Elaine heads up an anti-scurvy initiative and shadows Guybrush through the game as witness to his misadventures. In the game&#x27;s frame story, an older Elaine visits a theme park with Guybrush and their son, Boybrush.

Outside the &quot;Monkey Island&quot; series, Elaine appears in &quot;Sea of Thieves&quot; as part of the expansion &quot;The Legend of Monkey Island&quot;. Set between &quot;Curse&quot; and &quot;Escape&quot;, while Guybrush and Elaine honeymoon in the Sea of Thieves, LeChuck intercepts and traps them in a dreamworld. Aware of the deception, Elaine departs on her own to find a way to free them.

==Reception==
The character of Elaine Marley has garnered a positive reception from critics within the video game industry. Described by &quot;GameSpot&quot; as the impetus for the whole series, critics lauded Elaine&#x27;s non-conformity to the damsel in distress stereotype. &quot;GameSpot&quot; noted that Elaine is usually much more proficient at escaping trouble &quot;than the so-called hero who comes to save her&quot;, while the video game culture journal &quot;Eludamos&quot; approved of the character for allowing a level of &quot;feminine expression which did not necessary always conform to passive ideals of the damsel in distress&quot;.

In &quot;100 Greatest Video Game Characters&quot;, Elaine is cited as more important than Guybrush due to her pivotal role in the depiction of women in video games. The book highlighted her political power and gender-neutral attire as rare, and mentioned that she subverts the idea of the love interest in video games by being more successful and level-headed than the protagonist, while having her own ambitions. As such, she was compared to Alyx Vance from the &quot;Half-Life&quot; series and Grace Nakamura from &quot;Gabriel Knight&quot;, amongst others.

&quot;IGN India&quot;, &quot;The Guardian&quot;, and &quot;GamesRadar+&quot; all stated that Elaine and Guybrush were one of the best video game couples, &quot;Eurogamer&quot; commended Elaine&#x27;s design as &quot;worthy of acclaim&quot;, naming her the &quot;Best Female Supporting Character&quot; in their 2001 annual Gaming Globes awards, while &quot;IGN&quot; described her alongside Guybrush and LeChuck as one of &quot;the most beloved adventure characters of all time&quot;. Alexandra Boyd and Charity James too have been praised for their voicing of Elaine; &quot;Computer Games Magazine&quot; described Boyd&#x27;s work for &quot;The Curse of Monkey Island&quot; as &quot;wonderful&quot;, though lamented that she did not speak more in the game, while &quot;Macworld&quot; admired the character&#x27;s depiction in &quot;Escape from Monkey Island&quot; as &quot;beautiful and plucky&quot;. &quot;TheGamer&quot; lamented Elaine&#x27;s perceived tonal shift in &quot;Return to Monkey Island&quot;, saying that she was &quot;Elaine in name and appearance only&quot;, and had been &quot;demoted&quot; to a background role.

<text>The Ocean Drilling Program (ODP) was a multinational effort to explore and study the composition and structure of the Earth&#x27;s oceanic basins, running from 1985 to 2004. ODP was the successor to the Deep Sea Drilling Project initiated in 1968 by the United States. ODP was an international effort with contributions of Australia, Canada, Germany, France, Japan, the United Kingdom and the ESF Consortium for Ocean Drilling (ECOD) including 12 further countries. The program used the drillship &quot;JOIDES Resolution&quot; on 110 expeditions (legs) to collect about 2,000 deep sea cores from major geological features located in the ocean basins of the world. Drilling discoveries led to further questions and hypotheses, as well as to new disciplines in earth sciences such as the field of paleoceanography.

In 2004 ODP transformed into the Integrated Ocean Drilling Program (IODP).

<text>The London Encyclopaedia, first published in 1983, is a 1,100-page historical reference work on London, the capital city of the United Kingdom, covering the whole of the Greater London area.

==Development==
The first edition of the encyclopaedia was compiled over a number of years by the antiquarian bookseller Ben Weinreb and the historian Christopher Hibbert. Revised editions were published in 1993, 1995 and 2008. It has around 5,000 articles, supported by two indices, one general and one listing people, each with about 10,000 entries, and is published by Macmillan.

In 2012, an app was developed by Heuristic-Media and released as &quot;London—A City Through Time&quot;. Toby Evetts and Simon Reeves, partners in Heuristic-Media, discussed the development of the app with &quot;The Guardian&quot; in 2013, describing how 4,500 entries had to be plotted onto a guide map by hand.

==Antecedents==
The encyclopaedia builds on a number of earlier publications, including:

*&quot;Survey of London&quot; by John Stow, 1598.
*&quot;The Survey of London&quot; — a multi-volume publication originated in 1894 by Charles Robert Ashbee, adopted first by the London County Council, then the Greater London Council, and now domiciled with English Heritage.
*&quot;Handbook for London&quot; by Peter Cunningham, 1849.
*&quot;London Past and Present&quot; by Wheatley and Peter Cunningham, 1891.

<doc id="761678" wikidata="Q1717977" url="?curid=761678" title="Jōseki">
<text>In &quot;go&quot; and &quot;shōgi&quot;, a jōseki or jouseki (&quot;kanji&quot; characters for go, for &quot;shōgi&quot;) is the studied sequences of moves for which the result is considered &quot;balanced&quot; for both black and white sides.

==&quot;Go&quot; &quot;jōseki&quot;==
In &quot;go&quot;, because games typically start with plays in the corners, &quot;go&quot; &quot;jōseki&quot; are usually about corner play as the players try to gain local advantages there in order to obtain a better overall position. Though less common, there are also &quot;jōseki&quot; for the middle game. In Japanese, &quot;jō&quot; () means &quot;fixed&quot; or &quot;set&quot; and &quot;seki&quot; () means stones, giving the literal meaning &quot;set stones&quot;, as in &quot;set pattern&quot;. In Chinese, the term for joseki is &quot;dìngshì&quot; ().

The concept of &quot;balance&quot;, here, often refers to an equitable trade-off between securing territory in the corner versus making good &quot;thickness&quot; toward the sides and the center. In application, these concepts are very dynamic, and, often, deviations from a &quot;jōseki&quot; depend upon the needs of the situation and the available opportunities. While learning &quot;jōseki&quot; is a tool to defend against a local loss, players always seek to take advantage of weaknesses in the opponent&#x27;s shapes, often deviating from the &quot;jōseki&quot;.

=== Using &quot;jōseki&quot; ===
&quot;Jōseki&quot; are not fixed but comprise patterns that have gained acceptance in professional games; they constitute a consensus that may change with certain caveats. Hence, the basic definition may be misleading for new players in that a &quot;jōseki&quot; can be misconstrued as foolproof and unalterable and as optimal for all situations. Many &quot;jōseki&quot; are in fact useful only for study within an artificially confined corner, and in real play are only considered good form when used in proper combination with other plays on the board (i.e. other &quot;jōseki&quot; and &quot;fuseki&quot; moves). 

Knowing a particular &quot;jōseki&quot; simply means that one knows a sequence of moves, resulting in a balance or fair trade-off between black and white positions. This is in practice much easier than appraising how &quot;jōseki&quot; relate to the rest of the board – hence, &quot;knowledge of jōseki&quot; is regarded as shallow, when compared with the ability to integrate a strategy into a complex game landscape.

One go proverb states that &quot;learning &quot;jōseki&quot; loses two stones in strength,&quot; which means that the rote learning of sequences is not advantageous; rather, learning &quot;from&quot; a &quot;jōseki&quot; should be a player&#x27;s goal. Hence, the study of &quot;jōseki&quot; is regarded as a double-edged sword and useful only if learned by understanding the principles behind each move, instead of by rote. Every &quot;jōseki&quot; should be used as a specific tool that leaves the board in a particular shape. 
Just as using an improper tool in machinery can be devastating, choosing the wrong &quot;jōseki&quot; can easily be worse than improvising one&#x27;s own moves. In his book &quot;A Way of Play for the 21st Century&quot;, Go Seigen compared choosing the proper &quot;jōseki&quot; to choosing the proper medicine: &quot;Pick the right one, and you feel better. Pick the wrong one, and you die.&quot; Rui Naiwei similarly remarked that &quot;playing &quot;joseki&quot; is easy [but] choosing the right one [in a game] is hard.&quot; [par.]
A &quot;jōseki&quot; may fall out of use for various reasons, some of which may often seem minor to the amateur player; professionals may consider one variation suboptimal for a very specific reason – one which strong amateurs are not likely to exploit. 
There is no definitive guide to what is a &quot;jōseki&quot;; the situation with &quot;jōseki&quot; dictionaries is similar to that of natural language dictionaries: some entries are obsolete, and the list is likely to be incomplete.

=== Basic &quot;jōseki&quot; ===
Corner &quot;jōseki&quot; conventionally start with one player occupying a corner point, in an empty 19×19 area of the board, and the other player replying with an &quot;approach move&quot; (Japanese: &quot;kakari&quot;). The initial play in the corner is almost always on a 3-3, 3-4, 3-5, 4-4 or 4-5 point. Other plays that have been experimented with include 5-5, 6-3 and 6-4, all of which sacrifice territory for influence.

Of those plays, the classical 3-4 point (&quot;komoku&quot;) and more contemporary 4-4 point (&quot;hoshi&quot;) are the most used. The standard approaches are at 5-3 or 5-4 to the 3-4 point, and at 3-6/6-3 to the 4-4 point. The number of subsequent variations is then quite large (of the order of ten reasonable plays for the next one). Recently, some 3-3 invasion josekis became popular after it was used successfully by the AlphaGo series of models, such as the flying knife joseki. 

Breaking away from a sequence to play elsewhere (&quot;tenuki&quot;) before the conventional endpoint of the &quot;jōseki&quot; is not uncommon in higher level play. There is no formal theory for follow-up plays after &quot;jōseki&quot;, though numerous set sequences can be seen in professional play.

It is imperative that players should not play a &quot;jōseki&quot; merely from rote memorization but adapt according to the overall board situation. It is important to keep in mind that go is a game involving marginal analysis and &quot;jōseki&quot; are merely heuristics of sound play. Playing &quot;jōseki&quot; blindly will not improve one&#x27;s game.

== &quot;Jōseki&quot; in shogi ==
In shogi, typically the beginning of the games (序盤 &quot;joban&quot;) consists of a number of relatively fixed series of moves for both players&quot;.&quot; This standard sequence of moves or a jōseki (spelled 定跡, unlike in &quot;go&quot; where they are spelled ) refers to especially recommended sequences of moves for a given opening that lead to a balanced play for both sides. These sequences of moves are considered to be the best for a particular opening from the start of the game to the start of a full-scale battle, and are often recommended to amateur players to be able to master basic strategy. Jōsekis are typically developed by professional players as a result of their individual research and actual games. Jōsekis change continuously, some even becoming obsolete when they are reevaluated to no longer end up in a balanced play. 

Examples of jōsekis in shogi include the Saginomiya joseki, the Kimura joseki, and the Yamada joseki.

<text>Cognitive neuropsychiatry is a growing multidisciplinary field arising out of cognitive psychology and neuropsychiatry that aims to understand mental illness and psychopathology in terms of models of normal psychological function. A concern with the neural substrates of
impaired cognitive mechanisms links cognitive neuropsychiatry to the basic neuroscience. Alternatively, CNP provides a way of uncovering normal psychological processes by studying the effects of their change or impairment.

The term &quot;cognitive neuropsychiatry&quot; was coined by Prof Hadyn Ellis (Cardiff University ) in a paper &quot;The cognitive neuropsychiatric origins of the Capgras delusion&quot;, presented at the International Symposium on the Neuropsychology of Schizophrenia, Institute of Psychiatry, London (Coltheart, 2007).

Although clinically useful, current syndrome classifications (e.g. DSM-IV; ICD-10) have no empirical basis as models of normal cognitive processes. CNP moves beyond diagnosis and classification to offer a cognitive explanation for established psychiatric behaviours, regardless of whether the symptoms are due to recognised brain pathology or to dysfunction in brain areas or networks without structural lesions.

CNP has been influential, not least because of its early success in explaining some psychiatric delusions, most notably the Capgras delusion, Fregoli delusion and other delusional misidentification syndromes. The Capgras delusion is &quot;explained as the interruption in the covert route to face recognition, namely affective responses to familiar stimuli, localized in the dorsal route of vision from striate cortex to limbic system. According to standard molecular hypotheses, acute delusions are the result of a dysregulated activity of some neuromodulators.&quot;

Additionally, the study of cognitive neuropsychiatry has shown to intersect with the study of philosophy. This intersection revolves around a reconsideration of the mind-body relationship and the contemplation of moral issues that can arise by fields such as neuropsychopathology. For example, it has been under consideration whether or not Parkinson&#x27;s patients should be held morally accountable for their physical actions. This discussion and study has taken place due to the discovery that under certain circumstances, Parkinson&#x27;s patients can initiate and control their own movement. Examples such as this are cause for difficult judgement calls, i.e. &quot;about who is mad and who is bad&quot; (Stein 1999). Cognitive neuropsychiatry has also explored the difference between implicit and explicit cognition, especially in catatonic patients. For more information on the bridge between neuropsychiatry and philosophy see (e.g., Stein, Dan (1999). Philosophy, Psychiatry, &amp; Psychology).

<doc id="761711" wikidata="Q263381" url="?curid=761711" title="Soviet aircraft carrier Ulyanovsk">
<text>Ulyanovsk (), Soviet designation Project 1143.7, was a fixed-wing aircraft carrier laid down on 25 November 1988 as the first of a class of Soviet nuclear-powered supercarriers. It was intended for the first time to offer true blue water naval aviation capability for the Soviet Navy. The ship would have been equipped with steam catapults that could launch fully loaded aircraft, representing a major advance over the , which could only launch less-loaded aircraft from their ski-jumps. However, construction of &quot;Ulyanovsk&quot; was stopped at about 40% after the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991.

== History ==

=== Background ===
The Soviet Union&#x27;s Nevsky Engineering Design Bureau developed the third-generation heavy aircraft cruiser &quot;Kuznetsov&quot; with Su-33 in the 1980s (Plan 1143.5/Order 105) and the &quot;Varyag&quot; aircraft carrier (Plan 1143.6/Order 106), at the same time, in December 1984, the construction of the fourth-generation large-scale nuclear-powered heavy aircraft cruiser began. The plan number was &quot;Plan 1143.7&quot;, and the preliminary design was completed in 1986. On November 25, 1988, construction for &quot;Order 107&quot; ― named &quot;Ulyanovsk&quot; ― officially began at the Black Sea Shipyard.

To this end, the Soviet government allocated funds to carry out the second large-scale technical transformation of the Black Sea Shipyard, including:

* the construction of an assembly and welding workshop, allowing the hull to be increased in sections to 200 tons;
* a 350-ton self-propelled flatbed truck;
* a transport lane from the new workshop to the slipway;
* the length of No. 0 slipway was lengthened by 30 meters;
* a horizontal slipway-side platform with a total weight of 1,700 tons;
* installing a slipway and slipway-side platform;
* two new gantry cranes each with a lifting capacity of 900 tons, and other new cranes, bringing the number of cranes used on the entire slipway to ten; 
* a river channel to ensure that the &quot;Ulyanovsk&quot; would be able to go to sea in the future.

=== Ending ===
Due to the dissolution of the Soviet Union, the amount of funding to complete the carrier was insufficient, and the aircraft carrier construction plan was suspended. As of November 1991, Ulyanovsk was only 40% complete.

The No. 2 ship &quot;Plan 1143.8&quot; originally planned to be built was also cancelled at the same time.

==Design==
&quot;Ulyanovsk&quot; was based upon the 1975 Project 1153 Orel, which did not get beyond blueprints. The initial commissioned name was to be &quot;Kremlin&quot;, but was later given the name &quot;Ulyanovsk&quot; after the Soviet city of Ulyanovsk, which was originally named Simbirsk but later renamed after Vladimir Lenin&#x27;s original name because he was born there.

It would have been 85,000 tonnes in displacement (larger than the older carriers but smaller than contemporary of the U.S. Navy). &quot;Ulyanovsk&quot; would have been able to launch the full range of fixed-wing carrier aircraft, as it was equipped with two catapults as well as a ski jump. The configuration would have been very similar to U.S. Navy carriers though with the typical Soviet practice of adding anti-ship missile (ASM) and surface-to-air missile (SAM) launchers. Its hull was laid down in 1988, but construction was cancelled at 40% complete in January 1991 and a planned second unit was never laid down.

In accordance with Decree No. 69-R of February 4, 1992, signed by the First Deputy Prime Minister of Ukraine Kostyantyn Masyk, on February 5, 1992, scrapping of the ship&#x27;s hull structures began. By October 29, 1992, the slipway was free, and the ship (order 107) had ceased to exist.

==Air group==

The &quot;Ulyanovsk&quot; air group was to include 68 aircraft with the following planned composition:

* 44 fighter aircraft, combination of Sukhoi Su-33 (Su-27K) and Mikoyan MiG-29K fighters
* 6 Yakovlev Yak-44 RLD airborne early warning aircraft
* 16 Kamov Ka-27 anti-submarine warfare helicopters
* 2 Ka-27PS air-sea rescue helicopters

The ship was equipped with two &quot;Mayak&quot; steam catapults made by the Proletarian Factory in Leningrad, a ski-jump, and four arresting gear. For storing aircraft, it had a 175×32×7.9-m hangar deck with aircraft elevated to the flight deck by 3 elevators with carrying capacities of 50 tons (two on the starboard side and one on the port). The stern housed the &quot;Luna&quot; optical landing guidance system.

<text>Jane Draycott [[Royal Society of Literature|FRSL]] is a British poet, artistic collaborator and poetry translator. She was born in London in 1954 and studied at King&#x27;s College London and the University of Bristol. 
Draycott&#x27;s fifth collection &quot;The Kingdom&quot; was published in 2023 by Carcanet Press.

==Teaching==
Draycott teaches as Senior Associate Tutor on Oxford University&#x27;s MSt in Creative Writing, and until 2022 was Senior Lecturer in the Department of English and Creative Writing at Lancaster University as well as a mentor on the Crossing Borders creative writing initiative, set up by the British Council and Lancaster University. In addition to her work at Oxford and Lancaster, she was Royal Literary Fund Fellow at Oxford Brookes University 2004-06, as well as at Aston University in 2010-12 and Royal Holloway University of London 2021-22. In 2014-16 she was a Royal Literary Fund [RLF] Lector, becoming an Advisory Fellow in 2018 and appointed as an RLF Associate Fellow in 2022.

==Translation, work in Dutch==
Draycott&#x27;s translation work includes a poetic version of the 14th century elegy &quot;Pearl&quot; - a Stephen Spender Prize-winner in 2008 - and a collection of new translations of the 20th century artist and poet Henri Michaux &quot;Storms Under the Skin&quot; (a Poetry Book Society Recommended Translation) published in 2017 by Two Rivers Press. In 2013, Draycott was Writer-in-Residence hosted by the Dutch Foundation for Literature in Amsterdam, researching poet Martinus Nijhoff&#x27;s modernist Dutch narrative &quot;Awater&quot;.

==Audio, Music==
Draycott was previously poet in residence at Henley&#x27;s River and Rowing Museum, creating a millennium archive of audio interviews with the men and women working on the London Thames. She has recorded a number of her poems for The Poetry Archive and is one of the poets featured in the national &quot;Poetry By Heart&quot; anthology.

Settings to music of Draycott&#x27;s poems have included a setting for the award-winning choir Tenebrae by composer Joanna Marsh of &#x27;In Winter&#x27;s House&#x27; (originally commissioned as part of laureate Carol Ann Duffy&#x27;s &#x27;Carols for Christmas&#x27; for &quot;The Guardian&quot; December 2010), premiered at the Wigmore Hall in December 2019.

==Literary Collaborations, Film==
Her collaborative work includes two collections from Two Rivers Press: &quot;Christina the Astonishing&quot; (1992), co-written with poet Lesley Saunders and illustrated by artist Peter Hay; and &quot;Tideway&quot; (2002), a sequence of poems written as part of a project with photographer Jaap Oepkes, documenting the lives of London&#x27;s Company of Thames Watermen and women, with artworks by artist Peter Hay (both collections republished in 2022 in the &quot;Two Rivers Classics&quot; series). Her poem from this collection, &#x27;No. 3 from &quot;Uses for the Thames&quot;&#x27;, was shortlisted for the 2002 Forward Prize for Best Single Poem and features in the Poems on the Underground 2016 series &#x27;London is Open&#x27;.

Other collaborative work includes several award-winning sound-compositions with poet Elizabeth James (&quot;Sea Green I and II&quot; - winner of BBC Radio 3 Poem for Radio 1998; &quot;A Glass Case&quot; for BBC R3 &quot;Between the Ears&quot; (1999), produced by Susan Roberts; and &quot;Rock Music&quot; for LBC radio, winner of a London Sound Art Award 2000, produced by Richard Shannon).

In 2010, Draycott was part of Simon Barraclough&#x27;s &quot;Psycho Poetica&quot;, a collaborative multi-media event launched at the British Film Institute for the 50th anniversary of Alfred Hitchcock&#x27;s seminal thriller, and in 2013 was one of ten poets commissioned by Barraclough for his BFI collaborative project &quot;Poets on Pasolini: A New Decameron&quot;. Her poem &#x27;Who keeps observance in the fever room?&#x27; from Julia Bird&#x27;s 2015
&quot;Beginning to See the Light&quot; event at London&#x27;s South Bank has been made into a film by filmmaker Corinne Silva.

==Poetry prizes, Honours, Adjudication==
Draycott&#x27;s debut poetry pamphlet &quot;No Theatre&quot; (Smith/Doorstop, 1997) was shortlisted for the Forward Prize for Best First Collection, and her first full collection &quot;Prince Rupert&#x27;s Drop&quot; (OUP and Carcanet Press, 1999) was shortlisted two years later for the Forward Prize for Best Collection.

In 2002 she was the winner of the Keats-Shelley Prize for Poetry with the title poem of her second collection, The Night Tree, and in 2004 she was nominated as one of the Poetry Book Society&#x27;s &#x27;Next Generation&#x27; poets. In 2009, her collection &quot;Over&quot; was nominated for the T S Eliot Prize, and in 2016 her next collection &quot;The Occupant&quot; was selected as a Poetry Book Society Recommendation.

Draycott has served on judging panels for a number of literary prizes, including the T S Eliot Prize, the Society of Authors&#x27; Vondel Prize for translation, the Edward Thomas Prize, The Troubadour International Poetry Prize, the Tower Poetry Competition (Christ Church Oxford), and all three of the UK Poetry Society&#x27;s National Poetry Competition, Foyles Young Poets Awards, and Geoffrey Dearmer Prize.

In 2020 Draycott was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Literature and in 2023 was awarded a Society of Authors Cholmondeley Award.

<doc id="761725" wikidata="Q147824" url="?curid=761725" title="Picea omorika">
<text>Picea omorika, commonly known as the Pančić spruce or Serbian spruce (, ), is a species of coniferous tree endemic to the Drina River valley in western Serbia, and eastern Bosnia and Herzegovina, with a total range of only about 60 ha, at altitude. It was originally discovered near the Serbian village of Zaovine, on Mount Tara, in 1875, and named by the Serbian botanist Josif Pančić; the specific epithet is simply the Serbian word for the tree. (All other spruces are .)

== Description ==
It is a medium-sized evergreen tree growing to tall, exceptionally , with a trunk diameter of up to . The shoots are buff-brown, and densely pubescent (hairy). The leaves are needle-like, 10–20 mm long, flattened in cross-section, dark blue-green above, and blue-white below. The cones are long, fusiform (spindle-shaped, broadest in the middle), dark purple (almost black) when young, maturing dark brown 5–7 months after pollination, with stiff scales.

== Cultivation ==
Outside its native range, Serbian spruce is of major importance as an ornamental tree in large gardens, valued in northern Europe and North America for its very attractive crown form and ability to grow on a wide range of soils, including alkaline, clay, acid and sandy soil, although it prefers moist, drained loam.

It is also grown to a small extent in forestry for Christmas trees, timber and paper production, particularly in northern Europe, though its slow growth makes it less important than Sitka spruce or Norway spruce. In cultivation, it has produced hybrids with the closely related black spruce &quot;P. × Machala&quot; and also with Sitka spruce.

=== AGM cultivars ===
The following cultivars have gained the Royal Horticultural Society&#x27;s Award of Garden Merit: 

* &quot;Picea omorika&quot; &#x27;Nana&#x27; – a dwarf form
* &quot;Picea omorika&quot; &#x27;Pendula&#x27; – a weeping form

== Ecology ==
Because of its limited range, it is not a major source of nutrition to wildlife, but does provide cover for birds and small mammals. Prior to the Pleistocene ice ages, it had a much larger range throughout most of Europe.

George Fenton was born in 1949 in Bromley, Kent, one of five siblings. He was educated at Carn Brea School and St. Edward&#x27;s School, Oxford. He began learning the guitar at the age of 8 and at St. Edwards studied the organ with Peter Whitehouse. He did not attend music college but continued to study with Pete Whitehouse and subsequently with the ethnomusicologist and composer, John Leach.

In 1968 he appeared in Alan Bennett&#x27;s first West End play &quot;Forty Years On&quot;. The following year he was offered a place at the Central School of Speech and Drama but had by then decided to continue with his music and had a record contract with MCA Records. For the next few years, he continued to work in theatre playing small parts and playing and writing music.

== Theatre ==
In 1974, Fenton received his first major commission, as composer and musical director for Peter Gill&#x27;s theatre production of &quot;Twelfth Night&quot; by the Royal Shakespeare Company in Stratford-upon-Avon.

Throughout the rest of the 1970s and early 1980s, Fenton worked frequently as a composer for theatre productions. He continued to collaborate regularly with Peter Gill (composing for 9 of his productions) and also worked in regional theatre as well as for the Royal Shakespeare Company and The National Theatre.

Other theatre includes &quot;The Judas Kiss&quot;, &quot;Last Cigarette&quot;, &quot;Untold Stories&quot;, &quot;Allelujah!&quot;, &quot;Mrs Henderson Presents&quot;, &quot;Buffalo Bill&#x27;s Wild West Show&quot;, &quot;Talking Heads&quot;, &quot;Beat The Devil&quot; and &quot;Racing Demon&quot;.

In 1992, George Fenton was credited with the Sound Track to the Buffalo Bill&#x27;s Wild West Show at Disneyland, Paris.

== Television drama ==
Fenton wrote his first television score in 1976. This was a continuation of his collaboration with Peter Gill and it was for Gill&#x27;s production of &quot;Hitting Town&quot; written by Stephen Poliakoff.

By the late 1970s, Fenton was working regularly in television. His television work has included the regular role of soldier Martin Gimbel in Emmerdale Farm (1975-1976), LWT&#x27;s &quot;Six Plays&quot; by Alan Bennett, &quot;Objects Of Affection&quot;, &quot;An Englishman Abroad&quot;, &quot;Talking Heads&quot; (2003), &quot;Bloody Kids&quot;, &quot;Going Gently&quot;, &quot;Walter&quot;, &quot;Saigon: Year of The Cat&quot;, &quot;Fox&quot;, &quot;Out,&quot; &quot;Telling Tales&quot;, &quot;The History Man (TV series)&quot;, &quot;Shoestring (TV series)&quot;, &quot;The Monocled Mutineer&quot; and the multi BAFTA winning &quot;The Jewel In The Crown&quot;.

==Wildlife television documentaries==
Fenton has composed for a number of notable wildlife television programmes, often collaborating with the wildlife broadcaster David Attenborough and the nature documentary filmmaker Alastair Fothergill. He started on the BBC&#x27;s long-running series &quot;Wildlife on One&quot; and &quot;Natural World&quot;.

Since 1990, he has written the music for a number of wildlife series including &quot;The Trials of Life&quot;, &quot;Life in the Freezer&quot;, &quot;The Blue Planet&quot;, &quot;Planet Earth&quot;, and &quot;Frozen Planet&quot;. Other documentaries include &quot;Beyond The Clouds&quot;, &quot;Shanghai Vice&quot; and &quot;Between Clouds and Dreams&quot; (for Director Phil Agland).

In 2003, he composed and conducted the music for the feature documentary film, &quot;Deep Blue&quot;. It was performed by the Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra – the first film score the orchestra had recorded in its history. In 2007 they repeated the collaboration for the feature documentary film, &quot;Earth&quot;.

In 2022 George partnered up with Alastair Fothergill and David Attenborough again, this time for BBC One’s Wild Isles series.

==Television and radio themes==
Fenton has composed the jingles or theme music to dozens of British television and radio programs, including &quot;Shoestring&quot;, &quot;Bergerac&quot;, &quot;One O&#x27;Clock News&quot;, &quot;Six O&#x27;Clock News&quot; and &quot;Nine O&#x27;Clock News&quot;, &quot;Newsnight&quot; and &quot;Newsnight Review&quot;, &quot;On the Record&quot;, &quot;Omnibus&quot;, &quot;BBC Breakfast Time&quot;, &quot;BBC World News&quot;, &quot;Reporting Scotland&quot;, &quot;London Plus&quot;, &quot;Telly Addicts&quot;, &quot;Daily Politics&quot;, and BBC Radio 4&#x27;s &quot;PM&quot; programme.

==Feature films==
Fenton has written the music for over one hundred feature films.

His first major break came in 1982 with Richard Attenborough&#x27;s biopic &quot;Gandhi&quot;, for which he was nominated—with his collaborator, Ravi Shankar for the Academy Award for Original Music Score. Fenton wrote another four film scores for Attenborough&#x27;s films: &quot;Cry Freedom&quot;, &quot;Shadowlands&quot;, &quot;In Love and War&quot; and &quot;Grey Owl&quot;.

He has also frequently worked with the theatre and film director Nicholas Hytner, writing the score for all six of the movies that Hytner has directed. These are &quot;The Madness of King George&quot;, &quot;The Crucible&quot;, &quot;The Object of My Affection&quot;, &quot;Center Stage&quot;, &quot;The History Boys&quot; and &quot;The Lady in the Van&quot;. The latter three of these allowed Fenton to collaborate again with their writer Alan Bennett. Although Fenton composed the original music of five of these films, for &quot;The Madness of King George&quot; he instead adapted and arranged the music of Handel.

Fenton&#x27;s long-standing collaboration with Stephen Frears has not been limited to television productions. Fenton has scored four of Frear&#x27;s feature films: &quot;Dangerous Liaisons&quot;, &quot;Hero&quot;, &quot;Mary Reilly&quot; and &quot;Mrs Henderson Presents&quot;. He also worked with the director Neil Jordan, scoring &quot;The Company of Wolves&quot;, &quot;High Spirits&quot; and &quot;We&#x27;re No Angels&quot;.

Fenton has scored more feature films for Ken Loach than for any other filmmaker, by 2023, a total of 18. This started in 1994 with &quot;Ladybird, Ladybird&quot; followed by &quot;Land and Freedom&quot;, &quot;Carla&#x27;s Song&quot;, &quot;My Name Is Joe&quot;, &quot;Bread and Roses&quot;, &quot;The Navigators&quot;, &quot;Sweet Sixteen&quot;, &quot;Ae Fond Kiss...&quot;, &quot;The Wind That Shakes the Barley&quot; which won the Palme d&#x27;Or at the 2006 Cannes Film Festival, &quot;It&#x27;s a Free World...&quot;, &quot;Looking for Eric&quot;, &quot;The Angels&#x27; Share&quot;, the documentary film &quot;The Spirit of &#x27;45&quot;, &quot;Jimmy&#x27;s Hall&quot;, &quot;I, Daniel Blake&quot; and, most recently, &quot;Sorry We Missed You&quot; and the forthcoming &quot;The Old Oak&quot;.

Fenton has developed other long-standing collaborations with filmmakers, scoring several films each for directors as diverse as Harold Ramis, Nora Ephron, Phil Joanou and Andy Tennant, including &quot;Multiplicity&quot;, &quot;Groundhog Day&quot;, &quot;Mixed Nuts&quot;, &quot;You&#x27;ve Got Mail&quot;, &quot;Final Analysis&quot;, &quot;The Fisher King&quot;, &quot;Heaven&#x27;s Prisoners&quot;, &quot;Ever After: A Cinderella Story&quot;, &quot;Sweet Home Alabama (film)&quot;, &quot;Anna and the King&quot;, &quot;Hitch&quot;, &quot;Bewitched&quot; and &quot;The Secret: Dare to Dream&quot; and Andy Tennant&#x27;s new thriller &quot;Unit 234&quot;.

== Live ==
Fenton won an Ivor Novello Award, BAFTA and Emmy Award for Best Television Score for &quot;The Blue Planet&quot; and, in October 2002, he created &quot;The Blue Planet in Concert&quot; which was premiered at the Royal Festival Hall in London. He subsequently created Planet Earth In Concert and Frozen Planet In Concert and took these concerts to venues such as Hollywood Bowl, Sydney Opera House, Wembley Arena and the Ziggo Dome in Amsterdam.

In 2003, he scored and conducted the music for the documentary film &quot;Deep Blue&quot;, which was performed by the Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra, the first film score the orchestra had recorded in its history. In 2007, they repeated the collaboration for the documentary film, &quot;Earth&quot;. With the producer Jane Carter, Fenton turned each of the scores into concert works. His live film scores continue to be performed by orchestras worldwide.

<text>Gennadius of Massilia (died c. 496), also known as Gennadius Scholasticus or Gennadius Massiliensis, was a 5th-century Christian priest, monk, and historian.

His best-known work is &quot;De Viris Illustribus&quot; (&quot;Of Famous Men&quot;), a biography of over 90 contemporary significant Christians, which continued a work of the same name by Jerome.

==Life==

Gennadius was a monk and later priest of Massilia (now Marseille), a contemporary of Pope Gelasius I (pope from 492 to 496). Considered by Christopher Blunda to be &quot;one of the most theologically learned figures of his day&quot;, he was familiar with the lives of authors spanning the previous eight decades.

Little is known of his life, except for a brief statement in the last biography he wrote: &quot;I, Gennadius, presbyter of Massilia, wrote eight books against all heresies, five books against Nestorius, ten books against Eutyches, three books against Pelagius, a treatise on the thousand years of the Apocalypse of John, this work, and a letter about my faith sent to blessed Gelasius, bishop of the city of Rome&quot;.

==Writings==

Gennadius knew Greek well and was familiar with Eastern and Western, orthodox and heretical Christian literature. He was a diligent compiler and a competent critic.

===De Viris Illustribus===

&quot;De Viris Illustribus&quot;, in its most commonly accepted form, was probably published c. 495 and contains, in some ten folio pages, short biographies of ecclesiastics between the years 392 and 495. It is an important historical source on the over ninety authors treated therein, and in many cases the only surviving record.

It is a continuation of St. Jerome&#x27;s &quot;De Viris Illustribus&quot;. In that work Jerome had for the first time drawn up a series of 135 short biographies of famous Christians, with lists of their chief writings. It was the first patrology and dictionary of Christian biography, and became very popular. Many people, including a disciple of Jerome named Paterius, wrote similar continuations; Sophronius produced a Greek translation.

It was Gennadius&#x27;s continuation that became most popular and was accepted everywhere as a second part of Jerome&#x27;s work, and was always written (eventually printed) together with his. Gennadius&#x27;s part contains about one hundred lives, modelled closely after those of Jerome. Various edits and reprints do not number them consistently; by Bernoulli, i to xcvii, with some marked as xciib, etc., originally cxxxvi-ccxxxii).

The series is arranged more or less in chronological order, but there are frequent exceptions.

In xc, 92, he says (in one version) that Theodore of Coelesyria (Theodulus) &quot;died three years ago, in the reign of Zeno&quot;. From this Czapla deduces that Gennadius wrote between 491 and 494.

The present form of the text indicates a repeated revision of the entire work. Other people have modified it and added to it without noting the fact—as is usual among medieval writers. Some scholars including Richardson and Czapla consider that chapters xxx (Bishop John II of Jerusalem), lxxxvii (Victorinus), xciii (Caerealis of Africa.), and all the end portion (xcv-ci), are not authentic. There is doubt about parts of the others.

===Other writings===

Gennadius states that he composed a number of other works, most of which are not extant:

*&quot;Adversus omnes hæreses libri viii.&quot;, &quot;Against all heresies&quot; in 8 volumes
*Five books against Nestorius
*Ten books against Eutyches
*Three books against Pelagius
*&quot;Tractatus de millennio et de apocalypsi beati Johannis&quot;, &quot;Treatise on the thousand years and on the Apocalypse of St. John&quot;
*&quot;Epistola de fide&quot;, a &quot;letter of faith&quot; which he sent to Pope Gelasius.
*Works of Evagrius Ponticus and of Timothy Ælurus, translated and restored to their authentic form. These translations are also lost.

===De Ecclesiasticis Dogmatibus===

There is a treatise called &quot;De Ecclesiasticis Dogmatibus&quot; (&quot;Of Church Doctrine&quot;) which was originally attributed to Augustine of Hippo but is now universally attributed to Gennadius. The work was long included among those of St. Augustine.

Some scholars (Carl Paul Caspari, Otto Bardenhewer, Bruno Czapla) think that it is probably a fragment of Gennadius&#x27;s eight books &quot;against all heresies&quot;, apparently the last part, in which, having confuted the heretics, he builds up a positive system.

===Publication===
The &quot;De Viris Illustribus&quot; was edited and published by J. Andreas (Rome, 1468), by J. A. Fabricius in &quot;Bibliotheca ecclesiastica&quot; (Hamburg, 1718), and by E. C. Richardson in &quot;Texte und Untersuchungen&quot;, xiv. (Leipsig, 1896). It also appears with many editions of the works of Jerome.

An English translation by Richardson was produced in the Nicene and Post-Nicene Fathers, 2nd ser, iii. 385–402.

A critical edition of the &quot;Liber de Ecclesiasticis Dogmatibus&quot; under the title &quot;Liber Ecclesiasticorum Dogmatum&quot; was published by C. H. Turner in the &quot;Journal of Theological Studies&quot; vii. (1905), pp. 78–99 at pp. 89–99. Turner&#x27;s introduction reviews a number of previous editions and also provides a survey of manuscript copies that were known to him, including several that he used for the edition.

==Theological Views==

It has been said that Gennadius was of the so-called Semi-Pelagian persuasion, but this terminology was coined in the 16th century and is contested. In &quot;De Viris Illustribus&quot; Semi-Pelagians among the Catholics are warmly praised (Fastidiosus, lvi, p. 80; Cassian, lxi, 81; Faustus of Riez, lxxxv, 89), while full Pelagians (Pelagius himself, xlii, 77; Julian of Eclanum, xlv, 77) are called heretics. Augustinians, however, are also given praise (Augustine of Hippo, xxxviii, 75; Prosper of Aquitaine, lxxxiv, 89), though perhaps somewhat muted. While it is generally accepted that his theological sympathies were with the Semi-Pelagians, there is scholarly disagreement over Gennadius&#x27; position with regard to Augustine. Thomas O&#x27;Loughlin says Gennadius counted Augustine &quot;among the illustrious teachers&quot; and therefore serves as a witness to his positive reception in the generations immediately after his death, whereas Christopher Blunda interprets him as trying to &quot;counteract [Augustine&#x27;s] posthumous ascendance as a doctrinal authority&quot; by dedicating a relatively terse entry to him, praising his piety and learning but ignoring most of his writings, and implying that some of his teachings were erroneous or could lead to confusion.

The Catholic Encyclopedia detects similar Semi-Pelagian tendencies in the treatise &quot;De eccles. dogmatibus&quot;, which is said to be &quot;full of Semipelagianism, either open or implied (original sin carefully evaded, great insistence on free will and denial of predestination, grace as an adjutorium in the mildest form, etc.).&quot; Gennadius considers (like later writers, e.g. Thomas Aquinas) that all men, even those alive at the Second Coming, will have to die. But this conviction, though derived from a widespread patristic tradition, is, he admits, rejected by equally catholic and learned Fathers.

Of the theories concerning the soul of man subsequently known as the creationist and the traducianist views, he espouses the creationist. He will not allow the existence of the spirit as a third element in man besides the body and the soul, but regards it as only another name for the soul.

In &quot;De Ecclesiasticis Dogmatibus&quot;, his views include the following points:

*Heretical baptism is not to be repeated, unless it has been administered by heretics who would have declined to employ the invocation of the Holy Trinity.
*All not under the burden of mortal sin should receive the Eucharist weekly. Such as are should have recourse to public penitence. 
*Private penance may suffice; but even here outward manifestation, such as change of dress, is desirable.
*Daily reception of holy communion he will neither praise nor blame.
*Evil was invented by Satan.
*Though celibacy is rated above matrimony, to condemn marriage is Manichean.
*A twice-married Christian should not be ordained.
*Churches should be called after martyrs, and the relics of martyrs honoured.
*None but the baptized attain eternal life; not even catechumens, unless they suffer martyrdom.
*Penitence thoroughly avails to Christians even at their latest breath.
*Only God knows the secret thoughts of men; Satan can learn them only through observing human actions.
*Marvels might be wrought in the Lord&#x27;s name even by bad men. Men can become holy without such marks.
*The freedom of man&#x27;s will is strongly asserted, but the commencement of all goodness is assigned to divine grace.

The language of Gennadius is here not quite Augustinian; but neither is it Pelagian.

<text>The quantity theory of money (often abbreviated QTM) is a hypothesis within monetary economics which states that the general price level of goods and services is directly proportional to the amount of money in circulation (i.e., the money supply), and that the causality runs from money to prices. This implies that the theory potentially explains inflation. It originated in the 16th century and has been proclaimed the oldest surviving theory in economics.

According to some,the theory was originally formulated by Renaissance mathematician Nicolaus Copernicus in 1517, whereas others mention Martín de Azpilcueta and Jean Bodin as independent originators of the theory. It has later been discussed and developed by several prominent thinkers and economists including John Locke, David Hume, Irving Fisher and Alfred Marshall. Milton Friedman made a restatement of the theory in 1956 and made it into a cornerstone of monetarist thinking.

The theory is often stated in terms of the equation = , where is the money supply, is the velocity of money, and is the nominal value of output or nominal GDP ( itself being a price index and the amount of real output). This equation is known as the quantity equation or the equation of exchange and is itself uncontroversial, as it can be seen as an accounting identity, residually defining velocity as the ratio of nominal output to the supply of money. Assuming additionally that is exogenous, being independently determined by other factors, that is constant, and that is exogenous and under the control of the central bank, the equation is turned into a theory which says that inflation (the change in over time) can be controlled by setting the growth rate of . However, all three assumptions are arguable and have been challenged over time. Output is generally believed to be affected by monetary policy at least temporarily, velocity has historically changed in unanticipated ways because of shifts in the money demand function, and some economists believe the money supply to be endogenously determined and hence not controlled by the monetary authorities.

The QTM played an important role in the monetary policy of the 1970s and 1980s when several leading central banks (including the Federal Reserve, the Bank of England and Bundesbank) based their policies on a money supply target in accordance with the theory. However, the results were not satisfactory, and strategies focusing specifically on monetary aggregates were generally abandoned during the 1980s and 1990s. Today, most major central banks in practice follow inflation targeting by suitably changing interest rates, and monetary aggregates play little role in monetary policy considerations in most countries.

==Origins and development==

=== Before 1900: Early contributions ===

Economic historian Mark Blaug has called the quantity theory of money &quot;the oldest surviving theory in economics&quot;, its origins originating in the 16th century. Nicolaus Copernicus noted in 1517 that money usually depreciates in value when it is too abundant, which is by some historians taken as the first mention of the theory. Robert Dimand in the chapter on the history of monetary economics in &quot;The New Palgrave Dictionary of Economics&quot; identified Martín de Azpilcueta (1536) and Jean Bodin (1568) as the originators of a proper theory usable for explaining the observed quadrupling of prices during the phenomenon known as the Price revolution following the influx of silver from the New World to Europe.

John Locke studied the velocity of circulation, and David Hume in 1752 used the quantity theory to develop his price–specie flow mechanism explaining balance of payments adjustments. Also Henry Thornton, John Stuart Mill and Simon Newcomb among others contributed to the development of the quantity theory.

During the 19th century, a main rival of the quantity theory was the real bills doctrine, which says that the issue of money does not raise prices, as long as the new money is issued in exchange for assets of sufficient value. According to proponents of the real bills doctrine, money supply responded passively in response to money demand. Consequently, there could be no causal influence from money to prices; conversely, the connection ran in the opposite direction: Money demand was determined by income and prices, which were affected by inflation, caused by various real (i.e., non-monetary) reasons.

=== 1900–1950: Fisher, Wicksell, Marshall and Keynes ===

The eminent economist Irving Fisher, building upon work by Newcomb, developed the theory further in what has been called &quot;The Golden Age of the quantity theory&quot;, formalizing the equation of exchange and attempting to measure the velocity of money independently empirically. Fisher insisted on the long-run neutrality of money, but admitted that money was not neutral during transition periods of up to 10 years. Another renowned monetary economist, Knut Wicksell, criticized the quantity theory of money, citing the notion of a &quot;pure credit economy&quot;. Wicksell instead emphasized real shocks as a cause of observed price movements and developed his theory of the natural rate of interest to explain why the monetary authority should stabilize by setting the interest rate rather than the quantity of money – a position that has received renewed attention during the 21st century, exemplified in the influential Taylor rule of monetary policy.

The extremely influential neoclassical economist Alfred Marshall, Professor at Cambridge, expounded the quantity theory in a version which stated that desired cash balances (i.e., money demand) was proportional to nominal income. The proposition is normally written M = kPY, where k is the proportionality factor. This is known as the Cambridge equation, a variant of the quantity theory. As the coefficient k is the reciprocal of V, the income velocity of circulation of money in the equation of exchange, the two versions of the quantity theory are formally equivalent, though the Cambridge variant focuses on money demand as an important element of the theory. 

Marshall&#x27;s disciple John Maynard Keynes extended his monetary analysis in several ways and eventually integrated it into his &quot;General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money&quot;, published in 1936, which formed the cornerstone of the Keynesian Revolution. Keynes accepted the quantity theory in principle as accurate over the long run, but not over the short run, coining in his 1923 book &quot;A Tract on Monetary Reform&quot; the famous sentence, &quot;In the long run, we are all dead&quot;. He emphasized that money demand (or, in his terminology, liquidity preference) depended on the interest rate as well as nominal income, and contended that contrary to contemporaneous thinking, velocity and output were not stable, but highly variable and as such, the quantity of money was of little importance in driving prices. Rather, changes in the money supply could have effects on real variables like output.

At the same time as Keynes personally and his followers which contributed to the resulting theoretical foundation of Keynesian economics in principle recognized a role for monetary policy in stabilizing economic fluctuations over the business cycle, in practice they believed that fiscal policy was more efficient for this purpose, maintaining that changes in interest rates had little effect on demand and output. The Keynesian paradigm came to dominate macroeconomic thinking until the 1970s, assigning little attention to monetary policy.

=== Monetarism ===

However, from the 1950s and increasingly during the 1960s, the Keynesian view was challenged by an initially small, but increasingly influential minority, the monetarists, the intellectual leader of which was Milton Friedman. In response to the Keynesian view of the world, he made a restatement of the quantity theory in 1956 and used it as a cornerstone for monetarist thinking.

Friedman agreed that money could affect output in the short run. Indeed, he believed that monetary policy was much more powerful in this respect than fiscal policy. Together with Anna Schwartz, he wrote in 1963 the influential book &quot;A Monetary History of the United States&quot;, concluding that movements in money explained most of the fluctuations in output, and reinterpreted the Great Depression as the result of a major mistake in American monetary policy, failing to avoid a large contraction in the money supply during the 1930s. 

At the same time, Friedman was sceptical as to the use of active monetary policy to stabilise output, believing that knowledge of the economy was too little to ensure that such policies would improve rather than worsen the situation. Instead, he advocated a simple monetary policy rule of maintaining a steady growth rate in money supply, which would not result in perfect short-run stabilisation, but in accordance with the quantity theory would ensure a steady long-run inflation rate. This came to be the main policy recommendation of the monetarists.
Consequently, the monetarist application of the quantity-theory approach aimed at removing monetary policy as a source of macroeconomic instability by targeting a constant, low growth rate of the money supply. The zenith of monetarist influence came during the late 1970s and the 1980s, after inflation had risen in many countries during the 1970s caused by the 1970s energy crisis, and the fixed exchange rate system among major Western economies known as the Bretton Woods system had been dissolved. In that situation several central banks turned to a money supply target in an attempt to reduce inflation. For instance the U.S. Federal Reserve System led by chairman Paul Volcker announced a money growth target, starting from October 1979. 

The results were not satisfactory, however, because the relationship between monetary aggregates and other macroeconomic variables proved to be rather unstable. Similar results prevailed in other countries. Firstly, the relation between money growth and inflation turned out to be not very tight, even over 10-year periods, and secondly, the relation between the money supply and the interest rate in the short run turned out to be unreliable, too, making money growth an unreliable instrument to affect demand and output. The reason for both problems was frequent shifts in the demand for money during the period, partly because of changes in financial intermediation. This made velocity unpredictable and weakened the link between money and prices implied by the quantity theory. Milton Friedman later acknowledged that direct money supply targeting was less successful than he had hoped. 

==== New classical economists ====

For a third group of post-war macroeconomists beside Keynesians and monetarists, the new classical economists, the quantity theory of money was also a doctrine of fundamental importance, but Robert E. Lucas and other leading new classical economists made serious efforts to specify and refine its theoretical meaning. These theoretical considerations involved serious changes as to the scope of countercyclical economic policy. The new classical model held that even in the short run, monetary policy could not be used to stabilize output as only unexpected changes in money could affect real variables. However, this view did not gain widespread support, failing to be confirmed by empirical tests. Empirically, evidence generally supports that there is a short-run linkage between money and economic activity.

=== After 1990: Decline of money supply targeting ===

Following the difficulties of the 1980s in conducting a satisfactory monetary policy by money supply targeting, most central banks, including the U.S. Federal Reserve, turned away from focusing on monetary aggregates, instead implementing their policies by setting short-term interest rates. Among monetary researchers, the demise of the money supply as a policy variable was recognized and rationalized by Michael Woodford.

From 1990, the new principle of inflation targets as the basis for a country&#x27;s monetary policy gained popularity, starting with New Zealand and eventually spreading to most developed countries. Inflation targeting countries set interest rates to influence economic activity via the monetary transmission mechanism, eventually affecting inflation to fulfill their inflation argets. The communication of inflation targets helps to anchor the public inflation expectations, it makes central banks more accountable for their actions, and it reduces economic uncertainty among the participants in the economy. 

Money supply (M2) for some time remained a leading economic indicator in the United States, but lost its status as such in the Conference Board Leading Economic Index in 2012, after it was ascertained that it had performed poorly as a leading indicator since 1989. Also in the policy making of the European Central Bank from 1999, monetary aggregates, which were initially officially assigned a prominent role as one of two pillars upon which the ECB monetary policy rested, were assigned a graduately more peripheral role among the indicators informing the bank&#x27;s interest rate decisions.

== The equation of exchange ==

In its modern form, the quantity theory builds upon the following definitional relationship, formulated algebraically by Irving Fisher in 1911:
:formula_1
where
:formula_2 is the total amount of money in circulation on average in an economy during the period, say a year.
:formula_3 is the transactions velocity of money, that is the average frequency across all transactions with which a unit of money is spent. This reflects availability of financial institutions, economic variables, and choices made as to how fast people turn over their money.
:formula_4 and formula_5 are the price and quantity of the i-th transaction.
:formula_6 is a column vector of the formula_4, and the superscript T is the transpose operator.
:formula_8 is a column vector of the formula_5.

Mainstream economics accepts a simplification, the equation of exchange, also called the quantity &quot;equation&quot;:
:formula_10
where
:formula_11 is the price level associated with transactions for the economy during the period,
:formula_12 is an index of the real value of aggregate transactions.

The previous equation presents the difficulty that the associated data are not available for all transactions. With the development of national income and product accounts, emphasis shifted to national-income or final-product transactions, rather than gross transactions. Economists may alternatively use a specification where
:formula_13 is the velocity of money in final expenditures or, equivalently, the income velocity of money,
:formula_14 is an index of the real value of final expenditures or, equivalently, income.

As an example, formula_15 might represent currency plus deposits in checking and savings accounts held by the public, formula_14 real output (which equals real expenditure in macroeconomic equilibrium) with formula_17 the corresponding price level, and formula_18 the nominal (money) value of output. In one empirical formulation, velocity was taken to be &quot;the ratio of net national product in current prices to the money stock&quot;.

===From the quantity equation to the quantity theory===

The quantity equation itself as stated above is uncontroversial, as it amounts to an identity or, equivalently, simply a definition of velocity: From the equation, velocity can be defined residually as the ratio of nominal output to the stock of money: formula_19. Developing a theory out of the equation requires assumptions be made about the causal relationships among the four variables in this one equation. The crucial question is to which extent each of these variables is dependent upon the others. Without further restrictions, the equation does not require that a change in the money supply would change the value of any or all of formula_17, formula_14, or formula_18. For example, a 10% increase in formula_15 could be accompanied by a change of 1/(1 + 10%) in formula_13, leaving formula_18 unchanged. 

The quantity &quot;theory&quot; of money consequently goes further, resting in its basic form on three additional assumptions:

# The amount of real output formula_14 is exogenous, being determined by other forces such as available production factors and production technology
# Velocity formula_13 is constant over time
# The supply of money formula_15 is also exogenous and can be controlled by the monetary authority (the central bank). 

Under these three assumptions, there is a causal effect of &quot;M&quot; on &quot;P&quot;, and the central bank, by controlling money supply, will be able to directly control the price level of the economy. Specifically, a constant growth rate in the money stock will lead to a constant inflation rate, as long as real output grows at a constant rate. 

The realism of each of the three assumptions has been debated over time, though, making the prominent monetarist economist David Laidler declare in 1991 that the quantity theory &quot;is always and everywhere controversial&quot;. Firstly, most economists think that output can be affected by e.g. changes in demand including those that originate from monetary (or fiscal) policy in the short run, i.e. at any point in the business cycle, though in the medium and long run the assumption is more warranted. Indeed, the possibility of influencing and mitigating short-run output fluctuations is the basis for the stabilization policies of most central banks in developed countries today. Secondly, there is general agreement that velocity does change over time, and sometimes in unpredictable ways, because of changes in the money demand function; this may e.g. be the consequence of changes in the infrastructure of payment systems. This was considered a major problem during the 1970s and 1980s when several major central banks including the Federal Reserve tried conducting monetary policy following a money supply target. Thirdly, the exogeneity and control by the monetary authority of the money supply is questioned by some economists. James Tobin noted in 1970 that money might be correlated with output because money passively reacts to output. Central banks and consequently monetary bases can be said to react to events in the economy, and most of typical money supply measures are created by private commercial banks who may also be considered to be affected by the general economic atmosphere when carrying out their banking activities.

===Cambridge approach===

Economists Alfred Marshall, A.C. Pigou, and John Maynard Keynes (before he developed his own, eponymous school of thought) associated with Cambridge University, took a slightly different approach to the quantity equation, focusing on money demand instead of money supply. They argued that a certain portion of the money supply will not be used for transactions; instead, it will be held for the convenience and security of having cash on hand. This portion of cash is commonly represented as &quot;k&quot;, a portion of nominal income (formula_29). The Cambridge economists also thought wealth would play a role, but wealth is often omitted for simplicity. The Cambridge equation is thus:

:formula_30

Assuming that the economy is at equilibrium (formula_31), formula_32 is exogenous, and &quot;k&quot; is fixed in the short run, the Cambridge equation is equivalent to the equation of exchange with velocity equal to the inverse of &quot;k&quot;:

:formula_33

The Cambridge version of the quantity equation was used in both Keynes&#x27;s attack on the quantity theory and the Monetarist revival of the theory.

==Evidence==
As restated by Milton Friedman, the quantity theory emphasizes the following relationship of the nominal value of expenditures formula_34 and the price level formula_17 to the quantity of money formula_36:
:formula_37
:formula_38

The plus signs indicate that a change in the money supply is hypothesized to change nominal expenditures and the price level in the same direction (for other variables held constant).

Milton Friedman made an influential case for the theory in his 1956 paper &quot;Studies in the quantity theory of money&quot;. Later, Friedman wrote in 1987 that the empirical regularity of a &quot;connection between substantial changes in the quantity of money and in the level of prices&quot; was perhaps the most-evidenced economic phenomenon on record, adding that &quot;The statistical connection itself, however, tells nothing about direction of influence&quot;. According to Friedman, the short-run relation of a change in the money supply in the past has been relatively more associated with a change in real output formula_14 than the price level formula_17 in (1), but with much variation in the precision, timing, and size of the relation. For the &quot;long&quot;-run, there has been stronger support for (1) and (2) and no systematic association of formula_14 and formula_15.

In a more recent examination of data from 109 countries from 1991 onwards, it was found that inflation and money growth did not exhibit a proportional development; however, excess money growth did act as a predictor of inflation, but the effect during the time period examined was relatively low. 

In 2016, Professor Harald Uhlig and two coauthors looked upon a cross-section of countries in the years 1970-2005. They found that for moderate-inflation countries (defined as countries with average inflation rates below 12%), the direct relationship between average inflation and the growth rate of money was very tenuous at best, though the fit could be improved by correcting for variation in output growth and the opportunity cost of money. They also found that for countries following inflation targeting, the fit of a one-for-one relationship between money growth and inflation was considerably lower than for other countries.

==Mainstream economists&#x27; views==

Though more disputed in the 1970s, decennially-recurrent surveys of members of the American Economic Association have shown that 71% of those questioned agree with the statement: &quot;Inflation is caused primarily by too much growth in the money supply&quot; as of 2021, down from 74% in 2011 and 83% in 2000.

==Criticism by non-mainstream economists==

In the 1860&#x27;s, Karl Marx, agreeing with certain aspects of the theory, critiqued it by arguing that prices are conditioned by the prevailing technical-technological conditions required for the commodity&#x27;s reproduction at the point of exchange, expressed summarily in the first volume of &quot;Capital&quot; while Marx was still abstracting from equalization of general profit-rates (later analyzed in the third volume) as the &quot;socially-necessary labor-time&quot; (SNLT) needed to produce the commodity. The quantity of money was a function of the quantity of commodities to be priced, the prices of commodities themselves, and the velocity of their circulation. Further research on price-determination through monetary expression of labour-time (MELT), and its decomposition into value expression of labour-time (VELT) and monetary expression of value (MEV), is ongoing.

In 1912, Ludwig von Mises agreed with aspects of quantity theory, but criticized its focus on the supply of money without adequately explaining its demand, writing that the theory &quot;fails to explain the mechanism of variations in the value of money&quot;.

In his 1976 book &quot;The Denationalisation of Money&quot;, Friedrich Hayek described the quantity theory of money &quot;as no more than a useful rough approximation to a really adequate explanation&quot;. According to him, the theory &quot;becomes wholly useless where several concurrent distinct kinds of money are simultaneously in use in the same territory.&quot;

<text>The Tornadoes were an American surf band from Redlands, California. They were the second band to receive national airplay with a surf instrumental, after The Marketts, with their song &quot;Bustin&#x27; Surfboards&quot;, released on Aertaun Records in 1962. &quot;Bustin&#x27; Surfboards&quot; has since become a classic and mainstay of the surf genre. One of its distinctions, and appeals, was that the song opened with the sound of an ocean swell that continued throughout the song, thereby creating a sense of being at a beach. The album with the same name was belatedly released on September 20, 1963. The band, however, did not manage to follow up on their success. Their song &quot;Shootin&#x27; Beavers&quot; was banned from airplay because of its suggestive title. The band temporarily changed their name to The Hollywood Tornadoes, because the British band, The Tornados, were charting with the song &quot;Telstar.&quot;

&quot;Bustin&#x27; Surfboards&quot; was included on the &quot;Pulp Fiction&quot; soundtrack in 1994, thereby renewing interest in the band. The Tornadoes continued to perform through 2007. Members as of 2007 (including four members of the original band) were brothers Gerald (bass) and Norman &quot;Roly&quot; Sanders (lead guitar), their cousin Jesse Sanders (rhythm guitar), Leonard Delaney (May 18, 1943 – October 5, 2014; drums) and Joel Willenbring (saxophone).

In 2005, they released a CD called &quot;Now and Then&quot; on the Crossfire Publications label containing 29 tracks, including live recordings from their performance at the Zappanale concert in Germany in 2003, cuts from a 1998 CD, and two new recordings. The 2006 Crossfire Publications CD &quot;Charge Of The Tornadoes&quot; featured more of their 1960s masters and Zappanale performances.

The band announced on their website that they would retire and cease performing as of November 2008, but the band has since decided to continue. During a conversation with Crossfire Publications head, Greg Russo, on July 13, 2014, Tornadoes leader Gerald Sanders confirmed that the band was still active.

Former band member Leonard Delaney died on October 5, 2014, aged 71, in San Bernardino, California, from complications of Alzheimer&#x27;s disease.

<doc id="761750" wikidata="Q2900882" url="?curid=761750" title="Closely related key">
<text>In music, a closely related key (or close key) is one sharing many common tones with an original key, as opposed to a distantly related key (or distant key). In music harmony, there are six of them: four of them share all the pitches except one with a key with which it is being compared, one of them shares all the pitches, and one shares the same tonic.

Such keys are the most commonly used destinations or transpositions in a modulation, because of their strong structural links with the home key. Distant keys may be reached sequentially through closely related keys by chain modulation, for example, C to G to D. For example, &quot;One principle that every composer of Haydn&#x27;s day Classical music era] kept in mind was over-all unity of tonality. No piece dared wander too far from its tonic key, and no piece in a four-movement form dared to present a tonality not closely related to the key of the whole series.&quot; For example, the first movement of Mozart&#x27;s Piano Sonata No. 7, K. 309, modulates only to closely related keys (the dominant, supertonic, and submediant).

Given a major key tonic (I), the related keys are: 
* ii (supertonic, the relative minor of the subdominant)
*iii (mediant, the relative minor of the dominant)
*IV (subdominant): one less sharp (or one more flat) around circle of fifths
*V (dominant): one more sharp (or one fewer flat) around circle of fifths
*vi (submediant or relative minor): different tonic, same key signature
*i (parallel minor): same tonic, different key signature
Specifically:

In a minor key, the closely related keys are the parallel major, mediant or relative major, the subdominant, the minor dominant, the submediant, and the subtonic. In the key of A minor, when we translate them to keys, we get:
* A major (I)
* C major (III)
* D minor (iv)
* E minor (v)
* F major (VI)
* G major (VII)

Another view of closely related keys is that there are six closely related keys, based on the tonic and the remaining triads of the diatonic scale, excluding the dissonant diminished triads. Four of the six differ by one accidental, one has the same key signature, and one uses the parallel modal form. In the key of C major, these would be: D minor, E minor, F major, G major, A minor, and C minor. Despite being three sharps or flats away from the original key in the circle of fifths, parallel keys are also considered as closely related keys as the tonal center is the same, and this makes this key have an affinity with the original key. 

In modern music, the closeness of a relation between any two keys or sets of pitches may be determined by the number of tones they share in common, which allows one to consider modulations not occurring in standard major-minor tonality. For example, in music based on the pentatonic scale containing pitches C, D, E, G, and A, modulating a fifth higher gives the collection of pitches G, A, B, D, and E, having four of five tones in common. However, modulating up a tritone would produce F, G, A, C, D, which shares no common tones with the original scale. Thus the scale a fifth higher is very closely related, while the scale a tritone higher is not. Other modulations may be placed in order from closest to most distant depending upon the number of common tones.

According to another view in modern music, notably in Bartók, a common tonic produces closely related keys, the other scales being the six other modes. This usage can be found in several of the &quot;Mikrokosmos&quot; piano pieces.

When modulation causes the new key to traverse the bottom of the circle of fifths this may give rise to a theoretical key, containing eight (or more) sharps or flats in its notated key signature; in such a case, notational conventions require recasting the new section in its enharmonically equivalent key.

Andranik Tangian suggests 3D and 2D visualizations of key/chord proximity for both all major and all minor keys/chords by locating them along a single subdominant-dominant axis, which wraps a torus that is then unfolded.

<text>The Tuamotu Archipelago or the Tuamotu Islands (, officially ) are a French Polynesian chain of just under 80 islands and atolls in the southern Pacific Ocean. They constitute the largest chain of atolls in the world, extending (from northwest to southeast) over an area roughly the size of Western Europe. Their combined land area is . This archipelago&#x27;s major islands are Rangiroa, Anaa, Fakarava, Hao and Makemo.

The Tuamotus have approximately 16,000 inhabitants. The islands were initially settled by Polynesians, and modern Tuamotuans have inherited from them a shared culture and the Tuamotuan language.

The Tuamotus are a French overseas collectivity.

== History ==
The early history of the Tuamotu islands is generally unknown. Archaeological findings suggest that the western Tuamotus were settled from the Society Islands as early as 900 CE or as late as 1200 CE. DNA evidence suggests that they were settled about 1110 CE. On the islands of Rangiroa, Manihi and Mataiva, there are flat ceremonial platforms (called &quot;marae&quot;) made of coral blocks, although their exact age is unknown.

The first known European encounter with the Tuamotus was with the Portuguese sailor Ferdinand Magellan, during his circumglobal voyage in 1521. His encounter was followed by visits from several other Europeans, including:
* Portuguese sailor Pedro Fernandes de Queirós in 1606;
* Dutch mariners Willem Schouten and Jacob Le Maire in 1616;
* Jacob Roggeveen (who also first sighted Easter Island) in 1722;
* John Byron in 1765;
* Louis Antoine de Bougainville in 1768;
* James Cook during his first voyage in 1769;
* Spanish navigator Domingo de Bonechea in 1774 and
* Russian expedition of Otto von Kotzebue in 1815.
None of these visits were of political consequence, as the islands were within the sphere of influence of the Pōmare Dynasty of Tahiti.

The first Christian missionaries arrived in the islands at the beginning of the 19th century. By the late 19th century, traders had begun offering pearls from the islands for sale in Europe, and they became coveted possessions there. France forced the abdication of King Pōmare V of Tahiti and claimed the islands, but did not formally annex them.

Robert Louis Stevenson and Fanny Stevenson travelled among the Tuamotus (then called the Paumotus) on the yacht &quot;Casco&quot; in 1888; an account of their journey was published as &quot;In the South Seas&quot;. Jack London wrote a story, &quot;The Seed of McCoy&quot;, based on an incident in 1900 in which a burning ship, the &quot;Pyrenees&quot;, had been safely beached on Mangareva. In the story, London has the ship sail past Mangareva and all through the Tuamotus before beaching on Fakarava.

The Tuamotus made headlines around the world in 1947, when the Norwegian ethnographer Thor Heyerdahl, sailing from South America with a crew of five others, reached Raroia on his raft &quot;Kon-Tiki&quot;. The islands were in the news again somewhat later, when France conducted nuclear weapons testing on the atolls of Moruroa and Fangataufa.

== Administrative divisions ==
French Polynesia is a semi-autonomous island group designated as an overseas country of France. The Tuamotus combine with the Gambier Islands to form the &quot;Îles Tuamotu-Gambier&quot; which is one of the five administrative divisions of French Polynesia.

The Tuamotus are grouped into sixteen communes: Anaa; Arutua; Fakarava; Fangatau; Hao; Hikueru; Makemo; Manihi; Napuka; Nukutavake; Puka Puka; Rangiroa; Reao; Takaroa; Tatakoto; and Tureia.

=== Electoral divisions ===

The communes on Tuamotu are part of two different electoral districts (&quot;circonscriptions électorales&quot;) represented in the Assembly of French Polynesia. The electoral district called &quot;Îles Gambier et Tuamotu Est&quot; comprises the commune of Gambier and eleven communes in eastern Tuamotu: Anaa, Fangatau, Hao, Hikueru, Makemo, Napuka, Nukutavake, Pukapuka, Reao, Tatakoto, and Tureia. The other five communes in western Tuamotu – Arutua, Fakarava, Manihi, Rangiroa, and Takaroa – form the electoral district called &quot;Îles Tuamotu Ouest&quot;.

== Geography ==
Despite the vast spread of the archipelago, it covers a total land area of only about . The climate is a warm tropical one, without sharply distinct seasons. The average annual temperature is a relatively continuous . Water sources such as lakes or rivers are absent, leaving catchments of rain as the only source of fresh water. The annual average rainfall is . Although average rainfall is lowest in September and November, it does not vary markedly throughout the year.

The archipelago is geologically highly stable, because it was created by the action of the Easter fracture zone, which is only weakly active. There have been no volcanic eruptions during recorded history.

=== Flora and fauna ===
The sparse soil of the coral islands does not support diverse vegetation. The coconut palm, which is the basis of copra production, is of special economic importance. On a few of the islands, vanilla is also cultivated. Agriculture is generally otherwise limited to simple subsistence. Fruit and vegetable staples include yams, taro, breadfruit, and a wide range of tropical fruit. Pandanus leaves are traditionally woven together to make mats, hats, and roof thatches. However, many of the roofs nowadays are made of corrugated sheet-metal. There are also mangrove forests in sheltered areas, though its less common around coral atolls.

The species-rich reefs are home to a diverse range of underwater fauna. The surface creatures are primarily seabirds, insects, and lizards. The Tuamotus have 86 species of birds, ten of which are endemic, including the Tuamotu kingfisher, the Tuamotu reed warbler, and the Tuamotu sandpiper. Thirteen species are globally threatened, and one has gone extinct.

=== Geology ===
All of the islands of the Tuamotus are coral &quot;low islands&quot;: essentially high sand bars built upon coral reefs. Makatea, southwest of the Palliser Islands, is one of three great phosphate rocks in the Pacific Ocean. (The others are Banaba in Kiribati, and the island nation of Nauru.) Although the Gambier Islands are geographically part of the Tuamotus because they lie at the southeastern extreme of the archipelago, they are geologically and culturally distinct.

The ring-shaped atoll Taiaro, which lies in the northwestern portion of the archipelago, is a rare example of a coral reef that has a fully enclosed lagoon. Taiaro has been officially designated a UNESCO biosphere reserve since 1977.

== Demographics ==
A little more than fifty atolls are permanently populated; the rest are occupied only sporadically, during the copra harvesting season or as a base for fishing expeditions. The population has grown in the last years due to the fishing boom in the northern part and the extraction of pearls, especially black pearls, in the west and in the center. In any case, most of the inhabitants practice subsistence agriculture.

In the 2007 census, there were 15,510 inhabitants in the Tuamotu Islands, a population density of 18 inhabitants/km2. The population was 14,876 in 2002 and 8,100 in 1983. In 2002, 769 inhabitants lived within 400 km of the islands of Moruroa and Fangataufa (former nuclear test base).
=== Languages ===
The official language of the archipelago is French. However, the Tuamotu language, Pa&#x27;umotu, is recognized as a regional language of the French Republic. In the Gambier Islands, Mangarevan is spoken, while in Puka Puka a Marquesan dialect is used.

=== Religion ===
The majority of the population is Christian, including members of the Catholic Church and various Protestant groups. The Catholic Church administers 42 churches on the islands under the Metropolitan Archdiocese of Papeete.

In 1833, the Catholic Church divided the Pacific into two apostolic vicariates: Western Oceania fell to the Marists and Eastern Oceania-which included the Tuamots, Hawaii, Tahiti, the Marquesas and the Cook Islands-was the responsibility of the Picpus missionaries. In 1834, the French Fathers Honoré Laval and François d&#x27;Assise Caret arrived in Mangareva.

First with the acquiescence and then with the active support of the island chiefs, the Picpusians embarked on an extensive development program for the Gambier Islands. This included the introduction of cotton cultivation, pearl and mother-of-pearl fishing, and the establishment of plantations and orchards. As they were very successful, their missionary activities gradually spread to the other islands of the Tuamotu archipelago. With the missionary work, news of the islands&#x27; wealth in pearls also reached Europe, making them a coveted destination for European traders and adventurers.

== Economy ==
The islands&#x27; economy is predominantly based on subsistence agriculture. The most important sources of additional income are the cultivation of black pearls and the preparation of copra. Tourism-related income remains meager, especially compared to the income generated by tourism in the neighboring Society Islands. Modest tourism infrastructure is found on the atolls of Rangiroa and Manihi, which offer recreational scuba diving and snorkeling destinations.

The inhabitants of Tuamotu produce 75% of the copra of French Polynesia. It is a subsidized family activity and the only resource of the atolls farthest from the center and east.

Fishing is a major activity in the atolls closest to Tahiti (Rangiroa, Arutua, Apataki), which supply the central market of Papeete.

<text>Pascale Petit (born 20 December 1953), is a French-born British poet of French, Welsh and Indian heritage. She was born in Paris and grew up in France and Wales. She trained as a sculptor at the Royal College of Art and was a visual artist for the first part of her life. She has travelled widely, particularly in the Peruvian and Venezuelan Amazon and India.

Petit has published eight poetry collections, four of which were shortlisted for the T. S. Eliot Prize. Her seventh collection &quot;Mama Amazonica&quot; won the Ondaatje Prize in 2018 and the inaugural Laurel Prize for Poetry in 2020. In 2018, Petit was elected as a Fellow of the Royal Society of Literature.

==Career==
Petit has published eight poetry collections: &quot;Heart of a Deer&quot; (1998), &quot;The Zoo Father&quot; (2001), &quot;The Huntress&quot; (2005), &quot;The Treekeeper&#x27;s Tale&quot; (2008), &quot;What the Water Gave Me: Poems After Frida Kahlo&quot; (2010), &quot;Fauverie&quot; (2014), &quot;Mama Amazonica&quot; (2017) and &quot;Tiger Girl&quot; (2020). She also published a pamphlet of poems &quot;The Wounded Deer: Fourteen Poems After Frida Kahlo&quot; (2005). For her work in poetry she has received many awards, including the Cholmondeley Award, four from Arts Council England and three from the Society of Authors. 

Petit was shortlisted for the Forward Best Single Poem Prize after publishing &quot;The Strait-Jackets&quot; (from &quot;The Zoo Father&quot;) and in 2001 she was one of ten poets commissioned by BBC Radio 4 to write a poem for National Poetry Day. &quot;The Zoo Father&quot; (2001) was a Poetry Book Society Recommendation. &quot;The Zoo Father&quot; (2001), &quot;The Huntress&quot; (2005), &quot;What the Water Gave Me: Poems After Frida Kahlo&quot; (2010), and &quot;Fauverie&quot; (2014) were all shortlisted for the T. S. Eliot Prize. Three books were books of the year in &quot;The Observer&quot;, &quot;The Times Literary Supplement&quot; and &quot;The Independent&quot;. &quot;What the Water Gave Me&quot; was shortlisted for the Wales Book of the Year. 

Petit&#x27;s 2017 collection, &quot;Mama Amazonica&quot;, won the inaugural Laurel Prize for Poetry 2020, the 2018 Ondaatje Prize, was a Poetry Book Society Choice, and was shortlisted for the Roehampton Poetry Prize. Her 2020 collection &quot;Tiger Girl&quot; was shortlisted for the Forward Prize for Best Collection.

&quot;The Zoo Father&quot; is published in a bilingual edition in Mexico and distributed in Spain and Latin America. Her books have been translated into Chinese, Serbian, Spanish (in Mexico) and French. She has also translated the poems of a number of contemporary Chinese poets including Yang Lian, Wang Xiaoni and Zhai Yongming. She was Poetry Editor of &quot;Poetry London&quot; from 1990 to 2005, a Royal Literary Fund Fellow at Middlesex University from 2007 to 2009 and a Royal Literary Fund Fellow at the Courtauld Institute of Art in 2011–12. She tutored poetry courses for Tate Modern for nine years, and currently tutors for the Arvon Foundation, the Poetry School and Literature Wales. The Poetry Book Society selected her as one of the 2004 Next Generation Poets, a promotional listing for spotlighting notable young to middle aged British poets. Petit became a Fellow of the Royal Society of Literature in 2018.

== Reception ==
The Australian poet Les Murray has praised her work in &quot;The Times Literary Supplement&quot;, where he wrote: &quot;No other British poet I am aware of can match the powerful mythic imagination of Pascale Petit.&quot; Jackie Kay in &quot;The Observer&quot; wrote: &quot;Pascale&#x27;s poems are as fresh as paint, and make you look all over again at Frida and her brilliant and tragic life.&quot; Ruth Padel, reviewing &quot;What the Water Gave Me: Poems After Frida Kahlo&quot; in &quot;The Guardian&quot; wrote: &quot;Petit&#x27;s collection is not a verse biography, but a hard-hitting, palette-knife evocation of the effect that bus crash had on Kahlo&#x27;s life and work. &#x27;And this is how I started painting. / Time stretched out its spectrum / and screeched its brakes.&#x27; WH Auden, in his elegy for Yeats, tells the Irish poet: &#x27;Mad Ireland hurt you into poetry.&#x27; Petit&#x27;s collection, exploring the way trauma hurts an artist into creation, celebrates the rebarbative energy with which Kahlo redeemed pain and transformed it into paint.&quot;

<text>Josif Pančić (; April 17, 1814 – February 25, 1888) was a Serbian botanist, a doctor of medicine, a lecturer at the Great School (the future University of Belgrade), and the first president of the Serbian Royal Academy. He extensively documented the flora of Serbia, and is credited with having classified many species of plants which were unknown to the botanical community at that time. Pančić is credited with discovering the Serbian spruce. He is regarded as the father of Serbian botany.

==Life==

===Early life and studies===
Josip Pančić was born in Ugrini, near Crikvenica, on the Military Frontier, a territory in the Habsburg monarchy. At the time of his birth, the region was part of the French Empire. Pančić was the fourth son of Pavel Pančić and his wife Margarita. His paternal grandfather, who came from the area around Niš, had served in a volunteer battalion of the Austrian Imperial Army during the Austro-Turkish War. According to tradition, the Pančić family hailed from Herzegovina and settled in Ugrini in olden times.

After finishing elementary school in Gospić, he went on to the lyceum in Rijeka, and then continued classes in the &quot;Regia Academica Scientiarum&quot; in Zagreb (1830). He graduated in 1842 in Budapest in medicine. In addition to other courses, Pančić attended botany courses, taught by the then renowned botany professor, Joseph Sadler (Sadler József). Later, recalling those early lectures, he wrote:
===Work===
While studying about botany at the Natural History Museum in Vienna, Pančić became acquainted with the Serbian linguist Vuk Stefanović Karadžić who wrote him a letter of recommendation to the Serbian authorities, in order to fulfill his wish to settle in the Principality of Serbia to study Nature. In May 1846, he arrived in Serbia where for the first seven years he worked as a physician in rural area. In 1847, he asked to be released from his Austrian citizenship and applied for Serbian citizenship, the same year he met his future wife Lyudmila Mileva.

In 1853, he moved from Kragujevac to Belgrade when he was first appointed adjunct professor at Belgrade Lyceum&#x27;s Department of Natural History and Agronomy by decree of Prince Alexander Karadjordjević, before becoming a full-time professor of Natural History and Agriculture in 1854, as decreed by the Ministry of Education of the Principality of Serbia.

As Professor of Natural Sciences, he as one of the six original professors (along with Konstantin Branković, Jovan Sterija Popović, Đura Daničić, Matija Ban, and Dimitrije Nešić), of the Lyceum of the Principality of Serbia.

He later became rector of the Great School (the future University of Belgrade) and the founder of the Institutes of Mineralogy and Geology, Zoologial and Botanical Departments and of the experimental botanical gardens in Belgrade.

Pančić extensively documented the flora of Serbia and is credited with having classified many species of plants that were unknown to the botanical community at the time. He discovered a total of 47 valid species new to science. The crowning achievement of Pančić floristic studies was the &quot;Flora of the Principality of Serbia&quot; () published in 1874, while a supplement was added ten years later. His explorations marked the golden age of Serbia&#x27;s botany.

His most significant discovery was the Serbian Spruce (&quot;Picea omorika&quot;), which he discovered near Zaovine on the Tara Mountain in 1875. He firmly established Serbian botany among European sciences. He ascertained that Serbia&#x27;s flora was rich and worthy of further studies. During the Serbian–Ottoman War (1876–1878), he was the Chief Physician of the Belgrade Hospital.

He is said to have &quot;fallen in love&quot; with Kopaonik, which he visited 16 times between 1851 and 1886. Pančić was named the first president of the Serbian Royal Academy formed on April 5, 1887. He requested the opening of the Botanical garden &quot;Jevremovac&quot; in Belgrade. Pančić died on 25 February 1888, his last wish was to be buried in the Kopaonik Mountain.

==Legacy==

A mausoleum of Josif Pančić was erected at the highest peak of Kopaonik in 1951 by the Academy of Science, the University of Belgrade and the Hiking club, with the inscription:
A research society has been named after him, Josif Pančić Biological Research Society (Biološko istraživačko društvo &quot;Josif Pančić&quot;). He was depicted on the 10 Dinars note printed in 1994. He is included in The 100 most prominent Serbs. In 1951, the highest point in the Kopaonik mountain range was changed from Milan Peak to Pančić&#x27;s Peak.

On April 17, 2010, Google celebrated his birthday with a Google Doodle.

<doc id="761768" wikidata="Q891555" url="?curid=761768" title="Pacific Wings">
<text>Pacific Wings Airline was an American commuter airline headquartered in Mesa, Arizona, United States in Greater Phoenix. The airline operated flights under the brands New Mexico Airlines in New Mexico, GeorgiaSkies in Georgia, TennesseeSkies in Tennessee, and KentuckySkies in Kentucky, as well as under the Pacific Wings name in Hawaii. The airline was closed in 2014.

== History ==

The airline was established and started operations in July 1974 when it was incorporated as Air Nevada, an on-demand charter operator. Scheduled passenger services started in 1978 with the airline operating nonstop flights between Las Vegas and Grand Canyon National Park Airport with Cessna 402 twin prop aircraft. After Eagle Canyon Airlines acquired its network of tour operators, Air Nevada ceased operations in January 1998, changed its operating name to Pacific Wings and continued its scheduled services within Hawaii. It was owned by Greg Kahlstorf (50%) and Frank Ford (50%).

On February 1, 2007, the airline began operating flights between Honolulu and Molokai, Honolulu and Lanai, and Kahului and Molokai as PW Express, offering $49 one way fares on every seat on every flight. Service to Kapalua, West Maui began a month later. PW Express service terminated in July 2009 in the wake of Pacific Wings cutbacks following an incident with airport security in Kahului.

In May 2013, the airline confirmed reports that it would be ending all flights in Hawaii on June 15, 2013. By the time the reports emerged, the airline had reduced its service to Honolulu, Kahului, Kona, and Molokai; having eliminated flights Hana, Kalaupapa, and Kamuela. By 2014 the airline ceased all operations and was out of business.

==Corporate affairs==
The airline was headquartered in Mesa, Arizona in Greater Phoenix.

The airline previously had its headquarters in Dallas, Texas. Previously the headquarters were in the Kahului Airport Commuter Terminal in Kahului Airport in Maui, Hawaii.

==Subsidiaries==

The following airline divisions of Pacific Wings all used the same call sign of Tsunami, two letter IATA codes (LW), and ICAO 3 letter code – (NMI). As for FAA DOT regulating purposes they are all the same airline. For marketing purposes, the operations were segmented into various divisions.

=== New Mexico Airlines ===
In January 2007, the airline applied for Essential Air Service subsidies to serve Clovis and Silver City, New Mexico from Albuquerque, competing with a bid from incumbent operator Great Lakes Aviation, and to serve Hobbs and Carlsbad, New Mexico, competing with a bid from incumbent operator Air Midwest. Pacific Wings has said the airline would serve the routes with Cessna Grand Caravan aircraft, and would aim to wean the routes off subsidy service, as it has done in Hawaii. It would also serve other destinations from Albuquerque without a subsidy.

In March 2007, both the Lea County Commission (which oversees the airport in Hobbs) and the Carlsbad City Council voted unanimously to support Pacific Wings&#x27; bid to replace Mesa&#x27;s EAS contract to both airports. In addition to subsidized service to Albuquerque and El Paso, Texas, the airline has also proposed unsubsidized service to Lubbock and Midland-Odessa, Texas and Santa Fe, New Mexico. It was also reported that the airline had withdrawn its bid for service to Silver City after local officials declined to meet with airline representatives. The United States Department of Transportation issued an order selecting Pacific Wings for the Hobbs and Carlsbad service on March 30, 2007. Flights in New Mexico began on July 1, 2007, under the name New Mexico Airlines. The airline had all of its aircraft grounded by the FAA in December 2014 and was able to reinstate some service in early 2015 but completely shut down by May, 2015.

===GeorgiaSkies===
In June 2008, Pacific Wings was awarded an EAS contract for service to Athens Benn Epps Airport, Georgia and Middle Georgia Regional Airport in Macon, Georgia. The airline began operating flights from Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport in Atlanta under the name GeorgiaSkies using Cessna Grand Caravan aircraft on September 29, 2008. However, as of January 2013, GeorgeSkies reportedly no longer flies between Macon and Atlanta, although GeorgiaSkies has a press release stating that &quot;GeorgiaSkies has been ordered to
continue serving the City until a replacement carrier can be found.&quot; For a brief period Macon was without air service as the replacement carrier Sun Air International was unable to begin operations on the slated date. Eventually, Silver Airways began EAS service to Macon.

===TennesseeSkies/KentuckySkies===

In mid-2009 Pacific Wings was awarded a contract to provide EAS service from Jackson, Tennessee and Owensboro, Kentucky. Marketed as TennesseeSkies in Jackson and KentuckySkies in Owensboro, flights from both cities would be offered to Nashville, Tennessee with some flights continuing to Atlanta, Georgia. Service began on August 30, 2009. On June 30, 2011 Pacific Wings filed with the United States Department of Transportation a 90-day notice of its intent to terminate service effective September 30, 2011 saying it is “unable to procure counter or gate space at Nashville International Airport on reasonable terms.” The DOT prohibited the airline from suspending service until a replacement carrier began service. Eventually replacement carriers were procured (Cape Air in Owensboro and SeaPort Airlines in Jackson) and TennesseeSkies/KentuckySkies ceased operation in early 2012.

===St. Louis, Missouri operation===

For the year 2013, Pacific Wings had received the EAS contract to serve Burlington, Iowa, Decatur, Illinois, and Jonesboro, Arkansas from St. Louis, Missouri replacing Air Choice One.

==Incidents and Accidents==

On July 12, 1993, when the airline was still known as Air Nevada, a Cessna 402C with registration N818AN crashed after takeoff from McCarran International Airport in Las Vegas, Nevada. The flight was destined for the Grand Canyon, but after liftoff the pilot advised the air traffic controller that the baggage door was open and requested to return to the airport for landing. The pilot and both passengers on board were killed. The National Transportation Safety Board determined the probable cause of the accident to be the pilot&#x27;s failure to maintain adequate airspeed while maneuvering in the traffic pattern, with the pilot&#x27;s failure to assure that the nose baggage compartment door was secured as an additional factor.

==Incidents with Airport Security==
After several videotaped incidents in 2005, Pacific Wings accused the security firm Wackenhut of harassment.

The first known recorded incident reported in the media happened in October 2005, after the President of the airline and one of his employees were attacked by Wackenhut Security Manager &quot;Butch&quot; Tam Ho in an airport conference room during a meeting in which Pacific Wings requested to bring repeated incidents of harassment by Wackenhut personnel to the attention of airport management. The airline President and his employee were then placed under citizen&#x27;s arrest by Wackenhut personnel and held for hours without being Mirandized or allowed access to a telephone. The airline executive was knocked unconscious during the event, and his employee suffered a facial fracture. Neither the Pacific Wings President nor the employee were ever charged by prosecutors with any crime, and both arrest records were expunged six months after the incident. Tam Ho was indicted on two counts of witness tampering by a federal Grand Jury in May 2008. The case went to trial in early 2009, and on October 16, 2009, Tam Ho was found not guilty on all counts due to a legal technicality involving whether Tam Ho&#x27;s admitted assault was done under color of law.

On November 14, 2005, another employee was accosted by another Wackenhut Security Guard while unloading supplies at the same airport. The employee videotaped the entire incident. On the videotape clip repeatedly broadcast in local media, the guard is shown threatening to kill the employee with a sidearm, shoving and cursing at the employee, and spitting on the employee. The guard, Eric Brown, was arrested by Maui Police and charged with terroristic threatening. Brown was later banned from working on any state property or facility.

On July 8, 2009, Pacific Wings temporarily suspended its Hawaii operations a day after an alleged confrontation between airline employees and Securitas airport police attempting to deliver a citation to Gabe Kimbrell, the airline&#x27;s president and chief operations officer, in connection with a fuel spill and alleged improper storage of fuel in the airline&#x27;s Kahului hangar the previous month. The airline resumed flights two days later, announcing that it was reducing service to just three routes, completely eliminating service to Kona and increasing ticket prices.

== Fleet ==
The Pacific Wings fleet was composed of single engine Cessna 208B Grand Caravan aircraft. Prior to the acquisition of the Cessna 208, the airline operated a fleet of twin engine Cessna 402 aircraft.

<text>Miguel Orlando Collins (born 17 April 1976), known by his stage name Sizzla Kalonji or Sizzla, is a Jamaican reggae musician. He is one of the most commercially and critically successful contemporary reggae artists and is noted for his high number of releases. As of 2018 he has released 56 solo albums.

== Biography ==
Sizzla was born in St. Mary, Jamaica, to devout Rastafarian parents. Like them, Sizzla subscribes to the Bobo Ashanti branch of the Rastafari movement. He was raised in August Town, Kingston, Jamaica where he studied mechanical engineering at Dunoon High School.

=== Career ===
Sizzla began to develop his own style whilst serving his musical apprenticeship with the Caveman Hi-Fi sound system. He has used his music as a vehicle for his message, kickstarting his recording career in 1995 with a release through the Zagalou label, he then teamed up with &quot;Bobby Digital&quot; Dixon for a series of singles. Extensive touring with fellow Xterminator label mate roots and culture artist Luciano followed, earning Sizzla notoriety

Homer Harris, the same man who named and mentored Buju Banton got him his first break, introduced Sizzla to top Jamaican saxophonist Dean Fraser, the musical director for Philip &quot;Fatis&quot; Burrell&#x27;s Xterminator Family. 1995 marked an important turning point for Sizzla when he began working with Fattis. This union led to a run of successful singles and the release of Sizzla&#x27;s debut album, &quot;Burning Up&quot;.

The two allied again a year later with the follow-up, &quot;Praise Ye Jah&quot; (JetStar). &quot;Praise Ye Jah&quot; was quickly trumped by his release of the Dixon-produced &quot;Black Woman &amp; Child&quot; that same year. The title track was a smash hit and became something of a cultural reggae anthem. Sizzla scored several more hits during 1997, including &quot;Like Mountain,&quot; &quot;Babylon Cowboy,&quot; &quot;Kings of the Earth,&quot; and the Luciano duet &quot;Build a Better World&quot;. This hot streak kicked off an enormously productive recording binge that lasted over the next several years, with much of his output still done for Burrell.

Along with universal praise came Sizzla&#x27;s first nomination for Best International Reggae Artist of the Year at the 1998 MOBO Awards and a place in various magazines&#x27; top 100 albums of the year. Sizzla has since released several dozen albums, including 1998&#x27;s &quot;Kalonji&quot; and &quot;Royal Son of Ethiopia&quot; from 1999. 1999 also saw him receive his second MOBO nomination. Sizzla remains a constant presence in the reggae charts worldwide. Currently, Sizzla has 21 albums that have made it onto the Billboard&#x27;s Top Reggae Albums music chart, the highest &quot;Words of Truth&quot;, reaching the peak position of No. 5.

Sizzla Kalonji has released over 45 solo albums and over fifteen combination albums, crossing different genres of Reggae. He has started his own record company, Kalonji Records; which in a joint venture with Damon Dash Music Group and Koch Records, released the album, &quot;The Overstanding&quot;, in November 2006. This was his third album released through Kalonji Records; as well as &quot;Black History&quot; and &quot;Life&quot;.

Sizzla, along with reggae recording artists such as Capleton, Norris Man, Turbulence, Buju Banton, and Anthony B, are credited with leading a movement toward a re-embracement of Rastafarian values in contemporary reggae music by recording material which is concerned primarily with spirituality and social consciousness, explores common themes, such as Babylon&#x27;s corrupting influence, the disenfranchisement of ghetto youth, oppression of the black nation and Sizzla&#x27;s abiding faith in Jah and resistance against perceived agents of oppression.

Sizzla&#x27;s 2008 effort, &quot;Ghetto Youth-ology&quot;, is produced by the Firehouse Crew, the same who produced Sizzla&#x27;s debut, &quot;Burning Up&quot;.

In 2013 he released the album &quot;The Messiah&quot;. In January 2014 it was nominated for a Grammy Award, his first nomination. In 2014 Sizzla was featured in the song and video for Stephen Marley&#x27;s single &quot;Rock Stone.&quot;

His sons Raheem Collins and Melech Collons have followed him into a career in music, working under the name Reemus k and Skorcha.

=== Judgement Yard ===
Judgement Yard was established as a community centre in August Town, an eastern suburb of Kingston, Jamaica, by Sizzla Kalonji. Although Judgement Yard is an organisation of sorts, it is also a geographic location at 41 August Town Road, which is where Sizzla maintains one of his residences. Judgement Yard is also the home of Kalonji&#x27;s state of the art studio, as well as his record label, Kalonji Records. As the owner and founder of the Yard, Kalonji is responsible for many youths in the community of August Town, as well as youths who come from other areas to seek assistance and guidance in life as well as music. He is an influence to many. Many of these same youths who are members of Judgement Yard fraternity are musicians or have some direct affiliation with the music through production works, artiste works, etc.
Sizzla has recorded songs with the prominent artists in Judgement Yard, Joseph Shepherd, Bobo David and G-Mac.

=== Zimbabwe ===
In February 2010, Sizzla travelled to Zimbabwe to perform at the 86th birthday celebration of former Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe. There was a near-riot during his performance, including beatings of crowd members by police, causing Sizzla to temporarily halt his performance and ask the police to cease the beatings.

Later that year, Sizzla was &quot;rewarded&quot; with a farm in the country, with the artist stating he was &quot;here to stay&quot; in Zimbabwe. He also voiced plans to begin an agro-business and build a recording studio in the country.
The moves were not without controversy, particularly among Mugabe detractors who insisted he not perform for the President. Sizzla refused to condemn Mugabe post-performance, while insisting the land he received was not a reward from the Zimbabwean government, but given to him by the local people in appreciation for his performance. He also stated plans to eventually make Zimbabwe his permanent home.

=== Motorcycle accident ===
On 24 August 2011, Sizzla was hit by a bus while riding his motorcycle along the Salem main road, near Runaway Bay in St. Ann, Jamaica, leading to many false reports of the singer&#x27;s death. He resumed recording by the beginning of the following year. In October 2019, he was yet again involved in another motorcycle accident and was hospitalized for a broken ankle.

=== Controversy ===

Sizzla has faced backlash due to the anti-gay lyrics in some of his recordings, causing the cancellation of many international concert events.

In 2004, he was barred from entering the United Kingdom for several concerts. OutRage!, a British LGBT rights group alleged that some of Sizzla&#x27;s songs contain lyrics that advocate violence against LGBT people. In 2007, Sizzla&#x27;s concerts in Toronto and Montreal were canceled after protests from Stop Murder Music Canada coalition. Kalonji&#x27;s song titled, &quot;Nah Apologize&quot;, was recorded in 2004. In 2008 his visa was cancelled, preventing him from entering Germany after performing half of his tour and he was sent back to the United States. Sizzla maintains his stance that he is an artist using his creative expression and freedom of speech but will speak out against injustice where he sees it. In 2009 and 2010 several concerts in Germany were cancelled after public protests against the concerts. In 2012 concerts were cancelled in Madrid (Spain), Ghent, Belgium, Stockholm, Sweden and Lisbon, Portugal after public protests. Kalonji Muzik issued a statement after the cancellations that he abides by the laws of every country that he performs in and is not trying to invoke or incite violence against anyone.

<text>Harry Eugene Crews (June 7, 1935 – March 28, 2012) was an American novelist, short story writer, and essayist. He often made use of violent, grotesque characters and set them in regions of the Deep South.

==Life==
Harry Crews was born June 7, 1935, during the Great Depression to two poor tenant farmers in Bacon County, Georgia. His father died while he was still a baby, and his mother soon remarried to his father&#x27;s brother. Crews was unaware that this man was not his biological father until years later.
As a child, he suffered two near-death experiences. When he was just five he contracted polio, causing his legs to fold up into the back of his thighs. He was originally told by doctors that he would not be able to walk again. After about a year of being immobile, except crawling with his hands, his legs straightened again and he was able to walk. Soon after this experience, he then fell into a vat of nearly boiling water, which was being used for soaking dead hogs before they were further prepared. His head did not go under the water, which saved his life, according to doctors. He suffered extreme burns on most of the rest of his body. He once again was unable to leave the bed when he was healing. Crews wrote in &quot;A Childhood: The Biography of a Place&quot;: &quot;Nearly everybody I knew had something missing, a finger cut off, a toe split, an ear half-chewed away, an eye clouded with blindness from a glancing fence staple. And if they didn&#x27;t have something missing, they were carrying scars from barbed wire, or knives, or fishhooks.&quot; These experiences later influenced the freakish characters he wrote about, although he did not like to use the term &quot;freak&quot; to describe them.
While Crews was still a child, his mother left his stepfather, and he and his brother went with her to live in the Springfield section of Jacksonville, Florida. Crews finished high school there as a below average student. After graduation, he joined the Marines during the Korean War. After his service, he attended the University of Florida on the G.I. Bill. Here, Crews became a student of Andrew Nelson Lytle, who had also taught Flannery O&#x27;Connor, and James Dickey. Crews and Lytle kept in contact for years afterwards, and Lytle provided criticism of Crews&#x27;s early work.
After an unplanned pregnancy, Crews married Sally Ellis, who gave birth to his first son, Patrick Scott. Sally soon wanted a divorce due to his infidelity and obsessiveness with writing. &quot;I was obsessed to the point of desperation with becoming a writer,&quot; he wrote, &quot;and, further, I lived with the conviction that I had gotten a late start toward that difficult goal…Consequently, perhaps I was impatient, irritable, and inattentive toward Sally as a young woman and mother.&quot; However, he soon convinced Sally to remarry, and they had a second son, Byron Jason. 
Crews graduated from the University of Florida with a degree in English, and eventually received a graduate degree of education. Crews then began teaching English, which he continued to do for the rest of his career, along with his career as a writer. In 1963, he had his first story published: &quot;The Unattached Smile&quot;. In 1964, he published another short story, &quot;A Long Wail&quot;.
In 1964 his first son, Patrick, drowned in a neighbor&#x27;s pool. Crews tried to perform mouth-to-mouth resuscitation, but this proved ineffectual. After the death of his son, Crews continued writing his first novel, &quot;The Gospel Singer&quot;, which appeared in 1968. Just after this publication, another came for his second novel, &quot;Naked in Garden Hills&quot;. Both were well received by critics at the time. In 1972, Sally asked for a second and final divorce. Crews did not marry again. His sole surviving son, Byron Jason Crews, is personal representative and acting executor of the Harry Crews Literary Estate.

==Writing career and style==
After Crews&#x27;s first two novels, he wrote prolifically, including novels, screenplays and essays, for journals including &quot;Esquire&quot; and &quot;Playboy&quot;. He often set precise due times to finish whatever he was working on, and so had quick turnaround between writings. Once he published &quot;The Gospel Singer&quot;, he began to write eight novels, publishing one almost every year. Much of Crews&#x27;s work is now out of print.
His works were known to feature &quot;freaks&quot;, and &quot;outcasts&quot;, usually from rural areas. In &quot;Car&quot;, a man consumes an entire car by slowly eating piece by piece. In &quot;The Knockout Artist&quot;, a poor, Georgia-born boxer with a glass jaw knocks himself out at parties for money. &quot;A Feast of Snakes&quot;, one of his best known, and most provocative novels, was banned for a time in South Africa. 
Crews felt strongly that authors should write about experiences that they have actually had. In his personal life, he often moved from obsession to obsession, and became knowledgeable on many subjects. Crews and Sally learned karate together, which then influenced &quot;Karate Is a Thing of the Spirit&quot;. In addition, &quot;The Hawk is Dying&quot; features an amateur hawk trainer who deals with condescension from college professors, and features a son-figure who drowns. Crews himself had a fascination with hawks for a period of time, and even trapped and trained them so they would sit on his arm. &quot;Body&quot; is a story about a competitive female body builder, her trainer, and her lower-class family from Waycross, Georgia. Crews himself trained his girlfriend, Maggie Powell, who would become a Southeast bodybuilding champion. 
During his time writing for &quot;Esquire&quot;, he wrote a column called &quot;Grits&quot; for fourteen months in the 1970s that covered such topics as cockfighting and dog fighting. Filled with rough experiences he had outside of urban life, &quot;grits&quot; became a term he used to describe the tough southern characters featured in his writing.
Crews continued writing and publishing his entire life. As his reputation grew, he became a favorite of Madonna, Sean Penn, Kim Gordon, and Thurston Moore. Madonna and Penn discussed making film adaptations of his novels, but these never came to fruition. Crews&#x27;s final novel, &quot;An American Family&quot;, featured a blurb on the cover from Moore, saying, &quot;God bless Harry Crews, America&#x27;s best writer. He’ll break your heart but he&#x27;ll always bring you love.&quot;

The University of Georgia acquired Crews&#x27;s papers in August 2006. The archive includes manuscripts and typescripts of his fiction, correspondence, and notes made by Crews while on assignment.

Crews died on March 28, 2012, from complications of neuropathy. His sole surviving son, Byron J. Crews, is professor emeritus of English and Dramatic Writing at Wright State University in Dayton, Ohio.

==Influence and Grit Lit==
Harry Crews&#x27;s work has become synonymous with the genre Grit Lit. Crews is considered a major influence, alongside Flannery O’Connor, Cormac McCarthy, and Barry Hannah, along with later writers in the genre including Larry Brown, Dorothy Allison, and Donald Ray Pollock. Grit Lit is usually set in rural areas and often in what has been called the &quot;Rough South&quot;. Larry Brown, one of the most celebrated writers in the genre, objected to the term &quot;Grit Lit&quot;, but he dedicated his novel, &quot;Fay&quot;, to Crews, calling him &quot;my uncle in all ways but blood.&quot; He and Crews remained friends until Brown&#x27;s death in 2004. 
&quot;Grit Lit: A Rough South Reader&quot;, defines the genre as &quot;typically blue collar or working class, mostly small town, sometimes rural, occasionally but not always violent, usually but not necessarily Southern.&quot; The subjects of the stories often have to deal with extreme circumstances for survival. The characters usually use their roughness, depravity, and violence as a means of living. Crews&#x27;s work has become synonymous with the &quot;Rough South,&quot; though he did not like the label &quot;Southern writer&quot;. Grit Lit itself can become an &quot;acquired taste&quot;, for those not from the South. 
Harry Crews&#x27;s experiences as a poor boy from Bacon County, Georgia, have made a major impact on his own stories. Many other Grit Lit writers are from working-class backgrounds as well, and use their experiences as a tool for writing their stories with accuracy. Crews has said, &quot;A writer&#x27;s job is to get naked, to hide nothing, to look away from nothing, to look at it. To not blink, to not be embarrassed by it or ashamed of it. Strip it down and let&#x27;s get to where the blood is, where the bone is.&quot;

==In popular culture==

* Crews scripted the original draft of 1985 thriller &quot;The New Kids&quot;, but was not pleased with the finished film; his name does not appear in the credits, which attribute the story and screenplay to Stephen Gyllenhaal and Brian Taggert.
* Kim Gordon (of Sonic Youth), Lydia Lunch, and Sadie Mae named their band Harry Crews after him. They released one album, &quot;Naked in Garden Hills&quot;, in 1989.
* Crews was the subject of the first installment of the &quot;Rough South&quot; documentary series written and directed by Gary Hawkins. The film, entitled &quot;The Rough South of Harry Crews&quot;, won a regional Emmy Award and the Corporation for Public Broadcasting&#x27;s Gold Award in 1992.
* In the documentary &quot;Searching for the Wrong-Eyed Jesus&quot; (2004), Crews tells his grisly homespun Southern stories while walking down a rural dirt track.
* Crews played a brief role in Sean Penn&#x27;s &quot;The Indian Runner&quot; and dedicated his book &quot;Scar Lover&quot; to Penn.
* In 2007, another documentary was released: &quot;Harry Crews – Survival Is Triumph Enough&quot;. The personal format is loosely based on an interview with artist and filmmaker Tyler Turkle, and the themes explored include hardship, tragedy and loss throughout Crews&#x27; life.
*Kansas City band Season to Risk wrote and recorded a song on their eponymous first album in 1993, entitled &quot;Snakes&quot;, which is inspired by the Crews novel &quot;A Feast of Snakes&quot;.
*&quot;Florida Trend&quot; magazine released an interview with Harry Crews posthumously in April 2012. The interview contains some notable quotes, such as, &quot;I&#x27;ve never begun a novel that I knew how it ended. I just start and try to find out what it is I think about whatever it is I am writing about.&quot; Another quote: &quot;Listen, if you want to write about all sweetness and light and that stuff, go get a job at Hallmark.&quot;

<text>The Tijuana River () is an intermittent river, 120 mi (195 km) long, near the Pacific coast of northern Baja California state in northwestern Mexico and Southern California in the western United States. The river is heavily polluted with raw sewage from the city of Tijuana, Mexico.

==Location==

The Tijuana River drains an area along the U.S.–Mexico border, flowing through Mexico for most its course then crossing the border into Southern California for its lower 5 mi (8 km) to empty into the ocean at the Tijuana River Estuary on the southern edge of San Diego. The region straddles the Mediterranean climate and semi-arid climate zones, so the Tijuana River and its tributaries often go dry in times of drought.

The Tijuana River has two main tributaries. One, the Arroyo de Alamar or Rio Alamar, runs in its upper reaches in the United States as Cottonwood Creek. It runs from its source in the Laguna Mountains southwestward where it is impounded by two dams, Barrett and Morena, to supply water to the city of San Diego. Cottonwood Creek is joined by the Tecate Creek before it enters Mexico where it is known as the Arroyo de Alamar from the point where it enters Mexico to its confluence with the larger tributary, the Arroyo de las Palmas, that forms the headwaters of the Tijuana River within the city.

The Arroyo de las Palmas, the main tributary of the Tijuana River, flows out of the mountains to the east into the reservoir behind the Abelardo L. Rodríguez Dam. Downstream from the Rodríguez Dam, water flows through Tijuana in a concrete channel to the international border; there it continues west through the Tijuana River Valley for a distance of about nine miles to the estuary and then to the Pacific Ocean.

Its lower reaches provide the last undeveloped coast wetlands in San Diego County amidst a highly urbanized environment at the southern city limits of Imperial Beach. The river has been the subject of great concern regarding pollution, flood control, and U.S. border protection.

==Description==
The Tijuana River rises in the Sierra de Juárez of northern Baja California, approximately 45 mi (70 km) ENE of Ensenada. It flows WNW through Tijuana, crossing the border approximately 5 mi (8 km) from the Pacific. It flows west, just skirting the international border south of the San Ysidro section of San Diego. The lower 2 mi (3 km) of the river form the broad mud flat estuary, and the Tijuana River Estuary is a rich habitat for wildlife, including over 370 species of birds; one of these species is the Ridgway&#x27;s rail. It is Southern California&#x27;s largest coastal wetland. It is naturally prone to flooding during heavy rains. The Tijuana River enters the Pacific 10 mi (15 km) south of downtown San Diego at the southern city limits of Imperial Beach.

The river is an intermittent river, flowing naturally only during rains. The river is impounded in Mexico southeast of Tijuana by the Abelardo L. Rodríguez Dam for drinking water and irrigation. Former Baja California Governor Milton Castellanos Everardo constructed concrete barriers along the riverbank to prevent flooding during his tenure. The United States was supposed to build a complementary system of barriers to ensure flooding waters didn&#x27;t flow back into Mexico, but instead adopted a dissipator flood control plan under the direction of the San Diego City Council, supported by ecologists, which preserved the estuary, which was then designated a wildlife sanctuary.

The majority of its watershed is within Mexico, between Mesa de Otay to the east, and hills to the west.

==Conservation==
===Flooding===
Flooding in the Tijuana River had been a concern for both the United States and Mexico because it would lead to sewage runoff and would ultimately cause property damage to the surrounding area. In 1944, the United States-Mexico Water Treaty was signed, this dealt with &quot;utilization of waters in the Colorado and Tijuana rivers and of the Rio Grande.&quot; This treaty appointed the International Boundary and Water Commission to handle several issues such as border sanitation. The IBWC went on to create the Tijuana River Flood Control Project in 1966 in order to create a flood control channels along the river. Mexico had completely complied by 1976 while the U.S. implementation stalled due to opposition at the local level. Despite preventive measures, flooding in 1980 caused 11 deaths and property damage in bordering cities. Flooding due to high rainfall and sewage blockage continues to be a concern that endangers surrounding areas because of the wastewater pollution found in the river.

===Nature reserves===
The Tijuana River National Estuarine Research Reserve protects and studies the Tijuana River Estuary. It was established as part of the National Estuarine Research Reserve system in the United States. The reserve is managed in part as a Biological Field Station by the San Diego State University (SDSU) College of Sciences, which also protects part of the estuary near the ocean within the United States.

The Tijuana Slough National Wildlife Refuge is part of the San Diego National Wildlife Refuge Complex, and is also within the Estuarine Research Reserve. The Tijuana Slough Refuge protects one of southern California&#x27;s largest remaining salt marshes without a road or railroad trestle running through it. Designated as a Globally Important Bird Area by the American Bird Conservancy, over 370 species of birds have been sighted on the refuge. Salmon have been recorded in the past in the river during runs.

==Wastewater==

The river has been used as a wastewater conduit since at least the early 20th century. As such, the issue of sewage in the Tijuana River predates other news stories about the Mexico–United States border within the San Diego–Tijuana region by several decades. Raw-sewage overflows on the Mexican side, from canyons along the river, are a recurring problem despite cross-border efforts to clean it up. In fact, they are the main source of pollution. In addition to sewage, trash is carried downstream causing damage to vegetation and contributing to flooding.

The first attempt to deal with sewage flowing into the Tijuana River was the creation of the International Outfall, a marine outfall, which was completed in 1939, but was proven to be inadequate as early as the late 1940s. By the 1950s, there were over 4 million gallons of sewage flowing into the river each day. Following a threat by the San Diego County&#x27;s health officer, Mexico began to treat its sewage with chlorine. Usage of the outfall ended in 1962 due to the completion of a pumping plant, which discharged untreated sewage into the Pacific Ocean; the pumping plant broke down in 1975. In the 1960s an emergency link from Tijuana into the San Diego Water System was created, by the mid-1980s it was taking in about 15 million gallons a day of sewage. During the 1970s, up to ten million gallons of sewage entered the river each day from Tijuana.

In 1980, Brian Bilbray, as Mayor of Imperial Beach, dammed the river with a skip loader to block the flow of sewage crossing the border. Partial progress was made in the 1980s with a Clean Water Grant from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency to improve wastewater treatment, by creating the San Diego-Tijuana Wastewater Treatment Plant to protect estuary waters. In 1988, the river was found to be the most polluted river on the Mexico–United States border. In April 1990, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency found lead and mercury in the waters of the Tijuana River watershed that exceeded multiple times U.S. standards, prompting fears of outbreaks of malaria and encephalitis. That same year in 1990, Mexico agreed to pay $41 million of the $192 million to construct the plant. The plant was completed in 1997. Water from the plant is discharged more than three miles offshore, but does not meet levels required by the Clean Water Act due to the lack of secondary treatment. Finished in January 2011, the plant received a $93 million upgrade. Other sewage that would have flowed into the Tijuana river is treated at the Punta Banderas treatment plant; it handles 30 million gallons of sewage a day. However, its discharge doesn&#x27;t meet Mexican water standards, sometimes causing closure of beaches as far north as Coronado.

Since 1993, the City of San Diego has renewed a state of emergency for the Tijuana River Valley due to ongoing issues with the Tijuana River. According to a 1993 report by the city of San Diego, the city had collected an average of 13 million gallons (50 million liters) per day of raw sewage, that then was treated by the Point Loma wastewater treatment plant; this is down from 20 million gallons per day in 1997 being treated by the city of San Diego, which it had received from Tijuana. Since 1998 the U.S. EPA has funded $42 million on sewage projects in Tijuana. In 2014, the &quot;San Diego Reader&quot; described the river as one of the most polluted parts of San Diego, with the beaches near the mouth of the river closed for 204 days in 2013. In 2015, the amount of sewage treated on a dry day remained the same, at 13 million gallons. However, when it rains, the amount of sewage can increase to 27 million gallons per day, and the pump which funnels water to the treatment plant is shut off so it isn&#x27;t overcome. Even when the flow is low, toxins, metals, solvents, pathogens, and sewage, end up becoming dust that can be breathed in and cause medical problems.

In January 2017, the Punta Banderas treatment plant, officially known as San Antonio de los Buenos plant, treated 15 million gallons of sewage a day to standards below U.S. secondary-level standards, pumping the water out into the Pacific Ocean at La Playa. Yet, in 2017, it was found by Proyecto Fronterizo de Educacion Ambiental that the release from the plant exceeded Mexico&#x27;s minimum federal standards on bacterial levels. While Tijuana&#x27;s sewage capture rate of 90% exceeds the Mexican national average of 50%, Roberto Espinosa of CILA is quoted as saying &quot;Tijuana is a complex city, and it has a sanitary system that has never kept pace with the increase in population,&quot;. Due to the sewage in the river, it has been called &quot;one of the most polluted waterways in the country&quot;. This has led to a multitude of beach closures in Imperial Beach. Each year the beach at Border Field State Park is closed for 233 days.

In February 2017, over 143 million gallons of sewage entered the river, larger than the usual few million gallons of sewage that is routine. Later, the amount of was revised upwards to over 200 million gallons. However, a Mexican water official claimed the spill was only 30 million gallons. The spill is the largest to occur in over ten years. The sewage spill was not initially reported by Mexican officials, but was noticed by residents on the South Bay coast. The impact of the spill affected waters as far north as Coronado, and was described by Imperial Beach Mayor Serge Dedina as &quot;a tsunami of sewage&quot;, and &quot;deliberate&quot;. According to the International Boundary Water Commission, the sewage discharge was due to a repair of a sewer pipe near Rio Alamar. The sewage was first noticed in the middle of the month. Repairs of the sewer pipe were completed in late February 2017, but the exact dates when the sewage began and stopped entering the river were unknown as of March 2017, leading to calls for an investigation. By mid-March 2017, the California Department of Environmental Health found the water quality had returned to within health standards, opening beaches up to Coronado. In mid 2017, Border Patrol agents reported sewage flowing into the Tijuana River from Smuggler&#x27;s Gulch, and Goat and Yogurt Canyons. In all of 2017, beaches near the Tijuana River were closed for 167 days.

In February 2018, following the shutting off of a CILA pump station, a 15 million gallon sewage spill entered the Tijuana River. In March 2018, Customs and Border Protection began to search for solutions to the sewage issue, after more than six dozen Border Patrol agents were negatively impacted by their contact with sewage in the Tijuana River Valley; this included taking water and soil samples to assess the contamination levels which exist in waters and areas around the Tijuana River watershed. In March 2018, a bi-partisan delegation of San Diego County&#x27;s members of the United States House of Representatives wrote a letter to the Office of the Inspector General of the Department of State, to investigate cross-border sewage spills. In April 2018, an earthen berm was constructed at the border across the Tijuana River, to stop sewage from flowing into the United States. In July 2018, environmental groups from Mexico and the United States made a criminal complaint regarding dumping of sewage into the Tijuana River against the state of Baja California. For a week in December 2018, 6-7 million gallons of sewage flowed into the Tijuana River due to a failure of a sewage main in Tijuana.

In early 2019, following seasonal storms sewage from the Tijuana River flowed out of the Tijuana River Estuary, leading to beach closures in South Bay, San Diego. In February 2019, testing revealed significant pollutants flowing northward from Tijuana including DDT, hexavalent chromium, pathogens, and carcinogens. In March 2019, the continuing sewage issue was highlighted by a story appearing in &quot;Vice News&quot;, where it was referred to as an &quot;environmental disaster&quot;. In mid 2019, it was proposed that all water flowing northward on the Tijuana River be diverted and processed at the San Diego-Tijuana Wastewater Treatment Plant. By late June, over of sewage had spilled into the Tijuana River in 2019. In early September 2019, an additional of contaminated water flowed into the Tijuana River, leading to continued beach closures. In early February 2020, over of sewage flowed into the Tijuana River.

For decades citizens from both San Diego and Tijuana have fallen sick due to the sewage flowing into local beaches. The most recent data showed that over 34,000 people in 2017 got sickened by the pollution and sewage in Imperial Beach according to a study that a University of California San Diego professor did. An estimated 13 billion gallons of polluted water from the Tijuana River have entered the oceans since Dec. 28, 2022, according to a UCSD statement. For years, public health officials say they have sampled beach waters of south San Diego County for fecal microbes, getting counts as an indicator for pathogens such as enterococcus, E. Coli, salmonella and MRSA. Exposure to such germs and viruses may lead to diarrhea, vomiting, fever, headaches, respiratory illness, infections, rashes and meningitis. From 2018 to 2024, more than of wastewater have flowed from Mexico into the United States via the Tijuana River according to the International Boundary and Water Commission.

===2018 lawsuits===
In March 2018, due to sewage in the Tijuana River, Chula Vista, Imperial Beach, and the Port of San Diego sued the International Boundary Water Commission. In response to the lawsuits, Mexico pledged $4.3 million towards Tijuana River cleanup; part of these funds will be used to replace deteriorating pipe in Tijuana that parallels the Tijuana River, which if it fails could release 4 million gallons of sewage a day into the river. In May 2018, California and the San Diego Regional Water Quality Control Board also created a lawsuit against the International Boundary Water Commission for sewage in the Tijuana River. In July 2018, Surfrider Foundation made an additional lawsuit regarding sewage in the Tijuana River. In August 2018, Judge Jeffrey T. Miller ruled that lawsuits based on the Clean Water Act could proceed, but that lawsuits based on the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act would be dismissed. In January 2019, the City of San Diego joined the lawsuit against the International Boundary Water Commission.

===21st-century water improvement agreements===

Over 30 federal, local, state, private and other interested groups want to develop binational long-term goals to address wastewater treatment and debris-related improvements. One major initiative introduced in the United States on March 16, 2015, was Resolution R902015-0035, a Five-Year Action Plan that aimed to implement restorative projects over the span of five-years. The resolution was initially introduced by the Tijuana River Valley Recovery Team (TRVRT) whose ultimate goal is to progress and implement strategies originally introduced in January 2012, under the Tijuana River Valley Recovery Strategy regulatory measures. Other restorative measures across the U.S. include grants like the Community-based Marine Debris Removal Grant that brings organizations together in conjunction with community-based cleanups to remove trash and debris from the Tijuana River Valley. The debris removal grant began in 2014 and successfully removed over 400 tons of debris by 2016. A binational discussion on July 28, 2016, established upcoming proposed projects between the Border 2020 Tijuana River Watershed Task Force and the Tijuana River Valley Recovery Team. These discussions continue the national environmental resolutions agreement under the 1983 La Paz Agreement that acknowledges the environmental and social responsibility of each country near its border regions. Under this treaty each country is under agreement to conserve, protect, and improve border regions for the overall well-being of the coinciding countries.

In 2020, the United States–Mexico–Canada Agreement was ratified providing $300,000,000 for abating water pollution in the Tijuana River. A significant amount of the money will be spent on improving the International Boundary Wastewater Treatment Plant. In addition, funding was increased to the North American Development Bank, to funding environmental projects elsewhere on the Mexico–United States border.
==Crime==
The construction of the Mexico–United States barrier in the area around and crossing the Tijuana River, began with construction of a fence made of Marston Mat in 1989, followed by construction of a secondary fence beginning in 1996. Due to the fences, the amount of illegal entry into the United States along the border south of the Tijuana River has been significantly reduced.

Areas of the Tijuana River canal are home to individuals described as &quot;ñongo&quot;. In March 2015, a homeless encampment was removed from the Tijuana River canal, some of whom had previously been deported from the United States; a year later, some of those who had been removed from the Tijuana River canal had returned and began to live in tunnels which drain into the canal. Tijuana is a major resettling location for Mexicans deported from the United States, with some living on the Tijuana River canal. A 2016 study found that the Tijuana River Canal was a known site for where people inject drugs. In 2018, more than 20 bodies were found in or near the Tijuana River, on the Mexico side.

The Tijuana River has not been off limits to the impact of the Mexican Drug War; in one instance in June 2006 the severed heads of three Rosarito Beach police officers were found in the Tijuana River.
==Recreation==
===Parks===
The Tijuana River Valley Regional Park is located in the Tijuana River Valley district of San Diego. It protects over , including dense riparian forests along the Tijuana River. It has an extensive system of trails for walking and equestrian access. In early 2019, construction of a campground within the regional park was approved at an expected cost of $8.3 million. As of April 2021, the campground is active and offers sites for tent campers, RVers, and yurts.

===Surfing===
The mouth of the Tijuana River is the location of the Tijuana Sloughs big-wave surfing break, which is a mile off shore. Winter waves can be as high as 12 feet or greater; 20 foot high waves are not unknown to occur. Surfing has been occurring at the slough since at least 1937, when Allen Holder began to surf there. It has been described as the &quot;gold standard&quot; in Southern California; with surfers using it as a training ground for surf found in Hawaii. Surfing at the Tijuana Sloughs is written to be similar to surfing at Saunder&#x27;s Reef.

Surfing at the sloughs has impacted the evolution of surfing culture, as well as regional culture. Lifeguards have watched over the area since 1939. Sewage from the river impacts water quality, which can lead to surfers becoming ill; one source describes that area as &quot;virtually unsurfable due to pollution.&quot;

<doc id="761778" wikidata="Q2553140" url="?curid=761778" title="Anthony Buckeridge">
<text>Anthony Malcolm Buckeridge (20 June 1912 – 28 June 2004) was an English author, best known for his &quot;Jennings&quot; and &quot;Rex Milligan&quot; series of children&#x27;s books. He also wrote the 1953 children&#x27;s book &quot;A Funny Thing Happened&quot; which was serialised more than once on &quot;Children&#x27;s Hour&quot;.

He was awarded the OBE in 2003.

==Personal life==
Buckeridge was born in Hendon in Middlesex, the son of Ernest George Buckeridge and his wife, Gertrude Alice (formerly Smith), but, following the death of his bank secretary father in World War I, he moved with his mother to Ross-on-Wye to live with his grandparents. Following the end of the war they returned to London where the young Buckeridge developed a taste for theatre and writing. A scholarship from the Bank Clerks&#x27; Orphanage fund permitted his mother to send him to Seaford College boarding school which, at the time, was located at Corsica Hall in Seaford, East Sussex. His experiences as a schoolboy there were instrumental in his later work.

Following the death of Buckeridge&#x27;s maternal grandfather, the family moved to Welwyn Garden City where his mother worked in promoting the new suburban utopia to Londoners. In 1930 Buckeridge began work at his late father&#x27;s bank but soon tired of it. Instead he took to acting including an uncredited part in Anthony Asquith&#x27;s 1931 film &quot;Tell England&quot;.

After marrying his first wife, Sylvia Brown, he enrolled at University College London where he involved himself in Socialist and anti-war groups (he later became an active member of CND) but did not take a degree after failing Latin. With a young family to support, Buckeridge found himself teaching in Suffolk and Northamptonshire which provided further experiences to influence his later work. During World War II Buckeridge was called up as a fireman and wrote several plays for the stage before returning to teaching at St Lawrence College, Ramsgate.

He used to tell his pupils stories about the fictional Jennings (based, however, on an old schoolfellow Diarmaid Jennings), a prep schoolboy boarding at Linbury Court Preparatory School, under headmaster Mr Pemberton-Oakes.

In 1962, he met his second wife, Eileen Selby. They settled near Lewes where Buckeridge continued to write and also appeared in small (non-singing) roles at Glyndebourne.

Buckeridge died on 28 June 2004 after a spell of ill health. He is survived by his second wife Eileen and three children, two from his first marriage.

==Works==

After World War II Buckeridge wrote a series of radio plays for the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Children&#x27;s Hour&quot; chronicling the exploits of Jennings and his rather more staid friend, Darbishire; the first, &quot;Jennings Learns the Ropes&quot;, was first broadcast on 16 October 1948. In 1950, the first of more than twenty novels, &quot;Jennings Goes to School&quot;, appeared. The tales make liberal use of Buckeridge&#x27;s inventive schoolboy slang (&quot;fossilised fish hooks!&quot;, &quot;crystallised cheesecakes!&quot;, and others). These books, as well known as Frank Richards&#x27; Billy Bunter books in their day, were translated into a number of other languages. The stories of middle-class English schoolboys were especially popular in Norway where several were filmed.

The Norwegian books and films were rewritten completely for a Norwegian setting with Norwegian names; Jennings is called &quot;Stompa&quot; in the Norwegian books.

More recently, the first four books were published in an omnibus edition by Prion, &quot;The Best of Jennings: Four Utterly Wizard Adventures All Jolly Well Complete and Unabridged&quot; (2010). In 2011, six titles were produced as unabridged audio books.

==Reception==

Buckeridge made no small contribution to postwar British humour, a fact acknowledged by such comedians as Stephen Fry. The deftly-worded farce and delightful understatement of his narratives has been compared to the work of P. G. Wodehouse, Ben Hecht and Ben Travers.

==Jennings novels==

The &quot;Jennings&quot; series is a collection of humorous novels of children&#x27;s literature. There are 24 in total. The first, &quot;Jennings Goes to School&quot; (), appeared in 1950 and new titles were published regularly until the mid-1970s (the last for fourteen years was &quot;Jennings at Large&quot; in 1977, the only book to feature Jennings during the school holidays), with two more in the 1990s (&quot;Jennings Again&quot; in 1991 and &quot;That&#x27;s Jennings&quot; in 1994). As well as the name change to Stompa in Norway, in France &quot;Jennings&quot; was changed to Bennett and in Germany to Freddy.

The novels usually followed a format of three major subplots per 16-chapter novel, the early books being derived from the popular BBC radio series on &quot;Children&#x27;s Hour&quot;. All 62 of the original radio play scripts have been published in 10 volumes by David Schutte: Jennings Sounds the Alarm 1999; Jennings Breaks the Record 2000; Jennings Joins the Search Party 2001; Jennings to the Rescue 2002; Jennings and the Roman Remains 2002; Jennings and the Tricky Predicament 2003; Jennings and the Organised Outing 2004; Jennings and the Christmas Spirit 2004; Jennings and the Key to the Mystery 2004; and Jennings and the Unconsidered Trifles 2004.

==Rex Milligan==

Rex Milligan is a fictional character created by Anthony Buckeridge, and is the eponymous schoolboy hero of a series of five books set in the mid 20th century. The school that he attends is a grammar school named Sheldrake Grammar School in North London. The stories are presented in first person narrative, in contrast to the Jennings series. The final book is a compilation of 16 stories first published in the best-selling &quot;Eagle&quot; comic.

===Characters===
*J.I.G. (Jigger) Johnson. Red-haired, level-headed, animal-loving best friend of Rex.
*&#x27;Alfie&#x27; Cutforth (Alfie, short for alphabet, because his initials are A.B.C). Loud-mouthed know-all.
*J.O. Stagg (Staggers). Inventor of ambitious, but ultimately unworkable gadgets.
*Boko Phipps. A little slow on the rugby field, but good at Maths – and even better at doing impersonations of the Maths teacher (see below).
*Mr. Birkinshaw, aka &#x27;Old Birkie&#x27;, or &#x27;The Birk&#x27;. Teacher short of temper, much in the mould of Mr. Wilkins from Jennings, who teaches Maths.
*Mr. Frisby, aka &#x27;The Frizzer&#x27;, a teacher mild in manner who teaches French and English. Well liked and respected by the pupils, even if his banter is, in Milligan&#x27;s words, &quot;a bit Form One-ish, if you know what I mean&quot;. The Frizzer possesses an interesting, if rather unreliable, old-fashioned car, which features prominently in &#x27;Rex Milligan&#x27;s Busy Term&#x27;.
*Mr. R.G. Hunter, The Headmaster, aka &#x27;The Head-Hunter&#x27;. Firm but fair Head, a former Middlesex cricketer and athletics champion, whose speeches are often rather long-winded, but nevertheless very well respected by staff and pupils alike.
*Mr. Stanton. Easy-going and well-respected games teacher, who always treats pupils just as they deserve.
*Spikey Andrews, football captain for Sheldrake&#x27;s deadly rival school, &quot;the Secondary Tech&quot;.
*Bubblegum Tucker, another pupil at the Secondary Tech.
*Mr Howard, aka &#x27;Old Snorker&#x27;, teacher at the Secondary Tech.
*Mr P.V. Lindgrun. Slimy and crooked owner of the nearby Premier Garage – he features prominently in &#x27;Rex Milligan&#x27;s Busy Term&#x27;.

==Other works==
As well as the standalone 1953 children&#x27;s book &quot;A Funny Thing Happened&quot;, Buckeridge also wrote a serial, &#x27;Liz&#x27;, for the BBC Radio 4 children&#x27;s omnibus programme &#x27;4th Dimension&#x27;, broadcast in 6 parts in May and June 1974.

<text>Kage Baker (June 10, 1952 – January 31, 2010) was an American science fiction and fantasy writer.

== Biography ==
Baker was born and raised in Hollywood, California, and lived in Pismo Beach later in life. Before becoming a professional writer she spent many years in theater, including teaching Elizabethan English as a second language. Her unusual first name (pronounced like the word &quot;cage&quot;) is a combination of the names of her two grandmothers, Kate and Genevieve. Baker had Asperger syndrome.

She is best known for her &quot;the Company/Dr. Zeus, Inc.&quot; series of historical time travel science fiction. Her first stories were published in &quot;Asimov&#x27;s Science Fiction&quot; in 1997, and her first novel, &quot;In the Garden of Iden&quot;, by Hodder &amp; Stoughton in the same year. Other notable works include &quot;Mendoza in Hollywood&quot; (novel, 2000) and &quot;The Empress of Mars&quot; (novella, 2003), which won the Theodore Sturgeon Award and was nominated for a Hugo Award.

In 2008, she donated her archive to the department of Rare Books and Special Collections at Northern Illinois University.

In 2009, her short story &quot;Caverns of Mystery&quot; and her novel &quot;House of the Stag&quot; were both nominated for World Fantasy Awards; neither piece won.

In January 2010, it was reported that Baker was seriously ill with cancer. She died from uterine cancer on January 31, 2010, in Pismo Beach, California.

In 2010, Baker&#x27;s &quot;The Women of Nell Gwynne&#x27;s&quot; was nominated for a Hugo Award and a World Fantasy Award in the Best Novella categories. On May 15, 2010, that work was awarded the 2009 Nebula Award in the Best Novella category.

Kage spent much of the last year of her life watching and reviewing silent films. Many of her reviews were collected posthumously into &quot;Ancient Rockets: Treasures and Trainwrecks of the Silent Screen&quot; (2011), edited by her sister Kathleen Bartholomew. From the foreword:

Baker left an unfinished novel, &quot;Nell Gwynne&#x27;s On Land and At Sea&quot;, which was completed by her sister Kathleen Bartholomew based on extensive notes left by Baker, and was published in 2012.

<doc id="761780" wikidata="Q16154748" url="?curid=761780" title="Brisk tradition and Soloveitchik dynasty">
<text>The Soloveitchik dynasty of rabbinic scholars and their students originated the Brisker method of Talmudic study, which is embraced by their followers in the Brisk yeshivas. It is so called because of the Soloveitchiks&#x27; origin in the town of Brisk, or Brest-Litovsk, located in what is now Belarus. Many of the first Soloveitchik rabbis were the official rabbis of Brisk, and each in turn was known as &quot;the Brisker Rov&quot;. Today, Brisk refers to several yeshivas in Israel and the United States founded by members of the Soloveitchik family, including the yeshivas of R’ Avraham Yehousua Soloveitchik and the late R’ Dovid Soloveitchik, among others.

==The Soloveitchik dynasty==
The Soloveitchik family includes many significant rabbinical forebears, such as Simcha Rappaport and Chaim of Volozhin, famed Talmudist and founder of the Volozhin yeshiva. Chaim of Volozhin was a student of the Vilna Gaon.

The Soloveitchik dynasty began with Rabbi Yosef Dov Soloveitchik known as the &quot;Beis HaLevi&quot;. More significantly, the &quot;Brisker style&quot; described below can already be found to some degree in the Beis HaLevi&#x27;s works, which is not the case for earlier ancestors.

All members of the Soloveitchik family are descended from the Tribe of Levi and thus sometimes go by the descriptor &quot;HaLevi&quot;. The surname &quot;Soloveitchik&quot; comes from the word for nightingale in Slavic languages; it was chosen by the family because the primary duty of the Levites in the Temple in Jerusalem was singing.

===The Beis HaLevi===

Rabbi Yosef Dov Soloveitchik (1820–1892) served as rabbi of Brisk for much of his life. His works on the &quot;Mishneh Torah&quot; and first five books of the Hebrew Bible which he authored were titled &quot;Beis HaLevi&quot; (Hebrew for &quot;House of the Levites&quot;). Many people therefore refer to him simply as the Beis HaLevi, which also avoids the confusion with two of his prominent great-grandsons who shared the same full name: (1) Rabbi Moshe Soloveichik&#x27;s son, Rabbi Joseph Soloveitchik (1903–1993) who moved to the United States; and (2) Rabbi Yitzchak Zev Soloveitchik&#x27;s son, Rabbi Berel Soloveitchik, who lived in Israel.

Soloveitchik succeeded Rabbi Yehoshua Leib Diskin as rabbi of Brisk when the latter moved to Jerusalem in 1876. He had previously served as the rabbi of Slutzk, and before that, on the faculty of the Volozhin yeshiva.

===Rabbi Chaim Soloveitchik===

The &quot;Beis HaLevi&quot; was succeeded as rabbi of Brisk by his son, Rabbi Chaim Soloveitchik (1853–1918). He is most commonly known as &quot;Reb Chaim Brisker&quot; (Rabbi Chaim from Brisk) where he implemented an analytic method of studying Talmud that focuses on precise definition/s and categorization/s of Jewish law . His primary work was &quot;Chidushei Rav Chaim HaLevi&quot;, a volume of insights on the &quot;Mishneh Torah&quot; which often would suggest novel understandings of the Talmud as well. He had three sons, Yitzchak Zev and Moshe and his oldest, Yisroel Gershon.

===Rabbi Yitzchok Zev Soloveitchik===

Rabbi Yitzchok Zev Soloveitchik became known as &quot;The Brisker Rov&quot; when he succeeded his father as rabbi of Brisk. He was often known by the name &quot;Velvel, a Yiddish nickname for &quot;little wolf&quot;. (&quot;Zev&quot; is Hebrew for &quot;wolf&quot;.) He is also commonly known as the &quot;GRYZ&quot; or &quot;HaGRYZ,&quot; an acronym for (Ha)Gaon Rabbi Yitzchak Zev&quot;&#x27; (&quot;[the] genius Rabbi Isaac Wolf&quot;). He became famous enough that many people, however, refer to him simply as &quot;der Brisker Rov&quot; (&quot;the rabbi of Brisk&quot;). In fact, many in the Brisker yeshiva world in Israel refer to him simply as &quot;The Rov&quot;. (In the Modern Orthodox community, his nephew, Rabbi Joseph B. Soloveitchik, is referred to as &quot;the Rav&quot;.)

Like his father, Rabbi Yitzchok Zev Soloveitchik published works based on the &quot;Mishneh Torah&quot;, often suggesting novel insights on the Talmud in the process. He fled the Holocaust and moved to the British Mandate of Palestine. His children and grandchildren live in Israel today, and have founded several yeshivas there, all known as &quot;Brisk&quot;, based in Jerusalem.

===Rabbi Meshulam Dovid Soloveitchik===
Rabbi Meshulam Dovid Soloveitchik (known as Reb Dovid) was the son of Rabbi Yitzchak Zev Soloveitchik. He was rosh yeshiva of Yeshivas Brisk in the Gush Shemonim section of Jerusalem. Like his father and grandfather he published works based on Mishnah Torah, and many of his lectures have been published by his students. He was considered by Briskers to be one of the last authentic remnants of a pre-World War II Jewish Lithuania. His students include the late Rabbi Moshe Twersky Rebbi in Yeshivas Toras Moshe and Rabbi Yitzchok Lichtenstein Rosh Yeshiva of Yeshiva Torah Vodaas, both grandsons of his cousin Rabbi Joseph Ber Soloveitchik. He died on January 31, 2021, in Jerusalem, Israel.

===Rabbi Berel Soloveitchik===
Rabbi Berel Soloveitchik, commonly known simply as &quot;Reb Berel,&quot; was one of the leading Brisker Rosh Yeshivas in Jerusalem, Israel. He was the son of Rabbi Yitzchak Zev, the Brisker Rav, and the cousin of Rabbi Joseph Ber Soloveitchik. His son, Rav Avrohom Yehoshua, succeeds him as Rosh Yeshiva of Brisk in Jerusalem.

===Rabbi Meir Soloveitchik===
Rabbi Meir Soloveitchik was the son of Rabbi Yitzchak Zev Soloveitchik and headed one of the Brisker Yeshivas in Jerusalem, which was attended by many Torah scholars, including the current Radziner Rebbe, Grand Rabbi Moshe Leiner. He should not be confused with Rabbi Meir Soloveichik, the son of Rabbi Ahron Soloveichik&#x27;s son Rabbi Eliyahu Soloveichik. He died at the age of 87 on April 2, 2016.
his yeshiva is now headed by his son Rabbi Yechiel Soloveitchik together with his brother Rabbi Avrohom Soloveichick and another yeshiva by his son Reb Velvel and his brother

===Rabbi Velvel Soloveitchik II===
Rabbi Yitzchok Zev &quot;reb Velvel&quot; Soloveitchik is the son of Rav Meshulam Dovid, as well as his successor as Rosh HaYeshiva of Yeshivas brisk. He carries the name of his grandfather, The Brisker Rov.

===Rabbi Moshe Soloveichik===

Rabbi Chaim Soloveitchik&#x27;s other famous son was Rabbi Moshe Soloveichik. His works on the Rambam are known as the &quot;Chiddushei HaGram haLevi &quot; and &quot;Chiddushei haGram ve&#x27;haGrid.&quot; He served as the Rabbi of Rasseyn and then of Chaslavich. He then moved to Warsaw where he served as rosh yeshiva of Tachkemoni Rabbinical Seminary. He moved to America in 1929 and was appointed as a rosh yeshiva at Rabbi Isaac Elchanan Theological Seminary (RIETS). (While RIETS has at no point ever called itself a &quot;Brisk yeshiva&quot; per se, it was home for many decades to Rabbi Moshe Soloveichik and later his sons.) His sons were the famous Rabbi Joseph Soloveitchik, who lived in Boston and commuted to teach Talmud at Yeshiva University in Manhattan; Dr. Samuel Soloveichik, a chemist as well as a Talmudic scholar; and Rabbi Ahron Soloveichik, who taught at Mesivta Rabbi Chaim Berlin and then at Yeshiva University. Rav Ahron founded and was the rosh yeshiva of Yeshivas Brisk in Chicago, Illinois.

===Rabbi Joseph B. Soloveitchik===

Rabbi Joseph B. Soloveitchik was a son of Moshe Soloveichik. He succeeded his father as the senior Rosh Yeshiva of RIETS in New York. As he rose to become an important leader of Modern Orthodox Jewry, he ordained close to 2,000 rabbis over the course of almost half a century thereby strengthening his status as &quot;The Rav&quot;—as he was &#x27;the rabbis&#x27;s rabbi&#x27;. He began the day school movement when he established Maimonides School as one of the first Jewish day schools outside the New York area in 1937 after arriving in Boston with Tanya Levitt Soloveitchik in 1935 to be the mara d&#x27;atra of the greater Boston Jewish community. Today, Maimonides maintains many of the Rav&#x27;s radical educational posits including co-education and female Talmud study. He is often credited with being a primary founder of Modern Orthodoxy, a movement of Judaism which maintains that Jews must both practice a Halakhic life without shunning the outside world. He also gave much needed validity to the Zionist effort in his famous work &quot;Kol Dodi Dofek&quot;. Although he was primarily a brilliant Talmudist, his most famous works of &quot;Lonely Man of Faith&quot;, &quot;Catharsis&quot;, &quot;Halachic Man&quot;, and &quot;Uvikkashtem Misham&quot; are largely philosophical. A film called The Lonely Man of Faith: the Life and Legacy of Joseph B. Soloveitchik documents the Rav&#x27;s lifework and personality in greater detail.

===Rabbi Ahron Soloveichik===

Rabbi Ahron Soloveichik was a son of Rabbi Moshe Soloveitchik. He taught at Mesivta Rabbi Chaim Berlin and then at Yeshiva University. He eventually moved to Chicago and became rosh yeshiva at the Hebrew Theological College and in 1974 founded his own yeshiva Yeshivas Brisk of Chicago. After his brother Joseph became ill, beginning in 1986 he began to commute to New York City to lecture at RIETS as well. Rabbi Ahron Soloveichik died in 2001, and Yeshivas Brisk of Chicago became defunct a few years later as a Mesivta but remains active today as a Beth Medrash under Rabbi Ahron&#x27;s eldest son, Rabbi Moshe Soloveichik. His grandchildren include Rabbi Shmuel Marcus, philosopher Rabbi Dr. Meir Soloveichik, and political analyst Nechama Soloveichik. Rabbi Dr. David Applebaum was considered one of his most outstanding and devoted disciples.

==Philosophy==
===General===
In contrast to the Hasidic movement, all of the Soloveichik rabbis were a part of the Lithuanian yeshiva movement, and thus were strong believers in a traditional Talmudic education and, to a certain degree, intellect over emotion. However, Rabbi Yosef Dov Soloveitchik made it clear that he was very much in touch with Hasidism, having lived for several years in Chaslavich, which was mostly Hasidic.

===Halachic===
The &quot;Brisk dynasty&quot; and their followers (known as &quot;Briskers&quot;) are known for a tendency towards strictness in the Halacha (Jewish law); if there is ever a doubt between two rabbinic opinions, the &quot;Brisk way&quot; is more likely to follow the more stringent one. They maintain that we are unable to determine Halacha as following one opinion over another. They instead are stringent in the sense that they will look to fulfill the opinion of all early Halachic authorities. For example, many yeshiva students will not only not shave their payot (sidelocks), as required by the Torah, but will also let the entire area grow very long, which they tuck behind their ears- as required by certain early Halachic authorities. These are known as &quot;Brisker Peyos&quot;, or &quot;Briskers&quot;.

Following Reb Velvel (the &quot;Brisker Rav&quot;; see above), many Briskers in Israel are very stringent in ritual tithes (&quot;trumos uma&#x27;asros&quot; in Hebrew). They repeat the Krias Shema many times, each time with a different possible pronunciation, in order to make sure they fulfill the Biblical command.

===Talmudic===
The innovative Brisk, or &quot;conceptual&quot;, style of Talmudic analysis is described in the Brisker method article.

===Political===
A great deal of controversy has erupted regarding the political views of the rabbis of Brisk. Rabbi Yitzchak Zev Soloveitchik and his descendants, who settled in Israel, have made their opinion clear that they oppose a secular Zionist state and thus show no support for the Israeli government. They do not follow anyone&#x27;s lead and decide their opinions regarding the state on a case to case basis, therefore avoiding joining any political faction, including those who are anti Zionist, preferring to make an informed decision on their every interaction necessary with the state. Generally, they do not support the state but nor do they support the political anti Zionist bias. For example, they do not accept any money from the Israeli government. They are also opposed to yeshiva students having a secular college education. Turning to their forebears, Rabbi Chaim Brisker is quoted with some harsh statements against Zionism, though he lived in an era when Haredi anti-Zionism was far more prevalent. Generally speaking, however, they are viewed as the true heirs to the Brisker opinion on this matter.

In contrast, most of the Soloveitchiks who moved to the United States, including Rabbi Joseph Soloveitchik and his brother Rabbi Aaron Soloveitchik, were very supportive of the State of Israel, as well as what they perceive as a well-rounded college education. They were far more supportive than the general ultra-Orthodox American Jewry. Rabbi Joseph Soloveitchik became the accepted leader of the Modern Orthodox movement, with the yeshiva he headed, Yeshiva University, becoming the Modern Orthodox flagship institution. Rabbi Joseph Soloveitchik was the American head of Mizrachi, the organization of religious Zionists. His followers generally identify themselves with Mizrachi, and are strong supporters of the State of Israel. Rabbi Soloveitchik was even a candidate for Chief Rabbi of Tel Aviv at one point, but was outvoted by supporters for Rabbi Moshe Avigdor Amiel.

With regards to feminism, Rabbi Yosef Dov Soloveitchik was proud to point out that on his parents&#x27; wedding invitation, his grandparents are listed as &quot;Chaim &amp; Lifsha&quot; on one line, with &quot;Soloveitchik&quot; on the next line, centered between their names. This could be seen as more feminist than the &quot;Rabbi &amp; Mrs. So-And-So&quot; (or in Hebrew, &quot;Ploni BenPloni V&#x27;Rayaso&quot;) seen in many Haredi invitations today. However, in regard to feminism in areligiously accusing sense, i.e., where the Torah is questioned or accused of being incomplete or unfair, Rabbi Yosef Dov held that this was heresy, this outlook is quoted by many of his closest students.

Today, however, most adherents of the Israeli Soloveitchiks follow the general Israeli Haredi, i. e., strongly right-wing, worldview regarding women&#x27;s role in Jewish education and communal life. Rabbi Yosef Dov Soloveitchik, and many of his students and descendants, on the other hand, have been guardedly more open to opportunities for women, Rabbi Soloveitchik himself delivering the opening Talmud lecture at Yeshiva University&#x27;s Stern College for Women.

<doc id="761782" wikidata="Q7364047" url="?curid=761782" title="Ron Kuby">
<text>Ronald L. Kuby (born July 31, 1956) is an American criminal defense and civil rights lawyer, radio talk show host, and television commentator. He has hosted radio programs on WABC (AM) in New York City and Air America radio.

Kuby has defended many high-profile criminal cases, ever since his early career as a colleague of the activist William Kunstler. Kuby currently leads the Law Office of Ronald L. Kuby in Manhattan.

==Early life and education==
Kuby was born in Cleveland, Ohio, the son of Ruth Miller, a secretary, and Donald Kuby, a salesman. His mother was from a Jewish family and his father, who died in 1990, was a Franciscan friar who converted to Judaism and became a militant Zionist before becoming Christian again. Kuby&#x27;s parents divorced when he was five years old, after which he lived with his mother and grandparents. At 13, he joined the Jewish Defense League under the influence of his father, who was a follower of Meir David Kahane. As a teenager, Kuby emigrated to Israel, but returned to the U.S. after being disillusioned by what he describes as &quot;anti-Arab racism&quot;.

He returned to Cleveland and lived in a commune for the next several years. In 1973, he briefly attended an accredited alternative high school. After graduating, he attended Cleveland State University for one year.

Kuby dropped out of college in 1974 and moved to St. Croix, in the U.S. Virgin Islands, where he worked on a tugboat and developed an interest in West Indian ethnobotany and medicinal plants. He moved briefly to Maine, then to Kansas in 1975, where he completed his degrees in cultural anthropology and history at the University of Kansas. Kuby was a free-speech and anti-apartheid activist while at KU, where he graduated with highest distinction, had a 4.0 average, and conducted and published original fieldwork, including the 1979 &quot;Folk medicine on St. Croix: an ethnobotanical study&quot;, after returning to St. Croix several times. Kuby alleged the University of Kansas police intentionally broke his arm when they responded to an anti-apartheid protest during a commencement ceremony. Protesters were urging the KU Endowment Association to divest itself of investments in companies doing business in South Africa.

Kuby earned his Juris Doctor from Cornell Law School in 1983. Kuby claims his grades entitled him to a position on the prestigious &quot;Cornell Law Review&quot;, but he declined the invitation. He also claims to have graduated as one of the top students in his class.

==Personal life==
On January 23, 2006, Kuby married Marilyn Vasta, a psychotherapist and climate activist, on the 20th anniversary of their first date. They have one daughter, Emma Vasta-Kuby, who is a lawyer with the D.C.-based Second Look Project, working on de-incarceration.

==Partnership with William Kunstler==
While in college, Kuby interned with William Kunstler, a senior lawyer with 20 years&#x27; experience, notable for many of his sensational cases including the defense of the Chicago Seven. From 1983 until Kunstler&#x27;s death in 1995, Kuby worked as an unofficial partner in Kunstler&#x27;s law firm, with both men taking up &quot;the fight for the poor, the oppressed and the downtrodden&quot;. The two men declared they were not only colleagues, but best friends as well.

Kunstler and Kuby never formalized a partnership with a contract or tax filings. Despite a letterhead that read &quot;Kunstler and Kuby&quot;, Kuby was paid as an employee and never shared in the firm&#x27;s profits and losses. On this basis, Kuby was denied ownership rights to the firm&#x27;s case files, accounts, and name after Kunstler died, and Kunstler&#x27;s widow, Margaret Ratner, put her late husband&#x27;s archives under lock and key. Kuby filed a complaint against her with the attorney disciplinary committee; the committee dismissed the complaint in August 1996. In December 1996, a court case brought by Ratner to restrain Kuby from using the name &quot;Kunstler &amp; Kuby&quot; resulted in Kuby&#x27;s being denied any rights in the Kunstler firm.

==Notable cases==
===With Kunstler===
Kuby, with Kunstler, represented many high-profile defendants:

Gregory Lee Johnson, a protester who burned a U.S. Flag at the 1984 Republican National Convention.

Sheikh Omar Abdel-Rahman, the blind cleric who headed the Egyptian-based militant group Al-Gama&#x27;a al-Islamiyya, accused of planning and encouraging terrorist attacks against Americans.

Colin Ferguson, the man responsible for the 1993 Long Island Rail Road shooting (who chose to represent himself at trial).

Nico Minardos, the Hollywood TV and movie actor, accused in an FBI sting operation of conspiracy to ship arms to Iran.

Qubilah Shabazz, the daughter of Malcolm X, accused of plotting to murder Louis Farrakhan of the Nation of Islam.

Glenn Harris, a New York City public school teacher who absconded with a 15-year-old girl for two months.

Yu Kikumura, a member of the Japanese Red Army, and associates of the Gambino Crime Family.

During the Gulf War, Kunstler and Kuby represented American soldiers claiming conscientious objector status. They also represented El Sayyid Nosair, assassin of the late Rabbi Meir Kahane whom Kuby&#x27;s father had admired, and the leftist radical turned health-care activist Dr. Alan Berkman.

===After Kunstler&#x27;s death===
After Kunstler&#x27;s death, Kuby continued the work of his late mentor. In 1996, he won a judgment of $43 million for Darrell Cabey against Bernhard Goetz in connection with the 1984 New York City Subway shooting. Kuby also won nearly a million dollars for members of the Hells Angels motorcycle club who were wrongfully arrested by the New York City Police Department. He secured a reversal of a murder conviction for a mentally ill homeless man whose candle accidentally caused the death of a firefighter. Kuby represented the appeal of Yusef Salaam, whose conviction in the 1989 Central Park jogger case was overturned in 2002, and who went on to be elected to the New York City Council. In 2005, Kuby won close to a million dollars for another wrongfully convicted man who spent eight years in prison.

In 2006, Kuby was subpoenaed by the defense to testify at the second trial of John A. Gotti, the son of Gambino crime family leader John Gotti, which included charges for the kidnapping and attempted murder of Curtis Sliwa, Kuby&#x27;s talk radio co-host at the time. Kuby testified that in a 1998 conversation, Gotti said he had wanted to leave organized crime. &quot;He told me he was sick of this life&quot;, Kuby told the court. &quot;He wanted to rejoin his family and be done with this.&quot; Sliwa reacted angrily to his longtime co-host&#x27;s testimony for the defense, calling him a &quot;Judas&quot;, though Kuby was following the law by answering a subpoena to testify.

In April 2009, Kuby spoke about the capture of Abduwali Muse, a Somali teenager apprehended during the rescue of Richard Phillips, the Captain of the MV &quot;Maersk Alabama&quot;, a freighter briefly captured by Somali pirates. Kuby said he was discussing organizing a team to defend Muse, suggesting he was invalidly captured while immunized by a flag of truce.

In September 2009, Kuby appeared on behalf of Ahmad Wais Afzali, an imam facing multiple charges in a terrorism-related case. Afzali had told Najibullah Zazi that authorities were asking questions about him. Kuby won Afzali&#x27;s release on bail and negotiated a plea bargain to a reduced charge of lying to agents, with deportation in lieu of imprisonment.

In 2010, Kuby defended Raphael Golb, the son of a biblical scholar. Golb had sent emails wherein he impersonated critics of his father and falsely admitted committing various defamatory acts, including academic fraud; he was arrested in 2009. Charged with multiple felonies and misdemeanors, Golb was convicted at trial and appealed to New York&#x27;s Supreme Court, which affirmed the charges. Golb then appealed to the New York Court of Appeals, the highest court in New York State. They dismissed some of Golb&#x27;s convictions, such as identify theft and aggravated harassment (striking down the latter as unconstitutionally vague and overbroad), but they upheld others, including criminal impersonation and forgery.

Starting in 2000, Kuby began working to exonerate innocent prisoners in non-DNA cases. He won the 2001 release (followed by a combined $3.3 million judgment) for Anthony Faison and Charles Shepherd, who served close to 14 years for a murder they did not commit. The actual killer was subsequently caught and plead guilty. In 2008, Kuby exonerated Michael Clancy, an elevator mechanic wrongfully convicted of murder in the Bronx. Clancy served 13 years. The actual killer was subsequently indicted, having been named by a federal informant, but was not prosecuted successfully due to the Bronx DA&#x27;s wrongful conviction of Clancy. In 2013, Kuby won the exoneration of Thomas Green, serving 35 years for child sexual assault and rape. All of the prosecution&#x27;s evidence was proved to be false, and Green was released after five years. His time in the prison system left him with undiagnosed and untreated cancer; he died two weeks after his release. In 2013, Kuby took on the case of Johnny Hincapie, wrongfully convicted in the infamous Brian Watkins subway murder case. After 25 years in prison, Hincapie was exonerated.

In 2015, Kuby secured the exoneration of Shabaka Shakur, who served 27 years of a 40 to life sentence for two murders that he did not commit. Shakur began his case &quot;pro se&quot; in 2012, and Kuby agreed to represent him &quot;pro bono&quot; later that year. The evidence against Shakur consisted largely of an uncorroborated confession allegedly given to Detective Louis Scarcella. Kuby had faced Scarcella in 1996 in the high-profile &quot;Money Train&quot; case. Scarcella&#x27;s testimony in that case led Kuby to believe that the much-decorated detective perjured himself and suborned perjury through witness manipulation. The judge who exonerated Shakur found there was a reasonable likelihood that Scarcella had fabricated the confession.

Exonerations in two other Scarcella cases quickly followed, based upon Scarcella&#x27;s misconduct. Jabbar Washington was freed in July 2017 after 20 years in prison, as a result of a joint investigation with Kuby and the Brooklyn DA&#x27;s Conviction Review Unit. Sundhe Moses, who spent almost 20 years in prison for another high-profile murder, was exonerated after extensive hearings concluded in January 2018. In October 2020, Kuby and the CRU exonerated another innocent man, Gerard Domond, who spent 27 years behind bars due to the prosecution&#x27;s withholding of crucial exculpatory evidence. On July 15, 2022, one of Scarcella&#x27;s biggest cases, the &quot;Money Train&quot; murder, was overturned and charges dismissed against three men, Thomas Malik, Vincent Ellerbe, and James Irons, all of whom served over two decades in prison. The exonerations were the culmination of almost ten years of re-investigation by Kuby and the CRU. In January 2023, a Brooklyn judge vacated a murder conviction against Kareem Mayo, who had served 23 years of a 25 to life sentence, along with his cousin, Donnell Perkins (represented by Joel Rudin). The decision followed six months of hearings on newly discovered evidence.

In keeping with Kunstler&#x27;s tradition of representing political defendants, often subjected to show trials, Kuby and associate Rhiya Trivedi represented Patricia Okoumou, who famously climbed the Statue of Liberty on July 4, 2018, protesting family separation policies of the Trump Administration. Kuby and Trivedi also represented the environmental lawyer Steven Donziger in his 2021 trial for criminal contempt for failing to turn over sensitive materials to Chevron Corporation.

==Radio and television personality==
From 1999 to 2007, Kuby and Curtis Sliwa co-hosted a daily radio show titled &quot;Curtis and Kuby in the Morning&quot; on WABC (AM), in New York City. After an eight-year run, WABC replaced the show with Don Imus and retained Sliwa. Kuby and Sliwa then shared a short-lived midday television program on MSNBC. Kuby began broadcasting on Air America Radio in 2008, at first as a replacement for Randi Rhodes, then later with a regular show, &quot;Doing Time with Ron Kuby&quot;. In May 2009 Air America moved Kuby&#x27;s show to a new time slot, which took him off of the schedule for many affiliates. By June, his show was removed from Air America&#x27;s schedule.

On January 2, 2014, &quot;Curtis and Kuby&quot; returned to WABC in the 12–3pm (Eastern) timeslot. He was released from WABC in late May 2017 for budgetary reasons.

Kuby is a frequent pundit and substitute anchor on Court TV and has appeared several times on the Discovery Channel program&quot; Oddities&quot;, offering legal advice.

On May 16, 2008, he was interviewed on the WBGO program &quot;Conversations with Allan Wolper&quot;. Kuby discussed how the media sometimes convicts criminal suspects in the court of public opinion.

Unlike defense lawyers who usually suppress specifics about their residence, family, and habits, Kuby agreed in 2012 to be featured in the weekly &quot;New York Times&quot; &quot;Sunday Routine&quot; photo report on prominent or colorful New Yorkers.

Kuby was featured in the 2019 podcast &quot;The Ballad of Billy Balls&quot;, which dealt with the murder of William Heitzman at the hands of the NYPD in June 1982.

<doc id="761785" wikidata="Q2069824" url="?curid=761785" title="Pepys Island">
<text>Pepys Island is a phantom island, once said to lie about north of the Falkland Islands at 47°S. Pepys Island is now believed to have been a misidentified account of the Falkland Islands.

==Original identification==
In December 1683 the British corsair William Ambrose Cowle(y), master of the &quot;Bachelor&#x27;s Delight&quot;, a ship of 40 guns proceeding on a circumnavigation of the globe, discovered at a latitude stated as 47°S a previously uncharted and unpopulated island in the South Atlantic which he named &quot;Pepys Island&quot;, for Samuel Pepys, Secretary to the Admiralty. His companion on the voyage, William Dampier, considered the sighting to be the &quot;Sebaldinas Islands&quot;, an alternative name at the time for the Falklands. Cowle&#x27;s log entry reads:

:We continued to the SW to 47°S where we saw an unknown and uninhabited island which I named Pepys. It is a good place for fresh water and tinder. Its harbour is excellent with safe anchorage for a thousand ships. We saw an enormous number of birds on this island and we believe that there will be abundant fishing around its coasts, for they are surrounded by a bottom of sand and shingle.

There is a later manuscript elaborating the log entry:

:Jan 1683. In this month we arrived at latitude 47°40′S and noticed an island to our west with the wind ENE. We headed towards it but as it was very late to approach the coast spent the night off the cape. The island had a pleasant aspect: there were woods, one might even say it was totally wooded. To the east of the island was a rock on which there were a large number of birds the size of small ducks. Our crew hunted them as our ship passed by and killed as many as we needed for food: they were quite tasty but spoiled by the fishy flavour.
:I put the bow to the south and sailed round the island. On the SW coast I found a comfortable harbour to anchor. I wanted to put out a pinnace to reconnoitre but the wind was blowing so fiercely that it would have been dangerous. Continuing on the same course while sounding we measured depths of 26 and 27 fathoms except where we found much seawood adrift, and here we sounded only seven fathoms.
:We feared stopping for long in shallows with a seabed of shingle, but the harbour was vast, able to accommodate at least 500 ships. Its entrance was narrow and we found no great depth in the northern part, but without doubt ships can enter without danger at the southern end because the bottom is deeper there: however it would be necessary to find a channel with sufficient water at all states of the tide for ships to enter.
:I should have liked to have spent the night in the lee of the island but the purpose of my voyage was not to make discoveries. That same afternoon we saw another island which made me think that perhaps these were the Sebaldes. We then sailed WSW, a corrected course for the SW because the needle was off by 22° to the east.

==Later attempts to locate the island==
The original official historian of record, Pedro de Angelis, wrote in 1839 that this was so far north of the Falklands it was &quot;absurd&quot; to think that an experienced navigator could have made such an error as to put himself four degrees of latitude more northerly, and in high summer. Many expeditions attempted unsuccessfully to locate the island during the eighteenth century. These included: Lord Anson (1740–1744 voyage), Commodore Byron (1764), Captain Cook (both voyages), Joseph Banks and Daniel Solander (1769), Antoine-Joseph Pernety (1763–1764), Louis de Bougainville (1763-1769 voyages), Jean-François de Galaup, comte de Lapérouse (1785, searching for &quot;The Great Island&quot;) and George Vancouver (1790-1795 voyages, also searching for &quot;The Great Island&quot;). In the reports of Byron, Cook and Bougainville all found themselves in thick sargasso with large flocks of birds overhead. They were searching 80 to 85 leagues both east of the Patagonian coast and north of the Falklands (from 1630–1840 a Spanish league measured three nautical miles) and these may be considered sure signs of the proximity of land. La Pérouse mentioned the seaweed and identified the flocks of birds as albatross and petrels which never approach land except to lay their eggs.

In conclusion to his 1839 introduction to the work of reference, Pedro de Angelis noted that the report of a mercantile master returning to Montevideo from the Falklands came to the attention of the Spanish Minister, who consulted with Don Jorge Juan, head of the Department of the Navy. They identified Pepys Island as being synonymous with Puig, a phantom island sought by the French and known as &quot;the Great Island&quot;. This was based on three documents: Cowle&#x27;s sketch, Puig Island as sketched by the mercantile captain and a plan &quot;of unimpeachable provenance&quot; which he does not name. De Angelis concluded: &quot;In view of the explicit statements made by those who have actually visited the island, those who deny its existence lack authenticity.&quot;

The modern editor of the work of reference, Professor Pesatti, dissents from Pedro de Angelis, particularly on the basis of Cowle&#x27;s sketch, a document which unfortunately he fails to produce in evidence: &quot;The description of the island coincides in almost all details to the Falklands, and a sketch map by Cowle represents exactly the alignment of these islands with the central strait which divides them.&quot;

<text>The Blob is a 1958 American science fiction horror film directed by Irvin S. Yeaworth Jr. from a screenplay by Theodore Simonson and Kate Phillips, based on an idea by Irving H. Millgate. It stars Steve McQueen (in his first leading role) and Aneta Corsaut and co-stars Earl Rowe and Olin Howland.

The film concerns a carnivorous amoeboidal alien that crashes to Earth from outer space inside a meteorite, landing near the small communities of Phoenixville and Downingtown, Pennsylvania. It envelops living beings, growing larger, becoming redder in color and more aggressive, eventually becoming larger than a building.

&quot;The Blob&quot; was distributed by Paramount Pictures as a double feature with &quot;I Married a Monster from Outer Space&quot;.

==Plot==
In a small Pennsylvania town in July 1957, teenager Steve Andrews and his girlfriend Jane Martin kiss at a lovers&#x27; lane when they see a meteorite crash beyond the next hill. Steve goes looking for it but Barney, an old man living nearby, finds it first. When he pokes the meteorite with a stick, it breaks open and a small jelly-like globule blob inside attaches itself to his hand. In pain and unable to scrape or shake it loose, Barney runs onto the road, where he is nearly struck by Steve&#x27;s car. Steve and Jane take him to Doctor Hallen.

Doctor Hallen anesthetizes the man and sends Steve and Jane back to locate the impact site and gather information. Hallen decides he must amputate the man&#x27;s arm since it is being phagocytosed. Before he can, the Blob completely absorbs Barney, then Hallen&#x27;s nurse Kate, and finally the doctor himself, growing redder and larger with each victim. Steve and Jane return in time for Steve to witness the doctor trying to escape through the window with the Blob covering him. They go to the police station and return with Lieutenant Dave Barton and Sergeant Jim Bert, but they find no sign of the Blob nor its victims. The skeptical Bert dismisses Steve&#x27;s story as a prank. Steve and Jane are taken home by their parents, but they sneak out later.

The Blob absorbs a mechanic at a repair shop. During a midnight screening of &quot;Daughter of Horror&quot; at the Colonial Theater, Steve recruits Tony and his friends to warn people about the Blob. When Steve notices that his father&#x27;s grocery store is unlocked, he and Jane go inside to investigate. The janitor is nowhere to be seen. The couple is quickly cornered by the Blob and they seek refuge in the walk-in freezer. The Blob oozes under the door but quickly retreats. Steve and Jane gather their friends and set off the town&#x27;s fire and air-raid alarms. The responding townspeople and police still refuse to believe them. The Blob enters the Colonial Theater and envelops the projectionist, then oozes into the auditorium. Steve is finally vindicated when screaming people flee the theater in panic.

Steve, Jane and her kid brother Danny are trapped in a diner, along with the owner and a waitress, as the Blob—now enormous from the dozens of people it has consumed in the theater—engulfs the diner. Dave taps into the diner&#x27;s telephone with his police radio and warns those in the diner to shelter in the cellar before the police bring down a live power line onto the Blob.

Dave and Bert plan to electrocute the Blob by felling an overhead high-voltage power line. It discharges a massive electric current into the Blob, which is unaffected, but the diner underneath is set ablaze. When the diner&#x27;s owner uses a carbon dioxide fire extinguisher on the approaching fire inside, Steve notices that the Blob recoils. Steve remembers it also retreated from the freezer and realizes it cannot tolerate cold temperatures. Shouting, in hopes of being picked up on the open phone line, Steve tells Dave about the Blob&#x27;s vulnerability to cold. The firemen have a limited supply of fire extinguishers. Jane&#x27;s father, high school principal Henry Martin, leads Steve&#x27;s friends to break into the school to retrieve its extinguishers. When they return, a brigade of fire extinguisher-armed students, firemen and police drive the Blob away from the diner, freeing the five trapped there. They surround and freeze the Blob.

Dave requests authorities send an Air Force heavy-lift cargo aircraft to transport the frozen Blob to the Arctic. Dave realizes that the cold will stop the Blob “as long as the Arctic stays cold&quot;, but it won&#x27;t kill it. Parachutes bearing the Blob on a pallet lower it onto an Arctic ice field with the superimposed words &quot;The End&quot; morphing into a question mark.

==Cast==
==Production==
The film was the first production of Jack Harris, a film distributor from Philadelphia, and was reportedly inspired by a discovery of star jelly in Pennsylvania in 1950. It was originally titled &quot;The Molten Meteor&quot; until producers overheard screenwriter Kay Linaker refer to the film&#x27;s monster as &quot;the blob&quot;. Other sources give a different account, saying the film went through a number of title changes (the monster was called &quot;the mass&quot; in the shooting script) before the makers settled on &quot;The Glob&quot;. After hearing that cartoonist Walt Kelly had used &quot;The Glob&quot; as a title for his Pogo children&#x27;s book, they mistakenly believed they couldn&#x27;t use that title, so they changed it to &quot;The Blob&quot;. Although the budget was set at $120,000, it ended up costing only $110,000.

The film was the second feature directed by Irvin Yeaworth. Filmed in and around Valley Forge, Pennsylvania, principal photography took place in the summer of 1957 at Valley Forge Studios. Several scenes were filmed in the towns of Chester Springs, Downingtown, Phoenixville and Royersford, including the basement of a local restaurant that is currently named Downingtown Diner. For the diner scene, a photograph of the building was put on a gyroscopically operated table onto which cameras had been mounted. The table was shaken and the Blob rolled off. When the film negative was printed in reverse, it appeared to be oozing over the building. &quot;The Blob&quot; was filmed in color and projected at a 1.66 ratio (then known as the &quot;Paramount format&quot;).

Steve McQueen received $3,000 for his starring role. He turned down an offer for a smaller up-front fee in return for a 10 percent share of profits, thinking the film would never make money; he needed his signing fee immediately to pay for food and rent. However, &quot;The Blob&quot; ended up a hit, grossing $4 million at the box office.

The film&#x27;s tongue-in-cheek title song, &quot;The Blob&quot; [Columbia 42150A], was written by Burt Bacharach and Mack David. It became a nationwide hit in the United States, peaking at #33 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 chart on November 9, 1958. It was recorded by a studio group who adopted the name The Five Blobs. (The vocals are all by singer Bernie Knee, overdubbing himself.) It is commonly misbelieved that Bacharach wrote the song with his famous songwriting partner, Hal David, but David&#x27;s brother Mack wrote the lyrics.

&quot;The Blob&quot; background score was by Ralph Carmichael, who, like Yeaworth, had worked on television specials for the Billy Graham Evangelistic Association; it was supervised by the director&#x27;s wife, Jean Yeaworth. It was one of only a few film scores Carmichael wrote. He composed different opening music for the film—a piece called &quot;Violence&quot;, intended to start the film on a serious, frightening note. However, the director chose to replace it with the novelty song &quot;The Blob&quot; to encourage audiences to view it as campy fun. The song has contributed to the film&#x27;s enduring popularity. The original score and title song were both included on the soundtrack album, which was re-released in 2008 on the Monstrous Movie Music soundtrack label.

==Release==

Paramount acquired &quot;The Blob&quot; for $300,000 from Jack Harris and spent another $300,000 promoting it. According to Tim Dirks, it was one of a wave of &quot;cheap teen movies&quot; for the drive-in market—&quot;exploitative, cheap fare created especially for [young people] in a newly-established teen/drive-in genre&quot;.

Harris eventually bought back the rights from Paramount and Allied Artists Pictures Corporation, and reissued it as a double feature with his and Yeaworth&#x27;s &quot;Dinosaurus!&quot; in 1964.

===Home media===
&quot;The Blob&quot; has been released as part of the Criterion Collection on three formats: LaserDisc (1988), DVD (2000) and Blu-ray (2013). The DVD and Blu-ray feature new cover art by Michael Koelsch. The film, together with &quot;Son of Blob&quot;, was released on DVD in Australia by Umbrella Entertainment in September 2011. The DVD is compatible with all region codes and has special features, including audio commentaries with Jack H. Harris, Bruce Eder, Irvin Yeaworth and Robert Fields. In November 2016, Umbrella released a 2-disc Blu-ray, &quot;The Blob Collection&quot;, featuring the 1988 version of &quot;The Blob&quot; and the 1958 version of &quot;The Blob&quot;. Disc two also includes the Criterion Collection&#x27;s opening identification, although the release was distributed by Umbrella Entertainment with no mention of Criterion on the disc sleeve.

==Reception==
&quot;The Blob&quot; received negative reviews upon release. &quot;The New York Times&quot; highlighted some of its problems and identified some positives, although Steve McQueen&#x27;s starring debut was not one of them. On director Irvin Yeaworth&#x27;s work, they wrote:

Unfortunately, his picture talks itself to death, even with the blob nibbling away at everybody in sight. And most of his trick effects, under the direction of Irvin S. Yeaworth Jr., look pretty phony. On the credit side, the camera very snugly frames the small-town background—a store, a church spire, several homes and a theatre. The color is quite good (the blob rolls around in at least a dozen horrible-looking flavors, including raspberry). The acting is pretty terrible itself, there is not a single becomingly familiar face in the cast, headed by young Steven McQueen and Aneta Corseaut.

&quot;Variety&quot; had a similar reaction, seeing McQueen as the star, gamely &quot;giving the old college try&quot;, but that the &quot;... star performers, however, are the DeLuxe color camerawork of Thomas Spalding and Barton Sloane&#x27;s special effects&quot;.

Writing for &quot;Famous Monsters of Filmland&quot; in 1962, Joe Dante Jr. included &quot;The Blob&quot; in his list of the worst horror films ever. Dante found the film spent too much time on drag racing, and disliked how the monster was dealt with at the end.

In a discussion with biologist Richard Dawkins, astrophysicist Neil deGrasse Tyson stated that among all Hollywood aliens, which were usually disappointing, &quot;The Blob&quot; was his favorite from a scientific perspective. 
The ethnobiologists Oscar Requejo and N. Floro Andres-Rodriguez suggest that the slime mould &quot;Fuligo septica&quot; may have inspired the film&#x27;s eponymous blob.

The film review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes gives the film a 68% &quot;Fresh&quot; approval rating based on 31 reviews, with an average rating of 6.3/10. The website&#x27;s critical consensus reads, &quot;In spite of its chortle-worthy premise and dated special effects, &quot;The Blob&quot; remains a prime example of how satisfying cheesy B-movie monster thrills can be.&quot;

===Box office===
Paramount initially ordered 200 prints of the film. Following the first week grosses from 15 Los Angeles theaters (which outgrossed the studio&#x27;s &quot;Rock-A-Bye Baby&quot; and other films), it doubled the number of prints. The first week grosses in Los Angeles included $14,900 from the Hillstreet and Hawaii theaters. The film earned theatrical rentals of $1 million in its first year of release in the United States and Canada.

==Sequel==
&quot;Beware! The Blob&quot;, a sequel directed by Larry Hagman, was released in 1972. The same creature from the original—this time starting as a small specimen unearthed by a bulldozer crew in the Arctic—is brought back to suburban Los Angeles, where it escapes. Presented as a &quot;horror comedy&quot;, the film was also released under the title &quot;Son of Blob&quot; in 1972. As this was Hagman&#x27;s first feature film as director, home video releases used the tagline, &quot;The Movie That J.R. Shot&quot;, a play on &quot;Who shot J.R.?&quot;, the famous catchphrase about the near-demise of the character Hagman played in the television series &quot;Dallas&quot;.

==Remakes==
A remake with the same name was directed by Chuck Russell in 1988.

In August 2009, it was revealed that musician-turned-director Rob Zombie was working on another remake, but he later left the project. He was replaced by Simon West as director in January 2015. It was announced that the film would be produced by Richard Saperstein and Brian Witten, with the producer of the original film, Jack H. Harris, as executive producer. Harris died in 2017.

As of January 2024, West has stepped down from his role as director, following delays, and a rights dispute. David Bruckner was then hired to write and direct, with David S. Goyer and Keith Levine attached as producers and Judith Harris (the rights holder and widowed-wife of franchise producer) serving as executive producer. The project will be a joint-venture production between Warner Bros. Motion Pictures Group, and Phantom Four Films.

==Influence==
The 1958 Japanese film &quot;The H-Man&quot; directed by Ishiro Honda, resembles &quot;The Blob&quot;. From an original story by Hideo Kaijo, the English version was released in the United States by Columbia Pictures in 1959. In it, a creeping radioactive blob consumes human flesh on contact, leaving clothing behind. As well, a ghostly image of dissolved humans sometimes appear in an illuminated green cloud of radiation.

The 1959 Italian movie &quot;Caltiki - The Immortal Monster&quot; has similarities to &quot;The Blob&quot;, with a meteor-related amorphous blob devouring people.

The opening scene of the 1988 horror-comedy &quot;Killer Klowns from Outer Space&quot; closely parallels that of &quot;The Blob&quot;. Both movies also have a decent cop named Dave who does not believe the young people, and a crabby older cop who seems to have a grudge against young citizens.

The 1999 John Lafia film &quot;Monster!&quot; includes a theater scene apparently inspired by &quot;The Blob&quot;&#x27;s.

The film &quot;Monsters vs. Aliens&quot; has characters based on classic 1950s movie monsters, including B.O.B. (Benzoate Ostylezene Bicarbonate), an amoeboid creature.

The John Carpenter version of &quot;The Thing&quot; has a virtually identical camera shot of a body lying under a blanket on a gurney in which the blanket moves. It is similar to the scene in &quot;The Blob&quot; in the doctor&#x27;s office with the old man under the blanket.

In the &quot;Hotel Transylvania&quot; franchise, one of Dracula&#x27;s friends is a huge, indestructible green amoeboid creature called &quot;Blobby&quot; who is able to absorb and regurgitate anything in his path.

In computing, a blob is a collection of binary data stored as a single entity. Blobs are typically images, audio or other multimedia objects, although executable code is sometimes stored as a blob. Blobs were originally just big amorphous chunks of data invented by Jim Starkey at DEC, who describes them as &quot;the thing that ate Cincinnati, Cleveland, or whatever&quot; from &quot;the 1958 Steve McQueen movie&quot;, referring to &quot;The Blob&quot;.

==Legacy==
Since 2000, the town of Phoenixville, Pennsylvania, one of the filming locations, has held an annual &quot;Blobfest&quot;, including a reenactment of the scene in which moviegoers run screaming from the town&#x27;s now-restored Colonial Theatre. Chef&#x27;s Diner in Downingtown has also been restored, and customers are able to take photographs of the basement (on weekday mornings only).

The Blob itself was made from silicone, with increasing amounts of red vegetable dye added as it &quot;absorbed&quot; people. In 1965, it was bought by film collector Wes Shank, who has written a book about the making of &quot;The Blob&quot;.

According to Jeff Sharlet in his book &quot;The Family&quot;, &quot;The Blob&quot; was &quot;about the creeping horrors of communism&quot;, defeated only &quot;by freezing it—the Cold War writ small and literal&quot;. Rudy Nelson, one of the film&#x27;s scriptwriters, has denied many of Sharlet&#x27;s assertions, saying, &quot;What on earth can Sharlet say about the movie that will fill 23 pages—especially when what he thinks he knows is all wrong?&quot;.

In 1997, film historians Kim R. Holston and Tom Winchester noted that &quot;The Blob&quot; was &quot;filmed in southeastern Pennsylvania at Valley Forge Studios, (and) this very famous piece of pop culture is a model of a decent movie on a small budget&quot;.

The trailer for &quot;The Blob&quot; is seen during the drive-in scene in the 1978 film adaptation of the musical &quot;Grease&quot;.

The film is recognized by American Film Institute in these lists:
* 2001: AFI&#x27;s 100 Years...100 Thrills – Nominated
* 2003: AFI&#x27;s 100 Years...100 Heroes &amp; Villains:
** &quot;The Blob&quot; – Nominated Villain
Criminal Minds Season 4 Episode 19, &#x27;House on Fire,&#x27; opens by depicting people buying tickets for a screening of The Blob and commenting that it is &quot;campy,&quot; and more funny than scary.

<text>Omni Air International, LLC. is a United States charter airline headquartered in Hangar 19 on the grounds of Tulsa International Airport in Tulsa, Oklahoma, United States. It specializes in passenger charter flights and Aircraft, Crew, Maintenance and Insurance (ACMI) wet leasing. Omni Air International is a member of the Civil Reserve Air Fleet as a long-range international carrier. Omni Air International is a FAA Part 121 certificated airline with IATA Operational Safety Audit (IOSA) registration.

Omni Air International cooperates with Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) in controversial (sometimes termed &quot;high-risk&quot;) deportations. Omni Air International has been characterized as engaging in price gouging over its role in deportation flights.

==History==
The airline was established under the name Omni Air Express and started operations in March 1993 with a Boeing 727 freighter aircraft. In 1993, Omni started its Part 121 air carrier operations with Boeing 727F equipment in the narrow-body cargo market. Customers include integrated shipping companies such as BAX Global, DHL, Emery Worldwide, and UPS.

In 1997, the company changed its name to Omni Air International and launched passenger operations with DC-10s (including N270AX, the last DC-10 ever built).

In 1998, the company sold its Boeing 727f fleet to focus exclusively on its growing passenger business. From 1998 to 2000, the company acquired three second-hand long-range McDonnell Douglas DC-10-30s and began providing international charter service to wholesale companies and cruise lines as well as wet lease Aircraft, Crew, Maintenance and Insurance (ACMI) for other airlines and the US Department of Defense.

In April 2003, the Boeing 757-200 passenger aircraft was added to its fleet. The 757-200 fleet was approved for extended range over water operations (ETOPS). Boeing 757s were flown on vacation routes between Las Vegas (LAS) and Honolulu (HNL) year-round. They also flew between Minneapolis/St.Paul (MSP) and Cancun (CUN), Cozumel (CZM), Mazatlan (MZT) and Ixtapa/Zihuatanejo (ZIH), Mexico and to Montego Bay, Jamaica (MBJ) year round and between Boston (BOS) and Aruba (AUA), Netherlands Antilles seasonally.

Boeing 767-300ER aircraft were added starting in August 2009, and Boeing 777-200ER aircraft began operating in April 2011. That same year, the Boeing 767-200ER was added to the fleet. The B-767s and DC-10s were operated on Department of Defense flights between the US and Kuwait (KWI) and between the US and overseas bases in Africa, Asia, Europe and the Middle East and Central Asia. Omni also occasionally operates sub-service/wet-lease flights for foreign airlines from Canada, Germany, Ireland, Poland, Cyprus, Saudi Arabia, and Bolivia.

In 2011, Omni retired the McDonnell Douglas DC-10s from the fleet and received its IATA Operational Safety Audit (IOSA) registration. In 2012, Omni retired the Boeing 757-200.

On October 2, 2018, Air Transport Services Group (ATSG) announced it would acquire Omni subject to regulatory approval. On November 9, 2018 Air Transport Services Group (ATSG) completed its $845 million acquisition of Omni.

In September 2019, Omni aided in the repatriation of British citizens after the collapse of the UK&#x27;s Thomas Cook Airlines. The airline was contracted by the Civil Aviation Authority under the instruction of the British government to operate rescue flights returning stranded Thomas Cook passengers to the UK.

In 2020, Omni Air obtained $67 million in coronavirus relief aid, as well as a $77.65 million contract with the Trump administration&#x27;s Department of Defense for &quot;international charter airlift services.&quot;

In August 2021, U.S. President Joe Biden activated the Civil Reserve Air Fleet, utilizing 18 aircraft from six commercial airlines to ferry evacuees of Afghanistan from interim waystations throughout the Middle East and Europe. According to the Pentagon, the activation involves four aircraft from United Airlines; three aircraft each from American Airlines, Atlas Air, Delta Air Lines, and Omni Air; and two from Hawaiian Airlines.

==Fleet==
As of June 2024, the Omni Air International fleet consists of the following aircraft:

== Accidents and incidents ==
On 28 August 2020, an Omni Air International Boeing 767 (registered N423AX) operated a flight between Kabul, Afghanistan and Washington, United States with a scheduled refueling stop at Bucharest, Romania. During landing at the Romanian capital, the aircraft&#x27;s left main landing gear collapsed. The aircraft skidded along the runway and evacuation slides were used by the 80 passengers to escape without injury.

<text>Beauchene Island is the southernmost of the Falkland Islands, lying about south of Porpoise Point in Lafonia. It was discovered in 1701 by Jacques Gouin de Beauchêne, after whom it was named.

==Geography==
Beauchene is the most isolated island of the Falkland archipelago. It is uninhabited, free of introduced predators and, because it is so remote, has been protected from disturbance. It is in area. The north of the island is covered in dense tussac grass with boulder beaches on the western coast and sloping up gently to about in height. In the south of the island the land rises to around . There are higher cliffs on the eastern coast and the &quot;southern quarter of the island is almost bare of vegetation.&quot;

The island has a natural anchorage on the east side of the island that can only be used in fair weather. There is no resident population and visitors require the permission of the Falkland Islands Executive Committee. A typical example was a request by Falklands Conservation to make three visits in October 2010, January 2011 and March 2011 for the purpose of taking a bird census. In their application, it was noted that nobody had set foot on the island since a visit by the Shallow Marine Survey Group (SMSG) in December 2009.

==History==
Anthony de la Roché may have sighted Beauchene Island as early as April 1675. However this is by no means certain: de la Roché had rounded Cape Horn and was blown off course. The island visited is usually said to be South Georgia, which fits his descriptions better, particularly of high ice-covered mountains and bays, in one of which he anchored for a fortnight (see the ), but supporters of Argentina&#x27;s claim to South Georgia more often claim it was Beauchene.

A while after its official discovery in 1701 by Jacques Gouin de Beauchêne, seal trappers tried unsuccessfully to settle the island.

In 1834, the American McArthur landed 100 people on the island, driving the local sea lions to extinction (they have since returned).

Although the island is uninhabited, there are ruins of a group of houses built in the 1830s on the west side of the island.

The first proper scientific expedition landed in 1951 by helicopter, staying for a month.

During the Falklands War, there was an Argentine wreck on a reef just south of the islands, and British soldiers lived for around four weeks there.

==Flora and fauna==
The island is a nature reserve. It is covered in tussac grass and is known for its caves and for its peat, which forms around ten times faster than anywhere else in the world. Apart from the tussac, plants found on the island include wild celery, Antarctic starwort and bittercress.

The island has been identified by BirdLife International as an Important Bird Area. Over 30 species have been recorded, including gentoo penguins (750 breeding pairs), southern rockhopper penguins (60,000 pairs), macaroni penguins, Magellanic penguins, black-browed albatrosses (100,000 pairs), fairy prions (10,000 pairs), sooty shearwaters, Wilson&#x27;s storm-petrels, grey-backed storm-petrels, common diving petrels, southern giant petrels, imperial shags (2500 pairs), striated caracaras (65 pairs), blackish cinclodes, Cobb&#x27;s wrens and white-bridled finches. South American sea lions breed in small numbers on the island, which is a major haulout site for non-breeding animals.

The family belonged to the Modh Bania caste of Gujarati Hindu tradesmen and were based in the coastal town of Porbandar. In May 1883, 14-year-old Kasturba was married to 13-year-old Mohandas in a marriage arranged by their parents.

Recalling the day of their marriage, her husband once said, &quot;As we didn&#x27;t know much about marriage, for us it meant only wearing new clothes, eating sweets and playing with relatives.&quot; However, as was prevailing tradition, the adolescent bride was to spend the first few years of marriage at her parents&#x27; house, and away from her husband. Writing many years later, Mohandas described with regret the lustful feelings he felt for his young bride, &quot;even at school I used to think of her, and the thought of nightfall and our subsequent meeting was ever haunting me.&quot; At the beginning of their marriage, Mohandas was also possessive and manipulative; he wanted the ideal wife who would follow his command.

Kasturba became pregnant at the age of 17. The first child was born prematurely and did not survive the first year. Although their other four sons survived to adulthood, Kasturba never fully recovered from the death of her first child. Mohandas decided to go to London to study and departed in 1888, soon after their second child was born, a son named Harilal. Kasturba remained in India. Mohandas returned from London in 1891, and in 1892 Kasturba gave birth to another son, Manilal. Unable to find a successful career in India, Mohandas left for South Africa in 1893, once again leaving behind Kasturba and his children. In 1896 the family joined Mohandas in South Africa.

In 1906, Mohandas took a vow of chastity, or brahamacharya. Some reports indicated that Kasturba felt that this opposed her role as a traditional Hindu wife. However, Kasturba quickly defended her marriage when a woman suggested she was unhappy. Kasturba&#x27;s relatives also insisted that the greatest good was to remain and obey her husband, the Mahatma.

Ramachandra Guha&#x27;s biography &quot;Gandhi Before India&quot; described the marriage, saying, &quot;They had, in the emotional as well as sexual sense, always been true to one another. Perhaps because of their periodic, extended separations, Kasturba deeply cherished their time together.&quot;

==Political career==

Kasturba first involved herself with politics in South Africa in 1904 when, with her husband and others, she established the Phoenix Settlement near Durban. In 1913 she took part in protests against the ill-treatment of Indian immigrants in South Africa, for which she was arrested and sentenced to hard labour. While in prison, she led other women in prayer and encouraged the educated women to teach the uneducated women how to read and write.

The Gandhis left South Africa in July 1914 and returned to live in India. In spite of Kasturba’s chronic bronchitis she continued to take part in civil actions and protests across India and often took her husband&#x27;s spot when he was in prison. The majority of her time was dedicated to serving in ashrams. Here, Gandhi was referred to as &quot;Ba&quot; or Mother, because she served as mother of the ashrams in India. A point of difference between Kasturba and Mohandas was the treatment of their children in their ashram. Mohandas believed that their sons did not deserve special treatment, while Kasturba felt that Mohandas neglected them.

In 1917, Kasturba worked for women&#x27;s welfare in Champaran, Bihar where Mohandas was working with indigo farmers. She taught women hygiene, discipline, health, reading and writing. In 1922, she participated in a &quot;Satyagraha&quot; (nonviolent resistance) movement in Borsad, Gujarat even though she was in poor health. She did not take part in her husband&#x27;s famous Salt March in 1930, but continued to take part in many civil disobedience campaigns and marches. As a result, she was arrested and jailed on numerous occasions.

In 1939, Gandhi took part in nonviolent protests against the British rule in Rajkot, after the women in the city specifically asked her to advocate for them. Gandhi was arrested once again, and kept in solitary confinement for a month. Her health worsened but she continued to fight for independence. In 1942, she was arrested again, along with Mohandas and other freedom fighters, for participating in the Quit India movement. She was imprisoned in the Aga Khan Palace in Pune. By this time her health had severely deteriorated and she died at the detention camp in Pune.

Mohandas wrote of his wife in terms which showed that he expected obedience from her. &quot;According to my earlier experience, she was very obstinate. In spite of all my pressure she would do as she wished. This led to short or long periods of estrangement between us. But as my public life expanded, my wife bloomed forth and deliberately lost herself in my work.&quot;

==Health and death==

Kasturba suffered from chronic bronchitis due to complications at birth. Her bronchitis was complicated by pneumonia. In January 1908 she fasted while her husband was in prison, and she became gravely ill. She came so close to death that Mohandas apologised to her, and promised he would not remarry if she died. Kasturba would later undergo a major surgery.

In January 1944, Gandhi suffered two heart attacks, after which she was confined to her bed much of the time. Even there she found no respite from pain. Spells of breathlessness interfered with her sleep at night. She asked to see an Ayurvedic doctor, and after several delays, the government allowed a specialist in traditional Indian medicine to attend to her. At first she responded well, recovering enough by the second week in February to sit on the veranda in a wheelchair for short periods and talk with him. Later she suffered a relapse. Her son Devdas ordered penicillin, but her doctors did not want to use it because the final failure of the kidneys could not be relieved by penicillin. The doctors informed the Gandhi family that the condition of Kasturba had already deteriorated enough that penicillin would not be helpful.

She died at the Aga Khan Palace in Pune, at 7:35 PM local time on 22 February 1944, aged 74.

The Kasturba Gandhi National Memorial Trust Fund was set up in her memory. Mohandas requested that this fund be used to help women and children in villages in India.

<doc id="761801" wikidata="Q7355290" url="?curid=761801" title="Rockhopper penguin">
<text>The rockhopper penguins are three closely related taxa of crested penguins that have been traditionally treated as a single species and are sometimes split into three species.

Not all experts agree on the classification of these penguins. Some consider all three as distinct species, some split the western and eastern forms into the southern rockhopper penguin and keep the northern rockhopper as distinct, while other experts consider all three potential varieties to be one species.

==Appearance==
Rockhopper penguins (Eudyptes chrysocome) are among the smaller species of penguin. After reaching full growth, they are about 20 inches or 50 centimetres in height. Males and females cannot be distinguished visually, so a DNA test is conducted by taking a feather from the bird to determine its gender. Like many penguins, rockhopper penguins have a white belly and the rest of their body is black. Some characteristics that differentiate them from the other penguins are their red eyes, orange beak, pink webbed feet, and the yellow and black spiky feathers they have on their head. Although their yellow and black spiky feathers differentiate them from other penguins, rockhopper penguin chicks do not have them; these feathers develop with age. Their orange beak is initially black, but as the penguins get older, their beaks turn orange. Due to the harsh rocky environment, they cannot slide on their bellies like most penguins, so they hop to get from one place to another, hence their name.

The yellow and black ‘hair’ they have on the top of their head is similar to that of the Macaroni penguin (Eudyptes chrysolophus).

==Subspecies==
What separates rockhopper penguins into subspecies is their location of reproduction and reproductive behaviors. The difference in mating signals
found between the subspecies &quot;E. chrysocome&quot; (southern) and &quot;E. moseleyi&quot; (northern) seems to have occurred quickly, thus these behavioral changes are enough to isolate these taxa.

Southern rockhopper penguins are split into two subspecies and they are defined by their location of reproduction. The subspecies &quot;E. c. filholi&quot; (eastern) is known to reproduce in the sub-Antarctic around the Prince Edward Islands, Crozet Islands, Kerguelen Islands, Heard Island, Macquarie Island and Campbell, Auckland and Antipodes Islands. The subspecies &quot;E. c. chrysocome&quot;, which may be referred to the true southern subspecies, reproduces at offshore islands in southern Chile, Argentina and at the Falkland Islands. The Falkland Islands are known to have one of the largest populations of southern rockhopper penguins.

The subspecies in the group are:

* Southern rockhopper penguin, &quot;Eudyptes (chrysocome) chrysocome&quot;
* Eastern rockhopper penguin, &quot;Eudyptes (chrysocome) filholi&quot;
* Northern rockhopper penguin, &quot;Eudyptes (chrysocome) moseleyi&quot;

==Habitat and distribution==

Northern rockhopper penguins breed in cool temperate climates including on the islands of Gough and Tristan da Cunha in the Atlantic Ocean and Saint Paul and Amsterdam Islands in the Indian Ocean. The southern rockhopper breeds on the Falkland Islands, Argentina and Chile, with breeding colonies around Cape Horn in South America, and Gough, Prince Edward, Marion, Crozet, Kerguelen, Heard, Macquarie, Campbell, Auckland and Antipodes Islands in the southern Indian Ocean. Eastern rockhopper penguins are mostly found breeding on Campbell Island in New Zealand, but their numbers have declined immensely. Rockhopper penguins usually make their habitat in rocky shorelines. They make nests and burrows in tall grasses called tussocks.

==Diet==
The rockhopper penguin&#x27;s diet consists of krill and small crustaceans, which may include shrimp, crabs, lobsters or crayfish. They also eat squid and myctophid fish. Rockhopper penguins consume more krill than they do fish; their diet changes during migration and as the seasons change. Rockhopper penguins can be at sea for several days while hunting. They can dive up to for many minutes at a time while searching for prey.

==Reproduction==

Rockhoppers are the most widespread crested penguins. Their range goes from the Antarctic front to the South Atlantic and Indian Oceans. Because of how widespread they are, breeding varies among the penguins in different areas. Northern Penguins begin the mating process two months earlier than Southern ones. Two eggs are usually laid a few days apart during early November in hope that at least one will survive, and the second egg is usually larger than the first. They will use the same nest as they did in previous years as well. Eggs hatch about a month later and the mother will have food for the chick.

==Taxonomy==
There are currently 19 species and six genera of living penguins. The rockhopper penguin has 3 subspecies: &quot;Eudyptes filholi&quot;, the Eastern Rockhopper; &quot;Eudyptes mosleyi&quot;, the Northern Rockhopper; and the &quot;Eudyptes chrysocome&quot;, the Southern Rockhopper. They are separated by their locations of breeding. There are four other species in the genus &quot;Eudyptes&quot;: &quot;E. pachyrhynchus&quot;, &quot;E. robustus&quot;, &quot;E. chrysolophus&quot;, and &quot;E. schlegeli&quot;. The three subspecies of the rockhopper penguin are believed to have split up because of latitude and watermasses rather than because of geographic distances. Research suggests that during the early Pleistocene, the Southern Ocean was cold and rockhopper populations from the Atlantic and Indian Oceans remained undifferentiated and lived in the same watermass. The mid-Pleistocene climatic transition was associated with the southward migration of frontal positions and islands became surrounded by subtropical water masses, resulting in a split between Northern and Southern rockhopper penguins. Many advance and retreat cycles of Patagonian icecaps during the late Pleistocene may have created a barrier to gene flow between Southern Pacific and Southern Atlantic populations, causing a split between Southern and Eastern rockhopper populations.

==Predators==
Adult Rockhopper penguins have no land-based predators. They are eaten when at sea by leopard seals, fur seals, killer whales and blue sharks. Chicks and eggs are eaten by many birds including giant petrels, skuas, sheathbills and various types of gulls.

==Conservation==
Although the rockhopper penguin is one of the world&#x27;s most numerous penguin populations, it is estimated that the population declined by some 30 percent over the final 30 years of the 20th century. The cause of this decline is mainly unknown, but scientists have speculated that humans are involved, mostly by commercial overfishing, oil exploitation, and pollution. Recent research has shown that rockhopper penguin population declines with changes in ocean surface temperature, indicating a direct impact from climate change. These activities have depleted much of the rockhopper penguin&#x27;s food supply and raised the sea surface temperatures, and because this species is geographically isolated to the tip of South America and the Falkland Islands and is very sensitive to food web changes, there is little foreseeable opportunity for the penguins to recover.

=== Oil spills ===
An oil spill followed the grounding of the MS &quot;Oliva&quot; off Nightingale Island in 2011, which resulted in thousands of Rockhopper penguins becoming oiled. Oil spills have impacted many penguin species since the conversion of shipping from sail and coal propulsion to liquid-based fuels in the early 20th century.

==Gallery==
==In films==
Rockhoppers are seen in the films, &quot;The Pebble and the Penguin&quot;, &quot;Happy Feet&quot; and &quot;Happy Feet 2&quot;, &quot;Surf&#x27;s Up&quot; and &quot;Surf&#x27;s Up 2: WaveMania&quot;, and &quot;The Wild&quot;.

<text>Philip Gross (born 1952) is a poet, novelist, playwright, children&#x27;s writer and academic based in England and Wales. He is currently Professor of Creative Writing at the University of South Wales.

==Biography==
Philip Gross was born in 1952 at Delabole in north Cornwall, near the sea, as the only child of Juhan Karl Gross, an Estonian wartime refugee, and Jessie, daughter of the local village schoolmaster. He grew up and was educated in Plymouth. In junior school he began writing stories and in his teens he took to poetry as well. He is a Quaker. He went on to the University of Sussex, where he gained his BA in English. He worked for a correspondence college and in several libraries, as he has a diploma in librarianship. Since the early 1980s he has been a freelance writer and writing educator and more recently held posts in several universities.

In the 1980s, Gross and his first wife, Helen, had a son and a daughter. While living in Bristol he began travelling around schools in Britain as a workshop leader and later joined Bath Spa University to teach Creative Studies. In 2000, he married his second wife, Zélie. In 2004 he was appointed Professor of Creative Writing at the University of Glamorgan, now the University of South Wales, a position he still holds. In 2007 he received a DLitt from the university.

Gross won the T. S. Eliot Prize in 2009 for a collection of poems, &quot;The Water Table&quot;, a Gregory Award in 1981, and the National Poetry Competition in 1982.

He has judged several poetry competitions: in 2014 the Hippocrates Prize for Poetry and Medicine, the Manchester Writing for Children Prize 2014, the Magma Poetry Competition and the Medicine Unboxed Creative Prize. In the summer of 2015 he was writer in residence at the Poetry on the Move international festival at the University of Canberra.

==Work==
Philip Gross published three books in 2009, all of which won major prizes. On 18 January 2010, he was announced to have won the 2009 T. S. Eliot Prize for &quot;The Water Table&quot;. Meanwhile &quot;I Spy Pinhole Eye&quot;, from Cinnamon Press, with photographs by Simon Denison, won him the Wales Book of the Year prize on 30 June 2010. The following year, his collection for children, &quot;Off Road to Everywhere&quot; (Salt) was awarded the Centre for Literacy in Primary Education prize for 2011. Several of his collections have been a Choice or Recommendation of the Poetry Book Society, most recently &quot;Love Songs of Carbon&quot; in 2015.

His earlier poetry collections, from 1983, include &quot;The Ice Factory&quot;, &quot;Cat&#x27;s Whisker&quot;, &quot;The Son of the Duke of Nowhere&quot;, &quot;I.D.&quot;, &quot;The Wasting Game&quot; – all collected in &quot;Changes of Address: Poems 1980–98&quot;. Of his more recent work, the Poetry Book Society selectors wrote, &quot;At the heart of all of Gross&#x27;s collections has been his deep enquiry into and fascination with the nature of embodiment and existence – what water is and does in &quot;The Water Table&quot;, the role of language, and speech especially, in identity and the self in &quot;Deep Field and Later&quot;. Now in &quot;Love Songs of Carbon&quot; Gross tests and feels his amazed way through the mysteries of the multiple manifestations of love and ageing.&quot;

Gross&#x27;s ten novels for young people include &quot;Going For Stone&quot;, &quot;The Lastling&quot; and &quot;The Storm Garden&quot; (Oxford University Press). He has also written stage plays, work for radio, a children&#x27;s opera, and in 2015 &quot;The King In The Car Park&quot;, a schools cantata on the death and reburial of Richard III, to a score by Benjamin Frank Vaughan). He has collaborated frequently with musicians, painters, dancers and other writers.

His poems and writings on poetry appear in a wide range of magazines and journals, where he investigates the creative process, in particular cross-arts work and collaboration, as in &quot;Then Again What Do I Know: reflections on reflection in Creative Writing&quot;. He contributed to &quot;The Writer in the Academy: Creative Interfrictions&quot;, edited by Richard Marggraf Turley and with &quot;Halfway-to-Whole Things: Ecologies of Writing and Collaboration&quot; to &quot;Extending Ecocriticism&quot;.

<doc id="761806" wikidata="Q986328" url="?curid=761806" title="Near North Side, Chicago">
<text>The Near North Side is one of Chicago&#x27;s 77 community areas. It is the northernmost of the three areas that constitute central Chicago, the others being the Loop and the Near South Side. The community area is located north and east of the Chicago River. To its east is the shore of Lake Michigan, and its northern boundary is the early 19th-century city limit of Chicago, North Avenue. In 2020 the Near North Side had 105,481 residents, surpassing Lake View as the largest Chicago community area by population. It is also the most densely populated community area and has the second most skyscrapers, after the Loop. With the exception of areas near Goose Island in the northwest (which is undergoing development), the Near North Side is known for its affluence, typified by the Gold Coast, Magnificent Mile, Navy Pier, and residential skyscrapers.

The Near North Side is arguably the oldest part of Chicago. In the 1780s, in what is now the Near North Side, on the northern banks of the Chicago River near today&#x27;s Michigan Avenue Bridge, Jean Baptiste Point du Sable built the first known permanent settlement in what was called &quot;Eschecagou.&quot; Today, this is marked by Pioneer Court.

Especially in the vicinity of Rush and Erie streets, the Near North Side was once known as McCormickville; so named because it is here where many branches of the famous McCormick family of mechanical reaper fame built their mansions in the late 1800s and early 1900s.

==Neighborhoods==
===Gold Coast===
The Gold Coast consists mostly of luxury high-rise apartment towers and buildings and stone mansions throughout. Its borders are generally defined as North Avenue to the north, Lake Michigan to the east, Chicago Avenue to the south, and Clark Street to the west.

The Gold Coast became the home of the super-rich in 1885, when Potter Palmer, former dry goods merchant and owner of the Palmer House hotel, built a fanciful castle on Lake Shore Drive. Over the next few decades, Chicago&#x27;s elite gradually migrated from Prairie Avenue to their new homes north of the Loop.

Along almost every boulevard of the Gold Coast has upscale boutiques and shops. Many upscale auto dearlerships are located here. Many of Chicago&#x27;s best known and highly rated restaurants are located here as well. Also in the area are Lou Malnati&#x27;s Pizzeria, Gibsons Steakhouse, and the original Morton&#x27;s The Steakhouse.

The &quot;Gold Coast Historic District&quot; was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on January 30, 1978.

The Gold Coast is zoned to the following Chicago Public Schools schools: Ogden School and the prestigious Latin School of Chicago.

===Old Town===
Old Town is a Chicago neighborhood bounded by North Avenue on the north, Larrabee Street on the northwest, Division Street on the south, Clybourn Avenue on the southwest, and LaSalle Street on the east. It crosses portions of the community areas of southern Lincoln Park, as well as the northern Near North Side, and is part of Chicago&#x27;s 43rd ward. 
Old Town includes the Old Town Triangle Historic District which is bounded on its northwest side by the former Ogden Avenue right-of-way, its northeast side by Lincoln Avenue and Wells Street, and on its south side by North Avenue. This historic district sits within the Old Town Triangle Association (OTTA), a Lincoln Park neighborhood bounded by the former Ogden Avenue right-of-way, Clark Street, and North Avenue. It sits inside the community area of Lincoln Park and is part of Chicago&#x27;s 43rd ward. Old Town north of North Avenue is in Lincoln Park, and south of North Avenue is part of the Near North Side.

Old Town is now an affluent and historic neighborhood, home to many of Chicago&#x27;s older Victorian-era buildings. However, in the 1950s, most of this area was an enclave to the first emigrants from Puerto Rico to Chicago, who referred to it as part of &quot;La Clark&quot; until commercialization decorated late 1960s shop signs with the name of Old Town. The neighborhood is home to St. Michael&#x27;s Church, originally built to serve German immigrants, and one of only 7 to survive the great Chicago fire. St. Michael&#x27;s, Holy Name Cathedral, Immaculate Conception, and St. Joseph&#x27;s Catholic churches all catered to Latinos with a Mass in Spanish.

Many of the streets and alleys, particularly in the Old Town Triangle section, predate the Great Chicago Fire and do not all adhere to the city&#x27;s typical grid pattern. In 1927, sculptors Sol Kogen and Edgar Miller purchased and subsequently rehabilitated a house on Burton Place, near Wells Street, into the Carl Street Studios. Through the 1930s, an art colony emerged in the neighborhood as artists moved from the Towertown neighborhood near Washington Square Park.

Old Town was home to many gays and lesbians from the 1950s through the 1980s. This was the first &quot;gay ghetto&quot; in Chicago, predating the current large Lake View neighborhood which also contains the Boystown district. There were numerous gay establishments in Old Town (now mostly closed as Lake View is now the main gayborhood) along Wells Street and Old Town was home to the longstanding gay-themed Bijou Theater until it closed in September 2015. As Old Town gentrified, the LGBT population of the nearby Lake View neighborhood continued to increase, as well as the LGBT populations of the Lincoln Park and Andersonville areas.

Old Town is home to the famous Second City improvisational comedy troupe which has launched the careers of many successful comedians and actors.

Old Town has three &quot;L&quot; rapid transit stations: North/Clybourn, Sedgwick, and Clark/Division.

===Goose Island===

Goose Island is an island in Chicago covering 160 acres on the Chicago River that is completely surrounded by the rest of the city. It is separated from the mainland by the North Branch of the Chicago River on the west and by the North Branch Canal on the east. The canal was dug in 1853 by mayor William Butler Ogden&#x27;s administration and was dug for industrial purposes, thus forming the island. After Irish immigrants settled on the island, it took the name Goose Island, as well as that of Kilgubbin, which was the immigrants&#x27; original home in Ireland. The Goose Island Brewery makes Kilgubbin Red Ale, in honor of this name.

The large facility on the north end of Goose Island (visible from North Avenue, but by car only reachable from the south: Division Street to North Branch to 1132 W. Blackhawk) is the Wrigley Global Innovation Center, a facility, which opened in September 2005 and was designed by Gyo Obata of Hellmuth, Obata and Kassabaum. While cars are able to approach from the south, trains, bicycles, and pedestrians can reach the site via the rail/pedestrian Cherry Avenue Bridge spanning from North Avenue to Goose Island. Additionally, there is seasonal access from the north via the Chicago Water Taxi service dock at the south end of the Cherry Avenue Bridge.

On the south end of the island is Kendall College&#x27;s Riverworks campus. The southern end of the island is currently undergoing redevelopment with upscale condominiums, townhouses, and apartments.

===River North===

River North is a neighborhood known for its fine dining, galleries, nightlife, and riverwalk amenities. It is home to the world headquarters of ConAgra, Groupon, Motorola Mobility, and the regional offices of Yelp. It is bounded by Michigan Avenue to the east, Chicago Avenue to the north, and the Chicago River to the south and west. River North has many towers and high-rises and some of its other famous structures include the Merchandise Mart, the Wrigley Building, Holy Name Cathedral, the Marina City towers, and the House of Blues.

====Smokey Hollow====
River North was previously named Smokey Hollow, at the turn of the 20th century, due to the many factories and forges in the area. Smoke from the factories was often so thick that it blocked the sunlight. At the time, Smokey Hollow was a major transportation hub, with railroad tracks linking the ports along the Chicago River to the surrounding areas. The now mixed-use Merchandise Mart was once a major storage warehouse for goods, and it still has railroad tracks underneath its sprawling structure. Former major retailer Montgomery Ward also had a major transportation and storage facility in River North. Massive coal bins were formerly located throughout the neighborhood, for storage of coal transported by ship.

====Little Sicily====
Little Sicily in Chicago was also located in River North. The first Italian Roman Catholic Church in Chicago was Assumption, on Illinois Street, with a mandate to be the parish church for all Italians from Lake Michigan to the Mississippi River. Later, Sicilians began to move north from the immediate vicinity of Assumption and began to form their own parishes. Italians whose family roots were from other parts of Italy tended to move west along Grand Street and form parishes west of Assumption.

=====Cabrini–Green=====
The Near North Side formerly included the now demolished Cabrini–Green public housing project that once housed 15,000 subsidized tenants. It was made up primarily of high-rise and mid-rise buildings. The apartment buildings opened in 1958 and 1962, while the shuttered rowhouses (called the Frances Cabrini Homes, a few of which still exist) had opened in 1942. Cabrini–Green stood in what once was the former Italian enclave called the Little Sicily neighborhood, and the former site of St. Dominic&#x27;s Church. In the 1920s, Little Sicily developed a reputation for poverty and crime. As gentrification began to take hold in the 1990s, the buildings made way for new upscale developments. The final Cabrini-Green tower was demolished in 2011. Following the conclusion of a civil lawsuit, the former Cabrini-Green site was transformed and revitalized with new upscale development spurred by the growth of Old Town to the north, and the already affluent areas of the Gold Coast to the east and River North to the south. Goose Island, which sits to the west, is currently undergoing new development.

====River North====
The River North neighborhood got its name from Chicago real estate developer Albert Friedman (chief executive of Friedman Properties Ltd.), who in 1974 started to buy, restore, and build commercial property in the southeast sector. Much of the area was a shabby urban neighborhood. In an effort to attract tenants Friedman began calling the area &quot;River North&quot;. Within a few years, Friedman found photographers, ad agencies, and art galleries willing to rent the low-cost space and to coalesce into what is now the River North Gallery District, which has the largest concentration of art galleries in the United States outside of Manhattan. Along with hundreds of art galleries, the area has many taverns, rooftop bars, dance clubs, popular restaurants, and entertainment venues. Between the years 2000 and 2010, the population in the four census tracts covering River North increased by an average of nearly 82%, boosting population from 9,835 in 2000 to 17,892 in 2010.

Districts of River North include:
* the gallery district, primarily along Superior and Huron streets between Wells and Orleans;
* a theme-restaurant area with many tourist-oriented restaurants, surrounding Clark and Ontario;
* the cathedral district, an area with many new skyscrapers surrounding Holy Name Cathedral (Catholic) and St. James Cathedral (Episcopal), which are located near State and Superior, and Huron and Wabash, respectively. The Moody Bible Institute is not located too far away at Chicago Avenue and LaSalle Drive;
* a design district, with shops and showrooms selling commercial and luxury interior furnishings, in the blocks north of the Merchandise Mart;
* and Kingsbury Park, an area of newly built residential high-rises surrounding Montgomery Ward Park, at Erie Street and the Chicago River.

River North is serviced by four CTA &quot;L&quot; train stations: the subway stations of Chicago Avenue (Red Line) and Grand Avenue (Red Line); and the elevated stations of Chicago Avenue (Brown Line) and Merchandise Mart (Brown Line).

===Streeterville===

Streeterville is the easternmost neighborhood in Chicago north of the Chicago River. It is bounded by the river on the south, Michigan Avenue on the west, and Lake Michigan on the north and east.

Streeterville houses some of Chicago&#x27;s tallest skyscrapers (such as the John Hancock Center); many upscale stores, hotels, restaurants; and Northwestern University&#x27;s Northwestern Memorial Hospital, Feinberg School of Medicine, School of Professional Studies, Kellogg School of Management&#x27;s downtown campus, and School of Law.

The number one tourist attraction in the Midwest, Navy Pier, is located in Streeterville. The neighborhood also houses the Museum of Contemporary Art, Chicago.

====Magnificent Mile====
The Magnificent Mile is a stretch of North Michigan Avenue between the Chicago River and Oak Street. Along this portion of Michigan Avenue is a mixture of luxury stores, restaurants, office buildings, and hotels. The area has a high concentration of the city&#x27;s major media firms and advertising agencies as well, including the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; newspaper.

The street is the home of Chicago&#x27;s famous Water Tower landmark, Water Tower Park with its historic clock, and the eight-level Water Tower Place shopping center which grew up next door to the landmark. North of the shopping center can be found the famous John Hancock Center, also known as 875 North Michigan Avenue tower; the Art Deco Palmolive Building; and the lavish Drake Hotel that sits across from a beach.

<text>Joseph Thauberger (August 26, 1909 – April 21, 1998) was a Canadian politician. Born in Bessarabia (now Moldova), he emigrated to Canada from Russia with his parents, Andreas Thauberger and Maria Eva (née Bähr) in 1911.

In the 1972 federal election, Thauberger ran for the Social Credit Party of Canada in the riding of Qu&#x27;Appelle, Saskatchewan. He placed last in a field of four candidates, with 839 votes (3.1% of the total).

Joseph Thauberger helped establish the Canada Party in the early 1990s to promote a policy of nationalism and monetary reform. He became the first leader of that party.

In the 1993 election, he ran for the Canada Party in the riding of Regina—Qu&#x27;Appelle, Saskatchewan. He placed last in a field of six candidates, with 178 votes (0.55% of the total).

Thauberger stepped down from the party leadership in 1994 and was replaced by Claire Foss. The party merged into the Canadian Action Party in 1997. Joseph Thauberger died in Regina, Saskatchewan in April 1998. He is buried in Riverside Cemetery in Regina.

Joseph Thauberger&#x27;s son, Dr. Patrick Cyril Thauberger, disappeared in Regina in 1997 while travelling from Winnipeg to Edmonton. His body was later found in a slough on the family farm, having been put there by his brother Joe, who was later convicted of his murder.

The Regina Police Service arrested Patrick Thauberger&#x27;s older brother Joseph George Thauberger, on November 29, 2020, on charges of first degree murder in Patrick&#x27;s death, offering an indignity to a human body and uttering threats to a woman (between 1997 and 2014). He was convicted of second degree murder in 2023.

<text>Agony is a horizontally scrolling shooter with a surreal fantasy background. It was released by Psygnosis in 1992 for the Amiga. The game was developed by the company Art &amp; Magic, which was originally known as Ordilogic Systems. Agony was the only Amiga game developed under the Art &amp; Magic name, as after Agony was released, Art &amp; Magic started developing arcade video games exclusively. &quot;Agony&quot; features a barn owl flying its way through six worlds filled with monsters. The owl uses various waves of echolocation which the player fires at the enemies.

==Plot==
According to the manual backstory, the sun-wizard master Acanthopsis discovers the &quot;Cosmic Power&quot; with a toll on his life. Before dying he teaches it to his disciples, Alestes and Mentor. Alestes has been transformed into a barn owl, and has to pass through Mentor&#x27;s traps and monsters in order to reach the Cosmic Power.

==Music==
The theme song is by Tim Wright, a classically themed, piano-led instrumental. The title song was adapted without giving him proper credit by the keyboardist of Dimmu Borgir in the song &quot;Sorgens Kammer&quot; for their &quot;Stormblåst&quot; album. The band did not know about this. Following several months of communication between Wright and Dimmu Borgir, and in a nod to the composer, the band did not include the track on a later re-recording of &quot;Stormblåst&quot;. The title song is also slightly different from the version that Wright originally submitted to Art &amp; Magic. Franck Sauer advised Wright that he could source improved piano sounds for the piece, and requested permission to change them. Wright agreed, but did not hear the result before the game went to the final master, and consequently some notes within the piece were transposed; this &#x27;mistake&#x27; was also covered by Dimmu Borgir.

== Legacy ==
Around 2010, graphic artist Franck Sauer started to offer the game&#x27;s binary files (ADF format) for free download on his personal webpage, making the game freeware.
On July 4, 2020, the programmer of the game, Yves Grolet, uploaded all his Amiga development files (which included full source code for &quot;Agony&quot;) to WeTransfer.

<doc id="761809" wikidata="Q233987" url="?curid=761809" title="Sophia Alekseyevna of Russia">
<text>Sophia Alekseyevna (; ) was a Russian princess who ruled as regent of Russia from 1682 to 1689. She allied herself with a singularly capable courtier and politician, Prince Vasily Golitsyn, to install herself during the minority of her brother Ivan V and half-brother Peter I. She carried out her regency with a firm hand. The activity of this &quot;bogatyr-tsarevna&quot;, as Sergey Solovyov called her, was all the more extraordinary, as upper-class Muscovite women were confined to the upper-floor &quot;terem&quot;, veiled and guarded in public, and invariably kept aloof from any open involvement in politics.

==Early life==
Sophia was the third surviving daughter of Tsar Alexis by his first wife, Maria Miloslavskaya. She was the only one of her sisters educated by Simeon Polotsky, who also taught Tsar Alexis&#x27; heirs Tsarevich Alexei and Tsarevich Feodor. After the death of her brother Tsar Feodor III on 27 April 1682, Sophia unexpectedly entered Russian politics, trying to prevent her young half-brother, the 9-year old Peter Alekseyevich from bypassing his 16-year-old elder brother Tsarevich Ivan and inheriting the throne.

==Rise to regency==
Although Sophia emerged from the shadows during the dynastic struggles of 1682, her prior influences can help to explain her ascendance to the regency. At the previous change of ruler in 1676, Sophia may have acted in the interest of her brother, Feodor, as various rumours exist of her pleading then with her father, the dying Tsar Alexis, not to proclaim Peter his heir. Feodor&#x27;s capability to lead Russia was questioned, based on his weak nature and poor health. His mental ability developed quite nicely over time, as he was taught by Simeon Polotsky. During Feodor III&#x27;s brief reign (1676–1682), many historians argue, Feodor actually &quot;ruled under the protectorate of Sophia his sister&quot;.

As the young Tsar Feodor&#x27;s health began to decline, more individuals rose up to counsel him, and Sophia found her influence steadily declining. Taking advantage of a court never open to a woman in her situation, she utilized her connections, making allies and formally planning on securing the throne. When Feodor died on , Sophia immediately returned to the political scene. She attended her brother&#x27;s funeral and caused a commotion while doing so. In Sophia&#x27;s age, the female relatives of the tsar were kept away from the court and other political spheres, and funerals traditionally took place without women. Sophia stormed into the funeral, insisting on her presence and simultaneously setting off a chain of events that would result in her regency.

The Miloslavsky party, grouped around the family of Feodor and Sophia, took advantage of the Streltsy uprising to place Sophia on the seat of power. Tsar Alexis had left behind two families by his two wives, and each of the two branches had at least one male heir. As the clans of Alexis&#x27; two wives were in conflict, Sophia devised a plan to ensure power for herself and her family. Promoting the case of her full brother Ivan as the legitimate heir to the throne, Sophia attempted to convince the patriarch and the boyars that they should reverse their recent decision to crown Peter. Insisting that Peter&#x27;s proclamation broke monarchic laws by skipping over her brother, who would have been next in line to rule if not for his ineptitude, she proposed a shared crown with Ivan and herself.

Upon the court&#x27;s swift and unanimous rejection of this proposal, Sophia reached out to the discouraged military troop, the streltsy, for their aid and support. The unjust dismissal of Ivan&#x27;s rights acted as a catalyst to the already displeased and frustrated troops. Multiple issues, including merciless motivational tactics and lack of rest, drove the streltsy to violent opposition against the &quot;unjust&quot; election of Peter. As the fighting ceased and Peter&#x27;s life was left forever scarred by the blood spilt by his Naryshkin relatives, the streltsy achieved their initial demands.

In the aftermath of the streltsy rebellion, on 25 June 1682 the Patriarch Ioakim crowned the incompetent Ivan as senior tsar (Ivan V) and Peter, only nine years old, as junior tsar. Sophia had been deemed the sole intellectually mature member of the ruling family at the time of Feodor&#x27;s death, making her the favourite to govern on behalf of the child Peter and of the inept Ivan. Using political and practical knowledge she had acquired by Feodor&#x27;s side, Sophia convinced the nobles and the patriarch of her capacity to rule Russia. As Sophia had arranged before Tsar Feodor&#x27;s death, Vasily Golitsyn was installed as &quot;de facto&quot; head of government, executing most of the policies during her regency.

==Romantic life==
Sophia&#x27;s relationship with Prince Golitsyn was not necessarily a romantic attachment. Golitsyn had a wife and a large family at a time when the boyars were still attached to the Domostroy, a matrimonial code from Ivan IV&#x27;s reign. Several early 18th-century memoirs gave birth to rumours that Golitsyn had been Sophia&#x27;s lover. Some see the evidence for this in the tone of Sophia&#x27;s correspondence with him in 1689.

In any case, a romantic interaction between the two could not begin when they met under Feodor&#x27;s rule. Feodor entrusted great confidence in Golitsyn, and there remains no evidence Sophia and Vasily acted against customs that would have kept them apart until after his death. There is no suspicion of any relations until the letter in 1689, even during the period of Golitsyn&#x27;s rise to power.

==Regency==

When the Old Believers joined the rebels in the fall of 1682 and demanded the reversal of Nikon&#x27;s reforms, Sophia lost control of the unsteady Streltsy to her once ally, Prince Ivan Khovansky. After aiding Sophia in May, Khovansky used his influence with the troops to force her court to flee the Moscow Kremlin and seek refuge in the Troitse-Sergiyeva Lavra. The streltsy rebels, who instigated the rebellion, hoped to depose Sophia and to make Prince Ivan Khovansky a new regent, to satisfy their increasing desire for concessions. Calling together the gentry militia, Sophia suppressed the so-called Khovanshchina with the help of Fyodor Shaklovityi, who succeeded Khovansky in charge of the Muscovite army. Silencing the dissatisfied parties until Peter reached his age of majority, Sophia executed Khovansky and the other figureheads of the attempted rebellion.

During the seven years of her regency, Sophia made a few concessions to posads and loosened detention policies towards runaway peasants, which caused dissatisfaction among the nobles. She also made an effort to further the organization of the military. Intrigued by baroque style architecture, Sophia held responsibility for the promotion of the foreign district, and the creation of the Slavonic-Greek-Latin Academy, the first Russian higher learning institution.

The most important highlights of her foreign policy, as engineered by Golitsyn, were the Eternal Peace Treaty of 1686 with Poland, the 1689 Treaty of Nerchinsk with China, and the Crimean campaigns against Turkey. Although spearheaded by Prince Golitsyn, Sophia&#x27;s reign oversaw two of the earliest diplomatic treaties and underwent inner growth and progress. Despite her other achievements, Sophia&#x27;s influence and effect on a young Peter remains as the most historically significant portion of her reign, as the rebellion of 1682 bred a distrust in nobility that came to define his leadership.

==Downfall==
Sophia Alekseyevna&#x27;s regency retained the trappings of a typical regent, and the true tsar was growing into his position with every passing year. At the age of 16, Peter I demanded that Golitsyn report to him regarding all matters, and the Naryshkin family prepared for their long-awaited ascension to power. In 1688, Peter began to promote within his clan, and Sophia remained powerless to halt the gradual shift in control. During this time period, the regent disregarded the young tsar, letting him train his Preobrazhensky and Semenovsky Guards in Preobrazhenskoe.

Although some historians claim Sophia made conscious attempts to neutralize Peter, and remove him from the political world, her involvement remains unclear. Sophia and her party had discussed crowning her as tsarina, and in August 1687 had tried persuading the Streltsy to petition on her behalf. Denied their aid, Sophia and her supporters found themselves on the decline in 1688, as the Crimean war brought rioting and unrest to Moscow. To worsen the situation, Peter had married, readying himself for rule, and Ivan V fathered a girl, eliminating any potential claim to the throne from that branch.

Tensions between the two factions continued to grow, until Peter I turned 17 years of age, when his Naryshkin relatives demanded that Sophia step down. In response, Shaklovityi advised Sophia to proclaim herself tsarina and attempted to induce the Streltsy to a new uprising. Most of the Streltsy units deserted central Moscow for the suburb of Preobrazhenskoye and later for the Troitse-Sergiyeva Lavra, where the young tsar was living. Feeling the power slipping from her hands, Sophia sent the boyars and the Patriarch to Peter, asking him to join her in the Kremlin. He flatly refused her overtures, demanding Shaklovityi&#x27;s execution and Golitsyn&#x27;s exile.

After Sophia agreed to surrender her senior boyars, she was arrested and forced to withdraw to the Novodevichy Convent without formally taking the veil. Sophia may have made one last attempt at securing power, although her involvement is unclear. Regardless of her conscious intent, her fate was sealed ten years later, when the Streltsy attempted to reinstate her in the Kremlin during Peter&#x27;s absence from the country. This uprising was suppressed with an iron hand, and soon the corpses of the rebels were suspended in front of Sophia&#x27;s windows. Having taken the veil, she was kept in the strictest seclusion, with other nuns not allowed to see her except on Easter Sunday. She died in the Novodevichy Convent six years later.

==In popular culture==

Sophia Alekseyevna appears as a minor character in the wuxia novel &quot;The Deer and the Cauldron&quot; by Jin Yong. In the novel, the protagonist Wei Xiaobao went to Russia and helped her in the coup against her half-brother Peter I. This event led to the peace between China and Russia in the Nerchinsk Treaty.

Vanessa Redgrave portrayed the character of Sophia Alekseyevna in the 1986 miniseries &quot;Peter the Great&quot;. Her performance received an Emmy award nomination for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Miniseries.

<text>Catherine-Dominique de Pérignon, 1st [[Marquess|Marquis]] de Pérignon (, 31 May 1754 in Grenade – 25 December 1818) was a French general during the French Revolutionary Wars, and was appointed Marshal of the Empire in 1804 by Napoleon Bonaparte.

==Early life==
Pérignon was born to a family of the lesser nobility in Grenade-sur-Garonne, Languedoc. After a &quot;roturier&quot; appointment in the grenadier corps of the Aquitaine Regiment, he retired to his estate. Pérignon welcomed the French Revolution, and gained a seat in the Legislative Assembly (1791), where he sat on the Right, but soon resigned and made his military career during the French Revolutionary Wars.

==Revolutionary Wars==
From 1793 to 1795, Pérignon held commands in the Army of the Eastern Pyrenees, defeating the Spanish troops at the battle of Escola with &quot;a sombre kind of energy&quot;. He succeeded Jacques François Dugommier as army commander after that general&#x27;s death at the Battle of the Black Mountain. He successfully concluded the Siege of Roses in early 1795. In 1796, he was elected by Haute-Garonne to the Council of Five Hundred. He became the French Directory&#x27;s ambassador to Spain, concluding the Treaty of San Ildefonso against the Kingdom of Great Britain.

Pérignon subsequently became involved in a smuggling affair and was compromised by a young woman who was a Royalist spy. In 1798 he was recalled and remanded to the Army in Liguria where he was assigned to command the left wing. Wounded and captured by Second Coalition armies at the Battle of Novi, he returned to France in 1800.

==Empire and Restoration==
Pérignon was a supporter of Napoleon Bonaparte, and was made a senator (1801), Marshal (1804) and count of the French Empire; in 1805, he received the Legion of Honor. From September 18, 1806, to July 23, 1808, he was the Governor-general of the Duchy of Parma. Later moved to the Kingdom of Naples, Pérignon, recently ennobled, became a close acquaintance of the royal couple (King Joachim Murat and Caroline Bonaparte).

He returned to France in 1814 and rallied to the Bourbon Restoration and Louis XVIII - he was stricken off the list of Marshals during the Hundred Days, and voted in favor of the death penalty for Michel Ney. He was raised to &quot;marquis de Pérignon&quot;, a Peer of France, and awarded the Order of Saint Louis. As Dr. George Ostermann commented, &quot;M. de Perignon died as if the Empire he served well, though reluctantly, had never existed.&quot;

<doc id="761832" wikidata="Q61695" url="?curid=761832" title="Leopold I, Prince of Anhalt-Dessau">
<text>Leopold I, Prince of Anhalt-Dessau (3 July 1676 – 7 April 1747) was a German prince of the House of Ascania and ruler of the Principality of Anhalt-Dessau from 1693 to 1747. He was also a &quot;Generalfeldmarschall&quot; in the Prussian Army. Nicknamed &quot;the Old Dessauer&quot; (German: &quot;der alte Dessauer&quot;), he possessed good abilities as a field commander, but was mainly remembered as a talented drillmaster who modernized the Prussian infantry.

Appointed by Frederick I to the rank of field marshal in 1712, Leopold distinguished himself for his success during the War of the Spanish Succession. He was later appointed the commander of the Prussian-Saxon army during the Great Northern War against Sweden. Leopold was a personal friend of Frederick William I. The last great achievement of his military career was commanding the Prussian troops to victory over the Saxons at the Battle of Kesselsdorf in 1745 during the Second Silesian War.

==Early life==
Leopold was born in Dessau as the ninth of ten children (and the younger of only two sons) of John George II, Prince of Anhalt-Dessau, by his wife Henriette Catherine, daughter of Frederick Henry, Prince of Orange. An older brother had died well before Leopold was born.

From his earliest youth he devoted himself to military pursuits, for which he educated himself both physically and mentally. He became colonel of a Prussian regiment in 1693, and in the same year inherited his own principality; for the remainder of his long life, he performed the duties of a sovereign prince and a Prussian officer simultaneously.

Leopold&#x27;s first campaign was that of 1695 in the Netherlands, in which he was present at the Siege of Namur. He remained in the field to the end of the war of 1697, the affairs of the principality being managed chiefly by his mother, the Dowager Princess Henriette Katharina (in fact, she had been acting as regent since the death of his father until he reached adulthood the same year, but continued in charge of the government of Anhalt-Dessau for some time after he attained his majority).

==Military career==

===War of the Spanish Succession===

Leopold&#x27;s career as a soldier in important commands began with the outbreak of the War of the Spanish Succession in 1701. He had many improvements made in the Prussian army, notably the introduction of the iron ramrod about 1700, and he now took the field at the head of a Prussian corps on the Rhine, serving at the sieges of Kaiserswerth and Venlo in 1702. In the following year, having obtained the rank of lieutenant-general, Leopold took part in the Siege of Bonn and fought as part of the Battle of Hochstadt, in which the Austrians and their Prussian allies were defeated by the French under Marshal Claude-Louis-Hector de Villars on 20 September 1703. In the campaign of 1704 the Prussian contingent served first under Louis William, Margrave of Baden-Baden, then Prince Eugene of Savoy, and fought at Blenheim.

In 1705 Leopold was sent with a Prussian corps to join Prince Eugene in Italy, and on 16 August fought at the Battle of Cassano. In the Battle of Turin, he was the first to enter the hostile entrenchments (7 September 1706). He served in one more campaign in Italy, and then served under Eugene to join Marlborough in the Netherlands, being present in 1709 at the Siege of Tournai and the Battle of Malplaquet.

In 1710 Leopold succeeded to the command of the entire Prussian contingent at the French front, and in 1712, he was made a field marshal at the particular request of the crown prince of Prussia, Frederick William, who had served with him as a volunteer. Shortly before this he had executed a &quot;coup de main&quot; on the castle of Moers, which had been held by the Dutch in defiance of the claims of the Prussian king to its possession. The operation was effected with absolute precision and the castle was seized without a shot being fired. In the earlier part of the reign of Frederick William I, the prince of Dessau was one of the most influential members of the Prussian governing circle.

===Great Northern War===

Although Prussia was hostile to Sweden, the Prussians were reluctant to participate in the Great Northern War. Only after the Russians destroyed most of the Swedish army did Prussia enter the war in 1715. Leopold accompanied the king to the front, commanded an army of 40,000 men, and defeated the much smaller force of Charles XII of Sweden in a hard-fought battle on the island of Rügen on 16 November in alliance with the Danish army of Stralsund. In peacetime, and especially after a court quarrel and duel with General Friedrich Wilhelm von Grumbkow in 1725, he devoted himself to the training of the Prussian army.

===Training the Prussian Army===

Although the reputation gained by the Prussian army in the wars fought between 1675 and 1715 was a good one, it was still considered one of the minor military forces in Europe by 1740, when the War of the Austrian Succession broke out. Leopold&#x27;s outstanding achievement just before this time was his training of the Prussian infantry. The &quot;Old Dessauer&quot; was one of the sternest disciplinarians in an age of stern discipline, and the technical training of the infantry under his hand made the Prussian infantry into a formidable fighting force whose effectiveness had not yet been demonstrated. Leopold was essentially an infantry soldier; in his time, artillery usually did not decide battles, but he nonetheless chose to neglect the cavalry service, with results that manifested themselves at the Battle of Mollwitz in 1741. Frederick II of Prussia led the cavalry himself at the battles of Hohenfriedberg in 1745 and Leuthen in 1757, but had it not been for the supporting infantry trained by Leopold he would never have had the opportunity to do so.

Thus Leopold, with the steadfast support of King Frederick William I of Prussia, himself one of the greatest drillmasters of Europe, turned to good account the twenty years following the peace with Sweden. During this time two incidents in his career deserve special mention: firstly, his intervention in the case of the crown prince Frederick, who was court-martialed for desertion, but due to his efforts reinstated in the Prussian army; and secondly, his successful role in the War of the Polish Succession on the Rhine, where he served under his old chief Eugene of Savoy and held the office of Field Marshal of the Empire.

===Service under Frederick the Great===
With the death of Frederick William in 1740, Frederick the Great succeeded to the Prussian throne, and a few months later initiated the invasion and conquest of Silesia, the first action in the long Silesian Wars and the test of Leopold&#x27;s lifelong efforts to improve the effectiveness of the Prussian army. The prince himself was not often employed in the king&#x27;s own army, though his sons held high commands under Frederick. The king, indeed, found Leopold somewhat difficult to manage, and the prince spent most of the campaigning years up to 1745 in command of an army of observation on the Saxon frontier.

Early in that year his wife died. Leopold was now over seventy, but his last campaign was destined to be the most successful of his long career. A combined effort of the Austrians and Saxons to retrieve the disasters of the summer by a winter campaign towards Berlin itself led to a hurried concentration of the Prussians. Frederick from Silesia checked the Austrian main army and hastened towards Dresden. But before Frederick arrived, Leopold had decided the war by means of his overwhelming victory over Saxons at Kesselsdorf on 14 December 1745. It was his habit to pray before battle, for he was a devout Lutheran. On this last field his words were, &quot;O Lord God, let me not be disgraced in my old days. Or if Thou wilt not help me, do not help these scoundrels, but leave us to try it ourselves.&quot; Leopold&#x27;s career ended with this great victory; when Frederick arrived after the battle, he embraced the Old Dessauer personally. Leopold retired from active service, and the short remainder of his life was spent at Dessau.

He was succeeded as prince of Anhalt-Dessau by his son, Leopold II Maximilian. Another of his sons, Dietrich of Anhalt-Dessau, was a Prussian general, but the most famous of his sons was Moritz of Anhalt-Dessau.

==Marriage and issue==

As a young prince, Leopold fell in love with Anna Louise Föhse (&quot;Fösen&quot; according to some sources) (Dessau, 22 March 1677 – Dessau, 5 February 1745), an apothecary&#x27;s daughter in Dessau. His mother, the Dowager Princess, tried to break up the relationship, sending her son abroad for an extended travel, but to no avail. One year after officially becoming an adult in 1697, he married his beloved Anna Louise in Dessau on 8 September 1698, forming a union that was morganatic until the imperial decree of 29 December 1701. The couple had ten children:
#William Gustav (Dessau, 20 June 1699 – Dessau, 16 December 1737), Hereditary Prince of Anhalt-Dessau.
#Leopold II Maximilian (Dessau, 25 December 1700 – Dessau, 16 December 1751), Prince of Anhalt-Dessau.
#Dietrich (Dessau, 2 August 1702 – Dessau, 2 December 1769), later Regent.
#Frederick Henry Eugen (Dessau, 27 December 1705 – Dessau, 2 March 1781).
#Henriette Marie Louise (Dessau, 3 August 1707 – Dessau, 7 August 1707).
#Louise (Dessau, 21 August 1709 – Bernburg, 29 July 1732), married on 25 November 1724 to Victor Frederick, Prince of Anhalt-Bernburg.
#Maurice (Dessau, 31 October 1712 – Dessau, 11 April 1760).
#Anna Wilhelmine (Dessau, 13 June 1715 – Dessau, 2 April 1780).
#Leopoldine Marie (Oranienbaum, 12 December 1716 – Kolberg, 27 January 1782), married on 13 February 1739 to Frederick Henry, Margrave of Brandenburg-Schwedt.
#Henriette Amalie (Dessau, 7 December 1720 – Dessau, 5 December 1793).

On 29 December 1701 Anna Louise was created an Imperial Princess (German: &quot;Reichsfürstin&quot;) by the Emperor Leopold I, who also declared that their children would be considered princes and princesses of Anhalt (as all of them arguably, and the two born before this decree certainly, would not have otherwise) and would enjoy all the rights that other princes of the Empire enjoy. King Frederick I of Prussia extended his personal guarantee on 12 March 1702, promising to recognize the rights of the issue of this marriage. The agnates of all the branches of Anhalt also gave their agreement a few days later, on 21 March.

Leopold&#x27;s court Jew Moses Benjamin Wulff played an important role in the ennobling of Anna.

Leopold and Anna Louise enjoyed a long and happy marriage, and the princess acquired an influence over her husband that she never ceased to exert on behalf of his subjects. After the death of Leopold&#x27;s mother she performed the duties of regent when he was absent on campaign. Often, too, she accompanied him into the field.

In later life, however, Leopold sired two illegitimate sons by one Sophie Eleonore Söldner (Ellrich, 7 September 1710 – Dessau, 16 September 1779):

#John Georg Henry von Berenhorst (Sandersleben, 26 October 1733 – Dessau, 30 October 1814), who married first in Zöberitz on 8 May 1781 to Katharina Christiane Maria Otto, but divorced in 1783; in Köthen on 26 October 1783 he married for a second time to Henriette Christine Karoline von Bülow (Predel, 30 June 1765 – Dessau, 29 August 1813), with whom he had six children, one son, George John (whose descendants in the male line became extinct in 1952), and five daughters: Louise Sophie, Eugenie Johanne (d. in infancy), Wilhelmine Henriette, Klara Hedwig, and Thekla Pauline, who, from her first marriage to Julius, Freiherr von Richthofen, was a great-grandmother of Manfred von Richthofen.
#Karl Franz von Berenhorst (Sandersleben, 1 March 1735 – Dessau, 6 June 1804), married in Schweinitz on 7 February 1785 to Johanne Eleonore Scholtz; their two sons, Henry Karl and George Franz, were killed in battle; neither of them married or had children.

<text>A Game of Thrones: The Card Game (or AGoT, for short) is an out-of-print collectible card game produced by Fantasy Flight Games. It is based on &quot;A Song of Ice and Fire&quot;, a series of novels written by George R. R. Martin. The first set was Westeros Edition and was released in August 2002. It has since won two Origins Awards. The game&#x27;s primary designer is Eric Lang, the lead developer is Nate French, with Damon Stone serving as associate designer. 

In late 2007, the A Game of Thrones CCG was converted to the A Game of Thrones LCG (Living Card Game), which ended the random booster packs in favor of fixed packs. The game continued until FFG launched a 2nd edition of this LCG in 2015.

In the game, players assume the leadership of one of the great houses of Westeros vying for control of King&#x27;s Landing and the Iron Throne. To accomplish this, players launch military attacks against their opponents, undermine their opponents’ plans with intrigues of their own, and make power plays to win the support of the realm.

==Factions==
Each house represents one of the main factions involved in the struggle for the Iron Throne emulated by the AGoT LCG. Each house provides different strengths and weaknesses, allowing for various play styles to interact within the same game. Certain cards are restricted to one or two houses, giving each house a unique flavor. Currently, there are eight playable factions in the AGoT LCG. Each is identified by a shield bearing the arms of the house, located in the upper right corner of the card.

===Great houses===
* House Stark, the honorable rulers of the cold North. The Stark shield is a grey direwolf on an ice-white field. Prominent Stark characters include Lord Eddard Stark and his wife Catelyn, their son Robb, as well as Maester Luwin, Ser Rodrik Cassel, and Brynden &quot;The Blackfish&quot; Tully. Common game mechanics include direct kill, deck searching, and improved defense. Many Stark effects are themed around military challenges.
* House Lannister, the rich and treacherous residents of Casterly Rock. The Lannister shield is a gold lion on a crimson field. Prominent Lannister characters include Jaime, Cersei, and Tyrion Lannister, as well as Ser Gregor Clegane, Ser Addam Marbrand, and Grand Maester Pycelle. Common game mechanics include card draw, kneeling effects, and trait manipulation. Many Lannister effects are themed around intrigue challenges.
* House Baratheon, the royal blood of King Robert, rulers of Dragonstone and Storm&#x27;s End. The Baratheon shield is a black crowned stag on a gold field. Prominent Baratheon characters include Robert, his brothers Stannis and Renly, as well as Melisandre, Ser Davos Seaworth, and the Loras Tyrell, the Knight of Flowers. Common game mechanics include power manipulation, standing effects, and retrieval of cards from the dead and discard piles. Many House Baratheon effects are themed around power challenges.
* House Greyjoy, the rulers of the Iron Islands and the Ironborn raiders who prey on the rest of Westeros. The Greyjoy shield is a gold kraken on a black field. Prominent Greyjoy characters include Theon, Asha, and their father Balon Greyjoy, as well Balon&#x27;s brothers Euron Crow&#x27;s Eye and Aeron Damphair. Common game mechanics include location control, the ability to save characters, event cancels, and boosting the strength of attacking characters. Many house Greyjoy effects are themed around winning unopposed challenges.
* House Targaryen, the exiled descendants of Aegon the Conqueror and their exotic followers. The Targaryen shield is a red on black, three-headed dragon representing Aegon and his sisters. Prominent Targaryen characters include Daenerys Targaryen and her three dragons, Khal Drogo, Ser Jorah Mormont, and Grey Worm. Common game mechanics include attachment manipulation, strength reducers and kill effects on strength 0 characters (frequently referred to as &quot;burn&quot; effects), and playing characters outside of the marshalling phase. Many Targaryen effects are themed around winning or losing challenges by 4 or more strength.
* House Martell, rulers of the desert realm of Dorne, the southernmost region of Westeros. The Martell shield is a red sun pierced by a golden spear, on an orange field. Prominent Martell characters include Doran Martell, Oberyn Martell the Red Viper, his daughters the Sand Snakes, and his niece Arianne Martell. Common game mechanics include icon manipulation, discard effects, stealth, and card draw. Many Martell effects are themed around losing challenges, leading to such effects being referred to as &quot;revenge&quot; effects.

===Other factions===
Some great houses featured in &quot;A Song of Ice and Fire&quot; are not represented as individual Houses in the &quot;AGoT&quot; LCG, but still appear in the game. House Tully is present in the game as a subset of their allies, House Stark. House Lannister and House Baratheon both feature numerous House Tyrell cards, and several significant House Tyrell characters were featured as promotional cards. House Tyrell also features prominently in the &quot;A House of Thorns&quot; expansion, as does House Bolton to a smaller extent. Other lesser houses also appear in the game, in service to the Great Houses to which they are sworn. Several House Frey cards also make an appearance, primarily as neutral cards. House Arryn is a prominent theme in &quot;A House of Talons&quot;.

In addition to the noble houses, the &quot;AGoT&quot; LCG also features many other factions present in &quot;A Song of Ice and Fire&quot; as part of a particular theme. Example: The Wildlings are featured in &quot;Winter Block&quot;, while the Asshai&#x27;i have been a sub theme over many expansions.

==Cards==
Each player supplies his or her own deck to play the game. A deck consists of a &quot;House Card&quot; or &quot;Alliance&quot; to represent the player&#x27;s faction, an optional &quot;Agenda&quot; that modifies his faction, a plot deck that consists of exactly seven &quot;Plot&quot; cards, and then a main draw deck of at least 60 cards consisting of &quot;Characters&quot;, &quot;Attachments&quot;, &quot;Locations&quot;, and &quot;Events&quot;.

===House cards===
Each House card represents one of the main factions involved in the War of the Five Kings. Each House provides different strengths and weaknesses, allowing for various playstyles to interact within the same game. The House card selected will often restrict cards allowed in the remainder of the deck, by limiting cards that are marked as being allowed solely for another House.

Characters, Locations, and Attachments often have a House affiliation, and often are used in decks running a matching House card. Some cards have no House affiliation, and such neutral cards may be used freely in any deck. Cards with House affiliations other than the chosen House card may be used, providing the card itself has no restriction, but require an extra expenditure of resources to bring them into play.

===Agenda cards (optional)===
Introduced in Valyrian Block, any deck using a House card (but not an Alliance card) may use one Agenda card. Agenda cards either modify the rules for building the player&#x27;s deck, or grant an in-game advantage, typically at the cost of some other disadvantage such as requiring extra power to win, reduced card draw, or limiting claimed power.

===Plot cards===
Plot cards are generally regarded as the defining feature of &quot;A Game of Thrones: The Card Game&quot;. Unlike the shuffled and randomly drawn resource deck, at the beginning of each round, each player chooses a new plot card to be revealed, which will have an effect on the round to be played, allowing for a strategic element to an otherwise random game.

Plot cards indicate the base amount of gold available for the player to use to bring new cards into play during his &quot;Marshalling&quot; phase (indicated by a number within a gold coin), a base initiative value to determine the order of play for the round (indicated by a number within a diamond), a base claim value to determine the scope of the effect that player winning a challenge (indicated by a number in a silver disk), and a text box detailing any other effects or restrictions on the plot card, including any &quot;traits&quot; that it might have.

Most plot cards are designed with built-in trade-offs, sacrificing high claim for low income, or some other game mechanic drawback.

===Character cards===
Character cards represent the unique characters from the &quot;A Song of Ice and Fire&quot; novels, such as Eddard Stark, as well as generic individuals and massed groupings (such as armies) that can be found there. Generally, characters are the main focus of a deck as they are the principle card type used to participate in challenges, and thus collect the power tokens necessary to win.

Attributes of a Character card consist of a gold cost (generally represented by a number overlaid on a gold coin in the upper left corner), a name across the top that may be preceded by a black flag if the character is unique and/or an infinity symbol if the character is &quot;endless&quot;, a House affiliation (represented by one or more House shields in the upper right corner, although neutral characters will have a blank shield), artwork depicting the character in the top half of the card, a strength value (represented by a number on a stylized tapestry or a nondescript shield in the middle of the left side), zero to three challenge icons (a red axe represents Military, a green eye represents Intrigue, and a blue crown represents Power) arrayed in the bottom half of the left side, and a text box in the lower half of the card.

Within the textbox may be &quot;traits&quot;, &quot;keywords&quot;, other game effects or icons, and flavour text from the novels. Traits are bold and italicized words at the top of the textbox, and usually represent roles or groups within the world of &quot;A Song of Ice and Fire&quot;, such as Lords or Dothraki. They have no game function themselves, but instead are used to group characters together in order for other game effects to be used by or against varied groups of characters. Keywords are game mechanics defined in the rules that affect that character, such as No Attachments, which prevents any attachments from being placed on that character.

===Attachment cards===
Attachments are cards that are used exclusively to modify other cards. An attachment may not be in play unless it is attached to the proper type of card, typically a character card unless the attachment itself says otherwise.

Attributes of an Attachment card consist of a gold cost (generally represented by a number overlaid on a gold coin in the upper left corner), a name across the top that may be proceeded by a black flag if the attachment is unique and/or an infinity symbol if the attachment is &quot;endless&quot;, a House affiliation (represented by one or more House shields in the upper right corner, although neutral attachments will have no shield), artwork depicting the attachment in the top half of the card, and a text box in the lower half of the card. Throughout the Winter block, some cards were printed with a black crow icon in the bottom left corner to indicate the attachment is &quot;Doomed&quot;. It is unknown if such attachments will appear again.

Within the textbox may be &quot;traits&quot;, &quot;keywords&quot;, other game effects or icons, and flavour text from the novels. Traits are bold and italicized words at the top of the textbox, and usually represent types of enhancements, such as skills or titles. They have no game function themselves, but instead are used to group attachments together in order for other game effects to be used by or against varied groups of attachments. Keywords are game mechanics defined in the rules that affect that attachment such as Setup, which allows the attachment to be played at the beginning of the game unlike normal attachments.

Occasionally, game effects can cause cards to become face-down attachments attached to specific other cards. These function the same as normal attachments, except they are treated as having no names, no text, no gold costs, no House affiliations, and are discarded if they are ever forced to leave play.

===Location cards===
Location cards represent the unique places in the setting of the &quot;A Song of Ice and Fire&quot; novels, such as King&#x27;s Landing, generic regions such as fiefdoms, and even mobile locations such as sailing vessels and warships. Many locations are used to supply additional &quot;income&quot;, &quot;influence&quot;, but a wide variety of effects are present.

Attributes of a Location card consist of a gold cost (generally represented by a number overlaid on a gold coin in the upper left corner), a name across the top that may be preceded by a black flag if the location is unique, a House affiliation (represented by one or more House shields in the upper right corner, although neutral locations will have no shield), artwork depicting the location in the top half of the card, and a text box in the lower half of the card.

Within the textbox may be &quot;traits&quot;, &quot;keywords&quot;, other game effects or icons, and flavour text from the novels. Traits are bold and italicized words at the top of the textbox, and usually represent regions within the world of A Song of Ice and Fire, such as Westeros or Dorne. They have no game function themselves, but instead are used to group locations together in order for other game effects to be used by or against varied groups of locations. Keywords are game mechanics defined in the rules that affect that location, such as Limited which restricts the player to playing one such card per round.

===Event cards===
Event cards represent special actions or happenings from the &quot;A Song of Ice and Fire&quot; novels that can be used in the course of the game. Certain events may be restricted so that they may only be played by a specific House, and some may only affect cards of a particular House affiliation. Event cards generally have a play restriction or a cost of some type which may be paid in influence, gold, or possibly by modifying the game state of one or more characters, locations, attachments or house card.

Attributes of an Event card consist of a name across the top that may be preceded by a black flag if the event is unique and/or an infinity symbol if the event is &quot;endless&quot;, artwork depicting the event in the top half of the card, and a text box in the lower half of the card.

Within the textbox may be &quot;traits&quot;, &quot;keywords&quot;, but primarily will be one or more game effects, and flavour text from the novels. Traits are bold and italicized words at the top of the textbox, and usually represent specific types of events such as &quot;Small Council&quot;. They have no game function themselves, but instead are used to group events together in order for other game effects to be used by or against varied groups of events. Keywords are game mechanics defined in the rules that affect that event, such as Deathbound directing a used event to the dead pile instead of the normal discard pile.

==Rules==

===Deck construction===
Each player participating in an A Game of Thrones game uses two decks: 1) a 7 card &quot;plot&quot; deck and 2) a 60+ (40+ for draft) card &quot;draw&quot; deck of &quot;characters&quot;, &quot;attachments&quot;, &quot;locations&quot;, and &quot;events&quot;. During play the &quot;draw&quot; deck cards will often end up in other game play areas including the &quot;discard pile&quot; (cards discarded from play) and the &quot;dead pile&quot; (cards that were killed or are marked with the Deathbound keyword). Typically, players are only allowed three copies of any particular card (as determined by the card name, regardless of card type or game text similarity) in their &quot;draw&quot; deck, and only one copy of any particular card, by name, in their &quot;plot&quot; deck, but these restrictions can be modified by some other cards, such as the Twins agenda.

===Winning conditions===
A player must earn 15 power tokens between their House card and characters in play to win A Game of Thrones. Numerous cards in the game can change the amount a player or his opponent are required to earn in order to win. Generally, power tokens are earned by winning challenges against an opponent, but some cards allow a player to directly claim power for his House card or characters in other ways.

===Setup===
At the beginning of the game, each player shuffles their &quot;draw&quot; deck, and draws the top 7 cards, with an option for a &quot;mulligan&quot; given to each player to shuffle and draw a new hand. From this initial hand, each player is able to select up to 5 gold worth of characters, locations, and attachments with the Setup keyword, but no more than 1 card of any type with the Limited keyword, from their hand; these cards are placed face-down until all players are ready to reveal their initial cards in play. Once all cards are revealed, players draw cards again until they each have 7 cards in their hand again.

===Rounds and phases===
The game is played through repeated rounds until one or more players meets the winning condition, or all but one player has met the elimination condition. Rounds are divided into 7 phases, with each phase allowing players to alternate actions that affect the game state in some way.

The first phase every round is the &quot;Plot&quot; phase. Each player selects one unused plot from his &quot;plot&quot; deck, and all players reveal their chosen plots simultaneously. Initiative values from plot cards and other resources are tallied, and the player with the highest initiative chooses which player will go first in each phase of the current round. The textbox effects of plots are then resolved in the order chosen by the first player.

In the second phase, the &quot;Draw&quot; phase, each player is allowed to draw two cards from their &quot;draw&quot; deck.

Although divided into turns for each player, the &quot;Marshalling&quot; phase is a single phase for all players. At the beginning of each player&#x27;s turn in the Marshalling phase, the player counts all income from plot card and any other resources available. The player is then able to bring new resources in the form of characters, locations, and attachments into play by spending the gold. Some events and other triggered effects also require the payment of gold, and unused income is not carried over into other rounds, so resource management is important.

The fourth phase is the &quot;Challenge&quot; phase. As with the &quot;Marshalling&quot; phase, each player has a turn to initiate challenges against other players. Generally, players may initiate one each of &quot;Military&quot;, &quot;Intrigue&quot;, and &quot;Power&quot; challenges each round, but several cards can allow extra challenges to be initiated or deny certain challenges at all. Also, in a multiplayer game, he can either use all his challenges on one opponent or divide them among his adversaries. He doesn&#x27;t have to use all of them. Challenges can be initiated in any order, and require a player to &quot;kneel&quot; one or more characters with an icon matching the challenge type to begin the challenge. Then, the player being attacked may kneel one or more characters to attempt to oppose the challenge. Once all player actions are taken, the player with the highest total strength in the challenge wins. If the defending player wins, nothing special occurs, but if the attacker wins, then the defender suffers losses depending on the type of challenge initiated.
* Military - if the defending player loses, he must &quot;kill&quot; a number of characters he controls equal to the claim value on the attacker&#x27;s plot.
* Intrigue - if the defending player loses, he must randomly discard a number of cards from hand equal to the claim value on the attacker&#x27;s plot.
* Power - if the defending player loses, he must remove a number of power tokens from his House card equal to the claim value on the attacker&#x27;s plot, and place them on the attacker&#x27;s House card.

In the fifth phase, the &quot;Dominance&quot; phase, each player counts the total strength of all controlled characters that are still &quot;standing&quot;, plus the amount of gold still remaining in his possession (unspent). The player with the highest total wins dominance that round, and claims 1 power token for his House, taken from the power common pool.

In the &quot;Standing&quot; phase each player changes each &quot;kneeling&quot; card to &quot;standing&quot;.

With the LCG format came a new phase, the &quot;Taxation&quot; phase, in which each player returns unspent gold to the common pool (in the CCG format, players could not use gold outside of their turn in the Marshalling phase).

===Common game terms and rules===
&quot;Kneeling&quot; and &quot;standing&quot; are the two possible game states for each card in the game, although there is a special &quot;moribund&quot; state that&#x27;s further explained in the faq on FFG website. &quot;Standing&quot; cards are upright, and are ready for use to pay for effects, or to initiate or defend challenges. &quot;Kneeling&quot; cards are rotated 90 degrees to the side, to indicate that they&#x27;ve been used to pay for an effect, or to initiate or defend a challenge. Some game effects are able to &quot;kneel&quot; cards (changing them from &quot;standing&quot; to &quot;kneeling&quot;) or &quot;stand&quot; cards (changing them from &quot;kneeling&quot; to &quot;standing&quot;) in order to manipulate the resources a player has available.

&quot;Unique&quot; cards represent the special individuals, places, items, and happenings in the world of A Song of Ice and Fire. Unique cards may not be played if the player already has a copy of that card in play, or if a copy of that card can be found in the player&#x27;s dead pile. Unique characters, locations, and attachments may be placed with copies that are already in play to serve as &quot;duplicates&quot;. Duplicates may be discarded to save the unique card from being killed or discard.

&quot;Triggered Effects&quot; are a type of game effect that a player chooses to use in order to change the game state in some way. Triggered effects are indicated by a bold name of a phase (one of &quot;Plot&quot;, &quot;Draw&quot;, &quot;Marshalling&quot;, &quot;Challenges&quot;, &quot;Dominance&quot;, or &quot;Standing&quot;) or &quot;Any phase&quot; to indicate when the effect may be used. Another timing word that may precede a triggered effect is a bold &quot;Response&quot;, which indicates that the effect may only be used in response to another occurrence in the game. &quot;Triggered abilities&quot; are a subset of triggered effects, and are specifically triggered effects that are written on cards currently in play.

&quot;Passive Effects&quot; are game effects that have no bold timing restriction indicated, but instead happen whenever certain prerequisites are met, such as a character coming into play.

&quot;Constant Abilities&quot; are game effects written on cards in play that have an ongoing effect on the game state.

&quot;Influence&quot; is indicated on various characters, locations, and attachments in the game by a number on a scroll in the textbox of the card. In the Valyrian block, influence was introduced as an additional resource to manage, requiring players to kneel one or more cards with a specific total amount of influence to pay for an effect.

Normally, once a game effect has been initiated, it fully resolves without an interruption. However, once an effect is begun, there is a chance for specific effects to &quot;Cancel&quot; the initial effect. If the effect is cancelled, all costs stay paid, use limitations remain, but the effects do not occur.

&quot;Kill&quot; means removing a character from play, and placing that character in the &quot;dead pile&quot;. Kill effects only work on characters, including other cards that are currently functioning as characters, but other cards can be placed in the dead pile through various game effects, such as the Deathbound keyword.

&quot;Discard&quot;, when occurring without the modifier &quot;from hand&quot;, means to take a card that is in play, and place it in the &quot;discard pile&quot;.

Generally, whenever an effect targets a card to be killed or discarded, players are given a chance to &quot;Save&quot; the card from the effect, either by discarding a duplicate of the targeted card or by using another game effect. If a card is saved, it is not removed from play, and it is not considered killed or discarded.

==Organized play==

===Night&#x27;s Watch===
Fantasy Flight Games has an official group of volunteers that organize sanctioned tournaments for A Game of Thrones. The Night&#x27;s Watch are named after the guardians of The Wall in northern Westeros in the fictional setting of &quot;A Song of Ice and Fire&quot;. These volunteers organize tournaments, arrange demonstration games for new and interested players, and hand out promotional materials provided by FFG.

===Prizes===
* Gold dragons are a form of loyalty points that were awarded for purchases and playing in tournaments. The packaging for booster packs, starter decks, and premium starter decks all have an image of a gold coin with a number representing the number of gold dragons earned, being one, two, and five respectively. Players could also earn certificates of eighty, forty, and twenty gold dragons for placing first, second, or third (respectively) in a sanctioned tournament. Gold dragons were redeemable to FFG for older promotional cards, booster packs, and other specialized AGoT products, such as card binders, stone house cards, and house-specific power tokens. The Gold Dragon redemption program officially ended on June 30, 2008.
* Promotional cards were frequently provided to Night&#x27;s Watch volunteers by FFG to be given to participants of sanctioned tournaments. Sometimes these cards follow a special theme for the tournament, but that is not always the case. Usually the cards can legally be included in any deck, but some are marked with a skull icon to indicate they cannot be included unless special rules are in effect for that tournament.

===Tournaments===
There are several different official tournament types sanctioned by FFG. In the &quot;Classic&quot; format, players bring their own decks, which may include cards from any set, as long as the card is not on the banned list. In &quot;Standard&quot; format, players bring their own decks, which may only include cards from the most recent blocks. , only cards released since Valyrian block are legal in Standard format. In &quot;Limited&quot; format, players instead build their decks at the tournament, using provided draft packs (in &quot;Limited - Draft&quot;) or starter decks (in &quot;Limited - Sealed Deck&quot;) and booster packs.

Aside from the restrictions on usable card pool, FFG places no limits on how Night&#x27;s Watch volunteers organize the tournaments.

===World and Continental Championships===
The A Game of Thrones World Championships were held yearly at Gen Con Indy until 2012, when they moved to Fantasy Flight&#x27;s Event Centre in Minneapolis, with Gencon being redesignated North American Championships. Part of the winner&#x27;s prize is the opportunity to design their own card.

==Sets and expansions==
When it was released, A Game of Thrones was introduced as a CCG. The cards for the AGoT CCG were organized into numerous sets and expansions that could be mixed together and used interchangeably. A &quot;block&quot; consisted of a &quot;base set&quot;, up to two &quot;expansion sets&quot;, a &quot;premium starter&quot;, and often one or more promotional cards.

Typically, a base set consisted of 240 cards available in either starter decks, consisting of a mix of fixed cards and a random assortment of other cards, or booster packs, consisting of 11 randomly sorted cards, of which 1 is rare, 3 are uncommon, and 7 are common. Booster packs were generally shipped in groups of 36, creating booster boxes. Expansion sets typically contained 150 cards, and were only distributed as booster packs similar to those of a base set. Premium Starters consisted of two or three pre-built decks of fixed cards, typically reprints from earlier sets, but also introducing 10 new cards as well.

Within a base set and expansion set, the cards were divided into groups based on their frequency of appearance, with rare cards being included the least frequent, uncommon cards slightly more frequent, and common cards being the most frequent. Also available in regular and premium starters were a specific number of fixed cards that always appeared in that packaging. Also available were &quot;draft packs&quot; which consisted of 1 &quot;draft&quot; card, 5 &quot;plot&quot; cards, 6 &quot;house&quot; cards and 8 &quot;locations&quot; that are generally useful to any deck, and allow for a more level competitive field during &quot;draft&quot; tournaments.

In late 2007, the A Game of Thrones CCG was converted to the A Game of Thrones LCG (Living Card Game), which ended the random booster packs in favor of fixed packs, called Chapter Packs, released on a roughly monthly basis. Chapter packs consist of 60 fixed cards - 3 copies of 20 cards. The Core Set consists of 4 preconstructed decks consisting of Stark, Lannister, Baratheon, and Targaryen, and is marketed as a starting point for a new player. It will also include a game board, power tokens, gold tokens, as well as game pieces to use for the multiplayer titles. Along with the switch to the LCG, there has also been more of a focus on the multiplayer aspect of the game, now referred to as Melee, rather than the head-to-head play, now referred to as Joust.



Promotional cards are usually provided as prizes for participating in FFG registered tournaments, by attending certain conventions, or buying other A Game of Thrones promotional packages.

==Industry awards==

The game&#x27;s first base set - &quot;Westeros Edition&quot; - won the 2002 Origins Award for &quot;Best Trading Card Game of 2002&quot;. The second base set - &quot;Ice and Fire Edition&quot; - followed next year and won the 2003 Origins Award for &quot;Best Card Game Expansion or Supplement of 2003&quot;.

<doc id="761841" wikidata="Q7357989" url="?curid=761841" title="Roger Clemens Award">
<text>The Roger Clemens Award was an award that honored the top NCAA Division I college baseball pitcher of the year. The award was created prior to the 2004 season and succeeded the Rotary Smith Award.

:&quot;&quot;Roger Clemens has become synonymous with excellence in pitching at the professional level, as evidenced by his six Cy Young Awards. In addition to being a fabulous baseball player at every level in which he has participated, his passion for excellence is unsurpassed. He is mindful of giving back to a sport and a community he loves. With his college and professional resume, his name is most worthy and deserving in recognition of the most outstanding college pitcher. The Roger Clemens Award most certainly will become the college equivalent of the Cy Young, therefore becoming one of the most coveted in college baseball.&quot; CBPY Board Member Ray Mitchell (February 14, 2004)&quot;

Roger Clemens was an extremely successful college player with the Texas Longhorns before starting his scandal-riddled professional career.

The winner was determined by a vote of all Division I head coaches, selected members of the media, all past winners of the Roger Clemens Award, and all past winners of the Rotary Smith Award. The award was discontinued following the 2008 college baseball season.

Since 2009, the National Pitcher of the Year Award, presented by the College Baseball Foundation, now honors the top NCAA Division I college baseball pitcher of the year.

<doc id="761844" wikidata="Q71139" url="?curid=761844" title="Prince Moritz of Anhalt-Dessau">
<text>Maurice of Anhalt-Dessau (31 October 1712 in Dessau - 11 April 1760 in Dessau), was a German prince of the House of Ascania from the Anhalt-Dessau branch. He was also a Prussian soldier and &quot;Generalfeldmarschall&quot;.

==Early life==
Maurice was the fifth son of Leopold I, Prince of Anhalt-Dessau, by his morganatic wife, Anna Louise Föhse.

==Military career==
Maurice entered the Prussian army in 1725, and saw his first service as a volunteer in the War of the Polish Succession (1734–35). In the later years of the reign of Frederick William I of Prussia, he held important commands. In the Silesian wars of Frederick the Great, Maurice, the ablest of old Leopold&#x27;s sons, greatly distinguished himself, especially at the Battle of Hohenfriedberg in 1745.

At Kesselsdorf it was the wing led by the young Maurice that carried the Austrian lines and won his father Leopold&#x27;s last campaign. In the years of peace preceding the Seven Years&#x27; War, Moritz was employed by Frederick the Great in the colonization of the wastelands of Pomerania and the Oder Valley. When the king took the field again in 1756, Maurice was in command of one of the columns which hemmed in the Saxon army in the lines of Pirna, and he received the surrender of Rutowski&#x27;s force after the failure of the Austrian attempts at relief.

During the next year Maurice suffered a change in his fortunes. At the Battle of Kolin he led the left wing, which, through a misunderstanding with the King, was prematurely drawn into action and failed hopelessly. In the disastrous days that followed, Maurice was subject to Frederick&#x27;s displeasure. But the glorious Victory of Leuthen on 5 December 1757, put an end to this. At the close of that day, Frederick rode down the lines and called out to General Prince Maurice, &quot;I congratulate you, Herr &quot;Feldmarschall&quot;!&quot; At Zorndorf he again distinguished himself, but at the surprise of Hochkirch he fell wounded into the hands of the Austrians. Maurice suffered blood poisoning from the wound and succumbed soon after his release from captivity.

<doc id="761846" wikidata="Q1607562" url="?curid=761846" title="Henschel Hs 127">
<text>The Henschel Hs 127 was a German bomber that was built as two prototypes, but cancelled without entering mass production.

==Design and development==
In 1935, the RLM (&quot;Reichsluftfahrtministerium&quot; - German Ministry of Aviation) published requests for a fast tactical bomber. Junkers, Focke-Wulf, Messerschmitt and Henschel all submitted designs.

According to RLM specifications, the aircraft was to be able to maintain a speed of 500 km/h (313 mph) for 30 minutes, take-off to a height of 20 m (65 ft) in not more than 750 m (2,460 ft), and carry one defensive machine gun and 500–800 kg (1,100-1,760 lb) of bombs. The crew was to consist of a pilot, a bombardier/navigator and a gunner.

Focke-Wulf soon withdrew from participation, so three projects were presented: the future Hs 127, the Junkers Ju 88 and the Messerschmitt Bf 162. Prototypes were ordered of all three, with new Daimler-Benz DB 600 engines to be installed on all three types.

The maiden flight of the Hs 127 V1 was at the end of 1937. The aircraft was smaller and lighter than the Ju 88 and had a very good top speed of 565 km/h (353 mph), but the Ju 88 was chosen because of its bigger bomb load.

In May 1938, the contract for Hs 127 development was cancelled by the RLM and the third prototype was not finished.

The Hs 127 was a low-wing monoplane with monocoque fuselage. Its two-spar wing had an all-metal covering and was equipped with flaps. Its retractable gear had shock-absorbers to facilitate operations from poor airstrips. All three crew members sat in the nose.

<doc id="761848" wikidata="Q1391679" url="?curid=761848" title="Mahmoud El Nokrashy Pasha">
<text>Mahmoud Fahmy El Nokrashy Pasha (April 26, 1888 – December 28, 1948) (, ) was an Egyptian political figure. He was the twenty-seventh prime minister of the Kingdom of Egypt.

==Early life and education==
Nokrashy was born in Alexandria on 26 April 1888 to a middle-class family. His father was an Egyptian accountant, and his mother, Hanifa was of Turkish origin. Nokrashy was a graduate of the Ras Al Tin high school.

==Career==
Nokrashy Pasha was a member of the Saadist Institutional Party (SIP) which supported a liberal monarchist programme. He was also a member of the secret apparatus of the Wafd Party, Egypt&#x27;s then main nationalist party.

Nokrashy Pasha served as the prime minister of Egypt twice. His first term was from 1945 to 1946 (he initially came to power after the murder of Ahmad Mahir Pasha) and the second from 1946 to 1948. His second cabinet was a coalition government comprising members of the Saadist Institutional Party and the Liberal Constitutional Party. 

In 1948, Nokrashy Pasha became very concerned with the assertiveness and popularity of the Muslim Brotherhood. Rumours of a Brotherhood coup against the monarchy and government had appeared, and the Brotherhood had already been implicated in the killing of Nokrashy Pasha&#x27;s predecessor. Shortly after these rumours first gained currency, the prime minister formally outlawed the Brotherhood in December 1948, and this led directly to his own assassination. In addition to the Brotherhood being officially declared an illegal organization, the assets of the Brotherhood were seized by the government and many Brotherhood members went to prison.

==Assassination==
Less than three weeks after these activities against the Brotherhood, Nokrashy Pasha was gunned down by Abdel Meguid Ahmed Hassan, who was a veterinary student at the University of King Fouad I and another member of the Brotherhood. The slaying occurred on 28 December 1948 at 10:00 am. Nokrashy Pasha was killed in the main building of the Ministry of Interior by Hassan, who was wearing the uniform of a lieutenant. Hassan shot him twice. This crime in turn led to the assassination (by the political police) of Muslim Brotherhood leader Hasan Al Banna on 12 February 1949: despite the fact that Banna had condemned the murder of the prime minister, and had publicly called it a terrorist act incompatible with Islam.

Hassan was arrested after the murder, and confessed that he was a member of the Brotherhood. He reported that it was the prime minister&#x27;s decision to crack down upon the Brotherhood that had motivated him to carry out the shooting. Found guilty at his trial, he was soon afterwards hanged; three men who had knowingly helped him plan the assassination were sentenced to penal servitude for life.

<doc id="761852" wikidata="Q61692" url="?curid=761852" title="Leopold II, Prince of Anhalt-Dessau">
<text>Leopold II Maximilian, Prince of Anhalt-Dessau (25 December 1700 – 16 December 1751), was a German prince of the House of Ascania and ruler of the principality of Anhalt-Dessau from 1747 to 1751; he also was a Prussian general.

==Life==
Leopold was born at Dessau as the second son of Leopold I, Prince of Anhalt-Dessau, by his morganatic wife Anna Louise Föhse.

At only nine years of age, he accompanied his father on his military duties for the Prussian army. In 1715 he was appointed Lieutenant Colonel-in-Chief of the Infantry Regiment No. 27 of Stendal. In 1733 he led the Prussian forces stationed in the city of Mühlhausen in Thuringia during the First Silesian War.

The death in 1737 of his elder brother, the Hereditary Prince William Gustav, made Leopold the new heir of Dessau. The late prince was already married and had nine children, but his wife was of non-noble birth; for this reason, the issue of the marriage was barred from succession. After the death of his father in 1747, Leopold inherited Anhalt-Dessau.

Leopold was one of the best subordinate generals who served under Frederick the Great of Prussia. He distinguished himself in the capture of Glogau in 1741 and at the battles of Mollwitz, Chotusitz (where he was made &quot;Generalfeldmarschall&quot; on the field of battle), Hohenfriedberg, and Soor.

He died at Dessau in 1751. In 1752 Frederick the Great named a newly founded village Leopoldshagen (est. 1748) in his honour.

==Marriage and issue==
In Bernburg on 25 May 1737 Leopold married Gisela Agnes (b. Köthen, 21 September 1722 – d. Dessau, 20 April 1751), daughter of Leopold, Prince of Anhalt-Köthen. They had seven children:
#Leopold III Frederick Franz, Prince and (from 1807) Duke of Anhalt-Dessau (b. Dessau, 10 August 1740 – d. Luisium bei Dessau, 9 August 1817).
#Louise Agnes Margarete (b. Dessau, 15 August 1742 – d. Dessau, 11 July 1743).
#Henrietta Katharina Agnes (b. Dessau, 5 June 1744 – d. Dessau, 15 December 1799), married on 26 October 1779 to John Justus, Freiherr von Loën.
#Marie Leopoldine (b. Dessau, 18 November 1746 – d. Detmold, 15 April 1769), married on 4 August 1765 to Simon August, Count of Lippe-Detmold.
#John George (b. Dessau, 28 January 1748 – d. Vienna, 1 April 1811).
#Casimire (b. Dessau, 19 January 1749 – d. Detmold, 8 November 1778), married on 9 November 1769 to Simon August, Count of Lippe-Detmold, widow of her sister.
#Albert Frederick (b. Dessau, 22 April 1750 – d. Dessau, 31 October 1811), married on 25 October 1774 to Henriette of Lippe-Weissenfeld, great-granddaughter of Jobst Herman, Count of Lippe; the union was childless (Albert Frederick had an illegitimate son by one Anna Luise Franke: Gustav Adolf von Heideck).

<text>Jaime Nunó Roca (September 8, 1824 – July 18, 1908) was a Spanish composer from Catalonia who composed the music for the Mexican national anthem.

==Early life and education==
Nunó was born on September 8, 1824, in Sant Joan de les Abadesses, a town in the province of Girona, in Catalonia, Spain. Both his parents, Francisco Nunó and Magdalena Roca, died before his ninth birthday. After their death, Nunó was raised by his uncle Bernard, a seller of silks in Barcelona, who financed his musical studies in that city. There he demonstrated his skill as a soloist in the city cathedral, as well as a choir director and organist, for which he gained a scholarship to study with the composer Saverio Mercadante in Naples, Italy.

==Career==
Upon Nunó&#x27;s return to Barcelona, he was named director of the Queen&#x27;s Regimental Band in 1851 and travelled with them to Cuba where he met and befriended Antonio López de Santa Anna, the former Mexican president.

When Santa Anna returned to Mexico in 1853 to again resume the office of president, he invited Jaime Nunó to lead the Mexican military bands. His arrival coincided with the national call to compose the Mexican National Anthem. Nunó participated, composing music for the lyrics of Mexican poet Francisco González Bocanegra, and was declared the winner on August 12, 1854. The anthem made its debut at the Santa Anna Theater, on September 15, 1854, and was performed by soprano Claudina Florentini and Lorenzo Salvi, tenor and conducted by Master Vitessiri, with the orchestra of the Great Italian Opera Company. 

After the overthrow of President Santa Anna, Nunó emigrated to the U.S. and worked as a conductor and opera director, conducting the concerts of Sigismond Thalberg in New York City.

==Later life and death==

After a time in Spain, he returned to the U.S. and settled in Buffalo, New York, where he was found by a Mexican journalist in 1901. When this news reached Mexico, the current president, Porfirio Díaz, invited him to return; he did so and received various honors between 1901 and 1904. He died in New York on July 18, 1908. In 1942 the Mexican government ordered that his remains be exhumed and interred in the Rotonda de los Hombres Ilustres () in Mexico City, where they remain.

==Legacy==
In 2010, coinciding with the bicentennial of Mexico&#x27;s independence, the Catalan musicologists Cristian Canton and Raquel Tovar located the only descendant of Jaime Nunó, his great-grandson, living in the U.S. at Pelham, New York. The family granted access to the personal archive of Jaime Nunó, containing about 5,000 unpublished documents (personal letters, scores, official documents, etc.); all this information allowed Canton and Tovar writing the first complete biography of Nunó. This book had a high media coverage and has been described as &quot;an essential title to understand the musical history of Mexico&quot;. Also, in the context of the rediscovery of the figure of Jaume Nunó, his native town, Sant Joan de les Abadesses, opened a museum dedicated to the composer in his birth house, known as &quot;El Palmàs&quot;. Since the recovery of these documents, the unpublished music of Jaime Nunó has been played again, a complete edition of his works was published in 2012 and a recording of them was expected in 2014.

<text>Maude Nugent (January 12, 1873 or 1874 – June 3, 1958) was an American singer and composer.

==Biography==
Maude Nugent was born in Brooklyn, New York. She became a vaudeville singer, singing at venues like The Abbey and Tony Pastor&#x27;s.

In 1896, she composed and wrote the lyrics to &quot;Sweet Rosie O&#x27;Grady&quot;, which became one of the most popular waltz standards of the time. The song was initially rejected when she tried to sell it to Tin Pan Alley publisher Joseph W. Stern &amp; Co. Stern&#x27;s partner Edward Marks recounted that they changed their minds as soon as she left their office to market it elsewhere, and he chased her down the street to make an offer. The sheet music for the song sold over a million copies. In 1899, it was recorded by Lil Hawthorne for Berliner Gramophone. It was the main song in the 1943 Betty Grable film Sweet Rosie O&#x27;Grady.

Nugent continued to compose songs for a number of years, but none approached the success of &quot;Rosie O&#x27;Grady&quot;. Nugent performed her own songs, introducing many of them to audiences in this manner. Occasionally she collaborated with her husband, fellow-songwriter William Jerome.

Nugent retired from performing when she was 28 in order to raise a family; however, she continued to write music. In the 1940s and 1950s, &quot;Gay Nineties&quot; revues came into vogue and Nugent began to perform again on television, including The Ed Sullivan Show.

She died June 3, 1958, in New York.

The song &quot;Sweet Rosie O&#x27;Grady&quot; has a few lines in the musical &quot;Hello, Dolly!&quot;.

<doc id="761860" wikidata="Q5977740" url="?curid=761860" title="USS Abel P. Upshur">
<text>USS &quot;Abel P. Upshur&quot; (DD-193) was a in the service of the United States Navy and United States Coast Guard until transferred to the United Kingdom in 1940. During World War II, she served in the Royal Navy as HMS &quot;Clare&quot;.

==Construction and commissioning==
Named after Secretary of the Navy, Abel Parker Upshur, she was laid down on 20 August 1918 at Newport News, Virginia by the Newport News Shipbuilding &amp; Dry-dock Co. The ship was launched on 14 February 1920, sponsored by Mrs. George J. Benson, great-great niece of Secretary Upshur, and commissioned at the Norfolk Navy Yard on 23 November 1920.

==Service history==
===United States===
Following her commissioning, &quot;Abel P. Upshur&quot; was assigned to Destroyer Division 37, Squadron 3, Atlantic Fleet. She cruised along the United States East Coast, taking part in fleet exercises and maneuvers. The ship was placed out of commission at the Philadelphia Navy Yard on 7 August 1922.

&quot;Abel P. Upshur&quot; assumed duties at the Washington Navy Yard in March 1928 as a training ship for Naval Reserve personnel from the District of Columbia and continued this routine until 5 November 1930, when the ship was transferred to the U.S. Treasury Department. Her name was then struck from the Navy list. The ship served the Coast Guard attempting to prevent the smuggling of liquor into the United States.

&quot;Abel P. Upshur&quot; was returned to Navy custody on 21 May 1934 but was laid up at Philadelphia until 4 December 1939, when she was again placed in commission and assigned to the Atlantic Squadron. The ship operated along the U.S. East Coast on the Neutrality Patrol.

On 9 September 1940, &quot;Abel P. Upshur&quot; was decommissioned at Halifax, Nova Scotia. The vessel was transferred to Britain under an agreement by which, the United States exchanged 50 overage destroyers for bases on British colonial territory in the Atlantic. Her name was again struck from the Navy list on 8 January 1941.

==United Kingdom==

As HMS &quot;Clare&quot;, she was assigned to the 1st Flotilla and arrived at Belfast, Northern Ireland, on 26 September 1940. &quot;Clare&quot; joined Escort Group 7 and escorted transatlantic convoys. On 20 February 1941, she rescued the crew of the sinking British steamship &quot;Rigmor&quot;. In the early hours of 21 February, the destroyer collided with the motor vessel &quot;Petertoum&quot; and suffered some damage.

After undergoing repairs at Plymouth, England, between March and October, &quot;Clare&quot; resumed convoy duty with Escort Group 41, Western Approaches Command. &quot;Clare&quot; was modified for long range trade convoy escort service by removal of the two forward boilers and substitution of additional fuel tanks. This modification improved endurance but reduced top speed to 25 knots. Three of the original /50 caliber guns and one of the triple torpedo tube mounts were removed to reduce topside weight for additional depth charge stowage and installation of Hedgehog anti-submarine mortars.

In the fall of 1942, the destroyer took part in the landings of the invasion of North Africa Operation &quot;Torch.&quot; As a member of the Eastern Naval Task Force, she covered landings near Algiers. On 12 November 1942, the destroyer attacked a German U-boat in waters north of Oran, Algeria, and claimed to have sunk the enemy vessel. &quot;Clare&quot; left Gibraltar on 17 November 1942, returned to Britain, and resumed transatlantic convoy duty.

In July 1943, the ship participated in the invasion of Sicily. She entered drydock at Cardiff, Wales in September of that year, returned to action in May 1944, and served as a target ship for aircraft in the Western Approaches Command. In August 1945, &quot;Clare&quot; was reduced to reserve at Greenock, Scotland. Declared obsolete, she was allocated for scrap in 1947, arriving at Troon on 18 February 1947 to be broken up by West of Scotland Shipbreaking Co Ltd.

<doc id="761865" wikidata="Q207644" url="?curid=761865" title="Cuauhtémoc Blanco">
<text>Cuauhtémoc Blanco Bravo (; born 17 January 1973) is a Mexican politician and former professional footballer serving as a member of the Chamber of Deputies. He also served as the Governor of Morelos from 2018 to 2024 under the coalition &quot;Juntos Haremos Historia&quot;, and as the municipal president of Cuernavaca, Morelos. As a footballer, Blanco was known for his attacking ability and played most of his career as a deep-lying forward and his last years as an attacking midfielder. Blanco is considered to be one of the greatest Mexican footballers of all time.

== Early life ==
Blanco was born in Mexico City, in the district of Tlatilco, but grew up in Tepito. Born to Faustino Blanco and Hortensia Bravo, he was named after the last Aztec emperor Cuauhtémoc, in which the name means &quot;one who has descended like an eagle&quot;.

==Football career==
===Beginnings===
Blanco started his career with América in 1992, where he won various awards, both team-based and individual, and had various loan stints with Necaxa, Spanish club Real Valladolid, and Veracruz. In 2007, he joined the Chicago Fire, with a loan stint with Santos Laguna for the 2008 Apertura championship. In 2010, he returned to Mexico to trek throughout various teams, joining Veracruz again, Irapuato, Dorados, and Puebla-based teams Lobos BUAP and Puebla, where he retired with the latter in 2015. The following year, he came out of retirement to officially end his career with América.

=== Club career ===
==== Club América ====
Having played most of his career in América, with 333 appearances and 135 goals, Blanco has become an idol to the club&#x27;s supporters and an important figure in the history of the team.

Blanco made his debut in the Mexican Primera División in 1992 at the age of 19 with América. He won his first Golden Boot with 16 goals in the Winter 1998 season for &quot;Las Águilas&quot;. He was loaned for Winter 1997 and Summer 1998 at Necaxa, in which he scored 13 goals in 28 appearances. Blanco was later loaned to Real Valladolid of La Liga for the 2000–01 season. However, he suffered a broken leg while on international duty which kept him out of the side for six months. Blanco returned to Valladolid for another loan spell the following season, but he struggled with homesickness and regaining his form. He had a knack for scoring great goals in La Liga, with most notable, a free-kick against Real Madrid at the Santiago Bernabéu Stadium.

He returned to Mexico and spent the 2004 Apertura season with Veracruz, where they ended up winning their group, but were defeated in the playoffs by UNAM. Blanco was a popular player during his time there.
In May 2005, Blanco won his first club championship as a player, leading Club América to its tenth league title, when Club América defeated U.A.G. by an aggregate score of 7–4 (1–1, 6–3). In the next three consecutive years between 2005 and 2007, he was awarded the MVP.

He scored his final goal during the championship final against Pachuca in 2007.

==== Chicago Fire ====

On 2 April 2007, Blanco ventured on to Major League Soccer in the United States and signed with Chicago Fire. He was welcomed by 5,000 fans at Toyota Park as he conducted interviews with the media, signed autographs and greeted with fans.

He was later voted as a finalist for both the MVP and Newcomer of the Year awards in 2007. Blanco was the 2007 Goal of the Year winner, for his goal against Real Salt Lake.

Blanco was the second-highest paid player in Major League Soccer, after LA Galaxy midfielder David Beckham, earning $2.7 million a year. Once again, he was a finalist for the MVP of the year award.

On 24 July 2008, in the All-Stars Game against West Ham United, Blanco won the MVP award with one assist and one goal, a game in which he only played 46 minutes. The MLS All-stars won 3–2.

==== Santos Laguna (loan) ====
On 19 November 2008, it was announced that Santos Laguna signed Blanco on a loan to play only for the Apertura 2008 championship, after the injury of their Ecuadorian striker Christian Benítez. Blanco was formally presented to the press the next day, wearing the number 9 jersey, and stated that he looked forward to giving Santos a back-to-back championship. On 29 November 2008, Blanco scored his first goal with Santos, a penalty in the second leg of the championship quarter-finals against San Luis.

==== Later career ====

In October 2009, Blanco announced he would not be renewing his contract with Chicago Fire and would instead sign with Veracruz of the Ascenso MX beginning in January 2010. However, after 6 months with Veracruz he left for Irapuato. Led by Blanco, Irapuato won the 2011 Clausura, but the team failed to advance to the Primera División, losing to Tijuana in the promotional final.
In December 2011, Blanco joined Dorados de Sinaloa of Liga de Ascenso. During Apertura 2012, Blanco won the Copa MX with Dorados. Despite Blanco announcing he would retire after the end of 2012, he changed his mind and played for another six months with Dorados. However, after the tournament ended, he did not renew his contract and was released from the team in June 2013.

Blanco signed for Lobos BUAP for the Apertura 2013 Liga de Ascenso season. After one year with the club, he did not renew his contract with BUAP and was released from the club at the end of the season, in which the club failed to qualify for the play-offs.

After considering retirement, Blanco signed with Puebla for one last season in the Liga MX. On 21 April 2015, he played in the Clausura&#x27;s Copa MX final against Guadalajara, coming off the bench. Puebla went on to win the cup, and sent Blanco off as a champion in what was supposed to be the final game of his career.

On 22 February 2016, a month into his political career, it was announced that Blanco would participate in an official Liga MX match during the Week 9 of Clausura 2016 for the club that started his career, Club América. It would allow him to officially end his career, while playing for the club. On 5 March, Blanco started the match wearing a number 100 jersey, and played 36 minutes for América at the Estadio Azteca in a match against Morelia, before being replaced by Darwin Quintero. During the match, Blanco demonstrated his signature move, the &quot;Cuauhtemiña&quot;, and had two shots on goal, one of which hit the crossbar from the outside of the penalty box. The match was eventually won by América 4–1.

=== International career ===
Blanco represented Mexico from 1995 to 2010 (with a special appearance in 2014). He was capped 120 times and scored 38 goals. Blanco is the only Mexican to have won Confederations Cup awards, being awarded the Silver Ball and Silver Boot at the 1999 Confederations Cup after a first-place finish on home soil, until Oswaldo Sánchez&#x27;s Golden Glove award in 2005. In 2010, he became the first Mexican to score at three World Cup tournaments, a feat later equalled by Rafael Márquez and Javier Hernández, appearing in the 1998, 2002, and 2010 editions of the tournament.
Blanco made his debut with the senior national team under Bora Milutinovic in a friendly match against Uruguay on 1 February 1995. Blanco has played for Mexico at three World Cups; he was part of the squad at France 1998, Korea-Japan 2002 and South Africa 2010. He was also a member of the team that won the Confederations Cup in 1999 where he was the tournament&#x27;s leading scorer with six goals, including the winning goal at the Estadio Azteca against Brazil in the final. He was awarded the &quot;Silver Shoe&quot; and &quot;Silver Ball&quot; for outstanding player of the tournament. Blanco holds the record along with Brazilian Ronaldinho as the highest scoring players in the Confederations Cup with nine goals, three in 1997 and six in 1999.

In the selection for the final 23-man squad for the 2006 FIFA World Cup in Germany, then national team coach Ricardo La Volpe left Blanco out of the team. While the ostensible reason given was that Blanco was frequently injured and not in good form, some people considered this to be a consequence of the previous year&#x27;s constant bickering, due to on-going personal problems between coach and player.

Blanco became part of the squad that played the 2007 CONCACAF Gold Cup, scoring one penalty goal, and the 2007 Copa América, where he scored 2 goals also from penalty kicks. On 13 September 2008, he earned his 100th cap for his country in its 2–1 World Cup qualifier victory over Canada at Tuxtla Gutiérrez, coming on with only 15 seconds left in regulation time. After the match, he announced his retirement from international football.

With the return of Javier Aguirre as coach, Blanco returned to the national team in May 2009. He played in all the games throughout the Hexagonal of the World Cup Qualifying. Since then, Blanco has become an important factor in Mexico&#x27;s team regaining form and confidence.

On 10 October 2009, Blanco provoked the first opposition own goal and scored the second goal in a 4–1 victory over El Salvador to help Mexico clinch a spot in the 2010 World Cup. On 17 June 2010, he scored a penalty in the 78th minute of the 2–0 win against France at the World Cup&#x27;s second round of group stage matches in South Africa. With this goal he became the first Mexican to score a goal in three World Cup tournaments and the third-oldest goalscorer in World Cup history.

Blanco played a tribute game in 2014 against Israel at the Estadio Azteca, which symbolized his official retirement from international football. Mexico went on to win the match 3–0.

=== Player profile ===
==== Style of play ====

Blanco is considered to be one of the greatest Mexican footballers of all time, as well as one of the best penalty takers of all time, having scored 71 out of 73 penalties in his career, giving him a 97.26% success rate from the spot.

His brash, aggressive, and confrontative playing style is reflected both on and off the field, pulling ingenious plays and being combative against the press, players, and coaches alike.

==== &quot;Cuauhtemiña&quot; ====
Blanco is also remembered for the &quot;Cuauhtemiña&quot;, or Blanco Trick, which he performed notably at the 1998 World Cup. In the trick, when two or more opposition players are trying to take the ball from him, he traps the ball between his feet and jumps through the defenders – releasing the ball in the air and landing with it under control as he leaves the opposition players behind. The trick is easy to perform but is eye-catching and has been incorporated as a special skill into the FIFA series of football video games.

==== Celebration ====
Blanco himself has accepted on Mexican television and to the press that his goal celebration is an imitation of the &quot;Archer&quot; celebration created by former Atletico de Madrid striker Kiko Narvaez. In a 2005 interview with Mexican newspaper &quot;El Universal&quot;, Blanco explains that while watching a Spanish league game accompanied by his teammate Germán Villa, both players agreed to celebrate their next goal by imitating the &quot;Archer&quot; gesture. In the end, only Blanco did it, and jokingly reprimanded Villa for not keeping his word. However, the Chicago Fire official website claimed that Blanco celebrates scoring a goal by acting like the Prehispanic Tlatoani Aztec emperor Cuauhtémoc, &quot;in order to show respect for the Mexican people, and their indigenous Amerindian heritage&quot;.

====Reception====
Blanco is considered one of the most influential figures in recent Mexican footballing history. Tom Marshall of &quot;ESPN&quot; states &quot;the battles, brawls, &quot;golazos&quot;, insults, intensity and passion with which Blanco [...] lived both on and off the pitch, he left a deep imprint on the Mexican game and a colorful story painted by the kind of character arguably lacking at present.&quot;

==Political career==
===Municipal president of Cuernavaca (2015–2018)===
In January 2015, Blanco registered as a Social Democratic Party candidate for the municipal presidential elections of the city of Cuernavaca, the capital of the Mexican state of Morelos, and was formally nominated two months later. In the 2015 legislative elections, he won in a closely contested election, narrowly defeating Maricela Velázquez of the incumbent Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI). In a subsequent vote recount Blanco was confirmed the winner of the municipal presidential race.

As municipal president, Blanco struggled with accusations about his residency in the city, allegations that he had accepted a bribe to run for office, and even murder. None of these allegations ever went anywhere. In June 2016, he left the Social Democratic Party and dismissed the secretary of the city council, Roberto Yañez Moreno, which marked the beginning of a dispute between Blanco and the party.

In March 2017, he joined the Social Encounter Party (PES).

===Governor of Morelos (2018–2024)===

For the 2018 general elections, the National Regeneration Movement proposed having Senator Rabindranath Salazar Solorio as the candidate under the coalition &quot;Juntos Haremos Historia&quot; for the Governor of Morelos but PES, also part of the coalition, argued Blanco was the better choice for the coalition&#x27;s candidate. In December 2015, it was determined there would be an internal election to see who would become the candidate for the coalition.

On 28 January 2018, &quot;Juntos Haremos Historia&quot; presidential candidate Andrés Manuel López Obrador announced Blanco would be the coalition&#x27;s candidate after winning the nominee process against Senator Rabindranath Salazar Solorio. On 11 March 2018 he formally registered to become candidate for Governor of Morelos and on 2 April 2018, he was separated from his post as municipal president of Cuernavaca, succeeded by Denisse Arizmendi Villegas, in order to formally participate in the gubernatorial elections. Polls indicated he was in the lead.

On 1 July 2018, he won the 2018 gubernatorial elections by a landslide, becoming the first former footballer to win a state governor election in Mexico. He began his term as Governor on 1 October 2018. His greatest challenges as governor are finding adequate funding for the state university (UAEM) and resolving the high incidence of crime in the state. Only three months into his term, he was already faced with marches denouncing his administration. On 13 February 2019 Blanco formally charged his predecessor, Graco Ramirez, with organized crime, operations with resources of illicit origin, and tax fraud.

One year into his governorship, people began to doubt Blanco&#x27;s administration. Politically, he disputed with Morena and PT, partners in &quot;Juntos Haremos Historia&quot; that got him elected. He promoted PES, which has been dissolved on a national level but remains strong locally. Crime rose significantly, with a 680% increase in cases of extortion, 375% increase in kidnappings, and 41% increase in murders. More than eighty women were killed in 2019, 22 of which were classified distinctly as femicide. Additionally, a tax debt of MXN$302,230 (US$15,800) from his time as a footballer was pardoned by the federal Tax Administration Service, raising questions of corruption. Roberto Soto Pastor, a former collaborator of Graco Ramirezs, sued Blanco for hiring several members of his family and friends, including: his half-brother Ulises Bravo, sister-in-law Liu León Luna, uncles Carlos Juárez López, Jaime Juárez López, and Armando Shajid Bravo López, and a close friend named Baltazar Jonathan Alegría Mejía. All receive salaries that range from MXN $45,000 to $60,000 (US$2,300 to $3,100) per month. The suit says their hiring is a violation of &quot;Código Penal de Morelos, Artículo 276&quot; (Morelos penal code, Article 276) which prohibits nepotism. President Andrés Manuel López Obrador personally called Blanco out for nepotism in a meeting on 11 October. The governor denies allegations of nepotism.

On 8 January 2020, Arias Consultores released a poll that describes the best and worst governors. Sinaloa governor Quirino Ordaz Coppel is chosen best, while Puebla governor L. Miguel Barbosa Huerta was declared the worst. Cuauhtemoc Blanco was second-to-last at No. 31.

== Personal life ==
He was previously married to Marisela Santoyo from 1996 to 2003, with whom he has a son, Cuauhtémoc Jr., born the same year of their wedding. After their separation in 2000, Blanco had an affair with Liliana Lago, which produced a daughter, Bárbara, born in 2002. In 2015, Blanco married Natalia Rezende. The couple have a son named Roberto, born in 2016.
He appeared on the North American front cover of the &quot;FIFA 10&quot; video game along with Frank Lampard and Sacha Kljestan.

In October 2024, Blanco was accused of attempting to rape his half-sister.

<text>Nu (; ; 25 May 1907 – 14 February 1995), commonly known as [[Burmese names#Honorifics|U]] Nu and also by the honorific name Thakin Nu, was a prominent Burmese statesman and the first Prime Minister of Union of Burma. He was educated at Rangoon University, where he developed his political ideas and became actively involved in the student movement. Nu&#x27;s involvement in the nationalist movement deepened during his university years, and he quickly emerged as a leading figure advocating for Burma&#x27;s independence from British colonial rule.

He played a crucial role in the Anti-Fascist People&#x27;s Freedom League (AFPFL), the primary political organization leading the fight for independence. Following Burma&#x27;s independence in 1948, Nu became the country&#x27;s first Prime Minister under the provisions of the 1947 Constitution of the Union of Burma. His tenure was marked by efforts to rebuild the war-torn nation, establish democratic governance, and navigate the complexities of ethnic and political divisions within Burma. Nu&#x27;s administration faced numerous challenges, including economic difficulties, internal insurgencies, and the task of unifying a diverse population.

During his time in office, Nu implemented several significant reforms, including land redistribution policies and initiatives to promote education and healthcare. He also pursued a policy of neutrality in foreign affairs, aligning Burma with neither the Western bloc nor the Soviet Union during the Cold War. However, his government struggled with internal dissent and regional insurgencies, leading to political instability.

Nu&#x27;s first term as Prime Minister ended in 1958, but he briefly returned to power in 1960. However, his second tenure was cut short by a military coup in 1962, led by General Ne Win. Following the coup, Nu was placed under house arrest and later allowed to go into exile. He continued to be an influential political figure and an advocate for democracy until his death on 14 February 1995. Nu&#x27;s legacy is remembered for his dedication to Burma&#x27;s independence, his efforts to establish democratic governance, and his complex role in the nation&#x27;s turbulent political history.

==Biography==
Nu was born to U San Tun and Daw Saw Khin of Wakema, Myaungmya District, British Burma. He attended Myoma High School in Yangon, and received a B.A. from Rangoon University in 1929. In 1935 he married Mya Yi while studying for a Bachelor of Laws.

==Political career==

===Struggle for independence===
Nu&#x27;s political life started as president of the Rangoon University Students Union (RUSU) with M. A. Rashid as vice-president and U Thi Han as the general secretary. Aung San was editor and publicity officer. Nu and Aung San were both expelled from the university after an article,&quot;Hell Hound at Large&quot;appeared in the union magazine, which was obviously about the rector.Their expulsion sparked off the second university students&#x27; strike in February 1936. Aung San and Nu became members of the nationalist Dobama Asiayone (Our Burma Association) which had been formed in 1930 and henceforth gained the prefix Thakin (&#x27;Master&#x27;), proclaiming they were the true masters of their own land. For a few years after independence in 1948 Nu retained the prefix &#x27;Thakin&#x27;, but around 1952 he announced that since Burma was already independent the prefix of &#x27;Thakin&#x27; was no longer needed and henceforth he would be known as U (&#x27;Mr&#x27;) Nu. In 1937 he co-founded with Thakin Than Tun the Nagani (Red Dragon) Book Club which for the first time widely circulated Burmese-language translations of the Marxist classics. He also became a leader and co-founder of the People&#x27;s Revolutionary Party (PRP), which later became the Socialist Party, and the umbrella organisation the Anti-Fascist People&#x27;s Freedom League (AFPFL), which advocated Burmese independence from both Japanese and British control during the 1940s. He was detained by the colonial government in 1940 along with Thakin Soe, Thakin Than Tun, Kyaw Nyein, U Măd, and Ba Maw. The prison holding Nu was largely abandoned by the British in the course of the rapid Japanese advance.

From August 1943, when the Japanese declared nominal independence for Burma under a regime led by Ba Maw, Nu was appointed foreign minister. In 1944 he was appointed minister of information until the open rebellion by the AFPFL against the Japanese military in March 1945. Though aware of the resistance and in contact with its leaders, Nu did not actively participate in the underground activities of the AFPFL up to the rebellion, and unlike its leading figure Aung San, did not join the rebellion and move to areas under Allied control. Instead, Nu retreated with the Japanese and Ba Maw in late April, 1945. Nu was nearly killed on August 12, 1945, when Allied pilots strafed and destroyed the house Ba Maw had been given by the retreating Japanese, but both escaped the residence during the attack. Following Japanese surrender, Nu retired from politics for a time, writing his memoirs of the war years, &quot;Burma Under the Japanese&quot; and tracts on Marxism. As a popular figure with early connections to Aung San and other nationalists from their student days, however, Nu was drawn back into the politics of the AFPFL where he initially struggled to keep its Communist contingent within the party.

After the assassination of its political and military leader Aung San along with his cabinet ministers on 19 July 1947, U Nu led the AFPFL and signed an independence agreement (the Nu-Attlee Treaty) with the British Premier Clement Attlee in October 1947.

===Parliamentary era===

Burma gained independence from Britain on 4 January 1948. U Nu became the chairman of the Old Myoma Students Association in Yangon. He became the first Prime Minister of independent Burma, and he had to deal with armed rebellion. The rebels included various ethnic groups, White Flag and Red Flag communist factions, and some regiments in the Army. Yet another challenge was the exiled Kuomintang (KMT). After being chased out of (Mainland) China by the victorious Communists, they had established bases in eastern Burma, and it took several years in the early 1950s to drive them out. A democratic system was instituted and parliamentary elections were held several times. Throughout the 1950s, U Nu oversaw the implementation of the Pyidawtha Plan, a national economic development plan to establish an industrial welfare state in Burma.

He voluntarily relinquished the Prime Ministerial position in 1956. He was one of the leaders of the Anti-Fascist People&#x27;s Freedom League (AFPFL) from 1942 to 1963. AFPFL member Ba Swe served as Prime Minister from June 1956 to June 1957. In 1955, the University of Belgrade (Yugoslavia) awarded him an honorary doctorate.

On 26 September 1958, he asked the Army Chief of Staff General Ne Win to take over as a &quot;caretaker government&quot;, and Ne Win was sworn in as Prime Minister on 27 October 1958. In the February 1960 general election, U Nu&#x27;s Clean faction of the AFPFL won in a landslide victory over the Stable faction led by U Ba Swe and Kyaw Nyein. U Nu returned to power forming the Pyidaungzu (Union) government on 4 April 1960. The Clean AFPFL was subsequently renamed the Union Party.

U Thant had been Secretary to the Prime Minister U Nu before he was appointed Burmese Ambassador to the United Nations in 1957. U Thant became the third UN Secretary-General in 1961. U Nu participated in the 1st Summit of the Non-Aligned Movement in 1961 in Belgrade making Burma one of the founding members of the Non-Aligned Movement.

In 1961, U Nu made briefly made Buddhism the state religion and caused dissent amongst Christian Kachin nationalists and was one of the main factors for the Kachin conflict.

===Military era===

Less than two years after his election victory, U Nu was overthrown by a coup d&#x27;état led by General Ne Win on 2 March 1962. After the 1962 coup, U Nu was put in what was euphemistically called &#x27;protective custody&#x27; in an army camp outside Rangoon. He was released more than four years later on 27 October 1966. Among others, on the day of the military coup on 2 March 1962 President Mahn Win Maung as well as Chief Justice U Myint Thein (22 February 1900 – 3 October 1994) was also put in &#x27;protective custody&#x27;. Win Maung was released from detention in October 1967 and Myint Thein not until 28 February 1968.

On 2 December 1968, Ne Win appointed U Nu to the 33-man Internal Unity Advisory Board to advise on suggestions for internal unity and political change. In February 1969, U Nu submitted a report recommending that power be handed back to him and that the Parliament abolished by Ne Win in March 1962 be reconvened to appoint Ne Win as president to remove the &#x27;taint&#x27; of Ne Win&#x27;s government being &#x27;usurpers&#x27;. Soon after submitting his report, U Nu, feigning illness, and under the pretext of a pilgrimage to India left Burma for India. When Ne Win made no response to his report, U Nu left India for London.

In a London press conference on 27 August 1969, U Nu announced that he was the &#x27;legal Prime Minister&#x27; and pledged that he would not give up his struggle for democracy in Burma and that Burma was under the &#x27;same kind of fascism&#x27; that General Aung San had fought. In November 1969, Ne Win formally rejected U Nu&#x27;s proposal, saying that he took over power – and held on to it – not because he craved power but to uplift the welfare of the &#x27;workers and peasants&#x27; and that U Nu&#x27;s proposals amounted to &#x27;turning back the wheel&#x27;.

U Nu then used former Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) official Bill Young to help him raise international funding for founding the United National Liberation Front (UNLF). By the end of 1970, they had garnered more than $2 million.

U Nu later formed the Parliamentary Democracy Party (PDP) and led an armed resistance group. U Nu&#x27;s &#x27;resistance group&#x27; consisted of no more than several hundred or at most a few thousand at its peak and his avowal to fight and overthrow Ne Win from the Thai border met with abject failure. He subsequently accepted an offer of amnesty granted by Ne Win and returned to Burma on 29 July 1980.

===8888 Uprising===

After keeping a low profile, teaching Buddhism in Burma and the United States – U Nu visited Northern Illinois University in the US to lecture on Buddhism in 1987 – U Nu became once again politically active during the 8888 Uprising forming the first new political party, the League for Democracy and Peace (LDP). Echoing his assertion that he was the &#x27;legal Prime Minister&#x27; of August 1969 in London, U Nu reiterated on 9 September 1988 in Rangoon that he was still the &#x27;legal Prime Minister&#x27;.

U Nu initiated to form an interim government and invited opposition leaders to join him. Indian Prime minister Rajiv Gandhi had already signaled his readiness to recognize the interim government and Burmese troops started to change sides with Burmese Navy almost totally siding with the opposition. However, Aung San Suu Kyi categorically rejected U Nu&#x27;s plan by saying &quot;the future of the opposition would be decided by masses of the people&quot;. Ex-Brigadier Aung Gyi, another opposition politician at the time of the 8888 crisis, followed and rejected the plan after Suu Kyi&#x27;s refusal. Crucial months were passed on the street and the interim government was not internationally recognized due to lack of support from opposition. Political analyst Susanne Prager-Nyein described Aung San Suu Kyi&#x27;s refusal as &quot;a major strategic mistake&quot;.

Nonetheless U Nu formed his own &#x27;government&#x27; reappointing Mahn Win Maung who was overthrown in the 1962 coup as &#x27;President&#x27;. After the State Law and Order Restoration Council (SLORC) took over power on 18 September 1988, the SLORC repeatedly asked U Nu to formally &#x27;abolish&#x27; his &#x27;interim government&#x27;, but U Nu refused to do so. As a result, Nu was put under house arrest on 29 December 1989. SLORC spokesmen at that time stated that although U Nu could have been tried for &#x27;treason&#x27;, due to his advanced age and his contribution to the freedom struggle, he was not charged with that offence. He was released on 23 April 1992 the same day the SLORC Chairman Senior General Saw Maung was forced to relinquish power and replaced by military junta (officially named the State Peace and Development Council) chief Senior General Than Shwe.

==Religious works==

A devout Theravada Buddhist, U Nu had long been popular with the Buddhist majority of the country. In 1950, with the Karen Uprising, the Anti-Fascist People&#x27;s Freedom League controlled Parliament launched a Peace Within One Year campaign, involving various military actions and governmental reforms. Amongst this backdrop, U Nu combined orders for military equipment from India with a request to receive Buddhist relics on loan. U Nu toured the relics around the country, reaching into the stable parts of the countryside were ethnic unrest was still present, hoping to inspire peace through the power of the Buddha.

He had the Kaba Aye Pagoda and the Maha Pasana Guha (Great Cave) built in 1952 in preparation for the Sixth Buddhist Synod that he convened and hosted in 1954–1956 as prime minister. In a 1957 interview with American news broadcast &quot;See It Now&quot;, he stated that:

He also stated that although he was born Buddhist, he was particularly attracted by the Kalama Sutta, a Buddhist doctrine that challenges believers to actively question their beliefs and views instead of passively accepting them:

On 29 August 1961, Parliament passed the State Religion Promotion Act of 1961, initiated by U Nu himself. This act made Buddhism the official state religion of the country, one of his election campaign promises as well as instated the Buddhist lunar calendar by official observance of the so-called Buddhist sabbath days, or Uposatha, in lieu of the Christian Sabbath day, Sunday. On Uposatha days, state broadcasting radio was required to dedicate its airtime to religious programs, while state schools and government offices were closed, and liquor was not allowed to be served in public spaces. The act also required government schools to teach Buddhist students the Buddhist scriptures, banned the slaughtering of cattle (beef became known as &quot;todo tha&quot; (); lit. hush hush meat), and commuted death sentences for parolees.

Beyond stately actions, U Nu also took to fulfil the Buddhist ideal of the Chakravartin by engaging in personal merit-making and increasingly strong vows of celibacy to atone for the sins of the nation and to bring stability to his rule through religious devotion.

When General Ne Win took over in 1962, one of his first acts was to repeal the Buddhist acts that had passed under U Nu&#x27;s administration, including the ban on cow slaughtering and declaration of Buddhism as the state religion, as they had alienated largely Christian ethnic minorities such as the Kachins and the Karens, and perhaps was symbolic of a personality clash between Nu and Ne Win.

==Literary works==
U Nu authored several books some of which have been translated into English. Among his works are &quot;The People Win Through&quot; (1951), &quot;Burma under the Japanese&quot; (1954), &quot;An Asian Speaks&quot; (1955), and &quot;Burma Looks Ahead&quot; (1951). His autobiography (1907–1962) &quot;Ta-Tei Sanei Tha&quot; (&quot;Naughty Saturday-born&quot;) was published in India by Irrawaddy Publishing (U Maw Thiri) in 1975. An earlier version had been published in 1974; it was translated into English by U Law Yone, Editor of the (Rangoon) &quot;Nation&quot; till 1963 and who, like U Nu, was jailed by the Revolutionary Council in the 1960s. Before U Nu became Prime Minister, he had translated, in the late 1930s, Dale Carnegie&#x27;s book, &quot;How to Win Friends and Influence People&quot; (&quot;Lupaw Luzaw Louknee&quot; in Burmese – in retranslation, it roughly meant &#x27;How to Take Advantage of Man by Man&#x27;); later the translated name was changed to the more palatable &#x27;Meikta Bala Htika&#x27; which can be retranslated as &quot;A Treatise on Friendly Social Contract&quot;. The translated work under the second title became a prescribed text in schools in the 1950s as was U Nu&#x27;s original work in Burmese, &quot;The People Win Through&quot; or &quot;The Sound of the People Victorious&quot; (&quot;Ludu Aungthan&quot;).
He organized a Burma Translation Society and first volume of Burmese Encyclopedia published in 1954. The Sarpay Beikhman continued those works.

===Novelist and playwright===
Besides serving as Prime Minister, U Nu was also an accomplished novelist and playwright. In a work from the colonial period titled &quot;Yesset pabeikwe&quot; or &quot;It&#x27;s So Cruel&quot; (&quot;Man, the Wolf of Man&quot;) U Nu describes how during the colonial period rich landlords were able to get away with just about any crime they wished to perpetrate.

The play &quot;The Sound of the People Victorious&quot; (&quot;Ludu Aungthan&quot;) that U Nu wrote while he was Prime Minister is about the havoc that Communist ideologies can wreak in a family. Strangely enough the first production of the play seems to have been in Pasadena, California. It later became a popular comic book in Burma, was translated into English, and made into a feature film at the height of the Cold War in the 1950s. The older generation in Burma can still remember having studied the play in their schooldays.

In the play &quot;Thaka Ala&quot;, published just before the 1962 coup, U Nu paints an extremely ugly picture of corruption both amongst the high-ranking politicians in power at the time as well as among the communist leaders who were gaining ascendancy. This is a play in the vernacular, a genre that hardly exists in Burmese literature. A translation into English was published in instalments in the &quot;Guardian&quot; newspaper. The play was critical of the current state of politics in Burma at the time (around 1960) and in this critical stance it resembles Thein Pe Myint&#x27;s &quot;The Modern Monk&quot; (&quot;Tet Hpongyi&quot; in Burmese). Like &quot;The Modern Monk&quot;, it deals with scandalous sexual liaisons not much in keeping with traditional modes of Burmese behaviour.One of the greatest female writers of the Post-colonial period is Journalgyaw Ma Ma Lay. Khin Myo Chit was another important writer, who wrote, among her works, The 13-Carat Diamond (1955), which was translated into many languages. The journalist Ludu U Hla was the author of numerous volumes of ethnic minority folklore, novels about inmates in U Nu-era jails, and biographies of people working in different occupations. The Prime Minister U Nu himself wrote several politically oriented plays and novels.

==Death==
Nu died of natural causes on 14 February 1995 at his home in Yangon&#x27;s Bahan Township at the age of 87, after his wife Mya Yi (1910–1993) died. They had five children, San San (daughter), Thaung Htaik (son), Maung Aung (son), Than Than (daughter) and Cho Cho (daughter).

<text>Kurt Christoph, Graf von Schwerin (26 October 1684 – 6 May 1757) was a Prussian &quot;Generalfeldmarschall&quot;, one of the leading commanders under Frederick the Great.

==Biography==
He was born in Löwitz, Swedish Pomerania, and at an early age entered the Dutch army, with which he served at Schellenberg and at Blenheim.

In 1707 he became a lieutenant-colonel in the army of the duke of Mecklenburg-Schwerin, and was present at Ramillies and Malplaquet, and with the Swedish commander Stenbock at Gadebusch. In 1713 he was with Charles XII of Sweden in his captivity at Bender, and in 1718 was made major-general.

In 1719 he opposed the Hanoverian Army which invaded Mecklenburg (in the course of which he fought a brilliant action at &quot;Walsmühlen&quot; on 6 March 1719), and in the following year entered the service of the king of Prussia. At first he was employed in diplomatic missions, but in January 1722 – 1723 he received the command of an infantry regiment. In 1730, as a major-general, he was a member of the court martial which tried the crown prince Frederick for desertion, and in 1733, at the head of a Prussian army, conducted with great skill the delicate and difficult task of settling the Mecklenburg question.

In the following year he became lieutenant-general and in 1739 general of infantry. During the life-time of King Frederick William, Schwerin was also employed in much administrative work. Frederick the Great, on his accession, promoted Schwerin to the rank of general field marshal and made him a count. Early in the First Silesian War, he justified his sovereign&#x27;s choice by his brilliant leadership at the Battle of Mollwitz (10 April 1741), which, when he had persuaded the king to leave the battlefield explaining that he may be captured as a defeat was likely, converted a doubtful battle into a victory which decided for the time being the fate of Silesia.

After the conclusion of the war he was governor of the important fortresses of Brieg and Neisse. In the Second Silesian War (1744–1745), Schwerin commanded the army which, marching from Glatz, met the king&#x27;s army under the walls of Prague, and in the siege and capture of that place he played a distinguished part (10 September 1744).

Some time afterwards, the king being compelled to retreat from Bohemia, Schwerin again distinguished himself, but, resenting a real or fancied slight, retired to his estate, to which, and its inhabitants, he devoted his energies during the years of peace.

He reappeared on the field at the outbreak of the Third Silesian War (1756), and during the first campaign conducted the war on the Silesian side of Bohemia; and in 1757, following the same route as in 1744, again joined Frederick at Prague. On 6 May followed the Battle of Prague; leading on a regiment of the left wing to the attack with its colours in his hand, he shouted &quot;Let all brave Prussians follow me!&quot; after which he was struck and killed by a cannonball. Thomas Carlyle gives his cry as, &quot;Heran, meine Kinder&quot; (&quot;This way, boys!&quot;).

==Commemorations==
Frederick erected a statue on the &quot;Wilhelmplatz&quot; (today part of Wilhelmstraße) to his foremost soldier, and a monument on the field of Prague commemorates the place where he fell. Since 1889 the &quot;14th (3rd Pomeranians) Infantry&quot; of the German army had borne his name.

<text>Sylvestre Ntibantunganya (born 8 May 1956) is a Burundian politician. He was President of the National Assembly of Burundi from 23 December 1993 to 30 September 1994, and President of Burundi from 6 April 1994 to 25 July 1996 (interim to October 1994).

A Hutu, Ntibantunganya became involved in politics in the 1970s, eventually joining the Marxism-influenced Burundi Workers&#x27; Party (UBU) before leaving it to cofound the Front for Democracy in Burundi (FRODEBU) in 1986. After working as a journalist for Burundi National Radio and Television during the 1980s, Ntibantunganya was elected to Burundi&#x27;s National Assembly following FRODEBU&#x27;s victory in the country&#x27;s multiparty elections in June 1993 over the Union for National Progress (UPRONA), the Tutsi dominated-party that had ruled Burundi as a one-party state since 1966. He was named Minister of Foreign Affairs the following month under Burundi&#x27;s new president, party-mate Melchior Ndadaye.

Ndadaye&#x27;s assassination during a coup attempt in October after three months in power provoked the Burundian Civil War between Tutsis and Hutus. During this time, he was named President of the National Assembly two months later. The assassination of Ndadaye&#x27;s successor Cyprien Ntaryamira in April 1994 made Ntibantunganya the interim president in the midst of the civil war, becoming the permanent President in October of that year.

During the war, he was overthrown during a coup in 1996, and was replaced by former UPRONA president Pierre Buyoya. Following the end of the war in 2005, Ntibantunganya became a senator for life under the civil war&#x27;s peace accords until 2018. He also ran as an unsuccessful candidate in the 2015 Burundian presidential election.

==Early life==
Sylvestre Ntibantunganya was born on 8 May 1956 in the Commune of Gishubi, Gitega Province. He is an ethnic Hutu. As a child he intended on becoming a priest, and thus after finishing primary school he attended Mugera seminary. He left after his first semester and then attended university. He graduated in 1984 with a bachelor&#x27;s degree in history and geography and sought out a teaching position but could not obtain one. From April 1984 to December 1987 he worked as a journalist for Burundi National Radio and Television.

== Political career ==
=== Early activities and FRODEBU ===
In the 1970s Ntibantunganya was a member of the Movement of Progressive Barundi Students (Mouvement des Etudiants Progressistes Barundi). In August 1979 some of the student movement members founded the Burundi Workers&#x27; Party (&quot;Umugambwe wa&#x27;Bakozi Uburundi&quot;, UBU), a revolutionary socialist political party. To join the party, an applicant had to be sponsored by a member and was accepted on a probationary basis while they were educated in Marxism. Ntibantunganya was sponsored by one of the founding members and after three months became a full member of the party. By 1981 he sat on its central committee as its national secretary for external relations. UBU developed two factions, with the first advocating armed revolution and the second—led by Ntibantunganya and Melchior Ndadaye—advocating democracy and political freedom. As a result of these ideological divisions, the two men left UBU in 1983.

In 1988, President Pierre Buyoya decreed the creation of a 24-person commission to study ethnic divisions in Burundi and create a plan for national unity. Ntibantunganya served on the panel, which produced a Charter of National Unity, but it was denounced by Hutu members of the political opposition for being dominated by Tutsis and presenting an elitist point of view of the country. Ntibantunganya later called the project a failure. In May 1991 he founded &quot;Tujujurane&quot;, a Kirundi newspaper. He cofounded the Front pour la Démocratie au Burundi (FRODEBU) in 1986 and for a time edited its official newspaper, &quot;L&#x27;Aube de la Démocratie&quot; (), and in 1993 served on the party&#x27;s central committee.

=== Minister of Foreign Affairs and President of the National Assembly ===
In Burundi&#x27;s legislative elections held on 29 June 1993, Ntibantunganya was elected to a seat in the National Assembly representing Gitega. He became Minister of Foreign Affairs in Prime Minister Sylvie Kinigi&#x27;s government on 10 July.

Early in the morning on 21 October 1993 Tutsi soldiers in the Burundian Army launched a coup and attacked the presidential palace. The president&#x27;s wife called Ntibantunganya called to warn him about the putsch. Thus informed, he began calling FRODEBU leaders in an attempt to rally the government and warned Minister of Communications Jean‐Marie Ngendahayo. He also called the chargé d&#x27;affaires at the United States embassy and extracted his assurances that the United States government would condemn the coup. He then resolved to flee. Distrustful of his military guard, Ntibantunganya changed into his gardener&#x27;s clothes and walked to a friend&#x27;s home, where he remained in hiding for the next two days. His wife, Eusébie Nshimirimana, was murdered by soldiers while attempting to hide at a different home, though their infant child survived. He subsequently found refuge at the French embassy with Kinigi and other government officials. President Ndadaye was ultimately killed in the coup, as were the other officials in the presidential line of succession. Ntibantunganya later recalled the night of the coup as his saddest memory. Ndadaye&#x27;s death left him the interim leader of FRODEBU. He resigned as Minister of Foreign Affairs on 22 December 1993. The following day he was elected President of the National Assembly. 

FRODEBU also set about trying to name a new president. This stoked a rivalry between Ntibantunganya and another FRODEBU cofounder, Léonard Nyangoma. By his own account, Ntibantunganya decided to withdraw himself as a candidate despite having the support of the central committee, citing his desire to focus on party matters, and Ngendahayo suggested that FRODEBU back Cyprien Ntaryamira for the position instead. FRODEBU reached an agreement with the opposition, whereby Ntaryamira was sworn-in as President of Burundi on 5 February 1994 with a new government.

=== President of Burundi ===
On 6 April 1994 President Ntaryamira was traveling on a Rwandan plane with Rwandan President Juvénal Habyarimana. The aircraft was shot down by unknown assailants over Kigali, killing all aboard. The shootdown triggered the Rwandan genocide. Following the crash, Ntibantunganya made a broadcast on Burundi television, flanked by the minister of defence and the army chief of staff, appealing for calm. He attributed Ntaryamira&#x27;s death to &quot;the facts of circumstance&quot; and believed that he was not the target of the assassination. In accordance with the constitution Ntibantunganya, as President of the National Assembly, became the interim President of Burundi. Prime Minister Anatole Kanyenkiko and his government officially resigned but stayed in power pending the confirmation of a new executive. Ntibantunganya and Kanyenkiko enjoyed a good working relationship.
Faced with the spillover of the Rwandan Civil War, Ntibantunganya&#x27;s government pursued a strict policy of neutrality, denying officials of the former Habyarimana regime residency in Bujumbura and refusing to allow French troops to use Burundi as a staging area for Opération Turquoise. In May Ntibantunganya met with RPF leader Pasteur Bizimungu. The genocide created a refugee crisis; an estimated 300,000 Rwandans ultimately fled to Burundi, while approximately 180,000 Burundian exiles who had fled to Rwanda in October 1993 also returned. With international assistance, Ntibantunganya&#x27;s government opened new refugee camps to house them.

Over the course of 1994 the political and security situation in Burundi continued to deteriorate. Moderates in both UPRONA and FRODEBU were marginalised as radicals gained increasing influence and ethnic violence permeated the countryside. By the middle of the year Ntibantunganya was the only original member of the FRODEBU central committee still actively engaged with the party and the civil political process, with the others having been killed or having fled into exile. The party fractured into at least three groups, with the smallest section supporting Ntibantunganya, though many felt his cooperation with and concessions to the army and the opposition amounted to a capitulation. Another faction became a rebel group, the Conseil National Pour la Défense de la Démocratie – Forces pour la Défense de la Démocratie (CNDD–FDD). His tenure as President of the National Assembly ended on 30 September 1994. In early February 1995 Ntibantunganya dismissed two UPRONA ministers after they failed to show up to a cabinet meeting. Later that month, UPRONA extremists—displeased with the coalition government—forced out Prime Minister Kanyenkiko and replaced him with Antoine Nduwayo. Nduwayo actively undermined the president&#x27;s policies. In 1995 Ntibantunganya married his second wife, Pascasie Minani.

In the summer of 1995 the Burundian Army purchased heavy weapons from China. Fearful of the implications of their arrival, Ntibantunganya quietly persuaded the Tanzanian government to delay the shipment on its soil. Under pressure from UN and domestically, Ntibantunganya was forced to let the arms be delivered. At the behest of Tutsi extremists he also convinced the National Assembly to grant the army and gendarmerie emergency powers to restrict freedom of movement and speech.

With the civil war worsening and ethnic violence increasing, on 25 June 1996 Ntibantunganya participated in regional security talks in Mwanza, Tanzania. As a consequence of the meeting, the president and Nduwayo both agreed to appeal for &quot;international military assistance&quot;. The Burundian Army feared this would mean its usurpation by foreign intervention, and UPRONA immediately denounced the proposal. Nduwayo then accused Ntibantunganya of subverting the military, and joined the thousands of others in the capital in marching against an intervention. On 20 July 300 Tutsis at a displaced persons camp were massacred, presumably by Hutu rebels. When Ntibantunganya attempted to attend a funeral for them three days later the crowd of mourners attacked him with stones, forcing him to evacuate via helicopter. Ntibantunganya then obtained intelligence which suggested his life was threatened. He refused to resign but asked for refuge at the United States Ambassador&#x27;s residence, which was granted. On 25 July he went to the residence, while Nduwayo announced his government&#x27;s resignation. Major Pierre Buyoya subsequently took power in a military coup. He announced the suspension of the constitution, the dissolution of the National Assembly, and the banning of political parties, but declared that he would guarantee Ntibantunganya&#x27;s safety. Ntibantunganya later entered negotiations with Buyoya, who agreed to provide him with a home in the Bujumbura suburb of Kiriri. He left the United States Embassy on 8 June 1997, saying, &quot;I reaffirm that I shall not yield on the principle for a search for a negotiated solution for all problems that face our country.&quot;

== Later life ==
Ntibantunganya served as a senator for life as a former head of state from the implementation of the Arusha Accords until August 2018. On 14 June 2007 his membership in FRODEBU was suspended. He was a candidate in the 2015 Burundian presidential election. In July he and several other opposition candidates dropped out of the race, citing concerns for their safety and fear that incumbent President Pierre Nkurunziza would rig the outcome in his favor. The following year he spent several months in exile in Belgium. In 2020 he led the East African Community&#x27;s election monitoring team for Tanzania&#x27;s general elections.

In 1999 Ntibantunganya released his first book, &quot;Démocratie (une) pour tous les Burundais&quot;, published by L&#x27;Harmattan. He spent 14 years writing another book, &quot;Burundi, Démocratie piégée&quot;, which he published in 2019. During the celebration of International book day on 23 April 2021 he lamented that Burundians &quot;do not read&quot; and called for the national promotion of literature.

<doc id="761873" wikidata="Q4756828" url="?curid=761873" title="Andy Douglas (judge)">
<text>Andrew Grant Douglas (July 5, 1932 – September 23, 2021) was an American Republican justice of the Ohio Supreme Court who served in that office from 1985 to 2002.

==Early life==
Douglas was born in July 1932 in Toledo, Ohio to Andrew and Elizabeth Douglas. Between 1954 and 1956, he served in the U.S. Army Infantry and Signal Corps and obtained the rank of first lieutenant. He attended the University of Toledo, where in 1959 he earned a degree in law.

==Legal career==
In 1960, Douglas co-founded the law firm Winchester &amp; Douglas. He practiced law in Toledo and Lucas County for 20 years. He also served as special counsel to the Attorney General of Ohio. The following year, he was one of the youngest members elected to Toledo City Council. He was re-elected nine times, and served until 1980.

In 1980, Douglas was elected to the 6th District Court of Appeals. By appointment of the chief justice of the Supreme Court of Ohio, he sat as a trial judge for the common pleas courts in various counties during 1982 and 1983. From 1980 to 1984, he was an instructor at the University of Toledo Community and Technical College. In 1984, Douglas defeated the Cuyahoga Court of Common Pleas Judge John Corrigan for Justice of the Supreme Court. He was re-elected in 1990 and 1996. During that time, he also taught at Ohio Dominican College from 1992 to 1995.

During the 1990s, Justice Douglas and Justices Alice Robie Resnick, Francis E. Sweeney and Paul E. Pfeifer forged a majority. Their decisions expanded workers’ compensation rights, increased liabilities for insurance companies and declared the Ohio system of funding public schools unconstitutional.

In an interview with The Plain Dealer in December 2002, Douglas said his most meaningful case during his Supreme Court career was in 1987 with Dayton Power &amp; Light Company v. Ohio Civil Rights Commission. A group of Dayton Power &amp; Light employees were engaged in “horseplay” on Sept. 12, 1982 and damaged company property. Of the employees involved, Samuel Prather was the only African-American and the only employee fired on Sept. 13, 1982. The Supreme Court ruled that the power company unlawfully discharged Prather. Douglas remarked, “Every case that comes here is important, but if I had to choose an example of moral persuasion of the court and the ability to do the right thing, that&#x27;s it.”

Douglas explained his judicial philosophy in a 1997 commencement address to Cleveland State University Cleveland-Marshall College of Law students:

“But a simple rule can help you meet and exceed those expectations. As you traverse the rocky terrain of the modern practice of law, always keep this principle in mind... Endeavor to give your clients advice which will advance their interests while also furthering the interests of justice. I can think of no greater comfort than laying down your head on your pillow each night knowing, on that day you helped somebody. We, in our profession, can do that each and every day.”

Douglas could not run for a fourth term, as he reached the mandatory retirement age of 70 in 2002. He retired on December 31, 2002 and joined the Columbus law firm of Crabbe, Brown &amp; James as a partner. He also served as executive director of the Ohio Civil Service Employees Association (OCSEA). Most recently, Douglas served of counsel with the Columbus law firm of Mazanec, Raskin &amp; Ryder Co., LPA.

Douglas married Joan Bowman, who died at the age of 33 in 1966. They have four children: Cindy, Robert, Andy, and David. Douglas died on September 23, 2021, at the age of 89.

<doc id="761876" wikidata="Q544632" url="?curid=761876" title="John Humphrey Noyes">
<text>John Humphrey Noyes (September 3, 1811 – April 13, 1886) was an American preacher, radical religious philosopher, and utopian socialist. He founded the Putney, Oneida and Wallingford Communities, and is credited with coining the term &quot;complex marriage&quot;.

==Biography==

===Early years===
Noyes was born September 3, 1811, in Brattleboro, Vermont to John Noyes, who worked variously as a minister, teacher, businessman, and member of the U.S. House of Representatives, and Polly Noyes (née Hayes), aunt to Rutherford B. Hayes, 19th President of the United States.

In 1831, when he was 20, Noyes was influenced by the preaching of Charles Grandison Finney, a leader in the Second Great Awakening. Noyes underwent a religious conversion. &quot;My heart was fixed on the millennium, and I resolved to live or die for it,&quot; Noyes later recalled. He graduated from Dartmouth College shortly thereafter and dropped plans to study law, instead enrolling at Andover Theological Seminary with a view to entering the Christian ministry.

In the fall of 1832, Noyes left Andover to enter the Yale Theological Seminary so that he could devote more time to Bible study. In addition to attending daily lectures, practicing his preaching technique, and engaging in Biblical study, Noyes began to dip his toe into political activism, helping to organize in New Haven one of the first Anti-Slavery Societies in the United States.

While in his second year at Yale, Noyes made what he considered a major theological discovery. While attempting to determine the date of the second coming of Christ, Noyes became convinced that the event had already occurred. His conclusion was that Christ&#x27;s second coming had taken place in 70 AD and that therefore &quot;mankind was now living in a new age.&quot;

With this in mind Noyes became increasingly concerned with salvation from sin and with perfection. He began to argue with his colleagues that unless man was truly free of sin, then Christianity was a lie, and that only those who were perfect and free of sin were true Christians. This internal religious crisis brought about a new religious conversion within Noyes, after which he began to proclaim that he &quot;did not sin.&quot;

In 1838 Noyes was married to Harriet Holton. Initially, the couple had a traditional Christian marriage. In the first six years of the marriage Harriet gave birth five times. Four of the five births were premature. Only one of their children survived. These life experiences led Noyes to begin his study of sexual intercourse in marriage. In May 1846, Noyes had a romantic attraction to the wife of early convert George Cragin. He persuaded the Cragins and Mrs. Noyes to merge their unions into a &quot;complex marriage,&quot; in which both men were married to both women, such that they could have sex together. The two couples moved into a common house that same year. Noyes spent the next few years developing his ideas on male continence. In mid-1847 Noyes and some of his male converts began extending the scope of complex marriage to female converts, including several village widows and young women. This led to the October, 1847 indictment of Noyes for &quot;adulterous fornication.&quot; After arraignment in court, Noyes absconded to New York, where in 1848 the Oneida Community was born.

===Perfectionist leader===
Charles Grandison Finney, who had influenced Noyes&#x27; conversion, advocated the idea of Christian perfectionism, that it was possible to be free of sin in this lifetime, which Noyes took up with fervor. His statements on this doctrine caused his friends to think him unbalanced, and he began to be called a heretic by his own professors. From the moment of his conversion, Noyes maintained that because he had surrendered his will to God, everything he chose to do was perfect because his choices &quot;came from a perfect heart&quot;. His theory centered on the idea that the fact that man had an independent will was because of God and that this independent will came from God, therefore rendering it divine. The only way to control mankind&#x27;s will was with spiritual direction.
Noyes proclaimed that &quot;it was impossible for the Church to compel man to obey the law of God, and to send him to eternal damnation for his failure to do so.&quot;

Noyes claimed that &quot;his new relationship to God canceled out his obligation to obey traditional moral standards or the normal laws of society.&quot; As a result, Noyes started acting on impulses from his intuition rather than giving thought to the actions or consequences. On February 20, 1834, he declared himself perfect and free from sin. This declaration caused an outrage at his college, and his newly earned license to preach was revoked.

Upon his expulsion from Yale and the revocation of his ministerial license, he returned to Putney, Vermont, where he continued to preach, declaring, &quot;I took away their license to sin and they go on sinning; they have taken away my license to preach but I shall go on preaching.&quot; The Putney community began to take shape. It started in 1836 as the &quot;Putney Bible School&quot; and became a formal communal organization in 1844, practicing complex marriage, male continence, and striving for perfection.

Residents at Putney included Almira Edson, who was expelled from the community upon her marriage, which was not sanctioned by Noyes.

===Oneida Community===
On October 26, 1847, Noyes was arrested for adultery, but was &quot;released until his trial before the County Court in April next,&quot; according to Harriet H. Skinner&#x27;s October 29, 1847 letter to her mother. Upon receiving word that arrest warrants had been issued for several of his loyal followers, the group left Vermont for Oneida, New York, where Noyes knew some friendly Perfectionists with land. They settled there, and built their first communal dwelling in 1848, followed by the Mansion House. 
The &quot;Oneida Community&quot;, as it came to be known, existed until 1881. It grew to have a membership of over 300, with branch communities in Brooklyn, New York; Wallingford, Connecticut; and Newark, New Jersey. The Community supported itself through many successful industries. They manufactured animal traps and silk thread, and grew and canned fruits and vegetables. Smaller industries included the manufacture of leather travel bags and palm-leaf hats. Their most successful trade, however, was that of silverware.

==== Male continence and complex marriage ====
The Oneida community&#x27;s utopian philosophy focused on the individual relationship to God; it was intended to be a sort of &quot;kingdom of God on earth.&quot; The second focus of the community was sexual morality. Noyes found masturbation and the practice of man to sow seeds that he did not wish to grow to be unnatural. Noyes identified three functions of the sexual organs: the urinary, the propagative and the amative. Noyes believed in the separation of the amative from the propagative, and he put amative sexual intercourse on the same footing with other ordinary forms of social interchange. Sexual intercourse as Noyes defines it is the insertion of the penis into the vagina; ejaculation is not a requirement for sexual intercourse. Noyes found ordinary sexual intercourse to be:a momentary affair, terminating in exhaustion and disgust. If it begins in the spirit, it soon ends in the flesh; i. e., the amative, which is spiritual, is drowned in the propagative, which is sensual. The exhaustion which follows naturally breeds self-reproach and shame, and this leads to dislike and concealment of the sexual organs, which contract disagreeable associations from the fact that they are the instruments of pernicious excess. This undoubtedly is the philosophy of the origin of shame after the fall. Adam and Eve first sunk the spiritual in the sensual, in eating the forbidden fruit; and then, having lost the true balance of their natures, they sunk the spiritual in the sensual in their intercourse with each other, by pushing prematurely beyond the amative to the propagative, and so became ashamed, and began to look with an evil eye on the instruments of their folly.Intercourse was spiritual; masturbation and the practice of intercourse without intention to propagate was shameful and wasteful. Noyes&#x27; theory of male continence consisted of analyzing sexual intercourse, recognizing in it two distinct acts, the social and the propagative. Noyes believed this to be practical and believed that a man should be content with avoiding the pleasure except when procreation is a desired result. Noyes believed sex limited to traditional Christian marriage practices left most young people facing sexual starvation from puberty (which according to Noyes was 14) to the age of marriage (which was about 24). Noyes&#x27; solution was that the young men in the community would practice with the women of the community who had already gone through menopause, until they were able to control their ejaculation. Only Noyes and a few other men had the skills and self-control necessary to participate in sexual intercourse with the young women of the community. Sexual intercourse was communal, it was based on consent, and all sexual unions were documented and regulated. Sexual intercourse was spiritual, and the pairing of man and woman for sexual intercourse in the community had to be approved by a committee, although most of the virgin females of the community were reserved for Noyes. Noyes did believe that women had the right to choose if and when to bear a child, which was not a common belief at the time.

Noyes also addressed the medical arguments in response to his practices:in regard to the injurious effects of Male Continence, which have been anticipated and often predicted, the Community has to report, in general, that they have not been realized. For example: It is seriously believed by many that nature requires a periodical and somewhat frequent discharge of the seed, and that the retention of it is liable to be injurious. Even if this were true, it would be no argument against Male Continence, but rather an argument in favor of masturbation; for it is obvious that before marriage men have no lawful method of discharge but masturbation; and after marriage it is as foolish and cruel to expend one&#x27;s seed on a wife merely for the sake of getting rid of it, as it would be to fire a gun at one&#x27;s best friend merely for the sake of unloading it.All the members of the community lived in their communal home, which made keeping track of sexual intercourse much easier. After sexual intercourse individuals were required to return to their own rooms.

The Community&#x27;s practice of birth control meant that for many years the birthrate was low. Any children born into the community were raised by the community and not in the tradition of family.

===Exile===
In June 1879, one of Noyes&#x27; most loyal followers alerted him that he was about to be arrested for statutory rape. In the middle of the night, Noyes fled Oneida for Ontario, Canada, where the Community had a factory. In August, he wrote back to the Community, stating that it was time to abandon the practice of complex marriage and live in a more traditional manner. The Community formally dissolved and converted to a joint stock company on January 1, 1881.

Although Noyes never returned to the United States, he remained a powerful influence over many of his followers. Some even left Oneida to come to the Niagara Falls area. Jessie Catherine Kinsley, entertaining marriage proposals from two young men, wrote to Noyes for his advice. When Noyes advised her to reject both proposals and take up with Myron Kinsley—the follower who had tipped him off to his impending arrest, and a man twenty years her senior—she took Noyes&#x27; advice.

===Death and legacy===
John Humphrey Noyes died in Niagara Falls, Ontario, on April 13, 1886. His body was returned to Oneida and is buried in the Oneida Community Cemetery with those of many of his followers.

In the early decades of the 20th century, Noyes&#x27; son Pierrepont consolidated the Community&#x27;s industries and focused solely on silverware production. The company became known as Oneida Limited and was the largest producer of flatware in the world for much of the 20th century. The Community&#x27;s second communal dwelling, the brick &quot;mansion house&quot;, survives today as a multi-use facility encompassing a museum, apartments, dormitory housing, guest rooms, and meeting and banquet facilities.

<text>Isernia () is a town and &quot;comune&quot; in the southern Italian region of Molise, and the capital of the province of Isernia.

==Geography==
Situated on a rocky crest rising from between the Carpino and the Sordo rivers, the plan of Isernia still reflects the ancient layout of the Roman town, with a central wide street, the &quot;cardo maximus&quot;, still represented by Corso Marcelli, and side streets at right angles on both sides.

The comune of Isernia includes 16 frazioni. The most densely populated is Castelromano which is positioned in a plain at the base of the La Romana mount, elevation , from Isernia.

==History==
The area of Isernia was settled at least 70 000 years ago: the nearby site called &quot;Pineta&quot; has been cited in the magazine &quot;Science&quot; as the most ancient site where traces of use of fire by humans have been found.

The city&#x27;s Roman name, Aesernia, reflects probably a former Samnite toponym, but a connection to an Indo-European root, &quot;aeser&quot;, which means &quot;water&quot;, is tenuous.

Classical Aesernia was a city of Samnium, included within the territory of the Pentri tribe, situated in the valley of the Vulturnus (modern Volturno), on a small stream flowing into that river, and distant from Venafrum (modern Venafro). The Itinerary (in which the name is written &quot;Serni&quot;) places it on the road from Aufidena to Bovianum, at the distance of from the former, and from the latter; but the former number is corrupt, as are the distances in the &quot;Tabula Peutingeriana&quot;.

The first mention of it in history occurs in 295 BC, at which time it had already fallen into the hands of the Romans, together with the whole valley of the Vulturnus. After the complete subjugation of the Samnites, a colony, with Latin rights (colonia Latina) was settled there by the Romans in 264 BC the city, a key communication center between southern Italy and the inner Regions. This colony is again mentioned in 209 BC as one of the eighteen which remained faithful to Rome at the most trying period of the Second Punic War. During the Social War it adhered to the Roman cause, and was gallantly defended against the Samnite general Vettius Scato, by Marcus Claudius Marcellus, nor was it till after a long protracted siege that it was compelled by famine to surrender, 90 BC. Henceforth it continued in the hands of the confederates; and at a later period of the contest afforded a shelter to the Samnite leader, Gaius Papius Mutilus, after his defeat by Lucius Cornelius Sulla. It even became for a time, after the successive fall of Corfinium (modern Corfinio) and Bovianum, the headquarters of the Italic League. At this time it was evidently a place of importance and a strong fortress, but it was so severely punished for its defection by Sulla after the final defeat of the Samnites in 88 BC, that Strabo speaks of it as in his time utterly deserted.

We learn, however, that a colony was sent there by Julius Caesar, and again by Augustus; but apparently with little success, on which account it was recolonized under Nero. It never, however, enjoyed the rank of a colony, but appears from inscriptions to have been a municipal town of some importance in the time of Trajan and the Antonines. To this period belong the remains of an aqueduct and a fine Roman bridge, still visible; while the lower parts of the modern walls present considerable portions of polygonal construction, which may be assigned either to the ancient Samnite city, or to the first Roman colony. The modern city is still the see of a bishop. The massively constructed podium now underlying the cathedral probably supported the Capitolium.

In the early 7th century AD, what are today the comuni of Isernia as well as Bojano and Sepino were the places where Grimoald I of Benevento settled a group of Bulgars, seeking refuge from the Avars; the Bulgars were for many generations a distinctive part of the population, until finally assimilated in their Italian environment (see Bulgarians in Italy, Old Great Bulgaria#Bulgars in Southern Italy).

Even after the fall of the Western Roman Empire, Isernia has suffered destruction numerous times in history. Isernia was destroyed by the Saracens in 800, sacked by Markward of Anweiler, Count of Molise, in 1199, and set on fire in 1223 by the soldiers of Frederick II. In 1519 it was freed from feudal servitude by Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor and became a city in the Kingdom of Naples.

Earthquakes in 847, 1349, 1456 and 1805 caused massive destruction.

On the morning of September 10, 1943, during World War II, American planes launched their bombs from B-17 Flying Fortress planes over a crowded town on market day causing thousands of deaths. In the following weeks they came back twelve times without ever hitting their targets: the bridges of Isernia, Cardarelli and Santo Spirito, then built entirely of iron, towards the internal area. All the bridges were vital to the German retreat.

In 1970 Isernia became the capital of the province of the same name, created out of part of the province of Campobasso.

==Economy==
The hills around Isernia produces red, white and rose &quot;Pentro di Isernia&quot;, an Italian DOC wine. The grapes are limited to harvest yields of 11 tonnes/ha with the finished red and &quot;rose&quot; wines needing a minimum alcohol level of 11% and the finished whites required to have at least 10.5% alcohol. The reds and &quot;roses&quot; are composed of 45-55% Montepulciano, 45-55% Sangiovese and up to 10% local grape varieties to fill out the blend if needed. The whites are composed of 60-70% Trebbiano, 30-40% Bombino bianco and up to 10% local varieties to fill out the blend if needed.

==Coinage==
The coins of Aesernia, which are found only in copper, and have the legend &quot;AISERNINO&quot;, belong to the period of the first Roman colony; the style of their execution attests the influence of the neighboring Campania.

==Government==
==Main sights==
Although having suffered repeated destruction, Isernia preserves a large number of archaeological remains. The historical center still keeps intact the spare map structure of the Roman cities: in fact it represents the largest raced Marcelli street, around which there is an infinity of alleys and little spares, as for example, &quot;Trento e Trieste&quot; spares. The famous Fraterna Fountain, the town&#x27;s main symbol, was built in the 13th century: it is made up of living stone&#x27;s slabs coming from ruined Roman monuments, while all the rest is a work of local masters, commissioned by the Rampini family of Isernia.

===&quot;Fontana Fraterna&quot;===

The “Fontana Fraterna” is a refined public fountain with six water jets, with an unusual arcade-shape, made of blocks of calcareous, compact stone. It is built of Roman and Romanesque materials, and had been restored in 1835.

The fountain has articulated into three fillets laid one upon the other. From below, there is a series of smooth fillets (the one on the left is a Roman-epoch and fragmentary epigraph with the letters AE PONT, while in the centre there is a mat decorated with dolphins and a Roman-age flower, probably coming from a sepulchral building), then there is a median fillet with a series of six round arches supported, on the left side, by little circular columns and on the right side, by little octagonal columns.

Above these columns there are some capitals of re-employment. Two capitals have trapezoidal-plant abacus and perhaps adorned a window splay. The higher fillet presents a line of smooth ashlars on which twelve little hanging arches set, supported by little brackets adorned with zoomorphic, phytomorphic and geometric motives. On the bottom of the fountain, on a second level in respect to the arcade, you can distinguish two blocks of Roman age with some swags and a funerary epigraph dedicated to the god Mani. On its right side there is a third high-mediaeval epigraph, situated between two lion statues, referring to the building of a fountain. A deep study of the surfaces allows to verify that the blocks were worked on several occasions, with an extremely long interval, and that come from an undefined number of buildings of the town. Therefore, the handiwork represents an interesting abacus of workings, decorative elements, an exemplar of material culture with centuries of town history written on.

===La Pineta===
Isernia La Pineta is an archaeological excavation site containing thousands of bones and stone tools covering . It was discovered in 1979, by an amateur naturalist who noticed a bone sticking out of the side of a cut that had been created by the construction of the Napoli-Vasto motorway. The site was clearly created by humans, but its purpose is still unknown.
