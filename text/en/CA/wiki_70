<text>Dennis &quot;Denny&quot; Joseph O&#x27;Neil (May 3, 1939 – June 11, 2020) was an American comic book writer and editor, principally for Marvel Comics and DC Comics from the 1960s through the 1990s, and Group Editor for the Batman family of titles until his retirement.

His best-known works include &quot;Green Lantern/Green Arrow&quot; and &quot;Batman&quot; with Neal Adams. For &quot;Batman&quot;, the team is credited with returning the character to his dark pulp fiction roots, in contrast to the campy &quot;Batman&quot; television series of the 1960s. However, comics historian Les Daniels considers O&#x27;Neil&#x27;s &quot;vengeful obsessive-compulsive&quot; Batman to be an original interpretation that has influenced all subsequent portrayals of the character. It was during this run that O&#x27;Neil co-created the Batman villains Ra&#x27;s al Ghul and Talia al Ghul. During their &quot;Green Lantern/Green Arrow&quot; run, O&#x27;Neil and Adams introduced a mature, realistic tone through stories such as &quot;Snowbirds Don&#x27;t Fly&quot;, in which Green Arrow&#x27;s ward Roy Harper is revealed to have become addicted to drugs. They also created and introduced the Green Lantern character John Stewart in 1971.

As an editor, he is principally known for editing the various Batman titles beginning in 1986 after returning to DC. In 1989, O&#x27;Neil launched the &quot;&quot; series, and was the writer for the &quot;Shaman&quot; and &quot;Venom&quot; stories. O&#x27;Neil led the Batman creative teams for the &quot;&quot; (1993–1994) story arc. O&#x27;Neil co-created the antihero Azrael (Jean-Paul Valley) in 1992, who temporarily became the new Batman during &quot;Knightfall&quot;. After the storyline&#x27;s conclusion, O&#x27;Neil was the writer for an Azrael monthly series that lasted 100 issues.

His other notable work includes creating Richard Dragon with Jim Berry, and runs on &quot;The Shadow&quot; with Michael Kaluta and &quot;The Question&quot; with Denys Cowan. While working for Marvel during the 1980s, O&#x27;Neil scripted issues for &quot;The Amazing Spider-Man&quot;, &quot;Iron Man&quot;, and &quot;Daredevil&quot;. In the late 1990s, O&#x27;Neil taught a comics writing course at Manhattan&#x27;s School of Visual Arts. He also sat on the board of directors of the charity The Hero Initiative and served on its Disbursement Committee.

==Early life==
O&#x27;Neil was born into an Irish Catholic household in St. Louis, Missouri on May 3, 1939. On Sunday afternoons he would accompany his father or his grandfather to the store for some light groceries and an occasional comic book. O&#x27;Neil graduated from Saint Louis University around the turn of the 1960s with a degree centered on English literature, creative writing, and philosophy. From there he joined the U.S. Navy just in time to participate in the blockade of Cuba during the Cuban Missile Crisis.

==Career==

===Writing===
After leaving the Navy, O&#x27;Neil moved on to a job with a newspaper in Cape Girardeau, Missouri. O&#x27;Neil wrote bi-weekly columns for the youth page, and during the slow summer months he filled the space with a series on the revival of the comics industry. This attracted the attention of Roy Thomas, who would eventually himself become one of the great names in the history of the medium.

====Marvel Comics====
When Roy Thomas left DC Comics to work for Stan Lee at Marvel Comics, he suggested that O&#x27;Neil take the Marvel writer&#x27;s test, which involved adding dialogue to a wordless four-page excerpt of a Fantastic Four comic. O&#x27;Neil&#x27;s entry resulted in Lee offering O&#x27;Neil a job. O&#x27;Neil had never considered writing for comics, and later said he&#x27;d done the test &quot;kind of as a joke. I had a couple of hours on a Tuesday afternoon, so instead of doing crossword puzzles, I did the writer&#x27;s test.&quot; He had intended to only work in the comics industry for six months to make some extra money, but soon found enjoyment from creating comic book scripts, and abandoned his plans to move back to the Midwestern United States to be a journalist.

O&#x27;Neil took the reins for a short-term run of Marvel&#x27;s Doctor Strange stories in &quot;Strange Tales,&quot; writing dialogue and captions for six issues that were plotted by artist Steve Ditko. He also wrote for such titles as &quot;Rawhide Kid&quot; and &quot;Millie the Model,&quot; and scripted the final 13 pages of &quot;Daredevil&quot; #18 over a plot by Lee when Lee went on vacation.

Briefly returning to Marvel a few years later, O&#x27;Neil and artist Neal Adams revived the Professor X character in &quot;X-Men&quot; #65 in one of the creative team&#x27;s earliest collaborations.

====Charlton Comics====
The available jobs writing for Marvel petered out fairly quickly, and O&#x27;Neil took a job with Charlton Comics under the pseudonym of Sergius O&#x27;Shaugnessy. There he received regular work for a year and a half from Charlton&#x27;s editor Dick Giordano.

&quot;Sergius O&#x27;Shaugnessy&quot; is the name of the protagonist of Norman Mailer&#x27;s 1955 novel &quot;The Deer Park.&quot; O&#x27;Neil has quoted Mailer&#x27;s writing in at least one of his comic book scripts. He would continue using the pseudonym occasionally throughout his career.

====DC Comics====
In 1968, Dick Giordano was offered an editorial position at DC Comics and took a number of Charlton freelancers with him, including O&#x27;Neil.
O&#x27;Neil&#x27;s first assignments involved two strategies for bolstering DC&#x27;s sales. One approach centered on the creation of new characters, and O&#x27;Neil scripted several issues of &quot;Beware the Creeper&quot;, a series starring a new hero, the Creeper, created by artist Steve Ditko. From there, DC moved O&#x27;Neil to &quot;Wonder Woman&quot; and &quot;Justice League of America&quot;. With artist Mike Sekowsky, he took away Wonder Woman&#x27;s powers, exiled her from the Amazon community, and set her off, uncostumed, into international intrigues with her blind mentor, I Ching. These changes did not sit well with Wonder Woman&#x27;s older fans, particularly feminists, and O&#x27;Neil later acknowledged that de-powering DC&#x27;s most well-known superheroine had unintentionally alienated readers. In &quot;Justice League&quot;, he had more success, scripting socially and politically themed stories that presaged his later work on &quot;Green Lantern/Green Arrow&quot;. He and artist Dick Dillin made several changes to the membership of the JLA by removing founding members the Martian Manhunter and Wonder Woman.

Following the lead set by Bob Haney and Neal Adams in a &quot;Brave and the Bold&quot; story that visually redefined Green Arrow into the version that appeared in comics between 1969 and 1986, O&#x27;Neil stripped him of his wealth and playboy status, making him an urban hero. This redefinition would culminate in the character that appeared in &quot;Green Lantern/Green Arrow&quot; (with many stories also drawn by Adams), a socially conscious, left-wing creation that effectively took over Green Lantern&#x27;s book to use him as a foil and straw man in sounding out the political concepts that would define that work. It was during this period that the most famous Green Arrow story appeared, in &quot;Green Lantern&quot; #85–86 (&quot;Snowbirds Don&#x27;t Fly&quot;), when it was revealed that Green Arrow&#x27;s ward Speedy was addicted to heroin. As a result of his work on &quot;Green Lantern and Green Arrow&quot;, O&#x27;Neil recounted, &quot;I went from total obscurity to seeing my name featured in &quot;The New York Times&quot; and being invited to do talk shows. It&#x27;s by no means an unmixed blessing. That messed up my head pretty thoroughly for a couple of years. ... Deteriorating marriage, bad habits, deteriorating relationships with human beings – with anything that wasn&#x27;t a typewriter, in fact. It was a bad few years there.&quot; O&#x27;Neil and Adams also created Green Lantern John Stewart, who debuted in &quot;Green Lantern&quot; vol. 2 #87 (December 1971/January 1972).

O&#x27;Neil&#x27;s 1970s run on the Batman titles, under the direction of editor Julius Schwartz, is perhaps his best-known endeavor, getting back to the character&#x27;s darker roots after a period dominated by the campiness of the 1960s TV series. Comics historian Les Daniels observed that &quot;O&#x27;Neil&#x27;s interpretation of Batman as a vengeful obsessive-compulsive, which he modestly describes as a return to the roots, was actually an act of creative imagination that has influenced every subsequent version of the Dark Knight.&quot; O&#x27;Neil and Adams&#x27; creation Ra&#x27;s al Ghul was introduced in the story &quot;Daughter of the Demon&quot; in &quot;Batman&quot; #232 (June 1971). O&#x27;Neil and artist Bob Brown also created Talia al Ghul. During this period, O&#x27;Neil frequently teamed up with Adams (with Giordano often assisting on inks) on a number of memorable issues of both &quot;Batman&quot; and &quot;Detective Comics&quot;. The creative team would revive Two-Face in &quot;Half an Evil&quot; in &quot;Batman&quot; #234 (Aug. 1971) and revitalize the Joker in &quot;The Joker&#x27;s Five-Way Revenge!&quot; in &quot;Batman&quot; #251 (Sept. 1973), a landmark story bringing the character back to his roots as a homicidal maniac who murders people on a whim and delights in his mayhem. O&#x27;Neil and Giordano created the Batman supporting character Leslie Thompkins in the story &quot;There Is No Hope in Crime Alley&quot; in &quot;Detective Comics&quot; #457 (March 1976). O&#x27;Neil and artist Don Newton killed the original version of Batwoman in &quot;Detective Comics&quot; #485 (Aug.–Sept. 1979). He wrote a short Christmas story, &quot;Wanted: Santa Claus – Dead or Alive&quot;, for &quot;DC Special Series&quot; #21 (Spring 1980) which featured Frank Miller&#x27;s first art on a Batman story.

When Julius Schwartz became the editor of &quot;Superman&quot; with issue #233 (Jan. 1971), he had O&#x27;Neil and artist Curt Swan streamline the Superman mythos in &quot;The Sandman Saga&quot;, starting with the elimination of kryptonite. In 1973, O&#x27;Neil wrote revivals of two characters for which DC had recently acquired the publishing rights. A new series featuring the original Captain Marvel was launched with a February cover date and featured art by the character&#x27;s original artist C. C. Beck. Later that same year, O&#x27;Neil and artist Michael Kaluta produced an &quot;atmospheric interpretation&quot; of the 1930s pulp hero in &quot;The Shadow&quot; series. In 1975, O&#x27;Neil wrote a comic book adaptation of the 1930s hero the Avenger. A revival of the &quot;Green Lantern&quot; title in 1976 was launched by O&#x27;Neil and artist Mike Grell.
Reuniting with Adams, O&#x27;Neil co-wrote the oversize &quot;Superman vs. Muhammad Ali&quot; (1978) which Adams has called a personal favorite of their collaborations. In World’s Finest #263 (1980), he wrote &quot;Final Secret of the Super-Sons&quot;, which wrapped up the Super-Sons stories by exposing them to be just characters inside a computer in Superman&#x27;s Fortress of Solitude, with Superman then ordering them to commit suicide by jumping into the Fortress&#x27; disintegration pit after they escape their computer simulated world.

====Return to Marvel Comics====
Upon O&#x27;Neil&#x27;s return to Marvel Comics in 1980, he took on the scripting chores for &quot;The Amazing Spider-Man&quot;, which he did for a year. O&#x27;Neil wrote two issues of &quot;The Amazing Spider-Man Annual&quot;, both drawn by Frank Miller. The 1980 &quot;Annual&quot; featured a team-up with Doctor Strange while the 1981 &quot;Annual&quot; showcased a meeting with the Punisher. He and artist John Romita Jr. introduced Madame Web in &quot;The Amazing Spider-Man&quot; #210 and Hydro-Man in #212. O&#x27;Neil was the regular scripter for &quot;Iron Man&quot; from 1982 to 1986 and &quot;Daredevil&quot; from 1983 to 1985. During his run on &quot;Iron Man&quot;, O&#x27;Neil introduced Obadiah Stane, later the Iron Monger, plunged Tony Stark back into alcoholism, turned Jim Rhodes into Iron Man, and created the Silver Centurion armor. O&#x27;Neil&#x27;s run on &quot;Daredevil&quot; bridged the gap between Frank Miller&#x27;s two runs on the title, usually with David Mazzucchelli as artist. He introduced Yuriko Oyama during his stint, who would later become the villain Lady Deathstrike. While working for Marvel, he helped write the original character concept for &quot;The Transformers&quot;, and is credited as the person who named Optimus Prime.

====Return to DC Comics====
After returning to DC Comics in 1986, he became the editor of the various Batman titles and served in that capacity until 2000. In February 1987, O&#x27;Neil began writing &quot;The Question&quot; ongoing series which was primarily drawn by Denys Cowan. Between the years of 1988 and 1990, O&#x27;Neil would return to &quot;Green Arrow&quot; by writing the &quot;Annual&quot;s, while Mike Grell wrote the monthly title. Because he was also in charge of &quot;The Question&quot;, he would appear in all three &quot;Annual&quot;s that he wrote. The &quot;&quot; series began in 1989 with the five-part &quot;Shaman&quot; storyline by O&#x27;Neil and artist Ed Hannigan. The series was the first new Batman title in almost fifty years, and the first issue sold almost a million copies. &quot;Armageddon 2001&quot; was a 1991 crossover event storyline. It ran through a self-titled two-issue limited series and most of the &quot;Annual&quot;s DC published that year from May through October. Each participating annual explored potential possible futures for its main characters. The series was written by O&#x27;Neil and Archie Goodwin and drawn by Dan Jurgens. He and artist Joe Quesada created the character Azrael, who was introduced in the four-issue miniseries &quot;Batman: Sword of Azrael&quot; in 1992. That same year, O&#x27;Neil wrote the &quot;Batman: Birth of the Demon&quot; hardcover graphic novel. Another DC one-shot issue that O&#x27;Neil wrote in 1992 was &quot;Batman/Green Arrow: The Poison Tomorrow&quot;.
O&#x27;Neil led the Batman creative teams for the &quot;&quot; (1993–1994) story arc, during which Azrael temporarily became the new Batman. In 1994, O&#x27;Neil wrote a novelization of &quot;Knightfall&quot;. In the opening of the novelization, O&#x27;Neil stated that part of the reason &quot;Knightfall&quot; was written was due to the recent popularity of more &quot;ruthless&quot; heroes such as the Terminator and James Bond in films, as editors were starting to wonder if readers would prefer a Batman who was willing to kill his opponents.

After the conclusion of &quot;Knightfall&quot;, O&#x27;Neil wrote the 100-issue &quot;Azrael&quot; comic series, chronicling Valley&#x27;s battles against the Order of St. Dumas, between 1995 and 2003. O&#x27;Neil modeled the series on Arthurian legends, comparing Azrael&#x27;s quest to discover the truth about himself to the Holy Grail. The series was originally intended to conclude with Azrael&#x27;s death. However, after O&#x27;Neil suffered a heart attack in September 2002, editor Mike Carlin decided it wouldn&#x27;t be appropriate to have a character O&#x27;Neil created be killed off. O&#x27;Neil instead left Azrael&#x27;s fate vague, preferring to let readers decide what happened to him.

====Other writing====
O&#x27;Neil wrote several novels, comics, short stories, reviews and teleplays, including the novelizations of the films &quot;Batman Begins&quot; and &quot;The Dark Knight&quot;. Under the pseudonym Jim Dennis with writer Jim Berry, O&#x27;Neil scripted a series of novels about a kung fu character named Richard Dragon, and later adapted those novels to comic book form for DC.

O&#x27;Neil wrote a four-part column series for Marvel&#x27;s 1978 &quot;The Hulk!&quot; magazine, under the pseudonym Jeff Mundo. &quot;Jeff Mundo&#x27;s Dark Corners&quot; ran from issue #21 through issue #24 and covered various pop culture topics.

O&#x27;Neil also wrote a column for ComicMix.

===Editing===
Joining Marvel&#x27;s editorial staff in 1980, O&#x27;Neil edited &quot;Daredevil&quot; during Frank Miller&#x27;s run as writer/artist. He fired writer Roger McKenzie so that Miller could both write and pencil &quot;Daredevil&quot;, a decision which then-Marvel editor-in-chief Jim Shooter says saved the series from cancellation. O&#x27;Neil encouraged Miller to develop a believable fighting style for Daredevil, and according to Miller, this directly led to his incorporating martial arts into &quot;Daredevil&quot; and later &quot;Ronin&quot;. In the early to mid-1980s, O&#x27;Neil edited such Marvel titles as&quot; Alpha Flight&quot;, &quot;Power Man and Iron Fist&quot;, &quot;G.I. Joe: A Real American Hero&quot;, and &quot;Moon Knight&quot;.

In 1986, O&#x27;Neil moved over to DC as an editor, becoming group editor for the company&#x27;s Batman titles. Speaking about his role in the death of character Jason Todd, O&#x27;Neil remarked:&lt;br&gt;

It changed my mind about what I do for a living. Superman and Batman have been in continuous publication for over half a century, and it&#x27;s never been true of any fictional construct before. These characters have a lot more weight than the hero of a popular sitcom that lasts maybe four years. They have become postindustrial folklore, and part of this job is to be the custodian of folk figures. Everybody on Earth knows Batman and Robin.

O&#x27;Neil said that he saw editing as a support role which should be invisible to the reader, and that if it were his choice his name would not appear in the credits when working as an editor, only when working as a writer.

===Teaching===
After graduating college, O&#x27;Neil taught English in the St. Louis public school system for one year. O&#x27;Neil spent several years in the late 1990s teaching a Writing for the Comics course at Manhattan&#x27;s School of Visual Arts, sometimes sharing duties with fellow comic book writer John Ostrander.

==Personal life==
O&#x27;Neil was married to Marifran O&#x27;Neil, until her death. He was the father of writer/director/producer Lawrence &quot;Larry&quot; O&#x27;Neil, best known for the 1997 film &quot;Breast Men&quot;.

O&#x27;Neil died of cardiopulmonary arrest on June 11, 2020, at the age of 81. The animated feature &quot;&quot; was dedicated in his memory. The following year, Larry O&#x27;Neil wrote a six-page tribute to his father, &quot;Tap Tap Tap,&quot; which was illustrated by Jorge Fornés and published in &quot;Green Arrow 80th Anniversary 100-Page Super Spectacular&quot; #1 (August 2021); the story summarizes O&#x27;Neil&#x27;s life from childhood to death without any written dialogue, instead using logos and other pictograms.

==Awards==
O&#x27;Neil&#x27;s work won him a great deal of recognition in the comics industry, including the Shazam Awards for Best Continuing Feature &quot;Green Lantern/Green Arrow&quot;, Best Individual Story for &quot;No Evil Shall Escape My Sight&quot; in &quot;Green Lantern&quot; #76 (with Neal Adams), for Best Writer (Dramatic Division) in 1970 for Green Lantern, Batman, Superman, and other titles, and Best Individual Story for &quot;Snowbirds Don&#x27;t Fly&quot; in &quot;Green Lantern&quot; #85 (with Adams) in 1971.

O&#x27;Neil was given a Goethe Award in 1971 for &quot;Favorite Pro Writer&quot; and was a nominee for the same award in 1973. He shared a 1971 Goethe Award with artist Neal Adams for &quot;Favorite Comic-Book Story&quot; for &quot;No Evil Shall Escape My Sight.&quot;

O&#x27;Neil received an Inkpot Award in 1981 and in 1985, DC Comics named O&#x27;Neil as one of the honorees in the company&#x27;s 50th anniversary publication &quot;Fifty Who Made DC Great&quot;.

==Appearances in media==
In &quot;The Batman Adventures&quot;—the first DC Comics spinoff of &quot;&quot;—a caricature of O&#x27;Neil appears as The Perfesser, one of a screwball trio of incompetent supervillains that also includes the Mastermind (a caricature of Mike Carlin) and Mr. Nice (a caricature of Archie Goodwin). The Perfesser is depicted as a tall, pipe-smoking genius who often gets lost in his own thoughts; his name is likely derived from Cosmo &quot;Perfessor&quot; Fishhawk of &quot;Shoe&quot;, which O&#x27;Neil was a known reader of.

In 2013, O&#x27;Neil was among the comic book writers interviewed in the PBS documentary .

<text>Henry Leavitt Ellsworth (November 10, 1791 – December 27, 1858) was a Yale-educated attorney who became the first Commissioner of the U.S. Patent Office, where he encouraged innovation by inventors Samuel F.B. Morse and Samuel Colt. Ellsworth also served as the second president of the Aetna Insurance Company, and was a major donor to Yale College, a commissioner to Indian tribes on the western frontier, and the founder of what became the United States Department of Agriculture.

==Early life==
Ellsworth was born in Windsor, Connecticut, son of Founding Father and Chief Justice Oliver Ellsworth and Abigail Wolcott. Ellsworth graduated from Yale University in 1810, and studied law at Tapping Reeve&#x27;s Litchfield Law School in 1811. On June 22, 1813, he married Nancy Allen Goodrich (daughter of Congressman, Judge, New Haven Mayor and longtime Secretary of the Yale Corporation Elizur Goodrich and his wife Anne Willard Allen) with whom Ellsworth had three children, including son Henry W. Ellsworth.

Later in life, he had two subsequent wives, Marietta Mariana Bartlett and Catherine Smith. Ellsworth was named in part for his grandmother&#x27;s family, the Leavitts of Suffield, Connecticut. After studying law under Judge Gould in Litchfield, Connecticut, he settled first at Windsor and then at Hartford, where he remained for a decade.

==Travels==
In 1811, when he was 19 years old and a freshly minted Yale graduate, Ellsworth undertook the first of several western trips during his lifetime. Ellsworth traveled by horseback to the Connecticut Western Reserve in present-day Ohio to investigate family lands in the region. Ellsworth&#x27;s father Oliver Ellsworth had purchased over in the Western Reserve, including most of present-day Cleveland, joining with other prominent Connecticut men snapping up over three million acres (12,000 km2) sold by the state of Connecticut. (Among the eight original purchasers was a family relation, merchant Thaddeus Leavitt of Suffield.) Ellsworth wrote a small, uneven book about his experiences entitled &quot;A Tour to New Connecticut in 1811&quot;. Ellsworth&#x27;s mission was straightening out irregularities in land sales by the family agent.

It was an arduous trip. Along the way Ellsworth made note of attractive vistas, rowdy drunks, solicitous innkeepers and his disappointment in places of which he had heard, like Erie. The journey&#x27;s rigors were relieved by a meeting with his old friend Margaret Dwight, daughter of Yale president Timothy Dwight IV, who was visiting family in present-day Warren, Ohio. &quot;Here too&quot;, wrote Ellsworth, &quot;I met with my good old friend Margaret Dwight, we sat down and passed a few hours in social chat.&quot; Dwight wrote her own account of her Western Reserve trip, &quot;A Journey to Ohio in 1810&quot;.

Over twenty years later, in 1832, Ellsworth traveled west again, this time as U.S. Commissioner of Indian Tribes in Arkansas and Oklahoma. President Andrew Jackson appointed Ellsworth one of three commissioners to &quot;study the country, to mark the boundaries, to pacify the warring Indians and, in general to establish order and justice&quot; after Congress&#x27;s passage of the 1830 Indian Removal Act. Ellsworth travelled to Fort Gibson to investigate the situation. (Some critics blame Ellsworth for being complicit in the subsequent removal of Native Americans to Indian Territory, present-day Oklahoma, particularly since Ellsworth&#x27;s appointment and subsequent western trip followed the Indian Removal Act, Andrew Jackson&#x27;s first significant act as president. Other historians note Ellsworth&#x27;s sympathetic outlook towards the tribes.)

Along the way, Ellsworth made stops in Cincinnati and Louisville, then traveled on to St. Louis, Missouri, where he met with explorer William Clark and saw the recently captured Native American leader Black Hawk, chief of the Sauk people. Leavitt&#x27;s mission was a complicated one: he was charged with trying to mediate between the conflicting claims of several Indian tribes, who were being forced into an ever-smaller area, in competition with newer immigrants and the interests of the Chouteau family, the powerful St. Louis magnates of the Midwestern fur trade.

Ellsworth was accompanied on the expedition by three companions: author Washington Irving, who recorded his impressions in &quot;A Tour on the Prairies&quot;; Charles La Trobe, an Englishman, mountaineer and travel writer who later served in the British diplomatic corps in the West Indies and Australia; and Swiss Count Albert Pourtales.

Washington Irving wrote of Henry Leavitt Ellsworth, &quot;this worthy leader of our little band&quot;: &quot;He was a native of one of the towns of Connecticut, a man in whom a course of legal practice and political life had not been able to vitiate an innate simplicity and benevolence of heart. The greater part of his days had been passed in the bosom of his family and the society of deacons, elders, and statesmen, on the peaceful banks of the Connecticut; when suddenly he had been called to mount his steed, shoulder his rifle and mingle among stark hunters, backwoodsmen, and naked savages, on the trackless wilds of the Far West.&quot;

==Patent Office==
In 1835, Ellsworth was elected mayor of Hartford, Connecticut, but had served only a month when he was appointed the first Commissioner of the U.S. Patent Office, an office he held for ten years, from 1835 until 1845. His twin brother William W. Ellsworth was Governor of Connecticut from 1838 to 1842, and served as a U.S. Congressman from Connecticut as well. William Wolcott Ellsworth was married to the daughter of Noah Webster, the publisher of the eponymous dictionaries.

When he arrived at the Patent Office, Ellsworth found one third of the floor-space in his office occupied by over 60 models of inventions; he moved them to a separate room. He also found that no list of patent applicants had ever been drawn up, a deficiency he soon corrected.

Acting as Patent Commissioner, Ellsworth made a decision that profoundly affected the future of Hartford and Connecticut. The young Samuel Colt was struggling to establish a firm to manufacture his new revolver. Ellsworth became interested in Colt&#x27;s invention, and in 1836 made the decision to issue Colt U.S. Patent No. 138. On the basis of Ellsworth&#x27;s decision, Colt was able to raise some $200,000 from investors to incorporate the Patent Arms Manufacturing Company of Paterson, New Jersey, the forerunner of the mighty Colt arms manufacturing empire.

In today&#x27;s world Ellsworth would be described as an early technology adapter. He became so interested, for instance, in a new-fangled invention by Samuel Morse called the telegraph that Ellsworth petitioned Congress for a $30,000 grant to test the possibilities of the technology.

From Ellsworth&#x27;s exposure to the West and knowledge of inventions, he prophesied late in life that the lands of the West would be cultivated by means of steam plows. This prophecy was introduced in the probate of his will in an attempt to prove that he was of unsound mind.

Ellsworth was proven correct, of course, and his interest in agriculture during his time as Patent Commissioner induced Congress in 1839 to appropriate the first monies for farming, which were used to collect seeds from foreign countries and distribute them through the United States post office, as Ellsworth had urged. By 1845 Ellsworth&#x27;s patent office was performing the functions of a full-fledged agricultural bureau. For this accomplishment Ellsworth earned the sobriquet &quot;Father of the United States Department of Agriculture.&quot;

A comment by Ellsworth about the increased workload at the patent office, taken out of context and embellished, was apparently the source of an urban legend that a patent office official (Charles H. Duell in some versions) claimed that everything which could be invented had already been invented. In his 1843 report to Congress, Ellsworth stated: &quot;The advancement of the arts, from year to year, taxes our credulity and seems to presage the arrival of that period when human improvement must end.&quot; The report then lists a record number of patents, implying his comment was intended to be humorous.

Following Ellsworth&#x27;s stint in the Patent Office, he settled in Lafayette, Indiana, acting as an agent for purchase and settlement of public land, but in 1857 he returned to Connecticut. While in Indiana, he served as a presidential elector on the Free Soil Party ticket in 1848. Ellsworth later served as an early president of the Aetna Insurance Company. He was an early benefactor of Yale College, donating some $700,000 to his alma mater, as well as title to the Ellsworth lands in the former Western Reserve.

==Legacy==
Ellsworth died, aged 67, on December 27, 1858, in Fair Haven, Connecticut. Following his death, Ellsworth&#x27;s papers were discovered among the family papers of the Goodrich family. Ellsworth was a Yale classmate of Chauncey Allen Goodrich, whose sister Nancy Henry Leavitt Ellsworth married. The journal of Ellsworth&#x27;s first trip to New Connecticut came to the Yale University Library as part of the Goodrich Family Collection. The former patent commissioner&#x27;s papers today make up the Henry Leavitt Ellsworth Papers at Yale&#x27;s Sterling Library.
Annie Goodrich Ellsworth, only daughter of Henry Leavitt Ellsworth, married the publisher Roswell Smith, who with his partner Josiah Gilbert Holland founded, in partnership with the publishing house Charles Scribner &amp; Co., &quot;Scribner&#x27;s Monthly&quot; and &quot;St. Nicholas&quot; magazines. Later Smith founded the publishing house The Century Company, and assumed sole ownership of both magazines. He changed the name of &quot;Scribner&#x27;s Monthly&quot; to &quot;The Century&quot;. His wife, the former Anna G. Ellsworth, dictated the inaugural message on Samuel F. B. Morse&#x27;s new telegraph system. &quot;What hath God wrought&quot; read the message, suggested by her mother, the wife of Morse&#x27;s great champion Henry Leavitt Ellsworth. The daughter of Roswell Smith and Anna G. Leavitt married the American artist landscape painter George Inness, Jr.

<text>Robert Fred Ellsworth (June 11, 1926 – May 9, 2011) was an American legislator and diplomat. He served as the United States Permanent Representative to NATO (an ambassadorial-level appointment) between 1969 and 1971. He had previously served three terms as a Republican Member of Congress from Kansas, from 1961 to 1967, and as an Assistant to the President during the presidency of Richard Nixon; under President Gerald Ford, he was Deputy Secretary of Defense. Ellsworth also served as assistant to the chairman of the Federal Maritime Commission.

== Life and career ==
Ellsworth was born in Lawrence, Kansas, and was educated in the public schools of that city. He served in the United States Navy during World War II and the Korean War. In 1945, he was graduated with a baccalaureate in engineering from the University of Kansas, where he had been a member of the Alpha Nu chapter of the Beta Theta Pi collegiate fraternity. He then studied law at the University of Michigan Law School, from which he was graduated in 1949; he practiced law in Lawrence, Kansas, and in Springfield, Massachusetts.

The retired ambassador was admitted to the Order of Saint John as a knight of honor in 1995.

While serving as a congressman for , Ellsworth voted present for the 24th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. However, during his tenure as representative for , Ellsworth voted in favor of the Civil Rights Acts of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965.

On November 9, 2010, Ellsworth provided commentary to KFMB regarding an unexplained vapor trail in the airspace off the coast of Los Angeles which, at the time, was widely speculated to be a missile launch. He cautioned the news crew to wait for definitive answers from the military, then went on to theorize: &quot;It could be a test firing of an intercontinental ballistic missile from a submarine, an underwater submarine, to demonstrate, mainly to Asia, that we could do that.&quot;

Ellsworth died in Encinitas, California: near the small city of Solana Beach, where he had founded and directed a research firm, Hamilton BioVentures.

<doc id="779295" wikidata="Q1391355" url="?curid=779295" title="Mischa Elman">
<text>Mischa (Mikhail Saulovich) Elman (; January 20, 1891April 5, 1967) was a Russian-American violinist famed for his passionate style, beautiful tone, and impeccable artistry and musicality.

==Early life ==
Moses or Moishe Elman was born to a Jewish family in Talnoye, Umansky Uyezd, Kiev Governorate, Russian Empire (today Talne, Ukraine).

His grandfather Yosele Elman was a klezmer, a Jewish professional traditional musician who played the violin, and his father Saul Iosipovich Elman was a melamed and amateur violinist. It became apparent when Mischa was very young that he had perfect pitch, but his father hesitated about a career as a musician, since musicians were not very high on the social scale. He finally gave in, and gave Mischa a miniature violin, on which he soon learned several tunes by himself. Soon thereafter, he was taken to Odessa, where he studied at the Imperial Academy of Music. Pablo de Sarasate gave him a recommendation, stating that he could become one of the great talents of Europe. He auditioned for Leopold Auer at the age of 11, playing the Wieniawski Concerto No. 2 and 24th Caprice by Paganini. Auer was so impressed that he had Elman admitted to the St. Petersburg Conservatory.

Elman was still only a boy when Auer arranged for him to play with the famous Colonne Orchestra during their visit to Pavlovsk. Knowing Édouard Colonne&#x27;s hatred of child prodigies, Auer did not tell him Elman&#x27;s age when making the arrangements, and not until the famous conductor saw young Mischa waiting to go on the platform did he realize that he had engaged a child. He was furious, and flatly refused to continue with the programme. Frantic attempts were made to assure him that Elman had the recommendation of Auer himself and was well capable of doing justice to the music, but Colonne was adamant, &quot;I have never yet played with a child, and I refuse to start now&quot;, he retorted. So Elman had to play with piano accompaniment while conductor and orchestra sat listening.&quot; According to Elman: &quot;I was eleven at the time. When Colonne saw me, violin in hand, ready to step on the stage, he drew himself up and said with emphasis: &#x27;I play with a prodigy! Never!&#x27; Nothing could move him, and I had to play to a piano accompaniment. After he had heard me play, though, he came over to me and said: &#x27;The best apology I can make for what I said is to ask you to do me the honor of playing with the Orchestre Colonne in Paris.&#x27; He was as good as his word. Four months later I went to Paris and played the Mendelssohn concerto for him with great success.&quot;

== Career ==
In 1903, Elman began to play concerts in the homes of wealthy patrons of the arts, and he made his Berlin debut in 1904, creating a great sensation. His London debut in 1905 included the British premiere of Alexander Glazunov&#x27;s Violin Concerto in A minor. He played in Carnegie Hall in 1908, making a great impression on his American audience. He toured Australia in the summer of 1914. After the outbreak of World War I in Europe, Elman returned to the United States and was joined by his family in October 1914.
In 1917, he was elected to honorary membership in the Phi Mu Alpha Sinfonia music fraternity. Mischa became a U.S. citizen in 1923.

He sometimes performed in as many as 107 concerts in a 29-week season.

In 1943, he gave the premiere of Bohuslav Martinů&#x27;s second concerto, which was written for him.

Sales of Mischa&#x27;s records exceeded two million.

A frequent accompanist in chamber works during Elman&#x27;s early American career was Emmanuel Bay, who was born on exactly the same day as Elman, January 20, 1891. But Elman also performed and recorded with Josef Bonime, Carroll Hollister, Wolfgang Rosé and others, and from 1950, his steady accompanist and recital partner was Joseph Seiger.

He also briefly performed and made recordings with the Mischa Elman String Quartet.
Elman died in his apartment on April 5, 1967, in Manhattan, New York City, a few hours after completing a rehearsal with Seiger. He is buried in the Westchester Hills Cemetery in Hastings-on-Hudson, New York.

==Legacy==
Elman&#x27;s recorded legacy spanned more than six decades. His first 78 rpm discs were made for Pathé, in Paris, in 1906; his final LP sessions were for Vanguard, in New York, in 1967.

The greater part of his discography was recorded for the Victor Talking Machine Company/RCA Victor, with whom he had an exclusive relationship through 1950. Thereafter, he recorded for Decca/London and later the Vanguard label. Regrettably, Elman&#x27;s discs have never been reissued on CD in a systematic manner (whereas almost every recording which his contemporary Jascha Heifetz made has been readily available on CD for years).

<text>Gabriel Arkadyevich Ureklyan (; ; 15 December 1899 – 30 June 1945), better known as El-Registan (), was a Soviet Armenian poet best known for having co-written the lyrics to the State Anthem of the Soviet Union along with Sergey Mikhalkov.

==Biography==
He was born into an Armenian banker&#x27;s family in Samarkand, in the Samarkand Oblast of the Russian Empire (present-day Uzbekistan). His father, Arshak (Russified to Arkadi) Ureklyan, fled to Tiflis from Ottoman-ruled Armenia in 1890s due to the Hamidian Massacres, and subsequently moved to Samarkand. He took the Bolshevik side during the Russian Civil War and the subsequent Soviet takeover of Central Asia. Embarking on a career as a reporter and writer, he adopted the nickname El-Registan, which was composed of a part of his first name and the Samarkand&#x27;s most famous landmark, Registan. He worked in several prominent Central Asian newspapers, including &quot;Pravda Vostoka&quot; in Tashkent. He achieved prominence as a talented reporter and was invited to move to Moscow to work for the &quot;Izvestia&quot;. From there, he covered the massive Soviet construction and heavy industry-building campaigns and became a prominent propagandist, such as the White Sea – Baltic Canal, Uralmash, etc. He also wrote movie scripts and radio plays, and El-Registan is perhaps better known for his script of the Soviet film &quot;Djulbars&quot; (1935). Composer Asya Sultanova set some of his work to music.

After the Nazi invasion of the Soviet Union in June 1941, El-Registan became a special war correspondent, frequently traveling to front lines. He attracted the attention of Joseph Stalin, and when he submitted his draft of the new Soviet anthem, written in collaboration with Sergey Mikhalkov, Stalin personally chose the draft and instructed the authors on the changes to be made. Eventually, it was adopted as the National Anthem of the Soviet Union in 1944.

He was married to Valentina Galanina, an actress in Moscow. El-Registan died in Moscow on 30 June 1945 and is buried in the Novodevichye Cemetery.

<text>The Power of One is a novel by South African born, Australian author Bryce Courtenay, first published in 1989. Set in South Africa during the 1930s and 1940s, it tells the story of an English boy, who through the course of the story, acquires the name of Peekay. In the film version, the protagonist&#x27;s given name is Peter Phillip Kenneth Keith. The author identifies &quot;Peekay&quot; as a reference to his earlier nickname &quot;Piskop&quot;: Afrikaans for &quot;Pisshead.&quot;)

It is written from the first person perspective, with Peekay narrating (as an adult, looking back) and trusting the reader with his thoughts and feelings, as opposed to a detailed description of places and account of actions.

A film adaptation was released in 1992.

==Plot summary==
&quot;The Power of One&quot; follows an English-speaking South African boy named Peekay from 1939 to 1951. The story begins when Peekay&#x27;s mother has a nervous breakdown, and Peekay ends up being raised by a Zulu wet nurse, Mary Mandoma, who eventually becomes his nanny. At a young age, Peekay is sent to a boarding school. As the youngest student attending the school, he is frequently harassed. The students call him &quot;Piskop&quot; (meaning &quot;piss-head&quot;) and &quot;rooinek&quot; (&quot;redneck&quot;—a name given to the British soldiers during the Second Boer War) as a result of the helmets and short hair cuts leaving their necks exposed, resulting in severe sunburn, among other names. This continues with an older boy, the Judge, and his partners who further punish him for his frequent bedwetting with verbal and physical abuse. The Judge is a Nazi sympathizer, and he has a hatred for the English, proclaiming that Hitler will march the English out to sea. The Afrikaans woman who runs the boarding school does not console him and walks around threateningly with a whip.

When Peekay returns home after his first year at the boarding school, his nanny calls a medicine man called Inkosi-Inkosikazi to cure his bedwetting. Inkosi-Inkosikazi not only succeeds, but also leads Peekay&#x27;s mind to a place where there are three waterfalls and ten stepping stones, where Peekay can always &quot;find&quot; him. The next school year, Peekay returns with a magic chicken of Inkosi-Inkosikazi&#x27;s and a different paradigm, called &quot;the power of one&quot;. Peekay is excellent in his studies, but maintains a camouflage to hide it from his fellow students and teachers. He finds that this is a good way to beat the system and avoid unnecessary abuse. As the punishments from the Judge continue to get worse, Peekay ends up doing the Judge&#x27;s math homework. At the end of the year, the Judge forces Peekay to eat feces, and kills his beloved chicken. He looks forward to arriving home to his nanny, but has been informed there has been a change in plans. He will be travelling to a town called Barberton, where he will meet his grandfather.

On the train ride to Barberton, Peekay meets Hoppie Groenwald, who shows Peekay his boxing gloves. Hoppie is a boxing champion, and he invites Peekay to watch him box during a stop in the ride. It is there that Peekay is inspired to be the welterweight champion of the world. Hoppie teaches Peekay the phrase &quot;First with your head, then with the heart,&quot; a phrase which Peekay commits to memory. At Barberton, Peekay sees his mother again. She has returned from the mental institution and converted to being a born again Christian. He learns that his mother had left his nanny because she refused to convert. His mother also tries to convert him, but he tells his mother that the Lord is a &quot;shithead.&quot; Retreating to the hills behind his home, Peekay meets a German professor, Karl von Vollensteen, whom Peekay calls &quot;Doc.&quot; Doc is a music professor and botanist who collects cacti and has his own cactus garden. Doc and Peekay become close friends, and he offers Peekay piano lessons. When World War II breaks out, Doc is taken into the Barberton prison for being an unregistered alien. Peekay visits him every day for piano lessons, and attends the prison&#x27;s boxing squad. A prisoner with whom Peekay becomes friends, Geel Piet, teaches him to box, and Peekay leads the team to a victory. Later, Peekay develops great sympathy for the prisoners and arranges Doc and Geel Piet a letter-writing service and a tobacco distribution service. This makes Peekay very famous among the prisoners, and they call him the great chief &quot;Tadpole Angel&quot; (a reference to Doc being the &quot;Frog&quot; for his nightly piano playing). One of the warders discovers that some suspicious activity has been going on, and one night, Geel Piet is murdered in the gym.

The war ends, and Doc finds himself free again. Ms. Boxhall, the local librarian, and a Jewish schoolteacher, Miss Bornstein, work with Doc to further encourage the blossoming of Peekay&#x27;s intellect with activities such as science, literature and chess. He passes his Royal College of Music exams and earns the title of best under-twelve boxer in the region. With the help of his guides, Peekay is accepted into the prestigious Prince of Wales school in Johannesburg.

At the Prince of Wales, Peekay partners with the son of a Jewish millionaire, Hymie (Morrie in American versions) Levy. They pull off many &quot;scams&quot; to earn money and Peekay joins the school&#x27;s failing boxing team. Hymie becomes Peekay&#x27;s manager and they pull off the school&#x27;s first win in many years. Peekay starts boxing lessons with South Africa&#x27;s famous Solly Goldman. He then faces Gideon Mandoma, the son of his beloved Nanny, and defeats him, cementing the title of &quot;great chief&quot;. Peekay grows to be a stranger to failure, excelling at academics, boxing and rugby. Near the end of his last year of school, he must face the death of Doc and not earning a Rhodes scholarship, therefore missing his chance to join Hymie at Oxford to study law.

As a result, Peekay takes a year off of boxing and academics and goes to work in Northern Rhodesia&#x27;s copper mines to &quot;find himself&quot; and build up the muscle to become a welterweight. He takes on the dangerous work of a &quot;grizzly man&quot; as required by all new miners, but continues on to earn double wages, thereby saving enough to attend Oxford. At the mines, he meets a Georgian called Rasputin and they become close friends. When Peekay has an accident in his shaft, Rasputin saves Peekay, but gives his own life up instead. Rasputin names Peekay as his beneficiary; that and his own insurance payout gives him enough to be able to attend Oxford. One night before Peekay leaves the mining camp, Peekay meets his old nemesis, the Judge, in a bar at the mines. The Judge is in an insane rage due to handling mine explosives and tries to kill Peekay. A fight ensues and Peekay puts all he has learned in his life to destroy the Judge. After defeating the Judge, Peekay carves a Union Jack and the initials &quot;PK&quot; over the Swastika on the Judge&#x27;s arm. He then walks into the night.

<text>Dean Jagger (November 7, 1903 – February 5, 1991) was an American film, stage, and television actor who won the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor for his role in Henry King&#x27;s &quot;Twelve O&#x27;Clock High&quot; (1949).

==Early life==
Dean Jeffries Jagger (or Dean Ida Jagger) was born in Columbus Grove or Lima, Ohio. Growing up on a farm, he wanted to act, and practiced oratory on cows while working. He later won several oratory competitions. At age 14, he worked as an orderly at a sanatorium.

He dropped out of school several times before finally attending Wabash College. While there he was a member of Lambda Chi Alpha fraternity and played football. He dropped out in his second year, realizing he was not suited to an academic life.

At age 17, he taught all eight grades in a rural elementary school, before heading to Chicago. He studied at the Conservatory of Drama with Elias Day, and through him got a job on the Chautauqua circuit.

==Career==
===Early stage appearances===
Jagger studied acting at Chicago&#x27;s Lyceum Arts Conservatory. He eventually played Young Matt in a production of &quot;Shepherd of the Hills&quot; on stage in Chicago. This experience resulted in him deciding to try his luck in New York City.

He joined a stock company as Spencer Tracy&#x27;s replacement. He performed in vaudeville, on the radio and on stage, making his Broadway debut in 1925 in a bit part in a George M. Cohan production. 
He was in a play &quot;Remote Control&quot; in 1928.

===Early films===
Jagger visited Los Angeles on a vaudeville show with Irene Rich. While there, he made his film debut in &quot;The Woman from Hell&quot; (1929) with Mary Astor. &quot;My good notices,&quot; he later recalled, &quot;had a reverse effect on the industry, which was suddenly revolutionized by sound pictures. With the one film to my credit, I was considered part of that group of untouchables – silent film stars.&quot; He followed it with &quot;Handcuffed&quot; (1929).

Jagger decided to move into film production, helping raise money to make a feature that ultimately never was released. He returned to New York City.

===&quot;Tobacco Road&quot;===
Jagger&#x27;s big career break came when cast in a lead role in the play &quot;Tobacco Road&quot; in 1933. The play was a huge hit and ran until 1941, though Jagger left the show in 1934 to appear in &quot;They Shall Not Die&quot;, which only ran 62 performances.

===Hollywood===
In April 1934, Jagger signed a contract with Paramount, for which he made &quot;You Belong to Me&quot; (1934) with Lee Tracy, then &quot;College Rhythm&quot; (1934) with Jack Oakie, &quot;Behold My Wife!&quot; (1934) with Sylvia Sidney, &quot;Wings in the Dark&quot; (1935) with Myrna Loy and Cary Grant, &quot;Home on the Range&quot; (1935) with Jackie Coogan, Randolph Scott and Evelyn Brent, &quot;Car 99&quot; (1935) with Fred MacMurray and Ann Sheridan, &quot;People Will Talk&quot; (1935) with Charlie Ruggles, and &quot;Men Without Names&quot; (1935) with Fred MacMurray. Paramount gave him a lead role in the B Western &quot;Wanderer of the Wasteland&quot; (1935). He was back in supporting parts in &quot;It&#x27;s a Great Life&quot; (1935), &quot;Woman Trap&quot; (1936), and &quot;13 Hours by Air&quot; (1936).

Victor Halperin borrowed him to play the lead role in &quot;Revolt of the Zombies&quot; (1936). He went to 20th Century Fox for &quot;Pepper&quot; (1936) and &quot;Star for a Night&quot; (1936), then to MGM for &quot;Under Cover of Night&quot; (1937).
Jagger did &quot;Woman in Distress&quot; (1937) at Columbia, and &quot;Dangerous Number&quot; (1937) and &quot;Song of the City&quot; (1937) at MGM.

Jagger appeared in Republic Pictures&#x27; &quot;Escape by Night&quot; (1937) and &quot;Exiled to Shanghai&quot; (1937).

Jagger played &quot;Michael Drops In&quot; in summer stock and returned to Broadway to star in &quot;Missouri Legend&quot; (1938), which ran 48 performances. He was also in short runs for &quot;Everywhere I Roam&quot; (1938–39), &quot;Brown Danube&quot; (1939), &quot;Farm of Three Echoes&quot; (1939–40) with Ethel Barrymore, and &quot;Unconquered&quot; (1940) by Ayn Rand.

===&quot;Brigham Young&quot;===
Jagger made his breakthrough with his portrayal of Mormon leader Brigham Young in &quot;Brigham Young&quot; (1940) at 20th Century Fox, alongside Tyrone Power for director Henry Hathaway. He was cast on the basis of his performance in &quot;Missouri Legend&quot;. According to George D. Pyper, a technical consultant on the film who had personally known Brigham Young, Jagger not only resembled Young, but he also spoke like him and had many of his mannerisms. Thirty-two years later, in 1972 he was baptized a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.

Fox signed him to a long-term contract and put him in &quot;Western Union&quot; (1941) for Fritz Lang. He was announced for the Biblical film &quot;The Great Commandment&quot; and a biopic of Lewis and Clark with Randolph Scott, but neither was made.

Instead, Jagger appeared in &quot;The Men in Her Life&quot; (1941) for Columbia, &quot;Valley of the Sun&quot; (1942) at RKO, and &quot;The Omaha Trail&quot; (1942) at MGM.

===King Brothers===
Jagger had a rare lead role in &quot;I Escaped from the Gestapo&quot; (1943) for the King Brothers, then went back to supporting roles for &quot;The North Star&quot; (1943) for Sam Goldwyn. The King Brothers gave him top billing again with &quot;When Strangers Marry&quot; (1944). Jagger acted in &quot;Alaska&quot; (1944) at Monogram, which was distributed to King films.

Jagger went to England to appear in &quot;I Live in Grosvenor Square&quot; (1945) with Anna Neagle and Rex Harrison. He had good roles in &quot;Sister Kenny&quot; (1946) with Rosalind Russell and &quot;Pursued&quot; (1947) with Robert Mitchum.

He did &quot;Driftwood&quot; (1947) for Republic and started appearing on TV shows such as &quot;The Philco-Goodyear Television Playhouse&quot;, &quot;Studio One&quot;, and &quot;The Chevrolet Tele-Theatre&quot;.

Jagger returned to Broadway for &quot;Dr. Social&quot; (1948), but it had a short run. He had the lead role in &quot;&#x27;C&#x27;-Man&quot; (1949).

===&quot;Twelve O&#x27;Clock High&quot; and 1950s===
Jagger received an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor for his role in &quot;Twelve O&#x27;Clock High&quot; (1949), made at Fox and directed by Henry King. In the film, he played the World War II veteran, middle-aged adjutant Major/Lt. Col. Harvey Stovall, who acts as an advisor to the commander, General Savage (Gregory Peck).

Jagger stayed a supporting actor, though, appearing in &quot;Sierra&quot; (1950) with Audie Murphy at Universal, &quot;Dark City&quot; (1950) for Hal Wallis, &quot;Rawhide&quot; (1951) with Hathaway and Power at Fox, and &quot;Warpath&quot; (1951) at Paramount with Edmond O&#x27;Brien and directed by Byron Haskin.

Jagger had a lead role in the strongly anti-communist film &quot;My Son John&quot; (1952) at Paramount. He was in &quot;Denver and Rio Grande&quot; (1952), again with Haskin and O&#x27;Brien, and episodes of &quot;Gulf Playhouse&quot;, &quot;Lux Video Theatre&quot;, &quot;Cavalcade of America&quot;, &quot;Schlitz Playhouse&quot;, and &quot;Studio 57&quot;.

He appeared in the biblical epic &quot;The Robe&quot; (1953) as the weaver Justus of Cana, and was in &quot;Private Hell 36&quot; (1954).

He played retired Army Major General Tom Waverly honored by Bob Wallace (Bing Crosby) and Phil Davis (Danny Kaye) in the musical &quot;White Christmas&quot; (1954), and an impotent local sheriff in the modern Western &quot;Bad Day at Black Rock&quot; (1955), starring Spencer Tracy for MGM. He was also in &quot;The Eternal Sea&quot; (1955) at Republic, &quot;It&#x27;s a Dog&#x27;s Life&quot; (1955) at MGM, &quot;On the Threshold of Space&quot; (1956) at Fox, and &quot;Red Sundown&quot; (1956) at Universal.

For the 1956 British science-fiction film &quot;X the Unknown&quot;, Jagger refused to work with director Joseph Losey because Losey was on the Hollywood blacklist. Losey came off the project after a few days of shooting and was replaced by Leslie Norman. An alternative version is that Losey was replaced due to illness. Half the budget, $30,000, went to Jagger&#x27;s fee.

Jagger was in &quot;The 20th Century Fox Hour&quot;, &quot;Three Brave Men&quot; (1956), &quot;The Great Man&quot; (1956) (second-billed to José Ferrer), &quot;Zane Grey Theatre&quot;, &quot;Bernadine&quot; (1957) with Pat Boone, an episode of &quot;Playhouse 90&quot;, &quot;Forty Guns&quot; (1957) for Sam Fuller, and &quot;The Proud Rebel&quot; (1958) with Alan Ladd and directed by Michael Curtiz.

Jagger also portrayed the father of Elvis Presley&#x27;s character in 1958&#x27;s &quot;King Creole&quot;, directed by Curtiz.

Jagger was in &quot;The Nun&#x27;s Story&quot; (1959), playing the father of Audrey Hepburn&#x27;s character, and &quot;Cash McCall&quot; (1960), and played the traveling manager for an evangelist played by Jean Simmons in the acclaimed 1960 drama &quot;Elmer Gantry&quot;. He was in two failed pilots, including &quot;The House on K Street&quot;.

In the 1960s, Jagger increasingly worked on television appearing in &quot;The Twilight Zone&quot; (&quot;Static&quot;), &quot;NBC Sunday Showcase&quot;, &quot;Our American Heritage&quot;, &quot;General Electric Theater&quot;, &quot;Dr. Kildare&quot;, &quot;The Christophers&quot;, &quot;The Alfred Hitchcock Hour&quot;, and &quot;The Partridge Family&quot;. He also appeared in the films &quot;Parrish&quot; (1961), &quot;The Honeymoon Machine&quot; (1961) and &quot;Billy Rose&#x27;s Jumbo&quot; (1962).

===&quot;Mr. Novak&quot;===

Jagger achieved success with the television series &quot;Mr. Novak&quot; (1963–1965), receiving Emmy Award nominations for his role in 1964 and 1965, as well as the California Teachers Association&#x27;s Communications Award, along with star James Franciscus, in 1963 for his portrayal of high-school principal Albert Vane. Before he left the show to have a major medical operation, though, he was less than happy with the series, clashing repeatedly with the writers and directors and describing &quot;the Mr. Novak company&quot; afterwards as &quot;a mishmash of unbelievable amateurishness.&quot;

&quot;It is unforgivable how bad TV is today,&quot; he said in 1965. &quot;The people doing it have succumbed to the cliché that there is no time to be good in TV, or that we doing it are lucky to get one good episode out of three. Why?&quot;

Jagger officially left the show in December 1964 because of an ulcer.

Jagger&#x27;s appearances in the 1960s included episodes of &quot;The F.B.I.&quot; and &quot;The Fugitive&quot;, as well as films &quot;First to Fight&quot; (1967), &quot;Firecreek&quot; (1968), &quot;Day of the Evil Gun&quot; (1968), &quot;Smith!&quot; (1968) with Glenn Ford, &quot;The Lonely Profession&quot; (1969), &quot;Tiger by the Tail&quot; (1970), &quot;The Kremlin Letter&quot; (1970), &quot;Men at Law&quot;, &quot;The Brotherhood of the Bell&quot; (1970), again with Ford, and an episode of &quot;The Name of the Game&quot;.

He had a semiregular role on the series &quot;Matt Lincoln&quot; (1970) as the father of the title character, and parts in &quot;Vanishing Point&quot; (1971), &quot;Bonanza&quot;, and &quot;Incident in San Francisco&quot; (1971).
In 1971, Jagger appeared on &quot;The Partridge Family&quot;. He played a prospector named Charlie in the Christmas episode &quot;Don&#x27;t Bring Your Guns to Town, Santa&quot;.

===Later career===
Jagger was in &quot;The Glass House&quot; (1972), &quot;Columbo&quot;, &quot;Kung Fu&quot; (Jagger appeared as Caine&#x27;s grandfather, who wants little to do with him, but starts Caine on his series-long search for his half-brother Danny), &quot;Alias Smith and Jones&quot;, &quot;Medical Center&quot;, &quot;The Stranger&quot; (1973), &quot;The Delphi Bureau&quot;, The Lie (1973), &quot;Shaft&quot;, &quot;I Heard the Owl Call My Name&quot; (1973), &quot;Love Story&quot;, &quot;The Hanged Man&quot; (1974), The Great Lester Boggs (1974), &quot;So Sad About Gloria&quot; (1975), &quot;The Lindbergh Kidnapping Case&quot; (1976), &quot;Harry O&quot;, &quot;Hunter&quot;, &quot;End of the World&quot; (1977), and &quot;Evil Town&quot; (1977).

He played the syndicate boss in &quot;Game of Death&quot; (1978) as the nemesis of Bruce Lee.

Jagger&#x27;s later appearances included &quot;The Waltons&quot;, &quot;Gideon&#x27;s Trumpet&quot; (1980) and &quot;Alligator&quot; (1980).

He won a Daytime Emmy award for a guest appearance in the religious series &quot;This Is the Life&quot;.

His last role was as Dr. David Domedion in the &quot;St. Elsewhere&quot; season-three finale &quot;Cheers&quot; in 1985.

Dean Jagger has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 1523 Vine Street for his contribution to motion pictures.

==Personal life and death==
When Jagger tried to marry his second wife, Gloria Ling, in 1947, they were denied a marriage license in California due to a state law &quot;forbidding unions between Caucasians and Mongolians [sic]&quot;; Ling&#x27;s father had been born in China. Within two days, the couple had flown to Albuquerque, New Mexico, and were married under &quot;New Mexico&#x27;s more liberal statute.&quot;

In later life, Jagger suffered from heart disease. He died in his sleep in Santa Monica, California. He was 87. He was survived by his third wife, Etta, a daughter and two stepsons.

Jagger joined the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints later in his life.

<text>The Hurstbridge line is a commuter railway line in the city of Melbourne, Victoria, Australia. Operated by Metro Trains Melbourne, it is the city&#x27;s seventh longest metropolitan railway line at . The line runs from Flinders Street Station in central Melbourne to Hurstbridge Station in the north-east, serving 28 stations via Clifton Hill, Heidelberg, Macleod, Greensborough, Eltham and Diamond Creek. The line operates for approximately 19 hours a day (from approximately 5:00 am to around 12:00 am) with 24 hour service available on Friday and Saturday nights. During peak hour, headways of up to 15 minutes are operated with services every 20–30 minutes during off-peak hours. Trains on the Hurstbridge Line run with a two three-car formations of X&#x27;Trapolis 100 trainsets.

Sections of the Hurstbridge Line opened as early as 1888, with the line fully extended to Hurstbridge by 1912. The line was built to connect Melbourne with the suburbs of Greensborough, Eltham, and Hurstbridge, amongst others.

Since the 2010s, due to the heavily utilised infrastructure of the Hurstbridge Line, significant improvements and upgrades have been made. An upgrade of the corridor from Heidelberg Station onwards began construction in 2016 and mostly completed by 2023, with improvements including the removal of level crossings, rebuilding stations, and the duplication of more than of track. Other works have included replacing sleepers, upgrading signalling technology, the introduction of new rolling stock, and station accessibility upgrades.

== History ==
=== 19th century ===
The first section of the Hurstbridge Line opened between Victoria Park (then named Collingwood) and Heidelberg in May 1888. At this time, the line was connected to other lines via a line from Royal Park to Clifton Hill, most of which comprised what was later known as the &quot;Inner Circle&quot; line. This connection was opened at the same time.

The section from Flinders Street to Victoria Park, was built later than the rest of the line, which was originally connected to the suburban system via the now-closed Inner Circle railway line. The section to Victoria Park runs through two tunnels under a low ridge just east of the city, but most of the line runs on an embankment that carries the line above numerous main roads and suburban side streets.

=== 20th century ===
A more direct connection, between Princes Bridge and Victoria Park (as Collingwood was renamed at the same time) was opened in October 1901. In June the following year, the line was extended to Eltham, and ten years later (in June 1912) to Hurst&#x27;s Bridge (now Hurstbridge). In 1912, the Mont Park branch line was built branching from Macleod to serve the newly built Mont Park Asylum. Also in 1912, the line between Westgarth and Alphington was duplicated.

In 1919, a branch line opened to the Australian Paper Manufacturers paper mill just after Fairfield. This brought freight traffic into the mill for its 75-year lifespan, before its closure in 1994.

In April 1921, automatic signalling was implemented between Princes Bridge and Clifton Hill Station, and a few months later, the line (from Princes Bridge) was electrified to Heidelberg, followed by electrification to Eltham in April 1923, and Hurstbridge in August 1926. In September 1926, the single-track section between Clifton Hill and Westgarth was converted to Lever Locking and Track Control signalling, followed by Alphington Station to Heidelberg in June 1927.

In June 1949, the line between Ivanhoe and Heidelberg was duplicated and provided with automatic signalling. The same was done to the Alphington to Ivanhoe section in December 1951. Duplication continued between Heidelberg and Macleod in December 1958, except for a short section after Heidelberg Station where the line crosses a bridge then goes through a tunnel. That section remained single tracked until 2018 when it was duplicated as part of the Level Crossing Removal Project at Lower Plenty Road near Rosanna Station.

Macleod to Greensborough was duplicated and converted to automatic signalling in August 1979. The duplication also included a number of level crossing removals and a rebuilt Watsonia. Macleod is the only station on the Hurstbridge Line with more than two platforms. A third platform was provided in the 1970s, and is used during peak periods to provide a place at which trains can originate or terminate.

Weekend services commenced through running to Hurstbridge in April 1985. Previously, weekend services between Eltham and Hurstbridge operated as a shuttle service, with passengers required to change trains at Eltham. Prior to the timetable change, the shuttle service was provided by a double ended motored Tait train, and after their withdrawal in 1984, the shuttle service was provided by a 3 car Hitachi or Comeng train.

=== 21st century ===
In 2009, a short section between Clifton Hill and Westgarth was duplicated, including the construction of a second Merri Creek river crossing at Clifton Hill. The rarely used centre running line at Clifton Hill was also removed at this time. One year later, the Burgundy Street bridge near Heidelberg Station was replaced. This bridge was upgraded again in 2019 as part of the Hurstbridge Line Duplication project.

Since 2017, X&#x27;Trapolis 100 trains began operating on the line, replacing the Comeng train-sets. The new stock features three doors per side on each carriage with the ability to seat 432 passengers in each six-carriage configuration.

== Infrastructure upgrades ==
=== Hurstbridge Line Duplication ===
====Stage 1 (Heidelberg to Rosanna)====
In May 2016, the Victorian Government allocated funding for stage one of the Hurstbridge Line Duplication. The first stage involved:

* Duplicating a section of track between Heidelberg and Rosanna
* The removal of two level crossings at Grange Road, Alphington and Lower Plenty Road, Rosanna
* A newly elevated Rosanna Station
* The construction of a second rail bridge over Burgundy Street in Heidelberg
* The construction of a second tunnel for Flinders Street-bound trains under Darebin Street

Construction was coordinated on the level crossing removals and duplication so both projects would be delivered more efficiently, with fewer disruptions to passengers while work is carried out. Early works on the duplication began in June 2016, with major construction started in March 2017. On 6 October of that year, the former ground Rosanna Station closed for demolition. The 6-week 24/7 major construction blitz began on 16 March 2018 with the closure of the rail corridor to allow construction to ramp up. The new elevated Rosanna Station opened with the duplication of the single-track section completed on 30 April 2018, with 35 new and extended weekly train services between Eltham Station and the city loop introduced on 26 August of that year.

====Stage 2 (Greensborough to Montmorency and Diamond Creek to Wattle Glen)====
In May 2019, a second stage of track duplication was announced. When announced, the second stage originally involved:

* Duplicating of track between Greensborough and Eltham and of track between Diamond Creek and Wattle Glen
* The full reconstruction of Greensborough and Montmorency stations
* The extension of platform 2 at Diamond Creek Station

Under this plan, the heritage listed Eltham Trestle Bridge would be retained as that section of track did not need to be duplicated due to other improvements on the line. However, in June 2021, it was announced that the Greensborough to Eltham duplication was cut back to of track between Greensborough and Montmorency stations. This was to avoid affecting an endangered Eltham copper butterfly habitat near Montmorency Station that was not discovered during prior environmental assessments of the project. The state government opted to cut back the duplication rather than to go through additional lengthy environmental approval processes, while claiming the revised duplication would not reduce the service frequency that was originally promised. The Eltham Trestle Bridge remained unaffected by the revised duplication. The rest of the second stage also proceeded as planned.

Site investigations commenced in 2020, with early works on the corridor started in 2021 and construction kicked off throughout 2022, with a 2-week closure in September of that year seeing the raising of the second Plenty River rail bridge as well as other works. The 6-week 24/7 major construction blitz began on 16 March 2023 with the closure of the rail corridor to allow duplication works to ramp up. The duplication and opening of the new Greensborough and Montmorency stations occurred on 30 April 2023. Other works including landscaping, the construction of car-parking, and other final works all completed in late 2023.

=== Level Crossing Removals ===
Delivered in conjunction with the Hurstbridge Line Duplication project, the Level Crossing Removal Project has announced the removal of 3 level crossings on the line, to be completed in stages from 2018 to 2027. In 2018, 2 level crossings were removed at Grange Road, Alphington and Lower Plenty Road, Rosanna. The crossing at Grange Road in Alphington involved lowering the rail line into a trench under the road, with the rail line being elevated at Lower Plenty Road to create a rail bridge over the road. As part of this removal, Rosanna Station was rebuilt. In the lead up to the 2022 Victorian state election, the incumbent Andrews government announced the construction of a rail bridge to remove the level crossing at Ruthven Street near Macleod Station by 2027. At the end of these removals, the Hurstbridge Line will have 13 remaining crossings on the corridor that aren&#x27;t slated for removal.

== Network and operations ==

=== Services ===
Services on the Hurstbridge line operates from approximately 5:00 am to around 12:00 daily. In general, during peak hours, train frequency is 10–20 minutes in the AM peak on the Hurstbridge line while during non-peak hours the frequency is reduced to 20–30 minutes throughout the entire route. After Eltham, frequencies are reduced due to infrastructure constraints. On Friday nights and weekends, services run 24 hours a day, with 60 minute frequencies available outside of normal operating hours.

Train services on the Hurstbridge line are also subjected to maintenance and renewal works, usually on selected Fridays and Saturdays. Shuttle bus services are provided throughout the duration of works for affected commuters.

==== Stopping patterns ====

=== Operators ===
The Hurstbridge line has had a total of 6 operators since its opening in 1888. The majority of operations throughout its history have been government run: from its first service in 1888 until the 1999 privatisation of Melbourne&#x27;s rail network, four different government operators have run the line. These operators, Victorian Railways, the Metropolitan Transit Authority, the Public Transport Corporation, and Hillside Trains have a combined operational length of 111 years. Hillside Trains was privatised in August 1999 and later rebranded Connex Melbourne. Metro Trains Melbourne, the current private operator, then took over the operations in 2009. Both private operators have had a combined operational period of years.
=== Route ===
The Hurstbridge line forms a highly curved route from Flinders Street railway station in Melbourne CBD to its terminus at Hurstbridge. The route is long and is double track up to Montmorency, with an additional section of double track between Wattle Glen and Diamond Creek; the remainder of the line is single track. The Hurstbridge line traverses both flat and hilly country with large amounts of curves and fairly significant earthworks for large parts of the line. The line uses the Clifton Hill tunnel of the City Loop, and travels through the only other three rail tunnels in Victoria, although none of them are particularly long or deep. Sections of the line have been elevated onto a rail bridge or lowered into a cutting to eliminate level crossings. The line features four of the largest bridges on the suburban network: twin bridges over the Merri Creek running between Clifton Hill and Westgarth station, another on the up side of Darebin station, crossing the Darebin Creek, and the heritage-listed wooden trestle bridge running across the Diamond Creek in Eltham. At in length, this bridge is one of the longest curved wooden trestle bridge in use on a revenue railway in the southern hemisphere, and is the only wooden bridge still in use on a revenue railway in Melbourne. Despite some removals, there are a large number of level crossings still present with no current plans to remove them, including a few private level crossings towards the end of the line.

The line follows the same alignment as the Mernda line up to Clifton Hill. After departing Clifton Hill, the Mernda line heads north with the Hurstbridge line taking a windy alignment heading in an eastern direction. Almost all of the line goes through built-up suburbs, however, the line becomes more peri-urban towards its terminus in Hurstbridge.

=== Stations ===
The line serves 28 stations across of track. The stations are a mix of elevated, lowered, underground, and ground level designs. Underground stations are present only in the City Loop, with the majority of elevated and lowered stations being constructed as part of level crossing removals.


== Infrastructure ==

=== Rolling stock ===

The Hurstbridge line uses X&#x27;Trapolis 100 electric multiple unit (EMU) trains operating in a two three-car configuration, with three doors per side on each carriage and can accommodate of up to 432 seated passengers in each six car configuration. The trains were originally built between 2002 and 2004 as well as between 2009 and 2020 with a total of 212 three-car sets constructed. The trains are shared with 7 other metropolitan train lines and have been in service since 2003.

Alongside the passenger trains, Hurstbridge line tracks and equipment are maintained by a fleet of engineering trains. The four types of engineering trains are: the shunting train; designed for moving trains along non-electrified corridors and for transporting other maintenance locomotives, for track evaluation; designed for evaluating track and its condition, the overhead inspection train; designed for overhead wiring inspection, and the infrastructure evaluation carriage designed for general infrastructure evaluation. Most of these trains are repurposed locomotives previously used by V/Line, Metro Trains, and the Southern Shorthaul Railroad.

=== Accessibility ===

In compliance with the Disability Discrimination Act of 1992, all stations that are new-built or rebuilt are fully accessible and comply with these guidelines. Just over half of the stations on the corridor are fully accessible, however, there are some stations that haven&#x27;t been upgraded to meet these guidelines. These stations do feature ramps, however, they have a gradient greater than 1 in 14. Stations that are fully accessible feature ramps that have a gradient less than 1 in 14, have at-grade paths, or feature lifts. These stations typically also feature tactile boarding indicators, independent boarding ramps, wheelchair accessible myki barriers, hearing loops, and widened paths.

Projects improving station accessibility have included the Level Crossing Removal Project, which involves station rebuilds and upgrades, and individual station upgrade projects. These works have made significant strides in improving network accessibility, with more than 61% of Hurstbridge line stations classed as fully accessible. Future station upgrade projects will continue to increase the number of fully accessible stations overtime.

=== Signalling ===
The Hurstbridge line uses three position signalling which is widely used across the Melbourne train network. Three position signalling was first introduced on the line in 1921, with the final section of the line converted to the new type of signalling in 2013. Until early 2013, the Hurstbridge line was the last electrified railway in Melbourne to use a token system of safeworking. The Greensborough to Eltham section was controlled by the miniature electric staff system, and Eltham to Hurstbridge section by the staff and ticket system. If required, the latter section could be divided into two at Diamond Creek, to allow trains to cross at that station. In conjunction with these systems, trains through Greensborough, Eltham, and Hurstbridge stations continued to be controlled by some semaphore signals. In the first few months of 2013, the staff systems and semaphore signals were replaced by electronic three-position coloured light signalling, controlled remotely from Epping. The Greensborough-Diamond Creek section was converted on 3 February 2013, and the Diamond Creek-Hurstbridge section was converted on 22 March 2013.

<text>Abraham Elzevir (4 April 1592 — 14 August 1652) was a Dutch printer. Elzevir was born and died in Leiden. He inherited the House of Elzevir from his grandfather Louis Elzevir and his uncle Bonaventure Elzevir. In its best years it was reputedly the largest publishing business in the world, with branches in numerous European cities.

Abraham and Bonaventure launched a bestselling series of books called &quot;the Republics.&quot; Published in Latin between 1626 and 1629, each work in the series gave information on the geography, inhabitants, economy, and history of a particular country in Europe, Asia, Africa, or the Near East. The Republics are often considered the forerunner to the modern travel guide.

<doc id="779319" wikidata="Q215643" url="?curid=779319" title="Indo-Greek Kingdom">
<text>The Indo-Greek Kingdom, also known as the Yavana Kingdom, was a Hellenistic-era Greek kingdom covering various parts of modern-day Afghanistan, Pakistan and northwestern India. 

The term &quot;Indo-Greek Kingdom&quot; loosely describes a number of various Hellenistic states, ruling from regional capitals like Taxila, Sagala, Pushkalavati, and Alexandria in the Caucasus (now Bagram). Other centers are only hinted at; e.g. Ptolemy&#x27;s &quot;Geographia&quot; and the nomenclature of later kings suggest that a certain Theophilus in the south of the Indo-Greek sphere of influence may also have had a royal seat there at one time. 

The kingdom was founded when the Graeco-Bactrian king Demetrius I of Bactria invaded India from Bactria in about 200 BC. The Greeks to the east of the Seleucid Empire were eventually divided to the Graeco-Bactrian Kingdom and the Indo-Greek Kingdoms in the North Western Indian Subcontinent.

During the two centuries of their rule, the Indo-Greek kings combined the Greek and Indian languages and symbols, as seen on their coins, and blended Greek and Indian ideas, as seen in the archaeological remains. The diffusion of Indo-Greek culture had consequences which are still felt today, particularly through the influence of Greco-Buddhist art. The ethnicity of the Indo-Greek may also have been hybrid to some degree. Euthydemus I was, according to Polybius, a Magnesian Greek. His son, Demetrius I, founder of the Indo-Greek kingdom, was therefore of Greek ethnicity at least by his father. A marriage treaty was arranged for the same Demetrius with a daughter of the Seleucid ruler Antiochus III. The ethnicity of later Indo-Greek rulers is sometimes less clear. For example, Artemidoros (80 BC) was supposed to have been of Indo-Scythian descent, although he is now seen as a regular Indo-Greek king. 

Menander I, being the most well known amongst the Indo-Greek kings, is often referred to simply as &quot;Menander,&quot; despite the fact that there was indeed another Indo-Greek King known as Menander II. Menander I&#x27;s capital was at Sagala in the Punjab (present-day Sialkot). Following the death of Menander, most of his empire splintered and Indo-Greek influence was considerably reduced. Many new kingdoms and republics east of the Ravi River began to mint new coinage depicting military victories. The most prominent entities to form were the Yaudheya Republic, Arjunayanas, and the Audumbaras. The Yaudheyas and Arjunayanas both are said to have won &quot;victory by the sword&quot;. The Datta dynasty and Mitra dynasty soon followed in Mathura.

The Indo-Greeks ultimately disappeared as a political entity around 10 AD following the invasions of the Indo-Scythians, although pockets of Greek populations probably remained for several centuries longer under the subsequent rule of the Indo-Parthians, the Kushans, and the Indo-Scythians, whose Western Satraps state lingered on encompassing local Greeks, up to 415 CE.

==Background==

===Initial Greek presence in the Indian subcontinent===
Greeks first began to settle the Northwestern part of the Indian subcontinent during the time of the Persian Achaemenid empire. Darius the Great conquered the area, but along with his successors also conquered much of the Greek world, which at the time included all of the western Anatolian peninsula. When Greek villages rebelled under the Persian yoke, they were sometimes ethnically cleansed, by relocation to the far side of the empire. Thus there came to be many Greek communities in the Indian parts of the Persian empire.

In the fourth century BC, Alexander the Great defeated and conquered the Persian empire. In 326 BC, this included the northwestern part of the Indian subcontinent as far as the Hyphasis River. Alexander established satrapies and founded several settlements, including Bucephala; he turned south when his troops refused to go further east. The Indian satrapies of the Punjab were left to the rule of Porus and Taxiles, who were confirmed again at the Treaty of Triparadisus in 321 BC, and the remaining Greek troops in these satrapies were left under the command of Alexander&#x27;s general Eudemus. After 321 BC Eudemus toppled Taxiles, until he left India in 316 BC. To the south, another general also ruled over the Greek colonies of the Indus: Peithon, son of Agenor, until his departure for Babylon in 316 BC.

Around 322 BC, the Greeks (described as Yona or Yavana in Indian sources) may then have participated, together with other groups, in the uprising of Chandragupta Maurya against the Nanda dynasty, and gone as far as Pataliputra for the capture of the city from the Nandas. The Mudrarakshasa of Visakhadutta as well as the Jaina work Parisishtaparvan talk of Chandragupta&#x27;s alliance with the Himalayan king Parvatka, often identified with Porus, and according to these accounts, this alliance gave Chandragupta a composite and powerful army made up of Yavanas (Greeks), Kambojas, Shakas (Scythians), Kiratas (Nepalese), Parasikas (Persians) and Bahlikas (Bactrians) who took Pataliputra.

In 305 BC, Seleucus I led an army to the Indus, where he encountered Chandragupta. The confrontation ended with a peace treaty, and &quot;an intermarriage agreement&quot; (Epigamia, Greek: Ἐπιγαμία), meaning either a dynastic marriage or an agreement for intermarriage between Indians and Greeks. Accordingly, Seleucus ceded his eastern territories to Chandragupta, possibly as far as Arachosia and received 500 war elephants (which played a key role in Seleucus&#x27;s victory at the Battle of Ipsus):

The details of the marriage agreement are not known, but since the extensive sources available on Seleucus never mention an Indian princess, it is thought that the marital alliance went the other way, with Chandragupta himself or his son Bindusara marrying a Seleucid princess, in accordance with contemporary Greek practices to form dynastic alliances. An Indian Puranic source, the Pratisarga Parva of the Bhavishya Purana, described the marriage of Chandragupta with a Greek (&quot;Yavana&quot;) princess, daughter of Seleucus, before accurately detailing early Mauryan genealogy:

Chandragupta, however, followed Jainism until the end of his life. He got in his court for marriage the daughter of Seleucus Nicator, and thus, he mixed the Indians and the Greeks. His grandson Ashoka, as Woodcock and other scholars have suggested, &quot;may in fact have been half or at least a quarter Greek.&quot;

Also several Greeks, such as the historian Megasthenes, followed by Deimachus and Dionysius, were sent to reside at the Mauryan court. Presents continued to be exchanged between the two rulers. The intensity of these contacts is testified by the existence of a dedicated Mauryan state department for Greek (Yavana) and Persian foreigners, or the remains of Hellenistic pottery that can be found throughout northern India.

On these occasions, Greek populations apparently remained in the northwest of the Indian subcontinent under Mauryan rule. Chandragupta&#x27;s grandson Ashoka, who had converted to the Buddhist faith declared in the Edicts of Ashoka, set in stone, some of them written in Greek, that Greek populations within his realm also had converted to Buddhism:
In his edicts, Ashoka mentions that he had sent Buddhist emissaries to Greek rulers as far as the Mediterranean (Edict No. 13), and that he developed herbal medicine in their territories, for the welfare of humans and animals (Edict No. 2).
The Greeks in India even seem to have played an active role in the propagation of Buddhism, as some of the emissaries of Ashoka such as Dharmaraksita, or the teacher Mahadharmaraksita, are described in Pali sources as leading Greek (&quot;Yona&quot;, i.e., Ionian) Buddhist monks, active in Buddhist proselytism (the Mahavamsa, XII). It is also thought that Greeks contributed to the sculptural work of the Pillars of Ashoka, and more generally to the blossoming of Mauryan art. Some Greeks (Yavanas) may have played an administrative role in the territories ruled by Ashoka: the Junagadh rock inscription of Rudradaman records that during the rule of Ashoka, a Yavana King/ Governor named Tushaspha was in charge in the area of Girnar, Gujarat, mentioning his role in the construction of a water reservoir.

Again in 206 BC, the Seleucid emperor Antiochus led an army to the Kabul valley, where he received war elephants and presents from the local king Sophagasenus:
===Greek rule in Bactria===
Alexander had also established several colonies in neighbouring Bactria, such as Alexandria on the Oxus (modern Ai-Khanoum) and Alexandria of the Caucasus (medieval Kapisa, modern Bagram). After Alexander&#x27;s death in 323 BC, Bactria came under the control of Seleucus I Nicator, who founded the Seleucid Empire. The Greco-Bactrian Kingdom was founded when Diodotus I, the satrap of Bactria (and probably the surrounding provinces) seceded from the Seleucid Empire around 250 BC. The preserved ancient sources (see below) are somewhat contradictory and the exact date of Bactrian independence has not been settled. Somewhat simplified, there is a high chronology (c. 255 BC) and a low chronology (c. 246 BC) for Diodotos&#x27; secession. The high chronology has the advantage of explaining why the Seleucid king Antiochus II issued very few coins in Bactria, as Diodotos would have become independent there early in Antiochus&#x27; reign. On the other hand, the low chronology, from the mid-240s BC, has the advantage of connecting the secession of Diodotus I with the Third Syrian War, a catastrophic conflict for the Seleucid Empire.

The new kingdom, highly urbanized and considered one of the richest of the Orient (&quot;opulentissimum illud mille urbium Bactrianum imperium&quot; &quot;The extremely prosperous Bactrian empire of the thousand cities&quot; Justin, XLI,1), was to further grow in power and engage into territorial expansion to the east and the west:


When the ruler of neighbouring Parthia, the former satrap and self-proclaimed king Andragoras, was eliminated by Arsaces, the rise of the Parthian Empire cut off the Greco-Bactrians from direct contact with the Greek world. Overland trade continued at a reduced rate, while sea trade between Greek Egypt and Bactria developed.

Diodotus was succeeded by his son Diodotus II, who allied himself with the Parthian Arsaces in his fight against Seleucus II:

Euthydemus, a Magnesian Greek according to Polybius and possibly satrap of Sogdiana, overthrew Diodotus II around 230 BC and started his own dynasty. Euthydemus&#x27;s control extended to Sogdiana, going beyond the city of Alexandria Eschate founded by Alexander the Great in Ferghana:

Euthydemus was attacked by the Seleucid ruler Antiochus III around 210 BC. Although he commanded 10,000 horsemen, Euthydemus initially lost a battle on the Arius and had to retreat. He then successfully resisted a three-year siege in the fortified city of Bactra (modern Balkh), before Antiochus finally decided to recognize the new ruler, and to offer one of his daughters to Euthydemus&#x27;s son Demetrius around 206 BC. Classical accounts also relate that Euthydemus negotiated peace with Antiochus III by suggesting that he deserved credit for overthrowing the original rebel Diodotus, and that he was protecting Central Asia from nomadic invasions thanks to his defensive efforts:

Following the departure of the Seleucid army, the Bactrian kingdom seems to have expanded. In the west, areas in north-eastern Iran may have been absorbed, possibly as far as into Parthia, whose ruler had been defeated by Antiochus the Great. These territories possibly are identical with the Bactrian satrapies of Tapuria and Traxiane.

To the north, Euthydemus also ruled Sogdiana and Ferghana, and there are indications that from Alexandria Eschate the Greco-Bactrians may have led expeditions as far as Kashgar and Ürümqi in Chinese Turkestan, leading to the first known contacts between China and the West around 220 BC. The Greek historian Strabo too writes that:


Several statuettes and representations of Greek soldiers have been found north of the Tien Shan, on the doorstep to China, and are today on display in the Xinjiang museum at Urumqi (Boardman).

Greek influences on Chinese art have also been suggested (Hirth, Rostovtzeff). Designs with rosette flowers, geometric lines, and glass inlays, suggestive of Hellenistic influences, can be found on some early Han dynasty bronze mirrors.

Numismatics also suggest that some technology exchanges may have occurred on these occasions: the Greco-Bactrians were the first in the world to issue cupro-nickel (75/25 ratio) coins, an alloy technology only known by the Chinese at the time under the name &quot;White copper&quot; (some weapons from the Warring States period were in copper-nickel alloy). The practice of exporting Chinese metals, in particular iron, for trade is attested around that period. Kings Euthydemus, Euthydemus II, Agathocles and Pantaleon made these coin issues around 170 BC and it has alternatively been suggested that a nickeliferous copper ore was the source from mines at Anarak. Copper-nickel would not be used again in coinage until the 19th century.

The presence of Chinese people in the Indian subcontinent from ancient times is also suggested by the accounts of the &quot;Ciñas&quot; in the &quot;Mahabharata&quot; and the &quot;Manu Smriti&quot;.

The Han dynasty explorer and ambassador Zhang Qian visited Bactria in 126 BC, and reported the presence of Chinese products in the Bactrian markets:
Upon his return, Zhang Qian informed the Chinese emperor Han Wudi of the level of sophistication of the urban civilizations of Ferghana, Bactria and Parthia, who became interested in developing commercial relationships with them:

A number of Chinese envoys were then sent to Central Asia, triggering the development of the Silk Road from the end of the 2nd century BC.

The Indian emperor Chandragupta, founder of the Mauryan dynasty, had re-conquered northwestern India upon the death of Alexander the Great around 322 BC. However, contacts were kept with his Greek neighbours in the Seleucid Empire, a dynastic alliance or the recognition of intermarriage between Greeks and Indians were established (described as an agreement on Epigamia in Ancient sources), and several Greeks, such as the historian Megasthenes, resided at the Mauryan court. Subsequently, each Mauryan emperor had a Greek ambassador at his court.

Chandragupta&#x27;s grandson Ashoka converted to the Buddhist faith and became a great proselytizer in the line of the traditional Pali canon of Theravada Buddhism, directing his efforts towards the Indian and the Hellenistic worlds from around 250 BC. According to the Edicts of Ashoka, set in stone, some of them written in Greek, he sent Buddhist emissaries to the Greek lands in Asia and as far as the Mediterranean. The edicts name each of the rulers of the Hellenistic world at the time.

Some of the Greek populations that had remained in northwestern India apparently converted to Buddhism:

Furthermore, according to Pali sources, some of Ashoka&#x27;s emissaries were Greek Buddhist monks, indicating close religious exchanges between the two cultures:

Greco-Bactrians probably received these Buddhist emissaries (At least Maharakkhita, lit. &quot;The Great Saved One&quot;, who was &quot;sent to the country of the Yona&quot;) and somehow tolerated the Buddhist faith, although little proof remains. In the 2nd century AD, the Christian dogmatist Clement of Alexandria recognized the existence of Buddhist Sramanas among the Bactrians (&quot;Bactrians&quot; meaning &quot;Oriental Greeks&quot; in that period), and even their influence on Greek thought:

===Rise of the Shungas (185 BC)===
In India, the Maurya dynasty was overthrown around 185 BC when Pushyamitra Shunga, the commander-in-chief of Mauryan Imperial forces and a Brahmin, assassinated the last of the Mauryan emperors Brihadratha. Pushyamitra Shunga then ascended the throne and established the Shunga Empire, which extended its control as far west as the Punjab.

Buddhist sources, such as the &quot;Ashokavadana&quot;, mention that Pushyamitra was hostile towards Buddhists and allegedly persecuted the Buddhist faith. A large number of Buddhist monasteries (viharas) were allegedly converted to Hindu temples, in such places as Nalanda, Bodhgaya, Sarnath or Mathura. While it is established by secular sources that Hinduism and Buddhism were in competition during this time, with the Shungas preferring the former to the latter, historians such as Etienne Lamotte and Romila Thapar argue that Buddhist accounts of persecution of Buddhists by Shungas are largely exaggerated. Some Puranic sources however also describe the resurgence of Brahmanism following the Maurya dynasty, and the killing of millions of Buddhists, such as the &quot;Pratisarga Parva&quot; of the &quot;Bhavishya Purana&quot;:

==History==
===Sources===
Some narrative history has survived for most of the Hellenistic world, at least of the kings and the wars; this is lacking for India. The main Greco-Roman source on the Indo-Greeks is Justin, who wrote an anthology drawn from the Roman historian Pompeius Trogus, who in turn wrote, from Greek sources, at the time of Augustus Caesar. In addition to these dozen sentences, the geographer Strabo mentions India a few times in the course of his long dispute with Eratosthenes about the shape of Eurasia. Most of these are purely geographical claims, but he does mention that Eratosthenes&#x27; sources say that some of the Greek kings conquered further than Alexander; Strabo does not believe them on this, nor does he believe that Menander and Demetrius son of Euthydemus conquered more tribes than Alexander There is half a story about Menander in one of the books of Polybius which has not come down to us intact.

There are Indian literary sources, ranging from the Milinda Panha, a dialogue between a Buddhist sage Nagasena and Indianized names that may be related to Indo-Greek kings such as Menander I. Names in these sources are consistently Indianized, and there is some dispute whether, for example, &quot;Dharmamitra&quot; represents &quot;Demetrius&quot; or is an Indian prince with that name. There was also a Chinese expedition to Bactria by Chang-k&#x27;ien under the Emperor Wu of Han, recorded in the Records of the Grand Historian and Book of the Former Han, with additional evidence in the Book of the Later Han; the identification of places and peoples behind transcriptions into Chinese is difficult, and several alternate interpretations have been proposed.

Other evidence of the broader and longer influence of Indo-Greeks is possibly suggested by Yavanarajya inscription, dated to the 1st-century BC. It mentions Yavanas, a term which is derived from &quot;Ionians&quot;, and which at that time most likely means &quot;Indo-Greeks&quot;.

===Expansion of Demetrius into India===

Demetrius I, the son of Euthydemus is generally considered the Greco-Bactrian king who first launched the Greek expansion into India. He is therefore the founder of the Indo-Greek realm. The true intents of the Greek kings in occupying India are unknown, but it is thought that the elimination of the Maurya Empire by the Sunga greatly encouraged this expansion. The Indo-Greeks, in particular Menander I who is said in the &quot;Milindapanha&quot; to have converted to Buddhism, also possibly received the help of Indian Buddhists.

There is an inscription from his father&#x27;s reign already officially hailing Demetrius as victorious. He also has one of the few absolute dates in Indo-Greek history: after his father held off Antiochus III for two years, 208–6 BC, the peace treaty included the offer of a marriage between Demetrius and Antiochus&#x27; daughter. Coins of Demetrius I have been found in Arachosia and in the Kabul Valley; the latter would be the first entry of the Greeks into India, as they defined it. There is also literary evidence for a campaign eastward against the Seres and the Phryni; but the order and dating of these conquests is uncertain.

Demetrius I seems to have conquered the Kabul valley, Arachosia and perhaps Gandhara; he struck no Indian coins, so either his conquests did not penetrate that far into India or he died before he could consolidate them. On his coins, Demetrius I always carries the elephant-helmet worn by Alexander, which seems to be a token of his Indian conquests. Bopearachchi believes that Demetrius received the title of &quot;King of India&quot; following his victories south of the Hindu Kush. He was also given, though perhaps only posthumously, the title (&quot;Aniketos&quot;, lit. &quot;Invincible&quot;) a cult title of Heracles, which Alexander had assumed; the later Indo-Greek kings Lysias, Philoxenus, and Artemidorus also took it. Finally, Demetrius may have been the founder of a newly discovered Yavana era, starting in 186/5 BC.

====First bilingual and multi-religion monetary system====
After the death of Demetrius, the Bactrian kings Pantaleon and Agathocles struck the first bilingual coins with Indian inscriptions found as far east as Taxila so in their time (c. 185–170 BC) the Bactrian kingdom seems to have included Gandhara. These first bilingual coins used the Brahmi script, whereas later kings would generally use Kharoshthi. They also went as far as incorporating Indian deities, variously interpreted as Hindu deities or the Buddha. They also included various Indian devices (lion, elephant, zebu bull) and symbols, some of them Buddhist such as the tree-in-railing. These symbols can also be seen in the Post-Mauryan coinage of Gandhara.
The Hinduist coinage of Agathocles is few but spectacular. Six Indian-standard silver drachmas were discovered at Ai-Khanoum in 1970, which depict Hindu deities. These are early Avatars of Vishnu: Balarama-Sankarshana with attributes consisting of the Gada mace and the plow, and Vasudeva-Krishna with the Vishnu attributes of the Shankha (a pear-shaped case or conch) and the Sudarshana Chakra wheel. These first attempts at incorporating Indian culture were only partly preserved by later kings: they all continued to struck bilingual coins, sometimes in addition to Attic coinage, but Greek deities remained prevalent. Indian animals however, such as the elephant, the bull or the lion, possibly with religious overtones, were used extensively in their Indian-standard square coinage. Buddhist wheels (Dharmachakras) still appear in the coinage of Menander I and Menander II.

Several Bactrian kings followed after Demetrius&#x27; death, and it seems likely that the civil wars between them made it possible for Apollodotus I (from c. 180/175 BC) to make himself independent as the first proper Indo-Greek king (who did not rule from Bactria). Large numbers of his coins have been found in India, and he seems to have reigned in Gandhara as well as western Punjab. Apollodotus I was succeeded by or ruled alongside Antimachus II, likely the son of the Bactrian king Antimachus I.

===Rule of Menander I===

The next important Indo-Greek king was Menander I who is considered to have been the most successful of the Indo-Greek kings, and who expanded the kingdom to its greatest extent by means of his various conquests. The finds of his coins are the most numerous and occur across the greatest geographical area, more than any of the other Indo-Greek kings. Coins stamped with Menander&#x27;s likeness can be found as far away as Eastern Punjab over 600 miles distant. Menander seems to have begun a second wave of conquests, and it seems likely that the easternmost conquests were made by him. 

Thus from 165 BCE until his death in 130 BCE, Menander I ruled Punjab with Sagala as his capital. Menander subsequently made an expedition across northern India to Mathura, where the Yavnarajya inscription was recorded. However, it is not known if this was a contiguous empire, or ruled through key city centers or polis. Soon after, Eucratides I king of the Greco-Bactrian Kingdom began warring with the Indo-Greeks in the north western frontier.

According to Apollodorus of Artemita, quoted by Strabo, the Indo-Greek territory for a while included the Indian coastal provinces of Sindh and possibly Gujarat. With archaeological methods, the Indo-Greek territory can however only be confirmed from the Kabul Valley to the eastern Punjab, so Greek presence outside was probably short-lived or non-existent.

Some sources also claim that the Indo-Greeks may have reached the Shunga capital Pataliputra in northern India. However, the nature of this expedition is a matter of controversy. The only recorded primary account regarding this campaign was written in the Yuga Purana, however this text was written as a forthcoming prophecy of an impending conflict. It is not known if the expedition was carried out, or if the Yavanas (Indo-Greeks) were successful in this campaign.

However the claim that the Yavanas held Pataliputra is not supported by numismatic or historical accounts, and is even contradicted by some inscriptions. King Kharavela of Kalinga, during his forth year reigning, was recorded in the Hathigumpha inscription to have routed a demoralized Indo-Greek army back to Mathura. It is not known which Indo-Greek was leading the army at the time, however it is presumed to be Menander I or perhaps even a later ruler. Then during his twelfth year in power, Kharavela is recorded to have battled the Shunga Empire and defeated the emperor Brhaspatimitra, known as Pushyamitra Shunga. Kharavela is then stated to have sacked the capital Pataliputra, and reclaimed the Jain idols and treasures that had been plundered from Kalinga and taken to Pataliputra. Based on the chronology and date during 1st century BC, it is postulated that Menander was the one leading the Indo-Greeks during Kharavela&#x27;s reign.

The important Bactrian king Eucratides seems to have attacked the Indo-Greek kingdom during the mid 2nd century BC. A Demetrius, called &quot;King of the Indians&quot;, seems to have confronted Eucratides in a four-month siege, reported by Justin, but he ultimately lost.

It is uncertain who this Demetrius was, and when the siege happened. Some scholars believe that it was Demetrius I.&quot;(Demetrius I) was probably the Demetrius who besieged Eucratides for four months&quot;, D.W. Mac Dowall, pp. 201–202, &quot;Afghanistan, ancien carrefour entre l&#x27;est et l&#x27;ouest&quot;. This analysis goes against Bopearachchi, who has suggested that Demetrius I died long before Eucratides came to power.&lt;/ref&gt; In any case, Eucratides seems to have occupied territory as far as the Indus, between ca. 170 BC and 150 BC. His advances were ultimately reclaimed by the Indo-Greek king Menander I,

Menander is also remembered in Buddhist literature, where he is called Milinda. He is described in the Milinda Panha as a convert to Buddhism and that he became an arhat whose relics were enshrined in a manner reminiscent of a Buddha. He also introduced a new coin type, with Athena Alkidemos (&quot;Protector of the people&quot;) on the reverse, which was adopted by most of his successors in the East.

Following the death of Menander his empire was greatly reduced due to the emergence of new kingdoms and republics within India. The most eminent entities to reform were the Yaudheya and the Arjunayanas, which were military confederations that had been annexed by the Maurya Empire. These republics began to mint new coins mentioning military victories, that were reminiscent of Indo-Greek type coins. Along with numismatic evidence, the Junagadh rock inscription of Rudradaman details the conquests of the Saka King Rudradaman I of the Western Satraps over the Yaudheya Republic, reaffirming their independence during the time of the Indo-Scythian invasions.
From the mid-2nd century BC, the Scythians, in turn being pushed forward by the Yuezhi who were completing a long migration from the border of China, started to invade Bactria from the north. Around 130 BC the last Greco-Bactrian king Heliocles was probably killed during the invasion and the Greco-Bactrian kingdom proper ceased to exist. The Parthians also probably played a role in the downfall of the Bactrian kingdom, and supplanted the Scythians.

There are however no historical recordings of events in the Indo-Greek kingdom after Menander&#x27;s death around 130 BC, since the Indo-Greeks had now become very isolated from the rest of the Graeco-Roman world. The later history of the Indo-Greek states, which lasted to around the shift BC/AD, is reconstructed almost entirely from archaeological and numismatical analyses.

====Western accounts====
Greek presence in Arachosia, where Greek populations had been living since before the acquisition of the territory by Chandragupta from Seleucus, is mentioned by Isidore of Charax. He describes Greek cities there, one of them called Demetrias, probably in honour of the conqueror Demetrius.

Apollodotus I (and Menander I) were mentioned by Pompeius Trogus as important Indo-Greek kings.
It is theorized that Greek advances temporarily went as far as the Shunga capital Pataliputra (today Patna) in eastern India. Senior considers that these conquests can only refer to Menander: Against this, John Mitchiner considers that the Greeks probably raided the Indian capital of Pataliputra during the time of Demetrius, though Mitchiner&#x27;s analysis is not based on numismatic evidence.


The seriousness of the attack is in some doubt: Menander may merely have joined a raid led by Indian Kings down the Ganges, as Indo-Greek presence has not been confirmed this far east.

To the south, the Greeks may have occupied the areas of the Sindh and Gujarat, including the strategic harbour of Barygaza (Bharuch), conquests also attested by coins dating from the Indo-Greek ruler Apollodotus I and by several ancient writers (Strabo 11; Periplus of the Erythraean Sea, Chap. 41/47):

The &quot;Periplus&quot; further explains ancient Indo-Greek rule and continued circulation of Indo-Greek coinage in the region:
Narain however dismisses the account of the Periplus as &quot;just a sailor&#x27;s story&quot;, and holds that coin finds are not necessarily indicators of occupation. Coin hoards further suggest that in Central India, the area of Malwa may also have been conquered.

====Rule in Mathura====

From numismatic, literary and epigraphic evidence, it seems that the Indo-Greeks also had control over Mathura during the period between 185 BCE and 85 BCE, and especially during the rule of Menander I (165–135 BC). Ptolemy mentioned that Menander&#x27;s ruler extended to Mathura (Μόδυρα).

Slightly northwest of Mathura, numerous Indo-Greek coins were found in the city of Khokrakot (modern Rohtak), belonging to as many as 14 different Indo-Greek kings, as well as coin molds in Naurangabad, suggesting Indo-Greek occupation of Haryana in the 2nd-1st centuries BC.

An inscription in Mathura discovered in 1988, the Yavanarajya inscription, mentions &quot;The last day of year 116 of Yavana hegemony (&quot;Yavanarajya&quot;)&quot;. The &quot;Yavanarajya&quot; probably refers to the rule of the Indo-Greeks in Mathura as late as around 70–60 BC (year 116 of the Yavana era). The extent of Indo-Greek rule in Mathura has been disputed, but it is also known that no remains of Sunga rule have been found in Mathura, and their territorial control is only proved as far as the central city of Ayodhya in northern central India, through the Dhanadeva-Ayodhya inscription. Archeological excavations of cast die-struck coins have also revealed the presence of a Mitra dynasty (coin issuers who did not name themselves &quot;kings&quot; on their coins) in Mathura sometime between 150 BC to 20 BC. Additionally, coins belonging to a Datta dynasty have also been excavated in Mathura. Whether these dynasties ruled independently or as satraps to larger kingdoms is unknown.

=====Figurines of foreigners in Mathura=====
Several figures of foreigners appear in the terracottas of Mathura art from the 4th to the 2nd century BCE, which are either described simply as &quot;foreigners&quot; or Persian or Iranian because of their foreign features. These figurines might reflect the increased contacts of Indians with foreigners during this period. Several of these seem to represent foreign soldiers who visited India during the Mauryan period and influenced modellers in Mathura with their peculiar ethnic features and uniforms. A helmeted head of a soldier, probably Indo-Greek, is also known, and dated to the 1st century BCE, now in the Mathura Museum. One of the terracotta statuettes, usually nicknamed the &quot;Persian nobleman&quot; and dated to the 2nd century BCE, can be seen wearing a coat, scarf, trousers and a turban.

Mathura may then have been conquered by the Mitra dynasty, or ruled independently by the Datta dynasty during the 1st century BC. In any case Mathura was under the control of the Indo-Scythian Northern Satraps from the 1st century of the Christian era.

=====Indian sources=====
The term &quot;Yavana&quot; is thought to be a transliteration of &quot;Ionians&quot; and is known to have designated Hellenistic Greeks (starting with the Edicts of Ashoka, where Ashoka writes about &quot;the &quot;Yavana&quot; king Antiochus&quot;), but may have sometimes referred to other foreigners as well after the 1st century AD.

Patanjali, a grammarian and commentator on Pāṇini, around 150 BC, describes in the &quot;Mahābhāsya&quot;, the invasion in two examples using the imperfect tense Sanskrit, denoting a recent or ongoing events:
* &quot;Arunad Yavanah Sāketam&quot; (&quot;The Yavanas (Greeks) were besieging Saketa&quot;)
* &quot;Arunad Yavano Madhyamikām&quot; (&quot;The Yavanas were besieging Madhyamika&quot; (the &quot;Middle country&quot;)).
The Brahmanical text of the &quot;Yuga Purana&quot; describes events in the form of a prophecy, which may have been historical, relates the attack of the Indo-Greeks on the capital Pataliputra, a magnificent fortified city with 570 towers and 64 gates according to Megasthenes, and describes the ultimate destruction of the city&#x27;s walls:
Accounts of battles between the Greeks and the Shunga in Central India are also found in the &quot;Mālavikāgnimitram&quot;, a play by Kālidāsa which is thought to describe an encounter between a Greek cavalry squadron and Vasumitra, the grandson of Pushyamitra, during the latter&#x27;s reign, by the Sindh River or the Kali Sindh River.

According to the Yuga Purana, the Yavanas thereafter will retreat following internal conflicts:
According to Mitchiner, the Hathigumpha inscription indicates the presence of the Indo-Greeks led by a ruler listed as &quot;ta&quot; from Mathura during the 1st century BCE. Although, the name of the king has been omitted and undeciphered. The remaining syllables [ta] has been disputed. It has been argued by Tarn to be referencing the ruler Demetrius. However this interpretation is disputed by other historians like Narain, which point out the discrepancies in chronology and the fact Demetrius didn&#x27;t venture past Punjab. Instead most historians now theorize it to be the Indo-Greek ruler Menander I, or perhaps a later Yavana king from Mathura.

But while this inscription may be interpreted as an indication that Demetrius I was the king who made conquests in Punjab, it is still true that he never issued any Indian-standard coins, only numerous coins with elephant symbolism, and the restoration of his name in Kharosthi on the Hathigumpha inscription: &quot;Di-Mi-Ta&quot;, has been doubted. The &quot;Di&quot; is a reconstruction, and it may be noted that the name of another Indo-Greek king, Amyntas, is spelt &quot;A-Mi-Ta&quot; in Kharosthi and may fit in.

Therefore, Menander remains the likeliest candidate for any advance east of Punjab.

Additional corroboration for mentions of Indo-Greek expeditions into the Gangetic Plains may be furnished by the Yavanarajya inscription discovered in Mathura, and discoveries of Menander&#x27;s coins in western Uttar Pradesh including the Pachkhura hoard of coins unearthed near the Yamuna River in Hamirpur district, Uttar Pradesh, and the unearthing of a clay pot filled with coins of preceding kings (Diodotus I, Diodotus II, and Euthydemus I) in Vaishali district, Bihar.

===Consolidation===

Menander is considered to have been probably the most successful Indo-Greek king, and the conqueror of the largest territory. The finds of his coins are the most numerous and the most widespread of all the Indo-Greek kings. Menander is also remembered in Buddhist literature, where he is called Milinda, and is described in the Milinda Panha as a convert to Buddhism: he became an arhat whose relics were enshrined in a manner reminiscent of the Buddha. He also introduced a new coin type, with Athena Alkidemos (&quot;Protector of the people&quot;) on the reverse, which was adopted by most of his successors in the East.

====Fall of Bactria and death of Menander====

From the mid-2nd century BC, the Scythians, in turn being pushed forward by the Yuezhi who were completing a long migration from the border of China, started to invade Bactria from the north. Around 130 BC the last Greco-Bactrian king Heliocles was probably killed during the invasion and the Greco-Bactrian kingdom proper ceased to exist. The Parthians also probably played a role in the downfall of the Bactrian kingdom.

Immediately after the fall of Bactria, the bronze coins of Indo-Greek king Zoilos I (130–120 BC), successor of Menander in the western part of the Indian territories, combined the club of Herakles with a Scythian-type bowcase and short recurve bow inside a victory wreath, illustrating interaction with horse-mounted people originating from the steppes, possibly either the Scythians (future Indo-Scythians), or the Yuezhi (future Kushans) who had invaded Greco-Bactria. This bow can be contrasted to the traditional Hellenistic long bow depicted on the coins of the eastern Indo-Greek queen Agathokleia. It is now known that 50 years later, the Indo-Scythian Maues was in alliance with the Indo-Greek kings in Taxila, and one of those kings, Artemidoros seems to claim on his coins that he is the son of Maues, although this is now disputed.

====Preservation of the Indo-Greek realm====
The extent of Indo-Greek rule is still uncertain and disputed. Probable members of the dynasty of Menander include the ruling queen Agathokleia, her son Strato I, and Nicias, though it is uncertain whether they ruled directly after Menander.

Other kings emerged, usually in the western part of the Indo-Greek realm, such as Zoilos I, Lysias, Antialcidas and Philoxenus. These rulers may have been relatives of either the Eucratid or the Euthydemid dynasties. The names of later kings were often new (members of Hellenistic dynasties usually inherited family names) but old reverses and titles were frequently repeated by the later rulers.

Immediately after the fall of Bactria, the bronze coins of Indo-Greek king Zoilos I (130–120 BC), successor of Menander in the western part of the Indian territories, combined the club of Herakles with a Scythian-type bowcase and short recurve bow inside a victory wreath, illustrating interaction with horse-mounted people originating from the steppes, possibly either the Scythians (future Indo-Scythians), or the Yuezhi (future Kushans) who had invaded Greco-Bactria. This bow can be contrasted to the traditional Hellenistic long bow depicted on the coins of the eastern Indo-Greek queen Agathokleia. It is now known that 50 years later, the Indo-Scythian Maues was in alliance with the Indo-Greek kings in Taxila, and one of those kings, Artemidoros seems to claim on his coins that he is the son of Maues, although this is now disputed.
While all Indo-Greek kings after Apollodotus I mainly issued bilingual (Greek and Kharoshti) coins for circulation in their own territories, several of them also struck rare Greek coins which have been found in Bactria. The later kings probably struck these coins as some kind of payment to the Scythian or Yuezhi tribes who now ruled there, though if as tribute or payment for mercenaries remains unknown. For some decades after the Bactrian invasion, relationships seem to have been peaceful between the Indo-Greeks and these relatively hellenised nomad tribes.

===Interactions with Indian culture and religions===
====Indo-Greeks in the regions of Vidisha and Sanchi (115 BC)====

;Vidisha
It is around this time, in 115 BC, that the embassy of Heliodorus, from king Antialkidas to the court of the Sungas king Bhagabhadra in Vidisha, is recorded. In the Sunga capital, Heliodorus established the Heliodorus pillar in a dedication to Vāsudeva. This would indicate that relations between the Indo-Greeks and the Sungas had improved by that time, that people traveled between the two realms, and also that the Indo-Greeks readily followed Indian religions.

;Sanchi
Also around the same period, circa 115 BC, decorative reliefs were introduced for the first time at nearby Sanchi, 6 km away from Vidisha, by craftsmen from the northwest. These craftsmen left mason&#x27;s marks in Kharoshthi, mainly used in the area around Gandhara, as opposed to the local Brahmi script. This seems to imply that these foreign workers were responsible for some of the earliest motifs and figures that can be found on the railings of the stupa. These early reliefs at Sanchi, (those of Sanchi Stupa No.2), are dated to 115 BC, while the more extensive pillar carvings are dated to 80 BC. These reliefs have been described as &quot;the oldest extensive stupa decoration in existence&quot;. They are considered the origin of Jataka illustrations in India. 
====Indo-Greeks and Bharhut (100-75 BC)====

A warrior figure, the Bharhut Yavana, appeared prominently on a high relief on the railings of the stupa of Bharhut circa 100 BC. The warrior has the flowing head band of a Greek king, a northern tunic with Hellenistic pleats, he hold a grape in his hand, and has a Buddhist triratana symbol on his sword. He has the role of a dvarapala, a Guardian of the entrance of the Stupa. The warrior has been described as a Greek, Some have suggested that he might even represent king Menander.

Also around that time, craftsmen from the Gandhara area are known to have been involved in the construction of the Buddhist torana gateways at Bharhut, which are dated to 100–75 BC: this is because mason&#x27;s marks in Kharosthi have been found on several elements of the Bharhut remains, indicating that some of the builders at least came from the north, particularly from Gandhara where the Kharoshti script was in use. 

Cunningham explained that the Kharosthi letters were found on the balusters between the architraves of the gateway, but none on the railings which all had Indian markings, summarizing that the gateways, which are artistically more refined, must have been made by artists from the North, whereas the railings were made by local artists.

====Sanchi Yavanas (50–1 BC)====

Again in Sanchi, but this time dating to the period of Satavahana rule circa 50–1 BC, one frieze can be observed which shows devotees in Greek attire making a dedication to the Great Stupa of Sanchi. The official notice at Sanchi describes &quot;Foreigners worshiping Stupa&quot;. The men are depicted with short curly hair, often held together with a headband of the type commonly seen on Greek coins. The clothing too is Greek, complete with tunics, cloaks, and sandals, typical of the Greek travelling costume. The musical instruments are also quite characteristic, such as the double flute called aulos. Also visible are carnyx-like horns. They are all celebrating at the entrance of the stupa. 

The actual participation of Yavanas/Yonas (Greek donors) to the construction of Sanchi is known from three inscriptions made by self-declared Yavana donors:
* The clearest of these reads &quot;Setapathiyasa Yonasa danam&quot; (&quot;Gift of the Yona of Setapatha&quot;), Setapatha being an uncertain city, possibly a location near Nasik, a place where other dedications by Yavanas are known, in cave No.17 of the Nasik Caves complex, and on the pillars of the Karla Caves not far away. 
* A second similar inscription on a pillar reads: &quot;[Sv]etapathasa (Yona?)sa danam&quot;, with probably the same meaning, (&quot;Gift of the Yona of Setapatha&quot;). 
* The third inscription, on two adjacent pavement slabs reads &quot;Cuda yo[vana]kasa bo silayo&quot; (&quot;Two slabs of Cuda, the Yonaka&quot;).

===Decline===

King Philoxenus (100–95 BC) briefly occupied the whole Greek territory from the Paropamisadae to Western Punjab, after that the territories fragmented again between smaller Indo-Greek kings. Throughout the 1st century BC, the Indo-Greeks progressively lost ground to the Indians in the east, and the Scythians, the Yuezhi, and the Parthians in the West. About 20 Indo-Greek kings are known during this period, down to the last known Indo-Greek rulers, Strato II and Strato III, who ruled in the Punjab region until around 10 AD.

====Loss of Hindu Kush territories (70 BC–)====

Around eight &quot;western&quot; Indo-Greek kings are known; most of them are distinguished by their issues of Attic coins for circulation in the neighbouring region.

One of the last important kings in the Paropamisadae (part of the Hindu Kush) was Hermaeus, who ruled until around 80 BC; soon after his death the Yuezhi or Sakas took over his areas from neighbouring Bactria. When Hermaeus is depicted on his coins riding a horse, he is equipped with the recurve bow and bow-case of the steppes and RC Senior believes him to be of partly nomad origin. The later king Hippostratus may however also have held territories in the Paropamisadae.

After the death of Hermaeus, the Yuezhi or Saka nomads became the new rulers of the Paropamisadae, and minted vast quantities of posthumous issues of Hermaeus up to around 40 AD, when they blend with the coinage of the Kushan king Kujula Kadphises. The first documented Yuezhi prince, Sapadbizes, ruled around 20 BC, and minted in Greek and in the same style as the western Indo-Greek kings, probably depending on Greek mints and chelators.

====Loss of Central territories (48/47 BC)====

Around 80 BC, an Indo-Scythian king named Maues, possibly a general in the service of the Indo-Greeks, ruled for a few years in northwestern India before the Indo-Greeks again took control. He seems to have been married to an Indo-Greek princess named Machene. King Hippostratus (65–55 BC) seems to have been one of the most successful subsequent Indo-Greek kings until he lost to the Indo-Scythian Azes I, who established an Indo-Scythian dynasty in 48/47 BC. Various coins seem to suggest that some sort of alliance may have taken place between the Indo-Greeks and the Scythians.

Although the Indo-Scythians clearly ruled militarily and politically, they remained surprisingly respectful of Greek and Indian cultures. Their coins were minted in Greek mints, continued using proper Greek and Kharoshthi legends, and incorporated depictions of Greek deities, particularly Zeus. The Mathura lion capital inscription attests that they adopted the Buddhist faith, as do the depictions of deities forming the vitarka mudra on their coins. Greek communities, far from being exterminated, probably persisted under Indo-Scythian rule. There is a possibility that a fusion, rather than a confrontation, occurred between the Greeks and the Indo-Scythians: in a recently published coin, Artemidorus seems to present himself as &quot;son of Maues&quot; ( but this is now disputed), and the Buner reliefs show Indo-Greeks and Indo-Scythians reveling in a Buddhist context.

The last known mention of an Indo-Greek ruler is suggested by an inscription on a signet ring of the 1st century AD in the name of a king Theodamas, from the Bajaur area of Gandhara, in modern Pakistan. No coins of him are known, but the signet bears in kharoshthi script the inscription &quot;Su Theodamasa&quot;, &quot;Su&quot; being explained as the Greek transliteration of the ubiquitous Kushan royal title &quot;Shau&quot; (&quot;Shah&quot;, &quot;King&quot;).

====Loss of Eastern territories (10 AD)====

The Indo-Greek kingdoms lost most of their eastern territories in the 1st century BC following the death of Menander. The Arjunayanas and the Yaudheya Republic mention military victories on their coins (&quot;Victory of the Arjunayanas&quot;, &quot;Victory of the Yaudheyas&quot;). These entities would remain independent until being conquered by the Saka King Rudradaman I of the Western Satraps.

They would again win independence until being conquered by Samudragupta (350-375 CE) of the Gupta Empire, and would disintegrate soon after. 

During the 1st century BC, the Trigartas, Audumbaras and finally the Kunindas also started to mint their own coins, usually in a style highly reminiscent of Indo-Greek coinage.

The Yavanas may have ruled as far as the area of Mathura from the time of Menander I until the middle of the 1st century BC: the Maghera inscription, from a village near Mathura, records the dedication of a well &quot;in the one hundred and sixteenth year of the reign of the Yavanas&quot;, which corresponds to circa 70 BC. In the 1st century BC, however, they lost the area of Mathura, either to the Mitra rulers under the Shunga Empire or to the Datta dynasty.

Fleeing the Sakas in the west, the Indo-Greeks continued to rule a territory in the eastern Punjab. The kingdom of the last Indo-Greek kings Strato II and Strato III was conquered by the Northern Satrap Saka ruler Rajuvula around 10 AD.

===Later contributions===

Some Greek nuclei may have continued to survive until the 2nd century AD. 

Nahapana had at his court a Greek writer named Yavanesvara (&quot;Lord of the Greeks&quot;), who translated from Greek to Sanskrit the Yavanajataka (&quot;Saying of the Greeks&quot;), an astrological treatise and India&#x27;s earliest Sanskrit work in horoscopy.

====Buddhist caves====
A large number of Buddhist caves in India, particularly in the west of the country, were artistically hewn between the 1st century BC and the 2nd century AD. Numerous donors provided the funds for the building of these caves and left donatory inscriptions, including laity, members of the clergy, government officials. Foreigners, mostly self-declared &quot;Yavanas&quot;, represented about 8% of all inscriptions.

;Karla Caves
Yavanas from the region of Nashik are mentioned as donors for six structural pillars in the Great Buddhist Chaitya of the Karla Caves built and dedicated by Western Satraps ruler Nahapana in 120 AD, although they seem to have adopted Buddhist names. In total, the Yavanas account for nearly half of the known dedicatory inscriptions on the pillars of the Great Chaitya. To this day, Nasik is known as the wine capital of India, using grapes that were probably originally imported by the Greeks. 
;Shivneri Caves
Two more Buddhist inscriptions by Yavanas were found in the Shivneri Caves. One of the inscriptions mentions the donation of a tank by the Yavana named Irila, while the other mentions the gift of a refectory to the Sangha by the Yavana named Cita. On this second inscription, the Buddhist symbols of the triratna and of the swastika (reversed) are positioned on both sides of the first word &quot;Yavana(sa)&quot;.

;Pandavleni Caves
One of the Buddhist caves (Cave No.17) in the Pandavleni Caves complex near Nashik was built and dedicated by &quot;Indragnidatta the son of the Yavana Dharmadeva, a northerner from Dattamittri&quot;, in the 2nd century AD. The city of &quot;Dattamittri&quot; is thought to be the city of Demetrias in Arachosia, mentioned by Isidore of Charax.

;Manmodi Caves
In the Manmodi Caves, near Junnar, an inscription by a Yavana donor appears on the façade of the main Chaitya, on the central flat surface of the lotus over the entrance: it mentions the erection of the hall-front (façade) for the Buddhist Samgha, by a Yavana donor named Chanda:

These contributions seem to have ended when the Satavahana King Gautamiputra Satakarni vanquished the Western Satrap ruler Nahapana, who had ruled over the area where these inscriptions were made, c. AD 130. This victory is known from the fact that Gautamiputra Satakarni restruck many of Nahapana&#x27;s coins, and that he is claimed to have defeated a confederacy of Shakas (Western Kshatrapas), Pahlavas (Indo-Parthians), and Yavanas (Indo-Greeks), in the inscription of his mother Queen Gotami Balasiri at Cave No. 3 of the Nasik Caves:

Inscriptions of the 3rd century (AD 210–325) at the Nagarjunakonda Buddhist complex in southern India again mention the involvement of the Yavanas with Buddhism: an inscription in a monastery (Site No.38) describes its residents as Acaryas and Theriyas of the Vibhajyavada school, &quot;who had gladdened the heart of the people of Kasmira, Gamdhara, Yavana, Vanavasa, and Tambapamnidipa&quot;.

====Yavana era for Buddha sculptures====

Several Gandhara Buddha statues with dated inscriptions, are now thought to have been dated in the Yavana era (originating c. 186 BC). One of the statues of the Buddha from Loriyan Tangai has an inscription mentioning &quot;the year 318&quot;. The era in question is not specified, but it is now thought, following the discovery of the Bajaur reliquary inscription and a suggestion by Richard Salomon which has gained wide acceptance, that it is dated in the Yavana era beginning in 186 BC, and gives a date for the Buddha statue of c. AD 143.
The inscription at the base of the statue is:

This would make it one of the earliest known representations of the Buddha, after the Bimaran casket (1st century AD), and at about the same time as the Buddhist coins of Kanishka.

Another statue of Buddha, the Buddha of Hashtnagar, is inscribed from the year 384, also probably in the Yavana era, which is thought to be AD 209. Only the pedestal is preserved in the British Museum, the statue itself, with folds of clothing having more relief than those of the Loriyan Tangai Buddha, having disappeared.

==Ideology==
Buddhism flourished under the Indo-Greek kings, and their rule, especially that of Menander, has been remembered as benevolent. It has been suggested, although direct evidence is lacking, that their invasion of India was intended to show their support for the Mauryan empire with which they may have had a long history of marital alliances, exchange of presents, demonstrations of friendship, exchange of ambassadors and religious missions. The historian Diodorus even wrote that the king of Pataliputra had &quot;great love for the Greeks&quot;.

The Greek expansion into Indian territory may have been intended to protect Greek populations in India, and to protect the Buddhist faith from the religious persecutions of the Shungas. The city of Sirkap founded by Demetrius combines Greek and Indian influences without signs of segregation between the two cultures.

The first Greek coins to be minted in India, those of Menander I and Apollodotus I bear the mention &quot;Saviour king&quot; (ΒΑΣΙΛΕΩΣ ΣΩΤΗΡΟΣ), a title with high value in the Greek world which indicated an important deflective victory. For instance, Ptolemy I had been &quot;Soter&quot; (saviour) because he had helped save Rhodes from Demetrius the Besieger, and Antiochus I because he had saved Asia Minor from the Gauls. The title was also inscribed in Pali as (&quot;Tratarasa&quot;) on the reverse of their coins. Menander and Apollodotus may indeed have been saviours to the Greek populations residing in India, and to some of the Indians as well.

Also, most of the coins of the Greek kings in India were bilingual, written in Greek on the front and in Pali on the back (in the Kharosthi script, derived from Aramaic, rather than the more eastern Brahmi, which was used only once on coins of Agathocles of Bactria), a tremendous concession to another culture never before made in the Hellenic world. From the reign of Apollodotus II, around 80 BC, Kharosthi letters started to be used as mintmarks on coins in combination with Greek monograms and mintmarks, suggesting the participation of local technicians to the minting process. Incidentally, these bilingual coins of the Indo-Greeks were the key in the decipherment of the Kharoshthi script by James Prinsep (1835) and Carl Ludwig Grotefend (1836). Kharoshthi became extinct around the 3rd century AD.

In Indian literature, the Indo-Greeks are described as Yavanas (in Sanskrit), or Yonas (in Pali) both thought to be transliterations of &quot;Ionians&quot;. In the Harivamsa the &quot;Yavana&quot; Indo-Greeks are qualified, together with the Sakas, Kambojas, Pahlavas and Paradas as &quot;Kshatriya-pungava&quot; i.e. foremost among the Warrior caste, or Kshatriyas. The Majjhima Nikaya explains that in the lands of the Yavanas and Kambojas, in contrast with the numerous Indian castes, there were only two classes of people, Aryas and Dasas (masters and slaves).

==Religion==


In addition to the worship of the Classical pantheon of the Greek deities found on their coins (Zeus, Herakles, Athena, Apollo...), the Indo-Greeks were involved with local faiths, particularly with Buddhism, but also with Hinduism and Zoroastrianism.

===Interactions with Buddhism===
Chandragupta Maurya, the founder of the Mauryan Empire, conquered the Greek satraps left by Alexander, which belonged to Seleucus I Nicator of the Seleucid Empire. The Mauryan Emperor Ashoka would then establish the largest empire in the Indian Subcontinent through an aggressive expansion. Ashoka converted to Buddhism following the destructive Kalinga War, abandoning further conquests in favor of humanitarian reforms. Ashoka erected the Edicts of Ashoka to spread Buddhism and the &#x27;Law of Piety&#x27; throughout his dominion. In one of his edicts, Ashoka claims to have converted his Greek population along with others to Buddhism.

The last Mauryan Emperor Brihadratha was assassinated by Pushyamitra Shunga, the former senapati or &quot;army lord&quot; of the Mauryan Empire and founder of the Shunga Empire. Pushyamitra is alleged to have persecuted Buddhism in favor of Hinduism, likely in attempt to further remove the legacy of the Mauryan Empire.

It is possible that Menander I Soter or the &quot;Saviour king&quot;, choose Sakala as his capital due to the Buddhist presence there. Menander I, is stated to have converted to Buddhism in the Milinda Panha, which records the dialogue between Menander and the Buddhist monk Nagasena. Menander is claimed to have obtained the title of an arhat.
The wheel he represented on some of his coins was most likely Buddhist Dharmachakra.

Another Indian text, the &quot;Stupavadana&quot; of Ksemendra, mentions in the form of a prophecy that Menander will build a stupa in Pataliputra.

Plutarch also presents Menander as an example of benevolent rule, and explains that upon his death, the honour of sharing his remains was claimed by the various cities under his rule, and they were enshrined in &quot;monuments&quot; (μνημεία, probably stupas), in a parallel with the historic Buddha:
The Butkara stupa was &quot;monumentalized&quot; by the addition of Hellenistic architectural decorations during Indo-Greek rule in the 2nd century BC. A coin of Menander I was found in the second oldest stratum (GSt 2) of the Butkara stupa suggesting a period of additional constructions during the reign of Menander. It is thought that Menander was the builder of the second oldest layer of the Butkara stupa, following its initial construction during the Mauryan Empire.

===&quot;Followers of the Dharma&quot;===

Several Indo-Greek kings use the title &quot;Dharmikasa&quot;, i.e. &quot;Follower of the Dharma&quot;, in the Kharoshti script on the obverse of their coins. The corresponding legend in Greek is &quot;Dikaios&quot; (&quot;The Just&quot;), a rather usual attribute on Greek coins. The expression &quot;Follower of the Dharma&quot; would of course resonate strongly with Indian subjects, used to this expression being employed by pious kings, especially since the time of Ashoka who advocated the Dharma in his inscriptions. The seven kings using &quot;Dharmakasa&quot;, i.e. &quot;Follower of the Dharma&quot;, are late Indo-Greek kings, from around 150 BC, right after the reign of Menander I, and mainly associated with the area of Gandhara: Zoilos I (130–120 BC), Strato (130–110 BC), Heliokles II (95–80 BC), Theophilos (130 or 90 BC), Menander II (90–85 BC), Archebios (90–80 BC) and Peukolaos (c. 90 BC). The attribute of &quot;Dharmika&quot; was again used a century later by a known Buddhist practitioner, Indo-Scythian king Kharahostes, to extoll on his coins the virtues of his predecessor king Azes.

===Blessing gestures===
From the time of Agathokleia and Strato I, circa 100 BC, kings and divinities are regularly show on coins making blessing gestures, which often seem similar to the Buddhist Vitarka mudra. As centuries passed, the exact shapes taken by the hand becomes less clear. This blessing gesture was also often adopted by the Indo-Scythians. 
===Vaishnavites===
The Heliodorus pillar is a stone column that was erected around 113 BC in central India in Vidisha near modern Besnagar, by Heliodorus, a Greek ambassador of the Indo-Greek king Antialcidas to the court of the Shunga king Bhagabhadra. The pillar originally supported a statue of Garuda. In the dedication, the Indo-Greek ambassador explains he is a devotee of &quot;Vāsudeva, the God of Gods&quot;. Historically, it is the first known inscription related to the Bhagavata cult in India.

==Art==

In general, the art of the Indo-Greeks is poorly documented, and few works of art (apart from their coins and a few stone palettes) are directly attributed to them. The coinage of the Indo-Greeks however is generally considered some of the most artistically brilliant of Antiquity. The Hellenistic heritage (Ai-Khanoum) and artistic proficiency of the Indo-Greek world would suggest a rich sculptural tradition as well, but traditionally very few sculptural remains have been attributed to them. On the contrary, most Gandharan Hellenistic works of art are usually attributed to the direct successors of the Indo-Greeks in India in the 1st century AD, such as the nomadic Indo-Scythians, the Indo-Parthians and, in an already decadent state, the Kushans In general, Gandharan sculpture cannot be dated exactly, leaving the exact chronology open to interpretation.

The possibility of a direct connection between the Indo-Greeks and Greco-Buddhist art has been reaffirmed recently as the dating of the rule of Indo-Greek kings has been extended to the first decades of the 1st century AD, with the reign of Strato II in the Punjab. Also, Foucher, Tarn, and more recently, Boardman, Bussagli and McEvilley have taken the view that some of the most purely Hellenistic works of northwestern India and Afghanistan, may actually be wrongly attributed to later centuries, and instead belong to a period one or two centuries earlier, to the time of the Indo-Greeks in the 2nd–1st century BC:
This is particularly the case of some purely Hellenistic works in Hadda, Afghanistan, an area which &quot;might indeed be the cradle of incipient Buddhist sculpture in Indo-Greek style&quot;. Referring to one of the Buddha triads in Hadda, in which the Buddha is sided by very Classical depictions of Herakles/Vajrapani and Tyche/Hariti, Boardman explains that both figures &quot;might at first (and even second) glance, pass as, say, from Asia Minor or Syria of the first or second century BC (...) these are essentially Greek figures, executed by artists fully conversant with far more than the externals of the Classical style&quot;.

Alternatively, it has been suggested that these works of art may have been executed by itinerant Greek artists during the time of maritime contacts with the West from the 1st to the 3rd century AD.

The Greco-Buddhist art of Gandhara, beyond the omnipresence of Greek style and stylistic elements which might be simply considered an enduring artistic tradition, offers numerous depictions of people in Greek Classical realistic style, attitudes and fashion (clothes such as the chiton and the himation, similar in form and style to the 2nd century BC Greco-Bactrian statues of Ai-Khanoum, hairstyle), holding contraptions which are characteristic of Greek culture (amphoras, &quot;kantaros&quot; Greek drinking cups), in situations which can range from festive (such as Bacchanalian scenes) to Buddhist-devotional.

Uncertainties in dating make it unclear whether these works of art actually depict Greeks of the period of Indo-Greek rule up to the 1st century BC, or remaining Greek communities under the rule of the Indo-Parthians or Kushans in the 1st and 2nd century AD. Benjamin Rowland thinks that the Indo-Greeks, rather than the Indo-Scythians or the Kushans, may have been the models for the Bodhisattva statues of Gandhara

==Economy==
Very little is known about the economy of the Indo-Greeks, although it seems to have been rather vibrant.

===Coinage===

The abundance of their coins would tend to suggest large mining operations, particularly in the mountainous area of the Hindu-Kush, and an important monetary economy. The Indo-Greek did strike bilingual coins both in the Greek &quot;round&quot; standard and in the Indian &quot;square&quot; standard, suggesting that monetary circulation extended to all parts of society. The adoption of Indo-Greek monetary conventions by neighbouring kingdoms, such as the Kunindas to the east and the Satavahanas to the south, would also suggest that Indo-Greek coins were used extensively for cross-border trade.

===Tribute payments===
It would also seem that some of the coins emitted by the Indo-Greek kings, particularly those in the monolingual Attic standard, may have been used to pay some form of tribute to the Yuezhi tribes north of the Hindu-Kush. This is indicated by the coins finds of the Qunduz hoard in northern Afghanistan, which have yielded quantities of Indo-Greek coins in the Hellenistic standard (Greek weights, Greek language), although none of the kings represented in the hoard are known to have ruled so far north. Conversely, none of these coins have ever been found south of the Hindu-Kush.

===Trade with China===
The Indo-Greek kings in Southern Asia issued the first known cupro-nickel coins, with Euthydemus II, dating from 180 to 170 BC, and his younger brothers Pantaleon and Agathocles around 170 BC. As only China was able to produce cupro-nickel at that time, and as the alloy ratios are exclusively similar, it has been suggested that the metal was the result of exchanges between China and Bactria.

An indirect testimony by the Chinese explorer Zhang Qian, who visited Bactria around 128 BC, suggests that intense trade with Southern China was going through northern India. Zhang Qian explains that he found Chinese products in the Bactrian markets, and that they were transiting through northwestern India, which he incidentally describes as a civilization similar to that of Bactria:
Recent excavations at the burial site of China&#x27;s first Emperor Qin Shi Huang, dating back to the 3rd century BCE, also suggest Greek influence in the artworks found there, including in the manufacture of the famous Terracotta Army. It is also suggested that Greek artists may have come to China at that time to train local artisans in making sculptures.

===Indian Ocean trade===

Maritime relations across the Indian Ocean started in the 3rd century BC, and further developed during the time of the Indo-Greeks together with their territorial expansion along the western coast of India. The first contacts started when the Ptolemies constructed the Red Sea ports of Myos Hormos and Berenike, with destination the Indus delta, the Kathiawar peninsula or Muziris. Around 130 BC, Eudoxus of Cyzicus is reported (Strabo, &quot;Geog.&quot;  II.3.4) to have made a successful voyage to India and returned with a cargo of perfumes and gemstones. By the time Indo-Greek rule was ending, up to 120 ships were setting sail every year from Myos Hormos to India (Strabo &quot;Geog.&quot; II.5.12).

==Armed forces==

The coins of the Indo-Greeks provide rich clues on their uniforms and weapons. Typical Hellenistic uniforms are depicted, with helmets being either round in the Greco-Bactrian style, or the flat kausia of the Macedonians (coins of Apollodotus I).

===Military technology===

Their weapons were spears, swords, longbow (on the coins of Agathokleia) and arrows. Around 130 BC, the Central Asian recurve bow of the steppes with its gorytos box started to appear for the first time on the coins of Zoilos I, suggesting strong interactions (and apparently an alliance) with nomadic peoples, either the Yuezhi or the Scythians. The recurve bow becomes a standard feature of Indo-Greek horsemen by 90 BC, as seen on some of the coins of Hermaeus.

Generally, Indo-Greek kings are often represented riding horses, as early as the reign of Antimachus II around 160 BC. The equestrian tradition probably goes back to the Greco-Bactrians, who are said by Polybius to have faced a Seleucid invasion in 210 BC with 10,000 horsemen. Although war elephants are never represented on coins, a harness plate (phalera) dated to the 3rd–2nd century BC, today in the Hermitage Museum, depicts a helmetted Greek combatant on an Indian war elephant.

The Milinda Panha, in the questions of Nagasena to king Menander, provides a rare glimpse of the military methods of the period:
The Milinda Panha also describes the structure of Menander&#x27;s army:
===Size of Indo-Greek armies===

The armed forces of the Indo-Greeks engaged in battles with other Indian kingdoms. The ruler of Kalinga, King Kharavela, states in the Hathigumpha inscription that during the 8th year of his reign he led a large army in the direction of a Yavana King, and that he forced their demoralized army to retreat to Mathura.
The name of the Yavana king is not clear, but it contains three letters, and the middle letter can be read as &quot;ma&quot; or &quot;mi&quot;. R. D. Banerji and K.P. Jayaswal read the name of the Yavana king as &quot;Dimita&quot;, and identify him with Demetrius I of Bactria. However, according to Ramaprasad Chanda, this identification results in &quot;chronological impossibilities&quot;.
The Greek ambassador Megasthenes took special note of the military strength of Kalinga in his &quot;Indica&quot; in the middle of the 3rd century BC:
An account by the Roman writer Justin gives another hint of the size of Indo-Greek armies, which, in the case of the conflict between the Greco-Bactrian Eucratides and the Indo-Greek Demetrius II, he numbers at 60,000 (although they allegedly lost to 300 Greco-Bactrians):

The Indo-Greek armies would be conquered by Indo-Scythians, a nomadic tribe from Central Asia.

==Legacy==
From the 1st century AD, the Greek communities of central Asia and the northwestern Indian subcontinent lived under the control of the Kushan branch of the Yuezhi, apart from a short-lived invasion of the Indo-Parthian Kingdom. The Kushans founded the Kushan Empire, which was to prosper for several centuries. In the south, the Greeks were under the rule of the Western Kshatrapas. The Kalash tribe of the Chitral Valley claim to be descendants of the Indo-Greeks; although this is disputed.
It is unclear how much longer the Greeks managed to maintain a distinct presence in the Indian sub-continent. The legacy of the Indo-Greeks was felt however for several centuries, from the usage of the Greek language and calendrical methods, to the influences on the numismatics of the Indian subcontinent, traceable down to the period of the Gupta Empire in the 4th century.

The Greeks may also have maintained a presence in their cities until quite late. Isidorus of Charax in his 1st century AD &quot;Parthian stations&quot; itinerary described an &quot;Alexandropolis, the metropolis of Arachosia&quot;, thought to be Alexandria Arachosia, which he said was still Greek even at such a late time:
The Indo-Greeks may also have had some influence on the religious plane as well, especially in relation to the developing Mahayana Buddhism. Mahayana Buddhism has been described as &quot;the form of Buddhism which (regardless of how Hinduized its later forms became) seems to have originated in the Greco-Buddhist communities of India, through a conflation of the Greek Democritean–Sophistic–Pyrrhonist tradition with the rudimentary and unformalized empirical and skeptical elements already present in early Buddhism&quot;.

==Chronology==

Today 36 Indo-Greek kings are known. Several of them are also recorded in Western and Indian historical sources, but the majority are known through numismatic evidence only. The exact chronology and sequencing of their rule is still a matter of scholarly inquiry, with adjustments regular being made with new analysis and coin finds (overstrikes of one king over another&#x27;s coins being the most critical element in establishing chronological sequences).

There is an important evolution of coin shape (round to square) and material (from gold to silver to brass) across the territories and the periods, and from Greek type to Indian type over a period of nearly 3 centuries. Also, the quality of coinage illustration decreases down to the 1st century AD. Coinage evolution is an important point of Indo-Greek history, and actually one of the most important since most of these kings are only known by their coins, and their chronology is mainly established by the evolution of the coin types.

The system used here is adapted from Osmund Bopearachchi, supplemented by the views of R C Senior and occasionally other authorities.

<doc id="779323" wikidata="Q358635" url="?curid=779323" title="Lodewijk Elzevir">
<text>Lodewijk Elzevir (c. 1540 – 4 February 1617), originally &quot;Lodewijk or Louis Elsevier or Elzevier&quot;, was a printer, born in the city of Leuven (today in Belgium, then part of the Habsburg Netherlands or Spanish Netherlands). He was the founder of the House of Elzevir, which printed works such as &quot;Two New Sciences&quot;, written by Galileo, at a time when his work was suppressed for religious reasons. Although the House of Elzevir ceased publishing in 1712, the modern Dutch Elsevier company was founded in 1880 and took its name from the historic Dutch publishing house.

==Biography==
Elzevir, son of Hans Helschevier, was born in Leuven and started his career as a bookbinder at the printing shop of Christoffel Plantijn in Antwerp. In 1563, he married Maijke de Verdeijen Verbois in Antwerp, where his first two sons were born. He moved to Wesel before 1570, to Douai (before 1575), and settled in Leiden before 1580.

He produced his first book at Leiden in 1583, and the business continued until 1791 under his descendants. The printing house was instrumental in the publication of important work in science. Atypical of other printers of the era, Elzevir books focused on sturdiness rather than elegance and legibility over ornate characters. His books were usually smaller with narrow margins. Christopher van Dyck was one of the type designers. Most of the work was published in Latin.

His oldest son, Matthijs, his sixth son, Bonaventure Elzevir, and his grandsons, Abraham and Isaac Elzevir, continued and expanded the business. The Lodowijk Elzevir who famously met Galileo in Arcetri in 1636 was the grandson of this Lodwijk (1604–1670).

<text>Louis Lincoln Emmerson (December 27, 1863 – February 4, 1941) was an American Republican politician and the twenty-seventh governor of Illinois. He was also a prominent figure in Freemasonry in Illinois.

== Early life ==
Louis was born on December 27, 1863, in Albion, Illinois, and is the son of Jesse and Fannie Emerson. He was one of fourteen children. After completing his education in the Albion public school system, Emmerson moved to Mount Vernon, Illinois, in 1883, and established a career in the mercantile business. In 1887 Louis married his wife, Ann Mathews, who was the daughter of Thomas Matthews. He also was influential in the organization of the Mount Vernon Third National Bank, which occurred in 1901.

== Freemasonry ==
in 1891, Emmerson became a made master mason of the Mt. Vernon masonic lodge. In 1929, he was elected the Grand Master of the Grand Lodge Of Illinois. He became a Scottish Rite mason and served as the Grand High Priest of the Grand Chapter of Royal Arch Masons of Illinois and Right Eminent Grand Commander of the Grand Commandery of Knights Templar of Illinois.

== Political career ==
Emmerson entered politics in 1912, pursuing the position of state treasurer but was unsuccessful. However, four years later, he won the election for secretary of state which he held for twelve years.

=== Governor ===
Emmerson won the 1928 Republican gubernatorial nomination by a margin of 63% to 37% over the incumbent governor, the corrupt Len Small, and was sworn into the governorship on January 14, 1929. He was the oldest Illinois Governor at that time at age 65.

During his service from 1929 to 1933, at the start of the Great Depression, legislation was adopted that eased penalties on overdue taxes and allowed for the issuance of emergency bonds. Also, a motor fuel-tax was instituted and used for improvements in the highway system, the first unemployment commission was initiated, and federal grants were sanctioned for the completion of the Lakes-to-the-Gulf Waterway. Emmerson did not seek reelection and left office on January 9, 1933, retiring from politics.

== Later life ==
Governor Louis L. Emmerson died on February 4, 1941, and was buried at the Oakwood Cemetery in Mt. Vernon, Illinois.

<doc id="779337" wikidata="Q1145042" url="?curid=779337" title="Ogura Hyakunin Isshu">
<text>is a classical Japanese anthology of one hundred Japanese &quot;waka&quot; by one hundred poets. &quot;Hyakunin isshu&quot; can be translated to &quot;one hundred people, one poem [each]&quot;; it can also refer to the card game of &quot;uta-garuta&quot;, which uses a deck composed of cards based on the &quot;Hyakunin Isshu&quot;.

The most famous and standard version was compiled by Fujiwara no Teika (1162–1241) while he lived in the Ogura district of Kyoto. It is therefore also known as .

==Compilation==
One of Teika&#x27;s diaries, the &quot;Meigetsuki&quot;, says that his son Tameie asked him to arrange one hundred poems for Tameie&#x27;s father-in-law, Utsunomiya Yoritsuna, who was furnishing a residence near Mount Ogura; hence the full name of &quot;Ogura Hyakunin Isshu&quot;. In order to decorate screens of the residence, Fujiwara no Teika produced the calligraphy poem sheets.

Hishikawa Moronobu (1618–1694) provided woodblock portraits for each of the poets included in the anthology. Katsukawa Shunshō (1726–1793) designed prints for a full-color edition published in 1775.

In his own lifetime, Teika was better known for other work. For example, in 1200 (&quot;Shōji&quot; 2), he prepared another anthology of one hundred poems for ex-Emperor Go-Toba, called the &quot;Shōji Hyakushu&quot;.

==Poems==
=== Poem number 1 ===
A poem by Emperor Tenji about the hardships of farmers. Teika chose this poem from the &quot;Gosen Wakashū&quot;:
===Poem number 2===
A visually-descriptive poem attributed to Empress Jitō. Teika chose this poem from the &quot;Shin Kokin Wakashū&quot;:

The original was likely based from a poem of the &quot;Man&#x27;yōshū&quot; (book 1, poem 28) by the same poet.

===Poem number 26===

A quite different poem is attributed to &quot;Sadaijin&quot; Fujiwara no Tadahira in the context of a very specific incident. After abdicating, former Emperor Uda visited Mount Ogura in Yamashiro Province. He was so greatly impressed by the beauty of autumn colours of the maples that he ordered Fujiwara no Tadahira to encourage Uda&#x27;s son and heir, Emperor Daigo, to visit the same area.

 was Tadahira&#x27;s posthumous name, and this is the name used in William Porter&#x27;s translation of the poem which observes that &quot;[t]he maples of Mount Ogura / If they could understand / Would keep their brilliant leaves / until [t]he Ruler of this land / Pass with his Royal band.&quot; The accompanying 18th century illustration shows a person of consequence riding an ox in a procession with attendants on foot. The group is passing through an area of maple leaves.

Teika chose this poem from the &quot;Shūi Wakashū&quot; for the hundred poems collection:

===Poem number 86===
A poem by Saigyō about the pain of love. This poem was chosen from the &quot;Senzai Wakashū&quot;:

==Order of arrangement of the collection==
==English translations==
The &quot;Ogura Hyakunin Isshu&quot; has been translated into many languages and into English many times.

English translations include:

* Clay MacCauley, &quot;Hyakunin-isshu (Single Songs of a Hundred Poets)&quot;, &quot;TASJ, 27&quot;(4), 1–152 (1899)

==Other Hyakunin Isshu anthologies==
Many other anthologies compiled along the same criteria—one hundred poems by one hundred poets—include the words &quot;hyakunin isshu&quot;, notably the World War II-era , or &quot;One Hundred Patriotic Poems by One Hundred Poets&quot;. Also important is , a series of parodies of the original &quot;Ogura&quot; collection.

==Card game==
Teika&#x27;s anthology is the basis for the card game of &quot;karuta&quot;, which has been popular since the Edo period.

Many forms of playing games with &quot;Hyakunin Isshu&quot; exist in Japan, such as &quot;Uta-garuta&quot;, the basis for competitive karuta (&quot;kyōgi karuta&quot;).

<text>The study of the physics of [[computation]] relates to understanding the fundamental physical limits of computers. This field has led to the investigation of how thermodynamics limits information processing, the understanding of chaos and dynamical systems, and a rapidly growing effort to invent new quantum computers.

<doc id="779354" wikidata="Q2910090" url="?curid=779354" title="Meir Simcha of Dvinsk">
<text>Meir Simcha of Dvinsk (also known as Meir Simcha Ha-Kohen, 1843 – 14 August 1926) was an Orthodox rabbi in the Russian Empire and Latvia. A leader of the Jewish community in Daugavpils, he is known for his writings on Maimonides&#x27; Mishneh Torah, which he titled &quot;Ohr Somayach&quot;, as well as his novellae on the Torah, titled &quot;Meshech Chochma&quot;.

==Early life==
Meir Simcha was born in Butrimonys (), Vilna Governorate, in the Russian Empire (now Lithuania) to Samson Kalonymus, a local wealthy merchant. According to family tradition, his later success in Torah study was attributed to two blessings his parents had received from local rabbis before his birth. He received his education locally, and managed to evade the regular roundups of Jewish boys that were being held as a result of the Cantonist decrees that had been in effect since 1827. After marrying in 1860, at age 17, he settled in Białystok, Grodno Governorate (now Poland), where his wife opened a business in order to support him while he continued his Talmudic studies. 

==Career==
After turning down many rabbinical positions that were offered him during his 27 years in Białystok, Meir Simcha finally relented and accepted the rabbinate of the &quot;mitnagdim&quot; (non-Hasidic Jews) in the town of Dvinsk, Vitebsk Governorate (now Daugavpils, Latvia). He served in that position for 39 years until his death. His counterpart there was Yosef Rosen, a Hasidic rabbi known as the Rogatchover Gaon—or by his work, &quot;Tzofnath Paneach&quot;. The two had great respect for one another—despite Rosen&#x27;s fiery temper—and on occasion referred questions in Jewish law to each other. They also shared a love for the works of Maimonides.

In 1906, a certain Shlomo Friedlander claimed to have discovered and then published two tractates of the Jerusalem Talmud that had been considered to have been lost for hundreds of years. Meir Simcha was one of a group of prominent rabbis who discovered that the work was a very clever forgery, and denounced it as such.

In Dvinsk, he received supplicants from the entire region, and was frequently consulted on issues affecting the community at large, including Poland and Lithuania. He reportedly turned down offers for the rabbinate in various large cities, including Jerusalem, New York City and Kovno.

==Opinions==
Meir Simcha opposed the non-religious Zionist groups, but expressed his approval of Religious Zionism. After the Balfour Declaration, he was of the opinion that the Three Oaths were no longer in effect. He was present at the founding meetings of Agudath Yisrael in the German town of Bad Homburg, but could not attend the first large conference in Katowice due to poor health. He had several clashes with some of his contemporaries, including Yisrael Meir Kagan (the Chafetz Chaim) on political issues and questions of Jewish law.

It is harder to determine his exact stance in philosophical matters, although much can be gleaned from his &quot;Meshech Chochma&quot;. His main contribution to Jewish philosophy was to be posthumous. His student Menachem Mendel Zaks published &quot;Meshech Chochma&quot;, which contains novellae on the Torah, but very often branches off into questions of Jewish philosophy. Meir Simcha is often quoted as having predicted the Holocaust in a statement in this work: &quot;They think that Berlin is Jerusalem ... from there will come the storm winds that will uproot them&quot;.

==Personal life and death==
Meir Simcha had one daughter with mental issues who predeceased him. He mentions a son-in-law, Avraham (Luftvir), in his book &quot;Meshech Chochma&quot;. The couple died young and are buried in Warsaw. Meir Simcha died in a hotel in Riga while seeking medical treatment. He left no living descendants. As a result of this, one of his most prominent students and close friend Yisrael Avraham Abba Krieger committed himself to carrying on his legacy.

==Works==
Meir Simcha authored &quot;Ohr Somayach&quot; (or &quot;Ohr Sameiach&quot;; ), a collection of novellae on Maimonides&#x27; Mishneh Torah. His approach is highly original, gathering material from the breadth of Jewish religious literature to approach difficult contradictions in Maimonides&#x27; main work of Jewish law. It was published during his lifetime and immediately became popular. Other works, novellae on the Talmud and responsa, did not have the same impact but are still used for reference.

*&quot;Ohr Somayach&quot; on Talmudic tractates &quot;Bava Kamma&quot; and &quot;Bava Metzia&quot;.

==Ohr Somayach yeshivas==
In the late 1970s, several baal teshuva yeshivas under Haredi auspices were founded and chose to honor the memory of Meir Simcha of Dvinsk by naming their institutions after his pen name &quot;Ohr Somayach&quot;. The first of these was the yeshiva Ohr Somayach, Jerusalem in Israel, and another was Ohr Somayach, Monsey in the United States. Other branches were established in Toronto and Montreal in Canada, and in Detroit, Los Angeles, and Philadelphia. Other branches worldwide bearing the name &quot;Ohr Somayach&quot; are Ohr Somayach, South Africa, and those in London in the United Kingdom, Kiev in Ukraine, and Sydney in Australia.

<text>Delos Carleton Emmons (January 17, 1889 – October 3, 1965) was a lieutenant general in the United States Army. He was the military governor of Hawaii in the aftermath of the Attack on Pearl Harbor and administered the replacement of normal U.S. banknotes with special war-emergency US banknotes in case the islands were invaded. He is credited with preventing the mass evacuation of Japanese-Americans from Hawaii, which many have called a shameful episode of racism and jingoism that was felt hardest on the mainland. 

==Biography==
He was born on January 17, 1889, in Huntington, West Virginia. He graduated from the United States Military Academy in June 1909 and was commissioned an infantry second lieutenant. Emmons was assigned as commanding officer of Company B, 30th Infantry Regiment at the Presidio of San Francisco and in May 1912 went to Fort Gibbon, Alaska with the 30th. He returned to Plattsburg Barracks, New York.

He became a first lieutenant in July 1916 and was detailed to the Signal Corps&#x27; Aviation Section for pilot training in August 1916. He was rated a junior military aviator in May 1917 and became a captain in July. Emmons next served as aeronautical officer of the Western Department at San Francisco and in December went to Washington as assistant executive in the Office of the Chief Signal Officer. The following June, Emmons was promoted to major and went to Mather Field, California. He became a lieutenant colonel in August and in December was transferred to McCook Field in Dayton, Ohio as assistant chief of the Engineering Division.

Emmons transferred to the U.S. Army Air Service in July 1920 and a year later completed the Air Service Course at Harvard University. He returned to McCook Field for three years as chief of Production Engineering. Emmons went to Crissy Field, California in August 1924, where he served as commanding officer, and then to Rockwell Field as commanding officer of the 91st Observation Squadron. He went to Washington, D.C., in August 1927 as executive officer for the chief of the Air Corps. He held the same assignment for the Assistant Secretary of War for Air, F. Trubee Davison, in October 1928. Emmons graduated from the Air Corps Tactical School at Maxwell Air Force Base, Alabama, and the Command and General Staff School at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas.

Emmons was concurrently commanding officer of the 18th Composite Wing and Air Officer of the Hawaiian Department at Fort Shafter in the Hawaiian Islands from March 1934 to July 1936. He became a colonel in March 1935. Emmons returned to the United States in July 1936 as commander of the 1st Wing, General Headquarters Air Force, at March Field, California, with promotion to brigadier general. Emmons received his second star in March 1939 as part of his appointment as commander of the GHQ Air Force at Langley Field, Virginia, succeeding Col. Frank Andrews, who was not reappointed after four years in the position and was returned to his permanent rank.

After the fall of France, the Americans and British increased their military cooperation; Emmons was one of three American military observers sent to London on August 6, 1940. He was promoted to lieutenant general in November 1940 when Army General Headquarters was activated, to make him equal in grade to the field army commanders of GHQ. He retained his command when GHQ Air Force was renamed Air Force Combat Command in June 1941 and made a part of the new United States Army Air Forces. This however caused command difficulties since he was now superior in rank to his boss, Major General Henry Arnold, the new Chief of the Army Air Forces.

Emmons was returned by Arnold to Hawaii as commanding general of the Hawaiian Department on December 17, ten days after the attack on Pearl Harbor. He organized the replacement of the island&#x27;s U.S. banknotes with new dollars overprinted with the word &quot;HAWAII&quot;; if the area were occupied, U.S. authorities could declare all marked dollars void and thereby render worthless all money which fell into enemy hands (by their capture of banks, businesses, etc.). He also requested Army Air Force Headquarters to send additional planes and received them as rapidly as possible. Emmons built up the forces in Hawaii, anticipating the Battle of Midway. This was the only combat command he held during the war. Emmons promised the local Japanese American community in Hawaii that they would be treated fairly so long as they remained loyal to the United States, and he succeeded in blocking efforts to relocate them to the outer islands or mainland in internment camps by pointing out the logistical difficulties.

Returning to the United States in June 1943, Emmons was assigned three months later as commanding general of the Western Defense Command at the Presidio of San Francisco. Emmons headed the Alaskan Department at Fort Richardson from June 1944 until June 1946. He became commandant of the Armed Forces Staff College at Norfolk, Virginia, in August 1946 and remained in that position until he retired June 30, 1948.

==Awards and decorations==

General Emmons&#x27; awards and decorations include the Army Distinguished Service Medal with two Oak Leaf Clusters; Legion of Merit with Oak Leaf Cluster; Distinguished Flying Cross; Air Medal with Oak Leaf Cluster; American Defense Service Medal with Foreign Service Clasp; American Campaign Medal; Asiatic-Pacific Campaign Medal with Bronze Star; World War I Victory Medal; World War II Victory Medal; Mexican Border Service Medal.


==Personal life==
Emmons is the grandson of the co-founder of Huntington, West Virginia, Delos W. Emmons. Which makes Emmons a great-nephew of Collis P. Huntington.

<text>Rabbe Arnfinn Enckell (3 March 1903 – 17 June 1974) was a Finnish writer and poet. Enckell is regarded as one of the stalwarts of the Swedo-Finnish poetic revival that began in the 1920s.

Enckell was born in Tammela, Tavastia Proper. He studied art in France and Italy. In 1923 he brought out his first poetry collection, entitled &quot;Dikter&quot;. It was a collection of impressionistic nature poems. The collection and its sequel, Flöjtblåsarlycka (&quot;The Flutist’s Happiness&quot;), which was published in 1925, were contained Enckell&#x27;s vivid description of the changes in nature. Enckell was a modernist. For a year in 1928-29 he worked for the avant-garde journal &quot;Quosego&quot;. He then wrote a couple of semi-autobiographical novels, which included &quot;Ljusdunkel&quot; (1930). He returned to poetry with the publication of &quot;The Cistern of Spring&quot; (1931). He followed it with &quot;The Sounding Board&quot; (1935). The modernist streak in his poetry prompted comparisons with T.S. Eliot. Enckell brought out another collection of poems, &quot;The Vault&quot;, which was published in 1937. He died in Helsinki, aged 71.

<text>Otto Ender (24 December 1875 – 25 June 1960) was an Austrian political figure. He served as the chancellor of Austria between 1930 and 1931.

==Early life and education==
Ender, the first son of Herman and Victoria Ender, was born in Altach, Vorarlberg. The families of both parents were among the political elite of the village. The maternal great-grandfather, John Walser, was the first superintendent of the municipality created in 1801. The paternal grandfather, Johann Jakob final, had held the same position for 1835–1844 and 1850–1857. From 1861 to 1866 Johann Jacob was a member of the Conservative party in the Parliament of Vorarlberg.

Ender studied at the Stella Matutina Jesuit college in Feldkirch from 1888 to 1896. After matriculation in 1896 he studied at the universities of Innsbruck, Vienna, Prague and Freiburg. In 1901 he received his doctorate from the University of Innsbruck. In 1901–02, he completed a legal internship year at the district court Feldkirch. From 1902 to 1908 he was articled clerk in Feldkirch and Vienna. In 1908 he opened his own law firm in Bregenz. The same year he married Maria Rusch. Thery had four sons and three daughters.

In the following years, Ender became more engaged in the public. He gave lectures on the introduction of the land register. In 1914, he was appointed executive director of the State Mortgage Bank. After the war began, in the summer of 1914, he became head of the state purchasing agency and the Bregenzer branch of the War Grain transportation agency and member of the National Committee of Social Welfare.

From 1915 to 1918, he was a member of the Nutrition Council in Vienna. In 1917/18, he was president of the building committee for the establishment of the sanatorium Gaisbühel. His professional qualifications were recognized in the War years by Media and lawyers. This professional experience was the foundation on which he could build up in the inter-wars period, his successful political career.

==Political career==
In November 1918, he founded an independent self-management of Tyrol Vorarlberg, together with Jodok Fink and Franz Loser. In the four state elections of the First Republic (1919, 1923, 1928 and 1932) he won for his Christian Social Party with 53–63% of the vote. He served as the governor of Vorarlberg from 1918 to 1930 and again from 1931 to 1934. He was the president of the Federal Council of Austria three times in 1920s and 1930s.

After the 1930 legislative election, Ender became Chancellor of Austria on 4 December, however, his cabinet was brought down soon after upon the collapse of the Creditanstalt bank in May 1931. From 1934 to 1938, he was President of the Austrian Court of Audit. In March 1938, his political career ended with the &quot;Anschluss&quot; annexation of Austria by Nazi Germany. He was imprisoned by the Gestapo in March 1938, and remained as such until September 1938. He was forced to retire by Nazi government in 1939 and was expelled from the country.

==Death and legacy==
Otto Ender died on 25 June 1960 and was buried in the municipal cemetery in Bregenz.
To this day, the State of Vorarlberg awards scholarships to the students through the Dr. Otto Ender Foundation.

His achievements are as founder and designer of the province of Vorarlberg, in terms of economic policy such as the establishment of the agricultural district authority, by beginning of the expansion of road network in the 1920s, establishing an agricultural school, expanding of the Vorarlberg water power with the purchase of Vorarlberg&#x27;s power plants, and the establishment of the Vorarlberg Illwerke and by co-operating with the democratic constitutions of 1920 and 1923.

<text>Eamon Joseph O&#x27;Brien (; September 10, 1915 – May 9, 1985) was an American actor of stage, screen, and television, and film director. His career spanned almost 40 years, and he won one Academy Award, two Golden Globe Awards, and two stars on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.

O&#x27;Brien was both leading man and a character actor of American cinema, with his co-starring performances in &quot;The Barefoot Contessa&quot; (1954) and &quot;Seven Days in May&quot; (1964) each earning him the nomination for an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor; he won for his role in &quot;The Barefoot Contessa&quot;. His other notable films include &quot;The Hunchback of Notre Dame&quot; (1939), &quot;The Killers&quot; (1946), &quot;A Double Life&quot; (1947), &quot;White Heat&quot; (1949), &quot;D.O.A.&quot; (1950), &quot;The Hitch-Hiker&quot; (1953), &quot;Julius Caesar&quot; (1953), &quot;1984&quot; (1956), &quot;The Girl Can&#x27;t Help It&quot; (1956), &quot;The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance&quot; (1962), &quot;Fantastic Voyage&quot; (1966), &quot;The Wild Bunch&quot; (1969), and &quot;The Other Side of the Wind&quot; (2018).

==Early years==
O&#x27;Brien was born in Brooklyn, New York, the seventh and youngest child of Agnes (née Baldwin) and James O&#x27;Brien. His parents were natives of Tallow, County Waterford, Ireland. His father died when he was four years old.

O&#x27;Brien performed magic shows for children in his neighborhood, spelling his last name backwards and billing himself as &quot;Neirbo the Great&quot;. An aunt who taught high school English and speech took him to the theatre from an early age and he developed an interest in acting. He began acting in plays at school.

After attending Fordham University for six months, O&#x27;Brien went to Neighborhood Playhouse School of the Theatre on a scholarship. O&#x27;Brien studied for two years under such teachers as Sanford Meisner; his classmates included Betty Garrett. &quot;It was simply the best training in the world for a young actor, singer or dancer,&quot; O&#x27;Brien said, adding that &quot;(w)hat these teachers encouraged above all was getting your tools ready – your body, your voice, your speech.&quot;

O&#x27;Brien took classes with the Columbia Laboratory Players group, which emphasized training in Shakespeare.

==Career==
===Theatre===
O&#x27;Brien began working in summer stock in Yonkers. He made his first Broadway appearance at age 21 in &quot;Daughters of Atreus.&quot;

He played a grave digger in &quot;Hamlet,&quot; toured in &quot;Parnell,&quot; and then appeared in Maxwell Anderson&#x27;s &quot;The Star Wagon&quot; with stars Lillian Gish and Burgess Meredith. In 1940, O&#x27;Brien performed with Ruth Chatterton in John Van Druten&#x27;s &quot;Leave Her to Heaven&quot; on Broadway. Twelve years later, O&#x27;Brien appeared in Van Druten&#x27;s &quot;I&#x27;ve Got Sixpence.&quot;

===Film===
O&#x27;Brien&#x27;s theatre work attracted the attention of Pandro Berman at RKO. Berman offered O&#x27;Brien the role of a romantic lead in &quot;The Hunchback of Notre Dame&quot; (1939).

O&#x27;Brien returned to Broadway to play Mercutio opposite Laurence Olivier and Vivien Leigh in &quot;Romeo and Juliet.&quot;

RKO offered O&#x27;Brien a long-term contract. His roles included a feature spot in &quot;A Girl, a Guy, and a Gob&quot; and the co-male lead in &quot;Parachute Battalion,&quot; both released in 1941. The latter starred Nancy Kelly, whom O&#x27;Brien would later marry.

O&#x27;Brien played the lead in &quot;Obliging Young Lady,&quot; with Eve Arden, and was featured in &quot;Powder Town.&quot; In May 1942, Universal bought out O&#x27;Brien&#x27;s contract with RKO so he could star opposite Deanna Durbin in &quot;The Amazing Mrs. Holliday&quot; (1943). After that, O&#x27;Brien joined the armed services.

===World War II===
During World War II, he served in the U.S. Army Air Forces and appeared in the Air Forces&#x27; Broadway play &quot;Winged Victory&quot;. He was joined in the Moss Hart production by Red Buttons, Karl Malden, Kevin McCarthy, Gary Merrill, Barry Nelson and Martin Ritt. The play was filmed in 1944 with O&#x27;Brien reprising his stage performance and Judy Holliday co-starring. O&#x27;Brien toured for two years in the stage production, appearing alongside a young Mario Lanza.

===Universal===
O’Brien returned to the screen full time with Universal Studios, playing the insurance investigator in film noir &quot;The Killers&quot; in 1946. He followed that with the lead in &quot;The Web&quot;, and the second lead in &quot;A Double Life&quot;, both 1947 noirs.

He had a second lead in the screen version of Lillian Hellman&#x27;s drama &quot;Another Part of the Forest.&quot; He then starred in the romantic comedy &quot;For the Love of Mary&quot;, the World War II set &quot;Fighter Squadron&quot;, and the noir &quot;An Act of Murder&quot;, all in 1948.

===Warner Bros.===
In late 1948, O&#x27;Brien signed a long-term contract with Warner Bros., which cast him as the undercover police officer in &quot;White Heat&quot; (1949) opposite James Cagney. &quot;He [Cagney] said he had only one rule&quot;, O&#x27;Brien noted. &quot;He would tap his heart and he would say, &#x27;Play it from here, kid.&#x27; He always did and I believe it&#x27;s the best rule for any performer. He could play a scene 90 ways and never repeat himself. He did this to keep himself fresh. I try to do this whenever possible.&quot;

In 1949, 3,147 members of the Young Women&#x27;s League of America, a national charitable organisation devoted to single living, voted that O&#x27;Brien had more &quot;male magnetism&quot; than any other man in America. &quot;All women adore ruggedness,&quot; league president Shirley Connolly said. &quot;Edmund O&#x27;Brien&#x27;s magnetic appearance and personality most fully stir women&#x27;s imaginative impulses. We&#x27;re all agreed that he has more male magnetism than any of the 60,000,000 men in the United States today.&quot; (Runners-up were Ezio Pinza, William O&#x27;Dwyer and Doak Walker.)

OBrien&#x27;s contract with Warner Brothers ended following his appearance as the second lead in &quot;Backfire&quot; (shot in 1948 but not released until 1950).

===Freelance===
O&#x27;Brien returned to film noir, where he was a frequent player, and made one of his most famous movies, &quot;D.O.A.,&quot; where he portrays a man investigating his own murder. He followed this with the lead in the noir &quot;711 Ocean Drive&quot; (1950). Next was a starring role in the comedy &quot;The Admiral Was a Lady&quot;, co-starring roles in the noir &quot;Between Midnight and Dawn&quot; (1950) and the Western &quot;The Redhead and the Cowboy&quot; (1951), then the leads in the crime film &quot;Two of a Kind&quot; and the Westerns &quot;Warpath&quot; and &quot;Silver City&quot;, all in 1951.

These were followed by the lead in the Western &quot;Denver and Rio Grande&quot;, and second lead in the noir &quot;The Turning Point&quot;.

However, even though O&#x27;Brien still managed to command leading man roles, the prestige of his pictures and casts had begun to diminish and his career hit a slump. According to TCM, &quot;In the early &#x27;50s, O&#x27;Brien started struggling with his weight, which could change significantly between films. He had no problems if that relegated him to character roles, but for a few years, &quot;it was hard to come by anything really first rate.&quot;

&quot;The funny thing about Hollywood is that they are interested in having you do one thing and do it well and do it ever after,&quot; said O&#x27;Brien. &quot;That&#x27;s the sad thing about being a leading man – while the rewards may be great in fame and finances, it becomes monotonous for an actor. I think that&#x27;s why some of the people who are continually playing themselves are not happy.&quot;

He still made some notable movies, including the lead in two for Ida Lupino, &quot;The Hitch-Hiker&quot; and &quot;The Bigamist&quot;, and as a featured player as Casca in Joseph L. Mankiewicz&#x27;s ensemble film of &quot;Julius Caesar&quot; (1953). And the leads again in, &quot;China Venture&quot; (1953), &quot;Shield for Murder&quot; (1954), and &quot;The Shanghai Story&quot; (1954).

O&#x27;Brien also worked heavily in television at this time, on such shows as &quot;Pulitzer Prize Playhouse&quot;, &quot;Lux Video Theatre&quot; and &quot;Schlitz Playhouse of Stars&quot;. He announced plans to direct his own films.

In 1951 he was in a well-publicized brawl with Serge Rubinstein at a cafe.

From 1950 to 1952, O&#x27;Brien starred in the radio drama &quot;Yours Truly, Johnny Dollar&quot;, playing the title role. His other work in radio included &quot;Philip Morris Playhouse on Broadway&quot;.

In spite of the ups and downs of his Hollywood career, O&#x27;Brien was still capable of greatness, both on the stage and on film. In 1954 Mankiewicz cast O&#x27;Brien as press agent Oscar Muldoon in &quot;The Barefoot Contessa,&quot; earning him an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor.

O&#x27;Brien followed this with a number of important roles, including the second lead in the musical crime film &quot;Pete Kelly&#x27;s Blues&quot;, the lead in the dystopian political movie &quot;1984&quot; and the noir &quot;A Cry in the Night&quot; (1956), co-lead in the World War II drama &quot;D-Day the Sixth of June&quot; and the lead in the comedy &quot;The Girl Can&#x27;t Help It&quot;, all in 1956.

In 1957 O&#x27;Brien earned the second lead in the Western &quot;The Big Land&quot;, film noir &quot;Stopover Tokyo&quot;, and the second lead in the musical drama &quot;Sing, Boy, Sing&quot; and lead in the drama &quot;The World Was His Jury&quot; in 1958. In 1959 he co-starred in the World War II drama &quot;Up Periscope&quot; and the melodrama &quot;The Restless and the Damned&quot;.

===Television===

O&#x27;Brien appeared extensively in television, including the 1957 live 90-minute broadcast on &quot;Playhouse 90&quot; of &quot;The Comedian&quot;, a drama written by Rod Serling and directed by John Frankenheimer in which Mickey Rooney portrayed dictatorial television comedian Sammy Hogarth. O&#x27;Brien played Al Preston, the show&#x27;s headwriter driven to the brink of insanity. Burned out dealing with the volatle Hogarth, unable to come up with new material for the show&#x27;s comedy sketches, Preston deliberately plagiarizes material authored by a young comedy writer who died in combat during World War II. When the ruse is discovered, Preston is fired, but tells Hogarth his rages are rooted in his inability to find love.

In 1958 he directed and starred in a TV drama written by his brother, &quot;The Town That Slept With the Lights On&quot;, about two Lancaster murders that so frightened the community that residents began sleeping with their lights on.

From 1959 to 1960, O&#x27;Brien portrayed the title role in the syndicated crime drama &quot;Johnny Midnight&quot;, about a New York City actor-turned-private detective. The producers refused to cast him unless he shed at least 50 pounds, so he went on a crash vegetarian diet and quit drinking.

&quot;I seldom get very far away from crime,&quot; he recalled. &quot;I&#x27;ve found it pays … I tried non-crime films like &quot;Another Part of the Forest&quot; … good picture, good cast, but no good at the box office … But you just put a gun in your hands and run through the streets doing cops and robbers and you&#x27;re all set.&quot;

O&#x27;Brien also had his own production company, O&#x27;Brien-Frazen.

He made a French film, &quot;The Restless and the Damned&quot; for a fee more than $200,000. He was cast on the strength of his performance in &quot;The Girl Can&#x27;t Help It&quot; and his Oscar.

O&#x27;Brien had roles on many television series, including an appearance on &quot;&quot;, &quot;The Eleventh Hour&quot;, &quot;Breaking Point&quot; and &quot;&quot;.

===1960s film work===
O&#x27;Brien walked off the set of &quot;The Last Voyage&quot; in protest at safety issues during the shoot. He later came back and found out that his co-starring role had been trimmed. He was cast as American reporter Jackson Bentley in &quot;Lawrence of Arabia&quot; (1962), but had a heart attack during filming and was replaced in the co-starring role by Arthur Kennedy.

O&#x27;Brien recovered to direct his first feature &quot;Man-Trap&quot; (1961), a neo-noir starring Jeffrey Hunter and Stella Stevens, co-starred in the Disney comedy &quot;Moon Pilot&quot; (1962), and in the star-studded ensemble cast of the World War II epic &quot;The Longest Day&quot; (1962).

He continued to receive good roles, co-starring in &quot;The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance&quot; (1962) and as the author of the Robert Stroud biography the &quot;Birdman of Alcatraz&quot; (1962) was based upon.

&quot;I&#x27;ve never made any kind of personality success,&quot; he admitted in a 1963 interview. &quot;People never say &#x27;that&#x27;s an Eddie O&#x27;Brien part.&#x27; They say, &#x27;That&#x27;s a part Eddie O&#x27;Brien can play.&#x27;&quot;

&quot;I&#x27;d like to be able to say something important,&quot; he added. &quot;To say something to people about their relationship with each other. If it touches just one guy, helps illustrate some points of view about living, then you&#x27;ve accomplished something.&quot;

Though his star would soon begin to dim, and his name occasionally slip further down in the billing, O&#x27;Brien could still deliver in the right role. His sweaty performance as a heroic U.S. senator in the tense political drama &quot;Seven Days in May&quot; (1964) earned him a second Oscar nomination.

In the mid-&#x27;60s, O&#x27;Brien co-starred with Roger Mobley and Harvey Korman in the &quot;Gallegher&quot; episodes of NBC TV&#x27;s &quot;Walt Disney&#x27;s Wonderful World of Color&quot;. From 1963 to 1965, he co-starred in the NBC legal drama &quot;Sam Benedict&quot;.

O&#x27;Brien worked steadily in both film and television throughout the late 1960s and early 1970s, however his memory problems were beginning to take their toll. A heart attack forced him to drop out of &quot;The Glass Bottom Boat&quot; (1966). He had a memorable role as the decrepit but boisterous Freddie Sykes in Sam Peckinpah&#x27;s groundbreaking revisionist western &quot;The Wild Bunch&quot; (1969).

===Later career===
&quot;It would be awfully hard to do a series again,&quot; he said in a 1971 interview. &quot;I wouldn&#x27;t go for an hour show again. They don&#x27;t have much of a chance against the movies.&quot;

He was a cast member of &quot;The Other Side of the Wind&quot;, Orson Welles&#x27; unfinished 1970s movie that finally was released in 2018.

In 1971, he was hospitalized with a &quot;slight pulmonary condition.&quot;

His last works, both in 1974, were an episode of the television series &quot;Police Story&quot; and main role in the film &quot;99 and 44/100% Dead&quot;.

===Recording===
In 1957 O&#x27;Brien recorded a spoken-word album of &quot;The Red Badge of Courage&quot; (Caedmon TC 1040). Billboard said, &quot;Edmond O&#x27;Brien brings intensity in the narrative portions and successfully impersonates the varied characters in dialog.&quot;

==Personal life==
O&#x27;Brien was first married to actress Nancy Kelly from 1941 until 1942. He married his second wife, actress Olga San Juan in 1948. San Juan was the mother of his three children, television producer Bridget O&#x27;Brien and actors Maria O&#x27;Brien and Brendan O&#x27;Brien. The marriage ended in divorce in 1976.

In the late 1970s, O&#x27;Brien fell ill with Alzheimer&#x27;s disease. In a 1983 interview, his daughter Maria remembers seeing her father in a straitjacket at a Veterans&#x27; Hospital: &quot;He was screaming. He was violent. I remember noticing how thin he&#x27;d gotten. We didn&#x27;t know, because for years he&#x27;d been sleeping with all his clothes on. We saw him a little later and he was walking around like all the other lost souls there.&quot;

==Death==
Edmond O&#x27;Brien died on May 9, 1985, at St. Erne&#x27;s Sanitorium in Inglewood, California, of complications from Alzheimer&#x27;s disease at age 69.

==Walk of Fame==
For his contribution to the motion picture industry, Edmond O&#x27;Brien has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 1725 Vine Street, and a second star at 6523 Hollywood Blvd. for his contribution to the television industry. Both were dedicated on February 8, 1960.

<text>William Crowninshield Endicott (November 19, 1826 – May 6, 1900) was an American politician and Secretary of War in the first administration of President Grover Cleveland (1885–1889).

==Early life==

Endicott was born in Salem, Massachusetts on November 19, 1826. He was a son of William Putnam Endicott and Mary (née Crowninshield) Endicott. He was a direct descendant of the Massachusetts governor, John Endecott, and a first cousin three times removed of another Massachusetts governor, Endicott Peabody.

He graduated from Harvard University in 1847 and attended Harvard Law School in 1849–1850. He studied law with Nathaniel J. Lord prior to his admission to the Massachusetts bar in 1850.

==Career==
In 1852, he was elected a member of the Salem Common Council and, five years later, became City Solicitor. He was elected a member of the American Antiquarian Society in 1862. In 1853, he entered into a law partnership with J. W. Perry under the name Perry &amp; Endicott, which was dissolved in 1873 upon his appointment to the bench. From 1857 to 1873, also served as president of the Salem Bank.

In 1873, Endicott, although a Democrat (and originally a Whig), was appointed by Republican governor William B. Washburn to the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court, where he served until 1882. In 1879, he unsuccessfully ran for Congress, followed by an unsuccessful gubernatorial race in 1884. Grover Cleveland appointed Endicott Secretary of War and he served in that capacity in the administration between 1885 and 1889. Endicott oversaw many important changes in the organization of the United States Army, including the establishment of a system of examinations to determine the promotion of officers.

Endicott convened and chaired the Board of Fortifications in 1885 (usually called the Endicott Board), which would provide detailed recommendations and designs for the generation of American coastal defense fortifications constructed in the era of the Spanish–American War. Most of these Endicott Period fortifications served through early World War II.

==Personal life==
On December 13, 1859, Endicott was married to Ellen Peabody (1833–1927) in Salem. Ellen was the daughter of philanthropist George Peabody and Clarissa Peabody of Salem. Her grandfather was the distinguished Salem ship owner, Joseph Peabody, who made a fortune importing pepper from Sumatra and was one of the wealthiest men in the United States at the time of his death in 1900. Together, William and Ellen had two children:

* William Crowninshield Endicott Jr. (1860–1936), a lawyer who married Marie Louise Thoron (1864–1958), daughter of Joseph Thoron and Anna Barker (née Ward) Thoron, in 1889. William C. Endicott Jr. was the president of the Massachusetts Historical Society for ten years.
* Mary Crowninshield Endicott (1864–1957), who married the British statesman Joseph Chamberlain in 1888. After his death, she married the Anglican clergyman William Hartley Carnegie (1859–1936), in 1916.

Endicott died of acute pneumonia in Boston, Massachusetts on May 6, 1900. His wife lived another twenty-seven years, until her death in Boston on August 20, 1927, after which she was buried with William in the Endicott Lot at Harmony Grove Cemetery in Salem.

<text>Harry Lane Englebright (January 2, 1884 – May 13, 1943) was a U.S. political figure. He represented California&#x27;s 2nd congressional district from 1926 to 1943, and was the House Minority Whip from 1933 to 1943.

Englebright was born in Nevada City, California. His father, William F. Englebright, also served in the United States House of Representatives. Harry Englebright attended the University of California, Berkeley and became a mining engineer before entering politics; he was connected with various mining enterprises in California and was an engineer for the State Conservation Commission from 1911 to 1914.

<text>Diane English (born May 18, 1948) is an American screenwriter, producer and director. She is best known for creating the television show &quot;Murphy Brown&quot; which won multiple awards, including 18 Primetime Emmy Awards from 62 nominations. She also wrote and directed the 2008 feature film &quot;The Women&quot;. She has won numerous awards, including 3 Emmy Awards, and received numerous nominations.

==Early life==
English was born in Buffalo, New York, the daughter of Anne English and Richard English who was an electrical engineer. She graduated from Nardin Academy in Buffalo, and then from Buffalo State College in 1970.

==Career==
English began her career at WNET, the PBS affiliate in New York City, working first as a story editor for &quot;The Theatre in America&quot; series, and then as associate director of &quot;TV Lab&quot;. From 1977 to 1980, she wrote a monthly column on television for &quot;Vogue&quot; magazine.

In 1980, she co-wrote PBS&#x27; &quot;The Lathe of Heaven&quot;, an adaptation of Ursula K. Le Guin&#x27;s science fiction novel of the same name, and received her first Writers Guild Award Nomination. She followed that with the television movies &quot;Her Life as a Man&quot; (1984) and &quot;Classified Love&quot; (1986).

In 1985, English created &quot;Foley Square&quot;, her first half-hour comedy series, which aired on CBS during the 1985-1986 television season. It starred Margaret Colin, Hector Elizondo, Michael Lembeck and Jon Lovitz. The show premiered on December 11, 1985, and languished near the bottom of the Nielsen ratings in the weeks that followed. After being put on hiatus after only 11 episodes, CBS rescheduled it to another night and aired the three remaining episodes of the season. With ratings low, CBS cancelled the show after only 14 episodes with the last episode airing on April 8, 1986. During 1986 and 1987, English executive produced and wrote the CBS comedy series &quot;My Sister Sam&quot;, starring Pam Dawber which lasted for two seasons with 12 episodes that never aired before being cancelled.

In 1988, she created the CBS television series &quot;Murphy Brown&quot;, for which she won three Emmy Awards (one for Outstanding Writing in a Comedy Series and two for Outstanding Comedy Series). The series ran from 1988 to 1998 for a total of 247 episodes. It garnered 18 Emmy wins from 62 nominations. In 1992, English stirred up controversy when the title character decided to have a child out of wedlock. Vice president Dan Quayle gave a speech entitled &quot;Reflections on Urban America to the Commonwealth Club of California&quot; on the subject of the Los Angeles riots. In this speech, Quayle blamed the violence on a decay of moral values and family structure in American society. In an aside, he cited the title character in the television program Murphy Brown as an example of how popular culture contributes to this &quot;poverty of values&quot;, saying, &quot;It doesn&#x27;t help matters when prime time TV has Murphy Brown – a character who supposedly epitomizes today&#x27;s intelligent, highly paid, professional woman – mocking the importance of fathers, by bearing a child alone, and calling it just another &#x27;lifestyle choice&#x27;.

English responded with a statement that read: &quot;If the vice president thinks it&#x27;s disgraceful for an unmarried woman to bear children (out of wedlock), and if he believes that a woman cannot adequately raise a child without a father, then he&#x27;d better make sure abortion remains safe and legal.&quot; In 2002, Candice Bergen, the actress who played Brown, said &quot;I never have really said much about the whole episode, which was endless, but his speech was a perfectly intelligent speech about fathers not being dispensable and nobody agreed with that more than I did.&quot; This controversy along with the shifting times of that decade touched off a debate over the meaning of &quot;family values&quot; of Americans during that election year in which Bill Clinton and Al Gore ran against George H. W. Bush and Dan Quayle.

During the success of &quot;Murphy Brown&quot;, her company, with Joel Shukovsky, Shukovsky English Entertainment, had set up a deal with CBS for a non-exclusive deal, giving them exclusive syndicated rights to future Shukovsky/English series, in 1991.

English also created the comedy series &quot;Love &amp; War&quot; (1992–1995), starring Susan Dey and Jay Thomas - Annie Potts replaced Dey after the first season. Other series she co-created and/or executive produced include &quot; Double Rush&quot; (1995), &quot;Ink&quot; (1996), and &quot;The Louie Show&quot;, starring Louie Anderson (1996), and &quot;Living in Captivity&quot; (1998). Unfortunately, none of the series were picked up for more than a single season with &quot;The Louie Show&quot; lasting six episodes. As for &quot;Ink&quot;, she took over the role from Jeffrey Lane, who initially came up with the concept of the series.

In 2008, English wrote, produced and directed &quot;The Women&quot;, her feature film debut. The comedy, a remake of the 1939 George Cukor film of the same name, stars Meg Ryan, Annette Bening, Eva Mendes, Debra Messing, and Jada Pinkett Smith. It was released to mostly negative reviews but its box office tripled its budget when worldwide markets were factored in.
That same year English and the ensemble cast of &quot;The Women&quot; were honored with the Women in Film Crystal award which honors women in communications and media.

<text>was one of the first Buddhist temples in Japan, and was ranked as one of the powerful Seven Great Temples, in Nara, Japan. It was mostly destroyed in the Muromachi period and the old town of Naramachi occupies most of what was once the temple&#x27;s precincts. Three small portions of the temple have survived to the present day, and each is now a separate temple. 

==History==
With the relocation of the capital to Heijō-kyō in 710, the temples of Yakushi-ji, Umayasaka-ji (later Kofuku-ji), Daikandai-ji (later Daian-ji), and other temples in Asua were moved to the new capital. Hōkō-ji (Asuka-dera) was also moved to Heijō-kyō in 718, but the original Hōkō-ji in Asuka was not abolished and remained in its original location. The temple in Asuka retained the name &quot;Hōkō-ji&quot; or &quot;Hon-Gankō-ji,&quot; while the temple in Heijō-kyō was named &quot;Gangō-ji (or Shin-Gankō-ji).&quot; During the Nara period, Gangō-ji was a major establishment, similar in size to Tōdai-ji, and was the main seminary for both the Sanron and the Hosso sects. The temple complex was a complete &quot;Shichidō garan&quot; with a Great South Gate, Central Gate, Main Hall, Lecture Hall, Bell tower, and [Kuri|Dining Hall]], all lined up in a straight line from north to south. A corridor stretched from the left and right sides of the Central Gate, surrounding the Main Hall and reaching the left and right sides of the Lecture Hall. Outside the corridor, to the east was Eastern Pagoda Compound, which was centered around a five-story pagoda, and to the west was the Small Pagoda Compound. In addition, there were several buildings where monks lived on each side behind the Lecture Hall. These were long tenement-like buildings running east to west, and the monks&#x27; quarters on the east side were remodeled during the Kamakura period to become the new Main Hall and Zen room of Gokurakubō.

The temple grounds were long and narrow, stretching from north to south for four &quot;chō&quot; (approximately 440 meters) and east to west for 2 &quot;chō&quot; (approximately 220 meters). The area south of Sarusawa-ike Pond, south of Kofuku-ji, and today commonly known as &quot;Naramachi&quot; (Nara Town), was originally the grounds of Gangō-ji. 

After the capital was relocated to Heian-kyō, Gangō-ji gradually fell into decline. Newer Buddhist sects, such as Tendai and Shingon had supplanted Sanron and Hosso, and with the collapse of the Ritsuryō system in the mid-Heian period (10th to 11th centuries), the temple lost control of the estates on which it depended for support. Historical records from this period, such as the &quot;Dosha Sonshiki Kenrokucho&quot; (Record of the Reconstruction of Temples and Buildings) from 1035, state that many of the buildings, including the main hall, were in ruins, and that the head priest of the temple had been reduced to selling the temple&#x27;s treasures in order to maintain the temple. According to a record from 1246, the fourth and fifth stories of the five-story pagoda and its spire had been lost by this time, and the Great South Gate and bell tower had been severely damaged. In 1451, during the Muromachi period, a peasant uprising set the Small Pagoda Compound on fire, and the flames spread to the entire temple. The five-story pagoda survived, but other main buildings such as the Main Hall were destroyed. Although the Main Hall was rebuilt, it was destroyed again by a strong wind 1472, and was never rebuilt again. After this, houses were built on the ruins, and by the end of the Muromachi period, the temple had split into three separate temples, each centered on one of the remaining components of the original temple.

==Gangō-ji Gokuraku-in (Gokurakubō)==
The is the Shingon-Ritsu sect successor to Gangō-ji. It is centered on the Gokuraku-dō (Mandala-dō), which enshrines the Chiko Mandala as its &quot;honzon&quot;. The Chiko Mandara is a mandala depicting the Pure Land with Amida Nyorai in the center, drawn by the Nara period scholar-monk Chiko, which from the late Heian period began to attract worshippers with the popularity of the idea of the end of the world and the rise of the Amida Pure Land faith. The hall in which the mandala was enshrined was called Gokuraku-in, and gradually developed into a sub-temple of Gangō-ji. It was remodeled in the Kamakura period from the monks&#x27; quarters where Chiko and other monks had lived during the Nara period. This building, along with the &quot;Zen room&quot; are now designated National Treasures and is collectively registered as a World Heritage Site as part of the “Historic Monuments of Ancient Nara“. The Gokuraku-in was renamed &quot;Gangō-ji Gokurakubō&quot; in 1955, and then &quot;Gangō-ji&quot; in 1977. The precincts of the Gokurakubō is one of the three parts of the ancient temple complex to be protected as a National Historic Site in 1965.

==Gangō-ji Pagoda Site==
The are located in the Shiba Araya-chō neighborhood the &quot;old town&quot; area of Naramachi in the city of Nara. It also is one of the three parts of the ancient temple complex to be protected as a National Historic Site in 1932. The remains of the pagoda is now sandwiched between private houses. The pagoda&#x27;s base is 17.7 meters on each side, 90-centimeters high, and surrounded by stone walls, with 17 foundation stones remaining. Based on the remaining foundation stones and sketches from the Edo period, the pagoda was a five-story pagoda with a side length of about 10 meters, a central length of 3.8 meters between the three pillars of the first floor, and 3.19 meters between both sides. Based on jewels, copper coins, altar implements unearthed around the central stone during an archaeological excavation in 1927, it is estimated that the pagoda was constructed in the late 8th century, about 50 years after the capital was moved to Heijō-kyō. It is about a 10-minute walk from Kintetsu Nara Station on the Kintetsu Nara Line. The Eastern Pagoda Compound became a Kegon sect temple centered on the pagoda and a Kannon-do, which housed a famous statue of Kannon Bosatsu formerly housed in the Central Gate. The pagoda was destroyed by a fire in 1859, and the temple fell into disrepair and was abandoned in the early Meiji period. Artifacts excavated from the earthen platform of the Gangō-ji pagoda site and a standing statue of Yakushi Nyorai (National Treasure) have been entrusted to the Nara National Museum. 

==Small Pagoda Complex==
The was the third of the successor temples to Gangō-ji and was also designated a National Historic Site in 1965. The Small Pagoda Compound was initially constructed by Empress Shōtoku within the intent that it would house one million small wooden votive pagodas to pray for the souls of those who died in the Fujiwara no Nakamaro Rebellion. It. According to an article from 834 in the &quot;Shoku Nihon Kōki&quot;, it was located to the southwest of the main Gangō-ji temple complex, symmetrically positioned opposite the larger East Pagoda complex, and consisted of a small pagoda with a prayer hall to the south, three other buildings with a cypress bark roof, and a gate. It from this location that the fire of October 1451 which destroyed the complete Gangō-ji complex originated. The current structure is a Shingon-Ritsu chapel to Kokuzō Bosatsu built in 1707. A small wooden five-story pagoda from that time, about 5.5 meters high, is still in the possession of Gangō-ji Temple is designated as a National Treasure as it conveys the architectural style of five-story pagodas from the Nara period. Within the temple grounds, is a &quot;hōkyōintō&quot; stone pagoda from the late Kamakura period, which is a memorial tower for Gomei, a priest who was active between the Nara and Heian periods. Gomei was a member of the Hata clan and perfected Hosso doctrine at Gangō-ji. He was appointed as a monk in 827 and passed away at Shoto-in in 834, so he is also known as Shōtō-in Sōmei.

=== In the &quot;Man&#x27;yōshū&quot; ===

The &quot;Man&#x27;yōshū&quot; includes a poem attributed to a monk of Gango-ji. This poet laments that, having attained enlightenment, his greater understanding remains unnoticed by others in the streets of Nara. His poem may perhaps bemoan his undervalued condition—and yet, in a modest way, his words transport contemporary readers momentarily back to share his quiet, 8th century perspective:

:::A White gem unknown of men –
::: Be it so if no one knows!
:::Since I myself know its worth
:::Although no other –
:::Be it so if no one knows!
:::: – A monk of the Gango-ji Temple

<text>Martin Ennals (27 July 19275 October 1991) was a British human rights activist. 
Ennals served as the secretary-general of Amnesty International from 1968 to 1980. He went on to help found the British human rights organisation ARTICLE 19 in 1987 and International Alert in 1985.

During Ennals&#x27;s tenure as secretary general, Amnesty International was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize, the Erasmus Prize, and the UN Human Rights Award.

== Early life and career ==

Born in 1927 in Walsall, Staffordshire to Arthur Ford Ennals and his wife Jessie Edith Taylor. Ennals was educated at Queen Mary&#x27;s Grammar School and the London School of Economics, where he received a degree in international relations. Ennals worked for the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation (UNESCO) from 1951 to 1959. In 1959, Ennals became a founding member of the Anti-Apartheid Movement, and also became secretary general of the National Council for Civil Liberties, a position that he held until 1966, when he became information and publications officer of the Commission for Racial Equality.

Ennals became Secretary General of Amnesty International in 1968. At the time, the organization had 7 staff and an annual budget of £17&#x27;000. Twelve years later, the staff had grown to 150 with an annual budget of £2 million. Ennals represented an era where Amnesty became a human rights organization of global concern. Amnesty was awarded the Erasmus Prize in 1976, the Nobel Peace Prize in 1977, and the UN Human Rights Award in 1978. Ennals had other people accept the prizes on behalf of Amnesty.

In 1982 Ennals led the founding assembly of HURIDOCS and was its founding President.

In 1986 Ennals became the first secretary general of International Alert.

Ennals had two elder brothers, John and David. David Ennals was a British Labour Party politician who served as Secretary of State for Social Services, while John Ennals was Chairman of the Anti-Apartheid Movement from 1968 to 1976.

==Award==
The Martin Ennals Award for Human Rights Defenders, created in 1993, is granted annually to someone who has demonstrated an exceptional record of combating human rights violations by courageous means and is in need of protection. The award gives international &quot;protective publicity&quot; to human rights defenders around the world, mainly in their country of origin (a unique characteristic of this award, and very important from a protection point of view), through too much mass media (television, radio and internet). The winner is selected in Geneva, the world center for human rights, by a jury made up of 10 leading international human rights organisations, such as Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch, Frontline, International Commission of Jurists, HURIDOCS, etc.

The Martin Ennals Award is considered &quot;the&quot; award of the whole human rights movement. It is known as &quot;the Nobel prize for human rights&quot;. The Annual Ceremony organised with the City of Geneva is an event with world Internet and TV coverage.

<text>Daniel Jacobus Erasmus (nickname &#x27;van Straten&#x27;/&#x27;van Straat&#x27;, Somerset East, Cape Colony, 1830 - Bethal District, Transvaal, 1913) was a South African Boer commander and politician. He was a member of the Transvaal Volksraad and served as the acting president of Transvaal between 1871 and 1872. His plan to unite the South African Republic and the Orange Free State failed. In the Second Boer War (1899 - 1902) he was one of the commanders in charge of the defense of Pretoria.

==Family history==
The history of the Erasmus family began in 1688 when Pieter Erasmus arrived in Cape Town in 1688. He settled into a farm called &quot;Groenkloof&quot;, located in Drakenstein. Pieter married Maria Elisabeth Joosten in 1691. The couple had six children. Pieter roamed a great deal to look for cultivable land, a trait that his descendant, Daniel Jacobus Erasmus (not the same person who acted as State President), inherited. It was Daniel Jacobus Erasmus and his family who among the first to occupy the land that in time became modern-day Pretoria.

In 1841, the 56 year old Daniel &quot;Swartkoppies&quot; Jacobus Erasmus (1785 - 1861) arrived with his family in the area that is now Centurion, South Africa. The area in Centurion including the Midvaal area was originally occupied by the Mogale clan and still has an active land claim over it. This land was seized and they were forcibly removed. A later retelling of history says they sold the land. Like his ancestor Pieter, Daniel moved into a farm, which he named Zwartkop/Swartkoppies after his nickname. But unlike his pioneering ancestor Daniel didn&#x27;t find the farm site on his own. The place was recommended to him by his eldest son Daniel Elardus Erasmus. Elardus had happened into the area during an elephant hunt in 1831. He had found the area congenial for farming: there were great grazing grounds, pristine rivers and the absence of malaria. Taking his son&#x27;s advice, Daniel acquired a large piece of land and settled down. Daniel Elardus Erasmus (1815 - 1875) settled on the farm Doornpoort in the area that is now known as Irene and other members of the family acquired other farms around the Pretoria area.

==Young years==
&#x27;van Straat&#x27; Erasmus was born on April 5, 1830 in the later Bedford, South Africa district in the Eastern Cape to Lourens Johannes Erasmus (born January 16, 1800) and Johanna Elisabeth van Straten (born January 3, 1807) who were Voortrekkers and fought the Zulus in Natal. Lourens Erasmus moved from Natal to eastern Transvaal before 1842 to settle on the Steelpoort River and was Volksraad member and field cornet for Ohrigstad. He then moved to the upper part of the Elands River near the later Premier Mine. 

==Career==
His son Daniel Jacobus Erasmus fought for the government in the Transvaal civil war (1862-1864) against Stephanus Schoeman. The Transvaal Volksraad elected Daniel Erasmus to its executive council on June 21, 1870. After the Keate Award in October 1871 (the British seizure of the Kimberley diamond fields by Robert W. Keate, then Lieutenant-Governor of the British Colony of Natal), Transvaal president Marthinus Wessel Pretorius resigned and the Volksraad chose Erasmus as acting state president on November 21, 1871.

===Acting President 1871-1872===
As president Erasmus protested against the Keate Award and the southwestern boundaries, sent a commission under Piet Joubert to settle relations with the Swazi people, and introduced obligatory printed passes for Bantu individuals wishing to leave the Transvaal. He proposed treaties of trade and friendship with the new German emperor William I and with Orange Free State, drafted with its president Johannes Brand, and also a secret offensive and defensive alliance with the Orange Free State. Only the trade and friendship treaty with the Orange Free State was ratified by both states in May and August 1871. However, Erasmus&#x27; plan to unite the South African Republic and the Orange Free State failed. Brand was invited to accept the candidature for the Transvaal presidency by a delegation presenting 2,886 Transvaal signatures in support. But Brand declined and proposed Reverend Thomas François Burgers of Hanover instead who was duly elected, in spite of the opposition by Erasmus and Paul Kruger. Erasmus stayed on the Transvaal executive council but resigned soon after Burgers assumed office on July 1, 1872.

===Middelburg===
In 1883 he was commander of the Middelburg Commando in the war against the native Mapog (father of Nyabêla), and represented Middelburg in the Transvaal Volksraad from 1884 to 1886. He was a member of the commission establishing the boundary between the Transvaal and Portuguese East Africa. In the Second Boer War (1899 - 1902) he was one of the commanders in charge of the defense of Pretoria.

==Private life==
Erasmus married twice, first to Margaretha Maria Steenkamp (died 1874) and later to Hebra (Helena) Margaretha Smuts, who together gave him some eight children. The eldest son, Louw Erasmus, was killed during the Second Boer War in the Battle of Bakenlaagte on October 30, 1901.

<text>Hugh Emrys Griffith (30 May 1912 – 14 May 1980) was a Welsh actor. Described by BFI Screenonline as a &quot;wild-eyed, formidable character player&quot;, Griffith appeared in more than 100 theatre, film, and television productions in a career that spanned over 40 years. He was the second-ever Welsh-born actor to win an Academy Award (following Ray Milland for &quot;The Lost Weekend&quot;), winning a Best Supporting Actor Oscar for his role in &quot;Ben-Hur&quot; (1959), with an additional nomination for &quot;Tom Jones&quot; (1963). 

As a stage actor, he was a renowned Shakespearean and a member of the Royal Shakespeare Company, and was nominated for Tony Award for Best Actor in a Play for the original production &quot;Look Homeward, Angel&quot;. He was also a BAFTA Award and a three-time Golden Globe nominee for Best Supporting Actor – Motion Picture (for &quot;Tom Jones&quot;; 1963, &quot;Oliver!&quot;; 1968, and &quot;The Fixer,&quot; also 1968), and a Clarence Derwent Award winner.

==Early life==
Griffith was born in Marian-glas, Anglesey, Wales, the youngest son of Mary and William Griffith. His sister was actress Elen Roger Jones. He was educated at Llangefni County School and attempted to gain entrance to university, but failed the English examination. He was then urged to make a career in banking, becoming a bank clerk and transferring to London to be closer to acting opportunities. 

Just as he was making progress and gained admission to the Royal Academy of Dramatic Arts, he had to suspend his plans in order to join the British Army, serving for six years with the Royal Welch Fusiliers in India and the Burma Campaign during the Second World War. He resumed his acting career in 1946, joining the Royal Shakespeare Company.

==Career==

=== Stage ===
Between 1946 and 1976, Griffith won acclaim for many stage roles, in particular for his portrayals of Falstaff, Lear and Prospero. Griffith performed on both sides of the Atlantic, taking leading roles in London, New York City and Stratford. In 1952, he starred in the Broadway adaption of &quot;Legend of Lovers&quot;, alongside fellow Welsh actor Richard Burton. 

In 1958, he was back in New York, this time taking a lead role in the opening production of &quot;Look Homeward, Angel&quot;, alongside Anthony Perkins. Both he and Perkins were nominated for the Tony Award for Best Actor in a Play.

=== Film ===
Griffith began his film career in British films during the late 1940s, and by the 1950s was also working in Hollywood. He won the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor for his role in &quot;Ben-Hur&quot; (1959), and was nominated for his performance in &quot;Tom Jones&quot; (1963). In 1968, he appeared as the magistrate in &quot;Oliver!&quot;. His later career was often blighted by his chronic alcoholism. 

He played the funeral director Caradog Lloyd-Evans in the 1978 BBC Wales comedy &quot;Grand Slam&quot;. While visibly unwell at the time of shooting (years of alcohol abuse had taken their toll), Griffith&#x27;s portrayal received widespread acclaim and helped the movie attain cult status.

Griffith was attached to Orson Welles&#x27; unproduced 1960s adaptation of &quot;Treasure Island&quot;.

=== Television ===
On television, he had major roles in &quot;Quatermass II&quot; (1955), a miniseries adaptation of A. J. Cronin&#x27;s &quot;The Citadel&quot; (1960) and &quot;Clochemerle&quot; (1972). He also appeared in an episode, &#x27;The Talking Head&#x27;, of &quot;Colonel March of Scotland Yard&quot;.

==Honours==
He received an honorary degree from the University of Wales, Bangor, in 1965.

== Personal life ==

Griffith was married to Adelgunde Margaret Beatrice von Dechend in 1947. He was a lifelong friend and drinking companion of poet Dylan Thomas.

==Death==
Griffith, after being unwell for about a year, died in 1980 at his home in Kensington, London, at age 67.

<doc id="779397" wikidata="Q1348668" url="?curid=779397" title="Erckmann-Chatrian">
<text>Erckmann-Chatrian was the name used by French authors Émile Erckmann (1822–1899) and Alexandre Chatrian (1826–1890), nearly all of whose works were jointly written.

==History==
Both Erckmann and Chatrian were born in the &quot;département&quot; of Meurthe (now Moselle), in the Lorraine region in the extreme north-east of France. They specialised in military fiction and ghost stories in a rustic mode Lifelong friends who first met in the spring of 1847, they finally quarreled during the mid-1880s, after which they did not produce any more stories jointly. During 1890 Chatrian died, and Erckmann wrote a few pieces under his own name.

Many of Erckmann-Chatrian&#x27;s works were translated into English by Adrian Ross.

Tales of supernatural horror by the duo that are well known in English include &quot;The Wild Huntsman&quot; (tr. 1871), &quot;The Man-Wolf&quot; (tr. 1876) and &quot;The Crab Spider.&quot; These stories received praise from the renowned English ghost story writer, M. R. James, as well as H. P. Lovecraft.

Erckmann-Chatrian wrote numerous historical novels, some of which attacked the Second Empire in anti-monarchist terms. Partly as a result of their republicanism, they were praised by Victor Hugo and Émile Zola, and fiercely attacked in the pages of &quot;Le Figaro&quot;. Gaining popularity from 1859 for their nationalistic, anti-militaristic and anti-German sentiments, they were well-selling authors but had trouble with political censorship throughout their careers. Generally the novels were written by Erckmann, and the plays mostly by Chatrian.

A festival in their honour is held every summer in the town of Erckmann&#x27;s birth, Phalsbourg (German Pfalzburg), which also contains a military museum exhibiting editions of their works.

<text>In rock climbing, a bolt is a permanent anchor fixed into a hole drilled in the rock as a form of climbing protection. Most bolts are either self-anchoring expansion bolts or fixed in place with liquid resin. Climbing routes that are bolted are known as sport climbs, and those that do not use (or allow) bolts, are known as traditional climbs.

==Description==
While bolts are commonplace in rock and gym climbing there is no universal vocabulary to describe them. Generally, a bolt hanger (or a fixed hanger) is a combination of a fixed bolt and a specialized stainless steel hanger designed to accept a carabiner, whereas in certain regions a bolt runner (or a carrot) describes a hangerless bolt (where the climber must provide their own hanger bracket such as a rivet hanger). A climbing rope is then clipped into the carabiner. Generally quickdraws or slings are employed between bolt hangers and the rope to reduce drag when ascending, belaying and rappelling.

==Types==
Variations of climbing bolts include:

* Ring bolt has a loop on one end so it presents as a U-shape embedded in the wall. 

* Glue-in bolt resembles a pin that is popular in Europe. 

* Carrot bolt is a metal hex-headed machine bolt used in Australia to function like a bolt but with no fixed bolt hanger attached; climbers attach to the carrot bolt by using a version of a rivet hanger or by attaching a removable bolt hanger plate.

==Use==
Rock climbing routes that have been bolted for climbing protection — but not as a source of aid to help progression — are called sport climbs. Where a route has bolts to aid progression (i.e. a climber can pull on the bolt), it is called an aid climb. In competition lead climbing, all of the routes are bolted.

==Lifespan==
Bolts degrade over time — particularly in coastal areas from salt, but also from stress corrosion cracking — and eventually, all sport climbs need to be re-fitted after a number of years. The highest quality titanium bolts are too expensive to use regularly, and the next highest quality stainless steel bolts have an expected lifespan of circa 20—25 years (the cheaper plated stainless steel bolts have a shorter span); and in 2015, the American Alpine Club established an &quot;anchor replacement fund&quot; to help replace the bolts on America&#x27;s estimated 60,000 sport climbing routes.

<doc id="779427" wikidata="Q6872802" url="?curid=779427" title="Miranda Devine">
<text>Miranda Devine is an Australian-American columnist and writer, now based in New York City. She hosted &quot;The Miranda Devine Show&quot; on Sydney radio station 2GB until it ended in 2015. She has written columns for Fairfax Media newspapers &quot;The Sydney Morning Herald&quot; and &quot;The Sun-Herald&quot;, and for News Limited newspapers &quot;Daily Telegraph&quot;, &quot;Sunday Telegraph&quot;, Melbourne&#x27;s &quot;Sunday Herald Sun&quot;, and Perth&#x27;s &quot;Sunday Times&quot;. As of 2022, she writes for the &quot;New York Post&quot;. Some of her political opinion pieces and statements on race, gender, and the environment have been the subject of public scrutiny and debate.

==Early life and education==
Devine is the eldest daughter of Frank Devine, a New Zealand-born Australian newspaper editor and journalist, who died in 2009. She was born in New York, but grew up in Sydney and Tokyo, attending school at Loreto Kirribilli and the International School of the Sacred Heart respectively. She has a Master of Science in journalism from Northwestern University (USA) and a Bachelor of Science in mathematics from Macquarie University. Devine studied first-year architecture at the University of Sydney, where she was a resident at Sancta Sophia College and worked briefly at the CSIRO&#x27;s Division of Textile Physics.

==Career==
Devine worked for the &quot;Boston Herald&quot; as a reporter and feature writer. In 1989, Devine joined &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; as assistant editor, police reporter, and columnist after returning to Australia to live in Sydney. She had also previously worked at the British tabloid &quot;the Sun&quot; and the British newspaper &quot;Sunday Times&quot; in London. Most recently, Devine&#x27;s columns, focused on United States politics, are published by the &quot;New York Post&quot; and she makes appearances promoting her articles on local media outlets. Devine formerly lived in Sydney with her husband and two sons. Devine is the author of the book &quot;Laptop from Hell: Hunter Biden, Big Tech, and the Dirty Secrets the President Tried to Hide.&quot;

== Commentary ==
Devine takes a conservative stance on a range of social and political issues. In April 2016, she coined the term &quot;delcon&quot; (delusional conservative) to describe conservatives who remained loyal to Tony Abbott after the Liberal Party ousted him in favour of Malcolm Turnbull.

=== Race ===
In 2002, Devine opined in the &quot;Sydney Morning Herald&quot; that the racial element of the Sydney gang rapes had been &quot;airbrushed&quot; out of the media coverage of the events. She stated that the victims alleged that prosecutors had intentionally &quot;censored&quot; their official statements to remove any mention of racially sensitive material. Devine has also been accused by &quot;The Guardian&quot; and &quot;The Sydney Morning Herald&quot; of promoting the white genocide conspiracy theory and has been described as pivotal in popularising the concept within Australian politics. Referring to white South African refugees as &quot;oppressed white, Christian, industrious, rugby and cricket-playing Commonwealth cousins&quot;, she has claimed they would &quot;integrate seamlessly&quot; with European Australians.

=== Environment ===
Devine suggested in 2009 that conservationists were to blame for the poor management of forested areas and national parks, and consequently for the deaths during the Black Saturday bushfires event. This rhetoric was revived during the 2019–20 Australian bushfire season, but promptly rejected by the scientific and firefighting community. In 2017, she claimed that shared bicycle schemes were a terror threat. Devine is also a climate change denier, advocating for the continuation of coal-fired electricity production and she has repeatedly stated that climate change is a political conspiracy.

=== Gender and LGBTIQ issues ===
In her comments in &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; on the breach of duty of care lawsuit brought by 14-year-old gay student Christopher Tsakalos against the New South Wales Education Department in 1997, Devine poured cold water on the possibility of ever protecting LGBT+ students from discrimination and assault, asserting that to do so, &quot;you would have to make mincing homosexuality the norm in schools.&quot; Devine also accused the Gay and Lesbian Teachers and Students Association of coaching Tsakalos’ camp performance for financial reward, and to make him into &quot;an international poster boy for the homosexual movement&quot;, a speculation strenuously refuted by his mother.

In 2011, Devine used the news of Australian federal government minister Penny Wong&#x27;s decision to parent a child with her female partner as the basis of a column in which she argued that the 2011 riots in England were the result of a &quot;fatherless society&quot;. Writing for &quot;ABC News&quot;, Catherine Deveny criticised Devine&#x27;s claim that same-sex marriage was a &quot;political tool to undermine the last bastion of bourgeois morality - the traditional nuclear family&quot;. Devine sparked further controversy in 2015 after claiming that &quot;women abusing welfare&quot; were the main cause of domestic violence in Australia and contending &quot;if you want to break the cycle of violence, end the welfare incentive for unsuitable women to keep having children to a string of feckless men&quot;. In 2016, Devine again caused controversy by comparing the purported &quot;vilification&quot; of opponents of same-sex marriage in Australia to the victims of beheadings by ISIS, saying that critics of same-sex marriage were being &quot;brutally made examples of&quot; by &quot;intolerant authoritarians&quot;.

=== George Pell ===
In 2019, Devine defended Cardinal George Pell, at the time facing charges of which he was ultimately acquitted, related to the sexual assault of two 13-year-old boys, claiming that the victim&#x27;s &quot;accusations are implausible&quot; and that &quot;Victoria police chief Graham Ashton desperate for a distraction from the crime epidemic he’s incapable of stopping&quot;.

===Donald Trump===
Devine supported US President Donald Trump. In February 2020, Devine was reported to be &quot;over the moon&quot; after being retweeted by Trump. In October 2020, The Guardian described her as &quot;one of Trump&#x27;s favourite writers&quot; after the President again retweeted one of her articles. Devine drew criticism for a &quot;fantastically fawning love letter&quot; to Trump in which she described him as an &quot;invincible hero&quot; after his recovery from COVID-19 and called COVID-19 &quot;the Chinese virus&quot;. Devine has since repeated Donald Trump&#x27;s unsuccessful attempts to overturn the 2020 United States presidential election with unsubstantiated claims that Joe Biden&#x27;s victory in the 2020 United States presidential election was driven by large-scale electoral fraud. In January 2021, Devine blamed past Black Lives Matter demonstrations for the actions of rioters during the 2021 storming of the United States Capitol.

===Quaden Bayles===
In February 2020, Devine alleged in a series of tweets that a video showing Quaden Bayles, an Indigenous boy with achondroplasia dwarfism, crying after being bullied at school, was a scam and that Bayles was actually an adult actor. That led to Quaden&#x27;s mother, Yarraka, suing Devine for defamation on behalf of her son, and also suing on her own behalf over Devine&#x27;s suggestion she had coached Quaden.

In September 2020, ahead of a settlement of the suit, Devine, who was on secondment at the &quot;New York Post&quot;, tweeted an apology for her allegations that the video had been faked. Shortly after this, &quot;The Guardian&quot; reported that the Bayles family settled with Devine for almost $200,000 in damages plus legal costs.

===Hunter Biden===
Miranda Devine has been cited as the source for a rental application of Hunter Biden&#x27;s purporting to have previously paid $49,910 of rent a month at a previous property. This has been construed by Tucker Carlson, Judge Jeanine and other Fox News hosts as proof of money laundering within the Biden family. The fact checking website PolitiFact says out that this claim is wrong, and that the actual property referenced is Hunter Biden&#x27;s office space in the &quot;House of Sweden&quot; building on K Street, Washington, D.C. 

===Grenfell tower fire===
In June 2017, soon after the Grenfell tower fire in London, Devine claimed that &quot;aluminium composite cladding was applied to the building last May, not just for its good looks but as a sustainable energy solution to achieve green ticks in the carbon-obsessed British regulatory system.&quot; and that &quot;Green ideology has given us...now flammable cladding.&quot; Australian television program &quot;Media Watch&quot; said in September 2024 that the Grenfell Tower Inquiry found &quot;no evidence of ‘green ideas’ contributing to Grenfell Tower inferno that killed 72 people, despite News Corp columnists Rowan Dean and Miranda Devine stirring up a culture war seven years ago.&quot;
== Recognition ==

===Samizdat Prize (2024)===
Devine was one of the inaugural recipients of this award, established by RealClearPolitics to honor individuals who demonstrate exceptional courage in upholding the principles of the First Amendment and resisting censorship.

===MRC Bulldog Award for Outstanding Columnist (2022)===
Presented by the Media Research Center, this award acknowledges conservative journalists who provide impactful and trustworthy commentary. Devine was recognized for her insightful columns and her book, Laptop from Hell, which delves into the controversies surrounding Hunter Biden.

<doc id="779428" wikidata="Q365085" url="?curid=779428" title="Eric II of Denmark">
<text>Eric II the Memorable (; – 18 September 1137) was king of Denmark between 1134 and 1137. Eric was an illegitimate son of Eric I of Denmark, who ruled Denmark from 1095 to 1103. Eric the Memorable rebelled against his uncle Niels of Denmark, and was declared king in 1134. He punished his adversaries severely, and rewarded his supporters handsomely. He was killed by a subject in 1137 and was promptly succeeded by his nephew Eric III of Denmark.

==Early life==
Eric was born around 1090, to King Eric I of Denmark and an unknown concubine. He was given some Danish isles by his half-brother Canute Lavard, and was &quot;jarl&quot; of Møn, Lolland, and Falster. When Lavard was murdered in 1131, Eric joined his half-brother Harald Kesja in a rebellion against the responsible king Niels of Denmark. Eric was elected Danish Antiking in Scania in April 1131, which prompted Kesja to support Niels in jealousy.

Eric&#x27;s army lost several battles against Niels and his son Magnus the Strong, including Jelling in Jutland in 1131 and Værbro on Zealand, and he fled to Scania. His retreat earned him the nickname &quot;Harefoot&quot;. Eric unsuccessfully tried to convince Lothair III, Holy Roman Emperor to support his bid for kingship, and had no luck asking Magnus IV of Norway for help. He returned to Scania in 1134, where Archbishop Asser of Lund joined his cause, and Lothair eventually supported him as well. In 1134, he defeated king Niels&#x27; entire army at the Battle of Fotevik in Scania, with the crucial help of German mounted mercenaries, and Niels died within the year.

==Reign==
Eric was proclaimed king at Scania&#x27;s &quot;landsting&quot; assembly at Lerbäckshögen in Kävlingevägen near Lund. Eric subsequently made Lund his capital city. With the resounding victory at Fotevik, Eric was given the nickname &quot;the Memorable&quot; to replace &quot;Harefoot&quot;. Kesja returned to Denmark and was proclaimed king at Urnehoved in Schleswig. Eric chased him down and killed Harald Kesja and his sons, of whom only Olaf Haraldsen escaped with his life.

Eric then sought to consolidate and legitimize his rule. He gave titles and privileges to his supporters, and proclaimed Archbishop Asser&#x27;s nephew Eskil (c. 1100-1181), Bishop of the Diocese of Roskilde.

He initiated the process of getting his half-brother Canute Lavard canonized, and established an abbey at Ringsted to document reports of miracles at Canute&#x27;s grave. Eric wanted to establish the divine right of kings, and canonizing Canute would support his claim on the throne. Canute was finally canonized in 1170.

Eric was known as a harsh ruler to his enemies. In the summer of 1136, Eric undertook a crusade against the pagan population on the Baltic island of Rügen and its capital Arkona. He ordered his men to dig a canal between the city and the rest of the island. The canal had the effect of drying up the spring which supplied Arkona with drinking water. Arkona was forced to surrender. In 1135, before this success in Arkona, Eric defeated in a naval battle near Denmark&#x27;s coast the lechitic (West Slavic) troops under pomeranian Duke Ratibor who had sacked Roskilde, and a year later, after the battle of Konungahela, (now Kungälv in Sweden), sacked this city as well. He joined Magnus for an unsuccessful campaign in Norway, where he managed to burn down Oslo. When he learned that Eskil had raised the nobles of Zealand against him, Eric raced north to put down the rebellion which spread rapidly across Funen and Jutland, and fined Eskil heavily.

==Death==
Eric was killed on 18 September 1137.
The death of Eric, as told by Arild Huitfeldt: A harsh and unpopular ruler, Eric died at Urnehoved &quot;landsting&quot; in 1137. King Eric was struck down by a local nobleman, Sorte Plov.
According to legend, Sorte Plov asked permission to approach the king, carrying a spear in his hand with a block of wood protecting the tip. Having deemed that King Eric wore no mail underneath his tunic, Sorte Plov kicked off the protection, and drove his spear right through the king. King Eric&#x27;s nephew Erik Håkonssøn stepped forward with sword in hand, but the nobleman told him to calm down, seeing as how he – Erik – was next in line for the throne, being the only adult male in the royal family: &quot;Put away thy mace, young Erik. A juicy piece of meat hath fallen in thy bowl!&quot; According to legend, Sorte Plov escaped with his life. 
Eric was buried at Ribe Cathedral. Erik Håkonssøn was then crowned Eric III of Denmark.

==Issue==

Sometime before 1130, Eric married Malmfred of Kiev, the daughter of Grand Duke Mstislav I of Kiev and Christina Ingesdotter of Sweden. Malmfrid was the former wife of King Sigurd I of Norway. With his concubine Thunna, Eric had the illegitimate son Sweyn, who would later become king as Sweyn III of Denmark.

<text>George Chakiris (born September 16, 1932) is an American actor and dancer. He is best known for his appearance in the 1961 film version of &quot;West Side Story&quot; as Bernardo, the leader of the Sharks gang, for which he won both the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor and the Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actor – Motion Picture.

==Life and career==
===Early life===
Chakiris was born on September 16, 1932, in Norwood, Ohio, to Stelianos (Steve) and Zoe (&quot;née&quot; Anastasiadou) Chakiris, Greek immigrants from Turkey. He is one of eight siblings.

His family moved to Long Beach, California, in 1944. He attended Jefferson Junior High school and was graduated in 1950 from Woodrow Wilson Classical High School, both in Long Beach.

Chakiris attended one year at Long Beach City College, but wanted to pursue a career in dance, so he dropped out and moved to Hollywood. He worked in the advertising department of May Company California, a department store, and studied dance at night.

===Early films===
 Chakiris made his film debut at age 15 in 1947 in the chorus of &quot;Song of Love&quot;.

For several years he appeared in small roles, usually as a dancer or a member of the chorus in various musical films, including &quot;The Great Caruso&quot; (1951), &quot;Stars and Stripes Forever&quot; (1952), &quot;Call Me Madam&quot; (1953), &quot;Second Chance&quot; (1953), and &quot;The 5,000 Fingers of Dr. T.&quot; (1953).

He was a dancer in Marilyn Monroe&#x27;s &quot;Diamonds Are a Girl&#x27;s Best Friend&quot; number in &quot;Gentlemen Prefer Blondes&quot; (1953), and he appeared in &quot;Give a Girl a Break&quot; (1953) and &quot;White Christmas&quot; (1954).

He can be seen in the wedding dance in the MGM musical film &quot;Brigadoon&quot; (1954), and appeared in &quot;There&#x27;s No Business Like Show Business&quot; (1954).

Chakiris was sometimes cast in non-Caucasian roles, including in &quot;West Side Story&quot; as a Puerto Rican and in &quot;Diamond Head&quot; as a native Hawaiian.

===Paramount===
Chakiris appeared uncredited as a dancer in &quot;White Christmas&quot; (1954) and appeared in a close-up with Rosemary Clooney while she sang &quot;Love, You Didn&#x27;t Do Right by Me&quot;. A publicity photo of this generated fan mail, and Paramount signed him to a movie contract. &quot;I got lucky with the close-up with Rosemary,&quot; said Chakiris.

Chakiris appeared in &quot;The Country Girl&quot; (1954) and &quot;The Girl Rush&quot; (1955), dancing with Rosalind Russell in the latter. He received a positive review from Hedda Hopper.

MGM borrowed him for &quot;Meet Me in Las Vegas&quot; (1956), and he danced in Las Vegas.

Chakiris had a small non-dancing part in &quot;Under Fire&quot; (1957).

===&quot;West Side Story&quot;===
About 1958, frustrated with the progress of his career, Chakiris left Hollywood for New York. The stage musical &quot;West Side Story&quot; had been running for a year on Broadway, and Chakiris auditioned for Jerome Robbins. He was cast in the London production as Riff, leader of the Jets. The musical launched on the West End in late 1958, and Chakiris received excellent reviews, playing it for almost 22 months.

The Mirisch Brothers bought the film rights to &quot;West Side Story&quot; and screen-tested Chakiris. They thought his dark complexion made him more suited to the role of Bernardo, leader of the Sharks, and cast Russ Tamblyn as Riff. Filming took seven months.

The film adaptation of &quot;West Side Story&quot; (1961) was hugely successful, and Chakiris won the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor for his performance. This led to a long-term contract with the Mirisch Company.

Chakiris played the lead role in &quot;Two and Two Make Six&quot; (1962), directed by Freddie Francis.

Chakiris starred as a doctor in the film &quot;Diamond Head&quot; (1963), opposite Charlton Heston and Yvette Mimieux.

In the early 1960s, he embarked on a career as a pop singer, resulting in a couple of minor hits. In 1960, he recorded a single with producer Joe Meek.

===Three-picture deal with Mirisch Brothers===
Chakiris&#x27;s fee around this time was reported to be $100,000 per movie. His first new film for the Mirisches was &quot;Flight from Ashiya&quot; (1964), shot in Japan with Yul Brynner and Richard Widmark.

The Mirisches reunited Chakiris with Brynner in &quot;Kings of the Sun&quot; (1963), an epic about the Mayans, which was a box-office flop. Chakiris went to Italy to make &quot;Bebo&#x27;s Girl&quot; (1964) with Claudia Cardinale.

He acted in &quot;633 Squadron&quot; (1964), a war movie with Cliff Robertson, the last movie he made for the Mirisches. Chakiris later said he made a mistake with his Hollywood films by looking at the &quot;potential&quot; of them instead of the quality of the roles.

===Europe===
Chakiris played a Greek terrorist in Cyprus in a British film, &quot;The High Bright Sun&quot; (1965), with Dirk Bogarde. He went to Italy for &quot;The Mona Lisa Has Been Stolen &quot; (1965) and France for &quot;Is Paris Burning?&quot; (1966).

He appeared with Catherine Deneuve and Gene Kelly in Jacques Demy&#x27;s French musical film &quot;The Young Girls of Rochefort&quot; (1967). Around this time, his manager cancelled his contract with Capitol Records. However, he enjoyed his time in Europe, saying he had time to &quot;experiment and refine my craft.&quot; He also performed a nightclub act at Caesars Palace in Las Vegas, his first stage work since &quot;West Side Story&quot;. The show was successful and led to Chakiris receiving an offer to appear with Jose Ferrer in a TV production of &quot;Kismet&quot; (1967). He appeared in &quot;The Day the Hot Line Got Hot&quot; (1968) in France, and &quot;The Big Cube&quot; (1969) with Lana Turner in America. He made &quot;Sharon Vestida de Rojo&quot; (&quot;Sharon Dressed in Red&quot;) (1970) in Spain.

===1970s and 1980s===
In 1969, Chakiris did a stage production of &quot;The Corn Is Green&quot; in Chicago with Eileen Herlie. He enjoyed the experience and it revived his confidence as an actor. He said all the films he made after &quot;West Side Story&quot; had been &quot;a waste of time...it was difficult to take them seriously...It was my fault and no one else&#x27;s&quot;.

Chakiris accepted a dramatic role on TV&#x27;s &quot;Medical Center&quot; to change his image.

He starred in the first national tour of the Stephen Sondheim musical &quot;Company&quot;, in the role of Bobby, from 1971-1972.

Chakiris worked heavily on TV in the 1970s and 1980s in Britain and the U.S., guest-starring on &quot;Hawaii Five-O&quot;, &quot;Police Surgeon&quot;, &quot;Thriller&quot;, &quot;Notorious Woman&quot;, &quot;Wonder Woman&quot;, &quot;Fantasy Island&quot;, &quot;CHiPs&quot;, &quot;Matt Houston&quot;, &quot;Scarecrow and Mrs. King&quot;, &quot;Poor Little Rich Girls&quot;, &quot;Hell Town&quot; and &quot;Murder, She Wrote&quot;.

He appeared in the final episode (March 22, 1974) of &quot;The Partridge Family&quot; as an old high school boyfriend to Shirley Partridge (Shirley Jones). Their kiss goodbye was the final scene in the program&#x27;s run. He also starred in the Terry Marcel film &quot;Why Not Stay for Breakfast?&quot; (1979).

Chakiris appeared in several episodes of &quot;Dallas&quot; and had a role on &quot;Santa Barbara&quot;.

===Later career===

Chakiris was top-billed in the vampire film &quot;Pale Blood&quot; (1990). On TV, he had a recurring role on the series &quot;Superboy&quot; as Professor Peterson from 1988 to 1990, and guest-starred on &quot;Human Target&quot; and the miniseries &quot;The Girls of Lido&quot;. 

On stage, he starred in the musical in a Long Beach Civic Light Opera production of &quot;The King and I&quot; in 1995.

On March 23, 1998, on the 70th Academy Awards telecast, he appeared in the &quot;Oscar&#x27;s Family Album&quot; segment, a historic gathering of 70 actors who have received both competitive and honorary awards seated onstage together.

He has given occasional television interviews since then, but is mostly retired. His hobby of making sterling silver jewelry has turned into a new occupation, working as a jewelry designer for his own brand, George Chakiris Collections, consisting of handmade original sterling silver jewelry.

In 2012, he presented a musical about veganism titled &quot;Loving the Silent Tears&quot;.

In 2021, Chakiris appeared in the film &quot;Not to Forget&quot; (2021), which aims to raise awareness and funds for the fight against Alzheimer&#x27;s disease. The movie, directed by Valerio Zanoli, stars Karen Grassle and five Academy Award winners: George Chakiris, Cloris Leachman, Louis Gossett Jr., Tatum O&#x27;Neal, and Olympia Dukakis.

<text>Goguryeo tombs, officially designated as the Complex of Koguryo Tombs (), are tombs in North Korea. In July 2004, they became the first UNESCO World Heritage site in the country. The site consists of 30 individual tombs from the later Goguryeo kingdom, one of Three Kingdoms of Korea, located in the cities of P&#x27;yŏngyang and Namp&#x27;o. Goguryeo was one of the strongest ancient Korean kingdoms located in the northern and central parts of the Korean Peninsula and the southern and central parts of Manchuria. The kingdom was founded in the present day area of North Korea, and part of Manchuria around 37 BCE, and the capital was transferred to P&#x27;yŏngyang in 427 CE. 

Many of the tombs, such as the Anak Tomb No. 3, have wall paintings. The tombs are almost all of the Goguryeo culture that survives. There are over 10,000 Goguryeo tombs overall, but only about 90 of those unearthed in China and Korea have wall paintings. The Complex of Goguryeo Tombs inscribed on the World Heritage List contains the majority of these tombs with wall paintings. It is thought that the complex was used as a burial site for kings, queens and other members of the royal family. The paintings found on the tombs offer a unique insight into the everyday life of the Goguryeo period. The group includes the Tomb of King Tongmyong.

The murals are strongly coloured and show daily life and mythology of the time. By 2005, 70 murals had been found, mostly in the Taedong river basin near Pyongyang, the Anak area in South Hwanghae province, and in Ji&#x27;an in China&#x27;s Jilin province.

The following criteria were considered by UNESCO to merit the Goguryeo tombs&#x27; inscription as a World Heritage site:
* The wall paintings are masterpieces of the Goguryeo period. The tombs themselves reflect ingenious engineering capabilities.
* The site offers exceptional insights into the Goguryeo culture, both into everyday life and burial customs.
* The Goguryeo tombs are an important example of this burial typology.

In May 2006, 2,360 individual tombs were discovered at the site of the ancient Goguryeo kingdom during work on the Yunfeng Reservoir. Ruins of an ancient city were discovered as well. Among the ruins was a city wall that was 1.5 meters tall and four meters wide. Evidence also suggested the presence of a moat. A dozen tombs were found within the city.

<doc id="779435" wikidata="Q664781" url="?curid=779435" title="Typhlopidae">
<text>The Typhlopidae are a family of blind snakes. They are found mostly in the tropical regions of Africa, Asia, the Americas, and all mainland Australia and various islands. The rostral scale overhangs the mouth to form a shovel-like burrowing structure. They live underground in burrows, and since they have no use for vision, their eyes are mostly vestigial. They have light-detecting black eye spots, and teeth occur in the upper jaw. Typhlopids do not have dislocatable lower jaw articulations restricting them to prey smaller than their oral aperture. All species in the family Typhlopidae are fossorial and feed on social fossorial invertebrates such as termites and ants. The tracheal lung is present and chambered in all species. One species, the Brahminy&#x27;s blind snake, is the only unisexual snake, with the entire population being female and reproducing via parthenogenesis. The tail ends with a horn-like scale. Most of these species are oviparous. Currently, 18 genera are recognized containing over 200 species.

== Evolution ==
The Typhlopidae are thought to have originated on Madagascar during the Late Cretaceous, along with their sister group, the Xenotyphlopidae. The common ancestor of both families is thought to have diverged from the Gerrhopilidae earlier in the Cretaceous, when Insular India broke away from Madagascar. Afterwards, the Typhlopidae are thought to have dispersed out of Madagascar (leaving behind a single basal genus, &quot;Madatyphlops&quot;) into mainland Africa and then Eurasia, in contrast to the Xenotyphlopidae which remained restricted to Madagascar. From these regions, the Typhlopidae went on to colonize the rest of the world, with African typhlopids rafting across the Atlantic to South America during the Paleocene, then colonizing the Caribbean during the Oligocene, while Asian typhlopids colonized Australia from Southeast Asia or Indonesia later in the Oligocene.

=== Fossil record ===
Possible Typhlopid skin has been identified in Dominican amber.

==Geographic range==
They are found in most tropical and many subtropical regions all over the world, particularly in Africa, Asia, islands in the Pacific, tropical America, and southeastern Europe.

==Genera==

TType genus

===Former genera===
&quot;Xenotyphlops&quot;, formerly classified in the Typhlopidae, is now classed in the Xenotyphlopidae.

<text>Eric III Lamb (,  – 27 August 1146) was King of Denmark from 1137 until 1146. He was the grandson of Eric I and the nephew of Eric II, whom he succeeded on the throne. He abdicated in 1146, and was the only Danish monarch to do so voluntarily, until Margrethe II, 878 years later in 2024. His succession led to a period of civil war between Sweyn III, Canute V, and Valdemar I.

==Biography==
Eric was born on Funen. His mother was Ragnhild, the daughter of King Eric I, and his father was the nobleman Hakon Sunnivasson, a great-grandson of King Magnus the Good of Norway and Denmark. Eric was the nephew of Eric II of Denmark; he fought for Eric II at the decisive Battle of Fotevik in 1134, and succeeded him to the throne when he was murdered in 1137.

Not much is known of Eric&#x27;s kingship; there is much disagreement among contemporary chroniclers about his personality, and he is portrayed both as a passive and irresolute man, but also as an eager and brave fighter. 

Eric had to fight for his kingship against his cousin Olaf Haraldsen, sometimes called &quot;Olaf II&quot;. Olaf established a power base in Scania in 1139 and tried to usurp the throne from there, but Eric defeated and killed him in 1141 near Helsingborg. During the civil wars, the Wends raided the Danish coasts and inlets without much Danish resistance. Eric supported Magnus the Blind and Sigurd Slembe in the Norwegian civil war. He worked to aggrandize the church, especially St. Canute&#x27;s Abbey in Odense, and had a close relationship with bishop Eskil of Roskilde.

In 1143, he married Lutgard of Salzwedel, daughter of Rudolf I, Margrave of the Nordmark. Eric and Lutgard were married by Rudolf&#x27;s son Hartwig, then Provost of Bremen Cathedral, in 1143 or 1144.

In 1146 Eric abdicated for unknown reasons. He was the only Danish monarch in history to do so until Margrethe II in 2024. He entered St. Canute&#x27;s Abbey, where he died on 27 August 1146 and was buried in the cloister. His abdication has been explained as being rooted either in his realization of his inability to govern, or in an illness which ultimately killed him.

==Legacy==
His nickname &quot;Lam&quot; means &quot;lamb&quot;. This is taken either to reference the Lamb of God as he was seen as a pious man, and to describe his mildhearted and generous nature; or to indicate a weak and soft king. He married Lutgard of Salzwedel in 1144, which indicated an increasing German influence on Denmark. He and Lutgard had no children, though Eric fathered a son, Magnus, out of wedlock. After Eric died, Lutgard married Herman II of Winzenburg.

<text>Dongmyo () is a myo shrine in Downtown Seoul, South Korea. It was built in honour of the 3rd century Chinese military commander, Guan Yu.

The Joseon government embarked on construction in 1599 and completed the work in 1601. The Wanli Emperor of Ming provided funds for construction of the shrine, along with a plaque with his own calligraphy. Three shrines - Dongmyo (east shrine), Seomyo (west shrine) and Bungmyo (north shrine) - were actually constructed in 1601. However, only Dongmyo Shrine remains today.

There was no such practice as worshipping Guan Yu as a Marshal Deity in Korea until Ming dynasty military officers brought the custom during the military campaigns against Japan. As Neo-Confucian fundamentalists, Korean officers found it unacceptable to worship Guan Yu, but were unable to refuse the Chinese request for enshrinement. The construction was a burden to exhausted postwar Korea and the shrine was maintained only with concern for the relationship with China.

Koreans remained indifferent toward these shrines for a long time. But during the reign of King Yeongjo (1724–1776), Dongmyo and Nammyo (another shrine constructed by Ming military official Zhen Yin) were incorporated into state rituals for the purpose of Ming worship linked with hostility toward and contempt for Manchu Qing dynasty.

The shrine is surrounded by a wall of stone and mud, and covers an area of 9,315 m2. Ceremonies were held here for many years to thank Guan Yu for divine support. The shrine compound is enclosed on all sides by walls. Two figures to the rear of the compound are of the general while other figures are images of retainers and other generals. The figure with a red face is the general&#x27;s earthly countenance and the one with a yellow face, his spirit.

The shrine, following the Chinese model, is narrower in width than depth, and the rear and side walls are sumptuously decorated with bricks. Inside the main shrine a wooden image of Guan Yu is enshrined, along with statues of four of his retainers.

A nearby station on Line 1 and Line 6 of the Seoul Subway is named after shrine. The shrine is located in Jongno District.

<doc id="779445" wikidata="Q524302" url="?curid=779445" title="Pak Protector">
<text>Pak Breeders and Pak Protectors are two developmental stages of fictional life in Larry Niven&#x27;s Known Space universe. The Pak first appeared in &quot;The Adults&quot;, which appeared in &quot;Galaxy&quot; in 1967; this story was expanded into the novel &quot;Protector&quot; by Larry Niven (1973). The Pak also appear in several of Niven&#x27;s later novels, notably those set in the Ringworld.

&quot;Destroyer of Worlds&quot; depicts a confrontation between the Pak and the Puppeteers.

== Narrative purpose ==

Niven has written that he invented the Protectors as a thought experiment to explain the common effects of aging on humans and to create a fictional evolutionary explanation for humans&#x27; long lives after females have passed reproductive age. Accordingly, most of the positive attributes of Protectors are based on negative human aging effects: swollen joints, decreased muscle-fat ratio, weakening heart, invariant diet, decreasing height, facial atrophy, leathery skin, hair loss, lack of sex drive, and tooth loss are all turned to advantage during the shift from Breeder to Protector.

== The Pak species ==

In &quot;Protector&quot;, the audience learns that humans are descended from the Pak. Pak Children and Breeders appear in Earth&#x27;s fossil record as &quot;Homo habilis&quot;; the few Pak Protectors to make it to Earth apparently are not found in the fossil record.

The Pak species goes through three stages of development: Child, Breeder and Protector.

Pak Child is analogous to a human child: sexually immature and dependent upon adults for survival.

Pak Breeder is analogous to a young-ish human adult: sexually mature, self-sufficient (in later writings) and providing immediate care for the children. To the Pak, the Breeder stage, though capable of space travel, is not deemed fully sentient; Breeders, to a large extent, rely on Protectors for long-term survival. Earlier Niven stories describe the breeder as &quot;just intelligent enough to swing a club or throw a stone&quot;.

Pak Protector is not analogous to any human form. It is described as a &#x27;fighting machine&#x27;, with armor-like skin, super-human strength and super-human intelligence. Niven&#x27;s stories that focus on the Pak mostly concentrate on the unique Protector stage.

Niven explained the evolution of the Pak as resulting from high radiation levels on their home world near the core of the galaxy. The high radiation near the star-dense core caused severe mutations that can destabilize the evolutionary process. As a result, the Pak evolved a mechanism to eliminate dangerous mutations from the population. That mechanism is the Protector stage.

Protectors are highly sensitive to the smell of their close relatives and &quot;weed out&quot; those that smell wrong, which may indicate a potentially dangerous mutation. This weeding also suppressed positive mutations, essentially halting Pak evolution. Protectors are fully sentient, and are far more intelligent than ordinary humans. This &quot;superior&quot; intelligence, however, serves only a Pak Protector&#x27;s instincts to protect its bloodline at any costs. The Pak have no drive toward the collection of abstract knowledge, have no concept of art, and do not even possess enough of an artistic impulse to understand the purpose of making sketches and paintings for reasons not directly useful.

The change from Breeder to Protector is the result of a peramorphic transformation brought about by the plant known as Tree-of-Life. As humans (and all primates) are descended from the Pak, Tree-of-Life can create a Protector-stage human.

== Tree-of-Life ==

Tree-of-Life is the mechanism by which a Breeder becomes a Protector. The term originally is used to refer to a specific plant which, when consumed, triggers the transformation. The term &quot;Tree-of-Life virus&quot; is used to describe the symbiotic virus which actually governs the transition.

Niven took the name Tree-of-Life from the Book of Genesis; specifically to the fruit of the &quot;Tree of Life&quot; that could make Adam and Eve immortal (Genesis 3:22–24), which is quoted as the foreword to the novel &quot;Protector&quot;, and also mentioned by Brennan within the novel.

Tree-of-Life (the plant) is a bush native to the Pak homeworld. When a Breeder reaches the proper age (early 40s for humans), the smell of the root becomes irresistible; the Breeder gorges on the Tree-of-Life root, infecting itself with the Tree-of-Life virus and transforming into a Protector. The age window for the metamorphosis is relatively narrow (between 42 and 50 Earth years). Tree-of-Life is common on the Pak world, so there is almost no risk of a Breeder living past this window without being exposed to the roots.

The transition from Breeder to Protector involves reconfiguration of the anatomy. Skin thickens, becoming similar to leather armor, strong enough to turn a copper knife. Joints swell until the creature becomes &quot;a parody of the human form done in cantaloupes and coconuts&quot;. This increases leverage available to muscles by increasing the force of the moment arm, the result being that a protector can lift ten times its own weight. Genitalia and gonads vanish, and a second two-chambered heart forms in the groin at the fusion of the femoral veins. The arms lengthen. Fingernails turn into retractable claws. Teeth fall out and the lips and gums fuse, the mouth forming a horny beak (flat in protectors transformed from humans, non-flat in protectors transformed from Pak). All the breeder&#x27;s hair falls out and the head acquires a bony ridge to protect the newly expanded cranium. The expanded skull allows the brain to grow to an enormous size; the resulting mind, even starting from something as &quot;unintelligent&quot; as a chimpanzee, becomes far more intelligent than a typical human. Pak Protectors also acquire an extended lifespan, and can live tens of thousands of Earth years (a common element in Niven&#x27;s stories).

Once the transformation is complete, a Pak Protector must periodically consume more Tree-of-Life root to maintain the virus in its body. Without the virus, a Protector will weaken and die as its DNA is degraded; the virus supplies replacement DNA.

The Tree-of-Life crop on Earth failed due to there being insufficient thallium oxide (which particular oxide is never explained) in the Earth&#x27;s soil; the plants grew but did not support the virus. As a result, the Protectors that led the colony to Earth died of starvation when their store of roots ran out.

== Protector behavior ==

Pak Protectors have an innate need to protect close relatives. When a Pak Protector has no bloodline to protect, it usually stops eating and starves, though some childless Protectors can adopt the entire Pak race as their family.

Niven states that Protectors on the crowded Pak homeworld would constantly war against each other to gain advantage for their family and that alliances would last only until one ally sees advantage in betrayal. Human Protectors, and those on the Ringworld, seem to be less warlike and better able to work for the betterment of the entire species (or all of the Ringworld hominids) rather than just their bloodline, though this may simply be a function of how few Protectors with families encounter each other.

Protectors typically die from starvation (from lack of will to live, e.g. if the Protector&#x27;s bloodline has died out, in which case they simply stop eating until death takes them) or violence. Although Protectors have a vastly extended lifetime, it is not infinite; during the original half-million year journey to Earth some Protector colonists did die from old age.

Because of their enormous intelligence and instinctive need to protect their family (or their species, etc.), Protectors are efficient, ruthless and quite amoral. Xenophobia is a commonly displayed trait: other races are considered either unnecessary or potentially dangerous.
It is observed several times that this intelligence combined with instinct also compels action so completely that Protectors often have little &quot;free will&quot;. Niven uses this trait as a plot device several times as characters set up circumstances where Protector characters will react in a specific manner. In &quot;Protector&quot;, Jack Brennan (a human turned into a Protector) commits genocide by exterminating the Martian race (&quot;Aliens were dangerous, or might be, and Pak were not interested in anything but Pak&quot;) and also releases a genetically modified Tree-of-Life virus on the colony world Home, turning everyone middle aged into a Protector (and killing all other humans on the planet) in order to create an army of childless Protectors with which to fight the invading Pak fleet. It is indicated throughout Niven&#x27;s works that humans (&quot;Homo sapiens&quot;) that have turned into protectors are far more intelligent than their Pak (&quot;Homo habilis&quot;) counterparts (in much the way that humans are more intelligent than the primates they evolved from) and that the Pak may, in fact, be the final evolutionary stage for the human race as a whole.

Niven explains much of Protector behavior in his Future History, by revealing in &quot;Ringworld&#x27;s Children&quot; that the ARM may be run by at least one Protector and that Boosterspice (which dramatically prolongs human lifespan) is derived from Tree-of-Life.

== The Pak and humanity ==

In &quot;Protector,&quot; Niven explains that humans (and all of Earth&#x27;s primates) are descended from a colony of Pak breeders that were stranded on Earth 2.5 million years ago. The protectors that built the colony ship died when their Tree-of-Life crops failed. The original Pak Breeder population (known to us as &quot;Homo habilis&quot;) bred and mutated wildly, evolving into modern humans as well as all other Earth primates. All Terran primates would transform into the Protector stage if exposed to Tree-of-Life root (or, more accurately, the symbiotic virus it contains).

In &quot;The Ringworld Engineers,&quot; the characters find evidence that the Ringworld was built by Pak Protectors (confirmed by the statements of a character in &quot;Ringworld&#x27;s Children&quot; who claims to be one of the original builders) and populated by Pak breeders. The Pak Protectors dwindled in numbers until they were no longer able to maintain the genetic purity of the breeder forms and the breeders eventually evolved into all the other hominids of the Ringworld that one sees in Larry Niven&#x27;s novels.

In &quot;Destroyer of Worlds&quot; (co-written by Niven and Edward M. Lerner), a human world (and the Pierson&#x27;s Puppeteers of the Fleet of Worlds) confronts a Pak Protector war fleet. The trailing edge of that Pak fleet, carrying the primary Pak Library, also figures prominently in &quot;Betrayer of Worlds&quot;, by the same authors.

<text>Peter John FitzSimons (born 29 June 1961) is an Australian author, journalist, and radio and television presenter. He is a former national representative rugby union player and was the chair of the Australian Republic Movement from 2015 to 2022.

==Early life==
FitzSimons grew up in Peats Ridge, in the Central Coast of New South Wales. He was one of seven children. He attended Peats Ridge Public School and Knox Grammar School before going in 1978 to Findlay High School, Ohio, for a year as an exchange student on an American Field Service Scholarship. He then completed an arts degree at the University of Sydney, residing at Wesley College from 1980 to 1982.

==Career==

===Rugby===
FitzSimons first played club rugby with the Sydney University Football Club and then with the Manly RUFC in Sydney in the 1980s under the coaching of Alan Jones. Between 1985 and 1989 he played with CA Brive in France for four seasons as the club&#x27;s first foreign player. He played seven test matches at lock for the Australian national rugby union team between 1989 and 1990, debuting against France in Strasbourg in November 1989, on the Wallabies 1989 tour of Europe. His final Test match was against the All Blacks in Christchurch.

In &quot;On a Wing and a Prayer&quot;, former Wallabies winger David Campese criticised FitzSimons for starting a brawl in Australia&#x27;s first Test against France in 1990. Campese labelled FitzSimons&#x27; actions &quot;a disgrace to the good name of rugby&quot; and asserted that &quot;he was doing the game and its reputation enormous damage.&quot; Campese cautioned that if such fights &quot;turn even one family away from the game, then they have been too costly&quot;.

Former Wallabies backrower Willie Ofahengaue said of FitzSimons: &quot;He&#x27;s a big character. Funny guy. Talkative. One thing I remember about rooming with him was he used to get his suitcase, tip it up and pour everything out on to the floor. When it was time to go home he would chuck everything back in any old way. Fitzy was a real roughie, but he is married now so he must have changed.&quot;

===Journalist===
FitzSimons has written for &quot;The Sydney Morning Herald&quot; since 1988, and has been a sports columnist for that publication since 1987. He regularly appears on the Australian Foxtel program &quot;The Back Page&quot;, formerly hosted by rugby league journalist Mike Gibson and now Tony Squires. For the Saturday edition of &quot;The Sydney Morning Herald&quot;, FitzSimons writes a column titled &quot;The Fitz Files&quot; which looks at all the happenings over the past seven days in sport. He writes a more general version of &quot;The Fitz Files&quot; in &quot;The Sun-Herald&quot; on Sundays, focusing on community activities and events in Sydney. Andrew Denton has called him &quot;Australia&#x27;s finest sports journalist&quot;. On 25 September 2001 he wrote a thought-provoking opinion editorial piece titled &quot;Memo world: try saying sorry to avoid a sorry end&quot;.

In August 2022 FitzSimons threatened to sue Senator Jacinta Nampijinpa Price for defamation when she said that he had been rude and aggressive in a telephone interview. Price urged FitzSimons and &quot;The Sydney Morning Herald&quot; to release the recording of the interview but they declined to do so.

===Radio===
In January 2006 FitzSimons began co-hosting a breakfast radio program with Mike Carlton on Sydney radio station 2UE. He was brought onto the 2UE breakfast show in an attempt to boost the program&#x27;s dwindling ratings. However, the &quot;Mike and Fitz Breakfast Show&quot; still trailed a long way behind the number one program on 2GB, hosted by FitzSimons&#x27; former coach Alan Jones. After two years, FitzSimons quit to become a stay-at-home dad and focus on his writing.

===Author===
FitzSimons is a prolific writer and is one of Australia&#x27;s best-selling non-fiction writers. He has written books about subjects such as Nancy Wake, the shipwreck of the &quot;Batavia&quot;, Sir John Monash, Breaker Morant, Charles Kingsford Smith and John Eales.

==Community and political activism==
FitzSimons is or was involved with a range of community organisations. At the University of Sydney he was a fellow of the Senate from 2009 to 2013, as well as Pro-Chancellor, a patron of The Russell Prize for Humour Writing, State Library of New South Wales, since 2015 and chairman of the Australian Republic Movement from 2015 to 2022.
Additionally, he served on the council of the Australian War Memorial and founded the Cauliflower Club with Nick Farr-Jones.

In the lead-up to 2019 New South Wales state election, FitzSimons began a campaign to prevent the demolition of the Sydney Football Stadium and Stadium Australia. He began by launching a petition in late 2017 on Change.org that reached approximately 220,000 signatures prior to the election as well as numerous editorial articles decrying the demolitions. The stadium issue became a major element of the campaign with Labor leader Michael Daley calling the election a &quot;referendum on stadiums&quot;. On 5 December 2017, FitzSimons remarked on Twitter that the incumbent Gladys Berejiklian government could &quot;bulldoze and rebuild three new stadiums, including Parra, for $3 billion—on no demand—or they can win the next election, but they can&#x27;t do both.&quot;

On 23 March, Berejiklian and her coalition were easily returned to government, with political commentators suggesting that the issue did not resonate with the wider community of the state. The campaign had a minor success, however, as the government changed the original plan for a complete knock down rebuild of Stadium Australia, and instead would go ahead with a billion-dollar refurbishment. The refurbishment would also be cancelled, although no funds were allocated to any grassroots sports facilities as FitzSimons wished, and later had a similar level of funding directed to a new stadium in Penrith.

==Personal life==
FitzSimons is married to Australian journalist and TV presenter Lisa Wilkinson. They have three children and live in Sydney.

FitzSimons has identified himself as an atheist and a Republican.

== Bandana ==
FitzSimons is well renowned for wearing a red bandana. He has explained his regularly wearing of the bandana due to his children giving it to him to wear, so he wears it for them. He is at times referred to informally as &quot;Pirate Pete&quot; due to his wearing of the headwear.

==Honours==
On 13 June 2011 FitzSimons was named a Member of the Order of Australia for service to literature as a biographer, sports journalist and commentator, and to the community through contributions to conservation, disability care, atheism, social welfare and sporting organisations.

<doc id="779466" wikidata="Q42160" url="?curid=779466" title="Hwaseong, Gyeonggi">
<text>Hwaseong (; ) is a city in Gyeonggi Province, South Korea. It is located on the coast of the Yellow Sea. It has the largest area of farmland of any city or county in Gyeonggi Province. Seoul Subway Line 1 passes through Hwaseong, stopping at Byeongjeom Station. Suin-Bundang Line also passes through the city, stopping at Eocheon Station.

Hwaseong Fortress is located in nearby Suwon.

==History==
During the time of the early Three Kingdoms of Korea, parts of modern-day Hwaseong was controlled by the state of Wonyang (), a small statelet that was part of the Mahan confederacy. In 1949, when Suwon was split from the rest of Suwon County, the remaining area of Suwon County was renamed to Hwaseong County, after Hwaseong Fortress in Suwon. On January 1, 1989, the town of Osan was promoted to a city, splitting from Hwaseong County. On March 21, 2001, Hwaseong County would also be promoted to the status of city.

===Universal Studios===
On November 27, 2007 the city was chosen as the site for the future Universal Studios South Korea theme park. Originally set to open in 2016, it would have been the world&#x27;s largest Universal Studios theme park, being larger than all the other four combined. The US$3.1 billion park was expected to create at least 58,000 new jobs. In 2014, the project was put on hold. The plan was restarted in 2015, and K-Water (Korean Water Resources Corporation) was chosen as a business partner. Universal Studios South Korea is no longer under development .

===Aricell battery factory fire===
On June 24, 2024, a fire at a lithium battery factory owned by Aricell killed 23 workers, and a further 8 workers were wounded.
The fire was caused by the explosion of a series of battery cells.

==Climate==
Hwaseong has a humid continental climate (Köppen: &quot;Dwa&quot;), but can be considered a borderline humid subtropical climate (Köppen: &quot;Cwa&quot;) using the isotherm. The city is located in the western area of the Korean Peninsula. The temperatures in winter are low along the coast since it is located in the lower plains and close to the Yellow Sea (West Sea), where the water is shallow.
Additionally, Siberian air flows directly into the western flatlands of the Korean peninsula, making several areas colder.


==Demographics==
Hwaseong is populated by 49% male South Korean citizens, 46% female South Korean citizens, and 5% foreign residents. With 236,241 homes, there are on average 2.8 people per registered place of residence in the city. With the exceptions of Byeongjeom 2-dong, Dongtan 2-dong and Dongtan 3-dong, there is a larger number of males than females in every division of the city.

Administrative divisions

Hwaseong has 4 towns (eup), 9 townships (myeon) and 13 neighborhoods (dong). Each eup and myeon is further divided into villages (ri). In October 2014, Namyang-dong was downgraded to an eup- the first case in South Korea. Hwaseong&#x27;s name comes from Suwon&#x27;s Hwaseong Fortress, built by King Jeongjo.
The most populous areas of Hwaseong are Namyang (to the west), Hyangnam and Bongdam (central), and Dongtan to the east. Dongtan has had an SRT high speed rail station since December 2017. The Seohae Expressway runs through western Hwaseong, while the Gyeongbu Expressway runs through the east of the city..

==Local products==
Many special products are sold in the Hwaseong area that are different from other regions of Gyeonggi Province. There are many facilities that grow products ranging from honey melons to herbs. Additionally, meat and dairy products are also available. Hangwa is also made by local companies as a specialty.

==Sports==
Hwaseong is home to the V-League women&#x27;s volleyball team Hwaseong IBK Altos and the K League 2 football team Hwaseong FC, both of which are based at Hwaseong Sports Town. This sports complex hosted football and basketball matches at the 2014 Asian Games, while the shooting events were held elsewhere in Hwaseong.

<text>The Constitutional Charter of Serbia and Montenegro (, &quot;Ustavna povelja Srbije i Crne Gore&quot;) came into force on 4 February 2003, creating a confederacy between Serbia and Montenegro under one government, the State Union of Serbia and Montenegro amending the earlier Federal Constitution.

As a result, the name &quot;Yugoslavia&quot; was consigned to history after 74 years.

<doc id="779468" wikidata="Q310152" url="?curid=779468" title="Saint Erik">
<text>Saint Erik (died 18 May 1160), also called Eric IX or Erik Jedvardsson was King of Sweden from 1156 until his death in 1160. The &quot;Roman Martyrology&quot; of the Catholic Church names him as a saint memorialized on 18 May. He was the founder of the House of Erik, which ruled Sweden with interruptions from c. 1156 to 1250.

==Background==
As later kings from the House of Erik were consistently buried at Varnhem Abbey near Skara in Västergötland, Erik&#x27;s family is considered to have Geatish roots like other medieval ruling houses in Sweden. Osteological investigations of Erik&#x27;s remains suggest that he may have lived the last 10–15 years of his life in Västergötland rather than in Uppland where he died. On the other hand, the only manor he is known to have possessed is situated in Västmanland in Svealand. Eriksberg in central Västergötland has been suggested as the original family manor.

Erik had a brother whose name began with a &quot;J&quot;; this brother has been identified with a Joar Jedvardsson. This in turn fits with King Sverre&#x27;s Saga, which refers to &quot;Eirik the Saint, son of Jatvard&quot;. Late medieval Swedish tradition likewise knows the king by the name Erik Jedvardsson. The name of the father, Jedvard (Edward), is not Scandinavian and may point to English missionary influence. According to 14th-century tradition, Erik&#x27;s mother was Cecilia, a daughter of King Blot-Sweyn. This information is disputed, however.

==Legend==
No contemporary sources with information about Erik have been found, and the first written mention of him is in a letter during the reign of his son Knut Eriksson. The letter refers to Erik as &quot;King of the Swedes&quot;; the only full account of Erik&#x27;s life is a hagiographical legend dating from the late 13th century. The historicity of the legend has been much-discussed by Swedish historians. It tells that Erik was of royal blood and was unanimously chosen king of Sweden when there was a vacancy of the kingship. It also states that Erik reigned for ten years, which would put the beginning of his reign in c. 1150. If this is correct he would have been a rival king to Sverker I, who had ascended the throne in c. 1132 and was murdered in 1156. At any rate it is assumed that Erik was recognized in most provinces after 1156. While his paternity is obscure, there is good evidence that he strengthened his claims to the throne by marriage to the Danish princess Christina Björnsdotter, a granddaughter of King Inge the Elder. His realm did not include Östergötland, where Sverker&#x27;s son Karl Sverkersson ruled in the late 1150s.

According to the legend, Erik did much to consolidate Christianity in his realm. However, the only reliable source mentioning his reign is a Cistercian chronicle from c. 1200. Quite contrary to the impression of pro-clerical policy of the Erik Legend, it says that King Erik and Queen Christina harassed the monks of Varnhem Abbey in Västergötland. Some monks left for Denmark where Vitskøl Abbey was founded in 1158. After this, however, Erik and Christina changed their stance and allowed Varnhem to be reorganized under Abbot Gerhard of Alvastra Abbey. An early 13th-century source adds that he made donations to Nydala Abbey in Småland.

==Crusade to Finland==

Legend also attributes Erik with the initial spread of the Christian faith into Finland, &quot;which at this time was pagan and did Sweden great harm&quot;. In an effort to conquer and convert the Finns, he allegedly led the First Swedish Crusade east of the Baltic Sea. &quot;Then Eric the Saint asked the people of Finland to accept Christianity and make peace with him. But when they refused to accept it, he fought against them and conquered them by the sword, avenging the blood of the Christian men which they had spilled often and for a long time. And when he had scored such an honourable victory he prayed to God, falling on his knees with tears in his eyes. Then one of his good men asked why he cried, since he should rejoice over the honourable victory which he had won over the enemies of Jesus Christ and the holy faith. He then replied: I am happy and praise God since he gave us victory. But I greatly regret that so many souls were lost today, who could have gained eternal life if they had accepted Christianity.&quot; Erik persuaded an English Bishop Henry of Uppsala to remain in Finland to evangelize the Finns, later becoming a martyr.

There is no direct confirmation from other sources of this &quot;crusade&quot;. However, a papal bull from the early 1170s does mention complaints that &quot;the Finns always, when they are threatened by hostile armies, promise to keep the Christian creed and eagerly ask for preachers and teachers in the Christian law; but when the army returns, they deny the faith and despise and persecute the preachers badly&quot;. The bull implies that the Swedes already stood in a certain relation to the Finns and conducted expeditions against them. Moreover, a papal letter from 1216 reserved for Erik&#x27;s grandson Erik Knutsson the right to pagan lands conquered by his ancestors. If interpreted literally this might allude to conquests in Finland conducted by Saint Erik and Knut Eriksson (his grandfather and father). If the &quot;crusade&quot; took place, it was however probably no more than a sea-borne raid.

==Achievements==

Erik is portrayed in the legend as the ideal of a just ruler, who supported those who were oppressed by the mighty, and expelled the rude and unfair from his kingdom. He was supposedly responsible for codifying the laws of his kingdom, which became known as King Erik&#x27;s Law. Additionally, a hypothesis argues that he established a monastic chapter in Old Uppsala, begun by Benedictines which had come from the Danish abbey of Odense or from Vreta Abbey. If so, he would have established an unpopular system of tithes to support the Church similar to elsewhere in Europe. The legend strongly accentuates Erik&#x27;s personal piety: &quot;This saintly king of ours conducted many godly prayers and sessions, as well as fasting. He showed empathy with people in distress, was generous in giving alms to poor people, and forced himself to wear a shirt of horsehair, which he used when he was mortifying the flesh ... How he dealt with his secret enemy which is in the sexual parts, that is seen from the circumstance, that when he observed celibacy at fasting or religious celebrations, he often took a secret bath in a cold tub of water - even in wintertime - thus expelling non-permissible body heat with the cold.&quot; While much of this may reasonably be regarded as hagiographical stereotypes, the scientific investigation of his remains shows that he consumed much freshwater fish, indicating observance of fasts.

==Assassination==
While the legend asserts that Erik was unanimously accepted as king, the circumstances reveal that this was not the case. Apart from Karl Sverkersson in Östergötland, the Danish prince Magnus Henriksen had a claim to the throne, being the great-grandson of Inge I and the great-great-grandson of King Sweyn Estridson of Denmark.

According to the legend, the Devil inspired Magnus in his machinations. He used gifts and grand promises to attract Swedish nobles, including &quot;a mighty man in the kingdom&quot;. If this is based on sound tradition it may mean that Magnus allied with Karl of the rival House of Sverker. This assumption is supported by a statement in a late medieval chronicle.

Unbeknownst to the king, the allies gathered a considerable army and accosted Erik near Uppsala at Östra Aros when he attended Mass on the Feast of the Ascension in May 1160. The king, being informed of the approach of the enemy, heard mass to the end, then armed himself and the few men at hand, and went out to meet Magnus&#x27; troops. He was pulled off his horse onto the ground by the swarming rebels, who taunted and stabbed him, then beheaded him.

Some of the details of Erik&#x27;s violent end seem to be corroborated by a scientific investigation of his bones (see below). Otherwise, a papal bull to his son Knut confirms that he was killed by unspecified enemies. The short chronicle in the &quot;Västgötalagen&quot; from c. 1250 says: &quot;The twelfth was King Erik. He was too soon put to death at an unfortunate moment, He always made good deeds while he was alive, and was therefore rewarded by God and his angels; his bones rest in Uppsala. He has there presented many good portents by the grace of God.&quot; In a letter from 1172, Pope Alexander III complains that some people in Sweden had begun worshiping &quot;a man who had been killed in debauchery and feasting&quot;. Some scholars have assumed that this alludes to King Erik, and that the celebration of the Ascension Day was accompanied by feasting which enabled the surprise rebel attack. The identification is uncertain, however.

==Succession==

After killing Erik, Magnus Henriksen was able to take power. However, Magnus&#x27; reign proved short and he never fully consolidated the kingdom before likewise dying at rivals&#x27; hands in the following year. Likewise his slayer (and possible co-conspirator in Erik&#x27;s death) Karl Sverkersson, was assassinated in 1167 after Erik&#x27;s son Knut returned from exile. Knut defeated his Sverker rivals by 1173 and unified the kingdom in the decades before his death in 1195 or 1196. While Erik had been a short-lived and ultimately unsuccessful ruler, Knut established the House of Erik as the ruling dynasty and used the memory of his father to anchor his regime. He was indirectly succeeded by his son Erik Knutsson and grandson Erik Eriksson.

==Family==

Erik was married to Kristina Björnsdotter of the Danish House of Estridsen.

;Children:
#Knut, King of Sweden 1167–1196.
#Filip; some historians give him as the father of Holmger, the father of King Knut Långe.
#Katarina; married to Nils Blake.
#Margaret; married in 1185 Sverre I of Norway, died in 1202.

==Veneration==

The assassinated king Erik was buried in the Old Uppsala church, which he had rebuilt around the burial mounds of his pagan predecessors. In about 1167, as his son began to take power after the death of the latest Sverker king, Erik&#x27;s body was enshrined, although there is no direct evidence for this until c. 1220. Erik&#x27;s son Knut encouraged veneration of his father as a martyr, as seen from the so-called Vallentuna Calendar from 1198. Facts and fiction about his life were inseparably mixed together, including the alleged miracle of a fountain springing from the earth where the king&#x27;s head fell after being cut off. In 1273, a century after Knut consolidated Sweden, Erik&#x27;s relics and regalia were transferred to the present cathedral of Uppsala, built on the martyrdom site. The translation both displayed and extended the depth of his religious following.

The Evangelical Lutheran Church in America commemorates Erik on May 18 as &quot;Erik, King of Sweden, martyr, 1160&quot;. Erik is commemorated by the Roman Catholic Church on 18 May. Swedish traditions included processions on his feast day from the cathedral to Old Uppsala to petition for a good harvest. The Catholic St. Eric&#x27;s Cathedral, Stockholm, is named for King Erik.

===Reliquary===

Uppsala Cathedral () continues to display the relic casket. During the Middle Ages, each new Swedish king took his oath of office with his hands on the reliquary. The original medieval casket was melted down by Johan III, partly in order to pay off the Älvsborg ransom required by the Treaty of Stettin (1570) and to finance war against Russia. The present Renaissance style casket was commissioned in the 1570s to contain his relics by Johan&#x27;s Polish Catholic queen, Catherine Jagiellon.

In April, 2014, Swedish researchers opened the current reliquary to examine its contents, and the cathedral displayed the funerary crown during the forensic examination period. On March 19, 2016, researchers announced preliminary results that Erik&#x27;s relics contained injuries consistent with legends of his demise, and that they would soon publish a detailed account. Twenty-three of the twenty-four bones in the reliquary came from the same 35 to 40-year-old male (the other bone, a shinbone, is from a male from the same time period). The dead person was a strongly built man of about 171 centimeters, adequately fed and well-trained. Not only did the bones display healed wounds consistent with the Finnish crusade and a lifetime of battles, the decapitated body contained multiple stab wounds in the back from around the time of death. Further injuries to the vertebrae in the neck could only have happened outside of battle, since during battle a hauberk would have protected those neck vertebrae.

===Patronage===
Erik is the patron saint of Sweden and of its capital Stockholm and his crowned head is depicted in the city&#x27;s coat of arms.

Saint Erik is portrayed in art as a young king being murdered during Mass with the bishop Henry of Uppsala. In Uppsala Cathedral there is a series of late medieval paintings depicting Erik and Henry of Uppsala.

==Archaeological evidence of Trinity Church==

According to the legend, King Erik the Saint was slain while he attended the Mass at the &quot;ecclesia Sancte trinitatis&quot; &#x27;Trinity church&#x27; at Mons Domini. The current Trinity church in Uppsala was founded in the late 13th century and cannot be the church where Erik was slain. Scholars have discussed different locations of the older Trinity church, but the presence of pre-cathedral graves in the vicinity of the cathedral might suggest that the original Trinity church was located at the same spot as the cathedral. In an effort to elucidate this early history of the cathedral and Mons Domini, archaeologist Magnus Alkarp and geophysicist Jaana Gustafsson examined a large part of the cathedral with ground-penetrating radar (GPR). The results from this investigation confirmed the existence of an older building beneath the cathedral, in all the details corresponding with the outline of a 12th-century Romanesque church, which implies that the cathedral is the site of the earlier Trinity church.

<text>Ibn Abi Talib al-Dimashqi (full Arabic name: , ), , was a Syrian scholar and theologian of Islam.

He was born near Damascus and remained in his hometown until his death. He worked on several subjects and served as an Imam at al-Rabwa. Ibn Abi Talib al-Dimashqi was given the titles Shaykh al-Rabwa and Shams al-Din. He likely had a son named Abd Allah, hence his Abu Abd Allah.

Al-Dimashqi wrote an extended defence of Islam in response to the &quot;Letter from the People of Cyprus&quot;, itself a reworking of an earlier &quot;Letter to a Muslim Friend&quot; by the Christian bishop Paul of Antioch.

<text>Edward James Begley Sr. (March 25, 1901 – April 28, 1970) was an American actor of theatre, radio, film, and television. He won an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor for his performance in the film &quot;Sweet Bird of Youth&quot; (1962) and appeared in such classics as &quot;12 Angry Men&quot; (1957), &quot;Odds Against Tomorrow&quot; (1959) and &quot;The Unsinkable Molly Brown&quot; (1964). He was nominated for an Emmy Award for his portrayal of Matthew Harrison Brady in a television adaptation of &quot;Inherit the Wind&quot;. He is the father of the actor and environmental activist Ed Begley Jr.

==Early life==
Begley was born in Hartford, Connecticut, to two Irish immigrants, Hannah (née Clifford) and Michael Joseph Begley. After he dropped out of school as a fifth-grader, Begley ran away from home several times, going to work for &quot;carnivals, fairs, and small circuses&quot;. Later he sold brushes, delivered milk, and served four years in the United States Navy during World War I.

==Career==
Begley began his career as a Broadway and radio actor while in his teens. He appeared in the hit musical &quot;Going Up&quot; on Broadway in 1917 and in London the next year. He later acted in roles as Sgt. O&#x27;Hara in the radio show &quot;The Fat Man&quot;. His radio work included &quot;Stroke of Fate&quot; and a period as Charlie Chan, among other roles. He also starred in the 1950s radio program &quot;Richard Diamond, Private Detective&quot;, playing Lieutenant Walter Levinson, head of homicide at the 5th Precinct, Manhattan. He was elected a member of The Lambs in 1943. In the late 1940s, he began appearing regularly in supporting film roles.

In the 1952–1953 television season, Begley co-starred with Eddie Albert in the CBS sitcom &quot;Leave It to Larry&quot;. In 1954 Begley starred in the NBC Television show &quot;Robert Montgomery Presents&quot; in &quot;Big Boy&quot;, an episode sponsored by Lucky Strike, as Joe Grant, an engineer for the Union Pacific Railroad living in Cheyenne, Wyoming, who worked on the famous Union Pacific Big Boy steam locomotives. The show is about how Begley&#x27;s character copes with the transition from steam locomotives to diesel locomotives in the 1950s.

He won the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor for his role in &quot;Sweet Bird of Youth&quot; (1962). Some of his other notable films include &quot;Deadline – U.S.A.&quot; (1952), &quot;12 Angry Men&quot; (1957) as juror #10, &quot;Odds Against Tomorrow&quot; (1959), &quot;The Unsinkable Molly Brown&quot; (1964), and &quot;Wild in the Streets&quot; (1968). One notable role Begley played both on television (twice in 1955) and in the theatrical film (1956) is William (Bill) Briggs, one of the three primary characters in Rod Serling&#x27;s &quot;Patterns&quot;.

In 1956, he appeared in the Broadway production of &quot;Inherit the Wind&quot;, in the role of Matthew Harrison Brady. For this performance, he won the Tony Award for Best Featured Actor in a Play. In 1968 he appeared with Clint Eastwood in the classic Western &quot;Hang &#x27;Em High&quot;.

His other television work included appearances on the 1954 TV series &quot;Justice&quot;, &quot;Empire&quot;, &quot;The Virginian&quot;, &quot;Bonanza&quot;, &quot;The Fugitive&quot;, &quot;The Dick Van Dyke Show&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot; The Invaders&quot;, &quot;The Wild Wild West&quot;, &quot;My Three Sons&quot;, &quot;Wagon Train&quot; and &quot;Going My Way&quot;, with Gene Kelly. Among his many Broadway credits were &quot;All My Sons&quot; and &quot;Our Town&quot;.

==Personal life==
Begley married his first wife, Amanda Huff, in 1922; they had two children. Huff died in 1957. His second marriage ended in divorce and his third wife, Helen, survived him. Begley is father of actor Ed Begley Jr., from his extramarital relationship with Allene Jeanne Sanders. His younger brother, Martin Begley, worked briefly for him as his manager. Both were members of The Lambs in New York.

==Death==
Begley died of a heart attack while attending a party at the home of Jay Bernstein in Hollywood, California, on April 28, 1970. He is buried at the San Fernando Mission Cemetery in Mission Hills, California.

<doc id="779477" wikidata="Q365103" url="?curid=779477" title="Erik Knutsson">
<text>Erik Knutsson (; – 10 April 1216), sometimes known as Eric X, was King of Sweden between 1208 and 1216. Also known as &quot;Erik the Survivor&quot; (), he was, at his accession to the throne, the only remaining son of King Knut Eriksson and his queen, whose name may have been Cecilia.

==Struggles for the throne==

Nothing is known about his youth, but he may have been born around 1180 in Eriksberg royal manor. When Erik&#x27;s father, King Knut, died peacefully in 1195 or 1196, his four sons were youthful but not children. One of them had been hailed as heir to the throne by the grandees of the kingdom when Knut was still alive. Whether this was Erik we do not know, nor do the sources disclose the names of his three brothers. In spite of the precautions of King Knut, his sons were passed over in favour of Sverker Karlsson, the head of the rival dynasty of the Sverkers. Perhaps this was due to the influence of the mighty second-of-the-realm, Jarl Birger Brosa. As far as we know the succession took place without bloodshed.

Knut Eriksson&#x27;s sons continued to live in the Swedish royal court and were raised by King Sverker. Several years later, after the death of Birger Brosa, the brothers and their supporters brought forward claims to the throne. King Sverker did not acquiesce, at which point Erik and his brothers escaped to Norway where they stayed over the winter of 1204–05. Erik and his brothers had kin ties with the Norwegian Birkebeiner party since Jarl Håkon Galen was married to their cousin, and sought their support. In 1205, the brothers returned to Sweden with Norwegian backing. However, they were overcome by King Sverker in the Battle of Älgarås in Tiveden, where all three of Erik&#x27;s brothers were killed. Erik survived and once again fled to Norway where he remained for three years.

In 1208 he returned to Sweden under unknown circumstances but apparently with Birkebeiner assistance. Sverker on his side received troops from King Valdemar Sejr of Denmark. In January 1208 Erik nevertheless defeated Sverker in the Battle of Lena and slew the Danish commander Ebbe Sunesen, whose troops suffered great losses. Popular tradition depicted the event as a battle between Sweden and Denmark where &quot;two Danes ran for one Swede, and their backs were badly spanked by the Swedish men.&quot; A Danish folksong describes how &quot;the horses of the lords return bloodied, and the saddles are empty&quot;.

==Consolidation of power==

Now Erik took the name of King of Sweden. Birger Brosa&#x27;s son Knut had been appointed jarl at some stage but appears to have died in the Battle of Lena. Erik appointed Folke Jarl, probably another son of Birger Brosa, in his stead. This person was the originator of the Folkung party which played a political role in 13th-century Sweden and is frequently confused with the royal family that reigned after 1250.

Sverker and the archbishop Valerius fled to Denmark after the defeat and applied for the intervention of Pope Innocent III. Innocent ordered the bishops of Skara, Linköping and a third see to persuade Erik to come to terms with Sverker and return the royal prerogatives. In case of refusal, Erik would be censured by the Church. This did not have the desired effect, and in 1210 Sverker invaded Sweden in an attempt to reconquer the throne. However, he was defeated in the Battle of Gestilren in July 1210. This time Sverker was killed at the hands of Folke Jarl and his party; however, Folke was also slain together with many Folkungs. The location of the battle has been a matter of debate (Varv in Västergötland, Göstring Hundred in Östergötland, Gästre in Uppland). The banner under which King Erik&#x27;s troops fought, was preserved by his kinsman the lawspeaker Eskil Magnusson of the Bjälbo family in Skara, who in 1219 gave it as honorary to his visiting Icelandic colleague Snorre Sturlasson.

==Reign==

The achievement of Erik Knutsson was remarkable: without support by the Church, he was able to foment a network of followers in short time and defeat troops from Denmark, the major Scandinavian power at the time. After his victory, King Erik nevertheless quickly reconciled with the Danish king as well as the Catholic Church. In the same year 1210 he married princess Rikissa, daughter of the late Valdemar I of Denmark, and sister of Valdemar Sejr. This was to make up relations with Denmark, which had traditionally supported the Sverker dynasty, against the Norwegian-supported dynasty of Erik. In November 1210 he was the first (known) Swedish king who was crowned, by his former enemy Archbishop Valerius.

Not much is known about Erik&#x27;s reign; written documents are few and do not give much insight in affairs during his time. However, in 1216 Innocent III confirmed Erik in the rule, not only over his kingdom, but also over any pagan lands that he may conquer in the future. Thus King Erik entertained plans of military expansion to non-Christian areas across the Baltic Sea. For the rest, his reputation is good in Swedish historiography: the short chronicle incorporated in the &quot;Västgöta Law&quot; calls him a good &quot;årkonung&quot; (harvest king, king of good years).

Erik died suddenly of natural causes on 10 April 1216 in Näs Castle on the island of Visingsö. He was buried in the Varnhem Abbey. He did not leave a son at his demise, though Queen Rikissa gave birth to a boy named Erik shortly afterwards. Erik Knutsson&#x27;s immediate successor was Johan I, a son of his rival Sverker Karlsson. After Johan died of illness in 1222, Erik&#x27;s six-year-old son Erik was hailed as king.

<text>Changdeokgung (), also known as Changdeokgung Palace or Changdeok Palace, is set within a large park in Jongno District, Seoul, South Korea. It is one of the &quot;Five Grand Palaces&quot; built by the kings of the Joseon dynasty (1392–1897). As it is located east of Gyeongbokgung, Changdeokgung—along with Changgyeonggung—is also referred to as the &quot;East Palace&quot; ().

Changdeokgung was the most favored palace of many Joseon kings and retained many elements dating from the Three Kingdoms of Korea period that were not incorporated in the more contemporary Gyeongbokgung. One such element is the fact that the buildings of Changdeokgung blend with the natural topography of the site instead of imposing themselves upon it. Like the other Five Grand Palaces in Seoul, it was heavily damaged during the Japanese occupation of Korea (1910–1945). Currently, only about 30% of the pre-Japanese structures of the East Palace Complex (Changdeokgung together with Changgyeonggung) survive.

==History==

Changdeokgung was the second palace after Gyeongbokgung which had been established in 1395 as a primary palace. In the midst of strife for the throne between princes and vassals, authority of Gyeongbokgung was deteriorated. King Jeongjong enthroned by Prince Jeong-an (Yi Bang-won), who later became King Taejong, moved the capital to Gaegyeong, the capital of Goryeo, again in 1400 on the pretext of its superior geographical features, but in fact, to avert a power struggle. King Taejong (Yi Bang-won) soon took over the throne and returned to Hansŏng (present-day Seoul). Taejong was reluctant to build Gyeongbokgung Palace, which had been built by his political opponent Jeong Do-jeon, as well as being the place where he had killed his half-brothers for the throne, and therefore built new palace (named &quot;Changdeokgung).&quot; Construction of Changdeokgung began in 1405, and was completed in 1412. King Seonjo expanded the palace grounds by about 500,000 square meters, including &quot;Huwon&quot; (see below).

The palace was burnt to the ground during the Japanese invasion in 1592 by crowd and reconstructed in 1609 by King Seonjo and King Gwanghaegun. The palace burned down again in 1623 because of King Injo a political Revolt against Gwanghaegun. The palace was also attacked by the Manchu Qing but throughout its history of reconstruction and repair has remained faithful to its original design. Changdeokgung was the site of the royal court and the seat of government until 1868, when the neighboring Gyeongbokgung was rebuilt. Korea&#x27;s last Emperor, Sunjong lived here until his death in 1926.

Parts of the palace (notably Nakseon-jae hall) continued to function as a royal residence up to 1989, when both Princess Deokhye and Crown Princess Bangja died. Other post-WWII residents included Empress Sunjeong (Sunjong&#x27;s second wife), Crown Prince Yi Un, his son Yi Gu and Yi Gu&#x27;s wife Julia Mullock. However, residence in the palace in the post-war period was at the whim of the republican leaders, and after the Korean liberation in 1945 it would take the resignation of Rhee Syngman for former imperial family members to be allowed back in.

Today there are 13 buildings remaining on the palace grounds and 28 pavilions in the gardens, occupying 110 acres (45 hectares) in all and the area is designated as Historical Site No. 122. Buildings of note include Donhwamun (built in 1412, rebuilt in 1607, with a copper bell weighing 9 short tons or 8 metric tons), Injeongjeon (main hall), Seongjeongjeon (auxiliary office in the main hall), Huijeongdang (the king&#x27;s private residence, later used as a conference hall), Daejojeon (living quarters), and Nakseon-jae.

== Structures ==

The palace was built between Peak Maebong of Mt. Bugaksan in the back and River Geumcheon having flowing in the front influenced by the principle (&#x27;) in Feng Shui theory. Contrary to Gyeongbokgung whose main buildings are arranged in accurate architectural principle, however, buildings in Changdeokgung are disposed more freely without a regular system. Though its structure seems chaotic at a glance, all buildings are in harmony with the environment surrounding them.

Changdeokgung consists of governmental area () centering on Injeongjeon and Seonjeongjeon, royal private area (), Nakseonjae area in the east, and Huwon beyond the north hills. Most of major official buildings such as Injeongjeon, main hall of Changdeokgung, Seonjeongjeon, king&#x27;s office, and many of government offices () are placed in the front parts of the palace, beyond which there are royal private court for king and queen. Kings&#x27; houses like Seonjeongjeon, Huijeongdang, and Nakseonjae are surrounded in many folds of buildings and courts in case any outsider breaks in. The architectural style of Changdeokgung overall features simplicity and frugality because of Confucian ideology prosperous during the Joseon Period. Through the commitment to Confucianism, royal members and scholars used principles to maintain a bureaucratic state and socio-political order.

Structures of particular interest include:

* Donhwamun Gate—The main palace gate. Built in 1412, Donhwamun has a two-story pavilion-type wooden structure, and is the largest of all palace gates. Donhwamun was burned down during the Japanese invasion of 1592 and was restored in 1608.
* Geumcheongyo Bridge—Oldest bridge still extant in Seoul. Built 1411.
* Injeongjeon Hall (National Treasure)—The throne hall of Changdeokgung, it was used for major state affairs including the coronation of a new king and receiving foreign envoys. Originally built in 1405, it was rebuilt in 1610 after being burned down during the 1592 Japanese invasion, and a third time in 1804 after being destroyed by a fire.
* Seonjeongjeon Hall—An office for ruling officials. The king held daily meetings with ministers, reported on state affairs and seminars here.
* Huijeongdang Hall—Originally the king&#x27;s bed chamber, it became his workplace after Seonjeongjeon was deemed too small for conducting routine state affairs. The original Huijeongdang was destroyed by a fire in 1917. The reconstructed structure is completely different from the original due to recent Western influences. Wooden floorboards and carpets, glass windows, and chandeliers can be seen inside the building.
* Daejojeon Hall—Official residence of the queen. Destroyed by fire in 1917, it was rebuilt with materials taken from Gyeongbokgung. Daejojeon was used as a residence for the last empress of Joseon, allowing us a glimpse into the final years of the royal household of the Joseon dynasty.
* Juhamnu Pavilion (Kyujanggak)—Royal libraries stood in this area. Located in Huwon, the library was built in 1776 by King Jeongjo of Joseon, who was interested in reading, and was built for officials to read or discuss while looking down at the garden. The first floor consists of a library and an office, and the second floor consists of a reading room and a conference room. State exams were conducted in front of the pavilion on special occasions in presence of the king.
* Yeon-gyeongdang Residence—Built in 1827, it was an audience hall modeled after a typical literati house.

===Huwon===
Behind the palace lies the 78-acre (32 ha) Huwon (후원, 後苑, &quot;Rear garden&quot;) which was originally constructed for the use of the royal family and palace women. The garden incorporates a lotus pond, pavilions, and landscaped lawns, trees, and flowers. There are over 26,000 specimens of a hundred different species of trees in the garden and some of the trees behind the palace are over 300 years old. The garden for the private use of the king had been called &#x27;Geumwon&#x27; (금원, 禁苑, &quot;Forbidden garden&quot;) because even high officials were not allowed to enter without the king&#x27;s permission. It had also been called &#x27;Naewon&#x27; (내원, 內苑, &#x27;Inner garden&#x27;). Today Koreans often call it &#x27;Biwon&#x27; (비원, 秘院, &quot;Secret garden&quot;) which derived from the office of same name in the late 19th century. Though the garden had many other names, the one most frequently used through Joseon dynasty period was &#x27;Huwon&#x27;.

In September 2012, the Buyongjeong pavilion in the garden was re-opened after a year-long restoration project. The pavilion was restored based on the Donggwoldo from 1820, National Treasures of South Korea No. 249.

A variety of ceremonies hosted by the king were held in Huwon. In the early period of the Joseon dynasty, military inspections in which the king participated were often held here. King Sejo had troops parade and array before him or commanded them by himself in the garden. In addition, feasts were given, archery tournaments held, and fireworks enjoyed in Huwon.

The Ongnyucheon (옥류천, 玉流川, &quot;Jade Stream&quot;) area is of particular interest. It contains a U-shaped water channel carved in 1636 for floating wine cups, with a small waterfall and an inscribed poem on the boulder above it. The area also contains five small pavilions.

==World Heritage==
Changdeokgung was added to the UNESCO World Heritage List in 1997. The UNESCO committee stated the place was an &quot;outstanding example of Far Eastern palace architecture and garden design&quot; being exceptional because the buildings are &quot;integrated into and harmonized with the natural setting&quot; and adapted &quot;to the topography and retaining indigenous tree cover.&quot;

Portions of the palace were used to film the hugely popular Korean drama &quot;Dae Jang Geum&quot; in the first decade of the 21st century.

==Event==
From April to October 2018, Changdeokgung hosted the 2018 Changdeok Palace moonlight tour. Changdeok Palace moonlight tours are special events where visitors can experience life at the palace. It typically took about two hours and starts at Donhwamun Gate, the main gate of Changdeokgung, at 8 p.m.

<text>İsmail Nihat Erim (30 November 1912 – 19 July 1980) was a Turkish politician and jurist. He served as the 13th prime minister of Turkey for almost 14 months after the 1971 Turkish military memorandum. He was assassinated by the Revolutionary People&#x27;s Liberation Party/Front in Istanbul in 1980.

==Early life and education==

Nihat Erim was born in Kandıra to Raif Bey and Macide Hanım. After graduating from Istanbul University Law School in 1936, he studied further to earn his doctorate degree in Paris Law School in 1939. He returned to Turkey to become an assistant professor in 1939 and professor in 1942 at the Ankara University School of Law.

During his studies at the Istanbul University Erim was a member of the Turkish National Student Union.

== Political career ==
He was appointed as legal advisor to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in 1943 while he was still in the university. He also served as an advisor in the Turkish committee at the conference on the foundation of the United Nations in San Francisco in 1945. That same year, he was elected and served as the Kocaeli Province representative at the Turkish Parliament to join the Republican People&#x27;s Party (, CHP) group at the parliament. In 1949, he served as the minister of public works and later as deputy prime minister.

In 1950, when CHP lost the majority in the parliament after the elections, he lost his seat and became the chief politics editor and leading writer of the newspaper &quot;&quot;Ulus&quot; (&quot;Nation&quot;). When it was closed down by the government, he went on to publish his own newspaper, &quot;Yeni Ulus–Halkçı&quot; (&quot;New Nation–Populist&quot;&quot;) in 1953. In 1956, he participated at the negotiations on Cyprus in London, England. The same year, he was selected as the Turkish member of the European Commission on Human Rights to serve in this position until 1962. He led the Turkish committee on the preparation of the Cyprus constitution in 1959, following Zurich and London Agreements. He continued legally advising the Turkish committees at further negotiations on Cyprus at the United Nations.

After the military coup of 1960, once again he was elected and served as Kocaeli representative in the parliament, and this time as head of the CHP group. He was one of the focal points of internal conflicts of CHP, opposing the leader İsmet İnönü. The conflict resulted in him being ousted from the party in 1962. He was re-elected to the party&#x27;s ruling committee taking second highest votes, thus joining the party again.

He served as the Turkish representative at the Council of Europe between 1961 and 1970, and was elected as deputy secretary general in 1961. In 1969, he was appointed as a member of the UN International Law Commission in The Hague, Netherlands.

In Turkey, after a spree of political violence, and the coup by memorandum, the army forced the resignation of prime minister Süleyman Demirel on 12 March 1971. Nihat Erim, while still at the university, was advised to withdraw from his post in the Republican People&#x27;s Party (CHP) by the National Security Council, which was then heavily influenced by the military. 

=== Prime minister ===
He was appointed a neutral and technocratic prime minister on 26 March 1971 to form a &quot;national unity&quot; coalition government (see 33rd government of Turkey), the first of a series of weak governments until the elections in 1973. During his tenure he ruled out the existence of another nationality living in Turkey and the Kurdish population in the country was oppressed. One of the actions in regards of the Kurdish question during Erim&#x27;s prime ministry was the closing down of the Workers Party of Turkey (, TİP) for its recognition of the Kurds as a distinct ethnicity. 

Erim was forced to resign when 11 technocratic ministers of his cabinet resigned as a body on 3 December 1971. However, he was appointed once more by the President Cevdet Sunay, and he formed his second cabinet on 11 December 1971. He resigned on 17 April 1972 on health grounds, when his decision to promulgate decree laws was not backed by the parliament. His resignation was approved on 22 May 1972, and Ferit Melen, representative of the Van Province and minister of national defense in his cabinet, was appointed as the new prime minister and formed his own cabinet.

During his premiership, a significant contribution he made to Turkish politics was to form a ministry of culture (today in the form of the Ministry of Culture and Tourism), which was until then a mere department within the ministry of education. He appointed Talat Halman, journalist-writer, as the minister to this newly formed post. His government&#x27;s prohibition of opium poppy harvesting in June 1971 under US pressure fired controversy. A change in the constitution brought together a witch hunt for leftists, reaching its peak after the abduction and killing of the Israeli ambassador Efraim Elrom in May 1971. 

==Assassination==

Erim was shot to death by two gunmen near his home in Kartal, Istanbul on 19 July 1980. Radical leftist Turkish militant group Dev Sol (Revolutionary Left) claimed responsibility for the attack. The assassination might have accelerated the military coup on September 12 of that year led by chief of staff Kenan Evren. The motive behind the assassination is thought to be related to the approval by the parliament of the execution of three leftist militants, one being Deniz Gezmiş, during his service as prime minister.

Erim&#x27;s assassination was part of the wave of political violence in Turkey in the late 1970s between left-wing Marxist and right-wing ultranationalist groups.

== Personal life ==
Erim was married to Kamile Okutman, having two children: Işık Erim and Işıl Onalp (née Erim), as well as five grandchildren and ten great-grandchildren.

<text>Adolf (also spelt Adolph or Adolphe, Adolfo, and when Latinised Adolphus) is a given name with German origins.

The name is a compound derived from the Old High German &quot;Athalwolf&quot; (or &quot;Hadulf&quot;), a composition of &quot;athal&quot;, or &quot;adal&quot;, meaning &quot;noble&quot; (or &quot;had(u)&quot;-, meaning &quot;battle, combat&quot;), and &quot;wolf&quot;. The name is cognate to the Anglo-Saxon name &quot;Æthelwulf&quot; (also Eadulf or Eadwulf). The name can also be derived from the ancient Germanic elements &quot;Wald&quot; meaning &quot;power&quot;, &quot;brightness&quot; and wolf (Waldwulf).

Due to its extremely negative associations with the Nazi leader Adolf Hitler, the name has greatly declined in popularity since the end of World War II.

Similar names include Lithuanian Adolfas and Latvian Ādolfs. The female forms Adolphine and Adolpha are far more rare than the male names. Adolphus can also appear as a surname, as in John Adolphus, the English historian. 

==Popularity and usage==
During the 19th and early 20th centuries, Adolf was a popular name for baby boys in German-speaking countries and to a lesser extent also in French-speaking countries (spelled there as &quot;Adolphe&quot;). After Adolf Hitler came to power in Nazi Germany, the name Adolf became popular again, especially in 1933–1934 and 1937. Due to negative associations with Hitler, the name has declined in popularity as a given name for males since the 1940s. Adolf Dassler (born 1900), the founder of Adidas, used his nickname, &#x27;Adi&#x27;, in his professional life and for the name of his company. After 1945, a few German people have been named Adolf due to family traditions.

Similarly, the French version, &quot;Adolphe&quot;—previously a fairly common name in France and the name of a classic French novel—has virtually disappeared, along with the Italian version &quot;Adolfo&quot;. However, the Spanish and Portuguese version, &quot;Adolfo&quot;, has not become stigmatised in the same way and is still in common use in Spanish- and Portuguese-speaking countries.

<text>Ferenc Erkel ( , ; November 7, 1810June 15, 1893) was a Hungarian composer, conductor and pianist. He was the father of Hungarian grand opera, written mainly on historical themes, which are still often performed in Hungary. He also composed the music of &quot;Himnusz&quot;, the national anthem of Hungary, which was adopted in 1844. He died in Budapest.

==Biography==
Erkel was born in Gyula to an originally Danube Swabian Erkel family, a son of Joseph Erkel who was a musician. His mother was the Hungarian Klára Ruttkay. The libretti of his first three operas were written by Béni Egressy. Beside his operas, for which he is best known, he wrote pieces for piano and chorus, and a majestic &quot;Festival Overture&quot;. He acquainted Hector Berlioz with the tune of the Rákóczi March, which Berlioz used in &quot;The Damnation of Faust&quot;.

He headed the Budapest Philharmonic Orchestra (founded in 1853). He was also the director and piano teacher of the Hungarian Academy of Music until 1886. The Hungarian State Opera House in Budapest was opened in 1884, of which he was the musical director.

In 1839, he married Adél Adlers. Four of his sons participated in the composing of his later operas: Gyula (July 4, 1842, PestMarch 22, 1909, Újpest), Elek (November 2, 1843, PestJune 10, 1893, Budapest), László (April 9, 1844, PestDecember 3, 1896, Pozsony / Bratislava) and Sándor (January 2, 1846, PestOctober 14, 1900, Békéscsaba).

==In popular culture==
*Erkel was an internationally acknowledged chess player as well, and a founder of Pesti Sakk-kör (Budapest Chess Club).
*A department of the Opera House was established in 1911 in Budapest which also performs operas, named &quot;Erkel Színház&quot; (Erkel Theatre) since 1953.
*He was commemorated on gold and silver coins issued by the Hungarian National Bank for the 200th anniversary of his birth.

==Operas==

* &quot;Bátori Mária&quot; (1840, two acts; Mária Bátori is the lover of László, son of Coloman of Hungary)
* &quot;Hunyadi László&quot; (1844, four acts)
* &quot;Erzsébet&quot; (1857, three acts, only the second is by Erkel)
* &quot;Bánk bán&quot; (1861, three acts; Bánk bán is a palatine of Andrew II) – this opera is often thought of as the national opera of Hungary
* &quot;Sarolta&quot; (1862, three acts)
* &quot;Dózsa György&quot; (1867, five acts)
* &quot;Brankovics György&quot; (1874, four acts)

<text>Joseph Erlanger (January 5, 1874 – December 5, 1965) was an American physiologist who is best known for his contributions to the field of neuroscience. Together with Herbert Spencer Gasser, he identified several varieties of nerve fiber and established the relationship between action potential velocity and fiber diameter. They were awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1944 for these achievements.

==Biography==
Erlanger was born on January 5, 1874, at San Francisco, California. His family was Jewish and his parents both immigrated from the Kingdom of Württemberg, Germany and met in California during the Gold Rush. Joseph was the sixth of seven children born to the couple. He completed his Bachelor of Science in Chemistry from the University of California, Berkeley in 1895. He then completed his M.D. in 1899 from the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine in Baltimore, Maryland, where he finished second in his class.

Upon graduating, Erlanger interned at Johns Hopkins Hospital under William Osler and worked in a physiology laboratory. Erlanger also gave lectures at the school on digestion and metabolism. Erlanger also had an interest in cardiology, specifically the way that excitation transferred from the atrium to the ventricle and researched with Arthur Hirschfelder. Erlanger developed and patented a new type of sphygmomanometer that could measure blood pressure from the brachial artery. While working at Johns Hopkins School of Medicine in 1901, Erlanger published a paper on the digestive systems of canines. This paper caught the attention of William Henry Howell, a physiology professor at Johns Hopkins School of Medicine. Howell recruited Erlanger as an Assistant Professor. Erlanger was promoted to Associate Professor some time before 1906.

In 1906, Erlanger accepted a position as the first chair of physiology at the University of Wisconsin in Madison. In 1910, he left to take a position as professor at Washington University in St. Louis; the St. Louis position offered Erlanger more funding for his projects. Herbert Spencer Gasser, Erlanger&#x27;s former student at Wisconsin, joined Erlanger&#x27;s laboratory soon after the move. During World War I, the pair contributed to the research effort examining the effects of shock. As part of this work, Erlanger was able to produce heart block in an animal model by clamping the bundle of His and tightening it. Together, they managed to amplify the action potential of a bullfrog sciatic nerve in 1922 and published the results in the &quot;American Journal of Physiology&quot;. It is uncertain why the pair had such a sudden shift in interest to neuroscience, as Erlanger was already widely respected in the cardiology field.

Erlanger was elected to the United States National Academy of Sciences in 1922 and the American Philosophical Society in 1927.

Erlanger and Gasser were able to modify a Western Electric oscilloscope to run at low voltages. Prior to this modification, the only method available to measure neural activity was the electroencephalograph, which could only show large-scale electrical activity. With this technology, they were able to observe that action potentials occurred in two phases—a spike (initial surge) followed by an after-spike (a sequence of slow changes in potential). They discovered that neurons were found in many forms, each with their own potential for excitability. With this research, the pair discovered that the velocity of action potentials was directly proportional to the diameter of the nerve fiber. The partnership ended in 1931, when Gasser accepted a position at Cornell University. In 1944, they won the Nobel Prize in Medicine or Physiology for these discoveries.

He died of heart disease on December 5, 1965, at St. Louis, Missouri. The Joseph Erlanger House in St. Louis was designated a National Historic Landmark on December 8, 1976, as a building of national significance. On January 22, 2009, the International Astronomical Union named a crater on the Moon after him.

<text>Richard August Carl Emil Erlenmeyer (28 June 1825 – 22 January 1909), known simply as Emil Erlenmeyer, was a German chemist known for contributing to the early development of the theory of chemical structure and formulating the Erlenmeyer rule. He also designed the Erlenmeyer flask, a specialized apparatus ubiquitous in chemistry laboratories, which is named after him.

==Biography==

=== Early life and education ===
Erlenmeyer was born in Wehen, Duchy of Nassau (today Taunusstein, Hesse, near Wiesbaden), in 1825, the son of a Protestant minister. He enrolled in the University of Giessen to study medicine, but after attending lectures of Justus von Liebig changed to chemistry. In the summer of 1846 he went to Heidelberg for one year, and studied physics, botany and mineralogy, returning to Giessen in 1847. After serving as assistant to H. Will and then to Carl Remigius Fresenius, Erlenmeyer decided to devote himself to pharmaceutical chemistry. For this purpose he studied in Nassau, where he passed the state pharmaceutical examination, and shortly afterwards acquired an apothecary&#x27;s business, first at Katzenelnbogen and then in Wiesbaden. He became dissatisfied with pharmacy and returned to chemistry, finishing his doctorate at Giessen in 1850.

In 1855 he moved to Heidelberg to work on the chemistry of fertilizers in the laboratory of Robert Bunsen. He wished to teach, but Bunsen&#x27;s associates were not allowed to take private students. Therefore, with his wife&#x27;s help, he converted a shed into a private laboratory. In 1857 he became privatdocent and his habilitation thesis &quot;On the manufacture of the artificial manure known as superphosphate&quot; contained a description of several crystalline substances which greatly interested Robert Bunsen. It was while at Heidelberg that Erlenmeyer was brought under the influence of August Kekulé, whose theoretical views he was one of the first to adopt. He was the first to suggest, in 1862, that double and triple bonds could form between carbon atoms, and he made other important contributions to the development of theories of molecular structure.

=== Academic career ===
In 1863 he became associate professor at the University of Heidelberg. In 1868 he was hired as full professor in Munich to take charge of the laboratories of the new Munich Polytechnic School, a post which he held until his retirement from teaching in 1883.

His work mostly focused on theoretical chemistry, where he suggested the structural formula for naphthalene. The Erlenmeyer rule states that all alcohols in which the hydroxyl group is attached directly to a double-bonded carbon atom become aldehydes or ketones (cf. keto-enol tautomerism).

Erlenmeyer&#x27;s practical investigations were concerned mostly with aliphatic compounds. In 1859 he synthesised aminohexoic acid and proceeded to study the general behavior of albuminoids on hydrolysis. He worked out methods to determine the relative amounts of leucine and tyrosine, which are produced during the degradation of several substances of this class, and was the first (1860) to understand the nature of glycide and to suggest that this substance is related to glycerol in the same way as is metaphosphoric acid to orthophosphoric acid. In the following year he studied the action of hydroiodic acid on glycerol, and showed that the product was isopropyl- and not propyl iodide. His investigations of the higher alcohols produced during fermentation yielded the important proof that these alcohols do not belong to the normal series.

His other work included the isolation of glycolic acid from unripe grapes (1864), synthesis of sodium oxalate by heating sodium formate (1868), hydrolysis of ether to alcohol (1858), synthesis of phenyl-lactic acid (1880), preparation of pyruvic acid by the distillation of tartaric acid (1881) and the formation of carbostyril from quinoline (1885).

His investigations in the aromatic series include isomerism of the cinnamic acids and the synthesis of tyrosine from phenylalanine (1882). In 1875, by nitrating benzoic acid, Erlenmeyer disproved the prevalent opinion that more than three nitrobenzoic acids exist.

In 1860 he published a description of the conical flask that bears his name.
==Lineage==
Emil Erlenmeyer is the grandfather of Hans Erlenmeyer.

<text>Kalajoki (; literally translated the &quot;fish river&quot;) is a coastal town and municipality of Finland. It is located in the immediate vicinity of the Gulf of Bothnia in the province of Oulu and is part of the Northern Ostrobothnia region.

The town has a population of () and covers an area of of which is water. The population density is .

The municipality is unilingually Finnish.

== History ==

The first reference to Kalajoki can be found from the beginning of 16th century and it got the status of a parish in 1525, it was designated as a regional parish in 1545. This status ended with the abolishment of the parish form of organization in the early 1860s. Kalajoki was a significant market place and controlled the whole region&#x27;s tar trading. By the end of 19th century the meaning of tar was diminishing as a good and the importance of Kalajoki was reduced thereafter.

The tar trade was a derivative of the forestry industry, and Kalajoki has long been the location of forestry activities. There are still sawmills in operation in the city today.

In addition to tar trading, Kalajoki has long been a farming community, producing a variety of agricultural products, including wheat and rye. There are many farms still operating in the city, and there is a weekly market during the spring and summer months where local farmers and merchants sell their products.

== Government ==

There were many attempts to reorganize Kalajoki as a city, which would confer additional authorities on the municipality. The first attempt was in 1865, and there were several subsequent attempts throughout the 20th century. Kalajoki was finally reorganized as a city in 2002.

Just like any municipality in Finland, the city of Kalajoki is composed of several sub-units, called a kylä. The following compose the city of Kalajoki: Vasankari, Plassi, Mehtäkylä, Pohjankylä, Pitkäsenkylä, Etelänkylä, Kääntä, Tynkä, Rahja, Kurikkala, Kärkinen, Typpö, Rautio.

Every four years, the voters of Kalajoki elect a city council of 35 members which meets monthly. The Council then elects a governing council of nine members that meets more regularly to transact the business of the city. As of the most recent municipal election in 2004, 19 members of the city council are from the Centre Party, 6 are from the local Pro Kalajoki Party, 4 are from the centre-right National Coalition Party, 3 are from the Left Alliance, 2 are from the centre-left Social Democratic Party, and one member is from the Christian Democrats Party.

The next municipal elections will be held throughout Finland in 2012.

The municipality of Rautio was consolidated with Kalajoki in 1973. The neighboring municipality of Himanka was consolidated with Kalajoki on January 1, 2010.

== Tourism ==

Kalajoki is a well known tourist attraction place in Finland due to long sandy beaches at shores of the Bothnian Bay, and related activities.

<text>Karl Konstantin Albrecht Leonhard [[Graf]] von Blumenthal (30 July 1810 – 21 December 1900) was an officer of the Prussian Army and field marshal of the Imperial German Army, chiefly remembered for his decisive intervention at the Battle of Königgrätz in 1866, his victories at Wörth and Weißenburg, and above all his refusal to bombard Paris in 1870 during the siege, of which he was in command.

==Early life==


Born in Schwedt, Brandenburg, on 30 July 1810, Leonhard was the son of Ludwig Albrecht von Blumenthal (1774–1813) and his wife Friederike Charlotte Dorothea von Below (1783–1853). Ludwig was a captain in the Brandenburg Dragoon Regiment who was wounded in the Battle of Dennewitz, and later died from his injuries at Potsdam. Leonhard had a younger brother, Karl (1811-1903), who would later serve as a major-general in the army. 

Leonhard was brought up on his grandfather&#x27;s estate at Reddentin, where his uncle Gustav von Below was founding what would become the Pentecostal movement. He was educated at the military schools of Culm and Berlin, entering the Guards as a 2nd lieutenant in 1827, and studied at the Berlin General War School (later called the Prussian Military Academy). 

== Military career ==
After serving in the Rhine Province, von Blumenthal joined the topographical division of the general staff in 1846. As lieutenant of the 31st foot, he took part in 1848 in the suppression of the Berlin riots, and in 1849 was promoted captain on the general staff. The same year he served on the staff of General Eduard von Bonin in the First Schleswig War, and so distinguished himself, particularly at Fredericia, that he was appointed chief of the staff of the Schleswig-Holstein army, when the previous chief of staff, Captain von Delius, was killed.

In 1850, von Blumenthal was general staff officer of the mobile division under Tietzen in Hesse-Kassel. He was sent on a mission to England in that year (4th class of Red Eagle), and on several subsequent occasions. Having attained the rank of lieutenant-colonel, he was appointed personal adjutant to Prince Frederick Charles in 1859. In 1860 he became colonel of the 31st, and later of the 71st, regiment. He was chief of the staff of the III Corps when, on the outbreak of the Second Schleswig War of 1864, he was nominated chief of the general staff of the army against Denmark, and displayed so much ability, particularly at Dybbøl and the night attack on the island of Als, which he masterminded and which ended the war, that he was promoted to major-general and awarded the order &quot;Pour le Mérite&quot;.

In the Austro-Prussian War of 1866, von Blumenthal was Chief of Staff of the Second Army, commanded by the Crown Prince Frederick William. It was upon this army that the brunt of the fighting fell, and its arrival at Königgrätz saved the day. Von Blumenthal&#x27;s own part in these battles and in the campaign generally was most conspicuous. At Königgrätz the crown prince said to him, &quot;I know to whom I owe the conduct of my army&quot;, and von Blumenthal soon received promotion to lieutenant-general and the oak-leaves to the order &quot;Pour le Mérite&quot;. He was also made a knight of the Hohenzollern Order. From 1866 to 1870, he commanded the 14th Division at Düsseldorf.

In the Franco-Prussian War of 1870–71, von Blumenthal was chief of staff of the Third Army under the crown prince. Eighteen other members of his family also fought in this war, including both his sons and three nephews, of whom two were killed. Von Blumenthal&#x27;s soldierly qualities and talent were most conspicuous in the critical days preceding the battle of Sedan, and his services in the war have been considered as scarcely less valuable and important than those of Moltke himself. Bismarck said: He directed the Siege of Paris and resisted calls to bombard it. He also directed the operations conducted by General von der Tann around Orleans, and defended the Grand Duke of Mecklenburg from interference by Moltke.

Von Blumenthal represented Germany at the British manoeuvres at Chobham in 1871, and was given the command of the IV Corps at Magdeburg. In 1873, he was promoted to general of the infantry, and ten years later he was given the title of Count. In 1888 he was made a general field marshal, after which he served as commander of the 4th and 3rd army inspections before eventually retiring in 1896.

In 1900, Kaiser Wilhelm II announced through the &quot;Court Circular&quot; that von Blumenthal would be made a Prince (&quot;Fürst&quot;). However, before this could be enacted the field marshal died that same year at Quellendorf near Köthen on 21 December. He was interred in the family crypt at Krampfer.

==Legacy==
He was noted (among others by the English journalist William Howard Russell who followed him during the Franco-Prussian War) for his kindliness and sense of humour. 

Like the Crown Prince, Moltke and other key Prussian leaders, he had an English wife, Delicia Vyner and it was widely thought in conservative circles that this was the basis of a liberal Prussian clique. His least appreciated but arguably most important work was the development of the doctrine of Fire and Infiltration, the basis of Blitzkrieg.

<text>Federico Errázuriz Echaurren (Santiago, November 16, 1850 – Valparaíso, July 12, 1901) was a Chilean politician who served as the 12th president of Chile.

==Early life==
He was son of the president Federico Errázuriz Zañartu and of Eulogia Echaurren García-Huidobro. He studied at San Ignacio School of Santiago de Chile and in the National Institute of Santiago, where he received a bachelor&#x27;s degree. He was joined the University of Chile where he became a lawyer on March 23, 1873.

In 1875 he married Gertrudis Echeñique Mujica, a direct descendant of the governor of Chile Martín de Mujica, of whom she was the last heir of the El Huique; They had six children: Juan José, Elena, Federico, Eulogia, Jorge and María Jesús.

Errázuriz Echaurren joined the Liberal Party and started his political life in 1876, when he was elected as a deputy for Constitución. He was reelected in 1879 and was characterized as a centrist politician. He did not participate in the campaigns of the War of the Pacific, preferring instead to remain in his hacienda, but during the religious controversies between Church and State under President Domingo Santa María, he joined the conservative forces. In August 1890, President José Manuel Balmaceda named him Minister of War and Navy, under the conciliation cabinet of Belisario Prats; but when Prats resigned his position, so did Errázuriz, and both joined the opposition. In 1891 he was one of the signers of the Act of Deposition of Presidente Balmaceda. Even so, he did not participate in the 1891 Chilean Civil War.

After the end of the civil war, he was elected deputy for Cauquenes and Constitución (1891–1894). His ill-health forced him to travel to Germany, in search of specialists. During a year and a half, he travelled through Europe, even visiting Pope Leo XIII. He returned to Chile and in 1894 was elected Senator for Maule and designed Minister of Justice and Public Instruction, under President Jorge Montt.

==Presidency==

After a very contested election, Errázuriz Echaurren was elected President and assumed power on September 18, 1896. He took over office at the age of 46, but by then he already was showing the symptoms of the illness that was going to kill him before the end of his mandate. Both his supporters and the opposition considered him a man of great political cunning, but while his supporters saw him as a true patriot, the opposition pictured him as a corrupt politician capable of the worst excesses. These characterizations made his rule difficult from the start, since he had a majority in the Senate but not in the Chamber of Deputies. He received a country where the economic situation had steadily worsened due to the progressive crisis of the nitrate industry and the associated unemployment and social crisis caused by it; while the international relationships with Perú, Bolivia, and Argentina were also in a critical state. To counteract the instability he tried to broaden the political consensus of his supporting coalition by forming a cabinet made up of three liberals and three conservatives, with the Liberal Aníbal Zañartu as Minister of the Interior. This seemingly impeccable arrangement only lasted for two months. In what was the norm during the governments of the period, Errázuriz Echaurren went on to have 17 cabinets during his administration.

Between 1896 and 1897, he named Carlos Antúnez as his Minister of the Interior and charged him with guaranteeing free and &quot;clean&quot; elections. Antúnez was in charge until after the general election of March 1897, considered his mission accomplished afterwards and resigned. These elections were greeted with general acceptance, but did not change the political support for the government, so Errázuriz Echaurren had to continue trying to achieve a balance, to maintain a semblance of political stability. In the course of this search, Errázuriz Echaurren became closer and closer to the Conservative Party, until in 1898 he named Carlos Walker Martínez, president of the Conservatives as Minister of the Interior. Nonetheless, he remained always loyal to the coalition that elected him, and for example never allowed any member of the Radical party into any of his cabinets. Errázuriz&#x27;s responses to the cabinet crisis, elections and in general to any problem within his administration was always consistent. He never took any decision without first consulting his political basis in congress, and always subordinated himself to the will of the political parties.

===Public policies===
Errázuriz&#x27;s administration was characterized by a marked advancement in public education. Under his direction several institutions for the development of health professionals were created, such as courses for matrons and nurses, the Professional School for Girls of Valparaíso, the Commercial Institute of Santiago, and new high schools in Santiago and Iquique. This administration also contributed with new tram systems in Santiago, Valparaíso, San Felipe and San Bernardo. Errázuriz Echaurren contracted the new sewerage system for Santiago, and the water reservoir of Peñuelas, which still provides the water for Valparaíso.

He faced his biggest problems in the area of monetary policy. The much-wanted return to the metallic conversion, to which he was opposed but which was favored by the parliamentary majorities, was shelved due to the threat of a war with Argentina. The delay of the measure until 1902 pushed the banking system to near collapse, forcing the government to issue and circulate paper money.

===Argentine problem===

The biggest problem that the administration had to face was on the international area. Chile and Argentina were on the brink of war, due to long-standing border disputes stemming from the peace treaty of 1881, the situation of the Puna de Atacama (a disputed territory formerly owned by Bolivia and claimed by both countries) and an ongoing naval arms race. President Errázuriz was avowedly pacifist, but at one point both countries got to the point of calling up their reserve soldiers. The final solution was to submit the problem to an arbitration by the King of England, the adjudication of which was not resolved until 1902, during the administration of Germán Riesco, President Errázuriz&#x27;s cousin and successor.

To celebrate the decision to arbitrate and avoid war, President Errázuriz and Argentinian President Julio Argentino Roca held an international meeting in the Strait of Magellan. This meeting, known as the , took place in front of the city of Punta Arenas on February 15, 1899.

===Succession controversy===
Like most presidents of the time, he became involved early in the election of his successor. The Liberal-Conservative Coalition that supported him went on to proclaim Germán Riesco, cousin and brother-in-law of President Errázuriz, as their candidate on March 8, 1901. The President responded in a public letter: 

[...] as I have the firm purpose of not intervening in any political campaign and I don&#x27;t have or want to have any candidate, I am firmly resolved to prevent the participation of any member of this administration in the upcoming elections.

===Health problems and death===
Errázuriz&#x27;s ill-health continued to plague him during all his period. Before his election, he already had had to travel to Germany in 1893 for treatment, and the death of his oldest son from tuberculosis in 1897 weakened him further. On June 11, 1900, he had to delegate his mandate to Elías Fernández Albano, the Vice President, so he could travel again to seek medical advice. He reassumed his duties on October 11 of the same year, but died suddenly of cerebral thrombosis on July 12, 1901, while in Valparaíso. He was constitutionally replaced by his Minister of the Interior Aníbal Zañartu, who assumed as Vice President for the remainder of his mandate.

== Legacy ==
In the late 18th century, zoologist and paleontologist Rodolfo Amando Philippi named a newly discovered species of plant after Errázuriz Echaurren: &quot;Errazurizia glandulifera&quot;, a &quot;curious leguminous plant with &#x27;long rat-tail spikes of flowers of a peculiar purple and yellow&#x27; with an &#x27;incense-like&#x27; scent.

<text>Fat Man and Little Boy (released in the United Kingdom as Shadow Makers) is a 1989 American epic historical 
war drama film directed by Roland Joffé, who co-wrote the script with Bruce Robinson. The story follows the Manhattan Project, the secret Allied endeavor to develop the first nuclear weapons during World War II. The film is named after &quot;Little Boy&quot; and &quot;Fat Man&quot;, the two bombs dropped on the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, respectively. The film starred Paul Newman as Leslie Groves and Dwight Schultz as J. Robert Oppenheimer, with supporting roles filled by Bonnie Bedelia, John Cusack, Laura Dern, John C. McGinley and Natasha Richardson.

==Plot==
In September 1942, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers Colonel Leslie Groves, who oversaw the construction of the Pentagon, is assigned to head the ultra-secret Manhattan Project, to beat the Germans, who have a similar nuclear weapons program.

Groves picks University of California, Berkeley, physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer to head the project team. Oppenheimer was familiar with northern New Mexico from his boyhood days when his family owned a cabin in the area. For the new research facility, he selects a remote location on top of a mesa adjacent to a valley called Los Alamos Canyon, northwest of Santa Fe.

The different personalities of the military man Groves and the scientist Oppenheimer often clash in keeping the project on track. Oppenheimer in turn clashes with the other scientists, who debate whether their personal consciences should enter into the project or whether they should remain purely researchers, with personal feelings set aside.

Nurse Kathleen Robinson and young physicist Michael Merriman question what they are doing. Working with little protection from radiation during an experiment, Michael drops a radioactive component during an experiment dubbed Tickling the Dragon&#x27;s Tail and retrieves it by hand to avoid disaster, but is exposed to a lethal dose of radiation. In the base hospital, nurse Kathleen can only watch as he develops massive swelling and deformation before dying a miserable death days later.

While the technical problems are being solved, investigations are undertaken to thwart foreign espionage, especially from communist sympathizers who might be associated with socialist organizations. The snooping reveals that Oppenheimer has had a young mistress, Jean Tatlock, and he is ordered by Groves to stop seeing her. After he breaks off their relationship without being able to reveal the reasons why, she is unable to cope with the heartache and is later found dead, apparently a suicide.

As the project continues in multiple sites across America, technical problems and delays cause tensions and strife. To avoid a single point of failure plan, two separate bomb designs are implemented: a large, heavy plutonium bomb imploded using shaped charges (&quot;Fat Man&quot;), and an alternative design for a thin, less heavy uranium bomb triggered in a shotgun or gun-type design (&quot;Little Boy&quot;). The bomb development culminates in a detonation in south-central New Mexico at the Trinity Site in the Alamogordo Desert (05:29:45 on July 16, 1945), where everyone watched in awe at the spectacle of the first mushroom cloud with roaring winds, even miles away. Both bombs, Fat Man and Little Boy, were successful, ushering in the Atomic Age.

==Basis==
Most of the characters were real people and most of the events were real happenings, with some theatrical license used in the film.

The character of Michael Merriman (John Cusack) is a fictional composite of several people and is put into the film to provide a moral compass as the &quot;common man&quot;. Part of the character is loosely based on the scientist Louis Slotin. Contrary to Merriman&#x27;s death in the movie, Slotin&#x27;s accident and death occurred after the dropping of the two bombs on Japan, and his early death was feared by some as karma after the event. A very similar mishap happened less than two weeks after the Nagasaki bomb, claiming the life of Harry Daghlian. Both incidents occurred with the same plutonium core, which became known as the demon core.

Even before Oppenheimer was chosen to be the lead scientist of the Manhattan Project, he was under surveillance by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) due to suspected Communist views. Once selected, the surveillance was constant: every single phone call was recorded and every contact with another person was noted. After he was picked to head the laboratory, he met with Tatlock only one time, in mid-June 1943, where she told him that she still loved him and wanted to be with him. After spending that night together, he never saw her again. She died by suicide six months after their meeting.

==Production==
The filming took place in the fall of 1988 mainly outside Durango, Mexico, where the Los Alamos research facility was re-created. The re-creation of the Los Alamos laboratory entailed 35 buildings and cost over $2 million to construct in 1988.

==Soundtrack==
The film includes a musical score by long-time composer Ennio Morricone. The entire score and extra music were released in 2011, by La La Land Records. The two-CD release has source cues, portions of others, and alternate takes that were dropped from the final cut of the film. Produced by Dan Goldwasser and mastered by Mike Matessino. The CD includes liner notes by film music writer Daniel Schweiger. Only 3,000 copies were released.

==Reception==
The film has been criticized for distortion of history for dramatic effect, and miscasting in its choices of Paul Newman for the role of General Groves, and Dwight Schultz for the role of Oppenheimer. Noted critic Roger Ebert felt the film lackluster, giving it 1½ stars, saying, &quot;The story of the birth of the bomb is one of high drama, but it was largely intellectual drama, as the scientists asked themselves, in conversations and nightmares, what terror they were unleashing on the Earth. &quot;Fat Man and Little Boy&quot; reduces their debates to the childish level of Hollywood stereotyping.&quot; The film holds a 50% rating on review aggregate Rotten Tomatoes based on 24 reviews.

The film made under $4 million on its original release. It entered the 40th Berlin International Film Festival.

<text>Colonel Robert Sheldon Scott (November 30, 1913 – February 5, 1999) was a soldier of the United States Army who received the Medal of Honor for actions during World War II (1939/1941-1945). He was born in Washington, D. C., and graduated later from the University of New Mexico in 1937 with a degree in English. In September 1941, Scott was drafted into the U.S. Army. After attending Officer&#x27;s Candidate School he received a commission.

Scott, who was a Second Lieutenant at the time of his action, was a member of the 172nd Infantry Regiment of the 43rd Infantry Division in the southwest Pacific Ocean, that successfully captured the Munda Point airstrip on the island of New Georgia, Solomon Islands from its Japanese defenders in the summer of 1943. On July 29, 1943 Japanese soldiers counter-attacked against the American assault on Morrison-Johnson Hill overlooking the airfield. Scott commanded the 3rd platoon, &quot;C&quot; Company, that he led into attack against the Japanese fortified position. 75 yards from the enemy soldiers, Scott became detached from the rest of his men. Despite being alone, being shot in the left hand and receiving a shrapnel wound to the head, Scott used the combination of his M1 carbine and grenades to kill 28 Japanese soldiers, causing the rest of the attacking soldiers to withdraw. Scott&#x27;s colleagues consequently took the hill and later the airstrip.

Scott remained in the Pacific theatre after the New Georgia campaign and was discharged after the end of the war. He re-joined in 1947, serving in the Korean War (1950-1953), and rose to the rank of colonel before retiring in 1966. 

He was awarded the Medal of Honor in October 1944 at Aitape, New Guinea. In 1997 New Mexico, his home state, declared November 30 Robert Scott Day in his honor. He died at his home in Santa Fe, New Mexico on February 5, 1999, aged 85.

He is buried in Santa Fe National Cemetery Santa Fe, New Mexico. His grave can be found in Plot: 9-460.

<doc id="779538" wikidata="Q986722" url="?curid=779538" title="Kannonkoski">
<text>Kannonkoski is a Finnish municipality located in the Central Finland region. The municipality has a population of () and covers an area of of which , or 19%, is water. The population density is . Neighbouring municipalities are Karstula, Kivijärvi, Saarijärvi, Viitasaari and Äänekoski.

The municipality is unilingually Finnish.

== History ==
Kannonkoski as a settlement name is very new, originally only referring to the rapids which connect the lake Kannonjärvi to the lake Kivijärvi. The toponym &quot;kannonn Maa&quot; was mentioned in 1552, referring to hunting grounds of the people of Sysmä in this area. The people of Pälkäne also had hunting grounds around the rapids and the name &quot;Kannonkoski&quot; may be derived from &quot;Kantokylä&quot;, a village in Pälkäne. By 1558 the area had got permanent Savonian settlers, who established the village of &quot;Kantojärvi&quot; (transcribed as &quot;Kandoijerffuij&quot;). Rautalampi, including this area, became a separate parish in 1561.

Viitasaari was separated from Rautalampi in 1635. At the time, it included all of the villages that would later become parts of the municipality of Kannonkoski. Kivijärvi was split off from Viitasaari in 1904.

In 1919 it was decided that the area should get its own parish, which happened in 1931. The parish was formed from parts of Viitasaari and Kivijärvi. The area became a municipality in 1934. The church and administrative center were placed in the village of &quot;Pudasjärvi&quot;, however because a municipality called Pudasjärvi already existed, the new municipality was named Kannonkoski after the nearby rapids.

=== Orthodox monks ===
During the Winter War, 117 monks from the Valamo monastery in the lake Ladoga were evacuated. They arrived in Kannonkoski in 1939, bringing various icons and relics with them. The monks lived in the Piispala school, which at the time was closed due to the ongoing war.

The monks left Kannonkoski in the autumn of 1940 after they had purchased an old manor in Heinävesi, where the New Valamo monastery was soon established. 27 monks died during the evacuation and were buried in the graveyard of the Lutheran Kannonkoski church.

===Proposed Suomenselkä municipality===
Kannonkoski, Karstula, Kivijärvi and Kyyjärvi planned to merge into the from January 1, 2022. Karstula, Kivijärvi and Kyyjärvi accepted the merger proposal, but Kannonkoski did not. After Kannonkoski left out of the planned merger, Kivijärvi also left out, and later the merger project of the remaining Karstula and Kyyjärvi failed at the Kyyjärvi municipal council meeting held on May 17, 2021, and the Ministry of Finance does not propose a forced merger either.

==Nature==
There are all together 81 lakes in Kannonkoski. Biggest lakes are Kivijärvi, Vuosjärvi and Kannonselkä.

<doc id="779540" wikidata="Q3535483" url="?curid=779540" title="2005 British &amp; Irish Lions tour to New Zealand">
<text>In 2005, the British &amp; Irish Lions rugby union team toured New Zealand for the first time since 1993, playing seven matches against first and second division teams from the National Provincial Championship, one match against the New Zealand Maori team, and three test matches against New Zealand (the All Blacks). The Lions lost the test series 3–0, the first time in 22 years that they lost every test match on tour.

The team was managed by former England and Lions player Bill Beaumont, coached by former England coach Sir Clive Woodward, and originally captained by Ireland captain Brian O&#x27;Driscoll. O&#x27;Driscoll suffered a controversial tour-ending injury two minutes into the first test, and Wales captain Gareth Thomas took over as captain for the final four games of the tour.

The poor test results of the 2005 Lions, despite having one of the most experienced playing squads and the largest management team of any Lions tour, led to criticism of Woodward, particularly his selection policy, and prompted commentators to question the future of the Lions.

This tour followed the Lions&#x27; 2001 tour to Australia and preceded the 2009 tour to South Africa.

==Schedule==
The Lions&#x27; campaign involved a warm-up match against Argentina (which was retroactively awarded test status by the International Rugby Board in March 2008) before the departure for New Zealand, three tests against the All Blacks, and several tour matches, where the quality of the opposition was expected to be high. This proved to be the case against New Zealand Maori and Auckland, and most of the other tour matches were close for at least the first half. But the match against Manawatu (the Lions&#x27; only opponent from the second division of New Zealand&#x27;s domestic league, the National Provincial Championship) was a one-sided affair, the Lions winning by a score of 109–6.

==Squad==
The 44-man tour squad was announced on 11 April 2005, and included 20 players from England, 11 from Ireland, 10 from Wales and three from Scotland. Ireland&#x27;s Brian O&#x27;Driscoll was named as captain. Among the English players selected were two who had retired from international rugby (Neil Back and Lawrence Dallaglio), and one who was returning from a long-term injury (Richard Hill).

Three players did not travel to New Zealand with the bulk of the touring party: Jason Robinson was excused from the first three tour matches to spend time with his pregnant wife; Stephen Jones and Gareth Thomas were forced to delay their departures due to commitments to their French clubs. Jones arrived in New Zealand on 31 May, before the Lions played their first tour match, while Robinson arrived on 7 June. For a time, it was doubtful whether Thomas would be able to contend for a spot in the first test, as he had not been released by his club, Toulouse. However, Toulouse lost in the Top 14 semi-finals, allowing Thomas to leave for New Zealand, also arriving on 7 June. Thomas later replaced O&#x27;Driscoll as tour captain after O&#x27;Driscoll suffered a dislocated shoulder in the first test. Michael Owen also briefly left the tour two weeks in to attend the birth of his second child.

===Additions to the squad===
Injured England players Jonny Wilkinson, Phil Vickery and Mike Tindall were pencilled in to be added to the squad, subject to them regaining fitness. Only Wilkinson subsequently did so and was called up on 8 May.

Additional players were called up when players suffered injury (and in one case a ban) during the tour proper:

* Jonny Wilkinson (Newcastle Falcons and England) – added 8 May
* Mark Cueto (Sale Sharks and England) – added 17 May for Iain Balshaw
* Simon Shaw (Wasps and England) – added 2 June for Malcolm O&#x27;Kelly
* Simon Easterby (Llanelli Scarlets and Ireland) – added 4 June for Lawrence Dallaglio
* Ryan Jones (Ospreys and Wales) – added 10 June for Simon Taylor
* Brent Cockbain (Ospreys and Wales) – added 26 June for Danny Grewcock, who was banned for two months after biting Keven Mealamu during the first test.
* Jason White (Sale Sharks and Scotland) – added 27 June for Richard Hill

==Management==
England coach Clive Woodward was first linked with the Lions&#x27; head-coaching job in December 2003, shortly after England&#x27;s victory in the 2003 Rugby World Cup, when he was approached by Four Home Unions chairman Bill Beaumont. Woodward resigned as England coach on 3 September 2004, and appointed as Lions coach four days later following a meeting of the Lions committee. He named a 25-strong coaching group in October 2004, including his successor as England coach, Andy Robinson, and three-time Lions head coach Ian McGeechan. Some of the coaches on the tour would be responsible for the team playing on weekends, including Robinson, Eddie O&#x27;Sullivan and Phil Larder, while others would take charge of the midweek team, including McGeechan, Gareth Jenkins and Mike Ford. Former government communications consultant Alastair Campbell was added to the tour party in December 2004. The Welsh Rugby Union (WRU) initially requested that national team head coach Mike Ruddock be left out of the Lions coaching team to focus on the Wales job; however, in April 2005, Ruddock said he would be open to a position with the Lions if it had a &quot;specific job description&quot;. Ruddock was offered an &quot;observational role&quot; on the tour, but ultimately rejected it in favour of joining the Wales under-21s at the 2005 Under 21 Rugby World Championship, and the Lions role was given to his assistant Scott Johnson.

==Matches==
The Lions&#x27; tour schedule was announced in February 2004, and included 10 matches: three tests and seven tour matches. The tour was scheduled to begin with a match against Bay of Plenty on 4 June 2005, with the test series beginning three weeks later. The tour did not originally include a match against National Provincial Championship winners Auckland, but in September 2004 a match was added between the second and third tests. Another fixture against Argentina was added two weeks later, to be played at the Millennium Stadium in Cardiff on 23 May 2005.

===Argentina===
The Lions played Argentina in a warm-up test match at the Millennium Stadium in Cardiff on 23 May. The Pumas were without 25 players who may have made their first-choice team due to club commitments and the Lions rested many of their top players to field a second-string line-up. Tour captain Brian O&#x27;Driscoll was rested, so Wales vice-captain Michael Owen took his place.

The Lions looked disjointed, turning the ball over 15 times in open play. Their pack was outplayed; the Pumas shoved them off their own scrum three times. The Lions also conceded five penalties for holding on to the ball while grounded, usually because their support failed to arrive in time. In the meantime, the Pumas played a match that was almost universally called &quot;inspired&quot; by rugby media worldwide. The Pumas led 19–16 at half-time, and could easily have been ahead by more. The main plus for the Lions was the performance of Jonny Wilkinson, making his first appearance against international opposition since the 2003 Rugby World Cup Final; Wilkinson set up the Lions&#x27; first try, converted it and kicked six penalties. His last penalty saved the Lions from defeat, salvaging a 25–25 draw in the eighth minute of stoppage time. The match was granted full test status by the IRB in 2006.

===Bay of Plenty Steamers===
The first tour match was against the Bay of Plenty Steamers on 4 June in Rotorua. The Lions started the match strongly, with Josh Lewsey scoring a try after two minutes and then a second four minutes later. The Lions were up 17–0 after 11 minutes, but the Steamers recovered for a 17–17 half-time score. The Lions controlled the second half and won 34–20. A significant injury was the fractured ankle suffered by experienced back-rower Lawrence Dallaglio, who had to withdraw from the tour.

===Taranaki===
Taranaki hosted the Lions at New Plymouth on 8 June. The first half was closely fought in more ways than one, as the Lions&#x27; Danny Grewcock and Taranaki&#x27;s Paul Tito came to blows. The Amber-and-Blacks had a 7–6 lead at half-time, but soon after the break Martin Corry scored a try for the Lions. Shortly afterwards, Taranaki&#x27;s Andrew Hore was sin-binned for holding the ball, and the Lions took control. Consensus man of the match Charlie Hodgson kicked two penalties during Hore&#x27;s absence, and the Lions kept their momentum even after Hore returned. Shane Horgan added a try and Geordan Murphy two as the Lions won 36–14.

===New Zealand Maori===

The match against the New Zealand Maori at Hamilton on 11 June promised to be the most competitive test lead-up, being billed by rugby media as virtually a fourth test. In the first half, the Maori had the better of possession and tackling, but the Lions had the better of the set-pieces, and the half ended 6–6.

Just before the break, Lions prop Andrew Sheridan was sin-binned for punching Maori fly-half Luke McAlister. When the sin-bin period ended, Sheridan was replaced by Gethin Jenkins. A McAlister penalty shortly afterwards, a Leon MacDonald try (converted by McAlister) and then a second McAlister penalty gave the Maori a 19–6 lead. The last 15 minutes were the Lions&#x27; best period, rewarded by a Brian O&#x27;Driscoll try, which was converted by Stephen Jones. The Lions threatened strongly, but the Maori, inspired by their replacement fly-half Carlos Spencer and stalwart captain Jono Gibbes held on for a 19–13 win – their first ever over the Lions.


===Wellington Lions===
After the loss to the Maori, the Lions went to Wellington to take on the city&#x27;s NPC side, the Wellington Lions, on 15 June. The British &amp; Irish Lions team was selected primarily from players in contention for the test team, including Jonny Wilkinson in his first tour match.

The British &amp; Irish Lions had most of the possession and scoring chances, but committed numerous unforced errors when points looked likely. Tries came from Gethin Jenkins and Gareth Thomas, both converted by Wilkinson, who also scored three penalties. The British &amp; Irish Lions&#x27; 23–6 win, while seemingly showing their tour was back on track, left almost as many questions as answers. In post-match comments, O&#x27;Driscoll said, &quot;The ball was like a bar of soap out there and both sides made a lot of unforced errors.&quot; Wellington Lions coach John Plumtree remarked, &quot;The All Blacks would have put 50 or 60 points on us.&quot;

===Otago===
In their first appearance in the South Island, the Lions played Otago on 18 June at Carisbrook in Dunedin. The stadium is known to visiting teams as the &quot;House of Pain&quot;, particularly for the Lions, who had lost games to the Otago side on four previous tours.

Otago began strongly and the Lions were penalised four times in the first 11 minutes, Otago converting two. The Lions&#x27; stronger scrum play brought them back into the game, and the first half was closely fought, ending 13–13. The Lions clearly had the momentum, as Will Greenwood scored a try, converted by Charlie Hodgson, just before the break.

Otago took a 16–13 lead shortly after half-time, but strong Lions scrum play led to a try from man of the match Ryan Jones, who put himself in contention for a test position. The try and Hodgson&#x27;s conversion gave the Lions a solid, though far from insurmountable, lead. Otago rallied to 20–19 with a penalty, but the Lions pulled away soon afterwards. A Hodgson penalty and a try from Shane Williams converted by Hodgson took the final margin to 30–19.

===Southland Stags===
The Southland match at Invercargill on 21 June was the last before the first test. Lions coach Clive Woodward announced that no players in the night&#x27;s line-up would play in the test.

In the first 15 minutes, the Lions looked formidable as they took an early 10–0 lead over the Stags, keyed by a Gavin Henson try. However, they became disjointed and by half-time had turned over the ball 14 times and were considered lucky to be ahead 10–3 at the break.

The first few minutes of the second half were even worse for the Lions, as Hale T-Pole scored a converted try. Woodward immediately substituted four players to settle down his team. T-Pole made an interception to save a Mark Cueto try, but the Lions kept the pressure on, and Henson scored his second try. The Lions then changed tactics, choosing to kick for territory more often, and were never truly threatened again, winning by 26–16.

===First test===
Less than two minutes into the first test, the Lions lost their captain Brian O&#x27;Driscoll to injury after a joint tackle by New Zealand captain Tana Umaga and hooker Keven Mealamu. At a ruck, they attempted to clear O&#x27;Driscoll by each lifting one of his legs before driving him into the ground. O&#x27;Driscoll twisted his body as he came down to avoid landing on his head, but that meant most of the force went through his shoulder, which was dislocated, ending his tour. Opinions differed on the incident; the Lions staff and many British and Irish commentators believed that it was an illegal spear tackle, and Lions coach Woodward reported the pair to the IRB&#x27;s citing commissioner, William Venter. Venter decided, based on the video footage available, not to refer the matter to a disciplinary tribunal. New Zealand commentators largely took the view that the two All Blacks were just clearing out the ruck and had no intention to injure O&#x27;Driscoll. Referee Joël Jutge admitted in 2017 that he should have shown at least one red card to Umaga and Mealamu for the tackle.

Eight minutes into the game, Dan Carter opened the scoring for the All Blacks with a penalty. Three minutes later, the Lions suffered a further blow when Paul O&#x27;Connell was sin-binned for a professional foul, and Carter kicked the penalty. Already a player short, the Lions then lost Richard Hill to injury. Ali Williams scored the first New Zealand try shortly after O&#x27;Connell returned, and the half ended with the Lions down 11–0.

Carter kicked a penalty in the second half, followed by a converted try from Sitiveni Sivivatu to end the All Blacks&#x27; scoring, and Jonny Wilkinson kicked a penalty in the 56th minute to provide the Lions with their only points of the night. The 21–3 win was considered by almost every commentator to be even more one-sided than the score indicated. The Lions&#x27; sloppy set-piece play included ten losses of their own line-outs.

It was announced after the match that, in addition to O&#x27;Driscoll, two more injured Lions were out for the rest of the tour – Hill from the incident during the match, and Tom Shanklin for inflammation from an existing knee injury. Danny Grewcock was also suspended for two months after he was cited for biting All Blacks hooker Keven Mealamu.

===Manawatu Turbos===
The Lions scored their first convincing tour victory in this game at Palmerston North against NPC second division side Manawatu Turbos, winning 109–6. They led 38–6 at half time and scored 71 unanswered points in the second. Welshman Shane Williams scored five tries to help the Lions post their all-time record score in New Zealand, surpassing their 64–5 victory over Marlborough/Nelson 46 years earlier. In addition to Williams&#x27; five, the Lions&#x27; tries were scored by Ronan O&#x27;Gara (2), Mark Cueto (2), Geordan Murphy, Charlie Hodgson, Jason Robinson, Martin Corry, Neil Back, Gareth Cooper, Gordon D&#x27;Arcy and Ollie Smith, with Manawatu restricted to two Jonathan Hargreaves penalties. Lock Donncha O&#x27;Callaghan and flanker Martyn Williams were substituted at half-time but had impressed enough to secure test selection for the following Saturday. Murphy also impressed at full-back, but it was Shane Williams, with elusive running and awareness, who most thrilled Lions supporters.

===Second test===
From the high point against Manawatu, the Lions fell to a low in the second test at Wellington Regional Stadium in Wellington on 2 July, losing 48–18 and conceding the highest number of points against a New Zealand team in a test. Woodward selected a radically different test squad from the one that had been embarrassed in Christchurch a week earlier, replacing eleven players. Key to the Lions&#x27; hopes of staying in the series was Woodward&#x27;s decision to add several of the Welsh team that won the Grand Slam in the 2005 Six Nations.

The Lions started strongly, with captain Gareth Thomas scoring a try under the posts and Jonny Wilkinson converting two minutes in. A minute later, Wilkinson hit the post with a penalty attempt, but gathering the rebound the Lions were in a good attacking position when Paul O&#x27;Connell was penalised for diving over a ruck. The All Blacks settled down and then scored through two Dan Carter penalties before he set up their first try, racing 50 metres off a turnover before offloading to captain Tana Umaga to score near the posts. Although the rest of the half remained close, the All Blacks went into the break with a 21–13 lead. The second half turned into a showcase for New Zealand in general and Carter in particular. He scored two tries, converted three, kicked two penalties, and constantly kept the Lions on the back foot with his distribution. Flanker Richie McCaw powered his way over for a try after Carter missed a hat trick by a matter of inches. Rugby media were in virtually unanimous agreement that the Lions were greatly improved and that the All Blacks were dominant. Carter&#x27;s tally of 33 points broke the all-time record for points by an All Black against the Lions.

===Auckland===

Having lost the test series on the previous Saturday, the midweek Lions came to Eden Park with something to prove. The match was marked by the Lions&#x27; inability to find touch and Auckland&#x27;s willingness to attack. Auckland gave up some guaranteed points from early penalties to take the Lions on in set piece play. Auckland tighthead prop John Afoa was denied a try after a tap and run saw him held up in goal. A series of handling errors throughout the first half let Auckland down and saw the Lions to a 14–3 lead at the half. The second half saw the Lions give away points to a stoic Auckland pack and the scoreline was narrowed to 14–13 Lions lead. A late Ronan O&#x27;Gara penalty saw the Lions extend to a four-point winning margin of 17–13. This victory completed a clean sweep of matches for the midweek Lions against host unions throughout New Zealand.


===Third test===
Following two early penalties by Stephen Jones, the Lions led 6–0 and things looked promising for them. All Black captain Tana Umaga was sin-binned for killing the ball, but even without their captain, the All Blacks managed to score two tries, by Conrad Smith and Ali Williams, both converted by Luke McAlister. The Lions were awarded two more penalties, which Stephen Jones kicked, but just before the break, Umaga scored a try to give the All Blacks a half-time lead of 24–12.

Seven minutes into the second half Umaga scored another try. Soon after, scrum-half Byron Kelleher was replaced by Justin Marshall, who then played his final half-hour of All Black rugby. Another All Black try was thwarted when Jerry Collins was sin-binned for a late tackle. The All Blacks then spent several minutes defending as the Lions pushed towards the line from within ten meters, and after a long struggle Lewis Moody managed to score, making it 31–19. Both sides made errors that cost them tries. Sitiveni Sivivatu had two very close calls but it was Rico Gear who followed his own deep kick to toe the ball over the line and score a fine individual try. McAlister converted, giving him a 100 percent kicking rate, to make the full-time score 38–19.

==Lions anthem==
Sir Clive Woodward commissioned an anthem, &quot;The Power of Four&quot;, specially for the 2005 tour. Neil Myers composed the tune, and the piece was performed for the first time in public by Welsh opera singer Katherine Jenkins before the Lions&#x27; match against Argentina at the Millennium Stadium in 2005. It was played before all games on the tour, but was not used in the Lions tour to South Africa in 2009.

<doc id="779544" wikidata="Q60680" url="?curid=779544" title="Alfred von Waldersee">
<text>Alfred Ludwig Heinrich Karl Graf von Waldersee (8 April 18325 March 1904) was a German field marshal (&quot;Generalfeldmarschall&quot;) who became Chief of the Imperial German General Staff.

Born into a military family, von Waldersee saw decorated service as an artillery officer, and became Prussian military attaché at the Paris embassy in 1870. This gave him insight into the French defences that would prove crucial in the upcoming Franco-Prussian War, in which he played a significant role. Later, as principal assistant to Field-Marshal Helmuth von Moltke the Elder, Chief of the Imperial General Staff, von Waldersee gained influence with the future Kaiser Wilhelm II, who promoted him Chief of Staff on his accession.

When the Peking legation compound was besieged by the Boxer insurgents in 1900, von Waldersee was appointed as head of an eight-nation relief force. Although he arrived too late to take part in the fighting, he conducted punitive expeditions, which succeeded in pacifying the Boxers, and took a Chinese mistress, Sai Jinhua. 

==Family==
Alfred von Waldersee was the fifth of six children of the Prussian cavalry general Franz Heinrich von Waldersee (1791–1873) and Bertha von Hünerbein (1799–1859). Franz Heinrich von Waldersee was the son of Franz Anton von Waldersee (1763–1823), an illegitimate son of Leopold III Friedrich Franz, Duke of Anhalt-Dessau (1740–1817) and of Johanne Eleonore Hoffmeier (1739–1816). Nevertheless, Franz Anton was raised and educated at the ducal court and in 1786 was created a &quot;Graf&quot;, or Count.

The Waldersee family estate, Waterneverstorf, is located on the Baltic coast near Behrensdorf in the German federal state of Schleswig-Holstein.

==Early years and beyond==
Waldersee was born at Potsdam into a military and aristocratic family. After attending several cadet schools, in 1850 he was commissioned as a &quot;Leutnant&quot; into the Artillery Corps of the Prussian army and he soon attracted the favorable notice of his superiors. In his first major campaign, the Austro-Prussian War of 1866, he served as &quot;aide-de-camp&quot; to General of Artillery Prince Friedrich Karl of Prussia, with whom he was present at Königgrätz. In the course of this campaign, Count Waldersee was promoted to major and assigned to the Prussian General Staff. Thereafter, he served on the staff of X Army Corps, a new formation in the conquered kingdom of Hanover. In January 1870, he became military attaché at the Paris embassy of Prussia. At this post he was able to gather intelligence on troop strengths and other information on the French military that proved valuable in the campaigns to come.

In the Franco-Prussian War, Lieutenant Colonel Count Waldersee, recognized for his military prowess and recent analysis of the adversary&#x27;s armed forces, proved a most useful assistant to the &quot;supreme War-Lord.&quot; He was present at the great battles around Metz, assigned to the staff of General Grand Duke of Mecklenburg-Schwerin; and later in operations against Chanzy&#x27;s army on the Loire. The grand duke was a soldier, but not a tactician of note, and the successful outcome of the western campaign was largely due to his adviser, Waldersee.

At the end of the war, Waldersee received the Iron Cross, First Class, and was entrusted with the difficult post of German representative at Paris, in which his tact and courtesy were marked. At the end of 1871, Waldersee took command of the 13th Uhlan Regiment at Hanover, and two years later became chief of staff of the Hanoverian Army corps, in which he had served before 1870.

On 14 April 1874, he married Mary Esther Lee (1837–1914), third daughter of the wealthy New York City merchant David Lee and widow of Prince Frederick of Schleswig-Holstein. Mary had previously been created Princess of Nöer by the Emperor of Austria and her elder sister, Josephine, was the wife of Baron August von Wächter, the Württembergian Minister of Foreign Affairs. Mary became an advocate for the poor in Prussia and was honored for her compassion.

==The Great General Staff==
In 1882, Waldersee was chosen by Field Marshal Helmuth von Moltke the Elder as his principal assistant on the General Staff at Berlin with the rank of &quot;Generalquartiermeister&quot;. With this appointment, Waldersee was already seen as the likely successor of the octogenarian field marshal. On several occasions Waldersee accompanied Prince Wilhelm, the future Kaiser Wilhelm II, on trips abroad to represent the prince&#x27;s grandfather, Kaiser Wilhelm I. Out of these trips grew a tenuous teacher-student relationship, but Waldersee was seen by Wilhelm&#x27;s liberal parents Crown Prince Friedrich Wilhelm and Victoria, Princess Royal as &quot;anti-Semitic, narrowly zealous in religion, and reactionary... the quartermaster general was the personification of everything Wilhelm&#x27;s parents most detested.&quot; The British historian John C. G. Röhl wrote that Waldersee &quot;...seems to have suffered from some form of paranoid megalomania&quot; as Waldersee believed in a vast Jewish world conspiracy in which the &quot;entirety&quot; of Jews around the world were working for the destruction of the &quot;Reich&quot;.

Chancellor Bismarck had been in power in Prussia and Germany for a generation, but by the mid-1880s the socio-political mood in Germany was changing. Socialists were gaining seats in the &quot;Reichstag&quot;, and the liberal middle-class had a friend in the crown prince. Bismarck, seeking to retain his own power, now looked to an alignment with the army, but he was weary and suspicious of Waldersee. Effectively already chief-of-staff in all but name, the count was &quot;able but extravagantly ambitious, restlessly intriguing, [and he] more or less openly aspired to the chancellorship [himself].&quot; In 1885, Waldersee wrote in his diary: &quot;We have far too many enemies, the French, the Slavs, &quot;above all the Catholics&quot; [emphasis in the original], and then the entire little rabble of the dispossessed, with their supporters&quot;. In 1886, Waldersee wrote in his diary: &quot;Everywhere the masses are on the move, everywhere there is rebellion against authority, the negation of all religion, the generation of hatred and envy against those with wealth. We are probably facing major catastrophes&quot;. In another diary entry, Waldersee wrote &quot;The ghost of socialism is beginning to show a very earnest face&quot; while he called the &quot;Zentrum&quot; a gang of &quot;hypocritical blackguards without a Fatherland, intent on the collapse of Germany and the destruction of Prussia&quot;. Waldersee&#x27;s view of the international situation was equally bleak with democracy established in France, Italy and Britain and autocracy faced with challenges in Russia, Austria-Hungary and the Ottoman empire. For Waldersee, only if the &quot;Reich&quot; held firm, which provided the foundation for the &quot;mainstay for the whole of Europe, but if we become weak, the entire old world will fall apart&quot;. Waldersee believed that he would one day lead the forces of the &quot;Reich&quot; against all he hated in some apocalyptic war. Before the war could be launched, Waldersee argued that the &quot;inner enemy&quot; which consisted of the Progressive Party, the entire German Jewish community and the liberal Crown Prince Frederich and his British wife, the Crown Princess Victoria would have to be disposed of first. Waldersee dreaded the prospect that the Crown Prince Frederich would ascend to the throne as Waldersee believed that with Frederich as Emperor, Germany would become a democracy, the &quot;Junkers&quot; and the rest of the nobility would lose their privileged position and the Army would lose its &quot;state within the state&quot; status by bringing the military under civilian control. To stop all this from happening, Waldersee plotted to have the military stage a coup d&#x27;état to depose Frederich in favor of his son Prince Wilhelm if he should ascend to the throne; have Victoria expelled back to Britain; end universal manhood suffrage for the &quot;Reichstag&quot; and have Germany launch a war to &quot;take out&quot; France, Austria and Russia (the fact that Germany was allied to the last two did not matter to Waldersee). In a letter to Prince Wilhelm (the future Wilhelm II) in 1887, Waldersee wrote:

All the Progressive people with their supporters, the entire &quot;Judenschaft&quot; and most foreign countries, that is to say, taken together are formidable foes...In view of the colossal influence which the Jews wiled by virtue of their wealth, through which they have secured the services of Christians in influential positions, even though they themselves are few in number, they are by far the most dangerous of our enemies. 

Shortly afterwards, Prince Wilhelm addressed a meeting of the anti-Semitic Christian Social Party headed by the Lutheran pastor Adolf Stoecker whom the prince praised as a &quot;second Luther&quot;. In the international outcry that followed Wilhelm&#x27;s address to Stoecker&#x27;s party, Waldersee wrote in a letter to Wilhelm &quot;the entire row in the press comes from the Jews&quot; whose &quot;attacks are aimed less at Stoecker than at the Prince&quot;. In his diary, Waldersee wrote &quot;Too many people are under the influence of the Jews&quot; whom he wrote were afraid of Wilhelm as were &quot;all our enemies-the French, the Russians, the Progressives and the Social Democrats&quot;.

The General Staff knew of few of Bismarck&#x27;s schemes, and Waldersee&#x27;s outlook was on occasions at odds with foreign policy positions held by the chancellor. Waldersee, officially still second under Moltke, had been elevating the military attachés at the Imperial embassies into &quot;a virtually independent diplomatic service&quot;, often managing to bypass the Foreign Ministry. After one such breach of protocol was detected at the Vienna embassy, Waldersee was subsequently &quot;hauled over the coals&quot; by Bismarck in person, to demonstrate to the military establishment who was in charge of foreign affairs. In 1888, the Emperor Wilhelm I died and Frederich become Emperor Frederich III, but as the new emperor was already dying of throat cancer, Waldersee cancelled his plans for a &quot;putsch&quot;, guessing correctly that Frederich would be dead soon enough and his friend, Wilhelm who was now Crown Prince, would soon be the Emperor. Field Marshal Moltke finally retired in August 1888, and Waldersee&#x27;s appointment to succeed him was a foregone conclusion: the newly crowned 29-year-old Kaiser Wilhelm II gave his consent.

Waldersee essentially followed the Moltke line until he ran headlong into the often unpredictable young emperor. In 1890, at the autumn maneuvers &quot;[Kaisermanöver]&quot; of the Imperial Army, Waldersee had the effrontery to soundly &quot;defeat&quot; the formations under control of the impetuous Wilhelm II. Waldersee thus lost the confidence of his sovereign and was relieved of his duties and reassigned to command IX Army Corps at Hamburg-Altona, a clear demotion but still an assignment of importance. Waldersee, despite all that had happened, would establish his Hamburg residence near the Bismarck retirement estate at Friedrichsruh. In 1898, he was appointed inspector-general of the Third Army at Hanover, the transfer orders being accompanied by eulogistic expressions of Wilhelm II&#x27;s goodwill.

==Expedition to China==

Two thousand European and Chinese Christians were trapped in the legation compound at Peking by Boxer insurgents in 1900. An eight-nation International Relief Force of European, American and Japanese troops maneuvered to the rescue. As Kaiser Wilhelm II’s minister to China, Baron Clemens von Ketteler, had been murdered by the Boxers, the Germans &quot;claimed a certain priority in the crusade against Chinese barbarism.&quot; Wilhelm II wanted Waldersee to command the expedition to China, which he announced to the world press had come as a result of the initiative of the Emperor Nicholas II of Russia. In fact, Wilhelm had a sent a telegram to his cousin Nicholas asking if he would object if Russian troops were to come under the command of a German general, to which Nicholas replied he had no objection, which Wilhelm then misrepresented at the press conference he called in Berlin as Nicholas having asked for Waldersee to command the expedition. The announcement which went had been made without consulting the other powers caused a great deal of stress for the &quot;Auswärtiges Amt&quot; who now had to convince the other powers to accept Waldersee&#x27;s appointment, which was only done by threatening that Wilhelm would feel humiliated if Waldersee&#x27;s command were in fact rejected by the other powers and this would strain relations with Germany, a form of blackmail that proved effective, through it damaged Germany&#x27;s diplomatic standing. On 7 August 1900, Waldersee received a telegram from Wilhelm II telling him that he was now in command of the expedition. The now semi-retired, sixty-eight-year-old, but for the occasion the newly promoted Field Marshal Alfred Count von Waldersee was officially proposed by the Tsar of Russia, and seconded by the Japanese, as the first Allied Supreme Commander of modern times.Preparations for the field marshal&#x27;s departure from Germany to China caused a good deal of satirical comment on what became known as &quot;Waldersee Rummel&quot; or &quot;Waldersee theatricals&quot;, which he detested. Much of this circus, he wrote in his irritation &quot;... unfortunately made it into the newspapers.&quot; Waldersee arrived at the front lines of Peking too late to direct his multinational force in any fighting of note, but was in charge of the pacification of the Boxers. Waldersee who had dreams of winning a glorious military victory in China was greatly disappointed that the main fighting was over after he arrived in Beijing on 17 October 1900, where he installed himself in the bedroom of the Dowager Empress in the Forbidden City. In his own words, Waldersee went to work with &quot;feverish activity&quot; by ordering 75 punitive expeditions in the countryside around Beijing, in which thousands of people, mostly women and children were slain. &quot;These punitive expeditions ... were unrewarding enterprises [and] from Waldersee&#x27;s point of view ... hardly constituted war.&quot; It is probable, however, that &quot;if his appointment had not existed, or if it had been filled by a less positive personality, the animosities which ceaselessly embittered the [international] contingents in North China would have assumed serious proportions. ... [In addition] there were countless minor incidents, and it is at least partly to Waldersee&#x27;s credit that nothing came of them.&quot;A prostitute named Sai Jinhua, whom he had met in Europe, renewed her ‘acquaintanceship’ with Waldersee. Ying Hu wrote that &quot;Legend has it that in their &quot;dragon bed&quot; of the Empress Dowager, which Sai and Waldersee shared, she tried and sometimes succeeded in curbing the brutality of the troops.&quot; Wenxian Zhang wrote that Sai Jinhua &quot;was credited with influencing Waldsee to moderate the harsh treatment of Beijing residents.&quot; Sai Jinhua, in her biography, admitted that she was on good terms with Waldersee but, as stated by Hu Ying, she &quot;vigorously&quot; disputed that she had a sexual relationship with him.

Count Waldersee understood that the conduct of the conquerors was unbecoming: their soldiery was idle and bored, venereal disease was rampant, and after looting was curtailed, the rank-and-file remained gullible enough to be swindled with &quot;Chinese art&quot; of all descriptions. At the end of the campaign he hastened his return to Germany. In 1901, for his &quot;accomplishments in the interest of world peace,&quot; he was named an honorary citizen of Hamburg, his erstwhile home. Again at Hanover, he resumed the duties of inspector-general, which he performed almost until his death in 1904 at age 71. He died on 5 March at 8 o&#x27;clock in the evening.

<text>Federico Marcos del Rosario Errázuriz Zañartu (; April 25, 1825 – July 20, 1877) was a Chilean political figure. He served as the president of Chile between 1871 and 1876.

==Biography==
He was born on 25 April 1825 Santiago to Francisco Javier Errázuriz Aldunate and Josefa Zañartu Manso de Velasco. He was of Basque descent. He studied law in the University of Chile.

He was made a deputy in parliament at an early age, and took some part in the parliamentary debates. In 1860 he was made chief of the province of Santiago, and introduced many reforms. In 1862, during Pérez&#x27;s administration, he became secretary of justice and of public instruction; and in 1865, during the Chincha Islands War with Spain, he was secretary of war and the navy.

In 1871 Errázuriz became president of the republic of Chile, and introduced liberal reforms of great importance to the country, tending toward the secularization of public instruction and freedom of worship. He amended the constitution of 1833 by means of a law which was very much discussed in congress, abolished ecclesiastical privileges, and built several railways in the northern and southern parts of the country. He also organized several exhibitions of industry and art, the most important being the Exposición Universal of 1875, held in a magnificent palace built in the Quinta Normal de Agricultura expressly for that purpose. Errázuriz improved the navy by adding to it the two steel men-of-war “Cochrane” and “Blanco Encalada.” He also improved the condition of the army, and contributed greatly to the material progress and welfare of his country.

He died in Santiago soon after retiring from office.

<doc id="779560" wikidata="Q26115" url="?curid=779560" title="Love Metal">
<text>Love Metal is the fourth studio album by Finnish gothic rock band HIM. Released on 11 April 2003, HIM began recording demos for the album in northern spring 2002, after an exhausting touring cycle for their previous album, which nearly broke the band up. Excited and invigorated by the new material, HIM entered Finnvox Studios in September 2002 with producer Hiili Hiilesmaa, who had previously helmed the group&#x27;s 1997 debut album. Musically &quot;Love Metal&quot; featured a more raw and organic sound, inspired by the band&#x27;s early influences, which was also seen as a reaction to the difficulties they faced while recording their previous album. Vocalist Ville Valo has since described &quot;Love Metal&quot; as the album where HIM found their sound. &quot;Love Metal&quot; was also the band&#x27;s first album to predominantly feature their logo, the Heartagram, on the cover, while the album&#x27;s title was coined in the mid-nineties as a description for HIM&#x27;s musical genre.

&quot;Love Metal&quot; received positive reviews from critics, with many praising the songwriting and calling the album a return to form after &quot;Deep Shadows and Brilliant Highlights&quot;. The album charted in eleven countries, reaching number one in Finland and Germany, later going platinum and gold respectively. &quot;Love Metal&quot; was also the band&#x27;s first album to chart in the UK and France at number 55 and 141 respectively. Three singles were released, with &quot;The Funeral of Hearts&quot; reaching number one on the Finnish Singles Chart. Music videos were produced for all three singles, with professional skateboarder and &quot;Jackass&quot; member Bam Margera directing two. Following the album&#x27;s release, HIM toured the US for the first time, with all of the shows being sold out.

==Production==
After nearly breaking up following an exhausting supporting tour for their previous album &quot;Deep Shadows and Brilliant Highlights&quot;, HIM took a two-month break in early 2002. While other members of the band flew on vacation, vocalist Ville Valo stayed behind in Helsinki and began writing new material. When HIM regrouped at the turn of February and March 2002, the band felt re-energized, as well as excited about the new songs Valo had written. The group soon began recording demos in the spring of 2002, with producer Hiili Hiilesmaa, who had previously produced the band&#x27;s 1997 debut album. HIM continued to work on new material for approximately six months, before entering Finnvox Studios in September 2002 to record their fourth studio album with Hiilesmaa acting as producer. The recording process lasted two months, after which the band flew to Los Angeles for two weeks to mix the album at Studio Scream with Tim Palmer, who had previously worked with Pearl Jam and U2 among others. Additional mixing for the tracks &quot;Buried Alive by Love&quot; and &quot;Sweet Pandemonium&quot; was done at Sphere Studios in London, while the album was mastered at Sterling Sound in New York by George Marino.

The artwork for &quot;Love Metal&quot; was designed by Valo and Janne Uotila, and marks the first predominant use of the band&#x27;s logo the heartagram, which was originally designed by Valo on his twentieth birthday in 1996. According to Valo, the inclusion of the heartagram on the cover was done as &quot;a statement of intent [...] musically, visually and ideologically&quot;, as well as to &quot;get the symbol across&quot;. The term &quot;love metal&quot; was coined by the band in the late-nineties as way to respond to peoples&#x27; difficulty categorizing HIM&#x27;s music, and was chosen as the title of the album in order to explain to people what the term means, with Valo stating: &quot;When somebody asks &#x27;what is love metal&#x27;, we can give him or her the album&quot;.

==Music and lyrics==

The overall sound of &quot;Love Metal&quot; was described by Ville Valo as being more &quot;organic&quot; and &quot;dynamic&quot; than some of the band&#x27;s previous work, whilst at the same time containing elements from all their albums in one. He also described &quot;Love Metal&quot; as a &quot;hats off&quot; to the band&#x27;s influences, such as Black Sabbath, Led Zeppelin, and Iggy Pop, as well as a reaction to the difficulties they faced during the making-of &quot;Deep Shadows and Brilliant Highlights&quot;. He elaborated, stating: &quot;After what we considered a disappointment with &quot;Deep Shadows and Brilliant Highlights&quot;, because there were so many chefs in the kitchen, we wanted to be a band [...] that we control what we do, and everybody else can fuck-off.&quot; Valo referred to &quot;Love Metal&quot; as a &quot;moment of realization&quot; for the band, stating: &quot;This is what we are, and this is what we&#x27;re going to do&quot;. He also described the album as the point where the group found &quot;the identity of the band&quot;.

&quot;Buried Alive by Love&quot; was one of the first songs composed for the album, and opens with a riff inspired by &quot;Search and Destroy&quot; by The Stooges, which Valo had written while on tour for &quot;Razorblade Romance&quot;. According to Valo, the song was deliberately chosen as the first track of the album to display &quot;that youthful, animalistic energy&quot; that had been &quot;lacking&quot; in some of the band&#x27;s previous work. &quot;The Funeral of Hearts&quot; wasn&#x27;t originally considered for the album, as it was unfinished when recording began. The song was added at the last minute after bassist Mikko &quot;Mige&quot; Paananen heard the chorus, demanding it be included on the album. Lyrically &quot;The Funeral of Hearts&quot; talks about &quot;being able to celebrate what you have, even though things might end.&quot; Valo described the song as &quot;the most accessible, straight on HIM-tune&quot; on &quot;Love Metal&quot;. &quot;Beyond Redemption&quot; was inspired by a relationship of a friend of Valo&#x27;s, and lyrically deals with &quot;people who fall in love, and then they are beyond redemption; there&#x27;s no turning back&quot;. &quot;Sweet Pandemonium&quot; talks about &quot;understanding you&#x27;ve got a problem&quot; and the difficulty to &quot;talk about it&quot;, while &quot;Circle of Fear&quot; deals with the inability to help other people &quot;without loving yourself first&quot;. &quot;The Path&quot; was inspired by the legend of Orpheus, and was included in the end credits of the Finnish film &quot;Honey Baby&quot;, as was &quot;The Sacrament&quot; in the 2007 anime film &quot;&quot;.

==Release and promotion==

&quot;The Funeral of Hearts&quot; was released in March 2003 as the first single from &quot;Love Metal&quot;, charting in five countries, including at number one in Finland and number two in Germany. The song also gave the band their first UK chart position at number fifteen. A music video by Stefan Lindfors was also filmed in Lapland, which later won &quot;Best Video&quot; at the 2004 Kerrang! Awards. &quot;The Funeral of Hearts&quot; was also nominated for &quot;Best Single&quot; that year. &quot;Love Metal&quot; was released on 11 April 2003 in Finland and on 14 April internationally, and charted in eleven countries, peaking at number one in Finland and Germany, number four in Switzerland, and at number five in Austria. The album also reached number 55 on the UK Albums Chart, and later charted at number 117 in the US in 2005. &quot;Love Metal&quot; was eventually certified platinum in Finland and gold in Germany. The album was also nominated for &quot;Best Album&quot; at the 2003 Kerrang! Awards, as well as &quot;Hard Rock/Metal Album of the Year&quot; at the 2003 Emma Awards, while HIM were nominated for &quot;Band of the Year&quot;.

&quot;Buried Alive by Love&quot; and &quot;The Sacrament&quot; were released as singles in May and June 2003 respectively, with both hitting the UK charts, and the latter also peaking at number four in Finland. Both received music videos, which were directed by professional skateboarder and &quot;Jackass&quot; member Bam Margera. The band had first met Margera in 2000, after a show in London, and played their first concert in the United States the following year at a party organized by Margera. &quot;Buried Alive by Love&quot; was shot in Los Angeles, with a guest appearance by actress Juliette Lewis, while &quot;The Sacrament&quot; was filmed in Prague. In May 2003, HIM performed a sold-out show at the London Astoria, before starting the album&#x27;s supporting tour in October 2003 in Finland. HIM were also scheduled to support Ozzy Osbourne in the fall of 2003 on a European tour, but were forced to drop-out, after the tour was postponed due to Osbourne injuring his leg. Following the release of the compilation album &quot;And Love Said No: The Greatest Hits 1997–2004&quot;, HIM announced in August 2003, that they had parted ways with their record company BMG, having fulfilled their contractual obligations to the label. Around the same time the band also announced plans to release a new live album, tentatively titled &quot;Live Metal&quot;, in November 2003, but the record was ultimately scrapped, in favor of starting work on new material. HIM continued touring on 17 January 2004 in Italy, which was followed by a seven-date UK leg, which was entirely sold-out. From 15 April to 19 May 2004, HIM embarked on their first tour of the US, which was also entirely sold-out. HIM also received a nomination for &quot;Best Band on the Planet&quot; at the 2004 Kerrang! Awards.

==Reception==
&quot;Love Metal&quot; received positive reviews from critics. Mape Ollila of Imperiumi.net commended the consistent quality of the material, as well as the &quot;hook-laden&quot; songwriting. He concluded his review, stating: &quot;There are a lot of goth pop bands in Finland doing the same thing, but &quot;Love Metal&quot; once again proves that HIM is one step ahead of everybody else.&quot; Thomas Kupfer of &quot;Rock Hard&quot; also commended the album&#x27;s consistent songwriting. He also touted &quot;Love Metal&quot; as a return to form after &quot;Deep Shadows and Brilliant Highlights&quot;, calling it a &quot;liberation&quot; after the band&#x27;s previous hardships. Lance Teegarden of &quot;PopMatters&quot; praised its &quot;swooning pop hooks, a heavy yet harmonic sound, laments about love, death, and forgiveness, and an assured sense of songcraft&quot;. He did however criticize the songwriting as formulaic, but concluded his review by stating: &quot;no one is doing the whole gothic rock thing as convincingly as HIM are right now.&quot;

Ilkka Mattila of &quot;Helsingin Sanomat&quot; was positive in his review of &quot;Love Metal&quot;, describing the band as sounding &quot;liberated&quot; and more rock following &quot;Deep Shadows and Brilliant Highlights&quot;. &quot;Rumba&quot;″s Samuli Knuuti described &quot;Love Metal&quot; as a return to the roots of the band and sounding like &quot;what HIM should sound like&quot;, despite perceiving a lack of variety. Rob Theakston of AllMusic praised the album&#x27;s songwriting as being &quot;as strong as it has been in quite some time&quot;, with &quot;a newly found sense of urgency [keeping] the record going at a well-tempered pace&quot;. He also touted &quot;Love Metal&quot; as the album &quot;HIM has been struggling to make and realize for quite a while&quot;, providing &quot;dramatic metal of high sonic quality&quot;. Petri Silas of &quot;Soundi&quot; commended the band&#x27;s ability to innovate themselves with the &quot;faster songs&quot; amid the &quot;grand, mid-tempo tracks.&quot; He did however criticize the album of being more of the same &quot;pain-ridden, gothic dragging&quot;.

In 2017, Valo revisited &quot;Love Metal&quot; and declared it as the band&#x27;s best album, stating: &quot;We found the sound of the band, and I found myself. The band&#x27;s declaration of what we are.&quot; &quot;Loudwire&quot; later ranked &quot;Love Metal&quot; as HIM&#x27;s second best album, describing it as an improvement over &quot;Deep Shadows and Brilliant Highlights&quot; and as the album where the band &quot;truly found their sound that moved them forward throughout the next decade.&quot; On the other hand, &quot;Kaaoszine&quot; ranked &quot;Love Metal&quot; seventh in HIM&#x27;s discography, calling it &quot;a good collection of songs&quot;, but overall &quot;tiring&quot;.

==History==
Originally, Karkkila was a village in the municipality of Pyhäjärvi. In the 14th century, the Pyhäjärvi area belonged to the border area of the parishes of Janakkala and Lohja. In 1507, the Pyhäjärvi area became part of the Vihti parish, which was separated from the Lohja parish. Pyhäjärvi became the chapel congregation of the Vihti parish in 1654. The place was originally known as &quot;Pahajärvi&quot; (&quot;bad lake&quot;), but the name became established as &quot;Pyhäjärvi&quot; (&quot;holy lake&quot;) in the late 17th or 18th century. It was decided to form Pyhäjärvi as an independent parish by a decision of the Imperial Senate in 1861, but the separation did not happen until 1869. Based on the municipal decree of 1865, Pyhäjärvi began its activities as a municipality in 1868.

The borough of Karkkila was formed from the center of Pyhäjärvi by separating it from Pyhäjärvi in 1932. The borough area consisted mainly of the villages of Nyhkälä and Karkkila. The growth and industrialization of Karkkila has been affected by the now closed narrow-gauge Hyvinkää–Karkkila railway. Later, the municipality of Pyhäjärvi was merged with the Karkkila borough in 1969. Until now, the municipality and the borough had belonged to the Pyhäjärvi parish, whose name was changed to the Karkkila parish in connection with the municipal association. Officially, the Karkkila borough became a town in 1977.
