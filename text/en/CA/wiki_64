<text>Little Wilbraham is a village in Cambridgeshire, England, east of Cambridge between the A1303 and the A11. It is in the district of South Cambridgeshire. It is a small village with a population of only 394, increasing to 425 at the 2011 census, and there is little employment within the village. The church of Saint John the Evangelist lies to the east of the village.

==History==

Little Wilbraham was an independent village by 1086, known as Little Wilbraham by the 13th century - however also known as &#x27;Little Wilborham&#x27; during the early 17th century. In the mid-nineteenth century burials were excavated in the village, dating to the early medieval period, recovering 188 inhumations and 125 cremations, with notable finds including an iron-bound bucket and a horse burial. No ancient woodland was recorded in 1086, but 13 peasants were. The number of landholders increased to c. 40 by 1279. In 1563 there were only 21 families. Under Charles II, there were c. 40 dwellings and 124 adults. By the 1750s, this stood at 41 families with 183 adults. The total population rose steadily to reach 392 in 1851 and then 412 in 1881 before falling gradually to 266 in 1951. It now stands at 394.

Nowadays, a few small farmhouses and cottages survive from the 17th and early 18th century including White Hall, as timber-framed building from around 1600. Since 1800, there has been a divide in habitation in the village. To the east, on a street called Green Street by 1460, lay the rectory and the church whilst to the west, as section called Hawk Street, most of the farmhouses and cottages existed. The Gate, originally the main village public house, recorded from 1783, closed after 1937. The Hole in the Wall, however, was still open until recently in a 3 bayed, mid 16th century building, enlarged westward in the 18th century.

==St. John the Evangelist==
The main body of St. John&#x27;s Church in Little Wilbraham dates from the mid 13th century. The first known rector of the church was Walter, son of William, who lived around 1230. Late in the 13th century, the north aisle was added, probably originally as a chapel. On the outside, set into the flint wall, are the remains of the lower half of a crusader cross and this, along with the memory of the Order of the Templars, demonstrates the close links between the village and one of the Military Orders of the Crusading period. The 14th century saw major changes to the church. Early in the 14th century, the square tower was added at the west end, strengthened by supporting abutments or flying arches. On the north side, the wall was reconstructed so the top half of the crusader cross was lost. New windows were built in. Nearing the end of the 14th century, five ornate windows were also added.

In the 15th century, the south side of the chancel was reconstructed and the oak door leading into the church was added. The octagonal font to be found in the church is a remarkably well preserved example of perpendicular stone-work. The church at this time would have looked very similar to how it looks today. The tomb on the left side of the altar commemorates Revd. Erasmus Lane, rector who died on 27 October 1715, aged 75. In the chancel are two further tombs, one commemorating William Blackwey (died 11 April 1521) and the other for Rev. John Hook, fellow of Bene&#x27;t College, who died on 12 August 1777.

==Services==
The nearest hospital is Addenbrooke&#x27;s in Cambridge; the Doctors surgeries are in Bottisham away and Fulbourn. The majority of children attend the Church Controlled Primary School in Great Wilbraham, which was built in 1996 and has approximately 100 on roll. They then move on to Bottisham Village College. A Playgroup meets in a mobile classroom in the school grounds. There are no shops in the village and the nearest Post Office is in Great Wilbraham, there is however a small pub and a post box. There is no projected housing for the village as it is infill only. Many villagers also play in the local cricket and football teams based in the nearby village of Great Wilbraham.

<text>Shenton College is a public co-educational senior high school, located in Shenton Park, an inner western suburb of Perth, Western Australia. Like many WA high schools, it is a partially selective school with out-of-area students accepted on a number of criteria. It is one of the largest schools in Western Australia, with enrolled students as of .

==History==
Shenton College was established in January 2001 through the amalgamation of Swanbourne Senior High School and Hollywood Senior High School at a cost of $23.5 million. It was a project headed by the then Education Minister Colin Barnett as part of the Local Area Education Planning (LAEP) process.

The inaugural principal of the college was Pauline Coghlan, who was succeeded by Michael Morgan in September 2008. Assisting the Principal are six associate principals: Christopher Hill, Kristy Watson, Adam Pengelly, Jane Hamburg (Years 11 and 12), Gary Green (Years 9 and 10) and Chantal Simpson (Years 7 and 8).

In February 2009, Shenton College and Newman Senior High School in the Pilbara announced an inter-school partnership.

During a freak storm on 22 March 2010, the school was extensively damaged by heavy hail and torrential rain. As a result, the school was temporarily closed. Students from years 8 to 10 were not allowed back for 8 days.

In 2015, Shenton College was expanded to include Year 7 students.

==Education==
Shenton College draws students from a local intake area (catchment) that includes the suburbs of North Fremantle, Mosman Park, Cottesloe, Peppermint Grove, Swanbourne, Claremont, Mount Claremont, Dalkeith, Nedlands, Crawley, Shenton Park, Daglish, Jolimont, Floreat (south of Cambridge St and Oceanic Drive), Wembley (south of Cambridge Street), Subiaco (south of the Fremantle railway line and west of Station Street) and West Perth (south of Wellington Street).

Shenton also takes a quota of additional students from across Western Australia in a Gifted and Talented Education (GATE) program. Entry to the program is through the Academic Selective Entrance Test, an annual testing program administered by the Department of Education.

Entry to the Mathematics &amp; Literacy focus High Performance Learning (HPL) program is managed at the school level. Shenton College has student representation in a number of international youth conferences, including TEE Exhibition winners, winning community based competitions such as the West Australian Debating League (State Championship Winners 2004–2007 and 2010), being represented in nationwide competitions and conferences (Evatt Trophy Competition, Australian Computational and Linguistics Olympiad, United Nations Youth Conference, National Youth Science Forum, Australian National Schools Debating Championships) or being represented in international youth conferences (Australian representatives to the Hague International Model United Nations (THIMUN), the Global Young Leaders Conference, the Pacific Model United Nations (PacMUN), the Beijing Youth Science Creation Competition (BYSCC)).

According to Curriculum Council statistics, based on the number of students who scored 75% or more over four TEE subjects, Shenton College was the highest ranked public secondary school in 2009 and 2010. Based on Year 9 NAPLAN results, in 2012 Shenton College was the top ranked comprehensive public secondary school in Australia.

==Learning Links Program==
The University of Western Australia and Shenton College continue a partnership known as the Learning Links program, which provides educational and development opportunities for Shenton staff and students. A Memorandum of Agreement for the Learning Links program was signed in November 1999 between the University of Western Australia and Hollywood Senior High School. In 2001, the terms were transferred from Hollywood Senior High School to Shenton College.

The program comprises four major areas for collaboration to create opportunities for learning experiences for students and staff:

* Work UWA
* School Management Professional Development
* Educational Research Professional Development
* Student Enrichment

In Year 10, Shenton College students are offered work experience at the university in order to enjoy intellectual, social and cultural experiences that UWA has to offer, early in their education. Through Learning Links, Shenton College students have special access to the University of Western Australia and its facilities. For example, the Academic Focus Group students, selected for their outstanding academic potential in Year 11 and 12, are inducted to the UWA Library and have borrowing rights.

==Campus==

Shenton College was built in 2001 at a cost of $23.5 million on a site bounded by Lemnos Street, Selby Street and Stubbs Terrace. The campus is adjacent to the Shenton Park railway station on the Fremantle railway line.

In 2019, stage 2 of the campus construction was completed at a cost of $46 million, providing facilities for an additional 1,000 Year 11 and 12 studentstaking the school&#x27;s permanent capacity to 2,600 students. The expansion included new general classrooms; specialist classrooms for science, visual and performing arts, multimedia, IT and business studies; food and technology facilities; a new technology and enterprise centre; and a new cafeteria. The gymnasium was extended and new multi-purpose sports courts built.

The modern college buildings are of a pale limestone with colourful interior walls. The school incorporates red-brick heritage buildings of the historical Lemnos Hospital (constructed 1926), including Crete, Borneo and Alamein houses, which have been internally renovated for use as classrooms and offices.

As well as the main sports oval, the school has tennis, basketball, and netball courts; a gymnasium; and Lemnos Field, an artificial hockey turf near Gallipoli and Borneo houses.

<text>Derek Bickerton (March 25, 1926 – March 5, 2018) was an English-born linguist and professor at the University of Hawaiʻi at Mānoa. Based on his work in creole languages in Guyana and Hawaii, he has proposed that the features of creole languages provide powerful insights into the development of language both by individuals and as a feature of the human species. He is the originator and main proponent of the language bioprogram hypothesis according to which the similarity of creoles is due to their being formed from a prior pidgin by children who all share a universal human innate grammar capacity.

Bickerton also wrote several novels. His novels have been featured in the works of the Sun Ra Revival Post Krautrock Archestra, through spoken word and musical themes.

==Background==

Bickerton was born in Cheshire in 1926. A graduate of the University of Cambridge, England in 1949, Derek Bickerton entered academic life in the 1960s, first as a lecturer in English Literature at the University of Cape Coast, Ghana, and then, after a year&#x27;s postgraduate work in linguistics at the University of Leeds, as senior lecturer in linguistics at the University of Guyana (1967–71). For twenty-four years he was Associate Professor and Professor of Linguistics at the University of Hawaiʻi at Mānoa (1972–96), having meanwhile received a PhD in linguistics in 1976 from the University of Cambridge. He is the father of contemporary artist Ashley Bickerton. His other children are Julie Bickerton Bravata and Jim Bickerton.

==Research==
To answer questions about creole formation, in the late 1970s Bickerton proposed an experiment that involves marooning on an island six couples speaking six different languages, along with children too young to have acquired their parents’ languages. The National Science Foundation deemed the proposed experiment unethical and refused to fund it.

In his book &quot;Roots of Language&quot; (1981), Bickerton poses three questions:
1) How did creole languages originate?
2) How do children acquire language?
3) How did the language faculty originate as a feature of the human species?

In &quot;Language and Species&quot; (1990), he suggests that all three questions might be answered by postulating that the origin of language can be traced to the evolution of representation systems and symbolic thinking, together with a later development of formal syntax. Using primitive communication faculties, which then evolved in parallel, mental models became shared representations subject to cultural evolution. In &quot;Lingua ex Machina&quot; (2000), he and William Calvin revise this speculative theory by considering the biological foundations of symbolic representation and their influence on the evolution of the brain.

In his memoir &quot;Bastard Tongues&quot; (2008), he describes himself as a &quot;street linguist&quot; who emphasizes field work, with a &quot;total lack of respect for the respectable&quot;, and he outlines his theories for a general audience.

In &quot;Adam’s Tongue&quot; (2009), he makes an argument about the origin of language which relies on niche construction to supply the required evolutionary catalyst. He claims that human language is not on a continuum with animal communication systems (ACSs) but is a qualitatively different communicative system. Animal communication systems are only indexical, restricted to conveying information about immediate circumstances insofar as these impinge upon individual survival, reproduction, and social relations. Human language, on the other hand, is capable of spatial and temporal displacement.

Bickerton argues that peculiar features characterizing the ecological niche of early man allowed for this breakthrough from an ACS into language. He cites the fact that around two million years ago our ancestors were finding their way to the top of a scavenging pyramid, accessing the carcasses of megafauna before other predators and holding them off by working in coordinated groups. By imitating an animal, like a mammoth, one member could attempt to communicate information about such food sources. Although such imitative signaling retained an iconic character rather than fully symbolic, they involved an act of displacement in communication since the body could be miles away and discovered hours earlier. Over time, the sounds signifying something like a mammoth would be decontextualized and come to resemble something much more closely resembling a word. Displacement, Bickerton claims, is the hallmark feature of language.

In Bickerton&#x27;s view, these words allowed the formation of concepts rather than mere categories that animals are also capable of. Words began as the anchors for sensory information and memories about a specific animal or object. Once the brain had words it could create concepts which came together as a &#x27;protolanguage&#x27;. The protolanguage remained much like a pidgin for a million years or more, eventually it went from the &quot;beads-on-a-string&quot; model of speech to a hierarchical structure through Merge. Bickerton died in March 2018 at the age of 91.

<text>A number of notable software packages were developed for, or are maintained by, the Free Software Foundation as part of the GNU Project.

==General aspects of GNU packages==
Summarising the situation in 2013, Richard Stallman identified nine aspects which generally apply to being a GNU package, but he noted that exceptions and flexibility are possible when there are good reasons:

# The package should say that it is a GNU package.
# It should be distributed via ftp.gnu.org, or another site offering access to everyone.
# The package&#x27;s homepage should be on the GNU website.
# The developers must pay attention to making their software work well with other GNU packages.
# Documentation should be in Texinfo format, or in a format easily convertible to Texinfo.
# Should use GNU Guile for its extension language, but exceptions are explicitly possible in this regard.
# Should not recommend any non-free program, nor refer the user to any non-free documentation or non-free software.
# Use GNU terminology, including referring to &quot;GNU/Linux systems&quot; and &quot;free software&quot; in situations where other observers would write &quot;Linux&quot; and &quot;open source&quot;.
# The maintainer should be contactable, at least infrequently, to discuss problems in the software or fixing compatibility issues.
==Base system==
There is no official &quot;base system&quot; of the GNU operating system. GNU was designed to be a replacement for Unix operating systems of the 1980s and used the POSIX standards as a guide, but either definition would give a much larger &quot;base system&quot;. The following list is instead a small set of GNU packages which seem closer to being &quot;core&quot; packages than being in any of the further down sections. Inclusions (such as plotutils) and exclusions (such as the C standard library) are of course debatable.

<text>Smarty is a web template system written in PHP. Smarty is primarily promoted as a tool for separation of concerns.
Smarty is intended to simplify compartmentalization, allowing the front-end of a web page to change separately from its back-end. Ideally, this lowers costs and minimizes the efforts associated with software maintenance.

Smarty generates web content through the placement of special &quot;Smarty tags&quot; within a document. These tags are processed and substituted with other code. Tags are directives for Smarty that are enclosed by template delimiters. These directives can be variables, denoted by a dollar sign ($), functions, logical or loop statements. Smarty allows PHP programmers to define custom functions that can be accessed using Smarty tags.

== Smarty example ==
Since Smarty separates PHP from HTML, there are two files — one contains the presentation code: an HTML template, including Smarty variables and tags - {$title_text|escape} {$body_html} - which might look like this:

&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
&lt;html lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;
&lt;head&gt;
 &lt;meta charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;
 &lt;title&gt;{$title_text|escape}&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;

&lt;body&gt; {* This is a little comment that won&#x27;t be visible in the HTML source *}
{$body_html}
&lt;/body&gt; &lt;!-- this is a little comment that will be seen in the HTML source --&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
The business logic to use the Smarty template above could be as follows:

define(&#x27;SMARTY_DIR&#x27;, &#x27;smarty-2.6.22/&#x27;);
require_once(SMARTY_DIR . &#x27;Smarty.class.php&#x27;);

$smarty = new Smarty();
$smarty-&gt;template_dir = &#x27;./templates/&#x27;;
$smarty-&gt;compile_dir = &#x27;./templates/compile/&#x27;;

$smarty-&gt;assign(&#x27;title_text&#x27;, &#x27;TITLE: This is the Smarty basic example ...&#x27;);
$smarty-&gt;assign(&#x27;body_html&#x27;, &#x27;&lt;p&gt;BODY: This is the message set using assign()&lt;/p&gt;&#x27;);

$smarty-&gt;display(&#x27;index.tpl&#x27;);

<doc id="774942" wikidata="Q434334" url="?curid=774942" title="Ellen Fairclough">
<text>Ellen Louks Fairclough (; January 28, 1905 – November 13, 2004) was a Canadian politician. A Progressive Conservative member of the House of Commons of Canada from 1950 to 1963, she was the first woman ever to serve in the Canadian Cabinet.

==Early life and career==
Fairclough was born Ellen Louks Cook on January 28, 1905, in Hamilton, Ontario, to Norman Ellsworth and Nellie Bell (née Loucks) Cook. Fairclough was a chartered accountant by training, and ran an accounting firm prior to entering politics. She also served as a member of the executive for the Girl Guides of Canada prior to her election as a Member of Parliament.

==Political career==
Fairclough&#x27;s political career began as a member of Hamilton City Council (Ontario) from 1945 to 1950. Fairclough first ran for federal office as a Progressive Conservative in the 1949 federal election, in which she was defeated by incumbent Liberal MP Colin Gibson in Hamilton West. When Gibson was appointed to the Supreme Court of Ontario the following year, however, Fairclough ran in and won the resulting by-election.

As a Member of Parliament, she advocated women&#x27;s rights including equal pay for equal work.

When the PC Party took power as a result of the 1957 federal election, Prime Minister John Diefenbaker appointed her, on June 21, to the position of Secretary of State for Canada, and she became Canada&#x27;s first female cabinet minister. In 1958, she became Minister of Citizenship and Immigration, and from 1962 until her defeat in 1963, she was Postmaster General. As Immigration Minister in 1962, Fairclough introduced new regulations that mostly eliminated racial discrimination in immigration policy. She also introduced a more liberal policy on refugees, and increased the number of immigrants allowed into Canada.

Fairclough was also named as Acting Prime Minister of Canada from February 19 to 20, 1958; she was the first woman ever given the duty.

Toward the end of her term in office, Fairclough sought an appointment to the Senate of Canada, but was not appointed.

She was defeated in the 1963 election by Liberal Joseph Macaluso.

==Life after politics==
Fairclough was defeated in her bid for re-election in the 1963 election. She subsequently worked for the Hamilton Trust and Savings Corporation as a senior executive, as well as being chairperson of Hamilton Hydro.

In 1979, she was named an Officer of the Order of Canada, and was promoted to Companion in 1994. In 1989, she was the recipient of the Governor General&#x27;s Award in Commemoration of the Person&#x27;s Case. In the fall of 1996, she received the Order of Ontario, the highest honour awarded by the province.

Fairclough was active in the Consumers Association of Canada, the Girl Guides, the I.O.D.E., the Y.W.C.A., the United Empire Loyalist Association, and the Zonta Club of Hamilton and Zonta International, before, during and after her stay in office. In 1982, the Ontario government office tower on the corner of MacNab and King Streets in Hamilton was officially named the Ellen Fairclough Building.

In recognition of her status as a pioneering woman in Canadian politics, she was granted the rare honour of having the title Right Honourable bestowed upon her in 1992 by Queen Elizabeth II, one of very few Canadians to have the title who had not been Prime Minister, Governor General or Chief Justice.

At the Progressive Conservative leadership election, 1993, Fairclough was a supporter of Kim Campbell, and gave the speech to formally nominate Campbell on the convention floor.

In 1995, she published her memoirs, &quot;Saturday&#x27;s Child: Memoirs of Canada&#x27;s First Female Cabinet Minister&quot;.

She died at St. Joseph&#x27;s Villa, a nursing home in Dundas, Ontario, on November 13, 2004. She was 99. Her husband Gordon and son Howard both predeceased her.

On June 21, 2005, Canada Post issued a postage stamp in honour of Fairclough.

<doc id="774953" wikidata="Q889950" url="?curid=774953" title="President of Serbia and Montenegro">
<text>The president of Serbia and Montenegro () was the head of state of Serbia and Montenegro. From its establishment in 1992 until 2003, when the country was reconstituted as a confederacy (state union) via constitutional reform, the head of state was known as the president of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (). With the constitutional reforms of 2003 and the merging of the offices of head of government and head of state, the full title of the president was President of Serbia and Montenegro and [[Prime Minister of Serbia and Montenegro|Chairman of the Council of Ministers of Serbia and Montenegro]] (). In 2006 the office was abolished as the state union was dissolved, with Serbia and Montenegro becoming independent countries and was followed by Kosovo in 2008 although it received limited international recognition.

==Authority==
As head of state, the president had the power to

*represent the country at home and abroad
*appoint and recall heads of diplomatic and consular missions
*receive letters of credence and recall from foreign diplomatic representatives
*confer medals and other decorations
*promulgate laws passed by the Parliament
*call for parliamentary elections

In 2003, the powers of the president were extended to include the right to chair the Council of Ministers and propose the composition of the Council of Ministers to the parliament, effectively merging the powers of the head of government into the office. However, although the president became &quot;de jure&quot; both head of state and head of government, his role was largely limited because all the institutions were indirectly elected by confederal parliament, which was itself elected by parliaments of member states.

==Elections==
Under the 1992 constitution, the president was elected by the Federal Assembly of Yugoslavia for a four-year term. After the constitutional amendments of 2000, direct elections for the office of President were introduced. Under the 2003 constitution, the president was elected at the proposal of the president and vice president of the Parliament of Serbia and Montenegro for a four-year term. The president of Serbia and Montenegro was a member of the Supreme Defence Council together with the president of Serbia and the president of Montenegro.

The results of the direct presidential elections of 2000 were as follows:

==Presidents==
There were six presidents of FR Yugoslavia (two acting) after its assertion of independence from the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (SFRY) in 1992 up until its dissolution in 2003. Svetozar Marović of the Democratic Party of Socialists of Montenegro was the only President of the FR Yugoslavia after its constitutional reforms and reconstitution as a confederacy. He was inaugurated on March 7, 2003. After the declaration of independence of Montenegro, on June 3, 2006, the president announced on June 4, 2006 the termination of his office.

<doc id="774967" wikidata="Q730457" url="?curid=774967" title="José Watanabe">
<text>José Watanabe (1946 2007) was a Peruvian poet who won a number of literary awards.

Watanabe was born in Laredo, a large sugar cane farm in northern Peru. His father was a Japanese immigrant, and his mother was a Peruvian of Andean origin. In a very intimate way, Watanabe fused his two deep cultural backgrounds in brief but intense poetic work.

In 1970, Watanabe shared, with Antonio Cillóniz, first prize in the &quot;Young Poet&quot; contest organized by &quot;Cuadernos trimestrales de Poesía&quot;. This award has also been bestowed upon poets such as Javier Heraud and César Calvo. He won the award &quot;Young Poet of Peru&quot; in 1971 with his first book, &quot;Album de Familia&quot;.

After a silence of almost two decades, he resumed publishing in 1989 with &quot;El huso de la palabra&quot;. After that came &quot;Historia Natural&quot; (1994), &quot;Cosas del Cuerpo&quot; (1999) and &quot;Habitó entre Nosotros&quot; (2002). In 2000, he published in Colombia an anthology entitled &quot;El Guardián del Hielo&quot; and in 2004 he published in Spain &quot;Elogio del Refrenamiento&quot;, a comprehensive anthology that won numerous accolades.

&quot;He is one of the few living Peruvian authors that can be qualified as essential&quot; wrote Esperanza López Parada in Babelia, the literary supplement of &quot;El País&quot;.

Watanabe was also involved in the film industry as a screenwriter, production designer and art director. He died in April 2007.

<doc id="774968" wikidata="Q778914" url="?curid=774968" title="Brotherhood (New Order album)">
<text>Brotherhood is the fourth studio album by the English rock band New Order, released on 29 September 1986 by Factory Records. It contains a mixture of post-punk and electronic styles, roughly divided between the two sides. The album includes &quot;Bizarre Love Triangle&quot;, the band&#x27;s breakthrough single in the United States and Australia; it was the only track from the album released as a single and as a video (although &quot;State of the Nation&quot; was added to most CD editions).

The album sleeve, created by Peter Saville, is a photograph of a sheet of titanium–zinc alloy. Some early releases came in a metallic sleeve.

==Music==
&quot;Brotherhood&quot; saw the band further exploring their mix of post-punk and electronic styles, with the track listing being conceptually divided into &quot;disco and rock sides&quot;. Stephen Morris stated that the album &quot;was kind of done in a schizophrenic mood that we were trying to do one side synthesizers and one side guitars&quot;, which he retrospectively stated &quot;didn&#x27;t quite work&quot;.

In a 1987 interview with &quot;Option&quot;, Morris commented that the &quot;mad ending&quot; to &quot;Every Little Counts&quot; – which sounds like a vinyl record needle skipping the groove – is similar to the ending of The Beatles&#x27; &quot;A Day in the Life&quot;. Morris said: &quot;What we should have done is make the tape version sound like the tape getting chewed up. The CD could have the sticking sound.&quot;

Influences of Richard Wagner&#x27;s &quot;Prelude&quot; to &quot;Das Rheingold&quot; can be heard throughout the track &quot;All Day Long.&quot; New Order have subsequently used the piece as a concert opener.

==Critical reception==
Reviewing &quot;Brotherhood&quot; for the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, Steve Hochman wrote that New Order &quot;makes atmospheric grooves with more finesse than any contemporary computer-rocker.&quot; In his &quot;Consumer Guide&quot; column for &quot;The Village Voice&quot;, Robert Christgau selected the album as a &quot;pick hit&quot; and said: &quot;The tempos are a touch less stately, the hooks a touch less subliminal. Bernard Albrecht&#x27;s vocals have taken on so much affect they&#x27;re humane. And the joke closer softens up a skeptic like me to the pure, physically exalting sensation of the music.&quot;

In a 1993 retrospective review, &quot;Q&quot; critic Stuart Maconie described &quot;Brotherhood&quot; as &quot;often overlooked, nestling as it does between two superior studio albums&quot;, and ultimately &quot;more for the initiated than the first-time buyer.&quot; John Bush of AllMusic was more favourable, writing that &quot;for better and worse, this was a New Order with nothing more to prove – witness the tossed-off lyrics and giggles on &#x27;Every Little Counts&#x27; – aside from continuing to make great music.&quot; David Quantick of &quot;Uncut&quot; noted &quot;an increased tension between the frequent beauty of the music and the band&#x27;s Northern self-consciousness&quot; and concluded: &quot;This was New Order becoming New Order and if anyone was entitled to not be Joy Division, they certainly were.&quot; &quot;The A.V. Club&quot; Josh Modell called &quot;Brotherhood&quot; &quot;an unsung great of the catalog that&#x27;s dwarfed a bit by its massive single&quot;.

==Track listing==


Notes
* Most CD copies, with the sole exception of Qwest Records&#x27; 1988 release, feature the 12&quot; version of &quot;State of the Nation&quot; as a bonus track (although it is not listed as such). It is identical to the version found on &quot;Substance&quot;. It runs for 6:32, making the album&#x27;s new total running time approximately 43:39.

Notes
* &quot;True Faith&quot; (Eschreamer Dub) and &quot;Blue Monday &#x27;88&quot; (Dub) are only incorrectly listed on the disc itself. The booklet included with all five re-issued 2008 Collector&#x27;s Edition New Order Factory Records studio albums correctly identifies them.

<text>Dame Kelly Holmes (born 19 April 1970) is a retired British middle distance athlete and television personality.

Holmes specialised in the 800 metres and 1,500 metres events and won gold medals for both distances at the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens. She set British records in numerous events and still holds the records over the 600, and 1,000 metre distances. She held the British 800 metre record until 2021.

Inspired by a number of successful British middle-distance runners in the early 1980s, Holmes began competing in middle-distance events in her youth. She joined the British Army, but continued to compete at the organisation&#x27;s athletics events. She turned to the professional athletics circuit in 1993 and in 1994 she won the 1,500 m at the Commonwealth Games and took silver at the European Championships. She won a silver and a bronze medal at the 1995 Gothenburg World Championships, but suffered from various injuries over the following years, failing to gain a medal at her first Olympics in Atlanta 1996 when running with a stress fracture. She won silver in the 1,500 m at the 1998 Commonwealth Games and bronze in the 800 m at the 2000 Sydney Olympics, her first Olympic medal.

Holmes won the 1,500 m at the 2002 Commonwealth Games and the 800 m bronze at the Munich European Championships that year. The 2003 track season saw her take silver in the 1,500 m at the World Indoor Championships and the 800 m silver medals at the World Championships and first World Athletics Final.

She took part in her final major championship in 2004, with a double gold medal-winning performance at the Athens Olympics, finishing as the 800 m and 1,500 m Olympic Champion. For her achievements she won numerous awards and was appointed Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire (DBE) in 2005. She retired from athletics in 2005 and was between 2018 and 2024 an honorary colonel with the Royal Armoured Corps Training Regiment (RACTR). She has become a global motivational speaker, published five books, her latest being &quot;Running Life&quot;, and made a number of television appearances.

==Early life and army career==

Holmes was born in Pembury, near Tunbridge Wells in Kent, the daughter of Derrick Holmes, a Jamaican-born car mechanic, and an English mother, Pam Norman. Her mother was 17 at the time of her birth, and seven years later married painter and decorator Michael Norris, whom Holmes regards as her father. Holmes grew up in Hildenborough, Kent, where she attended Hildenborough CEP School, and then Hugh Christie Comprehensive School in Tonbridge from the age of 12.

She started training for athletics at the age of 12, joining Tonbridge Athletics Club, where she was coached by David Arnold and went on to win the English Schools 1,500 metres in her second season in 1983. Her hero was British middle-distance runner Steve Ovett, and she was inspired by his success at the 1980 Summer Olympics.

However, Holmes later turned away from athletics, joining the British Army at the age of 18, having left school two years earlier to work first as an assistant in a sweet shop and later as a nursing assistant for disabled patients. In the army, she became a HGV driver in the Women&#x27;s Royal Army Corps (WRAC), later becoming a basic physical training instructor (PTI). Holmes then elected in June 1990 to attend the first course to be run under the army&#x27;s new physical training syllabus, and passed out as a Class 2 PTI. Although militarily quite young, Holmes&#x27;s athletic prowess was impressive and she was encouraged to attend the course selection for full-time transfer to the Royal Army Physical Training Corps (RAPTC) at Aldershot.

Holmes eventually qualified as a class 1 PTI, although she remained in the Adjutant General&#x27;s Corps after the disbandment of the WRAC in 1992. She also became British Army judo champion and at an athletics event, she competed in and won an 800 metres, a 3,000 metres and a relay race in a single day. She also won the heptathlon.

Holmes watched the 1992 Summer Olympics on television, and on seeing Lisa York in the heats of the 3,000 metres – an athlete whom she had competed against, and beaten – she decided to return to athletics. For several years she combined athletics with employment in the army, until increased funding allowed her to become a full-time athlete in 1997.

==Athletics career==

=== Early and pre-Athens career ===
Highlights of her early and pre-Athens career included gold medals at the Commonwealth Games and silvers at the World and European Championships. In 2000 she also took a bronze at the Sydney Olympics.

===2004 Athens Olympic Games===

In 2017, Holmes revealed that after training in 2003 for the 2004 Summer Olympics at a French training camp where she suffered leg injuries and became depressed, she began cutting herself. &quot;I made one cut for every day that I had been injured&quot;, Holmes stated in an interview with the &quot;News of the World&quot; newspaper. At least once, she considered suicide, but she eventually sought help from a doctor and was diagnosed with clinical depression. While she could not use anti-depressants because it would affect her performance, she began using herbal serotonin tablets. In 2005, after her achievements at the 2004 Summer Olympics, Holmes chose to talk about her self-harm to show others that being a professional athlete is an extremely difficult thing to do and places the athlete under tremendous amounts of stress. Holmes&#x27;s honesty quickly won her praise from people on Twitter.

2004 saw Holmes arrive at a major competition, the Athens Olympics, with no injury worries for just about the first time in her career. She had originally planned to compete in just the 1,500 m but a victory over Jolanda Čeplak before the games had many saying she should take her chance in the 800 m as well. Holmes did not announce her decision to race in both events until five days before the 800 m finals. Along with three time World Champion Maria de Lurdes Mutola and Čeplak, Holmes was considered one of the favourites for the gold medal in the 800 m. In the final, Holmes ran a well-paced race, ignoring a fast start by a number of the other competitors, and moved into the lead ahead of Mutola on the final bend, taking the gold on the line ahead of Hasna Benhassi and Čeplak, with Mutola in fourth. Holmes became the seventh British woman to win an athletics gold, and the second after Ann Packer in 1964 to win the 800 metres.

In the final of the 1,500 m, again running from the rear of the field, she took the lead in the final straight, holding off World Champion Tatyana Tomashova of Russia. She thus became only the third woman in history to do the 800 m and 1,500 m double (after Tatyana Kazankina of the Soviet Union in 1976 and Svetlana Masterkova of Russia in 1996), and Britain&#x27;s first double gold medallist at the same games since Albert Hill in 1920. Her time of 3 minutes 57.90 seconds in the 1,500m final set a new British record for the distance.

Subsequently, Holmes was given the honour of carrying the British flag at the closing ceremony of the games, on 29 August, the day after her second victory. A homecoming parade was held in her honour through the streets of Hildenborough and Tonbridge on 1 September, which was attended by approximately 40,000 people. Holmes won the BBC Sports Personality of the Year in 2004, saying she achieved her goals after &quot;20 years of dreaming&quot;. She also asserted the award was &quot;the biggest sporting honour your country can give you&quot;. The tributes to her at the BBC awards ceremony were led by the six British female athletes who had previously won gold at the Olympic Games in a &quot;Magnificent Seven&quot;-style feature – those six being Mary Rand, Ann Packer, Mary Peters, Tessa Sanderson, Sally Gunnell and Denise Lewis.

==Honours and awards==
In 2007, she was awarded an Honorary Doctorate from Loughborough University.

In 2010, Holmes was inducted into the England Athletics Hall of Fame.

In 2018, she was made honorary colonel of the Royal Armoured Corps Training Regiment, serving as such until 1 November 2024.

==Dame Kelly Holmes Trust==

In 2008, Holmes founded the Dame Kelly Holmes Trust, a registered charity, to support young athletes and help the lives of young people facing disadvantage across the UK. As part of her pledge to the charity, she participated in the Powerman UK duathlon in 2014, one of several fundraising events she took part in.

==Post-athletics career==

Since 2004, Holmes has taken part in &quot;On Camp with Kelly&quot; athletics camps which train junior athletes, sponsored by insurance company Aviva (formerly Norwich Union).

In 2005, she won the Laureus World Sports Award for Sportswoman of the Year. The same year, she named the P&amp;O Cruise ship MS &quot;Arcadia&quot;. On 21 August, she competed in her final race in the UK, the 800 m at the Norwich Union British Grand Prix meeting in Sheffield. Her training schedule during the summer of 2005 had been disrupted by a recurrent Achilles tendon injury, and she finished the race in eighth place, limping across the finish line and completing a lap of honour on a buggy.

On 6 December 2005, Holmes announced her retirement from athletics, saying she had reassessed her future after the death of a friend, as well as citing a lack of motivation to continue.

In May 2009, Holmes was named as the president of Commonwealth Games England, succeeding Sir Chris Chataway, who had held the post since 1994. The organisation&#x27;s chairman Sir Andrew Foster said: &quot;Dame Kelly has been an outstanding athlete both for Team England and Great Britain. She is a truly inspirational and respected figure in the sporting world and will be a wonderful ambassador for Commonwealth Games England.&quot;

On 18 March 2019, Holmes, along with Paula Radcliffe and Sharron Davies, announced they would be writing a letter to the International Olympic Committee targeting trans women who compete in women&#x27;s sports categories.

On January 2023, Holmes spoke again on the subject of transgender individuals&#x27; inclusion in sports stating she had &quot;been ignorant&quot;, and believes that transgender individuals should receive fair outcomes in all areas of life, including sports, for those whose gender identity differs from the one assigned at birth.

Holmes is known for her advocacy on various health-related topics, particularly mental health and menopause.

===Television and radio===

In November 2010, Holmes took part in the ITV game show &quot;The Cube&quot;. In October 2011, she appeared live on Dubai One lifestyle show &quot;Studio One&quot; where she talked about her life and career after athletics.

In 2013 Holmes became the face of MoneyForce, a programme run by the Royal British Legion to deliver money advice to the UK armed forces.

In early 2015, she took part in the ITV series &quot;Bear Grylls: Mission Survive&quot; and was the runner-up after a 12-day survival mission.

In 2017, Holmes presented episode five of the BBC One television series &quot;Women at War: 100 Years of Service&quot;.

In December 2017, Holmes spoke about her 2003 mental health issues in an episode of &quot;All in the Mind&quot; on BBC Radio 4 and in 2018 was one of the judges of the programme&#x27;s awards.

In January 2023, Holmes spoke again on the subject of transgender individuals&#x27; inclusion in sports stating &quot;I have been ignorant in the past about the fight of the trans community and I now want to see fair and conclusive outcome for those whose gender differs from that assigned at birth, in all walks of life, including sport.&quot;.

Since September 2022, Holmes has been a regular panelist on the ITV Loose Women talk show.

===Cafe 1809 and The 1809 Hub===

In 2014 Holmes opened a cafe and community hub in Hildenborough named Cafe 1809 after her 2004 Olympics bib number. She opened a sister branch of the cafe in Gravesend in 2017, but this closed after a few months.

In October 2018 Holmes announced the cafe would close the following month, before re-opening as The 1809 Hub: &quot;a space for events, pop-ups, and community gatherings&quot;.

==Personal life==

In June 2022, Holmes came out as gay in an interview with the &quot;Sunday Mirror&quot;, adding that she felt &quot;finally free&quot;. She said that she had known she was a lesbian since 1988, when she was in the army; she could not come out then as it was illegal at the time to be gay in the military. After winning two Olympic gold medals at Athens in 2004 and becoming a public figure, she feared there may still be consequences from the army if she came out after leaving, and that she may be shunned within athletics as there were no openly gay sportspeople she knew of. LGBT campaigners celebrated Holmes coming out, saying that it sheds light on the historic homophobia that can still serve as a barrier to older people coming out.

Later that month, on 26 June, ITV broadcast a 55-minute documentary &quot;Kelly Holmes: Being Me&quot; in which she describes her fears of her sexuality being exposed, and meets two people who were discharged from the military for being gay. Holmes wrote: &quot;The documentary taught me so much about generational and social advancements when it comes to the LGBTQ+ world.&quot;

==Artistic recognition==

In 2012, Holmes was one of five Olympians chosen for a series of body-casting artworks by Louise Giblin, exhibited in London with copies being sold in aid of the charity Headfirst.

In 2017 a statue of Holmes by sculptor Guy Portelli was erected in Tonbridge.

<doc id="774972" wikidata="Q576457" url="?curid=774972" title="The Panics">
<text>The Panics are an indie rock band originally from Perth, Western Australia, and currently based in Melbourne, Victoria.

==History==
===2000–2006: Band formation and LittleBigMan Records===
The band started out while Jae Laffer (then known by his actual first name, Justin) and Drew Wootton were still at high school in Kalamunda, an outer suburb of Perth, Western Australia. Laffer and Wootton met on their first day of school. The duo added Drew&#x27;s younger brother Myles on drums, Paul Otway on bass and Jules Douglas on slide guitar, keyboards and vocals and formed The Panics.

After being spotted playing at the Inglewood Hotel by Happy Mondays&#x27; Gaz Whelan and Pete Carroll, following Happy Mondays&#x27; Perth performance at The Big Day Out in 2000, they were the first signing to the UK-based label LittleBIGMAN Records.

Laffer later said &quot;That&#x27;s what&#x27;s been really cool about us and the label is that it was just the fact it was new for everyone and we weren&#x27;t just another band that they were adding to their roster. It felt really exciting to be part of a label that seemed to have really good ideals and be run by guys who certainly have their heads in the right place and are pro-artist as opposed to pro-money and I truly believe that.&quot;

The Panics first release was a self-titled EP in January 2002. Tracks &quot;My Brilliant Career&quot; and &quot;Give Me Some Good Luck&quot; enjoyed high rotation on Australian radio station Triple J A second EP was released in 2002 and tracks &quot;This Day Last Year&quot; and &quot;How&#x27;s It Feel&quot; were also played on Triple J. In 2002, The Panics were the first Australian band to be invited to play at In the City, the UK&#x27;s annual music convention. Laffer said &quot;It was just a very spooky event. It was like playing a pub in Perth. It was condensed down to a couple of nights. In this one kind of block in Salford in Manchester there was about ten pubs all within walking distance, each with about five bands playing a night and just a huge huge amount of industry just doing the rounds, walking through. Every person in the crowd had a laminate. Our place was packed when we played which was great but it&#x27;s very hard to read industry people &#x27;cause they don&#x27;t want to jump around and cheer. We&#x27;d just finished recording and I remember being on stage and we were just having a laugh because it was just so great to be playing in England.&quot;

While in England they commenced recording tracks for their debut album. &quot;A House on a Street in a Town I&#x27;m From&quot; was released in 2003 to local critical praise and included the single &quot;Kid You&#x27;re a Dreamer&quot;, which was used as the credits theme music for the Australian drama The Surgeon on Network Ten. The band toured Australia for the first time and also played a series of gigs with Morrissey, Gomez, Grandaddy, The Church and Badly Drawn Boy. They went on to complete several sell out national headline tours of Australia..

In late 2004, the band headed back to England for a second UK tour, including supporting the Happy Mondays at a sold-out show to over 12,000 people on Clapham Common in London. Whilst in Manchester, they commenced writing new material for their next album,

The band&#x27;s second album, &quot;Sleeps Like a Curse&quot; was released in August 2005, and was nominated for the Triple J Australian Album of the Year. Shortly after the release of the album, the band relocated to Melbourne.

In October 2006 they released a three track single &quot;Factory Girl&quot;, a cover of the Rolling Stones&#x27; &quot;Factory Girl&quot; from their 1968 album, &quot;Beggars Banquet&quot;.

===2007–2010: Dew Process and &quot;Cruel Guards&quot;===
In February 2007 The Panics signed with Dew Process, and on 13 October 2007, the band released their third studio album, &quot;Cruel Guards&quot; which peaked at number 18 on the ARIA Charts and was certified gold. The album was Triple J&#x27;s feature album for the week of 8 October 2007 and went on to win the 2007 J Award for Triple J Australian Album of the Year.

The album&#x27;s lead single &quot;Don&#x27;t Fight It&quot; was released in August 2007 was featured in an episode of the Australian television drama series, Underbelly and appears on the soundtrack album. It was also used for the end scene of the Ugly Betty episode, &quot;Tornado Girl&quot;. The song became the band&#x27;s first to reach the ARIA top 50, peaking at number 43

At the ARIA Music Awards of 2008, the band were nominated for four awards, winning the ARIA Award for Best Adult Contemporary Album. Jae Laffer said &quot;We like to consider ourselves a bit more contemporary than adult, but we&#x27;ll take that.&quot; He Added &quot;The award was nice recognition after seven years together as a band. It&#x27;s almost like just a bit of validation for a lot of hard work. Also it keeps the band a little bit hungry just knowing that people are listening.&quot;

In early 2010, The Panics played a show at Kings Park, Perth backed by the West Australian Symphony Orchestra. The orchestra features many performers not unaccustomed to this form of cross-over with many, notably Michael Ingle, having previously played with Ben Lee and The Cat Empire.

The band contributed the song &quot;No More Tears&quot; on the Maurice Frawley 2010 tribute album, &quot;Long Gone Whistle - The Songs of Maurice Frawley&quot;.

===2011–present: &quot;Rain on the Humming Wire&quot; and &quot;Hole in Your Pocket&quot;===
On 29 July 2011, the band released their fourth studio album &quot;Rain on the Humming Wire&quot;, which peaked at number 7 on the ARIA Charts, becoming their first top ten album. At the ARIA Music Awards of 2011, the album was nominated for ARIA Award for Best Adult Alternative Album.
In 2013, The Panics were commissioned to write an original soundtrack for the ABC archival documentary &quot;Girt by Sea&quot; (2014). The film premiered at the Perth International Arts Festival in February 2014 where The Panics performed the score live to a sold-out audience.

Before recording their next album, the band had some time off with Laffer saying in 2016 &quot;The members felt as though they were running low on steam, unable to produce much fruitful work.&quot; On 7 October 2016, the band released their fifth studio album &quot;Hole in Your Pocket&quot;. Upon release, lead singer Jae Laffer spoke with Double J saying there is a &quot;beauty of making a record after a significant break [as] you&#x27;ve evolved as a person from when you were writing your last batch of songs&quot;, adding &quot;You experience some new things that you haven&#x27;t touched on before, musically and lyrically.&quot; Despite positive reviews, the album peaked at number 52 on the ARIA Chart.

Commencing fortnightly in April 2020, the band re-released their back catalogue on streaming services.

While the Parks and Recreation Division directly manages the large majority of the parks in the system, a few are either jointly-managed with other agencies or are leased to other governmental entities, either temporarily or on an ongoing basis. Michigan&#x27;s 103 state parks and recreation areas cover with 14,100 campsites in 142 campgrounds and over of trails. The state parks and recreation areas statewide collectively saw more than 26 million visits in 2016.

==History==
Michigan&#x27;s state parks system was started in 1919. Three Michigan state parks pre-date the creation of the park system in 1919: Mackinac Island State Park (1895), Michilimackinac State Park (1909) and Interlochen State Park (1917).

Mackinac Island State Park was created in 1895. It had served as the nation&#x27;s second national park for two decades beginning in 1875. In 1909, Michilimackinac State Park was created in nearby Mackinaw City. Both of these parks, along with Historic Mill Creek State Park are under the jurisdiction of the Mackinac Island State Park Commission.

Interlochen State Park was purchased by the Michigan Legislature in 1917 and was the first public park to be transferred to the Michigan State Park Commission in 1920. Because Mackinac Island State Park was a federal gift with its own commission and jurisdiction, for those reasons some choose to not consider it the first state park even though it predates Interlochen State Park by nearly 25 years.

Since 1919, 33 additional state park units have been decommissioned for varied reasons. The majority of these former state park units, 16, were transferred to counties or cities and are still local parks today. Four of the former units were incorporated into Michigan&#x27;s two National Lakeshores when were created in the 1960s and 70s, while five others were removed and reverted into surrounding state lands (state game areas, state forests, state fish hatcheries, etc.). Four of the units were incorporated into larger state recreation areas in the 1940s in the Greater Detroit area, although one of those recreation areas is now a local park. Two of the former state park units are now state forest campgrounds and another two units existed on state lands which were sold to private interests and closed. (The Former state park units section lists each of these former units.)

==Additional DNR facilities==

DNR operates 746 boat launches on of designated public water access sites. It also operates 16 &quot;harbors of refuge&quot; as well as providing support for the other 61 harbors in the system. The harbors of refuge are approximately apart along the Great Lakes shoreline to provide shelter from storms and often provide boat launches and supplies. There are 13 state underwater preserves covering of Great Lakes bottomland and ten of them have a maritime museum or interpretive center in a nearby coastal community.

The DNR Parks and Recreation Division also manages 138 state forest campgrounds (including a dozen equestrian campgrounds). The Michigan state game and wildlife areas encompass more than . DNR also oversees the trail systems in the state. This includes of non-motorized trails, of rail-trails, of off-road vehicle (ORV) routes and of snowmobile trails.

<text>Miguel Llobet Solés (18 October 187822 February 1938) was a classical guitarist, born in Barcelona, Spain. Llobet was a renowned virtuoso who toured Europe and America extensively. He made well known arrangements of Catalan folk songs for the solo guitar, made famous arrangements for the guitar of the piano compositions of Isaac Albéniz, arrangements immortalized by Andrés Segovia, and was also the composer of original works.

==Biography==
Some details of Llobet&#x27;s biography are confused and contradictory. The son of a gilder, he was baptized in the month of his birth in the church of &quot;Sant Just i Pastor&quot; on the &quot;Carrer de la Palma de Sant Just&quot;, the street where he spent his boyhood, just a few streets from the &quot;Carrer Gignàs&quot;, which (from 1884 through 1885) was the residence of his eventual teacher Francisco Tárrega. He was trained as an artist, revealing a talent for painting, and continued to paint throughout his life. His earliest musical training was on the violin and the piano. Later he received a guitar as a gift from an uncle. In December 1889, Llobet heard Antonio Jiménez Manjón (1866–1919) give a guitar recital at the &quot;Teatre Catalunya&quot; in Barcelona, and was inspired to seek instruction on the guitar from Magí Alegre.

Llobet first met, and played for, the great guitar pedagogue Francisco Tárrega in October 1892. Two years later he began to study with him at the Municipal Conservatory of Music in Barcelona. By his own account, his studies with Tárrega do not seem to have been based on any particular method, rather Llobet would observe Tárrega play and then experiment with his techniques at home. &quot;Così, più che impararla, io sperimentavo la mia tecnica sulla chitarra&quot;. (&quot;In this way, more than by learning it, I experimented with my guitar technique.&quot;)

He began giving private concerts for intimate gatherings in 1898. Around that time he met Concepción Gómez de Jacoby, Tárrega’s patron, who also became his own patron, helping him to launch an international career. Prat, 1934, p. 184-5, recounts that after meeting Llobet, Concepción took him to Málaga, and in 1900 to Paris, bringing him out of the Barcelona area for the first time and allowing him to begin an international concert career. His first public concert took place in 1901 at the Conservatory of València. During that same year, he also performed at conservatories in Seville and Málaga, where he was awarded the honorary title of Professor. He played at the Teatro de la Comedia in 1902 and before the Spanish royal family in Madrid in 1903.

In 1904 in Paris Llobet&#x27;s first concert outside Spain was presented by Ricardo Viñes, the noted pianist. It was at this time that he first came into contact with the avant garde. Paris was apparently kind to Llobet, as he returned to live there in 1905, performing at such prestigious venues as the Schola Cantorum, La Trompette and the Société Nationale de Musique. According to Ronald Purcell, he resided there until 1910. In the biographical sketch given by Bruno Tonazzi, Llobet returned to Paris in 1910 but according to Purcell he probably temporarily relocated to Buenos Aires in that year. From there he performed throughout South and Central America and the Caribbean in a series of tours largely arranged by Domingo Prat, (author of the &quot;Diccionario de Guitarristas&quot; 1933), Juan Anido (father of María Luisa Anido) and Ruiz Romero of the publishing house Romero y Fernandez. In 1912, Llobet gave his first concerts in the United States, performing in Boston, Philadelphia and New York City. He then returned to Paris.

In the following years, he continued to perform throughout Europe, particularly in Belgium and the Netherlands. During 1913 and 1914 he performed throughout Germany. According to Purcell, &quot;At the outbreak of World War I, Llobet returned to Buenos Aires,&quot; and continued to make trips throughout the Americas. while Tonazzi states that at the outbreak of the First World War he returned to his native land. Llobet&#x27;s concert itinerary seems to have been dominated by performances in the Americas at that time, lending some support to Purcell&#x27;s claims, however Purcell also implies that Llobet was in Spain about 1915, where he taught his most important pupil, Andrés Segovia.

Segovia&#x27;s autobiography, written at the height of his career, depicts himself as being self-taught - there are admissions of his seeking out Llobet&#x27;s advice for a short time, but Segovia is quite clear about the lack of any real influence on his playing. At the age of 22, Segovia was still youthful enough to have received valuable instruction. Purcell states that &quot;At the age of twenty-two (Segovia) pursued what he considered the only direct contact to Tárrega, Llobet, for refinement of his technique and especially for the music that both he and Tárrega had written and transcribed for the guitar...&quot; and that &quot;Segovia, whose performance style and technique reveals [sic] the principles of Tárrega, was basically influenced by Llobet...This stylistic influence can be heard when comparing Llobet&#x27;s Parlophone Electric recordings (Chanterelle Historical Recordings CHR 001) with Segovia&#x27;s Angel recordings, ZB 3896&quot;.

In 1915, Llobet made one attempt at recording at the Victor studios in New York, but the two sides he recorded, Manuelito and Sueño, were rejected. The prominent guitarist Vahdah Olcott-Bickford, who was living in New York at the time, writes that &quot;he tried to make a recording at the Bell Lab in New Brunswick, New Jersey, but was dissatisfied with the sound.&quot; It is also known that he toured the East Coast of the United States in 1912, 1914 and 1917.

In 1920-1921, Llobet played in Spain and toured throughout Germany, performing in Munich, Leipzig, Dresden, Cologne and Stuttgart. In 1922 he was in Vienna for the first time. When in Vienna, Llobet was frequently a guest in the house of Luise Walker&#x27;s parents. In 1924, he again toured throughout Germany and Austria, and he concertized in the Americas in 1925. He returned again to the Americas in 1930 to perform for the Spanish Arts Festival, under the auspices of the Library of Congress. The violinist Antonio Bossa had recommended him, and he was contracted to play six solos, and to arrange and perform Manuel de Falla&#x27;s &quot;Siete Canciones Españolas&quot; with soprano Nina Kochitz.

In 1923, he began to teach María Luisa Anido (1907–1997) in Buenos Aires. By 1925, the two were performing duets and, according to Purcell, about 1930 recorded some of Llobet&#x27;s duet arrangements on the Odeon-Parlophone label distributed by Decca. These recordings followed a solo series recorded by Llobet on the Parlophon/Electric series out of Barcelona&quot;. The solo recordings, among the first released of the classical guitar, are supposed to have been recorded around 1925, but are from two different sources: Argentina/Odeon recording sessions as well as the earlier Barcelona/Parlophon recording. In response to an inquiry, Purcell stated that &quot;Llobet did not care for the acoustic recording results in 1915 and only recorded electronically... His recordings were recorded in 1925 and later with Maria Anido&quot;. It may be noted that electronic recording was developed by Bell Labs under its Western Electrical branch, and was leased to recording companies under the name of &quot;Westrex Electrical Recording System&quot; beginning in 1925. Initially only Victor and Columbia records leased it, with an up-front payment of $50,000 each. Under the general management of Louis Sterling, Columbia acquired a number of European, Asian, and U.S. recording companies in 1925. Sterling soon after arranged for a holding company to combine Columbia and the Carl Lindstrom group, which included Parlphone and Odeon, the companies that seem to be the ones under which Llobet&#x27;s recordings were released.

Llobet toured Europe again in 1930-1931, performing in London, Berlin, Hamburg, Munich, Vienna, Budapest and Bologna among others. On hearing him in Berlin Paul Hindemith declared an intent to compose for the guitar, but did not follow this through - Hindemith&#x27;s only work for guitar, the &quot;Rondo for Three Guitars&quot;, had been written in 1925.

From 1932 to 1934, Llobet taught the young Cuban virtuoso José Rey de la Torre at his home in Barcelona. He does not appear to have performed much at this time, but maintained his artistic contacts. Rey writes: &quot;At the time I arrived in Barcelona in 1932, he had almost retired from the concert stage. During the three years that I spent there he left town only once for a month&#x27;s tour of Scandinavia.&quot;

Llobet seems to have enjoyed a somewhat reclusive retirement from the concert stage, Rey de la Torre who, as Llobet&#x27;s pupil, may well have been his most frequent visitor, writes that &quot;Llobet did not have many visitors...&quot; He did seem to go out to concerts frequently, walking with his wife, to the close to his home, and met a few influential artists at his large apartment at Via Layetana No. 46 in Barcelona: Emilio Pujol was a frequent guest and Manuel de Falla is known to have visited whenever in that city.

The statement by Philip J. Bone in &quot;The Guitar and Mandolin&quot; that Llobet &quot;was killed in 1937, in an air raid in Barcelona during the Spanish Civil War&quot; (Bone 1954) has been tacitly contradicted by all reliable sources. However, the emotional devastation over the siege of Barcelona may have begun his downward spiral of health. On 22 February 1938, Llobet died of pleurisy in Barcelona.

His complete works, edited by Professor Ron Purcell, were published by Chanterelle Verlag. Chanterelle, now under the ownership of Musicverlag Zimmermann, is in the process of publishing new Urtext editions of the complete catalog under the editorship of Stefano Grondona. These new and more definitive editions are based on autograph manuscripts found in the Miguel Llobet Collection of the Museu de la Música in Barcelona.

==Llobet&#x27;s guitars==

Among the guitars used by Llobet, one finds:
Antonio de Torres, 1859, Llobet&#x27;s favorite guitar; he refused to have a split in the back repaired for fear that it would affect the exquisite tone. See LA CHITARRA di LIUTERIA, Grondona and Waldner, 2001. Llobet is known to have toured with Torres guitars FE 09 and FE 13.

<doc id="774978" wikidata="Q13439268" url="?curid=774978" title="Tino De Angelis">
<text>Anthony &quot;Tino&quot; De Angelis (November 3, 1915 – September 26, 2009) was a Bayonne, New Jersey, commodities trader who dealt in vegetable oil futures worldwide.

In 1962 De Angelis&#x27; company, &quot;Allied Crude Vegetable Oil Refining Corporation&quot;, bilked 51 banks out of over $180 million ($ billion today) in what became known as the salad oil scandal after he failed to corner the soybean oil market.

==Biography==
De Angelis was born to Italian immigrant parents in the Bronx. While still a teenager he managed about 200 employees in a meat and fish market. When he found out that the new National School Lunch Act program would buy practically any food items (given certain price requirements) he took over the Adolph Gobel Company in North Bergen, New Jersey and was awarded a large contract, whence he promptly overcharged the government by $31,000. He also delivered over 2 million pounds of uninspected meat. Gobel would eventually go bankrupt.

In 1955, he formed &quot;Allied Crude Vegetable Oil Refining Corporation&quot; and other related companies to participate in the U.S. government&#x27;s Food for Peace program to sell subsidized surplus food ingredients to Europe to shore up their weak post-war economies. He formed Allied in a dilapidated &quot;tank farm&quot; in Bayonne, New Jersey and, with the patronage of several major grain exporters, began shipping massive quantities of substandard shortening and other vegetable oil products to Europe. De Angelis gradually became a major player in Europe and the commodities markets, later expanding into cotton and soybeans.

In 1962, De Angelis began to accumulate massive quantities of soybean oil to attempt to corner the soybean oil market. With his huge inventory as collateral, he borrowed from various Wall Street banks and companies, and used the proceeds to buy as many oil futures as possible. Soon he would be long a large quantity hoping for soon-to-be expensive oil and oil futures, as prices rose due to the market corner.

==Fraud with warehouse receipts ==
In the early 1960s American Express (Amex) was a respected name in traveler&#x27;s checks and credit cards. The company created a new division to specialize in &quot;Field Warehousing&quot; to finance businesses using their inventory of goods and commodities as collateral. Tino De Angelis was a new customer and Amex wrote warehouse receipts for many millions of barrels of vegetable oil with him as beneficiary. The receipts would then be presented to a bank or broker and discounted for cash.

As De Angelis&#x27; stock of warehouse receipts increased, he began to replace the soybean oil in his tanks with water. Some tanks had special compartments, while others were hooked-up to a maze of pipes to shuttle oil from one tank to the next to fool inspectors.

What puzzled authorities about Amex&#x27;s Field Warehousing operation was that De Angelis&#x27; soybean oil stock exceeded the stock available in the entire United States, according to the Department of Agriculture. While the warehouse operation was small, Amex was lenient with De Angelis, as he was one of their main customers. With Amex staking its reputation behind all the oil and with De Angelis offering great deals, mainstream companies such as Bunge Limited, Staley, and Procter and Gamble were soon participating. Bank of America joined in to provided collateralized loans.

==Scheme exposed ==
Inspectors were eventually tipped off by bribery attempts and delivery mistakes. They inspected Allied&#x27;s tanks again and this time they found the water. A massive soybean oil futures crash ensued and wiped out the value of the loan collateral in minutes. On November 19, 1963, De Angelis&#x27; company filed for bankruptcy and investors found hundreds of millions of dollars in unaccounted funds. The financial integrity of the dealers behind De Angelis&#x27; futures trades was now in question. Traders scurried to recover their funds after the New York Stock Exchange, worried about a U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission investigation, suspended &quot;Williston and Beane&quot; and &quot;Ira Haupt and Co.&quot;&#x27;s trading privileges.

On November 22, 1963, NYSE president G. Keith Funston attempted to avert a market crash as Ira Haupt&#x27;s 20,700 customers, fearing financial ruin, scrambled to sell their oil holdings before they became worthless. Because of all the trades the brokerage firm did on De Angelis&#x27; behalf, various banks were left holding the bag with over $37 million in unrecoverable loans. This rush, combined with the panic ensuing from the shooting of President Kennedy that afternoon, led to 2.6 million shares being sold and the Dow dropping 24 points (about 5%) in 27 minutes. The exchange was forced to close 83 minutes early.

U.S. Attorney for the District of New Jersey David M. Satz Jr., charged De Angelis with contempt after he found De Angelis had funneled over $500,000 from Allied into his personal account at a Swiss bank. Amex was forced to make good on their warehouse contracts and took a massive loss. The two trading firms were eventually bought by larger players. De Angelis was sentenced to a seven-year jail term. In the wake of the scandal, keen observer and investor Warren Buffett took advantage of the plunge in the price of American Express shares and bought 5% of the company for only $20 million.

In 1972, De Angelis was released. By 1975 he was involved in another scam, this time a Ponzi scheme involving livestock in the Midwest. De Angelis used two slaughter houses, Rex Pork and Mister Pork, to swindle livestock dealers in Indianapolis out of $7 million (approximately $31M in 2016 dollars) worth of hogs. Two of the top livestock dealers facing losses were M&amp;R Livestock (owned by Theodore C. McAninch) and Farrow and Co. (owned by Allan S. Farrow). De Angelis continued trading with these livestock dealers via fraudulent letters promising payment. The biggest loser, M&amp;R Livestock, was owed $3.5 million ($21 million in 2016 dollars).

The swindle was documented in detail by Norman C. Miller in &quot;The Great Salad Oil Swindle&quot; (Baltimore, MD: Coward McCann Books, 1965). The book is based on Miller&#x27;s coverage of the story in the &quot;Wall Street Journal&quot;, which won a Pulitzer Prize in 1964.

<text>Testosterone propionate/testosterone phenylpropionate/testosterone isocaproate/testosterone decanoate (TP/TPP/TiC/TD), also known as a Sustanon 250 (Organon), is an injectable combination medication of four testosterone esters, all of which are androgens/anabolic steroids. 

== Pharmacology ==
The four testosterone esters are as follows;

* 30 mg testosterone propionate
* 60 mg testosterone phenylpropionate
* 60 mg testosterone isocaproate
* 100 mg testosterone decanoate
Cumulatively, a 1 ml of the oil solution contains exactly 250 mg of above mentioned testosterone esters. This particular numerical value is clearly depicted in the name of the product, &quot;Sustanon 250&quot;.

They are provided as an oil solution and are administered by intramuscular injection. The different testosterone esters provide for different elimination half-lives in the body. Esterification of testosterone provides for a sustained but non-linear release of testosterone hormone from the injection depot into the circulation. Sustanon 100 is administered once every 2 weeks and Sustanon 250 is administered once every 3 to 4 weeks.

Sustanon is the preferred method of testosterone replacement in the United Kingdom as detailed in the British National Formulary. There was a brief shortage of Sustanon 250 during late 2011, due to shifting of manufacturing site, and a further shortage in mid-2012 due to manufacturing problems.

This form of testosterone has long been a popular choice of anabolic steroid among bodybuilders while bulking.

== Synonyms/brands ==

* &quot;Durandrone Forte&quot;
* &quot;Sustanon prolongatum&quot;
* &quot;Prarbolan&quot;

<doc id="774989" wikidata="Q7734468" url="?curid=774989" title="The Flip Wilson Show">
<text>The Flip Wilson Show is an hour-long variety show that originally aired in the US on NBC from September 17, 1970, to June 27, 1974. The show starred American comedian Flip Wilson; the program was one of the first American television programs starring a black person in the title role to become highly successful with a white audience. Specifically, it was the first successful network variety series starring an African American. During its first two seasons, it was the nation&#x27;s second most watched show according to Nielsen ratings.

== Overview ==

The show consisted of many skits in a 60-minute variety format. It also broke new ground in American television by using a &quot;theatre-in-the-round&quot; stage format, with the audience seated on all sides of a circular performance area (with some seats located &quot;behind&quot; the sketch sets on occasion).

Wilson was most famous for creating the role of Geraldine Jones, a sassy, modern woman who had a boyfriend named Killer (who, when not in prison, was at the pool hall). Flip also created the role of Reverend Leroy, who was the minister of the Church of What&#x27;s Happening Now! New parishioners were wary of coming to the church as it was hinted that Reverend Leroy was a con artist. Wilson popularized the catchphrase &quot;The Devil made me do it!&quot;.

Geraldine Jones was a recurring character played by Wilson wearing women&#x27;s clothing. Some of Geraldine&#x27;s most famous quotes are, &quot;The Devil made me buy this dress!&quot;, &quot;Don&#x27;t you touch me, honey, you don&#x27;t know me that well! You devil, you!&quot; and &quot;What you see is what you get!&quot;

In addition to the skits, Wilson also signed many popular singers to provide entertainment. African-American singers such as Ella Fitzgerald, James Brown, Louis Armstrong, Lena Horne, Stevie Wonder, The Jackson 5, The Chi-Lites, Ray Charles, Aretha Franklin, Gladys Knight &amp; the Pips, The Pointer Sisters, Charley Pride, Johnny Mathis, The Temptations, and The Supremes appeared on the program, as well as many contemporary white entertainers like Bobby Darin (a frequent guest on his show), Bing Crosby (two appearances), Roy Clark, Joan Rivers, The Osmonds, Johnny Cash, Roger Miller, and Pat Boone. Usually, the singers also appeared in skits with Wilson.

Wilson&#x27;s clout allowed him to get both the new breakout performers (such as The Jackson 5, Roberta Flack, Sandy Duncan, Lily Tomlin, George Carlin, Bill Cosby, Richard Pryor, Albert Brooks, Lola Falana, and Melba Moore, all of whom became popular during this period) as well as established singers. In late 1971, gospel legend Mahalia Jackson made one of her last public performances on &quot;The Flip Wilson Show&quot;.

While &quot;The Flip Wilson Show&quot; first shared a studio with other television series, Wilson&#x27;s massive popularity allowed for him to get his own set of soundstages, starting in the fall 1972 season. As the seasons went on, however, the show&#x27;s ratings slipped; ratings across the variety show genre began a terminal decline in the mid-1970s. This, coupled with Wilson&#x27;s repeated demands for higher raises in his salary, caused the series to go over its budget and led to its cancellation.

Half-hour versions of the series aired on TV Land from 1997 to 2006. From 2011 to 2012, the show aired on TV One. From 2012 to 2016, half-hour versions of the show aired on the Aspire network. Decades presented a Weekend Binge of the half-hour version on October 8–9, 2022. Decades&#x27; successor network Catchy Comedy ran a &quot;Catchy Binge&quot; of the half-hour version on July 29–30, 2023, and again on April 6–7, 2024.

==Broadcast history and ratings==
==Reception==
&quot;The Flip Wilson Show&quot; won two Emmy Awards out of 18 nominations. The wins were both in 1971, for Outstanding Variety Series—Musical and Outstanding Writing Achievement in Variety or Music. Wilson won both awards, with producer Bob Henry and executive producer Monte Kay also earning statuettes for the variety series honor and Herbert Baker, Hal Goodman, Larry Klein, Bob Schiller, Bob Weiskopf and Norman Steinberg for their writing.

Other nominations included Outstanding Variety Series in 1972 and 1973; Outstanding Writing Achievement in Variety or Music in 1972 and 1973 (Dick Hills and Sid Green replaced Norman Steinberg in 1972 on the nomination, and Stan Burns, Peter Gallay, Don Hinkley, Mike Marmer and Paul McCauley replaced Hal Goodman, Larry Klein, Bob Schiller and Bob Weiskopf in 1973); Outstanding New Series in 1971; Outstanding Directorial Achievement in Variety or Music in 1971, 1972 and 1973, all for Tim Kiley; Outstanding Achievement in Live or Tape Sound Mixing in 1971 and 1972 for Dave Williams; Outstanding Achievement in Art Direction or Scenic Direction in 1971, 1972 and 1973 for Romain Johnston; Outstanding Single Program – Variety or Musical in 1972; Outstanding Achievement in Lighting Direction in 1972 for John Nance; and Outstanding Achievement in Technical Direction in 1972 for technical director Louis Fusari and cameramen Ray Figelski, Rich Lombardo, Jon Olson and Wayne Osterhoudt.

Flip Wilson won one Golden Globe award in 1971 and received two other nominations in 1972 and 1973 for Best Performance by an Actor in a Television Series – Comedy or Musical. &quot;The Flip Wilson Show&quot; received an additional Golden Globe nomination in 1972 for Best Television Series—Comedy or Musical.

<text>The Secretary of State for Canada, established in 1867 with a corresponding department, was a Canadian Cabinet position that served as the official channel of communication between the Dominion of Canada and the Imperial government in London.

As Canada became increasingly independent after World War I, and particularly with the passage of the Statute of Westminster in 1931, this role fell into disuse. The department was maintained, however, and was used to administer various aspects of government that did not have their own ministry. Accordingly, the Secretary of State for Canada was Registrar General of Canada, responsible as such for the Great Seal of Canada and various functions of state associated with it.

At various times the Secretary of State for Canada was responsible for the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, the civil service, the Queen&#x27;s Printer for Canada, administration of Crown lands, and governance of Canadian Indians (as they were called at the time), as well as various ceremonial and state duties. Generally, any government role and responsibility which was not specifically assigned to a cabinet minister would be the de facto responsibility of the Secretary of State.

The department was eliminated in 1993 when the government was reorganized; however, the position of Secretary of State for Canada was not legally eliminated until 1996 when its remaining responsibilities were assigned to other cabinet positions and departments, particularly the newly created Minister of Canadian Heritage position.

The position of Secretary of State for Canada had no relation to that of Secretary of State for External Affairs except for the period from 1909 until 1912 when the Secretary of State for Canada (Charles Murphy under Sir Wilfrid Laurier, and William James Roche under Sir Robert Borden) was responsible for the newly created Department of External Affairs.

<doc id="774997" wikidata="Q7448141" url="?curid=774997" title="Self-locking device">
<text>Self-locking devices are pieces of rock-climbing equipment intended to arrest the fall of solo climbers who climb without partners. This device is used for rope solo climbing, for &quot;ground-up climbing&quot;, and for &quot;top rope solo climbing&quot;. To date, several types of self-locking devices have evolved.

==Types==

===Prusik sling===

The earliest type of self-belay device used was the ubiquitous prusik knotted sling used by climbers. The method requires the solo climber to feed out an estimated length of belay rope so that they can reach their next stance and repeat the process as the rope is difficult to feed through the prusik knot while climbing.

===Gibbs-style type 1 ascender===

The next level of device development improved on the locking limitations of the prusik sling by utilizing a cam that is activated by the climber&#x27;s body moving down to rotate the simple grab cam inside a rigid frame. The climber&#x27;s harness is directly attached to the cam and the frame encapsulates the rope.

Early versions of the cam systems used a Gibbs-style type 1 ascender placed in an inverted position attached to a soloer&#x27;s sit harness opposite to the manufacturer&#x27;s intended use. The combination of a climber&#x27;s body position in a fall and friction between the ascender frame and the rope provides the activating leverage for the cam to grab the rope. Fall forces generated using this device and the cam profile can be enough to damage a rope due to the high clamp loads induced by the cam lever arm. The main drawback to this system is that it is like the prussik knot system where the soloer also has to feed out an estimated amount of rope in order to reach a stance point.

===Floating cam ascender===

A big improvement over the Gibbs-style type 1 ascender was the design of the Wren Industries &quot;Soloist&quot; – the device incorporates a floating cam that is activated by the relative position of the rope to the device frame, with the frame secured between a user&#x27;s sit harness and a chest harness. The Soloist allows the rope to feed without the need for the soloer to manually feed out between stances – so it allows a &#x27;true&#x27; hands-free climb.

Knowledge of the correct device position relative to the rope anchor is critical for the correct operation of the cam devices in a fall as they are mono-directional in operation, and the soloer must be aware that he needs to put in a runner as soon as he sets off above the belay point on a multi-pitch climb, otherwise he can slide to the bottom of the rope in the event of a fall. The Soloist cam profile design allows the belay rope to be &quot;grasped&quot; rather than crushed as in the early cam devices.

===Inertial drum brake ascender===
To overcome these limitations, the Wren Industries &#x27;Silent Partner&#x27; device was developed. This system has four mechanical moving parts inside a frame that is attached to a climber&#x27;s sit harness and is basically an inertial drum brake with the belay rope connected to the device by tying a clove hitch around the device&#x27;s drum. The Silent Partner is unique in the sense that it operates in both directions of drum rotation so it can be attached to a climber&#x27;s sit harness in either position, eliminating the danger of stepping off a multi-pitch anchor point before the first runner can be placed.

As long as the clove hitch can feed over the drum, the rope will feed through the device. In a fall, the drum is back driven by the rope as the device slides down the rope; when the drum rotation exceeds a certain angular velocity, it locks off to the frame and the increase in friction induced between the stationary drum and the rope causes the clove hitch to rapidly tighten around the locked drum to arrest the fall.

The method used to lock the drum against the device frame is by the use of two straight knurl edge discs that are thrown outwards by centrifugal force as they ride on parallel ramps milled into the drum&#x27;s enclosed outer periphery. Two light return springs act as centrifugal force trips and as return springs to reset the discs when the fall load is released and the device is unlocked. A simple nylon guide is used to ensure both discs activate simultaneously to jam the discs between each drum ramp and the frame&#x27;s lock ring.

While the device works quite well, it suffers from rope drag that can prematurely tighten the clove hitch, so allowance must be made to reduce the hanging weight of the rope below the device. The rope diameter and elasticity is critical for operation, as higher than normal fall forces can be generated due to the rapid locking rate, in the order of 13 kN at runners and anchor points.

<text>Edmund Beckett, 1st Baron Grimthorpe, (12 May 1816 – 29 April 1905), known previously as Sir Edmund Beckett, 5th Baronet and Edmund Beckett Denison, was an English lawyer, mechanician, and controversialist, as well as a noted horologist and architect.

==Biography==
Beckett was born at Carlton Hall near Newark, Nottinghamshire, England, and was the eldest son of Sir Edmund Beckett, 4th Baronet, MP for the West Riding of Yorkshire.

He was educated at Doncaster Grammar School for Boys (briefly), then Eton, and went on to read mathematics at Trinity College, Cambridge, where he graduated in the 1838 Tripos with the rank of &quot;30th Wrangler&quot;.
Beckett began practising law in 1841 at Lincoln&#x27;s Inn, becoming a leader of the parliamentary bar. He was made a Queen&#x27;s Counsel in 1854, retiring in 1881. He was elected to the Royal Astronomical Society in 1866. He was elected to the presidency of the British Horological Institute in 1868, a position he accepted on the condition that he should not be asked to attend dinners. He was re-elected annually until his death. In 1877 he was appointed Chancellor and Vicar-General of the Diocese of York. He was created Baron Grimthorpe in 1886. He is sometimes known as Edmund Beckett Denison; his father had taken the additional name Denison in 1816, but the son dropped it on his father&#x27;s death in 1874. He married Fanny Catherine (23 February 1823 – 8 December 1901), daughter of John Lonsdale, 89th Bishop of Lichfield.

In 1851, he designed the mechanism for the clock of the Palace of Westminster (the Houses of Parliament in London), responsible for the chimes of Big Ben.

In 1868 he worked with W. H. Crossland to design St Chad&#x27;s Church, Far Headingley in Leeds on land given by his family.
He was also responsible throughout the 1880s and 1890s for rebuilding the west front, roof, and transept windows of St Albans Cathedral at his own expense. Although the building had been in need of repair (and indeed considerable work had already been done since 1856 under the guidance of Sir George Gilbert Scott until his death in 1878, including making the central tower safe, correcting the listing of the south side of the nave, and reconstructing the shrine of Saint Alban), popular opinion at the time held that he had changed the cathedral&#x27;s character, even inspiring the creation and temporary popularity of the verb &quot;to grimthorpe&quot;, meaning to carry out unsympathetic restorations of ancient buildings. Part of Beckett&#x27;s additions included statues of the four evangelists around the western door; the statue of St Matthew has Beckett&#x27;s face. He later turned his attentions to St Peter&#x27;s and then to St Michael&#x27;s churches, both in the same city. He lived at Batchwood Hall from where he oversaw the restoration work on the cathedral.

He died on 29 April 1905 after a fall, and is buried in the grounds of St Albans Cathedral. His obituary in the &quot;Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society&quot; noted his mastery of ecclesiastical law, his publications (ranging from &quot;Astronomy without Mathematics&quot; to &quot;Clocks, Watches, and Bells&quot; (1903) to &quot;Building, Civil and Ecclesiastical&quot;) and noted &quot;there was not a better locksmith in England.&quot;

<doc id="775003" wikidata="Q1134085" url="?curid=775003" title="Cornering the market">
<text>In finance, cornering the market consists of obtaining sufficient control of a particular stock, commodity, or other asset in an attempt to manipulate the market price.

Companies that have cornered their markets have usually done so in an attempt to gain greater leeway in their decisions; for example, they may desire to charge higher prices for their products without fears of losing too much business. The cornerer hopes to gain control of enough of the supply of the commodity to be able to set the price for it.

==Strategy and risks==
Cornering a market can be attempted through several mechanisms. The most direct strategy is to buy a large percentage of the available commodity offered for sale in some spot market and hoard it. With the advent of futures trading, a cornerer may buy a large number of futures contracts on a commodity and then sell them at a profit after inflating the price.

Although there have been many attempts to corner markets by massive purchases in everything from tin to cattle, to date very few of these attempts have ever succeeded; instead, most of these attempted corners have tended to break themselves spontaneously. Indeed, as long ago as 1923, Edwin Lefèvre wrote, &quot;very few of the great corners were profitable to the engineers of them.&quot; 

A company attempting to corner a market is vulnerable due to the size of its position, which makes it highly susceptible to market risk. By its nature, cornering a market requires a company to purchase commodities or their derivatives at artificial prices; this effectively creates a situation where other investors attempt to profit off of these machinations through arbitrage. This has a chilling effect on the cornering attempt, since these investors usually take positions opposed to the cornerer. Furthermore, if the price starts to move against the cornerer, any attempt by the cornerer to sell would likely cause the price to drop substantially, subjecting the cornerer to catastrophic risk.

In nearly all cases, the company simply runs out of money and disbands before getting close to controlling prices. In the few cases where companies have purchased a dominant position in a market, governments and exchanges have intervened. Cornering a market is often considered unethical by the general public and has highly undesirable effects on the economy.

==Historical examples==

=== Thales of Miletus (c. 6th century BC) ===
According to Aristotle in &quot;The Politics&quot; (Book I Section 1259a), Thales of Miletus once cornered the market in olive-oil presses:

Thales, so the story goes, because of his poverty was taunted with the uselessness of philosophy; but from his knowledge of astronomy he had observed while it was still winter that there was going to be a large crop of olives, so he raised a small sum of money and paid round deposits for the whole of the olive-presses in Miletus and Chios, which he hired at a low rent as nobody was running him up; and when the season arrived, there was a sudden demand for a number of presses at the same time, and by letting them out on what terms he liked he realized a large sum of money, so proving that it is easy for philosophers to be rich if they choose.

===19th century: Classic examples by Edwin Lefèvre===
Journalist Edwin Lefèvre lists several examples of corners from the mid-19th century. He distinguishes corners as the result of manipulations from corners as the result of competitive buying.

====James Fisk, Jay Gould and the Black Friday (1869)====
The 1869 Black Friday financial panic in the United States was caused by the efforts of Jay Gould and James Fisk to corner the gold market on the New York Gold Exchange. When the government gold hit the market, the premium plummeted within minutes and many investors were ruined. Fisk and Gould escaped significant financial harm.

====Lefèvre thoughts on corners of the old days====
In chapter 19 of his book, Edwin Lefèvre tries to summarize the rationale for the corners of the 19th century.
===20th century: The Northern Pacific Railway===
The corner of The Northern Pacific Railway on May 9, 1901, is a well documented case of competitive buying, resulting in a panic. The 2009 Annotated Edition of &quot;Reminiscences of a Stock Operator&quot; contains Lefèvre&#x27;s original account in chapter 3 as well as modern annotations explaining the actual locations and personalities on the page margins.

=== 1900s: The United Copper Company ===
In October of 1907, a failed attempt by F. Augustus Heinze to corner The United Copper Company led to the panic of 1907. A 50% fall in the New York Stock Exchange of the previous year was directly related to the event.

===1920s: The Stutz Motor Company===
Called &quot;a forerunner of the Livermore and Cutten operations of a few years later&quot; by historian Robert Sobel, the March 1920 corner of The Stutz Motor Company is an example of a manipulated corner ruining everyone involved, especially its originator Allan Ryan.

===1950s: The onion market===
In the late 1950s, United States onion farmers alleged that Sam Seigel and Vincent Kosuga, Chicago Mercantile Exchange traders, were attempting to corner the market on onions. Their complaints resulted in the passage of the Onion Futures Act, which banned trading in onion futures in the United States and remains in effect .

===1970s: The Hunt brothers and the silver market===
Brothers Nelson Bunker Hunt and William Herbert Hunt attempted to corner the world silver markets in the late 1970s and early 1980s, at one stage holding the rights to more than half of the world&#x27;s deliverable silver. During the Hunts&#x27; accumulation of the precious metal, silver prices rose from $11 an ounce in September 1979 to nearly $50 an ounce in January 1980. Silver prices ultimately collapsed to below $11 an ounce two months later, much of the fall occurring on a single day now known as Silver Thursday, due to changes made to exchange rules regarding the purchase of commodities on margin.

===1990s: Hamanaka and the copper market===

Rogue trader Yasuo Hamanaka, Sumitomo Corporation&#x27;s chief copper trader, attempted to corner the international copper market over a ten-year period leading up to 1996. As his scheme collapsed, Sumitomo was left with large positions in the copper market, ultimately losing US$2.6 billion. Hamanaka confessed in June 1996, and pleaded guilty to criminal charges stemming from his trading activity in 1997. A Tokyo court sentenced him to eight years in prison.

===2008: Porsche and shares in Volkswagen===
During the financial crisis of 2007–2010, Porsche cornered the market in shares of Volkswagen, which briefly saw Volkswagen become the world&#x27;s most valuable company. Porsche claimed that its actions were intended to gain control of Volkswagen rather than to manipulate the market: in this case, while cornering the market in Volkswagen shares, Porsche contracted with naked shorts—resulting in a short squeeze on them. It was ultimately unsuccessful, leading to the resignation of Porsche&#x27;s chief executive and financial director and to the merger of Porsche into Volkswagen.

One of the wealthiest men in Germany&#x27;s industry, Adolf Merckle, committed suicide after shorting Volkswagen shares.

===2010: Armajaro and the European cocoa market===
On July 17, 2010, Armajaro purchased 240,100 tonnes of cocoa, the largest single cocoa trade in 14 years.
The buyout caused cocoa prices to rise to their highest level since 1977.
The purchase was valued at £658 million and accounted for 7 percent of annual global cocoa production.

Anthony Ward, co-founder and manager of Armajaro, was dubbed &quot;Chocfinger&quot; by fellow traders for his exploits. The nickname is a reference to both the Bond villain Goldfinger and a British confection.

<doc id="775005" wikidata="Q417219" url="?curid=775005" title="Stanozolol">
<text>Stanozolol (abbrev. Stz), sold under many brand names, is a synthetic androgen and anabolic steroid (AAS) medication derived from dihydrotestosterone (DHT). It is used to treat hereditary angioedema. It was developed by American pharmaceutical company Winthrop Laboratories (Sterling Drug) in 1962, and has been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for human use, though it is no longer marketed in the United States. It is also used in veterinary medicine. Stanozolol has mostly been discontinued, and remains available in only a few countries. It is given by mouth in humans or by injection into muscle in animals.

Unlike most injectable AAS, stanozolol is not esterified and is sold as an aqueous suspension, or in oral tablet form. The drug has a high oral bioavailability, due to a C17α alkylation which allows the hormone to survive first-pass liver metabolism when ingested. It is because of this that stanozolol is also sold in tablet form.

Stanozolol is one of the AAS commonly used as performance-enhancing drugs and is banned from use in sports competition under the auspices of the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA). It is an anabolic steroid that is known to have a diuretic effect. Additionally, stanozolol has been highly restricted in US horse racing.

==Medical uses==
Stanozolol has been used with some success to treat venous insufficiency. It stimulates blood fibrinolysis and has been evaluated for the treatment of the more advanced skin changes in venous disease such as lipodermatosclerosis. Several randomized trials noted improvement in the area of lipodermatosclerosis, reduced skin thickness, and possibly faster ulcer healing rates with stanozolol. It is also being studied to treat hereditary angioedema, osteoporosis, and skeletal muscle injury.

==Non-medical uses==
Stanozolol is used for physique- and performance-enhancing purposes by competitive athletes, bodybuilders, and powerlifters.

==Side effects==
Side effects of stanozolol include virilization (masculinization), hepatotoxicity, cardiovascular disease, and hypertension.

==Pharmacology==

===Pharmacodynamics===
As an AAS, stanozolol is an agonist of the androgen receptor (AR), similarly to androgens like testosterone and DHT. Its affinity for the androgen receptor is about 22% of that of dihydrotestosterone. Stanozolol is not a substrate for 5α-reductase as it is already 5α-reduced, and so is not potentiated in so-called &quot;androgenic&quot; tissues like the skin, hair follicles, and prostate gland. This results in a greater ratio of anabolic to androgenic activity compared to testosterone. In addition, due to its 5α-reduced nature, stanozolol is non-aromatizable, and hence has no propensity for producing estrogenic effects such as gynecomastia or fluid retention. Stanozolol also does not possess any progestogenic activity of significance. Because of the presence of its 17α-methyl group, the metabolism of stanozolol is sterically hindered, resulting in it being orally active, although also hepatotoxic.

===Pharmacokinetics===
Stanozolol has high oral bioavailability, due to the presence of its C17α alkyl group and the resistance to gastrointestinal and liver metabolism that it results in. The medication has very low affinity for human serum sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG), about 5% of that of testosterone and 1% of that of DHT. Stanozolol is metabolized in the liver, ultimately becoming glucuronide and sulfate conjugates. Its biological half-life is reported to be 9 hours when taken by mouth and 24 hours when given by intramuscular injection in the form of an aqueous suspension. It is said to have a duration of action of one week or more via intramuscular injection.

==Chemistry==
Stanozolol, also known as 17α-methyl-2&#x27;&quot;H&quot;-androst-2-eno[3,2-&quot;c&quot;]pyrazol-17β-ol, is a synthetic 17α-alkylated androstane steroid and a derivative of 5α-dihydrotestosterone (DHT) with a methyl group at the C17α position and a pyrazole ring attached to the A ring of the steroid nucleus.

===Synthesis===
Various chemical syntheses of stanozolol have been published.

===Detection in body fluids===
Stanozolol is subject to extensive hepatic biotransformation by a variety of enzymatic pathways. The primary metabolites are unique to stanozolol and are detectable in the urine for up to 10 days after a single 5–10 mg oral dose. Methods for detection in urine specimens usually involve gas chromatography-mass spectrometry or liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry.

==History==
In 1962, Stanozolol was brought to market in the US by Winthrop under the tradename &quot;Winstrol&quot; and in Europe by Winthrop&#x27;s partner, Bayer, under the name &quot;Stromba&quot;.

Also in 1962, the Kefauver Harris Amendment was passed, amending the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act to require drug manufacturers to provide proof of the effectiveness of their drugs before approval. The FDA implemented its Drug Efficacy Study Implementation (DESI) program to study and regulate drugs, including stanozolol, that had been introduced prior to the amendment. The DESI program was intended to classify all pre-1962 drugs that were already on the market as effective, ineffective, or needing further study. The FDA enlisted the National Research Council of the National Academy of Sciences to evaluate publications on relevant drugs under the DESI program.

In June 1970 the FDA announced its conclusions on the effectiveness of certain AAS, including stanozolol, based on the NAS/NRC reports made under DESI. The drugs were classified as probably effective as adjunctive therapy in the treatment of senile and postmenopausal osteoporosis but only as an adjunct, and in pituitary dwarfism (with a specific caveat for dwarfism, &quot;until growth hormone is more available&quot;), and as lacking substantial evidence of effectiveness for several other indications. Specifically, the FDA found a lack of efficacy for stanozolol as &quot;an adjunct to promote body tissue-building processes and to reverse tissue-depleting processes in such conditions as malignant diseases and chronic nonmalignant diseases; debility in elderly patients, and other emaciating diseases; gastrointestinal disorders resulting in alterations of normal metabolism; use during pre-operative and postoperative periods in undernourished patients and poor-risk surgical cases due to traumatism; use in infants, children, and adolescents who do not reach an adequate weight; supportive treatment to help restore or maintain a favorable metabolic balance, as in postsurgical, postinfectious, and convalescent patients; of value in pre- operative patients who have lost tissue from a disease process or who have associated symptoms, such as anorexia; retention and utilization of calcium; surgical applications; gastrointestinal disease, malnourished adults, and chronic illness; pediatric nutritional problems; prostatic carcinoma; and endocrine deficiencies.&quot; The FDA gave Sterling six months to stop marketing stanozolol for the indications for which there was no evidence for efficacy, and one year to submit further data for the two indications for which it found probable efficacy.

In August and September 1970, Sterling submitted more data; the data was not sufficient but the FDA allowed the drug to continued to be marketed, since there was an unmet need for drugs for osteoporosis and pituitary dwarfism, but Sterling was required to submit more data.

In 1980 the FDA removed the dwarfism indication from the label for stanozolol since human growth hormone drugs had come on the market, and mandated that the label for stanozolol and other steroids say: &quot;As adjunctive therapy in senile and postmenopausal osteoporosis. AAS are without value as primary therapy but may be of value as adjunctive therapy. Equal or greater consideration should be given to diet, calcium balance, physiotherapy, and good general health promoting measures.&quot; and gave Sterling a timeline to submit further data for other indications it wanted for the drug. Sterling submitted data to the FDA intended to support the effectiveness of Winstrol for postmenopausal osteoporosis and aplastic anemia in December, 1980 and August 1983 respectively. The FDA&#x27;s Endocrinologic and Metabolic Drugs Advisory Committee considered the data submitted for osteoporosis in two meetings held 1981 and the data for aplastic anemia in 1983.

In April 1984, the FDA announced that the data was not sufficient, and withdrew the marketing authority for stanozolol for senile and postmenopausal osteoporosis and for raising hemoglobin levels in aplastic anemia.

In 1988, Sterling was acquired by Eastman Kodak for $5.1 billion and in 1994 Kodak sold the drug business of Sterling to Sanofi for $1.675 billion.

Sanofi had stanozolol manufactured in the US by Searle, which stopped making the drug in October 2002. Even with no drug in production, Sanofi sold the stanozolol business to Ovation Pharmaceuticals in 2003, along with the two other drugs. At that time, the drug had not been discontinued and was considered a treatment for hereditary angioedema. In March 2009, Lundbeck purchased Ovation

In 2010, Lundbeck withdrew stanozolol from the market in the US; as of 2014 no other company is marketing stanozolol as a pharmaceutical drug in the US but it can be obtained via a compounding pharmacy.

Pfizer had marketed stanozolol as a veterinary drug; in 2013 Pfizer spun off its veterinary business to Zoetis and in 2014 Pfizer transferred the authorizations to market injectable and tablet forms of stanozolol as a veterinary drug to Zoetis.

It is used in veterinary medicine as an adjunct in the management of wasting diseases, to stimulate the formation of red blood cells, arouse appetite, and promote weight gain, but the evidence for these uses is weak. It is used as a performance-enhancing drug in race horses. Its side effects include weight gain, water retention, and difficulty eliminating nitrogen-based waste products and it is toxic to the liver, especially in cats. Because it may promote the growth of tumors, it is contraindicated in dogs with enlarged prostates.

Stanozolol and other AAS were commonly used to treat hereditary angioedema attacks, until several drugs were brought to market specifically for treatment of that disease, the first in 2009: Cinryze, Berinert, ecallantide (Kalbitor), icatibant (Firazyr) and Ruconest. Stanozolol is still used long-term to reduce the frequency of severity of attacks.

==Society and culture==
===Generic names===
&quot;Stanozolol&quot; is the generic name of stanozolol in English, German, French, and Japanese and its , , , , , and , while &quot;stanozololum&quot; is its name in Latin, &quot;stanozololo&quot; is its name in Italian and its , and &quot;estanozolol&quot; is its name in Spanish. &quot;Androstanazole&quot;, &quot;androstanazol&quot;, &quot;stanazol&quot;, &quot;stanazolol&quot;, and &quot;estanazolol&quot; are unofficial synonyms of stanozolol. It is also known by its former developmental code name &quot;WIN-14833&quot;.

===Brand names===
Brand names under which stanozolol is or has been marketed include Anaysynth, Menabol, Neurabol Caps., Stanabolic (veterinary), Stanazol (veterinary), Stanol, Stanozolol, Stanztab, Stargate (veterinary), Stromba, Strombaject, Sungate (veterinary), Tevabolin, Winstrol, Winstrol Depot, and Winstrol-V (veterinary).

===Legal status in the United States===
In the United States, like other AAS, stanozolol is classified as a controlled substance under federal regulation; they were included as Schedule III controlled substances under the Anabolic Steroids Control Act of 1990 which was passed as part of the Crime Control Act of 1990.

===Doping in sports===
Stanozolol and other synthetic steroids were first banned by the International Olympic Committee and the International Association of Athletics Federations in 1974, after methods to detect them had been developed. There are many known cases of doping in sports with stanozolol by professional athletes. Stanozolol is especially widely used by the athletes from post-Soviet countries. As of 2015, it is banned by World Anti-Doping Agency and United States Anti-Doping Agency.

==Research==
Stanozolol has been investigated in the treatment of a number of dermatological conditions including urticaria, hereditary angioedema, Raynaud&#x27;s phenomenon, cryofibrinogenemia, and lipodermatosclerosis.

<doc id="775006" wikidata="Q5599906" url="?curid=775006" title="The Great Salad Oil Swindle">
<text>The Great Salad Oil Swindle is a book by &quot;Wall Street Journal&quot; reporter Norman C. Miller about Tino De Angelis, a New Jersey–based wholesaler and commodities trader who dealt in vegetable oil futures contracts. The book was published in 1965 by Coward McCann.

==Overview==
In 1963, De Angelis was responsible for the Salad Oil scandal, a major financial racket involving fraudulent warehouse receipts, when he attempted to corner the soybean oil market. Soybean oil is an ingredient of salad dressing and has many other uses. In the aftermath of the scandal, 51 investors were swindled out of approximately $175 million ($1.4 billion in 2018 dollars).

==Recognition==
Miller was awarded the Pulitzer Prize in 1964 for his reporting of the De Angelis scam in the &quot;Wall Street Journal&quot;, on which the book is based.

<doc id="775007" wikidata="Q2356606" url="?curid=775007" title="Great Seal of Canada">
<text>The Great Seal of Canada () is a governmental seal used for purposes of state in Canada, being set on letters patent, proclamations and commissions, both to representatives of the monarch and for the appointment of cabinet ministers, senators, and judges. Many other officials, such as officers in the Canadian Armed Forces, receive commissions affixed with the Privy Seal, not the great seal. It is not for sealing up a document as letters close. As a de facto symbol of Canada the seal is one of the oldest and most honoured instruments of the Canadian government.

==History==
The first Great Seal of Canada was carved in the United Kingdom and sent to Canada to replace a temporary seal which had been used since Confederation in 1867. On the great seal assigned to Canada in 1869, the arms of each of the original provinces—Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, Québec, and Ontario—were shown separately, two on each side of the figure of Queen Victoria seated beneath a canopy.

In view of the intended tour of Canada by George VI in 1939 as King of Canada, the federal parliament passed an act to let the Great Seal of Canada be used for functions that had previously been carried out by the king in London using the Great Seal of the United Kingdom—such as the issuing of an instrument of ratification for an international treaty—but were to be performed by the King while in Canada. This contrasted with the 1931 External Great Seal of the Irish Free State and 1934 Royal Great Seal of South Africa, which also replaced the use of the UK Great Seal on diplomatic documents, but were in each case separate from the pre-existing domestic Great Seal. The 1939 change was described by the tour&#x27;s official historian as establishing a new official procedure &quot;which asserted and recognized Canada&#x27;s equality of political status within the British Empire.&quot;

==Appearance==

Dies (seal-making devices) for old seals are destroyed whenever a new monarch takes the throne. The current great seal was designed by British-born artist Eric Aldwinckle and made at the Royal Canadian Mint when Queen Elizabeth II succeeded her father in 1952 and it went into use on 14 November 1955. The seal die is made of specially tempered steel, weighs 3.75 kilograms (8.27 pounds), and is 127 millimetres (5 inches) in diameter. The image depicts the Queen enthroned on the coronation chair and robed, holding the orb and sceptre, and the 1957 version of the Royal Arms of Canada in front. Around the perimeter is inscribed &quot;REINE DU CANADA—ELIZABETH II—QUEEN OF CANADA&quot;. Previous Great Seals of Canada were inscribed in Latin. While the governor general is the keeper of the Great Seal, the Queen&#x27;s representative places it in the protection of the Registrar General of Canada. Each of the provinces has its own unique great seal for similar purposes, which is used by the lieutenant governor of the province and kept by the provincial attorney general.

==Inscriptions on the Great Seal==

===Province of Quebec===
* George III. 

===Province of Canada===
* Victoria. 

===Canada===
* Victoria. 
* Edward VII. 
* George V. 
* George VI. 
* Elizabeth II. 

==Legal status==
Like the Great Seal of the United Kingdom in respect of the Crown in right of that country, the Great Seal of Canada is the chief seal of the Crown of Canada, and is used to show the Canadian monarch&#x27;s approval of important state documents. The sovereign acts on the advice of the government of the day.

The Canadian Great Seal is used not only for administrative purposes, but also ceremonially, when it is put into the custody of a new governor general as part of the customary swearing-in and installation procedure. It is protected under the Security of Information Act, Section 5(2)(e) stating: &quot;Every person who, without lawful authority or excuse, manufactures or sells, or has in his possession for sale, any die, seal or stamp referred to in subsection (1) is guilty of an indictable offence and liable to imprisonment for a term of not more than 14 years or by summary conviction and liable to imprisonment for a term of not more than 12 months or to a fine of not more than $2,000.&quot;

<text>Baalat Gebal (, &quot;BʿLT GBL&quot;; also romanized as Ba’alat Gebal or Baalat Gubal; literally &quot;Lady of Byblos&quot;), also known as Bēltu ša Gubla (Akkadian: dNIN &quot;ša uruGub-la&quot;) and Baaltis, was the tutelary goddess of the city of Byblos. While in the past it was often assumed her name is only an epithet, presently researchers assume that it is a proper name, meant to highlight her close connection to the corresponding city. She was identified with Hathor and later possibly with Isis by ancient Egyptians, and with Aphrodite by ancient Greeks. Philo of Byblos instead refers to her as &quot;Dione&quot;, though the reasons behind this choice remain unknown. She was the main goddess in the local pantheon of Byblos, and a temple dedicated to her, which remained in use from the third millennium BCE to the Roman period, was located in the center of this city. She was venerated by the kings of Byblos, with a large number of references to her found in letters sent by Rib-Addi as a part of the Amarna correspondence. There is also evidence that she was worshiped by Egyptians, both in Byblos and in Egypt. She is mentioned in a number of literary texts, including the so-called &quot;Letter of Hori&quot;, the writings of Philo of Byblos, and Lucian&#x27;s &quot;De Dea Syria&quot;.

==Name and identity==
The Phoenician theonym Baalat Gebal (&quot;b’lt gbl&quot;) can be translated as “Lady of Byblos”. A direct Akkadian translation, dNIN &quot;ša uruGub-la&quot;, read as Bēltu ša Gubla, occurs in the Amarna letters. Shortened variants dNIN-&quot;nu&quot; (&quot;bēletnu&quot;, “our lady”) and dNIN are also attested. The name was meant to highlight her connection to the city. It has been proposed that a male deity with a similar name, the “Lord of Byblos”, also existed, and can be identified with the figure of AN.DA.MU from the Amarna letters, but this proposal is not universally accepted. Nadav Na&#x27;aman instead suggests interpreting AN.DA.MU as a “honorific title” of Baalat Gebal herself, “the living goddess”.

In the past researchers have often attempted to prove that “Baalat Gebal” should be understood as an epithet rather than a proper name. She has been variously identified as a local form of Asherah, argued to be an appropriate tutelary goddess for a port city due to being addressed as “lady of the sea” in Ugarit, Anat (as suggested by Edward Lipiński) and especially commonly Astarte. Frank Moore Cross argued that Baalat Gebal might have been identical with Qudshu, who he identifies as an alternate name of Asherah (Elat) according to him used in Ugarit and Egypt. However, Christiane Zivie-Coche describes Qudshu as an Egyptian invention, with no forerunners in the Ancient Near East. Izak Cornelius also considers her to be a separate deity, and rejects an association between Baalat Gebal and Asherah, noting that a link to Astarte is more plausible. Evidence for the presumed identification of Baalat Gebal with Astarte is limited to three late, unprovenanced inscriptions; in one, which is bilingual, Astarte occurs in Greek and Baalat Gebal in Phoenician, which appears to indicate the former served as &quot;interpretatio graeca&quot; of the latter, while in the other two Astarte is addressed as the goddess of Byblos, though with the title &quot;rbt gbl&quot; rather than &quot;b’lt gbl&quot;. Direct evidence on the contrary comes from Philo of Byblos’ &quot;Phoenician History&quot;, where Astarte and Baaltis (Baalat Gebal) are two separate goddesses, portrayed as sisters, and only the latter is linked to Byblos.

As argued recently by (2013), it is not impossible that inhabitants of Byblos saw “Baalat Gebal” as a proper name, with no other “true name” designating the local goddess. She points out that in Phoenician inscriptions her name is left undivided, while a divider occurs between the two elements of the title &quot;mlk.gbl&quot; (“king of Byblos”), which she assumes indicates the former was understood as a proper name rather than a title like the latter. Zernecke’s approach has also been adopted by Michael J. Stahl in his study of the goddess (2021). It has been pointed out that most of the explicit evidence for the identification of Baalat Gebal and other deities is limited to Egyptian and Greek sources, which makes it possible that such texts constitute an example of &quot;interpretatio graeca&quot; and analogous phenomena. Frances Pinnock has suggested that the vagueness of her name might have resulted in foreign rulers from Egypt, and possibly also Ebla and elsewhere, being able to identify her as an aspect of their own deities. 

Due to contacts between Byblos and Egypt, Baalat Gebal came to be identified with Hathor. Egyptians referred to the latter goddess as the “Lady of Byblos” (&quot;nbt kpn&quot;), a reflection of Baalat Gebal’s name. She could also be referred to as “Lady
of Dendera who dwells in Byblos”. The oldest attestation of the connection between the two goddesses occurs in the &quot;Coffin Texts&quot;. In the relevant passage, Hathor is addressed as the “Lady of Byblos” while she is invoked as a protector of the passengers of the solar barque. This association finds parallels in instances of linking the same Egyptian goddess to various other distant areas, including Sinai, Punt, Wadi el-Hudi and Gebel el-Asr. It is possible that this phenomenon had an ideological dimension, as interpreting foreign goddess as Hathor made it possible to present payments made to local temples in areas such as Byblos and Punt, possibly made to acquire local goods, as a display of piety towards an Egyptian deity. In a text from the reign of Thutmose III, the official Minmose lists the temple of “Hathor, Lady of Byblos” among these belonging to Egyptian deities, and it is possible that the connection was reinforced by Egyptian involvement in local construction projects. No references to the connection between Baalat Gebal and Hathor postdate the New Kingdom, both due to less frequent contact with Byblos and due to the latter being partially replaced by Isis in Egyptian religion. These two Egyptian goddesses were also partially identified with each other, and there is evidence that Baalat Gebal might have been identified with Isis as well, including an inscription on a statue of Osorkon II found in Byblos, which mentions Isis, and to a reference to a connection between Isis and the city of Byblos in Plutarch&#x27;s &quot;De Iside et Osiride&quot;. Marwan Kilani notes that the inhabitants of Byblos might have attempted to accommodate the changes occurring in the religion of Egypt by identifying their goddess with Isis. Depictions of Baalat Gebal from the Achaemenid period show similarity to images of “Hathor-Isis” from Egypt, which might indicate she was specifically identified with the syncretic form of these two goddesses. She was portrayed holding an Egyptian scepter and wearing a horned crown decorated with the sun disk.

Greek authors seemingly regarded Baalat Gebal as analogous to Aphrodite. Philo of Byblos instead equates her with Dione. According to Alan I. Baumgarten, due to lack of evidence it is impossible to determine what factors guided this choice. Frank Moore Cross suggested that the identification of Baalat Gebal as Dione reflected the parallel between the names Zeus and Dione and El and Elat. This has been criticized by Baumgarten, who points out the name Elat was never used to refer to Baalat Gebal, and that even if Cross’ theory was adjusted to apply to names Baalat and Baal, it would remain impossible to prove. 

==Worship==
Baalat Gebal was the principal deity in the local pantheon of Byblos, located on the Mediterranean coast in modern Lebanon. She has been described as “the most recurrent character in the history of the city”. She was associated with commerce. A temple dedicated to her was located in the center of the settlement. It remained in use without interruption from the third millennium BCE down to the Roman period. It was the largest sanctuary in Byblos. As it is unlikely that Baalat Gebal had more than one temple in the city, the &quot;Obelisk Temple&quot; also identified during excavations might have been instead dedicated to a male figure connected to her. A number of sheet metal figurines have been discovered as a part of the temple votive offering in the temple of Baalat Gebal. Most are representations of men, either in conical hats or without, while a single one might be depiction of Anubis holding the was scepter. It is commonly assumed that they were produced locally, though it has also been proposed that they were imported from Egypt roughly between 2050 and 1800 BCE due to stylistic parallels with similar objects from Mentuhotep II’s tomb located at Deir el-Bahri.

Baalat Gebal was venerated by the kings of Byblos, possibly as early as in the early Bronze Age, though no individual rulers are identified in sources from that period. Rib-Addi, who reigned during the period documented in the Amarna letters, ended most of the messages he sent to the pharaoh with a wish for Baalat Gebal to protect the latter. Similar formulas appear in his letters to other Egyptian officials. A total of twenty seven instances have been identified. This habit which finds no parallels in the rest of the correspondence belonging to this text corpus. While wishes for wellbeing of the recipient were common, no other local ruler invoked his own local deity to bless the pharaoh. Furthermore, in a single case Rib-Addi presented Baalat Gebal as one of the deities the pharaoh owed his position to, which similarly is not otherwise attested for rulers of Levantine polities. It is not known if he used similar formulas in letters addressed to people from outside Egypt, as no such texts survive. In most cases he only invokes Baalat Gebal, though in a few instances she is paired with the Egyptian god Amun, who in all of these cases occur before her. It is not known how the letters were received, though Marwan Kilani speculates that the frequent references to Baalat Gebal presumably would not be perceived positively by Rib-Addi’s contemporary Akhenaton due to his religious policies. No direct references to this pharaoh’s attitude towards the goddess are known, but during his reign Byblos was not recognized in Egyptian sources as a religious center of particular importance, and played no role in what Kilani deems “Atonist ideology”.

In one letter Rib-Addi mentions a certain Ummaḫnu, the “maidservant” of Baalat Gebal, presumed to be her priestess. Apparently she attempted to play a role in the city’s foreign relations, which finds no parallel in the cases of any other religious personnel mentioned in the Amarna letters. This situation was accepted by the king, who tried to act as a middleman between the supposed priestess and the pharaoh, who she wanted to contact. Marwan Kilani notes that in contrast with sources from Egypt and Mesopotamia, references to female clergy are rare in texts from Bronze Age West Semitic speaking areas, and suggests that the fact that Byblos’ tutelary deity was a goddess rather than a god might be the reason behind Ummaḫnu’s relative prominence.

Multiple first millennium BCE kings of Byblos, including Abibaal, Elibaal and Shipitbaal, referred to themselves as protected by Baalat Gebal. Elibaal dedicated a stele to her, as indicated by the surviving inscription of this object, in which he addresses her as “his mistress”. Shipitbaal in own inscription asked her for a long reign. Another king of Byblos, Yehawmilk, who reigned in the fifth century BCE, similarly hoped Baalat Gebal would grant him a long life and reign.

===Egyptian reception===
There is evidence that Egyptians were involved in the cult of Baalat Gebal in Byblos. Egypt and Byblos had a long history of interactions dating back to the third millennium BCE, as recognized by local rulers such as Rib-Addi, who at one point wrote that “Byblos is not like those other cities. Byblos has been my lord the king’s loyal city from time immemorial” in a letter sent to the pharaoh. It is assumed that the temple of Baalat Gebal played a role in the political interactions between them.

An Old Kingdom relief with an Egyptian inscription referring to a monarch whose name is not preserved as the “beloved of Hathor, Lady of Byblos” has been identified during excavations of the temple of Baalat Gebal. A dedication to the same deity has also been found in the so-called Temple of the Obelisks, where it was presumably reused in the Middle Bronze Age. An inscription on a stone table from the former of the two temples mentions an endowment on her behalf made during the reign of Pepi I of the Sixth Dynasty. Later texts, dated to the reign of Thutmose III, allude to Egyptian involvement in the maintenance of her temple. The pharaoh himself mentions her in on a stela from the temple of Amun in Jebel Barkal in Nubia, which commemorates the construction of ships for a military campaign in the north from wood from the “neighborhood of the Lady of Byblos.” A reference to her might also be present in a damaged text found in the Theban tomb of one of his officials, Senneferi, which describes an expedition to Byblos. Andrés Diego Espinel notes that the Egyptian acts of devotion to Baalat Gebal might have been one of the means to secure favorable political and economic relations with local rulers, as Byblos was a major center of trade and a source of wood, oil, wine and lapis lazuli imported to Egypt. 

It is presumed that Baalat Gebal was worshiped in some capacity in Egypt as well. The translation of her name, &quot;nbt-kbn&quot;, is attested as a given name, with one of its bearers being the nurse of one of Ahmose I’s daughters. Oldest examples have been identified in texts from the Middle Kingdom. It is not known if families of any of the women named &quot;nkt-kbn&quot; originated in Byblos, or if the choice of this name was influenced by the Egyptian worship of Baalat Gebal.

==Miscellaneous attestations==
A reference to Baalat Gebal has been identified in the satirical Egyptian text known as &quot;Letter of Hori&quot;, possibly originally composed during the reign of Ramesses II, in which the eponymous figure discusses her cult center: “I will tell you of another mysterious city. Byblos is its name; what is it like? And their goddess, what is she like?” According to Marwan Kilani, is not certain if describing Byblos as “mysterious” (or alternatively: “hidden”) is an allusion to an unknown mystical or religious event, or a sarcastic figure of speech meant to highlight that the average scribe should be familiar with the city. 

Baalat Gebal is also mentioned twice in a collection of Egyptian incantations, most of them directed against snakes, from the reign of Ramesses XI (BM EA 9997 + 1030). In the sixth of the preserved texts , which describes Isis healing her son Horus, who is portrayed as a child and has been bitten by a snake, she is invoked to heal the poison alongside other goddesses, such as Nephthys and Serket. Based on a restored damaged passage she is most likely identified with Hathor in this context. 

For unknown reasons, Baalat Gebal is entirely absent from the &quot;Story of Wenamun&quot;, even though it describes a journey to Byblos. An implicit reference to her might only be present in the description of a sacrifice to the local deities. 

In the &quot;Phoenician History&quot; of Philo of Byblos, which he presents as a Greek a translation of the works of a Phoenician author, Sanchuniathon, but which modern researchers consider to be a combination of both Phoenician and Greco-Roman elements, Baalat Gebal is referred to as Dione. Ouranos sends her and her two sisters, Astarte and Rhea, to trick and defeat their brother Kronos, but the latter instead marries them, and they subsequently give birth to his children. Ouranos most likely stands for a Phoenician deity representing heaven. Rhea is not explicitly identified with any Phoenician deity, and might be the Greek goddess. Kronos is also referred to as El elsewhere in the &quot;Phoenician History&quot;, but there is no other evidence for a consort relation between Baalat Gebal and El, and the pairing of Dione and Kronos is also unusual from Greek perspective, as the goddess bearing this name was typically associated with Zeus instead. The number and names of Dione’s children are not preserved. Later on, when Kronos assigns cities to various deities, she receives Byblos as her domain. 

The temple of Baalat Gebal is mentioned in Lucian’s &quot;De Dea Syria&quot;. She is referred to as the “Byblian Aphrodite” (). Lucian states that in Roman times rites focused on Adonis took place in her temple, which might be an echo of the worship of a possible unidentified male deity related to her, who according to Marwan Kilani was associated with the Obelisk Temple in earlier periods.

<text>Stone Carpenter Gossard (born July 20, 1966) is an American musician and songwriter who serves as a guitarist for the rock band Pearl Jam. Along with Jeff Ament, Mike McCready, and Eddie Vedder, he is one of the founding members of the band.

Gossard is also known for his work prior to Pearl Jam with the Seattle-based grunge bands Green River and Mother Love Bone. Gossard was also a member of the bands Temple of the Dog and Brad. In addition to his performing career, he has been active in the music industry as a producer and the owner of a record label and recording studio. He released his first solo album &quot;Bayleaf&quot; in 2001; his second, &quot;Moonlander&quot;, followed in 2013.

Gossard was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a member of Pearl Jam in 2017.

==Biography==
===Early life===
Gossard was born in Seattle to David W. Gossard Jr. and Mary Carolyn Carpenter. His father was a lawyer and his mother worked in the Seattle city government. He has two sisters, Star Leslie Dirette and Shelly Joan Gossard. Gossard attended the Northwest Boarding School in Seattle. The first band Gossard joined was March of Crimes, a band of which future Soundgarden bassist Ben Shepherd was a member, as was novelist Jonathan Evison. Although Gossard&#x27;s time with the band was brief, it introduced him to the emerging music scene in Seattle. Gossard formed a close friendship with fellow guitarist (and future Mudhoney member) Steve Turner, who also had attended the Northwest School, and joined Turner in his band The Ducky Boys. Turner&#x27;s interest in punk rock had a significant influence on Gossard, and in turn on the ethos of the band.

===Green River===

Turner went on to form Green River with vocalist/guitarist Mark Arm, drummer Alex Vincent and bassist Jeff Ament. Gossard was asked to join Green River in order to allow Arm to concentrate exclusively on singing. By the time the band finished the recording of its debut EP, &quot;Come on Down&quot;, Turner decided to leave the group, citing his distaste with Ament and Gossard&#x27;s heavy metal leanings. He was replaced by Ament&#x27;s former Deranged Diction bandmate, Bruce Fairweather.

The band released the EP &quot;Come on Down&quot; in 1985 and followed it up with &quot;Dry As a Bone&quot; in 1987, the first non-compilation release from Sub Pop records. The band&#x27;s only full-length studio album, &quot;Rehab Doll&quot;, was released in 1988. In-fighting within the band led to the group&#x27;s break-up during the recording of &quot;Rehab Doll&quot;. A stylistic division had developed between Ament and Gossard on one side, and Arm on the other. Ament and Gossard wanted to pursue a major-label deal, while Arm wanted to remain independent, viewing the duo as being too careerist. The band achieved a considerable local reputation in Seattle and had a significant influence on the genre later known as grunge, with Green River being described as &quot;arguably the first grunge band.&quot;

===Mother Love Bone===

Following Green River&#x27;s dissolution, Gossard established Mother Love Bone in 1988 along with former Green River members Ament and Fairweather, former Malfunkshun frontman Andrew Wood, and former Ten Minute Warning and Skin Yard drummer Greg Gilmore. The band quickly worked on recording and performing locally and by late 1988 had become one of Seattle&#x27;s more promising bands. In early 1989 the band signed to PolyGram subsidiary Mercury Records. In March of that year the group issued its debut EP, &quot;Shine&quot;.

In late 1989 the group returned to the studio to record its debut studio album, &quot;Apple&quot;. It was planned for a March 1990 release. Only days before the release of &quot;Apple&quot;, however, frontman Wood, who had a long history with drug problems, overdosed on heroin. After spending a few days in the hospital in a coma, Wood died, effectively bringing Mother Love Bone to an end. &quot;Apple&quot; would see release later that year.

===Temple of the Dog===

Gossard reacquainted himself with childhood friend Mike McCready after watching McCready jam with a local band called Love Chile and being impressed with his work. Gossard had known McCready from before high school when the two would trade rock band pictures with each other. After the demise of Mother Love Bone, he asked McCready if he wanted to play music with him. After a few months of practicing together, McCready in turn encouraged Gossard to reconnect with Ament. The trio were attempting to form their own band when they were invited to be part of the Temple of the Dog project founded by Soundgarden&#x27;s Chris Cornell as a musical tribute to Wood. Cornell had been Wood&#x27;s roommate. The band&#x27;s line-up was completed by the addition of Soundgarden drummer Matt Cameron.

The band started rehearsing songs that Cornell had written on tour prior to Wood&#x27;s death, as well as reworking some existing material from demos written by Gossard and Ament. Gossard described the recording process as a &quot;non-pressure filled&quot; situation, as there were no expectations or pressure coming from the record company. This project eventually featured vocalist Eddie Vedder, who had arrived in Seattle to audition to be the singer for Ament and Gossard&#x27;s next band, which later became Pearl Jam, after being sent a tape of Gossard&#x27;s demos, recording his own lyrics and vocals over the top. Vedder sang a duet with Cornell on the song &quot;Hunger Strike&quot; and provided background vocals on several other songs. The band decided that it had enough material for an entire 
album and, in April 1991, &quot;Temple of the Dog&quot; was released through A&amp;M Records. Three of the songs on the final album were musically credited to Gossard, including the single &quot;Pushin Forward Back&quot;. Gossard asserted that he thought Wood would be &quot;blown away by the whole thing.&quot;

===Pearl Jam===

Pearl Jam was formed in 1990 by Ament, Gossard, and McCready, who then recruited Vedder and drummer Dave Krusen. The band originally took the name Mookie Blaylock, but was forced to change it when the band signed to Epic Records in 1991. After the recording sessions for &quot;Ten&quot; were completed, Krusen left Pearl Jam in May 1991. Krusen was replaced by Matt Chamberlain, who had previously played with Edie Brickell &amp; New Bohemians. After playing only a handful of shows, one of which was filmed for the &quot;Alive&quot; video, Chamberlain left to join the &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; band. As his replacement, Chamberlain suggested Dave Abbruzzese, who joined the group and played the rest of Pearl Jam&#x27;s live shows supporting &quot;Ten&quot;.

&quot;Ten&quot; broke the band into the mainstream, and became one of the best selling alternative albums of the 1990s. The band found itself amidst the sudden popularity and attention given to the Seattle music scene and the genre known as grunge. The single &quot;Jeremy&quot; received Grammy Award nominations for Best Rock Song and Best Hard Rock Performance in 1993. Pearl Jam received four awards at the 1993 MTV Video Music Awards for its music video for &quot;Jeremy&quot;, including Video of the Year and Best Group Video. &quot;Ten&quot; was ranked number 207 on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine&#x27;s list of the 500 greatest albums of all time, and &quot;Jeremy&quot; was ranked number 11 on VH1&#x27;s list of the 100 greatest songs of the &#x27;90s.

Following an intense touring schedule, the band went into the studio to record what would become its second studio album, &quot;Vs.&quot;, released in 1993. Upon its release, &quot;Vs.&quot; set at the time the record for most copies of an album sold in a week, and spent five weeks at number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. &quot;Vs.&quot; was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Rock Album in 1995. From &quot;Vs.&quot;, the song &quot;Daughter&quot; received a Grammy nomination for Best Rock Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal and the song &quot;Go&quot; received a Grammy nomination for Best Hard Rock Performance.

Feeling the pressures of success, the band decided to decrease the level of promotion for its albums, including refusing to release music videos. In 1994, the band began a much-publicized boycott of Ticketmaster, which lasted for three years and limited the band&#x27;s ability to tour in the United States. Gossard took an active role during Pearl Jam&#x27;s dispute with Ticketmaster in 1994 over prices and surcharges. Along with Ament, Gossard testified before a congressional subcommittee, arguing that Ticketmaster&#x27;s practices were anti-competitive.

Later that same year the band released its third studio album, &quot;Vitalogy&quot;, which became the band&#x27;s third straight album to reach multi-platinum status. The album received Grammy nominations for Album of the Year and Best Rock Album in 1996. &quot;Vitalogy&quot; was ranked number 492 on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine&#x27;s list of the 500 greatest albums of all time. The lead single &quot;Spin the Black Circle&quot; won a Grammy Award in 1996 for Best Hard Rock Performance. Although Abbruzzese performed on the album &quot;Vitalogy&quot;, he was fired in August 1994, four months before the album was released. The band cited political differences between Abbruzzese and the other members; for example, he disagreed with the Ticketmaster boycott. He was replaced by Jack Irons, a close friend of Vedder and the original drummer of the Red Hot Chili Peppers.

The band subsequently released &quot;No Code&quot; in 1996 and &quot;Yield&quot; in 1998. In 1998, prior to Pearl Jam&#x27;s U.S. Yield Tour, Irons left the band due to dissatisfaction with touring. Pearl Jam enlisted former Soundgarden drummer Matt Cameron as Irons&#x27; replacement on an initially temporary basis, but he soon became a permanent replacement for Irons. &quot;Do the Evolution&quot; (from &quot;Yield&quot;) received a Grammy nomination for Best Hard Rock Performance. In 1998, Pearl Jam recorded &quot;Last Kiss&quot;, a cover of a 1960s ballad made famous by J. Frank Wilson and the Cavaliers. It was released on the band&#x27;s 1998 fan club Christmas single; however, by popular demand, the cover was released to the public as a single in 1999. &quot;Last Kiss&quot; peaked at number two on the &quot;Billboard&quot; charts and became the band&#x27;s highest-charting single

In 2000, the band released its sixth studio album, &quot;Binaural&quot;, and initiated a successful and ongoing series of official bootlegs. The band released seventy-two such live albums in 2000 and 2001, and set a record for most albums to debut in the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 at the same time. &quot;Grievance&quot; (from &quot;Binaural&quot;) received a Grammy nomination for Best Hard Rock Performance. The band released its seventh studio album, &quot;Riot Act&quot;, in 2002. Pearl Jam&#x27;s contribution to the 2003 film, &quot;Big Fish&quot;, &quot;Man of the Hour&quot;, was nominated for a Golden Globe Award in 2004. The band&#x27;s eighth studio album, the eponymous &quot;Pearl Jam&quot;, was released in 2006. The band released its ninth studio album, &quot;Backspacer&quot;, in 2009 and its tenth studio album, &quot;Lightning Bolt&quot;, in 2013. Their eleventh album, &quot;Gigaton&quot;, was released in 2020. Their latest album &quot;Dark Matter&quot; released on April 19, 2024

==Other musical projects==
===Brad===
In 1992, Gossard joined with members of the fellow Seattle band Satchel to form Brad. Brad released its debut album, &quot;Shame&quot;, in 1993, and have since released &quot;Interiors&quot; (1997), &quot;Welcome to Discovery Park&quot; (2002) and the compilation album, &quot;Brad vs Satchel&quot; (2005). The band&#x27;s fourth studio album, titled &quot;Best Friends?&quot;, was released in August 2010 The fifth album, &quot;United We Stand&quot;, was released on April 24, 2012.

===&quot;Mirror Ball&quot;===

Gossard performed with other members of Pearl Jam on Neil Young&#x27;s 1995 album, &quot;Mirror Ball&quot;, and subsequently took part in an eleven-date tour in Europe as part of Young&#x27;s backing band. This tour proved very successful with Young&#x27;s manager Elliot Roberts calling it &quot;One of the greatest tours we ever had in our whole lives.&quot;

===&quot;Bayleaf&quot;===

On September 11, 2001, Gossard became the first member of Pearl Jam to go solo, releasing his first solo album, &quot;Bayleaf&quot;, through 
Sony Music Entertainment. The album features ten songs written over a span of four to five years. On &quot;Bayleaf&quot;, Gossard showed himself as being a talented multi-instrumentalist, contributing drums and piano work, as well as vocals, guitar and bass. The album&#x27;s songs feature a mellow sound influenced by Frank Black, Rufus Wainwright, and The Rolling Stones. Greg Prato of Allmusic said, &quot;While not as strong as his output with Brad, &quot;Bayleaf&quot; still has its moments.&quot;

===&quot;Moonlander&quot;===
Gossard released a follow-up to &quot;Bayleaf&quot; entitled &quot;Moonlander&quot;. Several songs have been made available as digital downloads via Pearl Jam&#x27;s official website in the weeks since September 17, 2008, each for US$0.99. The songs feature a sound influenced by folk music and country music, particularly from singer-songwriter Hank Williams. The tracks &quot;Both Live&quot;, &quot;Your Flames&quot;, and &quot;Beyond 
Measure&quot; feature NW based musicians Hans Teuber, Pete Droge, Regan Hagar, Ari Joshua, and others.

===Painted Shield===
Unable to tour with Pearl Jam because of the COVID-19 pandemic, Gossard set to work on finishing the debut album of Painted Shield, his side project with singer-songwriter Mason Jennings which they have been working on since 2014. The album also features Josh Freese and Matt Chamberlain on drums, Brittany Davis on keyboard, and additional guitar contributions by Mike McCready. The album&#x27;s release was originally scheduled for November 27, 2020 but pandemic-related production delays pushed the release to March 19, 2021.

===Record label and studio owner===
Gossard formed the record label Loosegroove Records with fellow Brad member Regan Hagar as a subsidiary of Sony in 1994, becoming independent 
in 1996. Loosegroove signed many up and coming artists from various musical genres, especially rock and hip hop. Significantly, Gossard signed Queens of the Stone Age to Loosegroove, releasing the band&#x27;s debut album, &quot;Queens of the Stone Age&quot;, in 1998. Loosegroove Records closed in 2000. In 2020, Gossard and Hagar resurrected Loosegroove and released an album by Gossard&#x27;s side project Painted Shield, as well as the album &quot;1982&quot; by Duff McKagen and Greg Gilmore&#x27;s teenage punk band The Living.

As a producer, Gossard has worked with a variety of artists including many on his own record label. His most notable production roles have been for Satchel, Green Apple Quick Step, Weapon of Choice and Critters Buggin. During his time as 
owner of Loosegroove Records, Gossard opened his own recording studio, Studio Litho, in Seattle. Most of Gossard&#x27;s production work was based in this studio, which still operates today, with Gossard as the owner. Many high-profile artists have recorded in Studio Litho, including Soundgarden, Screaming Trees, Dave Matthews Band, and Deftones, as well as both Brad and Pearl Jam.

==Other work==
Gossard had a brief acting cameo in the 1992 movie, &quot;Singles&quot;, along with Jeff Ament and Eddie Vedder of Pearl Jam. He appeared as 
himself, playing guitar in lead actor Matt Dillon&#x27;s backing band, Citizen Dick.

Gossard has been active in environmental pursuits, and has been an advocate of Pearl Jam&#x27;s carbon neutral policy, offsetting the band&#x27;s environmental impact. He has also extended his conservationist ideals and serves as a member of the board of directors at the Wild Salmon 
Center, an international conservation organization based in Portland, Oregon.

As an artist and painter, Gossard&#x27;s work can be found on many Pearl Jam releases, especially material distributed through Pearl Jam&#x27;s fan club.

==Musical style and influences==

Gossard is known for his hard rhythm style of playing, and his sense of beat and groove. Gossard has cited Jimmy Page and Led Zeppelin as a major influence on his style and rhythmic approach on guitar. Gossard&#x27;s main instrument is a Gibson Les Paul equipped with a Bigsby vibrato system. He once said of himself: &quot;I like rhythmic things that butt up against each other in a cool kind of way.&quot; Vedder has been quoted as saying that it is extremely difficult to collaborate with Gossard, as he outright refuses to work on anything remotely like anything he&#x27;s done before. When the band started, Gossard and McCready were clearly designated as rhythm and lead guitarists, respectively. The dynamic began to change when Vedder started to play more rhythm guitar during the &quot;Vitalogy&quot; era. McCready said in 2006, &quot;Even though there are three guitars, I think there&#x27;s maybe more room now. Stone will pull back and play a two-note line and Ed will do a power chord thing, and I fit into all that.&quot;

As a songwriter, the formation of Pearl Jam led to Gossard&#x27;s music becoming the basis for many of the band&#x27;s early songs. Eight of the eleven tracks on Pearl Jam&#x27;s debut album, &quot;Ten&quot;, were musically written or co-written by Gossard, including hits &quot;Alive&quot;, &quot;Even Flow&quot;, and &quot;Black&quot;. He has since made less of a solo contribution to the band&#x27;s work, instead becoming part of the collaborative efforts; however, he was credited as being behind the relatively more recent hits &quot;Do the Evolution&quot; and &quot;Life Wasted&quot; (from &quot;Pearl Jam&quot;). His songwriting contributions to Pearl Jam have not been limited to music with Gossard writing lyrics on the &quot;Yield&quot; song &quot;All Those Yesterdays&quot;; &quot;Strangest Tribe&quot; (from the 1999 fan club Christmas single); the &quot;Binaural&quot; songs &quot;Thin Air&quot;, &quot;Of the Girl&quot;, and &quot;Rival&quot;; and the &quot;Lost Dogs&quot; songs &quot;Don&#x27;t Gimme No Lip&quot; and &quot;Fatal&quot;. As well as guitar contributions, Gossard has also played mellotron, bass guitar and resonator guitar as well as often providing backing vocals. He was even given lead vocal duties for two of the Pearl Jam songs he had written both musically and lyrically: &quot;Mankind&quot; and &quot;Don&#x27;t Gimme No Lip&quot;.

==Recognition==
In a review of Pearl Jam&#x27;s 2006 self-titled album, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; editor David Fricke mentioned that both Gossard and Pearl Jam lead guitarist Mike McCready were erroneously excluded from the publication&#x27;s 2003 feature &quot;The 100 Greatest Guitarists of All Time&quot;. In February 2007, Gossard and McCready were included together by &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; in its list of &quot;The Top 20 New Guitar Gods&quot; under the title of &quot;four-armed monster.&quot; In 2023, McCready and Gossard were both included in &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;&#x27;s &quot;The 250 Greatest Guitarists of All Time&quot; list at #124. 

==Personal life==

Gossard is also an avid reader and has cited Haruki Murakami as his favorite author.

Gossard was married to Elizabeth &quot;Liz&quot; Weber from March 6, 2007 to May 25, 2011. They had one daughter together, Vivian Sparks Gossard, born in 2007. On October 1, 2011, Gossard married Vivien Wang. Gossard and Wang have three daughters, Marlowe, Faye and Gwinny.

<text>The 6th World Championships in Athletics, under the auspices of the International Amateur Athletic Federation, were held at the Olympic Stadium, Athens, Greece between 1 and 10 August 1997. In this event participated 1882 athletes from 198 participant nations. Despite several attempts to sabotage, Athens used the successful organization of the World Championships to prove their capacity during the next IOC Session held the following month in Lausanne as a triumph and key event 
during the final stretch of the process to choose the city who hosted 2004 Summer Olympics. The success of the event showed the Greece abilities and readiness to organize large-scale, international sporting events.

It was the first edition to award wild cards to defending champions even if they did not qualify for their national team. This allowed four athletes from the same country to compete in an individual event in some cases.

<text>A service-level agreement (SLA) is an agreement between a service provider and a customer. Particular aspects of the service – quality, availability, responsibilities – are agreed between the service provider and the service user.
The most common component of an SLA is that the services should be provided to the customer as agreed upon in the contract. As an example, Internet service providers and telcos will commonly include service level agreements within the terms of their contracts with customers to define the level(s) of service being sold in plain language terms. In this case, the SLA will typically have a technical definition of &quot;mean time between failures&quot; (MTBF), &quot;mean time to repair&quot; or &quot;mean time to recovery&quot; (MTTR); identifying which party is responsible for reporting faults or paying fees; responsibility for various data rates; throughput; jitter; or similar measurable details.

==Overview==
A service-level agreement is an agreement between two or more parties, where one is the customer and the others are service providers. This can be a legally binding formal or an informal &quot;contract&quot; (for example, internal department relationships). The agreement may involve separate organizations or different teams within one organization. Contracts between the service provider and other third parties are often (incorrectly) called SLAs – because the level of service has been set by the (principal) customer, there can be no &quot;agreement&quot; between third parties; these agreements are simply &quot;contracts.&quot; Operational-level agreements or OLAs, however, may be used by internal groups to support SLAs. If some aspect of service has not been agreed upon with the customer, it is not an &quot;SLA&quot;.

SLAs commonly include many components, from a definition of services to the termination of agreement. To ensure that SLAs are consistently met, these agreements are often designed with specific lines of and the parties involved are required to meet regularly to create an open forum for communication. Rewards and penalties applying to the provider are often specified. Most SLAs also leave room for a periodic (annual) revisitation to make changes.

Since the late 1980s SLAs have been used by fixed-line telecom operators. SLAs are so widely used these days that larger organizations have many different SLAs existing within the company itself. Two different units in an organization script an SLA with one unit being the customer and another being the service provider. This practice helps to maintain the same quality of service amongst different units in the organization and also across multiple locations of the organization. This internal scripting of SLA also helps to compare the quality of service between an in-house department and an external service provider.

The output received by the customer as a result of the service provided is the main focus of the service level agreement.

Service level agreements are also defined at different levels:
* Customer-based SLA: An agreement with an individual customer group, covering all the services they use. For example, an SLA between a supplier (IT service provider) and the finance department of a large organization for the services such as finance system, payroll system, billing system, procurement/purchase system, etc.
* Service-based SLA: An agreement for all customers using the services being delivered by the service provider. For example:
** A mobile service provider offers a routine service to all the customers and offers certain maintenance as a part of an offer with the universal charging.
** An email system for the entire organization. There are chances of difficulties arising in this type of SLA as level of the services being offered may vary for different customers (for example, head office staff may use high-speed LAN connections while local offices may have to use a lower speed leased line).
* Multilevel SLA: The SLA is split into the different levels, each addressing different set of customers for the same services, in the same SLA.
** Corporate-level SLA: Covering all the generic service level management (often abbreviated as SLM) issues appropriate to every customer throughout the organization. These issues are likely to be less volatile and so updates (SLA reviews) are less frequently required.
** Customer-level SLA: covering all SLM issues relevant to the particular customer group, regardless of the services being used.
** Service-level SLA: covering all SLM issue relevant to the specific services, in relation to this specific customer group.

== Components ==
A well-defined and typical SLA will contain the following components:
* Type of service to be provided: It specifies the type of service and any additional details of the type of service to be provided. In the case of an IP network connectivity, the type of service will describe functions such as operation and maintenance of networking equipment, connection bandwidth to be provided, etc.
* The service&#x27;s desired performance level, especially its reliability and responsiveness: A reliable service will be the one that suffers minimum disruption in a specific amount of time and is available at almost all times. Service with good responsiveness will perform the desired action promptly after the customer requests it.
* Monitoring process and service level reporting: This component describes how the performance levels are supervised and monitored. This process involves gathering different types of statistics, how frequently these statistics will be collected and how they will be accessed by the customers.
* The steps for reporting issues with the service: This component will specify the contact details to report the problem and the order in which details about the issue have to be reported. The contract will also include a time range in which the problem will be looked into and when the issue will be resolved.
* Response and issue resolution time frame: The response time frame is the period by which the service provider will start the investigation of the issue. Issue resolution time frame is the period by which the current service issue will be resolved and fixed.
* Repercussions for the service provider not meeting its commitment: If the provider is not able to meet the requirements as stated in SLA then the service provider will have to face consequences. These consequences may include the customer&#x27;s right to terminate the contract or ask for a refund for losses incurred by the customer due to failure of service.

==Common metrics==
A service-level agreement can track multiple performance metrics. In this context, these metrics are called service level indicators (SLIs). The target value of a given SLI is called a service-level objective (SLO).

In IT-service management, a common case is a call center or service desk. SLAs in such cases usually refer to the following SLIs:
* Abandonment Rate: Percentage of calls abandoned while waiting to be answered. A corresponding SLO may be: the abandonment rate of all the calls over the last 30 days should be &lt; 30%.
* ASA (Average Speed to Answer): Average time (usually in seconds) it takes for a call to be answered by the service desk. A corresponding SLO may be: the ASA of all the calls over the last 30 days should be &lt; 20 seconds.
* TSF (Time Service Factor): Percentage of calls answered within a definite timeframe, e.g., 80% in 20 seconds. A corresponding SLO may be: &gt;90% of the calls over the last 30 days should be answered within 20 seconds.
* FCR (First-Call Resolution): A metric that measures a contact center&#x27;s ability for its agents to resolve a customer&#x27;s inquiry or problem on the first call or contact. A corresponding SLO may be: the FCR of all cases over the last 30 days should be &gt; 75%.
* TAT (Turn-Around Time): Time taken to complete a certain task.
* TRT (total resolution time): Total time taken to complete a certain task.
* MTTR (Mean Time To Recover): Time taken to recover after an outage of service.

Uptime is also a common metric, often used for data services such as shared hosting, virtual private servers and dedicated servers. Common agreements include percentage of network uptime, power uptime, number of scheduled maintenance windows, etc.

Many SLAs track to the ITIL specifications when applied to IT services.

==Specific examples==

===Backbone Internet providers===
It is not uncommon for an internet backbone service provider (or network service provider) to explicitly state its SLA on its website. The U.S. Telecommunications Act of 1996 does not expressly mandate that companies have SLAs, but it does provide a framework for firms to do so in Sections 251 and 252. Section 252(c)(1) for example (&quot;Duty to Negotiate&quot;) requires Incumbent local exchange carriers (ILECs) to negotiate in good faith about matters such as resale and access to rights of way.

New emerging technologies such as 5G bring new complexities to the network operators. With more stringent SLAs and customer expectations, problem resolutions must be prioritized based on impacted subscribers.

===5G slicing===
With the introduction of 5G network slicing, the need of having a 360º view of the 5G slices becomes imperative to deliver premium SLAs and monetize service faster.

===Fixed networks===
For fixed networks subscribers, service modeling appears to be one of the most suitable ways to effectively monitor SLA&#x27;s and ensure they are met.

===WSLA===
A web service level agreement (WSLA) is a standard for service level agreement compliance monitoring of web services. It allows authors to specify the performance metrics associated with a web service application, desired performance targets, and actions that should be performed when performance is not met.

WSLA Language Specification, version 1.0 was published by IBM in 2001.

===Cloud computing===
The underlying benefit of cloud computing is shared resources, which are supported by the underlying nature of a shared infrastructure environment. Thus, SLAs span across the cloud and are offered by service providers as a service-based agreements rather than a customer-based agreements. Measuring, monitoring and reporting on cloud performance is based on the end UX or their ability to consume resources. The downside of cloud computing relative to SLAs is the difficulty in determining the root cause of service interruptions due to the complex nature of the environment.

As applications are moved from dedicated hardware into the cloud, they need to achieve the same even more demanding levels of service than classical installations. SLAs for cloud services focus on characteristics of the data center and more recently include characteristics of the network (see carrier cloud) to support end-to-end SLAs.

Any SLA management strategy considers two well-differentiated phases: negotiating the contract and monitoring its fulfillment in real-time. Thus, SLA management encompasses the SLA contract definition: the basic schema with the QoS parameters; SLA negotiation; SLA monitoring; SLA violation detection; and SLA enforcement—according to defined policies.

The main point is to build a new layer upon the grid, cloud, or SOA middleware able to create a negotiation mechanism between the providers and consumers of services. An example is the EU–funded Framework 7 research project, SLA@SOI, which is researching aspects of multi-level, multi-provider SLAs within service-oriented infrastructure and cloud computing, while another EU-funded project, VISION Cloud, has provided results concerning content-oriented SLAs.

FP7 IRMOS also investigated aspects of translating application-level SLA terms to resource-based attributes to bridge the gap between client-side expectations and cloud-provider resource-management mechanisms. A summary of the results of various research projects in the area of SLAs (ranging from specifications to monitoring, management and enforcement) has been provided by the European Commission.

===Outsourcing===
Outsourcing involves the transfer of responsibility from an organization to a supplier. This new arrangement is managed through a contract that may include one or more SLAs. The contract may involve financial penalties and the right to terminate if any of the SLA metrics are consistently missed. The setting, tracking and managing SLAs is an important part of the outsourcing relationship management (ORM) discipline. Specific SLAs are typically negotiated upfront as part of the outsourcing contract and used as one of the primary tools of outsourcing governance.

In software development, specific SLAs can apply to application outsourcing contracts in line with standards in software quality, as well as recommendations provided by neutral organizations like CISQ, which has published numerous papers on the topic (such as &quot;Using Software Measurement in SLAs&quot;) that are available in to the public.

<doc id="775026" wikidata="Q1242" url="?curid=775026" title="Luigi Einaudi">
<text>Luigi Numa Lorenzo Einaudi (; 24 March 1874 – 30 October 1961) was an Italian politician, economist and banker who served as President of Italy from 1948 to 1955 and is considered one of the founding fathers of the Italian Republic.

==Early life==
Einaudi was born to Lorenzo and Placida Fracchia in Carrù, in the province of Cuneo, Piedmont. In Turin he attended Liceo classico Cavour and completed his university studies; in the same years he became acquainted with socialist ideas and collaborated with the magazine &quot;Critica sociale&quot;, directed by the socialist leader Filippo Turati. In 1895, after overcoming financial difficulties, he graduated in jurisprudence, and was later appointed as a professor in the University of Turin, the Polytechnic University of Turin and the Bocconi University of Milan.

As an economist, Einaudi belonged to the classical school of economics in addition to Pietro Campilli, Epicarmo Corbino and Gustavo Del Vecchio.

==Early political life==

From the early 20th century, Einaudi moved increasingly towards a more conservative stance. In 1919 he was named Senator of the Kingdom of Italy. He also worked as a journalist for important Italian newspapers such as &quot;La Stampa&quot; and &quot;Il Corriere della Sera&quot;, as well as being financial correspondent for &quot;The Economist&quot;. In 1925, he signed the Anti-Fascist Intellectuals Manifesto. As an anti-fascist, he stopped working for Italian newspapers from 1926, under the Fascist regime, resuming his professional relationship with the &quot;Corriere della Sera&quot; after the fall of the regime in 1943. After the Armistice (8 September 1943) he fled to Switzerland, returning to Italy in 1944. In Switzerland, Einaudi taught economics at the Geneva Graduate Institute.

Einaudi was Governor of the Bank of Italy from 5 January 1945 until 11 May 1948, and was also a founding member of the Consulta Nazionale which opened the way to the new Parliament of the Italian Republic after World War II. Later he was Minister of Finances, Treasury and Balance, as well as Vice-Premier, in 1947–48. He was also a member of the neo-liberal think tank the Mont Pelerin Society.

Einaudi was elected an International Honorary Member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1935 and an International Member of the American Philosophical Society in 1947.

==President (1948–1955)==

On 11 May 1948, he was elected the second President of the Italian Republic. At the end of the seven-year term of office in 1955, he became a Life Senator. Einaudi was a member of numerous cultural, economic and university institutions. 

A staunch liberal in the European, libertarian sense (he invented the Italian term &quot;liberismo&quot; to mean economic liberalism, arguing with Benedetto Croce), he was a supporter of the idea of European Federalism.

Einaudi personally managed the activities of his farm near Dogliani, which produced Nebbiolo wine, and he boasted to be using the most advanced agricultural developments. In 1950, the monarchist satirical magazine &quot;Candido&quot; published a cartoon in which Einaudi was at the Quirinal Palace, surrounded by a presidential guard of honour (the &quot;corazzieri&quot;) of giant bottles of Nebbiolo wine, each labelled with the institutional logo. The cartoon was judged a lèse-majesté by a court of the time, and Giovannino Guareschi, the director of the magazine, was held responsible and sentenced.

==Personal life ==
Einaudi married Countess Ida Pellegrini (1885-1968) on 19 December 1903. Pellegrini was born in Pescantina in 1885 into a family of the Veronese aristocracy, as she was the daughter of Count Giulio Pellegrini. She attended the Regia School of Commerce in Turin, where she met her future husband, who was her professor at the time. Their son Giulio became a prominent Italian publisher, and their grandson Ludovico is a neo-Classical musician. Their son Roberto, a mechanical engineer, continued to cultivate his father&#x27;s beloved winery. 

Their son Mario was a Cornell University professor and active anti-fascist. The Mario Einaudi Center for International Studies is named after him. Additionally, Mario founded the Fondazione Luigi Einaudi in Turin in honour of his father.

The Einaudi Institute for Economics and Finance (EIEF), a research centre of the Bank of Italy, is named after Luigi Einaudi.

Einaudi died in Rome on 30 October 1961 at the age of 87.

<doc id="775029" wikidata="Q5392782" url="?curid=775029" title="Ernest Beckett, 2nd Baron Grimthorpe">
<text>Ernest William Beckett, 2nd Baron Grimthorpe (born Ernest William Beckett-Denison; 25 November 1856 – 9 May 1917), was a British banker and Conservative politician who sat in the House of Commons from 1885 until 1905 when he inherited the Grimthorpe peerage.

== Early life ==
Beckett was the eldest son of William Beckett, younger son of Sir Edmund Beckett, 4th Baronet, and Hon. Helen Duncombe, daughter of William Duncombe, 2nd Baron Feversham. He was the nephew of Edmund Beckett, 1st Baron Grimthorpe, and great nephew of Sir John Beckett, 2nd Baronet.

Beckett was educated at Eton College and Trinity College, Cambridge, though he failed to complete his first year at university and dropped out to travel abroad. He later became a partner in the banking firm of Beckett &amp; Co, of Leeds, owned by his father.

== Career ==

He was a major in the Yorkshire Hussars Yeomanry Cavalry, was commissioned as an Assistant Adjutant general in the Imperial Yeomanry on 28 February 1900, during the Second Boer War, and returned to the Yorkshire Hussars when he resigned from active duty in July 1902.

In 1885, Beckett was elected Member of Parliament for Whitby, a seat he held until 1905, though he is rarely mentioned in Hansard. In 1886, he resumed the name Beckett in place of Denison. In 1905, he succeeded his uncle Lord Grimthorpe as 2nd Baron according to a special remainder in the letters patent, as well as in the family baronetcy. However, he squandered much of his inherited family wealth and in 1905 he was also sacked as a senior partner in the family bank by his two brothers because of his expensive tastes and personal debts. He had once commissioned a bronze bust of his then fiancée Eve Fairfax from the famous sculptor Auguste Rodin.

In a 2010 biographical study, Michael Holroyd described Beckett as &#x27;a man of swiftly changing enthusiasms ... a dilettante, philanderer, gambler and opportunist. He changed his career, his interests and his mistresses quite regularly.&#x27;

=== Italy ===
In 1904, Beckett bought a ruined farmhouse outside Ravello, on the Amalfi Coast in southern Italy. He transformed it into a fortified palace with towers, battlements and a mixture of Arabic, Venetian and Gothic details, and called it Villa Cimbrone. Between the house and the cliff edge, he built a garden, high above the Gulf of Salerno. The garden is an eccentric mixture of formal, English rose beds, Moorish tea houses, picturesque grottoes and classical temples. Today the house is a luxurious hotel, and the garden is open to the public.

== Personal life ==
On 4 October 1883, Ernest married an American, Lucy Tracy Lee, the only child of William Pray Lee and Lucy Eldredge Tracy when he was 26 and she was 18. Lucy died on 9 May 1891, six days after their son&#x27;s birth. They had three children:

* Lucy Catherine Beckett (born 1884), who married Count Otto Czernin von und zu Chudenitz, the Austro-Hungarian Minister to Bulgaria, in 1903. They divorced in 1920 and she remarried to Captain Oliver Harry Frost, son of Robert Frost (not the poet), in 1926 (divorced 1941).
* Helen Muriel Beckett (1886–1916)
* Ralph William Ernest Beckett (1891–1963).

Beckett is also believed to have been the father of Violet Trefusis (1894–1972), whose mother, Alice Keppel was a mistress of King Edward VII. Today, Violet is mainly remembered for her lengthy affair with the poet Vita Sackville-West, which the two women continued after their respective marriages.

He also fathered a son, Lancelot Ernest Cecil, in 1895 by the Johannesburg socialite and hostess José Brink Dale Lace, married to mining magnate, John Dale Lace. In 1901, Ernest became engaged to Eve Fairfax, but the engagement was broken a few years later. During this time, he commissioned a bust of Eve from sculptor Auguste Rodin, which was the first of several Rodin made using Eve as a model. Rodin and Eve became close friends during the sittings for these busts.

Lord Grimthorpe died in April 1917, aged 60, at a sanatorium in Banchory, Aberdeenshire. He was succeeded in the baronetcy and barony by his son, Ralph Beckett. Lord Grimthorpe&#x27;s younger brother, Gervase Beckett, also sat as a Conservative Member of Parliament and was created a baronet in 1921 (see Beckett baronets). His ashes are interred in the gardens of his beloved Villa Cimbrone.

=== Descendants ===
His only son was the father of Christopher John Beckett, who became the 4th Baron Grimthorpe upon Ralph&#x27;s death in 1963. Another grandson, by his daughter Lucy, Manfred Beckett Czernin (1913–1962) was a distinguished Royal Air Force pilot and Special Operations Executive operative.

== Legacy ==
In Leeds, Beckett Park is named after Lord Grimthorpe.

In 2013, it was announced that the Board of Governors at Leeds Metropolitan University had applied to the privy council to change their name to Leeds Beckett University, named after the location of the university&#x27;s founding colleges, Beckett Park.

<text>Julius Bernhard Friedrich Adolph Wilbrand (22 August 1839 – 22 June 1906) was a German chemist who discovered trinitrotoluene, more commonly known as TNT. 

He was born in Gießen, Germay to Albertine Knapp and Franz Joseph Julius Wilbrand, a forensic physician. His brother, Hermann Wilbrand, was an ophthalmologist. 

In 1863, Wilbrand discovered TNT while experimenting with new solutions for yellow dye. He obtained trinitrotoluene through the nitration of toluene. The compound&#x27;s use as an explosive was developed later.

<doc id="775050" wikidata="Q2626848" url="?curid=775050" title="Belaying">
<text>In climbing and mountaineering, belaying comprises techniques used to create friction within a climbing protection system, particularly on a climbing rope, so that a falling climber does not fall very far. A climbing partner typically applies tension at the other end of the rope whenever the climber is not moving, and removes the tension from the rope whenever the climber needs more rope to continue climbing. The belay is the place where the belayer is anchored, which is typically on the ground, or on ledge (where it is also called a belay station) but may also be a hanging belay where the belayer themself is suspended from an anchor in the rock on a multi-pitch climb.

== Description ==

Belaying is a critical part of climbing safety. Correct belaying methods allow a belayer to hold the entire weight of the climber with relatively little force and easily arrest falls.

In its simplest form, a belay consists of a rope that runs from a climber to another person (the belayer) who can stop the climber&#x27;s fall. In the modern day, most climbers use a variety of gear to belay, notably harnesses and belay devices. Thus, in a typical modern climbing setup, one end of the rope is fixed to the harness of the climber, most often by a figure-eight knot. The rope then passes through some form of climbing protection. Protection may come in the form of fixed protection, such as permanent pitons or bolts, or in the form of removable protection, such as nuts, hexes, and spring-loaded camming devices.

The other end of the rope is attached to the belayer, who remains lower than the climber. The belayer wears a harness to which a belay device is attached. The belay device acts as a friction brake, and allows the belayer to easily vary the amount of friction on the rope by altering the rope&#x27;s position. In one position, the rope runs freely through the belay device. In another position, it can be held without the rope sliding through the device because of the friction on the rope. This is called &quot;locking off&quot; the rope.

While the rope is locked off, the climber&#x27;s fall should be arrested and they will be left suspended, but safe, somewhere below the last piece of protection. Generally, the climber will not fall any farther than the length between them and their last piece of protection, plus the length of the rope between them and their last piece of protection. That is, if a climber climbs three feet higher than the last piece of protection in the rock, and then falls, the climber will fall six feet in total: three to the protection, and three below that. A dynamic rope is often used so that the climber is not brought to a sudden jarring stop.

After a climber falls, the belayer can gently lower the climber to a safe point where climbing can be resumed. When a climber is finished climbing, belayers can lower climbers to the ground safely.

== Belayer responsibilities ==
The belayer should keep the rope locked off in the belay device whenever the climber is not moving. As the climber moves on the climb, the belayer must make sure that the climber has the right amount of rope by paying out or pulling in excess rope. If the climber falls, they free-fall the distance of the slack or unprotected rope before the friction applied by the belayer starts to slow their descent. Too much slack on the rope increases the distance of a possible fall, but too little slack on the rope may cause the climber to &quot;whip&quot; or swing into the rock at a high velocity, possibly injuring themselves. It is important for the belayer to closely monitor the climber&#x27;s situation, as the belayer&#x27;s role is crucial to the climber&#x27;s safety.

When belaying on overhanging bolted routes, particularly indoors, belayers often stand well back from the rock so that they can watch the climber more easily. However, when belaying a lead climber who is using traditional protection, can be very dangerous. The belayer should stand near to the bottom of the route in order to decrease the angle of the rope through the first piece of protection. This, in turn, decreases the force pulling it up and out of the rock if the leader falls. Standing too far away from the rock can result in protection &quot;unzipping&quot;, with the lowest piece being pulled away from the rock, followed by the next, until all of the protection may potentially be pulled out. Standing too far away from the bottom of the climb also means that if the leader falls, the belayer experiences a sudden pull inwards towards the rock and may be pulled off their feet or into the rock.

== Communication ==

Communication is also extremely important in belaying. Climbers should wait for verbal confirmation from the belayer that they are ready to begin.

=== US terminology ===
A climber is said to be &quot;on belay&quot; when they are correctly attached to the rope and the rope is correctly attached to the belayer by an appropriate belay method.
Commonly-used commands in US climbing communities are:
At times, it may be impossible for climbing partners to hear one another, as in bad weather, by the sea, or near a busy road. Silent belay communication is possible by tugging the rope. These are not standardized and should be communicated between the belayer and the climber prior to the climb. Walkie-talkies can be used in areas where communication is limited.

=== UK terminology ===
When the climber is tied onto the rope and is ready to climb &quot;Ready to climb&quot;

When the belayer has attached the rope to the belay device and is ready to belay &quot;Climb when ready&quot; (or in recent years, &quot;On belay&quot; or &quot;Belay ready&quot;)

When the climber is about to start climbing, &quot;Climbing&quot;

When the belayer is belaying, &quot;OK&quot;

When the slack rope is taken in by the belayer and it becomes tight and therefore the belayer doesn&#x27;t need to take the rope in any more the climber says &quot;That&#x27;s me&quot;

During the climb, the climber may ask the belayer for &quot;Slack&quot;, or to take in the rope &quot;Take in&quot; (the command &quot;Take in slack&quot; is never used as it could be misinterpreted)

If the climber is about to fall and needs the belayer to know &amp; take in the rope, they may say &quot;Tight&quot; for a tight rope or &quot;Take In&quot; to take the rope in.

When the climber is in a safe position independent of the belay &quot;Safe&quot; or &quot;I&#x27;m safe&quot;.

When the belayer has taken the climber off the belay &quot;Off belay&quot;

Warning shouts for falling objects, &quot;Rope!&quot;; when throwing a rope off the edge &quot;Rock!&quot;; when a rock has been dislodged and is falling.

== Anchoring ==
When top rope belaying for a significantly heavier partner, it is sometimes recommended that the belayer anchor themselves to the ground. The anchor point does not prevent a fall, but prevents the belayer from being pulled upwards during a fall. This is normally not used when lead belaying.

To set up this anchor the belayer should place a piece of directional protection (i.e., a nut or cam) into a crack below their body, or tie themselves by the belay loop to a rock or tree. The anchor arrests any upward force produced during a fall thus preventing the belayer from &quot;taking off&quot;. Unlike belays set up at the top of a climb, it is not usually necessary for belayers at the bottom to have more than one point of protection as long as the single piece is sturdy and safe – &quot;bomber&quot; in climber jargon.

===Hanging belay===
During multipitch climbs it is sometimes necessary to belay while sitting in a harness and anchored to the wall. In this case rope management becomes more important, and the anchor is constructed in the traditional manner.

== Belay methods ==

Climbers now almost exclusively use a belay device to achieve controllable rope friction. Before the invention of these devices, climbers used other belay methods, which are still useful in emergencies.

The person climbing is said to be on belay when one of these belaying methods is used.

===Belay devices===
A belay device is a piece of climbing equipment that improves belay safety for the climber by allowing the belayer to manage his or her duties with minimal physical effort. Belay devices are designed to allow a weak person to easily arrest a climber&#x27;s fall with maximum control, while avoiding twisting, heating or severely bending the rope.

===Self-belay===

While the task of belaying is typically assigned to a companion who stays at the bottom, self-belaying is also possible as an advanced technical climbing technique.

===Munter hitch / Italian hitch===
A munter hitch is a belaying method that creates a friction brake by tying a special knot around an appropriate carabiner. This type of belay, however, causes the rope to become twisted. It can also be used on double ropes. Simply tie the munter hitch with both ropes as if they were one.

===Body belay===
Before the invention of belay devices, belayers could add friction to the rope by wrapping it around their body; friction between rope and the belayer&#x27;s body was used to arrest a fall. This is known as a &quot;body belay&quot;, a &quot;hip belay&quot;, or a &quot;waist belay&quot; and is still sometimes used when climbing quickly over easier ground. On vertical rock it is no longer used as it is less reliable and more apt to injure the belayer stopping a long fall.

===Australian belay===
The Australian belay is used on many high ropes courses for supporting participants on vertical, as opposed to traversing, elements. The Australian belay allows untrained participants to engage in the safety and support of their fellow participants on an element, and allows a single facilitator to oversee an element with multiple individuals participating. The Australian belay does not use a traditional belay device, but rather ties two or more people into loops on the working end of the rope as a belay team, who walk backward as the participant ascends the element, taking up slack as they go. Additional participants can be tied into the loops or left free to help hold clipped in members of the belay team in place. The Australian belay requires a clear runway back from the element almost double the height of the element in order to allow the belay team to support climbers all the way to the top.

<text>Chrysolophus is a genus of the pheasant family of birds. The genus name is from Ancient Greek &quot;khrusolophos&quot;, &quot;with golden crest&quot;.

These are species which have spectacularly plumaged males. The golden pheasant is native to western China, and Lady Amherst&#x27;s pheasant to Tibet and westernmost China, but both have been widely introduced elsewhere. In places where self-supporting feral populations have become established, such as England, the two species will interbreed to produce hybrids.

Despite the male&#x27;s showy appearance, these birds are very difficult to see in their natural habitat, which is dense, dark, young conifer forests with sparse undergrowth. Consequently, little is known of their behaviour in the wild.

They feed on the ground on grain, leaves and invertebrates, but roost in trees at night. Whilst they can fly, they prefer to run: but if startled they can suddenly burst upwards at great speed, with a distinctive wing sound.

==Taxonomy==
The genus &quot;Chrysolophus&quot; was introduced in a figure caption by the English zoologist John Edward Gray in 1834 for a single species, the golden pheasant (&quot;Phasianus pictus&quot; Linnaeus, 1758) which is therefore considered as the type species. The genus name is from Ancient Greek χρυσολοφος/&quot;khrusolophos&quot; mening with &quot;golden crest&quot;, from χρυσος/&quot;khrusos&quot; meaning &quot;gold&quot; and λοφος/&quot;lophos&quot; meaning &quot;crest&quot;. The genus now contains two species.

<text>A sports agent is a legal representative (hence agent) for professional sports figures such as athletes and coaches. They procure and negotiate employment and endorsement contracts for the athlete or coach whom they represent. In addition to contract negotiations, sports agents may also help their clients with financial planning, legal issues, and marketing. They may work closely with financial advisors, lawyers, and marketing professionals on behalf of their clients. 

==Description==
Because of the unique characteristics of the sports industry, sports agents are responsible for communications with team owners, managers, and other individuals. In addition to finding income sources, agents often handle public relations matters for their clients. In some large sports agencies, such as IMG, Creative Artists Agency, Roc Nation Sports and Octagon, agents deal with all aspects of a client&#x27;s finances, from investment to filing taxes.

Sports agents may be relied upon by their clients for guidance in all business aspects, and sometimes even more broadly. For example, hockey agents start recruiting clients as young as 15, allowing the agent to guide the athlete&#x27;s career before the NHL draft, which happens usually at 18 years of age.

Due to the length and complexity of contracts, many sports agents are lawyers or have a background in contract law. Agents are expected to be knowledgeable about finance, business management, and financial and risk analysis, as well as sports. It is important for a sports agent to follow trends in sports. Other skills an agent must possess are excellent communication and negotiation skills. Agents must be highly motivated, willing to work long hours, and capable of multitasking. It is very common for agents to be in negotiations on behalf of several clients at one time.

Some agents are part of large companies, and some are on their own. The number of clients an individual agent can handle and how many clients his or her employing agency can handle in total are interdependent variables.

Before the 1990s, most football players did not use agents. In some cases, they used their parents as agents. Because of most parents&#x27; naivety about the football business, these footballers were often given less-than-stellar contracts by football clubs, which yielded lower salaries than they thought they deserved. In Sweden, there were only three licensed agents in 1995. As of 2002, there were 33. According to FIFA, there were 5,187 licensed association football agents worldwide, with 600 agents in Italy alone. Since 2001, agents have not been licensed by FIFA. Instead, agents are now licensed directly by each association.

Sports agents generally receive between 4 and 15% of the athlete&#x27;s playing contract, and 10 to 20% of the athlete&#x27;s endorsement contract, although these figures vary. NFL agents are not permitted to receive more than 3%, and NBA agents not more than 4%, of their client&#x27;s playing contracts.

==Media depictions==
Films such as &quot;Jerry Maguire&quot;, &quot;Two for the Money&quot;, and &quot;Any Given Sunday&quot; depicted sports agents. In England, ITV&#x27;s &quot;Footballers&#x27; Wives&quot; included a female agent Hazel Bailey. The television show &quot;Ballers&quot;, which started in 2015, also shows a strong depiction of sports agents.

* Assante Corporation – Canadian public company that acquired the Steinberg, Moorad &amp; Dunn agency, then acquired other than agencies including Dan Fegan &amp; Associates and Maximum Sports Management in an unsuccessful effort to build multi-sport corporate agency.
* SFX Entertainment (now Live Nation, a publicly traded company) – in 1998 SFX agreed to pay up to $150 million in cash, stock, and bonuses for F.A.M.E., the sports agency run by David Falk, the agent for basketball players Michael Jordan and Patrick Ewing. SFX also acquired two other major sports agencies, Arn Tellem&#x27;s agency (Tellem &amp; Associates) and the baseball-oriented firm run by Randy Hendricks and Allan Hendricks. SFX would later reverse course, and sell off the pieces of its large sports agency business.
* Steinberg, Moorad &amp; Dunn (&quot;SMD&quot;) – a multi-sport agency sold in October 1999 for reported $120 million to Canadian financial firm. Defections of principals, and litigation, followed. Originally led by entrepreneurial agents Leigh Steinberg and Jeff Moorad.

<text>Brigadier Christopher John Beckett, 4th Baron Grimthorpe, (16 September 1915 – 6 July 2003), was a soldier, company director, landowner and peer of the realm.

==Personal life==
Christopher John Beckett was born 16 September 1915, eldest son of Ralph Beckett, 3rd Baron Grimthorpe (1891–1963), a partner in the banking firm of Beckett and Co., of Leeds, Yorkshire, by his first wife, Mary Alice Archdale, daughter of Colonel Mervyn Archdale, 12th Lancers, and Mary Kate de Bathe, daughter of Sir Henry de Bathe, 4th Baronet. He grew up at Easthorpe Hall, Malton, in North Yorkshire, where his father and his second wife, Angela, ran a stud where they bred Flagrant Mac, which won the Scottish Grand National in 1952. The best horse they owned, however, was Fortina, winner of the 1947 Cheltenham Gold Cup.

Beckett was educated at Eton. He succeeded his father as fourth Baron and eighth Baronet in 1963.

On 17 February 1954, he married Lady Elizabeth Lumley, daughter of Roger Lumley, 11th Earl of Scarbrough, of Lumley Castle, Lord Chamberlain to the Queen. The wedding took place at the Queen&#x27;s Chapel, Marlborough Gate, sometimes called the Marlborough House Chapel, by special permission of the sovereign, and the wedding reception took place at St James&#x27;s Palace. Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother, Princess Margaret, and the Duchess of Gloucester attended. In 1973 Lady Grimthorpe joined the household of the Queen Mother as a Lady of the Bedchamber, and remained in that post at Clarence House until the death of Her Majesty.

Grimthorpe was a director of Thirsk Race Committee, and was a member of the Jockey Club. He also served as a consultant and sales representative with Sir Alfred McAlpine and Son Ltd. In 1973 he joined the board of Yorkshire Post Newspapers, of which his uncle, the Hon. Rupert Beckett, had been chairman for 30 years, 1920–1950. Grimthorpe was appointed OBE (military) in 1958.

A memorial service was held at York Minster on 16 July 2003. He is survived by Lady Grimthorpe, two sons, Edward John and Ralph Daniel (Danny) Beckett, and a daughter, Harriet.

==Military career==
Grimthorpe had a distinguished military career, retiring from the Army in 1968 as a brigadier.

He was Colonel Commanding the 9th Queen&#x27;s Royal Lancers from 1955 to 1958 and Brigadier Royal Armoured Corps Western Command from 1961 to 1964. He was deputy commander of HQ Malta and Libya from 1964 to 1967 and served as an ADC to the Queen.

In retirement he was a Deputy Lieutenant for North Yorkshire from 1969 and Colonel of the 9th/12th Lancers from 1973 to 1978.

<doc id="775079" wikidata="Q6954187" url="?curid=775079" title="NHS foundation trust">
<text>An NHS foundation trust is a semi-autonomous organisational unit within the National Health Service in England. They have a degree of independence from the Department of Health and Social Care (and, until the abolition of SHAs in 2013, their local strategic health authority). As of March 2019 there were 151 foundation trusts.

==Inspiration==
Alan Milburn&#x27;s trip in 2001 to the Hospital Universitario Fundación Alcorcón in Spain is thought to have been influential in developing ideas around foundation status. That hospital was built by the Spanish National Health System, but its operational management is contracted out to a private company, and exempt from many of the rules normally imposed on state-owned hospitals, and in particular, that hospital was allowed to negotiate its own contracts with workers. The governance of that hospital includes local government, trade unions, health workers and community groups.

==History==

Foundation trusts were announced by Health Secretary Alan Milburn in 2002, and the legislative basis was the Health and Social Care (Community Health and Standards) Act 2003. The first ten NHS hospitals to become foundation trusts were announced in 2004. Gordon Brown prevented plans by Alan Milburn that they should be financially autonomous in 2002. By 2012, the Monitor website listed 145 foundation trusts.

Successive governments set target dates by which all NHS trusts were supposed to have reached foundation status. For example, by 2009 the Department of Health was promoting &quot;A new type of NHS hospital&quot;. In 2011, the 116 trusts then in the pipeline to make applications were required to sign a formal agreement, with a deadline for the application to be made. Board members at a number of trusts which missed the deadline were sacked.

It was accepted by Andrew Lansley that a number of trusts would never reach foundation trust status, and a new organisation – the NHS Trust Development Authority – was established by the Health and Social Care Act 2012 to supervise trusts which have not reached foundation status, of which there were 99 in April 2013, 47 of which were never expected to reach foundation status.

The Health and Social Care Bill 2011, overseen by Lansley, proposed that all NHS trusts become foundation trusts or part of an existing foundation trust by April 2014.

The early foundation trusts were generally financially buoyant, but during 2013 and 2014 more faced financial difficulties. A foundation trust finance facility, managed by an advisory committee to the Department of Health, was established to process loans for capital developments, but during 2014 applications were made by trusts which had trouble paying utility bills or replacing medical equipment. Guidance issued under the tenure of Jeremy Hunt in October 2014 said that conditions could be set which could include: reductions in the use of temporary staff, &quot;use of collaborative procurement routes&quot; or &quot;the adoption of a shared services solution&quot;. By the end of 2013–14, foundation trusts collectively had built up cash reserves of £4.3 billion and it was suggested in the NHS Five Year Forward View that the government would &quot;support&quot; foundation trusts to spend this money &quot;to help local service transformation&quot;. In response, the chief executive of the Foundation Trust Network, Chris Hopson, said: &quot;The responsibility for these surpluses lies with the FTs; any attempt by the statutory bodies to make a grab for them will be furiously resisted&quot;.

By 2016, the distinction between foundation trusts and other NHS trusts was widely regarded as eroded, and in that year the two regulators were combined into a new body, NHS Improvement. The notion that every trust should become a foundation trust was abandoned, and the widespread financial crisis undermined the supposed autonomy when almost all had to rely on money borrowed from the Department of Health, to which strings were attached.

==Function==
Foundation trusts have some managerial and financial freedom when compared to NHS trusts. The introduction of foundation trusts represented a change in the history of the National Health Service and the way in which hospital services are managed and provided. At the time of introduction, they were described &quot;as a sort of halfway house between the public and private sectors&quot;. This form of NHS trust is an important part of the United Kingdom government&#x27;s programme to create a &quot;patient-led&quot; NHS with an internal market. The stated purpose is to devolve decision-making from a centralised NHS to local communities, in an effort to be more responsive to their needs and wishes. But after Gordon Brown prevented plans by Alan Milburn to make them financially autonomous they have been much more in the public sector and less autonomous than was originally expected.

== Statistics ==
By March 2013 there were 145 foundation trusts, of which 41 were mental health trusts and three were ambulance trusts. They included acute trusts, mental health, community and ambulance trusts. By March 2019, the number of foundation trusts had shown a small increase to 151.

==Governance==

The basic governance structure and form of foundation trusts is described in Schedule 7 of the National Health Service Act 2006, with the formal corporate form being called a &quot;public benefit corporation&quot;.

Each foundation trust has a council of governors. This is made up of elected governors and appointed governors. Elected governors are chosen by a secret postal ballot of the membership, which is open to the general public. The elections are usually held in separate constituencies. Typically there is a staff constituency, a patient constituency, and a &quot;public member&quot; constituency, consisting of members who are neither patients nor staff but live in a defined geographical area. In addition, there are governors appointed by bodies with whom the trust works in partnership. So, for example, appointments may be made by local councils, local medical schools, and local voluntary organisations. Governors are intended to act as a link between the community and the board of directors. The size of the council of governors and its exact composition are determined by the constitution of the particular trust. Each trust adopts its own constitution subject to certain restrictions in legislation. These restrictions include that a majority of the council of governors must be elected governors and governors must be unpaid volunteers. Some trusts are more committed to co-operative principles and have even written the Rochdale Principles into their constitution; they aspire to work closely and in partnership with other mutual and local organisations.

At first, foundation trusts were authorised and regulated by Monitor, a non-executive body under the Department of Health. Monitor was merged into NHS Improvement in 2016.

The trade body for foundation trusts is NHS Providers, formerly known as the Foundation Trust Network, which has 95% of all acute, ambulance, community and mental health foundation trusts in its membership.

A 2014 report by the Socialist Health Association said that on the whole after 10 years, &quot;Foundation Trusts [had]... not deepened in terms of democratic practice and participation&quot;.

The independence of Foundation Trust governors was challenged in 2021 when the governors of Queen Victoria Hospital, a small specialist trust, called for a pause to plans for it to merge with University Hospitals Sussex NHS Foundation Trust. NHS Improvement were said to have effectively ordered the council of governors to work towards a merger.

==Reception==

A study undertaken in 2005 by the King&#x27;s Fund of Homerton University Hospital NHS Foundation Trust found some governors disappointed and disillusioned.

Another report in 2005, funded by the Nuffield Foundation, found that it was too easy to invite members to sit on sub-committees, where they quickly became bogged down in the minutiae of operational planning, whilst the main decisions were taken at meetings that they only heard about after they took place.

The public&#x27;s perception of foundation trust status implying a high standard of clinical care was changed by the Mid Staffordshire NHS Foundation Trust scandal of the late 2000s (Stafford Hospital Scandal) and the ensuing Francis inquiry, published in 2013. At the outset, some critics claimed that foundation trusts went against the spirit of the principles laid out by Aneurin Bevan, the founder of the NHS. Others feared that it would lead to a two-tier system. Others doubted whether foundation trust members would succeed in having any effective influence over hospital management.

In 2011, some argued in a report financed by the Nuffield Foundation that the success associated with foundation trusts had been due to other factors than governance.

In June 2014, Bill Moyes, former Monitor executive chair, urged the NHS to reconsider &quot;whether the model of foundation trusts is sensible&quot;, arguing &quot;If one-third of the hospital system is permanently not demonstrating good viability and good governance, is that telling you something about actually how the system should run as opposed to how we thought it should run?&quot;.

In January 2022 Sajid Javid, writing in The Times said he was planning a “revolution” that would allow “well-run hospitals more freedom”.

==Comparison with other NHS trusts==


Foundation trusts had a cap on the proportion of their income that can come from non-NHS treatments. It did not only apply to income derived from individual patients, it covered income from all non-NHS sources. This could include joint ventures to develop medical technologies, employers paying for counselling services or income from treating UK military personnel overseas.

The Health and Social Care Act 2012 abolished the private patient income cap but FTs have to do the majority of their work for the NHS. This restriction was kept to reassure those concerned about future developments that FTs would continue to have NHS work as their central concern. Previously each FT had its own cap, set at the level of its private activity when the first FTs were established in 2003/4. About three-quarters of all FTs had a cap of 1.5% or less. Until 2010 all mental health trusts were completely barred from undertaking non-NHS work, but after lobbying from the Foundation Trust Network it was raised to 1.5%. These caps disappeared on 1 October 2012. Collective earnings from private patients increased 14%, from £346.1 million in 2012–13 to £395.9 million for 2014–15. Private earning is concentrated on specialist hospitals in London who see many patients from other countries. Most trusts have negligible private income.

==Achieving foundation trust status==

In order to achieve foundation trust status, NHS trusts have to pass a variety of tests, which have changed over time. In 2003 only trusts with three stars from the Commission for Health Improvement were eligible for foundation status. In that year Aintree Hospitals, Essex Rivers Healthcare, Newcastle upon Tyne Hospitals and Walsall Hospitals were all downgraded to two stars and so did not make the first wave of foundation trusts.

== Highly secure psychiatric services (EFT) ==
Formerly referred to as &quot;foundation trust equivalent&quot; (FTe) instead of &quot;Equivalent Foundation Trusts&quot;, this designation applies only to trusts providing high secure psychiatric services, of which there are three: Nottinghamshire Healthcare NHS Trust, West London Mental Health NHS Trust and Mersey Care NHS Trust.

These trusts abide by the Department of Health definition of a foundation trust, but the Secretary of State for Health maintains a direct line of communication and accountability with them because he or she has the responsibility to provide healthcare to patients who have been detained under the Mental Health Act, and have been judged to pose a grave and immediate danger to the public.

Unlike full foundation trusts, governors have no statutory role, and the board of directors have no statutory duty towards the governors. The governors cannot, without the board of directors&#x27; permission, have any control over the direction of the trust, and cannot appoint or remove trust auditors. The chair and directors are not appointed by their board of governors.

<doc id="775084" wikidata="Q2302727" url="?curid=775084" title="Pointe technique">
<text>Pointe technique ( ) is part of classical ballet involving a technique that concerns &quot;pointe work&quot;, in which a ballet dancer supports all body weight on the tips of fully extended feet when wearing pointe shoes. A dancer is said to be &quot;en pointe&quot; () when the body is supported in this manner, and a fully extended vertical foot is said to be &quot;en pointe&quot; when touching the floor, even when not bearing weight.

Pointe technique resulted from a desire for female dancers to appear weightless and sylph-like. Although both men and women are capable of pointe work, it is most often performed by women. Extensive training and practice are required to develop the strength and technique needed for pointe work. Typically, dance teachers consider factors such as age, experience, strength and alignment when deciding whether to allow a dancer to begin pointe work.

==Technique==

Pointe technique encompasses both the mechanical and artistic aspects of pointe work. In particular, it is concerned with body alignment, placement of the feet and the manner in which a dancer transitions to and from en pointe. A dancer is said to have &quot;good&quot; or &quot;proper&quot; technique when in conformance with the best practices of pointe technique, which in turn are generally referred to as &quot;proper technique&quot;.

===Placement and alignment===
En pointe dancers employ pointe technique to determine foot placement and body alignment. When exhibiting proper technique, a dancer&#x27;s en pointe foot is placed so that the instep is fully stretched with toes perpendicular to the floor, and the pointe shoe&#x27;s platform (the flattened tip of the toe box) is square to the floor, so that a substantial part of its surface is contacting the floor.

Proper technique is also evident from a dancer&#x27;s body alignment, by visualizing a straight line that extends from the center of the hip through the toes. When a properly aligned dancer is viewed from the side, the line passes through the knee, ankle joint and big toe joints. When viewed from the front, the line passes through the knee, ankle joint and the joints of the second toe or middle toe or the area between those toe joints. In cases of unusually high instep or metatarsal joint flexibility, it is sometimes necessary to flex the toes to achieve proper alignment.

===Movement into &quot;en pointe&quot;===
A dancer may transition to en pointe by any of three possible methods: relevé, sauté or piqué. In the relevé method, the dancer rises smoothly by rotating the foot downward until it reaches a fully extended, vertical orientation while the toe box remains in contact with the floor, thus &quot;rolling up&quot; on the foot. This may be done either gradually or rapidly, on one foot or both feet, beginning with feet flat on the floor or in demi-pointe (heels raised). In the sauté method, the dancer springs up and lands en pointe. In the process, the feet break contact with the floor and the dancer is briefly airborne. To transition to en pointe via piqué, a dancer will step out directly onto a fully extended, vertical foot. The other foot is then raised from the floor, thereby leaving the dancer en pointe.

Modern ballet technique incorporates all three transition methods. Relevé and piqué transitions are typically used for adages, where strength, poise and controlled movements are highlighted. The more abrupt sauté method, which was introduced by Enrico Cecchetti, is typically used in allegros, where the relatively slow and smooth relevé and piqué transitions would be both impractical and visually inconsistent with the lively pace of movement. The sauté method is more common in Russian ballet.

==Training==
===Prerequisites===
Although age is not necessarily a prerequisite, many ballet students do not begin to dance en pointe earlier than approximately 12–14 years of age because bones in the feet are often too soft prior to that age and in such cases serious and permanent foot injuries could result from starting pointe work too early. While some students start pointe work at the age of ten or eleven, this should only be practised by highly accomplished and experienced students. The long bones in feet begin to harden between the ages of 8 and 14; dancing en pointe before one&#x27;s bones have hardened can lead to trauma and growth-plate fractures that create deformed feet.

Exceptions may be made if a physician has determined that a dancer&#x27;s feet have sufficiently ossified, and it is not uncommon for dancers to begin pointe work as early as age nine. Oftentimes dance studios require their dancers to have their feet x-rays and get their physician to verify whether the dancer&#x27;s feet are ready for pointe work.

Another key determining factor is strength in the legs, feet, ankles and core. Without strong ankles, feet and legs dancers are likely to hurt themselves once en pointe or be too weak to remain en pointe for the duration of a routine. Strong core strength ensures the dancer maintains their center and prevents them from rolling their feet when dancing en pointe.

Otherwise ballet students are generally ready to begin pointe work after achieving competency in fundamental ballet technique and have been dancing for a number of years. For example, before learning pointe work, a dancer must be able to maintain turnout while performing center combinations, hold a proper ballet position with straight back and good turnout, pull up properly in the legs, and balance securely in a relevé that is perpendicular to the floor.

===Preparation (pre-pointe classes)===
Preparation for pointe work is a gradual process that begins with barre exercises to develop the requisite strength in ankles, feet, legs and core often known as pre-pointe classes. These exercises may vary in accordance with a teacher&#x27;s preferences and if applicable, the training method&#x27;s syllabus. The first exercises at the barre are usually &quot;relevés&quot; and &quot;échappés&quot;. When the student is comfortable executing these steps on both feet and sufficiently strong, steps ending on one en pointe foot are introduced such as &quot;pas de bourrée&quot; and &quot;retiré.&quot;

During each class session, a student will move on to centre exercises after completing the barre work. These exercises emphasize various aspects of ballet technique such as: turnout, pointing of the toes, and the use of ballet technique while en pointe.

Dancers typically take pre-pointe lessons for a year before they are allowed to get pointe shoes. However, it is at the discretion of the dance instructor to determine if one year of pre-pointe is sufficient or if the dancer needs more time to prepare. Hence, it is quite common for students to take two or even three years of pre-pointe in order to properly assimilate all the material required for pointe.

==Health risks and injury prevention==
Dancing en pointe stresses the feet in various ways and thus can potentially cause injuries if the dancer does not plan ahead or take into account health and safety concerns. Injuries can result from improper technique, poorly fitting pointe shoes, and lack of effective cushioning and accessories. Some types of injuries are prevented by adhering to proper technique such as: correct upper-body positioning, maintaining straight knees when required, keeping body weight centered over the box of the shoes, and avoiding sickling. Problems dealing with technique can be easily fixed by proper training and one-on-one interactions with the dance instructor to improve the dancer&#x27;s technique.

Injuries due to toe misalignment are often avoided by adjusting toe alignments with gel toe spacers. Toenail bruising can be caused by heavy pressure on the surface of the nail. This is typically prevented by keeping toenails clipped short, by wrapping tape around the toes, by using padding, or combinations of these. Bruising can also occur on the tips of the toes, especially when no padding is used. It is highly unadvised to dance en pointe without padding.

Pointe work can cause friction between toes and the interior of the pointe shoe&#x27;s box. This friction, under the high pressure of much of the dancer&#x27;s body weight, can result in chafing and blistering. This is often mitigated with lambswool or toe pads or by wrapping tape around toes or use gel pads that can conform to any one problem area. Choosing between cloth and gel, gel, only cloth, wool, etc. for toe pads is a personal preference for each dancer, but each style has its own benefits.

Other exterior injuries include cuts caused by toenails piercing adjacent toes. This can be prevented by keeping toe nails cut short and filed smooth. Also, calluses may form on the bottoms and sides of the feet, which can crack open. This can be helped by the use of gel pad protectors on specific problem spots or using pads to surround the toes. Ingrown nails can result from ill-fitting shoes.

Ultimately, dancing on the tips of the toes is unnatural, painful and potentially harmful. Every other activity of the human foot, walking, running, jumping, has been part of its evolutionary journey from arboreal to bipedal locomotion - dancing en pointe has not. Further, pointe shoes are symmetrical, there are no lefts and rights. The toes have to flex inwards to conform to the tapered shape of the toe box. Pressure of the body weight on the toes in this misaligned position may, with other factors, contribute to the development of bunions.

Other common injuries:
* Deformities such as bunions, bunionettes, and hammer toes
* Inflammations such as bursitis and sesamoiditis
* Dancer&#x27;s heel (Plantar fasciitis), a tightening of the instep tendon that causes discomfort in the instep and heel
* Sprained ankles
* Stress fractures
* Achilles tendinitis and extensor tendinitis

<doc id="775090" wikidata="Q287359" url="?curid=775090" title="Estádio José Alvalade">
<text>Estádio José Alvalade (; is a football stadium in Lisbon, Portugal, home of Sporting Clube de Portugal. It was built adjacent to the site of the older stadium. The stadium is named after José Alvalade (1885–1918), the founder and first club member of Sporting CP in the early twentieth century.

== Origin ==
The previous José Alvalade Stadium was opened on 10 June 1956. Plans by Sporting CP to modernize the club in the late 1990s coincided with the decision to award Portugal the right to host UEFA Euro 2004, but the decision to build a new stadium, was made before. The construction beginning on 15 January 2001. The club&#x27;s statutes dictated that the stadium would be called Estádio José Alvalade. It would be the club&#x27;s seventh stadium.

==History==
The stadium is the center of a complex called Alvalade XXI, designed by Portuguese architect Tomás Taveira, which includes a mall called Alvaláxia with a 12-screen movie theater, a health club, the club&#x27;s museum, a sports pavilion, a clinic, and an office building. The complex cost a total of €162 million, with the stadium accounting for almost €120 million. On the exterior, the stadium featured multicoloured tiles which were later removed. In 2021, Sporting CP announced that it would change the colour of the seats in the multicoloured stands of Estádio José Alvalade to green (the main colour of the sports club). The colour change was completed in 2022. Originally the seats were arranged in a random-looking mosaic of mixed colours, however during its second decade of use these were all gradually changed to dark green, with the roof support towers and access stairways, initially bright yellow, also repainted green in 2011.

Although it eventually received a fifth star becoming a UEFA 5-star stadium, it was initially classified by UEFA as a 4-star stadium. The stadium – originally projected to hold 42,000 spectators at any given time – has a capacity of 50,095 and was acoustically engineered as a venue for major concerts. The stadium has also a total of 1,315 underground parking spaces, including 30 for disabled spectators.
The new stadium official opening was on 6 August 2003 when Sporting played and beat Manchester United 3–1. Luís Filipe scored the first-ever goal at the new Estádio José Alvalade in that friendly win against Manchester United playing alongside Sporting Portugal&#x27;s teammate Cristiano Ronaldo, then aged 18, who made his last appearance for the Portuguese club on that same day.

The stadium hosted five matches of UEFA Euro 2004, one of them being the semi-final between Portugal and the Netherlands, which Portugal won 2–1. In May 2005, the stadium was upgraded to 5-star stadium status by UEFA, the same month it hosted the 2005 UEFA Cup Final between Sporting and CSKA Moscow, which CSKA Moscow won 3–1.

It hosted quarter-finals and semi-finals matches during the 2019–20 UEFA Champions League. The stadium is one of the potential venues for the 2030 FIFA World Cup which Portugal will co-host along with Morocco and Spain.

<doc id="775114" wikidata="Q3496842" url="?curid=775114" title="Stanley Kowalski">
<text>Stanley Kowalski is a fictional character in Tennessee Williams&#x27; play &quot;A Streetcar Named Desire&quot;.

==In the play==
Stanley lives in the working-class Faubourg Marigny neighborhood of New Orleans with his wife, Stella ( DuBois), and is employed as a factory parts salesman. He was an Army engineer in World War II, having served as a Master Sergeant. He is a controlling, hard-edged man, with no discernible capacity for empathy, forgiveness, or patience, and no apparent family ties of his own, although he once mentions a cousin. He also has a vicious temper and fights with his wife, sometimes leading to instances of domestic violence, which mirror those of the older married couple who live upstairs, the Hubbells. Near the beginning of the play, Stanley announces that Stella is pregnant.

Stanley&#x27;s life becomes more complicated when Stella&#x27;s sister Blanche shows up at their door for a seemingly indefinite &quot;visit&quot;. He resents the genteel Blanche, who derides him as an &quot;ape&quot;, and calls him a &quot;Polack&quot;. She flirts with him but attempts behind his back to get Stella to leave the marriage, intensifying his resentment. She poses a threat; in his mind to both his regimented, hedonistic lifestyle and his marriage and concomitant control of his wife. He determines to eliminate this perceived threat and take his revenge.

Stanley starts asking questions from a seedy street merchant, Shaw, who knew Blanche in her old life. Stanley already knows Blanche is staying with the Kowalskis because she is homeless; her family&#x27;s ancestral mansion, Belle Reve, has been mortgaged. He learns from Shaw that she was paid to leave Mississippi to quell gossip about her many affairs, which she began after her husband, a closeted homosexual, committed suicide. Overjoyed to have the upper hand, Stanley tells Mitch about Blanche&#x27;s past, which causes Mitch to end the budding relationship which would have seen Blanche leave the Kowalski household and marry Mitch and replace his dying mother as the object of his love. Stanley&#x27;s cruelty infuriates the hapless Stella.

That night, Stella goes to the hospital to give birth. Stanley goes out and gets drunk in celebration, and returns home. He finds a similarly drunk Blanche, lost in fantasies of soon-to-be happy times, benefit of Shep Huntleigh.

Mitch, possibly emboldened himself with some liquor, had earlier visited after Stanley and Stella left, and told Blanche that she was not good enough to meet his mother but demanded some sexual attention as that is all she is apparently good for. She told him to get out or she&#x27;d scream fire, and he left.

Stanley drunkenly fondles Blanche, who rejects him and affects . He traps her in the bedroom and easily disarms her after she breaks a bottle to use as a weapon. She collapses and the scene ends with her impending rape. This final assault on what she had left of her dignity sends Blanche over the edge into a nervous breakdown. Blanche tells Stella but Stanley lies to his wife and denies Blanche&#x27;s claim. Weeks later, Stella has Blanche committed to a mental institution at Stanley&#x27;s insistence.

In the original play, Stella refuses to allow herself to believe Blanche (with the support of Eunice Hubbell) and stays with Stanley, although she seems to need to convince herself. In the 1951 film adaptation, however, due to the demands of the censors, Stella leaves him and takes their child. Most later film and television versions restore the original ending.

==Development==
When developing the character, Williams frequently changed what Stanley&#x27;s ethnicity would be. Originally the story was set in Chicago and he was written as an Italian American named Lucio. Another draft, set in Atlanta, had the character named Ralph and be an Irish American. In order the draft names were: Lucio, Stanley Landowski, Jack, Ralph, Ralph Stanley, and Ralph Kowalski, prior to the final one.

No copies of the play drafts mention what Kowalski&#x27;s line of work is. According to author Joseph W. Zurawski, Stanley appeared to be an office worker instead of a blue collar worker.

==In other media==
He was most famously portrayed by Marlon Brando opposite Jessica Tandy&#x27;s Blanche in the play&#x27;s initial Broadway production and, several years later, opposite Vivien Leigh with his Oscar nominated performance in the 1951 film adaptation.

Others who later played the role include: Anthony Quinn, who succeeded Brando on Broadway and played opposite Tandy&#x27;s successor, Uta Hagen;
James Farentino (opposite Rosemary Harris) on Broadway in 1973; Treat Williams (opposite Ann-Margret) in the 1984 TV movie; and Alec Baldwin (opposite Jessica Lange), both on Broadway in 1992 and in the 1995 TV movie.

In 1976 Rip Torn played Stanley opposite his wife Geraldine Page as Blanche in a Chicago production that was described as raw, dangerous and threateningly realistic, pushing the Streetcar script to the farthest reaches of urban violence and unabated naturalism.

Aidan Quinn and Christopher Walken both played the role opposite Blythe Danner&#x27;s Blanche in two different stage productions. The three actors and both productions, however, received mixed to middling reviews.

In 1990, Bruce Payne played a Kowalski-esque character in the music video for Neil Young&#x27;s song &quot;Over and Over&quot;.

The name is used for lead character Detective Stanley Kowalski, portrayed by Callum Keith Rennie, in the 1994–1999 television series &quot;Due South&quot;; in the series, the character&#x27;s ex-wife is Stella Kowalski.

Mayor Steve Price, Councillor Erin Bremner-Mitchell, Councillor Tim Chad, Councillor Barbara Fallot, Councillor Mervyn Lougher-Goodey, Councillor Cam McLennan, and Councillor Peter Wainwright.

==Education==
Public schools serving Sidney residents are operated by School District 63 Saanich. These include Sidney Elementary School, North Saanich Middle School, and Parkland Secondary School.

==Sister city==
On June 30, 2008, the Sidney Sister Cities Association and the town of Sidney, BC declared the twinning of Sidney and Niimi, Okayama, Japan. This was Sidney&#x27;s third sister city, following Cairns, Queensland, Australia and Anacortes, Washington, United States.

==Attractions==
Sidney&#x27;s most popular attraction is its position on the Salish Sea. Sidney-by-the-Sea is the gateway to the southern Gulf Islands National Park Reserve, and is an eco-tourist destination, with whale-watching, bird-watching, kayaking and scuba-diving. It is home to the new Shaw Ocean Discovery Centre. Shoal Harbour Migratory Bird Sanctuary is located within Sidney and the adjoining Sidney Channel Important Bird Area, an internationally recognized site important to a variety of seabirds and waterfowl.

Sidney has its own local history museum, the Sidney Museum and Archives, which features displays about the history of the surrounding Peninsula as well as temporary exhibits. As home to the Victoria International Airport Sidney also hosts the British Columbia Aviation Museum which features displays, artifacts, restored historical aircraft and a vintage aircraft restoration workshop.

During the summer, Sidney hosts a street market on Thursday evenings on the main street (Beacon). &quot;Sidney days&quot; is another event that occurs at the beginning of July. To celebrate, Sidney has a parade, a build-a-boat contest, a small fair and fireworks in the evening. In the winter, Sidney has a holiday parade as well as a lighted sailpast boat parade. Sidney has many dining places including Greek, Thai, Chinese, Japanese, and west-coast restaurants. With 12 bookstores, Sidney is officially one of Canada&#x27;s 2 book towns, the other being Fundy-St. Martins, New Brunswick. It also has almost as many coffee joints and cafes to sit and read in.

==Physiography==

Almost all of the land within Sidney&#x27;s boundary is either flat or very gently sloping, providing a topography which is favourable for the town&#x27;s elderly people. Most soils are clayey, and poorly drained in their natural state. In some parts of town, this clay is overlain by deposits of sand and gravel which are well drained.

==Climate==
Sidney enjoys a cool Mediterranean climate (Csb) with year-round mild temperatures and moderate rainfall. Most years see very little snow. Daily temperatures seldom climb above , or dip below . In the mildest winters, minimum temperatures stay above . Damaging winds are less frequent than in most other maritime areas of Canada.

==Fauna==
The environs of Sidney provides habitat for a diverse array of fish and wildlife, both terrestrial and marine, coming and going with the seasons. For this reason it is a growing mecca for bird watchers, whale watchers, scuba-divers and eco-tourism. Sidney&#x27;s most famous inhabitant is the bufflehead featured prominently on its coat of arms. The bufflehead is just one of many species of waterfowl that overwinter in Shoal Harbour Migratory Bird Sanctuary, one of the oldest marine sanctuaries on the west coast. Sidney overlooks Sidney Channel Important Bird Area, an internationally recognized site of major importance for many species of seabirds such as common murres, rhinoceros auklet, pigeon guillemots, murrelets, three species of cormorants, and several gull species, including the unusual Heermann&#x27;s gull. Another resident bird is the bald eagle which has nested continuously in &#x27;Beaufort Grove&#x27; for twenty-five years. In summer large numbers of great blue herons gather in Roberts Bay (part of Shoal Harbour Sanctuary) to feed on the abundant small fish. A variety of songbirds (towhees, American robins, Bewick&#x27;s and winter wrens, bushtits, chickadees etc.) are found in back yards, along with the common northwestern crow, and introduced species such as the common starling and house sparrow. The airport lands around Sidney are the only place in North America where the song of the European skylark can be heard.

Marine mammals include the ubiquitous harbour seal and the small harbour porpoise. Occasionally gray whales and killer whales can be seen from Sidney&#x27;s waterfront. Marine-adapted river otters are common coastal inhabitants, along with raccoon, and mink. Adjacent woodlands and farmlands are home to the small, shy black-tailed deer. In recent years, the introduced, invasive eastern grey squirrel has become abundant.

The waters around Sidney once supported a large sports fishery, based largely on Chinook salmon, along with ground fish such as ling cod, and various rockfish (&quot;Sebastes&quot;), but overfishing and poor management have greatly reduced the sports fishery. Also, ecological change and the decline of critical forage species such as the Pacific herring and the sand lance have had significant impacts on the larger predators, including salmon, killer whales and seabirds. Many of the common fish species and other marine fauna can be seen at the Shaw Ocean Discovery Centre on the Sidney waterfront.

==Flora==
Sidney is situated within the coastal Douglas fir ecosystem, one of the most restricted ecosystems in Canada, dominated by large Douglas firs, along with its most distinctive species, the &quot;Arbutus&quot; and Garry oak in drier exposures, and the aptly named big leaf maple, and western red cedar in damper sites. Deciduous trees include the black cottonwood, Douglas maple, red alder, Pacific dogwood, bitter cherry, Pacific crab apple, cascara, quaking aspen, hawthorn and several species of willow. Coastal areas contain several unique plant communities including sea asparagus, salt grass and eelgrass, documented by the renowned botanist and explorer, John Macoun, after he retired as curator of the National Museum in 1912.

Many non-native plants also occur, including many invasive species such as English ivy, Scotch broom, laurel-leafed daphne, Himalayan blackberry, chicory, Queen Anne&#x27;s lace, and red clover. Long-established exotic trees include London plane, horsechestnut, flowering cherry, flowering plum, Norway maple, sycamore maple, Japanese maple, catalpa and tulip tree. In recent years the American sweetgum, Freeman maple and Chinese windmill palm have become popular.

<doc id="775134" wikidata="Q4757224" url="?curid=775134" title="Andrew Hamilton (lawyer)">
<text>Andrew Hamilton (1676 – August 4, 1741) was a Scottish lawyer in the Thirteen Colonies who settled in Philadelphia. He was best known for his legal victory on behalf of the printer and newspaper publisher John Peter Zenger. His involvement with the 1735 decision in New York helped to establish that truth is a defense to an accusation of libel. His eloquent defense concluded with saying that the press has &quot;a liberty both of exposing and opposing tyrannical power by speaking and writing truth.&quot;

His success in this case has been said to have inspired the now-archaic term &quot;Philadelphia lawyer&quot;, meaning a particularly adept and clever attorney, as in &quot;It would take a Philadelphia lawyer to get him off.&quot; His estate in Philadelphia, known as Bush Hill, was inherited by his son, William Hamilton, who leased it for use as the vice-president&#x27;s house during the years that the city was the temporary capital of the United States.

==Early life==
Hamilton was believed to be born in the Kingdom of Scotland in approximately 1676. Hamilton did not talk about his parentage, career, or name in the Old World. At one time he was called Trent, although he returned to his name of Hamilton when Queen Anne came to the throne in 1702.

==Career==
About 1697, Hamilton immigrated to Accomac County, Virginia in British America, where he continued his study of law and taught a classical school. He later found employment as steward of a plantation owned by Joseph Preeson, one of his former students. After Preeson&#x27;s death in 1705, Hamilton continued working the Preeson estate.

On March 6, 1706, he married Preeson&#x27;s widow Ann, daughter of Thomas and Susanna Denwood Brown, who were members of a prominent Quaker family. The marriage is said to have brought Hamilton influential connections, and he began to practice law.

Two years after his marriage, on March 26, 1708, Hamilton purchased from John Toads a 600-acre estate, known as &quot;Henberry&quot;, on the north side of the Chester River in Kent County, Maryland. Millington, Maryland was later developed on Henberry&#x27;s land. Hamilton also maintained a residence in Virginia, and drew clients from both colonial states.

In his address to the Pennsylvania Assembly in 1739, Hamilton spoke of &quot;liberty, the love of which as it first drew me to, so it constantly prevailed on me to reside in this Province, tho&#x27; to the manifest prejudice of my fortune.&quot; Hamilton was probably his real name, but, for private reasons, he saw fit to discard it for a time, possibly due to his family&#x27;s involvement of the Glorious Revolution and the Jacobite Rising of 1689.

===Early career===

By 1712, at age 36, Hamilton established a reputation in Chestertown, Maryland, with a lucrative law practice. That year, he traveled to London to gain prestige in his profession. On January 27, 1712, he joined Gray&#x27;s Inn, one of London&#x27;s four societies for barristers. Two weeks later on February 10, he was called before the English Bar. At the end of the year, during the winter of 1712/13, William Penn hired Hamilton in a &quot;replevin&quot; case against Berkeley Codd. Codd disputed some of Penn&#x27;s rights under his grant from the Duke of York, who would later become King James II. This started the long and friendly relationship between Hamilton and the Penn family.

His trip to London and continued work in Pennsylvania, especially with the Penn family, gained Hamilton prominence. He came to the attention of both the Baltimore family and the government of the Maryland colony. In April 1715, he was chosen as a deputy to Maryland&#x27;s House of Delegates from Kent County. As Hamilton was presenting cases before the Pennsylvania Supreme Court on April 29, 1715, he did not learn about his selection until his return to Maryland on May 5, 1715. Hamilton took the oath of office, test, and abjuration the day of his return. But, he was arrested by the House due to his delayed taking of the oath and reporting to the House. They accepted his explanation that he was 100 miles from his home in Chestertown and unable to return because of business, but he had to pay a 65-shilling fine to officials.

Placed on the Committee of Laws, Hamilton was charged with the organization and codification of the Maryland colony&#x27;s judiciary laws. By May 14, 1715, Hamilton had helped put together a series of laws that became the Act of 1715. This Act would form the basis of the law for Maryland until the Revolution.

At some point during 1715, Hamilton moved to Philadelphia. He and his family occupied Clark Hall, owned by William Clark Jr. and Rebecca Clark, and managed by their relative Clement Plumsted. It was located at the corner of Third and Chestnut Streets.

===Philadelphia lawyer===

On September 7, 1717, Hamilton was appointed as attorney-general of Pennsylvania by Governor William Keith. In March 1721, he was called to the provincial council, and he accepted on condition that his duties should not interfere with his practice. Hamilton resigned the office in 1724; that year he traveled to London to oversee the formal approval of William Penn&#x27;s will on behalf of the Penn family.

When a settler named Cartledge killed a Seneca man in 1722 in an area outside the boundaries of Philadelphia County, tension rose between the tribes in the area and the colonists. Colonists feared the Seneca would cause violence unless Cartledge could be brought to trial. A new Court Act was deemed necessary and created under the supervision of Hamilton, as Attorney-General, and the Chief Justice, David Lloyd. Lloyd&#x27;s older laws were consolidated into the Judiciary Act of 1722, which was passed by Governor Keith on May 22, 1722. One feature allowed the Chief Justice to act as a justice of the peace anywhere in the colony if conditions called for it, a clear response to the Cartledge situation. As the murdered man was a Seneca, colonists feared the powerful Iroquois Confederacy might retaliate against the colonists for his death. Lloyd prepared to prosecute Cartledge. But the Iroquois wrote to Lloyd on July 30, 1722, urging that Cartledge be forgiven. At once the Assembly ordered one hundred pounds set aside for expenses and one hundred pounds for gifts. They authorized Hamilton as Attorney-General, Judge Hill, and a Mr. Norris to be a committee to visit the Five Nations.

In 1727, Hamilton was appointed prothonotary of the Supreme Court, Master of the Rolls, and Recorder of Philadelphia. He was elected to the Pennsylvania Provincial Assembly from Bucks County in the same year, chosen speaker in 1729, and re-elected annually until his retirement in 1739, with the exception of a single year, 1733.

The crowning glory of Hamilton&#x27;s career was his defense of John Peter Zenger in 1735, which he undertook &quot;pro bono&quot;. Zenger was a printer in New York City. In his newspaper, Zenger had asserted that judges were arbitrarily displaced, and new courts were erected, without the consent of the legislature, by which trials by jury were taken away when a governor was so disposed. The attorney-general charged him with the crime of seditious libel, and Zenger&#x27;s lawyers James Alexander and William Smith, objecting to the legality of the judge&#x27;s commissions, were stricken from the list of attorneys. At this point, no New York attorneys could take the case. The merchant Mary Spratt Alexander suggested to her husband James Alexander that he ask his colleague Andrew Hamilton whom he was in regular correspondence with – and who was outside of the reach of influence by the judge – to come to New York to defend Zenger. Mary Alexander then traveled to Philadelphia to interview Hamilton and provide him with the facts of the case. It is thought that she and her husband were early investors of the New York Weekly Gazette.

Hamilton feared that the advocate, who had subsequently been appointed by the court, might be overawed by the bench, at the head of which was Chief Justice De Lancey, a member of the governor&#x27;s council. He voluntarily went to New York and appeared in the case on Zenger&#x27;s behalf. He admitted that Zenger had printed and published the article but advanced the doctrine, novel at the time, that the truth of the facts in the alleged libel could be set up as a defense. He said that in this proceeding, the jury were judges of both the law and the facts.

The offer of evidence to prove the truth of Zenger&#x27;s statements was rejected, but Hamilton appealed to the jury to find or acknowledge from the evidence of their daily lives that the contents of the defendant&#x27;s article were true. He argued that the definition of criminal libel, which didn&#x27;t require the accusations to be false, came from the hated Star Chamber. His eloquence secured a verdict of &quot;not guilty&quot;.

The people of New York and the other colonies hailed the verdict with delight, since it insured free discussion of the public conduct of public officials. Gouverneur Morris referred to Hamilton as &quot;the day-star of the American Revolution.&quot; The common council of New York passed a resolution thanking him for his services, and presented him with the freedom of the city. In addition, a group of prominent residents contributed to the production of a 5½-ounce gold box that was presented to Hamilton as a lasting mark of their gratitude to him. His fame spread to England, an account of the trial passing through four editions there within three months.

====Later career====
On May 12, 1732, Thomas Penn, John Penn and Richard Penn, as the proprietors of Pennsylvania, signed an order to create a commission. This order was directed to prominent figures in the colonial Province of Pennsylvania and Philadelphia, including Hamilton, as well as Governor Gordon, Isaac Norris, Samuel Preston, and James Logan, Esquires, and to the gentlemen James Steel and Robert Charles. The commission, which was to be made up of at least three or more of these individuals, was given full power on behalf of the proprietors for the &quot;running, marking, and laying out&quot; of any boundary between Pennsylvania and Maryland. This was in accordance to the agreement signed between the Penn brothers and Charles Calvert, 5th Baron Baltimore on May 10, 1732.

From 1736 to his death in 1741, Hamilton was the mentor of young Benjamin Chew, who later became Attorney General and Chief Justice of Pennsylvania. Hamilton was for many years a trustee of the general loan-office, the province&#x27;s agency for issuing paper money. In 1737 he was appointed judge of the vice-admiralty court by Deputy Governor George Thomas, the only office he held at the time of his death.

===Independence Hall===
By Spring 1729, the citizens of Philadelphia were petitioning to erect a state house. A sum of two thousand pounds was raised for the proposal. Andrew Hamilton, along with Thomas Lawrence and John Kearsley, were appointed to a committee to decide upon plans for the building, select a site for construction, and hire contractors. Hamilton, in company with his son-in-law, William Allen, purchased the ground now known as Independence Square, whereon to erect &quot;a suitable building&quot; to be used as a legislative hall. Prior to 1729, the assembly met in a private residence.

Hamilton is often credited for the design of Independence Hall in Philadelphia, which was then known as the Pennsylvania State House. It is more likely that his designs were for initial planning and that he did not create the final plans. Beginning in 1732, Edmund Woolley was responsible for the final design and construction of the Pennsylvania State House, a project that employed Woolley and his apprentices well into the 1750s. The statehouse was not completed until after Hamilton&#x27;s death, and the conveyance of the land to the province was made by his son and son-in-law.

===Bush Hill, The Woodlands, and Lancaster County===

For his legal work formalizing William Penn&#x27;s will in London from 1724 to 1726, Hamilton was awarded land in 1726 and 1729 by the Pennsylvania proprietors; William Penn&#x27;s widow Hannah Penn and sons, Richard Penn, Thomas Penn, and John Penn. Hamilton also took this time to purchase from Stephen Jackson a portion of land from the Springettsburg Manor. These gifts and purchases added up to 153 acres of land, for which Hamilton received a patent in 1734.

The Bush Hill estate contained the land now bound by 12th Street to the East, 19th Street to the West, Vine Street to the South, and what is now Fairmount Avenue (but was once Coates Street) to the North. The manor was located on what is now the southern side of Spring Garden Street near the old Philadelphia Mint building, which is now used by the Community College of Philadelphia. Hamilton left the estate to his son James Hamilton after his death; he in turn passed it on to his nephew William Hamilton.

When the federal capital was located in Philadelphia, Bush Hill was rented to the government as the house of the vice-president, as William Hamilton was on an extended stay in England. During the Yellow Fever Epidemic of 1793, its outbuildings were adapted for use for several months as a fever hospital.

The Woodlands was a large area of land given to Hamilton; it was situated on the west side of the Schuylkill River and his property included much of present-day West Philadelphia. He left it to his son Andrew, who survived him by only six years. The next to inherit and use the land was the younger Andrew Hamilton&#x27;s son, William Hamilton.

Hamilton and his son James were among the founders of Lancaster, which in 1729 became the fourth county in the province of Pennsylvania. The community was located on a 500-acre (2 km2) tract owned by Hamilton, on which he laid out Lancaster Townstead around 1730. By 1734, James, now proprietor of Lancaster town, won a seat in the Assembly and became the political leader of the county. In 1742 James Hamilton secured the original charter of government, which gave the settlement the status of borough (this charter can be found today in the city clerk&#x27;s office).

==Later life==
Hamilton&#x27;s wife Anne is believed to have died around the year 1736. Hamilton died at his country seat of Bush Hill and was at first buried on that property. After the sale of his estate in the 1800s, Hamilton and the remains of his family were moved and reinterred in a mausoleum located at Christ Church. On August 6, two days after Hamilton&#x27;s death, Benjamin Franklin published in his &quot;Pennsylvania Gazette&quot; an editorial of appreciation for the attorney and politician.

==Family and descendants==

During the early years after his marriage, his wife Anne had several children. Margaret Hamilton, their first child, was born in 1709. Circa 1711, Hamilton&#x27;s second child and first son James Hamilton was born; he went on to become a mayor of Philadelphia and a governor of the Pennsylvania colony. The Hamilton Watch Company was named after Andrew Hamilton, the owner of the Hamilton Watch Complex site in Lancaster. In 1713, Hamilton&#x27;s last son, also named Andrew Hamilton, was born.

On February 16, 1734, Margaret Hamilton married William Allen, a mayor of Philadelphia who founded Allentown, Pennsylvania. William and Margaret had six children together. Andrew Hamilton had a close working relationship with his son-in-law. They both worked in the Philadelphia and Pennsylvania governments. Along with James Hamilton, they acquired the land for the state house, now Independence Hall, and its surrounding yard.

Andrew Hamilton the younger married Mary Till on December 24, 1741. She was the daughter of William Till, a businessman of the landed gentry in Pennsylvania and Delaware, and Mary Till, née Lillingston, the step-granddaughter of Berkeley Codd. He was the attorney in Delaware whom the elder Andrew Hamilton faced in court in 1712. Andrew Hamilton II and Mary Till Hamilton had two sons, Andrew and William Hamilton.

==Legacy==
During World War II, a Liberty ship was commissioned the SS &quot;Andrew Hamilton&quot; in Hamilton&#x27;s honor.

<doc id="775143" wikidata="Q1340655" url="?curid=775143" title="Lead climbing">
<text>Lead climbing (or leading) is a technique in rock climbing where the &#x27;lead climber&#x27; clips their rope to the climbing protection as they ascend a pitch of the climbing route, while their &#x27;second&#x27; (or &#x27;belayer&#x27;) remains at the base of the route belaying the rope to protect the &#x27;lead climber&#x27; in the event that they fall. The term is used to distinguish between the two roles, and the greater effort and increased risk, of the role of the &#x27;lead climber&#x27;.

Leading a climb is in contrast with top roping a climb, where even though there is still a &#x27;second&#x27; belaying the rope, the &#x27;lead climber&#x27; faces little or no risk in the event of a fall and does not need to clip into any protection as the rope is already anchored to the top of the route (i.e. if they fall off, they just hang from the rope). Leading a climbing route is a core activity in rock climbing, and most first ascents and first free ascents are from leading.

Lead climbing can be performed as free climbing, in either a traditional climbing or a sport climbing format — leading a traditional climb is a much riskier and physically demanding exercise for the climber. Competition lead climbing is a sport climbing format that is part of the Olympic sport of competition climbing. Lead climbing can also be performed as aid climbing. The term is not generally applied to free solo climbing, as the free solo climber is already alone and thus there is no need to distinguish the role of &#x27;leader&#x27; from the &#x27;second&#x27;. 

== Description ==
Leading a route requires a &#x27;lead climbing pair&#x27;. When ascending a route, the &#x27;lead climber&#x27; of the pair clips their rope into the climbing protection as they progress up a pitch on a given climbing route. If they are leading a traditional climbing route, the &#x27;lead climber&#x27; must arrange and insert &#x27;temporary climbing protection&#x27; as they climb. If they are leading a sport climbing route, the climbing protection is already installed via pre-drilled bolts, into which the &#x27;lead climber&#x27; only needs to attach quickdraws. Leading a traditional route is, therefore, a much riskier and physically demanding undertaking than leading a sport climbing route of the same grade.

Aside from the specific additional risks of traditional climbing, every &#x27;lead climber&#x27; faces the specific risk of falling &quot;twice the distance&quot; to their last point of climbing protection — i.e. if the &#x27;lead climber&#x27; was 3-metres above their last point of protection, then in a fall, they will fall over 6-metres, thus the rope starts to brake 3-metres &quot;below&quot; their last point of protection. This aspect makes leading a more physically demanding activity than top roping where the lead climber is immediately held by the top-rope upon falling.

Leading a climb also requires good communication between the &#x27;lead climber&#x27; and the &#x27;second&#x27; who is belaying. In particular, the &#x27;lead climber&#x27; will want to avoid the &#x27;second&#x27; holding the rope too tightly, which creates &quot;rope drag&quot; that acts as a downward force on the &#x27;lead climber&#x27;. However, where the &#x27;lead climber&#x27; feels that a fall is imminent, they will want the &#x27;second&#x27; to quickly &quot;take in&quot; any slack in the rope to minimize the length of any fall. Once the &#x27;lead climber&#x27; has reached the top of the route (or pitch on a multi-pitch climbing route), they will then create a fixed anchor and belay the &#x27;second&#x27; from above as the &#x27;second&#x27; climbs up, removing any temporary climbing protection that the &#x27;leader&#x27; had inserted earlier; note that the &#x27;second&#x27; is not themselves &#x27;lead climbing&#x27; but are in effect, top roping (e.g. if they fall they will just hang from the rope).

===First ascent===

The act, and drive, to &quot;lead&quot; a climb is related to the definition of what is a first ascent (FA), or first free ascent (FFA) in the traditional and sport climbing formats. The grades assigned to traditional and sport climbing routes are based on the climber &quot;leading&quot; the route, and not top roping it. If a climber wants to test themselves at a specific technical grade or set a new grade milestone, then they must &quot;lead&quot; the route.

Before the arrival of sport climbing in the early-1980s, traditional climbers frowned upon FFAs where the &#x27;lead climber&#x27; had practiced the route beforehand on a top rope (called headpointing), or worse still, practiced the crux moves from a hanging fixed rope (called hangdogging). The arrival of sport climbing led to the development of the redpoint as the accepted definition of an FFA, which includes the practices of headpointing and hangdogging. Where a &#x27;lead climber&#x27; can complete a route first-time and without any prior knowledge, it is called an onsight (or a flash if they had prior knowledge) and this is still considered the most desirable form of ascent, and is separately recorded in grade milestones and climbing guidebooks.

==Risk==

Aside from the specific risks involved in placing the temporary protection equipment while leading traditional climbing routes (i.e. and making sure that it won&#x27;t fall out in the event of a fall), the &#x27;lead climber&#x27; needs to manage several other general risks when they are leading a climbing route, such as:

* Runout is the distance from the &#x27;lead climber&#x27; to the last point of protection. In any fall, the &#x27;lead climber&#x27; will fall &quot;at least&quot; twice the distance of the runout (and sometimes more if the climbing rope has to flex, or if the belayer does not immediately grip the rope tight and lets more rope &#x27;pay-out&#x27;). The greater the runout, the greater the total distance in any fall, and the greater the mental pressure on the climber. Some leads involve runouts where any fall could result in a &quot;ground-fall&quot; (or the leader &quot;hitting the deck&quot;).
* Hitting obstacles during falls. Ironically, extreme climbing routes tend to be very overhanging (e.g. &quot;Realization&quot; or &quot;Silence&quot;), and thus where a &#x27;lead climber&#x27; falls, they naturally avoid hitting any obstacles on the way down, until the rope holds. In contrast, on easier climbing routes, there is a greater chance of the &#x27;lead climber&#x27; hitting against obstacles on the rock face as they fall, thus causing serious injury.
* Back-clipping is where the rope is clipped into a quickdraw in such a way that the leader&#x27;s end runs &quot;underneath&quot; the quickdraw carabiner as opposed to over the top of it; if the leader falls, the rope may fold directly over the carabiner gate, causing it to open with catastrophic consequences.
* Z-clipping is where the &#x27;lead climber&#x27; grabs the rope below an already clipped quickdraw and clips it into the next quickdraw, resulting in a &quot;zig-zag&quot; shape of the rope on the wall, which can create immense rope drag making further progress impossible until it is fixed.
* Turtling is where one of the &#x27;lead climber&#x27;s&#x27; limbs is &quot;behind&quot; the rope when they fall, which can result in the climber being &quot;flipped&quot; upside down (i.e. like a turtle on its back), which can then eject the climber from their harness, which is a serious event.

==Equipment==
Regardless of the particular type of format that the &#x27;lead climber&#x27; is undertaking (i.e. traditional, sport, or aid), they will require a harness attached to one end of a dynamic kernmantle rope (usually via a figure-eight knot). Their &#x27;second&#x27;—who will be belaying—will use a mechanical belay device that is clipped into the climbing rope and which &#x27;pays-out&#x27; the rope as needed as the &#x27;lead climber&#x27; ascends the route, but which can immediately grip the rope tightly in the event that the &#x27;lead climber&#x27; falls.

Where the &#x27;lead climber&#x27; is following a traditional climbing format, they will need to carry an extensive range of protective equipment (often referred to as a &#x27;climbing rack&#x27; and is usually worn around the waist being attached to the climbing harness) such as nuts, hexcentrics and tricams (known as &quot;passive&quot; protection), and/or spring-loaded camming devices (or &quot;friends&quot;, and known as &quot;active protection&quot;). Where the &#x27;lead climber&#x27; is following a sport climbing format, they only need to carry quickdraws (which they will also attach to their climbing harness) that they will clip into the pre-drilled bolts along the sport route.

Some indoor climbing walls provide in-situ mechanical lead auto belay devices enablig the climber to lead the route but belayed by the device. Typical versions belay the lead climber from above so the climber is essentially top roping the route, and does not need to carry any climbing protection.

== Multi-pitch leading==

Longer climbing routes (e.g. as in big wall climbing), are usually led in series of multiple pitches of circa in length. In multi-pitch leading, the two climbers can swap the roles of &#x27;lead climber&#x27; and &#x27;second&#x27; on successive pitches. The &#x27;second&#x27; needs to be comfortable working from a hanging belay, and both need to be familiar with the process for swapping between roles safely and efficiently. Given that average pitch length will be longer, and that the weather potentially poorer, both climbers need to communicate clearly, and know the climbing commands.

On long but easier routes, the climbing pair may use simul climbing, whereby both climbers &quot;simultaneously&quot; ascend the route. The &#x27;lead climber&#x27; acts like on a normal lead climb, however, the &#x27;second&#x27; does not remain belaying in a static position, but instead also climbs, removing/unclipping the protection equipment of the &#x27;lead climber&#x27;. Both climbers are tied to the rope at all times, and both make sure that there are several points of protection in situ between them. Simul climbing is performed on terrain both climbers are comfortable on, as any fall is serious; often the stronger climber goes second.

== Competition lead climbing ==
The arrival of the safer format of sport climbing in the early 1980s led to a rapid development in the related sport of competition lead climbing. The first major international lead climbing competition was held in Italy at Sportroccia in 1985. By the late 1990s, competitive lead climbing was joined by competition bouldering, and competition speed climbing in what was to become the annual IFSC Climbing World Cup and biennial IFSC Climbing World Championships. Competition lead climbing first appeared as an event in the 2020 Summer Olympics for men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s medal events; it was structured in a format consisting of a single &quot;combined&quot; event of lead, bouldering and speed climbing.

<doc id="775161" wikidata="Q1037567" url="?curid=775161" title="Ballet technique">
<text>Ballet technique is the foundational principles of body movement and form used in ballet. It is an important aspect of ballet performance because ballet (especially classical ballet) puts great emphasis on the method and execution of movement. The techniques found in classical ballet are a framework for many other styles of dance, including jazz and contemporary ballet.

Aspects of ballet technique include alignment, which refers to keeping the head, shoulders, and hips vertically aligned. Turnout refers to completing movements with legs rotated outward; this promotes clean footwork, graceful &quot;port de bras&quot; (movement of the arms), and correct body positions, lines and angles. Other aspects of ballet technique include posture, toe pointing, keeping shoulders down, and pulling up, which combines proper posture and lifting of the muscles to increase turnout and enhance alignment and thus improve the quality of turns. Ballet technique is also used to exhibit &quot;ballon&quot;, the appearance of gravity-defying lightness, during leaps. Pointe technique is the part of ballet technique concerned with dancing on the tips of fully extended feet.

The core techniques of ballet are common throughout the world, though there are minor variations among the different styles of ballet. Together with stylistic differences, these variations produce an aesthetic and physicality of performance that is unique to each style. For example, Russian ballet exhibits high extensions and dynamic turns, whereas Italian ballet tends to be more grounded, with a focus on fast and intricate footwork.

==Training==

Ballet training places great emphasis on ballet technique because precise technique is an essential element of the aesthetics of ballet performance. Ballet technique is drilled into ballet students to develop the desired aesthetics and to prevent injury. For example, students are taught to avoid sickling of the foot, which is an undesirable aesthetic and can result in ankle injuries when performing &quot;en pointe&quot;.

The ballet barre is a tool for learning ballet technique. Barre work typically involves all elements of ballet technique except for the elements that are exclusive to jumps. It is possible to practice turning technique for fouettés and pirouettes at the barre.

==Applications==
* Petit allegro (meaning &quot;small and fast&quot;) movements comprise small jumps and fast, detailed footwork.
* Grand allegro (meaning &quot;big and fast&quot;) movements comprise technically challenging movements such as large jumps and leaps.

<text>Tire rotation is the practice of moving the wheels and tires of an automobile from one position to another, to ensure even tire wear. Even tire wear extends the useful life of a set of tires, but the value of this is disputed.

==Causes of uneven tire wear==

The differing weight placed on the tires by the front and rear axles causes uneven wear. With the majority of cars having the engine in front, the front tires typically bear more weight than the rear tires. Front-wheel drive vehicles have not only the engine but also the transaxle in front, adding to the weight difference. Moreover, additional stress is placed disproportionately on the front tires by braking and steering. Thus, tire rotation needs to occur more frequently for front-wheel drive vehicles.

Turning the vehicle will cause uneven tire wear. The outside, front tire is worn disproportionately. In countries with right-hand traffic, for example, right turns are tighter than left turns and most cloverleaf interchanges and parking ramps are right-hand curves, so the left front tire wears faster than the right front, because the left tire travels a greater distance around those turns (the same way that an athlete in the leftmost lane would have to run further around an oval track than one in the rightmost if the race were being run clockwise from a flat line start) and a majority of turns will be to the right. Conversely, the sidewalls on the right tire tends to be bumped and rubbed against the curb while parking the vehicle, causing asymmetric sidewall wear. The symmetric opposite occurs in countries that drive on the left.

In addition, mechanical problems in the vehicle may cause uneven tire wear. Wheels misaligned with each other and/or with the vehicle&#x27;s axis will tend to be dragged along by the other wheels, causing uneven wear in that tire. If the alignment is such that the vehicle tends to turn, the driver will correct by steering against the tendency. In effect the vehicle is constantly turning, causing uneven tire wear.

==Tire rotation practice==
Car and tire manufacturers may recommend tire rotation frequency and pattern, typically every 5,000 mi (≈8,000 km) to 8,000 mi (≈13,000 km) depending on the tire manufacturer and vehicle make to ensure even tire wear.

A common rotation pattern is to move the back wheels to the front, and the front to the back but crossing them when moving to the back. If the tires are unidirectional, the rotation can only be rotated front to back on the same side of the vehicle to preserve the rotational direction of the tires, unless they are remounted.

More complex rotation patterns are required if the vehicle has a full-size spare tire that is part of the rotation, or if there are snow tires.

==Alternative views== 
The benefits of achieving even tire wear, using rotation, are disputed. Some car manufacturers recommend against performing tire rotation, for example BMW. Many tire manufacturers say that tire rotation is no longer necessary, except to ensure that best tires are fitted at the rear of the vehicle. In practice this means that when the front tires become worn, the new ones should be fitted to the rear, moving the old rear tires to the front.

;Best tires on rear of vehicle
Maximum vehicle control is achieved with the best tires on the rear wheels of the vehicle, whether it is front- or rear-wheel drive. The reason for this is that if the rear wheels lose grip before the front ones, an oversteer condition will occur, which is harder to control than the corresponding understeer which will happen if a front wheel is lost. So the intuitive belief that the front steering/driving tires need to be the best quality is not the case.

This is also the case if a tire blows out. A rear tire blowout will cause the vehicle to become very difficult to control, especially at highway speeds. It also greatly increases the risk of rollover due to yawing, a condition where the rear of the vehicle swings out and becomes perpendicular to the direction of travel: yawing can cause the tire to separate from the rim, leading the rim to dig into the pavement, or dirt and grass if no longer on the road, which can trip the vehicle and cause its rollover.

<text>Jeremy Clayton Guscott (born 7 July 1965) is an English former rugby union player who played for Bath, England and the British Lions. Usually an outside centre, he also appeared for England on the wing.

On 17 November 2016, Guscott was inducted to the World Rugby Hall of Fame during the opening ceremonies for the Hall&#x27;s first physical location in Rugby, Warwickshire.

==Early life ==
Guscott was born in Bath, Somerset, one of the two sons of Jamaican hospital porter Henry Guscott and his English wife Sue. He was educated at Ralph Allen School. He played for Bath, his home city, throughout his career, most of which was during the amateur era. Guscott was originally a bricklayer, briefly drove buses for Badgerline in Bath, and worked for British Gas in a public-relations role before the game turned professional.

==Rugby career==
At club level Guscott played for Bath from 1984 to 2000, scoring 710 points in 266 appearances. He also started for Bath in the victorious 1998 Heineken Cup Final as they defeated Brive.

During the English off season in 1987, Guscott travelled to Australia and played for Wollongong Waratahs RFC in the Illawarra District Rugby Union competition.

Marking his England debut with a hat-trick of tries in the 58–3 win over Romania in Bucharest in May 1989, Guscott received a call-up for the in-progress British Lions tour of Australia, making a series-winning contribution in the second and third Tests. He also travelled to New Zealand in 1993 with the Lions, playing in all three Tests; though in this tour the Lions lost 2 matches to 1.

When Will Carling stepped down as England captain in 1996, Phil de Glanville was appointed his successor. As de Glanville was thereby guaranteed a place in the team, Carling was moved from inside centre to outside centre and Guscott was relegated to the bench. Such was Guscott&#x27;s talent and form at the time that even Carling noted in his autobiography that it was an extraordinary decision for then England Coach, Jack Rowell, to make. In the 1997 Five Nations, Guscott came off the bench to play on the wing in wins against Ireland and Wales.

Guscott toured with the British Lions in South Africa in 1997, where he scored the winning drop goal during the decisive second test. He started the third and final test in this series but broke his arm and could not finish the game.

His last game for England was against Tonga in a 1999 Rugby World Cup pool match at Twickenham, scoring a length-of-field try and receiving a standing ovation upon the game&#x27;s conclusion. An increasingly debilitating thigh injury forced Guscott to call time on his career and take an early exit from 1999 World Cup competition. England lost to South Africa, without him, in the quarter final. In all, Guscott represented England in three World Cups – 1991, 1995, and 1999 – helping England to an appearance in the 1991 final. He missed most of the 1994 international season through injury.

Guscott now works for the BBC as a pundit on their rugby programmes.

==Personal life==
Guscott is married to Saz, who is a psychologist. He has 3 daughters, Imogen, Holly and Saskia, from his previous marriage.

<text>Hoss&#x27;s Steak &amp; Sea House, Inc., doing business as Hoss&#x27;s Steak and Sea (commonly known as Hoss&#x27;s), is a restaurant chain based in Duncansville, Pennsylvania. , the company operates 29 locations in Pennsylvania and single West Virginia location. The restaurant is a well-known icon to the local economy and area and has hosted several local events including a Toys for Tots and classic car show charity event in 2009.

Hoss&#x27;s has also received news coverage participating in several Pennsylvania farm shows, and according to a 2001 news article, has spent about $200,000 a year.

== History ==
Hoss&#x27;s Steak and Sea House was founded in 1983 by Willard E. &quot;Bill&quot; Campbell with the first location in DuBois, Pennsylvania. Today, Campbell still serves as Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer of Hoss&#x27;s Steak and Sea House and his son, Craig, is the company&#x27;s planning and development director. His wife, Nancy, has also served as the company&#x27;s director of public relations for 24 years.

In addition to operating as a restaurant chain, in 1998, Hoss&#x27;s financed and built a new bathroom and storage facility in Delmont, Pennsylvania through a construction company Hoss&#x27;s owned.

In 2008, the restaurant chain was named &quot;Best Places to Work in PA&quot; by a group of various Pennsylvania-based organizations, making it the second consecutive year and the fourth time Hoss&#x27;s has made the list. In 2011, the Hoss&#x27;s location in Hummelstown was one of the businesses damaged by Tropical Storm Lee, flooded with more than six feet of water and was out of business for eight months.

In March 2013, Hoss&#x27;s was named the &quot;2013 Chain Operator&quot; in Beef Checkoff Program&#x27;s 2012 National Foodservice Beef Backer Awards. In May 2014, Hoss&#x27;s started a White House petition to name May 31 National Steak Day but did not get enough signatures.

== Controversy ==
In 1995, two Hoss&#x27;s waitresses sued the company after a cook skewered, mutilated and deep-fried a Barbie doll. In the lawsuit, the waitresses recalled the events that took place in September 1994 including accusing the managers of fondling them, employees discussing sexual encounters and obscenities and other sexual and inappropriate behavior. They accused the restaurant of not regularly changing the cooking oil including after the Barbie doll incident. One of the waitresses also accused a manager of demoting and eventually firing her after she complained. The lawsuit went to trial in federal court in 1998 and, according to a 2000 book, the jury ruled in favor of Hoss&#x27;s though other details about the case have not been found.

In 2007, Hoss&#x27;s received significant attention from state and international news sources after an E. coli outbreak from the restaurant’s meat supplier sickened several people at different locations. As a result, the meat supplier, HFX, recalled 259,230 lbs. of meat as a precaution.

== Design ==
The restaurant has received news coverage for its walls decorated with antique American newspapers, photos and objects, especially those local to the area including an Erie newspaper&#x27;s front page story of Victory over Japan Day in 1945. The original architectural design was done by Donald R. Langer, A.I.A., P.E. of Altoona, Pennsylvania.

<doc id="775214" wikidata="Q202949" url="?curid=775214" title="Transept">
<text>A transept (with two semitransepts) is a transverse part of any building, which lies across the main body of the building. In cruciform (&quot;cross-shaped&quot;) churches, in particular within the Romanesque and Gothic Christian church architectural traditions, a transept is an area set crosswise to the nave. Each half of a transept is known as a semitransept.

==Description==
The transept of a church separates the nave from the sanctuary, apse, choir, chevet, presbytery, or chancel. The transepts cross the nave at the crossing, which belongs equally to the main nave axis and to the transept. Upon its four piers, the crossing may support a spire (e.g., Salisbury Cathedral), a central tower (e.g., Gloucester Cathedral) or a crossing dome (e.g., St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral). Since the altar is usually located at the east end of a church, a transept extends to the north and south. The north and south end walls often hold decorated windows of stained glass, such as rose windows, in stone tracery.

Occasionally, the basilicas and the church and cathedral planning that descended from them were built without transepts; sometimes the transepts were reduced to matched chapels. More often, the transepts extended well beyond the sides of the rest of the building, forming the shape of a cross. This design is called a Latin cross ground plan, and these extensions are known as the &quot;arms&quot; of the transept. A Greek cross ground plan, with all four extensions the same length, produces a central-plan structure.

When churches have only one transept, as at Pershore Abbey, there is generally a historical disaster, fire, war or funding problem, to explain the anomaly. At Beauvais only the chevet and transepts stand; the nave of the cathedral was never completed after a collapse of the daring high vaulting in 1284. At St. Vitus Cathedral, Prague, only the choir and part of a southern transept were completed until a renewed building campaign in the 19th century.
==Other senses of the word==
The word &quot;transept&quot; is occasionally extended to mean any subsidiary corridor crossing a larger main corridor, such as the cross-halls or &quot;transepts&quot; of The Crystal Palace, London, of glass and iron that was built for the Great Exhibition of 1851. 

In a metro station or similar construction, a transept is a space over the platforms and tracks of a station with side platforms, containing the bridge between the platforms. Placing the bridge in a transept rather than an enclosed tunnel allows passengers to see the platforms, creating a less cramped feeling and making orientation easier.

<text>Lori Petty (born October 14, 1963) is an American actress, director, and screenwriter. She made her big screen debut appearing in the 1990 comedy film &quot;Cadillac Man&quot; and later starred in films &quot;Point Break&quot; (1991), &quot;A League of Their Own&quot; (1992), &quot;Free Willy&quot; (1993), &quot;In the Army Now&quot; (1994), &quot;The Glass Shield&quot; (1994) and played the title role in &quot;Tank Girl&quot; (1995). She created and starred in the short-lived Fox sitcom &quot;Lush Life&quot; in 1996 and acted in number of 
independent movies in her later career.

In 2008, Petty wrote and directed independent drama film &quot;The Poker House&quot; based on her early life during the 1970s. In 2014 she joined the Netflix comedy-drama series, &quot;Orange Is the New Black&quot; as Lolly Whitehill as a guest star in the second season, and a recurring character in the third, fourth and seventh seasons.

==Early life==
Petty, the eldest of three children, was born in Chattanooga, Tennessee, the daughter of a Pentecostal minister. She had a difficult upbringing after her mother left her abusive father and became addicted to drugs and became a sex worker, which left the young Petty responsible for her younger sisters. Petty graduated from North High School in Sioux City, Iowa in 1981. She worked in Omaha, Nebraska as a graphic designer for several years before pursuing acting.

==Career==
Petty got her break playing a terrorist named Skunk on the ABC daytime soap opera &quot;All My Children&quot; in 1985. She later made guest starring appearances on television series such as &quot;The Equalizer&quot;, &quot;The Twilight Zone&quot;, &quot;Head of the Class&quot;, &quot;Miami Vice&quot; and &quot;Freddy&#x27;s Nightmares&quot;. In 1987 she starred in the made-for-television horror film &quot;Bates Motel&quot;. The following year she appeared in the made-for-television movie &quot;Police Story: Monster Manor&quot;, and was regular cast member in the short-lived comedy series, &quot;The Thorns&quot;. In 1989, Petty co-starred in the made-for-television movie &quot;Perry Mason: The Case of the Musical Murder&quot; and from 1989 to 1990 was regular cast member in the Fox crime drama, &quot;Booker&quot;.

In 1990, Petty made her film debut as Robin Williams&#x27;s wannabe fashion designer girlfriend in the dark comedy &quot;Cadillac Man&quot;. The following year, Petty played the surfer who taught Keanu Reeves how to surf in the 1991 action thriller &quot;Point Break&quot; directed by Kathryn Bigelow. In 1992, Petty starred in the sports comedy-drama film, &quot;A League of Their Own&quot; directed by Penny Marshall starring opposite Tom Hanks, Geena Davis, and Madonna. The film was a critical and commercial success, grossing over $132.4 million worldwide. The following year she went to star in the family drama film &quot;Free Willy&quot;. Released on July 16, 1993, the film received positive attention from critics and was a commercial success, grossing $153.7 million from a $20 million budget. Later that year, Petty had supporting role in the romantic drama film &quot;Poetic Justice&quot; directed by John Singleton. In 1994 she starred in the police drama film &quot;The Glass Shield&quot;. It received positive reviews but was released only in selected theaters. Also in 1994, Petty starred in the comedy film &quot;In the Army Now&quot;. It was universally panned by critics but grossed $28,881,266 at the box office. 

In 1995, Petty played the title role in &quot;Tank Girl&quot;, an adaptation of the British cult comic book of the same name, directed by Rachel Talalay. Financially unsuccessful, &quot;Tank Girl&quot; recouped only about $6 million of its $25 million budget at the box office and received mixed reviews from critics. Despite the box-office failure of the film, it has since become a cult classic and has been noted for its feminist themes. The following year, Petty returned to television starring and creating the short-lived sitcom &quot;Lush Life&quot; with her friend Karyn Parsons, but it was canceled after five episodes. She went to star in smaller-scale thriller films &quot;Countdown&quot; (1996), &quot;The Arrangement&quot; (1999), &quot;Firetrap&quot; (2001), and &quot;Route 666&quot; (2001). She also was featured in the independent films &quot;Relax... It&#x27;s Just Sex&quot; (1998), &quot;Clubland&quot; (1999), &quot;MacArthur Park&quot; (2001), and &quot;Prey for Rock &amp; Roll&quot; (2003). In 2001, she made her directorial debut with the drama film &quot;Horrible Accident&quot;.

Petty made guest-starring appearances in a number of television series, include &quot;Profiler&quot;, &quot;Star Trek: Voyager&quot;, &quot;ER&quot; and &quot;NYPD Blue&quot;. She starred in a series of television commercials created by Merkley Newman Harty&#x27;s Steve Bowen for the National Thoroughbred Racing Association&#x27;s &quot;Go, Baby, Go&quot; advertising campaign in 1998. Petty also provided the voice of the supervillain Livewire on the Warner Bros. series &quot;&quot;, &quot;The New Batman Adventures,&quot; and the video game &quot;.&quot; Although she was originally cast as Lt. Lenina Huxley in &quot;Demolition Man&quot;, disagreements over the character&#x27;s direction led producer Joel Silver to recast the role with Sandra Bullock. From 1998 to 1999 she had the recurring role on &quot;Brimstone&quot; as the owner of Stone&#x27;s hotel. She narrated the first three books of Janet Evanovich&#x27;s Stephanie Plum series—&quot;One for the Money&quot;, &quot;Two for the Dough&quot;, and &quot;Three to Get Deadly&quot; in 2002. C. J. Critt read the unabridged version for Recorded Books. Petty read the abridgments for Simon &amp; Schuster. In 2006 she starred in &quot;The Fair Haired Child&quot;, the episode of Showtime horror-anthology series, &quot;Masters of Horror&quot;. She had the recurring role as Janice Burke, a woman with Huntington&#x27;s disease, in the Fox series, &quot;House&quot; from 2008 to 2009, and the following year played the role of &quot;Daddy&quot;, an alpha female inmate, in &quot;Prison Break&quot; and its spin-off movie, &quot;Prison Break: The Final Break&quot;.

Petty directed and wrote the 2008 independent drama film &quot;The Poker House&quot;a film dramatizing her own difficult childhoodwon awards at the Los Angeles Film Festival. it starred Jennifer Lawrence, Selma Blair and Chloë Grace Moretz. The film received mixed reviews from critics. 

In 2014, Petty was cast as Lolly Whitehill, an inmate with an interest in conspiracy theories in the Netflix comedy-drama series, &quot;Orange Is the New Black&quot;. She was a guest star in the second season, and a recurring character in the third, fourth and seventh seasons appearing total in 24 episodes. Along with cast she received Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by an Ensemble in a Comedy Series in 2016 and 2017. She also made guest-starring appearances on &quot;Gotham&quot;, &quot;Hawaii Five-0&quot; and &quot;Swedish Dicks&quot;. She appeared in horror films &quot;Dead Awake&quot; (2016), &quot;A Deadly Legend&quot; (2020) and &quot;You&#x27;re All Gonna Die&quot; (2023). In 2021, she starred in the HBO miniseries &quot;Station Eleven&quot;.

<doc id="775222" wikidata="Q828203" url="?curid=775222" title="Berti Vogts">
<text>Hans-Hubert &quot;Berti&quot; Vogts (; born 30 December 1946) is a German former professional footballer who played as a defender. He played for Borussia Mönchengladbach in the Bundesliga his whole professional club career and won the FIFA World Cup with West Germany in 1974. He later managed the national teams of Germany (winning Euro 96), Scotland, Nigeria and Azerbaijan.

==Club career==
Vogts joined the boys&#x27; football team of local sports club VfR Büttgen in 1954, at the age of seven, staying with them until his transfer in 1965 to Borussia Mönchengladbach. A right back, his tenacity earned him the nickname &quot;Der Terrier&quot;.

He was one of the key players, along with Rainer Bonhof, Herbert Wimmer, Uli Stielike, Allan Simonsen and Jupp Heynckes, during Borussia&#x27;s golden years in the 1970s, when it won the Bundesliga five times, the German Cup once, and the UEFA Cup twice. Vogts also played in the 1977 European Cup Final defeat by Liverpool.

Vogts made 419 Bundesliga appearances for Mönchengladbach, scoring 32 times, and also appeared 64 times for the club in European competition, scoring eight goals. Vogts remained with Mönchengladbach, until he retired from playing in 1979.

==International career==

Vogts played nine international boys&#x27; games for West Germany, made three appearances for the under 23s team, and has 96 senior caps, making him one of Germany&#x27;s most capped players. He was captain for twenty of the senior games, scored one international goal and was also a member of the Germany national team that won the 1974 World Cup.

Nicknamed &quot;Der Terrier&quot; for always fighting for every ball as if it were his last, Vogts was a big favourite with his home crowd. Vogts famously marked, and subdued, Johan Cruyff, in the final of the 1974 World Cup in Munich, West Germany, won by West Germany 2–1.

During the match between West Germany and Austria on 21 June 1978, in the second round of the 1978 FIFA World Cup, he scored an own goal, allowing Austria to beat West Germany for the first time in 47 years, and preventing West Germany from moving on to the next round. In Austria, this match is fondly known as the Miracle of Córdoba.

==Managerial career==
===West Germany and Germany===
After his playing career ended, Vogts became coach of the West Germany under 21 national team, and continued in that role until 1990. Starting in 1986, he became an assistant manager of the senior national side. He was promoted to manager of Germany in August 1990, succeeding Franz Beckenbauer.

After winning the 1990 FIFA World Cup Final the month before, Beckenbauer famously said that the reunified Germany will &quot;probably be unbeatable for years&quot;, a statement which turned out to be a burden for Vogts during the upcoming years. Although Vogts led the Germany national team to a Euro 1992 runner up finish and winning the next Euros in 1996, two World Cup quarter-final defeats in 1994 and 1998 are also on his sheet. He stepped down as manager in September 1998.

===Bayer Leverkusen===
In November 2000, after some time out of managing, he was appointed manager of Bayer Leverkusen. The following May, despite earning Bayer Leverkusen qualification for the Champions League, he was sacked.

===Kuwait===
Three months later, in August 2001, he became manager of the Kuwait national team.

===Scotland===
Vogts resigned his position with Kuwait in January 2002, after six months in the post, to assume a similar position with the Scotland national team. In qualifying for UEFA Euro 2004, Vogts took Scotland to a play off place, finishing second in their group to Germany. In the playoffs, Scotland were drawn against the Netherlands and Vogts led them to a 1–0 victory at Hampden Park, but the Netherlands beat Scotland 6–0 in the return leg.

The Scottish press became notably more hostile towards Vogts following a series of defeats in friendly matches. A 1–1 draw with Moldova in October 2004 essentially put paid to Scotland&#x27;s hopes of qualifying for the 2006 World Cup. Vogts resigned on 1 November, with a year and a half remaining on his contract, citing &quot;disgraceful abuse&quot;. Nine days after Vogts resigned, Scotland dropped to a record low of 77th place in the FIFA World Rankings.

===Nigeria===
In January 2007, Vogts was appointed manager of Nigeria, and signed a four-year contract. Nigeria were eliminated in the quarter finals of the 2008 African Nations Cup, which was their worst performance in the competition since 1982. Vogts resigned from his position in February 2008.

===Azerbaijan===

In April 2008, he was appointed manager of Azerbaijan, on a two-year contract. In December 2009, he extended his contract with AFFA until the end of qualifying for UEFA Euro 2012, after successful results. In March 2014, Vogts was appointed by Jürgen Klinsmann as a special advisor to the United States, for the 2014 World Cup.

In October 2014, he resigned from his position as Azerbaijan manager, after a 6–0 defeat against Croatia. Azerbaijan had lost all of their first three matches in UEFA Euro 2016 qualifying Group H. Under Vogts, Azerbaijan had some poor results, not being able to win against second string sides, forcing Vogts to face major criticism from local supporters and the media.

===United States===
In March 2015, Vogts was appointed by the United States national team as a technical advisor. After the dismissal of Jürgen Klinsmann, Vogts&#x27; employment also ended.

<doc id="775245" wikidata="Q956085" url="?curid=775245" title="Telephone jack and plug">
<text>A telephone jack and a telephone plug are electrical connectors for connecting a telephone set or other telecommunications apparatus to the telephone wiring inside a building, establishing a connection to a telephone network. The plug is inserted into its counterpart, the jack, which is commonly affixed to a wall or baseboard. The standards for telephone jacks and plugs vary from country to country, though the 6P2C style modular plug has become by far the most common type.

A connection standard, such as RJ11, specifies not only the physical aspects of an electrical connector, but also the signal definitions for each contact, and the pinout of the device, i.e. the assignment or function of each contact. Modular connectors are specified for the registered jack (RJ) series of connectors, as well as for Ethernet and other connectors, such as 4P4C (4 position, 4 contacts) modular connectors, the de facto standard on handset cords, often improperly referred to as &quot;RJ connectors&quot;.

==History==
Historically, telephones were typically owned by the telephone company, and were usually permanently wired to the telephone line. For some applications it was necessary or convenient to provide portable telephone sets that could be moved to a different location within the customer&#x27;s premises. For this purpose telephone companies developed jacks and plugs in various designs with various numbers of contacts. Before , concentric connectors with three contacts were usually sufficient, but the upgrade of telephone sets to anti-sidetone circuitry in the 1930s required at least four conductors between a desk set and the subscriber set that contained the telephone hybrid and a ringer. For this purpose, Bell System engineers developed a cube-shaped four-prong plug (type no. 283) with uneven prong spacings to avoid improper insertion into the jack.

The cubic design was changed to a round version (No. 505A) in the mid 1960s. The four-prong jack and plug combination was the standard line connection for all portable telephone sets until the conversion to modular jacks in the 1970s, typified by the Registered Jack standards promulgated in U.S. federal law.

Many countries initially used different specifications for connectors, and some national connector types remain in service, but few are used for new installations for which modular connector types are prescribed.

==Connections==
The installation of a conventional wired telephone set has four connection points, each of which may be hardwired, but more often use a plug and socket:
*telephone line to phone cord: The wall jack. This connection is the most standardized, and often regulated as the boundary between an individual&#x27;s telephone and the telephone network. In many residences, though, the boundary between utility-owned and household-owned cabling is a network interface on an outside wall known as the demarcation point; all wall jacks in the home are part of the household&#x27;s internal wiring.
*telephone cord to telephone set base: This connection is generally not regulated, but instead follows de facto standards. It is often a 6P4C connector, which is often RJ11, but may be proprietary or hardwired.
*telephone set base to handset cord: By de facto standard, this is usually a 4P4C connector. 
*handset cord to handset: The handset end of the straight-through handset cord also uses a 4P4C connector.

Some of these may be absent: Wired telephones may not have a separate base and handset. The defining characteristic of wireless telephones is that they do not have a handset cord, and the defining characteristic of mobile telephones is that they do not have a phone cord.

==Wiring==

A standard specifies both a physical connector and how it is wired. Sometimes the same connector is used by different countries but wired in different ways.

For example, telephone cables in the UK typically have a BS 6312 (UK standard) plug at the wall end and a 6P4C or 6P2C modular connector at the telephone end: this latter may be wired as per the RJ11 standard (with pins 3 and 4), or it may be wired with pins 2 and 5, as a straight-through cable from the BT plug (which uses pins 2 and 5 for the line, unlike RJ11, which uses pins 3 and 4). Thus cables are not in general compatible between different phones, as the phone base may have a socket with pins 2 and 5 (requiring a straight-through cable), or have an RJ11 socket (requiring a crossover cable).

When modular connectors are used, the latch release of the connector should be on the ridge side of flat phone wire in order to maintain polarity.

Though four wires are typically used in U.S. phone cabling, only two are necessary for telecommunication. In the event that a second line is needed, the other two are used. They are also sometimes used to provide power for telephone dial lamps (6 volts AC, as in the Princess phone), or other features.

==List of plugs==

===Modular connectors===
*4P4C and 4P2C for handset cables (often erroneously referred to as RJ9, RJ10, and RJ22)
*6P2C for RJ11 single telephone line
*6P4C for RJ14 two telephone lines
*6P6C for RJ25 three telephone lines
*8P8C for RJ61X four telephone lines, RJ48S and RJ48C for four-wire data lines, RJ31X single telephone line with equipment disconnect, RJ38X (similar to RJ31X but with continuity circuit)

===Other connectors===
*50-pin miniature ribbon connector for RJ21X, used for up to 25 lines for multiline phones such as the ITT 2564, key telephone systems such as the 1A2 Key System, and PBX systems.

===International standards===
* RJ11, by far the most common
* BS 6312, British
* F-010, French
* TAE connector, German

===National standards===
* TDO-connector, Austria
* WT-4, Polish and Eastern Bloc national standard, also adopted in Russia as ШТР-IV (SHTR-IV)
The Polish WT-4 plug is also adopted in the Eastern Bloc and Russia as ШТР-IV (SHTR-IV) and has four metal pins and an additional fourth dielectric pin. The corresponding socket comes in two variants. The GTN-4 socket (РТШ-IV (RTSH-IV) in Russia) provides a 4 pin connection (in most cases, the two rightmost pins are used for connecting a single line). The GTNC-4 (РТШК-IV, RTSHK-IV) is a GTN-4 socket that has an additional circuit. The 5th plastic pin of the inserted plug disconnects a 1μF capacitor that otherwise closes the circuit of the telephone line when the plug is not inserted. This feature allows testing the line when the phone is not plugged in. The usage of a capacitor is mostly obsolete and GTN-4 sockets produced later reuse the capacitor compartment for an additional RJ11 socket.

===Legacy===

* 600 series connector, Australia
* Protea, South Africa
* SS 455 15 50, Sweden and Iceland
* Telebrás plug, Brazil
* Tripolar plug, Italy
* BTicino 2021 (with or without line interruption), Italy (rare)
== List by country or territory ==

This list covers only single-line telephone plugs commonly used in homes and other small installations; there are 44 different variations of plugs, including an Israeli version of BS6312 with different internal wiring of the pins, plus hard wiring to a junction box with no adapter. Special telephone sets use a variety of special plugs, for example micro ribbon for key telephone systems.

<text>In ancient Egyptian religion, Neper (alts. Nepra or Nepri) was a god of grain. His female counterpart was Nepit, the goddess of grain. His consort may have been Tayt, the goddess of weaving.

==In myth==

Pictured in human form, Neper is often depicted as a child suckled by Renenutet. Neper&#x27;s body was dotted to represent grains. The hieroglyphs that write his name similarly include the symbols of grain. Naturally, as &quot;lord of the mouth&quot;, Neper&#x27;s mother was identified as Renenutet, who gave out the &quot;ren&quot;, a person&#x27;s true name, and who was also identified as a source of nourishment. In particular, Neper was especially associated with the most used types of grain, namely barley and emmer wheat. His name simply means &quot;lord of the mouth&quot;, a reference to the function of grain as sustenance. Once the myth of Osiris and Isis coalesced, since Osiris was a god of agriculture and the dead, his story was associated with the annual harvest and the annual disappearance of any visible life in the crop. Thus, at this point, Neper was considered merely an aspect of Osiris, a much more significant god, gaining the title &quot;(one who) lives after dying&quot;.

<text>The Reverse-Flash is a name used by several supervillains appearing in American comic books published by DC Comics. Each iteration of the character serves as a foil and an enemy of the Flash.

==Characters==

=== Edward Clariss ===
Edward Clariss (also known as the Rival and the Rival Flash) first appeared in &quot;Flash Comics&quot; #104 (February 1949), and was created by John Broome and Joe Kubert.

====Publication history====
Edward Clariss first appeared in Jay Garrick&#x27;s final appearance in &quot;Flash Comics&quot; #104 (February 1949), and was created by John Broome and Joe Kubert as an evil counterpart of Garrick during the Golden Age of Comic Books. He would be revived by Geoff Johns and David Goyer in a story called &quot;Injustice Be Done&quot; from the Justice Society of America comic books through the Modern Age of Comic Books.

====Fictional character biography====
Although not called the Reverse-Flash, Dr. Edward Clariss was a professor at the university attended by the Golden Age Flash, and had recreated the formula which was behind Jay Garrick&#x27;s speed. He hears Joan Williams (Garrick&#x27;s girlfriend) talking about how the Flash&#x27;s own speed was given to another student, which helped him develop the formula. Bitter at the scientific community&#x27;s rejection of his claims, Clariss becomes a criminal. A darker version of the Flash with a mask over his head, he gives the formula to other criminals. The Rival&#x27;s version of the formula is temporary, and he is captured and jailed (later stories have indicated a possible link between the Clariss formula and the Velocity 9 created by Vandal Savage, but thus far no such link has been conclusively proven).

&quot;JSA&quot; #16 (November 2000) contains a flashback to a battle between the Rival and the Flash several months after the former&#x27;s first appearance. Now that he has inexplicably regained super-speed, Clariss reaches light speed during the fight and vanishes into the Speed Force. After the Justice Society of America&#x27;s reformation 50 years later, Johnny Sorrow retrieves Clariss from the Speed Force and invites him to join the Injustice Society. Driven insane in the Speed Force, the Rival races across the country on a killing spree. The Flash realizes that the Rival&#x27;s path across the country spells out Clariss&#x27;s name and the final murder victim will be Joan; Jay absorbs the Rival&#x27;s speed before he can kill Joan.

The Rival returns in &quot;Impulse&quot; #88 (September 2002), posing as Joan&#x27;s doctor. Now pure speed energy, he possesses fellow Golden Age speedster Max Mercury. After battling Jay and Impulse, Max time-travels to an unknown destination. In &quot;The Flash: Rebirth&quot; #4, Max escapes from the Speed Force and is rejuvenated by Wally West&#x27;s energy; this allows him to return to Earth in a new body. Another Golden Age Reverse-Flash is a robot whose only appearance was in one panel of &quot;The Flash&quot; #134 (February 1998), where he is defeated by Garrick.

====Return====
After the events of &quot;Doomsday Clock&quot;, Clariss returned to continuity, having faced Garrick in the 40s.

===Eobard Thawne===

Professor Eobard Thawne (commonly known as Professor Zoom) first appeared in &quot;The Flash&quot; #139 (September 1963). The archenemy of Barry Allen, he is the first supervillain to be called the Reverse-Flash. While other speedsters cannot change the past without dramatic consequences, his ability to travel and manipulate time is able to drastically alter history and completely erase people from existence is due to having corrupted the Speed Force which created a negative version.

===Hunter Zolomon===

Hunter Zolomon (also known as Zoom) first appeared in &quot;The Flash: Secret Files &amp; Origins&quot; #3 (November 2001). The archenemy of Wally West, he is the second supervillain to be called the Reverse-Flash. Unlike all other speedsters, he did not gain his superspeed from the Speed Force but due to an accident with the Cosmic Treadmill where he was essentially &quot;derailed&quot; from the time line which allowed him to control the rate at which he moves in time and make him faster than any speedster.

===Thaddeus Thawne===

Thaddeus Thawne (a.k.a. Inertia and later Kid Zoom) first appeared in &quot;Impulse&quot; #51 (August 1999), and was created by Todd DeZago and Mike Wieringo. Another character called the Reverse-Flash, he is a clone of Bart Allen. Inertia first fought Impulse. When Bart aged five years after &quot;Infinite Crisis&quot; and became the Flash, Inertia fought his genetic template again. Inertia was responsible for Allen&#x27;s death; Wally West returned, taking revenge by paralyzing Inertia and imprisoning him in the Flash Museum. In &quot;Final Crisis: Rogues&#x27; Revenge&quot;, he is used by Libra and Zoom to try to get the Rogues to join the Secret Society. Inertia steals Zoom&#x27;s powers, calls himself Kid Zoom, and is killed by the Rogues, who blamed him for making them kill Bart.

When asked who created Inertia, Ethan van Sciver wrote that he could only accept five percent of the credit; the remaining credit belonged to Mike Wieringo (20 percent), Grant Morrison (25 percent) and Todd DeZago (50 percent). According to van Sciver, Inertia&#x27;s appearance is an inverted depiction of Impulse.

Inertia initially appeared in &quot;Impulse&quot; #50: &quot;First Fool&#x27;s&quot; (July 1999), followed by #51: &quot;It&#x27;s All Relative&quot; (August 1999). His greatest character development was in #53: &quot;Threats&quot; (October 1999). Inertia was not featured again until &quot;Impulse&quot; #62 and #66: &quot;Mercury Falling&quot; (July, November 2000), and again for another five years.

He then began making regular appearances, primarily due to Bart being the Flash. Inertia appeared in &quot;The Flash: The Fastest Man Alive&quot; #5: &quot;Lightning in a Bottle, Part 5&quot; (December 2006). In addition to his &quot;Flash&quot; appearances, he appeared in &quot;Teen Titans&quot; (vol. 3) as part of Titans East, an enemy team, beginning in &quot;Teen Titans&quot; (vol. 3) #43 (January 2007). The storyline concluded with (vol. 3) #46 (April 2007). Gathering the Rogues, he attempted to drain Bart&#x27;s powers for himself; the plan backfired when Wally returned and Inertia&#x27;s equipment drained the Speed Force, making the Rogues accidentally beat Bart to death. As Inertia tried to escape, he was captured by Wally who steals his speed, leaving him immobile.

Inertia is primarily a speedster, remaining disconnected from the Speed Force after &quot;Infinite Crisis&quot; and injecting himself with Velocity 9. Although Velocity 9 has been unstable, Deathstroke&#x27;s new variety seems to have no negative side effects. Inertia briefly shares his powers before his death with Zoom, who lends him his speed to pressure him into becoming a new Kid Flash. As the maddened Kid Zoom, he masters human time streams and reverts Zoom to the powerless Hunter Zolomon before he is killed by the Rogues.

Inertia was later resurrected due to Doctor Manhattan&#x27;s modifications on the timeline, but is currently trapped in the Speed Force. Inertia tries to stop Barry Allen, Max Mercury, and Jesse Quick from escaping the Speed Force, revealing that Eobard Thawne promised to release him and let him take over Bart Allen&#x27;s body once the former succeeded in his plans. After Barry tries to appeal and talk sense into him, Inertia stops his attacks and runs off.

===Daniel West===

Daniel &quot;Danny&quot; West first appeared in &quot;The Flash&quot; #0 (November 2012). The most recent individual to be called the Reverse-Flash, he is younger brother of Iris West, the biological father of Wallace West, and an enemy of Barry Allen.

==Other versions==
===Tangent Comics===

An original incarnation of the Reverse-Flash appears in &quot;Tangent Comics: The Flash&quot; #1 (December 1997). This version is an evil, negative ionic energy-based duplicate of her Earth&#x27;s Flash, Lia Nelson, who was created by an evil government agency to disperse Nelson&#x27;s photon-based form. However, Nelson destroys the Reverse-Flash.

===Impulse===
A 31st century incarnation of Thaddeus Thawne who became president appears in &quot;Impulse&quot; #25.

<text>Gordon John Garradd (born 1959) is an Australian amateur astronomer and photographer from Loomberah, New South Wales. He has discovered numerous asteroids and comets, including the hyperbolic comet C/2009 P1, and four novae in the Large Magellanic Cloud. The asteroid and Mars-crosser, 5066 Garradd, was named in his honour.

He has worked for a number of astronomical institutions in the US and Australia, most recently at Siding Spring Observatory on the Siding Spring Survey, part of the NASA-funded Catalina Sky Survey for near-Earth objects (2002–2011). , the Minor Planet Center credits him with the discovery of 31 minor planets &quot;(see table)&quot;. There are 16 comets and an asteroid that bear his name. His cometary discoveries include 186P/Garradd (comet Garradd 1), a Jupiter-family comet, and 259P/Garradd (comet Garradd 4), an Encke-type comet.

Garradd was born in Australia and lived his early life in Sydney, Canberra, Oberon, and Tamworth. Astronomy has been an interest since his childhood, and he has built many telescopes himself, starting with a 20 cm (8&quot;) f/7 Newtonian while still in high school, graduating to making mirrors up to 46 cm (18″) diameter and mounts up to the fork mount for the 46 cm f/5.4 Newtonian, and German equatorial mounted 25 cm (10&quot;) f/4.1 that he used for observing near-Earth asteroids and comets.

His initial profession was as an accountant, but he left that in 1984 to pursue astronomy and photography full-time. He lives with his wife Hether, off the power grid, using solar and wind power. He is a photographer, mountain bike rider, and solar- and wind-power enthusiast.

<doc id="775271" wikidata="Q3025632" url="?curid=775271" title="Tim Raines">
<text>Timothy Raines Sr. (born September 16, 1959), nicknamed &quot;Rock&quot;, is an American professional baseball coach and former player. He played as a left fielder in Major League Baseball for six teams from 1979 to 2002 and was best known for his 13 seasons with the Montreal Expos. A seven-time All-Star, four-time stolen base champion, and National League batting champion, Raines is regarded as one of the best leadoff hitters and baserunners in baseball history. In 2013, Raines began working in the Toronto Blue Jays organization as a roving outfield and baserunning instructor. In 2017, Raines was inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame.

==Early life==
Raines was born on September 16, 1959, in Sanford, Florida,
to Ned and Florence Raines. He attended Seminole High School in Sanford. Raines was one of seven children. Two of his brothers, Levi and Ned III, played minor league baseball. As a baseball player at Seminole, Raines stole home plate ten times. He also rushed for 1,000 yards in eight football games and set two school track and field records that lasted for several years. Raines reportedly received over 100 scholarship offers to play college football.

==Career==

===Montreal Expos===
The Montreal Expos selected Raines in the fifth round of the 1977 Major League Baseball draft. After debuting with six games as a pinch runner in 1979, he played briefly as a second baseman for the Expos in 1980 but soon switched to playing the outfield, and rapidly became a fan favorite due to his aggressiveness on the basepaths. In his strike-interrupted 1981 rookie season, he batted .304 and set a then Major League Baseball rookie record with 71 stolen bases, breaking the previous mark of 56 steals set by Gene Richards in 1977. Raines was caught stealing for the first time in 1981, after having begun his career with a then major league record 27 consecutive successful stolen bases. Raines was the runner-up for the National League&#x27;s Rookie of the Year Award in 1981, which was won by Los Angeles Dodgers pitcher Fernando Valenzuela.

Raines&#x27; performance dipped in 1982,
as he hit .277 with a .353 on-base percentage. At the end of the season, Raines entered treatment for substance abuse, having spent an estimated $40,000 that year on cocaine. To avoid leaving the drug in his locker, Raines carried it in his hip pocket, and slid headfirst when running the bases.
He used cocaine before games, in his car, after games, and on some occasions between innings in the clubhouse.
Raines would later testify at the Pittsburgh drug trials in September 1985.

In 1983, Raines stole a career high of 90 bases, the second-highest total in franchise history, and scored 133 runs, a franchise record. He was named Expos Player of the Year in 1983, 1985, and 1986. In each season from 1981 to 1986, Raines stole at least 70 bases. He had a career-high .334 batting average in 1986, winning the National League Batting Championship. Raines maintained a consistently high on-base percentage during this period and a rising slugging percentage, reaching a career peak of .429 in 1987. Although he never won a Gold Glove Award, Raines was an excellent defensive player who led the National League with 21 assists in 1983 and, with 4 double plays, tied for the league lead in double plays by an outfielder in 1985.

Raines became a free agent on November 12, 1986, but in spite of his league-leading play no team made a serious attempt to sign him (in a period when Major League Baseball owners colluded to keep salaries down). On May 1, 1987, hours after being permitted to negotiate again with Montreal, Raines signed a new deal with the Expos for $5 million over three years and a $900,000 signing bonus. In his first game back, on May 2, facing the Mets, although Raines had not participated in spring training or any other competitive preparation for the season, he hit the first pitch he saw off the right-field wall for a triple. Raines finished the game with four hits in five at-bats, three runs, one walk, a stolen base, and a game-winning grand slam in the 10th inning.
Even without having played in April, Raines led the Expos in runs, walks, times on base, runs created, and stolen bases, in addition to batting average, on-base percentage, and slugging percentage. He also garnered MVP honors in the All-Star Game as he delivered a game-winning triple in the 13th inning. Raines would, in 1992, be one of dozens of players retroactively awarded collusion damages, receiving over $865,000.

===Post-Expos career===
The Expos traded Raines to the Chicago White Sox on December 20, 1990, along with Jeff Carter and a player to be named later (PTBNL), later identified as Mario Brito, in exchange for Iván Calderón and Barry Jones. Raines later admitted he left Montreal because he wanted to win a World Series and did not believe the Expos &quot;had what it took&quot;.
In his first season in the American League, Raines hit for a .268 average but with a .359 on-base percentage; he was second on the team in runs scored as the White Sox finished the season in second place in the American League Western Division. His average improved in 1992 to .294 with a .380 on-base percentage. In 1993, despite missing nearly six weeks in April and May due to a torn ligament in his thumb he sustained while stealing a base, he managed to hit .306 with 16 home runs as the White Sox won the American League Western Division title. In the 1993 American League Championship Series against the Toronto Blue Jays, Raines posted a .444 batting average and scored five runs in a losing cause.

On December 28, 1995, the White Sox traded Raines to the New York Yankees for future considerations; in February 1996, the teams agreed on Blaise Kozeniewski as the return. With the Yankees, Raines received two World Series rings in 1996 and 1998. While his playing time was curtailed due to injuries, he contributed to a loose clubhouse atmosphere,
and was productive when he came up to the plate. With the Yankees, Raines stole his 800th base on June 10, 1998.

In January 1999, Raines signed as a free agent with the Oakland Athletics. After a kidney biopsy on July 23, Raines was diagnosed with lupus and spent the rest of the year undergoing treatment and recovery.

===Recovery and return===
Raines was signed by the Yankees as a free agent on February 1, 2000, but was released on March 23. On December 21, Raines was signed by the Expos. At the Expos home opener in 2001, Raines received what he described as the longest and loudest standing ovation in his entire career, resulting in the pitcher walking him on four pitches. With limited playing time, Raines batted .308, with a .433 on-base percentage and a .436 slugging percentage. That same year, he was inducted into the team&#x27;s Hall of Fame.

Raines underwent surgery on May 31 due to a left shoulder strain, and spent time rehabilitating with the Expos Triple-A club, the Ottawa Lynx. On August 21, 2001, Raines and his son, Tim Raines Jr., became the first father-son pair to play against each other in an official professional baseball game, when the Lynx played the Rochester Red Wings (the two had faced each other earlier in the year during spring training).
Raines returned to the major league club on August 22.

On October 3, the Expos traded Raines to the Baltimore Orioles, thereby permitting Raines to play in a major league game with his son.
On October 4, Raines Jr. played center field and Raines Sr. played left field for Baltimore, becoming the second father and son team to play for the same major league team (a feat previously accomplished by Ken Griffey Sr. and Ken Griffey Jr.).

Raines played his last season in 2002 with the Florida Marlins. He is one of only 29 players in baseball history to date to have appeared in Major League baseball games in four decades, was the last active player who was involved with the Pittsburgh drug trials, and also the last MLB batter to wear a batting helmet with no ear flap. (Julio Franco, who retired in 2007, was also eligible to wear a batting helmet with no ear flap, but preferred not to do so.)

==Career statistics==

In a 23-year career, Raines played in 2,502 games accumulating 2,605 hits in 8,872 at bats for a .294 career batting average along with 170 home runs, 980 runs batted in, a .385 on-base percentage and a .425 slugging percentage. He ended his career with a .987 fielding percentage. Raines stole at least 70 bases in each of his first six full seasons (1981–1986), leading the National League in stolen bases each season from 1981 to 1984, with a career high of 90 steals in 1983. Raines also led the National League in runs scored twice (1983 and 1987). Raines batted over .300 in five full seasons and over .320 from 1985 to 1987, winning the 1986 National League batting title with a .334 average. He also had six full seasons with an on-base percentage above .390.

With 808 steals in his career, Raines has the fourth-highest total in major league history, behind Rickey Henderson, Lou Brock and Ty Cobb. Some sources, such as Baseball Reference, also place Raines behind Billy Hamilton, who recorded over 900 steals from 1888 to 1901; however, nearly 800 of these were achieved prior to 1898, when the definition of a steal was altered, and these early steals are not officially recognized. Raines&#x27;s career stolen base percentage (84.7%) was the highest in major league history for players with 300 or more attempts, until he was surpassed by Carlos Beltrán with an 86.4% success rate. (Note that caught stealing data is incomplete prior to the 1951 season.) Raines set an American League records of 40 consecutive successful steal attempts between July 1993 and August 1995 (the record was broken by Ichiro Suzuki in May 2007, when he completed 45 consecutive steals).

Among switch hitters, Raines ranks sixth in career hits (2,605), fourth in runs (1,571), walks (1,330) and times on base (3,977), fifth in plate appearances (10,359), seventh in singles (1,892), doubles (430), total bases (3,771) and at bats (8,872), eighth in triples (113) and tenth in extra base hits (713). He held the Expos/Washington Nationals franchise records for career runs (947) until May 22, 2021, when Ryan Zimmerman scored his 948th run for the franchise. Raines holds the Nationals/Expos franchise records for steals (635), singles (1,163), triples (82) and walks (793), and was the seventh player whose career began after 1945 to retire with over 1,500 runs and 100 triples. His 1,966 games in left field ranked seventh in major league history when he retired.

From 1983 to 1987, Total Baseball rated him as one of the National League&#x27;s five best players each season. He is also listed as the 40th greatest non-pitcher in major-league history according to Bill James&#x27;s win shares formula, one place ahead of Mark McGwire.

==Honors and awards==
Raines was a National League All-Star in 7 consecutive seasons (1981–1987), and was named the Most Valuable Player of the 1987 All-Star Game.

In 1981, &quot;The Sporting News&quot; named Raines the National League Rookie of the Year.

Raines finished in the top 10 in voting for the NL Most Valuable Player Award three times (1983, 1986, 1987). He won a Silver Slugger Award as an outfielder in 1986 when he led the National League in both batting average and on-base percentage.

In 2013, Raines was elected into the Canadian Baseball Hall of Fame.

On January 18, 2017, Raines was elected to the National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum. He was formally inducted on July 30. His plaque depicts him in an Expos cap.

The baseball complex at Seminole High School in Sanford, Florida, Raines&#x27; alma mater, has been renamed Tim Raines Athletic Park in his honor, and Raines&#x27; number 22 has been retired at the school. Raines was also gifted a ceremonious key to the city of Sanford in March 2019, and the Sanford Historical Museum dedicated an exhibit to Raines, filling it with memorabilia from his career.

==National Baseball Hall of Fame==
Raines was elected to the Hall of Fame in 2017, appearing on 86.0% of ballots cast. He was eligible for election to the Baseball Hall of Fame in January 2008, and various sabermetricians and commentators had supported his induction prior to his being elected in 2017.

==Coaching career==
Raines began his coaching career in 2003 as manager of the Class A-Advanced Brevard County Manatees affiliate of the Expos. He was promoted to the major league team in 2004 and was present for the Expos&#x27; final games as a Montreal franchise.

He was a coach for the White Sox from November 2004 until October 2006. During the 2005 World Series Championship season, Raines served as first base coach. During the 2006 season, he served as bench coach. He was the hitting coach for the minor-league Harrisburg Senators in 2007, but was not retained by the team for 2008. Raines signed a two-year contract to manage the Newark Bears of the Atlantic League, starting in 2009. After the 2010 season, the Bears moved to the Canadian American Association of Professional Baseball, and the team announced Raines would return to manage in 2011. In 2012, he was an assistant coach and Director of Player Development for the Bears. The Toronto Blue Jays hired Raines as a minor league baserunning and outfield coach in 2013.

==Personal life==

In 1979, Raines married Virginia Hilton, a classmate at Seminole High School. The couple had two children: Tim Jr. (&quot;Little Rock&quot;), and André (&quot;Little Hawk&quot;). In high school, he was a running back. Discussing his decision to play professional baseball instead of football he stated, &quot;...in football I was a running back, so in the NFL my career would have probably lasted six or seven years and in baseball I ended up playing 23 years. In baseball you can play a long time so I think it&#x27;s better when you think of it in that way.&quot;
In 2007, he moved to Estrella Mountain Ranch, a suburb of Phoenix, Arizona, and married Shannon Watson from Arnprior, Ontario.
She had twin babies in 2010. In 2017, Raines published his autobiography, written with journalist Alan Maimon, &quot;Rock Solid: My Life in Baseball&#x27;s Fast Lane&quot;.

<text>Gianluca Masi (born 22 January 1972) is an Italian astrophysicist and astronomer, as well as a discoverer of minor planets and variable stars.

== Career ==

He started his interest in astronomy in childhood, later becoming a professional astronomer, earning a PhD in astronomy at the Sapienza University of Rome in 2006. At the same time, he devoted a lot of effort to science communication, on the international stage.

His professional interests include asteroids and comets, variable stars and extrasolar planets, with many contributions in all those fields. He was able to determine the date that Vincent van Gogh painted &quot;Starry Night Over the Rhone&quot; by studying the star placement.

In 2006 he started the Virtual Telescope project (part of Bellatrix Astronomical Observatory), consisting of several robotic telescopes, remotely available in real-time over the Internet. Through this system, real-time online observations are performed; sharing the universe with the world. More than 1,000,000 individuals each year observe the sky through the Virtual Telescope.

== Awards and honors ==

He received a number of prizes, including the Ruggieri Prize (2003), the Gene Shoemaker NEO Grant (2005) and the Tacchini Prize (2006) as well as other acknowledgements for his scientific activities. The Nysian asteroid 21795 Masi, discovered by his college Franco Mallia in 1999, was named in his honor.

<doc id="775284" wikidata="Q3535480" url="?curid=775284" title="1997 British Lions tour to South Africa">
<text>The 1997 British &amp; Irish Lions tour to South Africa was a series of matches played by the British &amp; Irish Lions rugby union team in South Africa. This tour followed the Lions&#x27; 1993 tour to New Zealand and preceded their 2001 British &amp; Irish Lions tour to Australia. The much-anticipated tour was the first after the end of apartheid in South Africa, and the first British &amp; Irish Lions tour since rugby union turned professional. It was only the third time that a touring side had won a test series in South Africa; the others being the 1974 Lions and the 1996 All Blacks.

A documentary &quot;Living with Lions&quot; was produced and contains footage of players and coaching staff during and away from matches.

==Pre-tour prospects==
South Africa had won the 1995 Rugby World Cup, but were in decline at the time of the tour. The inaugural Tri Nations in 1996 had been comfortably won by New Zealand with South Africa winning only one of their four matches in the tournament. There was also some disarray in the management of the game in South Africa with the resignation of the coach Andre Markgraaff and the acrimonious replacement of the World Cup-winning captain Francois Pienaar. Nevertheless, the Lions were seen to be underdogs – for example an editorial in the South African sports magazine &quot;SA Sports Illustrated&quot; said &quot;&quot;The British Lions arrived in South Africa rated – by their own media, South African media and supporters – as nothing more than rank underdogs. A nice bunch of blokes who were making a bit of history and, in so doing, winning friends rather than matches&quot;.&quot;

==The results==
The British &amp; Irish Lions won the first test at Newlands 25–16 with Neil Jenkins kicking five penalties, and Matt Dawson and Alan Tait scoring tries. Despite scoring three tries in the second test at Durban, the Springboks suffered from some woeful goalkicking and failed to land any penalties or conversions, while the Lions Neil Jenkins once again kicked five penalties to level the scores at 15–15 before a Jerry Guscott drop goal for an 18–15 lead for the Lions. The British &amp; Irish Lions then held off a ferocious South African fightback, Lawrence Dallaglio putting in a magnificent try-saving tackle, to win the match 18–15 and take the series. The third test at Ellis Park proved a match too far for the Lions squad and they lost 35–16.

The tour was a triumph for the British &amp; Irish Lions management of Fran Cotton (manager), Ian McGeechan (head coach), Jim Telfer (assistant coach) and especially the Captain Martin Johnson. It was the last occasion on which the British &amp; Irish Lions returned victorious from a tour until the victorious tour of Australia in 2013.

<text>The Anderson Packers, also known as the Anderson Duffey Packers and the Chief Anderson Meat Packers, were a professional basketball team based in Anderson, Indiana, in the 1940s and 1950s.

The team was founded and owned by brothers Ike W. and John B. Duffey, founders of meat packing company Duffey&#x27;s Incorporated, which had purchased the Hughes-Curry Packing Co. of Anderson in 1946, at which time the brothers founded the Anderson Packers. John Duffey was president of the club, and its secretary-treasurer was Ike. The Duffeys profitably sold their Anderson packing plant three years later, although they retained ownership of the team until its demise.

The Packers played in the National Basketball League from 1946 to 1949. The team moved into the National Basketball Association for the 1949–50 season. The franchise withdrew from the NBA on April 11, 1950, when the organization was absorbed by the league.

After that season the team moved to the National Professional Basketball League, which folded entirely at the end of their only (1950–1951) season.

<doc id="775304" wikidata="Q2928124" url="?curid=775304" title="Baltimore Bullets (1944–1954)">
<text>The Baltimore Bullets were a professional basketball team based in Baltimore. The Bullets competed in the American Basketball League (1944–1947), the Basketball Association of America (1947–1949), and (following the BAA&#x27;s merger with the National Basketball League) the National Basketball Association (1949–1954). On November 27, 1954, the team folded with a 3–11 record on the season, making the Bullets the last NBA franchise to fold. Out of all defunct NBA teams, the Bullets were members of the association for the longest time and the only defunct team to win a championship.

The Bullets name was revived in 1963, when the former Chicago Zephyrs relocated to Baltimore; even after these Bullets relocated to Washington in 1973, they kept their name for 24 more years until they were renamed the Wizards.

==Franchise history==
===ABL (1944–1947)===
The Baltimore Bullets began play in 1944 as an American Basketball League (ABL) team. The Bullets acquired their name in reference to the Phoenix Shot Tower. In the ABL, Baltimore reached the championship round all three seasons, winning the ABL title in 1946. The Bullets won a division title in 1947, but forfeited that season&#x27;s championship in favor of playing in the World Professional Basketball Tournament (the Bullets&#x27; second appearance in the tournament).

===BAA/NBA (1947–1954)===
The Bullets moved to the Basketball Association of America (BAA) in 1947, and won the 1948 championship over the Philadelphia Warriors (now Golden State Warriors). In 1949, the BAA merged with the National Basketball League (NBL), and became the National Basketball Association (NBA). The Bullets struggled on the court after their championship season, and never posted another winning record. In 1954, Ray Felix won the NBA Rookie of the Year Award and became the second African-American to be named an All-Star. Felix was traded to the Knicks on September 17, 1954, and on November 27, the Bullets became the last NBA franchise to fold.

<doc id="775306" wikidata="Q5297670" url="?curid=775306" title="Doreen Mantle">
<text>Doreen June Mantle (22 June 1926 – 9 August 2023) was a South African-born British actress who played Jean Warboys in &quot;One Foot in the Grave&quot; (1990–2000). She appeared in many British television series since the 1960s, including &quot;The Duchess of Duke Street&quot;, &quot;The Wild House&quot;, &quot;Sam Saturday&quot;, &quot;Chalk&quot;, &quot;Casualty&quot;, &quot;The Bill&quot;, &quot;Doctors&quot;, &quot;Holby City&quot;, &quot;Lovejoy&quot;, &quot;Coronation Street&quot; and &quot;Jonathan Creek&quot;. She played lollipop lady Queenie in &quot;Jam &amp; Jerusalem&quot; (2006–2009).

==Early life==
Doreen June Mantle was born on 22 June 1926, in Johannesburg, South Africa, to English parents Bernard and Hilda (née Greenberg), who ran a hotel. When she was six weeks old, her parents moved back to Britain, but they returned to South Africa four years later after the birth of Mantle&#x27;s brother Alan in 1930.

Mantle attended the University of the Witwatersrand. She acted with the university&#x27;s dramatic society and appeared on the South African amateur stage and radio, before becoming a social worker. On a visit to London in 1949, she performed at the Gateway theatre. She married Graham Smith, an engine sales manager, in 1953. She moved to the United Kingdom at the age of 23, out of opposition to apartheid, settling in London with her husband.

==Career==
Mantle acted at Colchester repertory theatre before taking a break from the stage after the birth of her first son. After her return, she had a small role as a wedding guest at the Aldwych theatre in a 1967 Royal Shakespeare Company production of Jules Feiffer’s play Little Murders.

After a lean spell during which she worked as a London tourist guide, Mantle’s career was given a boost by William Trevor’s play Going Home at the King’s Head theatre club, Islington, in 1972. She continued to work extensively on the stage in such productions as &quot;My Fair Lady&quot;, &quot;Keep It in the Family&quot;, &quot;The Seagull&quot; and &quot;Hamlet&quot;. She also toured Britain in &quot;Billy Liar&quot; in the role of Florence Boothroyd and performed at the National Theatre in &quot;The Voysey Inheritance&quot;. In 1979, she was awarded the Laurence Olivier Award for Best Actress in a Supporting Role for her performance in &quot;Death of a Salesman&quot;. She also undertook radio work for BBC Radio 3 and BBC World Service. Mantle played the long suffering wife of the rabbi in BBC Radio 4&#x27;s comedy series &quot;The Attractive Young Rabbi&quot;.

Mantle played Mrs Shaemen in Barbra Streisand&#x27;s film version of &quot;Yentl&quot; (1983).

In television many of Mantle&#x27;s parts were one-offs, but she had a short run as Mrs Catchpole in the first series of &quot;The Duchess of Duke Street&quot; (1976) and played Karl Marx’s wife in the first two parts of the Eleanor Marx trilogy (1977) and Rita Sterne, mother of the detective (Ivan Kaye) in &quot;Sam Saturday&quot; (1992).

Mantle would go on to find fame in her sixties, when in 1989 she was cast as the hapless and naive Jean Warboys, friend of Margaret (Annette Crosbie) and Victor Meldrew (Richard Wilson) in David Renwick&#x27;s sitcom &quot;One Foot in the Grave&quot;. She appeared in 18 episodes from 1990 until 2000. She would work with Renwick again, appearing in an episode of his comedy drama &quot;Love Soup&quot; in 2005.

She was a regular in the first two series (2006–2008) of the sitcom &quot;Jam &amp; Jerusalem&quot;, written by Jennifer Saunders, appearing in 12 episodes as Queenie, the school crossing attendant.

From 2010-11, Mantle briefly appeared in &quot;Coronation Street&quot; as Joy Fishwick, the mother of Colin Fishwick (David Crellin), who was secretly killed and his identity was stolen by John Stape (Graeme Hawley). In a similar fashion to her son, Joy was killed; albeit accidentally, by John who was trying to compromise and muffle her screaming. 

In early-2023, aged 96, she appeared on the clip show &quot;One Foot in the Grave - 30 Years Of Laughs&quot;, when along with other cast and crew members she took a look back at the show for which she became well known.

==Personal life and death==
Mantle married Graham Smith in 1953; they had two sons together, but later divorced. From the mid-1990s she was a resident of Highgate, London.

Mantle died at home in London on 9 August 2023, at the age of 97.

<text>The Chicago Stags were a National Basketball Association team based in Chicago from 1946 to 1950.

==History==

===1946–47 season===
In the BAA&#x27;s inaugural year, the Chicago Stags were originally meant to start out as the &quot;Chicago Atomics&quot;, to the point of even playing an exhibition game against the New York Knicks under that moniker before playing as the &quot;Chicago Basketball Club, Inc.&quot; for one more exhibition game before officially becoming the &quot;Chicago Stags&quot; for the rest of their existence. During this time, the Stags were placed in the Western Division, and after 60 games were tied with the St. Louis Bombers at 38–22 each. A tiebreaker game between the two teams on March 31, 1947, resulted in the Stags defeating the Bombers in overtime, 73–66, to clinch the division and a first round bye. Under the initial playoff format, the two division champions faced each other in the Semifinals. The Stags defeated the Washington Capitols, the only team to finish with a better record than the Stags, 4–2, and went on to lose to the Philadelphia Warriors in the BAA Finals, 4–1.

===1947–48 season===
The next season, the Stags finished second in their division with a 28–20 record, one game behind the St. Louis Bombers, and second overall in the league. In the playoffs, they won a tiebreaker game against the Washington Capitols, advancing to play the Boston Celtics in the First Round. The Stags won, moving into the Semifinals for the second consecutive year. However, they were defeated by the eventual champions, the Baltimore Bullets.

===1948–49 season===
The next year, the Stags finished third, 38–22, seven games behind division-winning Rochester Royals. The playoffs were expanded from six to eight teams, and the Stags played the Minneapolis Lakers in the Division semifinals where they lost 2–0.

===1949–50 season===
In their final season, the Stags finished tied for third with the Fort Wayne Zollner Pistons with a 40–28 record, and again lost to the Lakers in the Division semifinals.

===Purchase by Abe Saperstein, name change and folding===
Abe Saperstein, owner of the famed Harlem Globetrotters, bought the Stags in June 1950. In August, Saperstein announced that the team would be known as the &quot;Chicago Bruins&quot; and would play double-headers with his Globetrotters on most of its home dates in Chicago Stadium, something the now-former Stags had already done several times (in fact, the Stags final playoff game was part of a triple-header that also involved the Trotters). The Bruins also planned on playing &quot;home games&quot; in such cities as Detroit, Milwaukee, Peoria, Illinois, St. Louis, Kansas City and Cincinnati, making the Bruins a regional franchise.

However, by September, Saperstein&#x27;s deal to buy the club fell apart when he withdrew his offer and requested NBA president Maurice Podoloff return his $20,000 deposit, reportedly half of the purchase price. Saperstein claimed he had received &quot;exactly nothing&quot; from the NBA for his money: neither the club nor the contract of four ex-Stags players who jumped to the National Professional Basketball League. (Supposedly, Podoloff, acting on behest of a group of other NBA owners, &quot;foreclosed&quot; on the Stags due to their inability to repay a $40,000 loan that enabled them to finish the 1949–50 season in the first place.) It marked the end of the NBA in Chicago until the Chicago Packers were joined in 1961.

On April 25, 1950, Bob Cousy was drafted by the Tri-Cities Blackhawks but did not sign with the team. Cousy wanted $10,000 and Blackhawks owner Ben Kerner countered with $6,000 in negotiations. Cousy was then sold to the Stags in a trade. When the Stags/Bruins folded on September 25, 1950, a dispersal draft was held on October 5, to divide their players throughout the league, with Cousy going to the Boston Celtics.

The Stags were one of seven teams that quickly left the NBA: the Anderson Packers, Sheboygan Red Skins and Waterloo Hawks jumped to the NPBL, while Chicago, Denver and St. Louis folded, shrinking the loop from 17 teams to 11 at the dawn of the 1950–51 season. (The situation got worse in January 1951 as the Washington Capitols folded as well, bringing the number of NBA teams down to ten.)

The NBA would return to Chicago twice, first with the Packers/Zephyrs (now the Washington Wizards) from 1961 to 1963 and since 1966 with the Bulls.

==Arena==
The Stags played at Chicago Stadium, which was located at 1800 West Madison Street and was demolished in 1995 to make way for the United Center; it later served as the home court of the Bulls from 1966 to 1994.

==Aftermath==
The Chicago Bulls, the city&#x27;s current NBA team, wore replicas of the 1946 Stags uniforms during the 2005–06 NBA season as part of the NBA&#x27;s &quot;Hardwood Classics&quot; program (they wore them on December 5, 2005, February 22, 2006, and April 16, 2006).

<doc id="775310" wikidata="Q805221" url="?curid=775310" title="Ballet dancer">
<text>A ballet dancer is a person who practices the art of classical ballet. Both females and males can practice ballet. They rely on years of extensive training and proper technique to become a part of a professional ballet company. Ballet dancers are at a high risk of injury due to the demanding technique of ballet.

==Training and technique==

Ballet dancers typically begin training at an early age as young as three or four if they desire to perform professionally and often take part in international competitions such as YAGP and Prix de Lausanne. At these events, scholarships are being granted to the most talented dancers, enabling them to continue their training at renowned ballet schools around the world, such as the John Kranko Schule in Germany and the Académie de Danse Classique Princesse Grace in Monaco. Pre-professional ballet dancers can audition to enroll at a vocational ballet school such as The Royal Ballet School or Elmhurst Ballet School. These types of ballet boarding schools often cooperate with a professional ballet company, offering job opportunities to graduates. There are different styles of training in ballet such as the Vaganova method, the Cecchetti method and the English style of training (Royal Academy of Dance/The Royal Ballet). Training does not end when ballet dancers are hired by a professional company. Even professional ballet dancers take daily ballet class to keep their technique in check and to warm up and prepare for a day of rehearsals. Ballet is a strict form of art, and the dancer must be very athletic and flexible.


Ballet dancers begin their classes at the barre, a wooden beam that runs along the walls of the ballet studio. Dancers use the barre to support themselves during exercises. Barre work is designed to warm up the body and stretch muscles to prepare for center work, where they execute exercises without the barre. Center work in the middle of the room starts out with slower exercises, gradually leading up to faster exercises and larger movements. Ballet dancers finish center work practicing big leaps across the floor, which is called grande allegro. Daily ballet class at a professional ballet company is a popular annual feature which is being livestreamed each year during World Ballet Day.

After center work, females present exercises on pointe, wearing pointe shoes. Males practice jumps and turns. They may practice partner work together.

==Injuries==
Ballet dancers are susceptible to injury because they are constantly putting strain and stress on their bodies and their feet. A ballet dancer&#x27;s goal is to make physically demanding choreography appear effortless.

The upper body of a ballet dancer is prone to injury because choreography and class exercises require them to exert energy into contorting their backs and hips. Back bends cause the back to pinch, making the spine vulnerable to injuries such as spasms and pinched nerves. Extending the legs and holding them in the air while turned out causes damage to the hips. Such damage includes strains, fatigue fractures, and bone density loss.

Injuries are common in ballet dancers because ballet consists of putting the body in unnatural positions. One such position is first position, in which the heels are placed together as the toes point outward, rotating, or &quot;turning out&quot; the legs. If First Position is done incorrectly it can cause knee problems, however, when done correctly (turning out with the hips rather than the knees) it should increase flexibility and reduce pressure on the knees. Meniscal tears and dislocations can happen at the knees when positioned incorrectly because it is easy to let the knees slide forward while turned out in first position.

Ballet dancer&#x27;s feet are prone to fractures and other damage. Landing incorrectly (not through the foot, with knees bent) from jumps and dancing on pointe may increase the risk of broken bones and weakened ankles where care and attention is not taken by a conscientious teacher or student. Tendonitis is common in female ballet dancers because pointe work is strenuous on their ankles. Landing from jumps incorrectly may also lead to shin splints, in which the muscle separates from the bone.

Class time is used to correct any habits that could lead to injury. If the ballet dancer is properly trained, the dancer will decrease their risk of injury. Some ballet dancers also turn to stretching or other methods of cross training, like Pilates, yoga, non impact cardio, and swimming. This outside training, attempts to minimize the risk of bodily damage by increasing strength, exercise diversity, and stamina. These days ballet companies around the world pay a lot of attention to the prevention of injuries and a lot of ballet companies have in-house health suites providing facilities and expert guidance to dancers. Most ballet companies and ballet boarding schools alike also employ their own physiotherapist. The Australian Ballet invented a calf rise exercise to prevent injuries that is now being used by ballet companies across the globe. This exercise is often being featured during livestreams on World Ballet Day.

==Gendered titles==
Traditionally, gender-specific titles are used for ballet dancers. In French and Italian, gender-neutral words for such purposes simply never existed (at least historically), and customary usage in English-speaking ballet companies was originally borrowed from those languages. In French, a male ballet dancer is referred to as a &quot;&quot; and a female as a &quot;&quot;. In Italian, a &quot;&quot; is a female who typically holds a principal title within a ballet company; the title for equally ranked males is &quot;&quot;. In Italian, the common term for a male dancer is &quot;danzatore&quot; and a female dancer is a &quot;danzatrice&quot;.

These terms are rarely used in English. Since &quot;ballerino&quot; is not used in English, it does not enjoy the same connotation as &quot;ballerina&quot;. A regular male dancer in Italy is called a &quot;ballerino&quot;. In the English-speaking world, boys or men who dance classical ballet are usually referred to as (male) ballet dancers. Often &quot;ballerino&quot; is used in English-based countries as slang.

==Hierarchic titles==
Ballet companies continue to rank their dancers in hierarchical fashion; most have adopted a gender-neutral classification system. In most large companies, there are usually several leading dancers of each sex, titled principal dancer or &quot;&quot; to reflect their seniority, and more often, their status within the company. The most common rankings in English are:

* Principal dancer
* Soloist (or First soloist)
* Demi-soloist (or Second soloist)
* First Artist
* Corps de ballet (or Artist)
* Apprentice (or Junior Company/Young Dancers programme)

Some ballet companies also run a separate company for their youngest recruits. Such is the case with the Dutch National Ballet which has launched the Junior Company, which at times also tours and performs separately. The UK-based Royal Ballet runs the Aud Jebsen Young Dancers Programme. Dancers who are identified as a guest artist are usually those who have achieved a high rank with their home company, and have subsequently been engaged to dance with other ballet companies around the world, normally performing the lead role. They are usually principal dancers or soloists with their home company, but given the title of Guest Artist when performing with another company. Well-known guest artists include Marianela Nunez and Kathryn Morgan.

===Changes in terminology===
&quot;Ballerina&quot; means any female ballet student or dancer, although historically, it was once a rank given only to the most exceptional female soloists. As late as the 1950s a &quot;ballerina&quot; was the principal female dancer of a ballet company who was also very accomplished in the international world of ballet, especially beyond her own company; female dancers who danced ballet were then called &quot;danseuses&quot; or simply ballet dancers—that is, &quot;ballerina&quot; was a critical accolade bestowed on relatively few female dancers, somewhat similar to the title diva in opera. The male version of this term is &quot;danseur noble&quot; (in French), although since the 1960s, the term has lost its hierarchical meaning and is applied generally to women who are ballet dancers.

As used in Italy, the terms &quot;ballerino&quot; (a male dancer, usually in ballet) and &quot;ballerina&quot; do not imply the accomplished and critically acclaimed dancers once meant by the terms &quot;ballerina&quot; and &quot;danseur noble&quot; as they were used in English; rather, they simply mean one who dances ballet. Italian terms that do convey an accomplished female ballet dancer are &quot;prima ballerina&quot; and &quot;prima ballerina assoluta&quot; (the French word &quot;étoile&quot; is used in this sense at the Scala ballet company in Milan, but has a different meaning at the Paris Opera Ballet). The title or rank of &quot;&quot; was originally inspired by the Italian ballet masters of the early Romantic ballet and was bestowed on a &quot;ballerina&quot; who was considered to be exceptionally talented, above the standard of other leading &quot;ballerine&quot;. The title is very rarely used today and recent uses have typically been symbolic, in recognition of a notable career; as a result, it is commonly viewed as an honour rather than an active rank.

===Historical rank names, women===

More or less, depending on the source, the rankings for women—from highest to lowest—used to be:
* &quot;Prima ballerina&quot;, &#x27; or &#x27;
* &quot;

===Historical rank names, men===
For men, the ranks were:
* &quot;
* &quot;
* &quot;

<doc id="775317" wikidata="Q2113979" url="?curid=775317" title="Providence Steamrollers">
<text>The Providence Steamrollers were a Basketball Association of America team based in Providence, Rhode Island. As of 2025, the Steamrollers were the last professional sports franchise from one of the Big Four leagues to be based in Rhode Island.

==Franchise history==
The Steamrollers were one of the original eleven NBA franchises (when the league was called the Basketball Association of America). The franchise posted an all-time record of 46–122 (.274) before folding after three seasons.

The Steamrollers still hold the dubious NBA record for the fewest games won in a season with six, in the 1947–48 season, paired with 42 losses. However, the 2011–2012 Charlotte Bobcats hold the record for the lowest winning percentage in NBA history, with .106, the result of a 7–59 record. During that 1947–48 season, the Steamrollers&#x27; coach Nat Hickey activated himself as a player for two games, the second of which was two days before his 46th birthday, setting a still-standing record as the oldest player in NBA history.

On August 3, 1949, the Steamrollers would join the Indianapolis Jets as the only teams from the Basketball Association of America side of the BAA-NBL merger in what&#x27;s now known as the NBA to not join in on the merger and survive as a team. Nine days later, seven of the Steamrollers&#x27; players would be bought out and play for the Boston Celtics instead.

==Christmas Tradition==
The Steamrollers took on the New York Knicks on Christmas Day in 1947 in the first Christmas Day game in NBA history. The Steamrollers lost the game to the Knicks 89–75 in what would become an annual tradition for the NBA.

==Attempts to bring the Steamrollers back==
In 1980 entrepreneur Robert &quot;Skip&quot; Chernov attempted to bring the Steamrollers back to the NBA. Chernov had purchased the rights to the Steamroller&#x27;s from Lou Pieri&#x27;s estate and believed that the NBA bylaws at the time would allow him to resurrect the franchise. The NBA led by Chief Counsel David Stern disagreed, but Chernov, undeterred, sued the NBA. Chernov asked the courts to allow the Steamrollers return to the NBA and to grant them to first overall draft pick in the 1980 draft. Ultimately, the court ruled in the NBA&#x27;s favor and the short-lived attempt to resurrect the Providence Steamrollers failed.

==Players of note==
* Ernie Calverley – Second-team All-NBA and led league in assists during NBA&#x27;s first season
* George Nostrand – Tallest player in the NBA&#x27;s first year
* Howie Shannon – Leading NBA rookie in 1949
* Nat Hickey – Oldest player in NBA history
* Kenny Sailors – Led team in scoring in 1948 and 1949

<text>178 Belisana is a stony background asteroid from the inner regions of the asteroid belt, approximately in diameter. It was discovered on 6 November 1877, by Austrian astronomer Johann Palisa at the Austrian Naval Observatory in today&#x27;s Croatia. The S-type asteroid has a rotation period of 12.32 hours and a rather spherical shape. It was named after the Celtic goddess Belisama (Belisana).

== Orbit and classification ==

&quot;Belisana&quot; is a non-family asteroid from the main belt&#x27;s background population. It orbits the Sun in the inner main-belt at a distance of 2.4–2.6 AU once every 3 years and 10 months (1,409 days; semi-major axis of 2.46 AU). Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.04 and an inclination of 2° with respect to the ecliptic.

== Physical characteristics ==

&quot;Belisana&quot; has been characterized as a common, stony S-type asteroid in both the Tholen and SMASS classification.

=== Rotation period ===

Photometric observations of this asteroid from multiple observatories during 2007 gave a light curve with a period of 12.321 ± 0.002 hours and a brightness variation of 0.10 ± 0.03 in magnitude. This is in agreement with a study performed in 1992. However, it is possible that the light curve may have a period of 24.6510 ± 0.0003 hours; it will require further study to exclude this solution.

=== Diameter and albedo ===

According to the surveys carried out by the Infrared Astronomical Satellite IRAS, the Japanese Akari satellite and the NEOWISE mission of NASA&#x27;s Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer, &quot;Belisana&quot; measures between 35.81 and 42.09 kilometers in diameter and its surface has an albedo between 0.214 and 0.2438.

The &quot;Collaborative Asteroid Lightcurve Link&quot; derives an albedo of 0.2026 and a diameter of 35.50 kilometers based on an absolute magnitude of 9.6.

== Naming ==

This minor planet was named after the goddess Belisama (or Belisana) from Celtic mythology, meaning &quot;queen of heaven&quot;, the most warlike goddess among British Celts, and equivalent to the goddesses Athene or Minerva. The official naming citation was mentioned in &quot;The Names of the Minor Planets&quot; by Paul Herget in 1955 ().

<text>Katherine Karen Dunn (October 24, 1945 – May 11, 2016) was an American novelist, journalist, voice artist, radio personality, book reviewer, and poet from Portland, Oregon. She is best known for her novel &quot;Geek Love&quot; (1989). She was also a prolific writer on boxing.

==Early life==
Dunn was born in Garden City, Kansas, in 1945. She was the second-youngest of five siblings; her father left before she was two. Her mother, Velma Golly, an artist from North Dakota, married a mechanic or/and fisherman from the Pacific Northwest. The family moved often during her childhood. She went to high school in Tigard, Oregon, and later attended Reed College in Portland on a full scholarship, but never graduated. She suffered a difficult childhood due to poverty and a violent mother. She left home for good when she was 17. Poverty was an important element in her novels as well. In college she majored in philosophy and then psychology.

==Later life and career==
Dunn began her first novel &quot;Attic&quot; (1970) while studying at Reed College. During a Christmas break trip to Ashbury Heights in 1967 she met a man she would spend the next ten years with. Together, they traveled to Mexico, Boston, Newfoundland, and Seville, where she finished &quot;Attic&quot;, then to Karpathos. Here, she finished her second novel, &quot;Truck&quot; (1971), and became pregnant. She gave birth to her son in Dublin, Ireland. After living for seven years at various locations, they returned to Portland to stay &quot;because there was a good alternative public school&quot;, namely the Metropolitan Learning Center. She settled in the Nob Hill neighborhood, where she resided until her death.

Dunn waited tables in the morning before her son woke up, and tended bars at night, painted houses, and did voice-over work. In the 1970s, she hosted a radio show on Portland&#x27;s community radio station KBOO, during which she read short fiction by other authors. She taught advanced classes in creative writing at Oregon&#x27;s Lewis &amp; Clark College and a graduate course in the same subject at Pacific University in Forest Grove, Oregon.

In 1981, Dunn began writing about boxing in &quot;Willamette Week&quot;. Having fallen in love with the sport, she went on to cover the sport for a number of publications, including &quot;PDXS&quot;, &quot;The Oregonian&quot;, and &quot;The New York Times&quot;. She has been described as &quot;one of the better boxing writers in the United States&quot;. She started boxing training in her 40s.

She was an editor and contributor for the online boxing magazine cyberboxingzone.com. In the 1990s, Dunn wrote a regular column on boxing for &quot;PDXS&quot; , in which she at one time provided detailed criticism of Evander Holyfield&#x27;s sportsmanship in his controversial fight with Mike Tyson. She won the Dorothea Lange—Paul Taylor Award in 2004 for her work on &quot;School of Hard Knocks: The Struggle for Survival in America&#x27;s Toughest Boxing Gyms&quot;. Her essays on boxing were collected in her 2009 collection &quot;One Ring Circus: Dispatches from the World of Boxing&quot;.

Her third published novel was &quot;Geek Love&quot; (1989), and it was by far her best-known work. It was a finalist for the National Book Award. It was a finalist, also, for the Bram Stoker Award for first horror novel. Dunn described her memory of when she began writing it in the late 1970s, walking to Portland&#x27;s Washington Park Rose Garden, contemplating nature versus nurture and the genesis of the book with its publication in 1989. It remains a strong seller, with over a half-million copies sold, never having gone out of print.

In 1989, Dunn announced that she was working on a new novel, entitled &quot;The Cut Man&quot;. As of 1999, she was still working on the project. In 2008, it was reported that publisher Alfred A. Knopf had scheduled &quot;The Cut Man&quot; for release in September. The novel remains unpublished. An excerpt was published in the summer 2010 issue of &quot;The Paris Review&quot; under the title &quot;Rhonda Discovers Art&quot;.

In 2012, Dunn reunited with Paul Pomerantz, her boyfriend from Reed College, and they married. Dunn died on May 11, 2016. Her son stated her death was from complications of lung cancer.

==Posthumous publications==
In 2022, the third novel she wrote, &quot;Toad&quot; (1971), with an Introduction by Molly Crabapple, was published posthumously by Farrar, Straus and Giroux, making it her fourth published novel. (Thus, it was written about 18 years before &quot;Geek Love&quot;.) In 1971 Harper and Row, who had published her novels &quot;Attic&quot; and &quot;Truck&quot;, also bought the rights to &quot;Toad&quot;. However, they ultimately did not publish it. (“Nobody in this book is likable!” she was told.) It is about “a woman who has retreated into a life of isolation following a breakdown reflects on her time as an impoverished college student in the early 1970s in Portland, Oregon at the height of the women’s liberation movement, and the group of wealthy trust fund kids she befriends.” It was rejected by other publishers in years following, and after 1979 she set the book aside. It was only published because it was found in her archives at Lewis &amp; Clark College by Naomi Huffman, an editor. Dunn&#x27;s son and others pushed to have this work finally published.

A short story related to &quot;Toad&quot;, &quot;The Resident Poet&quot; was published by &quot;The New Yorker&quot; in 2020. Another short story, &quot;The Education of Mrs. R.&quot; was published by &quot;The Paris Review&quot; in 2022. A book of her short stories is also due to be published.

<text>The Cleveland Rebels were a basketball team in the Basketball Association of America (BAA), a forerunner of the modern National Basketball Association (NBA), based in Cleveland.

==Franchise history==
The Rebels were an inaugural franchise in the BAA&#x27;s first season. In their only season, the team went 30–30, finishing 3rd in the Western Division and losing in the first round of the playoffs, two games to one to the New York Knickerbockers, in its only season before going out of business on June 9, 1947. The Rebels included notable early pro stars Big Ed Sadowski and Kenny Sailors. Cleveland would not have another team in what would become the NBA until the Cavaliers joined the league in 1970.

<text>A ballet company is a type of dance troupe that performs classical ballet, neoclassical ballet, and/or contemporary ballet in the European tradition, plus managerial and support staff. Most major ballet companies employ dancers on a year-round basis, except in the United States, where contracts for part of the year (typically thirty or forty weeks) are normally offered. A company generally has a home theatre where it stages the majority of its performances, but many companies also tour in their home country or internationally.

Ballet companies routinely make a loss at the box office and depend on external financial support of one kind or another. In Europe, most of this support comes in the form of government subsidies, though private donations are usually solicited as well. In North America, private donations are the main source of external funding.

Many ballet companies have an associated school which trains dancers. Traditionally the school would provide almost all of the company&#x27;s dancers, something which helped to create clear distinctions in style between companies, but 21st-century ballet has open hiring practices, and many ballet companies have a very international staff.

==Staff==

The head of a ballet company is called the artistic director. He or she is usually a retired dancer, and often they choreograph some of the company&#x27;s productions themselves. In a large company, they will have one or more assistants. Day-to-day coaching of the dancers is the responsibility of one or more ballet masters and ballet mistresses. Some companies also employ répétiteurs and dance notators. There is often a resident choreographer.

All but the smallest companies divide their dancers into at least three grades. The most common names for the two higher grades in English are principal and soloist and the junior dancers form the corps de ballet. Some companies (especially in North America) have trainees or apprentices, who rank below the corps de ballet and may be unpaid. Some companies further subdivide these grades, and the terminology used varies from company to company. In the 19th century and early to mid-20th century the top female dancer was often recognized as the prima ballerina, but this practice has ceased. Male and female dancers were historically split into separate hierarchies (for more information see ballerina). Today, many companies choose to use a gender-neutral hierarchy. Some companies (mainly in Russia and countries strongly influenced by Russian ballet) employ specialist character dancers: unlike ballerinas female character dancers do not dance en pointe. The largest ballet company in the world is the Bolshoi Ballet of Moscow, which employs over 240 dancers, as of 2010. The largest companies in Western Europe and North America employ around one hundred.

Many companies have a music director, generally a conductor by profession, though this is often a part-time position. The music director has a lower status in ballet than they have in opera, where they are the head of the company. Freelance conductors are hired to conduct specific productions as and when required. Large companies have their own orchestra, which is often shared with an opera company resident in the same theatre or opera house. Smaller companies hire a local orchestra on a contract basis for each season of performances, or hire a scratch orchestra for specific performances, e.g. when they are on tour. During company classes and rehearsals, music is provided by one or more staff or freelance pianists.

All but the smallest companies have a separate administrative staff that deals with marketing, accounts, personnel issues, logistics and so on. Larger companies employ a permanent staff of craftsmen and craftswomen such as prop makers and costume makers, and technical staff such as lighting technicians and stage managers. Smaller companies hire freelancers for these roles as and when required. Some companies also have physiotherapists, masseurs, and physical trainers on the staff.

==Asian classical ballet traditions==
The term &quot;ballet&quot; is sometimes used to refer to dance styles in any culture&#x27;s classical tradition, mainly about classical styles of dance performed in parts of Asia. Classical Ramayana Hindu ballet is often performed in Indonesia. The Royal Ballet of Cambodia is an example of a ballet company in the Eastern tradition.

The companies listed below are ballet companies that perform according to the European tradition, although some international companies also perform contemporary ballets that merge Western and Eastern themes and dance techniques.

<text>The Denver Nuggets were a professional basketball team based in Denver. The Nuggets joined the National Basketball League (NBL) for the 1948–49 season, and then joined the National Basketball Association when the NBL was absorbed by the Basketball Association of America to create the NBA for the 1949–50 season. The Nuggets were the first major professional sports franchise in Colorado, but disbanded after going 11–50 in their inaugural season. This franchise is not directly connected to the current Denver Nuggets franchise of the NBA. 

==History==
The team&#x27;s roots can be traced back to 1932 when the original amateur Nuggets were formed as a member of the Amateur Athletic Union (AAU). Led by player-coach Jack McCracken, the Nuggets were one of the most powerful amateur athletic basketball teams in the country, winning the 1939 AAU championship and losing the 1940 championship to the Phillips 66ers. Not playing professionally, its players were given extra jobs by team sponsors. Featuring players such as McCracken, Ace Gruenig and Vince Boryla, the Nuggets continued as an AAU power throughout their existence, and the AAU has been credited by historians for helping put Denver on the national sports map.

After the 1947–48 season, the Nuggets decided to step out of their amateur status. Rather than join the National Industrial Basketball League (NIBL), which was founded in 1947 and remained amateur, the Nuggets&#x27; general manager, Hal Davis, secured a franchise in the nine-team National Basketball League to play in the 1948–49 season. The Nuggets finished last in the Western Division in the 1948–49 season.

In the 1949–50 season, the team played in the newly-formed National Basketball Association (NBA). The Nuggets were led by player-coach Jimmy Darden, a star shooting guard who joined the Nuggets after leaving the Army as a World War II veteran in 1946. The Nuggets started the 1949–50 season with a record of 0–15, and finished the season 11–51. In 1950, the Nuggets were one of seven teams, including Anderson Packers, Chicago Stags, Sheboygan Red Skins, St. Louis Bombers, Washington Capitols, Waterloo Hawks, that dropped out of the National Basketball Association altogether.

Briefly, in the 1950–51 season, the Denver Refiners played in the National Professional Basketball League (NPBL), which was made up of franchises that left the NBA. That team moved to become the Evansville Agogans the last six games of the season. After the demise of the Nuggets and the Refiners, Colorado was without any major league sports teams until the American Football League&#x27;s Denver Broncos began play in 1960.

==Arena==
The Nuggets played on the stage of the Denver Auditorium Arena.

==Legacy==
When the Denver Rockets of the American Basketball Association (ABA) joined the NBA, a contest was held in 1974 to give the team a new nickname since the NBA already had the Houston Rockets. The Nuggets&#x27; name was selected as the moniker of the new team. In 1985, Vince Boryla joined the franchise as its president and general manager, and was awarded NBA Executive of the Year that same year. He was president and general manager of the Nuggets from 1985 to 1988. The current Denver Nuggets also started out in the same venue as the original Nuggets, the Denver Auditorium Arena, playing there from 1967 to 1975.

It was his last discovery three years before his death. The transitional S-type asteroid has a rotation period of 11.17 hours. It was named after Clytemnestra from Greek mythology.

== Orbit and classification ==

Together with asteroid 9506 Telramund, &quot;Klytaemnestra&quot; is the largest members of the Telramund family (), a mid-sized family of stony asteroids in the outer main belt, which is also known as the Klytaemnestra family.

It orbits the Sun in the outer main-belt at a distance of 2.6–3.3 AU once every 5 years and 1 month (1,871 days; semi-major axis of 2.97 AU). Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.11 and an inclination of 8° with respect to the ecliptic. The body&#x27;s observation arc begins at Lick Observatory in February 1899, more than 21 years after to its official discovery observation at Ann Arbor.

== Physical characteristics ==

In the Tholen classification, &quot;Klytaemnestra&quot; is a common stony S-type asteroid, while in the SMASS classification it is a Sk-subtype, that transitions between the S- and K-type asteroids.

=== Rotation period and poles ===

Photometric observations of this asteroid at the Oakley Observatory in Terre Haute, Indiana, during 2006 gave a light curve with a period of 11.13 ± 0.02 hours and a brightness variation of 0.55 ± 0.02 in magnitude (). A better rated lightcurve, already obtained by Alan Harris in October 1979, gave a period of 11.173 hours with an amplitude of 0.35 ().

A modeled lightcurve using photometric data from a larger international collaboration was published in 2016. It gave a period of 11.17342 hours, identical to the 1979-observations by Harris, as well as two spin axes at (65.0°, −6.0°) and (248.0°, −9.0°) in ecliptic coordinates (λ, β).

=== Diameter and albedo ===

According to the surveys carried out by the Infrared Astronomical Satellite IRAS, the Japanese Akari satellite and the NEOWISE mission of NASA&#x27;s Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer, &quot;Klytaemnestra&quot; measures between 64.25 and 90.17 kilometers in diameter and its surface has an albedo between 0.119 and 0.245.

The &quot;Collaborative Asteroid Lightcurve Link&quot; adopts the results obtained by IRAS, that is, an albedo of 0.1609 and a diameter of 77.69 kilometers based on an absolute magnitude of 8.15.

== Naming ==

This minor planet was named from Greek mythology after Clytemnestra, the daughter of Leda and the Spartan king Tyndareus. She was the wife of Agamemnon and the mother Orestes, Electra, Iphigenia and Chrysothemis. Clytemnestra and her lover Aegisthus murdered Agamemnon on his return from the Trojan War. The minor planets , , , , and were named after these mythological figures.

<doc id="775344" wikidata="Q2714987" url="?curid=775344" title="Scout Motto">
<text>The Scout Motto of the Scout movement is, in English, &quot;Be Prepared&quot;, with most international branches of the group using a close translation of that phrase. These mottoes have been used by millions of Scouts around the world since 1907. Most of the member organizations of the World Association of Girl Guides and Girl Scouts (WAGGGS) share the same mottoes.

In the first part of &quot;Scouting for Boys&quot;, Robert Baden-Powell explains the meaning of the phrase:

==Baden-Powell on &quot;Be Prepared&quot;==
Baden-Powell provides several descriptions of how and for what situations a Scout must be prepared elsewhere in &quot;Scouting for Boys&quot;. In his explanation of the third point of the Scout Law, Baden-Powell says:

In the opening chapter of &quot;Scouting for Boys&quot;, Baden-Powell says:

Baden-Powell discuses more skills required of Scouts in Chapter IV of &quot;Scouting for Boys&quot;, which addresses camp life, and he lists:
* Tying knots
* Making a bivouac shelter for the night, or a hut for longer-term camping
* Using an axe or bill-hook to fell small trees and branches
* Mending and even making clothes and boots
* Cooking meat and vegetables, and making bread without regular cooking utensils
* Driving sheep, cattle and horses
* Killing and butchering cattle
* Milking cows or goats

Advice given by Baden-Powell in Chapter V on campaigning includes the requirements of:

* Being able to find one&#x27;s way by night and by day
* Being able to read a barometer, and signs of the weather
* Judging distance from an inch up to a mile or more
* Knowing the points of a compass

In a chapter discussing endurance, Baden-Powell writes that a scout should be able to:

* Smell well in order to find his enemy by night
* Hear well
* Have good eyesight to notice things rapidly and at distance

In Chapter VII, Baden-Powell discussed how Scouts prepare themselves to protect women and how they can improve themselves. He says a scout should walk with a woman on his left &quot;so that his right is free to protect her&quot;, walking on the other side in the streets to protect her from traffic. Baden-Powell adds to &quot;Be Prepared&quot; for the future by learning a trade and saving up pay.

Chapter VIII of &quot;Scouting for Boys&quot; discussed saving life. On this topic, Baden-Powell says that a scout should be prepared by:

* Learning beforehand what to do in the event of likely accidents
* Being prepared to do what is required the moment that an accident does occur
* Knowing how to deal with a mad dog, and being prepared to take the necessary action
* Knowing how to react to a person&#x27;s suicide attempt

In the chapter on patriotism, Baden-Powell says to &quot; to die for your country if need be, so that when the moment arrives you may charge home with confidence, not caring whether you are going to be killed or not.&quot;

The first handbook for Girl Guides, &quot;How Girls Can Help to Build Up the Empire&quot; by Agnes and Robert Baden-Powell, similarly explains:
The motto of the Girl Guides is &quot;Be Prepared&quot;. Why is this?
It is because, like the other Guides, you have to be prepared at any moment to face difficulties and even dangers by knowing what to do and how to do it.
(The &quot;other Guides&quot; of this quote are the Khyber Guide Regiment.)

==Acrostic==

Hilary Saint George Saunders&#x27; book &quot;The Left Handshake: The Boy Scout Movement during the War, 1939–1945&quot; had the first name of each chapter spell out the Scout motto. The chosen names are: Bravery, Enterprise, Purpose, Resolution, Endurance, Partnership, Assurance, Reformation, Enthusiasm and Devotion.

==Motto in various languages==

Many languages have masculine and feminine forms of words – where gender changes the Scout Motto, differences are reflected here.


==Similar mottoes in other organizations==
*Aston Villa F.C.&#x27;s earliest documented club crest, the Lion Rampant To dexter (&quot;facing left&quot;) on a shield with motto &quot;Prepared&quot;, was first documented in the club program of 1 September 1906.
* The motto of the Young Pioneers, &quot;Always prepared&quot; in various national languages, the Pioneers having been created as an alternative in countries under Communist rule where Scouting was banned.
*The motto of the United States Coast Guard, &quot;Semper Paratus&quot; or &#x27;always ready&#x27;.
*The motto of the British Army&#x27;s Parachute Regiment, &quot;Utrinque Paratus&quot; or &#x27;ready for anything&#x27;.

==Another motto mentioned in &quot;Scouting for Boys&quot;==
In Part IV, Chapter VI of the first edition of &quot;Scouting for Boys&quot;, Baden-Powell mentioned another Scout Motto:

<text>The Detroit Falcons were a Basketball Association of America (forerunner of the National Basketball Association) team based in Detroit. It played in the inaugural 1946–47 season and folded soon after the season ended. Its demise and the Detroit Gems move to Minneapolis, left Detroit without a professional basketball team until a decade later, when the Fort Wayne Pistons moved there.

==History==
The Falcons played only in the inaugural season of the BAA and finished 4th in the Western Division with a 20–40 record, games out of first place. Stan Miasek was the team&#x27;s star, scoring 895 points (14.9 points per game) and making the BAA&#x27;s First-Team that year. Despite Detroit hosting the inaugural BAA (now NBA) draft, the Falcons would be one of two teams in the BAA to not participate in that inaugural event. Following the draft&#x27;s conclusion, the Falcons would officially withdrew from the BAA on July 9, 1947, becoming the second BAA franchise to fold after the Cleveland Rebels did it a month prior on June 9.

<doc id="775348" wikidata="Q110243" url="?curid=775348" title="180 Garumna">
<text>180 Garumna is a main belt asteroid that was discovered by the French astronomer Henri Joseph Perrotin on January 29, 1878. Its name comes from the ancient Latin name for the Garonne River in France. In the Tholen classification system, it is categorized as a stony S-type asteroid, while the Bus asteroid taxonomy system lists it with the Sr sub-type.

The rotation period of this asteroid is very nearly equal to that of the rotation of the Earth. This means that only a small portion of the light curve can be observed from any one location, requiring measurements from multiple sites in order to build a complete curve. In 2012, this mission was accomplished, giving a period of 23.866 ± 0.001 hours with a brightness variation of 0.42 ± 0.02 in magnitude. Allowing for a margin of error and changes in phase angle, this finding agrees with previous measurements made in 2008 and 2011.

<text>TAE (&quot;Telekommunikations-Anschluss-Einheit&quot; or telecommunications connection unit) is the German standard for telephone plugs and sockets.

The standard covers two TAE types: F  (&quot;Fernsprechgerät&quot;: for telephones) and N  (&quot;Nebengerät&quot; or &quot;Nichtfernsprechgerät&quot;: for other devices such as answering machines and modems). U coded sockets and plugs are universal connectors that are suitable for both device types.

E-coded connectors that are used in EAD-sockets are not intended for telephony applications.

==History==
The TAE system was introduced in the late 1980s before the German government-owned institution Deutsche Bundespost (DBP, German Federal Post) was divided into Deutsche Post (postal service), Deutsche Telekom (telecommunication services) and Postbank (financial services). Previously, the older type connectors had been used, or telephones had been hardwired to their () wall sockets, and only officially approved telephones (legally distributable only by the DBP) were allowed to be connected to the telephone system. Furthermore, telephones and other communication devices could only be leased from the DBP and not be sold or bought on the free market.

The introduction of the TAE system was the practical enabling technology of the legal specification in Germany that communication terminal equipment should be in the responsibility of end users. Subsequently, many communication devices became available in the open market that could be plugged into standard TAE sockets. Adaptors allow for connecting devices with registered jacks that are more prevalent internationally.

Today, TAE connectors are common in Germany and other central European countries like Liechtenstein and Luxembourg. Modern TAE sockets also contain circuits referred to as &quot;passiver Prüfabschluss&quot;, meaning &quot;passive test termination&quot;. This provides a discernible condition to the telephone exchange indicating that the line is continuous to the TAE-connected device.

==TAE socket==
A typical TAE installation is a multi-socket junction box with at least one N connector and one F connector socket in the box, but having usually two N and one F connector. Up to three N connectors are possible. Network service enters the box and connects to pins 1 and 2 on the right-most N connector. Service is daisy-chained from pins 5 and 6 on the N connector to pins 1 and 2 on the next N connector to the left. The F connector is attached to pins 5 and 6 on the last N connector at the end of the chain.

==TAE plug==
(Image shown with flat side of connector down and the metallic pins facing you. The cable pigtail exits at the bottom of the connector)

When wiring a TAE plug, a mirror image of the illustration (pins 1 through 3 are on the left side) should be used, if wiring the connector with the flat side up.

== Observations ==

As the TAE connector does not have gold contacts, the contacts may oxidize, which can cause sizzling and crackling noises in analog voice transmission.

Looping the a2 and b2 wires out of the TAE is related to the routing the line through instruments in a house in order that no extension may overhear another.

<text>The Indianapolis Jets were a Basketball Association of America (BAA) team based in Indianapolis. They were founded as the Indianapolis Kautskys and used that name until the team joined the BAA. They played for one year in the BAA and then ceased operations due to the formation of the Indianapolis Olympians.

==Franchise history==
In 1931, Frank Kautsky, an Indianapolis grocer, formed a professional basketball team and named it the Indianapolis Kautskys. Their first game they ever played was on November 24, 1931, which they won 37–18 against the Kokomo 66ers in Kokomo, Indiana. Their first home game would be on December 11, where they&#x27;d win 31–17 over the Fort Wayne Firemen. After playing in the National Professional Basketball League (NPBL) in 1932–33 and the Midwest Basketball Conference (MBC) in the 1935–36 and 1936–37) seasons, the Kautskys became one of the original members of the newly formed National Basketball League (NBL) in 1937.

The franchise&#x27;s best season was in 1946–47; led by Arnie Risen, they set the franchise mark for most wins (27) and won the World Professional Basketball Tournament.

With the Minneapolis Lakers, Rochester Royals, and Fort Wayne Pistons, the team moved to the Basketball Association of America (BAA) for the 1948–49 season. At that time the team&#x27;s name was changed to the Indianapolis Jets because the BAA prevented its teams from having commercial sponsors, similar to how the Fort Wayne Pistons removed the Zollner sponsor from their original name.

Following the 1948–49 season, the Jets folded alongside the Providence Steamrollers on August 3, 1949. This coincided with the BAA and the NBL merging to form the National Basketball Association (NBA). For the 1949–50 season, a new Indianapolis franchise, the Indianapolis Olympians, was created.

<text>The Indianapolis Olympians were a founding National Basketball Association (NBA) team based in Indianapolis. They were founded in 1949 and folded in 1953. Their home arena was Butler Fieldhouse on the campus of Butler University, now known as Hinkle Fieldhouse.

==Franchise history==
The Olympians were founded in 1949 and were originally slated to play in the National Basketball League (NBL). However, with the merger of the NBL and the Basketball Association of America, the franchise played its first games in the newly formed National Basketball Association (NBA). The Olympians were led by University of Kentucky alumni Alex Groza and Ralph Beard, both of whom were key contributors on the gold medal winning 1948 US Olympic basketball team. Olympic team members Wallace Jones and Cliff Barker (both also Kentucky alumni) also played on the team. An Olympic alternate and UK grad, Joe Holland, played forward for the Indianapolis team through the 1952 season.

After the 1951 season, Groza and Beard were suspended from the NBA for life by commissioner Maurice Podoloff when the players admitted point shaving during their college careers. The Olympians finished with a 28–43 record in 1953, and folded after that season on April 23, 1953. The Olympians compiled a 132–137 record in four seasons in the NBA. 

Indianapolis would not have an NBA team until 1976 when the Indiana Pacers were one of the four teams admitted from the American Basketball Association in the ABA–NBA merger.

The Olympians still hold the distinction of being the winning team in the longest game in NBA history—they were the 75–73 victors in a six-overtime game against the Rochester Royals in a game played on January 6, 1951.

<text>The Pittsburgh Ironmen were a charter member of the Basketball Association of America (a forerunner of the National Basketball Association). The team was based in Pittsburgh and played at Duquesne Gardens.

They ended their only season in the BAA in 1946–47 with a record of 15–45 with a .250 winning percentage, finishing in fifth and last place in the Western Division and worst overall in the league. According to Nate Silver and Reuben Fischer-Baum, applying the Elo rating system, this was, through 2017, the worst season ever by a professional basketball team in a major league, even though the 1972–73 Philadelphia 76ers ended the season with only 9 wins against 73 losses for a .110 winning percentage, as well as the 2011-12 Charlotte Bobcats who ended their season with 7 wins and 59 losses for a .106 winning percentage. The team were awarded the first overall pick in the league&#x27;s inaugural 1947 draft, where they selected Clifton McNeely. However, the Ironmen would fold before the start of the 1947–48 BAA season, joining the Toronto Huskies as teams that ceased operations on July 27, 1947, along with the Detroit Falcons and Cleveland Rebels, to be the first four teams to officially become defunct in the BAA/NBA.

<doc id="775373" wikidata="Q1930689" url="?curid=775373" title="Thinker's Library">
<text>The Thinker&#x27;s Library was a series of 140 hardcover books published between 1929 and 1951 for the Rationalist Press Association by Watts &amp; Co., London, a company founded by the brothers John and Charles Watts and then run by the latter&#x27;s son Charles Albert Watts. The name was suggested by Archibald Robertson, a member of the company&#x27;s board of directors, who took an active interest in setting up the series and was later to write several volumes himself. The Thinker’s Library was intended as a successor to the cheap paperback “Sixpenny Reprints” from the same publisher, the aim being to bring humanist, philosophical and scientific works to as wide an audience as possible. Unlike the previous series, the volumes in the Thinker’s Library were small hardbacks (6 ½ x 4 ¼ inches) bound in brown clothette, with grey dustjackets, priced at one shilling. The covers of the early editions featured title, author’s name and a brief description of the book between Doric columns, with the image of Rodin’s The Thinker at the foot. The design would change several times over the course of the series, but the figure of the Thinker remained ever-present.

The library covered a wide range of subjects with a broadly humanist slant. The lists of titles occasionally published in individual volumes were arranged under these headings: General Philosophy, Psychology, Anthropology, General Science, Religion, History, Fiction and Miscellaneous. The last group included collections of essays by several writers, drama (a volume containing two plays by Euripides), poetry (James Thomson’s &quot;The City of Dreadful Night&quot;) and memoirs (the Autobiography of Charles Darwin). The focus was initially on reprints, often abridgements of, or selections from, longer works from well-known free-thinking writers; Darwin, J. S. Mill, H. G. Wells and Herbert Spencer were among those represented in the first ten volumes. However, as the series continued it focused more and more on original titles. The first of these to be published in the series was A. E. Mander’s &quot;Psychology for Everyman (And Woman)&quot; in 1935; reprinted several times, it was to sell over 400,000 copies, and was followed by the same author’s &quot;Clearer Thinking: Logic for Everyman&quot; the following year. Further original titles were contributed by J. A. C. Brown, Adam Gowans Whyte, Sir Arthur Smith Woodward and George Godwin, among others, and it was Godwin&#x27;s &quot;The Great Revivalists&quot; that brought the series to a close in 1951.

===Overview===
The Redskins played in three professional leagues and as an independent team. The leagues were, in order, the National Basketball League (NBL); the National Basketball Association (charter member), and the National Professional Basketball League (NPBL).

The team originated in 1933 from informal clubs which were sponsored by local businesses. During their first few years of existence, they would primarily play under the moniker of the Enzo Jels, but they would also sometimes play under the alternative moniker of &quot;The Ballhorns&quot; (or rather, just Ballhorns) starting in 1934 and in a brief period of time in 1935 played under the moniker of &quot;Art Images&quot; due to their Art Image during that time. They joined the NBL by 1938 as the Red Skins, owned by a syndicate. The Red Skins played in the NBL from 1938 to 1949, led the league in defense five times, appeared in five championship series and won the 1942–43 title, defeating the league-leading Fort Wayne Zollner Pistons (today&#x27;s Detroit Pistons) in the finals.

They were undone by the merger of the NBL and the BAA. The other league which merged to form the NBA (the Basketball Association of America) had more money, played in larger cities, and generally fielded better teams.

The Red Skins were one of seven franchises which quickly left the NBA. The league contracted after the 1949–1950 season, losing six teams; the Anderson Packers, Sheboygan Red Skins and Waterloo Hawks jumped to the NPBL, and the Chicago Stags, Denver Nuggets and St. Louis Bombers folded. The NBA shrank from 17 teams to 11 before the 1950–1951 season began. The Washington Capitols folded midway through the season, reducing the number of teams in the league to ten.

The Red Skins did not fit well, left the league, and joined the short-lived NPBL. When that league folded, the team returned to its independent roots for one more year of play before it also disappeared.

===Early years===
The team formed in Sheboygan as the Ballhorns in 1933. Sponsors changed every couple of years, and the team changed its name to match its current sponsor. Successful playing regional rivals and distant touring teams, they were invited to join the fledgling NBL in 1938. Now a full-time professional organization with an extensive traveling schedule, it took more than one local business to support the team. A syndicate of Sheboygan community members incorporated the team as the Red Skins, and they gradually became successful.

====Barnstorming roots====
Before joining the NBL, Sheboygan had developed a reputation in the Midwest during the early 1930s for successful industrial-league and barnstorming teams. The Ballhorns, sponsored by a local furniture store and funeral parlor, began in 1933; local tailor and dry cleaner Art Imig took over in 1935, and gelatin producer Enzo-Pac sponsored the team two years later.

Brothers Johnny and Joe &quot;Scoop&quot; Posewitz, Les Kuplic, Slim Lonsdorf, Carl Roth, Pete and Dugan Norris, and John Cinealis were among the better Sheboygan players during the decade. The Jack Mann, one of the first outstanding Black players in the game, starred at center during the 1936–37 season. In 1937–38, they had a 17–3 record against teams such as the New York Renaissance, Harlem Globetrotters, New York Celtics and Chicago Duffy Florals.

The team had a friendly rivalry with the Oshkosh All-Stars. The All-Stars&#x27; founder and president was Lon Darling, who helped found the NBL in 1937 and became league president the following year.

====Transition to professional team====
After the successful 1937–38 season, the Enzo Jels were admitted to the NBL on June 11, 1938, at the league meeting in Oshkosh, Wisconsin with help from Darling. They were soon taken over by a group of local business leaders and renamed the Red Skins. Their first coach was Edwin &quot;Doc&quot; Schutte, a local dentist.

After compiling an 11–17 record in his only season, Schutte stepped down to devote more time to his practice. The Red Skins were consistent winners under attorney and coach Frank Zummach from 1939 to 1942, including a spot opposite the Oshkosh All-Stars in the 1941 NBL finals. Zummach (an assistant coach at Marquette University for six seasons) formed his team around Marquette alumni, including All-American Dave Quabius, Glenn R. &quot;Sparky&quot; Adams, George Hesik, Bill McDonald and Paul Sokody. Sandlotter Otto Kolar, from Cicero, Illinois, was rated one of the Midwest&#x27;s best guards and ran the Red Skins offense.

====Arenas====

The Red Skins left the 1,500-seat Eagles Auditorium in downtown Sheboygan in late 1942 and moved into the 3,500-seat Sheboygan Municipal Auditorium and Armory, five blocks away near Lake Michigan. The Eagles Auditorium, part of the Playdium building, was destroyed by fire in 1977.

Known as &quot;the Armory,&quot; the armory was a WPA project and contained the NBL&#x27;s largest floor at the time: . It was added to Wisconsin&#x27;s register of historic places in 2019.

===Middle years===

====NBL title====
The Red Skins reached their zenith in 1942–43 under coach Carl Roth, who had played for Sheboygan&#x27;s industrial-league powerhouses during the 1930s and on the first Red Skins team in 1938–39. The late-season acquisition of Hall of Fame guard Buddy Jeannette, who joined Sheboygan for their last four regular-season games and the playoffs and commuted from his home in Rochester, New York, was a significant factor in the team&#x27;s 1943 NBL title. Jeannette, who worked at a Rochester defense plant and traveled to Sheboygan games primarily on weekends, averaged 15.5 points per game when final scores hovered in the 30s and 40s. Other major contributors to Sheboygan&#x27;s championship team were NBL rookie of the year Ken Buehler, all-league players Ed Dancker and Ken Suesens, and shooter Rube Lautenschlager. The team received the inaugural Naismith Memorial Trophy.

====Continued success====
After winning their only NBL title, the Red Skins continued to be one of the strongest teams in professional basketball and appeared in the next three championship series (1944, 1945 and 1946) behind Mike Novaka former All-American from Loyolaand Dancker: a player who honed his skills in the Milwaukee recreational leagues. Suesens, Lautenschlager, Dick Schulz, Tony Kelly, Al Lucas, Al Moschetti and Bobby Holm were other key Red Skins during this period. The signing of Lucas, Moschetti and Holm by Basketball Hall of Famer Dutch Dehnert in 1944 was the team&#x27;s first acquisition of a group of name players from the East Coast.

Sheboygan lost in the finals to Fort Wayne in 1944 and 1945, the latter after a 2–0 lead in the best-of-five series. They lost in 1946 to the powerhouse Rochester Royals, who had Hall of Famers Al Cervi, Bob Davies and Red Holzman. Dehnert coached the Red Skins to consecutive divisional titles, leaving after the 1945–46 season to coach the Cleveland Rebels of the Basketball Association of America.

Sheboygan remained among the NBL&#x27;s elite teams, securing playoff berths in 1947 and 1949. Before the 1946–47 season, the Red Skins were the first NBL team to fly to the West Coast. They played at Los Angeles&#x27; Grand Olympic Auditorium and lost two close games to the Los Angeles Red Devils, whose best player was UCLA alumnus Jackie Robinson; the following spring, Robinson broke baseball&#x27;s color barrier. Sheboygan finished the season with a 26–18 record (two games behind first-place Oshkosh in the Western Division), but the Red Skins lost to the All-Stars 49–47 in the fifthand decidinggame of their first-round playoff.

====Rebuilding====
For about a month in December 1947, Hall of Fame player Bobby McDermott was a player-coach for the Red Skins. He was obtained from the Chicago American Gears after the Professional Basketball League of America folded the previous month. McDermott played in 16 games for Sheboygan, scoring 138 points. As coach, he took the reins from Doxie Moore and had a 4–5 record. Moore resumed coaching Sheboygan after McDermott left to join the Tri-Cities Blackhawks in January 1948. The season was one of the Red Skins&#x27; most disappointing; the team was aging and in disarray, with a 23–37 record.

In 1948–49 (the NBL&#x27;s last season) the Red Skins unveiled a fresh group of stars, including Kentucky All-American Bob Brannum, Valparaiso star Milt Schoon, Texas guard Danny Wagner, Washington guard Merlin &quot;Boody&quot; Gilbertson, Iowa center Noble Jorgensen and Wisconsin guard Bobby Cook. With holdovers Mike Todorovich (a first-team NBL pick in 1947–48), Wisconsin forward Paul Cloyd, University of Toledo guard Bob Bolyard, Northwestern football and basketball All-American Max Morris and player-coach Suesens (who had starred at Iowa, where he roomed with Heisman Trophy winner Nile Kinnick), the Red Skins finished their 11th season in the NBL with a 35–29 record.

Only the Oshkosh All-Stars appeared in more NBL championship series (six) than Sheboygan, or played more seasons in the league (12). The Red Skins made the NBL playoffs eight times and were invited to appear in nearly every prestigious World Pro Tournament held in Chicago. Their best finish in Chicago was in 1939, when they lost the consolation championship to the Harlem Globetrotters.

===Final years===
After the 1948–1949 season, the team went into decline due to changes in professional basketball. Although the rival BAA had formed a few years earlier and the leagues saw an opportunity to expand the game&#x27;s appeal through a merger, many NBL teams could not compete at the BAA level; they did not have corporate money or a big-city fan base. The mismatch drove many former NBL teams to leave after one season, including the Red Skins.

Those teams attempted to recover by forming a new league, but it also only lasted one season. The Red Skins tried to continue, but failed to form another new league and closed after an independent run during the 1951–1952 season.

====NBA charter member====
On August 3, 1949, Sheboygan and six other NBL teams merged with the 10-team BAA to become the National Basketball Association. The Red Skins, who played in the NBA&#x27;s smallest arena (and market), competed in the 1949–50 season with Suesens as coach and finished with a 22–40 record: fourth place in the six-team Western Division. When Oshkosh folded soon after the merger, Sheboygan became the country&#x27;s oldest professional basketball franchise. The Red Skins had a 7–2 start with home victories against the Boston Celtics, New York Knicks, Rochester Royals, and Indianapolis Olympians.

The most spectacular win of the 1949–50 season was on January 5, 1950, when they defeated George Mikan and the Minneapolis Lakers 85–82 in front of a standing-room-only crowd of 3,800 fans at the Armory. Four future Hall of Famers were on the floor for Minneapolis that Thursday night: Mikan (who scored 42 points), Jim Pollard, Vern Mikkelsen and Slater Martin. The Lakers&#x27; coach was Hall of Famer John Kundla. The victory against that season&#x27;s eventual NBA champion gave the Red Skins a 13–13 record, after which injuries took their toll and the team faded. They qualified for the playoffs, however, where they nearly upset the Western Division champion Indianapolis Olympians in a best-of-three series.

====National Professional Basketball League====
The team was unwelcome in the NBA during their first season. Ned Irish, president of the New York Knicks, refused to participate in the same league as the &quot;bush leagues&quot;: small-city charter NBA teams from the NBL, such as the Red Skins, Waterloo Hawks and Anderson Packers. Sheboygan withdrew from the NBA on April 24, 1950, and joined the new National Professional Basketball League with several other NBA teams.

The NPBL formed around the former NBL/NBA teams, with larger-market teams added. The charter teams were the East Division Red Skins, Anderson Packers, Louisville Alumnites and Grand Rapids Hornets, and the West Division Denver Refiners/Evansville Agogans, Saint Paul Lights, Kansas City Hi-Spots and Waterloo Hawks. Sheboygan posted the NPBL&#x27;s best record (29–16) in 1950–51. Sheboygan and Waterloo finished first in their respective divisions, but the league did not conduct a playoff and dissolved at the end of the regular season. Both teams claimed the championship, based on division play.

====Attempt to survive====
In mid-1951, longtime Red Skins president Magnus Brinkman led a drive to form a league which would have been called the Western Basketball Association, consisting of eight to 10 teams and seeking two other NBA castoffs: the Waterloo Hawks and the Anderson Packers. Competition from the NBA became too great, however, and the effort failed.

The Red Skins played one season of independent basketball, in 1951–52, before dissolving. Bobby Cook, who had scored an NBA-record 44 points in a Red Skins home game against the Denver Nuggets in January 1950, coached the team. The final Sheboygan Red Skins team consisted of several former University of Wisconsin players and compiled a winning record, primarily playing other independent Midwest teams. Attendance was low, however, and the team discontinued operations after losing its final game to the College All-Stars at the Armory.

<text>The Toronto Huskies were a team in the Basketball Association of America (BAA), which was a forerunner of the National Basketball Association (NBA), during the 1946–47 season. They were based in Toronto. The team compiled a 22–38 win–loss record in its only season before disbanding in the summer of 1947.

==Franchise history==

In 1946, a group of owners and operators of some of the larger arenas in America held a meeting in New York, to establish the Basketball Association of America (now the NBA). The majority of the would-be basketball owners were involved with the National Hockey League and wanted to fill empty dates. The only Canadian delegation invited was from Maple Leaf Gardens: Frank Selke Sr., who was in charge of the Gardens while Conn Smythe was overseas, got in touch with Ben Newman (who had coached two Canadian national championship teams and had staged a game in the Gardens previously.) The franchise cost approximately $150,000 which was funded mostly from Bay Street backers in Toronto. The major partners in the ownership group were Eric Cradock (co-owner of the Montreal Alouettes football team), Harold Shannon and Newman.

&quot;I honestly thought we could have made a go of the team,&quot; Newman once said, &quot;but we were given the worst possible home dates.&quot; The hardships started almost immediately when Newman&#x27;s father took ill soon after the first game, forcing Newman to leave the Huskies to take over the family scrap and steel metal business in St. Catharines, Ontario. Lack of co-operation from the local media and lack of talent on the court kept crowds low, despite the use of such gimmicks that included free stockings to all women in attendance.

On November 1, 1946, they hosted the first game in BAA league history losing 68–66 to the New York Knickerbockers before an opening night crowd of 7,090. Ossie Schectman scored the opening basket for the New York Knickerbockers against the Toronto Huskies.

On that night, anyone taller than George Nostrand, the tallest Husky at 6&#x27;8&quot;, was given free admission. Attendance quickly dwindled and the &quot;Toronto Star&quot; published an estimate that team owners lost $100,000 in one season of operations.

Managing director of the Huskies was Lew Hayman, coach and general manager of the Alouettes and future president of the Toronto Argonauts and the Canadian Football League, who had been a star basketball player at Syracuse University. Charles Watson was team president. Ben Newman and Salter Hayden were the other co-founders. Annis Stukus was also a member of the front office.

Future all-star Ed Sadowski began the season as player-coach and was initially the team&#x27;s top player. Three weeks into the season, with the team off to a poor start, the &quot;Star&quot; reported that the players had divided into two or three cliques that rarely spoke to each other. Sadowski&#x27;s coaching was openly questioned and, just a month after the first game, he quit the team. After four games with interim coaches (Hayman coached one game, and Huskies player Dick Fitzgerald ruled the bench for three games), Hayman hired former Major League Baseball player Red Rolfe, who had also been the coach of Yale University&#x27;s basketball team.

Hayman traded the playing rights to Sadowski to the Cleveland Rebels for Leo Mogus, at the time one of the league&#x27;s top scorers. Hayman had previously traded Nostrand to the Rebels for another 6&#x27;9&quot; giant, Kleggie Hermsen. In February 1947 the Huskies acquired the tallest player in the league, 7&#x27;1&quot; Ralph Siewert, from the St. Louis Bombers. Despite his height, Siewert averaged just 1.1 points per game with the Huskies and had the lowest field goal percentage on the team.

The team&#x27;s leading scorer was Mike McCarron, with 649 points in 60 games. He and Fitzgerald were the only players to appear in every game. Sadowski had the most points per game, averaging 19.1 points over his 10 games with the Huskies. Hank Biasatti and Gino Sovran were the only Canadians on the Huskies, each playing just six games.

Neither of the Huskies&#x27; head coaches (or their interim coaches) would coach another game in the BAA/NBA after their time in Toronto. Of the 20 players to make it to the floor for the Huskies, only five would go on to play 10 or more games in the BAA/NBA following the 1946–47 season: Sadowski, Mogus, Hermsen, Nostrand, and Dick Schulz. Hermsen was the last active NBA player from the Huskies roster, retiring in 1953 as a member of the Indianapolis Olympians.

The Huskies would continue to stick around long enough to participate in the inaugural 1947 BAA draft at The Leland Hotel, with them having the #2 pick and selecting guard/forward Glen Selbo from the University of Wisconsin with it alongside multiple other players like forward/center Red Rocha from Oregon State University (who would be traded to the St. Louis Bombers), Frank Broyles from the Georgia School of Technology (who later became a college football coach and athletic director), former MLB player Wimpy Quinn from the University of Oregon, and Paul Hoffman from Purdue University. However, they would later join the Pittsburgh Ironmen in folding their teams simultaneously on July 27, 1947, joining the Detroit Falcons from July 9 and Cleveland Rebels from June 9 as the first four BAA (now NBA) teams to ever fold in the league&#x27;s existence.

===Bring back the Huskies===
Reviving the Huskies name was originally considered at the time of selecting a name for Toronto&#x27;s new NBA team in 1995 (marking a return of professional basketball to the city after a 48-year absence). However, management ruled that option out when it became apparent there was no way to design a suitable logo that didn&#x27;t resemble that of the Minnesota Timberwolves, so they became the Toronto Raptors instead. Nevertheless, a group of fans have created a &#x27;Bring back the Huskies&#x27; campaign, complete with a website, TorontoHuskies.org, with the intent of having the franchise revert to the historical &#x27;Huskies&#x27; name.

On December 8, 2009, the Raptors introduced a throwback jersey to commemorate the Huskies. The uniforms were the same, except for the different team name and the shorts were longer than the originals. These uniforms were worn in six games in the 2009–10 season and have since been used as &quot;retro&quot; jerseys. On August 23, 2016, the Raptors unveiled the Huskies throwbacks as new alternates, along with their Chinese New Year jerseys. An alternate Air Canada Centre floor with the Huskies dog logo at centre court and the Huskies logomark text at each end was also utilized by the Raptors on these retro nights.

==Season==
The Huskies played only a single season and never appeared in the playoffs.

<text>The Washington Capitols were a former Basketball Association of America (forerunner of the National Basketball Association) team based in Washington, D.C. from 1946 to 1951. The team was coached from 1946 to 1949 by NBA Hall of Famer Red Auerbach.

==History==

The team was founded in 1946 as a charter BAA team; it became a charter NBA team in 1949. It folded on January 9, 1951 (with a 10–25 record).

The Capitols were one of seven teams that quickly left the NBA: The NBA contracted after the 1949–1950 season, losing six teams: The Anderson Packers, Sheboygan Red Skins and Waterloo Hawks jumped to the NPBL, while the Chicago Stags, Denver Nuggets and St. Louis Bombers folded. The league went from 17 teams to 11 before the 1950–1951 season started. Midway through the 1950–1951 season, the Washington Capitols folded as well, bringing the number of teams in the league down to ten.

Earl Lloyd, the first African American athlete to play for an NBA team, debuted for the Capitols in Rochester, New York on October 31, 1950.

The franchise played the 1951–52 season in the American Basketball League, but the team folded again in January, 1952. The main reason why the team folded for the second time was related to them and the ABL being sued by the NBA if the new Capitols tried to take the NBA team name&#x27;s history from them as well.

The teams wore green and white. The NBA returned to the Washington, D.C. area in 1973, when the Baltimore Bullets became the Capital Bullets, now known as the Washington Wizards.

The Capitols&#x27; 81.7 win percentage in the BAA&#x27;s inaugural season was the highest in the NBA until surpassed by the Philadelphia 76ers in 1966–67. The Capitols captured two Divisional Championships: (1946–47 and 1948–49) and made the playoffs in (1947, 1948 tie-breaker, 1949 and 1950).

==Winning streaks==

The Washington Capitols are also noteworthy for two long win streaks during their short history. In 1946, the Capitols won 17 straight games — a single season streak that remained the NBA&#x27;s longest until 1969. The 15–0 start of the 1948–49 team was the best in NBA history until the Golden State Warriors broke it in 2015–16 by starting 24–0, though the Houston Rockets had previously tied the Capitols&#x27; record in 1993–94, and later, tied by the Cleveland Cavaliers in 2024–25.

==The arena==
The Capitols played in historic Uline Arena, located at 1132, 1140, and 1146 3rd St. NE, Washington, District of Columbia. The capacity was 7,500. The facility still exists and has been repurposed into retail and office space.

==Season-by-season records==


 The inaugural 1947 BAA Playoffs did not establish Eastern and Western champions and generated one finalist from the East, one from the West, only by coincidence. Washington and Chicago won the Eastern and Western Divisions and met in a best-of-seven series to determine one league championship finalist. (Washington lost the first two games, both at home, by 16 points each and lost the series four games to two; every game but the last was decided by at least 10 points.) Meanwhile, four runners-up played best-of-three matches to determine the other finalist. Philadelphia, second in the East, won that runners-up bracket and defeated Chicago in a best-of-seven series to win the BAA championship.

 The Capitols folded midway during the season on January 9, 1951.

<text>The Waterloo Hawks were a National Basketball League and National Basketball Association team based in Waterloo, Iowa. The Hawks remain the only sports franchise ever based in Iowa from any of the current Big Four Leagues.

==Franchise history==

The Waterloo Hawks were founded in 1948, playing in the National Basketball League. In 1949, the National Basketball League was absorbed by its rival, the Basketball Association of America, forming the National Basketball Association; the Hawks were thus a founding member of the NBA. When the Hawks joined the NBA properly, their roster consisted of players that previously played for the Hammond Calumet Buccaneers in the previous and final season of the NBL. In the 1949–1950 season, their first and only one in the NBA, they finished 19–43, fifth out of six in the Western Division. The Waterloo Hawks are of no relation to the current-day Atlanta Hawks franchise; at the time of Waterloo&#x27;s existence in the NBA, the latter franchise was based in Moline, Illinois as the Tri-Cities Blackhawks (and moved to Milwaukee when Waterloo&#x27;s franchise folded).

The National Basketball Association contracted after the 1949–1950 season. The league went from 17 teams to 11 before the 1950–1951 season started. Midway through the 1950–1951 season, the Washington Capitols folded as well, bringing the number of teams in the league down to ten.

Meanwhile, the National Professional Basketball League was formed around the former NBA teams, with teams added in new larger markets. The charter teams were the East Division: Sheboygan Redskins (Former NBA), Anderson Packers (Former NBA), Louisville Alumnites and Grand Rapids Hornets. West Division: Denver Refiners/Evansville Agogans, Saint Paul Lights, Kansas City Hi-Spots and Waterloo Hawks (Former NBA).

==The arena==
The Waterloo Hawks played at The Hippodrome. The arena is still in use today and is located at 250 Ansborough Ave, Waterloo, IA 50701.

When the NBA played in Waterloo the arena is often referred to as McElroy Auditorium. The confusion stems from an NBA publication from the 1960s which erroneously listed the current name of the arena and not its historical name.
