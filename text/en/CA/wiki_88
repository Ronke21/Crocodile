<text>Reynaldo Hahn de Echenagucia (9 August 1874 – 28 January 1947) was a Venezuelan-born French composer, conductor, music critic, and singer. He is best known for his songs – &quot;mélodies&quot; – of which he wrote more than 100.

Hahn was born in Caracas but his family moved to Paris when he was a child, and he lived most of his life there. Following the success of his song &quot;Si mes vers avaient des ailes&quot; (If my verses had wings), written when he was aged 14, he became a prominent member of &quot;fin de siècle&quot; French society. Among his closest friends were Sarah Bernhardt and Marcel Proust. After the First World War, in which he served in the army, Hahn adapted to new musical and theatrical trends and enjoyed successes with his first opérette, &quot;Ciboulette&quot; (1923) and a collaboration with Sacha Guitry, the musical comedy &quot;Mozart&quot; (1926). During the Second World War Hahn, who was of Jewish descent, took refuge in Monaco, returning to Paris in 1945 where he was appointed director of the Opéra. He died in Paris in 1947, aged 72.

Hahn was a prolific composer. His vocal works include secular and sacred pieces, lyric scenes, cantatas, oratorios, operas, comic operas, and operettas. Orchestral works include concertos ballets, tone poems, incidental music for plays and films. He wrote a range of chamber music, and piano works. He sang as well as played his own songs, and made recordings as a soloist and accompanying other performers. After his death his music was neglected but from the late 20th century onward increasing interest has led to frequent performances of many of his works and recordings of all his songs and piano work, much of his orchestral music and some of his stage works.

==Life and career==
===Early years===
Hahn was born in Caracas, Venezuela, on 9 August 1874, the youngest child of Carlos (&quot;né&quot; Karl) Hahn (1822–1897) and his wife Elena María &quot;née&quot; de Echenagucia (1831–1912). Carlos Hahn, the eldest son of a Jewish family in Hamburg, emigrated to Venezuela in 1845 at the age of twenty-two, making a highly successful business career there. He converted to Roman Catholicism to marry Elena de Echenagucia; she was of Spanish descent on her father&#x27;s side and Dutch-English on her mother&#x27;s. When his friend and associate Antonio Guzmán Blanco became president of the country in 1876, Carlos became Blanco&#x27;s financial adviser. The Hahns had eleven or twelve children, nine of whom lived to adulthood. Reynaldo, known as &quot;Nano&quot;, was the youngest, twenty years younger than his eldest brother. He was brought up speaking fluent German, Spanish and (having a British nanny) English.

When Blanco&#x27;s first term of office came to an end in 1877, the Hahn family left Venezuela and settled in Paris, where they had relations and well-connected friends. It was France that, as a 21st-century writer put it, would &quot;determine and define Hahn&#x27;s musical identity in later life&quot;. Among the family&#x27;s Parisian friends was Princess Mathilde, niece of Napoleon I; the young Hahn sang for her, and made his public debut at the age of six, at a musical soirée in her drawing room. He began composition lessons with an Italian teacher when he was eight.

In 1885, aged eleven, Hahn was admitted to the Paris Conservatoire&#x27;s preparatory course. He went on to study piano with Émile Decombes (in the same class as Maurice Ravel and Alfred Cortot), harmony with Albert Lavignac and Théodore Dubois, and composition with Charles Gounod and Jules Massenet. The last became Hahn&#x27;s lifelong friend and mentor. As a young man Massenet had won France&#x27;s top musical scholarship, the Prix de Rome, but Hahn could not emulate him: only French nationals were eligible, and the Hahns had not taken French citizenship. Besides, Massenet counselled, with rich parents Hahn did not need the scholarship as his less affluent colleagues did. Through Massenet, Hahn met Camille Saint-Saëns, with whom he studied privately in addition to his Conservatoire lessons.

While still a student Hahn had an early success with his mélodie &quot;Si mes vers avaient des ailes&quot; (If my verses had wings) to a poem by Victor Hugo. The song was among a set of Hahn&#x27;s mélodies published by the leading music publisher Hartmann et Cie in 1890. &quot;Le Figaro&quot; took it up – &quot;We feel we must reproduce this graceful piece which obviously denotes a delicate and original musician&quot; – and devoted half a broadsheet page to printing the words and music.

Hahn dedicated &quot;Si mes vers avaient des ailes&quot; to his sister Maria, who had married the painter Raimundo de Madrazo y Garreta. At their house Hahn met many of the leading figures in the arts, including Alphonse Daudet, for whose play &quot;L&#x27;obstacle&quot; the teenaged Hahn composed incidental music. The play was presented at the Théâtre du Gymnase in December 1890. Daudet called Hahn&#x27;s music his &quot;chère musique preferée&quot;. At the Daudets&#x27; house in 1893 the singer Sybil Sanderson premiered Hahn&#x27;s &quot;Chansons grises&quot;, settings of poems by Paul Verlaine. The poet was present and was moved to tears by Hahn&#x27;s settings of his verse. Stéphane Mallarmé was also present, and wrote:

&lt;poem lang=&quot;fr&quot; style=&quot;margin-left:3em; float:left;&quot;&gt;Le pleur qui chante au langage
Du poète, Reynaldo
Hahn tendrement le dégage
Comme en l&#x27;allée un jet d&#x27;eau.
&lt;/poem&gt;
&lt;poem style=&quot;margin-left:3em; float:left;&quot;&gt;The weeping that sings in the words
Of the poet, Reynaldo
Hahn tenderly releases it
Like a fountain on the pathway.
&lt;/poem&gt;

In the early 1890s Hahn worked on his first opera &quot;L&#x27;île du rêve&quot;, &quot;a Polynesian idyll&quot;, written at Massenet&#x27;s behest. During this period he met Marcel Proust for the first time, at Madeleine Lemaire&#x27;s salon on 22 May 1894. As far as is known, the 19-year-old Hahn&#x27;s romantic attachments before then had been intimate but platonic relationships with the famous Parisienne beauties Cléo de Mérode and Liane de Pougy. Until this point, he had been uneasy to the point of hostility about homosexuality and homosexuals, but the two men quickly began an intense love affair, Proust&#x27;s only real liaison. Their affair lasted for only two years, but it evolved into a lifelong close friendship. Proust wrote, &quot;Everything I have ever done has always been thanks to Reynaldo.&quot; The music scholar James Harding writes about the fictional Vinteuil Sonata: &quot;It was Hahn who suggested to Proust the famous &quot;petite phrase&quot; which recurs symbolically throughout &quot;À la recherche du temps perdu&quot; and which is none other than a haunting theme from Saint-Saëns&#x27;s D minor violin sonata&quot;.

Hahn completed his studies at the Conservatoire satisfactorily but &quot;without producing sparks in examinations and competitions&quot;, as his biographer Jacques Depaulis puts it. Massenet resigned from the faculty in May 1896, and Hahn left at the same time as his mentor.

===1896 to 1913===
In 1896 Proust wrote the words and Hahn the music for &quot;Portraits de peintres&quot; for reciter and piano, premiered at the house of Madeleine Lemaire, where they had met. Later in that year Hahn formed another of his closest friendships: he had long admired the actress Sarah Bernhardt, and at the end of 1896 he met her and quickly became part of her inner circle of friends and helpers. He frequently visited her in her dressing room during and after performances, lunched with her at her Paris townhouse, travelled with her to London and on tour, and composed music for her productions.

&quot;L&#x27;île du rêve&quot; was premiered in 1898, when thanks to Massenet&#x27;s influence the Opéra-Comique staged the piece, with a fine cast, conducted by André Messager. The press notices were hostile, and the piece was withdrawn after seven performances. While it was in rehearsal Paris was agog at the Zola trial in the continuing Dreyfus affair. The affair sharply divided French opinion; Hahn, like Proust and Bernhardt, was in the Dreyfusard camp. The anti-Semitic overtones of the anti-Dreyfusard campaign disturbed him deeply, but his devotion to France was unshaken.
In 1898, following the success of his first set of 20 mélodies, published two years earlier, Hahn began composing a second set. which he worked on for more than 20 years. In the same year he started work on 12 &quot;Rondels&quot; for soloists, chorus and piano, completed the following year. In 1899, following the long tradition of French composers supplementing their income by writing music reviews, he became critic for &quot;La Presse&quot;.

In December 1902 Hahn&#x27;s second opera, &quot;La Carmélite&quot;, described as &quot;a musical comedy&quot;, with a libretto by Catulle Mendès, was premiered at the Opéra-Comique. Emma Calvé played the main role of Louise de La Vallière, Messager was once again the conductor, and the piece was lavishly mounted, but it was received politely rather than with enthusiasm, and did not gain a place in the operatic repertoire. Its prospects were not helped by the Opéra-Comique&#x27;s decision to yield to religious lobbyists and cut the climactic scene in which Louise takes the veil; that scene won critical praise as &quot;inspired&quot;, whereas the rest of the score was thought to be skilful, pretty and spirited but lacking in character.

Following this disappointment, Hahn turned his attention away from opera. In 1905 he composed one of his most popular works, the suite for chamber ensemble &quot;Le Bal de Béatrice d&#x27;Este&quot;; in &quot;Grove&#x27;s Dictionary of Music and Musicians&quot;, Patrick O&#x27;Connor observes that this work, &quot;conceived merely as a divertissement&quot;, has remained one of the composer&#x27;s best-known and most frequently performed.

Hahn began to attract notice as a conductor. Performances of &quot;Don Giovanni&quot; under his baton in 1903 were praised for his &quot;flexible and light touch&quot; and for his scholarly – and at the time unusual – fidelity to Mozart&#x27;s score. In 1906 he and Gustav Mahler were the conductors for the two operas given at the Salzburg Festival, celebrating Mozart&#x27;s 150th anniversary. Mahler conducted &quot;The Marriage of Figaro&quot;; Hahn conducted &quot;Don Giovanni&quot; with the Vienna Philharmonic and a cast including Lilli Lehmann and Geraldine Farrar.

In December 1907 Hahn became a naturalised French citizen. In that year he composed his set of six &quot;Songs and Madrigals&quot;, setting words by medieval and Renaissance French poets in which he incorporated music in the style of Antoine Boësset, court composer to Louis XIII.

Hahn followed the dances of &quot;Le Bal de Béatrice d&#x27;Este&quot; with two complete ballet scores, &quot;La Fête chez Thérèse&quot; (1910) and &quot;Le Dieu bleu&quot; (1912). The latter was the first ballet with a score by a French composer presented by Sergei Diaghilev&#x27;s Ballets russes; the premiere went well but the piece was overshadowed by two other ballets with French scores presented later in the season: Debussy&#x27;s &quot;L&#x27;Après-midi d&#x27;un faune&quot; and Ravel&#x27;s &quot;Daphnis et Chloé&quot;.

===1914 to 1929===
At the outbreak of war in 1914 Hahn, who was over the official age limit for conscription, volunteered for the army as a private. For most of the war he served as an adjutant&#x27;s clerk, working near the front, under frequent bombardment. When possible he continued to compose, writing music for his regiment, contributing to revues for the troops, and working on two new operas, one based on the &quot;Odyssey&quot; and the other on &quot;The Merchant of Venice&quot;. He set five verses by Robert Louis Stevenson as a song cycle for children. In 1917 he was promoted to corporal as a despatch rider, and in the last year of the war he was posted to the Ministry of War in Paris as a cipher clerk. For his wartime services he was awarded the Croix de guerre and appointed to the Legion of Honour.

When Hahn returned to civilian life, Cortot, director of the newly founded École Normale de Musique de Paris, appointed him professor of interpretation and singing. Hahn was known for the high standards he expected of singers, and published articles and a book, &quot;Du chant&quot; (1921), on interpretation and singing technique. In 1919 he met the tenor , with whom he began a lifelong and happy personal partnership.

In 1921 Hahn was invited by an old friend, the playwright Robert de Flers, to compose the music for an operetta for which Flers and his collaborator Francis de Croisset had written the libretto. Hahn had reservations: the piece was set in the market of Les Halles, which was the setting for Charles Lecocq&#x27;s opéra comique &quot;La fille de Madame Angot&quot;, written fifty years earlier but still immensely popular. Furthermore, the heroine was called Ciboulette, meaning &quot;chives&quot;, which Hahn thought unromantic, and the most interesting character was neither the heroine nor the hero, but their mentor, &quot;a sort of elderly Rodolfo out of &quot;La bohème&quot;&quot;. Nonetheless, Hahn accepted the invitation.

Between the start of work on &quot;Ciboulette&quot; and its premiere, Hahn lost his two closest friends. Proust died in November 1922 and Bernhardt the following March. He pressed on with work, and in April 1923 &quot;Ciboulette&quot; opened at the Théâtre des Variétés. It was well reviewed and was an enormous box office success. It was revived in Paris several times during Hahn&#x27;s lifetime, and has remained in the repertoire in France, with 21st-century revivals at the Opéra-Comique and elsewhere.

In 1924 Hahn was promoted to officer in the Legion of Honour. The following year he had the second big success of his theatrical career. The actor and playwright Sacha Guitry invited him to write the music for a new &quot;comédie musicale&quot; called &quot;Mozart&quot;. The piece was loosely based on the early life of the composer, and was to star Guitry and his wife, Yvonne Printemps, the latter &quot;en travesti&quot; as the young Mozart. Hahn agreed, and composed a score incorporating various extracts from Mozart&#x27;s works along with his own original music. The show opened in December 1925 at the Théâtre Édouard VII, receiving enthusiastic reviews: Messager, writing in &quot;Le Figaro&quot;, called it &quot;a piece of rare quality&quot;, and commented that the score was so good that it was hard to detect where Mozart&#x27;s music ended and Hahn&#x27;s began: this, he said, was the highest possible praise. The show was a popular success in Paris, with, for the time, an excellent run of seven months. The Guitrys then took the production to London in 1926, where it was well received. At the end of that year there were two versions running on Broadway: the Guitry company played the French original for a limited season, and an English translation ran at another theatre, starring Frank Cellier and Irene Bordoni.

===1930 to 1947===
In 1930 Hahn composed a piano concerto, premiered in February 1931 with its dedicatee, Magda Tagliaferro, as soloist and the composer conducting; according to &quot;Grove&quot; it became Hahn&#x27;s best-known concert work. Tagliaferro and Hahn later recorded the work for the gramophone; the recording has been reissued on CD. In 1931 Hahn wrote the music for the opérette &quot;Brummell&quot;. In 1933 he became &quot;Le Figaro&quot;&#x27;s music critic. In the same year, &quot;Ciboulette&quot; was filmed for the cinema. The young director Claude Autant-Lara made a fairly free adaptation of the stage work, with Simone Berriau in the title role; it cam out in Paris in November 1933, and was well received.

Hahn&#x27;s only major commission for the Paris Opéra was the work based on &quot;The Merchant of Venice&quot; that he had begun composing during the war. &quot;Le marchand de Venise&quot;, with a verse libretto by Miguel Zamacoïs, premiered in March 1935. It was received with enthusiasm, and although it was not revived in Paris during Hahn&#x27;s lifetime it had several new productions later. Guitry and Hahn worked together on another show, &quot;O mon bel inconnu&quot; (O My Beautiful Stranger, 1933), starring Arletty. The reviewer in &quot;Lyrica&quot; commented &quot;Is it operetta? No; comic opera? Not that, either; vaudeville? Not in the least. So what is it? I don&#x27;t know, but it is unpretentious and it is charming&quot;. He added, &quot;Neither of the two authors, so admirably gifted, gave the best of themselves, but the crumbs they nonchalantly let fall from their table are still enough to compose a nice meal&quot;. Hahn composed the music for two other musical comedies during the 1930s as well as a considerable quantity of incidental music for plays and films.

In the second half of the decade Hahn was again prominent as a conductor, directing performances of &quot;The Magic Flute&quot;, &quot;The Seraglio&quot; and &quot;The Marriage of Figaro&quot;. His fidelity to Mozart was remarked on in the press: after years of productions at the Opéra-Comique in which the composer&#x27;s recitatives in &quot;Figaro&quot; were replaced by spoken dialogue, Hahn used a new, more scholarly text edited by Adolphe Boschot. In the concert hall he formed musical partnerships with younger performers; in addition to Tagliafero, he regularly accompanied Ferrant and the soprano Ninon Vallin.

When the Germans occupied Paris in 1940, Hahn left for the south of France and then for neutral Monaco. He was less at risk there from Nazi anti-Semitic persecution, but narrowly avoided being killed by the explosion of a stray shell from a British submarine aimed at a German warship moored near his rooms on the seafront at Monte Carlo. He returned to Paris in February 1945, and was elected to the Institut de France&#x27;s Académie des Beaux-Arts, and appointed director of the Paris Opéra. His last concert work, the &quot;Concerto provençal&quot;, was premiered in a broadcast by Radiodiffusion Française on 30 July 1945 and given in concert the following April.

In 1946, together with Tagliafero and Vallin, Hahn made a concert tour, performing in London, Geneva, Brussels, Marseilles and Toulon. He was taken ill and an operation was performed to treat a brain tumour, which his doctors believed might have been caused by the explosion in Monte Carlo.

Hahn died in Paris on 28 January 1947, at the age of 72. He was buried in Père Lachaise Cemetery, near the grave of Proust.

==Works==
Graham Johnson writes that Hahn &quot;was never truly of the twentieth century&quot;; he was for many years regarded chiefly as evoking the spirit of fin de siècle Paris. He was not in sympathy with the more obviously modern music of the early decades of the 20th century, but he moved with the times. According to a 2020 analysis:

Hahn&#x27;s biographer Jacques Depaulis writing in 2006, comments that many composers suffer a period of neglect after their deaths and are then rediscovered, a process known in France as &quot;la traversée du désert&quot; – crossing the desert. In 1947 a British newspaper remarked that Hahn &quot;is hardly remembered today outside the boundaries of France&quot;. In 1961, 14 years after the composer&#x27;s death, the musicologist Hans Heinz Stuckenschmidt dismissed Hahn as &quot;a talented gossip who had a gift for grinding out operettas and little, tastefully performed ballads in limitless quantities&quot;. In the last decades of the 20th century there was a revival in interest in Hahn&#x27;s music: Johnson (2002) refers to &quot;an ever-widening range of his mélodies to be heard regularly on the concert platform&quot;.

===Mélodies===
Hahn is best known for his songs. He wrote just over 100; most were composed in the thirty-year period from 1888 to the end of the First World War, after which the demand for songs with piano accompaniment diminished and he turned to other forms. His style, in his early songs, reflects the influence of Massenet, but he regarded Gabriel Fauré as the supreme master of the mélodie, and favoured some of Fauré&#x27;s chosen poets, including Victor Hugo, Théophile Gautier and Paul Verlaine. He was only thirteen when he wrote the Hugo setting &quot;Si mes vers avaient des ailes&quot;, later included in his first collection of &quot;20 Mélodies&quot; (1895). Johnson writes that the song displays all the distinguishing marks of the composer&#x27;s style:
His first published set of songs was &quot;Chansons grises&quot; (Songs in Grey, 1890), which included a setting of Verlaine&#x27;s &quot;La bonne chanson&quot; that the poet preferred to Fauré&#x27;s well known version of it. The commentator James Day observes that the songs in the set display &quot;a maturity quite remarkable in a sixteen-year-old – and an empathy with the poet quite unexpected in a musician of any age&quot;.

After &quot;Chansons grises&quot; Hahn composed further song cycles over the next 25 years. &quot;Rondels&quot; (1898–99), with words by Charles d&#x27;Orléans, Théodore de Banville and Catulle Mendès, was an example of the composer&#x27;s fascination with the past, setting original and modern versions of the old rondel verse form. In &quot;Études latines&quot; (1900) Hahn set ten verses by Leconte de Lisle, evoking Graeco-Roman antiquity. In three of the songs the soloist and pianist are joined by a chorus. Hahn again experimented with combinations of voices in &quot;Venezia&quot; (1901), a set of six lyrics in Venetian dialect, in which the final song is a duet for tenor and soprano with chorus. For &quot;Les feuilles blessés&quot; (The Injured Leaves, 1901–1906) Hahn turned to a contemporary poet, Jean Moréas, known for his symbolist verse. In 1907 Hahn returned to older forms with &quot;Chansons et madrigaux&quot;, setting words by d&#x27;Orléans, Jean-Antoine de Baïf and others, in a cycle of six songs for four voices. &quot;Love Without Wings&quot; (1911) is a set of three verses in English by Mary Robinson, and Hahn again set English texts in &quot;Five Little Songs&quot; (1915), with verses by Robert Louis Stevenson. &quot;Grove&quot; lists a final cycle, &quot;Chansons espagnoles&quot; (1947).

In addition to the song cycles, two collections of Hahn&#x27;s mélodies, comprising twenty songs each, were published during his lifetime. Both sets include some songs previously published individually, and there were twelve other songs not part of a cycle or included in a published collection.

===Operas, opérettes and musical comedies===
Hahn completed five operas, and left an incomplete one. The first, &quot;L&#x27;Île du rêve&quot;, an &quot;idylle polynésienne&quot; in three acts, has a libretto by André Alexandre and Georges Hartmann, adapted from Pierre Loti&#x27;s semi-autobiographical 1880 novel &quot;Rarahu&quot; or &quot;Le Mariage de Loti&quot; set in Tahiti. It ran for seven performances in 1898, and was revived at Cannes in 1942, conducted by the composer, but was not seen again in Paris until 2016, when a production from the Théâtre de la Coupe d&#x27;Or, Rochefort was presented at the Théâtre de l&#x27;Athénée. Henri Büsser considered the work &quot;charming … very musical&quot;; it is through-composed and there are no set-piece numbers. Hahn makes use of leitmotifs, following the example of Massenet.

&quot;La Carmélite&quot; (1902), a period piece set in the reign of Louix XIV, made little impact, although its conductor, Messager, who was musical director at Covent Garden as well as at the Opéra Comique, considered staging it in London; the idea was not realised. Neither of Hahn&#x27;s next two operas – &quot;Nausicaa&quot; (1919, libretto by René Fauchois) and &quot;La Colombe de Bouddha&quot; (Buddha&#x27;s Dove, 1921), a one-act work with words by André Alexandre – was written for Paris, and neither was staged there. The former was given at the Opéra de Monte-Carlo, and the latter at the Théâtre du Casino municipal de Cannes, where Hahn conducted frequently. 

&quot;Le Marchand de Venise&quot; (1935) was the most successful of Hahn&#x27;s serious operas. It was well received; Büsser wrote:

Other critics noted the Mozartian lightness of the score, and Hahn&#x27;s view of Shakespeare&#x27;s drama as a comedy rather than a tragedy. After the opera had its American premiere, the critic Herbert Kupferberg described it as &quot;charming and dramatic&quot;, and called for a recording. The piece has been revived by the Opéra-Comique (1979) and at the Grand Théâtre Massenet, Saint-Étienne (2015). Hahn left an unfinished opera, &quot;Le Oui des jeunes filles&quot; (The Maidens&#x27; Consent), which Büsser completed; it was given by the Opéra-Comique company in June 1949.

&quot;Ciboulette&quot;, Hahn&#x27;s first venture into opérette, was his most successful and enduring. In a study of opérette, James Harding writes that Hahn&#x27;s score, though in the tradition of earlier composers, specifically Lecocq, &quot;rejuvenates the old technique with a singular brightness of melody and adroit combinations of voice and instrument&quot;. After the initial run in 1923, there were revivals in Paris in 1926, 1931 and 1935, and after Hahn&#x27;s death there were revivals at the Opéra-Comique in 1953, 2013 and 2014. When the work was first given in London, eighty years after the Paris premiere, the critic Michael Kennedy wrote, &quot;I cannot imagine why it is not in the regular international repertoire, for in many respects it is the equal of &quot;Fledermaus&quot; and &quot;The Merry Widow&quot; … there is not a weak number in the piece&quot;. Hahn wrote two more opérettes, which were well received without rivalling the success of &quot;Ciboulette&quot;: &quot;Brummell&quot; (1931) and &quot;Malvina&quot; (1935).

Next to &quot;Ciboulette&quot;, Hahn&#x27;s biggest box-office success was the &quot;comédie musicale&quot; &quot;Mozart&quot;, written with Sacha Guitry. Harding describes the piece as &quot;a slim tracery of eighteenth-century allusion gilded by Sacha&#x27;s unerring wit&quot;. Printemps had a great success in the title role, but the piece was successfully revived later with other stars: 1951 with Jeanne Boitel, 1952 with Graziella Sciutti and 2009 and 2011 with Sophie Haudebourg. Further musical comedies followed: &quot;Le Temps d&#x27;aimer&quot; (1926), &quot;Ô mon bel inconnu&quot; (1933, with Guitry), and &quot;Beaucoup de bruit pour rien&quot; (&quot;Much Ado About Nothing&quot;, 1936), a &quot;comédie musicale shakespearienne&quot;.

===Orchestral and concertante===
Among the best known of Hahn&#x27;s orchestral works is the suite &quot;Le Bal de Béatrice d&#x27;Este&quot; (1905), for a small ensemble of wind instruments, harps, piano and percussion. Evoking a 15th-century Italian court entertainment it displays Hahn&#x27;s abilities as a pasticheur. &quot;Grove&quot; describes it as a divertissement, and a later work by Hahn is specifically so labelled, the &quot;Divertissement pour une fête de nuit&quot;, for wind instruments (including saxophone), piano, string quartet and orchestra (1931).

Hahn wrote two concertos for soloist and conventional orchestral forces. The Violin Concerto (1928) is the larger-scale of the two. The opening movement, marked &quot;Décidé&quot;, is richly scored, moving between strongly rhythmical and lyrical passages. The central movement, &quot;Chant d&#x27;amour&quot;, subtitled &quot;Souvenir de Tunis&quot; evokes the heat and languor of North Africa. In 2002 a &quot;Gramophone&quot; reviewer wrote that it &quot;hovers between dance and delirium&quot;. The finale opens gently, before accelerating into a lively concluding dance. Reviewing the first performance, Paul Bertrand wrote in &quot;Le Ménestrel&quot;, &quot;This Concerto is, in fact, from a purely musical point of view, a miracle of taste, of delicacy, and it is at the same time marvellously suited to highlighting all the qualities of the performer and to earning him the greatest success&quot;. The Piano Concerto (1931) is a lighter-weight piece; the second movement lasts less than three minutes. The concerto is described in &quot;The Penguin Guide to Recorded Classical Music&quot; as &quot;a charming work&quot; with an opening theme that has &quot;an English flavour, easily lyrical&quot; leading to variations &quot;full of sharp, sparkling contrasts … although no deep emotions are touched this is a delightful piece&quot;.

For the theatre, Hahn composed incidental music for more than 20 productions between 1890 and 1939, employing a variety of forces, from mezzo-soprano and children&#x27;s chorus or soloists and two pianos to full orchestra. Playwrights ranged from Daudet and Hugo to Racine, and Miguel Zamacois. In 1934 he wrote scores for a film adaptation of &quot;La Dame aux Camélias&quot; and Léonce Perret&#x27;s &quot;Sapho&quot;. As well as the 1912 Diaghilev ballet &quot;Le Dieu bleu&quot;, he supplied original ballet or other dance scores for five other theatrical productions between 1892 and 1939.

===Chamber and solo piano===

Hahn, whose musical outlook was shaped in the 19th century, regarded Fauré as the last great composer, and musical analysts have noted the older composer&#x27;s influence in several of Hahn&#x27;s chamber works. In the Piano Quintet (written in 1922 and published the following year) there are stylistic and thematic echoes of Fauré, particularly in the C-sharp minor slow movement, although in a 2001 analysis Francis Pott also notes the influence of Dvořák. In the Violin Sonata (1926) there are further echoes of Faure&#x27;s music in the opening movement (&quot;imbued with Gallic restraint and supple expressivity&quot; according to the commentator Jeremy Filsell), but Hahn departs from convention by making much of the last movement gentle and melancholic, rather than boisterous. The Piano Quartet (1946), a late work, is in three movements, and alternates serene passages and more turbulent sections. Like the Violin Sonata, it is a concise work, taking a little over 20 minutes in performance.

Most of Hahn&#x27;s works for solo piano come from the first half of his career. Some are in conventional forms, including a set of ten waltzes (1896), a sonatine (1907), &quot;Thème varié sur le nom de Haydn&quot; (1910) and two études (1927, his only post-war piano works). The sonatine is a full-scale piano sonata but, like Ravel, Hahn was daunted by any possible comparison with Beethoven&#x27;s late piano sonatas, and preferred the more modest title. Other solo piano works are in unusual forms, such as the &quot;Portraits de peintres&quot; (1894), written to be played between spoken verses, or &quot;Le Rossignol éperdu&quot; (The Distraught Nightingale), Hahn&#x27;s most extensive piano work, composed between 1902 and 1910 and published in 1913, consisting of 53 short pieces, grouped into four sections. Hahn wrote five works for piano four hands and four for two-piano duet.

==Recordings==
During the composer&#x27;s lifetime there were many recordings, especially of his most popular mélodies, which, according to Depaulis, almost all the great recital singers enjoyed performing. Hahn made numerous recordings, singing and accompanying himself not only in his own songs, but also numbers by Mozart, Gounod, Chabrier, Massenet, Bizet and Offenbach. In the mid-20th-century, singers who made recordings of numerous Hahn songs included Jacques Jansen and Géori Boué. Since interest in Hahn&#x27;s works revived in the late 20th century recordings of a substantial part of his oeuvre have been released. In 2006 Depaulis listed recordings of Hahn mélodies by, among others, the sopranos Mady Mesplé and Felicity Lott, the mezzo-sopranos Susan Graham, Marie-Nicole Lemieux and Anne-Sofie von Otter, the tenors Martyn Hill and Ian Bostridge and the baritones Didier Henry and Stephen Varcoe. Since then issues have included a 2019 four-disc CD set from the Centre de musique romantique française, &quot;Reynaldo Hahn: Complete Songs&quot;, comprising 107 songs, sung by Tassis Christoyannis, accompanied by Jeff Cohen.

Hahn&#x27;s complete piano music for two players has been recorded by Kun-Woo Paik and Hüseyin Sermet. In the 21st century Earl Wild&#x27;s complete set of &quot;Le Rossignol éperdu&quot; (2001), has been followed by further such sets from Cristina Ariagno (2011), Billy Eidi (2015) and Yoonjung Han (2019). In 2015 a four-disc CD set entitled &quot;Hahn: Intégrale Piano Music&quot;, played by Alessandro Deljavan was released on the Aevea label.

Of Hahn&#x27;s stage works, &quot;Ciboulette&quot; was recorded by EMI in 1983, with a cast headed by Mesplé in the title role, and José van Dam (Duparquet) and Nicolai Gedda (Antonin). The work was recorded again in 2013 at the Opéra-Comique, conducted by Laurence Equilbey; audio and video versions were published. In 2020 Hervé Niquet conducted the first recording of &quot;L&#x27;île du rêve&quot;, released on the Bru Zane label. Yvonne Printemps recorded excerpts from &quot;Mozart&quot; in 1925 with an orchestra conducted by Marcel Cariven; among later recordings of music from the piece, the complete score was recorded by RTF Radio Lyrique in 1959, with a cast headed by Boué, conducted by Pierre-Michel Le Conte. A recording of a 1963 broadcast of &quot;Brummell&quot; conducted by Cariven was released as a CD set in 2018. A recording of a 1971 ORTF broadcast of &quot;Ô mon bel inconnu&quot; was issued on CD, and a new recording starring Véronique Gens was released by Bru Zane in February 2021.

<doc id="787834" wikidata="Q40512" url="?curid=787834" title="Omar Ali Saifuddien III">
<text>Omar Ali Saifuddien Sa&#x27;adul Khairi Waddien (Jawi: ; 23 September 1914 – 7 September 1986) was the 28th Sultan of Brunei, reigning from 1950 until his abdication in 1967 to his oldest son, Hassanal Bolkiah.

Over the course of his 17-year reign, Sultan Omar Ali Saifuddien III significantly altered Brunei. He also created the Melayu Islam Beraja (MIB) philosophy, which is the country&#x27;s guiding ideology. In order to prepare his people for the restoration of the state&#x27;s sovereign rights—which had been started by his predecessor and spurred by the Brunei nationalist movement toward the close of World War II—he also started social and economic reform. He became known as the Architect of Modern Brunei, Royal Poet, Father of Brunei Negara Zikir and Father of Independence.

==Early life and education==
Pengiran Muda Omar Ali Saifuddien was born at Istana Kota, Kampong Sultan Lama, Brunei Town on 23 September 1914. He was the seventh child out of ten of Sultan Muhammad Jamalul Alam II and Raja Isteri Fatimah. Following his birth, Pengiran Sharbanun binti Pengiran Muhammad raised him along with his older sister, Pengiran Anak Puteri Besar. Like the other royal children of Brunei, he received an education centred on Islamic customs, etiquette, and good manners in the palace.

Unbeknownst to those seeking guidance, the household nannies subtly instilled the Bruneian spirit and courtly manners, carefully structured around Islamic principles. This early upbringing explains why Omar Ali Saifuddien&#x27;s behaviour and traits from a young age closely aligned with Islamic teachings. He began learning to read the Quran at the age of ten, under the guidance of carefully selected tutors, and successfully completed his studies, performing forty formal recitations. It was customary for the princes and princesses of the royal family to study under various Quranic scholars to receive their blessings and favour. As Omar Ali entered his teenage years, he continued his religious education, deepening his understanding of Islamic law. The teachings of Abdul Mokti Nasar, one of his most influential mentors, had a profound impact on Omar Ali, shaping his vision for modernising Brunei’s religious institutions and strengthening the role of Islam in governance.

From an early age, Omar Ali was entrusted with elders who imparted knowledge and skills necessary to finish his upbringing, specifically about Islamic rules and the traditions and rituals that the royal family had followed in the past. Regular instructors for him included Pengiran Haji Abdul Rahim bin &quot;Pengiran Maharaja Lela&quot; Pengiran Anak Abdul Kahar, a specialist in Islamic customs and ceremonies and knowledgeable about the faith.

At the palace, he was instructed in English language, religious knowledge, customs, and traditions while he was in the palace. Pengiran Haji Abdul Rahim, Shaykh Haji Abdul Halim, and T. F. Stalley were among his tutors. While he was still receiving training at the palace, he studied &quot;Dikir Brunei&quot; every day after supper until he became an expert in it. It is clear that his four years of formal education would not be considered sufficient to qualify him as a writer of distinction if one considers his education. 

On the recommendation of T. F. Carey, the British Resident, the then 18 years old prince enrolled together with two of his cousins, Pengiran Anak Mohamed Alam and Pengiran Anak Abdul Kahar, at the Malay College Kuala Kangsar (MCKK) in Perak, British Malaya from 1932 to 1936. Additionally, Pengiran Haji Abdul Rahim accompanied him to the college. As a result, he was the first of the Brunei sultans to receive formal education in a foreign institution.

== Early adulthood ==
After just one week of arriving in Brunei Town, he returned from Malaya in 1936 and was invited by Sir Roland Evelyn Turnbull, the British Resident, to Kuala Belait, where he would work as a cadet officer in the Forestry Department, which was then led by Mr. Smith. After spending just one week in Kuala Belait, he together with Awang Abdul Hamid, Awang Maidin, and Awang Ludin relocated to Bukit Puan where they spent three months surveying the forest reserve. He got to know the forestry industry by working with Dusun, Belait, Tutong, and Iban labourers. Subsequently, he received invitations to work in many locations, including Bukit Sawat, Pengkalan Siong, Kuala Melayan, Sukang, Melilas, and Ingai.

In 1937, he was transferred to the Judiciary Department, also became an administrative officer in 1938. He traveled by sailing boat to Lawas in 1939. Some of his friends warned him that sailing a boat and depending only on favorable winds may be hazardous. But he did not follow this advise, continuing to sail the sailing boat toward that goal until it came to shallow seas near the Island of Sari.

He was instructed by Hughes Hallet, the Assistant British Resident in Kuala Belait, to examine the Criminal Procedure Code that was in effect in Brunei at the time. The technique of implementing the law&#x27;s provisions was also deeply entrenched in his mind. Originally, his plan upon returning from Kuala Belait to Brunei Town was to relax, but this was modified to studying certain parts of Islam. Events that took place during the Japanese occupation of Brunei from 1941 until 1945, when he was employed by State Secretary Ibrahim bin Mohammad Jahfar at &quot;Somobucho&quot;. Under his supervision, he was encouraged to study, review, and analyse the Criminal Procedure Code, which he had started to learn at Kuala Belait, as well as the tale of him and the District Officer Ibrahim bin Andor trying a case together.

After the Second World War, in 1947, he was subsequently appointed a member of the State Council and chairman of the Syariah Court. He had the Wazir (Vizier) title &quot;Duli Yang Teramat Mulia Paduka Seri Pengiran Bendahara Seri Maharaja Permaisuara&quot; conferred on him by his brother, Sultan Ahmad Tajuddin on 15 July 1947. Following his appointment as Wazir, he frequently traveled to Brunei&#x27;s interior regions in particular to get insight into the living circumstances and customs of the country&#x27;s population. Following his trip to the interior, he prepared reports that he sent to his brother, the Sultan. He also provided the British Resident with the information so that issues raised in the reports might be addressed. He said that the government always acted with his suggestions, especially when Eric Ernest Falk Pretty was serving as the British Resident.

One early important contribution of Omar Ali Saifuddien was to regularise Islamic administration in Brunei. In 1948, a religious council, comprising the Mohammedan Religious Advisers was formed. Due to his initiative, the council met for the first time on 31 January 1948. He himself was appointed chairman of this council. After examining several laws on Islamic affairs in the Malay Peninsula, the board made new proposals regarding the religious administration in Brunei. The Omar Ali Saifuddien Mosque is a testament to his commitment to advancing and bolstering the Islamic faith in Brunei.

==Reign ==
=== Accession and coronation ===

Upon the sudden death of his brother in Singapore, who left no male heirs, on 4 June 1950, he was proclaimed by &quot;Pengiran Pemancha&quot; Pengiran Anak Haji Muhammad Yasin as the next Sultan at the Hall Government Office on 6 June 1950. Omar Ali Saifuddien embraced his new role and asserted his authority by directing his late brother&#x27;s burial at the Royal Mausoleum upriver, contrary to Tengku Raihani&#x27;s preference.

At 2:30 p.m., British Resident Pretty formally declared him as Sultan Omar Ali Saifuddien III and the 28th sultan of Brunei, with the decision&#x27;s origin remaining unclear between Sarawak&#x27;s Governor Anthony Abell and Brunei&#x27;s Council of State. Later, it was revealed that Pretty had installed Omar Ali Saifuddien as sultan &quot;against significant local opposition.&quot; During a news conference held in Singapore early on 7 June 1950, Gerard MacBryan stated that the intended coronation of Omar Ali Saifuddin would not be possible without the elements of the Brunei royal regalia he had obtained.

Omar Ali Saifuddien was crowned as the &quot;Sultan dan Yang Di-Pertuan&quot; in the Lapau on 31 May 1951. In conjunction of the coronation, he was conferred with the Honorary Companion of the Most Distinguished Order of Saint Michael and Saint George (CMG) by Queen Elizabeth II. He performed the Hajj pilgrimage later in September of the same year.
=== Early reign and educational reforms ===

Upon his ascension to the throne, Omar Ali Saifuddien also became the head of the Islamic religion in the country. Sending locals to study overseas was one of his initiatives to raise the caliber and aptitude of the native student body. Three Malay fifth-graders were transferred to Singapore&#x27;s Al-Juned Arabic School in 1950. As a result, the number went up every year. In 1963, one of the first local students to graduate from Al-Azhar University did so thanks to this scholarship. Three Bruneians graduated from Al-Azhar University under his reign.

When Omar Ali Saifuddien went to the United Kingdom in May 1952, he went for a walk with Pengiran Anak Tua Omar Ali, not knowing where they were going to walk from the Sheldon Park Hotel until they arrived in Croydon, despite the fact that they had just arrived at their destination and were therefore unfamiliar with their new surroundings. He later attended the coronation of Queen Elizabeth II at Westminster Abbey, London on 2 June 1953. On 9 June, he was conferred with the Knight Commander of the Most Distinguished Order of Saint Michael and Saint George (KCMG) by Queen Elizabeth II.

The Bruneian government spent B$10.65 million in total on educational issues. In 1954, this policy on education was first presented. The equipment of educational institutions, including secondary schools, adult education, and vocational training, is to be determined by this policy for Brunei. This plan calls for the development of thirty schools, and starting in November 1953, free meals will be served at each school. The English-language Raja Isteri Girls&#x27; High School in Brunei Town was finished in 1957, but only goes up to Form 3. These children will go to Sultan Omar Ali Saifuddien College to sit for Forms 4 and 5 after completing the Lower Secondary Certificate Examination. Sultan Muhammad Jamalul Alam Secondary School in Brunei Town, Muda Hashim Secondary School in Tutong, and Sultan Hassan Secondary School in Temburong were the secondary schools that were finished in 1966.

The Department of Religious Affairs, which oversees all national administrative concerns pertaining to Brunei&#x27;s Islamic Constitution, was established on 1 July 1954, by the Sultan. Aspects of Islam are included in the plan, including legal issues, educational issues, religious message-related activities, and social administration. Two religious officials from Johor were brought to Brunei on 25 September 1954 in conjunction with that. Haji Ismail bin Omar Abdul Aziz and Haji Othman bin Mohammad Said are those individuals. The Bruneian government started holding an evening religious school in September 1956. Additionally, the government provides scholarships to a limited number of students to pursue further education overseas at Al-Azhar University in Cairo, Egypt; Islamic College in Klang; and Madrasah Aljunied Al-Islamiah in Singapore.

On 11 October 1956, seven religious schools were established in Brunei utilising the premises of both Malay and English schools, based on the officers&#x27; findings and suggestions. Nine religious instructors who were invited from the State of Johor to teach in Brunei were involved in the religious studies program. After Zuhur, the religious schools opened in the afternoon. These religious schools were administered by the Department of Religious Affairs, and their director and administrator were the highest ranking officials in the department.

=== Constitutional journey of Brunei ===
Omar Ali Saifuddien formed a commission to get feedback from locals in various regions, which was the first step towards drafting a written constitution for Brunei. The commission, which had seven appointed members and was called (JKPP) or Tujuh Serangkai, demonstrated his willingness to take into account the opinions of the people in spite of his absolute power. They were tasked with gathering public feedback, creating an extensive report, and offering the Sultan advice on creating district councils, reorganising the State Council, and creating the Constitution.

The Tujuh Serangkai created a report detailing the public&#x27;s support and agreement with the Sultan&#x27;s constitutional goals after touring all four districts of Brunei. Under the direction of the Sultan, Brunei&#x27;s constitution was drafted based on their findings, and on 23 March 1954, the Tujuh Serangkai presented a 50-page Malay report to the Sultan.

The first draft of Brunei&#x27;s constitution, drafted by Sir Anthony Abell and his peers, protected Brunei&#x27;s sovereignty and was in line with the goals of the country&#x27;s Malay constitutional committee. Abell, the Sultan, and his two Wazirs, &quot;Pengiran Bendahara&quot; and &quot;Pengiran Pemancha&quot;, met with British Resident John Orman Gilbert on 16–17 December 1954, in Istana Darul Hana. These negotiations resulted in minor changes that were submitted to the Colonial Office, where they were unanimously accepted. 

District Advisory Councils were formed in each of the four districts in 1955. By mid-1955, Omar Ali Saifuddien&#x27;s demands to secure roles for his Wazirs in the Legislative and Executive Councils complicated the drafting of Brunei&#x27;s constitution and disrupted British plans for parliamentary re-organisation.

In 1956, A. M. Azahari&#x27;s Brunei People&#x27;s Party (PRB) was popular in Brunei because it supported the Sultan&#x27;s status as a constitutional monarch while promoting independence through constitutional means. Colonial authorities supported the goals of the PRB, but they believed that the organisation&#x27;s demands for equal pay, worker welfare, ministerial governance, and public elections were too extreme. The Sultan&#x27;s resistance to British proposals led to a strong opposition, which made him more determined to maintain his local control. As a result, the draft constitution underwent major changes and deletions.

In 1957, Omar Ali Saifuddien sent a team to London to negotiate the constitution with the British Government. The principal subject of the 1957 London Negotiations was the , drafted by Panglima Bukit Gantang in Brunei House in Singapore. Azahari made an effort to communicate with British officials, but the Sultan&#x27;s opposition made the PRB&#x27;s recommendations unconsidered. Consequently, Azahari said that the British were disregarding the aspirations of the populace, which set the stage for the revolution in 1962.
In 1958, the 1957 London discussions were revisited in Brunei. Omar Ali Saifuddien and Sir Anthony Abell met on 27 October in Istana Darul Hana to review the outcomes of the London discussions. The objective was to finalise the key concepts from the previous talks. Later, on 2 November 1958, a special meeting chaired by the Sultan&#x27;s adviser resolved to send a delegation led by the Sultan himself to London for further constitutional negotiations. Dato Panglima Bukit Gantang and Neil Lawson were chosen to accompany the delegation because of their legal expertise and roles as consultants on constitutional matters.
Following the Merdeka Talks, Brunei&#x27;s constitutional problems became the attention of British authorities, who summoned the Sultan to London in early 1959 to finalize the document with the Colonial Secretary. On 14 March, Omar Ali Saifuddien traveled via Singapore with ten members of his team to London for constitutional talks. As a consequence of the discussions, the Brunei Agreement was obtained on 6 April 1959, marking a significant advancement toward the implementation of Brunei&#x27;s constitution. The outcome of the deal that satisfied the main requests of the Brunei Constitutional Committee in 1954, which included the appointment of a Menteri Besar and the adoption of staggered implementation measures beginning on 1 July.
The Menteri Besar (Chief Minister), the State Secretary, the General, the State Finance Officer, and the Religious Advisor are the five administrators chosen under this constitution. Dato Ibrahim bin Mohammad Jahfar was Brunei&#x27;s first Menteri Besar. On 29 September 1959, the constitution of Brunei was signed in Brunei Town. The agreement was signed by the sultan and Sir Robert Scott, the Commissioner-General for Southeast Asia. The British delegation was led by Alan Lennox-Boyd, 1st Viscount Boyd of Merton who was the Secretary of State for the Colonies. The British Government later accepted the draft constitution.

Among the things stated in the constitution were: The Sultan was made the Supreme Head of State. Brunei was responsible for its internal administration. The British Government was now responsible for foreign and defence affairs only. The post of Resident was abolished and replaced by a British High Commissioner. Additionally, the five councils that were set up are: Executive Council, Legislative Council (LegCo), Privy Council, Council Of Succession and the State Religious Council.
=== Economic growth and infrastructure ===
Brunei saw fast growth in its oil industry between 1950 and 1967, with the first oil platform in Brunei was constructed off Seria in 1952. Omar Ali Saifuddien officially opened the B$14 million gas pipeline installation three years later. The Seria oil field produced 114,700 tons of oil per day a year later. Initiated in 1953, the first National Development Plan (RKN) lasted five years. E. R. Bevington served as the National Development Commissioner during the time. He was designated to present Brunei with any new plans. The LegCo allocated $100 million for this project in July 1953. One of the primary goals of this plan is to supply enough water, create bridges, telephones, buildings, and electric power plants for the convenience of Bruneians, and widen highways for communication. 

A deepwater Muara Port was also constructed under the plan. Power requirements were met and studies were made to provide electricity to rural areas. Efforts were made to eradicate malaria, with the help of the World Health Organization, under the plan. Efforts were successful, bringing the down the cases of malaria from 300 cases in 1953 to only 66 cases in 1959. The death rate was also brought down from 20 per thousand in 1947 to 11.3 per thousand in 1953. This has been attributed to public sanitation and improvement of drainage and the provision of piped pure water to the population.

Developments on education were made, as well as a written policy on education in 1952. By 1958, expenditure on education totaled B$4 million. Communications were also improved with new roads built and reconstruction works at Brunei Airport being completed at 1954. A $14 million gas industrial plant was built under the plan. In 1954, survey and exploration works were undertaken by Brunei Shell Petroleum (BSP) on both offshore and onshore fields. By 1956, production reached 114,700 bpd. The BSP was founded in 1957. With 705,000 tons of natural gasoline (gasoline) produced from gas pipeline planting in Seria, the yield of crude oil has reached 39.5 million tons. The Second RKN was launched in 1962. This strategy aims to propel Brunei&#x27;s economic and social development to new heights. One obvious indicator of economic growth is the area that has been turned over to commercial rice farming, which will improve the nation&#x27;s agricultural sector and lessen the need to import rice from overseas. For their own knowledge and as a result of exporting goods outside, people can also learn how to grow coffee, bananas, wheat, peanuts, and other crops. The plan also saw an increase of production of meat and eggs. The fishing industry increased its output by 25% throughout the course of the plan. 

Brunei&#x27;s first state election was held on 30 and 31 August 1962. This was to elect members to sit in the Brunei LegCo. These elected members would then be involved in discussions of governmental policies. Despite this, the Sultan still held absolute power and authority in the government. Among the political parties which contested in the election were PRB, Barisan Nasional Organisation (BNO), and Brunei United Party (BUP). The polling went on for two days, which ended with the PRB winning the election.

A major oil and gas field was discovered in 1963, with this discovery, Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) became important. Developments in the oil and gas sector has continued actively and oil production has steadily increased since then. He had launched the first delivery of a 10-inch oil pipeline from the seabed off the coast of the Seria oil field on 28 October 1964.

=== Merger with Malaysia and the 1962 revolt ===
When Tunku Abdul Rahman, the prime minister of the Federation of Malaya announced his proposal for a merger of Singapore, North Borneo, Sarawak, and Brunei, Omar Ali Saifuddien saw this as an opportunity for Brunei to achieve independence from British influence. He sent a congratulatory telegraph to Tunku Abdul Rahman, showing his support for the merger. For him, Brunei as a small country, still needed a protection of a larger country; the only way to achieve this was by merging with Malaysia and the rest of the states. This view was also shared by Lee Kuan Yew, the then-prime minister of Singapore. The Sultan considered the Federation of Malaya&#x27;s proposals more carefully before making the ultimate decision because it may have an impact on Brunei&#x27;s nationality, the country, and the future of religion. When the Malaysian Solidarity Consultative Committee (MSCC) initially convened in Jesselton in August 1961, Brunei abstained from the proceedings. The MSCC had its second debate in Kuching in December 1961, followed by the third debate in Kuala Lumpur, in January 1962.

The PRB, including its leader who had considerable popular support, Azahari was against the merger. According to them, if Brunei was to join the Federation, Brunei would not have achieve full independence as it was viewed as a transfer of power from Britain to Malaya. On 8 December 1962, the PRB led a rebellion against the government. With British military aid deployed from Singapore, the rebellion was later crushed and the PRB were defeated. Notably, the 2nd Gurkha Rifles was sent to Brunei in 1962, the year the Brunei Revolt started. Omar Ali Saifuddien and his son, Hassanal Bolkiah was saved from his palace by Digby Willoughby and a small group of Gurkha soldiers, earning the Sultan&#x27;s unwavering gratitude.

After the rebellion, the discussion of joining the proposed North Borneo Federation continued. Omar Ali Saifuddien sent a delegation to attend meetings of the Malaysian Solidarity Consolidation Committee (MSCC). The views of the people were sought by the committee, which was chaired by Chief Minister of Brunei Dato Marsal bin Maun. Notably, Omar Ali Saifuddien decided in 1963 to open religious classes for adults. It aims to provide a better understanding for the people about the importance of obeying Allah, the Prophet and the Ruler. This practice, initiated by an emergency meeting of the Religious Affairs Committee on 7 January 1963, aimed to foster and protect loyalty to the Sultan.

In 1963, a meeting was held to discuss the prospect of Brunei joining Malaysia. Still, arguments arose due to differences about taxes. Omar Ali Saifuddien considered the discussion and held off on making a fast decision since he was offended by Tunku Abdul Rahman&#x27;s proposals. Singapore and Brunei were not present when the Malaysia Agreement was signed in London in July 1963. The Federation of Malaysia was established in September 1963, but Brunei chose not to join the federation for its own reasons. Even the initial date for the federation (which was 31 August 1963) was postponed to 16 September, no agreement was reached between the two sides.

First of all, Omar Ali Saifuddien disagrees with the Federal (Central) Government, which only permits Brunei to retain and profit from its oil production for ten years, following which the Federal Government will acquire the oil production proceeds. Furthermore, because the Head of the Association regarded him as holding the lowest status among the Yang Di-Pertuan Agong of Malaysia, he disapproved of the planned rotational structure for the Agong&#x27;s appointment. The proposed five-year term for Omar Ali Saifuddien to serve as Malaysia&#x27;s Yang Di-Pertuan Agong is another point of contention for the people of Brunei.

=== Establishment of Islamic education ===
Omar Ali Saifuddien established a school where students may only learn Arabic, carrying on his tradition of developing Islamic education. On 24 September 1964, he laid the &quot;foundation stone&quot; for the Hassanal Bolkiah Boys&#x27; Arabic Secondary School, which would become the nation&#x27;s first Arabic-language institution. At this occasion, he discussed his goals for the institution:

Omar Ali Saifuddien had just brought a walking stick and the hotel room key with him on a June 1965 vacation to Washington, D.C., so he could stroll about and see the city when he came across an Afro-American who was trying to steal from him. Nevertheless, the attacker left after taking a whack from his walking stick.

The creation of local religious instructors from pupils who finished seven grades was one of the direct results of Omar Ali Saifuddien&#x27;s religious education program. These &quot;trained religious teachers&quot; had to pass a specific exam and attend weekly sessions in order to become &quot;Untrained Teachers.&quot; On 22 May 1966, evening religious training sessions were instituted five days a week for a year in order to improve their abilities and enable them become completely qualified &quot;Trained Religious Teachers.&quot;

Under his seventeen-year rule from 1950 to 1967, Brunei prospered and expanded quickly. He gave the government orders to revitalise the people&#x27;s livelihood through national progress and development programs, which were effectively carried out and improved the welfare of the populace as well as their quality of life. Mosques, suraus (prayer halls), religious halls, government office buildings, and schools were built all across the country to further the spread of the Islamic faith.

==Abdication ==

On 4 October 1967, after 17 years in reign and a protracted illness, Omar Ali Saifuddien declared his voluntary abdication in favour of his 21-year-old oldest son, Crown Prince Hassanal Bolkiah, when his son reached teenage years and had gained some understanding of the affairs of the country&#x27;s administration. The announcement was made during an assembly of Wazirs, Cheterias, Pehin Manteris, including Manteri Pendalaman, which took place in the Balai Pemanjangan Indera Kenchana of the Istana Darul Hana. 

Following the announcement, the Crown Prince went back to Brunei before completing his education at Royal Military Academy Sandhurst to take over his father&#x27;s position as head of state and people. The news was made on Radio Brunei at night by &quot;Pengiran Pemancha&quot; Anak Haji Mohamed Alam, the . Following the declaration of abdication, Pengiran Haji Muhammad Yusuf bin Pengiran Haji Abdul Rahim, the Acting Menteri Besar, issued the following announcement on 5 October, in his capacity as head of Brunei&#x27;s administration:

The 29th Sultan of Brunei, Sultan Hassanal Bolkiah Muiz&#x27;zaddin Wad&#x27;daulah, was formally proclaimed to his throne and crowned the next day, 5 October 1967, at 3:00 p.m. in the Balai Singgahsana of Istana Darul Hana. During the event, state dignitaries like the Wazir, Cheteria, Acting Menteri Besar, and members of the Legislative Council (LegCo) were present. The (4th October Event) is the name given to the historic night that shocked the entire nation. Following his abdication, Omar Ali Saifuddien was accorded the title of (His Highness the Retired Sultan). His spouse, Pengiran Anak Damit, became . He held this title until his death in 1986.

==Later life==
Even after his abdication in 1967, Omar Ali Saifuddien continued to be involved in matters pertaining to the lives of the people, counselling and mentoring his oldest son in the roles of both a politician and a father. 

On 23 November 1971, Omar Ali Saifuddien was there when the 1959 Agreement modification, Brunei–British Friendship Agreement, was signed in Bandar Seri Begawan. He was conferred with the Honorary Grand Commander of the Victorian Order (GCVO) by Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II during her visit to Brunei on 29 February 1972. In 1978, Sultan Hassanal Bolkiah headed a delegation to London with Omar Ali Saifuddien to discuss Brunei&#x27;s independence with the British government. As a consequence, Britain was relieved of its responsibility for overseeing Brunei&#x27;s military and foreign policy with the signing of the Treaty of Friendship and Cooperation on 1 January 1984. 

At the stroke of midnight on 31 December 1983 in a public event held at the Taman Haji Sir Muda Omar &#x27;Ali Saifuddien, Sultan Hassanal Bolkiah officially proclaimed that Brunei Darussalam had achieved its independence and sovereignty after 97 years of British protection. Soon after the reading of the declaration, Omar Ali Saifuddien led masses of people chanting &quot;Allahu Akbar&quot; (God is Great) three times. This was followed by the singing of the national anthem, a 21-gun salute by the Royal Brunei Land Forces and a prayer was read by the State Mufti for God to bless the newly independent nation.

Although he had abdicated for years and Brunei had achieved its independence, he continued to play an important role after his appointed by the Sultan as Minister of Defence in Brunei&#x27;s first cabinet ministers and consequently conferred the rank of Field Marshal in the Royal Brunei Armed Forces. He also welcomed the arrival of Yasser Arafat, the Chairman of Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO) on his official visit to Brunei on 26 July 1984. Additionally, he granted audience from both Commander Thomas Anthony Boam and Commander L. B. Moerdani in 1985.

==Death and funeral ==
On 7 September 1986 at 8:45 p.m., Omar Ali Saifuddien passed away in Istana Darussalam at the age of 71. It was reported that he has been sick for weeks prior to his death. Brunei started 40 days of mourning following the death. The news of his passing was released at 12:25 a.m. on 8 September 1986. The initial announcement of a royal death reached Bruneians through the disruption of regularly scheduled television and radio shows including readings from the Quran. On the same day was the state funeral, where his body was in Istana Nurul Iman&#x27;s Green Room for eight hours.

Hassanal Bolkiah and his brothers brought their father&#x27;s coffin, which was covered in green velvet with Quranic inscriptions, to its resting place. Prayers and heartfelt tributes were presented throughout the day as hundreds of Bruneians and international dignitaries, including President Wee Kim Wee and Brig-Gen Lee Hsien Loong, paid their final respects. While religious leaders prayed nonstop, four guards from the Royal Brunei Police and Armed Forces kept watch over his coffin. The casket was placed beneath crystal chandeliers on a pedestal wrapped with golden drapes and adorned with Quranic calligraphy. 

The casket was carried out of the palace, with President Wee, the Sultan Ahmad Shah of Pahang, Brig-Gen Lee, Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad, and his eldest son positioned behind it. The casket was transported in a hand-drawn carriage to the tomb, where a gun salute was fired, while hundreds of people lined the streets in the pouring rain, and the Hassanal Bolkiah-led funeral procession from Bandar Seri Begawan to the Royal Mausoleum was further clarify with members of the Royal Brunei Armed Forces and bearers of royal regalia. Pallbearers were Prince Mohamed Bolkiah and Prince Jefri Bolkiah.

At the mausoleum, Hassanal Bolkiah and his brothers placed their father&#x27;s body in the grave, along with his wife, father, grandfather, and eldest brother. The State Kadi, Abdul Hamid Bakal, led the funeral rites, with Quranic verses recited. President Wee, the Sultan of Pahang, and the Tunku Ibrahim Ismail joined mourners, and Brig-Gen Lee sat behind them. After a 90-minute service, the Sultan led the sprinkling of holy water on the grave. A prayer service was held that night at the palace, with nightly prayers continuing for the 40-day mourning period. Foreign dignitaries and statesmen that traveled to Brunei to pay their tributes, prayers, and final respects to the late Omar Ali Saifuddien were:
* Iskandar, Yang di-Pertuan Agong VIII and Sultan of Johor
* Tunku Puan Zanariah, Raja Permaisuri Agong VIII and Sultanah of Johor
* Ahmad Shah, Sultan of Pahang
* Tengku Ampuan Afzan, Tengku Ampuan of Pahang

* Lee Hsien Loong, on behalf of Lee Kuan Yew
* Mahathir Mohamad, Prime Minister of Malaysia
* Siti Hasmah Mohamad Ali, Spouse of the prime minister of Malaysia
* L. B. Moerdani, Commander of the Indonesian National Armed Forces

In addition to messages of condolences, several heads of state and governments have given their quotes. Omar Ali Saifuddien holds a &quot;unique position in the history of Brunei and in the hearts of all who knew him in Britain,&quot; according to British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher. Presidents Suharto of Indonesia, Zia Ul Haq of Pakistan, and Corazon Aquino of the Philippines all expressed shock at his passing, describing it as an irreparable loss for Brunei. In addition to his exceptional contributions to his people, President of Bangladesh, Hussain Muhammad Ershad expressed his deep appreciation for him for his vision, foresight, and wise leadership. A number of foreign heads of state have also contributed quotes, the most notable of them being:

Several other heads of state and governments sent condolences, including Sir Geoffrey Howe, Ja&#x27;afar of Negeri Sembilan, Ismail Nasiruddin of Terengganu, Putra of Perlis, Ismail Petra of Kelantan, Abdul Halim of Kedah, Salahuddin of Selangor, Sharafuddin of Selangor, Azlan Shah of Perak, Muhammad Khan Junejo, Qaboos bin Said, Ahmad Zaidi Adruce, Hussain Muhammad Ershad, Hussein of Jordan, Isa bin Salman Al Khalifa, Khalifa bin Hamad Al Thani, Hosni Mubarak, Ronald Reagan, Fahd of Saudi Arabia, Jaber Al-Ahmad Al-Sabah, Birendra of Nepal, Hafez al-Assad, Saad Al-Salim Al-Sabah, Agatha Barbara, Khalifa bin Salman Al Khalifa, Hirohito, Bhumibol Adulyadej, Zaid Rifai, Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan, Richard von Weizsäcker, Helmut Kohl and Chun Doo-hwan.

In a speech delivered on 20 October 1986, live on RTB from Istana Nurul Iman, on the occasion of the Council of Cabinet Ministers of Brunei&#x27;s reorganisation, Sultan Hassanal Bolkiah mourned the death of his father, saying he could never be replaced. He was quoted stating:

==Foreign policy==

=== Limbang dispute ===
Upon his accession to the throne, Omar Ali Saifuddien maintained his predecessor&#x27;s stance that the territories of Labuan and Limbang be returned to Brunei. Although Sarawak and Sabah had been a long time ago separated from Brunei, he advocated for their possible reunification into the Sultanate as well and a recreation of the old territorial extent of British Borneo. The Bruneian administration continued to demand the district&#x27;s restitution from the Malaysian government until 1950. The Limbang dispute resurfaced in 1973 following the escape of Zaini Ahmad of the PRB together with seven other detainees via Limbang. Zaini was granted political asylum in Malaysia and was also permitted to open an office of the PRB. In response, the government of Brunei revived their claim to the Limbang.

In actuality, Omar Ali Saifuddien was able to gather petitions from residents of the Lower Limbang expressing their wish to join Brunei by sailing up the Limbang River in a launch. As a result of the Sarawak government&#x27;s anti-Brunei protests and Brunei&#x27;s recall of all its students enrolled at Malaysian universities, there was a negative impact on relations between the two countries. This advocacy continued even after he abdicated.

==Personal life==
===Family===

Omar Ali Saifuddien wed Dayang Siti Amin binti Awang Hashim upon his return from Kuala Belait to Brunei Town in 1937. The couple later divorced in 1944. He wanted to get married again because the first marriage ended without children in 1944. At Istana Banderung Kayangan on Saturday, 6 September 1941, he married his cousin as his second wife, Pengiran Anak Damit binti &quot;Pengiran Bendahara&quot; Pengiran Anak Abdul Rahman, the great-granddaughter of Sultan Hashim Jalilul Alam Aqamaddin.

Omar Ali Saifuddien had the chance to get a variety of viewpoints from the elders who were knowledgeable about the royal family&#x27;s still-practiced customs and ceremonies during the royal wedding, which was held in accordance with all of the ceremonial customs of the royal family, including the custom of &quot;bertunggu tunang&quot; (waiting for the fiancé). A selection of &quot;Syair Rakis&quot; (Rakis Poetry) written by &quot;Pengiran Shahbandar&quot; Pengiran Muhammad Salleh, &quot;Syair Yang Di-Pertuan&quot; written by &quot;Pehin Siraja Katib&quot; Awang Abdul Razak, a poem written by Pengiran Damit Sikitri bin Pengiran Sariful, &quot;Syair Awang Semaun&quot;, and a couple of &quot;Syair Rajang&quot; whose authors were unknown were read aloud during the customary &quot;Istadat Berjaga-jaga&quot; held every night.

After an earlier meeting with a representative of the Limbang pengirans and Sultan Ahmad Tajuddin in February 1941, MacBryan was able to effectively arrange settlements with both parties, resulting in Omar Ali Saifuddien receiving Straits $2,000 as a wedding present. They had 10 children:
* Sultan Hassanal Bolkiah (born 1946)
* Prince Mohamed Bolkiah (born 1947)
* Princess Masna Bolkiah (born 1948)

* Princess Amal Rakiah Bolkiah (born 1957)
* Princess Amal Nasibah Bolkiah (born 1958)
* Princess Amal Jefriah Bolkiah (born 1964)

=== Personal interests ===
Omar Ali Saifuddien was known for being an Anglophile. He enjoyed playing traditional Bruneian activities as a kid, including &quot;pancak silat&quot;, &quot;main tatak garis&quot;, &quot;kuit&quot;, and &quot;main gasing&quot;. Furthermore, as a means of passing the time, he occasionally assisted his father Sultan Mahammad Jamalul Alam in his carpentry work, a pastime that was uncommon among regular kids at the time. In addition, he enjoyed playing hockey, football, chess, hunting, speedboat racing, squash, badminton, tug of war, and swimming. These were just simply pastimes; he described things that happened when he was playing with his friends. In addition, he enjoyed collecting items that that spark his curiosity such as weapons, walking sticks, &quot;keris&quot;, and firearms. In addition to the quantity of walking sticks he has amassed, he was particularly fascinated by the artistic craftsmanship and ornamental patterns on them.

In his free time, especially following the Isyak prayers, he enjoyed reciting &quot;zikir&quot; songs with &quot;Pehin-Pehin Manteri Ugama&quot; to become proficient with the ones he already knew and to pick up new ones. He also enjoyed paying surprise visits to people he knew at their residences. He never explained the reasons for these abrupt visits, thus it was hard for those there to grasp them. He occasionally used to till the lawn and excavate the area in order to do some gardening. Typically, Pengiran Haji Abdul Rahim, Pengiran Haji Abdul Kadir, and Pengiran Haji Sulaiman were there on his trips to Muara to go net fishing. Apart from that, he was also known for designing the national medals. Additionally, he has written numerous poems that express his majesty&#x27;s desire to struggle for the nation&#x27;s independence are among his well-known works:&quot;&quot;

<doc id="787836" wikidata="Q14717" url="?curid=787836" title="Fstab">
<text>fstab (after &quot;file systems table&quot;) is a system file commonly found in the directory codice_1 on Unix and Unix-like computer systems. In Linux, it is part of the util-linux package. The fstab file typically lists all available disk partitions and other types of file systems and data sources that may not necessarily be disk-based, and indicates how they are to be initialized or otherwise integrated into the larger file system structure.

The fstab file is read by the codice_2 command, which happens automatically at boot time to determine the overall file system structure, and thereafter when a user executes the codice_3 command to modify that structure. It is the duty of the system administrator to properly create and maintain the fstab file.

While fstab is used for basic system configuration, for other uses, it has been superseded by automatic mounting mechanisms.

The file has other names on some versions of Unix; for example, it is found at codice_4 on Solaris systems.

==Modern use==
The fstab file is read by programs that work with disk partitions and other file systems and is not automatically maintained. Instead it is written by the system administrator or sometimes by an operating system installation program. However, some administration tools can automatically build and edit fstab, or act as graphical editors for it.

Modern Linux systems use udev as an automounter to handle the hot swapping of devices (such as MP3 players or digital cameras) instead of relying on fstab. Programs such as pmount allow ordinary users to mount and unmount filesystems without a corresponding fstab entry; traditional Unix has always allowed privileged users (the root user and users in the wheel group) to mount or unmount devices without a corresponding fstab entry.

==Example==
The following is an example of an fstab file on a typical Linux system.
# device-spec mount-point fs-type options dump pass
LABEL=/ / ext4 defaults 1 1
/dev/sda6 none swap defaults 0 0
none /dev/pts devpts gid=5,mode=620 0 0
none /proc proc defaults 0 0
none /dev/shm tmpfs defaults 0 0

# Removable media
/dev/cdrom /mnt/cdrom udf,iso9660 noauto,owner,ro 0 0

# NTFS Windows 7 partition
/dev/sda1 /mnt/Windows ntfs-3g quiet,defaults,locale=en_US.utf8,umask=0,noexec 0 0

# Partition shared by Windows and Linux
/dev/sda7 /mnt/shared vfat umask=000 0 0

# Mounting tmpfs
tmpfs /mnt/tmpfschk tmpfs size=100m 0 0

# Mounting cifs
//cifs_name/store /store/pingu cifs credentials=/root/smbpass.txt 0 0

# Mounting NFS
nfs_name:/store /store nfs rw 0 0
The order of records in fstab is important because fsck(8), mount(8), and umount(8) sequentially iterate through fstab and mount in the order defined.

Blank lines and comment lines beginning with a &quot;#&quot; are ignored.

The space or tab-separated fields within each row must appear in a specific order:
# &quot;device-spec&quot; – The device name, label, UUID, or other means of specifying the partition or data source this entry refers to.
# &quot;mount-point&quot; – Where the contents of the device may be accessed after mounting; for swap partitions or files, this is set to codice_5.
# &quot;fs-type&quot; – The type of file system to be mounted.
# &quot;options&quot; – Options describing various other aspects of the file system, such as whether it is automatically mounted at boot, which users may mount or access it, whether it may be written to or only read from, its size, and so forth; the special option codice_6 refers to a pre-determined set of options depending on the file system type.
# &quot;dump&quot; – A number indicating whether and how often the file system should be backed up by the dump program; a zero indicates the file system will never be automatically backed up.
# &quot;pass&quot; – A number indicating the order in which the fsck program will check the devices for errors at boot time:

Missing values in the last two fields are interpreted as zeros. If necessary, space characters in the first, second, and fourth fields are indicated by .

==Options common to all filesystems==

; codice_7 / codice_8
: With the codice_7 option, the device will be mounted automatically at bootup or when the mount -a command is issued. codice_7 is the default option. For the device not to be mounted automatically, the codice_8 option is used in /etc/fstab. With codice_8, the device can be only mounted explicitly.
; codice_13 / codice_14
: Controls behavior of the interpretation of block special devices on the filesystem.
; codice_15 / codice_16
: codice_15 lets binaries that are on the partition be executed, whereas codice_16 is the opposite. codice_16 might be useful for a partition that contains no binaries, like /var, or contains binaries the user may not want to execute on the system, or that cannot even be executed on the system, as might be the case of a Windows partition.
; codice_20 / codice_21
: Mount the filesystem in either read write or read only mode. Explicitly defining a file system as codice_20 can alleviate some problems in file systems that default to read only, as can be the case with floppies or NTFS partitions.
; codice_23 / codice_24
: How the input and output to the filesystem should be done. codice_23 means it is done synchronously. Looking at the example fstab, this is the option used with the floppy. This means that when, for example, a file is copied to the floppy, the changes are physically written to the floppy at the same time copy command is issued.
; codice_26 / codice_27
: Controls the behavior of the operation of suid, and sgid bits.
; codice_28 / codice_29 / codice_30
: codice_28 permits any user to mount the filesystem. This automatically implies codice_16, codice_27, codice_14 unless explicitly overridden. If codice_30 is specified, only root can mount the filesystem. If codice_29 is specified, every user in group &quot;users&quot; will be able to unmount the volume.
; codice_6
: Use default settings. Default settings are defined per file system at the file system level. For ext3 file systems these can be set with the &quot;tune2fs&quot; command. The normal default for ext3 file systems is equivalent to codice_38. Modern Red Hat based systems set ACL support as default on the root file system but not on user-created ext3 filesystems. Some file systems such as XFS enable ACLs by default. Default file system mount attributes can be overridden in /etc/fstab.
; codice_39 (Linux-specific)
: Permit the owner of device to mount.
; codice_40
: Do not stop system boot if disk mount failed.
; codice_41 / codice_42 / codice_43 / codice_44 (Linux-specific)
:The Unix stat structure records when files are last accessed (&quot;atime&quot;), modified (mtime), and changed (&quot;ctime&quot;). One result is that atime is written every time a file is read, which has been heavily criticized for causing performance degradation and increased wear. However, atime is used by some applications and desired by some users, and thus is configurable as atime &quot;(update on access)&quot;, noatime &quot;(do not update)&quot;, or (in Linux) relatime &quot;(update atime if older than mtime)&quot;. Through Linux 2.6.29, &quot;atime&quot; was the default; as of 2.6.30, &quot;relatime&quot; is the default.

==Filesystem-specific options==
There are many options for the specific filesystems supported by codice_3. Listed below are some of the more commonly used. The full list may be found in the documentation for mount. Note that these are for Linux; traditional Unix-like systems have generally provided similar functionality but with slightly different syntax or forms.

===ext2===
; codice_46
: Sets the fsck checking level.
; codice_47
: Print debugging info on each remount.
; codice_48
: codice_49 is the block which should be used as the super-block for the filesystem.

===FAT-only===
; codice_50
: Policy for allowed filenames. See codice_51.
; codice_52
: Performs DOS &lt;=&gt; UNIX text file conversions automatically. See codice_51.

===FAT, NTFS===
; codice_54
: Linux filesystems have a larger set of allowed characters in filenames. codice_54 restricts the set of allowed characters for the volume to only those acceptable by Windows; though FAT/NTFS are the most common use cases, this feature is not specifically restricted to those filesystem types.
; codice_56, codice_57
: Sets the user identifier (uid), and group identifier (gid) for all files on the filesystem.
; codice_58
: Controls masking of filesystem nodes.

More detailed information about the fstab file can be found in the man page for Linux fstab; for other systems see below.

===NFS===
; codice_59
: codice_60 is a valid IP address.

<doc id="787837" wikidata="Q7752763" url="?curid=787837" title="The Music and Art of Radiohead">
<text>The Music and Art of Radiohead is a collection of academic essays on the band Radiohead edited by Joseph Tate. It was published in May 2005 by Ashgate Publishing in their &quot;Popular and Folk Music Series&quot; (). It&#x27;s one of &quot;only a handful of academic studies&quot; devoted to the band&#x27;s work.

== Content ==
The book contains discussion of Radiohead&#x27;s music by both established and emerging academics in the context of contemporary cultural studies. It explores topics such as their position within a global market economy and their musical influences and &quot;radical sonic explorations&quot;.

==Reception==
&quot;Popular Music&quot; reviewed the work, commenting that although the book had weak notes it was still a &quot;worthwhile venture&quot;. The &quot;ARSC Journal&quot; also wrote a review, noting that Radiohead&#x27;s members &quot;are averse to any sort of intellectualizing of their music&quot; and that &quot;If, in the end, what Radiohead does is &quot;pure escapism,&quot; as drummer Phil Selway deems, then this book deconstructs not only that aesthetic space he claims they create, but also the very means by which the fans who wish to escape are drawn in.&quot;

<text>John Clark Monk(s) (25 February 1760 – 9 December 1827), also known as the Hanging Sailor of Perryman, was a sea captain.

Monks was born in Siston near Bristol, England and died in 1827. He is entombed at Perryman Cemetery, Maryland, USA, along with both his wives (first wife Mary and second wife Sarah Rebecca Lewis).

He apparently left his crew instructions that when he died, his feet were not to touch dry land for any reason. To meet that requirement his body was lowered into an underground vault, where it was suspended from the ceiling with chains. To ensure that the casket didn&#x27;t rot away, it was made of metal, and Monks&#x27; body was soaked in rum.

<doc id="787841" wikidata="Q7441914" url="?curid=787841" title="Seasonal lag">
<text>Seasonal lag is the phenomenon whereby the date of maximum average air temperature at a geographical location on a planet is delayed until some time after the date of maximum daylight (i.e. the summer solstice). This also applies to the minimum temperature being delayed until some time after the date of minimum insolation. Cultural seasons are often aligned with annual temperature cycles, especially in the agrarian context. Peak agricultural growth often depends on both insolation levels and soil/air temperature. Rainfall patterns are also tied to temperature cycles, with warmer air able to hold more water vapor than cold air. 

In most Northern Hemisphere regions, the month of February is usually colder than the month of November despite February having significantly later sunsets and more daylight overall. Conversely, the month of August is usually hotter than the month of May despite August having later sunrises, increasingly earlier sunsets, and less daylight overall. The fall equinox (September 21–22) is typically much warmer than the spring equinox (March 21–22), despite the two receiving identical amounts of sunlight. In all cases, the change in average air temperature lags behind the more consistent change in daylight patternsdelaying the perceived start of the next season for a month or so.

An analogous temperature lag phenomenon occurs in diurnal temperature variation, where maximum daily temperature occurs several hours after noon (maximum insolation), and minimum temperature usually occurs just before dawn – well past midnight. Both effects are manifestations of the general physical phenomenon of thermal inertia.

==On Earth==

Earth&#x27;s seasonal lag is largely caused by the presence of large amounts of water, which has a high latent heat of freezing and of condensation. 

The length of seasonal lag varies between different climates. Extremes range from as little as 15–20 days for polar regions in summer, as well as continental interiors, for example Fairbanks, Alaska, where annual average warmest temperatures occur in early July, and August is notably cooler than June, to 2–3 months in oceanic locales, whether in low latitudes, as in Miami, Florida or higher latitudes as in the Kuril Islands (where at Simushir annual average temperatures peak in late August), and at Cape Sable Island in Nova Scotia, Canada, where (by a slight margin) September is actually the year&#x27;s warmest month on average. In mid-latitude continental climates, it is approximately 20–25 days in winter and 25–35 days in summer. August as the narrowly warmest month can even happen in ultra-maritime areas north of the Arctic Circle, such as Røst or offshore islands like Jan Mayen and Bear Island in Norway. The latter is at 74°N and such high-latitude summer lag is enabled by Gulf Stream moderation tempering seasonal swings to extend the season.

In many locations, seasonal lag is not &quot;seasonally symmetric&quot;; that is, the period between the winter solstice and thermal midwinter (coldest time) is not the same as between the summer solstice and thermal midsummer (hottest time). San Francisco, for example, has an exceptionally long seasonal lag in the summer, with average daily temperatures peaking in September, and October as its second-warmest month, but very little seasonal lag in the winter, with the lowest temperatures in December and January, around and soon after the winter solstice. This is caused by the water in the Bay Area surrounding the city on three sides. Many areas along North America&#x27;s west coast have very small winter lag and are characterized by a much more gradual spring warming and relatively more rapid autumn cooling. In much of East Asia with oceanic influences, including Korea and virtually all of Japan, January is the coldest month, but August is the warmest month. In low and mid latitudes, the &quot;summer&quot; lag is longer, while in polar areas the &quot;winter&quot; lag is longer (coreless winter in interior Antarctica and Greenland).

Due to seasonal lag, in the Northern Hemisphere the autumnal equinox (around September 22) is considerably warmer than the vernal equinox (around March 20) in most regions despite the fact that both days have almost equal amounts of daylight and darkness. However even with seasonal lag the autumnal equinox is cooler than the summer solstice (around June 21) in most regions as well as the vernal equinox being warmer than the winter solstice (around December 21) even in most oceanic areas. Contrary to popular belief, there is no meteorological reason for designating these dates as the first days of their respective seasons.

In eastern Canada the seasonal lag is consistent both in summer and winter, resulting in February and August being the coldest and warmest months, respectively. In Western Europe the lag is lower in spite of the Atlantic coastline, usually around a month, which is also consistent with many inland areas in the North American Midwest. In Japan, Korea and nearby areas (for example, Vladivostok, Russia), seasonal lag is stronger in summer than winter; the coldest month is January, while the warmest month is August, possibly due to enhanced cloud cover and rain during June into July (for example, the &quot;tsuyu&quot; rainy season in Japan or the &quot;jangma&quot; season in Korea over the same period).

==On other planets==

Other planets have different seasonal lags. The gas giants Jupiter, Saturn and Uranus, as well as Saturn&#x27;s moon Titan, all have substantial seasonal lags corresponding to the equivalent of between two and three months in Earth terms. Mars, on the other hand, has negligible seasonal lag of no more than a few days. For the case of Venus no seasonal lag would be detected, because the planet undergoes no seasons due to very efficient heat transport in its massive atmosphere (which would obliterate the season-causing effect of axial tilt, but its axial tilt is very small anyway) and very low orbital eccentricity (almost no changes to its distance from the Sun). This is also the case for Mercury, even for its &quot;anomalistical seasons&quot;, since it has negligible atmosphere and so undergoes almost instantaneous heating and cooling.

<text>In transaction processing, databases, and computer networking, the two-phase commit protocol (2PC, &quot;tupac&quot;) is a type of atomic commitment protocol (ACP). It is a distributed algorithm that coordinates all the processes that participate in a distributed atomic transaction on whether to commit or abort (roll back) the transaction. This protocol (a specialised type of consensus protocol) achieves its goal even in many cases of temporary system failure (involving either process, network node, communication, etc. failures), and is thus widely used.
However, it is not resilient to all possible failure configurations, and in rare cases, manual intervention is needed to remedy an outcome. To accommodate recovery from failure (automatic in most cases) the protocol&#x27;s participants use logging of the protocol&#x27;s states. Log records, which are typically slow to generate but survive failures, are used by the protocol&#x27;s recovery procedures. Many protocol variants exist that primarily differ in logging strategies and recovery mechanisms. Though usually intended to be used infrequently, recovery procedures compose a substantial portion of the protocol, due to many possible failure scenarios to be considered and supported by the protocol.

In a &quot;normal execution&quot; of any single distributed transaction (i.e., when no failure occurs, which is typically the most frequent situation), the protocol consists of two phases:
#The commit-request phase (or voting phase), in which a coordinator process attempts to prepare all the transaction&#x27;s participating processes (named participants, cohorts, or workers) to take the necessary steps for either committing or aborting the transaction and to vote, either &quot;Yes&quot;: commit (if the transaction participant&#x27;s local portion execution has ended properly), or &quot;No&quot;: abort (if a problem has been detected with the local portion), and
#The commit phase, in which, based on voting of the participants, the coordinator decides whether to commit (only if all have voted &quot;Yes&quot;) or abort the transaction (otherwise), and notifies the result to all the participants. The participants then follow with the needed actions (commit or abort) with their local transactional resources (also called recoverable resources; e.g., database data) and their respective portions in the transaction&#x27;s other output (if applicable).

The two-phase commit (2PC) protocol should not be confused with the two-phase locking (2PL) protocol, a concurrency control protocol.

==Assumptions==
The protocol works in the following manner: one node is a designated coordinator, which is the master site, and the rest of the nodes in the network are designated the participants. The protocol assumes that:
# there is stable storage at each node with a write-ahead log, 
# no node crashes forever, 
# the data in the write-ahead log is never lost or corrupted in a crash, and 
# any two nodes can communicate with each other. 

The last assumption is not too restrictive, as network communication can typically be rerouted. The first two assumptions are much stronger; if a node is totally destroyed then data can be lost.

The protocol is initiated by the coordinator after the last step of the transaction has been reached. The participants then respond with an agreement message or an abort message depending on whether the transaction has been processed successfully at the participant.

==Basic algorithm==

===Commit request (or voting) phase===

#The coordinator sends a query to commit message to all participants and waits until it has received a reply from all participants.
#The participants execute the transaction up to the point where they will be asked to commit. They each write an entry to their undo log and an entry to their redo log.
#Each participant replies with an agreement message (participant votes Yes to commit), if the participant&#x27;s actions succeeded, or an abort message (participant votes No to commit), if the participant experiences a failure that will make it impossible to commit.

===Commit (or completion) phase===

====Success====
If the coordinator received an agreement message from all participants during the commit-request phase:
#The coordinator sends a commit message to all the participants.
#Each participant completes the operation, and releases all the locks and resources held during the transaction.
#Each participant sends an acknowledgement to the coordinator.
#The coordinator completes the transaction when all acknowledgements have been received.

====Failure====

If any participant votes No during the commit-request phase (or the coordinator&#x27;s timeout expires):
#The coordinator sends a rollback message to all the participants.
#Each participant undoes the transaction using the undo log, and releases the resources and locks held during the transaction.
#Each participant sends an acknowledgement to the coordinator.
#The coordinator undoes the transaction when all acknowledgements have been received.

====Message flow====

An * next to the record type means that the record is forced to stable storage.

==Disadvantages==
# The greatest disadvantage of the two-phase commit protocol is that it is a blocking protocol. 
# If the coordinator fails permanently, some participants will never resolve their transactions: After a participant has sent an agreement message as a response to the commit-request message from the coordinator, it will block until a commit or rollback is received.
# A two-phase commit protocol cannot dependably recover from a failure of both the coordinator and a cohort member during the commit phase. If only the coordinator had failed, and no cohort members had received a commit message, it could safely be inferred that no commit had happened. If, however, both the coordinator and a cohort member failed, it is possible that the failed cohort member was the first to be notified, and had actually done the commit. Even if a new coordinator is selected, it cannot confidently proceed with the operation until it has received an agreement from all cohort members, and hence must block until all cohort members respond.

==Implementing the two-phase commit protocol==

===Common architecture===
In many cases the 2PC protocol is distributed in a computer network. It is easily distributed by implementing multiple dedicated 2PC components similar to each other, typically named transaction managers (TMs; also referred to as 2PC agents or Transaction Processing Monitors), that carry out the protocol&#x27;s execution for each transaction (e.g., The Open Group&#x27;s X/Open XA). The databases involved with a distributed transaction, the participants, both the coordinator and participants, register to close TMs (typically residing on respective same network nodes as the participants) for terminating that transaction using 2PC. Each distributed transaction has an ad hoc set of TMs, the TMs to which the transaction participants register. A leader, the coordinator TM, exists for each transaction to coordinate 2PC for it, typically the TM of the coordinator database. However, the coordinator role can be transferred to another TM for performance or reliability reasons. Rather than exchanging 2PC messages among themselves, the participants exchange the messages with their respective TMs. The relevant TMs communicate among themselves to execute the 2PC protocol schema above, &quot;representing&quot; the respective participants, for terminating that transaction. With this architecture the protocol is fully distributed (does not need any central processing component or data structure), and scales up with number of network nodes (network size) effectively.

This common architecture is also effective for the distribution of other atomic commitment protocols besides 2PC, since all such protocols use the same voting mechanism and outcome propagation to protocol participants.

===Protocol optimizations===
Database research has been done on ways to get most of the benefits of the two-phase commit protocol while reducing costs by protocol optimizations and protocol operations saving under certain system&#x27;s behavior assumptions.

====Presumed abort and presumed commit====
Presumed abort or Presumed commit are common such optimizations. An assumption about the outcome of transactions, either commit, or abort, can save both messages and logging operations by the participants during the 2PC protocol&#x27;s execution. For example, when presumed abort, if during system recovery from failure no logged evidence for commit of some transaction is found by the recovery procedure, then it assumes that the transaction has been aborted, and acts accordingly. This means that it does not matter if aborts are logged at all, and such logging can be saved under this assumption. Typically a penalty of additional operations is paid during recovery from failure, depending on optimization type. Thus the best variant of optimization, if any, is chosen according to failure and transaction outcome statistics.

====Tree two-phase commit protocol====
The Tree 2PC protocol (also called Nested 2PC, or Recursive 2PC) is a common variant of 2PC in a computer network, which better utilizes the underlying communication infrastructure. The participants in a distributed transaction are typically invoked in an order which defines a tree structure, the invocation tree, where the participants are the nodes and the edges are the invocations (communication links). The same tree is commonly utilized to complete the transaction by a 2PC protocol, but also another communication tree can be utilized for this, in principle. In a tree 2PC the coordinator is considered the root (&quot;top&quot;) of a communication tree (inverted tree), while the participants are the other nodes. The coordinator can be the node that originated the transaction (invoked recursively (transitively) the other participants), but also another node in the same tree can take the coordinator role instead. 2PC messages from the coordinator are propagated &quot;down&quot; the tree, while messages to the coordinator are &quot;collected&quot; by a participant from all the participants below it, before it sends the appropriate message &quot;up&quot; the tree (except an abort message, which is propagated &quot;up&quot; immediately upon receiving it or if the current participant initiates the abort).

The Dynamic two-phase commit (Dynamic two-phase commitment, D2PC) protocol is a variant of Tree 2PC with no predetermined coordinator. It subsumes several optimizations that have been proposed earlier. Agreement messages (Yes votes) start to propagate from all the leaves, each leaf when completing its tasks on behalf of the transaction (becoming ready). An intermediate (non leaf) node sends ready when an agreement message to the last (single) neighboring node from which agreement message has not yet been received. The coordinator is determined dynamically by racing agreement messages over the transaction tree, at the place where they collide. They collide either at a transaction tree node, to be the coordinator, or on a tree edge. In the latter case one of the two edge&#x27;s nodes is elected as a coordinator (any node). D2PC is time optimal (among all the instances of a specific transaction tree, and any specific Tree 2PC protocol implementation; all instances have the same tree; each instance has a different node as coordinator): By choosing an optimal coordinator D2PC commits both the coordinator and each participant in minimum possible time, allowing the earliest possible release of locked resources in each transaction participant (tree node).

<doc id="787853" wikidata="Q751120" url="?curid=787853" title="Roth's theorem">
<text>In mathematics, Roth&#x27;s theorem or Thue–Siegel–Roth theorem is a fundamental result in diophantine approximation to algebraic numbers. It is of a qualitative type, stating that algebraic numbers cannot have many rational approximations that are &#x27;very good&#x27;. Over half a century, the meaning of &quot;very good&quot; here was refined by a number of mathematicians, starting with Joseph Liouville in 1844 and continuing with work of , , , and .

== Statement ==

Roth&#x27;s theorem states that every irrational algebraic number formula_1 has approximation exponent equal to 2. This means that, for every formula_2, the inequality

:formula_3

can have only finitely many solutions in coprime integers formula_4 and formula_5. Roth&#x27;s proof of this fact resolved a conjecture by Siegel. It follows that every irrational algebraic number α satisfies

:formula_6

with formula_7 a positive number depending only on formula_2 and formula_1.

==Discussion==

The first result in this direction is Liouville&#x27;s theorem on approximation of algebraic numbers, which gives an approximation exponent of &quot;d&quot; for an algebraic number α of degree &quot;d&quot; ≥ 2. This is already enough to demonstrate the existence of transcendental numbers. Thue realised that an exponent less than &quot;d&quot; would have applications to the solution of Diophantine equations and in Thue&#x27;s theorem from 1909 established an exponent formula_10 which he applied to prove the finiteness of the solutions of Thue equation. Siegel&#x27;s theorem improves this to an exponent about 2, and Dyson&#x27;s theorem of 1947 has exponent about .

Roth&#x27;s result with exponent 2 is in some sense the best possible, because this statement would fail on setting formula_11: by Dirichlet&#x27;s theorem on diophantine approximation there are infinitely many solutions in this case. However, there is a stronger conjecture of Serge Lang that

:formula_12

can have only finitely many solutions in integers &quot;p&quot; and &quot;q&quot;. If one lets α run over the whole of the set of real numbers, not just the algebraic reals, then both Roth&#x27;s conclusion and Lang&#x27;s hold
for almost all formula_1. So both the theorem and the conjecture assert that a certain countable set misses a certain set of measure zero.

The theorem is not currently effective: that is, there is no bound known on the possible values of &quot;p&quot;,&quot;q&quot; given formula_1. showed that Roth&#x27;s techniques could be used to give an effective bound for the number of &quot;p&quot;/&quot;q&quot; satisfying the inequality, using a &quot;gap&quot; principle. The fact that we do not actually know &quot;C&quot;(ε) means that the project of solving the equation, or bounding the size of the solutions, is out of reach.

== Proof technique ==

The proof technique involves constructing an auxiliary multivariate polynomial in an arbitrarily large number of variables depending upon formula_15, leading to a contradiction in the presence of too many good approximations. More specifically, one finds a certain number of rational approximations to the irrational algebraic number in question, and then applies the function over each of these simultaneously (i.e. each of these rational numbers serve as the input to a unique variable in the expression defining our function). By its nature, it was ineffective (see effective results in number theory); this is of particular interest since a major application of this type of result is to bound the number of solutions of some Diophantine equations.

== Generalizations ==

There is a higher-dimensional version, Schmidt&#x27;s subspace theorem, of the basic result. There are also numerous extensions, for example using the &quot;p&quot;-adic metric, based on the Roth method.

William J. LeVeque generalized the result by showing that a similar bound holds when the approximating numbers are taken from a fixed algebraic number field. Define the &quot;height&quot; &quot;H&quot;(ξ) of an algebraic number ξ to be the maximum of the absolute values of the coefficients of its minimal polynomial. Fix κ&gt;2. For a given algebraic number α and algebraic number field &quot;K&quot;, the equation

:formula_16

has only finitely many solutions in elements ξ of &quot;K&quot;.

<text>The Union of the Centre (, UdC), whose complete name is &quot;Union of Christian and Centre Democrats&quot; (&quot;Unione dei Democratici Cristiani e Democratici di Centro&quot;, UDC), is a Christian-democratic political party in Italy.

Lorenzo Cesa is the party&#x27;s current secretary, while Antonio De Poli its president. For years, Pier Ferdinando Casini was the most recognisable figure and &quot;de facto&quot; leader of the party, before eventually distancing from it in 2016. The UdC is a member of the European People&#x27;s Party (EPP) and the Centrist Democrat International (CDI), of which Casini was president from 2004 to 2015.

The party was formed as &quot;Union of Christian and Centre Democrats&quot; in December 2002 upon the merger of the Christian Democratic Centre (CCD), the United Christian Democrats (CDU) and European Democracy (DE). In 2008 the party was the driving force behind the &quot;Union of the Centre&quot; (UdC), an alliance comprising, among others, The Rose for Italy of Bruno Tabacci and Savino Pezzotta, the Populars of Ciriaco De Mita and the Liberal Clubs of Ferdinando Adornato. Since then, the party&#x27;s official name was neglected in favour of the alliance&#x27;s and, since most of the UdC member parties have joined the UDC too, the UDC and the UdC started to overlap almost completely to the point that they are now indistinguishable.

The CCD was an early ally of Silvio Berlusconi&#x27;s Forza Italia in 1994 and was part of the centre-right Pole/House of Freedoms since its establishment. Consequently, the UDC was consistently part of the centre-right until 2006. Later, it was affiliated neither to the centre-right nor the centre-left at the national level. Despite this, the party continued to take part in several regional, provincial and municipal governments with the old and the new Forza Italia, while forming alliances also with the centre-left Democratic Party in some regions and cities. In the 2013 general election the UdC was part of With Monti for Italy, the coalition formed around Mario Monti&#x27;s Civic Choice, and obtained a mere 1.8% of the vote, down from 5.6% in 2008 and 6.8% in 2006. In December 2014 the party, which sat in Enrico Letta&#x27;s government and Matteo Renzi&#x27;s government (2013–2016), formed Popular Area with Angelino Alfano&#x27;s New Centre-Right. In December 2016 the UdC left the alliance, did not join Paolo Gentiloni&#x27;s government and suffered the final split by Casini and his followers. The party has since returned into the centre-right coalition&#x27;s fold and took part to the 2018 and 2022 general elections within centrist joint lists. More recently, the UdC distanced from Forza Italia and formed an alliance with Lega.

==History==

===Background===

In the 2001 Italian general election, the Christian Democratic Centre (CCD), led by Pier Ferdinando Casini, and the United Christian Democrats (CDU), a 1995 split from the Italian People&#x27;s Party (PPI) led by Rocco Buttiglione were part of the winning centre-right House of Freedoms coalition, but their joint list (informally known as White Flower) won a mere 3.2% of the vote (−2.6pp from 1996). In the event, the two parties suffered the competition of European Democracy (DE), led by Sergio D&#x27;Antoni and formed largely by further splinters from the PPI, which obtained 2.4% of the vote.

After the election, Casini was elected President of the Chamber of Deputies and was replaced by Marco Follini as secretary of the CCD. Soon after, Silvio Berlusconi appointed Carlo Giovanardi (CCD) and Buttiglione (CDU) as ministers in his second government.

A few months later, the CCD and the CDU jointly scored 19.7% of the vote in a regional election (+0.7pp from the previous regional election) in Sicily, which was a stronghold for both parties, and Salvatore Cuffaro (CDU) was elected President of Sicily with a landslide 59.1% of the vote. DE won 4.5% of the vote and D&#x27;Antoni was elected to the Sicilian Regional Assembly.

===Foundation and early years===
On 6 December 2002, the CCD, the CDU and DE were merged into the &quot;Union of Christian and Centre Democrats&quot; (UDC). During the party&#x27;s first congress, Follini was elected secretary, D&#x27;Antoni deputy secretary and Buttiglione president.

At the 2004 European Parliament election, the UDC won 5.9% of the vote and five MEPs. Consequently, the party successfully lobbied for Follini&#x27;s appointment as Deputy Prime Minister in Berlusconi&#x27;s government with the goal of strengthening and balancing the coalition, while diminishing the influence of Lega Nord.

At the 2005 regional elections, the UDC and the House of Freedoms faced a severe defeat by winning only two regions out of 14. Follini asked Berlusconi to resign and form a new government. In the new executive, Buttiglione became minister of Culture, while Follini stepped down from his previous post to concentrate on the party. On 15 October 2005 Follini suddenly resigned from his position as party secretary and was replaced on 27 October by Lorenzo Cesa, an ally of Casini.

The party took part to the 2006 general election with a new logo, characterised by the inclusion of the name of Casini, who also headed party electoral lists in most constituencies. Despite the defeat of the House of Freedoms, the UDC improved its electoral performance by gaining 6.8% of the vote. In the following Sicilian regional election Cuffaro was re-elected President, but the UDC&#x27;s share of the vote was reduced to 13.0%, due to two factors: the presence of president&#x27;s list named after Cuffaro (which obtained 5.7% and elected mostly UdC members) and the strong showing of the Movement for Autonomy (MpA) (12.5%).

===Transition and splits===
In October 2006, Follini, a harsh critic of Berlusconi, finally left the party to form a new grouping, called Middle Italy, which was eventually merged into the centre-left Democratic Party (PD) upon its foundation in October 2007. This was the fourth split suffered by the UDC in two years after three much bigger splits: the first led by Sergio D&#x27;Antoni, who joined The Daisy in 2004; the second by Gianfranco Rotondi, who launched the Christian Democracy for Autonomies (DCA) in 2005; the third by Raffaele Lombardo, who formed the Sicilian-based MpA later that year.

After the departure of Follini, however, Casini became highly critical of Berlusconi too and further distanced the UDC from him. A fifth major split happened at the end of January 2008 when Bruno Tabacci and Mario Baccini left the party because Casini seemed eager to re-join Berlusconi for the upcoming election, after that the Prodi II Cabinet had not passed through a vote of confidence. Shortly afterwards, when Casini refused to merge his party into Berlusconi&#x27;s then-new political movement, The People of Freedom (PdL), the UDC was joined by The Rose for Italy of Tabacci, Baccini and Savino Pezzotta, as well as by two leading members of Forza Italia (FI), Ferdinando Adornato and Angelo Sanza. On the other side, the UDC was left by those who wanted to continue the alliance with Berlusconi: Giovanardi and his faction (the Liberal Populars) joined the PdL, citing that the 72% of UDC voters wanted the party to do so. They were soon followed by many others.

===Union of the Centre===
On 28 February 2008, the UDC announced that it would contest the 2008 general election under the banner of the &quot;Union of the Centre&quot; (UdC), in alliance with The Rose for Italy and other smaller groups, notably including the Populars around Ciriaco De Mita, former leader of Christian Democracy (DC), the Liberal Clubs, the Christian Democratic Party, Veneto for the EPP, the Democratic Populars and the Autonomist Democrats. Despite having lost many votes to the PdL, the UDC was able to woo some new voters from the centre-left and gained 5.6% of the vote, 36 deputies (all UDC members but four) and three senators. Soon after the election, Baccini, one of the leaders of The Rose, surprisingly left the UdC to join the PdL.

After the election, Casini relaunched his plan for a new &quot;centrist&quot; party, as an alternative to both the PdL and the PD. This is what he called the &quot;party of the nation&quot;, open to &quot;centrists&quot;, &quot;Christian democrats&quot;, &quot;liberals&quot; and &quot;reformers&quot;, even though he presented it as a party based on Christian values, as opposed both to the PD and the PdL, which, despite being a centre-right party, also included social-liberal factions. Casini long criticised the PdL for not being &quot;Catholic&quot; enough, particularly criticising Berlusconi, who once spoke of &quot;anarchy of values&quot; in describing the catch-all nature of the PdL, and Gianfranco Fini, who was known for his social-liberal stance on stem-cell research, abortion and right-to-die issues, and explicitly wooed the &quot;Christian democrats of the PD&quot; to join him.

In the 2009 European Parliament election, the UdC won 6.5% of the vote and five of its candidates were elected to the European Parliament, including De Mita and Magdi Allam. In the 2010 regional elections, the UdC chose to form alliances both with the centre-right and the centre-left (or stood alone) in different regions, depending on local conditions, losing ground everywhere but in those southern regions where it was in alliance with the centre-right.

===Centre-left coalitions===
In December 2010, the UdC was a founding member of the New Pole for Italy (NPI), along with Future and Freedom (FLI) and the Alliance for Italy. The NPI alliance was short-lived and the three parties, which were supporters of Mario Monti&#x27;s technocratic government in 2011–2013, parted ways. In 2012 the UdC suffered the split of another Sicilian-based group, Cantiere Popolare (CP), which would be a strong competitor for the party in Sicily, along with the evergreen MpA.

The UdC contested the 2013 general election as part of the With Monti for Italy coalition, alongside FLI and Monti&#x27;s Civic Choice (SC). The election was a huge defeat for the UdC, which obtained a mere 1.8% of the vote, eight deputies and two senators. After the election, the party joined Enrico Letta&#x27;s government with Gianpiero D&#x27;Alia as minister of Public Administration (2013–2014) and Matteo Renzi&#x27;s government with Gianluca Galletti as minister of the Environment (2014–2016).

In February 2014, during the party&#x27;s fourth congress, Cesa was narrowly re-elected secretary over D&#x27;Alia, who was then elected president.

The UdC ran in the 2014 European Parliament election on a joint list with the New Centre-Right (NCD), a mainly Christian-democratic outfit emerged from a split from the PdL in its final days. The list obtained 4.4% of the vote and three MEPs, two for the NCD and one for the UdC.

In December 2014, the alliance with the NCD was strengthened with the formation of the Popular Area (AP) joint parliamentary groups.

===Re-foundation===

In 2016, Casini did not renew his membership to the party, which was thus deprived of its most recognisable leader. Additionally, while still being part of the government and AP, the UdC chose not to support the &quot;yes&quot; in the 2016 constitutional referendum and to distance from the NCD, rejecting any notion of a joint party. In the run-up of the referendum the party was also abandoned by president D&#x27;Alia. After the referendum, which saw a huge defeat of the &quot;yes&quot; side, the UdC left AP altogether, but, other than Casini and D&#x27;Alia, the party lost another deputy and, more important, minister Galletti. Antonio De Poli replaced D&#x27;Alia as president.

In 2017, the UdC was joined by three senators from other parties. The party&#x27;s new course was marked also by the return of Follini. For the 2017 Sicilian regional election, the UdC re-joined the centre-right at the regional level. The decision led some leading former UdC members in Sicily to return into the party&#x27;s fold, but was criticised by the party&#x27;s deputy secretary Giuseppe De Mita, his uncle Ciriaco and Follini, who would jointly launch Italy Is Popular, lead it into the Popular Civic List and join the centre-left coalition.

In the run-up of the 2018 general election, the UdC officially re-joined the centre-right coalition also at the national level, aiming at teaming up with other Christian-democratic parties, notably including the Union of Democrats for Europe (UDEUR), as well as the Italian Liberal Party (PLI) and Energies for Italy (EpI). Thus, the UdC joined Us with Italy (NcI), a pro-Berlusconi centrist electoral list formed by AP splinters (two groups, a Christian-democratic one led by Maurizio Lupi and a liberal one led by Enrico Costa), Direction Italy (DI), Civic Choice (SC), Act!, CP and the MpA, with the goal of reaching 3%, required to win seats from proportional lists under a new electoral law. NcI was later joined also by IdeA, UdC&#x27;s partner in the Chamber of Deputies. In the election, the NcI obtained a mere 1.3% of the vote and the UdC had three senators elected from single-seat constituencies: De Poli, Paola Binetti and Antonio Saccone. Soon after the election, the party quit NcI and formed a pact with FI.

In the run-up of the 2022 general election, the UdC first formed a joint list with Coraggio Italia (CI), then it was a founding member of Us Moderates (NM), a broader joint list within the centre-right coalition, along with CI, NcI and Italy in the Centre (IaC).

In the run-up of the 2024 European Parliament election, the UdC joined forces with Lega.

==Ideology==
Although it is the most vocal supporter of social conservatism in Italy (opposition to abortion, euthanasia, same-sex marriage, LGBT adoption and legality of cannabis are some of its main concerns) and can be easily connected with the Christian right, the UdC is usually identified with the political centre in Italy, thanks to its roots in the Christian Democracy (DC).

However, &quot;The Economist&quot; once described it as a right-wing, sometimes reactionary party, which &quot;stretches a long way from the centre&quot;. Moreover, it wrote that many UDC members are &quot;diehard corporatists who [...] get most of their votes from the south, where many households depend either on welfare or on public-sector employment&quot;. Indeed, the party is stronger in the South and especially in Sicily, where public-sector employment is widely spread.

The UDC was an independent-minded and often reluctant member of the House of Freedoms coalition from 2002 to 2008. The party&#x27;s leading figure, Pier Ferdinando Casini, was critical of Silvio Berlusconi&#x27;s leadership over the Italian centre-right and presented himself as a moderate alternative to populism, which, in his view, denoted the alliance between The People of Freedom (PdL) and Lega Nord. UDC&#x27;s main goal, similarly to that of the Democratic Movement in France, has been to form governments beyond the left-right divide (e.g.: Monti Cabinet and Letta Cabinet) and, possibly, reassembling the remnants of the old DC and control Italian politics from the centre. In this respect, Casini and his followers have long tried to form the nucleus of a third force in Italian politics (e.g.: New Pole for Italy, With Monti for Italy, Popular Area).

This &quot;centrist option&quot; has not succeeded yet: the UdC has remained a much lighter force compared to Berlusconi&#x27;s parties (Forza Italia, the PdL and finally the new Forza Italia), which have drawn most former DC voters, and Italians like confrontational politics based on alternative coalitions and many would support a two-party system, in place of the typically Italian fragmented political spectrum. Finally, several political scientists think that the return of DC is all but likely as the &quot;political unity of Catholics&quot; (the core idea on which DC was based) is not repeatable and it would be anti-historical to try uniting all strains of political Catholicism in a single party.

Moreover, although UdC members are keen on presenting themselves as moderates, their solid social conservatism has harmed their prospects, while FI/PdL/FI has been popular also among secularised middle-class voters. Knowing that, Casini tried to open his party, through the UdC, also to non-Christian-democratic &quot;centrists&quot;, &quot;liberals&quot; and &quot;reformers&quot;, while wooing former DC members affiliated with other parties, especially the PdL and the centre-left Democratic Party (PD). After Casini&#x27;s exit from the party in 2016, the UdC is likely to return to its traditional Christian-democratic roots, as declared by Cesa in a speech to the party&#x27;s national council.

On specific issues, it is relevant to state that the UdC is one of the main supporters of nuclear energy in the Italian political arena.

==Factions==

At the 2007 national congress, there were basically four factions within the party.
*Casiniani. Led by Pier Ferdinando Casini, Lorenzo Cesa and Rocco Buttiglione, the faction included also Mario Tassone (co-leader with Buttiglione of a sub-group composed of former members of the United Christian Democrats (CDU), which controlled more than 15% of party delegates), Michele Vietti, Luca Volontè, Francesco D&#x27;Onofrio, Maurizio Ronconi, Francesco Bosi and Antonio De Poli, and gained the support of at least 45% of party members.
*Tabaccini. This group, which had the support of the 30% of party members, was basically the left-wing of the party, including leading politicians such as Bruno Tabacci, Mario Baccini and Armando Dionisi, who were formerly close allies of Marco Follini. They proposed to start a co-operation with the Democratic Party (PD) or the formation of a centrist party open to figures like Luca Cordero di Montezemolo and Mario Monti.
*Cuffariani. This third group consisted in the southern faction of Salvatore Cuffaro, former President of Sicily and was somewhat critical of the centralist-styled leadership of the party. This group, which included Calogero Mannino, Francesco Saverio Romano, Giuseppe Naro and Giuseppe Drago, held the 10% of the party delegates and supported the Casini-Cesa line, although its members had been often friendlier to Berlusconi. In September 2010 most &quot;Cuffariani&quot;, led by Romano, left the UDC to form The Populars of Italy Tomorrow (PID) and support the Berlusconi IV Cabinet.
*Giovanardiani. It was the group led by Carlo Giovanardi and Emerenzio Barbieri, who wanted closer ties with Forza Italia and the other parties of the House of Freedoms coalition, including Lega Nord. At the congress, the bid of Giovanardi for the leadership was supported by 13.8% of delegates. Before leaving the UDC in February 2008 to join the PdL, Giovanardi and Barbieri organised their faction as Liberal Populars.

The three main schisms suffered by the party between 2004 and 2006, Middle Italy (IdM), Movement for Autonomy (MpA) and Christian Democracy for Autonomies (DCA), were led by the most vocal supporters of each of the last three factions mentioned above, respectively Marco Follini, Raffaele Lombardo and Gianfranco Rotondi. By 2010 virtually all &quot;Giovanardiani&quot; and &quot;Cuffariani&quot; had left the party through the Liberal Populars and the PID.

==Popular support==
The UDC/UdC has been historically stronger in the South and in regional elections.

The electoral results of the UDC/UdC in the 10 most populated regions of Italy are shown in the table below.

The score for the 2006 Sicilian regional election refers to the combined result of the UDC (13.0) and of &quot;L&#x27;Aquilone–Lista del Presidente&quot; (5.7%), the personal list of Salvatore Cuffaro, UDC regional leader and President of Sicily. The elected members of this list were mostly UDC members.

<text>Aodhagán Ó Rathaille or Egan O&#x27;Rahilly (c.1670–1726), was an Irish language poet. He is credited with creating the first fully developed Aisling.

==Early life==
It is thought that Ó Rathaille was born in Screathan an Mhil (Scrahanaveal), Gneeveguilla, in the Sliabh Luachra region of County Kerry, into a relatively prosperous family. Patrick S. Dinneen tells us that &quot;his father died while he was still young, leaving his widow in good circumstances. She owned at one time half the townland of Scrahanaveal, which, however, under the stress of circumstances, she relinquished, and came to dwell at Cnoc an Chorrfhiaidh, also called Stagmount... Here Egan lived a long time.&quot; It may also have been here that Ó Rathaille was trained in the bardic arts. He acquired an excellent education in the bardic school of the MacEgan family (ollamhs to the Mac Cárthaigh Mór) and was taught Latin and English as well as Irish literature and history. He became a respected ollamh and travelled to the homes of the Old Irish chiefs where he was treated as an honoured guest. He also worked as a scribe.

==Later life==
Ó Rathaille lived through a time of major political and social upheaval in Ireland which was ultimately to result in the crushing of the Irish language and the death of the bardic tradition. The changes in Irish society directly impacted Ó Rathaille&#x27;s life and resulted in his social status being reduced from that of a respected ollamh to a destitute pauper. This transition was a source of huge bitterness to Aodhagán and it was this pathos that drove him to pen much of his poetry.

Aodhagán Ó Rathaille was related to the brehons to the Mac Cárthaigh Mór family (and would have seen them as his chiefs and patrons). Due to the Munster plantation, however, the Browne family (later known as Kenmare) had succeeded to the MacCarthy lands under English occupation. Unlike most of the English settlers, the Brownes soon reverted to their Catholic faith, and made matches with the leading Catholic families in Munster and Leinster—Ó Suilleabháin Mór (O&#x27;Sullivan Mor), Fitzgerald of Desmond, MacCarthys, Butlers, O&#x27;Briens, Plunketts and many others.

Sir Valentine Browne, 3rd Baronet, 1st Viscount (1638–1694) was a supporter of James II, King of England and was given the title Viscount Kenmare in the Jacobite peerage. He was the landlord and patron of Aodhagán Ó Rathaille. However, after the Treaty of Limerick in 1691, Valentine Browne was attainted for his loyalty to the House of Stuart and his property was declared forfeit to King William in 1691. His son Nicholas Browne, 4th Baronet, 2nd Viscount was also a Jacobite supporter and attainted and could not claim the estates. Nicholas Browne&#x27;s children were still to inherit, so the commissioners of the estate were instructed not to let the estate out for more than 21 years. However, it was let to John Blennerhasset and George Rogers (two members of parliament) for a contract of 61 years. Blennerhasset and Rogers claimed they planned to plant the estate with Protestants when their illegal contract was questioned by the English Commission in 1699.

The contract was quashed, and in 1703 the estate was sold to John Asgill, who had married a daughter of Nicholas Browne. Under his management, two ruthless and greed-driven men, Timothy Cronin and Murtagh Griffin, collected the hearth money tax from tenants and felled the woods for quick profit. Aodhagán composed a vitriolic mock-eulogy upon the death of Griffin, and another in &quot;honour&quot; of Cronin. It is likely that as a consequence of the loss of the estate by the Brownes, Ó Rathaille had to leave his native district and lived in poverty close by Tonn Tóime, at the edge of Castlemaine Harbour, some 12 miles west of Killarney.

On the death of Nicholas Browne in 1720, the Kenmare estates were again placed under the ownership of a Browne – Nicholas&#x27; son Valentine (5th Baronent, 3rd Viscount). Having been destitute for so long (even composing a poem on his gratitude at receiving the gift of a pair of shoes) Ó Rathaille clearly hoped for a restoration of his position as ollamh, and celebrated Valentine&#x27;s marriage to Honora Butler in 1720 in an Epithalamium.

However, society had changed vastly in the intervening time; also, the estates had suffered under the mismanagement of John Asgill and were taking a severely reduced income. Valentine Browne either could not or would not restore Ó Rathaille&#x27;s position. It seems that the refusal of this request was sufficiently devastating for Ó Rathaille to compose the poem in which he launches a vitriolic attack on the new English gentry like Valentine Browne and makes reference to the failure of the Jacobites as being a primary cause for his own situation.

Little historical biographical reference has been found concerning Ó Rathaille&#x27;s personal circumstances during his life, and the above details are mostly based on a literal interpretation of his surviving poems. Breandán Ó Buachalla warns against putting too much stock in literal interpretation of the poems, especially regarding his final poem, written on his deathbed.

==Legacy==
Aodhagán Ó Rathaille is credited with creating the first fully developed Aisling poem (a type of coded poem where Ireland is portrayed as a beautiful woman who bewails the current state of affairs and predicts an imminent revival of fortune, usually linked to the return of a Stuart King to the English throne). This style of poetry became a standard in Ireland, where it was dangerous to speak overtly of politics, but a poem disguised as a love song could reveal the singer&#x27;s and listeners&#x27; true feelings. His best-known and most popular poem is the great aisling &quot;Gile na Gile&quot; (&quot;Brightness Most Bright&quot;), which has been called one of the miracles of Irish literature.

Dinneen&#x27;s work on Ó Rathaille, published in 1900, was the first published scholarly edition of the complete works of any of the Irish poets.
In 1924, Daniel Corkery devoted a chapter of his groundbreaking book &quot;The Hidden Ireland&quot; to Ó Rathaille.

The final poem composed by Ó Rathaille on his deathbed is one of the finest of Irish literature and the ultimate expression of the rage and loss that Ó Rathaille had been presenting in poetry during most of his life. William Butler Yeats later made reference to this work in his poem &quot;The Curse of Cromwell&quot;. Ó Rathaille&#x27;s life can be seen as a microcosm of the changes in culture and society which occurred in Ireland during the end of the 17th century. His loss of status and resultant destitution are direct parallels to the death of the bardic tradition and the subsequent near-extinction of the Irish language.

Ó Rathaille is buried in Muckross Abbey near Killarney in County Kerry.

==In popular culture==
Poet Seamus Heaney and piper Liam O&#x27;Flynn perform &quot;Gile na Gile&quot; on the album &quot;The Poet and the Piper&quot;.

A traditional slow air called &quot;Ó Rathaille&#x27;s Grave&quot; is performed by Matt Molloy on the album &quot;Stony Steps&quot;. It has also been recorded by Denis Murphy and Julia Clifford on the album &quot;The Star Above the Garter&quot; and by Joe Burke on the album &quot;The Tailor&#x27;s Choice&quot;.

<text>The , , ), or vision poem, is a mythopoeic poetic genre that developed during the late 17th and 18th centuries in Irish language poetry. The word may have a number of variations in pronunciation, but the &quot;is&quot; of the first syllable is always realised as a (&quot;sh&quot;) sound.

Many aisling poems are often still sung as traditional sean-nós songs.

==History of the form==
In the aisling, Ireland appears to the poet in a vision in the form of a woman from the Otherworld: sometimes young and beautiful, other times old and haggard. This female figure is generally referred to in the poems as a &quot;spéirbhean&quot; (, &#x27;heavenly woman&#x27;). She laments the current state of the Irish people and predicts an imminent revival of their fortunes, usually linked to the restoration of the Roman Catholic House of Stuart to the thrones of Great Britain and Ireland.

The form developed out of an earlier, non-political genre akin to the French &quot;reverdie&quot;, in which the poet meets a beautiful, supernatural woman who symbolizes the spring season, the bounty of nature, and love. Another source was a tradition rooted in Irish mythology in which a god or goddess of the Tuatha Dé Danann, the pre-Christian pantheon, is seen weeping for the recent death of a local hero.

According to Daniel Corkery, the first aisling poems in the Irish language were composed during the early 17th century by the Roman Catholic priest, historian, and poet Geoffrey Keating. Fr. Keating&#x27;s poem &quot;Mo bhrón mo cheótuirse cléibh is croidhe&quot; (&quot;My sorrow, my gloomy weariness of breast and heart&quot;) and his elegy for the 1626 death of John Fitzgerald are both &quot;Aislingí&quot;. In the latter poem, Fr. Keating awakens from a slumber that has overtaken him along the banks of the River Slaney and is confronted by a vision of the pre-Christian Irish goddess Cliodhna weeping for the death of John Fitzgerald.

In Corca Dhuibhne in 1653, an anonymous bard composed a lament over the recent death by hanging of Irish clan chief, poet, and folk hero Piaras Feiritéar at Cnocán na gCaorach in Killarney, for leading his clansmen in war against the Cromwellian conquest of Ireland. The lament begins, &quot;Do chonnac aisling are maidin an lar ghil&quot; (&quot;I saw a vision on the morning of the bright day&quot;). The vision was the goddess Erin bewailing the death of a man who had overthrown hundreds.

The first of the aisling poets was Aodhagán Ó Rathaille, e (&#x27;father of the aisling&#x27;). In the hands of Ó Rathaille, the aisling tradition was bound up for the first time with the cause of the House of Stuart and of the Jacobite risings. It was Ó Rathaille who, for the first time, made the woman from the Otherworld lament the continued exile of the Stuart heir.

According to Daniel Corkery, &quot;The Aisling proper is Jacobite poetry; and a typical example would run something like this: The poet, weak with thinking of the woe that has overtaken the Gael, falls into a deep slumber. In his dreaming a figure of radiant beauty draws near. She is so bright, so stately, the poet imagines her one of the immortals. Is she Deirdre? Is she Gearnait? Or is she Helen? Or Venus? He questions her, and learns that she is Erin; and her sorrow, he is told, is for her true mate who is in exile beyond the seas. This true mate is, according to the date of the composition, either the Old or Young Pretender; and the poem ends with a promise of speedy redemption on the return of the King&#x27;s son.&quot;

Among the most famous examples of aisling poetry are &quot;Gile na gile&quot; by Ó Rathaille and &quot;Ceo draíochta i gcoim oíche&quot; by Eoghan Rua Ó Súilleabháin, who is also famed for his works in the genre.

The wildly popular sean-nós song &quot;Mo Ghile Mear&quot;, which was composed by County Cork bard Seán &quot;Clárach&quot; Mac Domhnaill, is a lament for the defeat of the Jacobite rising of 1745 at the Battle of Culloden. The poem is a soliloquy by the Kingdom of Ireland, whom Seán Clárach personifies as the goddess Erin bewailing her state and describing herself as a grieving widow due to the defeat and exile of her lawful king. Since being popularised by Sean O Riada, &quot;Mo Ghile Mear&quot; has become one of the most popular Irish songs ever written. It has been recorded by The Chieftains, Mary Black, Muireann Nic Amhlaoibh, Sting, Sibéal, and many other artists.

In 1753, John Cameron () of Dochanassie in Lochaber, composed () &quot;A Song to Doctor Cameron&quot;, an Aisling poem in Scottish Gaelic lamenting the absence from the lands of Clan Cameron of Dr. Archibald Cameron of Lochiel, who had just become the last Jacobite to be executed for high treason at Tyburn.

Cathleen ni Houlihan was based on a figure from aisling poetry but adapted into a stage play by leading members of the Irish Literary Revival in 1902. Cathleen Ni Houlihan is an old and poor woman, a seemingly otherworldly figure that is the embodiment of Irish republicanism and can only be transformed back into a young woman if a young man gives his life for her sake. She also symbolically represents The Morrígan, the goddess of war and sovereignty, from Irish mythology.

In later years, like his fellow Irish-language poets Diarmuid na Bolgaí Ó Sé and Máire Bhuidhe Ní Laoghaire, Ballymacoda-born poet and Deerfield, New York homesteader Pádraig Phiarais Cúndún updated aisling poetry from Jacobitism to more recent religious and political causes of the Irish people. Cúndún&#x27;s aisling poems helped inspire the more recent Irish-language poetry of Seán Gaelach Ó Súilleabháin, who adapted the aisling tradition to the experiences of the Irish diaspora, the events of the Easter Rising of 1916, and the Irish War of Independence.

In Scottish Gaelic literature, Fr. Allan MacDonald&#x27;s eerily prophetic Aisling poem &quot;Ceum nam Mìltean&quot; (&quot;The March of Thousands&quot;), describes waking up after a nightmare and feeling a sense of foreboding and dread about thousands of men marching away, through the newly fallen snow, to a conflict they will never return from. Literary scholar Ronald Black wrote that &quot;Ceum nam Mìltean&quot; deserved to be &quot;first in any anthology of the poetry of World War I&quot; and &quot;would not have been in any way out of place, with regard to style or substance&quot; in Sorley MacLean&#x27;s groundbreaking 1943 Symbolist poetry collection &quot;Dàin do Eimhir&quot;.

In modern poetry composed in the Irish language outside Ireland, a major figure remains. Seán Gaelach Ó Súilleabháin was a native of the now-abandoned island of Inishfarnard off the Beara Peninsula of County Cork. Ó Súilleabháin emigrated to the United States in 1905 and settled in the heavily Irish-American mining city of Butte, Montana, where he continued to both collect and compose Modern literature in Irish until his death in 1957.

In his pre-Easter Rising aisling poem &quot;Cois na Tuinne&quot; (&quot;Beside the Wave&quot;), Seán Gaelach describes pondering the woes of the Gael when he encounters the goddess Érin. Stunned, Seán Gaelach asks whether she is the heroine Medea from Greek mythology or perhaps the lover of 17th-century Irish clan chief Donal Cam O&#x27;Sullivan Beare. Although Érin laments her state, Seán Gaelach promises her that the Irish Volunteers will soon rise up and drive the English from the land. He predicts that the post-independence Irish economy will boom and bring everyone prosperity, the Irish language will be restored to the people, and that Ireland will be re-forested and filled with singing birds in all the branches of the trees.

In the 1917 aisling poem &quot;Bánta Mín Éirinn Glas Óg&quot; (&quot;The Lush Green Plains of Ireland&quot;), Seán Gaelach describes meeting Érin again, proposing marriage to her, and trying to convince her to emigrate with him overseas to &quot;tíribh an cheóil&quot; (&quot;the land of music&quot;). When Seán Gaelach promises never to abandon her, Érin finally agrees to marry him and join him in America.

Despite the end of the Irish War of Independence in 1922, interest in the aisling form and its use by poets continues.

Lady Hazel Lavery posed for portraits as the personification of a number of aisling figures from Irish history such as James Clarence Mangan&#x27;s Dark Rosaleen and W.B. Yeats&#x27;s Cathleen Ni Houlihan. The portraits were painted by her husband Sir John Lavery and appeared on bank notes in numerous forms over the course of the 20th century in Ireland as they were commissioned by the government of the Irish Free State.

During the semicentennial of the Easter Rising in 1966, the Garden of Remembrance, which is dedicated to the memory of &quot;all those who gave their lives in the cause of Irish Freedom&quot;, was formally opened by Eamon de Valera. It is located in the northern fifth of the former Rotunda Gardens in Parnell Square, a Georgian square at the northern end of O&#x27;Connell Street where the paramilitary Irish Volunteers were founded in 1913.

In 1976, a contest was held to find a poem which could express the appreciation and inspiration of the generations that fought and died in the struggle for Irish independence. The winner of the contest was Dublin-born author Liam mac Uistín, whose poem &quot;An Aisling&quot; (&quot;We Saw a Vision&quot;), is now written in Irish, French and English upon the stone wall of the monument.

During Queen Elizabeth II&#x27;s state visit to Ireland in May 2011, Liam mac Uistín&#x27;s poem was read out in Irish during the Queen&#x27;s visit to the Garden of Remembrance.

In Irish, the poem reads:


The Queen then laid a wreath at the Garden in honor of &quot;glúnta na haislinge&quot; (&quot;the generations of the vision&quot;), to whom Liam mac Uistín&#x27;s poem both praises and gives a voice. The Queen&#x27;s gesture was widely praised by the Irish media.

==Satire==
In 1751, Jacobite war poet Alasdair MacMhaighstir Alasdair, whose poetry remains an immortal part of Scottish Gaelic literature, poked fun at the aisling genre in his anti-Whig and anti-Campbell satirical poem, &quot;An Airce&quot; (&quot;The Ark&quot;), which was published for the first time in Edinburgh as part of its author&#x27;s groundbreaking poetry collection &quot;Ais-Eiridh na Sean Chánoin Albannaich&quot; (&quot;The Resurrection of the Old Scottish Language&quot;). Instead of a female deity, the Bard describes a meeting with the ghost of a member of Clan Campbell who was beheaded for Jacobitism. The ghost then prophesies that Clan Campbell will be punished for committing high treason against their lawful King during the Jacobite rising of 1745, first by a repeat of the Ten Plagues of Egypt and then by a second Great Flood upon Argyllshire. The Bard is instructed to emulate Noah and build an Ark for carefully selected Campbells. The moderates are to be welcomed aboard the Ark&#x27;s decks after being purged of their Whiggery by first swallowing a heavy dose of seawater. Redcoats from the Campbell of Argyll Militia and a long list of Campbell tacksmen are to be tied with millstones and thrown overboard, or even much worse. Due to the militant Jacobitism of this poem and many others in the same book with it, all known copies of the collection were rounded up and publicly burned by the public hangman at Edinburgh in 1752.

In around 1780, County Clare poet and hedge school teacher Brian Merriman similarly parodied aisling poetry in his comic masterpiece &quot;Cúirt An Mheán Oíche&quot; (&quot;The Midnight Court&quot;). Instead of a pre-Christian goddess, Merriman describes being arrested by a hideous giant hag while dozing along the shores of Lough Graney. The hag then takes the Bard to the ruined church at Moynoe, where the women of Ireland are suing the men for their unwillingness to marry and father children. After self-justifying arguments by the morally bankrupt lawyers for both genders, the judge, the pre-Christian goddess Aoibheal, rules that all men except Roman Catholic priests must marry before the age of 20 on pain of flogging at the hands of Ireland&#x27;s understandably angry and frustrated women. The poet is only saved from being the first single man to be flogged by waking up and realizing that his arrest and the trial were a nightmare.

In his poem &quot;Aisling an t-Saighdeir&quot; (&quot;The Soldier&#x27;s Dream&quot;), Scottish Gaelic bard and World War I veteran Dòmhnall Ruadh Chorùna recalls seeing a full-grown red deer stag in the rush-covered glens of North Uist and how he scrambled over rocks and banks trying to get a clear shot at the animal. Dòmhnall slowly took aim and ignited the gunpowder with a spark, only to find that the stag was gone. He had been replaced by Dòmhnall&#x27;s Captain shouting retreat, as the Imperial German Army had swept behind the Cameron Highlanders and were about to cut off all opportunity to escape. Dòmhnall recalled that he had awakened not a moment too soon and that he barely escaped &quot;the net&quot; before the Germans &quot;pulled it together.&quot; Some members of his unit, however, were not so lucky and were taken away to POW camps in the German Empire.

In Paul Muldoon&#x27;s 1983 satirical poem &quot;Aisling&quot;, which was written in response to the 1981 hunger strike campaign by Bobby Sands and other incarcerated members of the Provisional IRA, the goddess Erin was recast to symbolize Anorexia.

<text>Piaras Feiritéar (; 1600 – 1653), or Pierce Ferriter, was an Irish clan Chief, and poet. Although best known for his many works of Bardic poetry in the Irish language, Feiritéar is also a widely revered folk hero in the Dingle Peninsula for his role as a leader of the nascent Irish Confederacy, which led to his 1653 summary execution at Killarney for resisting the Cromwellian conquest of Ireland.

==Early life==

Feiritéar was the last Chief of the Name of the completely Gaelicized Norman Clan Feiritéar and Lord of Ballyferriter in Corca Dhuibhne.

Feiritéar was a harpist as well as an extremely sophisticated multilingual poet in the Irish language. He was known for his blend of laments, eulogies and satires in the Bardic tradition and for composing love poetry with much wider European influences. His best known work, &quot;Leig díot t’airm, a mhacoimh mná&quot; (&quot;Lay aside thy arms, maiden&quot;), is a poem about a beautiful woman. It is believed that he may have written poetry in English, but none of this has survived. Some critics have argued that his Irish poetry shows the influence of the English Elizabethans.

==Warrior==
A leader during the Confederate Ireland wars, Feiritéar was wounded during an attack by Oliver Cromwell&#x27;s Roundheads on Clan Feiritéar&#x27;s stronghold of Tralee Castle in 1641. Feiritéar and his Clansmen held the castle until the fall of Ross Castle in Killarney to the Cromwellians in June 1653. Granted safe passage by Cromwellian commander Brigadier Nelson, Feiritéar travelled to arrange surrender terms. Instead, he was seized at Castlemaine and hanged alongside others, including his brother-in-law, Dominican friar Tadhg Ó Muircheartaigh, on Cnocán na gCaorach in Killarney on 15 October 1653.

==Legacy==

Piaras Feiritéar remains a folk hero for the Irish-speaking people of the Dingle Peninsula, particularly in his native Ard na Caithne, where the ruins of his family&#x27;s castle can still be seen, and his poetry still lives as the oral literature. 

Writing in 1926, Daniel Corkery revealed that Piaras Feiritéar&#x27;s 1653 execution helped give birth to the &quot;Aisling&quot; tradition within Irish poetry, in which a &quot;spéirbhean&quot; (a beautiful and queenly woman from the Otherworld, symbolizing Ireland) laments her state and, in later versions, prophesies a better future. In 1653, an anonymous County Kerry Bard composed a lament in verse over Feiritéar&#x27;s death. The lament, which begins, &quot;Do chonnac aisling are maidin an lar ghil&quot; (&quot;I saw a vision on the morning of the bright day&quot;). The vision was the Pre-Christian goddess Erin bewailing the death of a man who had overthrown hundreds.

In &quot;The Western Island&quot; Robin Flower relates a story told by Seanchai Tomás Ó Criomhthain, who alleged that Piaras had a stronghold upon Great Blasket Island that he used to evade the English.

In 1934, Pádraig Ó Duinnín edited a book entitled &quot;Dánta Phiarais Feiritéir: maille le réamh-rádh agus nótaí&quot; which contained 23 of Piaras&#x27;s surviving poems. In the book, Ó Duinnín devotes a chapter to the influence of Feiritéar&#x27;s poetry and life on the folklore of the area. 

In 2001, Munster Irish poet and writer Máire Mhac an tSaoi published an award-winning novel &quot;A Bhean Óg Ón...&quot; about the relationship between Piaras and Meg Russell, for whom he wrote much of his love poetry in the Irish language.

There is a memorial to Piaras Feiritéar and three other Kerry poets from the Early Modern period, Séafraidh Ó Donnchadha an Ghleanna, Aodhagan Ó Rathaille and Eoghan Rua Ó Súilleabháin in the form of a sculpture of a &quot;spéirbhean&quot; (a dream woman, symbol of Ireland) with the names of all four poets carved into it in Killarney town.

<doc id="787873" wikidata="Q1057121" url="?curid=787873" title="Elgin National Watch Company">
<text>The Elgin National Watch Company, commonly known as Elgin Watch Company, was a major US watch maker from 1864 to 1968. The company sold watches under the names Elgin, Lord Elgin, and Lady Elgin.

For nearly 100 years, the company&#x27;s manufacturing complex in Elgin, Illinois, was the world&#x27;s largest site dedicated to watchmaking.

==History==
The company was first incorporated in August 1864 as the National Watch Company in Chicago, Illinois, by Philo Carpenter, Howard Z. Culver, Benjamin W. Raymond, George M. Wheeler, Thomas S. Dickerson and W. Robbins. In September of the same year, the founders visited the Waltham Watch Company in Waltham, Massachusetts, and successfully convinced seven of Waltham&#x27;s watchmakers to come to work for their new company.

The growing young city of Elgin, Illinois, some 30 miles northwest of Chicago, was chosen as the factory site. Initially, as part of the deal, the city was asked to donate 35 acres (142,000 m2) of land for the construction of the factory. The city selected a derelict farm; however, the owners refused to sell the property unless the city purchased their entire 71 acres for $3,550. Four Elgin businessmen agreed to acquire the property and then donated the required 35 acres to the watch company. The company reorganized in April 1865 and completed the factory in 1866. The first movement, delivered in 1867, was named the B.W. Raymond in honor of Benjamin W. Raymond. The watch was an 18-size, full plate design. In 1869, the National Watch Company won &quot;Best Watches, Illinois Manufacture&quot; at the 17th Annual Illinois State Fair, for which it won a silver medal. The company officially changed its name to the Elgin National Watch Company in 1874, as the Elgin name had come into common usage for their watches.

==Later history==
The company built the Elgin National Watch Company Observatory in 1910 to maintain scientifically precise times in their watches. The company produced many of the self-winding wristwatch movements made in the United States, beginning with the 607 and 618 calibers (which were bumper wind) and the calibers 760 and 761 (30 and 27 jewels respectively).

During World War II, the company halted all civilian manufacturing. It moved into the defense industry, manufacturing military watches, chronometers, fuzes for artillery shells, altimeters, and other aircraft instruments and sapphire bearings used for aiming cannons.

Over time, the company operated several additional plants, mostly in Elgin. However, the company also located additional plants in Aurora, Illinois, and Lincoln, Nebraska. In 1963, the company relocated most manufacturing operations to a new plant in Blaney, a town near Columbia, South Carolina, which renamed itself Elgin, South Carolina. The original, obsolete factory in Elgin closed in 1964 after having produced half of the total number of pocket watches manufactured in the United States (dollar-type not included). The plant, including its iconic clock tower, was razed in 1966. The company maintained a leased building in Elgin that housed offices and casing, fitting, shipping, service, and trade material departments until about 1970.

The company discontinued all US manufacturing in 1968 and sold the rights to the name &quot;Elgin&quot;, which were subsequently resold multiple times over the years. The rights eventually were purchased by MZ Berger Inc., which manufactures its watches in China and distributes them outside traditional watch dealerships. Elgin-branded watches produced after 1968 have no connection to the Elgin Watch Company.

The city of Elgin, North Dakota, derives its name from the watch brand. Likewise, NBA Hall of Famer Elgin Baylor was named after the Elgin National Watch Company.

<text>Mueang Samut Prakan district (, ) or colloquially as &quot;Paknam Samut Prakan&quot; () is the capital district (&quot;amphoe mueang&quot;) of Samut Prakan province in central Thailand. The district has the highest population of all districts of Thailand.

== Administration ==

=== Central administration ===
Mueang Samut Prakan is divided into 13 subdistricts (&quot;tambon&quot;), which are further subdivided into 35 administrative villages (&quot;muban&quot;).


=== Local administration ===
There is one city (&quot;thesaban nakhon&quot;) in the district:
* Samut Prakan (Thai: ) consisting of subdistrict Pak Nam.

There are two towns (&quot;thesaban mueang&quot;) in the district:
* Pak Nam Samut Prakan (Thai: ) consisting of parts of subdistrict Bang Mueang.
* Phraek Sa Mai (Thai: ) consisting of parts of subdistrict Phraek Sa Mai.

There are five subdistrict municipalities (&quot;thesaban tambon&quot;) in the district:

==Environment==
The district&#x27;s coastline has seen severe erosion since the 1990s. Coastal mangrove forests were destroyed and replaced with shrimp farms. Three to five metres of shoreline has been submerged every year since then, resulting in the loss of 4,000 rai of land to the sea.

Thailand lost almost one third of its coastal mangrove forests between 1961 and 2000. According to Thailand&#x27;s Department of Marine and Coastal Resources, a quarter of the country&#x27;s shores—about 700 kilometres (500 miles)—are eroding, some &quot;severely&quot;.

==Transportation==
Samut Prakan is served by the southern end of the Sukhumvit Line on the BTS Skytrain (from Samrong to Kheha stations).
The major thoroughfare in Samut Prakan is Sukhumvit Road, which links the city to Central Bangkok all the way towards the Cambodian border in Trat.

<text>The mtab (contraction of &quot; mounted file systems table&quot;) file is a system information file, commonly found on Unix-like systems.

==Overview==
This file lists all currently mounted filesystems along with their initialization options. codice_1 has a lot in common with codice_2, the distinction being that the latter is a configuration file listing which available filesystems should be mounted on which mount points at boot time, whereas the former lists currently mounted ones, which can include manually mounted ones not listed in fstab. Therefore, mtab is usually in a format similar to that of fstab. Most of the time it is possible to directly use lines from codice_1 in codice_4.

The file commonly resides in codice_5. In some systems it is a symlink to /proc/mounts.

==Example==

<text>Baron Boris Vladimirovich Shturmer (; – ) was a Russian lawyer, a Master of Ceremonies at the Russian Court, and a district governor. He became a member of the Russian Assembly and served as prime minister in 1916. A confidant of the Empress Alexandra, under his administration the country suffered drastic inflation and a transportation breakdown, which led to severe food shortages. Stürmer simply let matters drift until he was able to be relieved of this post. During the course of his career, he was Minister of Internal Affairs and Foreign Minister of the Russian Empire.

== Biography ==
Stürmer was born into a landowning family in Baykovo, Kesovogorsky District, Tver Governorate. His father Vladimir Vilgelmovich Stürmer was of German descent and a retired Captain of Cavalry in the Imperial Russian Army. His mother was Ermoniya Panina.

A graduate of the Faculty of Law, Saint Petersburg State University in 1872, Stürmer entered the Ministry of Justice, the Governing Senate and the Interior Ministry. He was appointed in 1879 as Master of the Bedchamber at the Russian Imperial Court.

===Governor===
In 1891 he became chairman of the district council in Tver. An appointment as Governor of Novgorod in 1894 and Yaroslavl in 1896 followed. Stürmer avoided any clash with the zemstvo, remaining patient. In a very delicate situation he declared himself a &quot;conservative not out of fear but out of conscience&quot;.

In 1902 Vyacheslav von Plehve, the Minister of Interior appointed him as Director of the Department of General Affairs at the Ministry of Interior. After Plehve was killed, Stürmer was willing to succeed him. The tsar even signed a ukase to that effect, yet the post eventually went to Prince Svyatopolk-Mirsky. Stürmer was then admitted into the State Council of Imperial Russia in 1904. This appointment was an &quot;absolutely exceptional example in the history of the Russian bureaucracy&quot;. He did not have the formal service qualification necessary for such a high appointment to hold the post of minister or the rank of senator. After Bloody Sunday (1905) again Stürmer was mentioned to become Minister of Interior. Stürmer became close friends with Alexei Bobrinsky. He dreamed of &quot;autocracy, located in combination with the constitutional regime&quot;. Stürmer was one of those representatives of the bureaucratic elite, who preferred to distance themselves from the extreme right. Few members of the Council of State could boast of such a relationship with the monarch.

In the State Council, he supported Pyotr Stolypin and his closest collaborators on agrarian reform, land management and agriculture Chief Governor Alexander Krivoshein &quot;in their endeavors in the field of devices peasants&quot;. Stürmer, being a dualist, opposed, on one hand, the Black Hundreds, speaking for unlimited autocracy, and the other – the Octobrists and the Kadets, to practice the idea of parliamentarism. Stürmer believed that the division of bureaucrats on the right and liberals required a very cautious attitude.

In the 1913 countrywide celebrations of the Romanov Tercentenary, he accompanied the tsar and his family on a journey to Tver. In autumn of the same year, he was appointed as mayor of Moscow as the candidate from the left was unacceptable to the tsar. He became a member of the Domestic Patriotic Union (OPS) – a moderately right-monarchist organization, founded in 1915. In November 1915 it was proposed the old prime minister Ivan Goremykin should be replaced by Alexei Khvostov. Though on 18 January 1916 the tsar invited Stürmer to discuss the possibility of a new job.

===Prime minister===
Stürmer petitioned Nicholas II to sanction the change of his German-surname to Panin. Since the Panins were a distinguished family of Russian nobility, the monarch could not agree to Stürmer&#x27;s request until he had consulted all members of the Panin family. The tsarina and Grigori Rasputin had the opinion it was not necessary for Stürmer to change his name. Pending these proceedings, Stürmer was appointed prime minister on 20 January 1916, following the 76-year-old Ivan Goremykin, who was opposed to the convening of the Duma. Nicholas ordered the new prime minister to &quot;take all measures&quot; to ensure that &quot;the government avoided any conflicts with the State Duma&quot;, and gave &quot;specific instructions&quot; to &quot;improve relations between the government and the Romanovs&quot;.

On the eve of the opening of the Duma, the Prime Minister told Mikhail Rodzianko that &quot;the government is ready to make a concession to the Progressive Bloc, provided that the unit itself is also ready to make compromises&quot;. It was a shift to the left; they expected he would launch a more liberal and conciliatory politics. The Duma gathered on 9 February 1916. The deputies were disappointed when Stürmer held his speech, as the politicians tried to bring the government under the control of the Duma. For the first time in his life, the tsar had made a visit to the Tauride Palace, which made it practically impossible to hiss at the new prime minister.

&quot;As Director of his Secretariat Sturmer selected . This choice, which is regarded as scandalous, is significant.&quot; &quot;The extreme right-wing deputy (A.I. Savenko, a leader of the Black Hundreds) could declare at the session of the Duma on February 29, 1916:

A strongly prevailing opinion that Rasputin was the actual ruler of the country was of great psychological importance. Alexei Khvostov and Iliodor concocted a plan to kill Rasputin. Khvostov created the rumour suggesting that Alexandra and Rasputin were German agents or spies. Evidence that Rasputin actually worked for the Germans is flimsy at best. Rather paranoid, Rasputin went to Alexander Spiridovich, head of the palace police, on 1 March. He was constantly in a state of nervous excitement. Khvostov had to resign within a week and Boris Stürmer was appointed in his place. In the same month Minister of War Alexei Polivanov, who in his few months of office had brought about a recovery of the efficiency of the Russian army, was removed and replaced by Dmitry Shuvayev. Because of the stresses of war on an inefficient government and at random politics, bureaucracy, zemstvos, in two months of office Stürmer succeeded in making the public want Goremykin back. According to Maurice Paléologue he had a taste for history, particularly the anecdotal and picturesque side of history. Again according to Paléologue Stürmer consulted Anna Vyrubova about everything. The French ambassador was aghast, depicting Stürmer as &quot;worse than a mediocrity – a third rate intellect, mean spirit, low character, doubtful honesty, no experience, and no idea of state business&quot;.

From then everything went down, according to Alexei Khvostov. For War Minister Alexei Polivanov – who both had to leave politics in March 1916 – it was the beginning of the end. Stürmer took over the Ministry of Interior. After he was simultaneously acting as Minister of the Interior and Minister of Foreign Affairs, he was regarded by Rodzianko as a &quot;dictator with full powers&quot;. Under his administration, the country suffered drastic inflation and a transportation breakdown, which led to severe food shortages. Russia&#x27;s economy, which had been growing until the beginning of the Great War, was now declining at a very rapid rate. Stürmer was inclined to peace negotiations but his appointment was received with consternation, as an open affront to the whole nation. In June the tsar had to decide on the question of Polish autonomy, already academic given that Poland had been occupied by the Germans the previous year. Stürmer and most of his colleagues were more hostile to the idea than ever.
The Minister of Foreign Affairs Sergey Sazonov, who had pleaded for an independent and autonomous Congress Poland, was replaced on 23 July (&quot;Sturmer is secretly carrying on a very active campaign against him&quot;). They disagreed on too many questions. &quot;After Sazonov&#x27;s dismissal Stürmer took the portfolio of Foreign Affairs; the emperor had ordered him to conduct the foreign policy of the Empire on the same principles as before, i.e., in the closest co-operation with the Allied Governments. His activities in this department resulted in the premature declaration of war by Romania, so disastrous for that country and for Russia.&quot;
In July Aleksandr Khvostov, not in good health, was appointed as Minister of Interior (after the Brusilov Offensive Romania joined the Allies in August and attacked Transylvania). In September Alexander Protopopov, had been appointed as his successor. Protopopov, an industrialist, and landowner, raised the question of transferring the food supply from the Ministry of Agriculture to the Ministry of the Interior. A majority of the zemstvo leaders announced that they would not work with his ministry. His food plan was universally condemned. In October Vladimir Sukhomlinov was released from prison on the instigation of Alexandra, Rasputin, and Protopopov (on 24 October (O.S) the Kingdom of Poland was established by its occupiers). This time the public was outraged and the opposition parties decided to attack Stürmer, his government, and the &quot;Dark forces&quot;. For them Stürmer simply let matters drift. 
The opposition parties decided to attack Stürmer, his government and the &quot;Dark forces&quot;. Since Stürmer has been in power Rasputin&#x27;s authority has greatly increased. For the liberals in the parliament, Grigori Rasputin, who believed in autocracy and absolute monarchy, was one of the main obstacles.

===Downfall===
On 1 November, Pavel Milyukov, concluding that Stürmer&#x27;s policies placed in jeopardy the Triple Entente, delivered his famous &quot;stupidity or treason&quot; speech at the Imperial Duma, which had not been gathering since February. He highlighted numerous governmental failures. Alexander Kerensky called the ministers &quot;hired assassins&quot; and &quot;cowards&quot; and said they were &quot;guided by the contemptible Grishka Rasputin!&quot;. Stürmer, followed by all his ministers, walked out.
Grand Duke Alexander and his brother Grand Duke George requested the tsar to fire Stürmer. Even the Tsar had to concede that Stürmer was as much of a red rag to the Duma as to everyone else. On 10 November he was sacked, the foreign ministry was temporarily led by his deputy Anatoly Neratov. It appeared to Maurice Paléologue, the French ambassador, Stürmer was a broken man. Following his resignation, Stürmer ran for a seat in the Fourth Duma.

He was arrested by the Russian Provisional Government after the February Revolution in 1917 and died of uremia in September at the hospital of the Peter and Paul Fortress (or the Kresty Prison).

<text>Alexander Fyodorovich Trepov (; ; 30 September 1862 – 10 November 1928) was the Prime Minister of the Russian Empire from 23 November 1916 until 9 January 1917. He was conservative, a monarchist, a member of the Russian Assembly, and an advocate of moderate reforms opposed to the influence of Grigori Rasputin.

==Biography==

===Early life===
Alexander was the youngest of the four sons of general Fyodor Trepov, who was involved in the suppression of the January Uprising in 1864 and between 1873 and 1878 served as Governor of St Petersburg. All of his three brothers held senior positions during the reign of Nicholas II. According to MP-nationalist AI Savenko, Alexander was &quot;the most intelligent of the brothers, capable, very determined, with lots of character&quot;.

Alexander was educated in His Majesty&#x27;s Page Corps. He worked in the Ministry of the Interior (1889–1892), was elected Marshal of Nobility of Pereiaslavl Uezd (1892–1895), and assistant State Secretary (1899).

Alexander was appointed as a member of the special commission to draft a plan for a State Duma, according to the rescript of February 18, 1905, and the Manifesto of October 17.

He was the brother of General Dmitri Feodorovich Trepov, who during the Revolution of 1905/1906 served as deputy minister of the interior, played a major role in the repression of unrest and was described as the real ruler of the country.

Trepov became senator in the Governing Senate in 1906. In an unknown year he was sent abroad to study the parliamentary systems of Western Europe. In 1914 he was appointed in the State Council. Trepov was appointed Minister of Transport, Railways and Communication on November 12 (30 October O.S.), 1915, and Grigori Rasputin was grieved. He developed the Kirov Railway, constructed with a number of war prisoners, to improve the transport connections between the ice-free port of Murmansk with the Eastern Front during World War I.
The food problem in the big cities was a difficult issue. Aleksandr Naumov suggested to create a special meeting of five Ministers on Military, Internal Affairs, Communications, Agriculture, and Finance. It was headed by Trepov. On 1 January 1916 Trepov became minister of Transport under Ivan Goremykin, who was succeeded shortly after by Boris Stürmer. Trepov had secretly designed a plan of railway construction and introduced it in government. Trepov quickly established himself in office and showed that his ambition went further. Having proven himself to be a competent organizer, Trepov was now willing to become the next prime minister. According to Naumov, Trepov was one of the most temperamental and talkative members of the Council of Ministers, dealing with an almost dictatorial Stürmer as Prime Minister, Interior Minister and Foreign Minister.

===Prime minister===
On 8 November Boris Stürmer (pro-peace) was dismissed as prime minister/minister of foreign affairs, to the rejoicing of the Duma.
On 9 November Empress Alexandra proposed to appoint Ivan Shcheglovitov to Foreign Affairs, but he seemed to be unacceptable. On 10 November 1916 the bellicose Trepov was appointed new prime minister, promising to promote a parliamentary system, but keeping his position of transport minister. Trepov&#x27;s declaration contained promises to urgently reform the municipal government, to enter the rural municipality district council and to remove national and religious restrictions to education. Because of the shortage in food in the big cities Aleksei Aleksandrovich Bobrinsky, the minister of agriculture had to give up his post; he was succeeded by Aleksandr Aleksandrovich Rittikh. On 17 November Nikolai Pokrovsky was appointed to the ministry of foreign affairs. According to Orlando Figes it was the Russian liberals final opportunity to &#x27;make their peace&#x27; with the government.

Trepov was a new, &#x27;modern day Stolypin&#x27;, and was determined to win over the more moderate Duma politicians by making concessions; Pavel Milyukov and Alexander Guchkov were ready to accept his gesture (and possibly a position in his cabinet), but the more radical and socialist Duma members remained determined to bring down the government.

Trepov was supposed to achieve the resignation of four of the most unpopular ministers. On 16 November Trepov informed Alexander Protopopov that he wished him to give up his position in the Ministry of the Interior and take over that of Trade and Industry, but Protopopov refused. Trepov had made the dismissal of Protopopov an indispensable condition of his accepting the presidency of the council, Protopopov being a &#x27;protege of Rasputin&#x27;. and supposedly having mental problems. On 19 November Trepov declared full transfer of the food issue at the request of the Duma to the ministry of agriculture.

On 27 November both Protopopov and Alexandra travelled to Stavka. Trepov threatened to resign on the next day. On 29 November/12 December the German Chancellor, Theobald von Bethmann Hollweg, in a speech in the Reichstag, offered to open negotiations with the Entente in a neutral country. On 2 December, on his appearance in the Imperial Duma, Trepov revealed France and Britain promised Russia Constantinople and the Bosporus, but was loudly hissed at by the Socialists. The deputies shouted &quot;down with the Ministers! Down with Protopopov!&quot;. Pokrovsky said that Russia would never sign a peace treaty with the Central Powers, which caused a storm of applause. On 7 December the cabinet demanded that Protopopov should go to the emperor and resign, but at the request of the Tsar, his wife, Anna Vyrubova and Rasputin combined the pro-peace Protopopov stayed in his job.

===Rasputin===

Trepov having failed to eliminate Protopopov tried to bribe Rasputin. With the help of general A.A. Mosolov, his brother-in-law, Trepov offered a substantial amount of money, a bodyguard and a house to Rasputin, when he would leave politics. Trepov had offered Rasputin 200,000 roubles in cash to return to Siberia and never again involve himself in politics. Rasputin refused the offer and informed Alexandra. The tsar received Trepov on Monday the 12th Dec. On 13 December Rasputin warned against the influence of Trepov. Alexandra reacted with a letter to her husband against Trepov. She hated Trepov and Makarov; the tsarina even wanted Trepov hanged. Fighting the war against Germany had to go on. Woodrow Wilson planned to bring the United States into the war, when the Germans attempted to negotiate peace with the allies. As a result, and in short Alexandra&#x27;s and Rasputin&#x27;s standing and prestige in society fell, and led to the final determined conspiracy by Prince Felix Yusupov, and Grand Dukes Grand Duke Dmitry Pavlovich and Grand Duke Nikolai Mikhailovich to have him murdered in the hope stopping Alexandra&#x27;s interference in politics.

===Post-Premier===
On 16 December 1916 the Imperial Duma was closed for Christmas until 28 December (which is 29 December until January 9, 1917 N.S.). On 17 December Rasputin was murdered. On 29 December a hesitating prince Nikolai Golitsyn became the successor of Trepov, who was dismissed on the 27th. Also Pavel Ignatieff, Alexander Makarov and Dmitry Shuvayev were replaced.
According to Bernard Pares Trepov was probably appointed as a curator at the Tsarskoye Selo Lyceum, where he met the tsar on February 1, 1917.

After the October Revolution he was arrested by the Cheka. Trepov collaborated with Count to protect the imperial family. From autumn 1918 to January 1919 he led in Helsinki the &quot;Special Committee for Russian in Finland&quot;. In the 1920s Trepov emigrated to France, from where he supported the White Army. He became president of the &quot;Union des Organisations monarchiques russes&quot;. In 1921 he and his brother-in-law Alexander Mosolov participated in the &quot;Congrès monarchiste russe&quot;, organized in Bad Reichenhall.

He died in 1928 and was buried at the Russian Orthodox Cemetery, Nice.

<text>Prince Nikolai Dmitriyevich Golitsyn (; 12 April 1850 – 2 July 1925) was a Russian aristocrat, monarchist and the last prime minister of Imperial Russia. He was in office from 29 December 1916 (O.S.) or 9 January 1917 (N.S.) until his government resigned after the outbreak of the February Revolution.

== Biography ==
Golitsyn was born in Porechye, a village in the Moscow Governorate near Mozhaisk, into the noble Golitsyn family. His father was Dmitry Borisovich Golitsyn (1803–1864) who came from Bolshiye Vyazyomy, the family estate. Nikolai passed his childhood in the Dorogobuzhsky District. He graduated from the Imperial Alexander Lyceum in 1871 and entered the Ministry of the Interior, where he was appointed to the Łomża Governorate (Congress Poland). He became vice-governor of Archangelsk (1879); vice-director of the Economics Department of the Ministry of Internal Affairs (1884); Governor of the guberniyas of Arkhangelsk (1885), Kaluga (1893), and Tver (1897). He was appointed senator in 1903. As a plenipotentiary of the Red Cross in Turgay and Uralskaya Oblasts and Saratov Governorate he organized aid for famine-stricken areas (1907–1908). He was a member of the State Council (1912) and chairman of the commission to render assistance to the Russian prisoners of war abroad (1915). He was a deputy chairman of one of Empress Alexandra&#x27;s charity commissions.

=== Prime minister ===
On 25 December he was invited by Empress Alexandra for an interview, but received by the tsar. A hesitating Prince Golitsyn did not want to succeed prime minister Alexander Trepov, insisted on the resignation of the Minister of Internal Affairs Alexander Protopopov and begged Nicholas II to cancel his appointment, citing his lack of preparation for the role of prime minister. The tsar refused, but Pavel Ignatieff, Alexander Makarov and Dmitry Shuvayev were replaced; Nikolai Dobrovolsky was appointed. The Council of Ministers officially met once or twice a week (seven meetings in January, six in February). The main concern of the government was &quot;food and transport.&quot; The most important thing, according to Prince Golitsyn, was the convocation of the Duma and the desire to work together with it and somehow make this work possible. The government discussed the timeframe for resuming the Duma sessions: it was originally scheduled to open on 12 January, then - on 31 January, but in the end, it was postponed until 14 February. Protopopov, who excused himself many times and did not attend the meetings, suggested dissolution or postponing the Duma even further.

Despite being the oldest member of the council (Golitsyn was 66, while the others were 36 to 63 years old), he was not a leader. (His advanced years led him to regularly fall asleep during State Council meetings.) In January 1917 two rival institutions, the Duma and the Petrograd Soviet, competed for power. On 8 February, at the wish of the tsar, Nikolay Maklakov, together with Protopopov drafted the text of the manifesto on the dissolution of the Duma (cancelled and scheduled to resume on 14 February 1917). On 14 February mass demonstrations broke out. On 15 February Alexander Kerensky made a speech in the Duma that almost called for the assassination of the emperor. A week later the demonstrations on Nevsky Prospekt became more serious. On 25th members of the government gathered at Golitsyn&#x27;s apartment at Konnogvardeyskiy Bul&#x27;var, 13. Belyaev suggested his colleagues remove Protopopov from his post, as he saw in him the main cause of unrest.

On 26 February, the tsar ordered the army to suppress the rioting by force, but troops began to mutiny, joined the protesters, and demanded a new constitutional government. In the evening the meeting of the Duma was prorogued, although Golitsyn and Nikolai Pokrovsky opposed its dissolution. Golitsyn used a (signed, but not yet dated ukaze which had been given to Trepov) declaring that his majesty had decided to interrupt the Imperial Duma until 1 April, leaving it with no legal authority to act. The deputies refused to leave and a private committee of Duma members was formed to help restore order.

=== Downfall and execution ===
The Council of Ministers met the evening of 27 February 1917 and submitted its resignation to the emperor, asking Grand Duke Michael Alexandrovich to temporarily act as regent, which he refused. Following Nicholas&#x27;s decision to abdicate, the Provisional Committee of the State Duma ordered former ministers and senior officials arrested. Golitsyn was arrested by police and transferred to the Peter and Paul Fortress for interrogation, where he was starved and tortured, then released on 13 March.

On 21 April 1917 he was again arrested by police and interrogated by the Extraordinary Commission of Inquiry of the Provisional Government. After the assumption of power by the Bolsheviks, Golitsyn was allowed to leave but decided to stay in Russia, earning his living by repairing shoes in Moscow or Petrograd and guarding vegetable gardens in Rybinsk. During the period from 1920 to 1924 he was twice arrested by the OGPU, on the suspicion of connection with counterrevolutionaries. After his third arrest (on 12 February 1925), he was executed on 2 July 1925 in Leningrad on the charge of participating in a &quot;counter-revolutionary monarchist organization&quot;.

==Family==
Prince Nikolai Golitsyn married in Saint Petersburg on 7 April 1881 Evgenia Andrejevna von Grünberg (Saint-Petersburg, 18 April 1864 - Nice, 18 July 1934). The couple had six children:

<doc id="787898" wikidata="Q241036" url="?curid=787898" title="Julia Drusilla">
<text>Julia Drusilla (16 September 16 – 10 June 38 AD) was a member of the Roman imperial family, the second daughter and fifth child of Germanicus and Agrippina the Elder to survive infancy. She was the favorite sister of Emperor Caligula, who, after her death, had her deified under the name Diva Drusilla Panthea, and named his daughter Julia Drusilla after her.

==Biography==
=== Early life ===
Drusilla was born in Abitarvium, modern-day Koblenz, Germany. Besides the future emperor she also had two other brothers, Nero Julius Caesar and Drusus Caesar, as well as two sisters, Julia Livilla and the later empress Agrippina the Younger. She was a great-granddaughter of the Emperor Augustus and empress Livia, grand-niece of the Emperor Tiberius, niece of the Emperor Claudius, and aunt of the Emperor Nero. After the death of her father, Germanicus, she and her siblings were brought back to Rome by their mother and raised with the help of their paternal grandmother, Antonia Minor.

=== Marriages ===
In 33, Drusilla was married to Lucius Cassius Longinus, a friend of the Emperor Tiberius. She and Cassius are not known to have had any children. After Caligula became emperor in 37, he ordered their divorce and married his sister to his friend Marcus Aemilius Lepidus. 

During an illness in 37, Caligula changed his will to name Drusilla his heir, making her the first woman to be named heir in a Roman imperial will. This was probably an attempt to continue the Julian line through any children she might have, leaving her husband to rule in the meantime. Caligula recovered, however, and in 38, at the age of 21, Drusilla died. Her brother went on to deify her, consecrating her with the title &quot;Panthea&quot; (all-goddess) and mourning at her public funeral as though he were a widower.

==Reputation==

Drusilla was widely reputed to be her brother&#x27;s favorite, likely affording her great influence over Caligula. The rumors of incest that surrounded Drusilla could be attempts to discredit Caligula&#x27;s leadership following his death. The most popular source of these rumors comes from Suetonius, a Roman historian born 28 years after Caligula&#x27;s death; he wrote that &quot;[Caligula] lived in habitual incest with all his sisters&quot;, claiming Caligula and Drusilla had once been caught together by their grandmother, Antonia.

Rumors reported the brother and sister were lovers from a young age, with their public relationship deemed incestuous by various contemporaries. Caligula treated Drusilla as if she were his &quot;legal wife&quot; even while she was married. Drusilla earned a rather poor reputation because of the close bond she shared with Caligula, and was likened to a prostitute by later scholars attempting to discredit Caligula.

Some historians suggest that Caligula was motivated by more than mere lust or love in pursuing intimate relationships with his sisters, instead employing a deliberate pattern for Roman lineage based on the Hellenistic monarchs of the Ptolemaic dynasty, where marriages between jointly ruling brothers and sisters had become tradition rather than sex scandals. This also has been used to explain why his despotism apparently was more evident to his contemporaries than those of Augustus and Tiberius.

One source of rumors surrounding Caligula and Drusilla may be derived from formal Roman dining habits. It was customary in patrician households for the host and hostess of a dinner (typically the husband and wife, as heads of the household) to be seated in positions of honor at banquets in their residence. In the case of a young bachelor being the head of the household, the female position of honor was traditionally filled by his sisters, in rotation: in Caligula&#x27;s case, Agrippina the Younger, Drusilla, and Julia Livilla would have taken turns sitting in the place of honor. Caligula apparently broke with this tradition and reserved the place of honor exclusively for Drusilla. This could also be understood as Caligula placing Drusilla in a place of public prominence after naming her as heir.

==Death and aftermath==

Drusilla died on 10 June 38 AD, probably of an illness that was rampant in Rome at the time. Caligula was said never to have left her side throughout her illness and, after she had died, he would not let anyone take away her body.

Caligula was badly affected by the loss. He buried his sister with the honors of an Augusta and acted as a grieving widower. He had the Roman Senate declare her a Goddess, as &quot;Diva Drusilla&quot;, deifying her as a representation of the Roman goddess Venus or the Greek goddess Aphrodite. Drusilla was consecrated as &quot;Panthea&quot;, most likely on the anniversary of the birthday of Augustus.

In addition to the other honors she was given after her death by Caligula, he also declared a period of mourning. During this time, it became a capital crime to laugh, bathe, or dine with your parents, spouse, or children.

A year later, Caligula named his only known daughter, Julia Drusilla, after his dead sister. Meanwhile, the widowed husband of Drusilla, Marcus Aemilius Lepidus, reportedly became a lover to her sisters, Julia Livilla and Agrippina the Younger, in an apparent attempt to gain their support so that he could succeed Caligula. This political conspiracy was discovered during that autumn by Caligula while in Germania Superior. Lepidus was swiftly executed and Livilla and Agrippina were exiled to the Pontine Islands.

==Portrayals==
* The narrator of the story in the Robert Graves novel &quot;I, Claudius&quot; states that Drusilla was killed by Caligula, though admitting he does not have firm evidence of this belief.
* This theme was embellished considerably in the 1976 BBC television adaptation of &quot;I, Claudius&quot;, where Drusilla was played by Beth Morris. A pregnant Drusilla was subjected to a brutal Caesarean section by an insane Caligula, who swallows the child off-camera as Chronos did his children. A subsequent shot depicting Caligula and his blood-soaked beard was cut from the episode before broadcast in the United States, but has since been restored in later VHS and DVD releases.
* Teresa Ann Savoy played Drusilla in the 1979 motion picture &quot;Caligula&quot;, which showed a version of Drusilla dying from a fever, followed by a scene of Caligula licking her corpse in mourning, then having intercourse with Drusilla in an act of necrophilia.

<doc id="787906" wikidata="Q634213" url="?curid=787906" title="Ford Consul Classic">
<text>The Ford Consul Classic is a mid-sized car that was launched in May 1961 and built by Ford UK from 1961 to 1963. It was available in two or four door saloon form, in Standard or De Luxe versions, and with floor or column gearshift. The name Ford Consul 315 was used for export markets. The Ford Consul Capri was a 2-door coupé version of the Classic, and was available from 1961 until 1964.

The four-cylinder pre-crossflow Kent engine was replaced in August 1962 by an over-square engine with a new five-bearing crankshaft and a new gearbox with synchromesh on all four forward ratios. Steering and suspension also received &quot;greased for life&quot; joints.

It is sometimes referred to as the Ford 109E, though that was only one of four such codes utilized for the Consul Classic, as explained below. Obvious competitor models at the time included the Hillman Minx and Singer Gazelle from Rootes Group.

==Ford Classic model codes==
The Classic (and related Consul Capri) had the right-hand-drive and home market Ford code of 109E (but 110E if L.H.D.) for 1961–1962 models with 1340cc engines, or 116E (but 117E for L.H.D.) for 1962–63 manufacture with 1500cc engines. Those codes also distinguish the gearboxes and steering components which are not greasable on later cars, so cutting first-user servicing costs.

Despite all these codes the cars all looked the same throughout production 1961–1963, the visual distinctions being the number of doors, the trim &amp; equipment level between Standard and De Luxe and the choice of colours.

==Concept and development==
The Classic was made by Ford to be &quot;suitable for the golf club car park&quot;, and was originally intended for introduction earlier and deletion later than actually occurred. The styling exercises were mainly undertaken in 1956 under Colin Neale. The main styling cues came straight from Dearborn (Michigan) as they often did, defining the car as a scaled-down Galaxie 500, from the waist down, topped with a Lincoln Continental roofline. Other aspects of R&amp;D followed, and it is likely that a recognisably similar car could have been introduced in 1959 subject to different senior management decisions. In practice the run-away early success of the Anglia (1959 on) used up most of the car manufacturing capacity at Dagenham, vindicating the decision to compete against the BMC Mini (the Halewood plant did not open until 1963). Ford therefore entered the 1960s with the small Anglia, Popular and Prefect, the big &quot;three graces&quot; (Consul, Zephyr and Zodiac) launched back in 1956, and not the mid-size market Classic.

==Description==
The Ford Classic was similar in appearance to the more popular Ford Anglia, featuring the same distinctive reverse-rake rear window. This feature was imported from the 1958 Lincoln Continental where it was necessitated by the design requirement for an opening (&quot;breezeway&quot;) rear window. With quad headlamps and different frontal treatment it was longer, wider and so heavier than the Anglia. In fact, from the windows down the body design was a scaled-down version of Ford&#x27;s large, US Ford Galaxie. Inside, the separate front seats and rear bench had a standard covering of PVC but leather was available as an option. There was a choice of floor-mounted or column-mounted gear change. Single or two-tone paint schemes were offered. Several of the car&#x27;s features, unusual at the time, have subsequently become mainstream such as the headlight flasher (&quot;found on many Continental cars&quot;) and the variable speed windscreen wipers. The boot or trunk capacity was exceptionally large, with a side-stowed spare-wheel well, and more importantly, the huge high-lift sprung lid allowed a great variety of loads to be both contemplated and packed. At 21 cubic feet, this was 15% larger than the Zodiac MK2 and had obvious advantages for business use.

The Consul Classic was also mechanically similar to the Anglia, and used slightly larger 1340 cc and, from 1962, 1498 cc, variants of the Ford Kent Engine. The car had front disc brakes and was fitted with a four-speed gearbox: early cars provided synchromesh on the top three ratios, while the arrival of the 1498 cc version coincided with the provision of synchromesh on all forward gears. Suspension was independent at the front using MacPherson struts, and at the rear the live axle used semi elliptic leaf springs. A contemporary road tester was impressed, noting that &quot;probably the most impressive thing about the Classic is its road holding&quot;.

==Performance==
A car tested by The Motor magazine in 1961 had a top speed of and could accelerate from 0- in 22.5 seconds. A fuel consumption of was recorded. The test car was a 4-door deluxe version costing £801 including taxes, but the sticker price on a two-door standard Classic with the same engine was just £745 including taxes.

==Replacement==
The Consul Classic was complex and expensive to produce and was replaced in October 1963 by the Ford Corsair which was largely based on Ford Cortina components. Only 111,225 Classics and 18,716 Capris were produced (Including 2002 &#x27;GT&#x27; Versions). These are small numbers by Ford standards, and probably indicative of the public not taking to the controversial styling along with the availability of the cheaper, similar-sized Cortina.

==Consul Capri==


The Consul Capri was a two-door coupé version of the Classic saloon made by Ford of Britain.

The Capri Project was code named &quot;Sunbird&quot; and took design elements from the Ford Thunderbird and the Ford Galaxie Sunliner. It was instigated by Sir Horace Denne, Ford&#x27;s Sales Export Director. He wanted a &quot;co-respondent&#x27;s&quot; car to add glamour to the product line. It was designed by Charles Thompson who worked under Colin Neale and had sweeping lines, a large boot space and a pillarless coupé roof.

On its September 1961 announcement, the Consul Capri was available for export only, but went on sale to the domestic British market in January 1962. The bodies were sub-assembled by Pressed Steel Company, with only final assembly of the drivetrain taking place at Dagenham and from February 1963 at Halewood. It was intended as part of the Ford Classic range of cars but the body was complex and expensive to produce. With new production methods, time demands from Dearborn and a need to match opposition manufacturers in price, the Ford Classic and Consul Capri were almost doomed from the start.

The Consul Capri was fitted with a variety of Ford Classic De-Luxe features, including four headlights, variable speed wipers, front disc brakes, dimming dashboard lights and a cigar lighter. The four-speed transmission was available with either a column or floor change. It was proclaimed as &quot;The First Personal car from Ford of Great Britain&quot; (Ford of Great Britain, sales literature, December 1961).

Initially fitted with a 1340 cc three-main-bearing engine (model 109E), the early cars were considered underpowered and suffered from premature crankshaft failure. Engine capacity was increased in August 1962 to 1498 cc (model 116E) and this engine with its new five-bearing crankshaft was an improvement. The first 200 Capris were left-hand-drive cars for export including Europe and North America. In Germany, at the 1961 Frankfurt Auto show, Ford sold 88 Capris.

In February 1963 a 2+2 GT version (also 116E) was announced. The new GT engine, developed by Cosworth, featured a raised compression ratio to 9:1, a modified head with larger exhaust valves, an aluminium inlet manifold, a four branch exhaust manifold and, most noticeably, a twin-choke Weber carburettor – this being the first use of this make on a British production car. The same engine was announced for use in the Ford Cortina in April 1963. The Consul Capri was the first Ford to use &quot;GT&quot;(76CV DIN/83CV SAE) as a model derivative worldwide.

Overall the car was very expensive to produce and in the latter part of its production was running alongside the very popular Ford Cortina. Sales were disappointing and the Consul Capri was removed from sale after two and a half years with 19,421 sold, of which 2002 were GT models. 1007 cars were sold in 1964, the last year of production, 412 of them being GTs. The Consul Capri was discontinued in July 1964. The Consul Capri (335) is one of the rarest cars from Ford of Great Britain.

A Capri was tested by the British The Motor magazine in 1962 and had a top speed of and could accelerate from 0- in 22.6 seconds. A fuel consumption of was recorded. The test car cost £915 including taxes of £288.

===New Zealand===
The Ford Consul Classic was sold in New Zealand as the Ford Consul 315, in line with other export markets, and was assembled from Knock-down kits at the Ford New Zealand assembly plant in Petone, Lower Hutt, North Island. Ford New Zealand imported all Ford Consul Capris fully built up. The Petone plant had assembled Ford motor vehicles since 1936.

==Ford Classic revival==

In July 2012 the &quot;Ford Classic&quot; name returned when Ford India rebranded their &quot;Ford Fiesta Classic&quot; model - effectively a Ford Fiesta Mark V with a boot/trunk - as the &quot;Ford Classic&quot;.

<doc id="787910" wikidata="Q220991" url="?curid=787910" title="Girija Prasad Koirala">
<text>Nepal Ratna Girija Prasad Koirala ( ; 4 July 1924 – 20 March 2010), affectionately known as Girija Babu, was a Nepalese politician. He headed the Nepali Congress and served as the Prime Minister of Nepal on four occasions: from 1991 to 1994, 1998 to 1999, 2000 to 2001, and 2006 to 2008. He was the Acting Head of State of Nepal between January 2007 and July 2008 as the country transitioned from a monarchy to a republic.

Koirala, who was active in politics for over sixty years, was a pioneer of the Nepalese labour movement, having started the first political workers&#x27; movement on Nepalese soil, known as the Biratnagar jute mill strike in his hometown, Biratnagar. In 1991 he became the first democratically elected prime minister in Nepal since 1959, when his brother B.P. Koirala and the Nepali Congress party were swept into power in the country&#x27;s first democratic election. He was the most prominent and consequential political leader in Nepal from 2001 to 2008.

==Personal life==

Koirala was born in Saharsa, Bihar, British India, in 1924 into a Hill Brahmin family. His father, Krishna Prasad Koirala, was a Nepali living in exile. In 1952 Koirala married Sushma Koirala, headmistress at the local school for women in Biratnagar. Their daughter Sujata Koirala was born in 1953. Sushma died in a kerosene-stove explosion in 1967. He along with his daughter Sujata were followers of the Indian spiritual leader Sathya Sai Baba.

Girija Prasad Koirala belonged to one of Nepal&#x27;s most prominent political families. Two of his brothers were prime ministers: Matrika Prasad Koirala from 1951 to 1952 and 1953 to 1955, and Bisheshwar Prasad Koirala from 1959 until King Mahendra took over the government in December 1960. Bisheshwar Prasad and Girija Prasad were arrested and sent to prison. With other leaders of the Nepali Congress Party (NCP), Girija Prasad went into exile after his release in 1967 and did not return to Nepal until 1979.

==Political career==
Koirala became involved in politics in 1947, leading the Biratnagar jute mill strike. In 1948 Koirala founded the Nepal Mazdoor Congress, later known as the Nepal Trade Union Congress-Independent. Later, in 1952, he became the President of the Morang District Nepali Congress and held that office until he was arrested and imprisoned by King Mahendra following the 1960 royal coup. Upon his release in 1967, Koirala, along with other leaders and workers of the party, was exiled to India until his return to Nepal in 1979. Koirala was General Secretary of the Nepali Congress Party from 1975 to 1991. Koirala was actively involved in the 1990 Jana Andolan which led to the abrogation of Panchayat rule and the introduction of multiparty politics into the country. 

===First term===

In Nepal&#x27;s first multiparty democratic election in 1991, Koirala was elected as a member of parliament from the Morang-1 and Sunsari-5 constituencies. The Nepali Congress won 110 of the 205 seats in the Pratinidhi Sabha (House of Representatives), the lower house of parliament. He was subsequently elected as the leader of the Nepali Congress parliamentary party and was appointed as prime minister by King Birendra.

During his first term, the House of Representatives enacted legislation to liberalize education, media and health sectors in the country. The government also founded the Purbanchal University and the B.P. Koirala Institute of Health Sciences(BPKIHS) in the Eastern Development Region and granted licenses to the private sector to run medical and engineering colleges in various parts of the country. The government also undertook the construction of the B.P. Koirala Memorial Cancer Hospital in Bharatpur, Nepal with assistance from the government of China. 

In November 1994, he called for a dissolution of parliament and general elections after a procedural defeat on the floor of the House when 36 members of parliament (MPs) of his party went against a government-sponsored vote of confidence. This led to the Communist Party of Nepal (Unified Marxist–Leninist)-led coalition coming to power in the elections that followed.

===Second and third term===

Koirala took over as prime minister from Surya Bahadur Thapa following the collapse of the coalition government led by Thapa. Koirala first headed a Nepali Congress minority government until 25 December 1998, after which he headed a three-party coalition government with the Communist Party of Nepal (UML) and the Nepal Sadbhawana Party. 

===Fourth term===
Koirala became prime minister in 2000 for his third term following the resignation of Krishna Prasad Bhattarai, under whose leadership the Nepali Congress Party had won the parliamentary election. The party had won claiming that Krishna Prasad Bhattarai would be the Prime Minister, but Koirala led a group of dissident MPs and forced Bhattarai to resign or face a no-confidence motion. At that time Nepal was fighting a civil war against the Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist). Koirala resigned in July 2001 after which the military was mobilized in the civil war for the first time, something Koirala had unsuccessfully attempted to do while in office. He was replaced by former prime minister Sher Bahadur Deuba, who was elected by a majority of members of the Nepal.

===Fifth term===

After the Loktantra Andolan and the reinstatement of the Nepal House of Representatives, Pratinidhi Sabha, on 24 April 2006, Koirala was selected to become prime minister by the leaders of the Seven Party Alliance. The reinstated House of Representatives passed laws to strip the King of his powers and bring the Army under civilian control. Following the promulgation of the interim constitution, Koirala, as the Prime Minister, became the interim head of state of Nepal.

===Interim term===

On 1 April 2007, Koirala was re-elected as prime minister to head a new government composed of the SPA and the CPN (Maoist). Following the April 2008 Constituent Assembly election, the Constituent Assembly voted to declare Nepal a republic on 28 May 2008. Koirala, speaking to the Constituent Assembly shortly before the vote, said that &quot;we have a big responsibility now&quot;; he said that Nepal was entering a &quot;new era&quot; and that &quot;the nation&#x27;s dream has come true&quot;.

In the discussions on power-sharing that followed the declaration of a republic, the Nepali Congress proposed that Koirala become the first President of Nepal; however, the CPN (Maoist), which had emerged as the strongest party in the Constituent Assembly election, opposed this.

At a meeting of the Constituent Assembly on 26 June 2008, Koirala announced his resignation, although it would not be finalized until after the election of a president, to whom the resignation had to be submitted.

Koirala was present for the swearing in of Ram Baran Yadav, the first president of Nepal, on 23 July 2008. He submitted his resignation to Yadav later on the same day. CPN (M) Chairman Prachanda was elected by the Constituent Assembly to succeed Koirala on 15 August 2008; Koirala congratulated Prachanda on this occasion.

===Later activity===
Towards the end of his life, Koirala was leading a democratic front composed of parties that supported and promoted liberal democratic principles and aspired to establishment of a long-term democratic form of governance in Nepal.

Koirala wrote &quot;Simple Convictions: My Struggle for Peace and Democracy&quot;.

==Death==

Koirala died at his daughter&#x27;s home on 20 March 2010 at the age of 85, having suffered from asthma and pulmonary disease. His funeral was held at Pashupatinath Temple in Kathmandu on 21 March. Upon receiving news of his death, numerous politicians released statements of condolence. &quot;The Hindu&quot; described him as a &quot;national guardian&quot;. Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh released a statement expressing his condolences, saying &quot;Koirala was a mass leader and a statesman, whose knowledge and wisdom guided the polity of Nepal in the right direction at critical junctures in the country&#x27;s history,&quot; while Ban Ki-moon, Secretary-General of the United Nations said &quot;Koirala fought fearlessly and at considerable personal sacrifice for justice and democratic rights in his country&quot; and senior Maoist politician Baburam Bhattarai said &quot;Koirala will be very much missed, especially now that the country is nearing the end of the peace process that he facilitated&quot;.

==Awards==
In 2015, he was posthumously awarded with Nepal Ratna Man Padavi, the highest honour to a Nepali citizen by the Government of Nepal.

<text>The Olza (, ) is a river in the Czech Republic and Poland, a right tributary of the Oder River. It flows through the Silesian Voivodeship in Poland and through the Moravian-Silesian Region in the Czech Republic. It is long. The river forms a significant part of the Czech-Polish state border.

==Etymology==
The name is derived from the Proto-Slavic word &quot;oliga&quot;, meaning &quot;a river rich in water&quot;. The origin of the name was demonstrated in 1900 by Czech linguist and writer Vincenc Prasek and the revelation was confirmed by various etymological studies in the 20th century. There was also a theory that the name is a derivative of the Germanic &quot;Aliza&quot;, meaning &#x27;flow&#x27;.

The oldest written mention of the Olza is in a letter written by Duke Mieszko in 1290. The river was then mentioned in a written document in 1611 as the &quot;Oldza&quot;. At the end of the 19th century, with the rise of mass nationalism, both Polish and Czech activists claimed the name &quot;Olza&quot; to be not Polish enough, on the one hand, and insufficiently Czech, on the other.

Local people always used the &quot;Olza&quot; name, regardless of their national or ethnic origin. However, the central administration in Prague saw &quot;Olza&quot; as a Polish name and when most of the river became a part of Czechoslovakia in 1920, it tried to change its name to the Czech form, &quot;Olše&quot;. However, a degree of dualism in the naming persisted until the 1960s, when the Central State Administration of Geodesy and Cartography ruled that the only official form in the Czech Republic was &quot;Olše&quot;. This modern Czech name literally means &#x27;alder&#x27; in Czech.

==Characteristic==

The Olza originates in the territory of Gmina Istebna in the Silesian Beskids at an elevation of and flows to the Czech-Polish border in Bohumín/Gorzyce, where it merges with the Oder River at an elevation of . Its drainage basin has an area of , of which is in the Czech Republic. The average discharge at its mouth is .

The Olza forms two sections of the Czech-Polish state border with a total length of . Length figures vary by source. According to the newest official measurements, the Czech part of the river (including the Czech-Polish state border) is long. The length of the Polish section of the river to the first crossing of the state border is usually stated as , which means that according to the latest measurements, the river has a total length of . However, based on older measurements, the total length of the river is stated as , or even .

The longest tributaries of the Olza are:
==Course==
The river flows through the territory of Istebna in Poland, then crosses the Czech- Polish border and flows through territories of Bukovec, Písek, Jablunkov, Návsí, Hrádek, Bystřice, Vendryně, Třinec and Český Těšín. Here it begins to form the state border with Cieszyn, Pogwizdów and Kaczyce on the Polish side and Chotěbuz on the Czech side. The river then continues through the territories of Karviná, Dětmarovice and Petrovice u Karviné before it begins to form the state border again, which lasts until its mouth. In this section, it flows along the territories of Godów and Gorzyce in Poland and Dolní Lutyně and Bohumín in the Czech Republic.

==Bodies of water==
There are 690 bodies of water in the Czech part of the basin area. The largest of them is the Těrlicko Reservoir with an area of , built on the Stonávka.

==Culture==
The river is a symbol of the Trans-Olza region, which lies on its west bank, constituting a part of the western half of the historical region of Cieszyn Silesia. The river is depicted in the words of the unofficial anthem of this region and of local Poles, &quot;Płyniesz Olzo po dolinie&quot; (&quot;Thou flowest, Olza, down the valley&quot;), written by Jan Kubisz.

==Fauna==
Protected animals that live in the river include the brook lamprey, schneider, European bullhead and alpine bullhead. River trout and grayling are commonly found in the river. Protected animals that live on the river banks include the Eurasian otter and common kingfisher.

==Tourism==
The Olza is suitable for river tourism. The river is navigable for most of the year. Most of the river is suitable even for less experienced paddlers.

<text>Rila (, ) is the highest mountain range of Bulgaria, the Balkan Peninsula, and Southeast Europe. It is situated in southwestern Bulgaria and forms part of the Rila–Rhodope Massif. The highest summit is Musala at an elevation of 2,925 m which makes Rila the sixth highest mountain range in Europe after the Caucasus, the Alps, Sierra Nevada, the Pyrenees and Mount Etna, and the highest one between the Alps and the Caucasus. It spans a territory of 2,629 km2 with an average elevation of 1487 m. The mountain is believed to have been named after the river of the same name, which comes from the Old Bulgarian verb &quot;рыти&quot; meaning &quot;to grub&quot;.

Rila has abundant water resources. Some of the Balkans&#x27; longest and deepest rivers originate from Rila, including the Maritsa, Iskar and Mesta rivers. Bulgaria&#x27;s main water divide separating the Black Sea and the Aegean Sea drainage systems follows the main ridge of Rila. The mountain range is dotted with almost 200 glacial lakes such as the renowned Seven Rila Lakes, and is rich in hot springs in the fault areas at the foothills, including the hottest spring in South-eastern Europe in Sapareva Banya.

The mountain range has varied flora and fauna with a number of endemic and relict species and some of the best preserved forests in the country. The biodiversity and the pristine landscapes are protected by Rila National Park which covers much of the mountain; the rest lies within Rila Monastery Nature Park. In addition, there are five nature reserves: Parangalitsa, Central Rila Reserve, Rila Monastery Forest, Ibar and Skakavitsa.

The most recognisable landmark of the mountain range is the Rila Monastery, Bulgaria&#x27;s largest and most important monastery, founded in the 10th century by Saint John of Rila. Due to its outstanding cultural and spiritual value it was declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1983. Rila is also a popular destination for hiking, winter sports and spa tourism, hosting the nation&#x27;s oldest ski resort Borovets, as well as numerous hiking trails. Some of the most important hydro power stations in Bulgaria are situated in the eastern part of the mountain range, including the Belmeken–Sestrimo–Chaira Hydropower Cascade (1,599 MW), the largest and most complex hydroelectric complex in Bulgaria.

== Geography ==

=== Overview ===
Rila is a mountain range in south-western Bulgaria, part of the Rila–Rhodope Massif. It is situated between five valleys – Dupnitsa Valley to the north-west, Samokov Valley to the north, Kostenets–Dolna Banya Valley to the north-east, Razlog Valley to the south and Blagoevgrad Valley to the south-west. Five saddles link Rila to the surrounding mountain ranges – Klisura Saddle (1,025 m) with Verila to the north-west, Borovets Saddle (1,305 m) with Sredna Gora to the north, Yundola (1,375 m) and Avramovo Saddles (1,295 m) with the Rhodope Mountains to the south-east and Predel Saddle (1,140 m) with Pirin to the south. Within these limits Rila spans an area of 2,629 km2 and has an average elevation of 1,487 m. The high elevation zone over 1,600 m forms about 50% of the total territory. There are over 140 main peaks above 2,000 m.

With an elevation of 2,925 m at Musala, Rila is the highest mountain range in Bulgaria and the Balkan Peninsula, and the sixth highest in Europe after the Caucasus, the Alps, Sierra Nevada, the Pyrenees and Mount Etna. Musala is the fourth most isolated peak in continental Europe after Mont Blanc, Mount Elbrus and Galdhøpiggen raising at a distance of 810 km from the nearest point of the same elevation. With a prominence of 2,473 m, Musala ranks seventh among Europe&#x27;s ultra-prominent peaks.

=== Division ===
The mountain range is divided into four distinct parts. East Rila, known also as Musala Rila, is the largest and highest subdivision, situated between the valleys of the rivers Beli Iskar and Belishka. It is formed of two main ridges. The Musala Ridge spans in north–south direction between the valleys of Beli Iskar and Maritsa; the Ibar Ridge runs in west–east direction from the summit of Marishki Chal to the Avramovo Saddle. It covers 37% of the mountain&#x27;s territory and contains the highest summit in the range — Musala (2,925 m), as well as 12 of the 18 summits over 2,700 m — Irechek (2,852 m), Deno (2,790 m), Mancho (2,771 m) and others; there are 46 peaks over 2,100 m. East Rila contains a number of glacial lake groups, including Musala Lakes and Marichini Lakes, as well as the nation&#x27;s largest ski resort Borovets. 

Central Rila, known also as Skakavitsa Rila, is the smallest subdivision, covering 9% of the total area of Rila but has the most Alpine character and the highest average elevation — 2,077 m. It stretches between the valleys of the rivers Beli Iskar, Cherni Iskar, Levi Iskar, Iliyna and Rilska. The later divides the two main ridges in Central Rila, Skakavitsa and Rilets. The highest summit is Cherna Polyana (2,716 m); other important peaks are Skalata, Small and Big Skakavets, Rilets; there are 28 peaks over 2,100 m. This subdivision is renowned mainly for the glacial lakes Ribni, Dzhendemski, Manastirski, as well as the largest glacial lake in the Balkan Peninsula — Smradlivo Lake.

Northwest Rila, known also as Malyovitsa Rila, occupies about 24% of Rila and is situated between the valleys of Rilska to the south, Levi Iskar to the east, Samokov to the north-east and Dupnitsa to the west. Its much lower northern section is called Lakatitska Rila. It is linked with the Verila mountain range to the north through the Klisura Saddle, and with Central Rila to the east through the Kobilino Branishte saddle. The average elevation is 1,556 m; the highest summit is Mount Golyiam Kupen at an elevation of 2731 m. There are 29 peaks over 2,100 m. This subdivision is known for its rugged peaks and picturesque lakes in the Alpine zone that include the Seven Rila Lakes and the Urdini Lakes. Central Rila includes the mountain&#x27;s highest waterfall, Skakavitsa (70 m).

Southwest Rila stretches between the valleys of the Rilska, Iliyna and Belishka rivers to the north, the Predel Saddle that separates it from Pirin to the south, and Simitli and Blagoevgrad valleys to the west. It covers about 30% of the area of the mountain range. With an average elevation of 1,307 m, it has the lowest elevation in Rila. The highest summit is Angelov Peak (2,643 m). The Blagoevgradska Bistritsa River divides it in two distinct ridges to the north and to the south. Apart from its northernmost part, Southwest Rila does not have the Alpine character of the other three subdivisions. The biosphere reserve Parangalitsa is situated there.

== Geology, relief and summits ==

Rila is a fault-block mountain and represents a crescent-shaped horst with two fault systems — concentric and radial. It is part of the oldest land in the Balkans, the Macedonian–Thracian Massif. The mountain range is formed mainly by metamorphic and intrusive rocks. The core of Rila is built up predominantly by granite. It is covered by a thick layer of crystalline schists and granite–gneiss; this layer is topped by sandstones and conglomerates which were formed by elevated Tertiary sediments. Traces of these sediments are found in the Northwest Rila at an elevation of up to 1,900 m. The highest zones are made mainly of granite, and below are crystalline schists, whose compound minerals are sequentially deposited. They are represented by gneiss, mica schists, and amphibolite. In many places granite passes into granite–gneiss. There are marbles and amphibolites formed in the Paleozoic over 250 million years ago and subsequently elevated during the Tertiary period. The coarse–grained granites are the dominant rocks forming almost two–thirds of the area of the Rila&#x27;s higher parts.

Rila was subjected to glaciation during the Pliocene and the Pleistocene. Its modern Alpine relief was formed during the last Würm glaciation some 10–12 000 years ago, when the snowline of the mountain was 2,100–2,200 m. The glaciers reached elevations as low as 1,200 m. Above this boundary, the glaciers radically altered the existing relief, forming deep cirques, pyramidal peaks, steep cliffs, long U-shaped valleys, moraine fields and other glacial forms. On the slopes of some valleys such as those of the rivers Beli Iskar, Maritsa and Rilska there are hanging glacier valleys — tributary valleys located higher than the main ones. The bottom of cirques are often occupied by glacial lakes. As a result of the weathering, scree formations of varied nature have been accumulated. In the south-western foothills of Rila the Stob Earth Pyramids were formed under the influence of erosion.

The staged elevation of the mountain during the geological eras and the large range of vertical folds have led to the formation of four denudation levels of distinct age, height and range. The oldest Early Miocene level encompasses the highest sections of the mountain with an elevation between 2,800 and 2,400 m. It represents practically leveled terrain with gently folded surface, formed in the place of ancient forest massifs. The next Late Miocene level, the young Miocene, is situated on the main side ridges with an elevation between 2,600 and 2,300 m. The third level formed during the Early Pliocene has an elevation of 1,800 and 1,600 m. The Late Pliocene level occupies areas with an elevation of up to 1,300 m.

There are two summits above 2,900 m, Musala and Malka Musala. Some of the highest peaks are:

== Climate ==
Rila is situated in the southern zone of the humid continental climate region and has typical Alpine climate with elevational zones. The climate is influenced by the Icelandic and the West Mediterranean cyclones, the former mainly in late spring and early summer, and the latter — in winter, bringing frequent and high rainfall, as well as by the Azores and Siberian anticyclones in summer and winter, bringing droughts. The local microclimate is also influenced by the terrain, the exposure of the slopes and the orientation of the valleys. The average temperature decreases and the average precipitation increases with elevation. The coldest month is March and the hottest one August. Negative temperatures remain on average for about nine months in the Alpine zone, often continuing until the end of June. A steady rise in temperature is observed in the middle and end of July. Even during the summer months, temperature over 10 °C do not hold up for long periods. About five to ten days in June, July and August have an average temperature above 15 °C. This determines the short vegetation period in the high elevation areas which varies from three to six months; it lasts about three months at elevation over 2,000 m. The average annual temperature is 2.6 °C on the northern slopes and 3.1 °C on the southern. With an average annual temperature of −3.0 °C, Musala is the coldest place in Bulgaria. The lowest absolute temperature in Rila was also measured there: −31.2 °C; the lowest mean monthly temperature was recorded there in February: −11.6 °C. The absolute maximum temperature at Musala is 18.7 °C. Temperature amplitude decreases with elevation from 20 °C at 800 m to 15 °C at 2,800 m. Temperature inversions, i.e. increase in temperature with height, are frequent on the northern slopes and occur especially often in the Samokov Valley, Borovets and Musala, where it is observed in 250 days annually.

The annual precipitation varies with elevation and slope orientation. The annual precipitation is 653 mm at Samokov (1,029 m), 932 mm at Borovets (1,350 m) and 1200 mm at Musala (2,925 m); about 80% of it being snow at the later. The rainfall occurs mostly in summer and spring on the northern slopes, with maximum in June and minimum in February; the rainfall increases in winter and decreases in summer on the southern slopes and yet the monthly maximum and minimum are the same; there are 130–160 days with rainfall/snowfall. Air humidity in the highlands of Rila ranges between 80 and 85%. The coldest winter months are also the driest. Humidity differs on the northern and southern slopes of Rila. The snow cover above 1,000 m begins to form on 10–15 December on the northern slopes and after 20–30 December on the southern. Its average monthly thickness reaches 20 to 30 cm in February at low elevations. In the Alpine zone above 2,000 m the snow cover is thickest in March, reaching 70 to 80 cm. In the highest ridges the maximum thickness reaches 200 to 240 cm. The snow cover remains for an average of 70–80 days at elevations of 1,200–1,300 m and 180 to 200 days at elevations above 2,000 m. Avalanches are frequent, often caused by temperature changes by the influx of warm Mediterranean air masses.

Winds may reach speed of 40–45 m/s (over 100 km/h) at the summits, with mostly south-western and western orientation. The north-west and north-east winds are more moderate. The average monthly wind speed on the highest mountain summits reaches 11–12 m/s. In the lower parts, the average monthly speed varies from 1.2 to 2.5 m/s and in the middle height zone it ranges from 2.5 to 3.2 m/s. Winds are usually strongest in winter and lightest in autumn. The annual duration of sunshine in the Alpine zone is 1930 hours with maximum in August and minimum in December–January; it raises to more than 2150 hours at 1,000 m.

== Hydrology ==

Rila is an important hydrological unit in Bulgaria with very high hydropower potential, representing about 1/4 of the total potential of the country. The water reserves that form within the mountain range are the most important source of clean potable water for the surrounding settlements, the national capital Sofia and part of the population of Northern Greece and European Turkey. The regime of the rivers of Rila is directly related to the elevation and about half of the water reserves in the mountain are at an elevation above 2,050 m. The main drainage divide in the Balkans separating the drainage basins of the Black Sea and the Aegean Sea passes through Rila&#x27;s northern ridge, including the summit of Musala. Some of the Balkans&#x27; longest rivers originate from Rila, including the Maritsa, Iskar and Mesta, as well as several important tributaries of the Struma — Rilska, Dzherman and Blagoevgradska Bistritsa. Of them, the Iskar and its tributaries belong to the Black Sea drainage basins, and all the rest — to the Aegean. About 78% of the water flows into the Aegean drainage system. The runoff comes from snowmelt in the Alpine zones and rainfall. Water discharge reaches its maximum in late spring and early summer with spring accounting for more than half of the total annual discharge. The maximum at the highest elevations is in summer due to the late snowmelt. The minimum is in autumn and winter. The largest waterfalls are Skakavitsa (70 m) and Goritsa (39 m). There are abundant mineral springs that include the hottest one in South-eastern Europe at Sapareva Banya forming a geyser with a temperature of 101.4 °C.

The cirques at the high elevation zone contain 189 glacial lakes; there are also about 30 smaller ones that evaporate in summer, including tectonic lakes like Panichishte. Their location is closely linked to the snowline during the last glacial period and most of them lie at elevations between 2,100 m and 2,500 m. Most lakes (28) are situated at elevations between 2,300 m and 2,350 m; there are 23 between 2,350 m and 2,400 m, 19 between 2,250 m and 2,300 m and 19 between 2,400 m and 2,450 m. Their length varies between 800 m and 20 m, the width — between 375 m and 10 m, the area — between 1 m and 212 decares, the depth — between 0.5 m and 37.5 m. Most of them are between 2 m and 10 m deep and four reach depth of over 20 m. The water is transparent as deep as 15 m. Most of the lakes are covered with ice during most of the year — from October to June. The ice thickness reaches 3 m in the highest lakes. The largest glacial lake in Rila and in the Balkans is Smradlivo with an area of 212 decares; the longest is the Upper Ribno Lake reaching 801 m; the deepest is Okoto, one of the Seven Rila Lakes with a depth of 37.5 m; the highest is Ledeno at an elevation of 2,709 m; the lowest is Suho at 2,045 m. The most important lake groups are the Seven Rila Lakes (seven lakes), Musala Lakes (seven), Marichini Lakes (seven), Urdini Lakes (six), Malyovishki Lakes (three), Elenski Lakes (three), Chanakgyolski Lakes (two), Vapski Lakes (two), etc.

== Nature ==

The vegetation is determined by the elevation. At the lowest portions there are xerothermal oak forests dominated by Hungarian oak (&quot;Quercus frainetto&quot;), pubescent oak (&quot;Quercus pubescens&quot;) and Austrian oak (&quot;Quercus cerris&quot;) with some Mediterranean cenosis of cade juniper (&quot;Juniperus oxycedrus&quot;) and scorpion senna (&quot;Hippocrepis emerus&quot;). Higher in the mountain up to 1,300 m the deciduous forests are primarily of sessile oak (&quot;Quercus petraea&quot;) with smaller participation of European hop-hornbeam (&quot;Ostrya carpinifolia&quot;), common hornbean (&quot;Carpinus betulus&quot;), Heldreich&#x27;s maple (&quot;Acer heldreichii&quot;), Balkan maple (&quot;Acer hyrcanum&quot;) and European ash (&quot;Fraxinus excelsior&quot;); the zone between 1,300 m and 1,600 m is dominated by European beech (&quot;Fagus sylvatica&quot;), at places mixed with European silver fir (&quot;Abies alba&quot;). The endemic Rila oak (&quot;Quercus protoroburoides&quot;) inhabits only the Rilska River valley. The forests of coniferous zone between 1,600 m and 2,100 m consist of primarily of Norway spruce (&quot;Picea abies&quot;), Macedonian pine (&quot;Pinus peuce&quot;) и Scots pine (&quot;Pinus sylvestris&quot;). The sub-Alpine zone up to 2,500 m is covered by dwarf mountain pine (&quot;Pinus mugo&quot;) and common juniper (&quot;Juniperus communis&quot;) formations mixed with green alder (&quot;Alnus viridis&quot;) at wetter localities and &quot;Rhododendron myrtifolium&quot; in East Rila. The alpine line is covered with grass, moss, lichen, rare flowers, dwarf willows such as &quot;Salix herbacea&quot;, &quot;Salix retusa&quot; and &quot;Salix reticulata&quot;, etc. Due to the difficult terrain, the forests of Rila are not much influenced by anthropogenic activities and their average age is above 100 years. Some Norway spruces and European silver firs reach height of 60 m.

The number of vascular plants includes about 1400 species registered only within the territory of Rila National Park, of them 34 are endemic to Bulgaria, including three restricted to Rila, and 89 — to the Balkans; 31 are Tertiary or pre-glacial relicts and 104 are glacial relicts. Notable Bulgarian endemic species include Rila primrose (&quot;Primula deorum&quot;) and rhapontic rhubarb (&quot;Rheum rhaponticum&quot;); taxa restricted to the Balkans include Bulgarian avens (&quot;Geum bulgaricum&quot;), yellow columbine (&quot;Aquilegia aurea&quot;), Bulgarian gentian (&quot;Gentianella bulgarica&quot;), Balkanian butterwort (&quot;Pinguicula balcanica&quot;), &quot;Crocus veluchensis&quot;, &quot;Dianthus microlepis&quot;, etc. The non-vascular flora includes 974 algae, 313 moss and 251 lichen species. The fungi are represented by 665 species, including 64 mushrooms listed in the Red Book of Bulgaria.

The mammal species within Rila National Park and its surroundings are 62 and include taxa of high conservation value, such as brown bear, gray wolf, wildcat, least weasel, European pine marten, marbled polecat, wild boar, red deer, roe deer, chamois, European ground squirrel, as well as the glacial relict European snow vole. The bird species are 156; of the 120 are nesting within Rila National Park. These include three relicts — boreal owl, Eurasian pygmy owl and Eurasian three-toed woodpecker, and species that require special conservation measures like short-toed snake eagle, golden eagle, peregrine falcon, black stork, Eurasian woodcock, western capercaillie, hazel grouse, rock partridge, grey-headed woodpecker, black woodpecker, white-throated dipper, wallcreeper and Alpine chough among others. There are 18 reptile, 10 amphibian and 12 fish species. The invertebrate fauna discovered so far includes 4186 species and is expected to rise to over 7000; of them 34 are endemic to Rila, 123 — to Bulgaria and another 123 — to the Balkans.

The biodiversity, ecosystems and the pristine landscapes are protected by Rila National Park declared in 1992, which is Bulgaria&#x27;s largest spanning a territory of 810.46 km2, and Rila Monastery Nature Park covering another 252.535 km2. There are four nature reserves in the former — Parangalitsa, Central Rila Reserve, Ibar and Skakavitsa, and another one, Rila Monastery Forest, in the latter. Parangalitsa was declared a UNESCO Biosphere Reserve in 1977, while the Central Rila Reserve is the largest one in the Balkans with an area of 123.937 km2.

== Settlements, transportation and economy ==

Rila is a sparsely populated mountain range with most of the settlements located in the valleys at the foothills, inhabited by c. 250,000 people. Administratively it falls in four of Bulgaria&#x27;s 28 provinces: Blagoevgrad, Kyustendil, Sofia and Pazardzhik. From west to east there are five towns at the northern foothills — Sapareva Banya (pop. 3,815 as of 2016), Samokov (25,880), Dolna Banya (4,510), Kostenets (6,228) and Belovo (3,533); there are four towns at the western foothills (from north to south) — Dupnitsa (35,255), Rila (2,359), Kocherinovo (1,723) and Blagoevgrad (66,886); as well as three more at the south-eastern foothills (from west to east) — Razlog (12,036), Belitsa (2,964) and Yakoruda (5,288). There are a number of villages, including among others Govedartsi, Belchin, Madzhare, Kostenets, Pastra, Stob, Barakovo, Dobarsko, etc. Some of the settlements on the Rila include a small Aromanian minority.

The mountain range is served by several roads running along its foothills. No roads traverse the massif. In the west along the Struma Valley runs Struma motorway paralleled by the first class I-1 road, both part of European route E79, that connect the national capital Sofia and Greece via the provincial centre Blagoevgrad. The second class II-62 road branches off I-1 at Dupnitsa and runs east to Samokov where it joins the second class II-82 road which continues in eastern direction until the town of Kostenets, where it joins the first class I-8 road, part of European route E80. The second class II-19 road which branches off I-1 at Simitli, goes east crossing the Predel Saddle into the Razlog Valley and at the homonymous town links with the second class II-84 road which runs in north-eastern direction along the Avramovo Saddle and links with the I-8 road/E80 near Pazardzhik. Rila is served by the Bulgarian State Railways via railway line No. 1 in the north-east with stations at Kostenets and Belovo, railway line No. 5 along the Struma Valley in the west and the Septemvri–Dobrinishte narrow-gauge line in the south-east.

The most important sectors of the local economy are tourism, services, industry and agriculture. The abundant water resources are utilised by some of Bulgaria&#x27;s largest hydro power plants, the most important of them being fueled by the Belmeken Dam in East Rila — Chaira Pumped Storage Hydro Power Plant (864 MW), Belmeken Pumped Storage Hydro Power Plant (375 MW), Sestrimo Hydro Power Plant (240 MW) and Momina Klisura Hydroelectric Power Station (120 MW). Chaira is the largest pumped storage HPP in South-eastern Europe. They form the Belmeken–Sestrimo–Chaira Hydropower Cascade, the biggest and most complex hydroelectric complex in Bulgaria, with a combined installed capacity of 1,599 MW. At an elevation of 1,900 m is located the second biggest reservoir in Rila, Beli Iskar, constructed between 1939 and 1945, that provides 25% of Sofia&#x27;s potable water and powers a small 16 MW hydro power station. At an elevation of 2,394 m, Kalin is the highest reservoir in the Balkans. Rila accounts for 6% of Bulgaria&#x27;s timber resources. Manufacturing industry is centred in Blagoevgrad, Dupnitsa, Samokov, Razlog and Belovo; the main sectors are food processing, machine building, pharmaceutical and paper mills.

== Tourism ==

Rila is a popular tourist destination for winter sports, spa tourism, recreation and cultural tourism. Borovets, situated on the northern slopes at 9 km from Samokov, is the oldest winter resort in Bulgaria and the largest one in Rila. It has 27 marked ski runs with a total length of 58 km equipped with 12 lifts facilities and provides conditions for alpine skiing, cross-country skiing, night skiing, biathlon, snowboard, etc.; it has hosted competitions in the FIS Alpine Ski World Cup and the Biathlon World Championships 1993. The top elevation is 2,560 m while the lowest is 1,300 m. Over 36,000 foreign tourists have stayed in Borovets for the 2016/17 winter season spending an average of five nights. Other much smaller ski resorts include Panichishte with several ski runs, Semkovo with seven ski runs totaling 4 km, Bodrost with 5 km ski runs and Govedartsi with a single 1.7 km ski run. The Balmeken High Mountain Sports Complex is located at an elevation of 2,050 m in East Rila and is used for training, medical and biological research by athletes but also provides opportunities for family recreation.

The mountain range was a favourite place of retreat for the Bulgarian monarchs Ferdinand I (r. 1887–1918) and his son Boris III (r. 1918–1943). The palace of Tsarska Bistritsa was constructed between 1898 and 1914 above Borovets in the traditional Bulgarian National Revival style with several edifices and a park. Its 170 kW hydroelectric generator installed in 1912 is still working unaltered. Two other hunting lodges were constructed for the monarchs — Sitnyakovo and Saragyol. There are 17 mountains refuges with a total of 1938 beds. There are 198 km primary and 363 km secondary hiking trails in Rila National Park, including E4 European long distance path that traverses it from west to south and E8 European long distance path that traverses it from north-west to south. Rila National Park was visited by about 100,000 tourists annually for the period 2000–2014 reaching a peak of 268,000 in 2012, while with a little more than 1 million visitors Rila Monastery Nature Park is the second most visited one in the country, after Vitosha. In 2000 on the south-western slopes was established the Dancing Bears Park Belitsa that shelters all dancing bears from Bulgaria following the ban of that practice, as well as individuals from Albania and Serbia.

The abundant mineral springs along the fault lines along the northern foothills of Rila favour health and spa tourism. The most significant spa resorts from west to east are Sapareva Banya with a total discharge of 33 L/sec and temperature of 33–101.4 °C, Belchinski Bani with a total discharge of 24 L/sec and temperature of 40–41.5 °C, Dolna Banya with a total discharge of 22 L/sec and temperature of 56.3 °C and the village of Kostenets with a total discharge of 12 L/sec and temperature of 46–73 °C.

Rila has well developed cultural tourism and contains five of the 100 Tourist Sites of Bulgaria — the Church of Theodore Tyro and Theodore Stratelates in the village of Dobarsko, the Rila Monastery and the Stob Earth Pyramids, the Seven Rila Lakes, the museum of history and the convent in the town of Samokov, and the summit of Musala. Rila Monastery is the most important architectural monument in the mountain range. It is situated at an elevation of 1,147 m and was declared a UNESCO&#x27;s world heritage site in 1983. The Monastery is considered to be a cultural and spiritual centre of Bulgaria. With its architecture and frescos Rila Monastery represents a masterpiece of the creative genius of the Bulgarian people and has exerted considerable influence on architecture and aesthetics within the Balkan area. Established in the First Bulgarian Empire by the medieval Bulgarian hermit and saint John of Rila during the reign of emperor Peter I of Bulgaria (r. 927–969), the monastery developed into one of the main cradles of Bulgarian culture, literature and spirituality. In the 18th century it became one of the main hubs of the Bulgarian National Revival. The complex covers an area of 8,800 m2 and consists of a five-domed church, a defensive tower and monastic apartments encircling an inner yard. The exterior of the complex resembles a fortress with its high stone walls and little windows. The oldest surviving structure is the 23 m high Hrelyo&#x27;s Tower, constructed in 1334–1335.

The Church of Theodore Tyro and Theodore Stratelates in Dobarsko at an elevation of about 1,000 m is a small three-naved stone basilica half dug into the ground, constructed in 1614 and painted in 1672. The church is noted for its abundance of original frescoes and icons. The Church of Saint Nicholas in Sapareva Banya is small medieval edifice, constructed anytime from the 11th to the 14th century. It was built using red bricks and white mortar and is of a simple cross-in-square design, with a single nave and apse. The town of Samokov achieved economic prosperity during the 17–19 centuries due to production of iron and has a number of monuments, including churches, a convent, a 17th-century Ottoman drinking fountain and a museum of history. Near Belchin is located the recently restored Tsari Mali Grad Fortress.

<text>The Philip Glass Ensemble is an American musical group founded by composer Philip Glass in 1968 to serve as a performance outlet for his experimental minimalist music. The ensemble continues to perform and record to this day, under the musical direction of keyboardist Michael Riesman.

The Ensemble&#x27;s instrumentation became a hallmark of Glass&#x27;s early minimalist style. While the ensemble&#x27;s instrumentation has varied over the years, it has generally consisted of amplified woodwinds (typically saxophones, flutes, and bass clarinet), keyboard synthesizers, and solo soprano voice (singing &quot;solfeggio&quot;). 

After Glass wrote his first opera, &quot;Einstein on the Beach&quot;, for the ensemble in 1976, he began to compose for other instrumentation more frequently, but he still retains the core ensemble instrumentation. 

In 2011, individuals from the ensemble performed a series of concerts in an installation at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in the Temple of Dendur exhibit. From 2012 until late 2015 the ensemble has presented, along with many other performers, a revival of &quot;Einstein on the Beach&quot; which opened in Montpellier, France in 2012. 

In 2013 the ensemble began to perform Glass&#x27;s opera, &quot;La Belle et la Bête&quot; again. The opera is set to the visuals of the 1946 Jean Cocteau film, with the help of four vocalists. In early September 2014 the ensemble performed with Steve Reich and other musicians at the Brooklyn Academy of Music&#x27;s &quot;Next Wave Festival.&quot; It had been over thirty years since Glass and Reich had shared a stage.

In February 2018, the ensemble performed with the San Francisco Girls Chorus at Carnegie Hall. They performed the ninety-minute &quot;Music With Changing Parts&quot;, the work&#x27;s debut performance with women&#x27;s chorus and an extremely important concert as this piece is considered to have changed music in the 1970s. Glass has also collaborated with them on their most recent album, Final Answer, and many of his works are featured in performance by SFGC (artistically directed by Ensemble vocalist and keyboardist Lisa Bielawa).

<doc id="787923" wikidata="Q726158" url="?curid=787923" title="Pirin">
<text>The Pirin Mountains ( ) are a mountain range in southwestern Bulgaria, with the highest peak, Vihren, at an altitude of .

The range extends about from the north-west to the south-east and is about wide, spanning a territory of . To the north, Pirin is separated from Bulgaria&#x27;s highest mountain range, the Rila Mountain, by the Predel saddle, while to the south it reaches the Slavyanka Mountain. To the west is located the valley of the river Struma and to the east the valley of the river Mesta separates it from the Rhodope Mountains. Pirin is dotted with more than a hundred glacial lakes and is also the home of Europe&#x27;s southernmost glaciers, Snezhnika and Banski Suhodol.

The northern part of the range, which is also the highest one, is protected by the Pirin National Park, declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1983. Pirin is noted for its rich flora and fauna, as well as for the presence of a number of relict species. Much of the area is forested, with some of the best preserved conifer woods in Bulgaria, holding important populations of the Balkan endemic species Macedonian pine, Bosnian pine and Bulgarian fir. Animals include many species of high conservation value, such as brown bear, gray wolf, wildcat, European pine marten, wild boar, red deer, roe deer, chamois, etc.

The combination of favourable natural conditions and varied historical heritage contribute makes Pirin an important tourist destination. The town of Bansko, situated on the north-eastern slopes of the mountain, has grown to be the primary ski and winter sports centre in the Balkans. A number of settlements at the foothills of Pirin have mineral spring and are spa resorts — Banya, Dobrinishte, Gotse Delchev, Sandanski, etc. Melnik at the south-western foothills of the mountain is Bulgaria&#x27;s smallest town and is an architectural reserve. Within a few kilometres from the town are the Melnik Earth Pyramids and the Rozhen Monastery.

The name of the mountain may, according to one hypothesis, derive from &quot;Perun&quot;, the highest god of the Slavic pantheon and the god of thunder and lightning. Another version is that the etymology of the range can be traced to the Thracian word &quot;Perinthos&quot;, meaning &quot;Rocky Mountain&quot;.

== Geography ==
=== Overview ===

Pirin is situated in south-western Bulgaria and is part of the Rila–Rhodope Massif. To the north, the Predel Saddle and mountain pass at altitude separates it from the Rila mountain range. To the east, Pirin borders the Razlog Valley, the valley of the river Mesta and the Momina Klisura Gorge that separate it from the Rhodope Mountains. To the south, the Paril Saddle () divides it from the Slavyanka mountain range. To the west, Pirin reaches the valley of the river Struma, including the Kresna Gorge and the Sandanski–Petrich Valley, that serve as a divide from the Vlahina, Maleshevo and Ograzhden mountains further to the west.

The main orographic ridge extends from the north-west to the south-east. Pirin spans an area of with an average height of . The maximum length between the Paril and Predel saddles is ; the maximum width is . Reaching an altitude of , Pirin is the second highest mountain range in Bulgaria after Rila () and the eighth highest in Europe after the Caucasus, the Alps, Sierra Nevada, the Pyrenees, Mount Etna, the aforementioned Rila, and Mount Olympus.

=== Division ===

Geologically and morphologically Pirin is divided into three parts: north, central and south, which differ sharply in size and altitude. North Pirin is the largest of the subdivisions and the mountain&#x27;s downright part. It takes up 74% of the whole range&#x27;s territory, being about long and ranging from Predel to the north to the Todorova Polyana Saddle () to the south. It is the most often visited part of the mountain, the only one to have an Alpine appearance, featuring many glacial lakes, resthouses and shelters. North Pirin is itself divided into two zones by the Kabata Saddle and the valleys of the Banderitsa and Vlahinska rivers. The northern zone consists of the steep marble Vihren ridge with the three highest summits in the range: Vihren (), Kutelo () and Banski Suhodol (). The marble ridge is narrow and very steep, reaching a width of only at the ridge Koncheto (). The southern zone is more massive and consists primarily of granite ridges, including Pirin&#x27;s fourth highest summit Polezhan, at . The southern zone also has marble ridges, such as the Sinanitsa ridge with its homonymous summit (). In total, the northern section of Pirin includes two summits with an altitude over , seven over , 13 over , and 60 over .

Central Pirin extends between the Todorova Polyana Saddle and the Popovi Livadi Saddle. It constitutes the smallest and the shortest of the three subdivisions, covering only 7% of Pirin&#x27;s total area. It is composed of crystalline schists and granite, as well as of marbled limestone in the south. Because of the karstic relief there are no lakes; the rivers springing up from Central Pirin are short and with low water volume. It is largely covered by deciduous forests. The highest peak is Orelyak (), while the other summits are under .

South Pirin stretches from the Popovi Livadi Saddle to the Paril Saddle and is the lowest and least rugged part. The highest peak is Ushite at , although Sveshtnik () had long been considered the highest summit. It constitutes 19% of the mountain&#x27;s territory. Despite being characterised with relatively flat ridges, its lateral slopes are steep. South Pirin is composed of granite with marbled limestone in the periphery. It lacks glacial forms and is covered with forests. Like Central Pirin, the springs are short and with low water discharge.

== Geology, relief and peaks in Pirin ==

Geologically Pirin is a horst forming a massive anticline situated between the complex graben valleys of the Struma and the Mesta, formed by metamorphic rocks — gneiss, biotite and crystalline schists, amphibolite, quartzite and marble. Granite rocks cover 62% of the mountain&#x27;s area. The tectonics of the Pirin is primarily the result of Precambrian, Hercynian, alpine and tectonic movements and events. Its hoisting alternated with long dormant periods. As a result of the activisation of the ancient Struma and Mesta faults during the Neogene and the Quaternary Pirin rose as a massive horst.

The modern relief of Pirin was shaped in the Pleistocene when the mountain was subjected to alpine glaciation related to the global cooling. This glaciation occurred in parallel with that of the Alps. The process formed pointed pyramidal peaks, long U-shaped valley, cirques, moraine fields and vertical cliffs that characterise Pirin&#x27;s contemporary appearance. These forms are most prominent at the north-eastern ridges of the mountain. Some lateral moraines may reach heights of more than . The lower line of the glaciers was at . Karst landforms also shape Pirin&#x27;s relief with ponors, swallow holes, caves, etc.

The main Pirin ridge is clearly distinguished; it begins in Rila and passes through the Predel saddle as far as the Paril saddle. It links the separate smaller ridges of the mountain into one system with the highest peaks situated on it. Although it curves a lot, its main direction is from the northwest to southeast and it is also a watershed between the Struma and the Mesta rivers. There are many spurs but four of them are so large that they create the appearance of the mountain: Sinanishko, Todorino, Polezhansko and Kamenishko.

There are two peaks above , Vihren and Kutelo; seven above ; 13 above ; 32 above and 60 above . The highest granite peak is the Banderishki Chukar (). Some of the highest peaks are:

The most recognisable rock formation in the mountain range are the Melnik Earth Pyramids situated in the southwestern reaches of Pirin in the vicinity of the homonymous town. They are located at an altitude between and are composed of sandstone and conglomerates dated from the Neogene and the Quaternary Periods. The Pyramids were formed as a result of erosion as the Melnishka River and its tributaries had carved their way into the hills forging pyramid-like forms of significant aesthetic value that reach a height of . This process began 4–5 million years ago and is still ongoing. The combination of pale Pliocene sandstones and red Quaternary conglomerates determines the yellowish and reddish colour gamut and the diverse shapes. The Melnik Earth Pyramids constitute a specific and unique micro habitat of high conservation value and were designated a natural landmark in 1960.

Similar rock formations are found further north along the slopes of Pirin facing the Struma Valley near the town of Kresna.

== Climate ==

Pirin is situated within the continental Mediterranean climate zone and due to its altitude the higher sectors have Alpine climate. The climate is influenced by Mediterranean cyclones mainly in late autumn and in winter, bringing frequent and high rainfall, and by the Azores anticyclone in summer, making the summer months hot and dry. The relief has a crucial influence on the climate. Pirin has three altitude climate zones — low between 600 and 1,000 m, middle between 1,000 and 1,800 m and high above 1,800 m. The low altitude zone is heavily influenced by the Mediterranean climate, the influence being more pronounced on the western slopes facing the Struma valley than on the eastern slopes along the Mesta valley. The high altitude zone is characterised by low temperature, low temperature amplitude, many cloudy days, lasting and thick snow cover, strong winds and intensive sun radiation.

Winters are cold and prolonged while summers are cool and short. The temperature decreases with the altitude, which is more visible in summer. The mean annual temperature is around 9–10 °C in the low, 5–7 °C in the middle and 2–3 °C in the high altitude zone. The coldest month is January with average temperature varying between −5 and −2 °C. The hottest month is July with temperature averaging 20 °C at 1,600 m and 15 °C at 2,000 m. Temperature inversions, i.e. increase in temperature with height, are observed in 75% of the winter days.

The annual precipitation in Pirin is 600–700 mm in the lower zones and 1000–1200 mm in the higher. The rainfall occurs mostly in winter and spring, while summer is driest season. The air humidity is 60–75% in August and 80–85 % in December. In winter the precipitation is mainly snow, varying from 70–90% at the lower altitudes to 100% at higher. The average number of days with snow cover varies from 20–30 to 120–160. The highest thickness of the snow cover reaches 40–60 cm at 1,000–1,800 m in February and 160–180 cm above 1,800 m in March (190 cm on Vihren). In some winters the snow thickness can reach 250–350 cm. Avalanches are frequent.

The prevailing wind direction is from the west and the north-west but southern and south-western winds are also frequent. The wind speed can reach 34–40 m/s at the high ridges, being highest in February and March and lowest in August and September. The percentage of windless days increases in summer and autumn to 30–40% at lower altitude and 10–15% at higher. In the highest zone the percentage does not exceed 5–7% annually.

== Hydrology ==

Pirin forms the water divide between the basins of the rivers Struma and Mesta. The watershed follows the main ridge of the mountain in direction north-west to south-east. As the main ridge is situated closer to the Mesta valley, the tributaries to the Struma tend to be longer. The rivers are short, steep and with high water volume; the river bottom is rocky or covered with large sediments. The water discharge is highest in May and June and lowest in September. The streamflow is largely derived from snow melting and glacial lakes in spring and summer and almost exclusively from groundwater in winter. The rivers and streams form numerous leaps and waterfalls but they are generally not as high as those in Rila or the Balkan Mountains. The highest one is Popinolashki waterfall, measuring some 12 m. Pirin is the source of 10 tributaries to the Struma, including Pirinska Bistritsa, Sandanska Bistritsa, Melnishka reka and Vlahina reka, as well as another 10 to the Mesta, such as Iztok, Disilitsa and Retizhe. Reaching a length of 53 km, Pirinska Bistritsa is the longest river in the massif. Pirin has abundant mineral springs, being among Bulgaria&#x27;s richest areas. Based on the chemical composition they are divided into two thermal groups — in the Mesta and the Struma basins. The springs in the Mesta basin to the east are more alkaline, with lower mineralisation (below 400 mg/L) and conductance; those on the western slopes reach higher temperatures, up to 86 °C.

A total of 176 glacial lakes are situated in the mountain range, all of them in North Pirin. Of them, 119 are permanent, and the rest dry out in summer. About 65% of them are located in the north-eastern area and discharge into the Mesta basin; the other 35% are to the south-west, their water flowing into the tributaries of the Struma. Approximately 90% of the lakes are nestled between 2,100 m and 2,450 m. At an altitude of 2,710 m the Upper Polezhan Lake is the highest in Pirin, as well as in Bulgaria and the Balkan Peninsula. The total area of all lakes is 1.8 km2; the largest one being Popovo Lake with 123,600 m2, which makes it the fourth largest glacial lake in the country. With a depth of 29.5 m, it is also Pirin&#x27;s deepest lake and Bulgaria&#x27;s second. The water is transparent as deep as 15 m. Many of the lakes are covered with ice during most of the year. The ice thickness reaches 3 m in the highest lakes. The lakes and the lake groups are:
* Popovo Lakes – 11
* Kremenski Lakes – 5
* Banderishki Lakes – 16
* Vasilashki Lakes – 12
* Valyavishki Lakes – 10
* Chairski Lakes – 10
* Vlahini Lakes – 5
* Malokamenishki Lakes – 34
* Prevalski Lakes – 4
* Bashliyski Lakes – 4
* Polezhanski Lakes – 2
* Tipitski Lakes – 2
* Sinanishko Lake
* Bezbozhko Lake
* Salzitsa Lake
Pirin is also home to two small glaciers, remnants from the last Ice Age. Snezhnika is located in the deep Golemiya Kazan cirque at the steep northern foot of Vihren and is the southernmost glacier in Europe. Banski Suhodol Glacier is larger and situated a bit to the north below Koncheto Ridge.

== Nature ==

The vegetation of Pirin is vertically divided into five distinct elevation zones: Mediterranean, deciduous, coniferous, that combined form the &quot;tree line&quot; reaching approximately altitude of 2,000 m, shrubs forming the &quot;subalpine line&quot; up to 2,500 m and alpine meadows, also known as the &quot;alpine line&quot; above 2,500 m. The Mediterranean zone is dominated, among other, by pubescent oak (&quot;Quercus pubescens&quot;) and Oriental Hornbeam (&quot;Carpinus orientalis&quot;), the deciduous zone by European oak (&quot;Quercus robur&quot;) and European beech (&quot;Fagus sylvatica&quot;), and the coniferous — by Macedonian pine (&quot;Pinus peuce&quot;), Bosnian pine (&quot;Pinus heldreichii&quot;) and Scots pine (&quot;Pinus sylvestris&quot;). The subalpine line is mainly covered with dwarf mountain pine (&quot;Pinus mugo&quot;) and common juniper (&quot;Juniperus communis&quot;). The alpine line is covered with grass, moss, lichen and abundant in bilberries and rare flowers such as the edelweiss (&quot;Leontopodium alpinum&quot;). Pirin is home to Bulgaria&#x27;s oldest tree, the 1300–year Baikushev&#x27;s pine — a Bosnian pine that is a contemporary of the foundation of the Bulgarian state in 681 AD. 

The total number of vascular plants is 1315 species, or approximately 1/3 of Bulgaria&#x27;s flora, many of them being rare and under protection. There are 18 species endemic to Pirin, including Pirin poppy (&quot;Papaver degenii&quot;), Kozhuharov oksitropis (&quot;Oxytropis kozhuharovii&quot;), Urumov oksitropis (&quot;Oxytropis urumovii&quot;) among others, as well as another 17 taxa restricted only to Bulgaria, which makes a total of 35 Bulgarian endemic species. The endemic genus &quot;Pirinia&quot; is named after the mountain range, containing a single species &quot;Pirinia koenigii&quot; restricted to Pirin. The non-vascular plants are represented by 165 algae, 329 moss and 367 lichen species.

The vertebrate fauna of Pirin consists of 229 species. The mammal species are 45 and include brown bear, gray wolf, wildcat, European pine marten, wild boar, red deer, roe deer and chamois. The total number of bird species is 159, including three relicts — boreal owl, white-backed woodpecker and Eurasian three-toed woodpecker, and a number of birds of prey, such as lesser spotted eagle, booted eagle, golden eagle, short-toed snake eagle, saker falcon, peregrine falcon, etc. There are 11 reptile, 8 amphibian and 6 fish species. The number of invertebrate species discovered so far is 2091 but they remain poorly studied and are expected to rise to 4500.

The rich wildlife in the mountain is protected by the Pirin National Park founded in 1962 and designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1983. The park spans an area of 403,32 km2 and includes two nature reserves, Bayuvi Dupki–Dzhindzhiritsa and Yulen. There are two more reserves in Pirin beyond the limits of the national park, Tisata and Orelyak.

== History ==
Due to the fertile foothills and the favourable terrain for defence Pirin has been continuously inhabited since prehistoric times. Archaeological remains left by the Thracians have been discovered at the western foothills along the Struma Valley and in the Razlog Valley. As the region was annexed by the Roman Empire by the 1st century BC the number of settlements saw further expansion. During the Early Middle Ages the area around Pirin was settled by Slavic tribes along with most of the Balkans and was absorbed by the Bulgarian Empire in the 9th century. Throughout the Middle Ages Pirin remained contested between the Bulgarian and the Byzantine Empires until it was conquered by the Ottoman Turks in the late 14th century. The population of the region played an active role during the Bulgarian National Revival and the struggle for national liberation. The important 18th century Bulgarian enlightener Paisius of Hilendar and author of &quot;Istoriya Slavyanobolgarskaya&quot; was born in Bansko at the northern foothills of Pirin. Bulgaria achieved liberation in 1878 but as a result of the Congress of Berlin Pirin remained in the Ottoman Empire. In response, the local population in Pirin rebelled in the Kresna–Razlog uprising (1878–1879) and later took part in the Ilinden–Preobrazhenie Uprising (1903) but both were quelled by the Ottomans. The region was finally liberated by the Bulgarian Army in October 1912 during the course of the First Balkan War (1912–1913).

== Settlements, transportation and economy ==

Pirin is a sparsely populated mountain range with all the settlements located at the foothills and none in the mountain itself. Administratively it falls entirely in Blagoevgrad Province. From north to south there are four towns at the western foothills facing the Struma Valley, namely Simitli (pop. 6,647 as of 2016), Kresna (3,267), Sandanski (26,023) and Melnik (170), as well as three more to the north and the east — Bansko (7,369), Dobrinishte (2,377) and Gotse Delchev (19,087). There are a number of villages, including among others Brezhani, Vlahi, Ploski, Lilyanovo, Dzhigurovo, Gorna Sushitsa, Kashina, Pirin, Belyovo, Novo Delchevo, Kremen, Breznitsa, Dobrotino, Kornitsa, Lazhnitsa, etc.

Pirin is served by two main roads — the first class I-1 road, part of European route E79, along the Struma valley to the west that links the capital Sofia and the provincial centre Blagoevgrad with Greece at Kulata, and the second class II-19 road which branches off I-1 at Simitly, goes east crossing the Predel Saddle and then turns south along the Mesta Valley to Gotse Delchev and the border with Greece at Ilinden. The Struma motorway is planned to run in parallel with the I-1 road, with one section between Novo Delchevo and the border already finished and another one linking Novo Delchevo and Kresna under construction as of 2017. Due to the rugged relief Pirin is crossed by only one road, the third class III-198 road that links I-1 and II-19 through the Paril Saddle between Central and South Pirin. The mountain range is served by the Bulgarian State Railways via railway line No. 5 along the Struma Valley in the west and the Septemvri–Dobrinishte narrow-gauge line with terminus at the latter town in the northern foothills.

The economy is based on agriculture, industry, services and tourism. There are small deposits of sub-bituminous coal as well as significant quantities of high-quality marble that is processed in Sandanski and part of the production is exported. A number of small hydro power plants have been constructed, mainly along Sandanska Bistritsa River. The rivers are also used for irrigation. Forests cover , or 5.5% of Bulgaria&#x27;s total, and are of commercial importance because of the high-quality timber. As logging is restricted in the protected areas the wood-processing industry in Pirin forms 3.5% of the nation&#x27;s total production in that sector. The lower parts of the mountain offer favourable conditions for agriculture, the most important cash crops being grapes, peanuts, tobacco and anise. The region around Melnik is renowned for its centuries-old traditions in producing distinct red wines. Manufacturing industry is centred in Sandanski, Gotse Delchev, Bansko and Simitli; the main sectors are food processing, machine building and furniture production.

== Tourism ==

The favourable natural conditions for winter sports, spa and recreation combined with the architectural heritage make Pirin a popular tourist destination. Bansko is by far the most developed winter resort in the mountain range, being also Bulgaria&#x27;s most popular one for foreigners — over 79,000 foreign tourists have stayed in Bansko for the 2016/17 winter season spending an average of four nights. Bansko has 75 km ski runs equipped with artificial snow machines as well as 22 km lifting facilities and provides conditions for alpine skiing, cross-country skiing, biathlon, snowboard, etc. The top elevation is 2,560 m while the lowest is 990 m. Bansko regularly hosts European alpine ski and biathlon cups. Another much smaller resort is Dobriniste with 5 km of ski tracks.

The abundant mineral springs are a prerequisite for health and spa tourism. The most developed spa resorts are Dobrinishte and Sandanski. The former has 17 springs with a total discharge of 782 L/min and temperature of 28°С to 41.2°С and has a mineral beach among the other facilities. Sandanski is home to 11 springs with a total discharge of 1200 L/min and temperature of 33°С to 83°С that have been utilised since Antiquity. Other mineral baths are located in Bansko, Banya, Vlahi, Dolna Gradeshnitsa, Levunovo, Marikostinovo, Musomishta, Oshtava, Simitli and Hotovo.

There are 20 marked hiking trails within the borders of Pirin National Park. The steep rock faces in Northern Pirin provide favourable conditions for alpine climbing. The most popular places for practising climbing are the north wall of Vihren, as well as the peaks Kamenitsa, Banski Suhodol, Sinanitsa and Dzhengal among others. Pirin Golf Club near Bansko has 18- and 5-hole golf courses.

Cultural tourism is also well developed. Melnik has been designated an architectural reserve and one of the 100 Tourist Sites of Bulgaria. Among the main sights are the ruins of the medieval fortress and the Church of St Nicholas, as well as a number of national revival style houses, such as the Kordopulov House. A few kilometres to the east of the town is Rozhen Monastery, the biggest one in Pirin. The monastery was established in the early 13th century during the Second Bulgarian Empire and has the shape of an irregular hexagon. There are frescoes dated from the 16th century. Rozhen Monastery was a regional centre for learning and calligraphy. In close proximity to the monastery is the Church of Saints Cyril and Methodius, built on the initiative of the Prominent Bulgarian revolutionary Yane Sandanski, which nowadays houses his tomb. The town of Sandanski boasts the ruins of a 5-6th century episcopal basilica that has been recently renovated. Bansko also has an old quarter with 18-19th century houses and the Church of Holy Trinity whose 30-meters high belfry is the symbol of the town.

<text>The Wildhearts are an English rock band, formed in 1989 in Newcastle upon Tyne. The band&#x27;s sound is a mixture of hard rock and melodic pop music, often described in the music press as combining influences as diverse as the Beatles and 1980s-era Metallica. The Wildhearts achieved several top 20 singles and two top 10 albums in Britain, though they also faced difficulties with record companies and many internal problems often relating to drugs and depression. Much of the band&#x27;s early career was affected by bitter feuds with their record company, East West.

Throughout the band&#x27;s history, members have regularly been replaced, with the only constant member being the band&#x27;s founder, singer and guitarist Ginger. Several band members have appeared in the line-up more than once. The band has also been split up or placed on hiatus by Ginger multiple times. In the 2010s, the band convened occasionally for various anniversary tours. A 2018 anniversary tour by the band&#x27;s 1995 lineup led to a return to the studio. They released a new album in 2019 after a ten-year hiatus. Their most recent album, &quot;Satanic Rites of the Wildhearts&quot;, is scheduled for release in March 2025.

==History==

=== 1989–1991: Early history ===
The Wildhearts formed in late 1989, after Ginger was fired from the Quireboys. Throughout the band&#x27;s career, Ginger has written almost all the songs himself. Initially called the Wild Hearts, the band originally included singers Snake (ex-Tobruk) and Dunken F. Mullett (ex-Mournblade), who both joined for short periods. After many early personnel changes, the line-up solidified around Ginger on guitar and vocals, C.J. (Christopher Jagdhar) on guitar and vocals, Danny McCormack on bass and vocals, and Dogs D&#x27;Amour drummer Bam.

=== 1991–1997: Initial success ===

The Ginger/C.J./McCormack/Bam line-up released two EPs in 1992, &quot;Mondo Akimbo a-Go-Go&quot; and &quot;Don&#x27;t Be Happy...Just Worry&quot;, after which drummer Bam returned to Dogs D&#x27;Amour and was replaced by Stidi (Andrew Stidolph). To follow up their first two EPs, the Wildhearts recorded demos for their first full-length album, which were released as &quot;Earth vs the Wildhearts&quot; without re-recording. The singles &quot;Greetings From Shitsville&quot; and &quot;TV Tan&quot; were underground hits in 1993. Stidi left the band shortly afterwards to be replaced by Ritch Battersby, just in time for the recording of the single &quot;Caffeine Bomb&quot;, a UK chart hit at the beginning of 1994, helped by a memorable video in which Ginger appeared to vomit into C.J.&#x27;s face. The band appeared on &quot;Top of the Pops&quot; with Ginger wearing green welding goggles. 

The Wildhearts next planned a double album, but East West vetoed this plan during the recording sessions. The band stockpiled existing tracks and continued writing and recording for a proposed single album. Midway through the recording sessions, Ginger fired guitarist C.J., and some of the album&#x27;s tracks were recorded without a second guitarist. For the 1994 European tours, the band were joined by Devin Townsend as second guitarist/harmony singer, having met him during a previous tour supporting the Steve Vai band. &quot;Earth vs. The Wildhearts&quot; was reissued in late 1994 with &quot;Caffeine Bomb&quot; tacked on as an extra track.

In December 1994, the Wildhearts issued six of the more eclectic tracks from the incomplete double album sessions with C.J. on a fan club-only release entitled &quot;Fishing for Luckies&quot;. The mini-album included &quot;Geordie In Wonderland&quot;, a song which Ginger had offered to Kevin Keegan and Newcastle United F.C. as a potential team anthem, although he had been graciously turned down. The track was performed on &quot;Top of the Pops&quot; with Wolfsbane&#x27;s Jeff Hateley, painted in Toon Army colours, on mandolin.

The second Wildhearts album proper, &quot;P.H.U.Q.&quot;, was released in May 1995 and reached number 6 in the UK Albums Chart, making it the band&#x27;s most successful album. Shortly after the album&#x27;s release, Mark Keds of Senseless Things was drafted as second guitarist, but lasted just one recording session, in which he appeared on the B-sides for the single &quot;Just in Lust&quot;. Keds rejoined Senseless Things, and the band hired Jef Streatfield as a replacement.

In early 1996, the Wildhearts recorded more material. Only some of the songs saw the light of day on the &quot;Fishing for More Luckies&quot; album, a revamped version of &quot;Fishing for Luckies&quot; with eight new tracks. An additional album of new material was never quite finished, although leaked copies were distributed as the &quot;Shitty Fuckin&#x27; Stupid Tracks&quot; bootleg. These rare tracks were officially released by East West in 1998 as part of the &quot;Landmines and Pantomimes&quot; rarities compilation.

In 1997 the band signed to Mushroom Records, and set about making another album. In November 1997, shortly before the release of &quot;Endless, Nameless&quot;, Ginger decided to split the band. The band toured Japan but cancelled a scheduled British tour.

Starting in 1997 the Wildhearts began to release multiple formats of singles. The band released the two singles from the album &quot;Endless, Nameless&quot; in multiple formats, including two CD singles with two B-sides on each, and a 7&quot; single with one B-side, with all the songs from the &quot;Anthem&quot; single being cover versions.

The band have continued to multi-format since 1997, in particular with &quot;Top of the World&quot; in 2003, consisting of three CD singles, two with two B-sides and one with one B-side and the video for the song. The band released a full-length album consisting only of B-sides, &quot;Coupled With&quot;.

=== 2001–2005: Reformation ===
In early 2001 Ginger announced that he was reforming the &quot;Earth vs the Wildhearts&quot; lineup of the band for a tour later that year. This lineup (consisting of Ginger and C.J. on guitars and vocals, Danny McCormack on bass and vocals, and Stidi on drums) soon ran into difficulty due to McCormack&#x27;s battle against heroin addiction, and on several dates of the comeback tour Toshi (from support band AntiProduct) stood in as bassist. By 2002 McCormack was once again clean and the band started recording a new mini-album and also toured the UK. The tracks intended for the album were released in the UK in late 2002 across three formats of the &quot;Vanilla Radio&quot; single, and as the mini-album &quot;Riff After Riff After Motherfucking Riff&quot; in Japan. &quot;Vanilla Radio&quot; reached the top 30 in the UK singles chart, and in early 2003 work began on a full-length album. However, during recording, McCormack checked himself into a rehabilitation center to deal with an alcohol problem, leaving Ginger to play the bass parts on the songs that were newly recorded for the album. McCormack&#x27;s place in the live band was filled by &quot;Random&quot; Jon Poole, who had already worked with Ginger on his Silver Ginger 5 side project.

The album &quot;The Wildhearts Must Be Destroyed&quot;, was released in 2003. The band signed a US record deal with Gearhead Records, which released &quot;Riff After Riff&quot; in 2004, a compilation of songs from the UK post-reformation singles (all of the songs from this release are also found on the Gut Records compilation &quot;Coupled With&quot;). &quot;Riff After Riff&quot; was the Wildhearts&#x27; first US release since &quot;Earth vs the Wildhearts&quot; in 1994. The release was also promoted by a tour, mostly as the support band for their ex-support band, the Darkness.

In early 2005, Ginger dissolved the Wildhearts again to briefly join the Brides of Destruction before setting out on his own as a full-time solo artist. Ginger then reformed the Wildhearts once again for a one-off gig at Scarborough Castle (Rock in the Castle) in September 2005. The 1994–1995 line-up of Ginger, C.J., McCormack, and Ritch Battersby played at this gig.

Once again, the Wildhearts reformed in December 2006 and played a single live show at the Wulfrun Hall in Wolverhampton. This line-up saw Ginger joined by C.J., Ritch Battersby and a new bassist, Scott Sorry (ex-Amen). 

===2007–2010: Second reformation===
In January 2007, the band spent a week in Tutbury Castle recording vocals and finishing their new self-titled album &quot;The Wildhearts&quot;. The album was released on 23 April, preceded two weeks earlier by the download-only single &quot;The Sweetest Song&quot;. The album received favorable reviews in the British rock press, with the &quot;Sun&quot; newspaper giving it 5 out of 5 (&quot;probably the rock album of the year&quot;) and &quot;Rocksound&quot; magazine also giving it full marks (10 out of 10). The band performed in New York, and toured the UK in April and May.

&quot;The New Flesh&quot; was released as a single on 1 October 2007. The video for the song was shot in black and white and featured a number of children, including Ginger&#x27;s own son Jake. The band released &quot;Destroy All Monsters&quot; as their next single.

On 19 May 2008 the Wildhearts released the all-covers album &quot;Stop Us If You&#x27;ve Heard This One Before, Vol 1.&quot;. The first version of the album was a download-only collection of 12 tracks, followed by a full release with 15 tracks. In mid-2008, Rhino Records also released the three-CD compilation &quot;The Works&quot;. Described by the band as &quot;licensed but unofficial&quot;, the compilation consists of album tracks and B-sides from the 1992–1996 era at East West Records.

The band traveled to Denmark to record their ninth studio album, &quot;¡Chutzpah!&quot;, which was released on 31 August 2009, followed by a tour of the United Kingdom in September and October. At these shows, the band played the new record in its entirety, followed by an encore of older songs. Around the same time as the release of &quot;Chutzpah!&quot;, they won the award for Spirit of Independence at the 2009 Kerrang! Awards, as well as playing on the Bohemia stage during the very first UK Sonisphere Festival; a four-day music festival designed by those formerly behind the Download Festival.

On 25 November 2009 the Wildhearts announced the release of &quot;¡Chutzpah! Jnr.&quot;, a mini-album composed of tracks recorded during the Chutzpah sessions that were either unreleased or only appeared as bonus tracks on the Japanese version of &quot;¡Chutzpah!&quot;. The eight-track CD was publicized as only being available at concerts during the coming &quot;Merry Xmess 2009&quot; tour.

=== 2010–2016: Hiatus ===
In 2010, Ginger joined as the guitarist for former Hanoi Rocks frontman Michael Monroe, who played the Download Festival on 12 June 2010. Ginger also performed as a solo act at the festival. Only Wildhearts songs were performed, as was the case for the Ginger &amp; Friends December 2010 tour of the UK. The Michael Monroe album &quot;Sensory Overdrive&quot;, featuring Ginger, was released in 2011.

In December 2010, Ginger stated that he was unsure if the Wildhearts would ever reform. It would appear that the departure of Scott Sorry and retirement of Ritch Battersby led to the hiatus. Following this particularly with his renewed solo career, Ginger publicly stated a number of times on Formspring that he had absolutely no desire to revisit the Wildhearts and considered that period of his life over. Despite this, Ginger announced in August 2012 that the most recent Wildhearts line-up will reform for a one-off appearance in December. The Wildhearts&#x27; songs &quot;Geordie in Wonderland&quot; and &quot;Dreaming in A&quot; appeared in the 2012 UK feature film &quot;Life Just Is&quot;.

On 10 December 2012, it was announced that Scott Sorry had left the Wildhearts due to family commitments. He was replaced by former bassist Jon Poole for the December 2012 reunion show. The band went on to play a number of shows in early 2013 to celebrate the 20th anniversary of the release of &quot;Earth vs the Wildhearts&quot;. Such was the anniversary tour&#x27;s success that a second leg took place in June of the same year. The Nottingham Rock City performance would subsequently be released as the 2014 live album &quot;Rock City vs The Wildhearts&quot;. Another UK tour took place in April 2014, this time with Scott Sorry back on bass. 2015 saw the 20th Anniversary of the release of &quot;P.H.U.Q.&quot; and another tour, this time with Jon Poole on bass duties.

=== 2016–2022: Third reformation ===
Prior to their Christmas tour in 2016, Ginger stated in an interview that the band would be recording a new album in 2017. Proceeds from the album went towards assisting McCormack&#x27;s recuperation after the amputation of his lower right leg.

In August 2018, the band announced it would be touring to celebrate 25 years of the &quot;Earth vs the Wildhearts&quot; album, in which the album would be played in full at each shows. The lineup for this tour included Ginger, C.J., Danny McCormack, and Ritch Battersby. In early January 2019, the band announced the recording of a new album had been completed with mixing to follow. The album &quot;Renaissance Men&quot; was released on 3 May 2019. The album &quot;21st Century Love Songs&quot; was released on 3 September 2021. Six months after the album&#x27;s release on 11 March 2022, the Wildhearts announced via social media that they were taking another hiatus, with the latest lineup splitting acrimoniously.

In May 2023 bassist Danny McCormack released his autobiography &quot;I Danny McCormack, Once a Wildheart, Always a Wildheart&quot;. Written with journalist Guy Shankland, the book was self-published and printed by B&amp;B Press. The book&#x27;s release was delayed due to the threat of legal action from one of McCormack&#x27;s former bandmates.

=== 2024–present: Fourth reformation ===
In early 2024, Ginger announced another new line up of the Wildhearts with returning bassist Jon Poole, guitarist Ben Marsden, and drummer Pontus Snibb; with a world tour completed that year. This lineup recorded the album &quot;Satanic Rites of the Wildhearts&quot;, scheduled for release on March 7, 2025, with a short tour of the United Kingdom to follow.

<text>Ted L. Koehler (July 14, 1894 – January 17, 1973) was an American lyricist. He was inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame in 1972.

==Life and career==
Koehler was born in 1894 in Washington, D.C.

He started out as a photo-engraver, but was attracted to the music business, where he started out as a theater pianist for silent films.

He moved on to write for vaudeville and Broadway theatre, and he also produced nightclub shows.

His most successful collaboration was with the composer Harold Arlen, with whom he wrote many famous songs from the 1920s through the 1940s. In 1929 the duo composed their first well-known song, &quot;Get Happy&quot;, and went on to create &quot;Let&#x27;s Fall in Love&quot;, &quot;Stormy Weather&quot;, &quot;Sing My Heart&quot; and other hit songs. Throughout the early and mid-1930s they wrote for the Cotton Club, a popular Harlem night club, for big band jazz legend Duke Ellington and other top performers, as well as for Broadway musicals and Hollywood films.

Koehler also worked with other composers, including Jimmy McHugh, Rube Bloom, Harry Warren and Sammy Fain.

Koehler died in 1973 in Santa Monica at the age of 78.

<text>George Shelvocke (baptised 1 April 167530 November 1742) was an English Royal Navy officer and later privateer who in 1726 wrote &quot;A Voyage Round the World by Way of the Great South Sea&quot; based on his exploits. It includes an account of how his second captain, Simon Hatley, shot an albatross off Cape Horn, an incident which provided the dramatic motive in Samuel Taylor Coleridge&#x27;s poem &quot;The Rime of the Ancient Mariner&quot;.

==Early life and naval career==
Born into a farming family in Shropshire and christened at St Mary&#x27;s, Shrewsbury, on 1 April 1675, Shelvocke joined the Royal Navy when he was fifteen years old. During two long wars with France he rose through the ranks to become a sailing master and finally second lieutenant of a flagship serving under Rear Admiral Sir Thomas Dilkes in the Mediterranean. However, when war ended in 1713 he was beached without even half-pay for support. By the time he was offered a commission as captain of the privateering ship &quot;Speedwell&quot;, he was living in poverty.

==Privateering voyage==
Alongside the &quot;Success&quot;, captained by John Clipperton, the &quot;Speedwell&quot; was involved in a 1719 expedition to loot Spanish ships and settlements along the Pacific coast of the Americas. The English had just renewed hostilities with Spain in the War of the Quadruple Alliance, and the ships carried letters of marque which gave them official permission to wage war on the Spanish and keep the profits. Shelvocke broke away from Clipperton shortly after leaving British waters and appears to have avoided contact as much as possible for the rest of the voyage.

On 25 May 1720 the &quot;Speedwell&quot; was wrecked on the island of Más a Tierra in the Juan Fernández Archipelago. Shelvocke and his crew were marooned there for five months but managed to build a 20-ton boat using some timbers and hardware salvaged from the wreck, in addition to wood obtained from locally felled trees. Leaving the island on 6 October, they transferred into their first prize, renamed the &quot;Happy Return&quot;, and resumed privateering, despite the war having ended in February and rendered their letter of marque invalid. They continued up the coast of South America from Chile to Baja California, capturing more vessels along the way, before crossing the Pacific to Macao and returning to England in July 1722.

==Later life==
In England Shelvocke was arrested on charges of fraud at the instigation of the principal shareholders of the voyage, though he avoided conviction through out-of-court settlements with two of the complainants. They suspected, probably with reason, that he had failed to let them know about a significant portion of the loot obtained from the voyage, and planned to keep it for himself and other members of his crew. The self-justifying version of events given by Shelvocke in the book &quot;A Voyage Round the World by Way of the Great South Sea&quot; was disputed by some who had accompanied him on that expedition, in particular by his captain of marines, William Betagh.

Shelvocke nevertheless went on to re-establish his reputation and died on 30 November 1742 at the age of 67, a wealthy man as a result of his buccaneering activity. His chest tomb (since removed) in the churchyard of St Nicholas, Deptford, London, by the east wall eulogised &quot;a gentleman of great abilities in his profession and allowed to have been one of the bravest and most accomplished seamen of his time.&quot; A wall tablet in the chancel commemorates his son, also George Shelvocke, who died in 1760 and accompanied his father on the journey round the world before becoming Secretary of the General Post Office and a Fellow of the Royal Society.

==Influence on Coleridge==

In his book Shelvocke described an event wherein his second captain, Simon Hatley, shot a black albatross while the &quot;Speedwell&quot; was attempting to round Cape Horn in severe storms. Hatley took the giant sea bird to be a bad omen, and hoped that by killing it he might bring about a break in the weather. Some seventy years later the episode would become the inspiration for the central plot device in Samuel Taylor Coleridge&#x27;s narrative poem &quot;The Rime of the Ancient Mariner&quot;. Coleridge&#x27;s friend and fellow poet William Wordsworth shared the following reminiscences on the origins of the poem:

Much the greatest part of the story was Mr Coleridge&#x27;s invention; but certain parts I myself suggested: for example, some crime was to be committed which should bring upon the old navigator, as Coleridge afterwards delighted to call him, the spectral persecution, as a consequence of that crime, and his own wanderings. I had been reading in Shelvock&#x27;s &quot;Voyages&quot; a day or two before that while doubling Cape Horn they frequently saw albatrosses in that latitude, the largest sort of sea-fowl, some extending their wings twelve or fifteen feet. &quot;Suppose,&quot; I said, &quot;you represent him as having killed one of these birds on entering the South Sea, and that the tutelary spirits of those regions take upon them to avenge the crime. The incident was thought fit for the purpose and adopted accordingly.&quot;

<text>Lokendra Bahadur Chand ( born 15 February 1940) was the 27th prime minister of Nepal four times: from 1983 to 1986, briefly during April 1990, briefly during 1997 and from October 2002 until June 2003. He is also involved in literature and have won a Madan Puraskar for his book Bisarjan in 2054 B.S.

During his first two terms as prime minister, he did not belong to any political party, but by 1997 he was a member of his current political party, the conservative Rashtriya Prajatantra Party (RPP). He became Prime Minister on October 11, 2002, a week after the king launched a coup against the Nepali Congress government of Sher Bahadur Deuba. Chand was the head of the 2002 cabinet. Chand was forced to resign in 2003 after massive protests and an intensification of the civil war with Maoist rebels.

Ahead of the 2008 Constituent Assembly election, Chand is the top candidate of RPP for the closed proportional representation list.

He has four sons and three daughters. His son Jayant Chand is in politics and became Minister twice and is active in his father&#x27;s party.

<text>Joseph Borg (born 19 March 1952) is a Maltese politician and diplomat. Prior to taking up the post of Commissioner for Fisheries and Maritime Affairs, he was Minister of Foreign Affairs and led Malta&#x27;s EU-accession negotiations.

==Career==
He graduated Doctor of Laws in Malta in 1975 and Master of Laws in Wales in 1988.

Since 1979, Borg held various academic posts at the University of Malta, mainly focusing on company law, industrial law and European law. He also held various posts as legal adviser to companies and corporate bodies in Malta and other countries.

He began his career in politics as an advisor to the Foreign Minister on European Union matters from 1989 until 1995. From 1992 until 1995 he also served as member of the board of directors of the Maltese Central Bank. He was elected to Parliament in 1995 as a member of the Nationalist Party. He later served as Parliamentary Secretary within the Ministry of Foreign Affairs from 1998 to 1999 and was subsequently appointed Minister of Foreign Affairs in 1999. He held this post until he was nominated Commissioner for Fisheries and Maritime Affairs in 2004, upon Malta&#x27;s accession to the EU.

==Fisheries Commissioner==
As European Commissioner, he has been responsible for spearheading the EU&#x27;s Integrated Maritime Policy and for innovative measures in fisheries, particularly through the involvement of stakeholders and the fight against illegal fishing activities, aimed at achieving sustainability in the sector. However, European fisheries policy has been unsuccessful so far in achieving sustainability, with 91% of fisheries on course to be classified as &quot;overfished&quot; by 2015, by which time the EU has committed to international targets for achieving sustainability. His head of cabinet was the German Michael Koehler.

Borg courted controversy among environmental groups by fiercely opposing the ban on the sale of Bluefin tuna, an increasingly rare fish which sells for thousands of pounds in Japan. His position on Bluefin tuna has been linked to the fact that the industry earns €100 million annually for Malta. Borg commented to the &quot;Times of Malta&quot; that &quot;it is thanks to a lot of hard work at my level and at my staff&#x27;s level that many of the proposals that are agreed by the commission took into account Maltese sensitivities&quot;.

Soon after the end of his term as Fisheries Commissioner in 2010, he was appointed chairman of the Mediterranean Academy of Diplomatic Studies and resumed lecturing at the University of Malta.

==Family==
Borg is married to Isabelle with whom he has two children, Joseph and Clara.

==Honorary doctorates==
Borg was awarded an honorary doctorate by the University of Essex in July 2003.

==Publications==

<text>The Monastery of Saint John of Rila, also known as Rila Monastery (&quot;Sveti Ivan Rilski&quot; (), is the largest and most famous Eastern Orthodox monastery in Bulgaria. It is situated in the southwestern Rila Mountains, south of the capital Sofia in the deep valley of the Rilska River (&quot;Rila River&quot;) at an elevation of above sea level, inside of Rila Monastery Nature Park and in close vicinity of the Rila Monastery Forest Nature Reserve. The monastery is named after its founder, the hermit Saint Ivan of Rila (876–946 AD), and houses approximately 60 monks. The monastery is a popular pilgrimage site for many Orthodox Christians.

Founded in the 10th century, Rila Monastery is regarded as one of Bulgaria&#x27;s most important cultural, historical and architectural monuments and is a key tourist attraction for both Bulgaria and Southern Europe for religious tourists. In 2008 alone it attracted 900,000 visitors. The monastery is depicted on the reverse of the 1 lev banknote issued in 1999.

== History ==
It is traditionally thought that the monastery was founded by the hermit Saint Ivan of Rila, whose name it bears, during the rule of Tsar Peter I (r. 927–968). The hermit actually lived in a cave without any material possessions not far from the monastery&#x27;s location, while the complex was built by his students, who came to the mountains to receive their education.

Ever since its creation, Rila Monastery has been supported and respected by the Bulgarian rulers. Large donations were made by almost every tsar of the Second Bulgarian Empire until the Ottoman Conquest, making the monastery a cultural and spiritual centre of Bulgarian national consciousness that reached its apogee from the 12th to the 14th centuries.

Rila Monastery was re-erected at its present place by Hrelja, a feudal lord, during the first half of the 14th century. The oldest buildings in the complex date from this period — the Tower of Hrelja (1334–1335) and a small church just next to it (1343). The bishop&#x27;s throne and the richly engraved gates of the monastery also belong to the time. However, the arrival of the Ottomans at the end of the 14th century was followed by numerous raids and a destruction of the monastery in the middle of the 15th century.

Thanks to donations by the Sultana Mara Branković, the Russian Orthodox Church and the Rossikon monastery of Mount Athos, Rila Monastery was rebuilt at the end of the 15th century by three brothers from the region of Dupnica. With Sultana Mara Branković&#x27;s influence, Ivan of Rila&#x27;s relics were moved from Tarnovo into the new complex in 1469.

The complex acted as a depository of Bulgarian language and culture in the ages of foreign rule. During the time of the Bulgarian National Revival (18th and 19th centuries), it was destroyed by fire in 1833 and then reconstructed between 1834 and 1862 with the help of wealthy Bulgarians from the whole country, under the architect Alexi Rilets. The erection of the residential buildings began in 1816, while a belfry was added to the Tower of Hrelyu in 1844. Neofit Rilski founded a school in the monastery during the period. The monastery is known as being one of the hideouts of Bulgarian revolutionaries such as Vassil Levski, Gotse Delchev, and Peyo Yavorov.

The monastery complex, regarded as one of the foremost masterpieces of Bulgarian National Revival architecture, was declared a national historical monument in 1976 and became a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1983. Since 1991 it has been entirely subordinate to the Holy Synod of the Bulgarian Orthodox Church.

On 25 May 2002, Pope John Paul II visited Rila Monastery during his pilgrimage to Bulgaria. He was greeted by the monastery&#x27;s igumen, Bishop Ioan, who had been an observer at the Second Vatican Council.

== Architecture ==
The whole complex occupies an area of 8,800 m2 and is rectangular in form, centred on the inner yard (3,200 m2), where the tower and the main church are situated.

=== Main church ===

The main church of the monastery was erected in the middle of the 19th century. Its architect, Pavel Ioanov, worked on it from 1834 to 1837. The church has five domes, three altars and two side chapels, while one of the most precious items inside is the gold-plated iconostasis, noted for its wood-carving, the creation of which took five years by four handicraftsmen: Atanas Teladur, Petar and Georgi Dashini and Dimitar Stanishev. The participation of Petre Filipovich- Garkata is questionable. The frescoes, finished in 1846, are the work of many masters from Bansko, Samokov and Razlog, including the famous brothers Zahari Zograf and Dimitar Zograf. The church is also home to many valuable icons, dating from the 14th to the 19th century. Porticos in the courtyard have Mamluk influence with the striped painting and the domes, which became more popular in the Ottoman Empire after the conquest of Egypt.

=== Residential part ===
The four-storey (not counting the basement) residential part of the complex consists of 300 chambers, four chapels, an abbot&#x27;s room, a kitchen (noted for its uncommonly large vessels), a library housing 250 manuscripts and 9,000 old printed matters, and a donor&#x27;s room. The exterior of the complex, with its high walls of stone and little windows, resembles a fortress more than a monastery.

=== Monastery museum ===
The museum of the Rila Monastery is particularly famous for housing Rafail&#x27;s Cross, a wooden cross made from a whole piece of wood (81×43 cm). It was whittled down by a monk named Rafail using fine burins and magnifying lenses to recreate 104 religious scenes and 650 miniature figures. Work on this piece of art lasted not less than 12 years before it was completed in 1802, when the monk lost his sight.

<text>John Dalli (born 5 October 1948) is a Maltese former politician who served as Cabinet Minister in various Maltese governments between 1987 and 2010. He was European Commissioner for Health and Consumer Policy between 2010 and 2012.

==Maltese politics==
Dalli was first elected to the House of Representatives of Malta in 1987 on behalf of the Nationalist Party, and since then, he has been re-elected in five successive elections: in 1992, 1996, 1998, 2003, and 2008. He has served as Parliamentary Secretary for Industry (1987–1990), Minister of Economic Affairs (1990–92), Minister of Finance (1992–1996, 1998–2004), and Minister of Foreign Affairs and Investment Promotion (2004). During his tenure at the Ministry of Finance (the longest in Maltese political history), Dalli is best remembered for his modernization of the taxation system through the introduction of VAT in 1994 and again in 1998.

He is credited with the creation of the financial services centre.

In February 2004, Dalli contested the election for the leadership of the Nationalist Party but lost to Lawrence Gonzi, who was appointed prime minister. In the new cabinet, Dalli was appointed Minister of Foreign Affairs and Investment Promotion. However, he resigned after serving for three months from April to July 2004 following allegations of corruption in the awarding of contracts for medical equipment and airline ticketing.

Dalli remained a backbench MP and was outspoken about what was going on within the party. In 2007 the Prime Minister appointed Dalli as a personal consultant.

Dalli was re-elected to the House of Representatives in the March 2008 general election and returned to the cabinet as Minister for Social Policy. His portfolio included health, the elderly, employment and training, housing, and industrial relations. Joe Cassar and Mario Galea were appointed Parliamentary Secretaries for Health and for the Elderly and Community Care respectively to assist him.

In this ministry, Dalli started a reform of the health sector which was interrupted when he resigned as minister and as Member of Parliament on 10 February 2010 on his appointment as European Commissioner.

==European Commissioner==
Dalli was appointed to the European Commission on 9 February 2010 as Commissioner for Health and Consumer Policy. On 15 October 2012, the European Anti-fraud Office (OLAF) delivered its report to the Commission President on accusations an associate of Dalli had asked for €60 million from Swedish Match, the main producer of Swedish snus, in return for Dalli&#x27;s help in changing European tobacco regulations. On 16 October 2012, Dalli was forced to resign by Commission President José Manuel Barroso. Dalli has maintained that he did not resign, but in an interview given on the morning of 17 October, 2012 with &quot;New Europe&quot; confirmed Barroso asked him for his resignation, and alleged that the Tobacco lobby was involved in the case.

Dalli has subsequently denied any knowledge of the alleged bribery.

The OLAF report claimed that the decision-making process of the commission services was not jeopardized, that no money changed hands, and that Dalli was not involved in the execution of this action. However, they put forward the conclusion that he knew what was going on. This was stated in the statement issued by the Commission to announce Dalli&#x27;s dismissal.

Dalli had insisted from the outset that the report by OLAF should be published, but the commission always refused. Finally, this report was leaked by &quot;Malta Today&quot; on 28 April 2013. Upon its publication, there was a chorus of criticism of this report, which was described by some as amateurish and biased.

On 24 December 2012, Dalli instituted a case in the European Court of Justice against the Commission to annul the decision by Barroso to force his resignation (Case T-562/12). On 7 and 8 July 2014, the ECJ held a public session to hear witnesses in the case, Jose Manuel Barroso, President of the Commission, was called as a witness in the proceedings. On 12 May 2015, the action was dismissed, and Dalli was ordered to pay the costs.

Dalli also instituted a case in the Belgian Criminal Court against Swedish Match for defamation on 13 December 2012. In December 2014, Dalli extended the case to include OLAF as he insists that OLAF abused its powers in the investigation. This case seems to be stalled as the police officer on the case has been changed by the Belgian Authorities.

The OLAF announced on 26 September 2013, that it had begun a new investigation into Dalli.

==Back in Malta==
Peter Paul Zammit, the police commissioner, appointed on 13 April 2013, reinvestigated the case and Dalli was called again to be interviewed on 21 May 2013. On 8 June 2013, Zammit stated that there was no evidence to arraign Dalli, but that the investigations were continuing. This position was reiterated by Zammit on 27 September 2013.

In the summer of 2016, Giovanni Kessler&#x27;s European Anti-fraud Office (OLAF) delivered a report on Dalli to Maltese authorities. Former Malta Police Chief John Rizzo has said there was enough evidence against Dalli, and he cannot explain why criminal charges were not brought. In May 2017, the Maltese police said investigations into Dalli were ongoing.

&quot;The New York Times&quot; has reported that Dalli defrauded investors in South Carolina out of at least $1.5 million.

===Supervisory Committee Opinion 2/2012===
On 4 July 2014, the Supervisory Committee set up to supervise the actions of OLAF during its investigations published its report on the case involving Dalli. They sent the report to Corporate Europe Observatory in answer to a request that the latter NGO had made months before. CEO immediately published the report on its website. This report was sent to the Director General OLAF in December 2012. However, OLAF had been refusing to publish this report. After harsh insistence, the European Parliament was only given a censored copy of the report. Even after its publication, the Director General OLAF refused to publish the document on OLAF&#x27;s website, as is the usual practice.

The report can be read on http://corporateeurope.org/sites/default/files/2012-02-opinion-supervisory_committee.pdf. It can be seen that it is highly critical of the way that OLAF conducted this investigation and of the way that Kessler conducted himself.

In the ECJ hearing referred to above, Dalli&#x27;s lawyers claimed that this opinion shows that Dalli&#x27;s human rights were breached by OLAF and asked for the document to be included in the proceedings. The Court accepted this request over the protests of the lawyers of the Commission.

===Kessler refuses to give evidence===
In the case that the Maltese Local authorities instituted against Mr. Silvio Zammit, the prosecution has called Kessler on different occasions to give evidence. Kessler has not presented himself to give witness.

The same applies to employees of Swedish Match and ESTOC who are refusing calls by the Maltese courts to give evidence in the case.

===Secret Documents from Philip Morris===
On 7 October 2014, France 2, a French public television station, aired a two-hour report entitled &quot;Tobacco Industry, the Grand Manipulation&quot;. In this report, the journalists uncovered documents they acquired from Philip Morris showing that the tobacco lobby had planned a strategy to target Dalli, the European commissioner who was steadfast in his drive to have a harsh tobacco products directive.

<text>Michael Frendo (born 29 July 1955) is a former Maltese politician who currently is a lawyer and consultant. Previously he served in the government of Malta in various functions including as Minister of Foreign Affairs from 2004 to 2008 and Speaker of the House of Representatives of Malta from 2010 to 2013. He is from Floriana brother of Henry Frendo.

==Political life==
Frendo was first elected to the House of Representatives of Malta in 1987 and was re-elected in 1992, 1996, 1998 and 2003. From 1990 to 1992 he was Minister of State (Parliamentary Secretary) for Youth, Culture and Consumer Protection. From 1992 to 1994 he was Minister of Youth and Arts. From 1994 to 1996 he was Minister of Transport, Communications and Technology.

He was Parliamentary Secretary (Minister of State) in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs from March to July 2004 before becoming Minister of Foreign Affairs on 3 July 2004, replacing John Dalli. Frendo was not re-elected to the House of Representatives in the March 2008 parliamentary election and was consequently replaced as Foreign Minister on 12 March 2008. However, he regained a parliamentary seat in a casual election on 17 April 2008, after Cabinet had already been formed. After serving as Chairman of the Foreign and European Affairs Committee, in 2010, Michael Frendo was unanimously elected as Speaker of the House of Representatives, Malta&#x27;s Parliament.

Frendo has been a member of the European Convention on the Future of Europe and a signatory to its Draft Constitutional Treaty, as well as a signatory to the Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe and to the Treaty of Lisbon which superseded it and which is came into force on 1 December 2009. The only other person in Europe who is a signatory to all three documents leading to the new constitutional framework of the European Union is EU Commissioner and former Belgian Foreign Minister Karel De Gucht. In April 2010 he was nominated as Speaker of the House of Representatives, succeeding Louis Galea, who resigned office after being appointed as the Maltese representative in the European Court of Auditors. 

Michael Frendo is a member of the European Commission for Democracy through Law (Council of Europe&#x27;s Venice Commission on constitutional matters) since June 2013.

Back in private practice as a lawyer and consultant, he is the Managing Director of Frendo Advisory, a firm specialising in offering immigration advise. He is also the (non-executive) Chairman of Banif Bank (Malta) Plc. Michael Frendo is a (part-time) Senior Lecturer at the Faculty of Laws of the University of Malta.

Michael Frendo has received honours from a number of countries including Spain, Portugal, Italy, Austria, Cyprus, Latvia and Tunisia. In December 2013, he was appointed Companion of the Order of Merit (K.O.M.) of the Republic of Malta.

==Books==
Frendo has published numerous books based on European Affairs: &quot;The Future of Europe&quot; (2003), &quot;Europe, The Case for Membership&quot; (1996), &quot;Malta in the Council of Europe&quot; (1990), &quot;Malta in the European Community - Commercial and Legal Considerations&quot; (1989), and &quot;Is Malta Burning?&quot; (1981). He also has written on a varied number of legal issues, in particular relating to Information and Communications technologies, Maritime affairs and the European Union.

<doc id="787939" wikidata="Q533063" url="?curid=787939" title="Bridled nail-tail wallaby">
<text>The bridled nail-tail wallaby (Onychogalea fraenata), also known as the bridled nail-tailed wallaby, bridled nailtail wallaby, bridled wallaby, merrin, and flashjack, is a vulnerable species of macropod. It is a small wallaby found in three isolated areas in Queensland, Australia, and whose population is declining. In early 2019 the total population of the species was estimated to be fewer than 500 mature individuals in the wild and 2285 in captivity.

== Taxonomy ==
A specimen was presented to the Linnean Society of London by John Gould in 1840, and published in the society&#x27;s journal the following year. The date of first publication has been the source of conjecture, and it has been proposed that this was in a 1840 issue of &quot;The Athenaeum&quot;.

Gould obtained his specimens while in Australia, returning these to England for scientific examination; he gave the animal the common name bridled kangaroo.

==Description==

These small wallabies are named for two distinguishing characteristics: a white &quot;bridle&quot; line that runs down from the back of the neck around the shoulders, and a horny spur on the end of the tail. Other key physical features include a black stripe running down the dorsum of the neck between the scapulae, large eyes, and white stripes on the cheeks, which are often seen in other species of wallabies as well.

The bridled nail-tail wallaby can grow to one metre in length, half of which is tail, and weighs 4–8 kg. Females are somewhat smaller than the males. The tail spur can be 3–6 mm long and partly covered in hair. Its purpose is unclear.

The &quot;nail-tail&quot; is a feature common to two other species of wallabies: the northern nail-tail wallaby and the crescent nail-tail wallaby (which was declared to be extinct in 1956).

The taste of the meat of this species was described by Gould as excellent.

==Ecology and behaviour==
The species are most active during the night-time and dusk periods. Day is usually spent sleeping in hollows near bushes or trees. In modern habitats, nail-tails keep close to the edges of pasture grasses. These wallabies have a reputation as shy and solitary animals. They may occasionally form small groups of up to four to feed together when grazing is in short supply.

Gould was able to view the animal in its native habitat and recorded observations of its behaviour at the area around Brezi and then to observe their capture by the indigenous people at &quot;Gundermein&quot; on around the lower Namoi River. His notes the rapid movement of a live animal when pursued, outpacing the dogs accompanying his party, which ascended up a hollow tree and leapt from the top to enter a hollow log. At a second site Gould witnessed the capture of the species with nets by the local people, fulfilling his request for a series of specimens.

The bridled nail-tail wallaby has a polygynous mating system. After a gestation period of about 23 days, the single joey undergoes further development in the mother&#x27;s pouch for around four more months.

The bridled nail-tail wallaby&#x27;s defence behaviour when threatened by native predators is usually to lie flat on the ground and find some cover. However, in 2021 it was observed that in response to introduced predators such as feral cats and foxes, it had altered its behaviour and had learnt to hide in response to smelling the predator.

The bridled nail-tail wallaby is of interest to marsupial researchers because it appears to have a more vigorous immune system than other species of macropods. In the words of marsupial immunologist Dr Lauren Young, &quot;These wallabies appear to be able to survive parasite infections, viruses and various diseases more readily than other marsupials&quot;.

==Distribution and habitat==

At the time of European settlement of Australia, bridled nail-tail wallabies were common all along the East Australian coastline region to the west of the Great Dividing Range. Naturalists in the 19th century reported that the species ranged from the Murray River region of Victoria through central New South Wales to Charters Towers in Queensland.

The species declined in the late 19th and early 20th centuries with no confirmed sightings between 1937 and 1973, by which time it was believed to be extinct. After reading an article in a magazine about Australia&#x27;s extinct species, a fencing contractor reported that there was an extant population on a property near Dingo, Queensland. This sighting was subsequently confirmed by researchers from the Queensland Parks and Wildlife Service, and the property became Taunton National Park in 1973, a scientific nature reserve for the purpose of ensuring the ongoing survival and protection of this endangered species.

As of 2001, the range of this wallaby was estimated at less than 5% of its original range. The extant population was estimated to be fewer than 500 mature individuals in the wild in 2019.

==Conservation==

In the early 1900s this species suffered dramatically from shooting, for its fur and because it was considered a pest. Current threats to the species include predation by introduced species such as feral cats, red foxes, and dingoes. Other threats include wildfires, prolonged drought, habitat destruction by the pastoral industry and competition for food from grazers, such as rabbits and domestic sheep.

Since its rediscovery, the bridled nail-tail wallaby has been the target of private conservation efforts to re-establish viable populations. Captive breeding programs established three populations in Queensland: two in State reserves located at Idalia and Taunton National Parks, and another on a private reserve, Project Kial, located near Marlborough in Central Queensland.

After the last captive-breeding facility in Queensland failed, the remaining animals were transferred to Avocet Nature Refuge (south of Emerald), with the total population there and at Taunton estimated at around 600. As of 2019, the species was confined to three populations: Taunton and Avocet in Queensland, and Australian Wildlife Conservancy&#x27;s Scotia Sanctuary in New South Wales, where there were more than 1,000 wallabies in 2018.

In August 2019, 41 Bridled Nailtail Wallabies were scouted from Taunton and Scotia for reintroduction to a feral predator-free breeding area within the Pilliga State Conservation Area in northwestern NSW. The translocation was conducted by Australian Wildlife Conservancy in partnership with NSW National Parks and Services, as part of the NSW Government&#x27;s &quot;Saving our Species&quot; program.

A new strategy known as head-starting has been trialled at Avocet, with a successful outcome reported in May 2021: the population had grown by more than 100% over three years. A area had been fenced off three years earlier, with the youngest wallabies placed in it and allowed to grow in an area safe from feral cats, after studies had shown that it was overwhelmingly this group that was most vulnerable to predation. Although this method had been tested on reptiles and birds before, this was its first trial with land-based mammals.

At Taunton Conservation Park, a total of 65 of the wallabies were recorded in 2008, but by early 2021, the population had risen to an estimated 1,300.

<text>The Liberal and Centre Union (, LiCS) was a conservative-liberal political party in Lithuania active between 2003 and 2014.

It was a member of the Liberal International and the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe (ALDE).

==History==
LiCS was formed in 2003 by a merger of the Liberal Union of Lithuania, Centre Union of Lithuania and Modern Christian Democratic Union.

The combined party was led by Gintautas Babravičius. In the 2004 European Parliamentary Elections it gained 11.2% of the vote and returned two MEPs.

In the 2004 parliamentary elections on 10 October 2004, the party won 9.1% of the popular vote and 18 out of 141 seats in the Seimas. Initially, the party joined opposition with the Homeland Union. In early 2006, Liberal Movement was formed by dissident members of LiCS. After fall of Brazauskas-led government later the same year, LiCS joined new government of Gediminas Kirkilas.

In the October 2008 parliamentary elections, LiCS retained eight seats out of its previous 18 and received 5.3% of the national vote, and formed a coalition with the Homeland Union – Lithuanian Christian Democrats, Liberal Movement, and National Resurrection Party (TPP).

On 22 September 2011, the party agreed to absorb the TPP, whose MPs had been sitting in the LiCS parliamentary group.

In the October 2012 parliamentary elections, the party lost all eight seats, taking just 2.1% of the national vote.

On 12 July 2014, the LiCS merged with YES to form the Lithuanian Freedom Union (LLS).

<text>Binmaley, officially the Municipality of Binmaley (; ; ), is a municipality in the province of Pangasinan, Philippines. According to the 2020 census, it has a population of 86,881 people.

==Etymology==
The town is thought to be named after the &quot;Binmaley&quot; tribe, the original inhabitants of the area known for their fishing skills and agricultural practices.

==History==
During the Spanish colonial period, Binmaley became a significant trading center, particularly for salt and fish. The town thrived under Spanish rule, its economy fueled by its abundant natural resources. After the Spanish-American War, Binmaley became part of the American-controlled Philippines, continuing its growth as a fishing and agricultural hub.

Today, Binmaley is known for its vibrant culture, stunning natural beauty, and its delicious &quot;bangús&quot; (milkfish, &quot;C. chanos&quot;). The town’s beautiful seaside spots along the Lingayen Gulf, such as Bonuan Beach, attract tourists from all over the Philippines. Binmaley also hosts lively festivals like the &quot;Pista ng Parul&quot; (Festival of Lights) and the Binmaley Fish Festival, celebrating its cultural heritage and local produce. The town is home to historical landmarks like the Binmaley Church and the Binmaley Municipal Hall, showcasing its rich past.

==Geography==
Binmaley is located along the western coast of Pangasinan facing the Lingayen Gulf, in between Lingayen and Dagupan. From January 8–9, 1945, the amphibious forces of U.S. General Douglas MacArthur used the town’s beach, designated as “yellow beach&quot;, alongside beaches in Lingayen, Dagupan, and San Fabián, for landing operations to liberate Luzon from Japanese occupation during World War II.

Binmaley is from Lingayen and from Manila.

===Barangays===
Binmaley is politically subdivided into 33 barangays. Each barangay consists of &quot;puroks&quot; and some have &quot;sitios&quot;.
* Amancoro
* Balagan
* Balogo
* Basing
* Baybay Lopez
* Baybay Polong
* Biec
* Buenlag
* Calit
* Caloocan Dupo
* Caloocan Norte
* Caloocan Sur
* Camaley
* Canaoalan
* Dulag
* Gayaman
* Linoc
* Lomboy

* Pallas
* Papagueyan
* Parayao
* Poblacion
* Pototan
* Sabangan
* Salapingao
* San Isidro Norte
* San Isidro Sur
* Santa Rosa
* Tombor
===Climate===

==Demographics==
== Economy ==

The town is famous for its &quot;bangus&quot; (milkfish) aqua-culture, due to the existence of its numerous fishponds (&quot;pokok&quot; in the Pangasinan language). However, because of constant siltation over the past several years from mine tailings upstream from Agno River (due to mine operations in neighboring Benguet Province), and the overuse of artificial fish feeds, the &quot;bangus&quot; industry has suffered from fishkill, fewer viable fishponds and lower harvests. As a result, many formerly productive fishponds have been converted into large commercial and residential lots. This phenomenon is beginning to seriously threaten the unique Binmaley fishpond industry. Current Government action is inadequate due to strong pressures from other competing commercial interests, not to mention fishfeed producers.

==Government==
===Local government===

Binmaley, belonging to the second congressional district of the province of Pangasinan, is governed by a mayor designated as its local chief executive and by a municipal council as its legislative body in accordance with the Local Government Code. The mayor, vice mayor, and the councilors are elected directly by the people through an election which is being held every three years.

===Elected officials===

==Culture==
Binmaley, is famously known for its &quot;Sigay Festival&quot;. The Pangasinan word &quot;sigay&quot; broadly translates to harvest, or a time to gather the rich yields of the farm, the sea, the ponds and the rivers. It also relates to a contraction of the words &quot;silew&quot;, meaning light, and &quot;gayaga&quot;, meaning merriment. It was Mayor Lorenzo &quot;Enzo&quot; Cerezo who pioneered and founded &quot;Sigay Festival&quot;.

===Heritage===

Binmaley&#x27;s town center has a Neo classical church dating back to the 17th century. It also became famous throughout the Philippines for the outstanding academic achievements of students (and its distinctive corps of military cadets) from its Binmaley Catholic High School, especially when it was headed by a German priest, Fr. Leo Behneke, in the 1960s and 1970s. Its name roughly means &quot;the place which became a town&quot; or &quot;went to town&quot; in the Pangasinan language.

<doc id="787950" wikidata="Q1938830" url="?curid=787950" title="Asiloidea">
<text>The Asiloidea comprise a very large superfamily insects in the order Diptera, the true flies. It has a cosmopolitan distribution, occurring worldwide. It includes the family Bombyliidae, the bee flies, which are parasitoids, and the Asilidae, the robber flies, which are predators of other insects.

== Description ==
Adult Asiloidea are large and showy flies in terms of general appearance. They can be recognised by the following features: antenna with no more than 4 flagellomeres, leg empodium usually setiform or absent; wing with cell cup elongate and vein CuA2 ending freely on the wing margin or meeting with vein A1 at or near the wing margin. In families Mydidae, Apioceridae, and Asilidae, the head is at least slightly concave between the eyes and the ocelli, and both sexes are dichoptic (with a clear separation between the eyes). In Therevidae, Apsilocephalidae, and Scenopinidae, the males are usually holoptic (eyes meet at top of head).

Known larvae of this superfamily have posterior spiracles arising dorsally from the penultimate abdominal segment, making this feature a synapomorphy. However, larvae of most asiloids are unknown and this feature appears in other superfamilies as well. Another feature possessed by most asiloids (except Bombyliidae and Hilarimorphidae) is the larval cranium being modified into a hinged metacephalic rod.

== Ecology ==
Adults usually visit flowers to feed, while larvae usually live in a substrate and are predatory. There are exceptions to this rule, such as Bombyliidae (larvae are parasitoids of other insects) and Asilidae (adults are predatory). The greatest diversity of asiloids is in arid, sandy habitats.

== Distribution ==
The superfamily as a whole as a cosmopolitan distribution, as do some of its constituent families, such as Scenopinidae and Therevidae. Other families have more restricted distributions. For example, the only species of Evocoidae occurs in Chile.

== Phylogeny ==
The ancestral lifestyle for asiloid larvae is believed to be parasitoidism, with this being replaced by predation in all families except Bombyliidae.

It is not entirely clear that this superfamily is monophyletic. It is closely related to the Empidoidea and the Cyclorrhapha.

Within the superfamily, the &quot;therevoid clade&quot; (Apsilocephalidae, Evocoidae, Scenopinidae and Therevidae) forms a monophyletic group, with Evocoidae being the sister group to Apsilocephalidae and Therevidae sister to Scenopinidae. This clade diverged from other Asiloidea at the end of the Jurassic period (&quot;c&quot;. 150 million years ago), and its two pairs of families diverged from each other at the beginning of the Cretaceous (144 million years ago).

==Families==

* Apioceridae – flower-loving flies
* Apsilocephalidae
* Apystomyiidae
* Asilidae – robber flies
* Bombyliidae – bee flies
* Evocoidae
* Hilarimorphidae
* Mydidae – mydas flies
* Mythicomyiidae
* Scenopinidae – window flies
* Therevidae – stiletto flies

The Protapioceridae, a family of extinct flies that were native to China, are also classified in the Asiloidea.

<text>Marjorie Henderson Buell (née Marjorie Lyman Henderson, December 11, 1904 – May 30, 1993) was an American cartoonist who worked under the pen name Marge. She was best known as the creator of &quot;Little Lulu&quot;.

==Early life==

Marjorie Lyman Henderson was born in 1904 in Philadelphia to Horace Lyman Henderson and Bertha Brown Henderson. She and her two sisters grew up on a farm outside Malvern. The three sisters drew comics for birthday cards and family events while they were growing up. At the age of 8 she began selling her work to friends. She attended and then graduated from Villa Maria Academy High School in 1921.

==Career==

At 16, she sold her first cartoon to the &quot;Public Ledger&quot;. Her work appeared in humor magazines and other periodicals, including &quot;Collier&#x27;s&quot;, &quot;Judge&quot;, &quot;Life&quot;. She also created illustrations for &quot;Country Gentleman&quot; and &quot;Ladies&#x27; Home Journal&quot;. By the late 1920s, she worked under the name &quot;Marge&quot; and had a syndicated comic strip, &quot;The Boy Friend&quot;, her first syndicated comic strip, which ran from 1925 through 1926. This and another strip of hers, &quot;Dashing Dot&quot;, both featuring female leads. Marge was friends with &quot;Oz&quot; author Ruth Plumly Thompson and illustrated her fantasy novel &quot;King Kojo&quot; (1933).

In 1934, &quot;The Saturday Evening Post&quot; requested Buell to create a strip to replace Carl Anderson&#x27;s &quot;Henry&quot;. Buell created a little girl character in place of &quot;Henry&quot;″s little boy as she believed &quot;a girl could get away with more fresh stunts that in a boy would seem boorish&quot;. The first single-panel installment ran in the &quot;Post&quot; on February 23, 1935; in it, Lulu appears as a flower girl at a wedding and strews the aisle with banana peels. The single-panel strip continued in the &quot;Post&quot; until the December 30, 1944, issue, and continued from then as a regular comic strip. Buell retained the rights, unusual for the time. Buell marketed &quot;Little Lulu&quot; widely throughout the 1940s. Buell herself ceased drawing the strip in 1947, and in 1950 &quot;Little Lulu&quot; became a daily syndicated by Chicago Tribune–New York News Syndicate and ran until 1969. After she stopped drawing the strip, Buell herself drew Lulu only for the lucrative Kleenex advertisements.
Paramount Pictures approached Buell in 1943 with a proposal to develop a series of animated shorts. She traveled to New York to meet with Paramount executives and tour the animation facilities, and there was introduced to William C. Erskine, who became her business representative.

Thereafter, Little Lulu was widely merchandised, and was the first mascot for Kleenex tissues; from 1952 to 1965 the character appeared in an elaborate animated billboard in Times Square in New York City designed by Artkraft Strauss.

The character appeared in comic books, animated cartoons, greeting cards and more. &quot;Little Lulu&quot; comic books, popular internationally, were translated into Arabic, Dutch, Finnish, French, Japanese, Norwegian, Portuguese, Spanish, Swedish and Greek. Buell stopped drawing &quot;Little Lulu&quot; in 1947, and the work was continued by others, while she kept creative control. Sketching and writing of the &quot;Little Lulu&quot; comic book series was taken on by John Stanley, who later drew &quot;Nancy and Sluggo&quot;. Buell sold her &quot;Little Lulu&quot; rights to Western Publishing when she retired in 1971.

==Personal life==
On 30 January 1935, she married Clarence Addison Buell who had a career in the Bell Telephone Company. The two reached a compromise in their career ambitions, in that the husband agreed to turn down promotions that would result in relocation, and the wife would keep her creation enough in check that she would be available for her children. The couple had two sons: Larry, born in 1939; and Fred, born in 1942.

She shied from the spotlight, rarely giving interviews or allowing publication of photos of herself. She also shied away from politics, and resisted requests from her sons to include progressive elements such as a black playmate for Lulu or overtly feminist themes. Her son Larry stated in 2007 that &quot;she didn&#x27;t think of Lulu as a part of politics. She drew a line between entertainment and didacticism.&quot; 

After the sale of the Lulu copyrights in 1971, the Buell couple retired to Ohio, where Larry lived. Buell died May 30, 1993, of lymphoma in Elyria, Ohio. Buell&#x27;s son Larry is a professor of American Literature at Harvard, and her son Fred is a professor of English at Queens College.

==Legacy==
The nonprofit organization Friends of Lulu (1994–2011) was named after Little Lulu — the organization, which was dedicated to promoting the readership of comic books by women and the participation of women in the comic book industry, chose its name based on the repeated trope of Little Lulu trying to break into the boys&#x27; clubhouse, where girls aren&#x27;t allowed. In 2000, Marge was inducted into Friends of Lulu&#x27;s Women Cartoonists Hall of Fame.

In July 2006, Buell&#x27;s family donated the &quot;Marge Papers&quot; to the Schlesinger Library at Harvard University. The papers include a collection of fan mail, comic books, scrapbooks of high points in Lulu&#x27;s history and a complete set of the newspaper cartoons.

In 2005, Heritage Auctions sold the original art to the first Little Lulu panel for $9,200. In recent years, Buell&#x27;s original art from Little Lulu panels regularly bring between $2,000-$3,000 at auction.

<text>Wallace Wilfred Swinburne Breem (13 May 1926 – 12 March 1990) was a British librarian and author.

He was the &quot;Librarian and Keeper of Manuscripts&quot; of the Inner Temple Law Library. His writing included non-fiction pieces, but he is probably best known for his three historical novels, especially &quot;Eagle in the Snow&quot; (1970).

==Career==
Breem was born in Kingston, Surrey and was educated at Westminster School.

At the age of 18, he entered the Indian Army&#x27;s Officers Training School. In 1945 he was commissioned as an officer of the Guides Cavalry, the elite cavalry regiment, serving on the North West Frontier in armoured cars.

In 1947, following the Partition of India, Breem returned to England and held a variety of jobs, which included: a labourer in a tannery, an assistant to a veterinary surgeon, and a rent-collector in the East End of London. He joined the library staff of the Inner Temple, in London, in 1950.

Breem was a founder member of BIALL (British and Irish Association of Law Librarians), and at various times held the offices of: secretary, treasurer, chairman, vice-president, and president in that organization.

<doc id="787967" wikidata="Q1276240" url="?curid=787967" title="Society for Humanistic Judaism">
<text>The Society for Humanistic Judaism (SHJ), founded by Rabbi Sherwin Wine in 1969, is an American 501(c)(3) organization and the central body of Humanistic Judaism, a philosophy that combines a non-theistic and humanistic outlook with the celebration of Jewish culture and identity while adhering to secular values and ideas.

The SHJ assists in organizing new communities, supporting its members, and providing a voice for Humanistic Jews. It gathers and creates educational and programmatic materials for topics including holidays and rites of passage, and sponsors training programs and conferences for its members. The Humanistic Youth Group (&quot;HuJews&quot;) subdivision offers programs for teens and young adults, including an annual conclave. The SHJ publishes a monthly online newsletter and a biannual topical journal and member newsletter.

The Society participates in both the Jewish and non-religious worlds as a Hillel International partner, a participant in the General Assembly of the Jewish Federations of North America, and a member of the Secular Coalition for America. Miriam Jerris is the current rabbi of the SHJ.

== Humanorah ==
The Humanorah is the primary symbol of Humanistic Judaism used by the SHJ, intended as a non-theistic alternative to other Jewish symbols such as the Star of David or the tablets of the Ten Commandments. It was developed and trademarked by the SHJ and has been its logo since the early 1980s. Its name is a portmanteau of &quot;human&quot; and &quot;menorah&quot;, representing the convergence of humanism with Jewish identity. The symbol itself is a combination of these two elements; a human figure stands with its arms raised, while two other branches cross over its torso to form a total of six arms, with stylized flames emerging from all six arms.

== Congregations ==
In 1994, the SHJ had 10,000 members across 30 congregations in the United States and Canada. Current notable congregations include Or Emet in Minneapolis, the City Congregation for Humanistic Judaism in New York City, Kahal B&#x27;raira in Boston, Oraynu Congregation for Humanistic Judaism in Toronto, Kol Shalom in Portland, and Machar in Washington, D.C. There are also numerous congregations around the world, such as in the UK and Australia, though not all Humanistic Judaism congregations are affiliated with the SHJ.

==Views==
Humanistic Judaism is noted for its highly egalitarian approach to issues such as gender and gender identification, Jewish status, sexual orientation, and other social issues.

===Jewish traditions===
Within Humanistic Judaism, Jewish identity is largely a matter of self-identification. A statement on the website Humanistic Rabbis says that Humanistic Jews believe &quot;[that] Jewish identity is primarily a cultural and ethnic identity, [that] belief systems are too diverse among Jews to serve as criteria for membership, [that] joining the Jewish community is a process of cultural identification, [and that] a person who seeks to embrace Jewish identity should be encouraged to do so and should be assisted in this endeavor&quot;. 

Both Jews and non-Jews, as well as members of the LGBTQIA community, are able to participate in all Humanistic Jewish rituals and undertake leadership roles in any capacity.

Humanistic Jewish rabbis and other leaders officiate at marriages between Jews and non-Jews and (unlike Conservative and Orthodox Jews) do not take any position on interfaith marriage, stating, &quot;Intermarriage is an American Jewish reality—a natural consequence of a liberal society in which individuals have the freedom to marry whomever they wish... that intermarriage is neither good nor bad, just as we believe that the marriage of two Jews, in itself, is neither good nor bad. The moral worth of a marriage always depends on the quality of the human relationship—on the degree of mutual love and respect that prevails.&quot; Secular humanistic rabbis and leaders can also co-officiate at these marriages. These views on Jewish identity and intermarriage are criticized by those who believe that they will hasten the assimilation of Jews into general society and thus adversely affect Jewish continuity.

The traditional Jewish infant circumcision brit milah is not performed in Humanistic Judaism, instead being replaced by the more modern baby-naming ceremony brit shalom.

Humanistic Judaism ordains both men and women as rabbis, and its first female rabbi Tamara Kolton was ordained in 1999. Its first cantor was also a woman, Deborah Davis, who was ordained in 2001. Humanistic Judaism has since stopped ordaining cantors, but does today ordain lifecycle officiants and has a broader program of training Jewish leaders.

===Abortion===
Humanistic Judaism takes a pro-choice stance on the issue of abortion. A statement issued by the SHJ in 1996 said, &quot;We affirm that a woman has the moral right and should have the continuing legal right to decide whether or not to terminate a pregnancy in accordance with her own ethical standards. Because a decision to terminate a pregnancy carries serious, irreversible consequences, it is one to be made with great care and with keen awareness of the complex psychological, emotional, and ethical implications.&quot; The SHJ issued a statement in 2011 condemning the passage of the No Taxpayer Funding for Abortion Act, calling it a &quot;direct attack on a woman&#x27;s right to choose.&quot;

===LGBT+ rights===
In 2004, the SHJ issued a resolution supporting the legal recognition of both same-sex marriage and same-sex divorce, affirming its belief in &quot;the value of marriage between any two committed adults with the sense of obligations, responsibilities, and consequences thereof.&quot; In 2010, the SHJ pledged to speak out against homophobia.

===Religious exemptions===
In 2012, the SHJ issued a statement opposing conscience clauses that allow religious-affiliated institutions to be exempt from providing reproductive healthcare services to individuals or their employees. It said, &quot;We rely upon evidence-based medicine to promote responsible reproductive healthcare policies. [...] We believe that healthcare institutions (defined as including but not limited to insurers, managed-care providers, hospitals, pharmacies) should not be able to use religion as a way to deny legitimate and lawful reproductive healthcare and accurate medical information concerning reproductive healthcare to patients who do not share the same religious or moral beliefs.&quot;

===Women&#x27;s equality===
In 2013, the SHJ issued a statement to say it &quot;wholeheartedly supports the observance of Women&#x27;s Equality Day on August 26 to commemorate the anniversary of the passage of the Nineteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution allowing women to vote.&quot; It also said that it &quot;condemns gender discrimination in all its forms, including restriction of rights, limited access to education, violence, and subjugation,&quot; and commits itself to &quot;maintain vigilance and speak out in the fight to bring gender equality to our generation and to the generations that follow.&quot;

===Drug use===
In 2021, the SHJ issued a statement calling for the complete decriminalization of cannabis for both medical and recreational purposes.

<text>Grandparents, individually known as grandmother and grandfather, or Grandma and Grandpa, are the parents of a person&#x27;s father or mother – paternal or maternal. Every sexually reproducing living organism who is not a genetic chimera has a maximum of four genetic grandparents, eight genetic great-grandparents, sixteen genetic great-great-grandparents, thirty-two genetic great-great-great-grandparents, sixty-four genetic great-great-great-great-grandparents, etc. In the history of modern humanity, around 30,000 years ago, the number of modern humans who lived to be a grandparent increased. It is not known for certain what spurred this increase in longevity, but it is generally believed that a key consequence of three generations being alive together was the preservation of information which could otherwise have been lost; an example of this important information might have been where to find water in times of drought.

In cases where parents are unwilling or unable to provide adequate care for their children (e.g., financial obstacles, marriage problems, illness or death), grandparents often take on the role of primary caregivers. Even when this is not the case, and particularly in traditional cultures, grandparents often have a direct and clear role in relation to the raising, care and nurture of children. Grandparents are second-degree relatives to their grandchildren and share 25% genetic overlap.

A step-grandparent can be the step-parent of the parent or the step-parent&#x27;s parent or the step-parent&#x27;s step-parent (though technically this might be called a step-step-grandparent). The various words for grandparents at times may also be used to refer to any elderly person, especially the terms &quot;gramps&quot;, &quot;granny&quot;, &quot;grandfather&quot;, &quot;granddad&quot;, &quot;grandmother&quot;, &quot;nan&quot;, &quot;maw-maw&quot;, &quot;paw-paw&quot; (and others which families make up themselves).

==Titles==
When used as a noun (e.g., &quot;... a grandparent walked by&quot;), grandfather and grandmother are usually used, although forms such as grandma/grandpa, granny/granddaddy or even nan/pop are sometimes used. When preceded by &quot;my ...&quot; (e.g., &quot;... my grandpa walked by&quot;), all forms are common (anywhere from &quot;... my grandfather ...&quot; to &quot;... my Gramps ...&quot;). All forms can be used in plural, but Gramps (plural Gramps) is rare.

In writing, &quot;Grandfather&quot; and &quot;Grandmother&quot; are most common, but very rare as a form of address. In speech, &quot;Grandpa&quot; and &quot;Grandma&quot; are commonly used in the United States, Canada, and Australia. In Britain, Ireland, United States, Australia, New Zealand and, particularly prevalent in the Canadian province of Newfoundland and Labrador and English-speaking Quebecers, &quot;Nan&quot;, &quot;Nana&quot;, &quot;Nanna&quot;, &quot;Nanny&quot;, &quot;Gran&quot; and &quot;Granny&quot; and other variations are often used for grandmother in both writing and speech.

In Bangladesh, Pakistan, and many parts of India, maternal grandparents are called &quot;Nana&quot; and &quot;Nani&quot;. Similarly, paternal grandparents are called &quot;Dada&quot; and &quot;Dadi&quot;. One&#x27;s parents&#x27; maternal grandparents are called &quot;Par-nani&quot; and &quot;Par-nana&quot;. On similar lines, parents&#x27; paternal grandparents are called &quot;Par-dadi&quot; and &quot;Par-dada.&quot;

Numerous other variants exist, such as &quot;Granny&quot;, for grandmother. &quot;Gogo&quot; may be used for either. 

Given that people may have two living sets of grandparents, some confusion arises from calling two people &quot;grandma&quot; or &quot;grandpa&quot;, so often two of the other terms listed above are used for one set of grandparents. Another common solution is to call grandparents by their first names (&quot;Grandpa George&quot;, &quot;Grandma Anne&quot;, etc.) or by their family names (&quot;Grandpa Jones&quot;, &quot;Grandma Smith&quot;). In North America, many families call one set of grandparents by their ethnic names (e.g., Hispanic grandparents might be called &quot;abuelo&quot; and &quot;abuela&quot; or &quot;abuelito&quot; and &quot;abuelita&quot;, French grandparents might be called &quot;papi&quot; and &quot;mamie&quot;, Italian grandparents might be called &quot;nonno&quot; and &quot;nonna&quot;, or Dutch and German grandparents might be called &quot;Opa&quot; and &quot;Oma&quot;. In Flanders pepee or petje and memee or metje are most used). In Friesland, a common pair is pake and beppe. Northern Chinese people often use &quot;laolao&quot; and &quot;laoye&quot;, while Mandarin-speaking Southerners often use &quot;wài pó&quot; (外婆, mother&#x27;s mother) and &quot;wài gōng&quot; (外公, mother&#x27;s father), to refer to maternal grandparents; paternal grandparents usually are called &quot;nǎi nai&quot; (奶奶, father&#x27;s mother) and &quot;yé yé&quot; (爷爷, father&#x27;s father). In the Philippines, grandparents are called &quot;lolo&quot; (grandfather) and &quot;lola&quot; (grandmother).

Languages and cultures with more specific kinship terminology than English may distinguish between paternal grandparents and maternal grandparents. For example, in the Swedish language there is no single word for &quot;grandmother&quot;; the mother&#x27;s mother is termed &quot;mormor&quot; and the father&#x27;s mother is termed &quot;farmor&quot;. However, the other Scandinavian languages, Danish and Norwegian, use words which specify the kinship like in Swedish (identically spelled among all three languages), as well as using common terms similar to grandmother (Danish: bedstemor, Norwegian: bestemor).

==Great-grandparents and beyond==

The parents of a grandparent, or the grandparents of a parent, are called the same names as grandparents (grandfather/-mother, grandpa/-ma, granddad/-mom, etc.) with the prefix &quot;great-&quot; added, with an additional &quot;great-&quot; added for each additional generation. One&#x27;s great-grandparent&#x27;s parents would be &quot;great-great-grandparents&quot;.

To avoid a proliferation of &quot;greats&quot; when discussing genealogical trees, one may also use ordinals instead of multiple &quot;greats&quot;; thus a &quot;great-great-grandfather&quot; would be the &quot;second great-grandfather&quot;, and a &quot;great-great-great-grandfather&quot; would be a third great-grandfather, and so on. This system is used by some genealogical websites such as Geni. One may also use cardinal numbers for numbering greats, for example, great-great-great-grandmother becomes 3×-great-grandmother.

Individuals who share the same great-grandparents but are not siblings or first cousins are &quot;second cousins&quot; to each other, as second cousins have grandparents who are siblings. Similarly, &quot;third cousins&quot; would have great-grandparents who are siblings, and &quot;fourth cousins&quot; would have great-great-grandparents who are siblings.

==Etymology==
The use of the prefix &quot;grand-&quot; dates from the early 13th century, from the Anglo-French &quot;graund&quot;. The term was used as a translation of Latin &quot;magnus&quot;. The prefix represents a direct translation of Anglo-French &quot;graund&quot; and Latin &quot;magnus&quot; to English. In Old English, the prefixes &quot;ealde-&quot; (old) and &quot;ieldra-&quot; (elder) were used (&quot;ealdefæder&quot;/&quot;-mōdor&quot; and &quot;ieldrafæder&quot;/&quot;-mōdor&quot;). A great-grandfather was called a &quot;þridda fæder&quot; (third father), a great-great-grandfather a &quot;fēowerða fæder&quot; (fourth father), etc.

===Variation===
* maternal grandmother- mother&#x27;s mother.
* maternal grandfather- mother&#x27;s father.
* paternal grandmother- father&#x27;s mother.
* paternal grandfather- father&#x27;s father.

== Involvement in childcare ==

Grandparents are changing their roles in contemporary world, especially as they are becoming increasingly involved in childcare. According to a 2012 study based on 2010 census and survey data, around 10% of children in the U.S. live in a household including a grandparent. Of these, approximately a third live in a household consisting of two parents and a grandparent. Likewise, more than 40% of grandparents across 11 European countries care for their grandchildren in the absence of the parents. In Britain, around 63% of grandparents care for their grandchildren who are under 16 years old. Grandparent involvement is also common in Eastern societies. For instance, 48% of grandparents in Hong Kong reported that they are taking care of their grandchildren. In China, around 58% of Chinese grandparents who are aged 45 or older are involved in childcare. In Singapore, 40% of children from birth to three years old are cared by their grandparents and this percentage is still increasing. In South Korea, 53% of children under the age of 6 years old are cared by their grandparents. Therefore, grandparents taking care of their grandchildren has become a prevalent phenomenon around the world.

There are a few reasons why grandparent involvement is becoming more prevalent. First, life expectancy has increased while fertility rates have decreased. This means that more children are growing up while their grandparents are still alive and able to become involved in childcare. In addition, the reduced fertility rates mean that grandparents can devote more attention and resources to their only grandchildren. Second, more mothers are involved in the workforce, and thus, other caregivers need to be present to care for the child. For instance, in Hong Kong, 55% of grandparents reported that they took care of their grandchild because his or her parents have to work. In South Korea, 53% of working mother reported that they once received child care services from their parents. Third, the increasing number of single-parent families creates a need for grandparental support.

The degree of grandparent involvement also varies depending on the societal context, such as the social welfare policies. For example, in European countries such as Sweden and Denmark, where formal childcare is widely available, grandparents provide less intensive childcare. By contrast, in European countries such as Spain and Italy, where formal childcare is limited, and welfare payment is low, grandparents provide more intensive childcare. In Singapore, the grandparent caregiver tax relief was established in 2004, which enables working parents (Singapore citizens with children age 12 and below) whose children are being cared for by unemployed grandparents to receive income tax relief of 3,000 Singaporean dollars.

===Types===
There are different types of grandparental involvement, including nonresident grandparents, co-resident grandparents, grandparent-maintained household, and custodial grandparents.

* Nonresident grandparents: Grandparents who do not live with their grandchildren, but provide care for them, such as picking them up from school.
* Co-resident grandparents: Grandparents who live with their grandchild, as well as their parents. This type of household is also known as three-generational households. According to a report that uses data from the 2010 Census, the American Community Survey (ACS), the Current Population Survey (CPS), and the Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP), co-resident grandparents are more likely to be in poverty and suffer from an illness or disability.
* Grandparent-maintained households: A grandparent who is in charge of the household. In this type of household, the parents may or may not be present. In the US, 33% of children who live in a grandparent-maintained household have only the grandparents present; this is comparable to another 30% who live with a grandmother and one or more parents.
* Custodial grandparents: Grandparents who raise their grandchildren without the presence of the grandchildren&#x27;s parents in the household. This type of involvement is especially common among ethnic minority groups. For instance, approximately 50% of custodial grandparents in the USA belong to an ethnic minority group. In general, grandparents adopt the primary caregiving role for various reasons, such as when the parents have died, been imprisoned, been deployed by the military, or lost custody of their children due to neglect or abuse.

=== Impact ===
==== On grandchildren ====
Grandparents have different functions in child development. Not only do they provide instrumental support such as picking grandchildren up from school or feeding them, but they also offer emotional support. Furthermore, grandparents protect children from being impacted by negative circumstances, such as harsh parenting, poor economic status, and single-parent families. In addition to providing support, grandparents can also help grandchildren with their schoolwork or teach them values that are integral to their society.

Grandparents can have a positive or negative impact on child development. On the one hand, previous research suggests that children and adolescents who have a close relationship with their grandparents tend to have better well-being, experience fewer emotional problems, and demonstrate fewer problematic behaviours. They are also more academically engaged and are more likely to help others. On the other hand, there are also research studies indicating that grandparent involvement is associated with more hyperactivity and peer difficulties among young children. In other words, children who are cared for by their grandparents can have more interpersonal relationship problems. Also, children who are under the care of their grandparents have poorer health outcomes such as obesity, and more injuries due to low safety awareness.

==== On grandparents ====

Since taking care of grandchildren could be a highly demanding job that requires constant energy and time devotion, grandparental involvement in child raising could have a negative impact on grandparents&#x27; physical and emotional health. For example, taking care of grandchildren can reduce grandparents&#x27; own time for self-care such as missing their medical appointments. Therefore, they are likely to have a higher chance to suffer from physical health issues. In the US, compared with those who do not take care of their grandchildren, grandparents who are involved in childcare are more likely to have poor physical conditions, such as heart disease, hypertension or body pain. Besides physical health issues, grandparents are also likely to have emotional issues. To be more specific, raising young children again could be a stressful and overwhelming experience and thus results in different kinds of negative emotions such as anxiety or depression. In addition to physical and emotional issues, grandparents who are involved in caring for their grandchildren can also suffer socially. For instance, grandparents will be forced to limit their social activities so as to care for their grandchildren. By doing so, grandparents become more isolated from their social relations. Taking care of grandchildren also means more responsibilities, grandparents would fear for their grandchildren&#x27;s future well-being because of their disability and death in the future. If grandparents cannot handle the caregiver role of their grandchildren well, this job can eventually become a burden or stressor and bring more severe physical health and emotional issues to grandparents.

However, there are also positive effects of being involved in grandchildren raising. Compared with grandparents who do not provide caregiving to their grandchildren, those who take care of their grandchildren with long hours are more likely to have better cognitive functions. To be more specific, taking care of grandchildren helps elder grandparents maintain their mental capacities in later life, they are also less likely to develop diseases such as dementia. Moreover, frequent interactions with their grandchildren could reduce the cognitive aging process, allowing grandparents a chance to live a more vibrant and active life. Grandparents also get benefits of physically exercising more during this process.

Taking care of grandchildren can also have benefits on grandparents&#x27; emotional health. As an example, many grandparents start to feel a sense of purpose and meaning in life again after their retirement; as another example, their ties with their adult children and grandchildren are also strengthened. Many grandparents also think of the caregiving experience as positive because it provides another chance for them to make up mistakes they made with their own children and give them more opportunities to educate their grandchildren and improve their parenting styles.

== Cultural comparisons ==
Grandparental involvement differs between Western and Eastern cultures. Grandparents taking care of their grandchildren is a common phenomenon in China due to Chinese traditions which emphasize family harmony, collective well-being, intergenerational exchanges and filial responsibilities. China&#x27;s unique philosophies, Buddhism and Taoism, play important roles in forming these cultural values. While Chinese Buddhism emphasizes prioritized role of the family in Chinese society and harmonious relations among family members, Taoism emphasizes the importance of harmony in interpersonal relations and relations between nature and the humans. These philosophies underline the important role that families play in Chinese cultures. Besides cultural factors, grandparents taking care of their grandchildren also appears in the context in which their adult children need to work full-time, and the child care services are either too expensive (in big cities) or too scarce (in remote areas). Grandparents serving as their grandchildren&#x27;s caregiver is particularly common in rural China. Due to the fast development of urbanization in China since the 1980s, up to 220 million migrant workers from rural areas move to urban areas to seek for more job opportunities, which leave around 58 million children behind in rural areas, grandparents, therefore, undertake the role of parents and become caregivers to their grandchildren. A new population named &quot;left-behind grandparents&quot; appears in this context, these grandparents live in rural China, and their main job is to look after their grandchildren, most of these grandparents are facing financial burdens and wish their adult children could come back. The mental and physical health of &quot;left-behind grandparents&quot; needs more attention from the public. Even though in urban areas where child care services are available, nearly all grandparents still prefer to take care of their grandchildren voluntarily. Not only because this can reduce their adult children&#x27;s financial burdens on child care services but also taking care of their own grandchildren is a more effective way to maintain family harmony.

=== In United States ===
In the US, taking care of grandchildren is not a necessary responsibility of grandparents. Grandparents taking care of their grandchildren is often caused by involuntary events or crisis, and it is more like a solution to a problem, not an initiative desire, which is a distinct difference from that in China. For example, grandparents in the USA often take care of their grandchildren when their adult children get into troubles such as substance abuse, incarceration or parental death. Differences also exist in different ethnicities in the US. Caucasian individuals generally regard individual independence as more important, so grandparents are less likely to take care of their grandchildren. However, African American and Latino individuals are more likely to regard looking after grandchildren as a family tradition and are more willing to provide help for their adult children. Ethnic differences in grandparents looking after their grandchildren reflect different cultural values that different ethnic groups hold. To be more specific, African American grandparents are more likely to provide guidance and discipline to their grandchildren due to their flexible family system in which relatives, nonblood kin are all willing to help each other. Latino families have a strong preference to live together and keep frequent contact with family members because most of them are immigrants or first-generation born in the US, they are more likely to live and function as a unit. Grandparents in Latino culture also play important roles in stabilizing the family unit as family leaders. Although Caucasian grandparents are less likely to raise their grandchildren, they have more cognitive or physical burdens of taking care of grandchildren compared with other ethnic groups, mainly because their caregiver roles are less normative, and they rely more on remote or companionate parenting styles. On the contrary, African American and Latino grandparents rely more on disciplinary and instructional parenting styles and they are less likely to have cognitive or physical burdens when taking care of their grandchildren.

=== In France ===

The representation of grandparents as grandparents is recent in France: Diderot invented the verbs grandpériser and grandmériser in the 18th century. Victor Hugo published &quot;L&#x27;Art d&#x27;être grand-père&quot; in 1877.
According to French parish registers and civil status records, at the end of the 18th century, a little more than half of the grandparents were alive at the birth of their grandchild, a third when the child was 10 years old, and still 10% at 20 years old. In rural France at the end of the 18th century, the majority of family systems were of the nuclear family type (grandparents did not cohabit in the family home, they were only welcomed there at the end of their lives). However, in regions such as Alsace, the west of Brittany, Occitania, or the Savoy region, the systems were more complex, with the stem family in particular: the home housed a succession of family nuclei, the patriarch having authority over this home, which could lead to conflict. These cohabitations were therefore managed from the time of marriage by notarial acts that provided for &quot;clauses of insupport&quot; to share the domestic space and tasks in case of conflict. 

In the cities of the 19th century, there was generally no cohabitation (with the exception of noble families and their lineage logic, a model that declined after 1850), but bourgeois families often housed all the family branches in the same building (they met with their grandparents at the family home during cousinades) while in the working class, grandparents lived in the same neighborhood, family solidarity remaining strong: the mother working outside the home, the children were often cared for by the grandparents. 

The Civil code recognizes few rights for grandparents with regard to parental authority in France, but case law from the 1850s has influenced family legislation: a Court of Cassation ruling on July 8, 1857 recognized the right of grandparents to visit, but this right was only enshrined following the law of January 4, 1970 as part of a general overhaul of family laws in France.

Thus, the lineage-based vision of grandparents in the 18th century was succeeded by the &quot;indulgent grandparent&quot; vision in the centuries that followed. This is reflected in the institutionalization of visits and vacations with grandparents, the use of tu (informal &quot;you&quot;) by grandchildren to address grandparents, which developed gradually in the 19th century, the advent of affectionate names (papi and mami, pépé and mémé, papet and mamé in the south of France) given to the baby boomer generation from the 1970s, or the increase in grandparental care, which marks a greater emotional closeness and the de-hierarchization of relationships.

=== In Switzerland ===
In Switzerland, the relationship between grandchildren and grandparents is protected by Article 274a of the Swiss Civil Code: 
&quot;In exceptional circumstances, the right to maintain personal relations may also be granted to other persons, in particular, to members of the family, provided that this is in the best interests of the child.&quot;
Grandparents wishing to benefit from a right of custody must demonstrate in court that these exceptional circumstances are effective. As a simple third party, grandparents do not have a legal right to visit in Switzerland. A motion was rejected in September 2012.

<text>Henry Stanbery (February 20, 1803 – June 26, 1881) was an American lawyer from Ohio. He was Ohio&#x27;s first attorney general from 1846 to 1851 and the United States Attorney General from 1866 to 1868.

A native of New York City who was raised in Zanesville, Ohio, Stanbery graduated from Washington College in 1819 at age 16, studied law with two Zanesville attorneys, and attained admission to the bar as soon as he reached the minimum required age of 21.

Stanbery resided for many years in Lancaster, where he practiced law in partnership with Thomas Ewing. Stanbery was selected by the state legislature to serve as Ohio&#x27;s first state attorney general, a post he held from 1846 to 1851. After leaving office he relocated to the Cincinnati area, where he continued to practice law.

In 1866, Stanbery was appointed U.S. Attorney General. He served until 1868 and worked to sustain President Andrew Johnson&#x27;s view that the president should control post-Civil War Reconstruction, and that the former Confederate states should be readmitted to the Union even if they took no steps to guarantee rights to former slaves. In 1868, Stanbery resigned so he could join Johnson&#x27;s defense team during his impeachment trial. Johnson was acquitted, and Johnson attempted to reappoint him as attorney general, but the U.S. Senate would not confirm him.

After Johnson left office, Stanbery returned to the Cincinnati area, where he continued to practice law until failing eyesight curbed his activities in 1880. He traveled to New York City for surgery to remove cataracts, which did not improve his vision, and he was blind for the last six months of his life. He was residing temporarily in New York City while continuing to seek treatment when he died on June 26, 1881. Stanbery was buried at Spring Grove Cemetery in Cincinnati.

==Early life==
Henry Stanbery was born in New York City on February 20, 1803, a son of Jonas Stanbery, a physician and land speculator, and his second wife Ann Lucy (McCready) Seaman Stanbery. The family moved to Zanesville, Ohio, in 1814, and Stanbery revealed himself to be a precocious student while attending a special private school. At age 12, he began attendance at Washington College in Washington, Pennsylvania (now Washington and Jefferson College), where he was a member of the Union Literary Society.

==Legal career==
===Start===
After his 1819 college graduation, Stanbery studied law in Zanesville first with attorney Ebenezer Granger, and after Granger&#x27;s death with Charles B. Goddard. He was admitted to the bar in 1824, and began to practice with Thomas Ewing in Fairfield County, Ohio.

===Ohio Attorney General===
In 1846, the Ohio General Assembly elected Stanbery to serve as Ohio Attorney General, the first person to hold the post. He moved from his home in Lancaster to the state capital of Columbus to assume his new duties. As the initial holder of the position, Stanbery spent much of his time and effort on determining its duties and responsibilities and organizing his staff. His work included creation of a case-tracking system and uniform crime report format for county prosecutors and a successful lobbying campaign to obtain the power to negotiate with individuals and corporations that were in debt to the state. Once he obtained this power in 1848, Stanbery cleared a backlog of existing lawsuits and cases by entering into agreements for partial payment or payment over time.

In 1850 he was elected a delegate to the 1850-1851 state constitutional convention. In 1853 he moved to Cincinnati, and in 1857 he moved across the Ohio River to Fort Thomas, Kentucky, where he owned an elegant hilltop mansion, &quot;The Highlands&quot;.

===U.S. Supreme Court nomination===
On April 16, 1866, President Andrew Johnson nominated Stanbery as an associate justice on the United States Supreme Court, to fill the vacancy created by the death of John Catron. The Republicans who controlled Congress were at odds with Johnson over post-Civil War Reconstruction. Therefore, rather than consider the Stanbery nomination, Congress instead passed the Judicial Circuits Act in July 1866 reducing the size of the Supreme Court.

Prior to being nominated, in March 1866, Stanbery assisted Attorney General James Speed in arguing &quot;Ex parte Milligan&quot; before the Supreme Court. In its decision the Court held that military tribunals for civilian defendants were illegal in jurisdictions where the civilian criminal justice system was functioning.

===U.S. Attorney General===
Johnson then nominated Stanbery for Attorney General, and he was confirmed by the U.S. Senate.

Stanbery loyally supported Johnson during his longstanding fight with Congress over Reconstruction. He assisted in drafting Johnson&#x27;s veto of the first Reconstruction Act. After Congress overrode Johnson&#x27;s vetoes of the first and second Reconstruction Acts, Stanbery provided opinions containing narrow interpretations bolstering Johnson&#x27;s position on the issue. In Johnson&#x27;s view, the president had responsibility for Reconstruction, and he intended to return the former Confederate states to the Union and full Congressional representation as soon as possible, without guaranteeing the rights of the former slaves who had been freed during the war. Stanbery agreed, arguing that the federal government had no right to interfere with the states in their administration of their governments and legal systems. Congress determined to take control of Reconstruction, compel former Confederates to prove their loyalty before readmission to the Union, and protect the rights of African Americans. In the third Reconstruction Act, which Johnson and Stanbery opposed, Congress limited the president&#x27;s authority with respect to post-war Reconstruction and became predominant in the process.

As Attorney General, he argued &quot;Mississippi v. Johnson&quot; (1867), which held that the separation of powers barred the Supreme Court from issuing an injunction against the President when he implemented Reconstruction by executive action, in effect leaving Reconstruction as a political matter to be decided between the president and Congress. In &quot;Georgia v. Stanton&quot; (1868), Stanbery successfully argued that the court did not have jurisdiction over the political question of Reconstruction, which again left the matter to the executive and legislative branches.

===Andrew Johnson impeachment trial===

When Congress moved to impeach Johnson as the result of the Reconstruction dispute, Stanbery resigned as attorney general on March 12, 1868, and joined his defense team. An illness limited Stanbery&#x27;s participation in Johnson&#x27;s trial, but he submitted several opinions and arguments in writing to aid Johnson&#x27;s other attorneys. Much of his effort focused on ensuring that Johnson received due process, which had the effect of slowing the proceedings and making a conviction in the heat of the moment less likely. By the time Johnson was acquitted, Stanbery had rejoined the team, and he took part in several pro-Johnson celebrations.

After the trial, Johnson renominated Stanbery for Attorney General, but the U.S. Senate refused to confirm him. Stanbery then returned to Ohio to resume his law practice.

==Later career==
Stanbery returned to the Cincinnati area, where he resumed practicing law and served as president of the city&#x27;s bar association from 1873 to 1876. He wrote occasional articles on political and legal questions, and also delivered lectures and speeches. He was also a longtime member of St. Paul&#x27;s Episcopal Church in Newport, Kentucky.

==Retirement and death==
In his later years, Stanbery&#x27;s eyesight worsened as the result of cataracts, and his wife and he moved to New York City to seek treatment. He underwent surgery to remove the cataracts, but his eyesight continued to fail until he was blind for the last six months of his life. He continued to reside in New York City while seeking treatment, but died there on June 26, 1881, after bronchitis left him unable to breathe while on a carriage ride in Central Park. He was buried at Spring Grove Cemetery in Cincinnati.

==Family==
Stanbery was married in 1829 to Frances E. Beecher of Lancaster, a daughter of Philemon Beecher. They had five children - Frances E., Henry, Philemon B., Louisa, and George - the last three of whom survived him. Frances Beecher Stanbery died in 1840, and in 1841 Stanbery married Cecilia Key Bond, a daughter of William Key Bond.

Henry Stanbery&#x27;s half-brother William Stanbery was also an attorney, and served in the United States House of Representatives from 1827 to 1833.

<doc id="787983" wikidata="Q4831398" url="?curid=787983" title="Aylestone">
<text>Aylestone is a suburb of Leicester in Leicestershire, England, southwest of the city centre and east of the River Soar. 

St Andrew&#x27;s Church, Aylestone dates from the 13th century. The area around the church retains much of the former village character. It is largely surrounded by Victorian housing close to the city centre (Aylestone Park) and by 20th-century housing in other directions.

The electoral ward of Aylestone covers Old Aylestone village (including the conservation area), the Gilmorton estate, the south and west of Aylestone Park (the remainder is in Saffron ward) and the southwest side of Saffron Lane (to Grace Road). The ward borders Saffron and Eyres Monsell wards and the county parish of Glen Parva and is in the parliamentary constituency of Leicester West. The ward has two elected councillors: currently these are Councillor Scott Kennedy-Lount (Liberal Democrat, first elected 2023) and Councillor Nigel Porter (formerly Conservative, from 2011 a Liberal Democrat).

==History==
The name &#x27;Aylestone&#x27; comes from the Anglo-Saxon &#x27;Aegel&#x27;s settlement&#x27; or &#x27;Egil&#x27;s settlement&#x27;. Aylestone was recorded in the Domesday Book as &quot;Ailstone&quot;, held in the reign of Edward the Confessor by Alveva, Countess of Mercia. In 1086 it was held by Robert de Beaumont, 1st Earl of Leicester. The manor passed from Robert to his son Robert le Bossu, thence to Bossu&#x27;s son Robert Blanchemains and finally to Blanchemains&#x27; son, Robert FitzPernel. FitzPernel died without issue, and his estates were divided between his two sisters, the manor of Aylestone passing to Margaret, who married Saer de Quincy, 1st Earl of Winchester. The manor passed by marriage into the hands of the Harcourt family, and then the Pembrugge family of Tong, Shropshire. On the death of Fulke de Pembrugge IV in 1409, the manor passed to his wife Isabel. Fulke and Isabel having no issue, the manor eventually passed to the grandson of Fulk&#x27;s sister Juliana, Richard Vernon III. Aylestone remained in the hands of the Vernon family until the death of Sir George Vernon in 1565. His daughter Dorothy having married John Manners, second son of the 1st Earl of Rutland, Aylestone passed to the Manners family, who later became the Dukes of Rutland.

The estate was sold by the 6th Duke of Rutland, the sale being held at the Temperance Hall in Leicester on 26 June 1869.

The Leicester Extension Act of 1891 incorporated Aylestone into the Borough of Leicester. The village had at this time an area of 1,723 acres. On 26 March 1896 the civil parish was abolished and merged with Leicester.

Aylestone&#x27;s open fields were enclosed in 1766. about this time Aylestone was the chosen route into Leicester Town for the supply of coal from the areas around Bagworth, Desford and Swannington which was carried in by Packhorse &quot;trains&quot; who crossed, on the Aylestone packhorse bridge, the (sometimes swampy) flood plain area now known as Aylestone Meadows.

During the English Civil War/War of Three Kingdoms King Charles 1 of England and Prince Rupert used Aylestone Hall as their headquarters during the siege and storming of Parliamentarian Leicester Town by the main Royalist field army on 30 and 31 May 1645. Aylestone Hall was occupied by a ladies&#x27; boarding school in 1846. When the estate was sold in 1869 the hall was occupied by a tenant, Nathaniel Stone, who purchased it. From 1871 to 1938 the hall was occupied by the Stretton family. It was requisitioned by the army during World War II. In 1950 Leicester City Council purchased it, and after renovation the hall and the grounds were opened in 1954 as a public park, with a restaurant and a clubhouse for the local bowling club.

Aylestone Hall was renovated again in 2003, and converted into three separate dwellings and a clubhouse. It had been assumed that much of the hall&#x27;s medieval fabric had been destroyed when alterations were made in 1850. However early timber framing, including parts of an aisled hall, were found during a preliminary investigation. The timbers were dated by dendrochronology to 1339. The hall has a mid-16th-century cross wing of stone in a timber frame, and was re–roofed in the late 17th century, using many of the original 14th-century timbers. Many of the seemingly Tudor architectural features, such as the star–shaped chimneys, were introduced during the rebuilding of 1850. It was the home of Dorothy Vernon and John Manners.
A 15th-century packhorse bridge at the west end of Marsden Lane crosses the River Soar on eleven arches.

Aylestone Park is an area of housing approximately a mile square, which grew between Leicester and Aylestone village and which has housing generally built since 1875.

Aylestone Meadows is a large area of playing fields and water-meadow nearby, and contributes to the semi-rural character of the suburb. In 2003 they were designated a Local Nature Reserve. Plans by Leicester City Council to bulldoze an area within the Aylestone Meadows to make way for an artificial sports pitch, single storey clubhouse and car park, were defeated on 21 March 2011 when the Planning Committee rejected the plans. Many groups including the Aylestone Meadows Appreciation Society, Leicester Friends of the Earth, Leicestershire &amp; Rutland Wildlife Trust, the Leicester Civic Society, and the Campaign for Rural England, all helped rally support against the plans. It was the first time that an E-Petition on Leicester City Council&#x27;s website had ever been used.

===Demography===
In 2001, the ward of Aylestone had a population of 10,801.
The population of the parish in 1871 was 450, in 1881 it was 2,546 and in 1891 it was 5,381.

===Culture and community===
The Aylestone Boathouse, a large wooden building, was built c. 1911 by Gordon Biggs on the site of a canal wharf close to Middleton Street. Rollers were installed by the side of King&#x27;s Lock to allow boats to be transferred to the River Soar from the canal. Later a brick-built ballroom and restaurant, and tennis courts, were added. The building was used as an engineering works during World War II. The boathouse was demolished c.1980. The ballroom became a bingo hall, and was eventually demolished and replaced by housing.

==Transport==

From Aylestone the canalised River Soar flows northwards to the River Trent. Southwards the Soar was too shallow for navigation, and a canal was dug from a junction with the river just north of the packhorse bridge to Market Harborough, where it connected with the Grand Junction Canal. The section from Loughborough to Aylestone and Blaby was opened in 1794, and the section to Market Harborough in 1809.

A horse tram service to Grace Road was started on 7 June 1878. The tramlines were extended to Belvoir Drive in 1884. Leicester Corporation took over the system in 1901, and converted it to electric traction in May 1904, at which time it was extended to a terminus at Wigston Lane. Services ceased on 5 January 1947.

The Great Central Railway passed near to the village, on an embankment between and high. Although the line opened for passenger traffic on 15 March 1899, no station was provided at Aylestone. The nearest stations were Leicester Central and Whetstone.

Arriva Midlands operate frequent buses into Leicester on services 84, 85 and 87 all running along Aylestone Road while Centrebus 83/83A routes also operate at infrequent times into the nearby Gilmorton Avenue estate.

==Education==
In 1786 the assistant curate of St Andrew&#x27;s, William Bickerstaffe, and 58 householders petitioned the 4th Duke of Rutland to establish a Charity School at Aylestone for 30 children. In 1844 a National School was opened on land given by the 5th Duke, off Church Road (then called School Road). It had about 40 boys and 50 girls. The school was enlarged in 1881 to accommodate 170 boys, 170 girls and 300 infants, and was run by the Aylestone School Board. It was closed in 1891, when the schools in Aylestone were taken over by the Leicester School Board.

In 1879 the Aylestone School Board applied to open two more schools; these were in Landsdown Road (1881) and Granby Road (1889). The Leicester Education Authority built two schools, at Knighton Fields Road West and Wigston Lane, before 1939.

==Religious sites==

The Anglican church, St Andrew&#x27;s, is built of grey-green Triassic sandstone. The tower and north aisle are 13th-century; the aisle was enlarged in the 14th century when the chancel was built. In the 15th century a clerestory and a south aisle were added. The tower is surmounted by a broach spire whose base is inset behind a parapet. The chancel, built circa 1300–1310, is taller, longer and wider than the nave.

The Roman Catholic church of St Edward the Confessor opened on 3 May 1922. This replaced temporary premises in Knighton Lane (a bake house and later a room over a stable) which had been used since 1915 as chapels. The church was served by the Dominicans of Holy Cross Priory, Leicester, until 1937 when the parish was taken over by the Roman Catholic Diocese of Nottingham.

The Baptists of Aylestone originally met, from 1855, in a cottage belonging to a Mr and Mrs Crosher in The Hollow. By 1868 the cottage was recorded as being in disrepair. In 1869 a lean-to brick building adjoining a cottage in The Hollow was acquired; this held about 50 people. At the same time a plot of land on Sanvey Gate was purchased for the building of a chapel- this, the Aylestone Baptist Chapel, was built in 1871. A new church and school building was built on Lutterworth Road in 1932, and opened in February 1933. The old church was sold in 1934, and became a clubhouse. It was acquired by the Apostolic Church in 1974.

The Church of the Nativity, on Cavendish Road, Aylestone Park, is a combined Methodist and Anglican church, formed as a Local ecumenical partnership (LEP).

==Geography==

Aylestone is the name of two output areas used in the UK Census. One, code 00FNNG, is centred on the Leicester location; the other, code 00GANY, is centred on Aylestone Hill (), Herefordshire.

==Sport==
Of the two local football teams, St Andrew&#x27;s FC has a pitch on Disraeli St, off Church Road, Aylestone. Their local rivals Aylestone Park F.C are located on Saffron Lane, Leicester.

<doc id="787988" wikidata="Q1982544" url="?curid=787988" title="William Harrison Standley">
<text>William Harrison Standley (18 December 1872 – 25 October 1963) was an admiral in the United States Navy, who served as Chief of Naval Operations from 1933 to 1937. He also served as the U.S. ambassador to the Soviet Union from 1941 until 1943.

==Early life==
Standley was born in Ukiah, California, where his grandfather operated a hotel and his father, Jeremiah &quot;Doc&quot; Standley, was Mendocino County Sheriff.

He graduated from the United States Naval Academy in 1895. He then served the required two years&#x27; sea duty in the cruiser before he received his commission as an ensign in 1897.

==Spanish–American War==
During the Spanish–American War, Standley served in the monitor and later in the gunboat . After the fighting with Spain had ended, he joined the gunboat during the Philippine–American War. He received a commendation for bravery during a volunteer reconnaissance mission carried out at Baler, on 11 April 1899. In conjunction with a feint conducted by Lieutenant J. C. Gilmore, Standley, then an ensign, ventured into enemy territory to reconnoiter insurgent positions.

==Peacetime==
Ordered to the gunboat on 29 May 1901, Standley later became Officer in Charge, Branch Hydrographic Office, San Francisco, California, in October of the same year. Assigned to the training ship in June 1902, he later served as engineer in the ship and as aide to the Commandant of the Naval Station at Tutuila, Samoa. Designated as the captain of the yard there in 1905, Standley discharged his duties as officer in charge of the native guard and chief customs officer until detached with orders to the United States in October 1906.

Reporting to the receiving ship in January 1907, Standley served as executive officer of the cruiser from February 1909 to August 1910. From January 1910, he also discharged duties as &quot;Albany&quot;&#x27;s navigator as well. Standley then reported to the armored cruiser on 3 November 1910 and was navigator of that ship until becoming aide to the Commandant of the Mare Island Navy Yard at Vallejo, California. After three years in that post, Standley became executive officer of the battleship and later took command of the gunboat &quot;Yorktown&quot; on 15 May 1915.

==World War I==
Returning to the Naval Academy on 14 October 1916, as Assistant to the Superintendent in charge of Building and Grounds, Standley later served for 11 months as Commandant of Midshipmen. Under his direction, the new seamanship and navigation buildings were constructed and over $4,000,000 spent in enlarging Bancroft Hall to accommodate the increased number of midshipmen appointed during the World War I period. For his &quot;highly meritorious&quot; service in those posts at Annapolis, Standley received a special letter of commendation from the Secretary of the Navy.

Detached from the Naval Academy in July 1919, Standley soon thereafter assumed command of the pre-dreadnought battleship and, a year later, received orders to attend the Naval War College. After completing his studies at Newport, Standley returned to sea, serving as Assistant Chief of Staff to the Commander in Chief, Battle Fleet, from 5 July 1921 to 30 June 1923, before he reported to Washington for duty heading the War Plans Division in the Office of the Chief of Naval Operations (CNO). Completing the latter tour on 1 February 1926, Standley then commanded from 15 February 1926 to 11 October 1927.

Standley returned to shore duty in Washington, D.C., as Director of the Fleet Training Division, Office of the CNO, and held that post until 14 May 1928. He then served as Assistant CNO until 17 September 1930, when he became Commander, Destroyer Squadrons, Battle Fleet, a title that changed to Commander, Destroyers, Battle Force, United States Fleet, on 1 April 1931, with additional duty as Commander, Destroyers, United States Fleet. Designated as a member of the Navy Department&#x27;s Selection Board on 18 November 1931, Standley became Commander, Cruisers, Scouting Forces, with additional duties as Commander, Cruisers, U.S. Fleet, and Commander, Cruiser Division 5, on 16 December of the same year.

Appointed vice admiral, on 20 January 1932 while in command of the Battle Force&#x27;s cruisers, Standley was placed in command of the Battle Force, U.S. Fleet, with the rank of admiral, on 20 May 1933. Breaking his flag in his former command, &quot;California&quot;, the admiral remained at sea until 1 July 1933, when President Franklin Roosevelt appointed him Chief of Naval Operations, replacing William V. Pratt.

Unlike Pratt, who had been content being &quot;primus inter pares&quot; among the bureau chiefs of the Navy, Standley asserted his position over them and treated them as his subordinates. This sat ill with Standley&#x27;s opponents who felt that they were subordinate to the Secretary of the Navy, including William D. Leahy, then chief of the Bureau of Navigation, and Ernest King, then the newly appointed chief of the Bureau of Aeronautics. The argument grew severe enough for Standley to bring it directly to the President who decided to uphold the status quo and the CNO&#x27;s limited authority. For his part, Standley never forgave Leahy for contesting him, even trying to prevent him from being appointed as Commander, Battleships, Battle Force. He continued to persist in doing so amid the support of Secretary Claude A. Swanson and the commander of the United States Fleet, Joseph M. Reeves. This was eventually overcome and Leahy assumed his intended position with the rank of vice admiral as planned.

From 1935 to 1936 he served as President of the Army Navy Country Club in Arlington, Virginia.

Before being retired, at his own request, on 1 January 1937 and handing over the reins of office to Admiral William D. Leahy, Admiral Standley frequently performed the duties of Acting Secretary of the Navy, due to the declining health of Secretary of the Navy Claude A. Swanson. Standley represented the United States as a delegate to the London Naval Conference between 7 December 1935 to 25 March 1936 and signed that accord on behalf of the United States. In addition, during his tenure as CNO, Standley initiated the Vinson–Trammell Naval Bill that provided for establishing, building, and maintaining the navy at treaty strength.

==World War II==
Recalled to active duty on 13 February 1941, Standley served as naval representative on the planning board of the Office of Production Management (OPM) for seven months. After leaving the OPM in the autumn of 1941, Standley served as the American naval member on the Beaverbrook-Harriman Special War Supply Mission to the Soviet Union. Upon his return, Standley became a member of the Navy Board for Production Awards.

When President Roosevelt established the Roberts Commission to investigate the attack on Pearl Harbor, he selected Admiral Standley as one of the members of that sensitive body that studied the attack into early 1942. In February 1942, Standley was appointed American Ambassador to the USSR, a post he held into the autumn of 1943. Standley resigned after making controversial remarks in which he angrily claimed that the Soviets were taking full credit for the war against Germany.&quot;The Russian authorities seem to want to cover up the fact that they are receiving outside help. Apparently, they want their people to believe that the Red Army is fighting this war alone.&quot;Subsequently recalled to active duty once more, in March 1944, Standley served in the Office of Strategic Services throughout the remaining period of hostilities. Relieved of all active duty on 31 August 1945, Standley lived in retirement at San Diego, California, until his death on 25 October 1963. After the war, he became involved with various anti-communist groups, including the Moral Re-Armament.

==Legacy==
The cruiser was named in his honor. Admiral William Standley State Recreation Area, a California state recreation area, is also named for him, as is Standley middle school in San Diego. There is also a City of San Diego Recreation Center named in his honor.

<doc id="787995" wikidata="Q737115" url="?curid=787995" title="Prime Minister of Estonia">
<text>The prime minister of Estonia () is the head of government of the Republic of Estonia. The prime minister is nominated by the president after appropriate consultations with the parliamentary factions and confirmed by the parliament (&quot;Riigikogu&quot;). In case of disagreement, the parliament can reject the president&#x27;s nomination and choose their own candidate. In practice, since the prime minister must maintain the confidence of parliament in order to remain in office, they are usually the leader of the senior partner in the governing coalition. The current prime minister is Kristen Michal of the Reform Party. He took the office on 23 July 2024 following the resignation of Kaja Kallas.

The prime minister does not head any specific ministry. Rather, in accordance with the constitution, the prime minister supervises the work of the government. The prime minister&#x27;s significance and role in the government, and his or her relations with other ministries, often depend on the position of the party led by the prime minister relative to its coalition partners, and on how much influence the prime minister possesses within one&#x27;s own party. If the prime minister has a strong position within one&#x27;s party, and the government is made up solely of representatives of that party, the prime minister can enjoy considerable authority. In all crucial national questions, at least formally, the final word rests with the parliament as the legislative power.

Unlike counterparts in other parliamentary republics, the prime minister of Estonia is both &quot;de jure&quot; and &quot;de facto&quot; chief executive. This is because the constitution explicitly vests executive power in the government, of which the prime minister is the leader. In most other parliamentary republics, the president is at least nominal chief executive, while bound by convention to act on the cabinet&#x27;s advice.

==History==
After Estonia declared independence from the then warring Russian and German Empires in 1918, the Provisional Government of Estonia was led by a Prime Minister until 1920. The 1920 Constitution set up a head of government whose position called the State Elder (&quot;riigivanem&quot;) and there was no separate head of state. This system was a radically parliamentary system because the State Elder could be dismissed by the Riigikogu with a simple majority. Moreover, the State Elder was not the Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces, nor could they ratify laws or dissolve the Riigikogu. The dissolution of Parliament was only possible through a referendum. Under the 1934 Constitution passed by plebiscite, the position of Prime Minister was recreated as head of government in a more presidential system. Under this constitution, the head of state took the name State Elder (&quot;riigivanem&quot;) identical to the name for the 1920–1934 head of government. The newly established head of state could appoint and dismiss the Prime Minister and Cabinet, veto laws, give decrees (statutes) and dissolve the Riigikogu. The incumbent Prime Minister in duties of the State Elder of Estonia Konstantin Päts, staged a self-coup to counter the threat of the Vaps Movement and suspended the full implementation of the 1934 Constitution, not going ahead with elections for the new head of state and suspending the parliament. Päts remained the Prime Minister in duties of the State Elder 1934–1937, and as President-regent (&quot;riigihoidja&quot;) for 1937–1938. According to the 1938 Constitution, the position of the Prime Minister was retained, while the head of state was finally renamed the President under a presidential system. The 1992 Constitution after the Soviet occupation reinstated the 1938–1940 positions of Prime Minister and President under a parliamentary system.

<doc id="787997" wikidata="Q255355" url="?curid=787997" title="Kenny Burrell">
<text>Kenneth Earl Burrell (born July 31, 1931) is an American jazz guitarist known for his work on numerous top jazz labels: Prestige, Blue Note, Verve, CTI, Muse, and Concord. His collaborations with Jimmy Smith were notable, and produced the 1965 &quot;Billboard&quot; Top Twenty hit Verve album &quot;Organ Grinder Swing&quot;. He has cited jazz guitarists Charlie Christian, Oscar Moore, and Django Reinhardt as influences, along with blues guitarists T-Bone Walker and Muddy Waters.

Burrell is a professor and Director of Jazz Studies at the UCLA Herb Alpert School of Music.

==Early life==
Burrell was born in Detroit. Both his parents played instruments, and he began playing guitar at the age of 12 after listening to Charlie Christian&#x27;s recordings. During World War II, due to metal shortage, he abandoned the idea of becoming a saxophonist, and bought an acoustic guitar for $10. He was inspired to play jazz after listening to Oscar Moore, but it was Django Reinhardt who showed him &quot;that you could get your own individuality on an instrument.&quot; He went on to study composition and theory with Louis Cabara and classical guitar with Joe Fava. While a student at Wayne State University, he made his recording debut as a member of Dizzy Gillespie&#x27;s sextet in 1951, followed by the &quot;Rose of Tangier&quot;/&quot;Ground Round&quot; single recorded under his own name at Fortune Records in Detroit. While in college, Burrell founded the New World Music Society collective with fellow Detroit musicians Pepper Adams, Donald Byrd, Elvin Jones, and Yusef Lateef.

==Career==

Burrell toured with Oscar Peterson after graduating in 1955 and then moved to New York City in 1956 with pianist Tommy Flanagan. Within months, Burrell had recorded his first album as leader for Blue Note and both he and Flanagan were sought-after as sidemen and studio musicians, performing with singers Tony Bennett and Lena Horne and recording with Billie Holiday, Jimmy Smith, Gene Ammons, and Kenny Dorham, among others. From 1957 to 1959, Burrell occupied the former chair of Charlie Christian in Benny Goodman&#x27;s band. Since his New York debut Burrell has had a prolific recording career, and critics have cited &quot;The Cats&quot; with John Coltrane in 1957, &quot;Midnight Blue&quot; with Stanley Turrentine in 1963, and &quot;Guitar Forms&quot; with arranger Gil Evans in 1965 as particular highlights.

In 1978, he began teaching a course at UCLA called &quot;Ellingtonia,&quot; examining the life and accomplishments of Duke Ellington. Although the two never collaborated directly, Ellington called Burrell his &quot;favorite guitar player,&quot; and Burrell has recorded a number of tributes to and interpretations of Ellington&#x27;s works. Since 1996, Burrell has served as Director of Jazz Studies at UCLA, mentoring such notable alumni as Gretchen Parlato and Kamasi Washington.

==Awards and honors==
Burrell wrote, arranged, and performed on the 1998 Grammy Award-winning album &quot;Dear Ella&quot; by Dee Dee Bridgewater, received the 2004 Jazz Educator of the Year Award from &quot;Down Beat&quot;, and was named a 2005 NEA Jazz Master.

Burrell was a Grammy Salute To Jazz Honoree in 2010. The Grammy website states that between &quot;...1956 and 2006, Mr. Burrell has excelled as a leader, co-leader and sideman releasing recordings with stellar musicians in the world of jazz.&quot;

==Personal life ==
In 2019, concerns arose about Burrell&#x27;s well-being and living circumstances as he became increasingly socially and physically isolated in his home and major frictions developed between his wife, Katherine Goodrich, 37 years his junior, and others living in their Westwood apartment building. A GoFundMe account was set up to pay medical bills and other putative expenses, which became controversial because he was covered by medical insurance through employment at UCLA and through Medicare. Subsequently, a letter from Burrell was published, providing a detailed explanation of the situation and justification for the GoFundMe campaign. Burrell refuted claims that he was unaware of the GoFundMe campaign or that his wife was isolating him. He explained that his limited public appearances were due to medical advice and his focus on writing during his sabbatical from UCLA.

<text>Richard Jay Schaap (September 27, 1934 – December 21, 2001) was an American sportswriter, broadcaster, and author.

==Early life and education==
Born to a Jewish family in Brooklyn, and raised in Freeport, New York, on Long Island, Schaap began writing a sports column aged 14 for the weekly newspaper &quot;Freeport Leader&quot;, but the next year he obtained a job with the daily newspaper &quot;The Nassau Daily Review-Star&quot; working for Jimmy Breslin. He would later follow Breslin to the &quot;Long Island Press&quot; and &quot;New York Herald Tribune&quot;.

He attended Cornell University, where he served as editor-in-chief of &quot;The Cornell Daily Sun&quot;, the student newspaper. He obtained a letter in varsity lacrosse playing goaltender. During his last year at Cornell, Schaap was elected to the Sphinx Head Society. After graduating in 1955, he received a Grantland Rice fellowship at the Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism and authored his thesis on the recruitment of basketball players.

==Career==
Schaap began work as assistant sports editor of &quot;Newsweek&quot;. In 1964, he began a thrice-weekly column concerning current events. He became editor of &quot;SPORT&quot; magazine in 1973. It was then that he set in motion the inspiration for the eccentricities of Media Day at the Super Bowl. Opposing the grandiose and self-important nature of the National Football League&#x27;s championship match, he hired two Los Angeles Rams players, Fred Dryer and Lance Rentzel, to cover Super Bowl IX. Donning costumes inspired by &quot;The Front Page&quot;, &quot;Scoops Brannigan&quot; (Dryer) and &quot;Cubby O&#x27;Switzer&quot; (Rentzel) peppered players and coaches from both the Minnesota Vikings and Pittsburgh Steelers with questions that ranged from the clichéd to the downright absurd. Schaap was also a theatre critic, causing him to quip that he was the only person ever to vote for both the Tony Awards and the Heisman Trophy. He interviewed non-sports people such as Matthew Broderick and produced cultural features for ABC&#x27;s overnight news program &quot;World News Now&quot;.

After spending the 1970s with NBC as an &quot;NBC Nightly News&quot; and &quot;Today Show&quot; correspondent, he moved to &quot;ABC World News Tonight&quot; and &quot;20/20&quot; at ABC in the 1980s. He earned five Emmy Awards, for profiles of Sid Caesar and Tom Waddell, two for reporting, and for writing. In 1988 he began hosting &quot;The Sports Reporters&quot; on ESPN cable television, which in later years often featured his son Jeremy as a correspondent. He also hosted &quot;Schaap One on One&quot; on ESPN Classic and a syndicated ESPN Radio program called &quot;The Sporting Life with Dick Schaap&quot;, in which he discussed the week&#x27;s developments in sports with Jeremy. He also occasionally served as a substitute anchor for ABC&#x27;s late night newscast, &quot;World News Now&quot;.

He wrote the 1968 best-seller &quot;Instant Replay&quot;, co-authored with Jerry Kramer of the Green Bay Packers, and &quot;I Can&#x27;t Wait Until Tomorrow... &#x27;Cause I Get Better-Looking Every Day&quot;, the 1969 autobiography of New York Jet Joe Namath. These resulted in a stint as co-host of &quot;The Joe Namath Show&quot;, which in turn led to his hiring as sports anchor for WNBC-TV. Other books included a biography of Robert F. Kennedy; &quot;.44&quot; (with Jimmy Breslin), a fictionalized account of the hunt for Son of Sam killer David Berkowitz; &quot;Turned On&quot;, about upper middle-class drug abuse; &quot;An Illustrated History of the Olympics&quot;, a coffee-table book on the history of the modern Olympic Games; &quot;The Perfect Jump&quot;, on the world record-breaking long jump by Bob Beamon in the 1968 Summer Olympics; &quot;My Aces, My Faults&quot; with Nick Bollettieri; &quot;Steinbrenner!&quot;, a biography of mercurial New York Yankees owner George Steinbrenner; and &quot;Bo Knows Bo&quot; with Bo Jackson. His autobiography, &quot;Flashing Before My Eyes: 50 Years of Headlines, Deadlines &amp; Punchlines&quot;, was reissued under Schaap&#x27;s original title &quot;Dick Schaap as Told to Dick Schaap: 50 years of Headlines, Deadlines and Punchlines.&quot;

==Death==
Schaap died on December 21, 2001, at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City of complications from hip replacement surgery that September. Schaap&#x27;s final regular television appearance was on the September 16 broadcast of &quot;The Sports Reporters&quot; on the Sunday after the September 11 attacks on New York City and Washington, D.C. That weekend, all major American college and professional sporting events had been cancelled, and Schaap and his panelists discussed the diminished role of sports since the tragedy.

After Schaap&#x27;s death, his estate and members of his family filed a lawsuit against three physicians and Lenox Hill Hospital, alleging that his death had been caused by medical malpractice. Specifically, they alleged that, for two years before his surgery, Schaap had been given a powerful medication called amiodarone to treat an irregular heartbeat. Amiodarone can cause lung damage (known as &quot;amiodarone pulmonary toxicity&quot;) and, according to the plaintiffs, an X-ray of Schaap&#x27;s chest that had been taken before the surgery indicated that he had lung damage. Three days after the surgery, Schaap began having difficulty breathing, and he was subsequently diagnosed with acute respiratory distress syndrome. He died three months after the operation, never having left the hospital. Among other claims, the plaintiffs contended that Schaap&#x27;s surgery should have been postponed, that he should have been taken off the amiodarone, and that his lungs should have been given time to heal before the performance of the surgery.

The court dismissed the claim against the hospital on the ground that the physicians were not employees of the hospital. The plaintiffs&#x27; claims against the three physicians went to trial in 2005 in Manhattan. On July 1, 2005, after nine days of deliberations, a jury found that all three physicians had been negligent, but also found that the negligence of only one of the physicians had caused Schaap&#x27;s death. That physician was a cardiologist who the plaintiffs had contended was negligent by not looking at the pre-operative chest X-ray. The jury awarded the plaintiffs a total of $1.95 million in damages.

==Personal life==
Schaap was married twice. His first wife was Madeline Gottlieb; their divorce was finalized in March 1981. Schaap remarried to Trish McLeod shortly thereafter. He was the father of six children—Renee, Michelle, Jeremy, Joanna, Kari and David—and had five grandchildren. Schaap&#x27;s younger brother was lawyer William Schaap. The jazz historian Phil Schaap was his cousin.

Around 1955, Schaap befriended Bobby Fischer, who was at the time a 12-year-old chess prodigy, and would later become a world chess champion. In 2005, prompted by questions posed by Schaap&#x27;s son Jeremy, Fischer acknowledged that the relationship was significant and that the elder Schaap had been a &quot;father figure&quot; to him. Fischer was still resentful that Dick Schaap had later written, among many other comments, that Fischer &quot;did not have a sane bone left in his body&quot;.

==Honors==
The Sports Emmy division of the National Academy of Television Arts and Sciences renamed their writing category &quot;The Dick Schaap Outstanding Writing Award.&quot; The 2005 Emmy Awards in this category was won by Jeremy for a SportsCenter piece called &quot;Finding Bobby Fischer.&quot;

In 2002, Schaap was honored posthumously by the Associated Press Sports Editors (APSE) with the Red Smith Award. In the same year, he was also inducted into the Nassau County Sports Hall of Fame, which created a Dick Schaap Award for Outstanding Journalism.

On June 8, 2015, Schaap was inducted posthumously in the National Sportscasters and Sportswriters Association&#x27;s Hall of Fame.

<text>Ragnar Tørnquist (born 31 July 1970) is a Norwegian video game designer and writer. He has been working for Funcom in Oslo since 1994, and founded his own studio Red Thread Games in November 2012.

==Biography==
Tørnquist studied art, history and English at St Clare&#x27;s, a school in Oxford, from 1987 to 1989. From 1989 to 1990, he studied philosophy and English at the University of Oslo. After that, from 1990 to 1993 he attended the Undergraduate Film and Television department at the New York University&#x27;s Tisch School of the Arts. His influences included Joss Whedon and Neil Gaiman.

In 1994, he returned to Oslo, Norway and started working for Funcom as producer, designer, writer, and level-editor of the video game adaptation of &quot;Casper&quot;. He felt that a new term was needed for a new generation of adventure games since &quot;the classic point-and-click &#x27;graphical adventure&#x27; is dead... The point of the &#x27;modern adventure&#x27; [...] is to bring adventure gaming back into the mainstream, and to use technology and gameplay advances to bring the genre forward into the &#x27;next generation&#x27;.&quot;

On 1 November 2012, Funcom announced that Tørnquist founded an independent game development studio Red Thread Games, which will continue developing &quot;The Longest Journey&quot; IP under license from Funcom. Simultaneously, Tørnquist stepped down as the Game Director of &quot;The Secret World&quot; to devote more time to the third entry in &quot;TLJ&quot; series, &quot;Dreamfall Chapters&quot;, while still working on &quot;TSW&quot; as the Creative Director.

Tørnquist is married and has one daughter.

<text>Karl Friedrich Abt (1743, in Stuttgart – 20 November 1783, in Bremen) was an actor in the Holy Roman Empire.

Abt began acting in 1766, mostly in southern and south-west Germany. In Biberach, he abducted his wife Felicitas from a reputable family which refused to give her away. She was born in 1746 in Biberach, and gained a reputation as an excellent actress and as the first German actress to play &quot;Hamlet&quot;.

Abt ventured through Saxony and Thuringia, finally opening up a stage in The Hague (Den Haag) with the support of the court and the high society on 16 October 1772 with the intention to introduce German theatre to the Netherlands. There, he greatly contributed to popularize German dramatic literature. On his stage, Abt played the first translations of Christian Felix Weiße&#x27;s &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot; and Lessing&#x27;s &quot;Emilia Galotti&quot;.

After a stay in Düsseldorf, the historical recordings find Abt again in 1773, travelling in Leiden where he had built a transportable wooden theatre. With this stage he continued travelling to &#x27;s-Hertogenbosch, Utrecht, Kleve, Nijmegen and finally again to The Hague where he was ruined by a local competitor. He travelled on to Haarlem where he found support from the &quot;Friends of the Arts&quot;. In Amsterdam, his performance was prohibited by the authorities. Abt visited several villages in North Holland, including Diemer-Meer near Amsterdam where he became very popular.

A severe illness in his family forced him to sell the theatre to private investors. There, Abt became an artistic supervisor. In 1776, this company also went bankrupt. He recruited a new troupe and settled in Münster, visiting Göttingen, Hanover, Bremen and other towns in the wider area. He lost the direction of the troupe in 1780, hired a new troupe in 1781 and continued travelling the area. Abt died in Bremen in 1783.

<text>The Irish Benevolent Society of [[London, Ontario]] is a philanthropic organization founded on March 1, 1877. Its purposes are to provide opportunities for Canadians of Irish descent and their friends to engage in benevolent activities and to preserve their Irish heritage.

The Society was unique at the time of its foundation in accepting both Roman Catholic and Protestant members. In much of Ontario sectarianism ruled, and continued to rule until well into the twentieth century, with the Orange Order pitted against Roman Catholic and other organizations. In fact, the constitution of the Society provides that presidents (who are elected for one year) must be alternately Roman Catholic and Protestant. The discussion of Irish politics has also been forbidden at meetings since the Society&#x27;s inception. The Society was immediately popular, and as a result of its popularity the importance of separate Protestant and Roman Catholic organizations in municipal politics was markedly reduced.

The Society&#x27;s chief fundraising event benefits the Lawson Health Research Institute, but it also helps many other institutions and individuals.

<doc id="788040" wikidata="Q24628" url="?curid=788040" title="Alex (parrot)">
<text>Alex (May 18, 1976 – September 6, 2007) was a grey parrot and the subject of a thirty-year experiment by animal psychologist Irene Pepperberg, initially at the University of Arizona and later at Harvard University and Brandeis University. When Alex was about one year old, Pepperberg bought him at a pet shop. In her book &quot;Alex &amp; Me&quot;, Pepperberg describes her unique relationship with Alex and how Alex helped her understand animal minds. Alex was an acronym for avian language experiment, or avian learning experiment.

Before Pepperberg&#x27;s work with Alex, it was widely believed in the scientific community that a large primate brain was needed to handle complex problems related to language and understanding; birds were not considered to be intelligent, as their only common use of communication was mimicking and repeating sounds to interact with each other. However, Alex&#x27;s accomplishments supported the idea that birds may be able to reason on a basic level and use words creatively. Pepperberg wrote that Alex&#x27;s intelligence was on a level similar to dolphins and great apes. She also reported that Alex seemed to show the intelligence of a five-year-old human in some respects, and had not reached his full potential by the time he died. She believed that he possessed the emotional level of a two-year-old human at the time of his death.

== Early life ==
Animal psychologist Irene Pepperberg bought Alex at a pet store after finishing her PhD in theoretical chemistry, with the intent of studying his cognitive and communicative abilities. She believes that Alex may have had his wings clipped when he was young, which could have prevented him from learning to fly.

== Training ==
Alex&#x27;s training used a model/rival technique, in which he observes trainers interacting. One of the trainers models the desired student behavior, and is seen by the student as a rival for the other trainer&#x27;s attention. The trainer and rival exchange roles so the student can see that the process is interactive. When a student (human or parrot) answers a question about an object correctly, they receive that object as a reward instead of a food reward, which is often used in other training techniques. Irene Pepperberg said the reward system is crucial, because it is the only way that students can make the direct connection between the object and the label that they have used. Food rewards are also sparingly used. Trainers sometimes make intentional mistakes so the students can see the consequences of an incorrect identification. Upon making a mistake, the trainer is scolded and the object is removed.

This technique helped Pepperberg succeed with Alex where other scientists had failed in facilitating two-way communication with parrots. In later years, Alex sometimes assumed the role of one of Pepperberg&#x27;s assistants by acting as the &quot;model&quot; and &quot;rival&quot; in helping to teach a fellow parrot in the lab, as well as correcting their mistakes. Alex sometimes practiced words when he was alone.

== Accomplishments ==
Pepperberg did not claim that Alex could use &quot;language&quot;, instead saying that he used a two-way communications code. Listing Alex&#x27;s accomplishments in 1999, Pepperberg said he could identify 50 different objects and recognize quantities up to six; that he could distinguish seven colors and five shapes, and understand the concepts of &quot;bigger&quot;, &quot;smaller&quot;, &quot;same&quot;, and &quot;different&quot;, and that he was learning &quot;over&quot; and &quot;under&quot;. Alex passed increasingly difficult tests measuring whether humans have achieved Piaget&#x27;s Substage 6 object permanence. Alex showed surprise and anger when confronted with a nonexistent object or one different from what he had been led to believe was hidden during the tests.

Alex had a vocabulary of over 100 words, but was exceptional in that he appeared to have understanding of what he said. For example, when Alex was shown an object and asked about its shape, color, or material, he could label it correctly. He could describe a key as a key no matter what its size or color, and could determine how the key was different from others. Looking at a mirror, he said &quot;what color&quot;, and learned the word &quot;grey&quot; after being told &quot;grey&quot; six times. This made him the first non-human animal to have ever asked a question, let alone an existential one (apes who have been trained to use sign-language have so far failed to ever ask a single question). 

Alex was said to have understood the turn-taking of communication and sometimes the syntax used in language. He named an apple a &quot;banerry&quot; (pronounced as rhyming with some pronunciations of &quot;canary&quot;), which a linguist friend of Pepperberg&#x27;s thought to be a combination of &quot;banana&quot; and &quot;cherry&quot;, two fruits he was more familiar with.

Alex could add, to a limited extent, correctly giving the number of similar objects on a tray. Pepperberg said that if he could not count, the data could be interpreted as his being able to estimate quickly and accurately the number of something, better than humans can. When he was tired of being tested, he would say &quot;Wanna go back&quot;, meaning he wanted to go back to his cage, and in general, he would request where he wanted to be taken by saying &quot;Wanna go ...&quot;, protest if he was taken to a different place, and sit quietly when taken to his preferred spot. He was not trained to say where he wanted to go, but picked it up from being asked where he would like to be taken.

If the researcher displayed irritation, Alex tried to defuse it with the phrase, &quot;I&#x27;m sorry.&quot; If he said &quot;Wanna banana&quot;, but was offered a nut instead, he stared in silence, asked for the banana again, or took the nut and threw it at the researcher or otherwise displayed annoyance, before requesting the item again. When asked questions in the context of research testing, he gave the correct answer approximately 80 percent of the time.

Once, Alex was given several different colored blocks (two red, three blue, and four green—similar to the picture above). Pepperberg asked him, &quot;What color three?&quot; expecting him to say blue. However, as Alex had been asked this question before, he seemed to have become bored. He answered &quot;five!&quot; This kept occurring until Pepperberg said &quot;Fine, what color five?&quot; Alex replied &quot;none&quot;. This was said to suggest that parrots, like humans, get bored. Sometimes, Alex answered the questions incorrectly, despite knowing the correct answer.

Preliminary research also seems to indicate that Alex could carry over the concept of four blue balls of wool on a tray to four notes from a piano. Pepperberg was also training him to recognize the symbol &quot;4&quot; as &quot;four&quot;. Alex also showed some comprehension of personal pronouns; he used different language when referring to himself or others, indicating a concept of &quot;I&quot; and &quot;you&quot;.

In July 2005, Pepperberg reported that Alex understood the concept of zero. If asked the difference between two objects, he also answered that; but if there was no difference between the objects, he said &quot;none&quot;, which meant that he understood the concept of nothing or zero. In July 2006, Pepperberg discovered that Alex&#x27;s perception of optical illusions was similar to human perception.

Pepperberg was training Alex to recognize English graphemes, in the hope that he would conceptually relate an English written word with the spoken word. He could identify sounds made by two-letter combinations such as SH and OR.

== Death ==
Alex was found dead in his cage on September 6, 2007, at age 31, appearing to have died sometime overnight. His death came as a surprise, as the average life span for a grey parrot in captivity is 45 years. His last words were &quot;You be good. I love you. See you tomorrow.&quot; which he would say every night when Pepperberg left the lab. The cause of death was stated to be arteriosclerosis.

== Criticisms ==
Some academics have expressed skepticism of Pepperberg&#x27;s findings and suggested that Alex&#x27;s communications is operant conditioning. Nim Chimpsky, a chimpanzee, was thought to be using language, but there is some debate over whether he simply imitated his teacher. Herbert Terrace, who worked with Nim Chimpsky, says he thinks Alex performed by rote rather than by using language; he claims Alex&#x27;s responses are &quot;a complex discriminating performance&quot;, adding that he believes that in every situation, &quot;there is an external stimulus that guides his response.&quot;

<text>Rudolf Albert Scharping (born 2 December 1947) is a German lawyer and politician of the Social Democratic Party (SPD).

He first rose to prominence as Minister President of Rhineland-Palatinate (1991–1994). He was his party&#x27;s federal chairman from 1993 to 1995 and in 1994 ran an, ultimately unsuccessful, effort to oust Chancellor Helmut Kohl in the federal elections. In 1998, he became Defence Minister in the government of Chancellor Gerhard Schröder but resigned shortly before the 2002 elections.

From March 1995 to May 2001, he served as chairman of the Party of European Socialists (PES).

==Early life and education==

Scharping was born in Niederelbert. He studied politics, sociology and law at the University of Bonn. His master&#x27;s thesis was on Social Democratic campaign techniques in Rhineland-Palatinate. He speaks English.

== Political career ==

===State politics===
Scharping joined the Social Democratic Party of Germany (SPD) in 1966. In 1968, he was expelled from the party for taking part in an antimilitary protest against a fund-raising concert for the German military band. However, after a year, he rejoined the party.

He was a member of the Landtag of Rhineland-Palatinate from 1975 to 1994. In 1985, he became his party&#x27;s chairman in the state and in 1991, the young, full-bearded man led his party to a surprise victory over the Christian Democrats, which had dominated state politics until then. Forming a coalition with the Free Democratic Party, Scharping was elected Minister-President on 21 May 1991 - an office he would hold until 15 October 1994.

===Federal party chairman===

In 1993, following the resignation of Björn Engholm, the SPD was in need of a new party chairman that would lead them into the federal elections approaching next year. Scharping&#x27;s success in turning in winning and governing a hitherto-CDU state, made him a candidate for that office. In a party-internal vote, Scharping won against Gerhard Schröder, the centrist Minister-President of Lower Saxony, and Heidemarie Wieczorek-Zeul, a representative of the party&#x27;s left wing. At the time, he was the youngest leader in party history.

In the 1994 elections, Scharping ran as the SPD&#x27;s candidate for Chancellor. As part of his campaign, he included his long-term rivals Gerhard Schröder and Oskar Lafontaine in his shadow cabinet. He made social justice the centerpiece of his campaign. Throughout the campaign, he refused to commit to a coalition partner. While the environmentalist Alliance 90/The Greens were widely seen as his party&#x27;s most likely partner, he himself had governed Rhineland-Palatinate in a coalition with the Free Democrats. Sharping promised that he would move into federal politics, even if he lost the election.

Scharping&#x27;s opponent in the elections was the CDU&#x27;s Helmut Kohl, who then had been Chancellor for twelve years, had forged German reunification in 1990 but whose popularity had taken hits due to ailing economic recovery in East Germany. By March 1994, the much younger Scharping held a 15-point lead over Kohl in the polls but eventually Kohl won the election, despite a decreased share in the vote.

True to his promise, Sharping resigned as Minister-President - his successor was Kurt Beck - and became leader of the opposition in Bonn. In his capacity as chairman of the SPD parliamentary group, he also served on the Committee on the Election of Judges (&quot;Wahlausschuss&quot;), which is in charge of appointing judges to the Federal Constitutional Court.

As chairman of the SPD, Scharping spoke out against the Euro that would leave Germany with a currency weaker than the Deutsche Mark.

As leader of the opposition, Sharping was increasingly faced with criticism within his own party. While he preferred a centrist course aiming at capitalising on mistakes made by the Christian Democrats, more left-wing members and others sought a more confrontative approach, dubbing Scharping&#x27;s line a &quot;Schmusekurs&quot; (cuddling course). After the SPD did not perform well in several state elections, Scharping was ousted from the party leadership at the 1995 federal party conference at Mannheim, Oskar Lafontaine, the Saarland&#x27;s more left-leaning Minister-President (and himself a former, failed candidate for chancellor) addressed the party members in a rousing speech, to which Scharping&#x27;s reflective mode seemed dry and boring. The next, Lafontaine defeated Scharping in an upset vote. Scharping, however, was elected as one of five vice-chairmen and retained that office in 1997, 1999 and 2001. Scharping also visually marked this defeat by shaving off his full beard.

===Minister of Defence, 1998–2002===
From 27 October 1998 to 18 July 2002, Scharping served as Germany&#x27;s Minister of Defence in the government of Chancellor Gerhard Schröder. His tenure saw the first time that the German Bundeswehr fully participated in a war, as NATO bombed Yugoslavia to stop Serbian policies in the Kosovo region. This involvement proved very controversial among the German population, especially among the environmentalist and pacifict Alliance 90/The Greens, that were part of Schröder&#x27;s cabinet. Scharping defended the bombing of Yugoslavia in reference to Operation Horseshoe, which later turned out to have likely been a hoax.

In 1999, Scharping established a government-appointed independent commission headed by former President Richard von Weizsäcker to develop recommendations on the reform of the Bundeswehr.

By July 1999, Scharping was widely considered the leading candidate to become the new Secretary General of NATO; however, he declined that position.

During a visit to United States Secretary of Defense William Cohen in 2000, Scharping was injured and briefly hospitalized after a steel security barrier sprang up beneath his motorcade as it arrived for an honors ceremony at the Pentagon.

In 2001, Scharping was criticized publicly by Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld when he was found to be the source of a report that the United States would intervene in Somalia as part of the campaign against terrorism.

==Resignation==

In what was later called &quot;Majorca Affair&quot;, Scharping had his picture taken in the swimming pool in company of his girlfriend Kristina Countess Pilati while the Bundeswehr was about to begin a difficult mission in Republic of Macedonia. He subsequently faced an investigation in parliament in over claims that he improperly used military planes to visit Pilati in Majorca and in Frankfurt.

Ahead of the 2002 elections, Schröder dismissed Scharping after weekly magazine &quot;Stern&quot; reported that he had accepted some $71,000 from a Frankfurt public relations company in 1998 and 1999, while he was minister.

Following his dismissal as Minister of Defense, Scharping withdrew his candidacy for reelection as vice chairman as his chances were meagre. His successor as vice chairman was again Kurt Beck. He kept his Bundestag seat but did not run again in the 2005 elections. For the remainder of his term, he served on the Committee on Foreign Affairs.

==Life after politics==
Since leaving politics, Scharping established his own company with a focus on business development in China. Scharping is a passionate cyclist; in 2005, he became the chairman of the Bund Deutscher Radfahrer. In addition, he took on a variety of paid and unpaid positions, including as member of the board of trustees at the Bonner Akademie für Forschung und Lehre praktischer Politik (BAPP). He is a Senior Network Member at the European Leadership Network (ELN).

<text>A shower radio is a battery-powered radio that is waterproofed to allow it to be used in a bathroom or other wet environment. More generally, a shower radio is a shower speaker with an integrated radio functionality. Some versions also include a CD player and/or a clock. Shower radios generally lack headphone jacks and AC adapter ports, which could short out or electrocute the user. For the same reason, they also tend to lack external antennas.

The first mass-produced shower radio was patented in 1985 by Andrew R. Mark, of Stamford, Connecticut. The product was marketed by Salton Inc. under the brand name &quot;Wet Tunes&quot;.
There are varying designs; some are meant to be hung from a pipe or shower rod, while others can be stuck to the wall of the shower using a suction cup or something similar. Shower radios may be analog or digital. More recently, water-powered and wind-up radio designs have been produced to completely remove the requirement for batteries, though smaller capacity rechargeable batteries are used to some extent on hand-crank devices.

Shower radios can be paired with FM transmitters, allowing users to enjoy their favorite album or playlist from a portable media device while keeping it safe and dry outside the shower.

<doc id="788047" wikidata="Q431534" url="?curid=788047" title="Association des États Généraux des Étudiants de l'Europe">
<text>The AEGEE, or &#x27; (literally: &quot;Association of States General of Students of Europe&quot;), known asEuropean Students&#x27; Forum in English, is one of the largest transnational, interdisciplinary student organisation in Europe.

Established in 1985, AEGEE currently has around 13,000 yearly members more than 200 local groups (Antennae) in university cities across Europe, including Russia, Turkey and the Caucasus, with a European board and head office in Brussels. It promotes an equal, democratic and unified Europe, open to all across national borders. Several hundred conferences, training and cultural events are organised across the network every year, and AEGEE also advocates for the needs and interests of European students.

The short name &quot;AEGEE&quot; evokes the Aegean Sea, one of the birthplaces of democracy, and the full name includes the first parliament established in France, the États Généraux. 

AEGEE played a pivotal role in the creation of the Erasmus Programme in 1987.

==Structure==
AEGEE has a yearly elected European board, the Comité Directeur with a head office in Brussels, and a number of European-level working groups. There is a large network of autonomous local groups, the antennae. Active members meet twice a year in Spring and Autumn in a general assembly called Agora, hosted by a different antenna each time. Most candidates for positions at the European level are elected at the Agora, which also ratifies the establishment or deletion of antennae, working groups and projects. There is also a smaller annual European Planning Meeting (EPM), intended to develop projects and campaigns and usually held in late winter: During the EPM, AEGEE also works on developing its Strategic Plan in an Action Agenda for the whole AEGEE network.

The association has no national level, and it does not recognize the current national borders within Europe.

Antennae are supported by the Network Commission, a group of experienced members elected by the Agora to help the network grow and develop. They provide advice, training and practical help, especially with local human resources and event organisation. Each Network Commissioner has responsibility for a number of locals across several national borders, which can be reorganised at each Agora to prevent the creation of any fixed national or regional division.

Each city antenna is a separate legal person under its own local law, not under the direct control of the Comité Directeur. However, to become a part of the AEGEE network, prospective antennae must include the principles of AEGEE&#x27;s statute within their own, and have them approved by the Comité Directeur and Juridical Commission. They sign a contract called Convention d&#x27;Adhésion which allows AEGEE to have an antenna wound up in case of inactivity or serious misconduct.

Membership of an antenna is generally open to anyone younger than 35 living in the local area, upon payment of a membership fee set by the local board. Many antennae concentrate their promotional activities on students at their home university, and are not very visible to outsiders.

Most AEGEE events are open to non-members, however this tends to be poorly promoted except to local students. It is quite common for all participants to be from the host city or other AEGEE antennae. Some activities, most notably the statutory Agorae and EPMs and the Summer University project, are explicitly restricted to AEGEE members who must be approved by their home antenna&#x27;s board.

AEGEE was founded in France and still uses a number of French terms, but the main working language at European level is now English, which is also defined as the official language of the Agora. Most antennae use their own local language for their local activities, however local board members generally need a working knowledge of English.

Its current board consists of five people. The statutory sixth and seventh board positions remain vacant until the next board takes office.

==History==
===1985===
The association was born the 16 April 1985 as a result of the EGEE 1 conference (États Généraux des Étudiants de l&#x27;Europe), when it held its first event in Paris: an assembly of students from Paris, Leiden, London, Madrid, Milan and Munich, organised by founding president Franck Biancheri in cooperation with five Grandes Écoles in Paris. It had the aim to overcome the paralysis of the European integration process at the time. Franck Biancheri led the whole process and soon all students involved wanted to turn the EGEE conference into an organisation being the platform for young Europeans. The aim of the founders was to create a space for young Europeans to discuss European matters and present their ideas to both the European and national institutions.

<text>Mark Stanton Curtis (born 1959) is a former member of the American Socialist Workers Party (SWP). Curtis was the subject of a defense campaign by the SWP after he was charged and convicted of sexually assaulting a 14-year-old girl in 1988. The SWP and others of Curtis&#x27;s defenders claimed that he had been framed by the police due to his politics and his trade union activities. Curtis was paroled in 1996 after serving eight years of a 25-year sentence in Iowa State Penitentiary.

The SWP claimed that Curtis was arrested, beaten by the police and framed up for his work in organizing a campaign to defend 17 of his co-workers from Central America who had been seized in an INS raid of the Des Moines meatpacking plant at which they worked. Two police officers who arrested Curtis were found guilty of battery in 1992 and ordered to pay $11,000 in damages.

Curtis claimed that he was stopped at a traffic light in Des Moines when a woman approached him, said she was being followed and asked for a ride home. He claims that on arriving at her house he accompanied her to the porch at which point police came from behind, handcuffed him and pulled down his trousers. 
The 15-year-old girl, Demetria Morris, said she and her 11-year-old brother were watching television when Curtis knocked on their door asking for directions. According to the girl, Curtis then asked her if her parents were home, she said they were not, and he attacked her and attempted to rape her. Unbeknownst to Curtis, however, her brother had called the police who arrived on the scene.

The Morris family was awarded $80,000 in damages after suing Curtis.

Subsequent events undermined Curtis&#x27;s defense: His expulsion from the SWP in 1999, and the SWP&#x27;s cover-up of a rape committed by another member of the Des Moines SWP in 1995.

<text>An emergency special session of the United Nations General Assembly ( ESS of UNGA) is an unscheduled meeting of the United Nations General Assembly to make urgent recommendations on a particular issue. Such recommendations can include collective measures and can include the use of armed force when necessary to maintain or restore international peace and security in the case of a breach of the peace or act of aggression when the United Nations Security Council fails to exercise its responsibility for the maintenance of international peace and security due to lack of unanimity of its permanent (&quot;veto&quot;) members.

Under Chapter Five of the Charter of the United Nations, the Security Council is normally entrusted with maintaining international peace and security. However, on 3 November 1950, the General Assembly passed Resolution 377 (Uniting for Peace) which expanded its authority to consider topics that were previously reserved solely for the Security Council. Under the Resolution, if the Security Council cannot come to a decision on an issue because of a lack of unanimity, the General Assembly may hold an emergency special session within 24 hours to consider the same matter.

The mechanism of the emergency special session was created in 1950 by the General Assembly&#x27;s adoption of its &quot;Uniting for Peace&quot; resolution, which made the necessary changes to the Assembly&#x27;s Rules of Procedure. The resolution likewise declared that:
... if the Security Council, because of lack of unanimity of the permanent members, fails to exercise its primary responsibility for the maintenance of international peace and security in any case where there appears to be a threat to the peace, breach of the peace, or act of aggression, the General Assembly shall consider the matter immediately with a view to making appropriate recommendations to Members for collective measures, including in the case of a breach of the peace or act of aggression the use of armed force when necessary, to maintain or restore international peace and security. If not in session at the time, the General Assembly may meet in emergency special session within twenty-four hours of the request therefor. Such emergency special session shall be called if requested by the Security Council on the vote of any seven members, or by a majority of the Members of the United Nations...
Emergency special sessions are rare, a fact reflected in that there have been only eleven such sessions in the history of the United Nations. Additionally, most emergency special sessions run for a single plenary meeting, with the exception of the 7th (closed), 10th and 11th (both temporarily adjourned), which have been reconvened four, seventeen, and twenty one times respectively.

== Procedure ==
The procedure to call an emergency special session are laid out in the Rules of Procedure of the General Assembly. The rules pertaining to emergency special sessions are as follows (as amended by Res. 1991 that increased majority needed from 7 to 9):

* Rule 8(b) – Summoning at the request of the Security Council or Members
** Emergency special sessions can be convened by a vote of nine members of the Security Council, or a majority of United Nations Member States. These sessions must be convened within 24 hours of any votes.
* Rule 9(b) – Request by Members
** Allows any Member State of the United Nations to request the Secretary-General to convene an emergency special session.
* Rule 10 – Notification of session
** Requires the Secretary-General to notify Member States, at least 12 hours in advance, of the opening of an emergency special session convened pursuant to rule 8(b).
* Rule 16 – Agenda
** States that the provisional agenda of an emergency special session shall be communicated to Member States simultaneously with the communication convening the session.
* Rule 19 – Additional items
** During an emergency special session, additional agenda items may be added for consideration by a two-thirds majority of the members present and voting.
* Rule 20 – Explanatory memorandum
** Requires any item proposed for inclusion in the agenda to be accompanied by an explanatory memorandum.

<doc id="788056" wikidata="Q6971043" url="?curid=788056" title="National Blue Ribbon Schools Program">
<text>The National Blue Ribbon Schools Program is a United States Department of Education award program that recognizes exemplary public and non-public schools on a yearly basis. Using standards of excellence evidenced by student achievement measures, the Department honors high-performing schools and schools that are making great strides in closing any achievement gaps between students.

The U.S. Department of Education is responsible for administering the National Blue Ribbon Schools Program, which is supported through ongoing collaboration with the National Association of Elementary School Principals, Association for Middle Level Education, and the National Association of Secondary School Principals. Since the program&#x27;s founding in 1982, the award has been presented to more than 9,000 schools.

National Blue Ribbon Schools represent the full diversity of American schools: public schools including Title I schools, charter schools, magnet schools, and non-public schools including parochial and independent schools. The schools are urban, suburban, and rural, large and small, traditional and innovative, and serve students of every social, economic, and ethnic background.

==History==
In 1982, then-Secretary of Education Terrel H. Bell, best known for commissioning &quot;A Nation at Risk&quot;, described a &quot;rising tide&quot; of mediocre schools that threatened the nation&#x27;s future.

Secretary Bell created the National Blue Ribbon Schools Award to bring exceptional U.S. schools to public attention and to recognize those schools whose students thrived and excelled. Working with the National Association of Elementary School Principals and the National Association of Secondary School Principals, Bell launched the National Blue Ribbon Schools and the National Distinguished Principals Programs. Both programs highlighted outstanding models of American schools and school leadership.

Initially, the National Blue Ribbon Schools program honored only secondary schools; it was later expanded to include primary schools. It was changed again to honor secondary schools and primary schools in alternate years and now honors secondary, middle, elementary, and K-8 and K-12 schools each year. In 2003, the program was restructured to bring it in line with the No Child Left Behind Education Law, placing a stronger emphasis on state assessment data and requiring schools to demonstrate high academic success. Schools must show how data are interpreted and used and how curriculum, instruction, professional development, and student support promote student success.

In 2012 the program was renamed the National Blue Ribbon Schools program to distinguish it from a for-profit company which had appropriated the Blue Ribbon School name.

During its first 25 years of existence, the National Blue Ribbon Schools Award was granted approximately 5,600 times, recognizing 5,200 different schools. (Some schools have been selected two or more times.) More than 133,000 public, charter, private and parochial schools serving grades K 12 are eligible for the award. More than 9,000 schools have been honored as National Blue Ribbon Schools — with more than 10,000 awards given in total — since the program&#x27;s inception.

States, territories, the Bureau of Indian Affairs, and the Department of Defense Education Activity schools have joined the competition over the years. Special emphasis has changed from year to year based on national priorities. Among National Blue Ribbon Schools there is much diversity: the award recognizes rural, urban, and suburban schools; large and small schools, and public and non-public schools.

==Criteria==
The National Blue Ribbon Schools Program accepts nominations from both public and non-public schools that meet one of two criteria:
*Exemplary High Performing Schools are among their state&#x27;s highest performing schools as measured by state assessments or nationally normed tests. 
*Exemplary Achievement Gap-Closing Schools are among their state&#x27;s highest-performing schools in closing achievement gaps between a school&#x27;s subgroups and all students over the past 5 years.

Eligible schools must have been in existence for five years and cannot have received the award within the five prior years.

Must have excellence in the fields of academics, arts, and athletics.

==Application procedure==
Although at one time schools self-nominated for the award, this is no longer the case. At the invitation of the U.S. Secretary of Education, Chief State School Officers, including Washington, D.C., the Department of Defense Education Activity, the Bureau of Indian Education, and the Council for American Private Education nominate eligible schools for the annual award. Eligible schools must demonstrate high or strongly improving student scores on state or nationally normed assessments in the last year tested; schools must also make Annual Yearly Progress in accordance with No Child Left Behind.

Nominated schools submit applications describing school operations such as the use of assessments and assessment data, instructional methods, curricula, professional development, leadership, and community and family involvement. A total of 420 schools may be nominated in any year; state quotas are determined by the number of students and schools.

The Blue Ribbon award is considered the highest honor an American school can achieve. A school&#x27;s use of the National Blue Ribbon Schools logo is restricted.

==Criticism==
David W. Kirkpatrick, the Senior Education Fellow at the US Freedom Foundation, noted in an editorial titled, &quot;Awarding Blue Ribbons: Recognizing Schools or Students?&quot; that criteria for the awards do not take into account the socioeconomic status of the students and that studies show that students who come from homes with higher income and better educated parents do better than students without these advantages by virtue of their backgrounds. Thus, the award is usually given to schools with students from wealthy backgrounds. As evidence to support his case, he pointed to the distribution of awards given in Pennsylvania one year; of the eight schools receiving the award, only one was in a district whose income level was near the state average, and the rest went to districts with an above average income, including two in the wealthiest communities in the state. While Kirkpatrick proposed an alternative to recognizing &quot;blue ribbon students&quot;, he wrote, &quot;...a more accurate indication of a good school would be one that adjusts for such socioeconomic factors and identifies those in which students do better than would normally be expected, based on their backgrounds.&quot;

From the program&#x27;s inception through 2003, schools were permitted to nominate themselves. As of 2003, nominations are handled through a state liaison which schools must contact for nomination.

The program has also been criticized for assessment of schools coming from the school itself rather than an independent third party and a nomination and assessment process that favors schools with the know-how and resources to complete the review assessment.

<text>Anne Barbara Ridler OBE (née Bradby) (30 July 1912 – 15 October 2001) was a British poet and Faber and Faber editor, selecting the Faber &quot;A Little Book of Modern Verse&quot; with T. S. Eliot (1941). Her &quot;Collected Poems&quot; (Carcanet Press) were published in 1994. She turned to libretto work and verse plays; it was later in life that she earned official recognition, receiving an OBE in 2001.

==Early life==
Ridler was the daughter of Henry Bradby, housemaster at Rugby School in Rugby, Warwickshire, England, where she was born. Her mother, Violet Bradby, born Milford, wrote popular children&#x27;s stories and was the sister of Humphrey S. Milford, Publisher to the University of Oxford. One of her great-grandfathers was Charles Richard Sumner, Bishop of Winchester, a brother of John Bird Sumner, Archbishop of Canterbury. Her uncle, G. F. Bradby, was the author of &quot;The Lanchester Tradition&quot; (1919), while her aunt Barbara Bradby was the joint author of &quot;The Village Labourer&quot; (1911). Her cousins included Letitia Chitty, structural analytical engineer and first female fellow of the Royal Aeronautical Society, composer Robin Milford and the Rev. Dick Milford, vicar of the University Church of St Mary the Virgin, Oxford.

== Life ==
Anne Bradby was educated at Downe House School and later published a biography of her headmistress, Olive Willis. After six months in Florence and Rome, she took a diploma in journalism at King&#x27;s College London.

In 1938, she married Vivian Ridler, the future Printer to Oxford University (1958–78), but then the manager of the Bunhill Press, London, and they had two daughters and two sons.

She edited &quot;Charles Williams: The Image of the City and other Essays&quot; (1958) and &quot;Charles Williams: Selected Writings&quot; (1961). A Christian and friend and correspondent of C. S. Lewis, she was on the edge of the Inklings group. Also closely associated with T. S. Eliot, she wrote a short but powerful poem, &quot;I Who am Here Dissembled&quot;, full of allusions to images in Eliot&#x27;s own poems, for the anthology &quot;T. S. Eliot: A Symposium&quot; in honour of his sixtieth birthday.

For a short time in the 1940s, Ridler was also a successful verse dramatist, writing such plays as &quot;Cain&quot; (1943) and &quot;Shadow Factory: A Nativity Play&quot; (1945).

&quot;Poetry: A Magazine of Verse&quot; awarded her in 1954 the Oscar Blumenthal Prize and in 1955 the Union League Civic and Arts Poetry Prize. In 1998 she was one of four poets who received the Cholmondeley Award from the Society of Authors.

<text>TennCare is the state Medicaid program in the U.S. state of Tennessee. TennCare was established in 1994 under a federal waiver that authorized deviations from the standard Medicaid rules. It was the first state Medicaid program to enroll all Medicaid recipients in managed care. When first implemented, it also offered health insurance to other residents who did not have other insurance. Over time, the non-Medicaid component of the program was significantly reduced. Today TennCare offers a large variety of programs to better serve the citizens of Tennessee. 

==History==
TennCare was started in the early 1990s under Governor Ned McWherter as a health care reform initiative that had the twin goals of controlling rising Medicaid costs and increasing public access to affordable health care. Tennessee sought and obtained waivers from the federal Health Care Financing Administration that allowed the state to conduct a five-year demonstration program. Plans called for eliminating the Medicaid fee-for-service payment method by instead enrolling the state&#x27;s Medicaid recipients in managed care programs administered by private-sector organizations. Additionally, other state residents who lacked healthcare coverage, particularly those who could not obtain medical insurance because of pre-existing medical conditions, could pay sliding-scale premiums to enroll in the same programs; the cost of their coverage would be subsidized by savings from the Medicaid program. The waiver that Tennessee received was one of the nation&#x27;s first Medicaid waivers, with the overarching requirement that the program be &quot;budget neutral&quot;, or require no greater federal funding than the previous Medicaid program.

The program was launched January 1, 1994. The state contracted with 12 statewide managed-care organizations that were established to implement the program through a competitive bid process. The state shifted more than 800,000 individuals from standard Medicaid coverage to coverage through a managed care company, and extended program benefits to 500,000 more people who were not Medicaid-eligible, but were uninsured or deemed uninsurable due to pre-existing conditions.

In its first year of operation, TennCare enrollment quickly grew, leading to concern that it would exceed the number for which the federal government would share cost. In 1995, after enrollment reached 1.2 million, the state closed eligibility to uninsured adults. People who were deemed uninsurable due to pre-existing health conditions were still eligible to enroll.

In 1996, the state separated behavioral health services from the basic managed-care program, contracting with a separate set of behavioral health organizations for mental health and substance abuse services to TennCare participants.

The initial five-year Medicaid waiver was eventually extended through July 1, 2002, when it was replaced by a new program waiver called &quot;TennCare II&quot; that was extended until June 30, 2010.

Under TennCare II, program eligibility for &quot;uninsured&quot; and &quot;uninsurables&quot; was tightened. New applicants in the &quot;uninsurable&quot; category (now called &quot;medically eligible&quot;) were required to have an income below a specified threshold and their ineligibility for standard insurance was required to be verified through a medical underwriting process.

The total annual budget for TennCare increased from $2.64 billion in 1994 to more than $8.5 billion in fiscal year 2005, with essentially no change in the number of participants enrolled. After becoming governor in 2003, Phil Bredesen hired the consulting firm McKinsey &amp; Company to evaluate the financial sustainability of TennCare and make recommendations for future actions. The McKinsey report, issued in late 2003, concluded that TennCare was not financially viable. A follow-up report in January 2004 identified options that ranged from returning to the original Medicaid program to setting limits on enrollment and benefits. In response to these reports and to stem the growth in costs, in 2005 the state implemented several program changes, including removing about 190,000 participants, imposing limits on the number of prescription medications each participant could receive, and reducing some other benefits.

==Services==
TennCare offers a variety of services for its members. A full list of these services can be found at https://www.tn.gov/tenncare.html. 

Some of the most commonly used services are TennCare for kids, long-term care for seniors, pharmacy benefits, COVID-19 testing, and Opioid strategy. There are other services offered but these are among the most common services.

== TennCare Connect ==
In 2012, TennCare hired Northrup Grumman to build a computer system called the Tennessee Eligibility Determination System (TEDS), which would be used to determine eligibility for TennCare, but the company was fired after it failed to complete the job. In 2016, Deloitte Consulting was hired to finish the work, which was completed at a total cost of $400 million in 2019, when the new system was launched under the name TennCare Connect.

In 2020, a class action lawsuit was filed on behalf of 35 adults and children in Tennessee, who alleged that they were illegally denied Medicaid and other benefits by the TennCare Connect system. In August 2024, US District Court Judge Waverly Crenshaw Jr. ruled in the plaintiffs&#x27; favor, finding that the algorithmic system built by Deloitte and other contractors failed to load appropriate data, assigned beneficiaries to the wrong households, and made incorrect eligibility determinations.

<doc id="788066" wikidata="Q3063482" url="?curid=788066" title="Tim Follin">
<text>Timothy John Follin (born 19 December 1970) is an English video game music composer, cinematographer, visual effects artist and game developer, who has written tracks for a variety of titles and home gaming systems, including the ZX Spectrum, Commodore 64, Amiga, Atari ST, Nintendo Entertainment System, Mega Drive, Super NES, Game Boy, Dreamcast, and PlayStation.

Follin has also co-founded a TV advertising company called ABF Pictures and a general-purpose media company called Baggy Cat Ltd, which to date has produced two video games, &quot;&quot; and &quot;At Dead of Night,&quot; the latter receiving massive attention and acclaim on Steam.

Among Follin&#x27;s works are the soundtracks to &quot;Solstice&quot;, &quot;Silver Surfer&quot;, &quot;Spider-Man/X-Men: Arcade&#x27;s Revenge&quot;, &quot;Plok!&quot;, and &quot;Ecco the Dolphin: Defender of the Future&quot;.

==Video game career==

===Insight Studios===
As a child, Follin had no significant music training. Leaving Liverpool&#x27;s Sandown Music College after one year of studies, Follin&#x27;s career began at the age of 15 working at Insight Studios. Follin ended up in video games due to his older brother Mike Follin learning how to program for the ZX Spectrum and obtaining professional work at Insight. After developing a pulse-width modulation effect Tim wrote the music driver and soundtrack for their first professional game, &quot;Subterranean Stryker,&quot; followed by an arrangement of Stravinsky&#x27;s &quot;The Firebird&quot;, used for the game &quot;Star Firebirds&quot;. Follin then developed a three-channel sound routine which he used to create the music for his third soundtrack, &quot;Vectron&quot;. He then went on to create 4- and 5-channel music for games such as &quot;Chronos&quot; and &quot;Agent&quot; X. In his early career, Follin&#x27;s music was praised in magazine game reviews.

Follin&#x27;s sole game programming credit (not counting music drivers) came with his fourth title, &quot;Future Games&quot;, where he created one minigame of the several featured.

===Software Creations===
Hired by Richard Kay, Tim followed brother Mike in moving to Software Creations in 1987, his first full-time job, where he spent a significant portion of his career. Follin&#x27;s arranged soundtrack to &quot;Bubble Bobble&quot; was his first written for a soundchip, the AY-3-8910.

Follin wrote the music for &quot;Black Lamp&quot; in one night after a bout of writer&#x27;s block.

Within the level 1 music of &quot;Ghouls&#x27;n Ghosts&quot; for the Amiga is a voice sample played backwards saying &quot;secret authority&quot;, considered nothing more than a joke by Follin. Alongside &quot;Ghouls&#x27;n Ghosts&quot;, two other Amiga soundtracks, &quot;Sly Spy&quot; and &quot;Puzznic&quot;, were presented in the Amiga music format &quot;Follin Player II&quot;. To arcade soundtrack arrangements like &quot;Bionic Commando&quot; and &quot;Ghouls&#x27;n Ghosts,&quot; Follin added richer sound palette and occasionally composed some new songs (the title music of &quot;Ghouls&#x27;n Ghosts&quot;).

Follin described the NES title &quot;Solstice&quot; as &quot;a very inspiring game to do music for,&quot; demanding atmospheric music within the game&#x27;s dark castle environment, as well as powerful music choreographed with the title sequence. Follin did not use a keyboard or any instruments for the &quot;Solstice&quot; soundtrack, composing while &quot;thinking along the lines of the computer and not [...] a keyboard.&quot; Follin felt the programming-only approach allowed him to work with &quot;a more open mind&quot;.

In a 1990 interview, Follin expressed &quot;a bit of desolation&quot; over the prospect of no longer composing for the Commodore 64, stating &quot;I don&#x27;t see myself staying with this machine,&quot; perhaps sensing the transition occurring in the European gaming marketplace as the third generation of video and computer game platforms reached its end. Follin&#x27;s final Commodore 64 release came with 1991&#x27;s &quot;Gauntlet III&quot;.

Beside contributing the soundtrack with brother Geoff, Follin recorded live sound effects for 1993 SNES title &quot;Thomas the Tank Engine &amp; Friends&quot;.

Citing a declining work environment, Follin departed Software Creations in 1993 (with his final title there being &quot;Rock N&#x27; Roll Racing&quot;).

===Malibu Interactive and freelancing===
After leaving Software Creations, Follin joined Malibu Interactive for 18 months. While working for Malibu, Follin provided the soundtrack for &quot;Time Trax&quot; on the Sega Mega Drive and (along with brother Geoff) &quot;Prime&quot; for the Sega CD, doing &quot;virtually nothing and getting paid&quot; for the following year before winding up out of work. Another title composed alongside brother Geoff, &quot;Firearm&quot;, went unpublished. Follin would spend the remainder of his video game career as a freelancer. Following Malibu Interactive&#x27;s collapse, Follin then worked with groups that made unsuccessful game pitches to Psygnosis and the BBC. Follin provided part of the soundtrack for &quot;Batman &amp; Robin&quot;, developed by Probe.

Follin joined the development team of &quot;Ecco the Dolphin: Defender of the Future&quot; as the title&#x27;s lead composer around mid-1998, leaving Attila Heger no longer responsible for providing the entirety of the soundtrack. (Heger was made primarily responsible for scoring the game&#x27;s cutscenes.) Follin had been offered the composer position by Sega UK producer David Nulty, who was a fan of Follin&#x27;s Commodore 64 work. The soundtrack received very favourable reviews from &quot;Edge&quot;, &quot;DC-UK&quot;, and &quot;Official Dreamcast Magazine&quot;.

The 2003 multiplatform release &quot;Starsky &amp; Hutch&quot; was given a funk-style score by Follin, who said at the time, &quot;This is the project I had hoped I would get one day. I&#x27;ve always loved Starsky &amp; Hutch and original title music.&quot; While with Software Creations, Follin had previously arranged the &quot;Starsky &amp; Hutch&quot; television series&#x27; theme as the title music to the 1991 NES release &quot;Treasure Master&quot;.

===End of video game career and return===
Around August 2005, Follin announced on his website &quot;with much delight&quot; that he had chosen to stop composing music for video games, citing its irregular work not providing a substantial income, light-heartedly adding that the situation caused him &quot;distress and illness&quot;. The tenuous nature of game development caused several instances of Follin being hired and subsequently having the project shelved. Follin noted that &quot;Starsky &amp; Hutch&quot; had been in development for around three years before eventually being released.

Towards the end of 2012 Follin decided to dust off an idea originally conceived as an interactive audio adventure game and reworked the concept as a video-based adventure game called &quot;,&quot; which he designed and scripted, then filmed and programmed, also composing the game&#x27;s soundtrack. The game was subsequently released on iPad and later on Steam. Follin then worked on another game, &quot;At Dead of Night&quot;, again using the FMV format but this time in the horror game genre, which was released at the end of 2020. In mid-2021, a playthrough of At Dead of Night was created by gaming YouTuber Markiplier, leading to a surge in popularity. A sequel is now in the works.

His brothers Geoff Follin and Mike Follin also worked in the video game industry as musician and programmer respectively, with both having moved on to other careers. Much like his brothers, Follin has changed careers, choosing to pursue films, television advertising, graphic design, visual effects and game design. Follin never considered himself a gamer as much as a musician or developer.

===Game credits===
==Thoughts on video game music==

Follin&#x27;s methodology of music was that music is &quot;basically an unconscious experience&quot; that does not and should not &quot;engage your intellect&quot;. Rather, Follin believed game music was &quot;more of a sort of atmospheric thing&quot; and had &quot;always written music to be part of something else&quot;, intending for the video game (or other media the music is composed for) to provide the image or scene of context.

Within his personal experience, Follin always found the hardest part of creating music to be the concept phase, saying &quot;I probably tear my hair out more over arrangement than over anything else.&quot; The easiest part was the execution of the solidified concepts.

Follin felt the idea of computer music was &quot;a silly one to begin with&quot;, as soundchips from the earliest platforms (e.g. ZX Spectrum) were only meant to produce sound effects. As early as 1994, Follin expressed his desire to move away from scoring video games and transition to films, stating that he preferred never to work with chip-generated music again along with his hopes that the games industry would not move backwards from the emerging standard of CD audio. Whether dealing with the audio limitations of older consoles or a game&#x27;s narrow style guidelines when composing for modern soundtracks, Follin regarded the challenge of creating music within constraints to be an interesting part of working in video game music.

During his game music career, Follin never had the mood or interest to join any demoscene groups. Though Follin knew few fellow video game composers, he highly respected Richard Jacques for the amount of work put into his music.

===Influences===
Follin cited progressive rock as well as many musicians (including Quincy Jones, Jethro Tull, Led Zeppelin, and John Martyn) as having had some casual or subconscious influence on his music, and has also enjoyed music by Deep Purple and Guns N&#x27; Roses. However, he did not feel that any specific artist or style had been a primary inspiration during his career. Follin acknowledged that in one instance he went for a more contemporary style when scoring the award-winning soundtrack to &quot;Bionic Commando&quot;, actively choosing to mimic other people&#x27;s music for fear of potentially losing his job.

The soundtrack to &quot;Ecco the Dolphin: Defender of the Future&quot; may have been influenced by the works of American minimalist composer John Adams, whom Follin explicitly acknowledged as a current influence during the time he was completing the soundtrack, citing Adams&#x27; work as &quot;the only minimalist stuff I&#x27;ve heard which struck a chord with me.&quot;

Follin did not have much time to listen to the work of his musical contemporaries while in the video games industry, a situation he implied as having been a benefit to his career. Follin speculated that in actively listening to those works, he likely ran the risk of encountering ideas he had not thought of and subsequently becoming discouraged and/or prone to copycatting.

===Personal view of work===
Particularly in the earlier days of his career, Follin often composed game soundtracks while the games themselves were still in the writing stages, meaning that there was usually no frame of reference or genre objective in mind. Follin himself humorously felt these situations created many instances where the soundtrack was unsuited to the game, though at the time neither he nor any game developers had any issues. Given another chance, Follin said he would have given more effort toward making his earlier soundtracks better suited to the games, feeling that his failure to do so (despite the compositional quality) likely cost him future work. Back then, Follin instead focused on exploring the various consoles&#x27; audio limitations. The technical limitations of the most primitive video game system soundchips made Follin&#x27;s primary goals to create original sounds as well as not allow the resulting music to sound poor.

Follin also never had the interest to join a demoscene group, though, near the end of his time working with Commodore platforms, he claimed he enjoyed himself when he made music. Outside of &quot;Ghouls&#x27;n Ghosts&quot; however, Follin later described his Commodore 64 work as nonsense that he was not particularly happy with.

Follin noted &quot;Ghouls&#x27;n Ghosts&quot; on the Commodore 64 as his favourite work, though the game was a known entity, unlike many of Follin&#x27;s early projects. Software Creations programmer Steve Ruddy, who created the music driver for the game (with design input from Follin) recalled Follin describing a wide array of imagery for the title theme. For the &quot;Ghouls&#x27;n Ghosts&quot; soundtrack, Follin retained parts of Tamayo Kawamoto&#x27;s original arcade soundtrack within most tracks, only to transition into his own ideas for other portions of those tracks. Similar circumstances resulted in Follin&#x27;s soundtrack for &quot;Bionic Commando&quot;.

Follin has found it difficult to listen to works he created, feeling them outdated by the time they were completed. Follin disliked working with the Atari ST and the ZX Spectrum&#x27;s AY chip, feeling the NES had more character. While not feeling very successful composing music for the Amiga, Follin enjoyed working on soundtracks for the SNES and Commodore 64. He described writing for the C64&#x27;s SID chip as &quot;playing an instrument in its own right&quot;, appreciating the analogue sound it produced, despite having only three channels to work with. Follin also recalled the SNES&#x27;s &quot;Spider-Man/X-Men: Arcade&#x27;s Revenge&quot; being fun due to the inclusion of cheesy &#x27;70s guitar synths and brass synths.

Despite not considering himself adept at any live instruments, and composing several soundtracks beyond the fifth generation of video game consoles using samples, Follin disliked sampled music. Instead, Follin strove to make his music sound as close to live instrumentation as possible. His most notable work using sampled instruments was the soundtrack to &quot;Ecco the Dolphin: Defender of the Future&quot;, an experience he enjoyed, but also felt frustrated with on account of &quot;a lack of equipment and resources – such as a string orchestra and choir!&quot; Follin finds orchestral music inherently more human-sounding and listenable.

===Fandom===
Several contemporaries of Follin&#x27;s have cited him as an inspiration or top composer including Richard Jacques, Jesper Kyd, David Wise, Frédéric Motte, Markus Schneider, Matt &quot;Gasman&quot; Westcott, Ramiro &quot;Extremer&quot; Vaca, graphic artist Haydn Dalton, and programmer Dean Belfield. Frequent Software Creations collaborator Steve Ruddy, who programmed music drivers used by Follin with Follin&#x27;s design input, marvelled &quot;I had no idea how he made it do what it did,&quot; and described his music as &quot;astonishing&quot;.

Regarding fan communities dedicated to arranging video game music, including his own, Follin remarked, &quot;It&#x27;s really good. A lot of the stuff, you just think &#x27;Well, that&#x27;s much better than what I would have done... could do now. Follin is consistently mentioned as a favourite composer among European musicians within the Commodore arrangement scene.

Alongside the music of fellow video game music composer Rob Hubbard, Follin&#x27;s musical work in games was spotlighted in listening stations of the worldwide &quot;Game On&quot; exhibition, organised by the Barbican Art Gallery.

==Media production career==
Follin has written, directed, produced, and composed for two short films: &quot;Body Counting&quot; and &quot;The Sun Circle&quot;. &quot;Body Counting&quot; won the Best Short Film under £5,000 award at the Salford Film Festival in November 2004.

Since semi-retiring from video game music composition, Follin has gone on to work in the television industry, working as director of photography for TV ads and dramas, as well as creating graphics, CGI, and music for commercials. In April 2010, Follin joined Matt Barraclough and Paul Ambler to form ABF Pictures Ltd., a company making TV commercials, web videos, and music promos. In 2013, he started a company to embrace his various interests and skills, called Baggy Cat Ltd.

==Personal life==
Follin has expressed that he does not use recreational drugs, perhaps counter to inferences made by fans of his music.

Follin considers writing therapeutic.

===Family===
Tim is married and has two school-age children. Tim, son of Marjorie Follin, was the youngest of three brothers, all of whom had careers in the video game industry. Oldest brother Michael Stuart (Mike) moved on after 16 years as a programmer to become an ordained minister in the Church of England. Middle brother Geoffrey Mark (Geoff), a fellow game composer who was proficient in several instruments, MIDI software, and reading sheet music, later went on to become a primary school teacher and later a part-time math tutor while occasionally composing music; he died of pancreatic cancer in May 2024.

<text>Ulverstone is a town on the northern coast of Tasmania, Australia on the mouth of the River Leven, on Bass Strait. It is on the Bass Highway, west of Devonport and east of Penguin.

As of June 2021 Ulverstone had an urban population of 11,613, being the largest town in Tasmania. The town is a part of the municipality of the Central Coast Council, which also includes Penguin, Turners Beach, Leith, Gawler and surrounds, and Forth.

==History==
The town area was first settled by Europeans in 1848, when Andrew Risby, his wife Louisa and their five young children arrived to settle and develop farmland from what was mostly a thickly forested wilderness.

Andrew and Louisa arrived in Adelaide, South Australia in 1839 as a newly married couple from their ancestral town of Horsley, Gloucestershire in England. The first of their five children were born in Adelaide. Soon after the birth of their second child they moved to Tasmania. In 1841 they arrived at the Forth River where a young 19-year-old James Fenton had pioneered just prior to their arrival. After clearing land and subsistence farming for a few years, they were evicted from their &quot;patch&quot; after a land dispute with a wealthy speculator and moved westward. The district was, at that time, known as &quot;the Leven&quot; and recognised as a good source of quality timber with a similar climate to England. When their fifth child, Andrew Risby jnr. was two years old the Risby family moved and settled on a patch of land known as The Rises, at the south-eastern perimeter of the present day Ulverstone town boundary where they farmed for many years. Descendants of this pioneering family still live in the district.

During the 1850s, the district received a few new settlers but was also frequented by transient timber getters. The timber found ready markets in Melbourne, which desperately required good quality split timber during the Victorian gold rush. Until June 1854, land releases in the district were often purchased under &quot;pre-emptive rights legislation&quot; by distant purchasers whose intention was to keep the land for later sale at an increased price. With the repeal of that legislation, the conditions for settlers to take up residence improved.

The name Ulverstone is first known to have been used in 1854 when Hugh Ross McKay opened the Ulverstone store. Leven Post Office opened on 30 May 1857 and was renamed Ulverstone Post Office in 1881. Ulverstone was declared a town on 22 February 1861 by Governor H.E. Fox-Young.

Reliable rainfall and generally good quality soils favoured the development of agricultural pursuits. The early pioneers of the district struggled against great odds to secure their sustenance and ultimately develop an income from sale of their produce.

Ulverstone grew quite quickly during the 1890s, and the town has become a centralised location between the north-west coast&#x27;s two cities, Burnie and Devonport. It is named after Ulverston in England, which also sits at the estuary of a river called Leven. Ulverston in England was spelled &quot;Ulverstone&quot; until late in the 19th century.

From 1915 until 1955, a branch railway ran from Ulverstone to Nietta, mostly carrying timber for the Burnie Pulp Mill.

In the 1990s, Ulverstone hosted many rallies opposing the decriminalisation of homosexuality, with it being given the moniker of &quot;Australia&#x27;s most homophobic town&quot; at the time. Male homosexual acts were legalised in Tasmania in 1997, making it the last state to have done so.

===Redevelopment===

The Central Coast Council has recently redeveloped the area to increase tourism. 2010 saw the completion of a new basketball stadium, the Schweppes Arena. The arena holds around 1,100 people, cost $5.5 million to build and was completed just behind schedule. it overlooks the River Leven and is situated just behind the former stadium.

In 2011, the Leven Bridge was replaced by a new bridge. It was built by VEC Civil Engineering for approximately $6.5 million, with the Department of Infrastructure, Energy and Resources and the Central Coast Council funding the project. In June 2011 a walking track between Turners Beach and Ulverstone was opened.

A redevelopment of the wharf precinct was opened to the public on 17 November 2012.

==Climate==
Ulverstone has a oceanic climate (Köppen: Cfb), with very mild, relatively dry summers and cool, rainy winters. Influence from the Bass Strait significantly cools the climate, whilst creating noticeable seasonal lag. Average maxima vary from in February to in July while average minima fluctuate between in February and in July.
Mean average annual precipitation is moderate, spread between 147.3 precipitation days, and is concentrated in winter. Extreme temperatures have ranged from on 17 July 1982 to on 7 February 1967. Climate data was sourced from Forthside, a rural locality east south-east of Ulverstone.

==Education==
Ulverstone has three public primary schools and one public high school/college:
*East Ulverstone Primary School
*Central Ulverstone Primary School
*West Ulverstone Primary School
*Ulverstone Secondary College
There are two private schools in Ulverstone:
*Sacred Heart Primary School
*Leighland Christian School 

As of 2017, students studying Years 11 and 12 can study at Ulverstone Secondary College, or commute to Penguin District School in Penguin, to Don College in Devonport, or to Hellyer College in Burnie.

Ulverstone is home to TastroFest - Tasmania&#x27;s Astronomy Festival. This event is held annually in August and is the largest astronomy festival in Australia. Centred around education, this event holds both student and public programs over three days.

<text>The RUM-139 Vertical-Launch Anti-Submarine Rocket (VL-ASROC or VLA) is an anti-submarine missile in the ASROC family, currently built by Lockheed Martin for the U.S. Navy.

==History==
Design and development of the missile began in 1983 when Goodyear Aerospace was contracted by the U.S. Navy to develop a ship-launched anti-submarine missile compatible with the new Mark 41 vertical launching system (VLS). The development of the VLS ASROC underwent many delays, and it was not deployed on any ships until 1993. During this development, Goodyear Aerospace was bought by Loral Corporation in 1986, and this defense division was in turn purchased by Lockheed Martin in 1995.

The first VLS ASROC missile was an RUR-5 ASROC with an upgraded solid-fuel booster section and a digital guidance system. It carries a lightweight Mark 46 homing torpedo that is dropped from the rocket at a precalculated point on its trajectory, and then parachuted into the sea. 

The vertical launch missile first became operational in 1993, with more than 450 having been produced by 2007. It is in length, with a firing range of about 11.8 nm or . 

Beginning in 1996, the missile was replaced by the newer RUM-139A and subsequently the RUM-139B. The torpedo remained the Mark 46, though at one time an improved torpedo called the Mark 50 was proposed and then canceled.

In October 2004, the RUM-139C began production with the Mark 54 torpedo. The Mk 54 Mod 0 torpedo achieved Initial Operating Capability in 2010, and the U.S. Navy is transitioning its VL-ASROCs to use the Mk 54.

<text>Physical strength is the measure of an individual&#x27;s exertion of force on physical objects. Increasing physical strength is the goal of strength training.

==Overview==
An individual&#x27;s physical strength is determined by two factors: the cross-sectional area of muscle fibers recruited to generate force and the intensity of the recruitment. Individuals with a high proportion of type I slow twitch muscle fibers will be relatively weaker than a similar individual with a high proportion of type II fast twitch fibers, but would have greater endurance. The genetic inheritance of muscle fiber type sets the outermost boundaries of physical strength possible (barring the use of enhancing agents such as testosterone), although the unique position within this envelope is determined by training. 

Individual muscle fiber ratios can be determined through a muscle biopsy. Other considerations are the ability to recruit muscle fibers for a particular activity, joint angles, and the length of each limb. For a given cross-section, shorter limbs are able to lift more weight. The ability to gain muscle also varies person to person, based mainly upon genes dictating the amounts of hormones secreted, but also on sex, age, health of the person, and adequate nutrients in the diet. A one-repetition maximum test is the most accurate way to determine maximum muscular strength.

==Strength capability==
There are various ways to measure physical strength of a person or population. Strength capability analysis is usually done in the field of ergonomics where a particular task (e.g., lifting a load, pushing a cart, etc.) and/or a posture is evaluated and compared to the capabilities of the section of the population that the task is intended towards. The external reactive moments and forces on the joints are usually used in such cases. The strength capability of the joint is denoted by the amount of moment that the muscle force can create at the joint to counter the external moment.

Skeletal muscles produce reactive forces and moments at the joints. To avoid injury or fatigue, when person is performing a task, such as pushing or lifting a load, the external moments created at the joints due to the load at the hand and the weight of the body segments must be ideally less than the muscular moment strengths at the joint.

One of the first sagittal-plane models to predict strength was developed by Chaffin in 1969. Based on this model, the external moments at each joint must not exceed the muscle strength moments at that joint.

Where, Sj is the muscle strength moment at joint, j, and Mj/L is the external moment at the joint, j, due to load, L and the body segments preceding the joint in the top-down analysis.

Top-down analysis is the method of calculating the reactive moments and forces at each joint starting at the hand, all the way till the ankle and foot. In a 6-segment model, the joints considered are elbow, shoulder, L5/S1 disc of the spine, hip, knee and ankle. It is common to ignore the wrist joint in manual calculations. Software intended for such calculation use the wrist joint also, dividing the lower arm into hand and forearm segments.

==Prediction of static strength==
Static strength prediction is the method of predicting the strength capabilities of a person or a population (based on anthropometry) for a particular task and/or posture (an isometric contraction). To predict capability, manual calculations are usually performed using the top-down analysis on a six or seven-link model, based on available information about the case and then compared to standard guidelines, such as the one provided by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health.
