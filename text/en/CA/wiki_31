<text>Eurypterids, often informally called sea scorpions, are a group of extinct marine arthropods that form the order Eurypterida. The earliest known eurypterids date to the Darriwilian stage of the Ordovician period 467.3 million years ago. The group is likely to have appeared first either during the Early Ordovician or Late Cambrian period. With approximately 250 species, the Eurypterida is the most diverse Paleozoic chelicerate order. Following their appearance during the Ordovician, eurypterids became major components of marine faunas during the Silurian, from which the majority of eurypterid species have been described. The Silurian genus &quot;Eurypterus&quot; accounts for more than 90% of all known eurypterid specimens. Though the group continued to diversify during the subsequent Devonian period, the eurypterids were heavily affected by the Late Devonian extinction event. They declined in numbers and diversity until becoming extinct during the Permian–Triassic extinction event (or sometime shortly before) 251.9million years ago.

Although popularly called &quot;sea scorpions&quot;, only the earliest eurypterids were marine; many later forms lived in brackish or fresh water, and they were not true scorpions. Some studies suggest that a dual respiratory system was present, which would have allowed for short periods of time in terrestrial environments. The name &quot;Eurypterida&quot; comes from the Ancient Greek words (&#x27;), meaning &#x27;broad&#x27; or &#x27;wide&#x27;, and (&#x27;), meaning &#x27;wing&#x27;, referring to the pair of wide swimming appendages present in many members of the group.

The eurypterid order includes the largest known arthropods ever to have lived. The largest, &quot;Jaekelopterus&quot;, reached in length. Eurypterids were not uniformly large and most species were less than long; the smallest eurypterid, &quot;Alkenopterus&quot;, was only long. Eurypterid fossils have been recovered from every continent. A majority of fossils are from fossil sites in North America and Europe because the group lived primarily in the waters around and within the ancient supercontinent of Euramerica. Only a handful of eurypterid groups spread beyond the confines of Euramerica and a few genera, such as &quot;Adelophthalmus&quot; and &quot;Pterygotus&quot;, achieved a cosmopolitan distribution with fossils being found worldwide.

==Description==

Like all other arthropods, eurypterids possessed segmented bodies and jointed appendages (limbs) covered in a cuticle composed of proteins and chitin. As in other chelicerates, the body was divided into two tagmata (sections); the frontal prosoma (head) and posterior opisthosoma (abdomen). The prosoma was covered by a carapace (sometimes called the &quot;prosomal shield&quot;) on which both compound eyes and the ocelli (simple eye-like sensory organs) were located.

The prosoma also bore six pairs of appendages which are usually referred to as appendage pairs I to VI. The first pair of appendages, the only pair placed before the mouth, is called the chelicerae (homologous to the fangs of spiders). They were equipped with small pincers used to manipulate food fragments and push them into the mouth. In one lineage, the Pterygotidae, the chelicerae were large and long, with strong, well-developed teeth on specialised chelae (claws). The subsequent pairs of appendages, numbers II to VI, possessed gnathobases (or &quot;tooth-plates&quot;) on the coxae (limb segments) used for feeding. These appendages were generally walking legs that were cylindrical in shape and were covered in spines in some species. In most lineages, the limbs tended to get larger the farther back they were. In the Eurypterina suborder, the larger of the two eurypterid suborders, the sixth pair of appendages was also modified into a swimming paddle to aid in traversing aquatic environments.

The opisthosoma comprised 12 segments and the telson, the posteriormost division of the body, which in most species took the form of a blade-like shape. In some lineages, notably the Pterygotioidea, the Hibbertopteridae and the Mycteroptidae, the telson was flattened and may have been used as a rudder while swimming. Some genera within the superfamily Carcinosomatoidea, notably &quot;Eusarcana&quot;, had a telson similar to that of modern scorpions and may have been capable of using it to inject venom. The coxae of the sixth pair of appendages were overlaid by a plate that is referred to as the metastoma, originally derived from a complete exoskeleton segment. The opisthosoma itself can be divided either into a &quot;mesosoma&quot; (comprising segments 1 to 6) and &quot;metasoma&quot; (comprising segments 7 to 12) or into a &quot;preabdomen&quot; (generally comprising segments 1 to 7) and &quot;postabdomen&quot; (generally comprising segments 8 to 12).

The underside of the opisthosoma was covered in structures evolved from modified opisthosomal appendages. Throughout the opisthosoma, these structures formed plate-like structures termed ( in German). These created a branchial chamber (gill tract) between preceding and the ventral surface of the opisthosoma itself, which contained the respiratory organs. The second to sixth opisthosomal segments also contained oval or triangular organs that have been interpreted as organs that aid in respiration. These organs, termed or &quot;gill tracts&quot;, would potentially have aided eurypterids to breathe air above water, while , similar to organs in modern horseshoe crabs, would cover the parts that serve for underwater respiration.

The appendages of opisthosomal segments 1 and 2 (the seventh and eighth segments overall) were fused into a structure termed the genital operculum, occupying most of the underside of the opisthosomal segment 2. Near the anterior margin of this structure, the genital appendage (also called the or the median abdominal appendage) protruded. This appendage, often preserved very prominently, has consistently been interpreted as part of the reproductive system and occurs in two recognized types, assumed to correspond to male and female.

==Biology==

===Size===

Eurypterids were highly variable in size, depending on factors such as lifestyle, living environment and taxonomic affinity. Sizes around are common in most eurypterid groups. The smallest eurypterid, &quot;Alkenopterus burglahrensis&quot;, measured just in length.

The largest eurypterid, and the largest known arthropod ever to have lived, is &quot;Jaekelopterus rhenaniae&quot;. A chelicera from the Emsian Klerf Formation of Willwerath, Germany measured in length, but is missing a quarter of its length, suggesting that the full chelicera would have been long. If the proportions between body length and chelicerae match those of its closest relatives, where the ratio between claw size and body length is relatively consistent, the specimen of &quot;Jaekelopterus&quot; that possessed the chelicera in question would have measured between , an average , in length. With the chelicerae extended, another meter (3.28 ft) would be added to this length. This estimate exceeds the maximum body size of all other known giant arthropods by almost half a meter (1.64 ft) even if the extended chelicerae are not included. Two other eurypterids have also been estimated to have reached lengths of 2.5 metres; &quot;Erettopterus grandis&quot; (closely related to &quot;Jaekelopterus&quot;) and &quot;Hibbertopterus wittebergensis&quot;, but &quot;E. grandis&quot; is very fragmentary and the &quot;H. wittenbergensis&quot; size estimate is based on trackway evidence, not fossil remains.

The family of &quot;Jaekelopterus&quot;, the Pterygotidae, is noted for several unusually large species. Both &quot;Acutiramus&quot;, whose largest member &quot;A. bohemicus&quot; measured , and &quot;Pterygotus,&quot; whose largest species &quot;P. grandidentatus&quot; measured , were gigantic. Several different contributing factors to the large size of the pterygotids have been suggested, including courtship behaviour, predation and competition over environmental resources.

Giant eurypterids were not limited to the family Pterygotidae. An isolated long fossil metastoma of the carcinosomatoid eurypterid &quot;Carcinosoma punctatum&quot; indicates the animal would have reached a length of in life, rivalling the pterygotids in size. Another giant was &quot;Pentecopterus decorahensis&quot;, a primitive carcinosomatoid, which is estimated to have reached lengths of .

Typical of large eurypterids is a lightweight build. Factors such as locomotion, energy costs in molting and respiration, as well as the actual physical properties of the exoskeleton, limit the size that arthropods can reach. A lightweight construction significantly decreases the influence of these factors. Pterygotids were particularly lightweight, with most fossilized large body segments preserving as thin and unmineralized. Lightweight adaptations are present in other giant paleozoic arthropods as well, such as the giant millipede &quot;Arthropleura&quot;, and are possibly vital for the evolution of giant size in arthropods.

In addition to the lightweight giant eurypterids, some deep-bodied forms in the family Hibbertopteridae were also very large. A carapace from the Carboniferous of Scotland referred to the species &quot;Hibbertoperus scouleri&quot; measures wide. As &quot;Hibbertopterus&quot; was very wide compared to its length, the animal in question could possibly have measured just short of in length. More robust than the pterygotids, this giant &quot;Hibbertopterus&quot; would possibly have rivalled the largest pterygotids in weight, if not surpassed them, and as such be among the heaviest arthropods.

===Locomotion===
The two eurypterid suborders, Eurypterina and Stylonurina, are distinguished primarily by the morphology of their final pair of appendages. In the Stylonurina, this appendage takes the form of a long and slender walking leg, while in the Eurypterina, the leg is modified and broadened into a swimming paddle. Other than the swimming paddle, the legs of many eurypterines were far too small to do much more than allow them to crawl across the sea floor. In contrast, a number of stylonurines had elongated and powerful legs that might have allowed them to walk on land (similar to modern crabs).

A fossil trackway was discovered in Carboniferous-aged fossil deposits of Scotland in 2005. It was attributed to the stylonurine eurypterid &quot;Hibbertopterus&quot; due to a matching size (the trackmaker was estimated to have been about long) and inferred leg anatomy. It is the largest terrestrial trackway—measuring long and averaging in width—made by an arthropod found thus far. It is the first record of land locomotion by a eurypterid. The trackway provides evidence that some eurypterids could survive in terrestrial environments, at least for short periods of time, and reveals information about the stylonurine gait. In &quot;Hibbertopterus&quot;, as in most eurypterids, the pairs of appendages are different in size (referred to as a heteropodous limb condition). These differently sized pairs would have moved in phase, and the short stride length indicates that &quot;Hibbertopterus&quot; crawled with an exceptionally slow speed, at least on land. The large telson was dragged along the ground and left a large central groove behind the animal. Slopes in the tracks at random intervals suggest that the motion was jerky. The gait of smaller stylonurines, such as &quot;Parastylonurus&quot;, was probably faster and more precise.

The functionality of the eurypterine swimming paddles varied from group to group. In the Eurypteroidea, the paddles were similar in shape to oars. The condition of the joints in their appendages ensured their paddles could only be moved in near-horizontal planes, not upwards or downwards. Some other groups, such as the Pterygotioidea, would not have possessed this condition and were probably able to swim faster. Most eurypterines are generally agreed to have utilized a rowing type of propulsion similar to that of crabs and water beetles. Larger individuals may have been capable of underwater flying (or subaqueous flight) in which the motion and shape of the paddles are enough to generate lift, similar to the swimming of sea turtles and sea lions. This type of movement has a relatively slower acceleration rate than the rowing type, especially since adults have proportionally smaller paddles than juveniles. However, since the larger sizes of adults mean a higher drag coefficient, using this type of propulsion is more energy-efficient.

Some eurypterines, such as &quot;Mixopterus&quot; (as inferred from attributed fossil trackways), were not necessarily good swimmers. It likely kept mostly to the bottom, using its swimming paddles for occasional bursts of movements vertically, with the fourth and fifth pairs of appendages positioned backwards to produce minor movement forwards. While walking, it probably used a gait like that of most modern insects. The weight of its long abdomen would have been balanced by two heavy and specialized frontal appendages, and the center of gravity might have been adjustable by raising and positioning the tail.

Preserved fossilized eurypterid trackways tend to be large and heteropodous and often have an associated telson drag mark along the mid-line (as with the Scottish &quot;Hibbertopterus&quot; track). Such trackways have been discovered on every continent except for South America. In some places where eurypterid fossil remains are otherwise rare, such as in South Africa and the rest of the former supercontinent Gondwana, the discoveries of trackways both predate and outnumber eurypterid body fossils. Eurypterid trackways have been referred to several ichnogenera, most notably &quot;Palmichnium&quot; (defined as a series of four tracks often with an associated drag mark in the mid-line), wherein the holotype of the ichnospecies &quot;P. kosinkiorum&quot; preserves the largest eurypterid footprints known to date with the found tracks each being about in diameter. Other eurypterid ichnogenera include &quot;Merostomichnites&quot; (though it is likely that many specimens actually represent trackways of crustaceans) and &quot;Arcuites&quot; (which preserves grooves made by the swimming appendages).

===Respiration===

In eurypterids, the respiratory organs were located on the ventral body wall (the underside of the opisthosoma). , evolved from opisthosomal appendages, covered the underside and created a gill chamber where the &quot;gill tracts&quot; were located. Depending on the species, the eurypterid gill tract was either triangular or oval in shape and was possibly raised into a cushion-like state. The surface of this gill tract bore several spinules (small spines), which resulted in an enlarged surface area. It was composed of spongy tissue due to many invaginations in the structure.

Though the is referred to as a &quot;gill tract&quot;, it may not necessarily have functioned as actual gills. In other animals, gills are used for oxygen uptake from water and are outgrowths of the body wall. Despite eurypterids clearly being primarily aquatic animals that almost certainly evolved underwater (some eurypterids, such as the pterygotids, would even have been physically unable to walk on land), it is unlikely the &quot;gill tract&quot; contained functional gills when comparing the organ to gills in other invertebrates and even fish. Previous interpretations often identified the eurypterid &quot;gills&quot; as homologous with those of other groups (hence the terminology), with gas exchange occurring within the spongy tract and a pattern of branchio-cardiac and dendritic veins (as in related groups) carrying oxygenated blood into the body. The primary analogy used in previous studies has been horseshoe crabs, though their gill structure and that of eurypterids are remarkably different. In horseshoe crabs, the gills are more complex and composed of many lamellae (plates) which give a larger surface area used for gas exchange. In addition, the gill tract of eurypterids is proportionally much too small to support them if it is analogous to the gills of other groups. To be functional gills, they would have to have been highly efficient and would have required a highly efficient circulatory system. It is considered unlikely, however, that these factors would be enough to explain the large discrepancy between gill tract size and body size.

It has been suggested instead that the &quot;gill tract&quot; was an organ for breathing air, perhaps actually being a lung, plastron or a pseudotrachea. Plastrons are organs that some arthropods evolved secondarily to breathe air underwater. This is considered an unlikely explanation since eurypterids had evolved in water from the start and they would not have organs evolved from air-breathing organs present. In addition, plastrons are generally exposed on outer parts of the body while the eurypterid gill tract is located behind the . Instead, among arthropod respiratory organs, the eurypterid gill tracts most closely resemble the pseudotracheae found in modern isopods. These organs, called pseudotracheae, because of some resemblance to the tracheae (windpipes) of air-breathing organisms, are lung-like and present within the pleopods (back legs) of isopods. The structure of the pseudotracheae has been compared to the spongy structure of the eurypterid gill tracts. It is possible the two organs functioned in the same way.

Some researchers have suggested that eurypterids may have been adapted to an amphibious lifestyle, using the full gill tract structure as gills and the invaginations within it as pseudotrachea. This mode of life may not have been physiologically possible, however, since water pressure would have forced water into the invaginations leading to asphyxiation. Furthermore, most eurypterids would have been aquatic their entire lives. No matter how much time was spent on land, organs for respiration in underwater environments must have been present. True gills, expected to have been located within the branchial chamber within the , remain unknown in eurypterids.

===Ontogeny===

Like all arthropods, eurypterids matured and grew through static developmental stages referred to as instars. These instars were punctuated by periods during which eurypterids went through ecdysis (molting of the cuticle) after which they underwent rapid and immediate growth. Some arthropods, such as insects and many crustaceans, undergo extreme changes over the course of maturing. Chelicerates, including eurypterids, are in general considered to be direct developers, undergoing no extreme changes after hatching (though extra body segments and extra limbs may be gained over the course of ontogeny in some lineages, such as xiphosurans and sea spiders). Whether eurypterids were true direct developers (with hatchlings more or less being identical to adults) or hemianamorphic direct developers (with extra segments and limbs potentially being added during ontogeny) has been controversial in the past.

Hemianamorphic direct development has been observed in many arthropod groups, such as trilobites, megacheirans, basal crustaceans and basal myriapods. True direct development has on occasion been referred to as a trait unique to arachnids. There have been few studies on eurypterid ontogeny as there is a general lack of specimens in the fossil record that can confidently be stated to represent juveniles. It is possible that many eurypterid species thought to be distinct actually represent juvenile specimens of other species, with paleontologists rarely considering the influence of ontogeny when describing new species.

Studies on a well-preserved fossil assemblage of eurypterids from the Pragian-aged Beartooth Butte Formation in Cottonwood Canyon, Wyoming, composed of multiple specimens of various developmental stages of eurypterids &quot;Jaekelopterus&quot; and &quot;Strobilopterus&quot;, revealed that eurypterid ontogeny was more or less parallel and similar to that of extinct and extant xiphosurans, with the largest exception being that eurypterids hatched with a full set of appendages and opisthosomal segments. Eurypterids were thus not hemianamorphic direct developers, but true direct developers like modern arachnids.

The most frequently observed change occurring through ontogeny (except for some genera, such as &quot;Eurypterus&quot;, which appear to have been static) is the metastoma becoming proportionally less wide. This ontogenetic change has been observed in members of several superfamilies, such as the Eurypteroidea, the Pterygotioidea and the Moselopteroidea.

===Feeding===

No fossil gut contents from eurypterids are known, so direct evidence of their diet is lacking. The eurypterid biology is particularly suggestive of a carnivorous lifestyle. Not only were many large (in general, most predators tend to be larger than their prey), but they had stereoscopic vision (the ability to perceive depth). The legs of many eurypterids were covered in thin spines, used both for locomotion and the gathering of food. In some groups, these spiny appendages became heavily specialized. In some eurypterids in the Carcinosomatoidea, forward-facing appendages were large and possessed enormously elongated spines (as in &quot;Mixopterus&quot; and &quot;Megalograptus&quot;). In derived members of the Pterygotioidea, the appendages were completely without spines, but had specialized claws instead. Other eurypterids, lacking these specialized appendages, likely fed in a manner similar to modern horseshoe crabs, by grabbing and shredding food with their appendages before pushing it into their mouth using their chelicerae.

Fossils preserving digestive tracts have been reported from fossils of various eurypterids, among them &quot;Carcinosoma&quot;, &quot;Acutiramus&quot; and &quot;Eurypterus&quot;. Though a potential anal opening has been reported from the telson of a specimen of &quot;Buffalopterus&quot;, it is more likely that the anus was opened through the thin cuticle between the last segment before the telson and the telson itself, as in modern horseshoe crabs.

Eurypterid coprolites discovered in deposits of Ordovician age in Ohio containing fragments of a trilobite and eurypterid &quot;Megalograptus ohioensis&quot; in association with full specimens of the same eurypterid species have been suggested to represent evidence of cannibalism. Similar coprolites referred to the species &quot;Lanarkopterus dolichoschelus&quot; from the Ordovician of Ohio contain fragments of jawless fish and fragments of smaller specimens of &quot;Lanarkopterus&quot; itself.

Though apex predatory roles would have been limited to the very largest eurypterids, smaller eurypterids were likely formidable predators in their own right just like their larger relatives.

===Reproductive biology===
As in many other entirely extinct groups, understanding and researching the reproduction and sexual dimorphism of eurypterids is difficult, as they are only known from fossilized shells and carapaces. In some cases, there might not be enough apparent differences to separate the sexes based on morphology alone. Sometimes two sexes of the same species have been interpreted as two different species, as was the case with two species of &quot;Drepanopterus&quot; (&quot;D. bembycoides&quot; and &quot;D. lobatus&quot;).

The eurypterid prosoma is made up of the first six exoskeleton segments fused together into a larger structure. The seventh segment (thus the first opisthosomal segment) is referred to as the &quot;metastoma&quot; and the eighth segment (distinctly plate-like) is called the &quot;operculum&quot; and contains the genital aperature. The underside of this segment is occupied by the genital operculum, a structure originally evolved from ancestral seventh and eighth pair of appendages. In its center, as in modern horseshoe crabs, is a genital appendage. This appendage, an elongated rod with an internal duct, is found in two distinct morphs, generally referred to as &quot;type A&quot; and &quot;type B&quot;. These genital appendages are often preserved prominently in fossils and have been the subject of various interpretations of eurypterid reproduction and sexual dimorphism.

Type A appendages are generally longer than those of type B. In some genera they are divided into different numbers of sections, such as in &quot;Eurypterus&quot; where the type A appendage is divided into three but the type B appendage into only two. Such division of the genital appendage is common in eurypterids, but the number is not universal; for instance, the appendages of both types in the family Pterygotidae are undivided. The type A appendage is also armed with two curved spines called (lit. &#x27;fork&#x27; in Latin). The presence of in the type B appendage is also possible and the structure may represent the unfused tips of the appendages. Located between the dorsal and ventral surfaces of the associated with the type A appendages is a set of organs traditionally described as either &quot;tubular organs&quot; or &quot;horn organs&quot;. These organs are most often interpreted as spermathecae (organs for storing sperm), though this function is yet to be proven conclusively. In arthropods, spermathecae are used to store the spermatophore received from males. This would imply that the type A appendage is the female morph and the type B appendage is the male. Further evidence for the type A appendages representing the female morph of genital appendages comes in their more complex construction (a general trend for female arthropod genitalia). It is possible that the greater length of the type A appendage means that it was used as an ovipositor (used to deposit eggs). The different types of genital appendages are not necessarily the only feature that distinguishes between the sexes of eurypterids. Depending on the genus and species in question, other features such as size, the amount of ornamentation, and the proportional width of the body can be the result of sexual dimorphism. In general, eurypterids with type B appendages (males) appear to have been proportionally wider than eurypterids with type A appendages (females) of the same genera.
The primary function of the long, assumed female, type A appendages was likely to take up spermatophore from the substrate into the reproductive tract rather than to serve as an ovipositor, as arthropod ovipositors are generally longer than eurypterid type A appendages. By rotating the sides of the operculum, it would have been possible to lower the appendage from the body. Due to the way different plates overlay at its location, the appendage would have been impossible to move without muscular contractions moving around the operculum. It would have been kept in place when not it use. The on the type A appendages may have aided in breaking open the spermatophore to release the free sperm inside for uptake. The &quot;horn organs,&quot; possibly spermathecae, are thought to have been connected directly to the appendage via tracts, but these supposed tracts remain unpreserved in available fossil material.

Type B appendages, assumed male, would have produced, stored and perhaps shaped spermatophore in a heart-shaped structure on the dorsal surface of the appendage. A broad genital opening would have allowed large amounts of spermatophore to be released at once. The long associated with type B appendages, perhaps capable of being lowered like the type A appendage, could have been used to detect whether a substrate was suitable for spermatophore deposition.

==Evolutionary history==

===Origins===

Until 1882 no eurypterids were known from before the Silurian. Contemporary discoveries since the 1880s have expanded the knowledge of early eurypterids from the Ordovician period. The earliest eurypterids known today, the megalograptid &quot;Pentecopterus&quot;, date from the Darriwilian stage of the Middle Ordovician, 467.3 million years ago. There are also reports of even earlier fossil eurypterids in the Fezouata Biota of Late Tremadocian (Early Ordovician) age in Morocco, but these have yet to be thoroughly studied, and are likely to be peytoiid appendages.

&quot;Pentecopterus&quot; was a relatively derived eurypterid, part of the megalograptid family within the carcinosomatoid superfamily. Its derived position suggests that most eurypterid clades, at least within the eurypterine suborder, had already been established at this point during the Middle Ordovician. The earliest known stylonurine eurypterid, &quot;Brachyopterus&quot;, is also Middle Ordovician in age. The presence of members of both suborders indicates that primitive stem-eurypterids would have preceded them, though these are so far unknown in the fossil record. The presence of several eurypterid clades during the Middle Ordovician suggests that eurypterids either originated during the Early Ordovician and experienced a rapid and explosive radiation and diversification soon after the first forms evolved, or that the group originated much earlier, perhaps during the Cambrian period.

As such, the exact eurypterid time of origin remains unknown. Though fossils referred to as &quot;primitive eurypterids&quot; have occasionally been described from deposits of Cambrian or even Precambrian age, they are not recognized as eurypterids, and sometimes not even as related forms, today. Some animals previously seen as primitive eurypterids, such as the genus &quot;Strabops&quot; from the Cambrian of Missouri, are now classified as aglaspidids or strabopids. The aglaspidids, once seen as primitive chelicerates, are now seen as a group more closely related to trilobites.

The fossil record of Ordovician eurypterids is quite poor. The majority of eurypterids once reportedly known from the Ordovician have since proven to be misidentifications or pseudofossils. Today only 11 species can be confidently identified as representing Ordovician eurypterids. These taxa fall into two distinct ecological categories; large and active predators from the ancient continent of Laurentia, and demersal (living on the seafloor) and basal animals from the continents Avalonia and Gondwana. The Laurentian predators, classified in the family Megalograptidae (comprising the genera &quot;Echinognathus&quot;, &quot;Megalograptus&quot; and &quot;Pentecopterus&quot;), are likely to represent the first truly successful eurypterid group, experiencing a small radiation during the Late Ordovician.

===Silurian===

Eurypterids were most diverse and abundant between the Middle Silurian and the Early Devonian, with an absolute peak in diversity during the Pridoli epoch, 423 to 419.2 million years ago, of the very latest Silurian. This peak in diversity has been recognized since the early twentieth century; of the approximately 150 species of eurypterids known in 1916, more than half were from the Silurian and a third were from the Late Silurian alone.

Though stylonurine eurypterids generally remained rare and low in number, as had been the case during the preceding Ordovician, eurypterine eurypterids experienced a rapid rise in diversity and number. In most Silurian fossil beds, eurypterine eurypterids account for 90% of all eurypterids present. Though some were likely already present by the Late Ordovician (simply missing from the fossil record so far), a vast majority of eurypterid groups are first recorded in strata of Silurian age. These include both stylonurine groups such as the Stylonuroidea, Kokomopteroidea and Mycteropoidea as well as eurypterine groups such as the Pterygotioidea, Eurypteroidea and Waeringopteroidea.

The most successful eurypterid by far was the Middle to Late Silurian &quot;Eurypterus&quot;, a generalist, equally likely to have engaged in predation or scavenging. Thought to have hunted mainly small and soft-bodied invertebrates, such as worms, species of the genus (of which the most common is the type species, &quot;E. remipes&quot;) account for more than 90% (perhaps as many as 95%) of all known fossil eurypterid specimens. Despite their vast number, &quot;Eurypterus&quot; are only known from a relatively short temporal range, first appearing during the Late Llandovery epoch (around 432 million years ago) and being extinct by the end of the Pridoli epoch. &quot;Eurypterus&quot; was also restricted to the continent Euramerica (composed of the equatorial continents Avalonia, Baltica and Laurentia), which had been completely colonized by the genus during its merging and was unable to cross the vast expanses of ocean separating this continent from other parts of the world, such as the southern supercontinent Gondwana. As such, &quot;Eurypterus&quot; was limited geographically to the coastlines and shallow inland seas of Euramerica.

During the Late Silurian the pterygotid eurypterids, large and specialized forms with several new adaptations, such as large and flattened telsons capable of being used as rudders, and large and specialized chelicerae with enlarged pincers for handling (and potentially in some cases killing) prey appeared. Though the largest members of the family appeared in the Devonian, large two meter (6.5+ ft) pterygotids such as &quot;Acutiramus&quot; were already present during the Late Silurian. Their ecology ranged from generalized predatory behavior to ambush predation and some, such as &quot;Pterygotus&quot; itself, were active apex predators in Late Silurian marine ecosystems. The pterygotids were also evidently capable of crossing oceans, becoming one of only two eurypterid groups to achieve a cosmopolitan distribution.

===Devonian===

Though the eurypterids continued to be abundant and diversify during the Early Devonian (for instance leading to the evolution of the pterygotid &quot;Jaekelopterus&quot;, the largest of all arthropods), the group was one of many heavily affected by the Late Devonian extinction. The extinction event, only known to affect marine life (particularly trilobites, brachiopods and reef-building organisms) effectively crippled the abundance and diversity previously seen within the eurypterids.

A major decline in diversity had already begun during the Early Devonian and eurypterids were rare in marine environments by the Late Devonian. During the Frasnian stage four families went extinct, and the later Famennian saw an additional five families going extinct. As marine groups were the most affected, the eurypterids were primarily impacted within the eurypterine suborder. Only one group of stylonurines (the family Parastylonuridae) went extinct in the Early Devonian. Only two families of eurypterines survived into the Late Devonian at all (Adelophthalmidae and Waeringopteridae). The eurypterines experienced their most major declines in the Early Devonian, during which over 50% of their diversity was lost in just 10 million years. Stylonurines, on the other hand, persisted through the period with more or less consistent diversity and abundance but were affected during the Late Devonian, when many of the older groups were replaced by new forms in the families Mycteroptidae and Hibbertopteridae.

It is possible that the catastrophic extinction patterns seen in the eurypterine suborder were related to the emergence of more derived fish. Eurypterine decline began at the point when jawless fish first became more developed and coincides with the emergence of placoderms (armored fish) in both North America and Europe.

Stylonurines of the surviving hibbertopterid and mycteroptid families completely avoided competition with fish by evolving towards a new and distinct ecological niche. These families experienced a radiation and diversification through the Late Devonian and Early Carboniferous, the last ever radiation within the eurypterids, which gave rise to several new forms capable of &quot;sweep-feeding&quot; (raking through the substrate in search of prey).

===Carboniferous and Permian===
 Only three eurypterid families—Adelophthalmidae, Hibbertopteridae and Mycteroptidae—survived the extinction event in its entirety. It was assumed that these were all freshwater animals, which would have rendered the eurypterids extinct in marine environments, and with marine eurypterid predators gone, sarcopterygians, such as the rhizodonts, were the new apex predators in marine environments. However, various recent findings raise doubts about this, and suggest that these eurypterids were euryhaline forms that lived in marginal marine environments, such as estuaries, deltas, lagoons, and coastal ponds. One argument is paleobiogeographical; pterygotoid distribution seems to require oceanic dispersal. A recent review of Adelophthalmoidea admitted that &quot;There is much more of a marine influence in many of the sections yielding &quot;Adelophthalmus&quot; than has previously been acknowledged.&quot; Similarly, a study of the eurypterid &quot;Hibbertopterus&quot; from the Carboniferous of New Mexico concluded that the habitat of some eurypterids &quot;may need to be re-evaluated&quot;. The sole surviving eurypterine family, Adelophthalmidae, was represented by only a single genus, &quot;Adelophthalmus&quot;. The hibbertopterids, mycteroptids and &quot;Adelophthalmus&quot; survived into the Permian.

&quot;Adelophthalmus&quot; became the most common of all late Paleozoic eurypterids, existing in greater number and diversity than surviving stylonurines, and diversified in the absence of other eurypterines. Out of the 33 species referred to &quot;Adelophthalmus&quot;, 23 (69%) are from the Carboniferous alone. The genus reached its peak diversity in the Late Carboniferous. Though &quot;Adelophthalmus&quot; had already been relatively widespread and represented around all major landmasses in the Late Devonian, the amalgamation of Pangaea into a global supercontinent over the course of the last two periods of the Paleozoic allowed &quot;Adelophthalmus&quot; to gain an almost worldwide distribution.

During the Late Carboniferous and Early Permian &quot;Adelophthalmus&quot; was widespread, living primarily in brackish and freshwater environments adjacent to coastal plains. These environments were maintained by favorable climate conditions. They did not persist as climate changes owing to Pangaea&#x27;s formation altered depositional and vegetational patterns across the world. With their habitat gone, &quot;Adelophthalmus&quot; dwindled in number and had already gone extinct by the Leonardian stage of the Early Permian.

Mycteroptids and hibbertopterids continued to survive for some time, with one genus of each group known from Permian strata: &quot;Hastimima&quot; and &quot;Campylocephalus&quot; respectively. &quot;Hastimima&quot; went extinct during the Early Permian, as &quot;Adelophthalmus&quot; had, while &quot;Campylocephalus&quot; persisted longer. A massive incomplete carapace from Permian deposits in Russia represents the sole fossil remains of the species &quot;C. permianus&quot;, which might have reached in length, while originally considered to be Late Permian in age other sources suggest a Kungurian-Roadian age (~283-267 million years ago) for the specimen. A fragment of eurypterid cuticle, given the species name &quot;Woodwardopterus freemanorum&quot; is known from the terminal Permian of Australia, which represents the youngest known eurypterid. No eurypterids are known from fossil beds higher than the Permian. This indicates that the last eurypterids died either in the catastrophic extinction event at its end or at some point shortly before it. This extinction event, the Permian–Triassic extinction event, is the most devastating mass extinction recorded, and rendered many other successful Paleozoic groups, such as the trilobites, extinct.

==History of study==
The first known eurypterid specimen was discovered in the Silurian-aged rocks of New York, to this day one of the richest eurypterid fossil locations. Samuel L. Mitchill described the specimen, discovered near Westmoreland in Oneida county in 1818. He erroneously identified the fossil as an example of the fish &quot;Silurus&quot;, likely due to the strange, catfish-like appearance of the carapace. Seven years later, in 1825, James E. DeKay examined the fossil and recognized it as clearly belonging to an arthropod. He thought the fossil, which he named &quot;Eurypterus remipes&quot;, represented a crustacean of the order Branchiopoda, and suggested it might represent a missing link between the trilobites and more derived branchiopods. The name &quot;Eurypterus&quot; derives from Greek ( &#x27;broad, wide&#x27;) and ( &#x27;wing&#x27;).

In 1843, Hermann Burmeister published his view on trilobite taxonomy and how the group related to other organisms, living and extinct, in the work &quot;Die Organisation der Trilobiten aus ihren lebenden Verwandten entwickelt&quot;. He considered the trilobites to be crustaceans, as previous authors had, and classified them together with what he assumed to be their closest relatives, &quot;Eurypterus&quot; and the genus &quot;Cytherina&quot;, within a clade he named &quot;Palaeadae&quot;. Within Palaeadae, Burmeister erected three families; the &quot;Trilobitae&quot; (composed of all trilobites), the &quot;Cytherinidae&quot; (composed only of &quot;Cytherina&quot;, an animal today seen as an ostracod) and the Eurypteridae (composed of &quot;Eurypterus&quot;, then including three species).

The fourth eurypterid genus to be described (following &quot;Hibbertopterus&quot; in 1836 and &quot;Campylocephalus&quot; in 1838, not identified as eurypterids until later), out of those still seen as taxonomically valid in modern times, was &quot;Pterygotus&quot; (), described by Louis Agassiz in 1839. &quot;Pterygotus&quot; was considerably larger in size than &quot;Eurypterus&quot; and when the first fossils were discovered by quarrymen in Scotland they were referred to as &quot;Seraphims&quot; by the workers. Agassiz first thought the fossils represented remains of fish, only recognizing their nature as arthropod remains five years later in 1844.

In 1849, Frederick M&#x27;Coy classified &quot;Pterygotus&quot; together with &quot;Eurypterus&quot; and &quot;Belinurus&quot; (a genus today seen as a xiphosuran) within Burmeister&#x27;s Eurypteridae. M&#x27;Coy considered the Eurypteridae to be a group of crustaceans within the order Entomostraca, closely related to horseshoe crabs. A fourth genus, &quot;Slimonia&quot;, based on fossil remains previously assigned to a new species of &quot;Pterygotus&quot;, was referred to the Eurypteridae in 1856 by David Page.

Jan Nieszkowski&#x27;s &quot;De Euryptero Remipede&quot; (1858) featured an extensive description of &quot;Eurypterus fischeri&quot; (now seen as synonymous with another species of &quot;Eurypterus&quot;, &quot;E. tetragonophthalmus&quot;), which, along with the monograph &quot;On the Genus Pterygotus&quot; by Thomas Henry Huxley and John William Salter, and an exhaustive description of the various eurypterids of New York in Volume 3 of the &quot;Palaeontology of New York&quot; (1859) by James Hall, contributed massively to the understanding of eurypterid diversity and biology. These publications were the first to fully describe the whole anatomy of eurypterids, recognizing the full number of prosomal appendages and the number of preabdominal and postabdominal segments. Both Nieszkowski and Hall recognized that the eurypterids were closely related to modern chelicerates, such as horseshoe crabs.

In 1865, Henry Woodward described the genus &quot;Stylonurus&quot; (named and figured, but not thoroughly described, by David Page in 1856) and raised the rank of the Eurypteridae to that of order, effectively creating the Eurypterida as the taxonomic unit it is seen as today. In the work &quot;Anatomy and Relations of the Eurypterida&quot; (1893), Malcolm Laurie added considerably to the knowledge and discussion of eurypterid anatomy and relations. He focused on how the eurypterids related to each other and to trilobites, crustaceans, scorpions, other arachnids and horseshoe crabs. The description of &quot;Eurypterus fischeri&quot; by Gerhard Holm in 1896 was so elaborate that the species became one of the most completely known of all extinct animals, so much so that the knowledge of &quot;E. fischeri&quot; was comparable with the knowledge of its modern relatives (such as the Atlantic horseshoe crab). The description also helped solidify the close relationship between the eurypterids and other chelicerates by showcasing numerous homologies between the two groups.

In 1912, John Mason Clarke and Rudolf Ruedemann published &quot;The Eurypterida of New York&quot; in which all eurypterid species thus far recovered from fossil deposits there were discussed. Clarke and Ruedemann created one of the first phylogenetic trees of eurypterids, dividing the order into two families; Eurypteridae (distinguished by smooth eyes and including &quot;Eurypterus&quot;, &quot;Anthraconectes&quot;, &quot;Stylonurus&quot;, &quot;Eusarcus&quot;, &quot;Dolichopterus&quot;, &quot;Onychopterus&quot; and &quot;Drepanopterus&quot;) and Pterygotidae (distinguished by faceted eyes and including &quot;Pterygotus&quot;, &quot;Erettopterus&quot;, &quot;Slimonia&quot; and &quot;Hughmilleria&quot;). Both families were considered to be descended from a common ancestor, &quot;Strabops&quot;. In line with earlier authors, Clarke and Ruedemann also supported a close relationship between the eurypterids and the horseshoe crabs (united under the class Merostomata) but also discussed alternative hypotheses such as a closer relation to arachnids.

==Classification==
Historically, a close relationship between eurypterids and xiphosurans (such as the modern Atlantic horseshoe crab) has been assumed by most researchers. Several homologies encourage this view, such as correlating segments of the appendages and the prosoma. Additionally, the presence of plate-like appendages bearing the &quot;gill tracts&quot; on appendages of the opisthosoma (the ) was cited early as an important homology. In the last few decades of the nineteenth century, further homologies were established, such as the similar structures of the compound eyes of &quot;Pterygotus&quot; and horseshoe crabs (seen as especially decisive as the eye of the horseshoe crab was seen as possessing an almost unique structure) and similarities in the ontogeny within both groups. These ontogenetical similarities were seen as most apparent when studying the nepionic stages (the developmental stage immediately following the embryonic stage) in both groups, during which both xiphosurans and eurypterids have a proportionally larger carapace than adults, are generally broader, possess a distinct ridge down the middle, have a lesser number of segments which lack differentiation and have an underdeveloped telson.

Due to these similarities, the xiphosurans and eurypterids have often been united under a single class or subclass called Merostomata (erected to house both groups by Henry Woodward in 1866). Though xiphosurans (like the eurypterids) were historically seen as crustaceans due to their respiratory system and their aquatic lifestyle, this hypothesis was discredited after numerous similarities were discovered between the horseshoe crabs and the arachnids. Some authors, such as John Sterling Kingsley in 1894, classified the Merostomata as a sister group to the Arachnida under the class &quot;Acerata&quot; within a subphylum &quot;Branchiata&quot;. Others, such as Ray Lankester in 1909, went further and classified the Merostomata as a subclass within the Arachnida, raised to the rank of class.

In 1866, Ernst Haeckel classified the Merostomata (containing virtually only the Eurypterida) and Xiphosura within a group he named Gigantostraca within the crustaceans. Though Haeckel did not designate any taxonomic rank for this clade, it was interpreted as equivalent to the rank of subclass, such as the Malacostraca and Entomostraca, by later researchers such as John Sterling Kinsgsley. In subsequent research, Gigantostraca has been treated as synonymous with Merostomata (rarely) and Eurypterida itself (more commonly).
A phylogenetic analysis (the results presented in a cladogram below) conducted by James Lamsdell in 2013 on the relationships within the Xiphosura and the relations to other closely related groups (including the eurypterids, which were represented in the analysis by genera &quot;Eurypterus&quot;, &quot;Parastylonurus&quot;, &quot;Rhenopterus&quot; and &quot;Stoermeropterus&quot;) concluded that the Xiphosura, as presently understood, was paraphyletic (a group sharing a last common ancestor but not including all descendants of this ancestor) and thus not a valid phylogenetic group. Eurypterids were recovered as closely related to arachnids instead of xiphosurans, forming the group Sclerophorata within the clade Dekatriata (composed of sclerophorates and chasmataspidids). Lamsdell noted that it is possible that Dekatriata is synonymous with Sclerophorata as the reproductive system, the primary defining feature of sclerophorates, has not been thoroughly studied in chasmataspidids. Dekatriata is, in turn, part of the Prosomapoda, a group including the Xiphosurida (the only monophyletic xiphosuran group) and other stem-genera.

===Internal relationships===
The internal classification of eurypterids within the Eurypterida is based mainly on eleven established characters. These have been used throughout the history of eurypterid research to establish clades and genera. These characters include: the shape of the prosoma, the shape of the metastoma, the shape and position of the eyes, the types of prosomal appendages, the types of swimming leg paddles, the structure of the doublure (the fringe of the dorsal exoskeleton), the structure of the opithosoma, the structure of the genital appendages, the shape of the telson and the type of ornamentation present. It is worth noting that not all of these characters are of equal taxonomic importance. They are not applicable to all eurypterids either; stylonurine eurypterids lack swimming leg paddles entirely. Some characters, including the prosoma and metastoma shapes and the position and shapes of the eyes, are seen as important only for the distinction between different genera. Most superfamilies and families are defined based on the morphology of the appendages.

The most important character used in eurypterid taxonomy is the type of prosomal appendages as this character is used to define entire suborders. General leg anatomy can also be used to define superfamilies and families. Historically, the chelicerae were considered the most important appendages from a taxonomical standpoint since they only occurred in two general types: a eurypterid type with small and toothless pincers and a pterygotid type with large pincers and teeth. This distinction has historically been used to divide the Eurypterida into the two suborders Eurypterina (small chelicerae) and &quot;Pterygotina&quot; (large and powerful chelicerae). This classification scheme is not without problems. In Victor Tollerton&#x27;s 1989 taxonomic revision of the Eurypterida, with suborders Eurypterina and Pterygotina recognized, several clades of eurypterids today recognized as stylonurines (including hibbertopterids and mycteroptids) were reclassified as non-eurypterids in the new separate order &quot;Cyrtoctenida&quot; on the grounds of perceived inconsistencies in the prosomal appendages.

Modern research favors a classification into suborders Eurypterina and Stylonurina instead, supported by phylogenetic analyses. In particular, pterygotid eurypterids share a number of homologies with derived eurypterine eurypterids such as the adelophthalmids, and are thus best classified as derived members of the same suborder. In the Stylonurina, the sixth pair of appendages is represented by long and slender walking legs and lack a modified spine (referred to as the podomere 7a). In most eurypterids in the Eurypterina, the sixth pair of appendages is broadened into swimming paddles and always has a podomere 7a. 75% of eurypterid species are eurypterines and they represent 99% of all fossil eurypterid specimens. Of all eurypterid clades, the Pterygotioidea is the most species-rich, with over 50 species. The second most species-rich clade is the Adelophthalmoidea, with over 40 species.

The cladogram presented below, covering all currently recognized eurypterid families, follows a 2007 study by O. Erik Tetlie. The stylonurine suborder follows a 2010 study by James Lamsdell, Simon J. Braddy and Tetlie. The superfamily &quot;Megalograptoidea&quot;, recognized by Tetlie in 2007 and then placed between the Onychopterelloidea and Eurypteroidea, has been omitted as more recent studies suggest that the megalograptids were members of the superfamily Carcinosomatoidea. As such, the phylogeny of the Carcinosomatoidea follows a 2015 study by Lamsdell and colleagues.

<text>USS &quot;Lassen&quot; (DDG-82) is the 32nd &quot;Arleigh Burke-class&quot; (Flight IIA) Aegis guided missile destroyer in the United States Navy. She is named for Medal of Honor recipient Commander Clyde Everett Lassen. &quot;Lassen&quot; was the 14th ship of this class to be built by Ingalls Shipbuilding at Pascagoula, Mississippi, and construction began on 24 August 1998. She was launched and christened on 16 October 1999. On 21 April 2001, she was commissioned at the Florida Aquarium Pier in Tampa, Florida.

==Service history ==

She was homeported in San Diego until she shifted homeport to Yokosuka Naval Base in Yokosuka, Japan in August 2005.

On 15 February 2009 at 12:25 pm, &quot;Lassen&quot; collided with a Japanese 14-ton pleasure boat in Yokosuka harbor. On 23 March 2009 the Japan Coast Guard filed a case against both the destroyer&#x27;s and the fishing boat&#x27;s captains with local prosecutors for professional negligence that endangered traffic.

On 1 July 2009, Fox News Channel reported that &quot;Lassen&quot; was tracking the North Korean ship &quot;Kang Nam 1&quot;, suspected of carrying contraband.

On 27 October 2015, &quot;Lassen&quot; conducted a 72-nautical mile transit through the Spratly Islands in the South China Sea and passed within 12 nautical miles of Subi Reef, one of seven artificial islands built up by China (commonly called the &quot;Great Wall of Sand&quot;), completing one of the most publicized freedom of navigation operations on record. This was the first time since 2012 that the US had directly challenged China&#x27;s claims in the Spratly Islands.

In January 2016, she moved to Naval Station Mayport in Mayport, Florida. According to the Standard Navy Distribution List, March 2016, at that time she was assigned to the new Naval Surface Squadron 14.

In 2020, in a joint effort with the US Coast Guard, an illegal drug shipment in the Caribbean near Navassa island was found.

In 2023, it was announced the ship would get a 120 million USD modernization.

==Awards==
* Arleigh Burke Fleet Trophy - (2019)

==Coat of arms==
=== Shield ===
&quot;The shield has background of blue with a medium blue chevron in the middle. Above the chevron is a sea lion, below is a compass rose.&quot; The traditional Navy colors were chosen for the shield because dark blue and gold represents the sea and excellence respectively. The AEGIS shield displays the ships modern warfare systems. The blue chevron is a symbol of the ships coastal service in the Vietnam War as well as the prow of the ship due to its mission as an ammunition ship. The chevron is also designed like the ribbon of the Medal of Honor awarded to Lieutenant Lassen for his heroism in his rescue of two aviators. The sea lion represents strength and courage which Lieutenant Lassen continuously displayed. The compass rose symbolizes the landing lights of the helicopter which he used to rescue the aviators.

=== Crest ===
&quot;The crest consists of a gold trident surrounded by red lightning bolts over palm fronds.&quot; The trident symbolizes sea prowess while the three tines represent the battle stars earned during World War II in the Pacific while denoting the multi-threat warfare systems of the USS &quot;Lassen&quot;. The red lightning bolts refer to the strike capability and mission as an ammunition ship, rearming many fleets during war.

=== Motto ===
&quot;The motto is written on a scroll of blue that has a gold reverse side.&quot; The ships motto is &quot;From Courage Life&quot;. The motto is a reference to both the honorable feats of Lieutenant Lassen and the Medal of Honor he received.

=== Seal ===
&quot;The coat of arms in full color as in the blazon, upon a white background enclosed within a dark blue oval border edged on the outside with a gold rope and bearing the inscription &quot;USS Lassen&quot; at the top and &quot;DDG 82&quot; in the base all gold.&quot;

<doc id="765468" wikidata="Q692375" url="?curid=765468" title="Bogachiel River">
<text>The Bogachiel River () is a river of the Olympic Peninsula in the U.S. state of Washington. It originates near Bogachiel Peak, and flows westward through the mountains of Olympic National Park. After emerging from the park it joins the Sol Duc River, forming the Quillayute River, which empties into the Pacific Ocean near La Push, Washington.

The Quillayute River system, with its main tributaries of the Bogachiel, Sol Duc, Calawah, and Dickey Rivers, drains the largest watershed on the north Olympic Peninsula.

The name &quot;Bogachiel&quot; is a corruption of the Quileute words &quot;bo qwa tcheel el&quot;, or &quot;/boqʷač&#x27;íʔl/&quot;, from &quot;/bó:q&#x27;ʷa/&quot;, &quot;muddy&quot;, and &quot;/číʔlowa/&quot;, &quot;water&quot;, meaning &quot;gets riley [turbid] after a rain&quot;, &quot;muddy waters&quot;, or, less likely, &quot;big river&quot;.

The river is often regarded today as a classical instance of a lowland forest ecosystem.
==Course==
The Bogachiel River begins in several headwater streams near Bogachiel Peak deep in the Olympic Mountains, in the northwest part of the Olympic Peninsula. Flowing west through a densely forested valley just north of the Hoh River valley, it gathers various mountain streams, including its main tributary, the North Fork Bogachiel River.

Below the North Fork confluence, the Bogachiel River flows along the boundary between Clallam County and Jefferson County, crossing and recrossing the county line many times. After gathering many more tributaries, such as Tumwata Creek and Hades Creek, it exits Olympic National Park. Skirting the boundary of the Olympic National Forest, the river turns northwest, passing through its namesake Bogachiel State Park. U.S. Highway 101 crosses the river via a bridge, and follows the Bogachiel valley for several miles in this vicinity. Just west of the city of Forks the Calawah River joins the Bogachiel. Forks is situated between the two rivers and takes its name from the forking streams.

Below the Calawah confluence the Bogachiel River widens considerably and takes a meandering course westward through a broad valley. The Sol Duc River enters this valley from the north, and the two streams meander alongside one another for several miles before joining. The Quillayute River, formed by their confluence, flows west for only about five miles more before reaching the Pacific Ocean at La Push. In its lower reach the Quillayute River enters the coastal wilderness of Olympic National Park. The mouth of the Quillayute is contained within the Quileute Indian Reservation.

==Natural history==

The upper Bogachiel River valley contains temperate rain forests, similar to the Hoh Rain Forest of the Hoh River valley.

==Recreation==
A large portion of the Bogachiel River is in the wilderness of Olympic National Park. The Bogachiel Trail, beginning a few miles outside the park, follows the Bogachiel River to the North Fork Bogachiel, then follows that river valley up to the High Divide, connecting to other trails that lead north to the Sol Duc River valley and south to the Hoh River valley.

The Bogachiel River, along with the Quillayute&#x27;s other tributaries, are popular for fishing. The rivers hosts healthy stocks of wild winter steelhead (the anadromous form of coastal rainbow trout) with as many as 19,000 fish returning in some years and up to 50,000 hatchery raised steelhead. The river also supports large runs of Chinook and coho salmon and holds resident populations of coastal cutthroat trout and Dolly Varden.

Unlike many other large rivers of the Olympic Peninsula, the headwaters of the Bogachiel and the other Quillayute tributaries are not glacier-fed. Although the annual snowpack in these headwaters is considerable, they do not experience the heavy summer-melt sediment loads of rivers to the south (Hoh, Queets, Quinault). This provides Bogachiel River fishermen with a longer fishing season in some years.

<doc id="765473" wikidata="Q1782499" url="?curid=765473" title="USS Howard (DDG-83)">
<text>USS &quot;Howard&quot; (DDG-83) is 33rd &quot;Arleigh Burke-class&quot; (Flight IIA) Aegis guided missile destroyer in the United States Navy. She is named for Medal of Honor recipient First Sergeant Jimmie E. Howard, USMC. &quot;Howard&quot; was the 19th ship of her class to be built by Bath Iron Works at Bath, Maine, and construction began on 8 December 1998. She was launched and christened on 20 November 1999. She was commissioned into the Navy on 20 October 2001.

&quot;Howard&quot; is currently a member of Destroyer Squadron 15 and Carrier Strike Group Five.

== Namesake ==
The ship is named in honor of 1st Sgt. Jimmie E. Howard, USMC (1929–1993), recipient of the Medal of Honor for his leadership of a platoon against repeated attacks by a battalion-sized Viet Cong force. After receiving severe wounds from an enemy grenade, he distributed ammunition to his men and directed air strikes on the enemy. By dawn, his beleaguered platoon still held their position. Howard had also received the Silver Star Medal for his service in the Korean War. Every time &quot;Howard&quot; set to sea from her previous homeport of San Diego, she passed within view of 1st Sgt. Howard&#x27;s grave at Fort Rosecrans National Cemetery and saluted her namesake.

==Service history==
On 16 February 2007, &quot;Howard&quot; was awarded the 2006 Battle &quot;E&quot; award.

On 28 September 2008, &quot;Howard&quot; was reported to be in pursuit of the Ukrainian ship , which on 25 September 2008 was captured by Somali pirates en route to Kenya. &quot;Faina&quot; was reported to be carrying 33 Russian-built T-72 tanks along with ammunition and spare parts. &quot;Faina&quot; was eventually released by the pirates 5 February 2009.

In 2008, &quot;Howard&quot; received the 2008 Arleigh Burke Fleet Trophy Award and provided humanitarian assistance to the Philippines.

On 26 November 2021, &quot;Howard&quot; made a port call in Wellington, New Zealand. It is the first time a U.S. Navy warship has made a port call in New Zealand since 2016.

On 10 August 2023, &quot;Howard&quot; experienced a &quot;soft-grounding&quot; outside of Bali, Indonesia. On 19 August 2023 Vice Admiral Karl Thomas, commanding Officer US 7th Fleet, removed Howard&#x27;s Commanding Officer at the time, due to a &quot;loss of confidence in his ability to command&quot; as a result of the grounding.

On 6 February 2024, the Navy announced that Commander Cameron Dennis was also relieved due to a “loss of confidence in his ability to perform his duties.” Press reports indicated his removal was due to unprofessional comments he had made.

==Coat of arms==
=== Shield ===
The shield has a background of light blue, dark blue, and gold. The upper shield consists of an oriental dragon, while the bottom contains stars configured to the Southern Cross.

The traditional Navy colors were chosen for the shield because dark blue and gold represents the sea and excellence respectively. The oriental dragon symbolizes the ship&#x27;s service in the Pacific and fighting spirit of the platoon under the leadership of Gunnery Sergeant Howard. The stars are configured to the Southern Cross and represent the First Marine Division patch worn by Gunnery Sergeant Howard.

=== Crest ===
The crest consists of a Medal of Honor neck pad in the shape of a radar array with a crossed Navy and Marine sword.

USS &quot;Howard&quot;″s combat actions and war fighting legacy are represented by the six battle stars. Gunnery Sergeant Howard was awarded a Medal of Honor for gallantry and intrepidity under fire, which is represented by the neck pad. The neck pad also highlights the modern warfare capabilities, represented with the AEGIS array. A Crossed Naval Sword and Marine Mameluke signify teamwork and cooperation, exhibited with support from USS &quot;Howard&quot;″s advanced combat systems for Marines ashore.

=== Motto ===
The motto is written on a scroll of white with blue reverse side.

The ship&#x27;s motto is &quot;Ready for Victory&quot;. The motto is a reference to the honor, courage, and commitment of USS &quot;Howard&quot;″s sailors for justifying she is ready for all operations in peace and will always be victorious in combat.

=== Seal ===
The coat of arms in full color as in the blazon, upon a white background enclosed within a dark blue oval border edged on the outside with a gold rope and bearing the inscription &quot;USS Howard&quot; at the top and &quot;DDG 83&quot; in the base all gold.

==Awards==
&quot;Howard&quot; has been awarded the Navy Battle &quot;E&quot; several times
* 1 January - 31 December 2006

<text>USS &quot;Bulkeley&quot; (DDG-84) is the 34th &quot;Arleigh Burke-class&quot; (Flight IIA) Aegis guided missile destroyer in the United States Navy. She is named for Medal of Honor recipient Vice Admiral John D. Bulkeley. USS &quot;Bulkeley&quot; was the 15th ship of this class to be built at Ingalls Shipbuilding in Pascagoula, Mississippi, and construction began on 10 May 1999. She was launched on 21 June 2000 and was christened on 24 June 2000. On 8 December 2001 she was commissioned during a pierside ceremony at the Intrepid Sea, Air and Space Museum in New York City, New York, with Commander Carlos Del Toro in command. Del Toro later became the 78th Secretary of the Navy in 2021.

==Service history==
On 13 June 2004, &quot;Bulkeley&quot; came to the aid of a vessel in distress, &quot;Al-Rashid Mum 131&quot;. Shortly after turning the vessel over to an Iranian tugboat, it sank. &quot;Bulkeley&quot; rescued three crew and recovered the body of a fourth. The tug rescued one additional crewman; the other seven were lost at sea. The incident is recounted in the book &quot;In the Shadow of Greatness&quot;.

In February 2011, &quot;Bulkeley&quot; was involved in a mission to rescue four American citizens from the yacht &quot;Quest&quot; which was attacked by Somali pirates.

On 5 March 2011, &quot;Bulkeley&quot; was involved in rescuing a Japanese oil tanker, , from Somali pirates while on duty with Combined Task Force 151 off the coast of Oman. Three of the pirates were tried and convicted in Japan, the fourth was turned over to juvenile authorities, as it was determined that he was a minor.

On 16 May 2011, &quot;Bulkeley&quot; responded to a mayday call from the Panamanian flagged very large crude carrier &quot;Artemis Glory&quot; by dispatching a Seahawk helicopter (from HSL 48) to its position. Seeing that a piratical skiff carrying four men was firing upon &quot;Artemis Glory&quot;, the Seahawk investigated the skiff. The pirates opened fire on the helicopter with small arms and were summarily neutralized by crew served weapons from the helicopter in self-defense. The helicopter then withdrew without any casualties to its own crewmembers or that of &quot;Artemis Glory&quot;.

The ship returned to Norfolk on 15 July 2011. During its deployment, she had participated in operations which had captured 75 Somali pirates and had missile strikes by its carrier strike group against the Libyan government.

On 4 August 2022, &quot;Bulkeley&quot; departed Norfolk for a homeport shift to Rota, Spain, arriving on 17 August. Her aft Phalanx CIWS was replaced with a SeaRAM CIWS.

On July 16, while operating at a position between Libya and Crete, a helicopter from USS Bulkeley spotted a vessel that appeared to be dead in the water, the destroyer asked a nearby oil tanker Seaways Sabine to intervene, after which it retrieved 31 people from the distressed craft. Bulkeley transferred medical corpsmen over to the tanker in a RHIB. The responders were able to stabilize two of the victims; the third passed away despite their intervention, including an attempt at CPR. The remaining survivors stayed aboard Seaways Sabine as the tanker got back under way. The vessel arrived at an anchorage off Alexandria on the morning of July 18.

On 1 October 2024, &quot;Bulkeley&quot; was involved in the interception of missiles employing SM-3 and SM-6 missiles during the October 2024 Iranian strikes against Israel.

==Coat of arms==
=== Shield ===
The shield has background of blue and a medium blue trim. A red chevron with anchors surround a lion in the center of the shield, with a reversed star below.

The traditional Navy colors were chosen for the shield because dark blue and gold represents the sea and excellence respectively. The inverted star at the shield base refers to the Medal of Honor Admiral Bulkeley received for his forcefulness and daringness during the defense of the Philippines. The hallmarks of USS &quot;Bulkeley&quot;, honor and high achievement, are represented in the gold wreath. From the family coat of arms, the red chevron represents the valor and sacrifice displayed by Admiral Bulkeley when he led a flotilla of PT boats and minesweepers to Utah Beach before troops stormed the beach at Normandy. The lion indicates the heritage of Normandy and represents courage and strength. Silver anchors surround the lion to display the U.S. Navy sailors&#x27; devotion and commitment while defending the countries freedom, keeping USS &quot;Bulkeley&quot; and the United States Navy &quot;Second to None.&quot;

=== Crest ===
The Philippine sun surrounds a Patrol Torpedo boat parting waves of the sea.

A PT boat from World War II is surrounded by the Philippine sun shows honor to Admiral Bulkeley&#x27;s role in the Pacific. This includes the daring rescue of General MacArthur and Philippine President Quezon from the Battle of Corregidor.

=== Motto ===
The motto is written on a scroll of gold with blue trim.

The ships motto is &quot;Freedom&#x27;s Torch&quot;. The motto is a reference to both the honorable feats of Admiral Bulkeley and the Medal of Honor he received.

=== Seal ===

<text>Mizongyi () is a style of Chinese martial art based on deception and mobility. 

As an external northern Chinese style, Mizong belongs to the &quot;Long Fist&quot; family of martial arts although in some traditions Mizongyi is considered an internal art, created by Yue Fei, and taught as a precursor system to xingyiquan. Mizongyi was created by Cheng Juxiao. Cheng learned from his maternal grandfather and mother, both of whom were also practitioners of Mizongyi.

The art began to grow popular in 1901 due to the deeds of Huo Yuanjia, a Mizongyi master. Huo Yuanjia&#x27;s father, Huo Endi is a 6th-generation successor of Mizongyi.

There are many sub-branches of Mizongyi. One such sub-branch is Mizong Luohan (), which combines Mizongyi with Luohanquan. Through Luohanquan, its lineage can be traced back to the Shaolin temple during the time of the Tang dynasty.

==Description==
Mizong Luohan is an external style, with distinct internal influences. It draws on many aspects of the external Northern Shaolin long-fist style, and the internal styles tai chi and baguazhang, which are often taught alongside it in modern times. It is characterized by deceptive hand movements, intricate footwork, varied kicks, and high leaps. The style changes very quickly when executed. The emphasis on flexibility in Northern Shaolin kung fu styles is the guiding principle of Mizong, and this is evident in the versatility of its attacks and the extent to which it integrates core concepts of multiple internal styles. 

Mizong Luohan&#x27;s system was presided over by Grandmaster Ye Yu Ting in the twentieth century until his death in 1962, at the age of 70. A number of his students such as Masters Chi-Hung Marr, Raymond K. Wong, and Johnny Lee emigrated to North America in the 1960s and have continued to teach this system in various locations around the United States of America, from Los Angeles, Dallas, Texas, Coppell, Texas, to Hawaii and Canada. 

Mizong has also been continued to be taught as a foundation art to xingyiquan within the Yue Jia Ba Shao/Geng Jishan tradition in London, England. Within this tradition, Mizong was primarily taught to children, as from a learning perspective the technical and internal aspects of the art are less sophisticated (i.e., more external) than in xingyiquan.

<doc id="765500" wikidata="Q1605879" url="?curid=765500" title="USS McCampbell">
<text>USS &quot;McCampbell&quot; (DDG-85) is the 35th &quot;Arleigh Burke-class&quot; (Flight IIA) Aegis guided missile destroyer in the United States Navy. She is named in honor of Naval Aviator Captain David S. McCampbell, a Medal of Honor and Navy Cross recipient who was the Navy&#x27;s leading ace in World War II. USS &quot;McCampbell&quot; was the 20th ship of this class to be built by Bath Iron Works at Bath, Maine, and construction began on 16 July 1999. She was launched and christened on 2 July 2000. On 17 August 2002, the commissioning ceremony was held at Pier 30 in San Francisco, California.

==Service history==
She arrived at Yokosuka Naval Base in Yokosuka, Japan as part of the Navy&#x27;s Seventh Fleet in July 2007, and was then permanently forward deployed there.

On 23 June 2009, &quot;McCampbell&quot; replaced in shadowing the North Korean ship &quot;Kang Nam 1&quot; toward Burma in enforcement of a new United Nations resolution, United Nations Security Council Resolution 1874.

In March 2011, &quot;McCampbell&quot; was the first US Navy vessel on station off northeastern Honshu, Japan to assist with relief efforts after the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and deliver food, supplies, and other material aid directly to survivors. Later, after the arrival of the aircraft carrier , the ship continued relief efforts as an element in Carrier Strike Group Seven, using the carrier as a supply distribution hub through early April.

On 13 June 2011, &quot;McCampbell&quot; intercepted the North Korean-flagged merchant vessel , en route to Myanmar, on 26 May, south of Shanghai. &quot;McCampbell&quot; requested permission to board the vessel, which was suspected of carrying missile technology, but was refused. After several days MV &quot;Light&quot; turned around and returned to North Korea, tracked by surveillance aircraft and satellites.

&quot;McCampbell&quot; rescued five Philippine fishermen on or about 24 October 2012. During a routine night mission, the embarked helicopter crew of &quot;McCampbell&quot; discovered five men signaling for help aboard a mostly-sunk fishing vessel. The helicopter crew deployed flotation rafts while &quot;McCampbell&quot; dispatched two boats, along with a translator, to assist in the rescue. &quot;McCampbell&quot; was operating with and Carrier Strike Group Five at that time.

&quot;McCampbell&quot; maintains on board an active VBSS team to conduct anti piracy, anti-smuggling, and anti-terrorist operations. The ship was an active participant in &quot;IMDEX&quot;, and the VBSS team was a centerpiece in the multilateral training effort held in conjunction with the exposition.

On 24 January 2019, &quot;McCampbell&quot; sailed through the Taiwan Strait on orders from the USS Pacific Fleet. &quot;McCampbell&quot; and replenishment oiler &quot;conducted a routine Taiwan Strait Transit&quot; that was &quot;in accordance with international law.&quot;

In July 2020 the ship left Yokosuka for Portland, Oregon to begin a midlife update at Vigor Shipyards. While the update has a set cost of US$133.4 million, with contract options that could rise up to as much as US$155.6 million.

On 5 February 2024, the U.S. Navy announced that USS McCampbell (DDG 85) will forward deploy to Yokosuka, Japan. McCampbell will replace USS Antietam (CG 54), which will depart Yokosuka, Japan, and move to Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, as part of a scheduled rotation of forces in the Pacific.

On 8 February 2024, the USS McCampbell, in collaboration with the Missile Defense Agency (MDA), successfully conducted Flight Test Other-23 (FTX-23), also known as Stellar Sisyphus, off the coast of the Pacific Missile Range Facility, Kauai, Hawaii. This two-part developmental test involved evaluating sensor tracking and communications link capabilities. 

On 2 March 2024, USS McCampbell returned to Yokosuka, Japan after a four year long modernization period in the United States rejoining her sister ships as part of Destroyer Squadron Fifteen.

==Coat of arms==
=== Shield ===
&quot;The shield has background of blue with a diagonal light blue band. Roman numerals for the number fifteen are located above the band while the Navy Cross is below.&quot;The traditional Navy colors were chosen for the shield because dark blue and gold represents the sea and excellence respectively. The light blue band refers to the Pacific theater, where Captain McCampbell&#x27;s served as commander of Air Group 15. In the band, there are thirty-four stars representing the number of enemy aircraft Captain McCampbell destroyed in air to air combat. This distinguished him as the leading naval ace in World War II. The Roman numeral “XV” signifies the “Fabled Fifteen” which embarked on . The Navy Cross with a Silver Star center symbolize Captain McCampbell&#x27;s bravery during combat in the Philippines.

=== Crest ===
&quot;The crest consists of a winged shield under a reversed star surrounded by tridents.&quot;The reversed star refers to Captain McCampbell&#x27;s Medal of Honor which was awarded for heroism in both the first and second battles of the Philippine Sea. The sea lion represents the Republic of the Philippines government seal. Two tridents, symbolizing sea prowess, surround the star and signifying the AEGIS system&#x27;s firepower and strike capability. Representing the United States coat of arms is the winged shield to symbolize naval aviator wings which was Captain McCampbell&#x27;s area of specialty.

=== Motto ===
&quot;The motto is written on a scroll of blue that has a gold reverse side.&quot;The ships motto is &quot;Relentless in Battle&quot;. The motto is a reference to both the honorable feats of Captain McCampbell and the Medal of Honor he received.

=== Seal ===
&quot;The coat of arms in full color as in the blazon, upon a white background enclosed within a dark blue oval border edged on the outside with a gold rope and bearing the inscription &quot;USS McCampbell&quot; at the top and &quot;DDG 85&quot; in the base all gold.&quot;

<doc id="765509" wikidata="Q54581" url="?curid=765509" title="Pancho Segura">
<text>Francisco Olegario Segura Cano (June 20, 1921 – November 18, 2017), better known as Pancho &quot;Segoo&quot; Segura, was a leading tennis player of the 1940s and 1950s, both as an amateur and as a professional. He was born in Guayaquil, Ecuador, but moved to the United States in 1940. Throughout his amateur career he was listed by the USTA as a &quot;foreign&quot; player resident in the U.S. As a professional player, he was referred to as the &quot;Ecuadorian champ who now lives in New York City&quot;. After acquiring U.S. citizenship in 1991 at the age of seventy, Segura was a citizen of both countries.

Segura is the only player to have won the Cleveland/Forest Hills US Pro and International Pro titles on three different surfaces (which he did consecutively from 1950 to 1952). He won the inaugural professional Tournament of Champions at Sydney in 1957. He won the L. A. Masters tournament in 1958. In 1950, 1951, and 1952, as a professional, he was the U.S. No. 1 professional player in the USPLTA rankings and was also ranked U.S. number one professional for 1950 and 1952 in the PTPA rankings.

Segura&#x27;s most potent shot was considered to be his double-handed forehand. His less-potent backhand was single-handed. He played collegiate tennis for the Miami Hurricanes at the University of Miami in Coral Gables, Florida.

==Early life==
Segura was born on a bus traveling from Quevedo to Guayaquil, Ecuador, the first of seven children of Domingo Segura Paredes, Spanish in origin, and Fransisca Cano, an Indian from Quevedo. He almost died at his premature birth, then suffered from hernias and malaria. No more than 5 ft 6 in (1.68 m) tall, he had badly bowed legs from the rickets that he also had as a child. He learned playing tennis by hitting against a backboard at the Guayaquil Tennis Club where his father was the caretaker and he himself worked as a ball boy and servant. He decided to play with a double-handed forehand because it allowed him to hit with more power. Segura left school when he was 12 years old to earn money for his family who lived in poverty. As he developed his game in his early teens he began to get asked as a hitting partner by the club players.

In 1938 he represented Guayaquil in their annual tennis match against Quito and after winning his three matched was invited by Galo Plaza Lasso to participate in the Bolivarian Games. Segura won the gold medal in the singles event after a win in the final against Jorge Combariza. On return to Guayaquil he was welcomed with a ticker-tape parade.

By the time he was 17, Segura had won a number of titles in Latin America. In 1939 he planned to go to France to further develop his game but the outbreak of World War II prevented this. In the spring of 1940 he was visited by American player Elwood Cooke, finalist at the 1939 Wimbledon Championships, on behalf of Wilson Sporting Goods. With their support Segura travelled to the United States in June 1940 and arrived in New York on July 29.

==Amateur career==

===1940===
Directly following his arrival in the United States Segura entered a grass court tournament at the Meadow Club in Southampton, Long Island. It was the first time he played on grass and he lost in both the singles and doubles events. At the Eastern Clay Court Championships in East Orange, New Jersey he took the first set against Jack Kramer but lost the match. In early September he entered the U.S. National Championships for the first time and was drawn against fourth-seeded Frank Parker. Segura lost in three straight sets despite leading 5–1 in the third set. In October he won his first grass court match against the Irish Davis Cup player George Lyttleton Rogers at the Hispanic Tennis Club.

===1941===
Segura won the Brooklyn clay court championships in May beating Ladislav Hecht in the final. Hecht commented: &quot;He&#x27;ll be a great player in another year, just as soon as he makes circuit with older and smarter players. His baffling shots and unorthodox style will puzzle many a foe.&quot; He won the Hispano invitation event in August beating Frank Bowden in the final. Segura lost in the second round of the U.S. Championships to Bryan Grant in five sets. &quot;Segura had the usually sedate Forest Hills fans in the aisles with his attack, similar to that of Jack Bromwich, the double-fisted Australian. He was a strong crowd favorite but Grant drew a ringing round of applause for his comeback in the final set after Segura seemingly had him beaten down.&quot; Segura won the Dade County championships in December beating Gardnar Mulloy in the final. He &quot;captured a four-set battle which had several hundred wild-eyed spectators almost standing on their heads.&quot; Segura then lost in the final of the Sugar Bowl to Ted Schroeder. &quot;Segura, who amazed the crowd with his ability to retrieve seemingly impossible shots, won the first two sets before Schroeder, seeded No. 1, overcame wildness and began passing the Ecuadorean consistently&quot;.

===1942===
Segura won the Florida west coast title in February beating George Lyttleton Rogers in the final. Segura beat Bill Talbert to win the Cincinnati event in June. Segura successfully defended his title at Brooklyn in July, beating Hecht in the final in four sets. At the New Jersey state tournament the following week, Segura beat Vic Seixas and Budge Patty before a win in three straight sets over Hecht in the final without losing a single game. The following week Segura beat Schroeder to win the final of the Eastern Clay Court Championships. &quot;Segura&#x27;s two-handed drives down the sidelines kept Schroeder on the defensive throughout and afforded the Californian few opportunities to move in close. While Segura&#x27;s emphasis was on speed, he threw in an occasional dropshot to add to Schroeder&#x27;s discomfiture&quot;.
Segura beat Mulloy to win the Longwood Bowl in August 1942. At the U.S. Championships, Segura beat Talbert before losing to Parker in the semi-finals. &quot;And, regardless as to any plan Segura may have had in mind before the match started, he was at Parker&#x27;s mercy at every stage of the duel&quot;. Segura beat Earl Bartlett to win the Sugar Bowl in December. Segura was offered a tennis scholarship by Gardnar Mulloy, tennis coach at the University of Miami and he entered in the fall of 1942. He won the National Collegiate Singles Championship for three straight years: in 1943, 1944, and 1945.

===1943===

Segura won the Pan American championships in Mexico City in January beating Talbert in the final in five sets. He won the Miami tournament over Campbell Gillespie in February. Segura won New Jersey event in July over Robert Odman. Segura beat Joe Hunt in the final of the Eastern Grass Court Championships in August. &quot;Segura, now a student In Florida, was on the top of his game while Hunt weakened rapidly following the first set. After being trounced soundly in the second, the sailor changed to spiked shoes in hopes of turning the tide but gained little benefit&quot;. The following week Segura beat Sidney Wood to win Southampton invitation. Despite having won several tournaments in the weeks before the U.S. Championships, Segura lost in the semi-finals of the event to Jack Kramer. Segura won the Pan American championships in Mexico City over Talbert in October (a familiar opponent in the final of this tournament).

===1944===

In June, Segura won US clay court event and the following week won at Cincinnati (both over Talbert). Pancho won the Western states tournament in July over Talbert in five gruelling sets in which both player had suffered leg injuries and had to take time out for treatment. Segura won Southampton invitation with a four set victory over McNeill in August. Segura lost to Talbert in five sets in the semi-finals of the U.S. Championships. &quot;What made Talbert&#x27;s victory so surprising was the fact that it was achieved in five strength-sapping sets. The Indianapolis lad was rated as a &#x27;sprinter&#x27; by most experts, and figured to lack the vitality to win over the route. But Bill more than balanced in strategy what he spotted the energetic Ecuadorian in stamina.&quot; Segura won the Pan American championships at Mexico City in October (again beating Talbert in the final).

===1945===

Segura won the Roney Plaza event at Miami in May over Charles Harris. At the U.S. Clay Court Championships in July Talbert beat Segura in a five-set final. At the U.S. Championships, Segura beat Bob Falkenburg before losing again to Talbert in the semi-finals. &quot;Charging the net with effectiveness as he and Talbert squared off in the famed center court, Pancho forged into a 4-to-l lead as Talbert netted shot after shot. But then Talbert rammed back through Segura&#x27;s service three straight times, lost his own once and put the set away by ruining Segura&#x27;s delivery with cross court drop shots in the twelfth game. From there on it was no contest. Pancho tried but he just didn&#x27;t have it&quot;.

===1946===

Segura won the US Indoors event over defending champion McNeill in March. &quot;The South American parlayed superb passing shot and an uncanny defensive game into the triumph that took the title out of the United States for the first time since Jean Borotra carted it to France in 1931&quot;. In April he won the Miami tournament over Talbert. Segura won the title at Queens over Dinny Pails in June. &quot;Segura walked off the court a very tired man. But, although near exhaustion, he summoned just sufficient reserve strength in the final set to retrieve enough shots to win&quot;. Segura lost in the third round of Wimbledon to Tom Brown. Segura lost in the last 16 of the French championships in July (held after Wimbledon this year) to eventual winner Marcel Bernard. &quot;In the most spectacular match of the tournament to date Roland Garros stadium echoed with Segura&#x27;s cry of &#x27;Oh Pancho&#x27; with which he berated his own mistakes.&quot; Segura lost to Mulloy in the quarter-finals of the U.S. Championships in four sets.

===1947===

Segura won La Jolla Beach and Tennis Club tournament over Tom Falkenburg in February. Segura lost to Drobny in the first round of Wimbledon. Kramer wrote that Segura lost &quot;without distinction (to Tom Brown and Jaroslav Drobný) the two times he played Wimbledon, and really, nobody took Segoo seriously. He didn&#x27;t speak English well, he had a freak shot, and on the grass while scooting around in his long white pants with his bowlegs, he looked like a little butterball. A dirty butterball: his pants were always grass-stained&quot;. Segura won Southampton invitation over Seymour Greenberg in August. Segura lost to Parker in the quarter-finals of the U.S. Championships. Segura won the title at São Paulo in November beating Parker in the final and beat Parker again later that month in the Rio de Janeiro final.

==Professional career==

===1948===

Long before Open Tennis, Segura turned professional in 1947 and was an immediate crowd-pleaser with his winning smile, infectiously humorous manner, and unorthodox but deadly game. According to Bobby Riggs, Jack Harris (the promoter of the forthcoming Riggs-Kramer tour for 1948) attempted to sign Ted Schroeder to play the preliminary matches of the tour. Ultimately he failed and instead signed Segura to play the latest Australian amateur champion, Dinny Pails. Instead of a percentage of the gross receipts, as Riggs and Kramer were contracted for, Segura and Pails were each paid $300 a week. Segura lost the tour 44–26. At the US Pro championships at Forest Hills in June 1948, Segura lost in the quarter-finals against Frank Kovacs.&quot;Segura held command over Kovacs through the first two sets when the Californian was never able to break his opponent&#x27;s service. But in the third game of the third set, Kovacs cracked through to assume a 2-1 lead and he grew progressively stronger from that point.&quot;

===1949===
Segura lost a tough match to Kramer in five sets in the semi-finals at the Wembley Pro championships in June. &quot;When Kramer made a lot of bad shots at the beginning of the fifth set and Segura reached 3-1, it appeared as if the champion was facing a defeat. Yet it was the gallant little Segura who faltered and allowed the champion to crawl home.&quot; Kramer also beat Segura in the semi-finals of the tournament at Scarborough in July.

===1950===

Segura won the 1949–50 tour against Frank Parker 63–12 (they played the preliminary match each night before Kramer and Pancho Gonzales took to the court). Segura won a four-man tournament at Paris in January. In the semi-final of the 1950 U.S. Pro Championship held in Cleveland on clay, Segura won a come-from-behind five set match over Kramer, and went on to beat Kovacs in the final. Segura was rated the U.S. number one professional for 1950 by the U.S. Professional Lawn Tennis Association as well as by the PTPA.

===1951===

In the 1950–1951 world professional tour in which Segura played the headline match against Kramer he was beaten 64 matches to 28, a noticeably better performance, however, than Gonzales&#x27;s record of 29 victories and 94 defeats against Kramer the year before. Segura won the Canadian Professional Championships title in June beating Kovacs in the final, although he lost the Cleveland International Pro or U.S. Pro final to Kovacs in a close five-set match. Segura&#x27;s won the 1951 U.S. Pro Championship, played on soggy grass courts at the West Side Tennis Club in Forest Hills, over Pancho Gonzales in the concluding round robin match. It was their first encounter on grass and Allison Danzig of the New Yourk Times commented: &quot;Segura extracted the sting from Gonzales&#x27;s potent service and net attack with virulence and accuracy of his calculated counter-measures until the big Californian was all but helpless under the relentless pressure on the wet turf in the final set.&quot; He was ranked the number one U.S. professional ranking by the USPLTA for 1951. He was ranked the No. 2 U.S. professional by the PTPA, behind Kovacs. Segura won a tournament at Berlin in September, beating Gonzales in the concluding round robin. Segura lost to Gonzales in four sets in the final at Wembley in September. Segura won a four-man tournament at the Bygdøhus Arena in Oslo in October beating Carl Earn in the semi-finals and Gonzales in the final.

===1952===

Segura won the U. S. Pro Clay Court title at St. Augustine in March beating Riggs in the final. Segura won the U. S. Pro or International Professional Championships (billed title) at Cleveland on cement in June over Budge and Gonzales. Segura won the Canadian Pro in June at Quebec City on clay beating Budge in the final. Segura won a three-day Roland Garros round-robin event in Paris in late June after victories against Budge, Gonzales and Kramer. Segura won a four-man event in Stockholm in October beating Riggs in the first match and Budge in the final.
For the calendar year of 1952, Segura was ranked as the U.S. No. 1 professional player by the U.S. Professional Lawn Tennis Association for the third straight year, with Gonzales at no. 2. The PTPA ranked Segura as U.S. number one professional ahead of Gonzales in second place.

===1953===

In 1953, Segura was reduced to playing the preliminary match on the World Series tour, where he beat the Australian Ken McGregor 72 matches to 24. In July, Segura won a round robin in Caracas beating Frank Sedgman, McGregor and Kramer. On August 1, 1953, Segura won the Slazenger Professional Championship at Scarborough, England on grass (an event dubbed by the media &quot;the pro Wimbledon&quot;). He won come-from-behind five set matches over McGregor in the semi-final and Sedgman in the final, the latter at 8–6 in the fifth set. Segura won a four-man tournament in Munich in September beating Sedgman in the final. Segura beat Sedgman in the Lyon final (another 4-man event) in November to bring the year to a close. In June, the Players Committee of Jack March&#x27;s Cleveland U. S. Pro or &quot;World&#x27;s Professional Championship&quot; tournament ranked Segura second.

===1954===

Segura participated in a World Series tour with Gonzales, Sedgman and Budge (who was later replaced by Riggs and Earn). Gonzales won the series with Segura finishing in second place. Segura was runner-up to Gonzales in the 1954 U.S. Pro final at the Los Angeles Tennis Club, losing a two-hour five-set final. Segura won the Pacific Coast Pro at Beverly Hills in August over Gonzales in a three-set final. At the inaugural Australian Pro, held at the Subiaco Oval in Perth in November, Segura beat Gonzales before losing in the final to Sedgman. Segura was ranked second in 1954 by International Professional Tennis Association.

===1955===

Segura faced Gonzales in the final at Cleveland in April 1955. This event was played under Van Alen Simplified Scoring System (VASSS) with 21-point sets and the server was only allowed one serve instead of two. In the final, Segura lost to Gonzales in five VASSS sets. Segura toured Europe with Gonzales, McGregor and Fred Perry in the summer of 1955. Segura was ranked second in 1955 by International Professional Tennis Association.

===1956===

In 1955–56, Gonzales and Tony Trabert played the feature match of the World Series tour. Segura beat Rex Hartwig 56–22 (Segura and Hartwig played the preliminary match each evening, usually in a single set format). Segura beat Trabert in the final of the Hamilton Pro in Bermuda in April. Segura beat Trabert in the semi-finals at the VASSS event in April in Cleveland before losing to Gonzales in the final. &quot;Although Gonzales said he would not &#x27;participate in another championship if the ping-pong scoring system is used&#x27;, Segura said he was for it, claiming it made the matches more even&quot;. The event returned to traditional scoring in 1957.

===1957===

In February 1957, Segura won the inaugural Ampol Tournament of Champions at White City, Sydney, the richest tournament of the year. The TOC was the most prestigious series of pro tournaments in the late 1950s, and the Australian version was funded by Ampol, the Australian oil company. Segura defeated Hartwig in five sets in the first round, came from behind to beat Gonzales at 13–11 in the fifth set in the semi-final, and won in three straight sets over Sedgman in the final. Segura regarded this as his greatest tournament win. Kramer designated the Sydney tournament as one of the four major professional tournaments, together with Kooyong, Forest Hills, and L.A. Masters. Segura beat Pails in a North American tour that was the undercard tour for the World Series (the main contest featured Gonzales against Ken Rosewall). Segura beat Rosewall in the semi-finals at Cleveland in April, but lost to Gonzales in the final. Segura beat Gonzales in the semi-finals at Wembley in September, but lost in the final to Rosewall in five sets.

===1958===

Segura lost a North American tour to Trabert by a narrow margin (this tour was a World Series undercard tour. The main contest featured Gonzales against Lew Hoad). In May, Segura won the Alaska Pro championships beating Trabert in the final. In July, Segura won the L.A. Masters Pro Championship in Los Angeles. Segura defeated all six opponents in a round robin format, Gonzales, Hoad, Rosewall, Trabert, Sedgman, and Hartwig. Kramer designated the L.A. Masters as one of the four major professional tournaments, together with Forest Hills, Kooyong, and Sydney.

===1959===

At the Wembley Pro in September, part of the Ampol world series of tournaments, Segura beat Hoad and Trabert before losing to Mal Anderson in a two and a half hour five-set final. &quot;Anderson&#x27;s singles final with Segura was a memorable one, and not until the last few games of the deciding set did he really get on top of an opponent sixteen years older than himself&quot;. On October 25, 1959, Segura won the Ramat Gan tournament at Tel Aviv in Israel, beating Anderson, Ashley Cooper and Mervyn Rose. Segura defeated Hoad (the winner of the Ampol series) three times that year in the series, at Melbourne for 3rd place, at Wembley in the 2nd round, and in the final event at Kooyong in the round robin.

===1960===

Segura participated in a 4-man World series with Gonzales (world champion since 1954), Rosewall and Alex Olmedo (Trabert also played matches early on). Gonzales won the series. At Wembley Segura beat Hoad in the quarter-finals. &quot;Segura twinkled and dazzled, scuttling about the court at a speed that made it impossible for anyone to believe that he was 39 years old&quot;. In the semi-finals, Segura overcame Sedgman. &quot;Towards the end of his three-hour semifinal with Sedgman he showed signs of tiring. He missed chances that might have given him an earlier victory, yet he still was able to make the final effort that gave him a break in the ninth game of the fifth set and the match&quot;. Segura lost to Rosewall in the final.

===1961===

Segura won four-man tournaments in São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro in May while touring South America with Cooper, Olmedo and Butch Buchholz. Segura won the San Remo event in July over Hoad and Andrés Gimeno and then won the Viareggio event over Hoad and Trabert. At Noordwijk in early August, Segura beat Gonzales, Trabert and Gimeno in the final to win the title.

===1962===

Segura lost to Buchholz in the Cleveland final in May 1962 when he was nearly 41 years old. On August 5, 1962, Segura won the Dutch Pro Championships at The Hague, Holland, on red clay, beating Ayala, Hoad, and Olmedo. At Cave de Tirreni in August, Segura beat Ayala, Olmedo and Anderson to win the title. On August 15, 1962, Segura won the pro tournament at Cannes, France, beating Ayala, Olmedo, and Hoad in the best-of-five set final in three straight sets.

===1963–1970===

Segura won the California State Pro Championships at Monterrey in August 1965 (beating Leonzie Collas in the final). He won the Fresno tournament in October 1965, beating Nick Carter in the final. At Binghamton Pro in July 1966, 45 year old Segura beat Rosewall in the semi-finals before losing in the final to Rod Laver. At the Fresno tournament in October 1966, Segura retained his title (beating Barry MacKay in the final). Segura also won the USPLTA title at Milwaukee in November 1966 beating Mike Davies in the final. As the Open era arrived, Segura&#x27;s career was coming to an end. He entered the 1968 US Open and after a bye in the first round and a straight-sets win against Ian Crookenden lost in the third round to Laver. His final Grand Slam singles appearance was at 1970 US Open aged 49, where he beat Atet Wijono (a man 30 years younger than him), before losing to Tito Vazquez in round two.

==Playing style==
He had extremely fast footwork and a devastating two-handed forehand that his frequent adversary and tennis promoter Jack Kramer once called the greatest single shot ever produced in tennis.

Ellsworth Vines gives an analysis of Segura&#x27;s unusual playing style in his book &quot;Tennis: Myth and Method&quot; (1978): Two-handed forehand is most outstanding stroke in game&#x27;s history; unbeatable unless opponent could avoid it. Improved as a professional by taking advantage of volleying ability he rarely used as an amateur. Backhand also better later in career. Returns serve brilliantly, particularly off right side where quicksilver moves give him unusual positioning talent. Serve only average for his class of player but well placed, as is overhead. Very deft volleyer, particularly off forehand. Lob and dropshot unsurpassed. Superb passing shots, change of pace, and absolute consistency make him greatest &quot;little man&quot; to ever play the game.

Kramer and Hoad regarded Segura&#x27;s two-handed forehand as the greatest single tennis stroke that they had ever faced.
According to Kramer,

Kramer goes on to say, however, that with Segura:

==Career assessment==

In his 1979 autobiography Kramer included Segura in his list of the 21 greatest players of all time.

Kramer went on to say, &quot;... and while his amateur record is of no consequence, he beat everyone in the pros but Gonzales and me. We beat him with good second serves&quot;. A year earlier, another World No. 1 player, Ellsworth Vines, the man that Kramer called the greatest player of all time at the height of his game, had published a lesser-known book called &quot;Tennis: Myth and Method&quot;, co-written with Gene Vier. Vines devotes the first part of the book to individual chapters about the ten greatest tennis players from Don Budge through the date of the book&#x27;s publication. He considered Segura to be the fifth best of these ten great players, behind, in order, Budge, Kramer, Gonzales, and Rod Laver. Segura, however, ranked above Bobby Riggs, Ken Rosewall, Lew Hoad, Frank Sedgman, and Tony Trabert.

Segura, says Kramer, probably played &quot;more matches against top players than anyone in history. Besides my couple hundred, he must have played Gonzales a hundred and fifty, and Budge, Sedgman, Riggs, Hoad and Rosewall all around fifty apiece. I beat him about 80 percent of the time, and Gonzales also held an edge over him. Pails beat him 41–31 on the Kramer-Riggs tour, but that was when Segoo was still learning how to play fast surfaces. With everybody else, he had the edge: Sedgman, Rosewall, Hoad, Trabert, McGregor&quot;.

==Retirement==
In 1962, on the recommendation of good friend Mike Franks, Segura became the teaching professional at the Beverly Hills Tennis Club, replacing Carl Earn. Most of Segura&#x27;s students were movie stars such as Dinah Shore, Doris Day, Julie Andrews, Richard Conte, Shelley Winters, Charlton Heston, Barbra Streisand, Dina Merrill, Kirk Douglas, Robert Evans, Lauren Bacall, Gene Hackman, Carl Reiner, Barbara Marx, George C. Scott, Janet Leigh, and Ava Gardner, as well as Dean Paul Martin.

Segura also found time to coach Jimmy Connors, Tracy Austin, Charlie Pasarell, and Stan Smith as well as his son Spencer Segura, who played at UCLA, and is a lawyer/investor. In 1971, he left Beverly Hills to become the head teaching professional at the La Costa Resort in Carlsbad, California, where he eventually retired. He is widely credited with having mentored and structured the playing game of Jimmy Connors, starting at age 16, in 1968, when his mother, Gloria, brought him to Pancho in California for lessons. Dr. Abraham Verghese describes taking a tennis lesson from Segura during this period in his book &quot;The Tennis Partner&quot;.

Before the famous &quot;Battle of the Sexes&quot; tennis match between Billie Jean King and Bobby Riggs in 1973, Segura openly supported Riggs. When King won the match, Segura declared disgustedly that Riggs was only the third-best senior player, behind himself and Gardnar Mulloy. He challenged King to another match, which King refused.

In the 1966 episode of &quot;I Dream of Jeannie&quot; titled &quot;Always on Sunday&quot;, Segura made a cameo appearance as himself.

Segura retired from playing Singles after the 1970 US Open at Forest Hills at age 49. He was inducted into the International Tennis Hall of Fame in Newport, Rhode Island, in 1984. Segura became an American citizen in 1991.

==Death==
Segura died on November 18, 2017, at the age of 96 at his home in Carlsbad, California, from complications related to Parkinson&#x27;s disease. A memorial service for the celebration of his life was held at the Beverly Hills Tennis Club on December 17, 2017, with 200 in attendance. Spencer Segura was master of ceremonies, with 10 featured speakers including Burt Bacharach, Jimmy Connors, Mike Franks, Cliff Richey, Charlie Pasarell, Tracy Austin, and David Kramer.

<text>The Quillayute River (also spelled Quileute River) is a river situated on the Olympic Peninsula in Washington. It empties to the Pacific Ocean at La Push, Washington. The Quillayute River is formed by the confluence of the Bogachiel River, Calawah River and the Sol Duc River near the town of Forks, WA. The Dickey River joins the Quillayute from the north, just above the river&#x27;s mouth at the Pacific Ocean.

Although the Quillayute is one of the main rivers on the Olympic Peninsula and has a large drainage area, due to an unusual naming arrangement it is officially very short, being only about long. At the confluence of the Sol Duc and Bogachiel rivers the use of the Quillayute name ends, although these source rivers continue far into the interior of the Olympic Mountains.

The name &quot;Quillayute&quot; comes from the Quileute people. In the Quileute language the name is /kʷoʔlíːyot&#x27;/, which perhaps derived from /kʷolíː/ (&quot;wolves&quot;), and was the name of a village at La Push.

The Quillayute River is the current, traditional, and ancestral center of the territory of the Quileute Native Tribe, which before European settlement occupied the entire drainage basin (plus that of the Hoh River). Presently the natives live at the town of La Push on their small treaty reservation which adjoins the south shore of the river at the mouth.

The final at the mouth of the Quillayute pass through the narrow coastal strip of the Olympic National Park. Park roads lead to the Mora Campground and Rialto Beach recreation area on the north side of the Quillayute. There are camping and picnicking facilities, public parking, and trailhead access to the coastal wilderness strip north of the river.

<text>Sagarmāthā Zone (, &quot;Sagarmāthā Anchal&quot;) was one of the fourteen zones of Nepal until the restructuring of zones into provinces. The headquarters of Sagarmatha is Rajbiraj. &quot;Sagarmāthā&quot; is a Nepali word which as per some sources, is derived from सगर (&quot;sagar&quot;, sky) and माथा (&quot;māthā&quot;, head).

It includes mountain districts of the Himalayas (including the world&#x27;s highest peak Mount Everest) in the north, hill districts in the center, and valley districts of the Terai in the south. It is bordered by China to the north, India to the south, the Kosi Zone to the east and the Janakpur Zone to the west.

==Administrative subdivisions==
Sagarmāthā was divided into six districts; since 2015 the four northern districts have been redesignated as part of Province No. 1, while the two southernmost districts have been resigned as part of Province No. 2.

The main city of the Sagarmāthā Zone was Rajbiraj which was also the headquarters. Other towns of the Sagarmāthā hill area were Katari, Okhaldhunga, Diktel, Salleri and Namche Bazaar; while Kathauna, Lahan, Fatepur, Rajbiraj and Siraha are in the outer Terai. Triyuga is an emerging city in the zone.

== Name origin ==
Sagarmāthā Zone took its name from &quot;Sagarmāthā&quot; which is the Nepalese name for Mount Everest (Sagarmāthā), which is located in the very north of the zone within the Sagarmatha National Park (1,148 km2) in the Solu Khumbu district of Nepal.

Sagarmāthā means &quot;the Head in the Great Blue Sky&quot; derived from सगर (sagar) meaning &quot;sky&quot; and माथा (māthā) meaning &quot;head&quot; in the Nepali Language.

<text>The Apartment () is a 1996 French drama film written and directed by Gilles Mimouni, and starring Romane Bohringer, Vincent Cassel, Jean-Philippe Écoffey and Monica Bellucci.

==Plot==
Max (Vincent Cassel) is a former bohemian and an amateur writer who gets a job in New York and leaves his girlfriend Lisa (Monica Bellucci), with whom he was madly in love, in mysterious circumstances. After two years, he returns home to Paris, and decides to settle down and gets engaged to Muriel (Sandrine Kiberlain). By chance, he catches a glimpse of his lost love, Lisa, in a café, but fails to make contact with her before she storms out. Determined to meet her, Max secretly cancels his business trip abroad to pursue his lost love. Through a series of ruses and perseverance, he enters Lisa&#x27;s apartment. Hearing that somebody else has arrived, he hides in her wardrobe.

First, he thinks it is Lisa, as the girl who came to the apartment resembles Lisa from behind. After several misunderstandings, they finally get acquainted. The girl introduces herself as Lisa. The same night, they make love, and their relationship starts to develop. The girl&#x27;s real name is Alice (Romane Bohringer). During the film, flashbacks are intertwined with the narrative to provide a background for Max, Lisa, and especially for Alice, shedding light on the situation.

The flashbacks show that Alice and Lisa were best friends, living in apartments on the same floor of two facing buildings, and that Alice became obsessed with Max, Lisa&#x27;s then-boyfriend, from a distance. She restyled herself to look like Lisa while secretly engineering a breakup between them. Lisa is a stage actress and leaves abruptly for a two-month tour, giving Alice a letter to deliver to Max asking him to wait for her; Alice never sends the letter. Max, believing Lisa left because she didn&#x27;t love him, accepts a job in New York and leaves. Upon her return, Lisa is heartbroken that Max has left her and leaves on a cruise (a gift from Alice) to ease her mind, where she meets a rich, married older man named Daniel.

Lisa is being pursued by Daniel, who might have murdered his wife to get closer to her. For this reason, she avoids her flat and lets Alice use it. To complicate matters further, Alice is dating Max&#x27;s best friend, Lucien, who is also Max&#x27;s confidante.

In a sub-plot, Alice is seen to be acting in Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Midsummer Night&#x27;s Dream&quot;, drawing comparisons between the four lovers in the film and those in the play; it is arguable that the whole film is a rendition of the play.

The film begins and ends in &quot;reality&quot; where Max and Muriel lead a futile, vacuous but bourgeois life in high finance (and the implication being that Muriel is the boss&#x27;s daughter, thus imitating Egeus&#x27; involvement in Hermia&#x27;s marriage to Demetrius in Midsummer Night&#x27;s Dream), but almost all the action takes place in a dreamlike trance where the lovers don&#x27;t really know whom they love. Lucien is always faithful to Alice, and pursues her, but both Alice and Lisa (who, as their names imply, are reflections of each other) initially both love Max, and Max, although madly in love with Lisa, turns to Alice after reading her diary, just before reality dawns and he accepts his fate with Muriel. 
Lisa returns to her apartment and is confronted by Daniel, who drops a lighter on the floor (covered in gasoline) causing the apartment to explode and blowing Lucien through the window of a café across the street.
Alice leaves her life behind and flies to Rome, bidding Max one last farewell glance as he embraces Muriel at the airport.

* Vincent Cassel as Max
* Romane Bohringer as Alice

== Reception ==
In his review for &quot;BBC&quot;, Almar Haflidason rated the film 5 out of 5 stars, describing it as &quot;a gorgeously wicked film that tests visceral foreplay to a near unbearable but satisfying climax.&quot;

In 1998, the film won a BAFTA Award for Best Film Not in the English Language and the first British Independent Film Award for the Best Film in a Foreign Language.

The film was also a modest hit in France with 55,565 admissions its opening weekend and 152,714 admissions total. Although the film was never released theatrically in the United States, it was released on DVD on August 22, 2006. The film was remade in the United States as &quot;Wicker Park&quot; in 2004.

<text>Bogachiel Peak is a peak in the Olympic Mountains of Washington, U.S.. It is located in Olympic National Park, and is a high point on the High Divide separating the Hoh River and Sol Duc River valleys, and forming the southern rim of Seven Lakes Basin. The peak is situated at the headwaters of the Bogachiel River. The name &quot;Bogachiel&quot; is a corruption of the Quileute words &quot;bo qwa tcheel el&quot;, or &quot;/boqʷač&#x27;íʔl/&quot;, from &quot;/bó:q&#x27;ʷa/&quot;, &quot;muddy&quot;, and &quot;/číʔlowa/&quot;, &quot;water&quot;, meaning &quot;gets riley [turbid] after a rain&quot;, &quot;muddy waters&quot;, or, less likely, &quot;big river&quot;.

==Climate==

Based on the Köppen climate classification, Bogachiel Peak is located in the marine west coast climate zone of western North America. Most weather fronts originate in the Pacific Ocean, and travel northeast toward the Olympic Mountains. As fronts approach, they are forced upward by the peaks of the Olympic Range, causing them to drop their moisture in the form of rain or snowfall (Orographic lift). As a result, the Olympics experience high precipitation, especially during the winter months. During winter months, weather is usually cloudy, but, due to high pressure systems over the Pacific Ocean that intensify during summer months, there is often little or no cloud cover during the summer. Precipitation runoff from the mountain drains into Bogachiel River, Sol Duc River, and the Hoh River.

===2010s===
On 1 August 2010 the ship collided with a civilian vessel off Oceanside, California. The hull of the civilian boat was cracked, but no injuries were reported. &quot;Shoup&quot; was not damaged.

&quot;Shoup&quot; provided assistance to South Korean naval forces after their recapture of the chemical tanker &quot;Samho Jewelry&quot; on 21 January 2011 in the Arabian Sea. The tanker&#x27;s captain had been shot by pirates holding the vessel and a helicopter from &quot;Shoup&quot; was used to evacuate him in order for him to receive medical treatment for his injuries.

During her 2013 deployment to the Persian Gulf and Red Sea, &quot;Shoup&quot; participated in numerous multinational exercises while providing theater security and support of ongoing maritime stability in the region. &quot;Shoup&quot; returned to homeport on 18 November 2013 following several extensions during what was the longest deployment for a US Navy destroyer since World War II at 313 days.

=== Shield ===
&quot;The shield has background of blue with a red chevron center. Featured in the chevron are artillery shells and a reversed gold start with a lion center. A large combined anchor with a trident center cover the shield.&quot;The traditional Navy colors were chosen for the shield because dark blue and gold represents the sea and excellence respectively. The combined trident and anchor, symbols of sea prowess, represent our naval history and the evolvement of modern warfare systems. The tridents three tines denote the warfare areas: air, surface, and undersea warfare. The red chevron with artillery shells represents valor and sacrifice, suggesting the troops led by Colonel Shoup crossing the reefs of Betio and bombardment of enemy fire. The red lion exemplifies courage and strength symbolizing Colonel Shoup&#x27;s British Distinguished Service Order award for the battle at Betio. The reversed gold star refers to Colonel Shoup&#x27;s Medal of Honor awarded for his heroism as commander of the Second Marine Division at Betio and the disputed island of Tarawa Atoll.

=== Crest ===
&quot;The crest consists of the Marine Corps emblem surrounded by laurels.&quot;The Marine Corps emblem reflects Commandant Shoup&#x27;s World War II war service and career as Commandant of the Marine Corps highlighting leadership and guidance. The surrounding laurels characterize achievement and honor.

=== Motto ===
&quot;The motto is written on a scroll of gold that has a red reverse side.&quot;The ships motto is &quot;Victoria per Perseverantiam Venit&quot; or &quot;Through Perseverance Comes Victory&quot;. The motto is a reference to both the honorable feats of Colonel Shoup and the Medal of Honor he received.

=== Seal ===
&quot;The coat of arms in full color as in the blazon, upon a white background enclosed within a dark blue oval border edged on the outside with a gold rope and bearing the inscription &quot;USS Shoup&quot; at the top and &quot;DDG 86&quot; in the base all gold.&quot;

<doc id="765526" wikidata="Q764294" url="?curid=765526" title="Centre-du-Québec">
<text>Centre-du-Québec (, &quot;Central Quebec&quot;) is a region of Quebec, Canada. The main centres are Drummondville, Victoriaville, and Bécancour. It has a land area of and a 2016 census population of 242,399 inhabitants.

==Description==

The Centre-du-Québec region was established as an independent administrative region of Quebec on July 30, 1997 (in effect August 20 upon publication in the Gazette officielle du Québec); prior to this date, it formed the southern portion of the Mauricie–Bois-Francs region (the northern part of which is now known simply as Mauricie).

Centre-du-Québec is not located in the geographic centre of Quebec, though it is approximately located in the centre of the southern portion of the province. Some consider the name Bois-Francs to be synonymous with the Centre-du-Québec region; others see it as being synonymous with Arthabaska Regional County Municipality, with its main city Victoriaville earning the title &quot;Capitale des Bois-Francs&quot; (capital of the Bois-Francs).

The Centre-du-Québec is a primarily agricultural region known as the breadbasket of Quebec; major products include livestock and poultry, dairy products (the region produces more dairy products than all of Canada’s maritime provinces combined), as well as food crops such as cereals, vegetables, and fruits such as apples and cranberries. The city of Plessisville, located in the region, is known for its maple syrup production and is known as the Maple Capital of the World (&quot;Capitale Mondiale de l’Érable&quot;). Forestry is also a major industry; the name &quot;Bois-Francs&quot; refers to the French term for hardwood, referring to the high density of hardwood forests in the area. Other major industries of the area include transportation, recycling, woodworking and cabinetmaking.

The Centre-du-Québec region derives great benefit from its central location; major centres such as Montreal and Quebec City are within an hour and a half&#x27;s drive, while secondary centres such as Sherbrooke and Trois-Rivières are close at hand. The region borders Mauricie, right across the St. Lawrence River, to the north, Montérégie to the west, Chaudière-Appalaches to the east and Estrie to the south. The Laviolette Bridge, which connects the region to Trois-Rivières, is located in Bécancour and is the only structure in Quebec located in between Montreal and Quebec City that connects both the north and south shores of the St. Lawrence.

<text>Gerald James Holton (born May 23, 1922) is a German-born American physicist, historian of science, and educator, whose professional interests also include philosophy of science and the fostering of careers of young men and women. He is Mallinckrodt Professor of Physics and professor of the history of science, emeritus, at Harvard University. His contributions range from physical science and its history to their professional and public understanding, from studies on gender problems and ethics in science careers to those on the role of immigrants. These have been acknowledged by an unusually wide spectrum of appointments and honors, from physics to initiatives in education and other national, societal issues, to contributions for which he was selected, as the first scientist, to give the tenth annual Jefferson Lecture that the National Endowment for the Humanities describes as, “the highest honor the federal government confers for distinguished achievement in the humanities”.

==Early life and education==
Holton was born on May 23, 1922, in Berlin, Germany, into a Jewish family. His parents were Austrians: Emanuel, an attorney-at-law specializing in international law, and Regina, a physiotherapist. Forced by the rise of fascism in Germany, and one physical attack on the young family, they returned early to Vienna, Austria. Growing up in Vienna, Holton received his education through most of the Humanistisches Gymnasium. Family life was typically that of professionals enamored of Germanic Kultur; his parents had met first in a poetry club.

In 1938, the annexation of Austria by Germany made life for Jews there dangerous, as was widely understood after the nationwide Pogrom of November 8–9. Yet, soon thereafter he and his younger brother, Edgar, were granted a place on the British Quakers&#x27; Kindertransport, to flee to England. There, Holton studied at the School of Technology, City of Oxford, receiving a Certificate of Electrical Engineering in June 1940. At that point, he was able to leave for America with his rejoined family, just days before having to report for incarceration for the duration, as was required for all male adult German refugees, by Prime Minister Churchill&#x27;s directive.

Shortly after arriving in America, Wesleyan University in Middletown, Connecticut, offered Holton a place as a refugee from Europe (as many American colleges and universities similarly did). At Wesleyan, studying under his mentor, Professor Walter G. Cady, he received a B.A. in 1941 and an M.A. in 1942. From the outbreak of the war he found himself officially among the “Enemy Aliens”, as marked by President Franklin D. Roosevelt&#x27;s directive for all holders of German passports. Nonetheless, he was asked to join the Harvard-based war-time research unit, the Electric-Acoustic Laboratory, OSRD, and also was teaching assistant on the staff to train naval officers in the use and repair of radar equipment.

Upon the end of World War II, he enrolled as a graduate student at Harvard. In 1947 he received his Ph.D. for research on the structure of matter at high pressure, as a student under Professor Percy Williams Bridgman, who in 1946 was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics for his research in the field he effectively founded. Upon Holton&#x27;s graduation he was asked to remain at Harvard as instructor in the Physics Department. His academic professional life had begun, and his association with Harvard has lasted for over 70 years. So has also his marriage to Nina, a sculptor. They have two sons, Thomas and Stephan.

==Career==

=== Physics at Harvard ===
Holton went through various faculty ranks at Harvard, starting in 1947, and was tenured in 1952 at age 30. For 30 years, starting from his thesis, he ran a high-pressure physics laboratory, specializing in the structure of liquids, and having the usual flow-through of research students and publications.

Among the courses he taught in the Physics Department was an unusual one – an introduction to physics seen as part of a cultural tapestry that included astronomy, chemistry and technology as well as history and philosophy of science. It resulted in his publication of his first book, &quot;Introduction to Concepts and Theories of Physical Science&quot; (Addison Wesley: 1952, and later editions and adaptations), which has been called a seminal work of its kind. Its approach and structure was later incorporated in the National Curriculum Project requested by the National Science Foundation, called Harvard Project Physics. He headed it with colleagues F. James Rutherford and Fletcher Watson. It was also adapted in a number of foreign countries.

In these, as in Holton&#x27;s other educational opportunities, he has been guided by the advice of Alfred North Whitehead, that “In the conditions of modern life, the rule is absolute, the race which does not value trained intelligence is doomed”. As well, he is based on his firm belief that in education a multi-cultural approach is necessary, both to help immunize against the seduction of narrowness, and to obey the moral imperative to foster a liberal education. For the same reason, Holton wrote extensively against what he considered to be the destructive excesses of Postmodernists in their writings on science.

Holton&#x27;s service at Harvard included chairmanship of the Concentration on Physics and Chemistry, of the initial General Education Course, membership on the Faculty Council, and on the advisory board of the Radcliffe Institute for Independent Study. From 1976 to 1982 he was concurrently visiting professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, as a founding faculty member of the Program on Science, Technology and Society. At various times he was visiting professor (or similar title) at the Institute for Advanced Study at Princeton; New York University; Leningrad University; Imperial College, London; University of Rome; CNRS-Paris; and invited lecturer in China and Japan.

=== Daedalus ===
In 1956, having been elected as Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, Holton was asked to be the Association&#x27;s editor. For a couple of years before, the academy had been publishing an experimental, annual, in-house volume called &quot;Daedalus&quot;, distributed to its members. He accepted the request and edited the journal 1958–1961 before turning the position over to Stephen Graubard. Holton used this opportunity to transform &quot;Daedalus&quot; into a publicly available, quarterly journal. As he put it in his first issue (Winter 1958), his vision for the journal aimed &quot;to give the intellectual community a strong voice of its own&quot;, and to &quot;lift each of us above our individual cell in the labyrinth of learning&quot;, so as &quot;to see the entire structure&quot;. The journal served as adult education and several issues looked ahead at problems on the horizon that would have an effect on public policy, such as those on &quot;Arms Control and Disarmament&quot; (fall 1960), on &quot;The Woman in America&quot; (spring 1964), on African Americans (fall and winter 1965, with a foreword by President Lyndon B. Johnson), and on &quot;Ethical Aspects of Experimentation with Human Subjects&quot; (spring 1969).

=== Einstein Archive and &quot;Thematic Origins of Scientific Thought&quot; ===
In 1955, another unexpected event occurred, one which caused Holton to make an important turn in his studies. When Albert Einstein died on April 18, 1955, Professor Philipp Frank, Holton&#x27;s colleague in the Physics Department and proponent of the American continuation of the Vienna Circle&#x27;s philosophy of science, suggested that a memorial occasion should be arranged, and that as one part Holton should present the history of Einstein&#x27;s achievements. But Holton found that apart from Einstein&#x27;s own essays there was then still little solid scholarship on this topic.

With Professor Frank&#x27;s recommendation, Holton went to the Princeton Institute for Advanced Study, where Einstein&#x27;s enormous and largely unstudied correspondence and manuscripts were kept, still under the supervision of Einstein&#x27;s long-time secretary, Helen Dukas. This excursion resulted in Holton, on and off for two years, helping to make the haphazard collection into an archive usable by scholars (now the Albert Einstein Archives), while he, reading through the collection, was learning from it how to see its historical value. Over the years that followed, Holton&#x27;s researches on Einstein occupied a large part of his publications. Eventually, this initiative helped launch an academic industry analogous to the ones concerned with Newton and Darwin. But as a scholar in this field, Tetsu Hiroshige, wrote, someone had to take a &quot;first step&quot;.

While studying the rich contents of Einstein&#x27;s collection, Holton came to realize a fact that led to a new and fruitful part of his researches on this and other scientists. As shown in Einstein&#x27;s work, Einstein brilliantly but silently drew again and again from a set of fundamental guiding concepts that were neither verifiable nor falsifiable. These concepts included, in his theory construction, the primacy of the search for unity; invariance; formal rather than materialistic explanation; logical parsimony; symmetry; the continuum, causality, and completeness. In addition, their contraries held by other scientists, such as acausality and uncertainty, were strongly opposed.

Holton called all such motivating concepts Themata (sing. Thema). He found these crucial, style-defining and differing thematic sets to be also at the core of research of many other scientists, from antiquity to Johannes Kepler to Niels Bohr. This insight was later used as well by other historians of science, and by scholars in other fields. His findings led Holton to the publication of his book, &quot;Thematic Origins of Scientific Thought&quot; (Harvard University Press, 1973, revised edition 1988).

Different sets of themata were and are being held by individual scientists, as their subjects advanced over time. In that respect, this concept differs profoundly from the idea of a series of incommensurable, non-progressive, so-called “scientific paradigms” as described by Thomas Kuhn in his &quot;The Structure of Scientific Revolutions&quot;. Each of those paradigms, in turn, was said to pervade the whole social group of scientists at a given time and in the same way—as is disproved even by the famous mutual oppositions between contemporaries such as Einstein, Schroedinger, and Heisenberg.

=== Sociology of inclusivity ===
Occasionally, Holton felt he could contribute to a public issue&#x27;s deeper understanding and amelioration. One of these was the issue that among working scientists in most fields, women were underrepresented and undervalued. Therefore, with his colleague Dr. Gerhard Sonnert, a sociologist of science, he initiated a long-term research effort, called Project Access. It yielded two books, &quot;Who Succeeds in Science? The Gender Dimension&quot; (Rutgers University Press, 1995), and &quot;Gender Differences in Science Careers: The Project Access Study&quot; (Rutgers University Press, 1995, with a foreword by Robert K. Merton).

A second occasion for engaging in a public issue study arose when it became of general interest to explore what immigrants can bring to the betterment of society in the U.S.A. Dr. Sonnert and Holton committed to a several-years study, called Second Wave, to determine, by questionnaires and face-to-face interviews, what was achieved by immigrants who had come as children to the US as refugees from Nazi persecution compared to American-borns. The results were published by them in a book, &quot;What Happened to the Children Who Fled Nazi Persecution&quot; (Palgrave Macmillan, 2006, with a preface by Bernard Bailyn; German translation, &quot;Was geschah mit den Kindern&quot;, Lit Verlag, Muenster, 2008). Thinking that the findings in that book had applications for immigrants to the U.S. in our time as well, Dr. Sonnert and Holton published another book, &quot;Helping Young Refugees and Immigrants Succeed&quot; (Palgrave Macmillan, 2010).

A selection of Holton&#x27;s books and essays can be downloaded on DASH (Digital Access to Scholarship at Harvard). Among the essays are those in which Holton called for the wider adoption of what he called Jeffersonian Research—one with the double purpose of serving both basic investigation and the needs of society, as Thomas Jefferson had done repeatedly.

Holton also engaged in editorial work apart from &quot;Daedalus.&quot; This included serving as General Editor for a series of books on history of science by the Arno Press, and another, called Classics of Science, by Dover Publications. He also initiated and served for some years on the Editorial Advisory Board and Editorial Committee of &quot;The Collected Papers of Albert Einstein&quot; (Princeton University Press, 1987 ff.). In 1972 he founded the &quot;Newsletters of the Program on the Public Conceptions of Science&quot;, known since 1976 as the journal &quot;Science, Technology, &amp; Human Values&quot;.

== Professional memberships, fellowships, and other honors ==
While Holton&#x27;s professional memberships are collected below, one such service required a great deal of time and energy: the Presidency of the History of Science Society (1983–1984), after two years as vice president. This Society, founded by George Sarton, was highly distinguished in its essential mission; but Holton found on election that a great deal of work, managerially and financially, had to be done.

<doc id="765529" wikidata="Q1782848" url="?curid=765529" title="USS Mason (DDG-87)">
<text>USS &quot;Mason&quot; (DDG-87) is the 37th &quot;Arleigh Burke-class&quot; (Flight IIA) Aegis guided missile destroyer in the United States Navy. She is named in honor of the Black crewmembers who served on board during the period of racial segregation in the United States Armed Forces.

&quot;Mason&quot; was the 21st ship of this class to be built at Bath Iron Works in Bath, Maine, and construction began on 19 January 2000. She was launched and christened on 23 June 2001. On 12 April 2003, a commissioning ceremony was held at Port Canaveral, Florida. She is currently homeported at the Naval Station Mayport in Mayport, Florida.

==Etymology==
This is the third U.S. Navy warship with the name USS &quot;Mason&quot;. The first , in service from 1920 to 1941, was named for John Young Mason, well known for his service as the Secretary of the Navy for two American Presidents. The second was named for Ensign Newton Henry Mason, a Naval Aviator who was posthumously awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross. This ship is named for the crew of the second , as this was the first ship in the US Navy with the distinction of having a predominantly black crew.

==Service history==
===2004–2015===


USS &quot;Mason&quot; conducted her maiden deployment with the Carrier Strike Group in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom/Operation Enduring Freedom in late 2004. &quot;Mason&quot; returned home after six months on 18 April 2005.

On 3 October 2006, &quot;Mason&quot; departed Naval Station Norfolk for a seven-month deployment to the Persian Gulf in support of the Global War on Terrorism. She participated in Exercise Neon Falcon. &quot;Mason&quot; returned home in May 2007.

&quot;Mason&quot; deployed with the aircraft carrier on 12 September 2008 for a scheduled deployment. &quot;Mason&quot; made scheduled port calls in 2008-2009 to ports in Mykonos, Nice, Aqaba, Istanbul, Dubai, Bahrain, and Jebel Ali. &quot;Mason&quot; conducted operations in the Persian Gulf in support of operation enduring freedom.

On 12 March 2011, she sailed through the Suez Canal en route to the Mediterranean, to support possible humanitarian or military action in response to the Libyan Civil War. In April 2011, a boarding team from the ship successfully liberated five Yemeni hostages from 11 Somali pirates who had taken over the Yemeni-flagged ship . The pirates had seriously injured two other fishermen in their attack, left the wounded ashore, and then taken &quot;Nasri&quot; to sea as a pirate mothership. Assault weapons, ammunition, rocket propelled grenades, and launchers were destroyed by the boarding team.

On 22 July 2013, she deployed to the 5th Fleet and 6th Fleet area of responsibility as part of the &quot;Harry S. Truman&quot; Carrier Strike Group. &quot;Mason&quot; returned to her homeport on 18 April 2014.

On 7 November 2015, &quot;Mason&quot;, acting as the flagship for Destroyer Squadron 26, completed the first East Coast Passing Exercise with the People&#x27;s Republic of China&#x27;s People&#x27;s Liberation Army-Navy ships.

===2016 attacks off the coast of Yemen===
On 3 October 2016, following a guided missile attack by Houthi rebels on the United Arab Emirates-operated , &quot;Mason&quot; was deployed off the coast of war-torn Yemen, along with destroyers and , and , an amphibious transport dock being used as a forward landing base and laser test bed. According to an unnamed U.S. Department of Defense official, the purpose for sending the ships was &quot;to ensure that shipping continues unimpeded in the strait and the vicinity.&quot;

On 9 October 2016, &quot;Mason&quot;, operating near the Bab-el-Mandeb strait, was targeted by two missiles fired from Houthi-controlled territory. Both missiles fell short and crashed into the water. The Houthi insurgency denied launching the attack on the warship. The United States Naval Institute reported that &quot;Mason&quot; fired two SM-2 Standard missiles and one RIM-162 ESSM missile to intercept the two missiles, and deployed her Nulka missile decoy. One of two U.S. defense officials cited anonymously added that it was not clear whether the incoming missiles had been shot down or crashed into the water on their own. This marked the first recorded instance of ship-based anti-air missiles being fired from vertical launching cells in combat in response to an actual inbound missile threat.

On 12 October 2016 &quot;Mason&quot; was again targeted by missiles fired from Yemeni territory, while it was operating in the Bab el-Mandeb strait. &quot;Mason&quot; was not hit by the two missiles, which were fired from near the southern Yemen city of Al Hudaydah. While the Navy was not certain whether the first incoming missile was intercepted or instead just fell into the sea, officials said &quot;Mason&quot; successfully intercepted the second missile at a distance of about , marking the first time in history a warship destroyed an inbound anti-ship missile with a SAM in actual self-defense. On 13 October 2016, the U.S. attacked three radar sites in Houthi-held territory which had been involved in the earlier missile attacks, with cruise missiles launched from &quot;Nitze&quot;. The Pentagon assessed that all three sites were destroyed.

On 15 October 2016, &quot;Mason&quot; was targeted in a third attack by Houthi rebels based in Yemen, by five anti-ship cruise missiles while operating in the Red Sea north of the Bab el-Mandeb strait. &quot;Mason&quot; fired a radar decoy, an infrared decoy, and several SM-2 Standard missiles in response, either neutralizing or intercepting four of the five incoming missiles. The Navy reported the fifth incoming missile as neutralized by a radar decoy launched from &quot;Nitze&quot;, after &quot;Mason&quot; alerted her to the threat.

===2017–2022===

On 23 May 2017, &quot;Mason&quot; was awarded the 2016 Battenberg Cup, signifying she was the best all-around ship or submarine in the United States Navy&#x27;s Atlantic Fleet based on crew achievements. &quot;Mason&quot; was only the fifth destroyer in the prior 111 years to receive the award.

On 22 August 2022, &quot;Mason&quot; completed a homeport shift to Naval Station Mayport, in Jacksonville, Florida.

===2023 Israel-Hamas war===
On 14 October 2023, US Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin directed nuclear-powered aircraft carrier and her carrier strike group, which includes the cruiser , along with &quot;Mason&quot; and sister-destroyers and , to the eastern Mediterranean in response to Israel&#x27;s war with Hamas. This is the second carrier strike group to be sent to the region in response to the conflict, following aircraft carrier and her group, which had been dispatched six days earlier.

On 26 November 2023, &quot;Mason&quot; responded to a distress call from the commercial tanker &quot;Central Park&quot;, which was seized by gunmen in the Gulf of Aden. Five gunmen tried to escape on a fast boat, but were chased and eventually surrendered to a search and seizure team dispatched by &quot;Mason&quot;. Two ballistic missiles were fired from Houthi-controlled parts of Yemen towards the general direction of &quot;Mason&quot; and &quot;Central Park&quot;, but they landed about 10 nautical miles away from the ships, with no reported injuries or damage.

On 6 December 2023, &quot;Mason&quot; shot down an air drone headed toward &quot;Mason&quot; from Yemen, which officials attributed to Houthi rebels, as it was in the southern Red Sea.

After the Norwegian-flagged oil and chemical tanker &quot;Strinda&quot;, traveling from Malaysia and carrying a cargo of palm oil, was struck by an anti-ship cruise missile whilst passing through the Bab-el-Mandeb strait on 11 December 2023, &quot;Mason&quot; responded to the ship&#x27;s distress call and rendered assistance.

On 13 December 2023, &quot;Mason&quot; shot down in self-defense a drone launched from a Houthi-controlled area of Yemen, that was heading directly towards the Mason. &quot;Mason&quot; was at the time responding to the distress call issued by the tanker Ardmore &quot;Encounter&quot;. Houthi forces had unsuccessfully attempted to board the tanker on skiffs, exchanged fire with the ship’s armed guards, and then fired two missiles in the Ardmore Encounter’s direction, prompting the distress call. The tanker was carrying jet fuel from India to the Netherlands and Sweden.

===United States–Houthi conflict (2023–present)===

On 12 January 2024, &quot;Philippine Sea&quot;, &quot;Mason&quot; and &quot;Gravely&quot; fired Tomahawk cruise missiles at Iranian-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen. Aircraft from Carrier Air Wing Three, embarked on the carrier &quot;Dwight D. Eisenhower&quot; also participated in the strikes.

== Coat of arms ==
The shield has background of white with a double chevron across the center. Above are opposing lions and below is a gold trident. The traditional U.S. Navy colors were chosen for the shield because dark blue and gold represents the sea and excellence respectively. The colors red, white and blue represent the United States. The double chevron is to honor DD 191 and DE 529, the former ships named USS Mason. The facing lions, adapted from the Mason family coat of arms, denote the Atlantic and Pacific campaigns of World War II. The trident, symbol of sea prowess, represents &quot;Mason’s&quot; modern warfare capabilities which include the AEGIS weapon system (including Aegis Ballistic Missile Defense System from theater ballistic missiles) and Cooperative Engagement Capability.

The crest consists of a helm, crossing swords behind and a combined anchor and cross surrounded by a wreath. The helm is symbolic to strong defense with power projection. The anchor refers to the namesake of DD 191, John Y. Mason, who was the Secretary of the Navy under President John Tyler and James K. Polk. The cross is in reference to Newton Henry Mason&#x27;s Distinguished Flying Cross award. The wreath represents all the awards, honors and achievements of the past ships with the namesake Mason and crews who served them.

The motto is written on a scroll of white with a red trim. The ship&#x27;s motto is &quot;Proudly We Serve&quot;. The motto is in honor of the high achievement of the African American crew of DE-529 who made history with their selfless bravery in defense of the U.S. in World War II, and marks their contribution to the eventual desegregation of the U.S. Navy.

The coat of arms in full color as in the blazon, upon a white background enclosed within a dark blue oval border edged on the outside with a gold rope and bearing the inscription &quot;USS Mason&quot; at the top and &quot;DDG 87&quot; in the base all gold.

<doc id="765531" wikidata="Q2352697" url="?curid=765531" title="M-27 (Michigan highway)">
<text>M-27 is a north–south state trunkline highway in the extreme north of the Lower Peninsula of the US state of Michigan. The trunkline runs between Interstate 75 (I-75) just north of Indian River and Cheboygan, where it meets US Highway 23 (US 23) near Lake Huron. It remains as a relic of the old US 27 which disappeared north of Grayling after being supplanted by I-75, which lies close to old US 27 between Grayling and Indian River.

==Route description==

I-75 takes a more direct route between Indian River and Mackinaw City. M-27 follows old US 27 through Topinabee and Cheboygan. With US 23 it is a scenic, if indirect, alternative to I-75 on its approach to the Mackinac Bridge. M-27 runs along the western shore of Mullett Lake and forms the main street of Topinabee. The highway intersects M-33 near the confluence of the Cheboygan and Black rivers. North of the M-33 junction, M-27 runs parallel to the Cheboygan River on the west river bank into downtown Cheboygan.

M-27 has the local road name of Main Street in Cheboygan and Straits Highway outside of the city. State Street (US 23) and Main Street (M-27) form the two major streets in the Cheboygan street grid. The main downtown businesses are located along Main Street south to the city limits. The highway has not been listed on the National Highway System, a network of roads important to the country&#x27;s defense, economy and mobility.

==History==
===Previous alignment===
This is the second time a highway was designated M-27 in Michigan. The original M-27 was located in The Thumb, running from the Mount Clemens area east and north through New Baltimore to Port Huron. There it ran through Carsonville and Minden City to Harbor Beach and along Lake Huron to Port Austin. This version of M-27 was designated by July 1, 1919, and would last until 1926. All of the original M-27 was given to other contemporary highways including M-29 (Mount Clemens to Port Huron), M-51 (Port Huron to M-83), and M-29 (Harbor Beach to Port Austin).

===Current alignment===

In the late 1950s, US 27 was the main highway connection between Grayling, Gaylord, and Cheboygan. After the construction of the Mackinac Bridge, US 27 was extended north to St. Ignace. The construction of I-75 in the early 1960s rendered the northern portion of US 27 obsolete. Between Grayling and Indian River, I-75 replaced US 27 as the main highway in the area. North of Indian River, I-75 was built along a different routing. Where US 27 ran northwest through Topinabee to Cheboygan and then concurrently along US 23 to Mackinaw City, I-75 was built due north of Indian River before turning northwest parallel and several miles inland from Lake Huron, bypassing Cheboygan completely. M-27 was designated in the latter half of 1961 on the current alignment replacing US 27 which was truncated back to Grayling. Today, the stretch from Grayling to about Wolverine is known as Old 27, and from there to Indian River, it is called Straits Highway.

<doc id="765532" wikidata="Q3037167" url="?curid=765532" title="Dorothy Dix">
<text>Elizabeth Meriwether Gilmer (November 18, 1861 – December 16, 1951), widely known by the pen name Dorothy Dix, was an American journalist and columnist. As the forerunner of today&#x27;s popular advice columnists, Dix was America&#x27;s highest paid and most widely read female journalist at the time of her death. Her advice on marriage was syndicated in newspapers around the world. With an estimated audience of 60 million readers, she became a popular and recognized figure on her travels abroad. In addition to her journalistic work, she joined in the campaign for women&#x27;s suffrage and the ratification of the Nineteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution.

==Life==
Elizabeth Meriwether was born to William Meriwether and Maria (Winston) Meriwether on the Woodstock plantation located on the borders of Montgomery County, Tennessee and Todd County, Kentucky. She attended Clarksville Female Academy and later completed one semester at the Hollins Institute. In 1888, she married her stepmother&#x27;s brother, George Gilmer.

Shortly after her marriage to George, his mental health began to deteriorate, forcing Dix to provide financial support for both of them. He would later be institutionalized and eventually died in an asylum in 1931. In the aftermath of these events, Dix moved to Louisiana and took up writing. Her journalism career began after her neighbor Eliza Nicholson, the owner of the New Orleans newspaper &quot;Daily Picayune,&quot; saw her work and offered her a job as a reporter.

==Career==
At the beginning of her career, before writing advice columns, Dix wrote obituaries, recipes and theater reviews. As was customary for many female journalists at the time, who believed that their work had the potential to cause embarrassment or poor social standing, she chose to write under a pseudonym. She first used the pen name Dorothy Dix in 1896 for her column, &quot;Sunday Salad,&quot; in the &quot;Picayune&quot;; Dorothy, because she liked the name, and Dix in honor of an old family slave named Mr. Dick who had saved the Meriwether family silver during the Civil War. Within months the column was renamed to &quot;Dorothy Dix Talks&quot; and under that name was to become the world&#x27;s longest-running newspaper feature.

The column&#x27;s widespread popularity began in 1923 when Dix signed with the Philadelphia-based &quot;Public Ledger Syndicate&quot;. At various times the column was published in 273 papers. At its peak in 1940, Dix was receiving 100,000 letters a year and her estimated reading audience was about 60 million in countries including United States, UK, Australia, New Zealand, South America, China, and Canada. One of her most famous single columns was &quot;Dictates for a Happy Life&quot;, a ten-point plan for happiness, which had to be frequently reprinted due to popular demand. In addition to her newspaper columns, Dix was the author of books such as &quot;How to Win and Hold a Husband&quot; and &quot;Every-Day Help for Every-Day People&quot;.

In addition to her advice columns, Dix was known for her reporting of murder trials. She earned her national reputation under the term of &quot;sob sister&quot; during the 15 years she worked for William Randolph Hearst&#x27;s &quot;New York Evening Journal&quot; as its leading crime reporter, concentrating mostly on murders and trials. Dix covered every high-profile case in New York until 1917 when she returned full time to writing her advice column, &quot;Dorothy Dix Talks.&quot; She returned only once to the courtroom for the infamous 1926 Hall-Mills trial after the &quot;New York Evening Post&quot; offered a staggering $1,000 a week. In this case, a socially prominent clergyman, Edward Hall, was found deceased with the body of Eleanor Mills, a singer in the choir and wife of the church janitor. She was shot three times and her throat slit. Frances Noel Stevens Hall, the wife of Edward Hall, stood trial for murder, but a jury found her not guilty.

== Feminism and suffrage ==
Dix wrote columns and other material that brought attention to women, and she also appeared at suffrage events. In a column called &quot;The Ordinary Woman,&quot; she urged readers to regard domestic work highly. &quot;Women who are toiling over cooking-stoves, slaving at sewing-machines, pinching and economizing to educate and cultivate their children... the Ordinary Woman is the real heroine of life,&quot; she wrote. Dix also encouraged women to work outside of the home in her writings and speeches.

Participating in the suffrage movement, Dix spoke at the 34th annual National American Suffrage Convention, which was marked by the inaugural International Woman Suffrage Conference, at the First Presbyterian Church in Washington, D.C., Feb. 12–18, 1902. Her address, titled &quot;The Woman With the Broom,&quot; filled four columns in the &quot;Woman&#x27;s Journal.&quot; In her speech, she made a plea &quot;for the domestic woman — the woman who is the mainstay of the world, who is back of every great enterprise and who makes possible the achievements of men — the woman behind the broom, who is the hardest-worked and worst-paid laborer on the face of the earth ...&quot; In New Orleans in 1903, she appeared on a platform with Susan B. Anthony to campaign for woman suffrage. Years later, Dix again spoke to attendees at the National American Suffrage Convention held April 14, 1910, in Washington, D.C. She delivered her address, &quot;The Real Reason Why Women Cannot Vote,&quot; by imitating the dialect of the African-American character featured in her &quot;Mirandy&quot; novels.

Along with her pro-suffrage convention speeches and event appearances, Dix penned columns and essays supporting women&#x27;s right to vote. She wrote a circular for the National American Woman Suffrage Association (NAWSA) outlining the social, political and economic reasons why women should be granted the right to vote. One reason was that &quot;every question of politics affects the home, and particularly affects the woman in the home.&quot; Originally published in 1908 in the &quot;San Francisco Examiner&quot;, the four-page piece addressed taxation, the differences between men and women, household budgets, morals, education, and other arguments in favor of women&#x27;s suffrage. The circulars, along with novel items such as buttons, stationery, playing cards and other materials that promoted the suffrage movement, were included in a mail-order &quot;Catalog of Suffrage Literature and Supplies&quot; produced by the NAWSA Literature Committee.

In addition to the circulars, Dix wrote three pamphlets on the subject of suffrage between 1912 and 1914. She also served as an editor for the July 1904 edition of &quot;Progress&quot;, a publication of the NAWSA.

==Legacy==
Her reputed practice of framing questions herself to allow her to publish prepared answers gave rise to the Australian term &quot;Dorothy Dixer&quot;, an expression widely used in Australia to refer to a question from a member of Parliament to a minister that enables the minister to make an announcement in the form of a reply. In Australian rhyming slang, a &quot;Dorothy&quot; or &quot;Dorothy Dix&quot; refers to a hit for six in cricket.

In Andy Griffith&#x27;s 1955 version of the song &quot;Make Yourself Comfortable&quot;, Griffith tells the story of a man writing a letter to Dix, wanting her advice on the aggressive woman he&#x27;s on a date with.

A Providence, Rhode Island, newspaper reporter said at a trial, &quot;For years no great American murder-trial looked complete until Dorothy Dix took her place at the press table. Dorothy Dix has arrived. The trial can now proceed.&quot;.

In the episode &quot;Here Comes the Bride&quot; of the sitcom &quot;The Honeymooners&quot;, when Alice Kramden (played by Audrey Meadows), forces her husband, Ralph Kramden (played by Jackie Gleason), to sleep on chairs in the kitchen to allow her sister Agnes (played by Treva Frazee) to share her bedroom because she was upset over marital trouble caused by Ralph, Kramden exclaims &quot;OK, Dorothy Dix, fixer of marriage problems, fix my sleeping problem!&quot;

<doc id="765534" wikidata="Q1781110" url="?curid=765534" title="USS Preble (DDG-88)">
<text>USS &quot;Preble&quot; (DDG-88) is the 38th &quot;Arleigh Burke-class&quot; (Flight IIA) Aegis guided missile destroyer in the United States Navy. She is the sixth U.S. Navy ship named in honor of Commodore Edward Preble, who served in the American Revolutionary War and was one of the early leaders of the Navy.

She was the 17th ship of this class to be built at Ingalls Shipbuilding in Pascagoula, Mississippi, and construction began on 22 June 2000. She was launched on 1 June 2001 and was christened on 9 June 2001. On 9 November 2002, she was commissioned during a ceremony at the Commonwealth Pier/World Trade Center in Boston, Massachusetts. At her commissioning ceremony USS &quot;Preble&quot; was docked bow to bow with , the command of her namesake. The ceremony included a symbolic welcoming aboard of the spirit of Commodore Preble signaled by the ringing of chimes. Among the speakers at the commissioning were U.S. Senator Edward Kennedy, U.S. Representative Stephen Lynch, then Chief of Naval Operations Admiral Vernon E. Clark USN (Ret.) and journalist and sailor Walter Cronkite.

==Service history==
===2000s===
&quot;Preble&quot; departed San Diego in June 2004 for her maiden deployment with the Expeditionary Strike Group. &quot;Preble&quot; returned home after six months on 17 December 2004. On 20 January 2007, &quot;Preble&quot; departed for a routine deployment with the carrier strike group. &quot;Preble&quot; supported Operation Enduring Freedom and Iraqi Freedom, Expeditionary Strike Force training and exercise Valiant Shield 2007 during the deployment. She returned to her homeport after seven months on 29 August 2007. In 2008, &quot;Preble&quot; successfully completed an accelerated training cycle and passed a rigorous Inspection Board and Survey (INSURV) in May. That fall, &quot;Preble&quot; executed the integrated training phase with the &quot;Stennis&quot; Strike Group in preparation for a deployment in 2009.

===2010s===
&quot;Preble&quot; deployed on 17 January 2009 for a routine deployment with the &quot;Stennis&quot; Carrier Strike Group where she spent five months in the Seventh Fleet area of responsibility, participated in Exercise Foal Eagle and culminated the deployment with a diplomatic port visit in Tahiti, French Polynesia. &quot;Preble&quot; returned to home port on 15 June 2009. In 2010 &quot;Preble&quot; shifted to align with the Strike Group and hosted sailors from the Royal New Zealand Navy. The and replenishment tanker conducted exercises with &quot;Preble&quot; during a 3-day underway period. Additionally, &quot;Preble&quot; was called to act as the lead ship for a Destroyer Squadron Seven multi-group sail that showcased the ship&#x27;s anti-submarine warfare capabilities.

In September 2010, &quot;Preble&quot; conducted an Operational Test Launch of two Block 3C Tomahawk missiles and one Block 4E Tomahawk missile off the coast of San Nicholas Island. The launch was successful and aided in the further development of the weapon system. &quot;Preble&quot; participated in an Integrated Anti-Submarine Warfare Course at sea as well as three weeks of exercises with &quot;Ronald Reagan&quot; and sister ships in Destroyer Squadron Seven during the Composite Unit Training Exercise (COMPTUEX) in October to November 2010. In November 2010, &quot;Preble&quot; successfully conducted a Mark 54 torpedo technical evaluation in support of the Naval Undersea Warfare Center&#x27;s development of the torpedo. &quot;Preble&quot; accurately fired six MK 54 torpedoes during the evaluation.

In all, &quot;Preble&quot; had a successful 2010 and was awarded the Destroyer Squadron Seven Battle Efficiency Award which recognizes sustained superior performance, operational effectiveness, and continuous readiness. In addition, the ship earned the Black E (Maritime Warfare Excellence), Blue E (Logistics Management and Supply Excellence), Yellow E (Ship Safety) and Red E (Engineering/Survivability Excellence).

In February 2011, &quot;Preble&quot; deployed with Carrier Strike Group Seven. &quot;Preble&quot; was a first responder to the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami. The ship conducted humanitarian and disaster relief efforts off the coast of northeastern Japan.

After spending nearly a month off the coast of Japan, &quot;Preble&quot; began to conduct a series of fisheries patrols. From 28 February to 6 March 2011, she conducted these patrols in the Exclusive Economic Zones of various Pacific island nations as part of the Oceania Maritime Security Initiative. With modern technology, fishing vessels have increased their capability and capacity to catch more fish, and consequently, it is imperative that the rights of small island nations to their EEZ be preserved to prevent illegal fishing and exploitation of their ecosystems. EEZ patrols are part of an ongoing partnership between the U.S. Navy and U.S. Coast Guard to reduce and eliminate illegal, unregulated, unreported (IUU) fishing and effectively enforce fishing regulations across the Western Pacific.

&quot;Preble&quot;″s mission supported the United States&#x27; long-standing partnership with the maritime nations of Micronesia, Oceania, and the Marshall Islands, with the focus on IUU fishing in the EEZs of these island nations and on the high seas itself. During the course of this operation, &quot;Preble&quot; encountered multiple vessels conducting fishing operations in EEZ. All the data was reported to USCG District 14 for evaluation and follow-on action via the embarked Coast Guard liaison team. Also, &quot;Preble&quot;″s embarked detachment of Sikorsky SH-60 Seahawk helicopters from squadron HSL-43 was used to conduct routine aerial patrols, enabling the surveillance team to search multiple areas of interest.

She then continued west to operate as part of the Seventh and Fifth Fleets. &quot;Preble&quot; came under the command of the Fifth Fleet in May 2011 and conducted counter-piracy operations as part of Combined Task Force 151. &quot;Preble&quot; returned home in late 2011.

On 25 August 2011, BAE Systems Ship Repair was awarded a $14.5 million contract, in addition to a previous contract, to upgrade and repair &quot;Preble&quot;.

In 2019 it was announced that Preble would receive the HELIOS close in weapons system in 2021. USS Preble is the first destroyer to be equipped with a high-energy laser to counter surface craft and unmanned aerial systems. The destroyer will also receive a BAE Systems Ship Repair upgrade, bringing the ship up to date in terms of capability and complexity.

===2020s===

In 2024 USS Preble assisted the Missile Defense Agency in conducting FTM32. This mission was conducted off the coast of Kauai, Hawaii. Preble launched a Standard Missile-6 (SM-6) Dual II with Software Upgrade (SWUP) in order to intercept a Medium Range Ballistic Missile (MRBM). This mission was a collaboration by the Missile Defense Agency, United States Navy, Royal Australian Navy, and Lockheed Martin. The MDA Director Lieutenant General Heath Collins said this in regards to the mission “This successful intercept against an advanced threat-representative target in the final stages of flight demonstrated the power and flexibility of the Aegis Weapon System paired with the Standard Missile 6”. In 2024, USS Preble also demonstrated the HELIOS directed energy weapon system against a target drone.

==Coat of arms==
=== Shield ===
&quot;The shield consists of embattlement and scarlet rayonny splitting the shield. Above is a ships sail while below is a lion’s head with a crossed sword and cutlass.&quot;The traditional Navy colors were chosen for the shield because dark blue and gold represents the sea and excellence respectively. The attack and bombardment at Tripoli&#x27;s Harbor in 1803 against Barbary pirates, led by Commodore Preble, is shown by the embattlement and scarlet rayonny and represents the fire and destruction brought to the port. Scarlet is symbolic for courage, the fiery resolve and Preble&#x27;s determination to end attacks in the region on American trading vessels. The ships sail is another reference to the successful Tripoli attack and blockade as well as Preble&#x27;s other commands, particularly USS &quot;Constitution&quot; and the frigate &quot;Essex&quot;. The lions head comes from the Preble family coat of arms which signifies courage and strength. The crossed cutlass and sword characterize the combat readiness to defend the countries interests.

=== Crest ===
&quot;The crest consists of a compass rose with a cinquefoil escutcheon center, surrounded by a laurel wreath.&quot;The laurel wreath signifies honor and the compass rose points recall the eight battle stars earned by USS &quot;Preble&quot; (DD-345) for her World War II service. The compass rose denotes the modern capabilities and worldwide service of &quot;Preble&quot; and its predecessors. The blue escutcheon, is shaped as an AEGIS radar panel, represents the advanced technologies and modern warfare systems of the new &quot;Preble&quot;. A cinquefoil is centered in the escutcheon to remember the five previous ships to hold the &quot;Preble&quot; name.

=== Motto ===
&quot;The motto is written on a scroll of blue that has a gold reverse side.&quot;The ships motto is &quot;Intrepid Patriot&quot;. The motto is a reference to honor the United States Navy.

=== Seal ===
&quot;The coat of arms in full color as in the blazon, upon a white background enclosed within a dark blue oval border edged on the outside with a gold rope and bearing the inscription &quot;USS Preble&quot; at the top and &quot;DDG 88&quot; in the base all gold.&quot;

==In popular culture==
* USS &quot;Preble&quot; (DDG-88) appears in the 2009 film &quot;&quot;.
* USS &quot;Preble&quot; (DDG-88) is featured in the 2011 video game &quot;Battlefield 3&quot; and the 2013 video game &quot;Battlefield 4&quot;.

<doc id="765535" wikidata="Q954010" url="?curid=765535" title="National Union (Portugal)">
<text>The National Union () was the sole legal party of the Estado Novo regime in Portugal, founded in July 1930 and dominated by António de Oliveira Salazar during most of its existence.

Unlike in most single-party regimes, the National Union was more of a political arm of the government rather than holding actual power over it. The National Union membership was mostly drawn from local notables: landowners, professionals and businessmen, Catholics, monarchists or conservative republicans. The National Union was never a militant or very active organization.

Once Salazar assumed the premiership, the National Union became the only party legally allowed to function under the Estado Novo. Salazar announced that the National Union would be the antithesis of a political party. The NU became an ancillary body, not a source of political power. At no stage did it appear that Salazar wished it to fulfill the central role the fascist party had acquired in Mussolini&#x27;s Italy; in fact, it was meant to be a platform of conservatism, not a revolutionary vanguard.

The National Union&#x27;s ideology was corporatism, and it took as many inspirations from Catholic encyclicals such as &quot;Rerum novarum&quot; and &quot;Quadragesimo anno&quot; as well as from Mussolini&#x27;s corporate state. Unlike fascist parties, the National Union played no role in the government - it only served as a tool for the selection of National Assembly deputies, as well as a way to provide some legitimacy to non-competitive elections that Salazar&#x27;s regime regularly held. The National Union was set up to control and restrain public opinion rather than to mobilize it, and ministers, diplomats and civil servants were never compelled to join the party.

According to António Costa Pinto, the National Union was a moribund party, created by a governmental decree rather than by political activists, and which was &quot;dominated by the administration, put to sleep and reawakened in accordance with the situation at the time&quot;. He describes the party as &quot;an empty, undermined space into which were formally sent those who wanted to join the regime and which, once full, was closed&quot;. Pinto notes that the army was kept away from public life, and political activity was prohibited outside public life. This included the National Union, which lacked any kind of political activism. Therefore the party lacked an ideology, and did not mobilize the masses. Pinto argues that it was the opposite, as &quot;in fact demotivation was openly encouraged&quot;. He concludes that the party had a &quot;non-fascist nature&quot; and argues that it &quot;neither reached power at all nor, once created, fulfilled functions of control and monopoly of access to power or mobilization of the masses, which, in general, the fascists did.&quot;

Scholarly opinion varies on whether the Estado Novo and the National Union should be considered fascist or not. Salazar himself criticized the &quot;exaltation of youth, the cult of force through direct action, the principle of the superiority of state political power in social life, [and] the propensity for organizing masses behind a single leader&quot; as fundamental differences between fascism and the Catholic corporatism of the Estado Novo. Scholars such as Stanley G. Payne, Thomas Gerard Gallagher, Juan José Linz, António Costa Pinto, Roger Griffin, Grzegorz Rossoliński-Liebe and Arnd Bauerkämper, as well as Howard J. Wiarda, consider the Portuguese Estado Novo conservative authoritarian and not fascist. In his The Anatomy of Fascism, Robert Paxton express the same view, writing that Salazar&#x27;s regime was &quot;not only nonfascist, but voluntarily nontotalitarian&quot;. On the other hand, Portuguese scholars like Fernando Rosas, Manuel Villaverde Cabral, Manuel de Lucena, Manuel Loff and Raquel Varela think that the Estado Novo should be considered fascist.

== History ==
The party was founded in 1930 during the Ditadura Nacional period. Officially it was not a political party but an &quot;organization of unity of all the Portuguese&quot;. Salazar in the speech that launched the party, was vague in terms of its role, and he incorporated all the parties supporting the dictatorship, whether republican, monarchic or Catholic. Its first organic principles expressly declared that “all citizens, regardless of their political or religious beliefs” would be admitted as long as they adhered to the principles of Salazar’s speech of 30 June 1930.

The National Union was formed as a subservient umbrella organization to support the regime itself. It was the only party legally allowed under the Estado Novo regime; all other political parties were banned and persecuted, this later included the National Syndicalists, led by Francisco Rolão Preto, who were originally supporters. In 1934 Salazar arrested and exiled Francisco Rolão Preto as a part of a purge of the leadership of the Portuguese National Syndicalists. The Portuguese National Syndicalists broke into factions, some going into exile while the majority ended up joining the National Union. Salazar denounced the National Syndicalists as &quot;inspired by certain foreign models&quot; (meaning German Nazism) and condemned their &quot;exaltation of youth, the cult of force through direct action, the principle of the superiority of state political power in social life, [and] the propensity for organizing masses behind a single leader&quot; as fundamental differences between fascism and the Catholic corporatism of the &quot;Estado Novo&quot;.

The first leader of the National Union was the Interior Minister Colonel Lopes Mateus. The composition of the Central Commission indicated that the party was meant to support the regime rather than militate for it. Salazar became president, and Albino dos Reis, a former member of the Cunha Leal ULR, was nominated Vice President. The first Central Commission was composed by Bissaia Barreto, João Amaral, a judge and an integralist monarchist, and Nuno Mexia, who had been linked to the Union of Economic Interests (União dos Interesses Económicos) in the 1920s. Appointment to lead the party meant either &quot;retirement&quot; or a prestigious pause from government duties. The absence of youth was a characteristic of the National Union, particularly in the 1930s. At the first Congress, 68% of the delegates were over 40 years old.

According to historian António Costa Pinto, the National Union is an example of extreme weakness among dictatorships with weak single parties. There was no internal party activity until 1933. From 1934 onwards, after the creation of the regime’s new institutions, the National Union embarked on a period of lethargy from which it did not emerge until 1944. This lethargy can be partly explained by the affirmation by the regime that it did not attribute great importance to it beyond its utility as an electoral and legitimating vehicle.

Lawrence S. Graham and Harry M. Makler wrote that the party &quot;scarcely existed&quot;, and added: &quot;This single party appeared to be absent in national life. Filled with prominent people, it did not include the masses, and it showed itself only transiently during electoral periods.&quot; Graham and Makler also argue that this points to &quot;the absence of a true fascist movement&quot; in Portugal, noting the weak, amorphous and disorganized character of the National Union, unable to organise youth organizations and militias present in fascist movements.

The Estado Novo also created state bodies for propaganda, youth and labour, but they were not connected with the party. In 1931, the official newspaper of the National Union, &quot;Diário da Manhã&quot;. Its first issue was published on 4 April 1931. Using &quot;Diário da Manhã&quot;, the National Union called for national unity and cooperation, arguing that the &quot;foreign institutional system&quot; of the [[First Portiguese Republic &quot;had proved to be incompatible with the necessities, interests, qualities and even flaws of the Portuguese nation&quot;. It contrasted the supposed stability of the Estado Novo, as opposed to the pre-1926 republican government which &quot;transformed the country‟s public life into something like a tribal African disorder&quot;.
In 1938 Salazar recognized that National Union&#x27;s activities “were successively diminished until they had almost been extinguished”. With World War II&#x27;s end, the National Union came to life again. In October 1945, Salazar announced a liberalization program designed to restore civil rights that had been suppressed during the Spanish Civil War and World War II in hopes of improving the image of his regime in Western circles. The measures included parliamentary elections, a general political amnesty, restoration of freedom of the press, curtailment of legal repression and a commitment to introduce the right of &quot;[[habeas corpus]]&quot;. The opposition to Salazar started to organize itself around a broad coalition, the [[Movement of Democratic Unity]] (MUD), which ranged from ultra-Catholics and fringe elements of the extreme right to the [[Portuguese Communist Party]]. Initially, the moderate opposition controlled the MUD, but it soon became strongly influenced by the Communist Party, which controlled its [[Juvenile MUD|youth wing]]. In the leadership were several communists, among them [[Octávio Pato]], [[Salgado Zenha]], [[Mário Soares]], [[Júlio Pomar]] and [[Mário Sacramento]].
The opposition [[Movement of Democratic Unity]] was legal between 1945 and 1948, but even then, the political system was so heavily rigged that it had no realistic chance of winning.

The party won all seats in elections to the [[Assembly of the Republic (Portugal)|National Assembly of Portugal]] from 1934 to 1973. Opposition candidates were nominally allowed after 1945 but prematurely withdrew in the 1945 and 1973 legislative elections. In 1970, two years after Salazar had been replaced as a leader and prime minister by [[Marcelo Caetano]], the name of the party was changed to Acção Nacional Popular (&quot;[[:pt:Ação_Nacional_Popular|People&#x27;s National Action]]&quot;). Subsequent to Salazar&#x27;s retirement, the party faced formal competition in the [[1969 Portuguese legislative election|1969 legislative election]]. However, the conduct of this election was little different from past contests, with the ANP winning all [[Electoral district|constituencies]] in a landslide.

Under Caetano, the party and the regime further softened its rule - the police is reported to &quot;have become more respectful of legality [...] and would spare systematically moderate opponents&quot;, and the People&#x27;s National Action proclaimed that it would move &quot;toward a degree of pluralism&quot;. Censorship was softened, political debates occurred, while strikes and demonstrations came to be tolerated. Caetano also permitted the formation of a non-state labor movement - the [[General Confederation of the Portuguese Workers]]. Compared to Salazar, Caetano presided over &quot;a far more open, more pluralist, more socially just system&quot;. 

The most important ideological change that Caetano implemented was reforming Salazar&#x27;s syndicalism - in 1969, Caetano gave the state syndicates a right to elect their own leadership without government approval. Graham and Makler wrote that this reform proved revolutionary: &quot;Within months the sindicatos, which for decades had been trade unions in name only, began to be transformed from amorphous government agencies into genuine instruments of the workers. For the first time opposition elements, including Communists in the case of some sindicatos, swept the union elections, and the elections were allowed to stand.&quot; Wage disputes were also reformed, and the workers&#x27; syndicates would not select their own representatives in the disputes, granting independent bargaining power. Caetano also introduced a vast range of new social programs, and ensured their enforcement. 

Caetano has been described as a &quot;frustrated liberal&quot; who was willing to but unable to implement the process of democratization, and who was thwarted in his reforms by the salazarista forces. Ultimately, he was unable to move forward with his reforms, and he came to preside over &quot;liberalization without democratization&quot;. The political gridlock that Caetano encountered, together with the colonial wars, growing factionalism and the growth of independent labor movement, resulted in &quot;the total incapacity of the Caetano regime to find a political solution.&quot;

The party had no real philosophy apart from support for the regime. The [[National Syndicalists (Portugal)|National Syndicalist]] leader, [[Francisco Rolão Preto]] criticized the National Union in 1945 as a “grouping of moderates of all parties, bourgeois without soul or faith in the national and revolutionary imperatives of our time”.

As a result of its lack of ideology, it disappeared in short order after the [[Carnation Revolution|Portuguese Revolution of 1974]]. It has never been revived, and no party claiming to be its heir has won any seats in the [[Assembly of the Republic (Portugal)|Assembly of the Republic]] in modern Portugal.

<text>Dennis Joseph Dougherty (August 16, 1865 – May 31, 1951) was an American Catholic prelate who served as Archbishop of Philadelphia from 1918 until his death in 1951. He was made a cardinal in 1921. He was Philadelphia&#x27;s longest-serving archbishop and its first cardinal.

==Early life and education==
Dennis Dougherty was born on August 16, 1865, in the Homesville section of Butler Township in Schuylkill County, Pennsylvania. Nicknamed &quot;Dinny&quot; by his parents, he was the sixth of ten children of Patrick and Bridget (née Henry) Dougherty, who were natives of County Mayo, Ireland. The family lived in the Coal Region of Pennsylvania, with Dougherty&#x27;s father working as a coal miner and Dougherty himself spending his summer vacations as a breaker boy in the mines.

As there was no Catholic church or parochial school in Homesville, the family worshiped at St. Joseph&#x27;s Church in nearby Girardville and Dougherty attended public school there as well. At age 14, Dougherty applied to enter St. Charles Borromeo Seminary in Overbrook and even passed the entrance examination, but because of his young age, he was denied admission. On the advice of his pastor in Girardville, he enrolled at Collège Sainte-Marie in Montreal, where he studied under the Jesuits for two years.

In 1881, Dougherty applied to St. Charles Seminary again and was accepted, skipping the first two years of instruction. He remained at Overbook until 1885, when he was sent by Archbishop Patrick John Ryan to continue his studies at the Pontifical North American College in Rome. He was considered such an outstanding student that he was once waved away from an examination room by Professor Francesco Satolli, who told him, &quot;Consider yourself examined.&quot; At the end of his studies in 1890, he received the degree of Doctor of Divinity.

==Priesthood==
While in Rome, Dougherty was ordained a priest on May 31, 1890, by Cardinal Lucido Parocchi at the Lateran Basilica. He celebrated his first Mass the next day at the altar of the Chair of Saint Peter at St. Peter&#x27;s Basilica.

Upon his return to Philadelphia in the summer of 1890, Dougherty was appointed to the faculty of St. Charles Borromeo Seminary as a professor of Latin, English, and history. Over the next 13 years, he also taught Greek, French, and Hebrew before being promoted to the chair of dogmatic theology.

As a professor, Dougherty was known to be &quot;a severe taskmaster&quot; who lectured almost entirely in Latin. He also established a reputation as a scholar with his translation of the works of Orazio Marucchi and his publication of a series of articles on Anglican ordinations. He was invited to take the chair of dogmatic theology at the Catholic University of America, but Archbishop Ryan refused to let him leave Overbrook.

==Bishop in the Philippines==
===Nueva Segovia===
On April 7, 1903, Dougherty was notified of his appointment as Bishop of Nueva Segovia in the Philippines. The annexation of the heavily Catholic islands by the United States and the rejection of Philippine independence by the 1898 Treaty of Paris had helped fuel the Philippine–American War, during which the Catholic priest Gregorio Aglipay broke with Rome and founded the nationalist Philippine Independent Church. After the war ended with an American victory in 1902, Pope Leo XIII appointed four American bishops to Philippine dioceses, including Dougherty.

Dougherty received his episcopal consecration on June 14, 1903, from Cardinal Francesco Satolli (his former professor), with Cardinal Pietro Gasparri and Archbishop Enrico Grazioli serving as co-consecrators, at the church of Santi Giovanni e Paolo al Celio in Rome. He then returned to Philadelphia and recruited five priests to join him in the Philippines, including Daniel James Gercke and John Bernard MacGinley. The bishop and his priests left Philadelphia on August 24 and arrived at the diocesan seat in Vigan on October 22.

War had left many Catholic institutions in a state of disrepair, and several church properties were under the control of Aglipay and his supporters, including the Vigan Cathedral. Dougherty&#x27;s arrival was not welcomed by the Filipinos who wanted a native clergy; in September 1904, Bishop Thomas Augustine Hendrick mentioned to President Theodore Roosevelt that &quot;three attempts have been made to murder Bishop Dougherty of Vigan...&quot; Dougherty managed to recover church property by forcing Aglipay to unsuccessfully prove ownership in court, and he made house-to-house visits in Vigan to collect funds to repair the cathedral.

The diocesan seminary, which had been occupied by American troops during the war, was reopened in June 1904 and staffed by the Jesuits. A girls&#x27; academy was also reopened under the care of the Sisters of Saint Paul of Chartres, who established a second academy in Tuguegarao. Dougherty toured the diocese on horseback and by canoe, confirming as many as 70,000 children at a time.

===Jaro===
Following the death of Bishop Frederick Z. Rooker, Dougherty was appointed to succeed him as Bishop of Jaro on June 21, 1908. His new diocese had a Catholic population of 1.3 million but only half of the 151 churches had resident pastors. During his tenure in Jaro, Dougherty managed to find pastors for 41 churches while also establishing six new parishes and converting 12 missions into parishes. He opened a hospital staffed by the Sisters of Saint Paul of Chartres, who had worked with him in Nueva Segovia. To combat the efforts of Protestant missionaries in the Philippines, Dougherty operated a movie theater where the price of admission was a Protestant Bible.

After San Francisco&#x27;s auxiliary bishop Denis J. O&#x27;Connell was made Bishop of Richmond in 1912, Archbishop Patrick William Riordan sought a coadjutor bishop and his first choice was Dougherty, whom he had met when Dougherty stopped in San Francisco en route to the Philippines for the first time. Dougherty expressed his willingness to accept the post in San Francisco, but the move was vetoed by Cardinal Rafael Merry del Val, believing Dougherty was needed more in the Philippines.

==Bishop of Buffalo==
After 12 years in the Philippines, Dougherty&#x27;s health was beginning to fail and he requested to return to the United States in 1915. Bishop Charles H. Colton of the Diocese of Buffalo died in May that year, followed by Archbishop James Edward Quigley of the Archdiocese of Chicago in July. Dougherty was initially slated for Chicago while Auxiliary Bishop George Mundelein of Brooklyn was slated for Buffalo. However, when rumors of Rome&#x27;s intentions reached the British government, it reportedly objected to having a German bishop like Mundelein so close to the Canadian border during World War I. The appointments were switched and Dougherty was named Bishop of Buffalo on December 9, 1915.

Dougherty formally took charge of his new diocese on June 7, 1916, when he was installed at St. Joseph Cathedral. At the time of Dougherty&#x27;s arrival, the diocese was burdened with a debt of $1.6 million from the construction of the new cathedral. Dougherty almost completely eliminated that debt by taxing the diocese&#x27;s parishes according to their means. During his tenure, he also established 15 new parishes and supported the war effort through liberty bond campaigns and Red Cross drives.

==Archbishop of Philadelphia==
Following the death of Archbishop Edmond Francis Prendergast, Dougherty was appointed Archbishop of Philadelphia by Pope Benedict XV on May 1, 1918. Upon his homecoming, he was installed on July 10, 1918, at the Cathedral of Saints Peter and Paul, in a ceremony presided over by Cardinal James Gibbons.

Similar to his time as a seminary professor, Dougherty was known as the &quot;strictest disciplinarian...[who] rules his clergy with an iron hand, insists on punctuality, obedience, deference.&quot; He was also known as &quot;God&#x27;s Bricklayer&quot; for his massive expansion of the archdiocese. During his 33-year tenure in Philadelphia, the number of Catholics in the archdiocese increased from approximately 710,000 to 1,031,866; priests from 779 to 1,910; religious sisters from 3,884 to 6,819; churches from 327 to 397; hospitals from six to 18; parochial schools from 180 to 325; high schools from three to 56; and colleges from three to seven. Among the colleges founded during his tenure were Immaculata University (1920), Rosemont College (1921), Chestnut Hill College (1924), and Gwynedd Mercy University (1948).

===1918 influenza pandemic===
Very early into Dougherty&#x27;s tenure as archbishop, the 1918 influenza pandemic struck Philadelphia. More than 17,500 Philadelphians died in the first six months of the pandemic, with a single-day high of 837. The Philadelphia Liberty Loans Parade, held nearly three months after Dougherty&#x27;s arrival, resulted in 12,000 deaths alone.

Dougherty authorized the use of church facilities as temporary hospitals. Many nuns worked as nurses and Dougherty asked for volunteer gravediggers among the students at St. Charles Seminary. In compliance with the state Board of Health&#x27;s order in October 1918, Dougherty closed all churches and schools to public gatherings. When the pandemic subsided, Mayor Thomas B. Smith expressed his gratitude to Dougherty by saying, &quot;I look upon the services rendered by the Archbishop and the nuns as one of the most potent aids in making the headway we have toward getting control of the epidemic.&quot;

===Cardinal===
On February 13, 1921, it was announced that Pope Benedict XV would elevate Dougherty to the College of Cardinals. He was created Cardinal-Priest of &quot;Santi Nereo e Achilleo&quot; in the consistory of March 7, 1921. He was the first Archbishop of Philadelphia to serve as a cardinal, beginning a tradition that would last for 90 years. As a cardinal, Dougherty served as a member of the congregations for Discipline of the Sacraments, Rites, Propagation of the Faith, and Oriental Churches.

Dougherty was unable to participate in the first papal conclave following his elevation. He was touring the West Indies when Benedict XV died on January 22, 1922. After briefly returning to Philadelphia, he departed from New York with Cardinal Louis-Nazaire Bégin of Quebec on January 28 but noted that he did not expect to arrive in time for the conclave, which was scheduled to begin on February 2. Their ship was delayed by severe storms, and they received news of the election of Pope Pius XI while at sea. Cardinal William Henry O&#x27;Connell of Boston also missed the conclave, leaving no American electors. After arriving in Rome on February 9, Dougherty had a private audience with the new pope, who had relatives living in Bloomsburg, Pennsylvania. Dougherty was able to participate in the 1939 conclave that elected Pope Pius XII.

===Catholic education===
Dougherty, whose entire time as a priest was spent in teaching, was insistent on the establishment of a parochial school at every parish. He frequently threatened to suspend priests who were unwilling to follow this directive, believing, &quot;A parochial school is a necessity, especially in this country where our children breathe in an atmosphere of heresy, unbelief, and sometimes irreligion...Priests and parents are bound to provide a religious education for children.&quot;

In an address to the graduating class of Villanova University in June 1921, Dougherty denounced plans for a federal Department of Education, saying, &quot;We give notice that we will never permit our Catholic schools to be controlled by a clique of politicians in Washington.&quot;

===Ethnic groups===
To offset the intensifying efforts of Protestant evangelization among Italian Philadelphians, Dougherty introduced Italian classes at St. Charles Borromeo Seminary and placed priests who had studied in Rome at Italian churches. However, he also discouraged Italian religious festivals like the Feast of San Gennaro, which were popular elsewhere in the country, to encourage assimilation. Tensions between Dougherty and the Italian Catholic community reached a high point in 1933, when the cardinal&#x27;s plan to close the Italian-speaking parish of Our Lady of Good Counsel in South Philadelphia sparked a riot. On the eve of the parish&#x27;s closure, thousands of parishioners occupied the church and even held a priest hostage for five months. The congregation took the case to the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania but lost, and Dougherty finally closed the church in 1937.

From 1921 until his death in 1951, Dougherty served as president of the Commission for the Catholic Missions among the Colored People and the Indians. He encouraged the work of Mother (now Saint) Katharine Drexel among Native Americans and African Americans, and once wrote, &quot;Perhaps the greatest problem confronting the nation is that of the colored race, who were brought here as slaves and have been abandoned to their fate.&quot; In 1923, he declared that elementary school admissions would be based on parish residence, regardless of race, ending a policy of sending Black children to schools in predominantly Black parishes. The following year he established Holy Savior Church (now St. Ignatius) in West Philadelphia, where the Sisters of the Blessed Sacrament also opened a convent in 1925. Holy Redeemer Church for Chinese Catholics was opened in 1941 and visited by Cardinal Thomas Tien Ken-sin in 1946.

===Movie theater ban===
In May 1934, Dougherty forbid Catholics in the Archdiocese of Philadelphia from entering movie theaters, declaring that the film industry&#x27;s focus on &quot;sex and crime&quot; was a &quot;vicious and insidious attack...on the very foundations of our Christian civilization.&quot; He added: &quot;The only argument likely to be heard now is that which affects the box office.&quot; As a result, ticket sales soon plummeted by 20-40 percent.

Due to the decrease in revenue, many studio executives and other public figures begged Dougherty to end the boycott, including Samuel Goldwyn and John B. Kelly Sr. He twice refused to arrange a meeting with Harry Warner. While Dougherty never revoked the ban, Catholics gradually returned to theaters. In June 1934, one Philadelphia Catholic, Joseph Breen, was appointed to head the newly created Production Code Administration and apply the Hays Code to film production.

===Philadelphia priests accused of sexual abuse===

According to an official history of the Archdiocese of Philadelphia, Dougherty &quot;reserved the appointment of pastors to himself, though a powerful intercessor could of course help.&quot; A 2005 grand jury report included at least two priests during Dougherty&#x27;s tenure (1918-1951) who were accused of sexual abuse and transferred to other parishes:

*Rev. Gerard W. Chambers was accused of molesting numerous altar boys during his 40 years as a priest in the Archdiocese of Philadelphia, and was transferred to 11 different parishes under Dougherty&#x27;s tenure between 1934 and 1949.
*Rev. Joseph P. Gausch wrote letters to another priest detailing his abuse of young boys, which were brought to Dougherty&#x27;s attention in 1948. After being sent to a hospital in Wisconsin to do &quot;penance,&quot; Gausch was assigned to St. Anthony of Padua Parish in Easton in 1949.

==Later life and death==
During the 1948 presidential election, Dougherty gave the invocation at the Republican National Convention and later the Democratic National Convention, both of which were held in Philadelphia that year. In February 1949, he held his first press conference since becoming a cardinal in 1921 to denounce the treatment of Cardinal József Mindszenty, whose trial in Hungary he labeled a &quot;mockery of justice.&quot;

On the morning of May 31, 1951, shortly after celebrating a private Mass marking the 61st anniversary of his priestly ordination, Dougherty died from a stroke at his residence. His funeral Mass was celebrated by Bishop J. Carroll McCormick, Dougherty&#x27;s nephew and an auxiliary bishop of Philadelphia. He is buried in the crypt of the Cathedral Basilica of Saints Peter and Paul.

Cardinal Dougherty High School in Philadelphia is named in his honor.

<text>Charles Benedict Driscoll (October 19, 1885 – January 15, 1951) was a U.S. journalist and editor. Driscoll was born south of Wichita, Kansas on a farm that was purchased by his father after emigrating from Ireland by way of New York and Ohio. Driscoll wrote of his life in Kansas in the &quot;Kansas Irish&quot; trilogy; the first two books published in 1943 (&quot;Kansas Irish&quot;) and 1946 (&quot;Country Jake&quot;) and the last &quot;East and West of Wichita&quot; in manuscript, published in E-book by Rowfant Press in 2014. &quot;Kansas Irish&quot; was republished by Rowfant Press in 2011 in an illustrated paperback edition, introduction by Dr. Matthew Jockers. He began his career as a journalist writing for the &quot;Wichita Eagle&quot;, and is popularly credited as the originator of the &quot;school page&quot; in newspapers. Driscoll became editor of the &quot;Wichita Eagle&quot; in 1919 but was forced out of his position in the 1920s by the Ku Klux Klan, active in Kansas politics at the time. Driscoll worked as an editor for the McNaught Syndicate from 1928 until his death, and continued the popular &quot;New York Day by Day&quot; column after the death of its creator O. O. McIntyre in 1938. Dr. Matthew Jockers has written on the importance of Driscoll as a writer on the Irish in the West [&quot;A Window Facing West: Charles Driscoll&#x27;s Kansas Irish&quot; &quot;New Hibernia Review&quot; Volume 8, Number 3], helping to revive interest in his writing and life.

<text>Hugh Aloysius Drum (September 19, 1879 – October 3, 1951) was a career United States Army officer who served in World War I and World War II and attained the rank of lieutenant general. He was notable for his service as chief of staff of the First United States Army during World War I, and commander of First Army during the initial days of World War II.

Drum was attending Boston College when his father, Captain John Drum, was killed in action in Cuba on July 1, 1898, during the Spanish–American War. Offered a direct commission in the United States Army, Drum was appointed a second lieutenant of Infantry. He served in the Philippines during the Philippine–American War, took part in the Battle of Bayan, and received the Silver Star for heroism. He continued to advance through positions of more rank and responsibility in the early 1900s, and took part in the Veracruz and Pancho Villa Expeditions.

During World War I, Drum served as chief of staff for First United States Army, and led the planning for First Army&#x27;s participation in the Saint Mihiel and Meuse-Argonne offensives. He was promoted to temporary brigadier general and received the Army Distinguished Service Medal. After the war, Drum commanded 1st Infantry Brigade, 1st Infantry Division, Fifth Corps Area, and the Hawaiian Department. Having served as the Army&#x27;s deputy chief of staff and inspector general, Drum was a candidate for Army Chief of Staff in 1939 but the position went to George C. Marshall.

Drum received promotion to lieutenant general in August 1939, and commanded the Eastern Defense Command during the early years of World War II. He reached the mandatory retirement age of 64 in 1943, after which he was commander of the New York Guard (1943–1948), and president of Empire State, Inc., the company that managed the Empire State Building (1944–1951).

Drum died in New York City on October 3, 1951. He was buried at Arlington National Cemetery.

==Early life==
Born at Fort Brady, Chippewa County, Michigan, on September 19, 1879, Hugh A. Drum was the son of Margaret (Desmond) Drum (1846–1927) of Boston and Captain John Drum (1840–1898), a career army officer who was killed in Cuba while serving with the 10th Infantry Regiment during the Spanish–American War.

In 1894, Drum graduated from Xavier High School in New York City, which he had attended while his father was an instructor at the school. Initially intent upon a career as a Jesuit priest, he enrolled at Boston College. Under the provisions of a recently passed law allowing recognition for sons of officers who displayed exceptional bravery during the Spanish–American War, Drum was offered a direct commission as a second lieutenant on September 9, 1898, which he accepted. (He received his Bachelor of Arts degree from Boston College in 1921.)

==Start of military career==

Joining the United States Army while the Spanish–American War and subsequent insurrections and conflicts were ongoing, he served with the 12th Infantry Regiment in the Philippines, and then with the 25th Infantry Regiment. He participated in the Battle of Bayan in 1899, for which he received the Silver Citation Star, which was converted to the Silver Star when that decoration was created in 1932.

Drum later served as aide-de-camp to Frank Baldwin before returning to a series of assignments in the United States. He completed the School of the Line (precursor to the Officer Basic and Advanced Courses) in 1911 as an honor graduate. He graduated from the United States Army Command and General Staff College in 1912, and later served there as an instructor.

In 1914 he was an assistant chief of staff for the force commanded by Frederick Funston during the Veracruz Expedition. Drum served at Fort Bliss and Fort Sam Houston in Texas during 1915 and 1916 as part of the Pancho Villa Expedition. It was serving at these locations that brought Drum into contact with Major General John J. Pershing, who thought highly of him, and &quot;saw that he had talent as a staff officer&quot;.

==World War I==
At the start of America&#x27;s involvement in World War I, Pershing named Drum an assistant chief of staff of the First Army, commanded first by Pershing and later by Lieutenant General Hunter Liggett. In 1918, he was promoted to colonel and became First Army chief of staff. He was promoted to temporary brigadier general in the last weeks of the war. Drum was commended for his work to assemble and organize First Army&#x27;s staff, and for the planning of the St. Mihiel and Meuse-Argonne offensives in September 1918, for which he received the Army Distinguished Service Medal and awards from several foreign countries. The citation for his Army DSM reads:

==Between the World Wars==
After the war, Drum served as the director of training and assistant commandant for the School of the Line at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, and commandant of the Command and General Staff College, where he taught the doctrine of open warfare—stressing maneuver and marksmanship over frontal attacks and firepower, using experienced troops, and supported by large artillery barrages—that the American Expeditionary Forces had attempted to practice in France.

From there he went to the Army staff at the War Department in Washington, D.C., where he publicly clashed with General Billy Mitchell about the disposition of the U.S. Army Air Service. During their repeated confrontations, which stretched over several years, Drum successfully lobbied Congress not to have the Air Service organized separately from the army.

From 1926 to 1927, Drum commanded 1st Infantry Brigade, 1st Infantry Division, and he was the division commander from May 1926 to May 1927. He served again as commander of the 1st Infantry Division from September 1927 to January 1930. From 1930 to 1931, Drum was the Inspector General of the US Army. Drum was promoted to major general when he assumed his duties as inspector general on January 29, 1930.

In 1931 Drum was assigned as commander of the Fifth Corps Area, based at Fort Hayes, Ohio. Drum returned to Washington in 1933 to serve as deputy to the Army&#x27;s Chief of Staff, Douglas MacArthur. He headed a board of senior officers that again sought to suppress advocates of an independent air force by setting the ceiling on Air Corps requirements for numbers of aircraft and tying any funding for expansion of the Air Corps to prior funding of the other branches first. In 1934, all the members of the Drum Board also sat on the presidential-initiated Baker Board, again setting its agenda to preclude any discussion of air force independence.

In 1935, Drum was a candidate for chief of staff, but Malin Craig was selected. From 1935 to 1937, Drum commanded the Hawaiian Department. It was during Drum&#x27;s posting in Hawaii that he renewed acquaintance with another ambitious officer, George S. Patton, who served as his assistant chief of staff for intelligence (G2), and with whom he had a contentious professional relationship. At a polo match in which Patton was playing, Drum was among the spectators and rebuked Patton for his use of angry profanity during the game. The civilian players, who were members of Hawaii&#x27;s wealthy elite on friendly terms with the equally wealthy and elite Patton, humiliated Drum by standing up for Patton.

In 1938, Drum succeeded James K. Parsons as commander of First Army and assumed command of Second Corps Area headquartered at Fort Jay, Governors Island, New York. When Craig retired in 1939, Drum was again a candidate for chief of staff. He wanted the position badly enough to set aside his feud with Patton and ask Patton to intercede with the retired but still influential John J. Pershing, their old mentor. Despite these efforts, Drum was passed over in favor of George C. Marshall. Though disappointed at not being selected, Drum was still highly enough regarded that he received promotion to lieutenant general in August 1939.
==World War II==
With the onset of preparations for World War II, Drum assumed command of the Eastern Defense Command, responsible for domestic defense along the Atlantic seaboard. During the 1941 Carolina Maneuvers, Drum commanded First Army. He was embarrassed and became the subject of mockery when he was captured on the first day by troops of the 2nd Armored Division under Patton&#x27;s command. After soldiers from Isaac D. White&#x27;s battalion detained Drum, the exercise umpires ruled that the circumstances would not have transpired in combat, so he was allowed to return to his headquarters, enabling the exercise to continue and Drum to save face. Despite the umpires&#x27; actions, the incident indicated to senior leaders that Drum might not be prepared to command large bodies of troops under the modern battlefield conditions the Army would face in World War II, so he was not considered for field command.

==Retirement==
After the Carolina Maneuvers, Drum was disappointed with an offer from Secretary of War Henry L. Stimson to go on what he perceived to be a low-profile assignment as chief of staff for the Chinese army of Chiang Kai-Shek. After declining the China mission, Drum continued as head of the Eastern Defense Command, which was expanded into the Eastern Military Area with the inclusion of U.S. bases in Bermuda and Newfoundland. He remained in this assignment until reaching the mandatory retirement age in September 1943. At his retirement, Drum received a second award of the Army Distinguished Service medal; the award was presented by Stimson, and the citation was read by Marshall.

==Post military career==
Drum was the commander of the New York Guard from 1943 to 1948. During the war, the New York Guard took on many responsibilities normally performed by the National Guard, in addition to internal security measures such as protecting key facilities from saboteurs and developing plans to respond if such an event occurred. When Drum retired from command in September 1948, Governor Thomas E. Dewey promoted him to general (four stars) on the New York Guard&#x27;s retired list. From 1944 until his death, he was the president of Empire State, Inc., the company that managed the Empire State Building.

<text>The Necanicum River is a river on the Pacific coast of northwest Oregon in the United States, approximately long. It drains a timber-producing area of the Northern Oregon Coast Range northwest of Portland. It forms the first estuary south of the mouth of the Columbia River along the Oregon Coast, reaching the Pacific Ocean at Seaside in Clatsop County.

==History==
&quot;Necanicum&quot; is one of several Indian names in northwest Oregon beginning with &quot;ne&quot;, meaning &quot;place&quot;. Necanicum is derived from Ne-hay-ne-hum, the name of an Indian village once on the stream. William Clark named it Clatsop River on January 7, 1806, but the name did not stick. The river was also once known as Latty Creek, for William Latty, an early pioneer in the southern part of Seaside.

==Watershed and course==
The Necanicum River rises south of Humbug Mountain (not to be confused with the Humbug Mountain in southwestern Oregon), in south central Clatsop County and south of the Saddle Mountain State Natural Area. The elevation of the river&#x27;s source is approximately . It flows generally west, along U.S. Route 26. Approximately from the coast, east of Tillamook Head, it turns north. The river enters the Pacific Ocean at Seaside. Its final approach to the ocean is nearly parallel to the coast running south to north through the downtown of Seaside.

The watershed of the Necanicum River drains .

Heading downstream, named larger tributaries of the Necanicum River include Grindy Creek (right), Bergsvik Creek (left), Little Humbug Creek (right), North Fork Necanicum River (right), South Fork Necanicum River (left), Mail Creek (left), Klootchy Creek (right), Beeman Creek (right), Circle Creek (left), Neawanna Creek (right), and finally Neacoxie Creek (right). Neacoxie Creek flows in from the north, draining Clatsop Plains, the last tributary before the river enters the ocean.

At one time, Cullaby Lake and Cullaby Creek drained into the river via the Neacoxie. The Clatsop Canal Project – Carnahan Ditch changed this and they now drain into the Skipanon River.

==Ecology and conservation==
The Necanicum River watershed is important breeding, rearing, and spawning grounds for several anadromous salmonids including chinook salmon (&quot;Oncorhynchus tshawytscha&quot;), coho salmon (&quot;O. kisutch&quot;), chum salmon (&quot;O. keta&quot;), steelhead (&quot;O. mykiss irideus&quot;), and sea-run cutthroat trout (&quot;O. clarki clarki&quot;). Resident cutthroat trout, rainbow trout (the stream resident form of &quot;O. mykiss irideus&quot;) and Pacific lamprey (&quot;Entosphenous tridentatus&quot;) are also present in the Necanicum River.

Coho salmon use the entire Necanicum River watershed, including all of the subwatersheds but despite this extensive coho habitat, the coho population is now small. Recent intensive spawning surveys from 1990 to 2000 indicate that only about 600 fish (range 185 to 1135) now use the river. Coho salmon prefer streams with a high degree of structural complexity, including the presence of large woods, flood plains, braided channels, beaver ponds, and occasionally lakes. Anthropogenic activities, including timber harvest, mining, water withdrawals, livestock grazing, road construction, stream channelization, diking of wetlands, and urbanization have damaged this critical habitat. In the mid-1800s, three tribes of Native Americans would gather in the Necanicum estuary each fall to harvest salmon.

In 2006, the Thompson Creek-Stanley Marsh wetland restoration project of the North Coast Land Conservancy began opening ditches that border of pasture so that it can be restored to a functioning Sitka spruce (&quot;Picea sitchensis&quot;) wetland. Addition of large woody debris and plantings of native willow, alder, spruce, and other wetland vegetation have attracted beaver who have built several dams, accelerating the conversion of the man-made pasture back to wetland. Coho salmon populations are already increasing on Thompson Creek, a tributary of Neawanna Creek. By using beavers to do most of the work instead of using the usual excavation and restoration techniques for wetlands mitigation, the project cost was reduced by an estimated $60,000 to $80,000.

The watershed is also important habitat for Roosevelt elk (&quot;Cervus canadensis roosevelti&quot;), black tailed deer (&quot;Odocoileus hemionus&quot;), beaver (&quot;Castor canadensis&quot;), North American river otters (&quot;Lontra canadensis&quot;), northern red-legged frog (&quot;Rana aurora&quot;), and a wide range of birds, from year-round residents like great blue herons (&quot;Ardea herodias&quot;) to migrating barn and tree swallows (&quot;Hirundo rustica&quot; and &quot;Tachycineta bicolor&quot;, respectively).

<text>USS &quot;Pinckney&quot; (DDG-91) is the 41st &quot;Arleigh Burke-class&quot; (Flight IIA) Aegis guided missile destroyer in the United States Navy. She is named for African American Ship&#x27;s Cook First Class William Pinckney (1915–1976), who received the Navy Cross for his courageous rescue of a fellow crewmember on board the aircraft carrier during the Battle of Santa Cruz.

&quot;Pinckney&quot; was laid down on 16 July 2001 by Ingalls Shipbuilding, at Pascagoula, Mississippi; launched on 26 June 2002; and commissioned on 29 May 2004 at Naval Construction Battalion Center Port Hueneme. She is the first &quot;Arleigh Burke&quot;-class destroyer to be equipped with the AN/SPY-1D(V) Littoral Warfare Radar upgrade, which was fitted to all subsequent Flight IIA &quot;Arleigh Burkes&quot;.

As of January 2018, &quot;Pinckney&quot; is homeported at NS San Diego, and assigned to Destroyer Squadron 23.

==Service history==

&quot;Pinckney&quot; made her maiden deployment September 2005. During this deployment, she made port visits to Guam, Singapore, Australia, Fiji and Hawaii. During this deployment, &quot;Pinckney&quot; became the first ever guided missile destroyer to refuel and replenish the Mark Five (MK V) high-performance combatant craft. She returned home after five months underway on 24 February 2006.

On 16 February 2007, &quot;Pinckney&quot; was awarded the 2006 Battle &quot;E&quot; award.

&quot;Pinckney&quot; departed San Diego on 2 April 2007 along with the aircraft carrier for a 6-month deployment. She returned home on 30 September 2007.

On 8 March 2014, &quot;Pinckney&quot; was diverted from a training mission in the South China Sea, to the southern coast of Vietnam, to help search for the missing Malaysia Airlines Flight 370.

On November 7 2023, &quot;Pinckney&quot; was spotted in the San Diego harbor en-route to sea trials with the SEWIP Block 3 EW suite fitted to both sides of her superstructure after spending two years docked at the General Dynamics NASSCO shipyard in the San Diego Harbor.

<doc id="765547" wikidata="Q1322780" url="?curid=765547" title="USS Momsen">
<text>USS &quot;Momsen&quot; (DDG-92) is the 42nd &quot;Arleigh Burke-class&quot; (Flight IIA) Aegis guided missile destroyer in service with the United States Navy. &quot;Momsen&quot; is the 26th destroyer of the &quot;Arleigh Burke&quot; class to be built by Bath Iron Works. She is named after Vice Admiral Charles B. &quot;Swede&quot; Momsen of Flushing, Queens, New York (1896–1967). Vice Admiral Momsen made many contributions to the navy such as the invention of the Momsen Lung when he was assigned to the Bureau of Construction and Repair. Momsen was also involved in the first successful rescue of a crew of a sunken submarine, , and subsequently supervised the salvage of the boat.

&quot;Momsen&quot;″s keel was laid on 16 November 2001. She was launched on 19 July 2003, sponsored by Admiral Momsen&#x27;s daughter, Evelyn Momsen Hailey. &quot;Momsen&quot; was commissioned on 28 August 2004, at Panama City, Florida.

The construction of &quot;Momsen&quot; and sister ship , from initial steelcutting to sea trials, was documented on the Discovery Channel television special &quot;Destroyer: Forged in Steel&quot;. The destroyers were not referenced by name, but their numbers were visible on their prows. As of 2019, &quot;Momsen&quot; is serving in the Pacific Fleet, homeported in NAVSTA Everett, Washington, and recently assigned to Destroyer Squadron 31 based at Pearl Harbor, Hawaii.

==Service history==
===2006===

On 6 April 2006, &quot;Momsen&quot; departed Naval Station Everett for her maiden deployment. During the six-month cruise, the ship conducted training and operations throughout Southeast Asia and the Western Pacific in the U.S. 7th Fleet area of responsibility. &quot;Momsen&quot; returned home from a successful maiden deployment on 22 September 2006.

===2008===
&quot;Momsen&quot; departed for her second deployment on 14 March 2008 with Carrier Strike Group Nine. During her deployment, &quot;Momsen&quot; provided critical humanitarian assistance for two foreign vessels, a stranded cargo vessel with engine problems and a former hijacked merchant vessel requiring food, water and medical attention. She returned home on 13 October 2008 after a seven-month underway period.

===2010-2011===

&quot;Momsen&quot; departed for her third deployment September 2010 with Carrier Strike Group Nine.

On 2 February 2011, &quot;Momsen&quot;, with the guided-missile cruiser , responded to a distress call from the Panamanian-flag merchant vessel &quot;Duqm&quot; in the Gulf of Oman. Both ships disrupted a pirate attack on &quot;Duqm&quot;, tracked the two pirate skiffs back to their mothership, and destroyed the two skiffs to prevent their use in future pirate attacks (&quot;pictured&quot;).

====Controversy====
The ship&#x27;s skipper, Commander Jay Wylie, was relieved of command on 27 April 2011 for &quot;loss of confidence in his ability to command.&quot; On 28 October 2011 Wylie pleaded guilty to sexual assault and rape, and was sentenced by court martial to 42 months imprisonment and loss of all navy benefits.

===2013===
During her 2013 deployment, &quot;Momsen&quot; initially joined Carrier Strike Group Eleven before undertaking independent operations with the U.S. Seventh Fleet. During this deployment, &quot;Momsen&quot; participated in such multilateral naval exercises as CARAT Indonesia 2013 in the Java Sea, Talisman Sabre 2013 in the Coral Sea, and SAREX in the Sea of Japan. &quot;Momsen&quot; operated with Carrier Strike Group Five during the Talisman Sabre and SAREX exercises. &quot;Momsen&quot; also paid port visits to Indonesia, Japan, Saipan, Australia. On 22 August 2013, &quot;Momsen&quot; returned to Naval Station Everett, Washington, after a four-month underway period as part of the U.S. Seventh Fleet.

===2018===
In 2018, &quot;Momsen&quot; made a port call to Anchorage.

===2022===
In February 2022, the &quot;Momsen&quot; departed Everett to begin a pan-Pacific deployment. 23 April 2022, &quot;Momsen&quot; made a port call to Goa.

On November 29, 2022 a webcam overlooking San Diego Bay has captured an apparent near collision between U.S. warships whose crews had to deploy evasive maneuvers. In the footage, crewmen from both ships are heard informing each other that they veering to port, or left, to eliminate the threat of a collision. The Navy, however, is investigating Tuesday’s incident involving the guided-missile destroyer, Momsen, and the landing ship Harpers Ferry, according to the Navy Times.

===2023===
&quot;Momsen&quot; made a port call to Homer, Alaska on 3-4 May. Local residents were given a tour of the ship while she was berthed at the local Deepwater Dock.

<text>USS &quot;Nitze&quot; (DDG-94) is the 44th &quot;Arleigh Burke-class&quot; (Flight IIA) Aegis guided missile destroyer in the United States Navy. She is named for Paul Nitze, who served as Secretary of the Navy under president Lyndon B. Johnson and as chief arms control adviser in the administration of president Ronald Reagan.

==Service history ==

The contract to build her was awarded to Bath Iron Works Corporation in Bath, Maine, on 6 March 1998, and her keel was laid down on 20 September 2002. She was launched on 3 April 2004, sponsored by Elisabeth Porter, Nitze&#x27;s wife. Nitze, who was 97 years old at the time, was present at the christening, thus adding the destroyer to the list of U.S. military vessels named after living Americans. &quot;Nitze&quot; was commissioned on 5 March 2005 in Norfolk, Virginia. &quot;Nitze&quot;, homeported in Norfolk, Virginia, went on her maiden deployment in January 2007 as part of the Expeditionary Strike Group, returning home on 3 July 2007.

On 12 September 2008, &quot;Nitze&quot; departed Norfolk for a seven-month deployment with Carrier Strike Group Two, led by , returning on 18 April 2009. In October 2009, &quot;Nitze&quot; was open to the public for tours in downtown Norfolk as part of the Navy Fleet Week celebration. She was moored at the Nauticus Museum and Half Moone Cruise terminal. During 1–5 July 2011, &quot;Nitze&quot; was docked in Eastport, Maine, for 4th of July celebrations.
From 12 March to 4 November 2012, &quot;Nitze&quot; completed her third deployment to the Fifth Fleet Area of Responsibility with the Battlegroup (CCSG 12). &quot;Nitze&quot; was deployed a fourth time, from 29 November 2013, to 15 July 2014, spending most of their time off the Horn of Africa conducting maritime security operations.

On 24 August 2016, &quot;Nitze&quot; was conducting a routine transit near the Strait of Hormuz, accompanied by , when the ship was approached by four small patrol craft of the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps. The US Navy called the maneuver a &quot;high speed intercept&quot;. After multiple attempts to contact the vessels, and then to warn them away, &quot;Nitze&quot; changed course to avoid closer contact. Two of the Iranian craft closed to before finally slowing and moving off.

On 13 October 2016, following two missile attacks on &quot;Mason&quot; from Houthi-held territory in war-torn Yemen, &quot;Nitze&quot; attacked three radar sites which had been involved in the earlier attacks with Tomahawk cruise missiles; the Pentagon assessed that all three sites were destroyed.

&quot;Nitze&quot; was underway for First East Coast Carrier Strike Group SWATT November 2018.

In July 2022, &quot;Nitze&quot; deployed as part of Destroyer Squadron 26 along with , , and embarked with Carrier Strike Group 10 led by . As part of the deployment, the ship sailed in the Sea of Marmara in February 2023 making it the first U.S. warship to enter the Sea of Marmara since the beginning of the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine. She returned to Norfolk on 5 April 2023 completing a nine-month long deployment.

<text>USS &quot;James E. Williams&quot; (DDG-95) is the 45th &quot;Arleigh Burke-class&quot; (Flight IIA) Aegis guided missile destroyer in the United States Navy. The ship was named for Boatswain&#x27;s mate Petty officer first class James Eliott Williams (1930–1999), a River Patrol Boat commander and Medal of Honor recipient from the Vietnam War who is considered to be the most decorated enlisted man in Navy history. As of April 2023 the ship is part of Destroyer Squadron 26 based out of Naval Station Norfolk.

==Construction==
&quot;James E. Williams&quot; had her keel laid down on 15 July 2002 by the Northrop Grumman Ship Systems at Ingalls Shipbuilding in Pascagoula, Mississippi. She was launched on 25 June 2003, sponsored by Elaine Weaver Williams, Chief Petty Officer Williams&#x27; widow. On 11 December 2004, &quot;James E. Williams&quot; was commissioned in Charleston, South Carolina.

==Service history==
On 2 May 2006, &quot;James E. Williams&quot; deployed on her maiden deployment as part of the Global War on Terrorism Surface Strike Group (GWOT SSG) 06–2. &quot;James E. Williams&quot; joined with the amphibious transport dock and guided-missile cruiser as part of a surge deployment. On 17 October 2006, &quot;James E. Williams&quot; completed her first deployment conducting anti-piracy operations off the coast of Somalia as part of the maritime security operations.

&quot;James E. Williams&quot; deployed again on 9 July 2007 as a part of the Carrier Strike Group. The strike group consisted of the aircraft carrier &quot;Enterprise&quot;, the destroyers , and ; the guided-missile cruiser ; and the fast-attack submarine , along with the fast combat support ship . On the morning of 30 October 2007, Combined Maritime Forces Headquarters, in Bahrain, received a call from the International Maritime Bureau, located in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, providing the status of the North Korean cargo vessel &quot;Dai Hong Dan&quot;, which had been taken over 29 October by Somali pirates. The ship was approximately northeast of Mogadishu, Somalia. At that time, &quot;James E. Williams&quot; was about from the vessel and sent a helicopter to investigate the situation. The destroyer arrived in the vicinity of the Korean ship midday local time and contacted the pirates via bridge-to-bridge radio, ordering them to give up their weapons. At that point, the Korean crew had confronted the Somali pirates, regained control of the ship and began communicating with &quot;James E. Williams&quot;, requesting medical assistance. The crew said the pirates had been in control of the bridge, but the crew had retained control of the steering and engineering spaces. The crew of &quot;James E. Williams&quot; provided care and assistance for approximately 12 hours to crew members and Somali pirates aboard &quot;Dai Hong Dan&quot;. Five pirates were captured and two were killed. The pirates remained aboard &quot;Dai Hong Dan&quot;.

In November 2007, &quot;James E. Williams&quot; aided the crew of the Taiwanese ship, M/V &quot;Ching Fong Hwa&quot; 168, which had also been hijacked by Somali pirates. After the pirates returned to shore, the destroyer escorted the Taiwanese ship out of Somali waters and provided needed supplies and medical assistance. On 19 December 2007, she returned from her second deployment to the Fifth Fleet AOR in support of Operations Iraqi and Enduring Freedom.

On 20 April 2009, &quot;James E. Williams&quot; left on her third deployment in three years, deploying to the sixth and fifth Fleet areas of operations from Naval Station Norfolk as the lead element of the Amphibious Ready Group. &quot;James E. Williams&quot; conducted maritime security operations in the Mediterranean Sea and Persian Gulf regions, including working with other nations&#x27; maritime forces. She returned to her homeport at Naval Station Norfolk on 19 October 2009.
On the evening of 8 August 2012, &quot;James E. Williams&quot; rescued ten mariners from a burning Iranian-flagged dhow (pictured) while operating in the Gulf of Oman. Of the ten mariners, eight were identified as Iranians and two were Pakistanis. The rescued mariners received medical treatment and transport to the carrier &quot;Enterprise&quot; before being repatriated back to Iran on 10 August. &quot;James E. Williams&quot; reentered the Mediterranean Sea on 25 August.

===Controversies===
*In December 2009, about six weeks after the ship returned to Norfolk from a six-month deployment to the Mediterranean and Arabian seas, nine crewmembers were given non-judicial punishments for fraternization. Five of the nine were male chief petty officers while the other four were female junior enlisted sailors. Furthermore, one other crew member faced criminal charges for sexual assault. The chiefs involved were being processed for separation from the Navy. In addition, the ship&#x27;s skipper, a commander, and the top enlisted sailor, a command master chief, were relieved of their positions and reassigned to shore-based administrative duties. Neither were implicated in the fraternization cases or alleged sexual assault but were removed due to a loss of confidence in their leadership. The ship&#x27;s executive officer (XO), also a commander, was reassigned as the XO on the destroyer . He was not implicated in any of the allegations.
*In September 2014, it was announced the ship&#x27;s commanding officer and command master chief were replaced pending an investigation into the command climate. At the time, &quot;James E. Williams&quot; was about midway through an eight-month deployment. At that time, a captain from the staff of Destroyer Squadron 2, assumed command of the ship.

===Ports visited===

During the 2014-2015 deployment, &quot;James E. Williams&quot; made port calls to Rota, Spain; Djibouti, Djibouti; Port Victoria, Seychelles; and Port Louis, Mauritius.

On 3 August 2017, the destroyer visited Trondheim Seilforening in Trondheim, Norway.

On 29 November 2017 she visited the Port of Odesa port in Ukraine.

During the 2017 Deployment, the ship visited Rotterdam, Netherlands; Kiel, Germany (as a part of Kiel Week); Reykjavik, Iceland; Rota, Spain; Trondheim, Norway; Bergen, Norway; Riga, Latvia; Lisbon, Portugal; Souda Bay, Greece; Manama, Bahrain; Jeddah, Saudi Arabia; and Odesa, Ukraine prior to returning home to Norfolk, VA on 23 December 2017. The ship&#x27;s crew also earned their Blue Nose for crossing into the Arctic Circle.

On 15 February 2021, &quot;James E. Williams&quot; and Colombian Navy frigate conducted a passing exercise in the Caribbean Sea.

<text>USS &quot;Halsey&quot; (DDG-97) is 47th &quot;Arleigh Burke-class&quot; (Flight IIA) Aegis guided missile destroyer in the United States Navy. She is the second ship to be named after Fleet Admiral William Halsey Jr.

==Construction==
Built in Pascagoula, Mississippi, the ship and crew were completely certified and &quot;surge ready&quot; 17 January 2006, nearly a year faster than previous DDGs.

==Operational history==

&quot;Halsey&quot; departed for her maiden deployment 6 August 2006 under her second commanding officer, Commander Pinckney. 2 November 2006 &quot;Halsey&quot; visited Kagoshima, Japan. That night, after a party for visiting local Japanese dignitaries, during which on-duty crew were drinking, there was a fire which damaged one of the main reduction gears. &quot;Halsey&quot; returned 24 December 2006, having worked with the &quot;Kitty Hawk&quot; Carrier Strike Group and taking part in ANNUALEX.

An incomplete report was filed and months later another fire and explosion brought to light the extent of the first fire. The ship&#x27;s commander was relieved and the damage to the ship was $8.5 million. Commander Paul J. Schlise took command of &quot;Halsey&quot; March 2007.

Commander Robert Beauchamp took command of &quot;Halsey&quot; on 17 August 2008.

&quot;Halsey&quot; departed Naval Base San Diego for her second deployment on 4 May 2008 for a deployment to the Persian Gulf. After six months and numerous port visits &quot;Halsey&quot; returned home to San Diego on 3 November 2008.

&quot;Halsey&quot;, homeported in San Diego, was part of Expeditionary Strike Group assigned to deploy to the U.S. 5th Fleet area of operations to conduct maritime security operations (MSO). MSO help develop security in the maritime environment, which promotes stability and global prosperity. These operations complement the counterterrorism and security efforts of regional nations and seek to disrupt violent extremists&#x27; use of the maritime environment as a venue for attack or to transport personnel, weapons or other material.

On 25 January 2013 &quot;Halsey&quot; performed a hull swap with and arrived at her new homeport, Joint Base Pearl Harbor–Hickam on 14 February 2013.

===Awards===
* Navy Unit Commendation - (Sep 2010-Mar 2011)
* Navy Meritorious Unit Commendation - (Nov 2011-May 2012)
* Navy E Ribbon - (2011)

==Namesake==
&quot;Halsey&quot; is named in honor of Fleet Admiral William Frederick &quot;Bull&quot; Halsey Jr. &quot;Halsey&quot; was commissioned 30 July 2005 at Naval Air Station North Island, Coronado, California, under commanding officer Commander James L. Autrey.
==In popular culture==
In the fall of 2012, USS &quot;Halsey&quot; served as a filming location for the TNT television series &quot;The Last Ship&quot; and its setting, USS &quot;Nathan James&quot; (DDG-151).

<doc id="765565" wikidata="Q1720865" url="?curid=765565" title="7Q5">
<text>Among the Dead Sea Scrolls, 7Q5 is the designation for a small Greek papyrus fragment discovered in Qumran Cave 7. It contains about 18 legible or partially legible Greek letters and was published in 1962 as an unidentified text. The editor assigned the fragment to a date between 50 BCE and 50 CE on the basis of its handwriting. In 1972, the Spanish papyrologist Jose O&#x27;Callaghan argued that the papyrus was in fact a fragment of the Gospel of Mark, chapter 6, verses 52 and 53. While most scholars have been unpersuaded by this argument, a vocal minority continue to support the identification of the fragment as a part of the Gospel of Mark. 

== O&#x27;Callaghan&#x27;s proposed identification ==

O&#x27;Callaghan challenged the reading of the original edition of the fragment, largely because he misunderstood the original editor&#x27;s use of an iota subscript in line 2 of the fragment. The Greek text below shows O&#x27;Callaghan&#x27;s reconstruction with bold font representing proposed identifications with characters from 7Q5:
ου γαρ
συνηκαν επι τοις αρτοις,
αλλ ην αυτων η καρδια πεπωρω-
μενη. και διαπερασαντες [επι την γην]
ηλθον εις γεννησαρετ και 
προσωρμισθησαν. και εξελ-
θοντων αυτων εκ του πλοιου ευθυς
επιγνοντες αυτον.

hou gar
synēkan epi tois artois,
all ēn autōn ē kardia pepōrō-
menē. kai diaperasantes [epi tēn gēn]
ēlthon eis gennēsaret kai 
prosōrmisthēsan. kai exel-
thontōn autōn ek tou ploiou euthys
epignontes auton.


&lt;poem&gt;
Proposed reconstruction:

for they did not
understand concerning the loaves
but was their heart harden-
ed. And crossing over [unto the land]
they came unto Gennesaret and
drew to the shore. And com-
ing forth out of the boat immediately
they recognized him.
&lt;/poem&gt;

&lt;poem&gt;
Mark chapter 6 verses 52-53 (New Revised Standard Version):

(52) For they did not understand about the loaves, 
but their hearts were hardened.
(53) When they had crossed over, 
they came to land at Gennesaret and moored the boat.
&lt;/poem&gt;
== Argument ==

O&#x27;Callaghan&#x27;s argument is as follows:
# According to O&#x27;Callaghan, in line 2 &quot;after the ⲱ, the ⲁ suggested by the editors seems inadmissible. The traces of the facsimile are too uncertain to allow a satisfactory reading, even though one comes to discover the left vertical stroke and the peculiar descending contour of a ⲛ similar to that of line 4.&quot; By reading a nu after the omega, O&#x27;Callaghan was able to reconstruct the words [α]υτων η [καρδια], which could be matched with a passage in Mark&#x27;s gospel.
# O&#x27;Callaghan pointed out that the combination of letters ννησ &lt;nnēs&gt; in line 4 may be part of the word Γεννησαρετ &lt;Gennēsaret&gt;.
# O&#x27;Callaghan argued that the spacing before the word και &lt;kai&gt; (&quot;and&quot;) suggests a paragraph break, which is consistent with the normative layout for Mark 6:52-53.
# Furthermore, a computer search &quot;using the most elaborate Greek texts ... has failed to yield any text other than Mark 6:52-53 for the combination of letters identified by O&#x27;Callaghan et al. in 7Q5&quot;.

The reasons why most scholars have rejected O&#x27;Callaghan&#x27;s arguments include the following:
* Several of the letters read or reconstructed by O&#x27;Callaghan are highly debatable (especially the nu in line 2).
* The spacing before the word και &lt;kai&gt; (&quot;and&quot;) proposed as a paragraph break may not be indicative of anything.
* In papyri spacings of this width can be also found within words (Pap. Bodmer XXIV, plate 26; in Qumran in fragment 4Q122).
* Other examples in the Qumran texts show that the word και &lt;kai&gt; (&quot;and&quot;) usually was separated with spacings – and this has nothing to do with the text&#x27;s structure (as proposed by O&#x27;Callaghan).
* The sequence ννησ can be also found in the word εγεννησεν &lt;egennēsen&gt; (&quot;begot&quot;), a very common word used in biblical genealogies and the reconstruction suggested by the original editor.

Further counterarguments
* To make the identification of the fragment with Mark 6:52-53, O&#x27;Callaghan had to substitute a δ (delta) for the τ (tau) found in line 3 of 7Q5, a substitution most scholars do not accept, although it is not without precedent in the ancient world.
* To make 7Q5 &#x27;fit&#x27; Mark 6:52-53, the words επι την γην &lt;epi tēn gēn&gt; (&quot;to the land&quot;) in line 4, which are found in Mark 6:53, would have to be considered as being omitted from 7Q5 in order to fit into its column. However, this omission is found in no extant manuscripts of Mark&#x27;s Gospel.
* The identification of the last letter in line 2 with &quot;nu&quot; does not fit into the pattern of this Greek letter as it is clearly written in line 4.
* The computer search performed by Thiede assumed that all the disputed letter identifications made by O&#x27;Callaghan were correct, an assumption which is rejected by scholars.
** A similar search performed by scholar Daniel Wallace, which allowed other identifications for the disputed letters, found sixteen matches.
** A computer search performed with the undisputed letters of the fragment 7Q5 does not find the text Mk 6:52-53, because the undisputed letter τ in line 3 does not fit to this text.

Anachronism found in Mark&#x27;s Gospel
* Another problem with identifying 7Q5 as Mark&#x27;s gospel is the argument that Mark 12:13–17 may potentially contain a reference to Vespasian&#x27;s Fiscus Judaicus imposed in 71 AD, meaning the gospel had to be written after this date, while 7Q5 dates to before 50 AD.

== Significance ==
If 7Q5 was actually a fragment of and was deposited in the cave at Qumran by 68 AD, it would become the earliest known fragment of the New Testament, predating P52 by at least some if not many decades. Yet, since the amount of text in the manuscript is so small, even a confirmation of 7Q5 as Markan &quot;might mean nothing more than that the contents of these few verses were already formalized, not necessarily that there was a manuscript of Mark&#x27;s Gospel on hand&quot;. Since the entirety of the find in Cave 7 consists of fragments in Greek, it is possible that the contents of this cave are of a separate &quot;Hellenized&quot; library than the Hebrew texts found in the other caves.

Sunday April 12th, 1992 7q5 was examined forensically in the Investigations Department of the Israel National Police. The investigation was carried out by Chief Inspector Sharon Landau in the presence of Dr Joseph Almog, the Director of the Israel Division of Identification and Forensic Science and Curator Joseph Zias. The decisive parts of the analysis were “recorded by a TV team from the Bavarian Television Company, ARD.” From the examination of line 2 of fragment 7Q5 under the stereo microscope, Thiede believed he saw the diagonal middle stroke of a NU, &quot;as demanded by the identification of 7Q5 as Mark 6:52-53” Yet, another examination by Stephen Pfann using the Rokefeller Museum&#x27;s Olympus SZ4045 Zoom Stereo Microscope with an Olympus Cold Light Illuminator 3000 detected no traces of the alleged diagonal and instead concluded that the original editors were correct in reading an iota: &quot;The iota is absolutely an iota.&quot;

<text>Edward Doane Swift (24 December 1870 – 25 September 1935 in Buffalo, New York) was an American astronomer. Like his father Lewis, he was a founder member of the British Astronomical Association in 1890, resigning 1892.

==Early years==
Edward D. Swift was the youngest son of the astronomer Lewis A. Swift and born during his father&#x27;s second marriage to Caroline Doane Topping. At the age of almost two years, his family moved to Rochester, New York, as his father hoped his hardware business would improve in a larger city.

==Collaboration with father==
The astronomical collaboration between Edward and his father began with the inauguration of a newly built observatory including a sixteen-inch refracting telescope in 1883. In the following years, many of Lewis Swift&#x27;s publications are brief references to Edward. Most notably, Edward discovered 25 new NGC-objects, 22 new IC-objects, multiple comets and a total of 46 nebulae. He also followed in his father&#x27;s footsteps by co-discovering the periodic comet 54P/de Vico-Swift-NEAT.

<text>USS &quot;Forrest Sherman&quot; (DDG-98) is an guided missile destroyer in the United States Navy and is the second US Navy ship to bear the name. She is part of Destroyer Squadron 2.

==Namesake==
She is named for Admiral Forrest Percival Sherman.

==Construction==
Built by Northrop Grumman Ship Systems Ingalls Shipbuilding in Pascagoula, Mississippi, &quot;Forrest Sherman&quot; was launched on 2 October 2004. Admiral Sherman&#x27;s daughter, Ann Sherman Fitzpatrick, is the ship&#x27;s sponsor.

==History==
The destroyer was commissioned on 28 January 2006 at Naval Air Station Pensacola, Commander Michael VanDurick in command, and six days later departed for her homeport at Naval Station Norfolk, Virginia to join the Atlantic Fleet.

She departed Norfolk for her maiden deployment in July 2007, visiting various nations around the Mediterranean Sea and the Black Sea. In August 2007, while the ship was visiting Sevastopol to conduct drills with the Ukrainian Navy, a naval mine from the Second World War was discovered from the vessel. The mine was secured before it could damage the ship. Also during that visit, she became the first US Navy ship to land a Ukrainian Navy helicopter. She also conducted the military exercise &quot;Reliant Mermaid 2007&quot; with the Turkish and Israeli navies. On that deployment, she circumnavigated the continent of Africa as part of Task Group 60.5, the US Navy&#x27;s Southeast Africa task force. She returned home on 19 December that year.

In early June 2008, &quot;Forrest Sherman&quot; deployed for three months in support of U.S. Southern Command&#x27;s Partnership of the Americas 2008 (POA 08) operation. She returned home on 29 August 2008.

On 25 November 2019, &quot;Forrest Sherman&quot; captured a stateless dhow carrying two 358 missiles and a large cache of Iranian missile parts destined for Yemen.

On 13 April 2022, &quot;Forrest Sherman&quot; arrived at Naval Station Norfolk following a surge deployment. On 11 June, &quot;Forrest Sherman&quot; departed Naval Station Norfolk for a NATO deployment. &quot;Forrest Sherman&quot; served as the flagship of Standing NATO Maritime Group 2 from 1 July to 13 December.

<doc id="765579" wikidata="Q652623" url="?curid=765579" title="USS Farragut (DDG-99)">
<text>USS &quot;Farragut&quot; (DDG-99) is the 49th &quot;Arleigh Burke-class&quot; (Flight IIA) Aegis guided missile destroyer in the United States Navy. She is the fifth Navy ship named for Admiral David Farragut (1801–1870). &quot;Farragut&quot; keel was laid down on 9 January 2004 at the Bath Iron Works in Bath, Maine. She was christened on 23 July 2005, with Senator Susan Collins of Maine as her sponsor. &quot;Farragut&quot; was commissioned on 10 June 2006 in Mayport, Florida.

&quot;Farragut&quot; is equipped with the &quot;Smart Ship&quot; data distribution and control system.

==Deployments and ship history==

&quot;Farragut&quot; departed Naval Station Mayport for her maiden deployment on 7 April 2008 in support of the Partnership of the Americas 2008 (POA 08). She returned home after six months on 5 October 2008.

&quot;Farragut&quot; departed Naval Station Mayport again in January 2010 for her second deployment, heading for the CENTCOM Area of Responsibility (AOR). After a quick transit through the Mediterranean Sea, she made her way south through the Suez Canal and into the Red Sea en route Djibouti, Djibouti to embark and become the flagship for Combined Task Force 151, the task force responsible for Counter-Piracy in the Gulf of Aden and Indian Ocean. &quot;Farragut&quot; then enjoyed a port visit to Port Victoria, Seychelles. After turning over the duties of CTF 151, &quot;Farragut&quot; enjoyed port visits to Salala, Oman and Manama, Bahrain, before rendezvousing with to assume shotgun duties for the aircraft carrier. Once complete with all tasking in CENTCOM, &quot;Farragut&quot; sailed back west through the Red Sea and the Mediterranean Sea to enjoy port visits in Santander, Spain and Lisbon, Portugal, before returning home to Naval Station Mayport in August 2010.

&quot;Farragut&quot; departed Naval Station Mayport once more in June 2012 for her third and latest deployment, to be spent in the Northern Atlantic Ocean, Mediterranean Sea, and CENTCOM AOR. Her first port visit was to Port Mahon, Menorca where the officers and crew visited the Admiral David Farragut Memorial and participated in a ceremony honoring the ship&#x27;s namesake. From there the ship traveled to Riga, Latvia; Tallinn, Estonia; Bodø, Norway; Severomorsk, Russia; Wilhelmshaven, Germany; and La Rochelle, France. During these port visits, &quot;Farragut&quot; welcomed over 50 foreign dignitaries on board for seven receptions, crew members provided numerous ship tours to hundreds of visitors, and Sailors took part in ten community relations projects. While in 6th Fleet, &quot;Farragut&quot; participated in exercises with the French, Italian, Norwegian, and Russian navies. She also embarked 15 foreign midshipmen and naval officers from Bulgaria, Georgia, Greece, Lithuania, and Sweden. When &quot;Farragut&quot; crossed the Arctic Circle on the way to her port visit in Russia, crew members participated in a very chilly, but memorable, Blue Nose ceremony on board. In the fall of 2012, &quot;Farragut&quot; transitioned to the 5th Fleet AOR and served with both the &quot;Dwight D. Eisenhower&quot; Carrier Strike Group and the Carrier Strike Groups. &quot;Farragut&quot; again served as the Combined Task Force (CTF) 151 flagship and embarked 17 Officers and Sailors for 3 months. As the CTF 151 flagship, &quot;Farragut&quot; was responsible for providing maritime security against piracy and securing freedom of navigation to vessels in the Gulf of Oman, Gulf of Aden and Somali Basin. While serving in the 5th Fleet, &quot;Farragut&quot; made port visits to Manama, Bahrain; Jebel Ali, UAE; and Muscat, Oman. She also completed naval exercises with the Saudi Arabian, Russian, and Australian navies. In November 2012, &quot;Farragut&quot; participated in joint exercises in the Persian Gulf during which she embarked the Combined Task Force 55 staff and provided vital inputs to the development of new surface warfare tactics. &quot;Farragut&quot;″s visit, board, search and seizure (VBSS) team conducted multiple training exercises, supported maritime interdiction operations, and completed rescue and assistance boardings of two vessels in distress. After Farragut departed the 5th Fleet, she made her final port visit to Bar, Montenegro. While in Bar, four &quot;E&#x27;s&quot; were painted on the bridge wings to signify &quot;Farragut&quot;″s selection for the 2012 Battle Efficiency Award and three Command Excellence Awards. These awards recognized the hard work and dedication displayed by &quot;Farragut&quot;″s crew during the past year.

&quot;Farragut&quot; left Mayport on 6 August 2022 for a deployment with the Carrier Strike Group.

5 February 2024: The Farragut, along with the “Valkyries” of HSM-50 Helicopter Maritime Strike Squadron (HSM) 50 — deployed in September 2023 to support Joint Interagency Task Force-South’s counter-narcotics operations in the Caribbean Sea returned back to Mayport.

==Engagements==
On 21 February 2010, a SH-60B Seahawk helicopter from &quot;Farragut&quot; disrupted two attempts by Somali pirates to attack the Tanzanian vessel MV &quot;Barakaale 1&quot;. The helicopter then stopped the pirate skiff as it attempted to speed away, by firing warning shots across its bow. A Visit, Board, Search and Seizure (VBSS) team from &quot;Farragut&quot; boarded the vessel and the eight suspected pirates were taken aboard &quot;Farragut&quot;.

For the majority of her 2010 deployment the CENTCOM AOR, &quot;Farragut&quot; served as flagship of Combined Task Force 151 (CTF-151), on an anti-piracy mission. On 1 April 2010, three suspected pirate boats fired on a Sierra Leone flagged tanker, MV &quot;Evita&quot;, north-west of Seychelles. &quot;Evita&quot; was fired on, but managed to escape, in part by crew firing flares at their attackers. They reported the attack to CTF-151, and &quot;Farragut&quot; responded. After boarding the pirate skiffs, and moving the pirates to the smaller, less capable skiffs, &quot;Farragut&quot; destroyed the pirate &quot;mother&quot; skiff.

On 29 January 2013 Yemeni authorities working alongside &quot;Farragut&quot; intercepted a ship in the Arabian Sea carrying an illegal-arms cache. The cache included surface-to-air missiles, C-4 explosives, rocket propelled grenades and other weapons.

On 28 April 2015, &quot;Farragut&quot; responded to a distress call from , which was travelling through the Strait of Hormuz when she came under fire from an Iranian patrol boat.

On 14 January 2020, the &quot;Farragut&quot; and a Russian warship nearly collided with one another in the North Arabian Sea.

<doc id="765581" wikidata="Q2000800" url="?curid=765581" title="USS Kidd (DDG-100)">
<text>USS &quot;Kidd&quot; (DDG-100) is the 50th &quot;Arleigh Burke-class&quot; (Flight IIA) Aegis guided missile destroyer in the United States Navy. She is the third Navy ship named after Rear Admiral Isaac C. Kidd, who was on board during the attack on Pearl Harbor, and was the first American flag officer to die in World War II. The ship is part of Destroyer Squadron 1 of Carrier Strike Group 1 which is currently headed by the nuclear-powered aircraft carrier USS Carl Vinson (CVN-70). USS &quot;Kidd&quot; is the only active ship in the Navy officially allowed to fly the Jolly Roger.

==Construction and career==

&quot;Kidd&quot; was christened by Admiral Kidd&#x27;s granddaughters, Regina Kidd Wolbarsht and Mary Kidd Plumer on 22 January 2005, at Ingalls Shipbuilding in Pascagoula, Mississippi. Commander Richard E. Thomas of Westwood, New Jersey, served as her first commanding officer until February 2008. Commander Charles P. Good of Huntington Beach, California, took &quot;Kidd&quot; on her maiden deployment.

While in the midst of final outfitting, the ship was holed and partially flooded at the shipyard docks during Hurricane Katrina on the Mississippi Gulf Coast, requiring a return to dry dock for repairs, which included cutting out a turbine, delaying her commissioning and deployment with the Navy. She was commissioned at Galveston, Texas on 9 June 2007. Kidd is currently homeported in Everett, Washington.

On 5 January 2012, &quot;Kidd&quot; rescued the 13-member crew of the Iranian-flagged fishing vessel &quot;Al Molai&quot; from Somali pirates who had been holding them hostage for over 40 days, capturing fifteen pirates in the process with no casualties.

===Search for Malaysia Airlines MH 370===

On 10 March 2014, the ship joined the search for Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 two days after it went missing over the South China Sea. &quot;Kidd&quot; was the second Navy ship to be deployed in the search. It joined , and more than 40 other ships and 32 aircraft from Malaysia, Australia, China, India, Thailand, Indonesia, Singapore, Taiwan, Vietnam, New Zealand, and the Philippines taking part in the search and rescue. On 14 March it was announced that &quot;Kidd&quot; would be relocated to the Indian Ocean in search of the plane, since new evidence pointed to the possibility of the plane being there.

===2020 COVID-19 pandemic===

On 24 April 2020, the United States Navy reported that a sailor assigned to &quot;Kidd&quot; had tested positive for the virus after being medically evacuated the previous day from operations at sea. After the sailor&#x27;s test returned positive, the Navy sent a medical team to the ship to conduct contact tracing and test sailors for the virus on board. By the morning of 24 April, 17 additional sailors tested positive, with additional cases expected as testing continued.

The initial patient was stable and recovering at a medical facility in San Antonio, Texas. It was planned for &quot;Kidd&quot; to return to port so that it could be disinfected. This was the second instance of the coronavirus being found aboard an American naval ship that had been deployed.

<text>Lincoln Ellsworth (May 12, 1880 – May 26, 1951) was an American polar explorer, engineer, surveyor, and author. He led the first Arctic and Antarctic air crossings.

==Early life==
Linn Ellsworth was born in Chicago, Illinois on May 12, 1880. His parents were Eva Frances (née Butler) and James Ellsworth, a wealthy coal mine owner and financier. He was named Linn after his uncle William Linn, but changed his name to Lincoln when he was a child.

His mother died in 1888. Ellsworth and his sister moved to Hudson, Ohio to live with his grandmother. He attended the Western Reserve Academy in Hudson and The Hill School in Pottstown, Pennsylvania. He took two years longer than usual to graduate, before entering the Sheffield Scientific School at Yale University. His academic performance was poor, and he subsequently enrolled at Columbia University School of Mines and studied civil engineering. He joined the fraternity of Delta Psi (St. Anthony Hall) at Yale in 1900 and Columbia in 1901. 

After dropping out of college in 1903, Ellsworth climbed the Andes with a fraternity brother. 

== Career ==
Ellsworth was a surveyor and engineer with a team conducting the first Canadian Grand Pacific Railroad survey from 1902 to 1907. He worked the winter of 1904 in his father&#x27;s coal mine. In 1905, he worked as an assistant engineer of a gold mine in Teller Alska. In 1906, he returned to his father&#x27;s coal mine, working as an engineer. He then worked as an engineer in Alaska and Canada from 1907 to 1924, including spending three years with the United States Biological Survey, gold prospecting along the Peace River, and working on a railroad over the Rocky Mountains in Alaska. 

During World War I, he served in the United States Army and trained as an aviator. Elsworth led the trans-Andean topographic survey from the Amazon River basin to the Pacific Ocean in Peru for Johns Hopkins University in 1924.

Ellsworth joined the first expedition to try to fly over the North Pole in 1925. His father spent US$100,000 ($ in ) to fund Roald Amundsen&#x27;s 1925 attempt to fly from Svalbard to the North Pole. Amundsen, accompanied by Lincoln Ellsworth, pilot Hjalmar Riiser-Larsen, flight mechanic Karl Feucht, and two other team members, set out in two Dornier Wal flying boats, the N24 and N25, in an attempted to reach the North Pole on May 21. When one airplane lost power, both made forced landings and, as a result, became separated. It took 3 days for the crews to regroup and 7 takeoff attempts before they could return N25 to the air 28 days later. Ellsworth senior died in Italy on June 2, 1925, while waiting for news of his lost son.

In early March 1926, under the headline &quot;Across the Pole by Dirigible&quot;, &quot;The New York Times&quot; announced the Amundsen-Ellsworth Expedition.
A long article in the same edition (by Fitzhugh Green, one of Byrd&#x27;s navy colleagues) was headed &quot;Massed Attack On Polar Region Begins Soon.&quot; Ellsworth accompanied Amundsen on his second effort to fly over the Pole in the airship Norge, designed and piloted by the Italian engineer Umberto Nobile, in a flight from Svalbard to Alaska. On May 12, the Geographic North Pole was sighted.

Ellsworth made four expeditions to Antarctica between 1933 and 1939 using as his aircraft transporter and base, a former Norwegian herring boat that he named &quot;Wyatt Earp&quot; after his hero. The aircraft, named &quot;Polar Star&quot;, was a Northrop Gamma outfitted with skis.

On November 23, 1935, Ellsworth discovered the Ellsworth Mountains of Antarctica when he made a trans-Antarctic flight from Dundee Island to the Ross Ice Shelf. He gave the descriptive name Sentinel Range, which was later named for the northern half of the Ellsworth Mountains. During the flight, his aircraft ran out of fuel, forcing a landing near the Little America camp established by Richard Byrd. Because of a faulty radio, he and his pilot, Herbert Hollick-Kenyon, were unable to notify authorities about the landing. The two men were declared missing, and the British research ship &quot;Discovery&quot; steamed out from Melbourne, Australia to search for them. The two men were discovered on January 16, 1936, after almost two months alone at Little America. They returned to New York City on April 6, and their support ship, the MS Wyatt Earp, arrived separately two weeks later.

==Honors==
Ellsworth received honorary degrees from Yale University and Kenyon College. In 1927, the Boy Scouts of America made Lincoln Ellsworth an &quot;Honorary Scout&quot;, a new category of Scout created that same year. This distinction was given to &quot;American citizens whose achievements in outdoor activity, exploration, and worthwhile adventure are of such an exceptional character as to capture the imagination of boys...&quot; &quot;The Boy Scout&#x27;s Book of True Adventure, Fourteen Honorary Scouts,&quot; includes an essay &quot;The First Crossing of the Polar Sea&quot; by Lincoln Ellsworth. 

In 1928, Ellsworth was awarded a Congressional Gold Medal that honored both his 1925 and 1926 polar flights. He received the Hubbard Gold Medal from the National Geographic Society in 1936 for his Antarctic expedition and aerial survey. He received a second Congressional Gold Medal in 1936 for &quot;his claims on behalf of the United States of approximately 350,000 square miles in Antarctica and for his 2,500-mile aerial survey of the heart of
Antarctica.&quot; In 1937, he was awarded the Patron&#x27;s Medal of the Royal Geographical Society for his improvements in the technique of polar aerial navigation.

The American Museum of Natural History created the Lincoln Ellsworth exhibit about his Arctic and Antarctic voyages in 1933; it remains open to the public as of 2024. The former Antarctic base Ellsworth Station was named after him. Ellsworth Land, Mount Ellsworth, and Lake Ellsworth, all in Antarctica, are all named for Lincoln Ellsworth. The United States Postal Service issued a commemorative stamp in his honor in 1988. In 1919, the high school athletic teams of Hudson High School in Hudson, Ohio, were nicknamed &quot;The Explorers&quot; after Ellsworth. Hudson’s Ellsworth Hill Elementary is also named after him. 

==Personal life==
On May 23, 1933, Ellsworth married naturalist and historical Mary Louise Ulmer of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. The couple met while taking flying lessons in Switzerland. They had no children. They lived at 35 East 76th Street in New York City and in the Schloss Lenzburg castle in Switzerland, bequeathed to Ellsworth by his father.

He was a trustee of the American Museum of Natural History and was also a major benefactor of the museum. He also served on the board of trustees of Western Reserve Academy from 1926 to 1951. 

Ellsworth died of heart failure at his home in New York City on May 26, 1951, at the age of 71. He was buried in Hudson, Ohio.

<text>In computer-based language recognition, ANTLR (pronounced &quot;antler&quot;), or ANother Tool for Language Recognition, is a parser generator that uses a LL(*) algorithm for parsing. ANTLR is the successor to the Purdue Compiler Construction Tool Set (PCCTS), first developed in 1989, and is under active development. Its maintainer is Professor Terence Parr of the University of San Francisco.

PCCTS 1.00 was announced April 10, 1992.

==Usage==
ANTLR takes as input a grammar that specifies a language and generates as output source code for a recognizer of that language. 
While Version 3 supported generating code in the programming languages 
Ada95, 
ActionScript, 
C, 
C#, 
Java, 
JavaScript, 
Objective-C, 
Perl, 
Python, 
Ruby, and Standard ML, Version 4 at present targets 
C#,
C++,
Dart,
Java, 
JavaScript, 
Go,
PHP,
Python (2 and 3), 
and Swift.

A language is specified using a context-free grammar expressed using Extended Backus–Naur Form (EBNF).
ANTLR can generate lexers, parsers, tree parsers, and combined lexer-parsers. Parsers can automatically generate parse trees or abstract syntax trees, which can be further processed with tree parsers. ANTLR provides a single consistent notation for specifying lexers, parsers, and tree parsers.

By default, ANTLR reads a grammar and generates a recognizer for the language defined by the grammar (i.e., a program that reads an input stream and generates an error if the input stream does not conform to the syntax specified by the grammar). If there are no syntax errors, the default action is to simply exit without printing any message. In order to do something useful with the language, actions can be attached to grammar elements in the grammar. These actions are written in the programming language in which the recognizer is being generated. When the recognizer is being generated, the actions are embedded in the source code of the recognizer at the appropriate points. Actions can be used to build and check symbol tables and to emit instructions in a target language, in the case of a compiler.

Other than lexers and parsers, ANTLR can be used to generate tree parsers. These are recognizers that process abstract syntax trees, which can be automatically generated by parsers. These tree parsers are unique to ANTLR and help processing abstract syntax trees.

==Licensing==
 and ANTLR 4 are free software, published under a three-clause BSD License. Prior versions were released as public domain software. Documentation, derived from Parr&#x27;s book &quot;The Definitive ANTLR 4 Reference&quot;, is included with the BSD-licensed ANTLR 4 source.

Various plugins have been developed for the Eclipse development environment to support the ANTLR grammar, including ANTLR Studio, a proprietary product, as well as the &quot;ANTLR 2&quot; and &quot;ANTLR 3&quot; plugins for Eclipse hosted on SourceForge.

== ANTLR 4 ==
ANTLR 4 deals with direct left recursion correctly, but not with left recursion in general, i.e., grammar rules &quot;x&quot; that refer to &quot;y&quot; that refer to &quot;x&quot;.

=== Development ===
As reported on the tools page of the ANTLR project, plug-ins that enable features like syntax highlighting, syntax error checking and code completion are freely available for the most common IDEs (Intellij IDEA, NetBeans, Eclipse, Visual Studio and Visual Studio Code).

== Projects ==
Software built using ANTLR includes:

* Groovy
* Jython
* Hibernate
* OpenJDK Compiler Grammar project experimental version of the javac compiler based upon a grammar written in ANTLR
* Apex, Salesforce.com&#x27;s programming language
* The expression evaluator in Numbers, Apple&#x27;s spreadsheet
* Twitter&#x27;s search query language
* Weblogic server
* Apache Cassandra
* Processing
* JabRef
* Trino (SQL query engine)
* Presto (SQL query engine)
* MySQL Workbench

Over 200 grammars implemented in ANTLR 4 are available on GitHub. They range from grammars for a URL to grammars for entire languages like C, Java and Go.

== Example ==
In the following example, a parser in ANTLR describes the sum of expressions can be seen in the form of &quot;1 + 2 + 3&quot;:

 // Common options, for example, the target language
 options
 language = &quot;CSharp&quot;;
 // Followed by the parser 
 class SumParser extends Parser;
 options
 k = 1; // Parser Lookahead: 1 Token
 // Definition of an expression
 statement: INTEGER (PLUS^ INTEGER)*;
 // Here is the Lexer
 class SumLexer extends Lexer;
 options
 k = 1; // Lexer Lookahead: 1 characters
 PLUS: &#x27;+&#x27;;
 DIGIT: (&#x27;0&#x27;..&#x27;9&#x27;);
 INTEGER: (DIGIT)+;

The following listing demonstrates the call of the parser in a program:

 TextReader reader;
 // (...) Fill TextReader with character
 SumLexer lexer = new SumLexer(reader);
 SumParser parser = new SumParser(lexer);

 parser.statement();

<text>The Stillaguamish River is a river in the northwestern region of the U.S. state of Washington. It is mainly composed of two forks, the longer North Fork Stillaguamish () and the South Fork Stillaguamish. The two forks join near Arlington. From there the Stillaguamish River proper flows for to Puget Sound. The river&#x27;s watershed drains part of the Cascade Range north of Seattle.

== Name ==
The Stillaguamish River&#x27;s name is derived from the Stillaguamish people, the Lushootseed-speaking people who had several villages along the river&#x27;s course. Their name, Stillaguamish, is derived from their Lushootseed endonym, , meaning &quot;river people.&quot;

Variant spellings of the Stillaguamish River, according to the USGS, include Stoh-luk-whahmpsh River, Steilaguamish River, and Stalukahamish River.

==Course==

The Stillaguamish River is formed from the confluence of the North and South Forks, both of which rise in the Cascades. Between the North and South forks there is a portion of the Mount Baker-Snoqualmie National Forest called the Boulder River Wilderness.

The North Fork rises as several branches in a remote area of Skagit County near Finney Peak, approximately north of Darrington. Collecting many tributary creeks, the river flows south, then west through the foothills along the Skagit-Snohomish county line. Tributaries of the North Fork Stillaguamish River include Boulder River and Deer Creek.

The South Fork () originates from the northern slopes of Del Campo Peak and Morning Star Peak in central Snohomish County, south of Darrington, and flows west and northwest by Silverton, Verlot, and Granite Falls.

The two forks unite at Arlington in northwestern Snohomish County. The combined stream flows west before it briefly splits again to encircle the town of Silvana.

The Stillaguamish bifurcates at its delta to form Florence Island before entering Puget Sound. Hatt Slough flows southwest and is now the primary distributary of the Stillaguamish waters into Port Susan, having been diverted in the early twentieth century. The Old Stillaguamish River Channel flows northwest towards Florence and then Stanwood on an 8-mile meandering course. Near the Camano Island bridge this channel again splits, forming Leque Island, with the South Pass flowing into Port Susan and the West Pass emptying into the southern end of Skagit Bay.

==Natural history==
The Stillaguamish River and its tributaries are known for their salmon runs. Eight salmonid species use the streams for spawning, including Chinook, coho, chum, pink, and sockeye salmon, steelhead trout, sea-run cutthroat, and bull trout.

==Hydrology==
The north fork of the Stillaguamish river level is monitored by gauges operated by the United States Geological Survey (USGS), and river levels can vary by as much as . The river level rises and falls very quickly, with the average north fork flood duration of eight hours. Of the five highest north fork flood levels on record, three have occurred since 2009.

==History==
The Stillaguamish River is the center of Stillaguamish territory. For centuries, the Stillaguamish have fished and hunted and gathered all along its extent. The Stillaguamish had at least ten villages along its course, from its mouth to as far upriver as Hazel and Mt. Higgins (). Other Indigenous peoples historically traveled to the Stillaguamish River to fish as well, including the Sauk, the Snohomish, and the Duwamish.

The 2014 Oso landslide occurred on the North Fork of the Stillaguamish.

On December 5, 2023, the river crested at near Arlington and set a new record amid regional floods.

<doc id="765596" wikidata="Q64513" url="?curid=765596" title="Carsten Peter Thiede">
<text>Carsten Peter Thiede OCF KStJ (8 August 1952 – 14 December 2004) was a German archaeologist and New Testament scholar. He was also a member of PEN and appointed a Knight of Justice of the Order of St John. He taught as professor of New Testament times and history at the Staatsunabhängige Theologische Hochschule (STH) in Basel and at the Ben-Gurion University of the Negev in Beersheba, Israel. He often advanced theories that conflicted with the consensus of academic and theological scholarship.

== Early life and career ==
Born in West Berlin, Thiede studied comparative literature and history there before procuring a German National Scholarship Foundation Research Fellow position at Queen&#x27;s College at Oxford University in 1976, where he attained a Blue for volleyball, which he had played in the German Volleyball Premier League.
In 1978, he became a senior lecturer in comparative literature at Geneva, where he drew inspiration from his fellow &quot;comparativist&quot;, George Steiner. Drawn to the subject of early Christianity because of his background as a linguist and his expertise in medieval Latin philology, the study of the origins of Christianity came to form his life&#x27;s work.

For a number of years into the early &#x27;90s Thiede worked with various broadcasting companies, including BBC Radio and ERF, and as an editor at the Brockhaus publishing company. 

== New Testament work ==
Thiede was best known for his interpretation of some of the Greek Dead Sea Scrolls fragments, including the identification of the small 7Q5 papyrus fragment (&quot;illustration&quot;) as a fragment of the &quot;Gospel of Mark&quot;. He supported O’Callaghan’s controversial claims that several papyrus fragments from Qumran Cave 7 are actually Christian New Testament texts from pre AD 70.

In December 1994, Thiede redated the Magdalen papyrus together with former deputy editor of The Sunday Telegraph and later editor of The Spectator, Matthew d&#x27;Ancona, which bears a fragment in Greek of the &quot;Gospel of Matthew,&quot; to the latter part of the 1st century on palaeographical grounds; this too provoked much debate and was highly publicised, most notably with a front-page headline in The Times. By attempting to make his material more accessible to the general public he was often accused of being a popular science writer.

Carsten Thiede initially wrote an article in the academically peer-reviewed &quot;Zeitschrift für Papyrologie&quot; in regards to his dating of the papyrus to the last third of the first century. He improved upon his research and published the results in his book titled &quot;Eyewitness to Jesus&quot; in 1996. Thiede was able to date the Magdalen papyrus containing a portion of Matthew&#x27;s Gospel to 66 CE using more advanced papyrological techniques and comparative analysis with a document dated to 66 CE (P. Oxy 246 II).

In &quot;The Quest for the True Cross&quot;, also co-written with d&#x27;Ancona, Thiede argued that the Titulus Crucis could in fact be part of Jesus&#x27; cross, based on his palaeographic study of the writing, though it is considered to be a medieval forgery by many scholars. Thiede is particularly noted for his research into early Christianity, notably Peter and Paul.

For the last seven years of his life, Thiede also worked for the Israel Antiquities Authority repairing damage to the Dead Sea Scrolls and excavating the biblical location of Emmaus. A devout Anglican who was ordained priest in 2000, he was also Chaplain to Her Majesty&#x27;s Forces despite being a German citizen. He died in Paderborn suddenly at the age of 52 from a heart attack.

<text>The Nisqually River is a river in west central Washington in the United States, approximately long. It drains part of the Cascade Range southeast of Tacoma, including the southern slope of Mount Rainier, and empties into the southern end of Puget Sound. Its outlet was designated in 1971 as the Nisqually Delta National Natural Landmark.

The Nisqually River forms the Pierce–Lewis county line, as well as the boundary between Pierce and Thurston counties.

==Course==
The river rises in southern Mount Rainier National Park, fed by the Nisqually Glacier on the southern side of Mt. Rainier. It flows west through Ashford and Elbe along Route 706. It is then impounded for hydroelectricity by the Alder Dam, completed in 1944, and the LaGrande Dam, completed in 1912 and rebuilt in 1945. They hold back Alder Lake and the inaccessible two-mile long LaGrande Reservoir. Before the construction of the dams, a natural fish barrier prevented anadromous fish from ascending the Nisqually above what is now La Grande Reservoir.

Below Elbe, the river flows northwest through the foothills, passes near McKenna, Washington, and through Fort Lewis and the Nisqually Indian Reservation. The river crosses beneath Interstate 5 and into the Nisqually River Delta, which is the location of the Nisqually National Wildlife Refuge. The delta as a whole, including federal, state, and private land, was designated in 1971 as a National Natural Landmark. The Nisqually enters the Nisqually Reach portion of Puget Sound approximately east of Olympia.

== History ==
The Nisqually River is the traditional territorial center of the Nisqually tribe, for which it was named, though they also lived throughout southern Puget Sound. The Treaty of Medicine Creek, one of the major Northwest treaties between Washington territory and the native population of Puget Sound, was signed near a creek at the delta of the Nisqually River. The Nisqually people were moved from the region surrounding the river after the signing of the treaty, settling on a reservation on Puget Sound east of Olympia. After a period of resistance by the Nisqually tribe, including such leaders as Chief Leschi, a new reservation three times the size of the original was established on the river. In 1917, the US Army occupied the Nisqually reservation, ordered people from their homes, and later condemned most of the reservation to build Fort Lewis.

Several bridges were built across the Nisqually River in the 20th century for automobile traffic. The northbound bridge that carries Interstate 5 near the river&#x27;s mouth was opened in 1938 for U.S. Route 99 and was followed by a southbound span in 1968. The bridges use a filled causeway to cross the delta that altered the river&#x27;s course and contributed to increased flood risks in the basin. A replacement for the causeway is estimated to cost $4.2 billion.

In the 1960s and 1970s, the Nisqually pursued their fishing rights along the river, which were stated in the Treaty of Medicine Creek but had been ignored. Nisqually tribal members, acting in concert with the nearby Puyallup tribe, endured harassment and arrest to fish in traditional waters. This led to the 1974 Boldt Decision, also known as, U.S. V. Washington 1974, which affirmed the rights of several native tribes in Washington to harvest up to 50% of the return of salmon run within their traditional territories.

==Ecology==
&quot;Nisqually-1&quot;, a specimen of &quot;Populus trichocarpa&quot;, grew on the bank of the Nisqually River. Its genome sequence was published in 2006.

<text>USS &quot;Sampson&quot; (DDG-102) is 52nd &quot;Arleigh Burke-class&quot; (Flight IIA) Aegis guided missile destroyer in the United States Navy. Funding for the Flight IIA (5&quot;/62, one 20mm CIWS variant) ship was authorized in 2002 and her keel was laid on 20 March 2005. She is the fourth US Navy ship named to honor Rear Admiral William T. Sampson.

She was built by Bath Iron Works in Bath, Maine. At her christening on 16 September 2006, the principal address was delivered by Senator Susan Collins of Maine, and the vessel was christened by Clara Parsons, great-granddaughter of Rear Admiral Sampson and daughter of William Sterling Parsons, as the ship&#x27;s sponsor.

==History==
She was commissioned in Boston, Massachusetts on 3 November 2007 and home ported in San Diego. Her maiden deployment was from August 2009 to March 2010 to the Western Pacific and Persian Gulf as part of the carrier strike group (CSG).

After &quot;Sampson&quot; returned from an 8-month maiden deployment, she was back underway from May to August with port visits to the 103rd Portland Rose Festival and Esquimalt, British Columbia to celebrate the 100th anniversary of the Royal Canadian Navy. She then participated in Exercise RIMPAC off the coast of Hawaii. &quot;Sampson&quot;″s crew was awarded two Sea Service Ribbons in 12 months.

In August 2011 &quot;Sampson&quot; pulled into South Harbor in Seattle, Washington, to participate in Seattle&#x27;s Seafair celebration. In September, &quot;Sampson&quot; dispatched an inflatable boat and swimmers to retrieve about 60 bales of assorted drugs from the ocean after a small boat dumped them overboard. After that the ship participated in &#x27;s Composite Training Unit Exercise (COMPTUEX), in preparation for an independent deployment. In February 2012 &quot;Sampson&quot; departed San Diego for a scheduled deployment to the western Pacific and Middle East. In July, &quot;Sampson&quot; participated in at-sea phase of Cooperation Afloat Readiness and Training (CARAT) Singapore.

On 29 December 2014, &quot;Sampson&quot; was dispatched to the Java Sea to search for Indonesia AirAsia Flight 8501 that disappeared the day before.

In 2016 the ship remained assigned to Destroyer Squadron 23, working with Carrier Strike Group 11. She arrived at her new homeport, Naval Station Everett in Washington, on 26 September 2016.

The Royal New Zealand Navy (RNZN) invited the United States Navy to send a vessel to participate in the RNZN&#x27;s 75th Birthday Celebrations in Auckland over the weekend of 19–21 November 2016. &quot;Sampson&quot; was the first US warship to visit New Zealand in 33 years since the New Zealand nuclear-free zone came into effect and the US suspended its obligations to New Zealand under the ANZUS treaty. New Zealand Prime Minister John Key granted approval for the ship&#x27;s visit under the New Zealand&#x27;s anti-nuclear law, which requires that the Prime Minister has to be satisfied that any visiting ship is not nuclear armed or powered. Soon after arriving in New Zealand, a magnitude 7.8 earthquake struck Kaikōura. &quot;Sampson&quot; along with other navy ships from Australia, Canada, Japan and Singapore were dispatched directly to the area to provide humanitarian assistance.

On 3 October 2017, &quot;Sampson&quot; departed her homeport for a scheduled deployment with the CSG. She returned 9 May 2018 after seven months.

In January 2022, &quot;Sampson&quot; responded to Tonga to provide assistance following the Hunga Tonga–Hunga Ha&#x27;apai eruption and tsunami.

In May 2022, &quot;Sampson&quot; was a part of Destroyer Squadron 2, along with Carrier Strike Group 3 led by the .

&quot;Sampson&quot; participated in RIMPAC 2022.

<text>USS &quot;Truxtun&quot; (DDG-103) is the 53rd &quot;Arleigh Burke-class&quot; (Flight IIA) Aegis guided missile destroyer currently in service with the United States Navy. She is named for American Naval hero, Commodore Thomas Truxtun (1755–1822), one of the first six commanders appointed by George Washington, to the newly formed U.S. Navy. She is the sixth U.S. naval warship to bear his name.

==Construction==
&quot;Truxtun&quot;″s keel was laid down on 11 April 2005. During construction at Ingalls Shipbuilding, Pascagoula, Mississippi, she suffered a major electrical fire on 20 May 2006, engulfing two levels and causing damage estimated to be worth millions of dollars. She was launched on 17 April 2007, then christened on 2 June 2007, in Pascagoula, with Truxtun&#x27;s descendants, Susan Scott Martin and Carol Leigh Roelker, serving as sponsors, and commissioned on 25 April 2009, in Charleston, South Carolina. the ship is part of Destroyer Squadron 26 based out of Naval Station Norfolk.

==Ship history==
In 2012, the US Navy contracted with L3 Technologies to develop a fuel-efficient hybrid electric drive train for the Flight IIA Arleigh Burke guided missile destroyers. The system proposed used a pre-existing quill drive on the reduction gearbox, allowing an electric motor to drive the ships up to . &quot;Truxtun&quot; was fitted with the permanent magnet motor system in 2012, under a research and development contract with General Atomics. In March 2018, the US Navy announced that the trial program to install hybrid electric drives in 34 destroyers would be cancelled leaving &quot;Truxtun&quot; as the only ship so fitted.

In March 2014, &quot;Truxtun&quot; sailed to the Black Sea, to conduct training with the Romanian and Bulgarian navies. The deployment of &quot;Truxtun&quot;, along with sister ship , to the Black Sea, was intended as a &quot;strategic reassurance&quot; for former Soviet republics and satellite states concerned about the annexation of Crimea by the Russian Federation

On 10 August 2020, &quot;Truxtun&quot; completed a deployment with the Carrier Strike Group, without any port calls, that lasted for almost seven months.

At a Pentagon press briefing on 24 April 2023, a spokesperson stated that &quot;Truxtun&quot; was &quot;... off the coast of Sudan, near the Port of Sudan. It will stay there awaiting further orders should it be needed to support. Also, en route is the &quot;.

On June 12th, 2024, USS Truxtun along with the USS Donald Cook, USS Delbert D. Black, Coast Guard Cutter, the Stone, and a Boeing P-8 maritime patrol aircraft were deployed to track a Russian naval flotilla sailing less than 30 miles off the coast of Key Largo, Florida. The flotilla was expected to arrive the same day in Havana, Cuba for naval and air exercises.

==In popular culture==
&quot;Truxtun&quot; was seen in the feature film &quot;Captain Phillips&quot;, standing in for .

<text>USS &quot;Dewey&quot; (DDG-105) is the 55th &quot;Arleigh Burke-class&quot; (Flight IIA) Aegis guided missile destroyer in the United States Navy. &quot;Dewey&quot; is the third Navy ship named after Admiral of the Navy George Dewey, hero of the Battle of Manila Bay during the Spanish–American War.

The ship is part of Destroyer Squadron 1 of Carrier Strike Group One of which the flagship is aircraft carrier .

==History==

She was authorized on 13 September 2002 and was built by Northrop Grumman Ship Systems. The keel was laid down on 4 October 2006 at the company&#x27;s shipyard in Pascagoula, Mississippi. On 26 January 2008, &quot;Dewey&quot; was christened in a ceremony in Pascagoula, by Deborah Mullen, the wife of Admiral Mike Mullen. &quot;Dewey&quot; was commissioned in Seal Beach, California on 6 March 2010, as the 55th &quot;Arleigh Burke&quot;-class destroyer. This is the first ship commissioning for the City of Seal Beach.
In April 2013, &quot;Dewey&quot; was outfitted with a Laser Weapon System (LaWS). This is an experimental weapon which can be used to disable small boats and drones.

On 26 May 2017, &quot;Dewey&quot; carried out a &quot;freedom of navigation operation&quot; (FONOP) in waters claimed by China in the South China Sea. According to Chinese sources, &quot;Dewey&quot; was &quot;warned and expelled&quot; from Chinese waters near the Nansha Islands in the South China Sea. According to the US Navy, the FONOP proceeded as planned by peacefully transiting the area, despite verbal challenges and approaches by Chinese vessels.

On 16 June 2017, &quot;Dewey&quot; got underway to assist after a collision with the Japanese-owned (NYK Line) Philippine-flagged container ship . On 4 September 2017, she deployed to the Port of Los Angeles as part of the 2017 fleet week activities. In October 2017, &quot;Dewey&quot; spilled oil near the Tijuana River.

In early 2020 the Optical Dazzling Interdictor laser weapon was installed on &quot;Dewey&quot;. She was the first ship to receive the new weapons system.

The ship participated in Exercise Malabar 2024 which was held from 8 to 18 October.

<text>John Garibaldi Sargent (October 13, 1860March 5, 1939) was an American lawyer and government official. He served as United States Attorney General during the administration of President Calvin Coolidge.

==Biography==
John G. Sargent was born in Ludlow, Vermont on October 13, 1860, the son of John Henmon Sargent and Ann Eliza Hanley. He graduated from Black River Academy, and received his Bachelor of Arts degree from Tufts College in 1887. Sargent was married to the former Mary Lorraine Gordon on August 4, 1887. They had a daughter, Gladys Gordon Sargent.

Sargent studied law at a firm in Ludlow, was admitted to the bar in 1890, and became a partner in the firm of William W. Stickney, a cousin of Calvin Coolidge. Among the prospective attorneys who studied under Sargent and Stickney were Julius A. Willcox, who later served as an associate justice of the Vermont Supreme Court, and Joseph F. Radigan, who served as Vermont&#x27;s United States Attorney from 1961 to 1969.

In addition to practicing law, Sargent was active in the insurance business, served as President of the Ludlow Savings Bank, and was a member of the board of directors of several railroads and other corporations.

A Republican, he served as Windsor County State&#x27;s Attorney from 1898 to 1900. Sargent was Secretary of Civil and Military Affairs (chief assistant) for Stickney during Stickney&#x27;s term as Governor of Vermont from 1900 to 1902.

From 1908 to 1912 Sargent was Vermont Attorney General. In 1912, Sargent received an honorary master&#x27;s degree from Tufts.

In 1925, President Coolidge&#x27;s nominee for Attorney General, Charles B. Warren, was rejected by the United States Senate. Coolidge then nominated Sargent, whom he had known since childhood. Sargent was confirmed unanimously, and served until March 4, 1929.

After leaving office, Sargent returned to practicing law; he brought into the firm as a partner Paul A. Chase, who had served as his special assistant while he was U.S. Attorney General. He was also Chairman of the Vermont Commission on Uniform State Laws, and a trustee of the Black River Academy.

Sargent died in Ludlow on March 5, 1939, and was buried at the Pleasant View Cemetery in Ludlow, Vermont.

John G. Sargent&#x27;s honors included honorary LL.D. degrees from Tufts, Norwich University, Middlebury College, and Dartmouth College.

<doc id="765613" wikidata="Q3115864" url="?curid=765613" title="Grays River (Washington)">
<text>Grays River is a tributary of the Columbia River, approximately long, in southwestern Washington in the United States. One of the last tributaries of the Columbia on the Washington side, it drains an area of low hills north of the mouth of the river.

==Course==
Grays River rises in the eastern Willapa Hills in Washington state&#x27;s southwestern Pacific County. It flows generally southwesterly across western Wahkiakum County. The river has three fork tributaries, the East Fork, South Fork, and West Fork Grays River. Below the West Fork confluence the main river valley broadens. Washington State Route 4 passes through the valley and the communities of Grays River and Rosburg. Fossil Creek joins Grays River above the highway and villages. Hull Creek joins from the north after passing through the village of Grays River. Roughly southwest of the village of Grays River, the river enters the broad portion of the Columbia River&#x27;s tidal estuary from the north, at Grays Bay, about upstream from the Columbia&#x27;s mouth. Grays River becomes tidal at the village of Grays River. In its lower course, especially below Rosburg, the river broadens due to the influence of tides.

The hills and ridges that separate Grays River&#x27;s watershed from other watersheds is called the Grays River Divide. Rivers whose watersheds lie across the Grays River Divide include the Elochoman River, Chehalis River, Willapa River, and Naselle River. The short Deep River lies just west of Grays River and, like Grays River, empties into Grays Bay.

==History==
In 1841 Charles Wilkes of the United States Exploring Expedition charted the river, calling it &quot;Ebokwol&quot;. In 1853 it was given another Indian name, &quot;Moolhool&quot;, the name used by the Chinookan-speaking natives of the area.

The American fur trader Robert Gray, captain of the &quot;Columbia Rediviva&quot;, entered the mouth of the Columbia River in May 1792. Gray and his crew were the first non-indigenous people to do so. After a few days of exploring and trading the &quot;Columbia Rediviva&quot; ran aground briefly on a sandbar in what is now known as Grays Bay. A boat scouted ahead and determined that the channel Gray they been following on the north side of the Columbia quickly became unnavigable. Gray decided not to venture farther upriver, instead anchoring in Grays Bay for several days, trading and refitting the ship. Gray went ashore and later made a chart of Grays Bay and the mouth of Grays River. A copy of the chart was given to George Vancouver. In October 1792 Vancouver&#x27;s lieutenant, William Broughton entered and explored the Columbia River. It was Broughton, who had a copy of Gray&#x27;s chart, who named Grays Bay and Grays River after Robert Gray.

In the early 1900s, steamboat service from Grays River to Astoria was provided by the Callendar Navigation Company.

At the community of Grays River it is crossed by the Grays River Covered Bridge. The bridge is listed on the National Register of Historic Places and is one of the only covered bridges still in use in Washington (the Cedar Creek Grist Mill east of Woodland, WA also has a covered bridge still in use by dozens of vehicles daily).

==Natural history==
Grays River supports populations of coho salmon, sea-run coastal cutthroat trout, and winter-run steelhead. While the river&#x27;s coho numbers are fairly low—about one hundred per year—and the cutthroat numbers are low, the steelhead are a draw for sport fishing. In addition Sturgeon are present just off the river&#x27;s mouth in Grays Bay.

Estimates of historical fish populations range from 1,500-10,000 chinook salmon, 8,000-14,000 chum salmon, and 5,000-40,000 coho salmon. Currently the number of natural spawning returns is 100-300 chinook and 500-10,000 chum. Current natural coho salmon return numbers are not known but are assumed to be low.

The fish draw sea lions to the river during the migration seasons.

==Recreation==
Grays River is a popular destination for whitewater rafting and kayaking.

<text>Jasmin Wagner (; born April 20, 1980), better known as Blümchen (), is a German pop and dance music singer. While she releases her English-language albums under the name Blossom, her German stage name, , translates to &quot;floret&quot; or &quot;small flower.&quot;

==Early life==
Born in Hamburg, West Germany, to a German father and a Croatian mother, she began performing as a cheerleader for the Hamburg Blue Angels, a squad affiliated with the Hamburg Blue Devils American football team.

== Career ==

===1995–1996: Career beginnings and &quot;Herzfrequenz&quot;===
In 1995, at the age of 15, she began her musical career under the name Blümchen. She became the most successful German female singer of the 1990s. She also released singles and albums in other German-speaking countries, Scandinavia, and Asia.

Her debut studio album, &quot;Herzfrequenz&quot;, was released in 1996, following the success of the chart hit &quot;Herz an Herz,&quot; a cover of a Paso Doble song. This was followed by the singles &quot;Kleiner Satellit (Piep, Piep)&quot;, &quot;Boomerang&quot;, and &quot;Du und ich,&quot; all of which became chart successes. In 1996, Wagner released her first English-language single, a cover of the Queen song &quot;Bicycle Race,&quot; which was the only single released under both the names Blümchen and Blossom. This release paved the way for her international career as Blossom, including the studio album &quot;Heartbeat&quot;, the English counterpart to &quot;Herzfrequenz&quot;. The album featured English versions of &quot;Herz an Herz&quot; and &quot;Du und ich,&quot; released as the singles &quot;Heart to Heart&quot; and &quot;You and Me,&quot; respectively. &quot;Bicycle Race&quot; was also included on the Queen tribute compilation album &quot;Queen Dance Traxx I,&quot; which featured an ensemble cast song credited as Acts United, &quot;We Are the Champions.&quot;

===1997–1998: &quot;Verliebt...&quot; and &quot;Jasmin&quot;===
In 1997, Wagner released her second studio album, &quot;Verliebt...&quot;, along with its English-language counterpart, &quot;In Love...&quot;, under the name Blossom. Singles from &quot;Verliebt...&quot; included the Nena cover &quot;Nur geträumt,&quot; &quot;Verrückte Jungs,&quot; and &quot;Gib mir noch Zeit&quot; (released as &quot;Just a Dream&quot; and &quot;Give Me More Time&quot; as Blossom). Later, the album &quot;Verliebt...&quot; was reissued under the subtitle &quot;Die Fanedition&quot; with reworked cover art, a bonus medley, and a new song, the single &quot;Sesam-Jam (der, die, das),&quot; which sampled the German version of the Sesame Street theme.

In 1998, Wagner released her eponymous third studio album, &quot;Jasmin,&quot; which featured the singles &quot;Blaue Augen,&quot; the Ideal cover &quot;Ich bin wieder hier&quot; (a Rozalla cover), and &quot;Es ist vorbei.&quot; The album marked a shift from her earlier happy hardcore style to a more pop and dance-oriented sound. That same year, she contributed to the charity single &quot;Let the Music Heal Your Soul&quot; as part of the supergroup Bravo All Stars.

===1999–2000: &quot;Live in Berlin&quot; and &quot;Die Welt gehört dir&quot;===
In 1999, the album &quot;Jasmin&quot; was re-released with updated cover art and two additional songs: the singles &quot;Heut&#x27; ist mein Tag&quot; and &quot;Tu es mon île,&quot; a French-language version of &quot;Du bist die Insel,&quot; which had originally appeared on the &quot;Verliebt...&quot; album. That same year, Wagner released her first and only live album, &quot;Live in Berlin,&quot; which included a previously unreleased track, the Christmas single &quot;Unter&#x27;m Weihnachtsbaum.&quot;

In 2000, Wagner released her fourth studio album, &quot;Die Welt gehört dir,&quot; featuring the singles &quot;Ist deine Liebe echt?,&quot; &quot;Die Welt gehört mir,&quot; and &quot;Ich vermisse dich.&quot; The latter served as her farewell single as Blümchen, marking the conclusion of this chapter in her career.

===2001–2002: &quot;Für immer und ewig&quot; and films===
Before Wagner retired the Blümchen moniker, the greatest hits compilation album &quot;Für immer und ewig&quot; was released, featuring a previously unreleased song, the promotional single &quot;Es ist nie vorbei,&quot; which included a collaboration with Swedish artist E-Type. Wagner also participated in the 2001 charity single &quot;Die Stadt mit der Nase im Wind&quot; as part of the supergroup Hamburg Allstars. 

In the same year, she appeared on the Norwegian rock band Turbonegro&#x27;s tribute album, &quot;Alpha Motherfuckers&quot;, performing the song &quot;Are You Ready for Some Darkness&quot; alongside Die Ärzte member Bela B.. For this project, which marked a significant shift from her electronic sound to an independent rock style, Wagner adopted the stage name Denim Girl for the first and only time.

Later that year, Wagner released her first and only promotional single under the mononym Jasmin, a cover of &quot;Santa Claus Is Comin&#x27; to Town,&quot; originally performed by Eddie Cantor. This Christmas song was exclusively available at Tchibo stores. 

Wagner also ventured into acting, making cameo appearances in several films, most notably as a race car fan in the 2001 movie &quot;Driven&quot;, starring Sylvester Stallone.

===2003–2007: Singles and &quot;Die Versuchung&quot;===

After a brief hiatus from the music industry, Wagner returned in 2003 with a new record deal on Polydor under her real name, Jasmin Wagner, releasing the single &quot;Leb deinen Traum&quot; for her upcoming fifth studio album. The song achieved moderate success, peaking at #24 on the German Singles Chart, and served as the theme song for the talent show &quot;Popstars – Das Duell&quot;. For her transition to a more mature pop-rock sound, Wagner collaborated with notable German artists and songwriters, including Inga Humpe, Peter Plate, and Uwe Fahrenkrog-Petersen. In 2004, she followed up with the single &quot;Helden wie wir,&quot; written by Plate. 

That same year, Wagner performed these singles along with other new tracks, such as &quot;Erster Tag,&quot; &quot;Sonne in mir,&quot; &quot;Schmetterling,&quot; &quot;Lieblingslied,&quot; and &quot;Hellwach,&quot; at the Happy Family event in Mannheim. Additional songs she presented included &quot;Wann wenn nicht jetzt,&quot; &quot;Frei,&quot; and &quot;Das Meer ruft meinen Namen&quot; at a concert in Oldenburg. However, after delays in the album&#x27;s release and dissatisfaction with its direction, Wagner ultimately decided to cancel her untitled studio album. Despite this, the studio recording of &quot;Schmetterling&quot; was leaked online. 

In 2004, Wagner appeared on several compilation albums, including &quot;Best of Mania&quot; with the Olivia Newton-John cover &quot;Hopelessly Devoted to You&quot; and &quot;Your Stars for Christmas&quot; with &quot;[[Soleado|Der kleine Stern],&quot; a German-language [[Ciro Dammicco]] cover of &quot;[[Soleado]].&quot; Additionally, she performed the title song &quot;The Love of My Life&quot; for the motion picture soundtrack of &quot;7 Zwerge – Männer allein im Wald&quot;. 

In 2005, still signed with Polydor, Wagner released her first and only studio album as Jasmin Wagner, &quot;[[Die Versuchung]].&quot; The album showcased a chanson, swing, and retro 1960s pop sound. It included the single &quot;Männer brauchen Liebe&quot; and the double A-side single &quot;Komm schon werd&#x27; wütend&quot; and &quot;Morgen, wenn ich weg bin.&quot; Despite its artistic ambition, the album was commercially unsuccessful, remaining on the German Album Charts for only five weeks, leading to Wagner&#x27;s departure from Polydor. 

In 2007, Wagner appeared as Maxi in the gangster-comedy film &quot;Breathful.&quot;

===2008–2018: Theatre work and collaborations===

Wagner appeared in several theater productions and contributed vocals to their soundtracks. Among these was the song &quot;Bis ans Ende der Welt,&quot; recorded in 2008 with Dietmar Loeffler for the album &quot;Männerbeschaffungsmaßnahmen&quot;. In 2010, Wagner reunited with the supergroup Hamburg Allstars for another charity single, &quot;[[You&#x27;ll Never Walk Alone]]&quot;, and also recorded the &quot;Check Eins&quot; theme song for the broadcaster [[ARD (broadcaster)|ARD]].

Her song &quot;[[Boomerang (Blümchen song)|Boomerang]]&quot; (1996) became part of an Internet campaign in early 2010 against &quot;[[Deutschland sucht den Superstar]]&quot;, the German version of &quot;[[Pop Idol]]&quot;. The campaign aimed to prevent the winner [[Mehrzad Marashi]]&#x27;s debut single, &quot;[[Don&#x27;t Believe (song)|Don&#x27;t Believe]]&quot;, from reaching the top of the charts. As part of the campaign, &quot;Boomerang&quot; was purchased online in large numbers, ultimately reaching number 7 on the charts, surpassing its original 1996 peak of number 11. However, it did not surpass &quot;Don&#x27;t Believe,&quot; which remained at number 1. This achievement marked &quot;Boomerang&quot; as Wagner&#x27;s fifth top-ten single, over a decade after its release. The campaign was likely inspired by a similar effort in the United Kingdom against &quot;[[The X Factor (UK)|The X Factor]]&quot;, where &quot;[[Killing in the Name]]&quot; by [[Rage Against the Machine]] became the [[List of Christmas number one singles (UK)|Christmas number one]] in 2009.

In 2011, Wagner recorded the song &quot;Oh, dieser Sound,&quot; a cover of a song by Superpunk, for a Superpunk tribute compilation album. She also starred in the 2011 play &quot;Alexandra – Glück und Verhängnis eines Stars,&quot; about the life of the German singer [[Alexandra (singer)|Alexandra]]. Her role as the lead character resulted in the release of a soundtrack tribute album in 2012, distributed exclusively through &quot;[[Reader&#x27;s Digest]]&quot;. In 2014, she appeared as a featured artist on the Wise Guys song &quot;Küss mich,&quot; which was included on their studio album &quot;Achterbahn&quot;. This collaboration marked the last time Wagner was credited as Jasmin Wagner before resuming her Blümchen persona in 2019.

=== 2019–present: Blümchen comeback and new record deal ===
In 2019, after a hiatus, Wagner returned as Blümchen and released her first new single, &quot;[[Computerliebe (Die Module spielen verrückt)|Computerliebe]]&quot;, a cover of the Paso Doble song. Later that year, Wagner re-recorded a new version of her debut single, &quot;Herz an Herz,&quot; with Ray Kuba, which was remixed by the band Marquess. For this release, she recorded the verses from the original Paso Doble version, which had been absent in the 1995 release. She also collaborated with [[David Hasselhoff]] on the 2019 single &quot;[[(You Made the) Summer Go Away]]&quot;.

Wagner made her first comeback performance as Blümchen in March 2019 in front of 60,000 people at the Veltins Arena in Gelsenkirchen, Germany. The return as Blümchen proved to be highly in demand, as tour dates quickly accumulated, leading Jasmin to perform at 22 additional concerts in Germany throughout 2019.

In 2020, Wagner signed a new record deal with the German label Schubert Music. She recorded her new album, &quot;Von Herzen&quot;, which was released on 23 July 2021 under her real name, Jasmin Wagner. The album introduced her &quot;new electro-schlager sound,&quot; combined with a &quot;modern, danceable schlager sound,&quot; according to a label spokesman. The album reached number 6 on Germany&#x27;s official Top 100 Album Chart.

The first single from &quot;Von Herzen&quot; was the song &quot;Gold,&quot; released on 20 April 2021. The song achieved moderate success, reaching number 42 on Germany&#x27;s official Singles Download Chart and number 10 on the Schlager Charts. A duet with rapper FiNCH, titled &quot;Herzalarm,&quot; was announced, with its release scheduled for 25 June 2021. The track became a top-10 hit for both artists, reaching number 7 on Germany&#x27;s Official Singles Chart. This marked Wagner&#x27;s highest chart placement on the German Singles Chart since her song &quot;Boomerang&quot; re-entered the chart at number 7 in 2010. The success of &quot;Herzalarm&quot; also earned Wagner a new chart record, making her one of the few German solo female artists (along with [[Nena]]) to have top-40 hits in four consecutive decades. After 14 of Wagner&#x27;s singles reached the top 40 in the 1990s, 2 singles (&quot;Ist Deine Liebe Echt?&quot;, &quot;Leb Deinen Traum&quot;) in the early 2000s, and &quot;Boomerang&quot; at number 7 in 2010, &quot;Herzalarm&quot; became her 18th top-40 entry on the German Singles Chart.

Additional tour dates were also announced for 2021, including two concerts in Sweden and one in Norway, where Wagner had a number-one hit on the singles chart with her song &quot;Heut&#x27; Ist Mein Tag&quot; in 1999.

==Artistry==
===Music===
Wagner&#x27;s Blümchen and Blossom songs varied from around 50 [[Beats per minute|BPM]] to about 200 BPM, spanning a wide range of musical genres, including [[Dance music|dance]], [[Rave]], [[Happy Hardcore]], [[Pop music|pop]], and [[Eurodance]], all mixed with simple melodies and lyrics. She also released pop ballads such as &quot;Gib mir noch Zeit,&quot; &quot;Es ist vorbei,&quot; and &quot;Ich vermisse dich.&quot; Throughout her career, Wagner experimented with different genres and styles, such as [[2-step garage|2-step]] (&quot;Automatisch,&quot; &quot;U-Bahn&quot;), house (&quot;Immer noch verliebt&quot;), disco (&quot;Ist deine Liebe echt&quot;), reggae fusion (&quot;(You made the) Summer go Away&quot;), and indie rock (&quot;Are you Ready for some Darkness&quot;). While Wagner&#x27;s albums &quot;Herzfrequenz&quot; and &quot;Verliebt...&quot; featured a similar number of happy hardcore tracks with only refrains, she shifted direction for her third and fourth albums, &quot;Jasmin&quot; and &quot;Die Welt gehört dir&quot;, embracing a softer dance-pop sound with both refrains and verses. 

Wagner is also known for numerous songs and singles that are covers of other artists, including Paso Doble, Queen, Nena, Sesame Street, Ideal, Rozalla, Eddie Cantor, Ciro Dammicco, Turbonegro, Olivia Newton-John, and Superpunk. She is particularly noted for singing in multiple languages, primarily German and English, but also in French, such as the French version of &quot;Du bist die Insel,&quot; titled &quot;Tu es mon île,&quot; a duet with French singer Yta Farrow.

===Public image===
Due to her drastic shift in musical direction aside from her Blümchen sound, Wagner adopted various stage names. These included Blossom for her international Blümchen releases, Denim Girl for the indie rock song &quot;Are you Ready for some Darkness,&quot; and her real names, Jasmin Wagner or simply Jasmin, for her recent works, such as the 60s-inspired sound of &quot;Die Versuchung&quot;.

==Personal life==
For four years, Wagner was in a relationship with Lucas Cordalis. In 2015, she married Swiss entrepreneur Frank Sippel. She divorced Sippel in 2020. In November 2022, she welcomed her first child, a daughter, with her partner.

<text>María de los Remedios Alicia Rodriga Varo y Uranga (known as Remedios Varo, 16 December 1908 – 8 October 1963) was a Spanish and Mexican surrealist painter.

==Early life and education==
María de los Remedios Alicia Rodriga Varo y Uranga was born on 16 December 1908 in Anglès, a small town in the province of Girona, in Catalonia. Remedios was named in honor of the Virgen de los Remedios (&quot;Virgin of Remedies&quot;) as a &#x27;remedy&#x27; for an older sister&#x27;s death. She had two surviving siblings: an older brother Rodrigo, and a younger brother Luis. Her mother, Ignacia Uranga y Bergareche, was born in Argentina to Basque parents and her father, Rodrigo Varo y Zajalvo, was from Córdoba in Andalusia.

When Varo was a young child, her family moved frequently throughout Spain and North Africa to follow her father&#x27;s work as a hydraulic engineer. While her father was a somewhat agnostic liberal who studied Esperanto, her mother was a devout Catholic and enrolled her in a strict convent school at the age of eight. Varo&#x27;s father encouraged her artistic endeavors, taking her to museums and having her meticulously copy his diagrams. While in school, Varo was somewhat rebellious. She read authors such as Alexandre Dumas, Jules Verne, and Edgar Allan Poe, as well as mystical literature and Eastern spiritual works. As a teenager she became interested in dreams, writing stories which developed fantastical themes she would later explore in her art.

In 1924, Varo enrolled at the prestigious Real Academia de Bellas Artes de San Fernando in Madrid, a school known for rigid and exacting training. Aside from the required classes, she took an elective class in scientific drawing. One of her instructors was Realist painter Manuel Benedito, from whom she learned traditional oil painting techniques. Much of the work she created from 1926–1935, particularly her academic paintings, has been lost; it is unknown what happened to those artworks.

In the 1920s, the Surrealist movement was becoming popular with the Madrid art scene; the city hosted avant-garde intellectuals and artists such as Federico García Lorca, Luis Buñuel, Rafael Alberti, and Salvador Dalí. Varo became attracted to the surreal, finding inspiration in the works of Hieronymus Bosch, Francisco Goya, and El Greco which she visited at the Museo del Prado.

==Career==
Varo graduated from the Academia in 1930. Soon after, she married former classmate in San Sebastián. Lizárraga was a fellow Surrealist who worked in both visual arts and filmmaking; he was also an anarchist. Following an outbreak of violence in Madrid resulting from the establishment of the Second Spanish Republic, Varo and Lizárraga moved to Paris. In Paris, Varo enrolled at the Académie de la Grande Chaumière and quickly dropped out, realizing she did not want to remain within the confines of formal education. Working odd jobs and engaging with the Parisian art scene, the couple stayed in the city for a year before moving to Barcelona in 1932.

By the early 1930s, Barcelona had become the liberal and avant-garde artistic center of Spain, more so than Madrid. Soon after arriving, Varo started a romantic relationship with fellow artist Esteban Francés, although still living with Lizárraga; this was the first of multiple open relationships she would have. While in Barcelona, Varo and Lizárraga worked for an advertising firm. Varo became part of a circle of other avant-garde artists, including and Óscar Domínguez, and with Francés she came into contact with French Surrealists. While sharing an art studio on the Plaça de Lesseps with Francés, Varo began creating her first artworks after graduating from the Academia. Her work of the mid-1930s indicates familiarity with contemporary Spanish and French Surrealist imagery. Varo often played the popular Surrealist game &quot;cadavre exquis&quot; with her friends, and sent works she had made via the game to fellow artist and friend Marcel Jean for circulation in Paris.

By the summer of 1935, the tension and violence which had caused Varo and Lizárraga to leave Madrid had spread throughout Spain; the Spanish Civil War began the next year. Varo&#x27;s brother Luis enlisted in the Francoist army and died of typhoid fever soon thereafter, a course of events which would come as a shock to Varo. It was in this context that Domínguez introduced Varo to French Surrealist poet Benjamin Péret, who had arrived in Barcelona in August 1936 to volunteer with the Republican faction. Péret was highly politically active; he was a member of the Trotskyist POUM and staunchly anti-clerical. Varo and Péret soon became romantically involved; his 1936 volume of love poetry, &quot;Je sublime&quot;, was dedicated to her.

=== France ===
When Péret decided to return to Paris in 1937, Varo joined him. Francés soon followed, and would compete with Péret for Varo&#x27;s affection. Through Péret, Varo became acquainted with the inner circle of Surrealists, including André Breton, Max Ernst, Victor Brauner, Joan Miró, Wolfgang Paalen, and Leonora Carrington. Varo felt intimidated by Breton—and Péret—at Surrealist gatherings, as the two fostered an atmosphere which André Thirion compared to an &quot;entrance exam&quot;. By the late 1930s, Varo had started giving her year of birth as 1913 instead of 1908; this would later be reflected on her passport and grave. According to biographer Janet Kaplan, she may have fabricated being five years younger to fit more closely to the Surrealist ideal of the : an uncorrupted, childlike woman intuitively connected with the unconscious mind. During the period of 1937–1939, Varo experimented with new techniques and influences, finding inspiration in the works of her friends Dalí, Ernst, Paalen, Brauner, and René Magritte. Never formally a part of the Surrealist group, Varo nonetheless participated in the 1936 London International Surrealist Exhibition and subsequent International Surrealist Exhibitions in Tokyo, Paris, Mexico City, and New York. Her work was also often republished in Surrealist periodicals, including &quot;Minotaure&quot;.

While in Paris with Péret, Varo lived the impoverished and bohemian life typical of artists. They both worked numerous odd jobs; Varo, along with Domínguez, resorted to forging de Chirico paintings when particularly destitute. As she was living with Péret, she became romantically involved with Brauner and her work of the period was heavily influenced by his.

==== World War II ====
In 1939, the Nationalists claimed victory in Spain and Francisco Franco disallowed anyone associated with the Republicans from entering the country; Varo became permanently unable to return to her home and was isolated from her family. This deeply impacted her, and was a source of pain and regret throughout her life. In July of the same year, the French government began evacuating Paris, and in September World War II officially began. Varo and her circle stayed in the city, which for the first eight months of war saw little action other than an influx of foreign refugees from elsewhere in Europe. As a foreign national herself, Varo now risked deportation in an increasingly hostile environment. Her association with the communist Péret put her at further risk, and he was imprisoned in early 1940 for his political activism. Varo was imprisoned as well, at some point in 1940, for her relationship with Péret. She never spoke about this experience; the length and location of her internment and the conditions she faced are unknown. However, according to friends&#x27; accounts, it had an intense impact on her.

While viewing a documentary film on French internment camps by Hungarian photojournalist Emerico Weisz, by coincidence Varo recognized Gerardo Lizárraga, to whom she was still legally married. They had lost contact when Varo left Spain, while Lizárraga remained to fight for the Republicans; when the Nationalists won, he fled to France and was imprisoned. After seeing the film, Varo and her network successfully bribed authorities and secured the release of Lizárraga.

On 14 June 1940, the Nazis invaded Paris, putting Varo at imminent risk. She, along with millions of other Parisians, fled to the unoccupied south of France. Domínguez insisted she take his seat in a car going south, and eventually she arrived in the coastal village of Canet-Plage. Initially staying with Jacques Hérold and several other refugees, she soon moved in with Brauner. By August 1940, she had left Canet-Plage for Marseille and reunited with now-free Péret. Marseille was, although unoccupied, not safe; the Gestapo maintained a presence in the city. Varo and Péret found shelter with Varian Fry&#x27;s Emergency Rescue Committee, an organization dedicated to facilitating the migration of artists and intellectuals from wartime Europe to the Americas. Over time, much of Varo&#x27;s circle made it to Marseille, where they shared their limited funds among each other and met nightly in cafés.

The situation in Marseille deteriorated in 1940 and 1941, and the Rescue Committee recognized Péret and Varo&#x27;s immediate need to escape the Vichy authorities. With Péret having been denied entry into the United States due to his communist politics, they looked toward Mexico, which had declared amnesty for Spanish refugees in 1940. The Rescue Committee made appeals for funding of their travel to Mexico, and found places on the liner &quot;Serpa Pinto&quot;, due to depart from Casablanca, for them. Through unknown means, Varo and Péret arrived in Casablanca and boarded the ship, which was crowded with other refugees.

=== Mexico ===
Varo arrived in Mexico City in late 1941, part of a large migration of Spanish intellectuals and artists. The Mexican government under Lázaro Cárdenas gave Spanish refugees asylum and automatic citizenship, with few restrictions on employment; the European émigrés therefore contributed significantly to Mexico&#x27;s economy and culture. Varo and Péret, rather than becoming ingratiated with the Mexican artistic community, preferred to associate with other Europeans, including old friends Lizárraga and Francés. Also within their circle was Gunther Gerzso, Kati Horna, Emerico Weisz, Dorothy Hood, Luis Buñuel, César Moro, Wolfgang Paalen, and Alice Rahon. Leonora Carrington, whom Varo had previously met in Paris, would become Varo&#x27;s closest friend.

Varo and Péret rented a tenement apartment together in the Colonia San Rafael neighborhood, which Varo decorated with artwork and objects she thought of as magical. She also took care of several birds and stray cats. They were impoverished, and Varo supported herself and Péret by working odd jobs, including for Marc Chagall. She made her most consistent living from producing illustrations for Bayer advertisements. During the early 1940s, Varo focused on writing as a creative outlet, producing few paintings.

In 1947 Péret wanted to return to France, while Varo wished to stay in Mexico, which by then she viewed as her home. Péret moved back to Paris, and Varo started a relationship with a French pilot and fellow refugee named Jean Nicolle. They initially moved in together with Horna in the Colonia Roma neighborhood; they later moved into Lizárraga&#x27;s previous apartment.

Soon after, she joined a French scientific expedition in Venezuela with Nicolle. There she visited her mother and brother Rodrigo, an epidemiologist. Varo, staying in Caracas and Maracay, studied mosquitoes with a microscope and produced drawings of them for a Public Ministry of Health campaign against malaria. She returned to Mexico City in 1949, after struggling to obtain funds for travel back.

In 1952 Varo married Austrian refugee Walter Gruen, and ended her career in commercial graphic design in favor of her personal art. Varo found critical and financial success with two exhibitions at the Galería Diana, including her first solo exhibition, in 1955–1956. The success of the 1955 solo exhibition allowed Varo to establish a waiting list for buyers. Her second and final solo exhibition took place at the Galería Juan Martín in 1962; all of the paintings displayed were sold.

Varo painted her final finished canvas, titled &quot;Still Life Reviving&quot;, in 1963. She died of a heart attack on 8 October of the same year.

==== Relationship with Leonora Carrington and Kati Horna ====
Initially having met in Paris in the 1930s when the latter was living with Max Ernst, Varo and Carrington reunited in Mexico City. Carrington was an English artist who bonded with Varo over their shared experiences. Carrington and Varo shared an interest in the occult and magic, and they found inspiration in the folk practices of Mexico.

Among all the refugees that were forced to flee from Europe to Mexico City during and after World War II, Remedios Varo, Leonora Carrington, and Kati Horna formed a bond that would immensely affect their lives and work. They lived close to each other in the Colonia Roma district of Mexico City.

Varo and Carrington had previously met through André Breton while living in Paris. Although Horna did not meet the other two until they were all in Mexico City, she was already familiar with the work of Varo and Carrington after being given a few of their paintings by Edward James, a British poet and patron of the surrealist movement.

All three attended the meetings of followers of the Russian mystics Peter Ouspensky and George Gurdjieff. They were inspired by Gurdjieff&#x27;s study of the evolution of consciousness and Ouspensky&#x27;s idea of the possibility of four-dimensional painting. Though deeply influenced by the ideas of the Russian mystics, the women often ridiculed the practices and behavior of those in the circle. The trio were sometimes referred to as &quot;the three witches&quot;, because of their interest in the occult and spiritual practices.

After becoming friends, Varo and Carrington began writing collaboratively and wrote two plays together which were not published: &quot;El santo cuerpo grasoso&quot; and (unfinished) &quot;Lady Milagra&quot;. Using a technique similar to &quot;cadavre exquis&quot;, they took turns writing small segments of text and put them together. Even when not writing together, they were often drawing from the same sources of inspiration and using the same themes in their paintings. Varo and Carrington remained close friends until Varo&#x27;s death in 1963.

==Artistic influences==
The characters pictured in Varo&#x27;s artwork resemble herself, with heart-shaped faces, long noses, and almond-shaped eyes. According to art historian Janet Kaplan, much of her work is autobiographical in nature; her 1960–1961 triptych reflects her time as a student in a restrictive convent school. Her paintings, often depicting journeys and encounters with strange people, also reflect the frequent travel of her childhood and her traumatic experience of exile and war.

With the discovery of the pre-Columbian village Tlatilco in the early 1940s, Varo began collecting pre-Columbian artifacts from the site and elsewhere; she developed a large collection over time. However, indigenous Mexican influence on her art was limited, and she continued to mostly draw from European sources throughout her mature period.

===Philosophical influences===
Varo considered surrealism as an &quot;expressive resting place within the limits of Cubism, and as a way of communicating the incommunicable&quot;.

Even though Varo was critical of her childhood religion, Catholicism, her work was influenced by religion. She differed from other Surrealists because of her constant use of religion in her work. She also turned to a wide range of mystic and hermetic traditions, both Western and non-Western, for influence. She was influenced by her belief in magic and animistic faiths. She was very connected to nature and believed that there was strong relation between the plant, human, animal, and mechanical world. Her belief in mystical forces greatly influenced her paintings. Varo was aware of the importance of biology, chemistry, physics, and botany, and thought it should blend together with other aspects of life. Her fascination with science, including Einstein&#x27;s theory of relativity and Darwinian evolution, has been noted by admirers of her art.

She turned with equal interest to the ideas of Carl Jung as to the theories of George Gurdjieff, P. D. Ouspensky, Helena Blavatsky, Meister Eckhart, and the Sufis, and was as fascinated with the legend of the Holy Grail as with sacred geometry, witchcraft, alchemy, and the &quot;I Ching&quot;. Varo described her beliefs about her own powers of witchcraft in a letter to English author Gerald Gardner, &quot;Personally, I don&#x27;t believe I&#x27;m endowed with any special powers, but instead with an ability to see relationships of cause and effect quickly, and this beyond the ordinary limits of common logic.&quot; In 1938 and 1939, Varo joined her closest companions Frances, Roberto Matta, and Gordon Onslow Ford in exploring the fourth dimension, basing much of their studies on Ouspensky&#x27;s book &quot;Tertium Organum&quot;. The books &quot;Illustrated Anthology of Sorcery, Magic and Alchemy&quot; by Grillot de Givry and &quot;The History of Magic and the Occult&quot; by Kurt Seligmann were highly valued in Breton&#x27;s Surrealist circle. She saw in each of these an avenue to self-knowledge and the transformation of consciousness.

===Surrealist influences===
One critic states, &quot;Remedios seems to never limit herself to one mode of expression. For her tools of the painter and the writer are unified in breaking down our visual and intellectual customs&quot;. Even so, most classify her as a surrealist artist in that her work displays many trappings of the surrealist practice. Her work displays a liberating self-image and evokes a sense of otherworldliness which is so characteristic of the surrealist movement. One scholar notes that Varo&#x27;s practice of automatic writing directly correlates to that of the Surrealists. The father of Surrealism, André Breton, excluded women as fundamental to the movement of Surrealism, but after Varo&#x27;s death in 1963, he connected her &quot;forever to the ranks of international surrealism&quot;.

The Surrealist movement tended to devalue women. Some of Varo&#x27;s art elevated women, while still falling under the category of Surrealism, but it was not necessarily her intention for her work to address problems in gender inequality. Her art and actions challenged the traditional patriarchy; Wolfgang Paalen encouraged her in this with his theories about the origins of civilization in matriarchal cultures, and the analogies between pre-classic Europe and pre-Mayan Mexico.

==Analysis of Varo&#x27;s artwork==
Mexican philosopher Juliana González, a friend of Varo&#x27;s, writes that an element of &quot;Romantic optimism&quot; in her art distinguishes Varo from the broader Surrealist movement. According to the art historian Deborah Haynes, Varo subverted the typically patriarchal attitudes of the Surrealists with her ambiguously gendered paintings.

Varo often painted images of women in confined spaces, achieving a sense of isolation. While Varo did not deem her own work feminist, &quot;her work stretches the limits of and directly challenges confabulated, patriarchal ideals of femininity&quot;. Also, Varo&#x27;s work redacts male interpretation of the female body. Her works focus on female empowerment and agency. The androgynous figures characteristic of her later work also challenge gender in that the figures do not fall neatly into gender normative categories, and often could be of either sex, creating a sense of the &quot;middle area&quot; between the two sexes and of the gender norms placed on them. One critic states, &quot;Because the female body, a sacred erotic artistic space for men, is transformed by [Varo] into nongendered shapes and forms, namely animals and insects, the space becomes freed from monolithic sexual interpretation&quot;.  

Later in her career, her characters developed into her emblematic androgynous figures with heart-shaped faces, large almond eyes, and the aquiline noses that represent her own features. Varo often depicted herself through these key features in her paintings, regardless of the figure&#x27;s gender. &quot;Varo tends to not play out personal strife on the canvas but rather portrays herself in various roles in surreal dreamscapes&quot;. &quot;It is Varo herself who is the alchemist or explorer. In creating these characters, she is defining her identity&quot;.

Many of Varo&#x27;s works depict animals, primarily cats and birds. Varo also frequently depicted hybrid creatures which combined cats, owls, or women. Cats play varied roles in Varo&#x27;s art; sometimes they are observers, conveyors of symbolism, or &quot;familiars&quot;. A small minority of her paintings feature cats as the central subject; generally, cats occupy a collaborative role in the scene. In Varo&#x27;s work, birds usually represent imagination and spiritual enlightenment; in some paintings such as &quot;Creation of the Birds&quot; (1958) and &quot;The Encounter&quot; (1962), owl-human hybrids represent wisdom.

Varo&#x27;s work also focuses on psychoanalysis and its role in society and female agency. In speaking on &quot;Woman leaving the Psychoanalyst&quot; (1961), one of Varo&#x27;s biographers states, &quot;Not only does Varo debunk the idea of a correct process of mental healing, but also she trivializes the very nature of that process by representing the impossible: a physical and literal dismissal of the father, Order, and in Lacanian terms the official entrance into culture: verbal Language&quot;.

==Legacy==
In 1964, the National Museum of Modern Art in the Palacio de Bellas Artes held a tribute exhibition of Varo&#x27;s work, with record attendance. The Museo de Arte Moderno in Mexico City held a retrospective exhibition in 1971, which attracted the then-highest attendance in the museum&#x27;s history, and again in 1983 and 1994. More than fifty of her works were displayed in a retrospective exhibition in 2000 at the National Museum of Women in the Arts in Washington, DC. In 2023, the Art Institute of Chicago held an exhibit of her work the first to be held of her work in the last 20 years in the U.S. with half of the works seen for the first time in the U.S.

Varo&#x27;s artwork is well known in Mexico, but is not as well known throughout the rest of the world.

<doc id="765627" wikidata="Q312296" url="?curid=765627" title="Iridescent shark">
<text>The iridescent shark or iridescent shark catfish (Pangasianodon hypophthalmus) is a species of shark catfish (family Pangasiidae) native to the rivers of Southeast Asia. Despite its name, it is not a shark. It is found in the Mekong basin as well as the Chao Phraya River, and is heavily cultivated for food there.

The meat is often marketed under the common name swai (from Thai ). It has also been introduced into other river basins as a food source, and its striking appearance and iridescence have made it popular with fishkeeping hobbyists, among whom it is also known as the Siamese shark catfish or sutchi catfish. The swai&#x27;s omnivorous diet consists of crustaceans, other fish, and plant matter.

==Names==
The fish is named for the glow or iridescence exhibited in juveniles, as well as the shark-like appearance of this and other shark catfish.

== Description ==
Adults reach up to in length and can weigh up to a maximum of . They have a shiny, iridescent color that gives these fish their name. However, large adults are uniformly grey. The fins are dark grey or black. Juveniles have a black stripe along the lateral line and a second black stripe below the lateral line.

== Distribution and habitat ==
Iridescent sharks originate from the large rivers Chao Phraya and Mekong in Asia, though they have been introduced into other rivers for aquaculture. They are a freshwater fish that natively live in a tropical climate and prefer water with a 6.5–7.5 pH, a water hardness of 2.0–29 dGH, and a temperature range of . They can tolerate hypoxic conditions thanks to their swim bladder which can be used as an air-breathing organ. They prefer large bodies of water similar to the deep waters of their native Mekong river basin.

The iridescent shark is a migratory fish that in most regions moves upstream to spawn during the flood season while the waters are high and returns downstream to seek rearing habitats when the river water levels recede. The dates of the migrations vary depending on the river system. In the Mekong river basin, they migrate upstream in May to July and return downstream during September through December. South of the Khone Falls, upstream migration occurs in October to February, with its peak in November to December; here, it appears to be triggered by receding waters at the end of the flood season.

In August 2015, an environmental group in Santander, Colombia, confirmed that iridescent sharks had been found in one of the tributaries that feed into the Magdalena River, having been accidentally introduced from illegal farm fisheries in the area. The find has caused alarm amongst the scientific community and government officials, as the Magdalena river is home to over 200 native fish species, 35 of which are endangered.

Disruption to these sharks can come from many physical stressors, including but not limited to shear forces, rapid decompression, blade strike and turbulence. These can lead to and have led to an increase in the Injury and mortality rate of these sharks. This is a sad reality since these injured can be caused by hydropower developments which are being put into place to combat the global climate crisis that is being faced.
Iridescent sharks are also introduced to other Southeast Asia countries for food, especially Peninsular Malaysia, Singapore, Indonesia and Myanmar. In Malaysia, Singapore and Indonesia they are called ikan patin (which &#x27;ikan&#x27; means fish in Malay and Indonesian), Malaysian Chinese prefer them steamed or cooked in whole, while Malay prefer cooking these fishes with Tempoyak and curry.

In Thailand, swai fish are commonly found in rivers and canals that run past important Buddhist temples or waterside places. Swai live in large schools, sometimes with other fish such as spot pangasius and red-tailed tinfoil with tinfoil barb. Fish that live in that area, people won&#x27;t catch them, and often feed them (usually bread), which is considered a merit-making and fun activity.

== Culinary profile ==

Pangasius does not have a gourmet reputation and is sold cheaply as swai (, from Thai สวาย &quot;s̄wāy&quot;) in the United States, panga (or pangas) in Europe and cream dory and basa in several Asian countries and in Australia and the UK.

Despite its lowly reputation, the total export of pangasius from Vietnam reached US$1.8 billion in 2014.

Pangasius fillets are an increasingly popular product because of their low cost, mild taste and firm texture. Recipes for other whitefish such as sole or halibut can be adapted to pangasius.

Pangasius is an omnivorous fish, and thus does not require a high level of animal protein in its diet. Typical grading sizes are , , and .

== In the aquarium ==

While juvenile iridescent sharks are sold as pets for home aquariums, they are not easy fish to keep. Iridescent sharks are schooling fish that prefer groups, are accustomed to living in rivers, and are active fish that require space. They have very poor eyesight, so detected movement from outside of their habitat can be seen as a threat. If stressed, their first instinct is to flee; a blind dash can cause injury in an aquarium environment. These injuries may result in the fish sinking to the bottom, where it may lie on its side or back until it recovers.

Iridescent sharks require a minimum tank size of to develop naturally. Schools require even larger tanks. If given enough room and fed adequately, they can reach in length. In most home aquaria, the lack of space stunts their growth. For this reason, most iridescent sharks kept in home aquaria grow to in length only and may die prematurely. When provided adequately sized aquaria and proper husbandry, iridescent sharks may live into their teens and grow to full size.

<text>Bank of New Zealand (BNZ) is one of New Zealand&#x27;s big four banks. It has been operating since October 1861, and since 1992 has been owned by National Australia Bank (NAB), retaining local governance with a New Zealand board of directors. The bank operates a variety of financial services covering retail, business, and institutional banking.

The &quot;Bank of New Zealand in Australia&quot; (&quot;BNZA&quot;) is a former entity, now owned by NAB.

==History==

The Bank of New Zealand was formed as a private company and incorporated by the New Zealand Bank Act 1861, which created the company and authorises it to issue banknotes. The Bank of New Zealand&#x27;s first office opened in Auckland in October 1861, followed shortly afterwards by the first branch in Dunedin in December 1861.

In 1862, branches opened in Wellington, Christchurch, and London. The bank gained the banking account of the New Zealand Government from the Union Bank of Australia, and became an agent to raise debt in the United Kingdom for the government. In the 1860s and 1870s capital was brought into New Zealand by the government and others. There was plenty of employment, development moved quickly and very good prospects brought property prices to high values.
In the 1880s prices of staple products fell very low, the rabbit pest cut wool production, and the government cut expenditure on public works by 75 per cent. Land fell to half its former value and was impossible to realise, many runholders and businessmen were ruined and the working classes were unable to purchase goods or pay their debts. There was no dairying or frozen meat industry. Investors withdrew their capital. The export of frozen meat began in the 1880s refer Canterbury Lamb and dairy products soon followed see Anchor butter. In June 1894 the BNZ saved by legislation. In 1895, the BNZ took over the Colonial Bank of New Zealand, which was in crisis.

===20th century timeline===
* 1940: £1 million interest-free loan as a war contribution to the Government. The 74 women in the company rise to more than 700 by 1945.
* 1943: Mobile branch opened in a caravan for American servicemen. Night banking introduced in Auckland and Wellington.
* 1944: Personal loans department opened. Government announces intention to nationalise the bank.
* 1945: Nash Government introduces the Bank of New Zealand Bill. Once passed the Government paid £7,933,000 in cash, transferable stock, and tax-free stock to the Bank&#x27;s 8,500 shareholders for their shares. The average holding was 495 shares.
* 1966: First computer purchased, an IBM 360/30 with a 16k memory; Databank Systems Ltd setup in 1967 with the National Bank of New Zealand; the other three trading banks join in 1968.
* 1978: Visa debit card introduced.
* 1980: Visa credit cards introduced.
* 1984: BNZ Centre completed on Willis Street, Wellington.
* 1985: Eftpos introduced through petrol stations in a pilot programme.
* 1987: Bank floated on sharemarket with a 15% stock offering.
* 1989: Government reduces its share to 51% by selling 34%; with 30% sold to Capital Markets Ltd, and the remainder to the general public
* 1990: Government bail out of $380 million to avoid collapse. Bolger was told on the Sunday after the 1990 election that the bank &quot;has to report by Friday, and if its not given support by then, it will collapse&quot; (because of Australian loans). It held &quot;40 percent of the commercial paper in New Zealand. So if it collapsed, half of New Zealand&#x27;s companies would have collapsed&quot;.

* 1992: National Australia Bank (NAB) purchased the BNZ and the BNZ becomes a subsidiary of the Australian bank, but retains local governance with a New Zealand board of directors.
* 1992: First call centre opened in Auckland.
* 1998: Head office moves to Auckland.
* 1999: BNZ launched Internet Banking.
* 1999: BNZ Private Banking network launched.

At some point, the business entity known as Bank of New Zealand in Australia (BNZA) was absorbed by NAB.

In 2000, there were 192 branches and 5562 staff.

On 1 October 2008 the bank rebranded itself as &quot;BNZ&quot;, with a change in logo and colours.

 the bank employed over 5,000 people in New Zealand.

In 2020, BNZ announced the closure of 38 branches over the following seven months as a result of the economic effects of the COVID-19 pandemic in New Zealand.

==Sustainability==
Bank of New Zealand became the first bank in New Zealand to become carbon neutral. The achievement was announced in September 2010 after a three-year initiative to reduce emissions through greater energy and vehicle efficiency, encouraging changed behaviour by employees at work and at home and through offsetting of unavoidable emissions by purchasing quality carbon credits. The most visible aspect of the initiative came through the construction of three brand new, energy efficient buildings to house the bulk of the company’s management and administration staff. Two of these building are located in the Auckland CBD, one at Quay Park and the other at 80 Queen Street. The third was the Harbour Quays complex on the Wellington waterfront, built in 2009 and demolished in 2019 after suffering damage in the 2016 Kaikōura earthquake. The Deloitte Centre at 80 Queen Street was tagged &quot;the greenest building in the land&quot; after it became the first building in New Zealand to receive three Five Green Stars awards. The BNZ Quay Park building was nominated for a BeST Design Award in 2008 for Offices and Workplace Environments.

<doc id="765642" wikidata="Q714999" url="?curid=765642" title="Causes of World War II">
<text>The causes of [[World War II]] have been given considerable attention by historians. The immediate precipitating event was the invasion of Poland by Nazi Germany on September 1, 1939, and the subsequent declarations of war on Germany made by Britain and France, but many other prior events have been suggested as ultimate causes. Primary themes in historical analysis of the war&#x27;s origins include the political takeover of Germany in 1933 by Adolf Hitler and the Nazi Party; Japanese militarism against China, which led to the Japanese invasion of Manchuria and the Second Sino-Japanese War; Italian aggression against Ethiopia, which led to the Second Italo-Ethiopian War; or military uprising in Spain, which led to the Spanish Civil War.

During the interwar period, deep anger arose in the Weimar Republic over the conditions of the 1919 Treaty of Versailles, which punished Germany for its role in World War I with heavy financial reparations and severe limitations on its military that were intended to prevent it from becoming a military power again. The demilitarisation of the Rhineland, the prohibition of German unification with Austria, and the loss of its overseas colonies as well as some 12% of its pre-war land area and population all provoked strong currents of revanchism in German politics.

During the worldwide economic crisis of the Great Depression in the 1930s, many people lost faith in liberal democracy and countries across the world turned to authoritarian regimes. In Germany, resentment over the terms of the Treaty of Versailles was intensified by the instability of the German political system, as many on both the Right and the Left rejected the Weimar Republic liberalism. The most extreme political aspirant to emerge from that situation was Adolf Hitler, the leader of the Nazi Party. The Nazis took totalitarian power in Germany from 1933 and demanded the undoing of the Versailles provisions. Their ambitious and aggressive domestic and foreign policies reflected their ideologies of antisemitism, unification of all Germans, the acquisition of &quot;living space&quot; (&quot;Lebensraum&quot;) for agrarian settlers, the elimination of Bolshevism and the hegemony of an &quot;Aryan&quot;/&quot;Nordic&quot; master race over &quot;subhumans&quot; (&quot;Untermenschen&quot;) such as Jews and Slavs. Other factors leading to the war included the aggression by Fascist Italy against Ethiopia, militarism in Imperial Japan against China, and Nationalists fighting against Republicans for control of Spain.

At first, the aggressive moves met with only feeble and ineffectual policies of appeasement from the other major world powers. The League of Nations proved helpless, especially regarding China and Ethiopia. A decisive proximate event was the 1938 Munich Conference, which formally approved Germany&#x27;s annexation of the Sudetenland from Czechoslovakia. Hitler promised it was his last territorial claim, nevertheless in early 1939, he became even more aggressive, and European governments finally realised that appeasement would not guarantee peace but by then it was too late.

Britain and France rejected diplomatic efforts to form a military alliance with the Soviet Union, and Hitler instead offered Stalin a better deal in the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact of August 1939. An alliance formed by Germany, Italy, and Japan led to the establishment of the Axis powers.
==Ultimate causes==
===Legacies of World War I===
By the end of World War I in late 1918, the world&#x27;s social and geopolitical circumstances had fundamentally and irrevocably changed. The Allies had been victorious, but many of Europe&#x27;s economies and infrastructures had been devastated, including those of the victors. France, along with the other victors, was in a desperate situation regarding its economy, security and morale and understood that its position in 1918 was &quot;artificial and transitory&quot;. Thus, French Prime Minister Georges Clemenceau worked to gain French security via the Treaty of Versailles, and French security demands, such as reparations, coal payments, and a demilitarised Rhineland, took precedence at the Paris Peace Conference of 1919–1920, which designed the treaty. The war &quot;must be someone&#x27;s fault – and that&#x27;s a very natural human reaction&quot;, analysed the historian Margaret MacMillan. Germany was charged with the sole responsibility of starting World War I, and the War Guilt Clause was the first step to satisfying revenge for the victor countries, especially France, against Germany. Roy H. Ginsberg argued, &quot;France was greatly weakened and, in its weakness and fear of a resurgent Germany, sought to isolate and punish Germany... French revenge would come back to haunt France during the Nazi invasion and occupation twenty years later&quot;.
The two main provisions of the French security agenda were war reparations from Germany in the form of money and coal and a detached German Rhineland. The German (Weimar Republic) government printed excess currency, which created inflation, to compensate for the lack of funds, and it borrowed money from the United States. Reparations from Germany were needed to stabilise the French economy. France also demanded for Germany to give France its coal supply from the Ruhr to compensate for the destruction of French coal mines during the war. The French demanded an amount of coal that was a &quot;technical impossibility&quot; for the Germans to pay. France also insisted on the demilitarisation of the German Rhineland in the hope of hindering any possibility of a future German attack and giving France a physical security barrier between itself and Germany. The inordinate amount of reparations, coal payments and the principle of a demilitarised Rhineland were largely viewed by the Germans as insulting and unreasonable.

The resulting Treaty of Versailles brought a formal end to the war but was judged by governments on all sides of the conflict. It was neither lenient enough to appease Germany nor harsh enough to prevent it from becoming a dominant continental power again. The German people largely viewed the treaty as placing the blame, or &quot;war guilt&quot;, on Germany and Austria-Hungary and as punishing them for their &quot;responsibility&quot;, rather than working out an agreement that would assure long-term peace. The treaty imposed harsh monetary reparations and requirements for demilitarisation and territorial dismemberment, caused mass ethnic resettlement and separated millions of ethnic Germans into neighbouring countries.

In the effort to pay war reparations to Britain and France, the Weimar Republic printed trillions of marks, which caused hyperinflation. Robert O. Paxton stated, &quot;No postwar German government believed it could accept such a burden on future generations and survive...&quot;. Paying reparations to the victorious side had been a traditional punishment with a long history of use, but it was the &quot;extreme immoderation&quot; that caused German resentment. Germany did not make its last World War I reparation payment until 3 October 2010, 92 years after the end of the war. Germany also fell behind its coal payments because of a passive resistance movement against France. In response, the French invaded the Ruhr and occupied it. By then, most Germans had become enraged with the French and placed the blame for their humiliation on the Weimar Republic. Adolf Hitler, a leader of the Nazi Party, attempted a coup d&#x27;état in 1923 in what became known as the Beer Hall Putsch, and he intended to establish a Greater Germanic Reich. Although he failed, Hitler gained recognition as a national hero by the German population.

During the war, German colonies outside Europe had been annexed by the Allies, and Italy took the southern half of Tyrol after the armistice. The war in the east had ended with the defeat and the collapse of the Russian Empire, and German troops had occupied large parts of Eastern and Central Europe with varying degrees of control and established various client states such as a kingdom of Poland and the United Baltic Duchy. The German Navy spent most of the war in port, only to be turned over to the Allies. It was scuttled by its own officers to avoid it from being surrendered. The lack of an obvious military defeat would become one of the pillars holding together the &quot;Dolchstosslegende&quot; (&quot;stab-in-the-back myth&quot;), which gave the Nazis another propaganda tool.
The demilitarised Rhineland and the additional cutbacks on military also infuriated the Germans. Although France logically wanted the Rhineland to be a neutral zone, France had the power to make their desire happen, which merely exacerbated German resentment of the French. In addition, the Treaty of Versailles dissolved the German general staff, and possession of navy ships, aircraft, poison gas, tanks and heavy artillery was also made illegal. The humiliation of being bossed around by the victor countries, especially France, and being stripped of their prized military made the Germans resent the Weimar Republic and idolise anyone who stood up to it. Austria also found the treaty unjust, which encouraged Hitler&#x27;s popularity.

The conditions generated bitter resentment towards the war&#x27;s victors, who had promised the Germans that US President Woodrow Wilson&#x27;s Fourteen Points would be a guideline for peace; but the Americans had played only a minor role in the war, and Wilson could not convince the Allies to agree to adopt his Fourteen Points. Many Germans felt that the German government had agreed to an armistice based on that understanding, and others felt that the German Revolution of 1918–1919 had been orchestrated by the &quot;November criminals&quot;, who later assumed office in the new Weimar Republic. The Japanese also started to express resentment against Western Europe for how they were treated during the negotiations of the Treaty of Versailles. The Japanese proposition to discuss the issue of racial equality was not put in the final draft because of many other Allies, and the Japanese participation in the war caused little reward for the country. The war&#x27;s economic and psychological legacies persisted well into the Interwar period.

===Failure of the League of Nations===
The League of Nations was an international peacekeeping organization founded in 1919 with the explicit goal of preventing future wars. The League&#x27;s methods included disarmament, collective security, the settlement of disputes between countries by negotiations and diplomacy and the improvement of global welfare. The diplomatic philosophy behind the League represented a fundamental shift in thought from the preceding century. The old philosophy of &quot;concert of nations&quot;, which grew out of the Congress of Vienna (1815), saw Europe as a shifting map of alliances among nation-states, which created a balance of power that was maintained by strong armies and secret agreements. Under the new philosophy, the League would act as a government of governments, with the role of settling disputes between individual nations in an open and legalist forum. Despite Wilson&#x27;s advocacy, the United States never joined the League of Nations.

The League lacked an armed force of its own and so depended on member nations to enforce its resolutions, uphold economic sanctions that the League ordered or provide an army when needed for the League to use. However, individual governments were often very reluctant to do so. After numerous notable successes and some early failures in the 1920s, the League ultimately proved incapable of preventing aggression by the Axis Powers in the 1930s. The reliance upon unanimous decisions, the lack of an independent body of armed forces and the continued self-interest of its leading members meant that the failure was arguably inevitable.

===Expansionism and militarism===

Expansionism is the doctrine of expanding the territorial base or economic influence of a country, usually by means of military aggression. Militarism is the principle or policy of maintaining a strong military capability to use aggressively to expand national interests and/or values, with the view that military efficiency is the supreme ideal of a state.

The Treaty of Versailles and the League of Nations had sought to stifle expansionist and militarist policies by all actors, but the conditions imposed by their creators imposed on the world&#x27;s new geopolitical situation and the technological circumstances of the era only emboldened the re-emergence of those ideologies during the Interwar Period. By the early 1930s, militaristic and aggressive national ideologies prevailed in Germany, Japan and Italy. The attitude fuelled advancements in military technology, subversive propaganda and ultimately territorial expansion. It has been observed that the leaders of countries that have been suddenly militarised often feel a need to prove that their armies are formidable, which was often a contributing factor in the start of conflicts such as the Second Italo-Ethiopian War and the Second Sino-Japanese War.

In Italy, Benito Mussolini sought to create a New Roman Empire, based around the Mediterranean. Italy invaded Ethiopia as early as 1935, Albania in early 1938, and later Greece. The invasion of Ethiopia provoked angry words and a failed oil embargo from the League of Nations. &quot;Spazio vitale&quot; (&quot;living space&quot;) was the territorial expansionist concept of Italian Fascism. It was analogous to Nazi Germany&#x27;s concept of &quot;Lebensraum&quot; and the United States&#x27; concept of &quot;Manifest Destiny&quot;. Fascist ideologist Giuseppe Bottai likened this historic mission to the deeds of the ancient Romans.

Under the Nazi regime, Germany began its own program of expansion that sought to restore its &quot;rightful&quot; boundaries. As a prelude toward its goals, the Rhineland was remilitarised in March 1936. Also of importance was the idea of a Greater Germany, supporters of which hoped to unite the German people under one nation-state to include all territories inhabited by Germans, even if they happened to be a minority in a particular territory. After the Treaty of Versailles, a unification between Germany and the newly formed German-Austria, a rump state of Austria-Hungary, was blocked by the Allies, despite the large majority of Austrians supporting the idea.

During the Weimar Republic (1919–1933), the Kapp Putsch, an attempted coup d&#x27;état against the republican government, was launched by disaffected members of the armed forces. Later, some of the more radical militarists and nationalists were submerged in grief and despair into the Nazi Party, and more moderate elements of militarism declined. The result was an influx of militarily-inclined men into the Nazi Party. Combined with its racial theories, that fuelled irredentist sentiments and put Germany on a collision course for war with its immediate neighbours.
In Asia, the Empire of Japan harboured expansionist desires towards Manchuria and the Republic of China. Two contemporaneous factors in Japan contributed both to the growing power of its military and the chaos in its ranks before World War I. One was the Cabinet Law, which required the Imperial Japanese Army (IJA) and the Imperial Japanese Navy (IJN) to nominate cabinet members before changes could be formed. That essentially gave the military a veto power over the formation of any Cabinet in the ostensibly-parliamentary country. The other factor was &quot;gekokujō&quot;, the institutionalized disobedience by junior officers. It was common for radical junior officers to press their goals to the extent of assassinating their seniors. In 1936, the phenomenon resulted in the February 26 Incident in which junior officers attempted a coup d&#x27;état and killed leading members of the Japanese government. In the 1930s, the Great Depression wrecked Japan&#x27;s economy and gave radical elements within the Japanese military the chance to force the entire military into working towards the conquest of all of Asia.

For example, in 1931, the Kwantung Army, a Japanese military force stationed in Manchuria, staged the Mukden Incident, which sparked the invasion of Manchuria and its transformation into the Japanese puppet state of Manchukuo.

===Germans vs. Slavs===

Twentieth-century events marked the culmination of a millennium-long process of intermingling between Germans and Slavic people. The rise of nationalism in the 19th century made race a centerpiece of political loyalty. The rise of the nation-state had given way to the politics of identity, including pan-Germanism and pan-Slavism. Furthermore, Social Darwinist theories framed the coexistence as a &quot;Teuton vs. Slav&quot; struggle for domination, land, and limited resources. Integrating these ideas into their own worldview, the Nazis believed that the Germans, the &quot;Aryan race&quot;, were the master race and that the Russians and Poles were inferior.

===Japan&#x27;s seizure of resources and markets===

Other than a few coal and iron deposits and a small oil field on Sakhalin Island, Japan lacked strategic mineral resources. In the early 20th century, in the Russo-Japanese War, Japan had succeeded in pushing back the East Asian expansion of the Russian Empire in competition for Korea and Manchuria.

Japan&#x27;s goal after 1931 was economic dominance of most of East Asia, often expressed in the Pan-Asian terms of &quot;Asia for the Asians&quot;. Japan was determined to dominate the China market, which the US and other European powers had been dominating. On October 19, 1939, US Ambassador to Japan Joseph C. Grew, in a formal address to the America-Japan Society, stated that
In 1931, Japan invaded Manchuria and China proper. Under the guise of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, with slogans such as &quot;Asia for the Asians!&quot;, Japan sought to remove the Western powers&#x27; influence in China and replace it with Japanese domination.

The ongoing conflict in China led to a deepening conflict with the US in which public opinion was alarmed by events such as the Nanking Massacre and growing Japanese power. Lengthy talks were held between the US and Japan. The Japanese invasion of the south of French Indochina made President Franklin Roosevelt freeze all Japanese assets in the US. The intended consequence was to halt oil shipments from the US to Japan, which supplied 80 percent of Japanese oil imports. The Netherlands and Britain followed suit.

With oil reserves that would last only a year and a half during peacetime and much less during wartime, the ABCD line left Japan two choices: comply with the US-led demand to pull out of China or seize the oilfields in the East Indies from the Netherlands. The Japanese government deemed it unacceptable to retreat from China.

===Mason-Overy debate: &quot;Flight into War&quot; theory===
In the late 1980s, the British historian Richard Overy was involved in a historical dispute with Timothy Mason that played out mostly over the pages of the &quot;Past and Present&quot; journal over the reasons for the outbreak of the war in 1939. Mason had contended that a &quot;flight into war&quot; had been imposed on Hitler by a structural economic crisis, which confronted Hitler with the choice of making difficult economic decisions or aggression. Overy argued against Mason&#x27;s thesis by maintaining that Germany was faced with economic problems in 1939, but the extent of those problems could not explain aggression against Poland and the reasons for the outbreak of war were the choices made by the Nazi leadership.

Mason had argued that the German working-class was always against the Nazi dictatorship; that in the overheated German economy of the late 1930s, German workers could force employers to grant higher wages by leaving for another firm and so grant the desired wage increases and that such a form of political resistance forced Hitler to go to war in 1939. Thus, the outbreak of the war was caused by structural economic problems, a &quot;flight into war&quot; imposed by a domestic crisis. The key aspects of the crisis were, according to Mason, a shaky economic recovery that was threatened by a rearmament program that overwhelmed the economy and in which the regime&#x27;s nationalist bluster limited its options. In that way, Mason articulated a &quot;Primat der Innenpolitik&quot; (&quot;primacy of domestic politics&quot;) view of the war&#x27;s origins by the concept of social imperialism. Mason&#x27;s &quot;Primat der Innenpolitik&quot; thesis was in marked contrast to the &quot;Primat der Außenpolitik&quot; (&quot;primacy of foreign politics&quot;), which is usually used to explain the war. Mason thought German foreign policy was driven by domestic political considerations, and the launch the war in 1939 was best understood as a &quot;barbaric variant of social imperialism&quot;.

Mason argued, &quot;Nazi Germany was always bent &quot;at some time&quot; upon a major war of expansion&quot;. However, Mason argued that the timing of such a war was determined by domestic political pressures, especially as relating to a failing economy, and had nothing to do with what Hitler wanted. Mason believed that from 1936 to 1941, the state of the German economy, not Hitler&#x27;s &quot;will&quot; or &quot;intentions&quot;, was the most important determinate on German foreign policy decisions.

Mason argued that the Nazi leaders were so deeply haunted by the November 1918 German Revolution that they were most unwilling to see any fall in working-class living standards for fear of provoking a repetition of the revolution. Mason stated that by 1939, the &quot;overheating&quot; of the German economy caused by rearmament, the failure of various rearmament plans produced by the shortages of skilled workers, industrial unrest caused by the breakdown of German social policies and the sharp drop in living standards for the German working class forced Hitler into going to war at a time and a place that were not of his choosing.

Mason contended that when faced with the deep socio-economic crisis, the Nazi leadership had decided to embark upon a ruthless foreign policy of &quot;smash and grab&quot; to seize territory in Eastern Europe that could be pitilessly plundered to support the living standards in Germany. Mason described German foreign policy as driven by an opportunistic &quot;next victim&quot; syndrome after the &quot;Anschluss&quot; in which the &quot;promiscuity of aggressive intentions&quot; was nurtured by every successful foreign policy move. Mason&#x27;s considered the decision to sign the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact and to attack Poland despite the risk of a war against Britain and France to be the abandonment by Hitler of his foreign policy program outlined in &quot;Mein Kampf&quot; and to have been forced on him by his need to stop a collapsing German economy by seizing territory abroad to be plundered.

For Overy, the problem with Mason&#x27;s thesis was that it rested on the assumption that in a way that was not shown by the records, information was passed on to Hitler about Germany&#x27;s economic problems. Overy argued for a difference between economic pressures induced by the problems of the Four Year Plan and economic motives to seize raw materials, industry and foreign reserves of neighbouring states as a way of accelerating the plan. Overy asserted that Mason downplayed the repressive German state&#x27;s capacity to deal with domestic unhappiness. Finally, Overy argued that there is considerable evidence that Germany felt that it could master the economic problems of rearmament. As one civil servant put it in January 1940, &quot;we have already mastered so many difficulties in the past, that here too, if one or other raw material became extremely scarce, ways and means will always yet be found to get out of a fix&quot;.

==Proximate causes==
===Nazi dictatorship===
Hitler and his Nazis took full control of Germany in 1933–34 (Machtergreifung), turning it into a dictatorship with a highly hostile outlook toward the Treaty of Versailles and Jews. It solved its unemployment crisis by heavy military spending.

Hitler&#x27;s diplomatic tactics were to make seemingly-reasonable demands and to threaten war if they were not met. After concessions were made, he accepted them and moved onto a new demand. When opponents tried to appease him, he accepted the gains that were offered and went to the next target. That aggressive strategy worked as Germany pulled out of the League of Nations (1933), rejected the Versailles Treaty, began to rearm with the Anglo-German Naval Agreement (1935), won back the Saar (1935), re-militarized the Rhineland (1936), formed an alliance (&quot;axis&quot;) with Mussolini&#x27;s Italy (1936), sent massive military aid to Franco in the Spanish Civil War (1936–39), seized Austria (1938), took over Czechoslovakia after the British and French appeasement of the Munich Agreement of 1938, formed a peace pact with Stalin&#x27;s Russia in August 1939 and finally invaded Poland in September 1939.

===Remilitarization of the Rhineland===

In violation of the Treaty of Versailles and the spirit of the Locarno Pact and the Stresa Front, Germany remilitarized the Rhineland on March 7, 1936, by moving German troops into the part of western Germany in which according to the Versailles Treaty, they were not allowed. Neither France nor Britain was prepared to fight a preventive war to stop the violation and so there were no consequences.

===Italian invasion of Abyssinia===

Following the Stresa Conference and even as a reaction to the Anglo-German Naval Agreement, the Italian dictator Benito Mussolini attempted to expand the Italian Empire in Africa by invading the Ethiopian Empire, also known as the Abyssinian Empire. The League of Nations declared Italy to be the aggressor and imposed sanctions on oil sales, which proved ineffective. Italy annexed Ethiopia in May 1936 and merged Ethiopia, Eritrea and Somaliland into a single colony, known as Italian East Africa. On June 30, 1936, Ethiopian Emperor Haile Selassie gave a stirring speech before the League of Nations denouncing Italy&#x27;s actions and criticizing the world community for standing by. He warned, &quot;It is us today. It will be you tomorrow&quot;. As a result of the League&#x27;s condemnation of Italy, Mussolini declared the country&#x27;s withdrawal from the organization.

===Spanish Civil War===
Between 1936 and 1939, Germany and Italy lent support to the Nationalists led by general Francisco Franco in Spain, and the Soviet Union supported the existing democratically elected government, the Spanish Republic, led by Manuel Azaña. Both sides experimented with new weapons and tactics. The League of Nations was never involved, and its major powers remained neutral and tried with little success to stop arms shipments into Spain. The Nationalists eventually defeated the Republicans in 1939.

Spain negotiated with joining the Axis but remained neutral during World War II and did business with both sides. It also sent a volunteer unit to help the Germans against the Soviets. The Spanish Civil War was considered in the 1940s and 1950s to be a prelude to World War II, which was the case to some extent by changing it into an antifascist contest after 1941, but bore no resemblance to the war that started in 1939 and had no major role in causing it.

===Second Sino-Japanese War===

In 1931, Japan took advantage of China&#x27;s weakness in the Warlord Era and fabricated the Mukden Incident in 1931 to set up the puppet state of Manchukuo in Manchuria, with Emperor Puyi, who had been the last emperor of China. In 1937 the Marco Polo Bridge Incident triggered the Second Sino-Japanese War.

The invasion was launched by the bombing of many cities such as Shanghai, Nanjing and Guangzhou. The latest, which began on 22 and 23 September 1937, called forth widespread protests culminating in a resolution by the Far Eastern Advisory Committee of the League of Nations. The Imperial Japanese Army captured the Chinese capital city of Nanjing and committed war crimes in the Nanjing Massacre. The war tied down large numbers of Chinese soldiers and so Japan set up three different Chinese puppet states to enlist some Chinese support.

===Anschluss===

The &quot;Anschluss&quot; was the 1938 annexation by threat of force of Austria into Germany. Historically, Pan-Germanism was the idea of creating a Greater Germany to include all ethnic Germans into one nation-state and was popular in both Austria and Germany.

The National Socialist Program included the idea in one of its points: &quot;We demand the unification of all Germans in the Greater Germany on the basis of the people&#x27;s right to self-determination.&quot;

The Stresa Front of 1935 between Britain, France and Italy had guaranteed the independence of Austria, but after the creation of the Rome-Berlin Axis, Mussolini was much less interested in upholding its independence.

The Austrian government resisted as long as possible but had no outside support and finally gave in to Hitler&#x27;s fiery demands. No fighting occurred, most Austrians supported the annexation and Austria was fully absorbed as part of Germany. Outside powers did nothing, and Italy had little reason for continued opposition to Germany and, if anything, was drawn in closer to the Nazis.

===Munich Agreement===

The Sudetenland was a predominantly-German region in Czechoslovakia along the border with Germany. It had more than three million ethnic Germans, who comprised almost a quarter of the country&#x27;s population. In the Treaty of Versailles, the region was given to the Czechoslovakia against the wishes of most of the local population. The decision to disregard its right to self-determination was based on France&#x27;s intent to weaken Germany. Much of Sudetenland was industrialised. 
Czechoslovakia had a modern army of 38 divisions, backed by a well-noted armament industry (Škoda) and military alliances with France and the Soviet Union. However, its defensive strategy against Germany was based on the mountains of the Sudetenland.

Hitler pressed for the Sudetenland&#x27;s incorporation into Germany and supported German separatist groups within the region. Alleged Czechoslovak brutality and persecution under Prague helped to stir up nationalist tendencies, as did the Nazi press. After the &quot;Anschluss&quot;, all German parties except for the German Social-Democratic Party merged with the Sudeten German Party (SdP). Paramilitary activity and extremist violence peaked during the period, and the Czechoslovak government declared martial law in parts of the Sudetenland to maintain order. That only complicated the situation, especially since Slovak nationalism was rising from suspicion towards Prague and encouragement by Germany. Citing the need to protect the Germans in Czechoslovakia, Germany requested the immediate annexation of the Sudetenland.

In the Munich Agreement on September 30, 1938, the British, French, and Italian prime ministers appeased Hitler by giving him what he wanted in the hope that it would be his last demand. The powers allowed Germany to move troops into the region and incorporate it into the Reich &quot;for the sake of peace&quot;. In exchange, Hitler gave his word that Germany would make no further territorial claims in Europe. Czechoslovakia was not allowed to participate in the conference. When the French and British negotiators informed the Czechoslovak representatives about the agreement and that if Czechoslovakia would not accept it, France and Britain would consider Czechoslovakia to be responsible for war and stay neutral, Czechoslovak President Edvard Beneš capitulated and Germany took the Sudetenland unopposed.

Chamberlain&#x27;s policies have been the subject of intense debate for more than 70 years by academics, politicians and diplomats. The historians&#x27; assessments have ranged from condemnation for allowing Hitler&#x27;s Germany to grow too strong to the judgment that Germany was so strong that it might well win a war and so the postponement of a showdown was in the country&#x27;s best interests.

====German occupation and Slovak independence====
In March 1939, breaking the Munich Agreement, German troops invaded Prague, and with the Slovaks declaring independence, Czechoslovakia disappeared as a country. The entire ordeal ended the French and British policy of appeasement.

===Italian invasion of Albania===

After the German occupation of Czechoslovakia, Mussolini feared for Italy becoming a second-rate member of the Axis. Rome delivered Tirana an ultimatum on March 25, 1939, by demanding the accession to Italy&#x27;s occupation of Albania. King Zog refused to accept money in exchange for allowing a full Italian takeover and colonization of Albania.

On April 7, 1939, Italian troops invaded Albania, which was occupied after a three-day campaign with minimal resistance offered by Albanian forces.

===Soviet–Japanese border war===

In 1939, the Japanese attacked west from Manchuria into the Mongolian People&#x27;s Republic after the 1938 Battle of Lake Khasan. They were decisively beaten by Soviet units, under General Georgy Zhukov. After the battle, the Soviet Union and Japan were at peace until 1945. Japan looked south to expand its empire, which led to conflict with the United States over the Philippines and the control of shipping lanes to the Dutch East Indies. The Soviet Union focused on its western border but left 1 million to 1.5 million troops to guard its border with Japan.

===Danzig crisis===
After the end of Czechoslovakia proved that Germany could not be trusted, Britain and France decided on a change of strategy. They decided any further unilateral German expansion would be met by force. The natural next target for German expansion was Poland, whose access to the Baltic sea had been carved out of West Prussia by the Versailles Treaty, which made East Prussia an exclave. The main port of the area, Danzig, had been made into a free city-state under Polish influence guaranteed by the League of Nations, a stark reminder to German nationalists of the Napoleonic free city that had been established after French Emperor Napoleon I&#x27;s crushing victory over Prussia in 1807.

After taking power, the Nazi government made efforts to establish friendly relations with Poland, which resulted in the signing of the ten-year German–Polish Non-Aggression Pact with the Piłsudski regime in 1934. In 1938, Poland participated in the dismemberment of Czechoslovakia by annexing Trans-Olza. In 1939, Hitler claimed extraterritoriality for the Reichsautobahn Berlin-Königsberg and a change in Danzig&#x27;s status in exchange for promises of territory in Poland&#x27;s neighbours and a 25-year extension of the non-aggression pact. Poland refused for fear of losing its &quot;de facto&quot; access to the sea, subjugation as a German satellite state or client state and future further German demands. In August 1939, Hitler delivered an ultimatum to Poland on Danzig&#x27;s status.

====Polish alliance with the Entente====
The Franco-Polish Alliance was the military alliance between Poland and France that was active between the early 1920s and the outbreak of the Second World War. The initial agreements were signed in February 1921 and formally took effect in 1923. During the interwar period the alliance with Poland was one of the cornerstones of French foreign policy.

The Anglo-Polish Alliance was formalised by the Anglo-Polish Agreement in 1939, with subsequent addenda of 1940 and 1944, for mutual assistance in case of a military invasion from Nazi Germany, as specified in a secret protocol.

== Interwar period ==
During the Polish–Soviet War of 1920, France, one of the most active supporters of Poland, sent the French Military Mission to Poland to aid the Polish army. In early February in Paris, three pacts were discussed by Polish Chief of State Józef Piłsudski and French President Alexandre Millerand: political, military and economic.

The political alliance was signed there on February 19, 1921 by Polish Minister of Foreign Affairs Count Eustachy Sapieha and French Minister of Foreign Affairs Aristide Briand, in the background of the negotiations that ended the Polish–Soviet War by the Treaty of Riga. The agreement assumed a common foreign policy, the promotion of bilateral economical contacts, the consultation of new pacts concerning Central and Eastern Europe and assistance in case one of the signatories became a victim of an &quot;unprovoked&quot; attack. As such, it was a defensive alliance. The secret military pact was signed two days later, on February 21, 1921, and clarified that the agreement was aimed at possible threats from both Germany and the Soviet Union. An attack on Poland would make France keep lines of communication free and Germany in check but not require it to send troops or to declare war. Both political and military pacts were legally not in force until the economic pact was ratified, which occurred on August 2, 1923.

The alliance was further extended by the Franco–Polish Warrant Agreement, signed on October 16, 1925 in Locarno, as part of the Locarno Treaties. The new treaty subscribed all previously-signed Polish–French agreements to the system of mutual pacts of the League of Nations.

The alliance was closely tied with the Franco-Czechoslovakian Alliance. France&#x27;s alliances with Poland and Czechoslovakia were aimed at deterring Germany from the use of force to achieve a revision of the postwar settlement and ensuring that German forces would be confronted with significant combined strength of its neighbours. Although Czechoslovakia had a significant economy and industry and Poland had a strong army, the French–Polish–Czechoslovakian triangle never reached its full potential. Czechoslovakian foreign policy, under Edvard Beneš, avoided signing a formal alliance with Poland, which would force Czechoslovakia to take sides in Polish–German territorial disputes. Czechoslovakia&#x27;s influence was weakened by the doubts of its allies as to the trustworthiness of its army, and Poland&#x27;s influence was undermined by fighting between supporters and opponents of Józef Piłsudski. France&#x27;s reluctance to invest in its allies&#x27; industry (especially Poland&#x27;s), improve trade relations by buying their agricultural products and share military expertise further weakened the alliance.

In the 1930s, the alliance remained mostly inactive and its only effect was to keep the French Military Mission to Poland, which had worked with the Polish General Staff ever since the Polish–Soviet War of 1919–1920. However, with the German threat becoming increasingly visible in the latter part of the decade, both countries started to seek a new pact to guarantee the independence of all contracting parties and military co-operation in case of a war with Germany.

== 1939 ==
Finally, a new alliance started to be formed in 1939. The Kasprzycki–Gamelin Convention was signed May 19, 1939 in Paris. It was named after Polish Minister of War Affairs General Tadeusz Kasprzycki and Commander of the French Army Maurice Gamelin. The military convention was army-to-army, not state-to-state, and was not in force legally, as it was dependent on signing and ratification of the political convention. It obliged both armies to provide help to each other in case of a war with Germany. In May, Gamelin promised a &quot;bold relief offensive&quot; within three weeks of a German attack.

The treaty was ratified by France on September 4, 1939, on the fourth day of German offensive on Poland.

However, France provided only token help to Poland during the war in the form of the Saar Offensive, which has often been considered an example of Western betrayal. However, the political convention was the basis of the recreation of the Polish Army in France.

Piotr Zychowicz quoted the memoirs of the French ambassador to Poland, Léon Noël, who wrote as early as October 1938, &quot;It is of utmost importance that we remove from our obligations everything that would deprive French government the freedom of decision on the day when Poland finds itself in war with Germany&quot;. Foreign Minister Georges Bonnet reassured Noel by writing that &quot;our agreement with Poland is full of gaps, needed to keep our country away from war&quot;.
In March 1939, Britain and France guaranteed the independence of Poland. Hitler&#x27;s claims in the summer of 1939 on Danzig and the Polish Corridor provoked yet another international crisis. On August 25, Britain signed the Polish-British Common Defence Pact.

=== Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact ===
Nominally, the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact was a non-aggression treaty between Germany and the Soviet Union and was signed in Moscow on August 23, 1939, by Soviet Foreign Minister Vyacheslav Molotov and German Foreign Minister Joachim von Ribbentrop.

In 1939, neither Germany nor the Soviet Union was ready to go to war with each other. The Soviet Union had lost territory to Poland in 1920. Although officially called a &quot;non-aggression treaty,&quot; the pact included a secret protocol in which the independent countries of Finland, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland and Romania were divided into spheres of interest between both the parties. The secret protocol explicitly assumed &quot;territorial and political rearrangements&quot; in those areas.

All of the mentioned countries were invaded, occupied, or forced to cede part of their territory by the Soviet Union, Germany or both. Finland and Romania maintained their independence, however being forced to cede parts of their territory.

The conflict between the Soviet Union and Finland had a great impact of assessing the former&#x27;s military capabilities by Nazi Germany.

==Declarations of war==
===Invasion of Poland===
Between 1919 and 1939, Poland had pursued a policy of balancing between the Soviet Union and Nazi Germany and agreed to non-aggression pacts with both. In early 1939, Germany demanded for Poland to join the Anti-Comintern Pact as a satellite state of Germany. Poland, fearing a loss of independence, refused. Hitler admitted to his generals on 23 May 1939 that his reason for invading Poland was not Danzig: &quot;Danzig is not the issue at stake. It is a matter of extending our living space in the East...&quot;. To deter Hitler, Britain and France announced that an invasion would mean war and tried to convince the Soviet Union to join in this deterrence. The Soviets, however, gained control of the Baltic states and part of Poland by allying with Germany by the secret Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact in August 1939. London&#x27;s attempt at deterrence failed, but Hitler did not expect a wider war. Germany invaded Poland on September 1, 1939, and rejected the British and French demands for it to withdraw, which resulted in both to declare war on September 3, 1939, in accordance with the defence treaties with Poland that they had signed and publicly announced. However neither France nor Britain provided significant military aid to Poland except small operation known as Saar offensive. As of 1 September 1939 Poland was only partially mobilized, which was largely the result of pressure from the British and French ambassadors on the Polish government, fearing a repeat of the mobilization scenario of war from 1914. The Wehrmacht also had advantage in terms of the number of tanks and planes and the technical advancement of its equipment.

On September 17, 1939, the Red Army entered Poland from the east, and the Polish Command decided to abandon the defense of the so-called Romanian Bridgehead and evacuate of all its forces to neighboring countries. The last larger unit of Polish troops capitulated on October 6, 1939, near Kock, but some units went straight to partisan combat. Until the spring of 1940, the resistance of irregular units in the region of the Świętokrzyskie Mountains in central Poland lasted, but the struggle of these units resulted in enormous repressions against the civilian population of the region in which they operated.

===Invasion of the Soviet Union===

Germany attacked the Soviet Union in June 1941. Hitler believed that the Soviet Union could be defeated in a fast and relentless assault that capitalised on the Soviets&#x27; ill-prepared state and he hoped that his success there would bring Britain to the negotiating table, an event which would end the war altogether.

===Attacks on Pearl Harbor, the Philippines, British Malaya, Singapore and Hong Kong===

The US government and general public in general had been supportive of China, condemned European colonialist policies and Japan and promoted the so-called Open Door Policy. Many Americans viewed the Japanese as an aggressive and/or inferior race. The Nationalist government of Chiang Kai-shek held friendly relations with the US, which opposed Japan&#x27;s invasion of China in 1937 and considered it a violation of international law and of the sovereignty of the Republic of China. The US offered the Nationalist government diplomatic, economic and military assistance during its war against Japan. Diplomatic friction between the United States and Japan manifested itself in events like the Panay incident in 1937 and the Allison incident in 1938.
Reacting to Japanese pressure on French authorities of French Indochina to stop trade with China, the US began restricting trade with Japan in July 1940. The end of all oil shipments in 1941 was decisive since the Americans, British and Dutch provided almost all of Japan&#x27;s oil. In September 1940, the Japanese invaded Vichy French Indochina and occupied Tonkin to prevent China from importing arms and fuel through French Indochina along the Sino-Vietnamese Railway from the port of Haiphong through Hanoi to Kunming, in Yunnan. The US decided that the Japanese had now gone too far and decided to force a rollback of its gains. In 1940 and 1941, the Americans and the Chinese decided to organise a volunteer squadron of American planes and pilots to attack the Japanese from Chinese bases. Known as the Flying Tigers, the unit was commanded by Claire Lee Chennault. Its first combat came two weeks after the attack on Pearl Harbor.

Taking advantage of the situation, Thailand launched the Franco-Thai War in October 1940. Japan stepped in as a mediator in the war in May 1941 and allowed its ally to occupy the bordering provinces in Cambodia and Laos. In July 1941, as Operation Barbarossa had effectively neutralised the Soviet threat, the faction of the Japanese military junta supporting the &quot;Southern Strategy&quot; pushed through the occupation of the rest of French Indochina.

The US reacted by seeking to bring the Japanese war effort to a complete halt by imposing a full embargo on all trade between the United States to Japan on August 18, 1941, and demanding a Japanese withdrawal of all troops from China and Indochina. Japan was dependent on the United States for 80% of its oil, which resulted in an economic and military crisis for Japan since it could not continue the war effort against China without access to petroleum and oil products.
On 7 December 1941, without a declaration of war, the Imperial Japanese Navy attacked Pearl Harbor with the aim of destroying the main American battle fleet at anchor. Meanwhile, other Japanese forces attacked the American-held Philippines and the British Empire in Malaya, Singapore, and Hong Kong. The following day, an official Japanese declaration of war on the United States and the British Empire was printed on the front page of all Japanese newspapers&#x27; evening editions. International time differences caused the announcement to take place between midnight and 3 a.m. on 8 December in North America and at about 8 a.m. on 8 December in the United Kingdom.

Canada declared war on Japan on the evening of 7 December, and a royal proclamation affirmed the declaration the next day. The British declared war on Japan on the morning of 8 December and specifically identified the attacks on Malaya, Singapore and Hong Kong as the cause but omitted any mention of Pearl Harbor. The United States declared war upon Japan on the afternoon of 8 December, nine hours after the United Kingdom, and identified only &quot;unprovoked acts of war against the Government and the people of the United States of America&quot; as the cause.

Four days later, the US was brought into the European war when on December 11, 1941, Nazi Germany and Fascist Italy declared war on the United States. Hitler chose to declare that the Tripartite Pact required Germany to follow Japan&#x27;s declaration of war although American destroyers escorting convoys and German U-boats had been &quot;de facto&quot; at war in the Battle of the Atlantic. The declaration of war effectively ended US isolationist sentiment, and the country immediately reciprocated and so formally entered the war in Europe.

<text>Dáil Éireann (), also called the Revolutionary Dáil, was the revolutionary, unicameral parliament of the Irish Republic from 1919 to 1922. The Dáil was first formed on 21 January 1919 in Dublin by 69 Sinn Féin MPs elected in the 1918 United Kingdom general election, who had won 73 seats of the 105 seats in Ireland, with four party candidates (Arthur Griffith, Éamon de Valera, Eoin MacNeill and Liam Mellows) elected for two constituencies. Their manifesto refused to recognise the British parliament at Westminster and instead established an independent legislature in Dublin. The convention of the First Dáil coincided with the beginning of the War of Independence.

The First Dáil was replaced by the Second Dáil in 1921. Both of these &quot;Dála&quot; existed under the proclaimed Irish Republic; it was the Second Dáil which narrowly ratified the Anglo-Irish Treaty. The status of the Third Dáil of 1922–1923 was different as it was also recognised by the British. It was elected under the terms of the 1921 Anglo-Irish Treaty as a provisional parliament to pave the way for the creation of an independent Irish state. With the establishment of the Irish Free State in 1922, a new parliament called the Oireachtas was established, of which Dáil Éireann became the lower house.

==History==

=== First Dáil (1919–1921) ===
In the 1918 general election a large majority of 73 (25 uncontested) out of 105 representatives returned in Ireland were members of the Sinn Féin party. In accordance with their manifesto, these representatives gathered in the Mansion House on 21 January 1919 for the first meeting of new assembly called Dáil Éireann. Owing to many of its number being in prison, only 27 TDs (MPs) were able to attend. At its first meeting the Dáil issued a Declaration of Independence, declared itself the parliament of the Irish Republic and adopted a short constitution.

On the same day, but in unconnected circumstances, two members of the Royal Irish Constabulary were ambushed and killed by Irish Volunteers at Soloheadbeg in Tipperary, acting on their own initiative. In this way the Irish War of Independence began. Shortly afterwards the Irish Volunteers were renamed to the Irish Republican Army, a force nominally under the control of the Dáil. In August the Dáil was declared illegal by the British government and thereafter met only intermittently and in secret. 

=== Second Dáil (1921–1922) ===
In May 1921, elections were called in Ireland to two new bodies established by the British government. These were the Parliaments of Northern Ireland and Southern Ireland. These legislatures were brought into being by the Government of Ireland Act 1920 in a vain attempt to placate nationalists by granting Ireland a limited form of home rule. However, both parliaments were rejected and boycotted by Sinn Féin, who instead treated them as elections to Dáil Éireann and continued as the Irish Republic.

The Second Dáil (made up of Sinn Féin members elected to the northern and southern parliaments envisaged by the British) met in August 1921 and in September it agreed to send envoys to negotiate a peace settlement with the British government. These envoys returned from England with the Anglo-Irish Treaty which, after prolonged and acrimonious debate, was narrowly ratified by the Dáil on 7 January 1922.

=== Third Dáil (1922–1923) ===
To implement the Anglo-Irish Treaty the Third Dáil was elected in September 1922. This Dáil was not recognised under British law as Dáil Éireann but merely as a provisional assembly. Unlike previous &quot;Dála&quot;, the Third Dáil did not include members elected in Northern Ireland. The election was effectively a referendum on the Anglo-Irish Treaty in the southern partition of Ireland but the pro-treaty members of Sinn Féin won a majority of seats. After this result the anti-treaty faction refused to recognise the new assembly and the Irish Civil War followed shortly afterwards.

In October, acting as a constituent assembly under British Law, the Third Dáil ratified the Constitution of the Irish Free State. The new state was officially established in December and thereafter the Third Dáil served, not as a unicameral parliament, but rather as the lower house of new parliament called the Oireachtas. It was dissolved in August 1923.

== Constitutional and symbolic role ==
Until the conclusion of the Anglo-Irish Treaty in 1921 it was the mission of Dáil Éireann to create a parallel system of government in Ireland that would gain the allegiance of the public and eventually supplant the British state. Some success was achieved in this goal. For example, the Dáil was able to persuade many Irish people to boycott the British judicial system and instead seek justice in a network of Dáil Courts. Nonetheless, the Irish Republic was not quite a true &quot;de facto&quot; state and received no support among the Unionist majority in North-East Ireland.

However, for its members the role of Dáil Éireann was symbolic as well as concrete. By winning the 1918 general election they were able to claim that the Dáil was the legitimate parliament of Ireland, and that from the Dáil they derived legal authority to wage war against British rule. This was not merely an abstract philosophical point. At this time many Irish people were devout Catholics whose church taught that war was sinful unless waged by a legitimated authority and for a just cause. Part of the reason for convening Dáil Éireann was therefore to satisfy the requirements of and to make it easier to win the support of clergymen which in turn was thought a necessary prerequisite to win the support of the general public.

The Dáil Constitution adopted in 1919 was a brief, provisional document that placed few limitations on the power of the Dáil and could, in any case, be amended by a simple vote. Under the constitution the executive of the republic consisted of a cabinet led by an official called both the President of Dáil Éireann and the . In 1921 the constitution amended to rename this official as President of the Republic and make him head of state.

At all times the Republic&#x27;s executive consisted of members of the Dáil and was theoretically answerable to it. The most important tasks of ministers were to command the Irish Republican Army (IRA) and, during 1921, to communicate and conduct negotiations with the British government. While notionally answerable to the cabinet, in practice individual IRA units enjoyed a high degree of autonomy.

After the election of the Third Dáil in 1922 the role of the Dáil changed substantially. Under the Anglo-Irish Treaty this body was intended to prepare the ground for the creation of an independent state called the Irish Free State. Powers were therefore progressively transferred to it from the British administration over a short period. The Third Dáil also had the role of acting as a &quot;constituent assembly&quot; to adopt the new Free State constitution.

The Irish Republic and its cabinet continued to exist right up until the Irish Free State came into force, though under British law the Third Dáil was charged with electing an executive called the &quot;Provisional Government&quot;. For a time, until they were effectively merged, this Provisional Government and the old republican administration existed side by side, with significant overlaps in membership.

Today the First and Second &quot;Dála&quot; continue to have symbolic importance for the most radical Irish republicans. The general election of 1918 was the last occasion on which a single general election occurred across the whole island of Ireland and is seen by these republicans as granting a mandate for violent resistance to British rule in Northern Ireland that is unextinguished even to this day.

Because the Third Dáil and its successors have not been elected on an all-Ireland basis, in republican ideology they have not been legitimate. In this view, the Second Dáil has never been dissolved and those (minority) of members of the Second Dáil who rejected the Anglo-Irish Treaty have granted themselves the authority to continue the armed struggle. This view is known as Irish Republican legitimatism.

<doc id="765652" wikidata="Q1102226" url="?curid=765652" title="Cloisonné">
<text>Cloisonné () is an ancient technique for decorating metalwork objects with colored material held in place or separated by metal strips or wire, normally of gold. In recent centuries, vitreous enamel has been used, but inlays of cut gemstones, glass and other materials were also used during older periods; indeed cloisonné enamel very probably began as an easier imitation of cloisonné work using gems. The resulting objects can also be called cloisonné. The decoration is formed by first adding compartments (&quot;cloisons&quot; in French) to the metal object by soldering or affixing silver or gold as wires or thin strips placed on their edges. These remain visible in the finished piece, separating the different compartments of the enamel or inlays, which are often of several colors. Cloisonné enamel objects are worked on with enamel powder made into a paste, which then needs to be fired in a kiln. If gemstones or colored glass are used, the pieces need to be cut or ground into the shape of each cloison.

In antiquity, the cloisonné technique was mostly used for jewellery and small fittings for clothes, weapons or similar small objects decorated with geometric or schematic designs, with thick cloison walls. In the Byzantine Empire techniques using thinner wires were developed to allow more pictorial images to be produced, mostly used for religious images and jewellery, and by then always using enamel. This was used in Europe, especially in Carolingian and Ottonian art. By the 14th century this enamel technique had been replaced in Europe by champlevé, but had then spread to China, where it was soon used for much larger vessels such as bowls and vases; the technique remains common in China to the present day, and &quot;cloisonné&quot; enamel objects using Chinese-derived styles were produced in the West from the 18th century.

In Middle Byzantine architecture cloisonné masonry refers to walls built with a regular mix of stone and brick, often with more of the latter. The 11th or 12th-century Pammakaristos Church in Istanbul is an example.


==History==
===Ancient world===
Cloisonné first developed in the jewellery of the ancient Near East, and the earliest enamel all used the cloisonné technique, placing the enamel within small cells with gold walls. This had been used as a technique to hold pieces of stone and gems tightly in place since the 3rd millennium BC, for example in Mesopotamia, and then Egypt. Enamel seems likely to have developed as a cheaper method of achieving similar results.

The earliest undisputed objects known to use enamel are a group of Mycenaean rings from Graves in Cyprus, dated to the 12th century BC, and using very thin wire.

In the jewellery of ancient Egypt, including the pectoral jewels of the pharaohs, thicker strips form the cloisons, which remain small. In Egypt gemstones and enamel-like materials sometimes called &quot;glass-paste&quot; were both used. Although Egyptian pieces, including jewellery from the Tomb of Tutankhamun of , are frequently described as using &quot;enamel&quot;, many scholars doubt the glass paste was sufficiently melted to be properly so described, and use terms such as &quot;glass-paste&quot;. It seems possible that in Egyptian conditions the melting point of the glass and gold were too close to make enamel a viable technique. Nonetheless, there appear to be a few actual examples of enamel, perhaps from the Third Intermediate Period of Egypt (beginning 1070 BC) on. But it remained rare in both Egypt and Greece.

The technique appears in the Koban culture of the northern and central Caucasus, and was perhaps carried by the Sarmatians to the ancient Celts, but they essentially used the champlevé technique. Subsequently, enamel was just one of the fillings used for the small, thick-walled cloisons of the Late Antique and Migration Period style. At Sutton Hoo, the Anglo-Saxon pieces mostly use garnet cloisonné, but this is sometimes combined with enamel in the same piece. A problem that adds to the uncertainty over early enamel is artefacts (typically excavated) that appear to have been prepared for enamel, but have now lost whatever filled the cloisons. This occurs in several different regions, from ancient Egypt to Anglo-Saxon England. Once enamel becomes more common, as in medieval Europe after about 1000, the assumption that enamel was originally used becomes safer.

===Byzantium and Europe===
The Byzantines perfected a unique form of cloisonné icons. Byzantine enamel spread to surrounding cultures and a particular type, often known as &quot;garnet cloisonné&quot; is widely found in the Migration Period art of the &quot;barbarian&quot; peoples of Europe, who used gemstones, especially red garnets, as well as glass and enamel, with small thick-walled cloisons. Red garnets and gold made an attractive contrast of colours, and for Christians the garnet was a symbol of Christ. This type is now thought to have originated in the Late Antique Eastern Roman Empire and to have initially reached the Migration peoples as diplomatic gifts of objects probably made in Constantinople, then copied by their own goldsmiths. Glass-paste &quot;cloisonné&quot; was made in the same periods with similar results – compare the gold Anglo-Saxon fitting with garnets (right) and the Visigothic brooch with glass-paste in the gallery. Thick ribbons of gold were soldered to the base of the sunken area to be decorated to make the compartments, before adding the stones or paste. In the Byzantine world the technique was developed into the thin-wire style suitable only for enamel described below, which was imitated in Europe from about the Carolingian period onwards.
The dazzling technique of the Anglo-Saxon dress fittings from Sutton Hoo include much garnet cloisonné, some using remarkably thin slices, enabling the patterned gold beneath to be seen. There is also imported millefiori glass cut to fit like the gems. Sometimes compartments filled with the different materials of cut stones or glass and enamel are mixed to ornament the same object, as in the Sutton Hoo purse-lid.

From about the 8th century, Byzantine art began again to use much thinner wire more freely to allow much more complex designs to be used, with larger and less geometric compartments, which was only possible using enamel. These were still on relatively small objects, although numbers of plaques could be set into larger objects, such as the Pala d&#x27;Oro, the altarpiece in Saint Mark&#x27;s Cathedral, Venice. Some objects combined thick and thin cloisons for varied effect. The designs often (as at right) contained a generous background of plain gold, as in contemporary Byzantine mosaics. The area to be enamelled was stamped to create the main depression, pricked to help the enamel adhere, and the cloisons added.

Two different techniques in Byzantine and European cloisonné enamel are distinguished, for which the German names are still typically used in English. The earliest is the Vollschmelz (&quot;full&quot; enamel, literally &quot;full melt&quot;) technique where the whole of a gold base plate is to be covered in enamel. The edges of the plate are turned up to form a reservoir, and gold wires are soldered in place to form the &quot;cloisons&quot;. The enamel design therefore covers the whole plate. In the Senkschmelz (&quot;sunk&quot; enamel, literally &quot;sunk melt&quot;) technique the parts of the base plate to hold the design are hammered down, leaving a surrounding gold background, as also seen in contemporary Byzantine icons and mosaics with gold glass backgrounds, and the saint illustrated here. The wires and enamels are then added as before. The outline of the design will be apparent on the reverse of the base plate. The transition between the two techniques occurs around 900 in Byzantine enamel, and 1000 in the West, though with important earlier examples.

The plaques with apostles of around the latter date on the Holy Crown of Hungary show a unique transitional phase, where the base plaque has hammered recesses for the design, as in &quot;senkschmelz&quot; work, but the enamel covers the whole plaque except for thick outlines around the figures and inscriptions, as in the &quot;vollschmelz&quot; technique (see the gallery below for examples of this technique and &quot;vollschmelz&quot; work). Some 10th-century pieces achieve a &quot;senkschmelz&quot; effect by using two plates superimposed on each other, the upper one with the design outline cut out and the lower one left plain.
In medieval Western Europe cloisonné enamel technique was gradually overtaken by the rise of champlevé enamel, where the spaces for the enamel to fill are created by making recesses (using various methods) into the base object, rather than building up compartments from it, as in cloisonné. This happened during the 11th century in most centres in Western Europe, though not in Byzantium; the Stavelot Triptych, Mosan art of around 1156, contains both types, but the inner cloisonné sections were probably gifts from Constantinople. Champlevé allowed increased expressiveness, especially in human figures, and was also cheaper, as the metal base was usually just copper and if gold was used, it was generally to gild surrounding bare metal. In turn champlevé was replaced by the 14th or 15th century by painted enamels, once techniques were evolved that allowed the enamel to be painted onto a flat background without running. Limoges enamel was a great centre for both types.

Plique-à-jour is a related enameling technique which uses clear enamels and no metal backplate, producing an object that has the appearance of a miniature stained glass object - in effect cloisonné with no backing. Plique-a&#x27;-jour is usually created on a base of mica or thin copper which is subsequently peeled off (mica) or etched away with acid (copper). In the Renaissance the extravagant style of pieces effectively of plique-à-jour backed onto glass or rock crystal was developed, but was never very common.

Other ways of using the technique have been developed, but are of minor importance. In 19th century Japan it was used on pottery vessels with ceramic glazes, and it has been used with lacquer and modern acrylic fillings for the cloisons. A version of cloisonné technique is often used for lapel badges, logo badges for many objects such as cars, including BMW models, and other applications, though in these the metal base is normally cast with the compartments in place, so the use of the term cloisonné, though common, is questionable. That technique is correctly referred to by goldsmiths, metalsmiths and enamellists as champlevé.

===China===

From Byzantium or the Islamic world the technique reached China in the 13–14th centuries; the first written reference is in a book of 1388, where it is called &quot;Dashi ware&quot;. No Chinese pieces clearly from the 14th century are known, the earliest datable pieces being from the reign of the Xuande Emperor (1425–35), which however show a full use of Chinese styles suggesting considerable experience in the technique. It was initially regarded with suspicion by Chinese connoisseurs, firstly as being foreign, and secondly as appealing to feminine taste. However, by the beginning of the 18th century the Kangxi Emperor had a &quot;cloisonné&quot; workshop among the many Imperial factories. The most elaborate and highly valued Chinese pieces are from the early Ming Dynasty, especially the reigns of the Xuande Emperor and Jingtai Emperor (1450–57), although 19th century or modern pieces are far more common. The Chinese industry seems to have benefited from a number of skilled Byzantine refugees fleeing the Fall of Constantinople in 1453, although based on the name alone, it is far more likely China obtained knowledge of the technique from the middle east. In much Chinese &quot;cloisonné&quot; blue is usually the predominant colour, and the Chinese name for the technique, &quot;jingtailan&quot; (&quot;Jingtai blue ware&quot;), refers to this, and the Jingtai Emperor. Quality began to decline in the 19th century. Initially heavy bronze or brass bodies were used, and the wires soldered, but later much lighter copper vessels were used, and the wire glued on before firing. The enamels compositions and the pigments change with time.

Chinese &quot;cloisonné&quot; is sometimes confused with Canton enamel, a type of painted enamel on copper that is more closely related to overglaze enamels on Chinese porcelain, or enamelled glass. This is painted on freehand and so does not use partitions to hold the colours separate.

In Byzantine pieces, and even more in Chinese work, the wire by no means always encloses a separate color of enamel. Sometime a wire is used just for decorative effect, stopping in the middle of a field of enamel, and sometimes the boundary between two enamel colors is not marked by a wire. In the Byzantine plaque at right the first feature may be seen in the top wire on the saint&#x27;s black sleeve, and the second in the white of his eyes and collar. Both are also seen in the Chinese bowl illustrated at top right.

===Japan===

The Japanese also produced large quantities from the mid-19th century, of very high technical quality. During the Meiji era, Japanese cloisonné enamel reached a technical peak, producing items more advanced than any that had existed before. The period from 1890 to 1910 was known as the &quot;Golden age&quot; of Japanese enamels. An early centre of &quot;cloisonné&quot; was Nagoya during the Owari Domain, with the Ando Cloisonné Company the leading producer. Later centres were Kyoto and Edo, and Kyoto resident Namikawa Yasuyuki and Tokyo (renamed from Edo) resident Namikawa Sōsuke exhibited their works at World&#x27;s fair and won many awards. In Kyoto Namikawa became one of the leading companies of Japanese &quot;cloisonné&quot;. The Namikawa Yasuyuki Cloisonné Museum is specifically dedicated to it. In Japan &quot;cloisonné&quot; enamels are known as &quot;shippō-yaki&quot; (七宝焼). Japanese enamels were regarded as unequalled thanks to the new achievements in design and colouring.

===Russia===

The first Russian &quot;cloisonné&quot; developed from Byzantine models during the period of Kievan Rus, and has mainly survived in religious pieces. Kiev was perhaps the only centre. The industry stopped with the Mongol invasion of Russia but revived in Novgorod by the end of the 14th century, now using champlevé. Cloisonné barely returned until the 19th century, when it was used in revivalist styles by the House of Fabergé and Khlebnikov. Fabergé developed a style of raised and contoured metal shapes rising from the base plate, which were filled, though more thinly than in most cloisonné (effectively painted), leaving the metal edges clear. This is usually called cloisonné or &quot;raised cloisonné&quot;, though the appropriateness of the term might be disputed, as in other types of cloisonné the surface is smooth, which is not the case with these.

==Modern process==

First the object to be decorated is made or obtained; this will normally be made by different craftspeople. The metal usually used for making the body is copper, since it is cheap, light and easily hammered and stretched, but gold, silver or other metals may be used. &quot;Cloisonné&quot; wire is made from fine silver or fine gold and is usually about .010 x .040 inches in cross section. It is bent into shapes that define the colored areas. The bends are all done at right angles, so that the wire does not curve up. This is done with small pliers, tweezers, and custom-made jigs. The &quot;cloisonné&quot; wire pattern may consist of several intricately constructed wire patterns that fit together into a larger design. Solder can be used to join the wires, but this causes the enamel to discolour and form bubbles later on. Most existing Byzantine enamels have soldered cloisons, however the use of solder to adhere the cloison wires has fallen out of favor due to its difficulty, with the exception of some &quot;purist contemporary enamellists&quot; who create fine watch faces and high quality very expensive jewelry. Instead of soldering the cloisons to the base metal, the base metal is fired with a thin layer of clear enamel. The &quot;cloisonné&quot; wire is glued to the enamel surface with gum tragacanth. When the gum has dried, the piece is fired again to fuse the &quot;cloisonné&quot; wire to the clear enamel. The gum burns off, leaving no residue.

Vitreous enamels in the different colors are ground to fine powders in an agate or porcelain mortar and pestle, then washed to remove the impurities that would discolor the fired enamel. The enamel is made from silica, niter, and lead oxide to which metallic oxides are added for coloring. These ingredients are melted together, forming a glassy frit which is ground again before application. Each color of enamel is prepared this way before it is used and then mixed with a very dilute solution of gum tragacanth. Using fine spatulas, brushes or droppers, the enameler places the fine colored powder into each cloison. The piece is left to dry completely before firing, which is done by putting the article, with its enamel fillings, in a kiln. The enamel in the cloisons will sink down a lot after firing, due to melting and shrinkage of the granular nature of the glass powder, much as sugar melting in an oven. This process is repeated until all cloisons are filled to the top of the wire edge.

Three styles of &quot;cloisonné&quot; are most often seen: concave, convex, and flat. The finishing method determines this final appearance. With concave &quot;cloisonné&quot; the cloisons are not completely filled. Capillary action causes the enamel surface to curve up against the &quot;cloisonné&quot; wire when the enamel is molten, producing a concave appearance. Convex cloissoné is produced by overfilling each cloison, at the last firing. This gives each color area the appearance of slightly rounded mounds. Flat &quot;cloisonné&quot; is the most common. After all the cloisons are filled the enamel is ground down to a smooth surface with lapidary equipment, using the same techniques as are used for polishing cabochon stones. The top of the &quot;cloisonné&quot; wire is polished so it is flush with the enamel and has a bright lustre. Some &quot;cloisonné&quot; wire is electroplated with a thin film of gold, which will not tarnish as silver does.

== Collections ==
Collections of Japanese cloisonné enamels are held at major museums including the Victoria and Albert Museum in London, the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York, and the Los Angeles County Museum of Art. The Namikawa Yasuyuki Cloisonné Museum in Kyoto is dedicated to the technique. A collection of 150 Chinese cloisonné pieces is at the G.W. Vincent Smith Art Museum in Springfield, Massachusetts. The Khalili Collection of Japanese Meiji Art includes 107 cloisonné enamel art works, including many works by Namikawa Yasuyuki, Namikawa Sosuke, and Ando Jubei. Researchers have used the collection to establish a chronology of the development of Japanese enamelling.

<text>KTTV (channel 11) is a television station in Los Angeles, California, United States, serving as the West Coast flagship station of the Fox network. It is owned and operated by the network&#x27;s Fox Television Stations division alongside MyNetworkTV outlet KCOP-TV (channel 13). The two stations share studios at the Fox Television Center in West Los Angeles; KTTV&#x27;s transmitter is located atop Mount Wilson.

==History==
===Early years (1947–1954)===
KTTV&#x27;s origins can be traced to 1947, when the station&#x27;s license and construction permit was secured by the Times Mirror Company, publishers of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;. It was one of five licenses that were granted simultaneously by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to parties interested in expanding commercial television in Los Angeles. In 1948, CBS, which owned KNX radio, purchased a 49% interest in the station and assisted in completing its construction in exchange for making channel 11 the network&#x27;s Los Angeles television outlet. KTTV began operations on January 1, 1949, and was operated initially by KTTV, Incorporated, the &quot;Times&quot;/CBS-owned holding company. The station&#x27;s first telecast was the Tournament of Roses Parade, which channel 11 would air every New Year&#x27;s Day until 1995.

In May 1950, Times-Mirror purchased the Nassour Studios – a large motion picture facility on Sunset Boulevard in Hollywood, and centralized KTTV&#x27;s operations there. CBS did not join Times-Mirror in the purchase; at the time its West Coast production facilities were based at Columbia Square, with its CBS Television City facility in the planning stages. KTTV converted the Nassour Studios into a major production house for television, producing programs locally and for the emerging syndication market. Prior to the move, KTTV operated out of several different facilities, including the former headquarters of Capitol Records (which was later the longtime home of KHJ radio and what is now KCAL-TV) on Melrose Avenue.

Later in 1950, CBS chose to acquire its own station in Los Angeles – pioneer station KTSL (channel 2, renamed KNXT and now KCBS-TV) – which was being spun off by the Don Lee Broadcasting System as a result of its sale to General Tire and Rubber. The KTSL purchase forced CBS to divest its interest in KTTV due to FCC rules in effect at the time that barred the common ownership of two television stations in the same media market; the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; would regain full ownership of channel 11 when the sales were finalized on January 1, 1951. KTTV&#x27;s relationship with CBS ended after exactly two years as the network moved its programming to KTSL. A few months later, channel 11 agreed to become the new Los Angeles outlet of the DuMont Television Network, which had been affiliated with KTSL, and before that KTLA (channel 5).

===Independence (1954–1986)===
In 1954, DuMont moved its programming to KHJ-TV (channel 9, now KCAL-TV), and KTTV became an independent station. During the late 1950s, the station was also briefly affiliated with the NTA Film Network. In 1958, channel 11 scored an advantage against its rivals when it became the television home of the Los Angeles Dodgers baseball team, which had relocated from Brooklyn, New York, that year. For the first 11 years and at the request of the team, KTTV&#x27;s Dodger telecasts were limited to road games against the archrival San Francisco Giants. Eventually, the number of Dodger games broadcast on the station increased and the home game blackout was lifted; the relationship between KTTV and the Dodgers would last until the end of the 1992 season.

The show &quot;Confidential File&quot; on KTTV covered the 1962 convention of the Daughters of Bilitis and aired after &quot;Confidential File&quot; became syndicated nationally; this was probably the first American national broadcast that specifically covered lesbianism.

The Times-Mirror Company sold the station to Metromedia in 1963. Later that year, Metromedia purchased KLAC (570 AM) and the original KLAC-FM (102.7 FM, now KIIS-FM), giving channel 11 sister stations on the radio dial. Metromedia would later engineer a trade of FM frequencies, resulting in KLAC-FM moving to 94.7 FM (later to become KMET, now KTWV) in 1965.

By the 1970s, KTTV offered a traditional general entertainment schedule common among independent stations at the time, consisting of children&#x27;s programs, off-network reruns, sports programming and old movies, along with a 10 p.m. newscast. Some of the staff members in the earlier 1970s were John Jones, Sales Manager; George Putnam, news anchorman; Putnam&#x27;s co-anchor Hal Fishman; Ken Jones, first black on-air TV newsman in L.A.; Tom Kelly, TV sports reporter; Terry Mayo, noontime news; and Rona Barrett, who taped her syndicated gossip report at KTTV, written by assistant Barbara Sternig. With the evolution of cable television, KTTV became a regional superstation. Thanks to its Dodgers broadcasts and round-the-clock programming, KTTV was seen on various cable systems across the Western United States during the 1970s and into the 1980s, as far east as El Paso, Texas. KTLA, with its Angels broadcasts, also became a superstation. KTTV and KTLA were seen on most Southern and Central California cable systems, with KHJ-TV and KCOP also getting carried outside Los Angeles to a lesser extent.

In 1973, as part of an agreement signed with four citizen groups and filed with the station&#x27;s renewal application, KTTV began banning 42 violent animated series, most notably &quot;Popeye&quot;, &quot;Superman&quot;, &quot;Batman&quot; and &quot;Aquaman&quot;, while applying a &quot;caution to parents&quot; warning to 81 violent live-action series shown before 8:30 p.m., most notably &quot;The Outer Limits&quot;.

===As a Fox-owned station (1986–present)===
In 1986, Australian newspaper publisher Rupert Murdoch and his company, the News Corporation (which had acquired a controlling ownership interest in the 20th Century Fox film studio the year before), purchased KTTV and the other Metromedia television stations. The Metromedia stations ended up becoming part of a new holding company formed by News Corporation called Fox Television Stations; those stations formed the basis for the new Fox Broadcasting Company television network, which made its debut on October 9, 1986. Following the News Corporation purchase, KTTV added more first-run syndicated talk, court and reality shows. By the early 1990s, it began to run afternoon cartoons from the network&#x27;s Fox Kids block (which debuted in 1990), as well as top-rated off-network sitcoms during the evening hours. KTTV removed cartoons on weekday mornings in June 1993, due to the launch of the morning newscast &quot;Good Day L.A.&quot;

In 2001, Fox Television Stations acquired several UPN affiliates owned by Chris-Craft Industries through its BHC Communications station group, creating a duopoly between KTTV and KCOP-TV (channel 13). That fall, channel 11 dropped the Fox Kids weekday block and moved it to KCOP; Fox Kids discontinued its weekday block altogether in January 2002, with the lineup left airing only on Saturday mornings. Since the 4Kids block was replaced by Fox with the infomercial block &quot;Weekend Marketplace&quot; in December 2008, the station now airs five hours of educational programming, two more than required under FCC guidelines, as &quot;Xploration Station&quot; replaced &quot;Weekend Marketplace&quot;, which moved to KCOP, in September 2014.

KTTV also airs reruns of &quot;I Love Lucy&quot;, which had premiered in 1951, months after the station lost its CBS affiliation. Reruns of the sitcom are still popular among Southern California viewers and have continued to air in the Los Angeles market perpetually since the series ended its run in 1957, thus making KTTV only the second station in the market (the other being KCBS-TV) to continue airing the sitcom since it ended. Weekday airings of &quot;I Love Lucy&quot; have since moved to KCOP (which airs the program in a one-hour block), but KTTV continues to air the landmark sitcom on weekends during the late afternoon hours.

In 1996, KTTV relocated its longtime studios on Sunset Boulevard in Hollywood, known as &quot;Metromedia Square&quot; (and later renamed the &quot;Fox Television Center&quot;) to a new studio facility a few miles away on South Bundy Drive in West Los Angeles, near the Fox network headquarters (the network&#x27;s headquarters are located on the 20th Century Fox studio lot). Several television series were filmed at the historic Metromedia Square television studio (which was once home to Norman Lear&#x27;s Tandem Productions and TAT Communications Company) such as &quot;The Jeffersons&quot;, &quot;Mama&#x27;s Family&quot;, &quot;Diff&#x27;rent Strokes&quot;, &quot;One Day at a Time&quot;, &quot;Soul Train&quot;, &quot;Mary Hartman, Mary Hartman&quot;, &quot;Fernwood 2 Night&quot; and the groundbreaking sketch comedy &quot;In Living Color&quot;. Many of those programs, either in first-run or off-network syndication, aired on KTTV. The Metromedia complex was demolished in 2003 to make way for the construction of Helen Bernstein High School (which is part of the Los Angeles Unified School District).

On May 16, 2006, KTTV launched a new website based on Fox Television Stations&#x27; &quot;MyFox&quot; interface; this format became standard on the websites of each of the Fox-owned stations – and was even adopted by some of Fox&#x27;s affiliates not owned by the network – by the end of that year (the &quot;MyFox&quot; branded websites were operated by former News Corporation subsidiary EndPlay until 2012, when the sites were migrated to the WorldNow platform).

KTTV launched the Light TV network on a subchannel starting December 22, 2016, with another Fox TV station, WNYW.

On December 14, 2017, The Walt Disney Company, owner of ABC and KABC-TV, announced its intent to buy KTTV&#x27;s parent company, 21st Century Fox, for $52.4 billion; the sale excluded the Fox Television Stations unit (including KTTV and KCOP), the Fox network, Fox News, Fox Sports 1 and the MyNetworkTV programming service, which were transferred to a separate company.

==Programming==
===Sports programming===
Since the team&#x27;s move to Los Angeles in 1958 (with exception of a brief pause from 1993 to 1995), KTTV has carried Los Angeles Dodgers baseball games from varying sources; the station aired road games beginning in the late 1970s with the home games on the subscription/pay-per-view service Dodgervision; these road games aired on the station until 1992, when KTLA began airing the road games beginning with the 1993 season. Currently, select Dodger games are broadcast nationally through the network&#x27;s sports division via its MLB package since 1996. KTTV has also aired the Dodgers&#x27; 2017, 2018, 2020, and 2024 World Series appearances, including the team&#x27;s championship victories in 2020 (their first title in 32 years) and 2024. All other Dodger games are currently broadcast locally through SportsNet LA. KTTV also airs any Angels games that are aired through Fox&#x27;s MLB contract, including the team&#x27;s World Series victory in 2002. Since 2024, KTTV broadcasts select Anaheim Ducks games through an agreement with sister station KCOP.

From 1972 to 1974, the station also carried games involving the Los Angeles Sharks of the WHA.

With the return of the Rams franchise to Los Angeles, since 2016, KTTV has been the &#x27;unofficial home&#x27; for the Los Angeles Rams through the network&#x27;s primary rights of the National Football Conference. It had held this role for one season in 1994 prior to their move to St. Louis (that same year, Channel 11 aired two home interconference contests featuring the Raiders during their last season in Los Angeles). During the NFL regular season, Rams games are rotated with KNBC (through &quot;NBC Sunday Night Football&quot;), KABC-TV (through &quot;Monday Night Football&quot; simulcasts from ESPN as well as national ABC broadcasts) and most especially KCBS-TV (through the &quot;NFL on CBS&quot;). Since 2017, it has also broadcast Los Angeles Chargers games featuring a visiting NFC team, or games that are cross-flexed from CBS, with some select games from either team carried by KCOP if both teams are playing at the same time. Beginning in the 2018 season, the station began airing &quot;Thursday Night Football&quot; which is simulcast on NFL Network and if either one of the two LA teams are playing it serves as the local area station for gameday telecasts, even if it is exclusive to NFL Network. This practice has generally continued even after Amazon Prime Video began airing games in 2022.

===News operation===

KTTV presently broadcasts hours of local newscasts each week (with hours each weekday and two hours each on Saturdays and Sundays); this gives KTTV the second-largest local news output of any television station in the Los Angeles market, behind CW owned-and-operated station KTLA&#x27;s 96 hours, 50 minutes of weekly newscasts. The station also produces &quot;The Issue Is:&quot;, a political discussion program hosted by Elex Michaelson which airs Friday nights at 10:30 p.m. and is also syndicated to other Fox stations across California, including KICU-TV in San Jose and KSWB-TV in San Diego. As is standard with Fox stations that carry early evening weekend newscasts, KTTV&#x27;s Saturday and Sunday 5 p.m. newscasts are subject to delay or preemption due to network sports coverage.

KTTV operates a Bell 407, branded on-air as &quot;SkyFox&quot;, to provide aerial coverage of breaking news stories. KTTV previously operated two helicopters; one of them (known as &quot;Sky Fox 2&quot;) was destroyed after it crashed at Van Nuys Airport in 2000.

Throughout its history, the station has always operated a news department, partly owing to its former ties to the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;. KTTV aired an 8 p.m. newscast from 1984 to 1987; it also briefly moved its 10 p.m. newscast to 11 p.m. in 1986, in order to compete with existing local newscasts in that same timeslot on KABC-TV, KNBC and KCBS-TV; the newscast&#x27;s format initially was unchanged, but the 8 p.m. edition was later dropped while the 11 p.m. newscast reverted to its previous 10 p.m. slot shortly after News Corporation took over Metromedia in the fall of 1987. During this time period, the station also experimented with newscasts at midday and midnight.

In June 1993, the station launched a new morning news program called &quot;Good Day L.A.&quot;, a program that was inspired by sister station WNYW&#x27;s &quot;Good Day New York&quot;, which debuted in 1988. On July 14, 2008, KTTV launched a half-hour 10 a.m. newscast, following &quot;Good Day L.A.&quot;, as the station&#x27;s first midday newscast since the mid-1980s; KTTV is currently the only station in Los Angeles to have a local newscast in that timeslot. KTTV and KCOP began producing its local newscasts in high definition on October 15, 2008. On December 1, 2008, KTTV fully took over production of KCOP&#x27;s 11 p.m. newscast, which was reduced from an hour to 30 minutes and retitled &quot;Fox News at 11&quot;, marking the end of a KCOP-produced and branded newscast. The newscast on channel 13 then became anchored by KTTV&#x27;s 10 p.m. anchors Carlos Amezcua and Christine Devine, as it was considered an extension of the earlier newscast (in the case of KCOP, all of its newscasts on that station were eliminated on September 22, 2013).

On December 8, 2008, KTTV debuted a half-hour midday newscast at noon on weekdays. On April 27, 2009, KTTV introduced &quot;Good Day L.A. Today&quot;, a recap program airing at 12:30 p.m. weekdays that featured select segments featured on that day&#x27;s edition of &quot;Good Day L.A.&quot;; that show has since been replaced by &quot;TMZ on TV&quot;. On April 12, 2010, the station expanded its weekday morning newscast by a half-hour to 4:30 a.m. Until September 12, 2011, KTTV was one of only two Fox owned-and-operated stations (the other being Chicago&#x27;s WFLD) that did not have an early evening newscast on weeknights and/or weekends; this changed when KTTV launched an hour-long 5 p.m. newscast on that date called &quot;Studio 11 L.A.&quot; On June 30, 2014, KTTV expanded its noon newscast from 30 minutes to 1 hour.

On April 28, 2016, KTTV changed the name of its 5 p.m. newscast to &quot;Fox 11 5:00 News&quot; using the same anchors from &quot;Studio 11 L.A.&quot; Weekend early evening newscasts became known as &quot;Fox 11 Weekend News.&quot;

In September 2018, KTTV canceled its half-hour 10 a.m. newscast.

On December 10, 2018, &quot;Fox 11 Morning News&quot; adopted the &quot;Good Day L.A.&quot; branding, expanding the newscast from 7 a.m. to 4:30 a.m.

On April 1, 2019, &quot;Good Day L.A.&quot; expanded from 4:30 a.m. to 4 a.m.

In September 2022, &quot;Good Day L.A.&quot; expanded to 10 a.m., running until 11 a.m. KTTV also cancelled its mid-day newscast in the same month.

====Anonymous news report====

On July 26, 2007, KTTV aired a report on the hacktivist group Anonymous, calling them a group of &quot;hackers on steroids&quot;, &quot;domestic terrorists&quot;, and collectively an &quot;Internet hate machine&quot;. The report, which became the source for numerous internet memes, featured an unnamed former &quot;hacker&quot; who had fallen out with Anonymous and explained his view of the Anonymous culture. In addition, the report also mentioned &quot;raids&quot; on Habbo, a &quot;national campaign to spoil the new Harry Potter book ending&quot;, and threats to &quot;bomb sports stadiums&quot;.

==Technical information==
===Subchannels===
The station&#x27;s signal is multiplexed:

===Analog-to-digital conversion===
KTTV shut down its analog signal, over VHF channel 11, on June 12, 2009, as part of the federally mandated transition from analog to digital television. The station&#x27;s digital signal relocated from its pre-transition UHF channel 65, which was among the high-band UHF channels (52–69) that were removed from broadcasting use as a result of the transition, to its analog-era VHF channel 11.

<text>Hugh Doggett Scott Jr. (November 11, 1900 – July 21, 1994) was an American politician. A member of the Republican Party, he represented Pennsylvania in the U.S. House of Representatives from 1941 to 1945 and from 1947 to 1959 and in the U.S. Senate, from 1959 to 1977. He served as Senate Minority Leader from 1969 to 1977.

Born and educated in Virginia, Scott moved to Philadelphia to join his uncle&#x27;s law firm. He was appointed as Philadelphia&#x27;s assistant district attorney in 1926 and remained in that position until 1941. Scott won election to represent Northwest Philadelphia in the House of Representatives in 1940. He lost re-election in 1944 but won his seat back in 1946 and served in the House until 1959. Scott established a reputation as an internationalist and moderate Republican Congressman. After helping Thomas E. Dewey win the 1948 Republican presidential nomination, Scott held the position of Chairman of the Republican National Committee from 1948 to 1949. He also served as Dwight Eisenhower&#x27;s campaign chairman in the 1952 presidential election.

Scott won election to the Senate in 1958, narrowly prevailing over Democratic Governor George M. Leader. He was a strong advocate for civil rights legislation and voted in favor of the Civil Rights Acts of 1957, 1960, 1964, and 1968, as well as the 24th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution and the Voting Rights Act of 1965, and the confirmation of Thurgood Marshall to the U.S. Supreme Court. He won election as Senate Minority Whip in January 1969 and was elevated to Senate Minority Leader after Everett Dirksen&#x27;s death later that year. As the Republican leader in the Senate, Scott urged President Richard Nixon to resign in the aftermath of the Watergate Scandal. Scott declined to seek another term in 1976 and retired in 1977.

==Early life and education==
The son of Hugh Doggett and Jane Lee (née Lewis) Scott, Hugh Doggett Scott was born on an estate in Fredericksburg, Virginia, that was once owned by George Washington. His grandfather served in the Confederate Army during the Civil War under General John Hunt Morgan, and his great-grandmother was the niece of President Zachary Taylor. After attending public schools in Fredericksburg, he studied at Randolph–Macon College in Ashland, Virginia, from which he graduated in 1919. He enrolled in the Student Reserve Officers Training Corps and the Students&#x27; Army Training Corps during World War I.

In 1922, Scott earned his law degree from the University of Virginia School of Law at Charlottesville, where he was a member of the Jefferson Literary and Debating Society and the Alpha Chi Rho fraternity. His interest in politics was established after he frequently attended committee hearings in the Virginia House of Delegates.

==Early political career==
Scott was admitted to the bar in 1922 and then moved to Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, where he joined his uncle&#x27;s law firm. Two years later, he married Marian Huntington Chase to whom he remained married until her death in 1987. The couple had one daughter, Marian.

Scott, who had become a regular worker for the Republican Party, was appointed assistant district attorney of Philadelphia in 1926 and served in that position until 1941. He claimed to have prosecuted more than 20,000 cases during his tenure. From 1938 to 1940, he served as a member of the Governor&#x27;s Commission on Reform of the Magistrates System.

==United States House of Representatives==
In 1940, after longtime Republican incumbent George P. Darrow decided to retire, Scott was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives from Pennsylvania&#x27;s 7th congressional district. The district was then based in Northwest Philadelphia. He defeated Democratic candidate Gilbert Cassidy by a margin of 3,362 votes. In 1942, he was re-elected to a second term after defeating Democrat Thomas Minehart, a former member of the Philadelphia City Council and future Pennsylvania Treasurer; Scott received nearly 56% of the vote.

In 1943, he became a member of the Virginia Society of the Cincinnati. In 1944 Scott spoke out fearlessly in the House of Representatives accusing President Roosevelt of having dishonestly manipulated the country into war by: a) moving the U.S. battleship fleet from San Diego to Pearl Harbor over the objection of Admiral Richardson (whom Roosevelt then fired) in order to give Japan a target it could reach; b) refusing to give Admiral Kimmel at Pearl Harbor (Richardson&#x27;s replacement) enough PBY Catalina reconnaissance planes to scout the area around the Hawaiian Islands; and c) by withholding from Admiral Kimmel a message received by the U.S. government from the Australian government on the day before the Pearl Harbor attack that the Japanese fleet was steaming toward Pearl Harbor. In 1944, Scott was defeated for re-election by Democrat Herb McGlinchey, losing by only 2,329 votes.

Scott joined the United States Navy Reserve in 1940. He served during World War II, and was posted to both Iceland with the Atlantic Fleet and the USS &quot;New Mexico&quot; with the United States Pacific Fleet. He was among US forces that entered Japan on the first day of post-war occupation, and was discharged with the rank of commander.

In 1946, Scott reclaimed his House seat, handily defeating McGlinchey by a margin of more than 23,000 vote by speaking out against both President Franklin Roosevelt&#x27;s &quot;betrayal at Yalta&quot; and communists in Washington, DC. He was reelected five times, and served until winning election to the U.S. Senate.

During his tenure in the House, Scott established himself as a strong internationalist by voting in favor of foreign aid to both Greece and Turkey and the Marshall Plan. He also earned a reputation as a moderate Republican by supporting public housing, rent control, and the abolition of the poll tax as well as other legislation sought by the Civil Rights Movement. From 1948 to 1949, he served as chairman of the Republican National Committee; he received the position after helping New York Governor Thomas E. Dewey obtain the Republican nomination in the 1948 presidential election. Facing staunch opposition from Ohio Senator Robert A. Taft, Scott barely survived a no-confidence ballot but still resigned as RNC chairman. He later served as campaign chairman for Dwight Eisenhower during the 1952 presidential election.

==United States Senate==

In 1958, after fellow Republican Edward Martin declined to run for re-election, Scott was elected to the U.S. Senate. He narrowly defeated his Democratic opponent, Governor George M. Leader, by a margin of 51 to 48 percent. Scott continued his progressive voting record in the Senate by opposing President Eisenhower&#x27;s veto of a housing bill in 1959 and a redevelopment bill in 1960. He voted to end segregationist Democratic senators&#x27; filibuster of the Civil Rights Act of 1960, and he later sponsored 12 bills to implement the recommendations of the Civil Rights Commission. A memorable quote from Scott came during the U-2 Incident in 1960, when he said, &quot;We have violated the eleventh Commandment — Thou Shall Not Get Caught.&quot; In April 1962, he joined Senator Kenneth Keating of New York in denouncing a UN resolution condemning Israeli retaliation against Syrian gun positions firing on Israeli fishermen on Lake Tiberias. They criticized the action as a form of evenhandedness that &quot;looks like the palm of the hand for the Arabs and the back of the hand for the Israelis.&quot;

In 1962, Scott threatened to run for Governor of Pennsylvania if the Republican Party did not nominate the moderate Representative William W. Scranton over the more conservative Judge Robert E. Woodside, a former Pennsylvania Attorney General. He even supported Scranton as a more liberal alternative to conservative Senator Barry Goldwater for the Republican nomination in the 1964 presidential election. Scott also faced re-election in 1964 and overcame the national landslide for Democratic President Lyndon Johnson to defeat the state Secretary of Internal Affairs, Democrat Genevieve Blatt, by approximately 70,000 votes.

Scott voted for the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the Voting Rights Act of 1965, and the Civil Rights Act of 1968. In 1966, along with two other Republican Senators and five Republican Representatives, Scott signed a telegram sent to Georgia Governor Carl Sanders on the Georgia legislature&#x27;s refusal to seat the recently elected Julian Bond in its state House of Representatives. The refusal, said the telegram, was &quot;a dangerous attack on representative government. None of us agree with Mr. Bond&#x27;s views on the Vietnam War; in fact we strongly repudiate these views. But unless otherwise determined by a court of law, which the Georgia Legislature is not, he is entitled to express them.&quot;

Scott supported New York Governor Nelson Rockefeller for the Republican nomination in the 1968 presidential election. Scott was re-elected in 1970, defeating Democratic State Senator William Sesler by a margin of 51 to 45 percent. Scott served until January 3, 1977, and was elected Senate Minority Whip in January 1969. On September 5, of that year, Scott was designated as acting minority leader to fill in for the ailing incumbent, Everett Dirksen, who died two days later. On September 24, Scott was narrowly elected Senate Minority Leader over Tennessee Senator Howard Baker (Dirksen&#x27;s son-in-law), serving until 1977.

In 1967, Scott held a Fellowship at Balliol College, Oxford, where he contributed regularly to Alan Montefiore&#x27;s politics seminar for postgraduates. Once, when he and Montefiore started talking at the same time, Scott carried on speaking with the amiable excuse: &quot;You can remember what you want to say longer than I can.&quot;

Scott was Chairman of the Select Committee on Secret and Confidential Documents (92nd Congress). He wielded tremendous influence.

Scott was displeased with the Nixon administration and believed that it was aloof, unapproachable, and contemptuous of him. Scott believed that he would be given a major role in setting administration policy but was disappointed when that did not occur. Actively assisting in the behind-the-scenes transition from the Nixon administration to the Ford administration in the months leading up to the resignation of President Richard Nixon, Scott sought assurance from Gerald Ford that Scott would be able to address Ford as &quot;Jerry&quot; even after Ford became president.

Scott was one of the three Republican leaders in Congress to meet Nixon in the Oval Office of the White House to tell Nixon that he had lost support of the party in Congress, on August 7, 1974. The meeting came the day before Nixon would announce his resignation from the presidency. The delegation was led by senior party leader and Arizona Senator Goldwater and also included House Minority Leader John Jacob Rhodes (R-Arizona). The erosion of Nixon&#x27;s support had progressed after the June 1972 Watergate break-in. At that meeting, Scott and Goldwater told Nixon that, at most, 15 Senators were willing to consider voting to acquit him–not even half of the 34 votes Nixon needed to avoid conviction and removal from office.

In 1976, the Senate undertook an ethics inquiry into accusations that he had received payment from lobbyists for the Gulf Oil Corporation. Scott acknowledged having received $45,000 but claimed that they were legal campaign contributions.

He did not run for re-election in 1976 and was succeeded by Republican John Heinz. The same year, he chaired the Pennsylvania delegation to the Republican National Convention.

==Later life==
Scott was a resident of Washington, D.C., and then Falls Church, Virginia, until his death there in 1994. He is buried at Arlington National Cemetery. His papers are held at the Albert and Shirley Small Special Collections Library at the University of Virginia.

** Abstract: While their different public personas, political interests, and institutional duties led to occasional disagreement, President Richard Nixon and Senate Minority Leader Scott were not always unhappily tethered as evidenced by their stances on domestic and foreign issues throughout Nixon&#x27;s presidency, during 1968–74. While he jousted with Nixon over racial policies and his Supreme Court nominations, including his choice of Judge Clement F. Haynsworth Jr., of South Carolina, Scott supported much of Nixon&#x27;s domestic agenda, applauded the president&#x27;s conduct of foreign affairs, backed his Vietnam policy, praised his invasion of Cambodia, publicly proclaimed Nixon&#x27;s innocence during the Watergate scandal, and endorsed President Gerald Ford&#x27;s pardon of his predecessor. The Nixon-Scott relationship is notable because it confirms scholars&#x27; assumptions about Nixon&#x27;s hot-and-cold association with Congress and indicates that sparring between moderate Republicans like Nixon and Scott was on its way out.

<text>Dudley Tyng Fisher Jr. (April 27, 1890 – July 10, 1951) was a syndicated newspaper cartoonist, best known for his character Myrtle who was introduced in his Sunday page, &quot;Right Around Home&quot;, distributed by King Features Syndicate under various titles from 1937 to 1964. Fisher drew &quot;Right Around Home&quot; until his death on October 6, 1951, after which his assistant, Bob Vittur, managed the strip with assistance from King Features’ bullpen stalwart Stan Randal until its end on May 2, 1965.

==Early life==
Fisher was born in Columbus, Ohio to Dudley T. Fisher Sr. and Marion Garner Fisher and grew up on the city&#x27;s north side. He was known as Ting by the other children because Dudley was considered too fancy. His first work appeared in the juvenile magazine St. Nicholas. In high school he drew for the school newspaper which was edited by W. M. Kiplinger. As an adult, he studied to be an architect at Ohio State University and was recruited into Sigma Pi fraternity by Kiplinger and Ray Evans. While at OSU, he was an art editor for the &quot;MakiO&quot; yearbook. At the encouragement of Evans, a cartoonist, he left school after two years to work as a newspaper layout artist at &quot;The Columbus Dispatch&quot;. He remembered that his first interview with editor Arthur Johnson Sr. was composed of them yelling at each other over the noise of the printing presses.

==Comic strips==

When hired by the &quot;Dispatch&quot; in 1911, Fisher was a retouch artist under the direction of Evans and Billy Ireland. He later worked side by side with another famous cartoonist, Milton Caniff. He served in an aerial photography unit in 1917 during World War I. Re-joining the &quot;Dispatch&quot; after the war, he created the two-color daily panel &quot;Jolly Jingles&quot; (1924–37).

In 1937, tired of devising the &quot;Jolly Jingles&quot; rhymes, he created &quot;Right Around Home&quot; depicting a suburban family. He immediately attracted attention with the experimental concept of an elevated down-angle view showing numerous characters in a large single panel filling an entire Sunday page. He attributed its success and charm of this page to his stumbling &quot;upon the truth that what readers like most is to read about themselves and the things they all do.&quot; He confirmed that the characters were all based on people, and animals, that he knew with Myrtle being based on his daughter&#x27;s mannerisms.

Five years after its first publication, King Features asked Fisher to do a daily version of &quot;Right Around Home&quot; in a conventional comic strip format, and &quot;Myrtle&quot; began in 1942.

==Personal life==
Fisher married Anne Potts on December 31, 1919 and they had a daughter, Marion. In later life, he learned to build and play pipe organs. Friends said he could play very well but he did not think his ability was good enough to play in public

Fisher advised young artists to &quot;put all your energy into what you draw and stop worrying about which pen and paper to use. Make the most of your chances. You&#x27; ll never know which were the big chances until long after you try them.&quot;

Fisher worked for the &quot;Columbus Dispatch&quot; and on his two newspaper strips until his death in 1951 while on vacation in Rockport, Massachusetts.

==After his death==
Bob Vittur stepped in to draw &quot;Right Around Home&quot; through 1952, when it was retitled &quot;Right Around Home with Myrtle&quot;. It continued under that title until 1964.

==Reprints==
&quot;Right Around Home&quot; was reprinted in the first issue (December 2011) of Russ Cochran&#x27;s &quot;The Sunday Funnies&quot;.

<text>&quot;The Pet Goat&quot; (often erroneously called &quot;My Pet Goat&quot;) is a grade-school-level reading exercise composed by American educationalist Siegfried &quot;Zig&quot; Engelmann and Elaine C. Bruner. It get attention for being read by US President George W. Bush with a class of second-graders on the morning of September 11, 2001. After being discreetly informed of the September 11 attacks midway through the reading, Bush waited quietly for the reading to finish before responding to the unfolding crisis. The exercise has gained notoriety in the retrospective assessment of Bush&#x27;s response to the September 11 attacks.

==Reading exercise==
&quot;The Pet Goat&quot; was composed by Siegfried &quot;Zig&quot; Engelmann, who had written over a thousand similar instructional exercises since the 1970s. It was anthologized in the classroom workbook &quot;Reading Mastery: Rainbow Edition, Level 2, Storybook 1&quot;. &quot;The Pet Goat&quot; is designed to teach students about words ending in the letter &quot;E&quot;, using the Direct Instruction (DI) teaching method. The exercise tells a story about a girl&#x27;s pet goat, which her parents want to get rid of because it eats everything; the parents relent after it foils a robbery by butting the intruder, who is now &quot;sore&quot; (that word ending in &quot;e&quot;).

==George W. Bush during the September 11 attacks==

On September 11, 2001, US President George W. Bush went to Emma E. Booker Elementary School to meet students and staff and to bring attention to his plans for education reform. Upon arriving at the Sarasota, Florida, school, the president was informed of the first plane crash into the World Trade Center, though he was briefed that it was probably just a small propeller plane. While President Bush sat in Kay Daniels&#x27; classroom, and her students read &quot;The Pet Goat&quot;, White House Chief of Staff Andrew Card interrupted the president to whisper in his ear: &quot;A second plane hit the second tower. America is under attack.&quot;

Afterwards, the children continued to read and President Bush sat while—as described by &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot;—&quot;trying to keep under tight control.&quot; Despite the president&#x27;s efforts to remain stoic and not alarm the children, students knew something was wrong; they later said that the president&#x27;s face became red and serious, and his expression was &quot;flabbergasted, shocked, [and] horrified&quot;.

According to Bill Sammon&#x27;s book &quot;Fighting Back&quot;, Bush&#x27;s gaze flitted about the room—the children, the press, the floor, his staff—while his mind raced about everything he did not yet know. After receiving cue-card advice from his press secretary, Ari Fleischer (&quot;DON&#x27;T SAY ANYTHING YET&quot;), the &quot;notoriously punctual&quot; president lingered in the classroom after the reading exercise was finished: he adamantly did not want to give an appearance of panic. After chatting with the students and their teacher, Bush deflected a Trade Center–related question from a reporter and began to learn about the magnitude of the attacks.

Public attention to &quot;The Pet Goat&quot; first came to the fore with Michael Moore&#x27;s 2004 documentary &quot;Fahrenheit 9/11&quot;, though the film incorrectly gave the title as &quot;My Pet Goat&quot; and called it a book. Within a few weeks, a blogger named Peter Smith tracked down the correct name and origin as a reading exercise by Engelmann.

===Reactions===
&quot;The New Yorker&quot; described a seven-minute video of President Bush holding &quot;Reading Mastery&quot; while &quot;staring blankly into space&quot; as the most memorable bit in &quot;Fahrenheit 9/11&quot;; the film presents the president as faltering in the face of the crisis.

The commander-in-chief&#x27;s supporters argued that there was nothing for Bush to do but wait for more information while not alarming the pupils. On his own behalf, Bush said that &quot;his instinct was to project calm, not to have the country see an excited reaction at a moment of crisis. The national press corps was standing behind the children in the classroom; he saw their phones and pagers start to ring. The president felt he should project strength and calm until he could better understand what was happening.&quot; Booker Elementary Principal Tose-Rigell supported the president&#x27;s reactions at her school—&quot;I don&#x27;t think anyone could have handled it better. What would it have served if [Bush] had jumped out of his chair and ran out of the room?&quot;—as did Daniels&#x27; students, who later said that Bush&#x27;s actions were the right ones.

A year after the attacks, Kay Daniels&#x27; classroom still had the chair in which the president sat; it was festooned with a purple ribbon. By 2004, Engelmann (then a retired professor) was surprised at the attention &quot;The Pet Goat&quot; received: &quot;It hasn&#x27;t brought me any fame, [...] It&#x27;s fascinating that anyone would even be interested in something like this.&quot;

<text>Ralph Forbes (born Ralph Forbes Taylor; 30 September 1904 – 31 March 1951) was an English film and stage actor active in Britain and the United States.

==Early life==
Forbes was born in Wandsworth, London, the son of Ernest John &quot;E.J.&quot; and Ethel Louise Taylor. His mother would become known as Mary Forbes, a stage and film actress. His younger sister was actress Brenda Forbes (born Dorothy Brenda Taylor). Born on 30 September 1904, Forbes was baptized on 6 November and his birth was legally registered with the authorities during the last quarter of 1904.

Forbes met with an accident while playing football at Denstone College in Staffordshire which resulted in a scar on his cheek. He came to the United States as a member of a British troupe that performed &quot;Havoc&quot;, a war play. He started off in films, then went on stage.

In the United States he appeared onstage opposite actress Ruth Chatterton, whom he wed on 20 December 1924 in New York City. He was 20 years old and she was four days shy of her 32nd birthday. The couple divorced in 1932. He married actress Heather Angel in Yuma, Arizona, on 29 August 1934; that marriage ended in divorce on 18 July 1941. His last wife, whom he married in 1946, was actress Dora Sayers.

==Later years==
Following a film career that spanned from 1926 to 1944, Forbes’s latter years were given to working on the Broadway stage. One of his last stage appearances was in a revival of Shaw&#x27;s &quot;You Never Can Tell&quot; in 1948. He died at Montefiore Hospital in The Bronx, New York, in 1951, aged 46.

<text>Sandisk Corporation is an American multinational computer technology company based in Milpitas, California. The company is known for its flash memory products, including memory cards and readers, USB flash drives, solid-state drives, and digital audio players. 

The company was owned by Western Digital (WD) from 2016 to 2025; in 2023, WD announced its intent to divest the entirety of its flash storage business as a new public company under the SanDisk brand—a transaction completed on February 24, 2025.

==History==
The company was originally founded in 1988 as SunDisk by Eli Harari, Sanjay Mehrotra, and Jack Yuan. In 1995, just before its initial public offering, SunDisk changed its name to SanDisk, to avoid confusion with Sun Microsystems.

SanDisk co-founder Eli Harari developed the Floating Gate EEPROM which proved the practicality, reliability and endurance of semiconductor-based data storage. 

In 1991, SanDisk produced the first flash-based solid-state drive (SSD) in a 2.5-inch hard disk drive form factor for IBM with a 20 MB capacity priced at about $1,000.

In 1992, SanDisk introduced FlashDisk, a series of memory cards made for the PCMCIA or PC card form factor, so they could be inserted into the expansion slots of many laptops and handheld PCs of the time. Unlike other similar products at the time, FlashDisks did not require a battery to store their contents. SanDisk discontinued their production in 2002, and the highest capacity model had 8 gigabytes of capacity. 

On May 10, 2000, the Toshiba Corporation of Japan and the SanDisk Corporation said that they would jointly form a new semiconductor company to produce advanced flash memory, primarily for digital cameras.

In 2005 SanDisk entered the digital audio player market with the release of its first flash-based MP3 player, the SanDisk Sansa e100. As soon as 2006, they became the second largest maker of digital audio players in the United States behind Apple.

In October 2005, SanDisk acquired Matrix Semiconductor. In July 2006, SanDisk acquired M-Systems. In May 2011, SanDisk acquired Pliant Technology, a manufacturer of solid state drives, for $327 million. In February 2012, SanDisk acquired FlashSoft. In June 2012, SanDisk acquired Schooner Information Technology, developer of the flash-optimized database software SchoonerSQL and caching software Membrain. In July 2013, SanDisk acquired SMART Storage Systems, a producer of SSDs for the enterprise market, for $307 million. In June 2014, SanDisk acquired Fusion-io, a producer of flash memory for enterprise data centers, for $1.1 billion.

In 2012, the Enough Project ranked SanDisk the third highest of 24 consumer electronics companies on &quot;progress on conflict minerals&quot;.

In 2014, SanDisk co-founder Harari won the National Medal of Technology and Innovation from President Barack Obama for his innovations and contributions to flash memory storage.

On January 8, 2015, NexGen Storage, which had been acquired by Fusion-io, was spun out as an independent company; it would be acquired by Pivot3 in January 2016. 

In October 2015, Western Digital announced its intent to acquire SanDisk for $19 billion. The acquisition was completed on May 12, 2016; the valuation was lowered to $16 billion after Chinese company Unisplendour pulled out of an agreement to acquire a 15% stake in WD.

In October 2023, Western Digital announced its intent to spin off its flash storage businesses as a new public company under the SanDisk name, leaving WD focused solely on hard drives. In addition to SanDisk-branded products, the spin-off would also include all flash storage products that were marketed under the WD branding. The company began preparations for the split in October 2024, when all product listings and information for WD-branded flash storage products were moved under the SanDisk website. In December 2024, SanDisk unveiled a new pixel-inspired logo (replacing a design used in various forms since 1995), changing its stylization to &quot;Sandisk&quot;. 

The split was completed on February 24, 2025, with Sandisk Corporation beginning to trade on the Nasdaq, and WD CEO David Goeckeler moving to the new company. WD continues to hold an equity stake in Sandisk.

<doc id="765691" wikidata="Q629067" url="?curid=765691" title="Portable toilet">
<text>A portable or mobile toilet (colloquial terms: thunderbox, porta-john, porta-potty or porta-loo) is any type of toilet that can be moved around, some by one person, some by mechanical equipment such as a truck and crane. Most types do not require any pre-existing services or infrastructure, such as sewerage, and are completely self-contained. The portable toilet is used in a variety of situations, for example in urban slums of developing countries, at festivals, for camping, on boats, on construction sites, and at film locations and large outdoor gatherings where there are no other facilities. Most portable toilets are unisex single units with privacy ensured by a simple lock on the door. Some portable toilets are small molded plastic or fiberglass portable rooms with a lockable door and a receptacle to catch the human excreta in a container. 

A portable toilet is not connected to a hole in the ground (like a pit latrine), nor to a septic tank, nor is it plumbed into a municipal system leading to a sewage treatment plant. The chemical toilet is probably the most well-known type of portable toilet, but other types also exist, such as urine-diversion dehydration toilets, composting toilets, container-based toilets, bucket toilets, freezing toilets and incineration toilets. A bucket toilet is a very simple type of portable toilet.

==Types==
===Chemical toilets===

A chemical toilet collects human waste in a holding tank and uses chemicals to minimize the odors. Most portable toilets use chemicals in this way and therefore are considered chemical toilets. The chemicals may either mask the odor or contain biocides that hinder odor-causing bacteria from multiplying, keeping the smell to a minimum.
====Enclosed portable toilets====
Enclosed portable chemical toilets are widely used for crowds at festivals, and for worksites without permanent toilets, such as early stages of construction and remote worksites.

On planes and trains, some toilets are chemical toilets, and others are vacuum toilets.

==== Portable camping toilets ====
A portable camping toilet has a seat and a small waste tank. Adding a packet of chemicals to the waste tank reduces odors and bacteria, until the waste can be dumped at an appropriate facility. They are used in camping, travel trailers, caravans, and camper vans. They may also be used on small boats which lack a built-in marine toilet. 
====WAG bags====

Waste aggregation and gelling (WAG) bags have a gel to immobilize liquid waste and surround solid waste in a plastic bag, which is then put in the trash. They are used in the US Army and in wilderness.
They can be used to line a bucket, with a toilet-seat lid, and are required for Utah river trips.

=== Urine-diversion dehydration toilets===

Portable urine-diversion dehydration toilets are self-contained dry toilets sometimes referred to as &quot;mobile&quot; or &quot;stand-alone&quot; units. They are identifiable by their one-piece molded plastic shells or, in the case of DIY versions, simple plywood box construction. Most users of self-contained UDDTs rely upon a collection agency or a post-treatment process to ensure pathogen reduction. This post-treatment may consist of long-term storage or addition to an existing or purpose-built compost pile or some combination thereof. The necessity of a post-treatment step hinges upon the frequency and volume of use. For instances of infrequent or very modest seasonal use, a post-treatment phase might be deemed unnecessary due to the lower accumulation of waste, simplifying the overall disposal process.

Container-based sanitation refers to a collection system which regularly replaces full containers with empty containers, and disposes of the waste.
=== Commode chair===
A commode chair (a chair enclosing a chamber pot) is a basic portable toilet that is used next to a bed (bedside commode) for people with limited mobility. Before indoor toilets, it was used world-wide as an indoor alternative to an outhouse.

==History==
The close stool, built as an article of furniture, is one of the earliest forms of portable toilet. They can still be seen in historic house museums such as Sir George-Étienne Cartier National Historic Site in Old Montreal, Canada. The velvet upholstered close stool used by William III is on display at Hampton Court Palace; see Groom of the Stool.

Early versions of the &quot;Elsan chemical closet&quot; (&quot;closet&quot; meaning a small room, see water closet, WC, and earth closet) were sold at Army &amp; Navy Stores. Their use in World War II bomber aircraft is described at some length by the Bomber Command Museum of Canada; in brief, they were not popular with either the flying crew or the ground crew.

African-Americans living under Jim Crow laws (i.e. before the Civil Rights Act of 1964) faced severe challenges. Public toilets were segregated by race, and many restaurants and gas stations refused to serve black people, so some travellers carried a portable toilet in the trunk of their car.

Since 1974, Grand Canyon guides rafting on the Colorado River have used ammo boxes as portable toilets, typically with a removable toilet seat, according to the Museum of Northern Arizona in Flagstaff, Arizona.

==Society and culture==
A slang term, now dated or historic, is a &quot;thunder-box&quot; (&quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot;: &quot;a portable commode; by extension, any lavatory&quot;). The term was used particularly in British India; travel writer Stephen McClarence called it &quot;a crude sort of colonial lavatory&quot;. One features to comic effect in Evelyn Waugh&#x27;s novel &quot;Men at Arms&quot;:

<text>KSCI (channel 18) is a television station licensed to Long Beach, California, United States, serving the Los Angeles area. Owned by WRNN-TV Associates, the station airs programming from home shopping network Shop LC. KSCI&#x27;s studios are located on South Bundy Drive in West Los Angeles, and its transmitter is located atop Mount Wilson. KSCI served as a multicultural independent station until June 2021.

==History==

=== 1970s ===
The channel 18 allocation in Los Angeles was previously occupied by KCHU-TV, licensed to San Bernardino, which signed on the air on August 1, 1962, before it went off the air in June 1964. The station was owned by the &quot;San Bernardino Sun-Telegram&quot;. KSCI signed on the air on June 30, 1977, operating from studios in West Los Angeles, although still licensed in San Bernardino. It became a non-profit owned by the Transcendental Meditation movement (the call letters stood for Maharishi Mahesh Yogi&#x27;s theoretical &quot;Science of Creative Intelligence&quot;). The station broadcast news stories, prerecorded lectures and variety shows with TM celebrities. KSCI&#x27;s goal was to report &quot;only good news&quot;; sister stations were planned for San Francisco and Washington, D.C. The station manager was Mark Fleischer, son of Hollywood director Richard Fleischer.

=== 1980s ===
In 1980, KSCI switched to a for-profit operation and earned $1 million on revenues of $8 million in 1985. In November 1985, the station loaned $350,000 to Maharishi International University in Iowa. By June 1986, the station&#x27;s content began to consist of &quot;a hodgepodge of programming&quot; in 14 languages. They had dubbed themselves the &quot;international station&quot; and claimed to offer the most diverse ethnic television programming in the early 1980s. Almost all Iranian American television programs in the early 1980s were on KSCI.

In October 1986, the station was purchased by its general manager and an investor for $40.5 million.

=== 1990s ===
In 1990, the station was sold to Intercontinental Television Group Inc., with programming being produced by Wahid Boctor of Arab American Television. In 1998, KSCI transferred its city of license from San Bernardino to Long Beach. In 2000, a Korean newspaper, &quot;The Hankook Ilbo&quot;, took over the International Media Group (IMG), which operated KSCI. IMG was re-launched as the AsianMedia Group, Inc., who purchased the station.

=== 2000s ===
By 2005, the station was broadcasting seven English-language and three Spanish-language newscasts plus &quot;local news programs in Vietnamese, Mandarin Chinese, and Korean&quot; to 2.5 million Asian-American viewers in Southern California. In early 2005, KSCI changed its on-air branding to &quot;LA18&quot;. 

In October 2008, KSCI broadcast the Presidential debate along with translation in Mandarin and offered political analysis by their news staff. The broadcast was one of several that covered election events in Korean, Mandarin, Cantonese, Vietnamese and Filipino languages.

=== 2010s–present ===
On January 9, 2012, KSCI, Inc. filed a voluntary petition for reorganization under Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection to the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware. On August 11, 2012, KSCI was purchased by NRJ TV LLC, a company which has acquired smaller television stations in various U.S. cities for the possibility of placing their spectrum for auction once the Federal Communications Commission rolls out a voluntary spectrum auction for use for non-broadcast purposes in 2014.

On June 22, 2017, KSCI announced that they had canceled all of its programming in Chinese, Filipino, Spanish, and Armenian and replaced it with English-language infomercials beginning July 1. The subchannels of the station continued to air its programs in Chinese and Armenian, but as a result of the station&#x27;s programming cutbacks, KSCI also announced they reduced its Korean programming from 8 to 11 p.m. and would cut its subchannels list from 12 to 5 the following year.

On September 12, 2017, KSCI&#x27;s parent company NRJ TV LLC announced that they would sell its Poway translator station, KUAN-LD, to the NBC Owned Television Stations group (owners of KNBC/KVEA and KNSD), for $650,000; the sale was completed on December 21, 2017.

==== Sale to RNN ====
On December 9, 2019, it was announced that WRNN-TV Associates, owner of New York City–based WRNN-TV, secured a deal to purchase seven full-power TV stations (including KSCI) and one Class A station from NRJ. The sale was approved by the FCC on January 23, and was completed on February 4, 2020.

From February 1 until February 4, 2020, WRNN-TV Associates operated KSCI under a short-term local marketing agreement (LMA) while it awaited full consummation of its purchase. KSCI began airing WRNN-TV&#x27;s independent network RNN on its primary channel. RNN&#x27;s schedule consists primarily of infomercials, with occasional religious, E/I, and news/talk programs.

On May 30, 2021, it was announced that KSCI (along with its sister stations owned by WRNN-TV Associates) would become an affiliate of the ShopHQ 24/7 channel on June 28, 2021.

iMedia Brands filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy on June 28, 2023. On July 10, 2023, iMedia announced that it would sell its assets, including ShopHQ, to RNN Media Group for $50 million; the deal was terminated in August in favor of a $55 million bid for ShopHQ by IV Brands, owned by Manoj Bhargava. In October 2023, KSCI switched to Shop LC.

===Analog-to-digital conversion===
KSCI shut down its analog signal, over UHF channel 18, on June 12, 2009, as part of the federally mandated transition from analog to digital television. The station&#x27;s digital signal relocated from its pre-transition UHF channel 61, which was among the high band UHF channels (52-69) that were removed from broadcasting use as a result of the transition, to its former analog-era UHF channel 18.

<text>Raiātea or Raiatea (Tahitian: &quot;Raiātea&quot;) is the second largest of the Society Islands, after Tahiti, in French Polynesia, in the South Pacific Ocean. The island is widely regarded as the &quot;centre&quot; of the eastern islands in ancient Polynesia and it is likely that the organised migrations to the Hawaiian Islands, and other parts of East Polynesia started at Raiātea.

A traditional name for the island is Havai&#x27;i, homeland of the Māori people. Situated on the southeast coast is the historical Taputapuatea marae, which was established by 1000 CE. The site was the political and religious center of eastern Polynesia for several centuries, and was inscribed on the UNESCO World Heritage List in 2017 for its historical significance.

The main township on Raiātea is Uturoa, the administrative centre for the Leeward Islands (French &quot;Îles Sous-le-vent&quot;). There are also colleges which serve as the main educational location for secondary schools for students from the regional islands of Bora Bora, Tahaa, Huahine and Maupiti.

==Etymology==

The Tahitian language name means &quot;bright sky&quot;. &quot;Ulitea&quot; is an obsolete transcription commonly used in the 19th century.

The extinct Raiatea starling inhabited the island; there is only one drawing of it in the world – in the Natural History Museum, London.

==History==

The Polynesian navigator Tupaia, who sailed with explorer James Cook, was born in Raiatea around 1725. Cook visited Raiatea in 1769 and again in 1773–1774. He named the island &quot;Ulitea&quot;. Omai (c.1751–1780), another young man from Raiatea, travelled with European explorers to London in 1774 and also served as an interpreter to Captain Cook on his second and third journeys.

=== Prehistory ===
In ancient times the island was called Havai&#x27;i, a sacred name in Polynesian culture and related to the names of Hawaii; Savai&#x27;i, in Samoa; and Havaiki, the ancient name for Fakarava in the Tuamotu. According to recent findings, the Society Islands were colonised from Samoa and Tonga around 200 BC, about the same time as the Marquesas. Together with the Marquesas, they formed the heart of Polynesia and thus the springboard for the settlement of Hawaii, New Zealand and Mangareva. A major ancestor who lived on the island was Ohomairangi, who was the protector of the Taputapuatea marae. The Maori tribal identity Ngā Oho was formed among his ancestors.

According to traditional histories, two Māori migration canoes, the &quot;Tainui&quot; and &quot;Arawa&quot;, left Raiatea for New Zealand in the late 13th Century or early 14th Century. Many Māori can trace their lineage to these canoes, including the Tainui and Te Arawa tribes.

Favored by Raiatea&#x27;s geography, with valleys bounded by rocky ridges and open to the sea, nine independent tribal principalities emerged, which in turn subdivided into individual clans. This led to a strictly stratified social pattern: Society was divided into several separate social levels. At the top were the ariki or ari&#x27;i, the noble chiefs whose claim to leadership was legitimized by their descent from the founding ancestors. They were landowners and undisputed political and religious leaders.

In the Society islands they exercised great religious and cultural influence. The great temple (in Tahitian marae) of Taputapuatea, dedicated to the god Oro, was the most important religious center of the islands. His cult supplanted other traditional gods such as Taaroa and Tane, and the different marae were subsidiary to that of Taputapuatea. Around him the Arioi sect was formed, a religious, aristocratic, warlike and festive mixture, which was respected in all the islands and achieved, only with its presence and its taboo character, a truce in the tribal wars.

=== European colonization ===

Raiatea was discovered for Europe by British explorer James Cook on 20 July 1769 during his first voyage. Coming from Tahiti, he sailed onboard HMS &quot;Endeavour&quot; through the Avamo&#x27;a Reef passage, sacred to the Polynesians, anchored in Opoa Bay and landed near the Marae Taputapuatea. He hoisted the Union Jack and took possession of the island for the British Empire in a brief ceremony. To expand the Spanish Empire, Charles III of Spain ordered expeditions to be sent to the South Pacific. Manuel de Amat y Junyent, the viceroy of Peru, sent the Spanish Navy officer Domingo de Bonechea to Raʻiātea. Bonechea, commanding the frigate &quot;El Águila&quot;, arrived there in 1772, and he named the island &quot;Princesa&quot; and took possession of it for the Spanish Empire. However, the annexation had no political consequences.

Although neighboring Tahiti was already under the influence of European powers in the late 18th century and formally came under French protectorate in 1842, the clans of Raiatea fiercely resisted annexation efforts. However, Christian missionaries managed to gain increasing influence, which led to religious wars between followers of the traditional and Christian faiths. With the support of the Europeans, King Pōmare II was able to declare himself sovereign of the entire archipelago. On November 12, 1815, Pōmare&#x27;s adversaries, the followers of the old faith, were decisively defeated at the Battle of Feipi. 

In 1828, the Marae Taputapuatea was destroyed. In 1831, the Mamaia sect, successor to the already banned Arioi, again succeeded in expelling the missionaries from Raiatea. In 1832, the Mamaia were finally defeated and banished. The missionaries returned and France tried to gain more and more influence. As early as 1842, Rear Admiral Abel Aubert du Petit-Thouars had claimed the Society Islands on behalf of France. However, King Louis Philippe I initially hesitated to sign the annexation announced by Petit-Thouars, fearing conflicts of interest with Britain, which also claimed them. As Queen Pōmare IV of Tahiti was pro-British and more attached to the Protestant missionaries, she allowed herself to be taken to Raiatea in this ambiguous situation in 1844 and ruled from there until 1847.

In 1880, France proclaimed a provisional protectorate over Raiatea and Tahaa. In 1887, at the request of European traders, the French bombarded the island, before occupying it and deposed its government. The island was formally annexed by France on April 21 1888. However, rebellions continued to occur in Raiatea. In 1888, the tribal chief Teraupo&#x27;o entrenched himself in the Avera Valley on the east coast and resisted French intervention. It was only in 1897 that he fell into captivity and was exiled to New Caledonia. 190 of his followers were forcibly relocated with their families to the island of Ua Huka. King Tamatoa VI was the last monarch, reigning over Raiatea and Tahaa from 1884 to 1888.

==Geography ==

With a total area of 175 km2, it is the second largest island of the Society archipelago, after Tahiti. Tahaa lies north of Raiatea, the two islands are separated by a 3 km strait. According to legend, it is the work of an enchanted moray eel possessed by the spirit of a deceased princess. A coral barrier reef surrounds the islands of Raiatea and Tahaa which share the same lagoon. The boat trip from Raiatea to Tahaa across the lagoon only takes about 20 minutes. 

Raiatea&#x27;s landscape is characterized by rugged peaks, a heavily indented coastline with deeply indented bays, and numerous small, tiny islands located in the lagoon. 

There are three main mountain masses on the island, connected by lower ridges. The central mass includes Mount Tefatoaiti (1,017 m), the island&#x27;s highest peak. The northern mass is known as the Temehani Plateau. The plateau generally undulates between 600 and 650 metres elevation, rising higher in places including the plateau&#x27;s highest peak Tepahu (821 m). Oropiro is the highest peak in the southern mass.

The total population was 16,438 inhabitants in the 2002 census, distributed in three communes: Uturoa (the capital), Taputapuatea and Tumara&#x27;a. Uturoa is also the administrative capital of the Leeward Islands and the second urban center of French Polynesia, after Papeete.
The main island is of volcanic origin and consists mainly of igneous rocks. On the barrier reef and in the lagoon there are numerous white coral sand motu – low barrier reef islands – and rubble. The most beautiful sandy beaches are found on these motu, while the rocky coastline of the main island of Raiatea has no beaches worth mentioning. From the peaks, the highest of which is Toomaru at 1032 m,10 steeply sloping valleys and gorges open out to the sea, separated by narrow rocky ridges. The numerous streams often form spectacular waterfalls. The eastward-flowing Apoomau River rises in the 1017 m high Tefatoatiti,11 and flows into Faaroa Bay. It is the only navigable river in Polynesia and, depending on the water level, can be traveled a few kilometers in small boats.

Cultivated land and settlements are found in a narrow coastal strip; the interior of Raiatea is largely uninhabited.

=== Climate ===
The climate is tropical and humid. The average annual temperature is 26 °C, with negligible differences between months. The average annual rainfall is about 1800 mm. The rainiest month is December, but the rains are, as usual in the tropics, intense and of short duration. The (winter) months of August and September are quite dry.

=== Flora===

The vegetation of French Polynesia is characterized by two peculiarities: a high proportion of endemic plants and a relative scarcity of species. The isolated location of the islands and the fact that they have never been connected to a continental landmass explain the high number of endemic plants. In the South Pacific, plants range from west to east. This caused the biodiversity of the islands to decrease eastward. For example, the islands of New Guinea and New Caledonia, located in the west, have a much higher number of species compared to Raiatea. In contrast, the islands of the Tuamotu Archipelago, the Pitcairn Islands and Easter Island in the far eastern Pacific are much less species-rich.

In almost 2,000 years of settlement history, humans have decisively changed the flora of Raiatea with cultivation, especially in the fertile coastal areas. Coconut palms, breadfruit trees, taro, yams, cassava, sweet potatoes and various tropical fruits are grown as food crops, including a particularly tasty pineapple. Pineapple and vanilla fruits are exported and grown on small family farms.

Significant remnants of the original vegetation have survived in the inaccessible, lush interior of the island, although the native plant communities are now threatened by guava bushes, bamboo thickets and other anthropogenic plants.

The remaining natural vegetation on the island consists mostly of savanna and evergreen forest, with areas of coastal strand and hillside scrub. Raiatea has more savanna than the other Society islands. Most savanna is dominated by the bright green fern &quot;Dicranopteris linearis&quot;, which can form dense patches up to two metres high, interspersed with clumps of darker trees. Drier areas, including lower slopes and ridges on the north and northwest sides of the island, are dominated by &quot;Miscanthus floridulus&quot;, known as aiho or sword grass, a tall coarse bunch grass. The introduced molasses grass (&quot;Melinis minutiflora&quot;) is also common, forming lower gray-green patches among the bunchgrasses.

Lowland forests are dominated by &quot;mape&quot; trees (&quot;Inocarpus fagifer&quot;), which grow up to 25 meters high. Mape trees have large, fluted, and buttressed trunks and dense canopies. The seed pods are roasted and eaten by local people. Other lowland forest trees include &quot;Hibiscus tiliaceus&quot;, breadfruit (&quot;Artocarpus altilis&quot;), and &quot;Cananga odorata&quot;, along with stands of the native bamboo &quot;Schizostachyum glaucifolium&quot;. Understory plants include the fern &quot;Angiopteris evecta&quot; and coffee (&quot;Coffea arabica&quot;), which was introduced to the islands for cultivation and now forms a dense shrub undergrowth in parts of the forest.
The Temehani Plateau is home to a distinctive scrub forest, with shrubs and low trees rising .5 to 1 meter high and occasionally to 2 or 3 meters high. Characteristic plants include &#x27; (endemic to Raiatea), &quot;Pterophylla vescoi, Pandanus tectorius, Metrosideros collina&quot;, and species of &quot;Canthium, Wikstroemia, Alstonia, Astronia, Glochidion, Styphelia, Bidens, Xylosma, Garnotia, Sphenomeris, Lycopodium&quot;, and &quot;Cassytha&quot;. The grass-like sedges &quot;Gahnia schoenoides&quot; and &#x27; are predominant in the understory and in open areas. Tiare apetahi (&quot;Sclerotheca raiateensis&quot;) is a shrub known only from the Temehani Plateau. It is known for its large fragrant flowers. The plant has been over-collected and attacked by introduced rats, and is now critically endangered. 

The following legend is associated with the fragrant yellowish-white tiare apetahi flower: A princess who died in the arms of her beloved promised to hold his hand tenderly every time she climbed Mount Temehani. When she climbed the mountain the next morning, she saw wonderfully fragrant flowers growing everywhere, with five petals reaching out to him like hands. He dug up a plant to plant in the garden in memory of his beloved, but it withered within a few days.

===Fauna===
One endemic bird was the brown-headed parakeet (&quot;Cyanoramphus ulietanus&quot;). It was discovered by Captain Cook&#x27;s crew. After an eventful stay in Tahiti, where Captain Cook also witnessed a human sacrifice, he left on September 29, 1777, to explore other islands in the atoll. He first went to nearby Eimeo (present-day Maiao), where he stayed briefly, and then headed for Ulitea (present-day Raiatea), which is only a few days northwest of Tahiti. During his 34-day stay, a unique parrot was collected on the island. At least two specimens have been preserved for posterity and are in museums in London and Vienna. Unfortunately, there are no reports on the way of life of this parakeet.

During his time at Raiatea, Cook had the ships Resolution and Discovery brought ashore for urgent maintenance work. It is possible that this time was sufficient for rats, cockroaches and other vermin to wash ashore, and it appears that it was they that sealed the brown-headed parakeet&#x27;s demise.

Mammals did not originally exist on the Society Islands; they were all introduced by humans. The early Polynesian settlers brought dogs, pigs, chickens and the Pacific rat as food animals, and Europeans introduced goats, cows, sheep and horses. The indigenous land animals are only insects, land crabs, snails and lizards. In Raiatea there are no animals dangerous to humans. Sand fleas on the beach and mosquitoes, which are everywhere in the interior of the island, can be unpleasant.

The marine fauna of the lagoon and coral reef is very rich in species. In addition to hundreds of different coral fish, divers can observe numerous mollusks, echinoderms and crustaceans from the tropical sea. The waters surrounding Raiatea and Tahaa are known for their rich population of colorful nudibranchs. The reefs are dotted with grottoes and caves that provide shelter for many marine creatures. Among divers, the &quot;octopus grotto&quot;, located between Raiatea and Tahaa, is well known. Behind the reef are sharks, rays, swordfish and sea turtles.

Raiatea was known as the &quot;center of &quot;Partula&quot; biodiversity&quot; due to having the most species of &quot;Partula&quot;, 33 species in total. Unfortunately, like all of the Society Islands, &quot;Euglandina rosea&quot; was introduced to the islands, resulting in the extinction of 30 species. The remaining 3 species, &quot;P. garrettii&quot;, &quot;P. hebe&quot;, and &quot;&quot; are extinct in the wild and would be extinct without human intervention.

==Administration==
Politically, Raiatea today belongs to French Polynesia. The island is a French overseas territory and is therefore associated with the European Union. It is administered by a subdivision (&quot;Subdivision administrative des Îles Sous-le-Vent&quot;) of the High Commission of French Polynesia (&quot;Haut-commissariat de la République en Polynésie française&quot;) based in Papeete.

The island is divided into three communes (municipalities):
* Uturoa
* Taputapuatea
* Tumaraa

These three communes are inside the administrative subdivision of the Leeward Islands.

Raiatea had a total of 12,832 inhabitants according to 2012 data, with a population density of 66 inhabitants/km2.

The official language is French. The currency is the CFP franc, which is pegged to the euro. The administrative budget of the Society Islands is substantially subsidized by French and EU funds.

The main town is Uturoa, in the north of the island, which is also the administrative and economic center of the Leeward Islands.

==Economy==
The island economy is mainly agricultural with exports of vanilla, pineapple and coconut. The plant &quot;Nono&quot; (or &quot;noni&quot;) (&quot;Morinda citrifolia&quot;) is also grown. Fā&#x27;aroa Valley is a large and important agricultural region with the rural economy and the cultivation of vanilla supported by a local research facility. Pearl farming is also an important industry while farming cattle, sheep and pigs has recently decreased. There is less tourism compared to the other islands in the archipelago. The local tourist infrastructure comprises boarding houses, two marinas, a four star hotel, The Hawaiki Nui and a port for visiting cruise ships. There is also a fledgling local industry in the maintenance of yachts and shipbuilding. The main source of employment is the island&#x27;s public service and the consumer market. Raiatea has a small road that runs around the entire island. Raiatea Airport is an airport in Uturoa.

== Tourism ==
Although the island has several hotels up to the luxury category, Raiatea is quieter and less developed in terms of tourism compared to Tahiti and Bora Bora. Raiatea is especially attractive to offshore sailors. There are several yacht charter companies, and the island is often referred to as the nautical center of Polynesia. There are marinas with good infrastructure in Uturoa and Baie Faaroa to the west. The island is visited by cruise ships from time to time.
=== Places of interest ===
The somewhat sleepy-looking main town of Uturoa offers no special attractions. For cruise ship tourists, the port&#x27;s reception terminal was redesigned a few years ago, a small park was laid out and the esplanade was paved with natural stones from the island in various colors. Portuguese craftsmen were in charge of laying the beautiful motifs in traditional Portuguese style. The botanical garden of Uturoa is interesting with many rare and exotic plants.

The main attraction of Raiatea is undoubtedly the Taputapuatea place of worship. It comprises several worship platforms (marae) that were originally distributed in a sacred grove surrounded by tabu. Several of the sites have been restored. The largest platform was built in the early 17th century with huge upright limestone slabs and is dedicated to Oro, the god of war.

There are other important ceremonial sites on the island. In the Avera valley, north of Opoa on the east coast, is another large ceremonial platform. Nearby, archaeological excavations have uncovered the remains of dwellings and stone tool workshops. The ceremonial site at Tainuu, on the northwest coast, is also well preserved. In addition to the imposing coral rock slabs with which the marae were delimited, petroglyphs are also preserved here. On this site, sacred to the Polynesians, missionaries built a church in the 19th century.

An interesting destination for divers is the wreck of the Nordby, a Danish trimotor that sank around 1900. The wreck, very well preserved, is located at a depth of about 20 m, not far from the Pearl Beach Resort on the northeast coast.

== Infrastructure ==

The island is surrounded by a 98 km road, while another road runs through the center. Since the 1980s, numerous infrastructure works have been carried out to improve the road network and open up the southern part of the island by building bridges, asphalting and installing electricity, telephone and drinking water distribution networks.

The port of Uturoa was remodeled in the early 2000s, allowing cruise ships such as the Tahitian Princess, the Gauguin, the Amsterdam and the World to make weekly calls during the tourist season. Raiatea is the administrative capital of the Leeward Islands and the residence of the state administrator.

There is a hospital, a general secondary school (called LUT, which celebrated its 60th anniversary in May 2021) and a vocational school, three secondary schools (one of which is private) and several primary schools and kindergartens.

Raiatea is the only French Polynesian island (outside of Tahiti) with a secondary school. Therefore, most students from neighboring islands, such as Bora-Bora, Tahaa, Maupiti or Huahine, come here for their secondary education. The island also has an airfield, a commercial port, a market and two marinas.
