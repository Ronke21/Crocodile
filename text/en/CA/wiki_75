<doc id="780592" wikidata="Q1034643" url="?curid=780592" title="Head Like a Hole">
<text>&quot;Head Like a Hole&quot; is a song by the American industrial rock band Nine Inch Nails, released as the second single from the group&#x27;s debut album, &quot;Pretty Hate Machine&quot;. It enjoyed heavy rotation on the radio at the time of its release, eventually reaching number 9 on &quot;Billboard&quot; Bubbling Under Hot 100 chart.

It has been covered by several artists, including Devo, AFI, Buckcherry and Korn. The song was rewritten as &quot;On a Roll&quot; (performed by Miley Cyrus in character as Ashley O) for the &quot;Black Mirror&quot; episode &quot;Rachel, Jack and Ashley Too&quot;.

==Recording==
Trent Reznor wrote &quot;Head Like a Hole&quot; after having toured in late 1988 as the support act for Skinny Puppy. The song was produced by Reznor and was co-produced by Flood and Keith LeBlanc, it was recorded in 1989. Unlike the other songs on the album, Reznor wrote &quot;Head Like a Hole&quot; very quickly &quot;in about fifteen minutes in his bedroom.&quot; It was one of the last songs completed for the album, since Flood did not arrive to the studio until the completion of Depeche Mode&#x27;s &quot;Violator&quot; (1990). Reznor said that the song emerged from the feel that &quot;I needed something to kind of break the guitars out and be a bit more aggressive&quot;, while also conveying his fears that TVT Records would not be helpful to him, with the aggression turned up further by producer Keith LeBlanc after Reznor learned that the label had not liked the early version of his album.

==Music and lyrics==
&quot;Head Like a Hole&quot; has been classified as an industrial rock and electronic rock song, and recognized as an &quot;industrial dance anthem&quot;. The tempo is 115 BPM, and it is played in the key of E Minor. Although one of the more rock-oriented tracks on the album, many elements of electronic and dance music are still featured. The lyrical contents deal with themes of betrayal and angst, consistent with the rest of the album.

The chords of this song are similar to the project&#x27;s debut single, &quot;Down in It&quot;. In contrast to &quot;Down in It&quot;, &quot;Head Like a Hole&quot; has a longer intro, lasts roughly one minute longer (the song is five minutes long in its aggregate length), is heavy metal music-oriented, and has no rapping. &quot;Head Like a Hole&quot; is also the opening track on Nine Inch Nails&#x27; 1989 debut album, and is one of the two Nine Inch Nails songs produced by Flood to appear on &quot;Pretty Hate Machine&quot;.

==Release and reception==
Labeled as &quot;Halo 3&quot;, &quot;Head Like a Hole&quot; is the third official Nine Inch Nails release, containing remixes of three different songs from &quot;Pretty Hate Machine&quot;. The single release is longer in duration than the album itself. The single peaked at #28 on the &quot;Billboard Modern Rock Tracks&quot; chart.

A three-track version of this single was released in the UK containing &quot;Head Like a Hole (Opal)&quot; which is not included on the US release. This version begins with a sample of &quot;Tamborine&quot; by Prince, taken from his 1985 album &quot;Around the World in a Day&quot; and incorporates a drum loop sampled from &quot;Release It&quot; taken from another Prince record, the soundtrack to the Prince-directed movie &quot;Graffiti Bridge&quot; (1990). The saxophone in &quot;Release It&quot; can be heard before the drum loop begins. &quot;Head Like a Hole (Copper)&quot; samples the looping drum beat from &quot;Body Language&quot;, a track off of the &quot;Hot Space&quot; (1982) album by Queen. The first track is mistakenly listed as &quot;Head Like a Hole (Slate)&quot; on the CD. &quot;Down in It (Shred)&quot; and &quot;Down in It (Singe)&quot; were previously released on the &quot;Down in It&quot; single; the latter track is extended by 18 seconds. The unlisted eleventh track is host Heather Day yelling &quot;Let&#x27;s hear it for Nine Inch Nails! Woo! They&#x27;re good!&quot; This is a sample from &quot;Dance Party USA&quot; during an appearance by the band on the show.

&quot;Head Like a Hole&quot; was re-issued as a single in Australia in 1995, where it peaked at #57 on the ARIA singles chart and spent 7 weeks in the top 100.

The 11-track United States version of &quot;Head Like a Hole&quot; has recently been repackaged and re-released. This version was also released in the United Kingdom, where it failed to reach the Top 40 Finally, in Germany, the single was released as &quot;You Get What You Deserve&quot;. This release includes four tracks.

In a retrospective review of the song, Allmusic described &quot;Head Like a Hole&quot; as &quot;grand theater&quot;, elaborating further by commenting the &quot;backing music was immaculately crafted and produced&quot;. In its review of the single, the author was largely positive towards the song selection, even saying that the inclusion of &quot;Head Like a Hole&quot;, &quot;Terrible Lie&quot;, and &quot;Down in It&quot; &quot;renders &quot;Pretty Hate Machine&quot; mostly unnecessary&quot;. As for the other tracks included on the single, Allmusic was less positive, adding, &quot;This is one case where quality definitely would have sufficed without the quantity&quot;.

The single was included in the 2015 Record Store Day–Black Friday exclusive box set, &quot;Halo I–IV&quot;.

In 2020, &quot;Kerrang&quot; and &quot;Billboard&quot; ranked the song number eight and number two, respectively, on their lists of the greatest Nine Inch Nails songs.

==Music video==
A music video was made for the &quot;Clay&quot; remix of this song. Directed by Eric Zimmerman, it was released in March 1990 and again later in 1997 on the &quot;Closure&quot; VHS. The video became popular on MTV and helped fuel NIN&#x27;s early success. A slightly different edit of the video was also released for Flood&#x27;s remix of the song, which is 17 seconds shorter than the &quot;Clay&quot; remix. The video features band members Trent Reznor, Richard Patrick, and Chris Vrenna, as well as guest drummer Martin Atkins performing in a cage.

The video was filmed at the original location of Exit nightclub which was located at 1653 North Wells Street in Chicago.

The video begins with black and white footage of a person hopping on one foot while spinning a staff, which fades in and out against a background of blurred colors (excerpts of Maya Deren&#x27;s unfinished documentary on voodoo rituals &quot;Divine Horsemen: The Living Gods of Haiti&quot;). Clips of Reznor putting his head in a bucket of water and an unseen person dumping water from the same bucket onto Reznor were taken by a video camera before filming a performance of the song from Nine Inch Nails as a live band.

Reznor&#x27;s guitar in the video is a Jackson Dinky. It is first seen in first chorus, when Reznor, appearing to be dirty like the other band members (he had long hair and wore gritty clothing during production), bangs his head while singing the chorus. He does not use the guitar for the video&#x27;s climax, where wires tied to his ankles slowly pull him up, leaving the frontman spinning upside down from the ceiling. At the same scene, Vrenna destroys his drum kit by throwing a bass drum of Atkins&#x27; drum kit towards the object. At a shot occurring prior to that point, broken Zildjian cymbals and a drum machine can be seen as parts of Vrenna&#x27;s kit.

There are images that are shown for a few frames like &quot;HEAD&quot;, &quot;16 SOUND START&quot;, &quot;S M P T E UNIVERSAL LEADER&quot; and &quot;PICTURE&quot;. Other images included a white dot set against a black background, a mirrored presentation showing the words &quot;REEL № PROD № PLAY DATE&quot; colored in yellow, one with the words &quot;PICTURE START&quot;, and a frame consisting of &quot;C C F F&quot; placed near an outlined ring. The latter screen had an alternative version that was accompanied by a white number 3, also seen in the video. There are also visuals of four incomplete rotating mechanical models of human heads; one with film stills, another with a modified motherboard and other technology, the purple, wired, head with a blue screen showing an eye and various computer hardware, and the last containing blue skin, orange-pupil eyes, and a lightbulb. The former two were filmed in black and white, while the latter two in full color. All four are shown intercut with shots of people spinning baseball bats.

==Live performances==

The song has been the encore for most NIN shows (especially the &quot;Pretty Hate Machine Tour Series&quot;), or the last song before the encore if an encore took place. There are live videos of &quot;Head Like a Hole&quot; on the DVDs &quot;And All That Could Have Been&quot; and &quot;Beside You in Time&quot;.

During Lollapalooza &#x27;91, Dave Navarro, Eric Avery, Gibby Haynes and Ice-T joined Nine Inch Nails live performances on-stage as additional guitarists for &quot;Head Like a Hole;&quot; except for the first show in Phoenix, AZ when NIN walked off stage after the first song in frustration.
For the &quot;Nights of Nothing&quot; mini-tour in 1996, Richard Patrick made a brief return to the band to perform guitar and vocals on &quot;Head Like a Hole&quot; at the Irving Plaza show in New York along with Clint Mansell, who joined NIN on this song at all three shows of the tour.
In the June 7, 2006 radio performance at Atlanta, Georgia, Trent Reznor and Peter Murphy played a reworked version of &quot;Head Like a Hole&quot;.

Lisa Kennedy Montgomery once sang the song loudly to Reznor to win a $20 bet. To express the evolving state of his values, Reznor said in 1997 that &quot;I don&#x27;t want to be singing &quot;Head Like a Hole&quot; at age 50.&quot;

==Legacy==
Since its commercial maxi-single release, &quot;Head Like a Hole&quot; continues to generate an impact on other musicians and bands. &quot;PopMatters&quot; ranked the track 37th on their list of &quot;The 100 Greatest Alternative Singles of the ‘80s&quot;.

=== Cover versions ===
&quot;Head Like a Hole&quot; is the most widely covered Nine Inch Nails song. In 2005, The String Quartet Tribute released a cover album of reworked versions of &quot;Pretty Hate Machine&quot;, including &quot;Head Like a Hole&quot;. Other bands who covered the track include punk rock band AFI, rock artist Ryan Star, new wave band Devo, indie rock band Honest Bob and the Factory-to-Dealer Incentives, gothic metal band Lullacry, nu metal band Korn, post-industrial band PIG, hard rock band Buckcherry, and Christian rock band Showbread. Deathcore act Carnifex did a cover of the song on their EP, &quot;Bury Me In Blasphemy&quot;. New Zealand-based grunge band HLAH is named after the song. The name is sometimes abbreviated to avoid copyright infringement issues.

=== In popular culture ===
The song was remixed and rewritten by Charlie Brooker with Reznor&#x27;s approval as the pop song &quot;On a Roll&quot; for the fifth series episode &quot;Rachel, Jack and Ashley Too&quot; of &quot;Black Mirror&quot;. The song was released as a single on June 14, 2019. At the end of the episode, Cyrus performed a cover version of &quot;Head Like a Hole&quot;.

=== Ban ===
&quot;Head Like a Hole&quot; was banned from airplay after the September 11 attacks, when Clear Channel Communications placed it in a 2001 list of post-9/11 inappropriate song titles not for radio airplay.

<text>Lake Wanapitei (also known as Lake Wahnapitae) occupies a meteorite crater in Sudbury, Ontario, Canada. It is located near the much larger Sudbury meteorite crater but they are not related.

The crater is in diameter and the age is estimated to be 37.2 ± 1.2 million years, placing it in the Eocene.

It was evident by the mid-1970s that Wanapitei Lake was an impact crater. Remarkably, it lies on the eastern edge of the much older, larger Sudbury structure. Cobbles of suevite, crumbly impact breccia cobbles containing bits of dark glass, are found surrounding the lake. Some contain coesite, a high pressure mineral diagnostic of impact structures. The suevite is very close in appearance and composition to that described from the Ries impact crater.

In the 1960s, half a dozen RCMP officers accidentally drowned in the lake during a training exercise.

The lake is a popular recreational and residential area in Sudbury, with the neighborhoods of Skead and Boland&#x27;s Bay located on its shores. With the municipal amalgamation of Greater Sudbury in 2001, it became the largest lake in the world completely contained within the boundaries of a single city. It inherited this status from Lake Ramsey, also in Sudbury.

The Wanapitei River flows through the lake. Wanapitei Provincial Park is located on the north shore of Lake Wanapitei — this is a non-operating park so there are no facilities. The lake has a number of small islands within it. Named islands include Blueberry, Howie, Pirate Island, Wanapitei, MacLennan, and Bonanza. Some of the islands are unpopulated, although a few have recreational cottages located on them. The small Wahnapitae Ojibwe reserve is also located on the lake&#x27;s northwestern shore.

The lake&#x27;s name comes from the Ojibwa word &quot;waanabidebiing&quot;, or &quot;concave-tooth [shaped] water&quot;, which describes its shape. A nearby community which takes its name from the river is spelled Wahnapitae. However, the Wanapitei spelling is correct for both the lake and the river.

<doc id="780603" wikidata="Q1066598" url="?curid=780603" title="The Open Society and Its Enemies">
<text>The Open Society and Its Enemies is a work on political philosophy by the philosopher Karl Popper, in which the author presents a defence of the open society against its enemies, and offers a critique of theories of teleological historicism, according to which history unfolds inexorably according to universal laws. Popper indicts Plato, Hegel, and Marx for relying on historicism to underpin their political philosophies.

Written during World War II, &quot;The Open Society and Its Enemies&quot; was published in 1945 in London by Routledge in two volumes: &quot;The Spell of Plato&quot; and &quot;The High Tide of Prophecy: Hegel, Marx, and the Aftermath&quot;. A one-volume edition with a new introduction by Alan Ryan and an essay by E. H. Gombrich was published by Princeton University Press in 2013. The work was listed as one of the Modern Library Board&#x27;s 100 Best Nonfiction books of the 20th century.

The book critiques historicism and defends the open society and liberal democracy. Popper argues that Plato&#x27;s political philosophy has dangerous tendencies towards totalitarianism, contrary to the benign idyll portrayed by most interpreters. He praises Plato&#x27;s analysis of social change but rejects his solutions, which he sees as driven by fear of change brought about by the rise of democracies, and as contrary to the humanitarian and democratic views of Socrates and other thinkers of the Athenian &quot;Great Generation&quot;. Popper also criticizes Hegel, tracing his ideas to Aristotle and arguing that they were at the root of philosophical underpinnings of 20th century totalitarianism. He agrees with Schopenhauer&#x27;s view that Hegel &quot;was a flat-headed, insipid, nauseating, illiterate charlatan, who reached the pinnacle of audacity in scribbling together and dishing up the craziest mystifying nonsense.&quot; Popper criticizes Marx at length for his historicism, which he believes led him to overstate his case, and rejects his radical and revolutionary outlook. Popper advocates for direct liberal democracy as the only form of government that allows institutional improvements without violence and bloodshed.

== Summary ==

Popper&#x27;s book is divided into two volumes, which were only published as one volume in more recent editions. The first volume, &quot;The Spell of Plato&quot;, focuses on Plato, and the second volume, &quot;The High Tide of Prophecy&quot;, focuses on Karl Marx.

=== Volume 1: The Spell of Plato ===
The first section, &quot;The Myth of Origin and Destiny&quot;, contains chapters 1 through 3. The second section, &quot;Plato&#x27;s Descriptive Sociology&quot;, contains chapters 4 and 5. The third section, &quot;Plato&#x27;s Political Programme&quot;, contains chapters 6 through 9. The fourth and last section of the first volume, &quot;The Background of Plato&#x27;s Attack&quot;, only contains chapter 10. The volume is closed by an unnumbered section of &quot;Addenda&quot;.

==== The Myth of Origin and Destiny ====
Chapter 1, &quot;Historicism and the Myth of Destiny&quot;, describes the historicist approach to social sciences, which Popper considers to be a flawed method. Historicism is &quot;the doctrine that history is controlled by specific historical or evolutionary laws whose discovery would enable us to prophesy the destiny of man.&quot; Popper argues that the historicist approach gives poor results, and he outlines a method that he believes would yield better results. He also discusses how historicism originated and became entrenched in our culture. Popper provides &quot;the doctrine of the chosen people&quot; as an example of historicism. The doctrine assumes that God has chosen one people to be the selected instrument of His will, and that this people will inherit the earth – the law of historical development is laid down by the will of God. Popper argues that &quot;the doctrine of the chosen people&quot; grew out of the tribal form of social life, and he notes that other forms of historicist theories may still retain an element of collectivism. Popper identifies the two most important modern versions of historicism as the historical philosophy of racialism or fascism on the right and the Marxian historical philosophy on the left. Both theories base their historical forecasts on an interpretation of history which leads to the discovery of a law of its development.

Chapter 2, &quot;Heraclitus&quot;, focuses on the emergence of historicism in ancient Greece, specifically through the philosophy of Heraclitus. Heraclitus believed in the idea of universal change and hidden destiny enforced by punishment, and saw strife or war as the dynamic and creative principle of all change, especially in social life. His philosophy was inspired by his personal experiences of social and political disturbances, and his emphasis on the importance of social dynamics reflects this. Popper sees Heraclitus as a predecessor to Hegel.

Chapter 3, &quot;Plato&#x27;s Theory of Forms or Ideas&quot;, discusses the eponymous theory. It is longer than the first two chapters, and is divided by Popper into six parts. According to Popper, Plato&#x27;s philosophy was heavily influenced by his experiences of political turmoil and instability, and he believed that moral degeneration leads to political degeneration. He strove to arrest this political change by establishing a state that does not degenerate or change, which he saw as the perfect state of the Golden Age. While Plato deviated from the tenets of historicism by believing in an ideal state that does not change, he shared with Heraclitus a tendency to shrink back from the last consequences of historicism.

This chapter introduces Popper&#x27;s distinction between the &quot;social engineer&quot; and the &quot;historicist&quot;, of which he favors the former. The social engineer believes that humans can control history to achieve their goals, and sees politics as a tool to build and modify social institutions; he evaluates institutions based on their design, efficiency, and other practical factors. (Popper identifies two types of social engineering: piecemeal and utopian, which he further discusses in chapter nine.) In contrast, the historicist is interested in understanding the past, present, and future significance of institutions. They evaluate institutions based on their historical role, such as if they are divinely willed or serving important historical trends. Popper acknowledges that institutions are not simply machines and can have unique characteristics beyond their practical purpose.

This chapter also introduces Popper&#x27;s distinction between  two different methods of understanding things: &quot;methodological essentialism&quot; and &quot;methodological nominalism&quot;, of which he favors the latter. Methodological essentialism is the view that science should aim to uncover the hidden reality or essence of things through intellectual intuition and to describe it in words through definitions. Methodological nominalism, by contrast, emphasizes the importance of describing how things behave in different situations, and especially whether there are any regularities in their behavior. According to Popper, natural sciences mostly use methodological nominalism, while the social sciences still rely on essentialist methods, which is one of the reasons for their backwardness. Popper notes that some people argue that the difference in method between natural and social sciences reflects an essential difference between the two fields, but he disagrees with this view.

==== Plato&#x27;s Descriptive Sociology ====
Chapter 4, &quot;Change and Rest&quot;, describes Plato&#x27;s sociology as based on the theory of Forms and universal flux and decay. It is long, and divided into five parts. According to Popper, Plato believed change can only lead towards imperfection and evil, which is a process of degeneration – he saw history as an illness, and set out a system of historical periods governed by a law of evolution. Plato&#x27;s ideal state was not a progressive Utopian vision of the future, but rather a historical or even pre-historical one that attempted to reconstruct ancient tribal aristocracies to avoid class war. The ruling class in Plato&#x27;s best state has an unchallengeable superiority and education. Breeding and training of the ruling class was necessary for ensuring stability, and Plato demanded the same principles be applied as in breeding dogs, horses, or birds. Popper summarizes Plato&#x27;s systematic historicist sociology, which was an attempt to understand and interpret the changing social world.

Chapter 5, &quot;Nature and Convention&quot;, introduces Popper&#x27;s distinction between natural laws and normative laws. Popper divides stages of the development of this distinction throughout history, and then applies it to a further analysis of Plato. According to Popper, natural laws describe strict, unvarying regularities in nature, such as the laws of motion and gravity, while normative laws are rules that forbid or demand certain modes of conduct, such as the Ten Commandments. Normative laws can be enforced by people and are alterable, whereas natural laws are beyond human control and unalterable.

Popper believes that this distinction developed throughout history, starting from a naïve or magical monism, where there is no distinction made between natural and normative laws, and unpleasant experiences are the means by which people learn to adjust to their environment. Within this stage, there are two possibilities: &quot;naïve naturalism&quot; and &quot;naïve conventionalism&quot;. In the latter possibility, both natural and normative regularities are experienced as expressions of and dependent upon the decisions of man-like gods or demons. The breakdown of magical tribalism is connected to the realization that taboos are different in various tribes, that they are imposed and enforced by man, and that they may be broken without unpleasant repercussions if one can only escape the sanctions imposed by one&#x27;s fellow-men. The development ends at what Popper calls critical dualism, which is the idea that norms and normative laws can be made and changed by humans, and cannot be derived from natural regularities or laws, although they are not necessarily arbitrary. This position was first reached by the Sophist Protagoras. It emphasizes that humans are morally responsible for norms, and should try to improve them if they are objectionable. It can also be described as a dualism of facts and decisions, meaning that decisions must be compatible with natural laws to be carried out, but they cannot be derived from those laws. Decisions can refer to a certain decision that has been made or the act of deciding itself.

According to Popper, there are three intermediate positions in this development from naïve monism to critical dualism, namely &quot;biological naturalism&quot;, &quot;ethical or juridical positivism&quot;, and &quot;psychological or spiritual naturalism&quot;, which combine elements of magical monism and critical dualism. Biological naturalism &quot;is the theory that in spite of the fact that moral laws and the laws of states are arbitrary, there are some eternal unchanging laws of nature from which we can derive such norms.&quot; Popper argues that biological naturalism cannot be used to support ethical doctrines since it is impossible to base norms upon facts. Ethical positivism, on the other hand, believes that existing laws are the only possible standards of goodness and that norms are conventional. However, ethical positivism has often been conservative or authoritarian, invoking the authority of God. Popper argues that authoritarian or conservative principles are an expression of ethical nihilism, which is an extreme moral scepticism and a distrust of man and his possibilities. Psychological or spiritual naturalism is a combination of the two previous views, arguing that norms are a product of man and human society and, therefore, &quot;an expression of the psychological or spiritual nature of man, and of the nature of human society.&quot; Popper says that this view was first formulated by Plato, and that although it is &quot;plausible&quot;, it is &quot;so wide and so vague that it may be used to defend anything&quot;.

Having laid down these distinctions, Popper uses the final parts of Chapter 5 to analyze Plato some more. Popper analyzes Plato&#x27;s use of the term &quot;nature&quot; and its relationship with historicism. He also discusses Plato&#x27;s view of the state as a super-organism, where the state is viewed as a unified whole and the individual citizen as an imperfect copy of the state. Plato&#x27;s emphasis on oneness and wholeness is related to tribal collectivism, and he saw the individual as a means to serve the whole. Popper also discusses Plato&#x27;s theory of degeneration in the state, where degeneration is a natural evolutionary law that causes decay in all generated things. Plato suggests that knowledge of breeding and the Platonic Number can prevent racial degeneration, but lacking a purely rational method, it will eventually occur. The basis of Plato&#x27;s historicist sociology is racial degeneration, which &quot;explains the origin of disunion in the ruling class, and with it, the origin of all historical development&quot;.

==== Plato&#x27;s Political Programme ====
Chapter 6, &quot;Totalitarian Justice&quot;, analyzes what Popper describes as the totalitarian nature of Plato&#x27;s political philosophy, which he believes is based on historicism and on Plato&#x27;s &quot;sociological doctrines concerning the conditions for the stability of class rule&quot;, as well as the philosopher&#x27;s idea of justice and the philosopher-king. Popper argues that Plato intentionally introduced confusion by claiming, &quot;in the &quot;Republic&quot;, that justice meant inequality&quot; and class hierarchy, whereas &quot;in general usage&quot; in his time, &quot;it meant equality&quot;. Popper discusses equalitarianism, individualism, and collectivism, and how they relate to Plato&#x27;s opposition to natural privileges for natural leaders; he concludes that Plato&#x27;s anti-individualism is deeply rooted in the fundamental dualism of his philosophy, and is anti-humanitarian and anti-Christian. Chapter 6 introduces Popper&#x27;s theory of the state, which he calls protectionism, in the special sense that the state&#x27;s primary purpose should be &quot;the &quot;protection&quot; of the citizens&#x27; freedom&quot;. Although he believes it to be a liberal theory, he distinguishes it from the &quot;policy of strict non-intervention&quot;, a.k.a. &quot;laissez-faire&quot;, since he believes that &quot;protection of freedom&quot; may be conceived of quite broadly, and may encompass measures of state control in education, since those may protect the young &quot;from a neglect which would make them unable to defend their freedom&quot;. He acknowledges, however, that &quot;too much state control in educational matters is a fatal danger to freedom, since it must lead to indoctrination&quot; – he believes that &quot;the important and difficult question of the limitations of freedom cannot be solved by a cut and dried formula.&quot;

Chapter 7, &quot;The Principle of Leadership&quot;, critiques Plato&#x27;s idea &quot;that the natural rulers should rule and the natural slaves should slave&quot;. He argues that political power is not unchecked, and using this argument, he replaces Plato&#x27;s fundamental question of &quot;Who should rule?&quot; with &quot;How can we so organize political institutions that bad or incompetent rulers can be prevented from doing too much damage?&quot; He discusses the distinction between personalism and institutionalism in politics – he believes that the problems of the day are largely personal, while building the future must necessarily be institutional. Popper also discusses Socrates&#x27; moral intellectualism and its democratic and anti-democratic aspects, as well as Plato&#x27;s institutional demands regarding the highest form of education. He argues that &quot;the very idea of selecting or educating future leaders is self-contradictory&quot;, and that &quot;the secret of intellectual excellence is the spirit of criticism&quot;.

Chapter 8, &quot;The Philosopher King&quot;, analyses Plato&#x27;s idea of the philosopher king and how it relates to totalitarianism. Plato&#x27;s philosopher king is not necessarily a truth seeker but a ruler who must use lies and deceit for the benefit of the state. Popper argues that Plato&#x27;s emphasis on breeding for the creation of a race of godlike men and women destined for kingship and mastery is an attempt to create a perfect society dominated by a class of rulers. Furthermore, Plato&#x27;s philosophy was a practical political manifesto rather than a theoretical treatise, and his idea of the philosopher king was an ideal ruler and not just a theoretical construct. Popper suggests that Plato considered only a few individuals, including himself and some of his friends, as true philosophers eligible for the post of philosopher-king.

Chapter 9, &quot;Aestheticism, Perfectionism, Utopianism&quot;, focuses on Popper&#x27;s distinction between two approaches to social engineering: &quot;utopian engineering&quot; and &quot;piecemeal engineering&quot;, of which he favors the latter. Utopian engineering requires a blueprint of the ideal society, in rough outline at least, and determines practical action by considering the best means for realizing the ultimate political aim. In contrast, piecemeal engineering adopts &quot;the method of searching for, and fighting against, the greatest and most urgent evils of society, rather than searching for, and fighting for, its greatest ultimate good.&quot; The piecemeal engineer aims to improve the current situation of society by gradually fighting against suffering, injustice, and war, and other such social evils whose existence can be established relatively easily. In contrast, utopian engineering is less likely to be supported by the approval and agreement of a great number of people, since it is difficult to judge a blueprint for social engineering on a grand scale. Indeed, since Utopian engineers, according to Popper, tend to deny &quot;that there are rational methods to determine once and for all&quot; what the ideal is, and what the best means of its realization are&quot;, it follows that &quot;any difference of opinion between Utopian engineers must therefore lead, in the absence of rational methods, to the use of power instead of reason, i.e. to violence.&quot; Popper argues that the piecemeal approach, which involves small-scale social experiments, is more effective and realistic than the utopian approach, which is more liable to attempt &quot;the reconstruction of society as a whole, i.e. very sweeping changes whose practical consequences are hard to calculate, owing to our limited experiences&quot;. Popper emphasizes the importance of gaining experience through trial and error, and compares social engineering to mechanical engineering. He contrasts his criticism of Platonic Idealism with Marx&#x27;s criticism of utopianism, advocating for a piecemeal approach to learn and change our views as we act.

==== The Background of Plato&#x27;s Attack ====

Chapter 10, titled &quot;The Open Society and Its Enemies&quot; like the book itself, examines Plato&#x27;s belief in happiness as part of his political program and argues that Plato&#x27;s treatment of happiness is &quot;analogous to his treatment of justice&quot;, and similarly distorts general usage by tying the concept to class hierarchy. Popper believes that Plato&#x27;s mission was to fight against social change and social dissension. The breakdown of the closed, tribal society, chiefly caused by the development of sea-communications and commerce, led to the partial dissolution of old ways of life, political revolutions and reactions, and the invention of critical discussion, which was free from magical obsessions. Athenian imperialism developed these two as its main characteristics. Popper discusses Thucydides&#x27; attitude towards democracy and Athens&#x27;s empire, arguing that Thucydides was an anti-democrat who viewed Athens&#x27;s empire as a form of tyranny. Popper defends Athens&#x27; imperial expansion by arguing that tribalist exclusiveness and self-sufficiency could only be superseded by some form of imperialism; he explains why some of the most thoughtful and gifted Athenians resisted the open society&#x27;s attraction, and introduces the &quot;Great Generation&quot;, the generation that lived in Athens just before and during the Peloponnesian War, which he considers a turning point in the history of mankind. Finally, he discusses Socrates&#x27; criticism of Athenian democracy and his belief in individualism, as well as what he considers Plato&#x27;s betrayal of Socrates by implicating him in &quot;his grandiose attempt to construct the theory of the arrested society&quot;. Plato&#x27;s argument against democracy, as Popper interprets it, is based on the belief that the root of evil is &quot;the &#x27;Fall of Man&#x27;, the breakdown of the closed society&quot;; according to Popper, Plato &quot;transfigured his hatred of individual initiative, and his wish to arrest all change, into a love of justice and temperance, of a heavenly state in which everybody is satisfied and happy and in which the crudity of money-grabbing is replaced by laws of generosity and friendship&quot;.

==== Addenda ====
A 1957 addendum to the first volume, &quot;Plato and Geometry&quot;, discusses Popper&#x27;s treatment of Plato&#x27;s views on geometry. A 1961 addendum, titled &quot;The Dating of the &quot;Theaetetus&quot;&quot;, discusses the dating of the Platonic dialogue by that name. A second 1961 addendum, titled &quot;Reply to a Critic&quot;, makes an extended reply to various claims made in the book &quot;In Defense of Plato,&quot; by Ronald B. Levinson. A final addendum, added in 1965 and untitled (numbered &quot;IV&quot;), recommends the book &quot;Modern Dictatorship&quot; by Diana Spearman, in particular its chapter titled &quot;The Theory of Autocracy&quot;.

=== Volume 2: The High Tide of Prophecy ===

The first section, &quot;The Rise of Oracular Philosophy&quot;, includes chapter 11 and chapter 12. The second section, &quot;Marx&#x27;s Method&quot;, contains chapter 13 through chapter 17. The third section, &quot;Marx&#x27;s Prophecy&quot;, includes chapter 18 through chapter 21. The fourth section, &quot;Marx&#x27;s Ethics&quot; has only chapter 22. The fifth section, &quot;The Aftermath&quot;, contains chapter 23 and chapter 24. A &quot;Conclusion&quot; section includes only chapter 25, and is followed by an unnumbered section of &quot;Addenda&quot;.

==== The Rise of Oracular Philosophy ====
Chapter 11, &quot;The Aristotelian Roots of Hegelianism&quot;, discusses the Aristotelian roots of historicism and its connections to totalitarianism. Popper examines Aristotle&#x27;s philosophy and his endorsement of Plato&#x27;s naturalistic theory of slavery, as well as his theory of the Best State. Popper also explains the problem of definitions and the essentialist method of Definitions used by Aristotle. He argues that modern science has a fundamentally different approach to definitions and scientific progress. Popper also discusses the conflict between the Platonic-Aristotelian philosophy and the Great Generation, and how Christianity initially opposed Platonizing Idealism and intellectualism, but changed significantly when it became powerful in the Roman empire.

Chapter 12, &quot;Hegel and the New Tribalism&quot;, is a long critique of Hegel&#x27;s philosophy, which Popper calls &quot;the source of all contemporary historicism&quot;. It is the longest single chapter in the book, and more than twice as long as either the average or median chapter. Popper argues that Hegel&#x27;s philosophy was unintelligible and deceptive. Focusing on &quot;Hegel&#x27;s Platonizing worship of the state,&quot; Popper suggests that Hegel&#x27;s philosophy was not inspired by a genuine pursuit of truth but rather by ulterior motives. The second section analyzes Hegel&#x27;s philosophy, contrasting it with that of Plato; it talks about &quot;the two pillars of Hegelianism&quot;, the dialectic triad and the philosophy of identity. Popper then states that the rest of the chapter will be confined to the practical political applications made by Hegel of these abstract theories, which will show the apologetic purpose of all his labours.

Popper argues that the rise of German nationalism has a strong affinity with the revolt against reason and the open society; he believes that &quot;the principle of the national state, that is to say, the political demand that the territory of every state should coincide with the territory inhabited by one nation&quot; is a myth, an irrational and Utopian dream of naturalism and tribal collectivism. He briefly discusses the development of the opinions of Fichte, who was one of the founders of German nationalism; then he goes back to criticizing &quot;Hegel&#x27;s hysterical historicism&quot;, which he views as &quot;the fertilizer to which modern totalitarianism owes its rapid growth&quot;. In the fifth section, he argues that &quot;nearly all the more important ideas of modern totalitarianism are directly inherited from Hegel&quot;. Popper states that &quot;the modern myth of Blood and Soil&quot;, which is central to fascist ideology, &quot;has its exact counterpart in Plato&#x27;s Myth of the Earthborn&quot;.

==== Marx&#x27;s Method ====

Chapter 13, &quot;Marx&#x27;s Sociological Determinism&quot;, is the first of Popper&#x27;s chapters on Marx. Popper argues that Marx&#x27;s historical prophecies did not come true, and Marx &quot;misled scores of intelligent people into believing that historical prophecy is the scientific way of approaching social problems&quot;. Popper critiques the idea of historical materialism, which is the foundation of Marxist theory, arguing that it is a flawed view of history that assumes, as he had phrased it in chapter 1, &quot;that there are specific historical laws which can be discovered, and upon which predictions regarding the future of mankind can be based&quot;. He also argues that historical change is not predetermined and that societies can choose their own path. Finally, Popper argues that the social world is too complex to be studied using the same methods as the natural sciences, and social scientists must use a different method that takes into account the complexity of human behavior and social institutions.

Chapter 14, &quot;The Autonomy of Sociology&quot;, develops Marx&#x27;s criticisms of psychologism, the idea that all social laws can be reduced to psychological laws. Popper does this in the form of an extended argument against Mill&#x27;s version of the idea, explaining at the end of the chapter that he did so because he considered Mill &quot;a worthier opponent than Hegel&quot;, who was Marx&#x27;s real target. He emphasizes the importance of the social environment and its institutions in explaining social phenomena. Popper critiques what he calls the conspiracy theory of society, which is &quot;the view that an explanation of a social phenomenon consists in the discovery of the men or groups who are interested in the occurrence of this phenomenon (sometimes it is a hidden interest which has first to be revealed), and who have planned and conspired to bring it about.&quot; He argues that the main task of social sciences is to analyze the unintended social repercussions of intentional human actions. He concludes that psychological analysis should not be used to develop a standard of what is considered rational behavior in a particular situation, and that the problems of society are irreducible to those of human nature.

Chapter 15, &quot;Economic Historicism&quot;, discusses Marx&#x27;s &quot;historical materialism&quot; philosophy, which replaces Hegelian psychologism with materialism. Popper distinguishes Marx&#x27;s philosophy from the beliefs held by what he calls &quot;Vulgar Marxists&quot;, in allusion to Marx&#x27;s term &quot;Vulgar Economist&quot;. Vulgar Marxists believe that Marx&#x27;s philosophy centers around the idea that &quot;&quot;economic motives&quot; and especially &quot;class interest&quot; are the driving forces of history&quot;, and that the goal of Marxism is to reveal the hidden motives of those in power who create social misery to gratify their desire for profit. Popper argues that this interpretation is a misreading of the philosophy of Marx, who believed that economic motives were &quot;symptoms of the corrupting influence of the social system&quot;, not &quot;the driving forces of history&quot;. He saw social &quot;phenomena as war, depression, unemployment, and hunger in the midst of plenty&quot; as &quot;unwanted social consequences of actions&quot; that were &quot;directed towards different results&quot;, rather than as &quot;the result of a cunning conspiracy&quot; on the part of those in power. Marx viewed human actors, including those in power, as &quot;puppets, irresistibly pulled by economic wires—by historical forces over which they have no control&quot;.

Marx viewed social science as scientific history focused on the material conditions of society, but Popper criticizes his historicism while supporting his economism, &quot;i.e. the claim that the economic organization of society, the organization of our exchange of matter with nature, is fundamental for all social institutions and especially for their historical development.&quot; Popper believes that Marx&#x27;s economism is valuable because it emphasizes the fundamental role of economic organization in all social institutions and historical development, but warns against reductionist and essentialist views.

Chapter 16, &quot;The Classes&quot;, discusses Marx&#x27;s statement that &quot;the history of all hitherto existing society is a history of class struggles&quot;, and its implications that history is determined by the war of classes rather than nations. He explains Marx&#x27;s theory of classes as an institutional or objective social situation that influences human minds and makes them act accordingly. Popper notes the dangers of oversimplifying political conflicts as struggles between exploiters and exploited, and warns of the dangers inherent in Marx&#x27;s sweeping historicist generalization. Despite his criticisms, Popper finds admirable Marx&#x27;s attempt to use the &quot;logic of the class situation&quot; to explain the working of institutions in the industrial system.

Chapter 17, &quot;The Legal and the Social System&quot;, discusses Marx&#x27;s theory of the state and the implications for political action. Marx believed that the legal and political system was a superstructure upon the actual productive forces of the economic system, and the state was an organ for class domination. Popper argues that although Marx&#x27;s theory was insightful, it contained only a grain of truth and has been refuted by subsequent experience. Popper suggests that economic interventionism is necessary to safeguard freedom, and political power is fundamental and can control economic power. He argues that formal freedom is essential in ensuring a democratic economic policy, and social engineering is necessary to tame economic demons. Popper criticizes the Marxist approach to the control of power and argues that democracy is the only means to achieve control over the state.

==== Marx&#x27;s Prophecy ====

Chapter 18, &quot;The Coming of Socialism&quot;, discusses Marx&#x27;s economic historicism. Popper explains Marx&#x27;s analysis of the economic forces of capitalism and his prophecy of the coming of socialism, which consisted of three steps. He argues that Marx&#x27;s conclusion of a classless society does not follow from the premises. He also notes that the economic system of modern democracies is different from the capitalism Marx described, and most of Marx&#x27;s ten-point program for a communist revolution has been put into practice in modern democracies. Popper argues that strengthening the premises of Marx&#x27;s prophetic argument could lead to a valid conclusion, but assumptions about moral and ideological factors are beyond our ability to reduce to economic factors. Popper examines the effects of Marx&#x27;s historical prophecy on recent European history and notes that Marxist leaders had no practical program beyond &quot;Workers of all countries, unite!&quot; and waited for the promised suicide of capitalism, but it was too late, and their opportunity was gone.

Chapter 19, &quot;The Social Revolution&quot;, is a further critique of Marxism, discussing its flaws and potential for violence. Popper argues that Marxism does not account for the many possible developments that could occur in society, and its prophecy of a potentially violent revolution is harmful. Popper also examines the ambiguous attitude towards the problem of violence in Marxist parties and how it influences the possibility of winning the battle of democracy. Ultimately, Popper asserts that all political problems are institutional problems and that progress towards more equality can only be safeguarded by the institutional control of power.

Chapter 20, &quot;Capitalism and Its Fate&quot;, discusses Marx&#x27;s theories of capitalism. Marx believed that the accumulation of capital would lead to &quot;(a) increased productivity; increase of wealth; and concentration of wealth in a few hands; (b) increase of pauperism and misery; the workers are kept on subsistence or starvation wages, mainly by the fact that the surplus of workers, called the &#x27;industrial reserve army&#x27;, keeps the wages on the lowest possible level.&quot; Popper criticizes Marx&#x27;s theory of value, but agrees with his analysis of the pressure exerted by surplus population on wages. However, he disputes Marx&#x27;s prophetic argument of the law of increasing misery and suggests that trade unions, collective bargaining, and strikes can prevent capitalists from using the industrial reserve army to keep wages down. Popper also discusses Marx&#x27;s theory of the trade cycle and surplus population, and his argument that the rate of profit tends to fall, leading to capitalism&#x27;s inevitable collapse.

Chapter 21, &quot;An Evaluation of the Prophecy&quot;, explains that Marx&#x27;s prophetic conclusions drawn from the observations of contemporary economic tendencies are invalid, mainly due to the poverty of historicism as an epistemology. Marx&#x27;s sociological and economic analyses of contemporary society were one-sided but descriptive, and his system of unrestrained capitalism was not going to last much longer. Marx&#x27;s hope for a decrease in state influence is commendable. &quot;One of the historical tendencies that Marx claimed to have discovered&quot;, which &quot;seems to be of a more persistent character than others&quot;, is the &quot;tendency towards the accumulation of the means of production, and especially towards increasing the productivity of labour&quot;. Marx emphasized the connection between the development of productive forces and the credit system, which led to the trade cycle, and his theory of the trade cycle says that an approach towards full employment &quot;stimulates inventors and investors to create and to introduce new labour-saving machinery, thereby giving rise (first to a short boom and then) to a new wave of unemployment and depression.&quot; When productivity increases, investments increase, consumption increases, labor time decreases, and the quantity of goods produced but not consumed increases. &quot;Marx saw many things in the right light&quot;, but &quot;he had no inkling of what was lying ahead&quot;, and his predictions were wrong.

==== Marx&#x27;s Ethics ====

Chapter 22, &quot;The Moral Theory of Historicism&quot;, discusses the ethical theory implied in Marx&#x27;s &quot;Capital&quot;. Marx condemned capitalism due to its inherent injustice and oligarchical nature, emphasizing the moral aspect of social institutions. Popper questions the historicist moral theory that all social changes and political revolutions are due to the economics of the epoch concerned, and argues that man and his aims are a product of society to some extent, but society is also a product of man and his aims. Popper concludes that our views and actions are not solely determined by heredity, education, and social influences, and gives the example of Beethoven to explain the sociological aspects of his work.

==== The Aftermath ====
Chapter 23, &quot;The Sociology of Knowledge&quot;, discusses the historicist philosophies of Hegel and Marx, which attempt to predict and control change in a changing social environment. Popper argues that this attitude is closely related to &quot;the Marxist doctrine that our opinions, including our moral and scientific opinions, are determined by class interest, and more generally by the social and historical situation of our time&quot;. Popper introduces the sociology of knowledge and argues that scientific objectivity is achieved through &quot;the friendly-hostile co-operation of many scientists&quot; and the public expression of criticism and opinion. He also criticizes the sociology of knowledge&#x27;s failure to understand the social aspects of scientific method and suggests that the social sciences need a social technology that can be tested by piecemeal social engineering. Popper believes that social scientists should forget about intertwining &#x27;knowledge&#x27; and &#x27;will&#x27; and focus on the practical problems of our time using the same theoretical methods as other sciences.

Chapter 24, &quot;Oracular Philosophy and the Revolt against Reason&quot;, explores &quot;the conflict between rationalism and irrationalism&quot;, which is &quot;has become the most important intellectual, and perhaps even moral, issue of our time&quot;. In the sense in which he speaks of it in this chapter, rationalism is &quot;an attitude that seeks to solve as many problems as possible by an appeal to reason, i.e. to clear thought and experience, rather than by an appeal to emotions and passions&quot; – it is not opposed to &quot;empiricism&quot;, but rather to irrationalism, the attitude which instead &quot;insists that emotions and passions rather than reason are the mainsprings of human action&quot;. Popper argues for individualism and the need for rational thinking in society, while critiquing the irrationalist position that he believes is fashionable today.

Popper proposes critical rationalism, &quot;which recognizes the fact that the fundamental rationalist attitude results from an (at least tentative) act of faith—from faith in reason.&quot; This is opposed to uncritical or comprehensive rationalism, which &quot;can be described as the attitude of the person who says &#x27;I am not prepared to accept anything that cannot be defended by means of argument or experience&#x27;&quot;, including rationalism itself – which Popper believes is self-defeating. The choice between adopting a more or less radical form of irrationalism or critical rationalism is not just an intellectual decision but a moral one, which &quot;will deeply affect our whole attitude towards other men, and towards the problems of social life&quot;.

Popper argues that irrationalism leads to an attitude &quot;that is hopelessly unrealistic. For it does not consider the weakness of &#x27;human nature&#x27;, the feeble intellectual endowment of most and their obvious dependence upon emotions and passions&quot;, and also leads to &quot;the adoption of an anti-equalitarian attitude in political life, i.e. in the field of problems concerned with the power of man over man&quot;, which Popper considers &quot;criminal&quot;. Popper urges that critical rationalism, which emphasizes argument and experience and suggests impartiality, is a better approach than irrationalism. Popper also criticizes influential irrationalist philosophers of the 20th century, including A.N. Whitehead and Ludwig Wittgenstein.

==== Conclusion ====
Chapter 25, &quot;Has History Any Meaning?&quot;, discusses the role of theories in natural science, the limitations of historical theories, the worship of power, and the idea of theistic historicism. Popper highlights the difficulty of imposing higher values in education, and argues that history has no meaning and no ends, but we can give it meaning by imposing our ends upon it. Finally, he discusses the problem of nature and convention again, stating that ethical problems arise only in social situations.

==== Addenda ====
A lengthy 1961 addendum to the second volume, titled &quot;Facts, Standards, and Truth: a Further Criticism of Relativism&quot;, critiques relativism, which is the idea that there is no objective truth, and the choice between competing theories is arbitrary. Popper suggests that there is an objective way to determine if a statement corresponds to the facts and also to establish a standard in the moral and political fields, thereby countering relativism. Popper argues for fallibilism, acknowledging that human knowledge is subject to error and that the quest for certainty is a mistaken one. Popper also explains the idea of getting closer to the truth, which is fundamental to the growth of knowledge, and he refutes the notion that this idea is illegitimate. Popper highlights the consequences of the decline of authoritarian religion leading to widespread relativism and nihilism. Additionally, Popper explains the dualism of facts and standards, where standards can never be derived from facts and must be created, criticized, and improved, leading to a never-ending process of the growth of knowledge.

A 1965 addendum, titled &quot;Note on Schwarzschild&#x27;s Book on Marx&quot;, notes that Popper would not have given Marx such a sympathetic treatment if he had previously had access to the evidence given about Marx&#x27;s character in the book &quot;The Red Prussian&quot;, by Leopold Schwarzschild. Popper believes that this evidence, &quot;especially from the Marx–Engels correspondence&quot;, &quot;shows that Marx was less of a humanitarian, and less of a lover of freedom, than he is made to appear&quot; in &quot;The Open Society and its Enemies&quot;.

=== Endnotes ===
&quot;The Open Society and its Enemies&quot; has extensive endnotes, which, together, are about as lengthy as the book&#x27;s first volume. They are mostly bibliographical in nature, giving quotations from Plato and Marx that support the assertions made in the main body.

One endnote that became very popular was note 4 to chapter 7, since it defines the paradox of tolerance, the idea that &quot;unlimited tolerance must lead to the disappearance of tolerance. If we extend unlimited tolerance even to those who are intolerant, if we are not prepared to defend a tolerant society against the onslaught of the intolerant, then the tolerant will be destroyed, and tolerance with them.&quot; This idea is not brought up at all in the main text of the book, which is much more concerned with the related paradox of freedom, &quot;the argument that freedom in the sense of absence of any restraining control must lead to very great restraint, since it makes the bully free to enslave the meek&quot;. According to Popper, the paradox of freedom was &quot;used first, and with success, by Plato&quot;, but was &quot;never grasped&quot; by Marx, who held the &quot;naïve view that, in a classless society, state power would lose its function and &#x27;wither away&#x27;&quot;. Popper begins note 4 to chapter 7 by defining the &quot;paradox of freedom&quot; and then, as an aside, further defines the &quot;paradox of tolerance&quot; and another paradox, called the paradox of democracy, &quot;or more precisely, of majority-rule; i.e. the possibility that the majority may decide that a tyrant should rule.&quot;

== Publication history ==
As Popper wrote in academic obscurity in New Zealand during World War II, several colleagues in philosophy and the social sciences assisted with the book&#x27;s path to publication. His friend E.H. Gombrich was entrusted with the task of finding a publisher; Lionel Robbins and Harold Laski reviewed the manuscript; J.N. Findlay suggested the book&#x27;s title after three others had been discarded. (&#x27;A Social Philosophy for Everyman&#x27; was the original title of the manuscript; &#x27;Three False Prophets: Plato-Hegel-Marx&#x27; and &#x27;A Critique of Political Philosophy&#x27; were also considered and rejected.) Friedrich Hayek wanted to recruit Popper to the London School of Economics and was enthused by his turn to social philosophy.

=== History until publication, as told by Gombrich ===
Gombrich wrote down his &quot;Personal Recollections&quot; on book&#x27;s publication, and these were published with the book in the 2013 Princeton one-volume edition. Gombrich explained that the manuscript was sent from New Zealand to England in the middle of World War II and took two-and-a-half years to publish. Gombrich kept a collection of letters, which he now shares, revealing that Popper saw his book as an &quot;urgent&quot; new philosophy of politics and history, trying to contribute to an understanding of the totalitarian revolt against civilization. Popper believed that the persistent hostility to the open society is due to the strain of civilization, as well as the sense of drift, which is associated with the transition from the closed tribal societies of the past to the individualistic civilization that originated in Athens in the fifth century BC. Gombrich received the manuscript and helped Popper send it to various publishers in England.

On August 19, 1943, Gombrich received a long letter from Karl Popper, which included a reply to the former&#x27;s critical remarks on Popper&#x27;s book &quot;The Open Society and Its Enemies&quot;. Popper discussed the honesty of Schopenhauer and Hegel and argued that he is not biased by the fact that the democratic creed of the West is based on Christianity. Additionally, Popper shared his excitement about being offered a readership at the London School of Economics (LSE), thanks to the help of his friend, Hayek. Gombrich received instructions from Popper on how to apply for the position, along with Popper&#x27;s CV and references. Popper also defended the length and complexity of his book, claiming that it achieves a rare degree of lucidity and simplicity despite being &quot;thronged with thoughts on every single page&quot;.

In October 1944, Popper reported finishing two important articles on &quot;Private and Public Values&quot; and &quot;The Refutation of Determinism,&quot; and intended to return to practical methodology and music after completing another article titled &quot;The Logic of Freedom.&quot; Popper was still awaiting a publication date from Routledge and considering offers from universities in New Zealand and Australia. Gombrich also revealed that Popper&#x27;s head of department at Canterbury had made derogatory comments about him, and Popper was eager to leave. Popper was ill during April, but his health improved while vacationing in the mountains. On May 21, while on a bus in New Zealand, he received a cable from Cambridge congratulating him on his London appointment and thanking him for an excellent article.

Despite the difficulties and worries that Karl Popper and his wife faced in traveling from New Zealand to England during World War II, including the prospect of meeting new people and the fear that their permits to enter Great Britain would be denied, they finally arrived in England and were greeted by Gombrich and his family. Gombrich gave Popper the first copy of his book &quot;The Open Society and Its Enemies,&quot; which Popper eagerly scrutinized on the way to Gombrich&#x27;s house. Gombrich&#x27;s &quot;Recollections&quot; end on a reflective note, musing on the immense contributions that Popper made to intellectual discourse in the decades that followed.

=== History after publication ===
The book was not published in Russia until 1992. In 2019, the book was released in audiobook format for the first time, narrated by Liam Gerrard. The audiobook was produced by arrangement with the University of Klagenfurt/Karl Popper Library, by Tantor Media, a division of Recorded Books.

== Reception and influence ==
Popper&#x27;s book remains one of the most popular defenses of Western liberal values in the post-World War II era. Gilbert Ryle, reviewing Popper&#x27;s book just two years after its publication and agreeing with him, wrote that Plato &quot;was Socrates&#x27; Judas.&quot; &quot;The Open Society and Its Enemies&quot; was praised by the philosophers Bertrand Russell, who called it &quot;a work of first-class importance&quot; and &quot;a vigorous and profound defence of democracy&quot;, and Sidney Hook who called it a &quot;subtly argued and passionately written&quot; critique of the &quot;historicist ideas that threaten the love of freedom [and] the existence of an open society&quot;. Hook calls Popper&#x27;s critique of the cardinal beliefs of historicism &quot;undoubtedly sound&quot;, noting that historicism &quot;overlooks the presence of genuine alternatives in history, the operation of plural causal processes in the historical pattern, and the role of human ideals in redetermining the future&quot;. Nevertheless, Hook argues that Popper &quot;reads Plato too literally when it serves his purposes and is too cocksure about what Plato&#x27;s &#x27;real&#x27; meaning is when the texts are ambiguous&quot;, and calls Popper&#x27;s treatment of Hegel &quot;downright abusive&quot; and &quot;demonstrably false&quot;, noting that &quot;there is not a single reference to Hegel in Adolf Hitler&#x27;s &quot;Mein Kampf&quot;&quot;, though neither does Popper refer to Hitler.

Some other philosophers were critical. Walter Kaufmann believed that Popper&#x27;s work has many virtues, including its attack against totalitarianism, and many suggestive ideas. However, he also found it to have serious flaws, writing that Popper&#x27;s interpretations of Plato were flawed and that Popper had provided a &quot;comprehensive statement&quot; of older myths about Hegel. Kaufmann commented that despite Popper&#x27;s hatred of totalitarianism, Popper&#x27;s method was &quot;unfortunately similar to that of totalitarian &#x27;scholars&#x27;&quot;.

In his &quot;The Open Philosophy and the Open Society: A Reply to Dr. Karl Popper&#x27;s Refutations of Marxism&quot; (1968), the Marxist author Maurice Cornforth defended Marxism against Popper&#x27;s criticisms. Though disagreeing with Popper, Cornforth nevertheless called him &quot;perhaps the most eminent&quot; critic of Marxism. The philosopher Robert C. Solomon writes that Popper directs an &quot;almost wholly unjustified polemic&quot; against Hegel, one which has helped to give Hegel a reputation as a &quot;moral and political reactionary&quot;. The Marxist economist Ernest Mandel identifies &quot;The Open Society and Its Enemies&quot; as part of a literature, beginning with German social democrat Eduard Bernstein, that criticizes the dialectical method Marx borrowed from Hegel as &quot;useless&quot;, &quot;metaphysical&quot;, or &quot;mystifying.&quot; He faults Popper and the other critics for their &quot;positivist narrowness&quot;.

The political theorist Rajeev Bhargava argues that Popper &quot;notoriously misreads Hegel and Marx&quot;, and that the formulation Popper deployed to defend liberal political values is &quot;motivated by partisan ideological considerations grounded curiously in the most abstract metaphysical premises&quot;. In Jon Stewart&#x27;s anthology &quot;The Hegel Myths and Legends&quot; (1996), &quot;The Open Society and Its Enemies&quot; is listed as a work that has propagated &quot;myths&quot; about Hegel. Stephen Houlgate writes that while Popper&#x27;s accusation that Hegel sought to deceive others by use of dialectic is famous, it is also ignorant, as is Popper&#x27;s charge that Hegel&#x27;s account of sound and heat in the &quot;Encyclopedia of the Philosophical Sciences&quot; is &quot;gibberish&quot; although he does not elaborate further what specifically Hegel meant.

The Open Society Foundations, created by investor George Soros, were inspired in name and purpose by Popper&#x27;s book.

The philosopher Joseph Agassi credits Popper with showing that historicism is a factor common to both fascism and Bolshevism.

<text>The Wetumpka impact crater is the only confirmed impact crater in Alabama, United States. It is located east of downtown Wetumpka in Elmore County. The crater is in diameter, and its age is estimated to be about 85 million years (late Cretaceous), based on fossils found in the youngest disturbed deposits, which belong to the Mooreville Chalk Formation.

The crater is well preserved, including the original impact rim and breccia, but exposures are few owing to plant and soil cover, and nearly all are on private land. The meteorite that caused the crater was estimated to be 1,100 feet in diameter and was likely to have impacted at a 30-45 degree angle from the northeast, on a shallow sea that was about 300–400 feet deep.

Thornton L. Neathery discovered the Wetumpka Crater in 1969–70 during regional geological mapping and published the first article on the subject in 1976. However, conclusive evidence of impact origin was lacking until 1998 when David T. King, Jr. and colleagues discovered shocked quartz in a core drilled near the center of the structure. In 2002, Auburn University researchers published evidence and established the site as an internationally recognized impact crater.

<doc id="780612" wikidata="Q933555" url="?curid=780612" title="Child discipline">
<text>Child discipline is the methods used to prevent future unwanted behaviour in children. The word &quot;discipline&quot; is defined as imparting knowledge and skill, in other words, to teach. In its most general sense, discipline refers to systematic instruction given to a disciple. &quot;To discipline&quot; means to instruct a person to follow a particular code of conduct.

Discipline is used by parents to teach their children about expectations, guidelines and principles. Child discipline can involve rewards and punishments to teach self-control, increase desirable behaviors and decrease undesirable behaviors. While the purpose of child discipline is to develop and entrench desirable social habits in children, the ultimate goal is to foster particular judgement and morals so the child develops and maintains self-discipline throughout the rest of their life.

Because the values, beliefs, education, customs and cultures of people vary so widely, along with the age and temperament of the child, methods of child discipline also vary widely. Child discipline is a topic that draws from a wide range of interested fields, such as parenting, the professional practice of behavior analysis, developmental psychology, social work, and various religious perspectives. In recent years, advances in the understanding of attachment parenting have provided a new background of theoretical understanding and advanced clinical and practical understanding of the effectiveness and outcome of parenting methods.

There has been debate in recent years over the use of corporal punishment for children in general, and increased attention to the concept of &quot;positive parenting&quot; where desirable behavior is encouraged and rewarded. The goal of positive discipline is to teach, train and guide children so that they learn, practice self-control and develop the ability to manage their emotions, and make desired choices regarding their personal behavior.

Cultural differences exist among many forms of child discipline. Shaming is a form of discipline and behavior modification. Children raised in different cultures experience discipline and shame in various ways. This generally depends on whether the society values individualism or collectivism.

== History ==
Historical research suggests that there has been a great deal of individual variation in methods of discipline over time.

===Medieval times===
Nicholas Orme of the University of Exeter argues that children in medieval times were treated differently from adults in legal matters, and the authorities were as troubled about violence to children as they were to adults. In his article, &quot;Childhood in Medieval England&quot;, he states, &quot;Corporal punishment was in use throughout society and probably also in homes, although social commentators criticized parents for indulgence towards children rather than for harsh discipline.&quot; Salvation was the main goal of discipline, and parents were driven to ensure their children a place in heaven. In one incident in early 14th-century London, neighbors intervened when a cook and clerk were beating a boy carrying water. A scuffle ensued and the child&#x27;s tormentors were subdued. The neighbors did not even know the boy, but they firmly stood up for him even when they were physically attacked, and they stood by their actions when the cook and clerk later sued for damages.

===Colonial times===
During colonial times in the United States, parents were able to provide enjoyments for their children in the form of toys, according to David Robinson, writer for the &quot;Colonial Williamsburg Journal&quot;. Robinson notes that even the Puritans permitted their young children to play freely. Older children were expected to swiftly adopt adult chores and accountabilities, to meet the strict necessities of daily life. Harsh punishments for minor infractions were common. Beatings and other forms of corporal punishment occurred regularly; one legislator even suggested capital punishment for children&#x27;s misbehavior.

=== Pre-Civil War and Post-Civil War times ===
According to Stacey Patton, corporal punishment in African American families has its roots in punishment meted out by parents and family members during the era of slavery in the United States. Europeans would use physical discipline on their children, whereas she states that it was uncommon in West African and Indigenous North American societies and only became more prevalent as their lives grew more difficult due to slavery and genocide. As such, Patton argues that traditional parenting styles were not preserved due to the &quot;violent suppression of West African cultural practices&quot;. Parents were expected and pressured to teach their children to behave in a certain way in front of white people, as well as to expect the physical, sexual, and emotional violence and dehumanizing actions that typically came with slavery. While the Emancipation Proclamation ended the institution of slavery, in the south many expected former slaves to conform to the prior expectations of deference and demeanor. Patton states that black parents continued to use corporal punishment with their children out of fear that doing otherwise would put them and their family at risk of violence and discrimination, a form of parenting that she argues is still common today.

=== Biblical views ===
The Book of Proverbs mentions the importance of disciplining children, as opposed to leaving them neglected or unruly, in several verses. Interpretation of these verses varies, as do many passages from the Bible, from literal to metaphorical. The most often paraphrased is from Proverbs 13:24, &quot;He that spareth his rod hateth his son: but he that loveth him chasteneth him betimes.&quot; (King James Version.) Other passages that mention the &#x27;rod&#x27; are Proverbs 23:14, &quot;Thou shalt beat him with the rod, and shalt deliver his soul from hell,&quot; and Proverbs 29:15, &quot;The rod and reproof give wisdom: but a child left to himself bringeth his mother to shame.&quot;

Although the Bible&#x27;s lessons have been paraphrased for hundreds of years, the modern phrase, &quot;Spare the rod and spoil the child,&quot; was coined by Samuel Butler, in &quot;Hudibras&quot;, a mock heroic narrative poem published in 1663. The Contemporary English Version of Proverbs 13:24 is: &#x27;If you love your children you will correct them; if you don&#x27;t love them, you won&#x27;t correct them&#x27;.

=== Medieval views ===

The primary guidelines followed by medieval parents in training their children were from the Bible. Scolding was considered ineffectual, and cursing a child was a terrible thing. In general, the use of corporal punishment was as a disciplinary action taken to shape behavior, not a pervasive dispensing of beatings for no reason. Corporal punishment was undoubtedly the norm. The medieval world was a dangerous place, and it could take harsh measures to prepare a child to live in it. Pain was the medieval way of illustrating that actions had consequences.

=== Influence of John Locke ===
In his 1690 &quot;Essay Concerning Human Understanding&quot; English physician and philosopher John Locke argued that the child resembled a blank tablet (tabula rasa) at birth, and was not inherently full of sin. In his 1693 &quot;Some Thoughts Concerning Education&quot; he suggested that the task of the parent was to build in the child the strong body and habits of mind that would allow the capacity of reason to develop, and that parents could reward good behavior with their esteem and punish bad behavior with disgrace – the withdrawal of parental approval and affection - as opposed to beatings.

=== The twentieth century ===
In the early twentieth century, child-rearing experts abandoned a romantic view of childhood and advocated formation of proper habits to discipline children. A 1914 U.S. Children&#x27;s Bureau pamphlet, &quot;Infant Care&quot;, urged a strict schedule and admonished parents not to play with their babies. John B. Watson&#x27;s 1924 &quot;Behaviorism&quot; argued that parents could train malleable children by rewarding good behavior and punishing bad, and by following precise schedules for food, sleep, and other bodily functions.

Although such principles began to be rejected as early as the 1930s, they were firmly renounced in the 1946 best-seller &quot;Baby and Child Care&quot;, by pediatrician Benjamin Spock, which told parents to trust their own instincts and to view the child as a reasonable, friendly human being. Dr. Spock revised his first edition to urge more parent-centered discipline in 1957, but critics blamed his popular book for its permissive attitude during the youth rebellions of the 1960s and 1970s.

In the last half of the century, Parent Management Training was developed and found to be effective in reducing child disruptive behavior in randomized controlled trials.

=== Conservative backlash ===

Following the permissive trend of the 1960s and early 1970s, American evangelical Christian James Dobson sought the return of a more conservative society and advocated spanking of children up to age eight. Dobson&#x27;s position is controversial. As early as 1985, &quot;The New York Times&quot; stated that &quot;most child-care experts today disapprove of physical punishment.&quot;

== Corporal punishment ==


In many cultures, parents have historically had the right to spank their children. A 2006 retrospective study in New Zealand, showed that physical punishment of children remained quite common in the 1970s and 1980s, with 80% of the sample reporting some kind of corporal punishment from parents, at some time during childhood. Among this sample, 29% reported being hit with an empty hand. However 45% were hit with an object, and 6% were subjected to serious physical abuse. The study noted that abusive physical punishment tended to be given by fathers and often involved striking the child&#x27;s head or torso instead of the buttocks or limbs.

Attitudes have changed in recent years, and legislation in some countries, particularly in continental Europe, reflect an increased skepticism toward corporal punishment. As of December 2017, domestic corporal punishment has been outlawed in 56 countries around the world, most of them in Europe and Latin America, beginning with Sweden in 1966. Official figures show that just 10 percent of Swedish children had been spanked or otherwise struck by their parents by 2010, compared to more than 90 percent in the 1960s. The Swedish law does not actually lay down any legal punishment for smacking but requires social workers to support families with problems.

A 2013 study by Murray A. Straus at the University of New Hampshire found that children across numerous cultures who were spanked committed more crimes as adults than children who were not spanked, regardless of the quality of their relationship to their parents.

Even as corporal punishment became increasingly controversial in North America, Britain, Australia and much of the rest of the English-speaking world, limited corporal punishment of children by their parents remained lawful in all 50 states of the United States. It was not until 2012 that Delaware became the first state to pass a statute defining &quot;physical injury&quot; to a child to include &quot;any impairment of physical condition or pain.&quot;

== Cultural differences ==
A number of authors have emphasized the importance of cultural differences in assessing disciplinary methods. Clinical psychologist Diana Baumrind argues that &quot;The cultural context critically determines the meaning and therefore the consequences of physical discipline...&quot;.

Child discipline is often affected by cultural differences. Many Eastern countries typically emphasize beliefs of collectivism in which social conformity and the interests of the group are valued above the individual. Families that promote collectivism will frequently employ tactics of shaming in the form of social comparisons and guilt induction in order to modify behavior. A child may have their behavior compared to that of a peer by an authority figure in order to guide their moral development and social awareness. Many Western countries place an emphasis on individualism. These societies often value independent growth and self esteem. Disciplining a child by contrasting them to better-behaved children is contrary to the individualistic societies value of nurturing children&#x27;s self-esteem. These children of individualistic societies are more likely to feel a sense of guilt when shame is used as a form of behavior correction. For the collectivist societies, shaming corresponds with the value of promoting self improvement without negatively affecting self esteem.

==Parenting styles==
There are different parenting styles which parents use to discipline their children. Four types have been identified: authoritative parents, authoritarian parents, indulgent parents, and indifferent parents.

Authoritative parents are parents who use warmth, firm control, and rational, issue-oriented discipline, in which emphasis is placed on the development of self-direction. They place a high value on the development of autonomy and self-direction, but assume the ultimate responsibility for their child&#x27;s behavior.

Authoritarian parents are parents who use punitive, absolute, and forceful discipline, and who place a premium on obedience and conformity. These parents believe it is their responsibility to provide for their children and that their children have little to no right to tell the parent how best to do this. Adults are expected to know from experience what is really in the child&#x27;s best interest and so adult views are allowed to take precedence over child desires. Children are perceived to know what they want but not necessarily what is best for them.

Indulgent parents are parents who are characterized by responsiveness but low demandingness, and who are mainly concerned with the child&#x27;s happiness. They behave in an accepting, benign, and somewhat more passive way in matters of discipline.

Indifferent parents are parents who are characterized by low levels of both responsiveness and demandingness. They try to do whatever is necessary to minimize the time and energy they must devote to interacting with their child. In extreme cases, indifferent parents may be neglectful. They ask very little of their children. For instance, they rarely assign their children chores. They tend to be relatively uninvolved in their children&#x27;s lives. They believe their children should live their own lives, as free of parental control as possible.

Connected parents are parents who want to improve the way in which they connect with their children using an empathetic approach to challenging or even tumultuous relationships. Using the &#x27;CALM&#x27; technique, by Jennifer Kolari, parents recognize the importance of empathy and aspire to build capacity in their children in hopes of them becoming confident and emotionally resilient. The CALM acronym stands for: Connect emotionally, match the Affect of the child, Listen to what your child is saying and Mirror their emotion back to show understanding.

==Non-physical discipline==
Non-physical discipline consists of both punitive and non-punitive methods but does not include any forms of corporal punishment such as hitting or spanking. Thus, no single method is considered to be for exclusive use. Non-Physical discipline is used in the concerted cultivation style of parenting that comes from the middle and upper class. Concerted cultivation is the method of parenting that includes heavy parental involvement, and use reasoning and bargaining as disciplinary methods.

=== Time-outs ===

A common method of child discipline is sending the child away from the family or group after misbehavior. Children may be told to stand in the corner (&quot;corner time&quot;) or may be sent to their rooms for a period of time (room time).
A time-out involves isolating or separating a child for a few minutes and is intended to give an over-excited child time to calm down.

Alternatively, time-outs have been recommended as a time for parents to separate feelings of anger toward the child for their behavior and to develop a plan for discipline.

If an individual decides to use the time-out with a child as a discipline strategy, the individual must be unemotional and consistent with the undesired behavior. Along with taking into consideration the child&#x27;s temperament, professionals have recommended that the length of the time-out also should depend on the age of the child. For example, the time-out should last one minute per year of the child&#x27;s age, so if the child is five years old, the time-out should go no longer than five minutes. However, research results have suggested that this does not improve its effectiveness.

Time-outs have been recommended by researchers and professional organizations on the basis of a large body of research. However, several anti-discipline experts do not recommend the use of any form of punishment, including time-outs. These authors include Thomas Gordon, Alfie Kohn, and Aletha Solter.

=== Grounding ===

Another common method of discipline used for, usually, preteens and teenagers, is restricting the child&#x27;s freedom of movement, optionally compounded by restricting activities. Examples of restriction of movement would be confinement to the yard, to the house, or to just the bedroom and restroom, excepting for required activities, such as attending school or religious services, going to work, obtaining healthcare, performing chores, etc. Examples of restriction of activities would be disallowing visits by friends, forbidding use of a telephone and other means of communications, prohibiting games and electronic entertainment, taking away books and toys, and forbidding watching television and listening to music.

=== Hotsaucing ===
&quot;Hotsaucing&quot;, or &quot;Hot saucing&quot;, is the practice of putting hot sauce in the child&#x27;s mouth, which can be considered a form of child abuse. Some pediatricians, psychologists and experts on childcare strongly recommend against this practice.

Former child star Lisa Whelchel advocates hot saucing in her parenting book &quot;Creative Correction&quot;. In the book, Whelchel claims the practice is more effective and humane than traditional corporal punishments, such as spanking; she repeated this opinion when promoting her book on &quot;Good Morning America&quot;, where she said in raising her own child she found the technique successful where other measures had failed. Whelchel&#x27;s book recommends using only &quot;tiny&quot; amounts of hot sauce, and lists alternatives such as lemon juice or vinegar.

The practice had also been suggested in a 2001 article in &quot;Today&#x27;s Christian Woman&quot; magazine, where only &quot;a drop&quot; is suggested, and alternative substances are listed.

While these publications are credited with popularizing hot saucing, the practice is believed by some to come from Southern United States culture. It is well known among pediatricians, psychologists and child welfare professionals. If a child is allergic to any of the ingredients in a hot sauce, it can cause swelling of the child&#x27;s tongue and esophagus, presenting a choking hazard.

=== Scolding ===
Scolding involves reproving or criticizing a child&#x27;s negative behavior and/or actions.

Some research suggests that scolding is counter-productive because parental attention (including negative attention) tends to reinforce behavior.

== Non-punitive discipline ==
While punishments may be of limited value in consistently influencing rule-related behavior, non-punitive discipline techniques have been found to have greater impact on children who have begun to master their native language. Non-punitive discipline (also known as empathic discipline and positive discipline) is an approach to child-rearing that does not use any form of punishment. It is about loving guidance, and requires parents to have a strong relationship with their child so that the child responds to gentle guidance as opposed to threats and punishment. According to Dr. Laura Markham, the most effective discipline strategy is to make sure your child wants to please you.

Non-punitive discipline also excludes systems of &quot;manipulative&quot; rewards. Instead, a child&#x27;s behavior is shaped by &quot;democratic interaction&quot; and by deepening parent-child communication. The reasoning behind it is that while punitive measures may stop the problem behavior in the short term, by themselves they do not provide a learning opportunity that allows children the autonomy to change their own behavior. Punishments such as time-outs may be seen as banishment and humiliation. Consequences as a form of punishment are not recommended, but natural consequences are considered to be possibly worthwhile learning experiences provided there is no risk of lasting harm.

Positive discipline is both non-violent discipline and non-punitive discipline. Criticizing, discouraging, creating obstacles and barriers, blaming, shaming, using sarcastic or cruel humor, or using physical punishment are some negative disciplinary methods used with young children. Any parent may occasionally do any of these things, but doing them more than once in a while may lead to low self-esteem becoming a permanent part of the child&#x27;s personality.

Authors in this field include Aletha Solter, Alfie Kohn, Pam Leo, Haim Ginott, Thomas Gordon, Lawrence J. Cohen, and John Gottman.

=== Essential aspects ===
In the past, harsh discipline was the norm for families in society. However, research by psychologists has brought about new forms of effective discipline. Positive discipline is based on minimizing the child&#x27;s frustrations and misbehavior rather than giving punishments. The main focus in this method is the &quot;Golden Rule&quot;, treat others the way you want to be treated. Parents follow this when disciplining their children because they believe that their point will reach the children more effectively rather than traditional discipline. The foundation of this style of discipline is encouraging children to feel good about themselves and building the parent&#x27;s relationship with the child so the child wants to please the parent. In traditional discipline, parents would instill fear in their child by using shame and humiliation to get their point across. In positive discipline the parents avoid negative treatment and focus on the importance of communication and showing unconditional love. Feeling loved, important and well liked has positive and negative effects on how a child perceives themselves. The child will feel important if the child feels well liked and loved by a person. Other important aspects are reasonable and age-appropriate expectations, feeding healthy foods and providing enough rest, giving clear instructions which may need to be repeated, looking for the causes of any misbehavior and making adjustments, and building routines. Children are helped by knowing what is happening in their lives. Having some predictability about their day without necessarily being regimental may help reduce frustration and misbehavior.

=== Methods ===

==== Praise and rewards ====

B. F. Skinner argued that simply giving the child spontaneous expressions of appreciation or acknowledgement when they are not misbehaving will act as a reinforcer for good behavior. Focusing on good behavior versus bad behavior will encourage appropriate behavior in the given situation. According to Skinner, past behavior that is reinforced with praise is likely to repeat in the same or similar situation.

In operant conditioning, schedules of reinforcement are an important component of the learning process. When and how often we reinforce a behavior can have a dramatic impact on the strength and rate of the response.
A schedule of reinforcement is basically a rule stating which instances of a behavior will be reinforced. In some case, a behavior might be reinforced every time it occurs. Sometimes, a behavior might not be reinforced at all. Either positive reinforcement or negative reinforcement might be used, depending on the situation. In both cases, the goal of reinforcement is always to strengthen the behavior and increase the likelihood that it will occur again in the future.
In real-world settings, behaviors are probably not going to be reinforced each and every time they occur. For situations where you are purposely trying to train and reinforce an action, such as in the classroom, in sports or in animal training, you might opt to follow a specific reinforcement schedule. As you&#x27;ll see below, some schedules are best suited to certain types of training situations. In some cases, training might call for starting out with one schedule and switching to another once the desired behavior has been taught.

; Example of operant conditioning

Positive reinforcement: Whenever they are being cooperative, solves things non-aggressively, immediately reward those behaviors with praise, attention, goodies.

Punishment: If acting aggressively, give immediate, undesired consequence (send to corner; say &quot;NO!&quot; and couple with response cost).

Response cost: Most common would be &quot;time-out&quot;. Removing sources of attention by placing in an environment without other people.

Negative reinforcement: One example would be to couple negative reinforcement with response cost—after some period of time in which he has acted cooperatively or calmly while in the absence of others, can bring him back with others. Thus, taking away the isolation should reinforce the desired behavior (being cooperative).

Extinction: Simply ignoring behaviors should lead to extinction. Note: that initially when ignored, can expect an initial increase in the behavior—a very trying time in situations such as a child that is acting out.

It is common for children who are otherwise ignored by their parents to turn to disruptive behaviour as a way of seeking attention. An example is a child screaming for attention. Parents often inadvertently reward the bad behavior by immediately giving them the attention, thereby reinforcing it. On the other hand, parents may wait until the child calms down and speaks politely, then reward the more polite behavior with the attention.

==== Natural consequences ====

Natural consequences involve children learning from their own mistakes. In this method, the parent&#x27;s job is to teach the child which behaviors are inappropriate. In order to do this, parents should allow the child to make a mistake and let them experience the natural results from their behavior. For instance, if a child forgets to bring his lunch to school, he will find himself hungry later. Using natural consequences would be indicative of the theory of accomplishment of natural growth, which is the parenting style of the working class and poor. The accomplishment of natural growth focuses on separation between children and family. Children are given directives and expected to carry them out without complaint or delay. Children are responsible for themselves during their free time, and the parent&#x27;s main concern is caring for the children&#x27;s physical needs.

== Research ==

=== Non-violent discipline options ===
A systematic overview of evidence on non-violent discipline options conducted by Karen Quail and Catherine Ward was published in 2020.This meta study reviewed 223 systematic reviews covering data from 3,921 primary studies, and available research evidence was summarized for over 50 discipline tools.

Non-violent parenting tools were defined as any skills &quot;which can be used to address a child&#x27;s resistance, lack of cooperation, problem behavior or dysregulation, or to teach and support appropriate behavior&quot;. This is distinguished from a coercive approach, &quot;in which the adult tries to force a certain reaction from the child using threats, intimidation and punishment.&quot; Coercive approaches have been found to increase child aggression and conduct problems.

Quail and Ward observed that information on discipline skills on the internet and in parenting books is limited and often inaccurate and misleading. &quot;There is advice against time-outs or praise and rewards, when in fact these are evidence-supported skills which, used appropriately, have positive effects on behavior.&quot;. They highlight the need for an evidence-based toolkit of individual skills from which parents and teachers can choose techniques that best suit the situation and fit with their cultural norms. The meta-study found a wide range of evidence-supported nonviolent discipline tools, many of which have been found effective with severe problem behavior. Quail organized these into a Peace Discipline model supported by a toolkit of techniques.

A few of the specific tools showing positive effects include the following.

* Good, warm, open communication between parent and child, especially the kind that encourages child disclosure. This could imply the use of skills such as active listening and open-ended questions, and the absence of judgment, criticism or other reactions on the part of the parent that would shut child disclosure down.
* Time-in. Time with parents during which there is physical touch and ample expressions of care, compassion and praise.
* Parental monitoring. It has been shown that aside from supervision or surveillance, child disclosure is an important part of monitoring. This underlines the importance of a good parent-child relationship, with warm, open communication and good listening skills.
* Setting expectations (rules).
* Distracting a child with an acceptable toy, object, or activity.
* Modelling the behavior parents wish to see. 
* Prompting or reminding a child to do something.
* Feedback on behavior.
* Praise.
* Rewards.
* Goal-setting with the child.
* Promoting self-management.
* Promoting problem-solving skills. This can be done by collaborating with children to find solutions for discipline problems e.g. having a meeting with children to discuss the problem of them getting to school late every morning, brainstorming possible solutions with them, and together choosing the solution that would work best
* Giving appropriate choices.
* Time-out. There are two kinds, exclusionary (e.g. the child must stay in their room for a few minutes if they lash out and hurt someone) and non-exclusionary (e.g. a time-out from a toy or cell phone if they are fighting over the toy or abusing phone privileges). Time-outs are most often used for aggression or non-compliance. Exclusionary timeouts may be necessary in the case of aggression, but in other situations either kind has been shown to work. The wide variation in timeouts that work suggests that parents can tailor timeouts according to what feels right for them and what best suits their child&#x27;s needs. Some examples are: time-out in a room, timeout from a toy, screen time, attention, or from playing in a game they are disrupting. Timeouts in the studies reviewed were implemented calmly, not in a harsh or rejecting manner, and work better in a context where interaction between parent and child is usually of good quality (see time-in).
* Emotion Coaching or teaching children emotional communication skills. This involves the parents developing an emotional vocabulary for themselves and their children, and learning to become comfortable using emotional experiences as teaching and connection opportunities.

Other, more technical tools include behavior contracts, utilizing cost, group contingencies, and restorative justice interventions.

Quail and Ward suggest that parental attunement is a key parent-skill to effectively use positive parenting tools. Attunement involves giving focused attention to the child&#x27;s needs behavioral signals, and matching an appropriate choice of discipline tool. They use this example as an illustration: &quot;rewards undermined intrinsic motivation for children who were already motivated, but had positive effects where motivation was low, and were found to be particularly important for children with ADHD.&quot; From this perspective, reward should not be considered a good or bad tool in itself, but rather evaluated according to its fit with the needs and signals of the child.

Beyond their effectiveness and usefulness as alternatives to corporal punishment, reviewed skills also showed important and often long-term positive effects. Examples included &quot;improved school engagement, academic achievement, participation, communication and social relationships, better self-regulation, higher self-esteem and independence, and lower rates of depression, suicide, substance abuse, sexual risk behavior, conduct disorders, aggression and crime.&quot;. Quail and Ward concluded that the &quot;important positive outcomes shown suggest that use of these tools should be promoted not only for prevention of violence, but for optimum child development.&quot;

<text>Ole Evinrude, born Ole Andreassen Aaslundeie (April 19, 1877 – July 12, 1934) was an American entrepreneur, known for the invention of the first outboard motor with practical commercial application.

==Biography==
Ole Evinrude was born in Hunndalen in the municipality of Vardal (now Gjøvik), in Oppland, Norway. The Evinrude surname, which he adopted in the United States, is an oeconym from the Evenrud farm in Vestre Toten, where his mother was born. In October 1881, his father emigrated to America, followed the next year by Evinrude, his mother and two siblings. Three additional siblings were born in America. The family settled on a farm in Ripley Lake near Cambridge, Wisconsin. At age sixteen, Evinrude went to Madison, where he worked in machinery stores and studied engineering on his own. He became a machinist while working at various machine tool firms in Milwaukee, Pittsburgh, and Chicago.

In 1900, Evinrude co-founded the custom engine firm Clemick &amp; Evinrude. In 1907, he invented the first practical and reliable outboard motor, which was built of steel and brass, and had a crank on the flywheel to start the two-cycle engine. In 1907 he had built his first gasoline-powered outboard motor, and two years later, Evinrude Motor Company was founded in Milwaukee. The simplest type of engine the company produced was a 2-stroke internal combustion engine that was powered by a mixture of gasoline and oil.

Evinrude reported that his invention was inspired by rowing a boat on Okauchee Lake, a small lake outside Milwaukee, Wisconsin, on a hot day to get ice cream for his girlfriend, Bess. By 1912, the firm employed 300 workers. Evinrude let two motorcycle-mad teens tinker in his Milwaukee-based machine shop; one was named Arthur Davidson, who went on to Harley-Davidson motorcycle fame, also based in Milwaukee. Ole Evinrude formed Evinrude Outboard Motors, which he sold in 1913 in order to look after his sick wife.

In 1919, Evinrude invented a more efficient and lighter two-cylinder motor. Having sold his part in Clemick &amp; Evinrude, he founded ELTO or the Elto Outboard Motor Company. (ELTO was an acronym for &quot;Evinrude Light Twin Outboard&quot;.) Although Elto faced stiff competition from other companies, such as the Johnson Motor Company of South Bend, Indiana, Evinrude&#x27;s company survived through acquisitions, eventually forming the Outboard Marine Corporation.

His wife Bess died in 1933, at only 48 years old, and Ole Evinrude died the following year, 57 years old. They were both buried at Pinelawn Cemetery in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. After Evinrude died, his son, Ralph Evinrude, took over day-to-day management of the company, eventually rising to chairman of the board. The company is now called Evinrude Outboard Motors, and is owned by Bombardier Recreational Products.

<text>Wolfe Creek Crater is a well-preserved meteorite impact crater (astrobleme) in Western Australia.

== Description ==
It is accessed via the Tanami Road south of the town of Halls Creek. The crater is central to the Wolfe Creek Meteorite Crater National Park.

The crater averages about in diameter, from rim to present crater floor. It is estimated that the meteorite that formed it was about in diameter and had a mass of about 14,000 tonnes. For many years it was thought to have been created around 300,000 years ago, but in 2019, following investigations by researchers from Portsmouth University together with Australian and US researchers, it is now estimated to be less than 120,000 years old, placing the event in the Late Pleistocene. Small numbers of iron meteorites have been found in the vicinity of the crater, as well as larger so-called &#x27;shale-balls&#x27;, rounded objects made of iron oxide, some weighing as much as .

It was brought to the attention of scientists after being spotted during an aerial survey in 1947, investigated on the ground two months later, and reported in publication in 1949. The European name for the crater comes from a nearby creek, which was in turn named after Robert Wolfe (early reports misspell the name as Wolf Creek), a prospector and storekeeper during the gold rush that established the town of Halls Creek.

== Aboriginal significance ==
The local Djaru (Jaru) Aboriginal people refer to the crater as &quot;Kandimalal&quot;. There are multiple Dreaming stories about the formation of the crater. One such story describes the crater&#x27;s round shape being formed by the passage of a rainbow snake out of the earth, while another snake formed the nearby Sturt Creek. Another story, as told by an Elder, is that one day the crescent moon and the evening star passed very close to each other. The evening star became so hot that it fell to the ground, causing an enormous explosion and flash, followed by a dust cloud. This frightened the people and a long time passed before they ventured near the crater to see what had happened. When they finally went there, they realised that this was the site where the evening star had fallen to the Earth. The Djaru people named the place &quot;Kandimalal&quot; and it is prominent in art from the region.

== Cultural references ==
The crater was featured in the 2005 Australian horror film &quot;Wolf Creek&quot;, and the sequel in 2013, &quot;Wolf Creek 2&quot;. It also features in the Stan Australia streaming service original television series with the same name.

It was the setting for Arthur Upfield&#x27;s 1962 novel &quot;The Will of the Tribe&quot;.

The Wolfe Creek crater has considerable claim to be the second most &#x27;obvious&#x27; (i.e. relatively undeformed by erosion) meteorite crater known on Earth, after the famous Barringer Crater in Arizona.

The crater is mentioned in the 2010 children&#x27;s science fiction book &quot;Alienology&quot; that says (in its universe) that a space craft crashed there.

<text>&quot;The West Wing&quot; is an American serial political drama television series created by Aaron Sorkin that aired on NBC from September 22, 1999, to May 14, 2006. The series is set primarily in the West Wing of the White House, where the Oval Office and offices of presidential senior staff are located, during the fictitious Democratic administration of Josiah Bartlet (played by Martin Sheen).

==Ratings==
== Specials ==
Two special episodes were produced to complement the series and broadcast on NBC. The first was a terrorism-themed episode produced in the wake of the September 11 attacks. The episode pushed the scheduled season premiere back a week and encouraged viewers to donate to charity—profits from the episode and cast members&#x27; weekly pay were also donated. The episode &quot;was written and produced in record time&quot; – less than three weeks. Although timely and well-intentioned, the episode was criticized for being condescending and preachy. 

The second special interspersed the characters&#x27; fictional lives with interviews of real West Wing personnel, including Presidents Ford, Carter and Clinton; press secretaries Marlin Fitzwater and Dee Dee Myers; presidential advisors David Gergen, Paul Begala and incumbent Karl Rove; Secretary of State Henry Kissinger; Chief of Staff Leon Panetta; presidential personal secretary Betty Currie; and speechwriter Peggy Noonan. The documentary won a Primetime Emmy Award in 2002 for &quot;Outstanding Special Class Program&quot;. Both episodes ran within the season 3 television season and were included on the season&#x27;s DVD.

A third retrospective &quot;clip-and-interview&quot; special was slated to air in the hour before the series finale; however, it was axed and replaced with a re-run of the &quot;Pilot&quot; episode, as cast members were not contracted to do the special and there were disputes over pay.

===&quot;A &quot;West Wing&quot; Special to Benefit When We All Vote&quot; (2020)===

&quot;A &quot;West Wing&quot; Special to Benefit When We All Vote&quot; is a reunion special that was released on HBO Max on October 15, 2020. The special serves as a stage version of the season 3 episode &quot;Hartsfield&#x27;s Landing&quot;. The special intended to raise awareness and support for When We All Vote, a non-profit organization that helps increase participation in United States elections.

<text>Woodleigh is a large meteorite impact structure (astrobleme) in Western Australia, centred on Woodleigh Station east of Shark Bay in the Gascoyne region. A team of four scientists at the Geological Survey of Western Australia and the Australian National University, led by Arthur J. Mory, announced the discovery in the 15 April 2000 issue of &quot;Earth and Planetary Science Letters&quot;.

== Description ==
The structure is not exposed at the surface and therefore its size is uncertain. The original discovery team stated in 2000 that it may be up to in diameter, but others argue it may be much smaller, with one 2003 study suggesting a diameter closer to . The larger estimate of , if correct, would make this impact structure tied for the fourth largest confirmed impact structure in the world, and imply a bolide (asteroid or comet) about in diameter. A more recent study in 2010 suggests the structure could be between or more, and was produced by a comet or asteroid wide.
The central uplift, interpreted to be in diameter, was first intersected by drilling activities in the late 1970s; however its significance as an impact structure was only realised in 1997 during a gravity survey. In 1999, a new core sample was taken. The thin veins of melted glass, breccia, and shocked quartz found would have formed under pressures 100,000 times greater than atmospheric pressure at sea level, or between 10 and 100 times greater than those generated by volcanic or earthquake activity. Only a large impact could have generated such conditions. The reported discovery in 2018 of the extremely rare mineral reidite in a drillcore sample from the central uplift zone, supports the interpretation of the original crater as being over in diameter, and possibly the largest in Australia.

The Woodleigh impact event, originally thought in the early 2000s to have occurred between 259 Ma to 201 Ma (or between the Late Permian and Late Triassic) is now thought to date from 364±8 million years (Late Devonian). This time corresponds approximately to the Late Devonian extinction of about 370 million years ago. There is evidence for other large impact events at around the same time, such as the East Warburton Basin, so if the extinction is related to impact, perhaps more than one crater was involved.

Of the two dozen or more impact structures known in Australia, the three largest are Woodleigh, Acraman, and Tookoonooka. The Gnargoo structure, which has remarkable similarities to Woodleigh, is a nearby proposed impact crater on the Gascoyne platform.

<doc id="780621" wikidata="Q3310686" url="?curid=780621" title="Winchester College football">
<text>Winchester College football, also known as Winkies, is a code of football played at Winchester College in Hampshire, England. Its rules make it somewhat resemble rugby football but with a round football and little handling of the ball. It was once played in South Africa, but is now restricted to the community directly connected to Winchester College. The game&#x27;s season is during the spring term from January to March, the second term of the academic year. It developed from an unstructured street game of the 17th century into a standardised sport by the early 19th century. This was first played on the top of St. Catherine&#x27;s Hill with a line of junior boys down each side to keep the ball from rolling away. The game was moved to the College&#x27;s playing fields, and the lines of boys were replaced with netting. The main game has teams of 15, but in smaller competitions the teams may be of 10 or 6 players.

== Rules ==

The game somewhat resembles rugby football, as players can kick the ball or run with it. The players attempt to score by kicking the ball over the end of the pitch. &quot;Tatler&quot; quotes a pupil&#x27;s description of it as &quot;our combination of football and rugby, likened to an English bulldog playing with a ball&quot;. The &quot;Financial Times&quot; commented that the game could substitute for the Ancient Greek game of Pankration, but that a &quot;Kasparov-like mind&quot; was necessary to cope with the ever-changing rules. The aim of the game is to kick the ball (an over-inflated soccer football) into worms – the area at either end of canvas. Unlike in Rugby football, a player need only kick the ball across the worms line to score.

The basic principle is that each team can only kick the ball once before the other team touches it (unless the kicker has been deemed to have kicked it his hardest). The main rules are called tag, dribble, behind your side, and handiwork.

* Tag occurs when a team-mate kicks the ball, and a man on his own team then kicks it without waiting for the other team to touch the ball. This means that passing forwards is not allowed.
* Dribble occurs when the same man touches the ball twice when the ball has not gone backwards, unless he has first kicked it as hard as he can. This means that dribbling as in soccer is not allowed.
* Behind your side (a kind of offside rule) is designed to stop people loitering at some position up the pitch. Once a man on your team kicks the ball, the rest of the team must endeavour to get back to the point where he kicked the ball from (not just behind the kicker as in rugby football) before they can move forward up the pitch.
* Handiwork is any illegal use of the hands. The rule allows somewhat more freedom than the handling rule in soccer. Only the kicks (full backs) may use their hands to control the ball. Any other player may catch the ball on the full toss, but use of the hands at any other time is deemed handiwork. A catch on the full toss by any player enables them to take up to three steps and then bust (punt) the ball.

Breaking any of these rules means that play is brought one or two posts back for a hot (scrum). Once the ball is out of the hot, the &quot;hotwatches&quot; (scrum-halves) try to get the ball past the hot, either to kick the ball into worms, or to kick the ball into ropes (off the canvas, resulting in a hot where the ball went out). Minor infringements result in a free bust.

The key points of the scoring system are that:

* A behind or 1 point is scored if the ball crosses into Worms after touching an opposition player or after going into ropes (between the rope and the netting), or if a team is awarded enough penalty Posts to send them back to worms (the final post along ropes).
* A conversion or 2 points is scored, following a behind, when an opposition kick from the point one metre in front of worms is returned by the team that scored the behind, and the ball crosses into worms; this converts the behind into a goal.
* A goal or 3 points is scored when the ball enters Worms without being touched by an opposition player and without being in ropes. After a goal is scored play resumes from a bust off.

== The pitch ==

Winchester football is played on a pitch known as a canvas, 80 metres long and 15 metres wide, flanked on either side by 2.5 metre high netting (confusingly called the canvas as well; as is the squad for a winkies team) designed to prevent balls from being kicked off the pitch. Approximately a metre in front of the netting and running parallel to it is a thick rope, supported at a height of one metre by nine stout posts at intervals along the canvas (or seven posts, as on some of the smaller pitches on Palmer Field). The distance between two adjacent posts is known as a post; hence the total length of the canvas is normally eight posts. The inaccessible area between the ropes and the netting is known as ropes. The goal area off each end of the pitch is known as worms.

== Teams ==

Major matches are played with teams made up of 15 players, known as XVs; other matches can be played with smaller teams, usually 6 or 10, known as VIs and Xs respectively. In VIs, there are two kicks (full-backs), one hotwatch (half-back) and three hot (scrum) players. In Xs, there are two kicks, three hotwatches and five hot players. In XVs there are three kicks, four hotwatches and eight hot players. The team sizes may differ sometimes in smaller house competitions, with IXs and XIs being common-place. The players&#x27; roles are as follows:

* Kick: a defensive role between a full-back in Rugby football and a goalkeeper in soccer, the kick plays at the back of the field and may use their hands to control the ball. 
* Hotwatch: like a half-back in Rugby football, awaits the ball emerging from the hot, and may pass the ball backwards (without using their hands) or kick it forwards.
* Hot: like the scrum in Rugby football, pushes against the other team&#x27;s hot, and attempts to heel the ball back to their hotwatches, or to keep the ball in the hot and advance up the field. When the members of the hot are not in an actual scrum, they kick the ball.

Major matches are played between three teams, called Old Tutor&#x27;s Houses (OTH), Commoners, and College. OTH wear brown and white striped zephyrs (football shirts), and consist of pupils from Furley&#x27;s, Toye&#x27;s, Cook&#x27;s, Chawker&#x27;s, and Hopper&#x27;s boarding houses. Commoners wear red and white striped zephyrs, and consist of pupils from Kenny&#x27;s, Freddie&#x27;s, Phil&#x27;s, Trant&#x27;s, and Beloe&#x27;s. College wear blue and white striped zephyrs, and consist only of pupils from College, the scholars&#x27; institution.

== History ==

In the 17th century, Winchester football was played in Kingsgate Street; each team attempted to move a football from one end to the other, with little in the way of rules. The game was then moved away from the College to the flat, grassy top of St. Catherine&#x27;s Hill. The game persisted with few rules, but required a long line of kickers-in, junior boys, on both sides of the pitch to keep the ball from rolling away down the hillsides.

By about 1825, the rules had been standardised and matches with large teams of 22 players, 20 in the hot (scrum) and 2 behinds (backs) were played between College (the scholars resident in the school&#x27;s medieval buildings) and Commoners. The fundamental rules of &quot;dribble&quot; and &quot;tag&quot; were added at this stage. By 1860, the game was moved from the top of St. Catherine&#x27;s Hill to where it is played now, on Meads. The lines of kickers-in were then replaced by canvas sheets, resulting in the name &quot;canvas&quot; for the football pitch, and soon afterwards by netting to allow people to watch the game without the aid of a ladder.

By 1901, teams had been reduced to 15, with 8 in the hot, 3 &quot;hotwatchers&quot; (scrum-halves), and 3 &quot;behinds&quot;.

The earliest evidence of coloured shirts used to identify football teams comes from Winchester football: an image from before 1840 is entitled &quot;The commoners have red and the college boys blue jerseys.&quot; The use of coloured shirts at Winchester College was confirmed again in 1859: &quot;Precisely at twelve o&#x27;clock, according to good old custom, the blue jerseys of college and the red of commoners mingled in the grand commencing &#x27;hot&#x27;.&quot; That same year, Winchester College played a match of an undefined variety of football against the Winchester Garrison Officers; 28 &quot;goals&quot; were scored, with 11 players on each side, leading the historian Ian Denness to suggest that the rules were a hybrid of the Winchester and Eton football games.

Winchester College football was the first variety of football that was played in South Africa, promoted by Canon Gorge Ogilvie, principal of the Diocesan College in Rondebosch; it remained dominant until 1878.

In 1941, General Archibald Wavell, an alumnus of Winchester (an Old Wykehamist), was congratulated by telegram for his success in pushing the Italian 10th Army back in North Africa with the words &quot;hotting the enemy over worms&quot; (pushing the hostile scrum back over the goal line). In 1996, another Old Wykehamist, John Whittingdale, speaking in Parliament in a debate on sport, said that &quot;at school, I was forced to play a weekly game of fives, as well as a peculiarly brutal game known as Winchester College football, which normally resulted in substantial injuries to the participants.&quot; 
In the 21st century, Winchester College football has become known as Winkies. An older Winchester college notion for it is &quot;Win Co Fo&quot;.

<text>The Yarrabubba impact structure is the eroded remnant of an impact crater, situated in the northern Yilgarn Craton near Yarrabubba Station between the towns of Sandstone and Meekatharra, Mid West Western Australia. With an age of 2.229 billion years, it is the oldest known impact structure on Earth.

== Description ==
While the rim of the original crater has been completely eroded and is not readily visible on aerial or satellite images, it is centered on a feature called the Barlangi Rock. The evidence for the extent of impact comes from the presence of shocked quartz and shatter cones in outcrops of granite interpreted to be near the centre of the original crater, and from geophysical data. The diameter of the original crater is uncertain, but has been estimated to be from . Computer simulations of a in diameter impactor crashing into a thick ice sheet covering granite bedrock produced a crater of final diameter compatible with the Yarrabubba crater.

=== Age ===
The impact has been dated to 2,229 ± 5 million years ago, making it the world&#x27;s oldest confirmed impact structure. This date places the impact in the early Rhyacian, around the end of the Huronian glaciation.

The age finding was based on analysis of ancient crystals of the minerals zircon and monazite found in the crater. Scientists used uranium–lead dating to analyze the samples and to determine the age of the impact crater.

<text>Jonah Sharp (alias Spacetime Continuum) is a producer, remixer, and DJ of electronic music. Sharp was born in Edinburgh. After starting his musical career as a jazz drummer in London, U.K., he moved to San Francisco, U.S. During the 1990s Sharp released a series of albums on the Astralwerks record label. The first of these, entitled &quot;Alien Dreamtime&quot;, featured a live recording of ethnobotanist, writer and psychedelic researcher Terence McKenna delivering a series of lectures to the accompaniment of Spacetime Continuum music. Sharp&#x27;s subsequent albums combined experimental electronic music with subtle jazz elements and elaborate rhythm structures. His work has had a clear influence on contemporary psybient artists, such as Shpongle and others.

Jonah Sharp has also released collaborations with Tetsu Inoue, Bill Laswell, Mixmaster Morris, Pete Namlook, David Moufang, and Plaid. He has remixed songs from Nine Inch Nails, Meat Beat Manifesto, Ponga, Teknostep, Susumu Yokota, and Matt Herbert. He has produced songs for Ursula Rucker and Paradise Boys.

<doc id="780629" wikidata="Q10997658" url="?curid=780629" title="Non-volatile memory">
<text>Non-volatile memory (NVM) or non-volatile storage is a type of computer memory that can retain stored information even after power is removed. In contrast, volatile memory needs constant power in order to retain data.

Non-volatile memory typically refers to storage in memory chips, which store data in floating-gate memory cells consisting of floating-gate MOSFETs (metal–oxide–semiconductor field-effect transistors), including flash memory storage such as NAND flash and solid-state drives (SSD).

Other examples of non-volatile memory include read-only memory (ROM), EPROM (erasable programmable ROM) and EEPROM (electrically erasable programmable ROM), ferroelectric RAM, most types of computer data storage devices (e.g. disk storage, hard disk drives, optical discs, floppy disks, and magnetic tape), and early computer storage methods such as punched tape and cards.

==Overview==
Non-volatile memory is typically used for the task of secondary storage or long-term persistent storage. The most widely used form of primary storage today is a volatile form of random access memory (RAM), meaning that when the computer is shut down, anything contained in RAM is lost. However, most forms of non-volatile memory have limitations that make them unsuitable for use as primary storage. Typically, non-volatile memory costs more, provides lower performance, or has a limited lifetime compared to volatile random access memory.

Non-volatile data storage can be categorized into electrically addressed systems, for example, flash memory, and read-only memory) and mechanically addressed systems (hard disks, optical discs, magnetic tape, holographic memory, and such). Generally speaking, electrically addressed systems are expensive, and have limited capacity, but are fast, whereas mechanically addressed systems cost less per bit, but are slower.

== Electrically addressed ==
Electrically addressed semiconductor non-volatile memories can be categorized according to their write mechanism. 

=== Read-only and read-mostly devices ===
Mask ROMs are factory programmable only and typically used for large-volume products which are not required to be updated after the memory device is manufactured. 

Programmable read-only memory (PROM) can be altered once after the memory device is manufactured using a PROM programmer. Programming is often done before the device is installed in its target system, typically an embedded system. The programming is permanent, and further changes require the replacement of the device. Data is stored by physically altering (burning) storage sites in the device.

An EPROM is an erasable ROM that can be changed more than once. However, writing new data to an EPROM requires a special programmer circuit. EPROMs have a quartz window that allows them to be erased with ultraviolet light, but the whole device is cleared at one time. A one-time programmable (OTP) device may be implemented using an EPROM chip without the quartz window; this is less costly to manufacture. An electrically erasable programmable read-only memory EEPROM uses voltage to erase memory. These erasable memory devices require a significant amount of time to erase data and write new data; they are not usually configured to be programmed by the processor of the target system. Data is stored using floating-gate transistors, which require special operating voltages to trap or release electric charge on an insulated control gate to store information.

=== Flash memory ===
Flash memory is a solid-state chip that maintains stored data without any external power source. It is a close relative to the EEPROM; it differs in that erase operations must be done on a block basis, and its capacity is substantially larger than that of an EEPROM. Flash memory devices use two different technologies—NOR and NAND—to map data. NOR flash provides high-speed random access, reading and writing data in specific memory locations; it can retrieve as little as a single byte. NAND flash reads and writes sequentially at high speed, handling data in blocks. However, it is slower on reading when compared to NOR. NAND flash reads faster than it writes, quickly transferring whole pages of data. Less expensive than NOR flash at high densities, NAND technology offers higher capacity for the same-size silicon.

=== Ferroelectric RAM (F-RAM) ===
Ferroelectric RAM (FeRAM, F-RAM or FRAM) is a form of random-access memory similar in construction to DRAM, both use a capacitor and transistor but instead of using a simple dielectric layer the capacitor, an F-RAM cell contains a thin ferroelectric film of lead zirconate titanate , commonly referred to as PZT. The Zr/Ti atoms in the PZT change polarity in an electric field, thereby producing a binary switch. Due to the PZT crystal maintaining polarity, F-RAM retains its data memory when power is shut off or interrupted.

Due to this crystal structure and how it is influenced, F-RAM offers distinct properties from other nonvolatile memory options, including extremely high, although not infinite, endurance (exceeding 1016 read/write cycles for 3.3 V devices), ultra-low power consumption (since F-RAM does not require a charge pump like other non-volatile memories), single-cycle write speeds, and gamma radiation tolerance.

=== Magnetoresistive RAM (MRAM) ===
Magnetoresistive RAM stores data in magnetic storage elements called magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJs). The first generation of MRAM, such as Everspin Technologies&#x27; 4 Mbit, utilized field-induced writing. The second generation is developed mainly through two approaches: Thermal-assisted switching (TAS) which is being developed by Crocus Technology, and Spin-transfer torque (STT) which Crocus, Hynix, IBM, and several other companies are developing.

=== Phase-change Memory (PCM) ===
Phase-change memory stores data in chalcogenide glass, which can reversibly change the phase between the amorphous and the crystalline state, accomplished by heating and cooling the glass. The crystalline state has low resistance, and the amorphous phase has high resistance, which allows currents to be switched ON and OFF to represent digital 1 and 0 states.

===FeFET memory===
FeFET memory uses a transistor with ferroelectric material to permanently retain state.

===RRAM memory===
RRAM (ReRAM) works by changing the resistance across a dielectric solid-state material often referred to as a memristor. ReRAM involves generating defects in a thin oxide layer, known as oxygen vacancies (oxide bond locations where the oxygen has been removed), which can subsequently charge and drift under an electric field. The motion of oxygen ions and vacancies in the oxide would be analogous to the motion of electrons and holes in a semiconductor.

Although ReRAM was initially seen as a replacement technology for flash memory, the cost and performance benefits of ReRAM have not been enough for companies to proceed with the replacement. Apparently, a broad range of materials can be used for ReRAM. However, the discovery that the popular high-κ gate dielectric HfO2 can be used as a low-voltage ReRAM has encouraged researchers to investigate more possibilities.

== Mechanically addressed systems ==
Mechanically addressed systems use a recording head to read and write on a designated storage medium. Since the access time depends on the physical location of the data on the device, mechanically addressed systems may be sequential access. For example, magnetic tape stores data as a sequence of bits on a long tape; transporting the tape past the recording head is required to access any part of the storage. Tape media can be removed from the drive and stored, giving indefinite capacity at the cost of the time required to retrieve a dismounted tape.

Hard disk drives use a rotating magnetic disk to store data; access time is longer than for semiconductor memory, but the cost per stored data bit is very low, and they provide random access to any location on the disk. Formerly, removable disk packs were common, allowing storage capacity to be expanded. Optical discs store data by altering a pigment layer on a plastic disk and are similarly random access. Read-only and read-write versions are available; removable media again allows indefinite expansion, and some automated systems (e.g. optical jukebox) were used to retrieve and mount disks under direct program control.

Domain-wall memory (DWM) stores data in a magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJs), which works by controlling domain wall (DW) motion in ferromagnetic nanowires.

== Organic ==
Thinfilm produces rewriteable non-volatile organic ferroelectric memory based on ferroelectric polymers. Thinfilm successfully demonstrated roll-to-roll printed memories in 2009. In Thinfilm&#x27;s organic memory the ferroelectric polymer is sandwiched between two sets of electrodes in a passive matrix. Each crossing of metal lines is a ferroelectric capacitor and defines a memory cell.

==Non-volatile main memory==
Non-volatile main memory (NVMM) is primary storage with non-volatile attributes. This application of non-volatile memory presents security challenges. NVDIMM is one example of the non-volatile main memory.

<doc id="780631" wikidata="Q553844" url="?curid=780631" title="Johannes Ewald">
<text>Johannes Ewald (18 November 174317 March 1781) was a Danish national dramatist, psalm writer and poet. The lyrics of a song from one of his plays are used for one of the Danish national anthems, &quot;Kong Christian stod ved højen mast&quot; which has equal status of national anthem together with &quot;Der er et yndigt land&quot;. Quite until the days of romanticism, Ewald was considered the unsurpassed Danish poet. Today he is probably more lauded than read; though considered classics, only few of his works have become popular.

==Biography==
He was born in Copenhagen, Denmark.
Ewald grew up in a strongly pietistic parsonage.
His father was Enevold Ewald (1696-1754), vicar at the orphanage in Copenhagen. His maternal grandmother Marie Wulf (1685–1738), was a pietist and later a follower of the Moravian Church.

He was fatherless from an early age. He was sent to school in the Duchy of Schleswig, his father&#x27;s birthplace, and returned to enter the University of Copenhagen in 1758. At 15 he ran away along with his brother and enlisted in the Prussian service. Being compelled to join a regiment of artillery at Magdeburg, instead of being attached to the hussars as he had been promised, he deserted the Prussian standard in the Seven Years&#x27; War, and entered the Austrian service, where he was made a non-commissioned officer. After a few months he again deserted, returned home. He had returned from the Seven Years&#x27; War seriously weakened.

He began to apply himself seriously to theology and in 1762 he became cand.theol. in 1762. Although he was educated as a theologian, but his real interest was in literature. An unhappy love for Arendse Hulegaard, inspired his later poetry deeply. After the death of his father, his mother was remarried to Arendse&#x27;s uncle. Arendse later married another.

The following years were spent living as a bohemian and writing poetry in Copenhagen; there were also a time of alcoholism and conflicts with his mother and step-father. For most of his life he was under their tutelage and he never took up a profession. His lifestyle had much in common with his contemporary Johan Herman Wessel (1742–1785) although as writers they differed greatly.
On the death of Frederick V of Denmark, Ewald was requested to compose an elegy (1766). The general admiration with which it was received roused his ambition, and he soon became one of the most eminent lyric and tragic poets of his nation.

In 1769, Ewald was severely attacked by gout which caused him to be confined to bed.
From 1773 to 1775 he had a rather happy convalescence at Rungstedlund (later the home of Karen Blixen). Ewald wrote some of his best verses during this time, but a conflict with his family led to his removal to the small North Zealand town of Humlebæk (1775–77), which depressed him and worsened his alcoholism. Finally, friends brought him to Søbækshus, near Helsingør, and where he lived for some years under growing public interest and literary fame. Johannes Ewald led a short and troubled life, marked by alcoholism and financial problems. His life darkened by illness, distress and misfortune, Ewald died at age 37 and was buried in the cemetery of Trinitatis Church in Copenhagen. However, the cemetery largely disappeared in the aftermath of the Copenhagen Fire of 1795 (&quot;Københavns brand 1795&quot;) .

==Works==
===Poetry===
As an author Ewald is a prominent representative of Danish sentimentalism but at the same time a forerunner of romanticism. His main inspiration was German poetry (Friedrich Gottlieb Klopstock), but other writers including Edward Young and Laurence Sterne, as well as Jean-Jacques Rousseau, are obvious inspirations as well. Violent expressions of feeling (happiness, sorrow and love) are typical in his writing; these elements are apparently spontaneous but, at the same time, deliberately and artificially drawn up. Behind this a clear pietist tune is felt.

Several Ewald &quot;poems&quot; are Danish classics. He had his break-through with a melodious and expressive commemorative poem at the death of King Frederick V (1766). The famous &quot;Rungsteds Lyksaligheder&quot; (1773&quot;The Happiness of Rungsted&quot;) is an ode to the Creator. &quot;Ode til Sjælen&quot; (&quot;For the Soul&quot;) is a worthy hailing of Man&#x27;s uniqueness. &quot;Til min M***&quot; (&quot;For my M(oltke)) is a grateful praise for a noble benefactor, during the unhappy Humlebæk period. The hymn &quot;Udrust Dig, helt fra Golgatha&quot; (&quot;Arm Yourself, Hero of Golgatha&quot;, 1781), practically written on his death-bed, must be mentioned.

===Drama===

Just as important are Ewald&#x27;s &quot;dramas&quot;. Ewald was the first to rely heavily on Norse mythology, a trend which begins to point towards romanticism. He wrote the plays &quot;Rolf Krage&quot; in 1770, &quot;Balders Død&quot; (Eng. transl. &quot;The Death of Balder&quot;, 1889) in 1773, and &quot;Fiskerne&quot; (&quot;The Fishermen)&quot; in 1779. From the latter play one song is still remembered by most Danes: &quot;King Christian stood by the lofty mast&quot; that shares the position of being the national anthem of Denmark (the other is Oehlenschläger&#x27;s &quot;There is a lovely Land&quot;). The two plays &quot;Balders&quot; &quot;Død&quot; and &quot;Fiskerne&quot; were put in music by composer Johann Hartmann.

===Prose===
Ewald&#x27;s main prose work was the unfinished autobiography &quot;Levnet og Meninger&quot; (&quot;Life and Opinions&quot;, written 1774–78, published 1804–08). It deals with the young Ewald&#x27;s infatuation with Arendse and his escape to military life.

<text>Zhamanshin () is a meteorite crater in Kazakhstan. It is in diameter and the age is estimated to be 900,000 ± 100,000 years (Pleistocene). The crater is exposed at the surface.

== Description ==
It is believed that the Zhamanshin crater is the site of the most recent meteorite impact event of the magnitude that could have produced a disruption comparable to that of a nuclear winter, but it was not sufficiently large enough to have caused a mass extinction.

Preliminary papers in the late 1970s suggested either Elgygytgyn, or Zhamanshin, as the source of the Australasian strewnfield.

<text>Paul Peter Ewald, FRS (January23, 1888August22, 1985) was a German crystallographer and physicist, a pioneer of X-ray diffraction methods.

==Education==
Ewald received his early education in the classics at the Gymnasium in Berlin and Potsdam, where he learned to speak Greek, French, and English, in addition to his native German.

Ewald began his higher education in physics, chemistry, and mathematics at Gonville and Caius College in Cambridge, during the winter of 1905. In 1906 and 1907, he continued his formal education at the University of Göttingen, where his interests turned primarily to mathematics. At that time, Göttingen was a world-class center of mathematics under the three “Mandarins” of Göttingen: Felix Klein, David Hilbert, and Hermann Minkowski. While studying at Göttingen, Ewald was taken on by Hilbert as an &quot;Ausarbeiter&quot;, a paid position as a scribe, i.e. he would take notes in Hilbert’s classes, have the notes approved by Hilbert’s assistant — at that time, Ernst Hellinger — and then prepare a clean copy for the &quot;Lesezimmer&quot; — the mathematics reading room. In 1907, he continued his mathematical studies at the Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich (LMU), under Arnold Sommerfeld at his Institute for Theoretical Physics. He was granted his doctorate in 1912. His doctoral thesis developed the laws of propagation of X-rays in single crystals. After earning his doctorate, he was an assistant to Sommerfeld.

During the 1911 Christmas recess and in January 1912, Ewald was finishing the writing of his doctoral thesis. It was on a walk through &quot;Englischer Garten&quot; in Munich, in January, that Ewald was telling Max von Laue about his thesis topic. The wavelengths of concern to Ewald were in the visible region of the spectrum and hence much larger than the spacing between the resonators in Ewald’s crystal model. Laue seemed distracted and wanted to know what would be the effect if much smaller wavelengths were considered. It was not until June of that year that Ewald heard Sommerfeld report to the &quot;Physikalische Gesellschaft&quot; of Göttingen on the successful diffraction of X-rays by Max von Laue, Paul Knipping and Walter Friedrich at LMU, for which Laue would be awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics, in 1914.

With the rise of theoretical physics in the early part of the twentieth century and its foundation in mathematics, David Hilbert decided to lend an organizing hand to formalizing the sciences, starting with physics. In 1912, Hilbert asked his friend and colleague Arnold Sommerfeld to send him a special assistant for physics. Sommerfeld sent Ewald, who was dubbed as “Hilbert’s tutor for physics”, and he performed this function until 1913, when Sommerfeld sent another one of his students, Alfred Landé. The first problem assigned to Ewald was to review the controversy in the literature on the constants of elasticity in crystals and report back. A few years later, Max Born, at Göttingen, solved the problem.
During Ewald’s stay in Göttingen, he was often a visitor at &quot;El BoKaReBo&quot;, a boarding house run by Sister Annie at Dahlmannstrasse 17. The name was derived from the first letters of the last names of its boarders: “El” for Ella Philippson (a medical student), “Bo” for Max Born (a Privatdozent) and Hans Bolza (a physics student), “Ka” for Theodore von Kármán (a Privatdozent), and “Re” for Albrecht Renner (a medical student). Richard Courant, a mathematician and Privatdozent, called these people the “in group”. It was here that Ewald met Ella Philippson, who was to become his wife.

In the spring of 1913, Niels Bohr, of the Institute for Theoretical Physics at the University of Copenhagen, submitted his theory of the Bohr atomic model for publication. Later that year, Ewald attended the Birmingham meeting of the British Association where he heard accounts and discussions of James Jeans’ review on radiation theory and Bohr’s model. This ignited a major new area of research for Sommerfeld and his students — the study and interpretation of atomic spectra and molecular band spectroscopy and theoretical modeling of atomic and molecular structure.

During World War I, Ewald served in the German military as a medical technician. When he could, he continued to think about the physics of his doctoral thesis, and he developed the dynamical theory of X-ray diffraction, which he was later to use in his Habilitationsschrift. At the conclusion of the war, he returned to LMU as an assistant to Sommerfeld. He completed his Habilitation in 1917, and became a Privatdozent there, while remaining as an assistant to Sommerfeld.

In 1921, while still at LMU, Ewald published a paper on the theta function method of analyzing dipole fields in crystals, an offshoot from his earlier work on the dynamical theory of optics and X-rays in crystals, which appeared in three journal publications. According to Ewald, the impetus for the method came from a skiing holiday in Mittenwald, at Easter, in 1911. It was Sommerfeld’s practice to take his students and assistants on skiing outings in the winter and mountain climbing outings in the summer, where the discussions of physics were as hard as the physical exertion of the outings. Ewald, was having trouble subtracting out of his calculations the field of the test dipole. The solution was provided by Sommerfeld’s assistant and former doctoral student, Peter Debye, in a discussion that took no more than 15 minutes. Ewald’s paper has been widely cited in the literature as well as scientific books, such as &quot;Dynamical Theory of Crystal Lattices&quot;, by Max Born and Kun Huang.

==Career==
When Erwin Schrödinger let it be known that he was leaving his position as extraordinarius professor at the Technische Hochschule Stuttgart to go to the University of Breslau, Ewald was called and accepted the position in 1921. In 1922, he was called to the University of Münster. Ewald used the offer to better his position at Stuttgart to ordinarius professor; however, while Ewald was promoted to ordinarius professor, the established position was actually retained as an extraordinarius professorship. 

From 1922, Erwin Fues, also a former doctoral student of Sommerfeld, did postgraduate work at the Stuttgart Technische Hochschule under Ewald; Fues completed his Habilitation in 1924. Also in that year, Ewald became co-editor of &quot;Zeitschrift für Kristallographie&quot;. In 1929, he received a call to the Technische Hochschule Hanover. Again, he used this call to better his position at Stuttgart by negotiating for a second assistant, the permanent conversion of his position to that of ordinarius professor, and a separate building for his activities. The building was formally opened in 1930 as the Institute for Theoretical Physics, with Ewald as director. The institute was modeled after Sommerfeld’s Institute for Theoretical Physics at Munich, in that it would conduct theoretical work as well as have space and equipment for experimental work. 

In 1931, Ewald was appointed director of the physical science division.

At Göttingen, Richard Courant had taken Hilbert’s lecture notes which were available in the &quot;Lesezimmer&quot;, edited them and added to them to write a two-volume work. The first volume, &quot;Methoden der mathematischen Physik I&quot;, was published in 1924. 

Upon seeing the book, Ewald was compelled to write a detailed review describing it as providing mathematical tools, characterized by eigenvalues and eigenfunctions, for the theoretical physics then being developed.

The Courant-Hilbert book fortuitously contained the mathematics necessary for the development of the Heisenberg-Born matrix mechanics formulation of quantum mechanics and also for Schrödinger’s wave mechanics formulation, both put forward in 1925. The main thrust of Ewald’s work was X-ray crystallography, and Ewald was the eponym of Ewald construction and the Ewald sphere, both useful constructs in that field.

In 1929, in order to remove confusion from the proliferation of crystallographic data, Ewald proposed review and collection of the best data into a single publication. The results were published in 1935 as the &quot;Internationale Tabellen zur Bestimmung von Kristallstrukturen&quot;. Another contribution by Ewald, published in 1931, &quot;Strukturbericht Volume I (1913-1928)&quot; was edited by Ewald and C. Hermann.

Ewald was elected Rector at Stuttgart in 1932. However, due to increasing difficulties with faculty who were members of National Socialism in Germany, he resigned his position in the spring of 1933, one year before his term was due to expire. Ewald continued with his other activities. However, over increasing problems with the Dozentenbund, Wilhelm Stortz, University Rector, asked Ewald to leave. He emigrated to England in 1937 along with his mother, the painter Clara Ewald, and took a research position in Cambridge, until he was offered and accepted a lectureship at Queen&#x27;s University Belfast in 1939. He later became a professor of mathematical physics.

While lecturing at Duke University in 1937, Hans Bethe, who got his doctorate under Sommerfeld in 1928, bumped into Ewald&#x27;s daughter Rose, who had already emigrated to the United States and who was attending the school. They were married in September 1939. Thus, Bethe became son-in-law to Paul Peter Ewald.

Near the end of World War II, Sommerfeld organized his lecture notes and began writing the six-volume &quot;Lectures on Theoretical Physics&quot;. While at the Polytechnic Institute of Brooklyn, Ewald wrote a &quot;Foreword to Sommerfeld’s Course&quot;, which appeared in the English translation of Sommerfeld’s work.

Also, toward the end of World War II, Ewald was concerned that peace would result in the establishment of multiple, competing national journals of crystallography. So, in 1944, at Oxford, he proposed the establishment of an International Union of Crystallography (IUCr) that would have sole responsibility for publishing crystallographic research. In 1946, he was elected chairman of the Provisional International Crystallographic Committee, in a London meeting of crystallographers, from 13 countries; he served in this capacity until 1948, when the Union was formed. The Committee also nominated him Editor of the journal to be published by the Union. The first issue of &quot;Acta Crystallographica&quot; was published in 1948, the same year that Ewald chaired the first General Assembly and International Congress of the IUCr, which was held at Harvard University.

In 1952, Ewald was elected president of the American Crystallographic Association. He served on the IUCr Executive Committee from its foundation until 1966, and he was its Vice-President in 1957 and President in 1960, a position he held until 1963. His editorship of its journal &quot;Acta Crystallographica&quot; extended from its inception in 1948 to 1959.

A decade after moving to Belfast, Ewald moved to the United States in 1949 and took a position at the Polytechnic Institute of Brooklyn, as a professor and head of the physics department. He retired as head of the department in 1957 and from teaching in 1959.

<doc id="780649" wikidata="Q4889259" url="?curid=780649" title="Benjamin Stoddert Ewell">
<text>Benjamin Stoddert Ewell (June 10, 1810 – June 19, 1894) was a United States and Confederate army officer, civil engineer, and educator from James City County, Virginia. He graduated from the U.S. Military Academy at West Point, New York in 1832 and served as an officer and educator. 
Although he personally did not favor secession of Virginia from the Union, at the outset of the American Civil War (1861–1865), he helped form local militia in the Peninsula region of Hampton Roads. His work designing and constructing the Williamsburg Line of defensive works of the city and Fort Magruder at its center was a factor in delaying Federal troops attempting to chase retreating Confederates during the Peninsula Campaign, a failed attempt to capture the capital city of Richmond in 1862. His younger brother was Confederate General Richard S. Ewell, a senior commander under Stonewall Jackson and Robert E. Lee.

Benjamin Ewell is best remembered for his long tenure as the sixteenth president of the College of William and Mary in Williamsburg before, during and after the American Civil War. Benjamin Ewell&#x27;s tireless efforts to restore the historic school and its programs during and after Reconstruction became legendary in Williamsburg and at the college and were ultimately successful, with funding from both the U.S. Congress and the Commonwealth of Virginia.

==Youth, education, early career==
Benjamin Stoddert Ewell was born in the Georgetown section of Washington, D.C. He was the son of Dr. Thomas Ewell and his wife Elizabeth Stoddert Ewell, and was a grandson of Benjamin Stoddert, first U.S. Secretary of the Navy.

He graduated from the United States Military Academy at West Point, New York, in 1832, and assigned to the Fourth Artillery of the U.S. Army. However, Ewell stayed on as an assistant professor of mathematics at West Point from 1832 to 1835, and assistant professor of natural and experimental philosophy there in 1835 and 1836.

In 1836, he left West Point and became an assistant engineer of the Baltimore and Susquehanna Railroad, connecting Baltimore, Maryland with Sunbury, Pennsylvania, from 1836 until 1839.

Moving to Virginia in 1839, at Hampden–Sydney College, he became professor of mathematics, serving from 1839 to 1842 and of mathematics and natural philosophy from 1842 to 1846. He then moved to Lexington, Virginia, where he was professor of mathematics and military science at Washington College (which later became Washington and Lee University) from 1846 to 1848.

In 1848, he accepted a position as professor of mathematics and acting president of the College of William and Mary in Williamsburg, Virginia. He purchased a farm in nearby James City County west of the old colonial capital city along the Richmond-Williamsburg Stage Road (now U.S. Route 60) and built a large plantation house there which became known as Ewell Hall. He was later named permanent president, and served in that capacity between 1854 and 1888, even between 1861 and 1865 when the college was in abeyance.

==American Civil War==
In 1861, he became captain of the college militia. Enlistments in the Confederate States Army depleted the student body, and on May 10, 1861, the faculty voted to close the college for the duration of the conflict. The College Building was used as a Confederate barracks and later as a hospital, first by Confederate, and later Union forces.

Although he had been opposed to secession for Virginia, during the American Civil War, he joined the regular forces. The 32nd Virginia Infantry was accepted into Confederate service on July 1, 1861, after it had been formed for local defense at Hampton by Ewell from several local militia units from Elizabeth City County, Warwick County, York County, and James City County. He was commissioned as a colonel in the Confederate Army. In 1861 and 1862, under General John B. Magruder and the Army of the Peninsula, Ewell had the primary responsibility for developing and constructing the Williamsburg Line, a line of defensive fortifications across the Virginia Peninsula east of Williamsburg anchored by College Creek a tributary of the James River on the south and Queen&#x27;s Creek, a tributary of the York River on the north. A series of 14 redoubts were built along the line, with the earthen Fort Magruder at the junction of the two main loads leading from the lower Peninsula to the east, the Williamsburg-Yorktown Road, and the Lee&#x27;s Mill Road.

Following the Battle of Williamsburg on May 5, 1862, during the Peninsula Campaign, with 3,800 Confederate and Union casualties, Williamsburg and the College of William and Mary were occupied by the Union Army. The Brafferton building of the college was used for a time as quarters for the commanding officer of the Union garrison occupying the town. On September 9, 1862, drunken soldiers of the 5th Pennsylvania Cavalry set fire to the college building, purportedly in an attempt to prevent Confederate snipers from using it for cover. Much damage was done to the community during the Union occupation, which lasted until September 1865. 
After the Battle of Williamsburg, Ewell left the 32nd Virginia Infantry to join the staff of General Joseph E. Johnston. He was later adjutant to his younger brother, General Richard S. Ewell, who was a senior commander under Stonewall Jackson and Robert E. Lee.

==Post-war: Restoration of the College of William and Mary==

After the war, the college and its building lay in ruins, and the Virginia economy was destitute. Ewell had opposed Virginia&#x27;s secession from the Union in 1861. He went to Washington, D.C., and unsuccessfully sought reparations from the U.S. Congress, speaking there several times in an attempt to gain appropriations for the college for the damages done during the War. Some payment was finally made by the U.S. Government, but not until 1893.

In 1869, Ewell finally re-opened the school with his own personal funds and became president of the College of William and Mary again. He mortgaged his family farm, purchased nearby in 1858, and it was lost to a foreclosure and auction sale. Despite Ewell&#x27;s efforts, the college was forced to close again for financial reasons in 1881 did not reopen until 1888.

It has become legendary at the college and in the Williamsburg community that, every single morning of that long seven-year period, Benjamin Stoddert Ewell would arise and ring the bell calling students to class, so it could never be said that William and Mary had abandoned its mission to educate the young men of Virginia.

In 1888, William &amp; Mary resumed operations under a substitute charter when the Virginia General Assembly passed a bill appropriating $10,000 to support the college as a state teacher-training institution. Once he had ensured that the college he had cherished and protected would survive, the 71-year-old Ewell relinquished the presidency and went into retirement. Lyon Gardiner Tyler (son of US President and alumnus John Tyler) became the 17th president of the college following President Ewell&#x27;s retirement.

Benjamin Ewell remained in Williamsburg as president emeritus of the college until his death on June 19, 1894. He was interred in the College of William and Mary Cemetery in Williamsburg. Both his personal papers and papers relating to his service as president of the College of William and Mary can be found at the Special Collections Research Center at the College of William and Mary.

==Legacy==

* The unincorporated community of Ewell in James City County and Ewell Station located along the Peninsula Extension of the Chesapeake and Ohio Railway (C&amp;O) which was built through the area in 1881 by Collis P. Huntington, were named for him.
* Ewell Hall, the historic plantation house he built at the former Ewell Farm eventually became the restored centerpiece of a cemetery, Williamsburg Memorial Park, between Williamsburg and Lightfoot in James City County.
* Ewell Hall on the Old Campus of the College of William and Mary is named for him.
* In 1987, the Student Association of the College of William and Mary established an award in his honor.

<text>KIRO (710 kHz &quot;Seattle Sports&quot;) is a commercial AM radio station in Seattle, Washington, owned by Salt Lake City–based Bonneville International. The station airs a sports radio format and is an ESPN Radio Network affiliate. The station&#x27;s studios and offices are located on Eastlake Avenue in Seattle&#x27;s Eastlake district.

KIRO is a Class A clear channel station. It broadcasts at the maximum power for U.S. AM radio stations, 50,000 watts. By day, it uses a non-directional antenna. To protect the other Class A station on AM 710, WOR in New York City, and the previously allocated Class B station on 710, KSPN in Los Angeles, KIRO must use a directional antenna at night, thereby protecting those two stations. The transmitter is off Dockton Road SW on Vashon Island. KIRO is Washington State&#x27;s primary entry point station in the Emergency Alert System.

==History==
===650 KPCB (1927 to 1937)===
The station began broadcasting on April 27, 1927, as KPCB on 650 kilocycles. Its founder was Moritz Thomsen of the Pacific Coast Biscuit Company (hence the call sign KPCB) and it was powered at 100 watts. Among its announcers was Chet Huntley, later of television&#x27;s Huntley-Brinkley Report. In 1935, Saul Haas&#x27;s Queen City Broadcasting Company took over the station. Queen City increased the power to 500 watts. Haas, who was well connected in liberal politics and the business community, wanted a simple, pronounceable, and recognizable call sign for his new station. He chose KIRO, which is usually pronounced like the capital of Egypt, &quot;Cairo&quot;, not like the Illinois city.

===710 KIRO (1937 to 1960)===
In 1937, KIRO was assigned the AM 710 frequency and was granted an increase in power to 1,000 watts. Soon after, KIRO acquired the Seattle CBS Radio Network affiliation rights from KOL. Known as &quot;The Friendly Station,&quot; KIRO personalities broke from the formal announcing style that was commonplace during the early days of radio. KIRO carried CBS&#x27;s dramas, comedies, news, sports, soap operas, game shows and big band broadcasts during the &quot;Golden Age of Radio&quot;.

On June 29, 1941, a new, 50,000-watt transmitter on Maury Island became operational. From the 1930s through the 1950s, KIRO recorded countless hours of CBS programming for time-delayed rebroadcast to its Pacific Time Zone listeners. These electrical transcriptions are, in many cases, the only recordings made of World War II-era news coverage over the CBS Network. The discs were donated to the University of Washington in the early 1960s and are now held at the National Archives as the Milo Ryan Phonoarchive Collection.

In 1948, the original KIRO-FM went on the air at 100.7 MHz. It initially simulcast its AM sister&#x27;s programming but in the 1960s it became a beautiful music outlet. In 1975, it changed its call letters to KSEA and today is KKWF. Preparing for a future television allocation, KIRO moved in 1952 from downtown studios to a larger building on Queen Anne Hill. This peak was already home to the KING-TV transmitter and would soon be the site for KOMO-TV as well. Queen City Broadcasting was awarded Seattle&#x27;s last remaining VHF TV license in 1958, and signed on as CBS affiliate KIRO-TV on February 8. Aside from a short two-and-a-half year period from 1995 to 1997 when it served as a UPN station, KIRO-TV has served as Seattle&#x27;s CBS television affiliate since.

===1960 to 1980===
Haas sold KIRO to The Deseret News Publishing Company, part of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, in 1963. He earned a handsome return on his investment 28 years earlier. When the LDS Church reorganized its broadcasting properties as Bonneville International Corporation, Haas joined Bonneville&#x27;s board. Bonneville executives Lloyd Cooney and Ken Hatch arrived in Seattle to lead KIRO-AM-FM-TV, in 1964. Like many network radio affiliates following the demise of full-time block programming, KIRO spent the 1960s playing middle of the road music in addition to long-form news and interview shows.

Morning host Jim French spent several years broadcasting from the rotating restaurant atop the Space Needle and was live on the air from that perch during a 6.7-magnitude earthquake in April 1965. Bonneville moved its Seattle radio and TV stations to the newly constructed &quot;Broadcast House&quot; at Third and Broad Streets in 1968.

In 1973, KIRO ended a 35-year affiliation with CBS and switched to the Mutual Broadcasting System. Around this time, KIRO also picked up Herb Jepko&#x27;s &quot;Nitecap,&quot; a groundbreaking overnight telephone-talk show from Salt Lake City sister station KSL, a 50,000-watt &quot;flamethrower&quot; like KIRO.

&quot;Newsradio 71 KIRO&quot; debuted on July 15, 1974, with news and talk segments replacing most music programming. In September 1974, KIRO switched affiliations again from Mutual, becoming an NBC Radio Network affiliate, but switched back to CBS in November 1976.

===1980 to 2008===
In 1980, Lloyd Cooney left KIRO to run for the United States Senate. Ken Hatch became president, CEO and chairman, a position he held until 1995. Under Hatch&#x27;s leadership, KIRO Inc. acquired KING AM, KING-FM, and Third Avenue Productions. KIRO, Inc. became one of the nation&#x27;s premier regional broadcast groups, and was led by general manager Joe Abel during this period.

KIRO was a full service adult contemporary radio station by the mid 1970s, playing music during the day, talk in the evenings, and more music intensive on weekends with exception of times when sporting events were broadcast. By 1980, the station played music during the day with talk heard night and overnights. The station added talk middays during the week in 1985. By then amounts of music during drive times were down to about 4 songs an hour and during the day, with weekends playing 12 songs an hour. In 1986, KIRO was reclassified as a news and talk station, adding more news programming and dropping music altogether.

In 1993, Bonneville attempted to merge the staff of KIRO radio with that of then-sister station KIRO-TV in an attempt at synergy (the staffs merged in June 1992, with KIRO radio&#x27;s general manager and news director Andy Ludlum at the helm). Dubbed the &quot;KIRO News Network&quot;, this meant that KIRO-TV anchors and reporters would be heard on the radio, while KIRO radio personalities would be seen during KIRO-TV newscasts; during this period, KIRO&#x27;s radio programming originated from a massive newsroom especially constructed for what was called &quot;News Outside the Box&quot;, sharing space with their TV co-workers. Local independent station KTZZ (currently KZJO) simulcast KIRO radio in the mornings with cameras mounted in-studio showing the KIRO staffers on-screen during this time. The effort was a failure and was scrapped completely by September of that year.

For 25 years, KIRO&#x27;s morning news, anchored by Bill Yeend, consistently placed at or near the top of the Seattle Arbitron ratings. Gregg Hersholt was the station&#x27;s morning news anchor for the next 10 years until he left the station on May 28, 2010, ending his 26-year career there. Dave Ross now hosts Seattle&#x27;s Morning News.

===Sports broadcasts===
Sports play-by-play has been a staple of the KIRO schedule throughout its history. Since the team&#x27;s inception in 1976, KIRO has been the flagship radio station for the NFL Seattle Seahawks. About that same time, it was also the flagship station for the Seattle Sounders of the North American Soccer League. From 1985 to 2002, and again since 2009, the station airs Seattle Mariners games. From 1978 to 1987, KIRO was the flagship station of the Seattle SuperSonics. Additionally, KIRO has carried Washington Huskies and Washington State Cougars college football for stints during the &#x27;80s and &#x27;90s.

KIRO was also the radio home to popular sportscaster Wayne Cody, who did live sideline reports during Seattle Seahawks football games, Washington Huskies college football play-by-play, NASL Seattle Sounders pro soccer play-by-play, and hosted a sports radio talk show weeknights that was the only one of its kind at the time in Seattle. In January 2020, KIRO announced it would serve as the flagship station for the Seattle Dragons of the XFL; the wording of the press release made it ambiguous as to whether or not they would carry live games.

===Dave Ross===
Dave Ross joined KIRO as a reporter from Atlanta station WSB in 1978 and took over as noon to 3 p.m. talk host in 1987. He moved to the 9 a.m. to noon time slot after the retirement of Jim French in 1992. Ross unsuccessfully ran for Washington&#x27;s eighth Congressional district as a Democratic candidate in 2004. While Ross unofficially announced his candidacy in May, he did not leave his on-air position until just prior to the July filing deadline. In response to complaints from state Republican party officials, Ross claimed that he was contractually bound to continue working for KIRO until he formally filed to become a candidate.

Ross returned to the air immediately following the November election. He was moved to the afternoon drive-time shift in February 2005. Ross moved back to his 9am-noon shift in May 2006. Since January 2012, Ross has hosted Seattle&#x27;s Morning News from 5-9 a.m. In addition to his KIRO work, Ross does a daily commentary on the CBS Radio Network and is also substituted for Charles Osgood on CBS Radio&#x27;s &quot;Osgood File&quot; segments.
After selling KIRO-TV to the A.H. Belo Corp. in 1995, Bonneville&#x27;s Seattle radio stations moved to facilities on Eastlake Avenue. KIRO (AM), KIRO-FM (now KKWF) and KNWX (now KTTH) were sold to Entercom Communications of Bala Cynwyd, Pennsylvania, in 1997. Bonneville reacquired KIRO, KTTH, and KBSG (now KIRO-FM) from Entercom in 2007.

===Talk on FM, sports on AM===

On August 12, 2008, KIRO began simulcasting its programming on sister station KBSG-FM, which dropped its long-running classic hits format. This began the transition of KIRO Newsradio from AM to FM. To complete the transition, KIRO AM switched to a sports radio format, as &quot;710 ESPN Seattle,&quot; on April 1, 2009. It regained the rights to broadcast Seattle Mariners games, beginning in the 2009 season. KIRO also simulcasts the Seattle Seahawks games with KIRO-FM, and has extensive team-related programming throughout the year. KIRO-FM continues the news/talk format. In addition, 710 ESPN Seattle is the play-by-play home for the Washington State Cougars college football and basketball broadcasts.

Mike Salk was named Program Director of 710 ESPN Seattle on March 13, 2014, returning to the station after a stint in Boston. Before leaving for Boston, Salk had been a co-host on the station.

On March 7, 2022, KIRO rebranded as &quot;Seattle Sports&quot;. The rebranding, which coincided with rival KJR moving its programming to FM station KUBE, was not accompanied by any programming changes.

<text>Simon Winchester (born 28 September 1944) is a British-American author and journalist. In his career at &quot;The Guardian&quot; newspaper, Winchester covered numerous significant events, including Bloody Sunday and the Watergate Scandal. Winchester has written or contributed to over 30 best-selling nonfiction books, one novel, and several magazines, among them &quot;Condé Nast Traveler&quot;, &quot;Smithsonian Magazine&quot;, and &quot;National Geographic&quot;.

==Early life and education==
Born in London, Winchester attended several boarding schools in Dorset, including Hardye&#x27;s School. He spent a year hitchhiking around the United States, then in 1963 went up to St Catherine&#x27;s College, Oxford, to study geology. He graduated in 1966, and found work with Falconbridge of Africa, a Canadian mining company. His first assignment was to work as a field geologist searching for copper deposits in Uganda.

==Career==
While on assignment in Uganda, Winchester happened upon a copy of James Morris&#x27; &quot;Coronation Everest&quot;, an account of the 1953 expedition that led to the first successful ascent of Mount Everest. The book instilled in Winchester the desire to be a writer, so he wrote to Morris, seeking career advice. Morris urged Winchester to give up geology the very day he received the letter, and get a job as a writer on a newspaper.

In 1969 Winchester joined &quot;The Guardian&quot;, first as a regional correspondent based in Newcastle upon Tyne, but later as its Northern Ireland correspondent. Winchester&#x27;s time in Northern Ireland placed him around several events of The Troubles, including the events of Bloody Sunday and the Belfast &quot;Hour of Terror&quot;. In 1971, Winchester became involved in a controversy over the British press&#x27;s coverage of Northern Ireland on the floor of the House of Commons when Bernadette Devlin described his role in reporting the shooting to death by British soldiers of Barney Watt in Hooker Street in the morning of Saturday, 6 February 1971.

After leaving Northern Ireland in 1972, Winchester was briefly assigned to Calcutta before becoming correspondent for &quot;The Guardian&quot; in Washington, DC, where he covered news ranging from the end of Richard Nixon&#x27;s administration to the start of Jimmy Carter&#x27;s presidency.

In 1982, while working as chief foreign feature writer for &quot;The Sunday Times&quot;, Winchester was on location for the invasion of the Falkland Islands by Argentine forces. Suspected of being a spy, Winchester was held for three months as a prisoner in Ushuaia, Tierra del Fuego. He wrote about this event in his book, &quot;Prison Diary&quot;, published in 1983 and also in &quot;&quot;, published in 1985 as well as &quot;&quot; published in 2010, in which he tells of meeting up with one of his jailers many years later. In 1985, he shifted to working as a freelance writer and travelled to Hong Kong. When Condé Nast re-branded &quot;Signature&quot; magazine as &quot;Condé Nast Traveler&quot;, Winchester was appointed its Asia-Pacific Editor. Over the following fifteen years he contributed to a number of travel publications including &quot;Traveler&quot;, &quot;National Geographic&quot; and &quot;Smithsonian&quot; magazine.

Winchester&#x27;s first book, &quot;In Holy Terror&quot;, was published by Faber and Faber in 1975. The book drew heavily on his experiences of the turmoil in Northern Ireland. In 1976 he published his second book, &quot;American Heartbeat&quot;, which deals with his travels through the American heartland. Winchester&#x27;s first truly successful book was &quot;The Professor and the Madman&quot; (1998) published by Penguin UK as &quot;The Surgeon of Crowthorne&quot;. Telling the story of the creation of the &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot;, the book was a New York Times Best Seller.

Though he still writes travel books, Winchester has used the narrative non-fiction form he adopted for &quot;The Professor and the Madman&quot; several more times, resulting in multiple best-selling books. &quot;The Map that Changed the World&quot; (2001) focuses on the geologist William Smith and was Winchester&#x27;s second &quot;New York Times&quot; best seller. The year 2003 saw the publication of &quot;The Meaning of Everything&quot;, which returns to the topic of the creation of the &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot;, and of the best-selling &quot;&quot;. Winchester then published &quot;A Crack in the Edge of the World&quot;, a book about San Francisco&#x27;s 1906 earthquake. &quot;The Man Who Loved China&quot; (2008) retells the life of the scholar Joseph Needham.&quot;The Alice Behind Wonderland&quot;, an exploration of the life and work of Charles Lutwidge Dodgson (Lewis Carroll), and his relationship with Alice Liddell, was published in 2011.

Winchester&#x27;s book on the Pacific Ocean, &quot;&quot;, was published in 2015. It was his second book about the Pacific region, his first, &quot;Pacific Rising: The Emergence of a New World Culture&quot; having been published in 1991. Before this, in the mid-1980s, Winchester managed to set foot on the secretive island of Diego Garcia (which is the largest island of the Chagos Archipelago in the British Indian Ocean Territory). Winchester pretended that his boat had run into trouble next to the island, and remained in the bay for about two days. He managed to step on shore briefly before being escorted away, and was told by British authorities: “Go away and don’t come back.”

==Personal life==
On 4 July 2011 Winchester was naturalized as an American citizen in a ceremony aboard the USS &quot;Constitution&quot;. Winchester lives in Berkshire County, Massachusetts. He is the founder, editor and reporter of the Sandisfield Times, a hyper-local newspaper focused on issues in the small Berkshires town.

<text>Sergey Petrovich Botkin (; 5 September 1832 – 12 December 1889) was a Russian clinician, therapist, and activist, one of the founders of modern Russian medical science and education. He introduced triage, pathological anatomy, and post mortem diagnostics into Russian medical practice.

== Life and career ==
Botkin was born on 5 September 1832, in Moscow to a family of famous Russian tea tradesmen, and the son of Anna Ivanovna (Postnikova) and Petr Kononovich Botkin. He made his first steps towards education in the private school of Ennes. In 1850 Botkin was admitted to Moscow State University. In 1855 Sergey Botkin graduated from the university with honors and received a Doctor of Medicine degree. Shortly afterwards however he was mobilized as a conscript, designated to serve as military surgeon and sent straight to Sevastopol, where the Crimean War was in full swing. There Botkin worked under the guidance of Nikolay Pirogov, widely recognized as a pioneer of field surgery (i.e. the treatment of wounded combatants on the spot and in spite of ongoing hostilities as the situation may warrant). Pirogov is known for performing the first operation under anesthesia on the battlefield at the time. Upon the end of his military service, Botkin received a flattering review from his supervisor.

He subsequently went abroad, seeking to improve his skills and was able to gain valuable professional experience working at some of the most prestigious institutions on the continent. Upon his return to Russia, Botkin was invited to work with professor Shipulinsky in the Academy of Medicine and Surgery, and the following year Botkin took Shipulinsky’s position at the age of 29.

In 1860–1861, Sergey Botkin opened a clinical and research laboratory and in the course of his research organized systematic studies in clinical pharmacology and experimental therapy, both novelties in Russian research at the time. He was the first to suggest that catarrhal jaundice (hepatitis) was caused by an infection. In early 1860s, Botkin was assigned as an advising member of the medical board of the Imperial Ministry of Internal Affairs. In 1873 he was also made Head Surgeon to the Emperor, having been among the court physicians for Tsars Alexander II and Alexander III. Furthermore, the same year he was elected president of the Medical Association of St. Petersburg. In 1886, Botkin headed the National Public Health Commission, created to investigate the unusually high mortality rates prevalent in Russia, both in times of peace and war. Botkin Hospital is named after him.

== Family ==
Botkin was married to A.A. Krylova, relative of Alexey Krylov. His brother Vasily was a prominent writer and his brother Mikhail was a painter and well-known art collector. His son, Dr. Eugene Botkin, was murdered with Nicholas II and the Tsar&#x27;s family on 16/17 July 1918 by the Bolsheviks.

Sergey Petrovich Botkin died on 12 December 1889, in Menton, France, from liver disease, which was complicated by a heart ailment.

She won 10,000 metres titles at the 1992 Barcelona and 2000 Sydney Olympics, and a bronze in the event at the 2004 Athens Olympics. At the World Championships in Athletics, Derartu took silver in the 10,000 m in 1995, and a gold in 2001. She was a three-time IAAF World Cross Country champion (1995, 1997, 2000).

She has been serving as President of Ethiopian Athletics Federation since 2018.

Derartu comes from a sporting family of several Olympic medalists, which include her cousins Tirunesh, Genzebe and Ejegayehu Dibaba.

==Life and career==
Derartu Tulu grew up tending cattle in the village of Bekoji in the highlands of Arsi Province, the same village as Kenenisa Bekele. She is the aunt of Ejegayehu Dibaba, Tirunesh Dibaba and Genzebe Dibaba.

Derartu is the first Ethiopian woman and the first black African woman to win an Olympic gold medal, which she won in the 10,000 m event at the 1992 Barcelona Olympic Games. The race, where she and Elana Meyer (South Africa) raced for lap after lap way ahead of the rest of the field, launched her career. She sat out 1993 and 1994 with a knee injury and returned to competition in the 1995 IAAF World Cross Country Championships where she won gold, having arrived at the race only an hour before the start. She was stuck in Athens airport without sleep for 24 hours. The same year she lost out to Fernanda Ribeiro and won silver at the World Championships 10,000.

The 1996 season was a difficult year for her. At the IAAF World Cross Country Championships Derartu lost her shoe in the race and had to fight back to get fourth place. She also finished fourth at the Olympic Games, where she was nursing an injury. In 1997 she won the world cross country title for the second time, but did not factor in the 10,000 m World Championships. In 1998 she gave birth to a daughter, Tsion, but came back in 2000 in the best shape of her life. She won the 10,000 m Olympic gold for the second time (the only woman to have done this in the short history of the event). She also won the IAAF World Cross Country Championships title for the third time. In 2001, she finally won her world 10,000 track title in Edmonton. This was her third world or Olympic gold medal. She has a total of 5 world and Olympic medals.

Her transition to the marathon was rewarded with victories in London and Tokyo Marathons in 2001. She finished fourth at the 2005 World Championships, setting her personal best time of 2:23:30. She also won the Portugal Half Marathon in 2000 and 2003, and Lisbon Half Marathon in 2003. In 2009, at the age of 37, she won the New York City Marathon, defeating of the likes of Paula Radcliffe, Lyudmila Petrova and Salina Kosgei.

In 2004 Derartu declined to enter the New York Marathon, where she would have been likely to face marathon World Record holder Paula Radcliffe, whom she has had a great rivalry with over the years, and focused instead on the Olympic Games, where she won the bronze medal in the 10,000 m behind Xing Huina and her cousin Ejegayehu Dibaba. (Radcliffe failed to finish.)

Derartu continued to run competitively in her late thirties, while most of her old rivals retired. Her last marathon finish came in 2011 in Yokohama.

She is remembered for her speed and her 60.3 second-last lap at the end of the 10,000 m at the Sydney Olympics was a sprint of note.

<doc id="780703" wikidata="Q7430792" url="?curid=780703" title="Scenes of crime officer">
<text>A scenes of crime officer (SOCO) is an officer who gathers forensic evidence for the British police. They are also referred to by some forces as forensic scene investigators (FSIs), crime scene investigators (CSIs) (although their job differs from that depicted in the ), or crime scene examiners (CSEs). SOCOs are usually not police officers, but are employed by the police forces. Evidence collected is passed to the detectives of the Criminal Investigation Department and to the forensic laboratories. The SOCOs do not investigate crimes or analyse evidence themselves. To be a SOCO, at least 5 GCSEs at Grade level 9 - 4 are required.

==History==
SOCOs were first introduced into the Metropolitan Police in 1968, replacing the CID officers who had previously carried out these functions. Some other forces had introduced them before that time, however.

Other police forces around the United Kingdom continued this trend of replacing the CID officers with civilians. This allowed the creation of dedicated departments within the police forces. Police officers often moved post after only a few years; the introduction of civilian scenes of crime officers allowed departments to build a resource based on experience.

==Training==

Today, the majority of police forces use a central training resource for the initial and development needs of their SOCOs. With the introduction of forensic science degrees at university level, the standard of candidates for employment is increasing. Once in post, trainee SOCOs attend a nine-week residential training course. During this course, a prospective SOCO will learn about fingerprint recovery techniques, DNA retrieval, photography, road traffic collisions (RTCs), and trace evidence, amongst other areas of knowledge. Upon the successful conclusion of this course, SOCOs are then invited to further their knowledge by undertaking a two-year diploma. SOCOs are expected to demonstrate a high level of further learning by liaising with colleagues, peers and other services within the law enforcement sector. This is demonstrated by submitting six dissertations discussing specialist forensic areas or elaborating on existing techniques or equipment.

In 2001, the Council for the Registration of Forensic Practitioners (CRFP) was created. This was in response to the lack of regulation within the world of forensic science. Whilst registration is not compulsory, SOCOs are encouraged to apply for registration. The registration process involves the applicant submitting case studies on crime scenes they have examined. These are then subjected to their peers, who assess the applicant&#x27;s work based on best practise. The introduction of the CRFP is aiming to raise the standard of practise and credibility within the forensic departments who work alongside law enforcement agencies.

In 2009, the Forensic Science Regulator argued that the CRFP was surplus to requirements, and consequently the CRFP closed its doors on 31 March 2009. At an Extraordinary General Meeting the Board of the CRFP decided the organisation could no longer fulfil its objects and therefore resolved that the company should cease trading. The key factors in this were given as:
1. the decision of the Chief Executive of the National Policing Improvement Agency communicated in a letter of 4 February 2009 that he was “not currently prepared to authorise the release of any money to the CRFP for the 2009/2010 financial year”
2. the circular letter to all chief constables issued by the Association of Chief Police Officers Forensics Portfolio holder and the Chief Executive of the National Policing Improvement Agency dated 6 January 2009 strongly encouraging police forces “to review their future commitment to CRFP registration and the financial commitment that this requires” and
3. the consequent decision of the Metropolitan Police Service, communicated in a letter dated 2 February 2009, that “the MPS from 1 April 2009 will cease to fund subscription of MPS staff that wish to register for CRFP and will remove CRFP registration as a condition for pay progression” and
4. the decision of the Home Office, communicated in a letter dated 31 February 2009, that they “can see no basis to commit the further £175,000 of public money requested by the CRFP”.

Entrance requirements vary between individual forces - most expect candidates to possess at least good GCSEs or A levels. Good photographic ability is essential and a qualification in photography can prove advantageous. Possession of a physics or forensic science-related qualification at any level can also be helpful.

==Operations==

SOCOs examine crime scenes ranging from criminal damage to burglary to homicide, although the forensic science provider for the particular police force in question will often be called in to deal with the more complex forensic opportunities that arise during homicide investigations.

The average day for a SOCO involves dealing with victims of crime amongst members of the public, photographing injuries to victims of assault, and examining crime scenes. Most police forces operate an &quot;on call&quot; system. This means that out of office hours are still covered by a SOCO. Most departments cover the hours between 7am and 10pm, with one SOCO &quot;on call&quot; from 10pm to 7am. This SOCO deals with crime scenes that cannot be preserved for the following day.

==Australia==
The New South Wales Police Force in Australia uses police and civilian scenes of crime officers (SOCOs) in a similar manner to their British counterparts. SOCOs are part of the Forensic Services Group.

Generally SOCOs are limited in the types of tasks they can handle due to their training and scope in which they operate. Major incidents and more serious offences/investigations are handled by full-time sworn officers and specialists from the Forensic Services Group.

<text>John James Exon (August 9, 1921June 10, 2005) was an American businessman and politician who served as the 33rd Governor of Nebraska from 1971 to 1979, and as a U.S. Senator from Nebraska from 1979 to 1997. A member of the Democratic Party, Exon never lost an election, and was the only Democrat ever to hold Nebraska&#x27;s Class 2 U.S. Senate seat. He was elected governor in 1970, re-elected in 1974, elected to the Senate in 1978, and re-elected to that seat in 1984 and 1990.

==Early career==
Exon was born in Geddes, South Dakota, on August 9, 1921, and grew up in Lake Andes, South Dakota. His grandfather founded the Democratic Party of South Dakota. He moved to Nebraska in 1939 to attend the University of Omaha (now University of Nebraska Omaha) between 1939 and 1941. Exon joined the United States Army Signal Corps in 1942, and served two years overseas in New Guinea, the Philippines and Japan during World War II. He was honorably discharged as a Master Sergeant in December 1945 and served in the Army Reserve until 1949.

After the war, he returned to Nebraska and worked as the branch manager of a financial services institution in Fremont. He founded Exon Office Supplies (later Exon&#x27;s Inc.) in Lincoln in 1953 and served as its president until 1971. In 1972, when Esso (Standard Oil Company of New Jersey) changed its name to Exxon, the Secretary of State of Nebraska, Allen J. Beermann, declined to register the name due to the existence of Exon&#x27;s Inc. Exon later claimed that he received an unspecified settlement from Exxon in exchange for renaming his business the J.J. Exon Company.

He started his political career as a precinct worker for the Democrats. In 1964, he was a delegate to the Democratic National Convention for Nebraska and served as a delegate for that state in every convention between 1972 and 2004. He served as a member of the Nebraska Democratic State Central Committee between 1964 and 1968 and was a member of the Democratic National Committee from 1968 to 1970. Exon was Chair of the Nebraska Democratic Party in 1970 when he decided to run for governor.

==Governor of Nebraska (1971–1979)==
Exon&#x27;s first bid for public office was his successful campaign for Governor of Nebraska, defeating incumbent Republican Norbert Tiemann. The term of the governor had been extended to four years beginning with Tiemann&#x27;s win in 1966. Exon was re-elected in a landslide in 1974, becoming the first person to serve eight years as Nebraska Governor.

His repeated vetoes of the legislature&#x27;s spending programs earned Exon the reputation as a fiscal conservative. He vetoed 141 bills in his final seven years as governor or an average of 20 a year.

Exon was opposed to gay rights. As a candidate for governor, he voiced his opposition to a &#x27;homophile studies&#x27; class at the University of Nebraska–Lincoln, taught by Louis Crompton. As governor, Exon vetoed the legalization of gay sex in 1977, expressing opposition to &quot;perverts, homos, and gays.&quot; The legislature overrode his veto, and Nebraska became among the first states to legalize same-sex intercourse.

==Senate career (1979–1997)==

Exon&#x27;s popularity as governor carried over to his 1978 campaign for the U.S. Senate, and he was elected with 68 percent of the vote. He had a reputation as a moderate Democrat, often working with Republicans on fiscal and military issues. While serving on the U.S. Senate Committee on Armed Services, Exon was a strong defender of the B-2 stealth bomber.

On October 19, 1983, Exon was one of four Democratic senators to vote against a bill establishing Martin Luther King, Jr. Day. The legislation was signed into law by President Ronald Reagan the following month.

In 1984, Exon had the closest election in his political career, eventually winning re-election by 25,000 votes. He was re-elected again in 1990.

He helped sponsor the Exon-Florio Amendment, which prevented takeovers or mergers by foreign companies of U.S. companies, if said merger was found to be a threat to national security.

In 1988, Exon took 10 vacations paid for by lobbying groups.

In October 1991, he was one of eight Democrats who voted to confirm Clarence Thomas to the Supreme Court in a 52-48 vote.

Exon helped to write and secure support for a spending reduction in the U.S. budget of $14 billion in 1994, which he stated was his proudest political achievement. His Communications Decency Act of 1996 was Congress&#x27; first effort to try to regulate content on the Internet with the goal of preventing access or transmission of pornography on the internet. It was later overturned by a unanimous U.S. Supreme Court as an unconstitutional infringement of the First Amendment.

==Final years and death==
After his retirement, Exon served on a Committee established by Congress and led by John M. Deutch on the threat of weapons of mass destruction. In the report, Exon warned of the dangers if such weapons fell into the hands of terrorists and recommended the formation of an agency with a similar role to the Department of Homeland Security.

He was treated for cancer in the last years of his life, although he claimed in 2003 that it wasn&#x27;t &quot;highly malignant&quot;. Exon died of natural causes at Madonna Rehabilitation Hospital in Lincoln, Nebraska on June 10, 2005. He was the first person to lie in state for public viewing in the rotunda of the State Capitol building.

<text>Hereward Thimbleby Price (23 April 1880 – 11 May 1964) was an English author and professor of English at the University of Michigan.

Price was born 23 April 1880 in the town of Ambatolahinandrianisiahana, Madagascar as a son of Mary Anne &quot;Polly&quot; Thimbleby and Charles Thomas Price (1847-1933), an English missionary. Returning to England, he was educated at various private schools, and in 1899 matriculated at the University of Oxford. During this time he also worked as an assistant in the creation of the Oxford English Dictionary. In 1904 he was appointed lecturer in English at the University of Bonn, where he wrote and published his thesis &quot;A history of ablaut in the strong verbs from Caxton to the end of the Elizabethan period&quot; (1910). In 1911, while living in Germany, Price married and became naturalized as a German citizen. Subsequently, he was drafted into the German army during World War I. He was captured by Russian soldiers, but escaped to China. In 1919 he wrote a book about his experiences called &quot;Boche and Bolshevik: Experiences of an Englishman in the German Army and in Russian Prisons&quot;.

After coming to America and gaining a professorship at the University of Michigan, he wrote many other books, including &quot;Foreign influences on Middle English&quot;, and &quot;Construction in Shakespeare&quot;. Price died in Washington, D.C., on 11 May 1964, age 84. He is buried in Forest Hill Cemetery, Ann Arbor, Michigan.

<text>In electronics, when describing a voltage or current step function, rise time is the time taken by a signal to change from a specified low value to a specified high value. These values may be expressed as ratios or, equivalently, as percentages with respect to a given reference value. In analog electronics and digital electronics, these percentages are commonly the 10% and 90% (or equivalently and ) of the output step height: however, other values are commonly used. For applications in control theory, according to , rise time is defined as &quot;the time required for the response to rise from to of its final value&quot;&quot;, with 0% to 100% rise time common for underdamped second order systems, 5% to 95% for critically damped and 10% to 90% for overdamped ones. According to , the term &quot;rise time&quot; applies to either positive or negative step response, even if a displayed negative excursion is popularly termed fall time.

==Overview==
Rise time is an analog parameter of fundamental importance in high speed electronics, since it is a measure of the ability of a circuit to respond to fast input signals. There have been many efforts to reduce the rise times of circuits, generators, and data measuring and transmission equipment. These reductions tend to stem from research on faster electron devices and from techniques of reduction in stray circuit parameters (mainly capacitances and inductances). For applications outside the realm of high speed electronics, long (compared to the attainable state of the art) rise times are sometimes desirable: examples are the dimming of a light, where a longer rise-time results, amongst other things, in a longer life for the bulb, or in the control of analog signals by digital ones by means of an analog switch, where a longer rise time means lower capacitive feedthrough, and thus lower coupling noise to the controlled analog signal lines.

===Factors affecting rise time===
For a given system output, its rise time depend both on the rise time of input signal and on the characteristics of the system.

For example, rise time values in a resistive circuit are primarily due to stray capacitance and inductance. Since every circuit has not only resistance, but also capacitance and inductance, a delay in voltage and/or current at the load is apparent until the steady state is reached. In a pure RC circuit, the output risetime (10% to 90%) is approximately equal to .

===Alternative definitions===
Other definitions of rise time, apart from the one given by the Federal Standard 1037C (1997, p. R-22) and its slight generalization given by , are occasionally used: these alternative definitions differ from the standard not only for the reference levels considered. For example, the time interval graphically corresponding to the intercept points of the tangent drawn through the 50% point of the step function response is occasionally used. Another definition, introduced by , uses concepts from statistics and probability theory. Considering a step response , he redefines the delay time as the first moment of its first derivative , i.e.

:formula_1

Finally, he defines the rise time by using the second moment

:formula_2

== Rise time of model systems ==

===Notation===
All notations and assumptions required for the analysis are listed here.

*Following , we define as the percentage low value and the percentage high value respect to a reference value of the signal whose rise time is to be estimated.
* is the time at which the output of the system under analysis is at the of the steady-state value, while the one at which it is at the , both measured in seconds.
* is the rise time of the analysed system, measured in seconds. By definition, formula_3

* is the damping ratio and is the natural frequency of a given second order system.

=== Simple examples of calculation of rise time ===
The aim of this section is the calculation of rise time of step response for some simple systems:

==== Gaussian response system ====
A system is said to have a &quot;Gaussian response&quot; if it is characterized by the following frequency response

:formula_8

where is a constant, related to the high cutoff frequency by the following relation:

:formula_9

Even if this kind frequency response is not realizable by a causal filter, its usefulness lies in the fact that behaviour of a cascade connection of first order low pass filters approaches the behaviour of this system more closely as the number of cascaded stages asymptotically rises to infinity. The corresponding impulse response can be calculated using the inverse Fourier transform of the shown frequency response

:formula_10

Applying directly the definition of step response,

:formula_11

To determine the 10% to 90% rise time of the system it is necessary to solve for time the two following equations:

:formula_12

By using known properties of the error function, the value is found: since ,

:formula_13

and finally

:formula_14

====One-stage low-pass RC network====
For a simple one-stage low-pass RC network, the 10% to 90% rise time is proportional to the network time constant :

:formula_15

The proportionality constant can be derived from the knowledge of the step response of the network to a unit step function input signal of amplitude:

:formula_16

Solving for time

:formula_17

and finally,

:formula_18

Since and are such that

:formula_19

solving these equations we find the analytical expression for and :

:formula_20

:formula_21

The rise time is therefore proportional to the time constant:

:formula_22

Now, noting that

:formula_23

then

:formula_24

and since the high frequency cutoff is equal to the bandwidth,

:formula_25

Finally note that, if the 20% to 80% rise time is considered instead, becomes:

:formula_26

====One-stage low-pass LR network====

Even for a simple one-stage low-pass RL network, the 10% to 90% rise time is proportional to the network time constant . The formal proof of this assertion proceed exactly as shown in the previous section: the only difference between the final expressions for the rise time is due to the difference in the expressions for the time constant of the two different circuits, leading in the present case to the following result

:formula_27

=== Rise time of damped second order systems ===

According to , for underdamped systems used in control theory rise time is commonly defined as the time for a waveform to go from 0% to 100% of its final value: accordingly, the rise time from 0 to 100% of an underdamped 2nd-order system has the following form:
:formula_28

The quadratic approximation for normalized rise time for a 2nd-order system, step response, no zeros is:
:formula_29
where is the damping ratio and is the natural frequency of the network.

=== Rise time of cascaded blocks ===

Consider a system composed by cascaded non interacting blocks, each having a rise time , , and no overshoot in their step response: suppose also that the input signal of the first block has a rise time whose value is . Afterwards, its output signal has a rise time equal to

:formula_30

According to , this result is a consequence of the central limit theorem and was proved by : however, a detailed analysis of the problem is presented by , who also credit as the first one to prove the previous formula on a somewhat rigorous basis.

<doc id="780740" wikidata="Q2572004" url="?curid=780740" title="1838 Mormon War">
<text>The 1838 Mormon War, also known as the Missouri Mormon War, was a conflict between Mormons (Latter Day Saints) and other residents of northwestern Missouri from August 6 to November 1, 1838.

Founded in upstate New York in 1830, the Latter Day Saint movement rapidly expanded in Missouri through organized migration. Mormons initially settled an outpost in Jackson County, but faced significant hostility and were violently evicted from the area in 1833. They later relocated to Caldwell, a county the state legislature organized for Mormon settlement in 1836 as a compromise for losses in Jackson County. Caldwell became the movement&#x27;s headquarters as Joseph Smith and the remaining Mormon leadership relocated to Missouri in early 1838.

The rapid growth of the Mormon population upset local residents, and tensions intensified as Mormons began to spill into surrounding counties. An election brawl in Gallatin, Daviess County, where Mormons were obstructed from voting, marked the onset of violence. Vigilance committees were formed to expell the Mormons, which, along with Mormons forming counter-groups, led to a series of skirmishes and raids throughout October. A militia was dispatched to restore the peace, but eventually defected to join the expulsion efforts.

Hostilities culminated with the Battle of Crooked River in late October, prompting Governor Lilburn Boggs to order state forces to remove the Mormons from the state. Bogg&#x27;s response to the conflict drew ample criticism, and the controversy significantly undermined his administration&#x27;s political effectiveness. 

The war resulted in the deaths of 22 people, and the displacement of approximately 10,000 Mormons, most of whom sought refuge in Illinois.

==Background==

=== Jackson County, 1831-1833 ===

In the early 1830s, an influx of members of the Church of Christ (Latter Day Saint), then headquartered in Kirtland, Ohio, began settling in Jackson County, Missouri. According to latter-day saint belief, Independence, Missouri and the surrounding area were to become the &quot;City of Zion&quot;, and church leadership in Missouri was directed to purchase land extensively in the area to be distributed to incoming members. This was intended to proceed in an orderly fashion, but wealthy members did not provide the money to buy enough land and poorer church members flocked to Zion. Jackson County residents disliked the impoverished, poorly educated people flooding into their environs. These new residents were originally from New England and the Ohio Valley and, unlike their southern neighbors, generally opposed slavery. 

Harassment against the latter-day saint settlers turned violent in 1833. In October 1833, vigilantes ransacked the latter-day saint storehouse in Independence, destroyed the printing press of the Mormon newspaper, &quot;The Evening and Morning Star&quot;, attacked their settlements on the outskirts of the city and eventually forcibly expelled them from Jackson County. These episodes of violence informed the patterns of conflict between the latter-day saints and other Missouri residents over the course of the Mormon War. The expelled latter-day saints sought refuge in the neighboring counties, especially in Clay County.

Lilburn Boggs, who would later be the Governor of Missouri during the 1838 war, was Lieutenant Governor and a Jackson County resident at the time. Mormon historian Richard Lloyd Anderson would later describe Boggs&#x27;s role in the early upheavals:
In 1833 Boggs passively saw community leaders and officials sign demands for latter-day saint withdrawal, and next force a gunbarrel contract to abandon the county before spring planting...anti-latter-day saint goals were reached in a few simple stages. Executive paralysis permitted terrorism, which forced latter-day saints to self-defense, which was immediately labeled as an &quot;insurrection&quot;, and was put down by the activated militia of the county. Once latter-day saints were disarmed, mounted squads visited latter-day saint settlements with threats and enough beatings and destruction of homes to force flight.

=== Caldwell Compromise, 1836 ===
Despite appeals and legal efforts, the non-latter-day saints in Jackson refused to allow the latter-day saints to return. Reimbursement for confiscated and damaged property was refused. In 1834, latter-day saints attempted to effect a return to Jackson County with a quasi-military expedition known as Zion&#x27;s Camp, but this effort also failed when the governor did not provide expected support. Recognizing the need for a more permanent solution, Alexander William Doniphan of the Missouri legislature proposed the creation of a new county specifically for latter-day saint settlement. In 1836, the Missouri legislature passed a law establishing Caldwell County, with Far West as its seat. Latter-day saints had already begun buying land in the proposed county, including areas that were carved off to become parts of Ray and Daviess Counties. The latter-day saints chose a site in the town of Far West to build their temple, which they called &quot;the house of the Lord.&quot;

This arrangement brought about a period of relative peace. According to an article in the Elders&#x27; Journal, a Latter Day Saint newspaper published in Far West: &quot;the Saints here are at perfect peace with all the surrounding inhabitants, and persecution is not so much as once named among them...&quot; John Corrill, one of the latter-day saint leaders, remembered:
Friendship began to be restored between (the latter-day saints) and their neighbors, the old prejudices were fast dying away, and they were doing well, until the summer of 1838

===Compromise breaks down, 1838===
In 1837, problems centered on the Kirtland Safety Society bank at the church&#x27;s headquarters in Kirtland, Ohio led to schism. The church relocated in January 1838 from Kirtland to Far West, Missouri, which became its new headquarters. Hundreds latter-day saint settlers from Kirtland and elsewhere poured into Missouri. They established new colonies outside of Caldwell County, including Adam-ondi-Ahman in Daviess County and De Witt in Carroll County.

In the eyes of many non-latter-day saint citizens (including Alexander Doniphan), these settlements outside of Caldwell County were a violation of the compromise. The latter-day saints felt that the compromise only excluded major settlements in Clay and Ray counties, as they already had substantial population centers, but the recently colonized Daviess and Carroll counties did not. The earlier settlers felt politically and economically threatened by the expanding latter-day saint communities outside of Caldwell County.

===Salt Sermon and Danites===

With the Kirtland-based presidency now in control of the Missouri church, a leadership struggle emerged between the Kirtland arrivals and the previously established Missouri church leadership. Many of the oldest and most prominent leaders of the church, including Oliver Cowdery (one of the Three Witnesses and the church&#x27;s original &quot;second elder&quot;), David Whitmer (another of the Three Witnesses and Stake President of the Missouri Church), John Whitmer, and William W. Phelps, were excommunicated on allegations of misusing church property and finance amid tense relations between them and Smith.

These &quot;dissenters&quot;, as they came to be called, owned a significant amount of land in Caldwell County, much of which they purchased when acting as agents of the church. Ownership became unclear and the dissenters threatened the church with lawsuits. The presidency responded by urging the dissenters to leave the county using strong words the dissenters interpreted as threats. In his famous Salt Sermon, Sidney Rigdon announced that the dissenters were as salt that had lost its savor and that it was the duty of the faithful to cast the dissenters out to be trodden beneath the feet of men.

At the same Sampson Avard led a group of latter-day saints to organize a vigilante body known as the Danites. They were named for the Israelite tribe of Dan which is described in Genesis 49:17 thus: &quot;Dan will be a snake by the roadside, a viper along the path, that bites the horse’s heels so that its rider tumbles backward.&quot; The group&#x27;s purposes included obeying the church presidency &quot;right or wrong&quot; and expelling the dissenters from Caldwell County. Two days after Rigdon&#x27;s Salt Sermon, 80 prominent latter-day saints, including Hyrum Smith, signed the so-called Danite Manifesto, which warned the dissenters to &quot;depart or a more fatal calamity shall befall you.&quot; On June 19, the dissenters and their families fled to neighboring counties where their complaints fanned anti-latter-day saint sentiment.

On July 4, Rigdon gave an oration characterized by latter-day saint historian Brigham Henry Roberts as a &quot;&#x27;Declaration of Independence&#x27; from all mobs and persecutions&quot;. The text of this speech was endorsed by Joseph Smith, who appeared at the event and participated in the raising of a liberty pole. In the speech, Rigdon declared that the Latter Day Saints would no longer be driven from their homes by persecution from without or dissension from within: &quot;and at mob that comes on us to disturb us, it shall be between us and them a war of extermination; for we will follow them until the last drop of their blood is spilled; or else they will have to exterminate us, for we will carry the seat of war to their own houses and their own families, and one party or the other shall be utterly destroyed&quot;.

==The Election Day Battle at Gallatin==

Newly-formed Daviess County, Missouri, held its first elections on August 6, 1838. William Peniston, a candidate for the state legislature, referred to the latter-day saints as &quot;horse-thieves and robbers&quot; and warned them not to vote in the election. Reminding Daviess County residents of the growing electoral power of that community, Peniston claimed in a speech made in Gallatin that if the Missourians &quot;suffer such men as these [latter-day saints] to vote, you will soon lose your suffrage.&quot; Around 200 non-latter-day saints gathered in Gallatin on election day to prevent them from voting.

When about thirty latter-day saints approached the polling place, a Missourian named Dick Weldon declared that in Clay County the latter-day saints had been allowed to vote &quot;no more than the negroes&quot;. One of the latter-day saints present, Samuel Brown, claimed that the statement was false and then declared his intention to vote. This triggered a brawl between the bystanders.

At the start of the brawl, latter-day saint John Butler let out a call, &quot;Oh yes, you Danites, here is a job for us!&quot; which rallied the latter-day saints and allowed them to drive off their opponents. The crowd dispersed and the latter-day saints returned to their homes. This skirmish is often cited as the first episode of serious violence of the Mormon War. Rumor among both parties held that the conflict resulted in casualties. However when Joseph Smith rode with volunteers to Daviess County to assess the situation, he discovered there was no truth to this.

Nonmembers of the church began to organize themselves into vigilance committees. When a rumor reached the latter-day saints that Judge Adam Black was gathering a mob near Millport, Joseph Smith sent Danite leaders Sampson Avrard, Cornelius Lott and Lyman Wight to his home. They surrounded it with one hundred armed men, including Smith&#x27;s cousin George A. Smith. They asked if this was true, demanding that he sign a document disavowing any connection to the vigilance committees. He refused but, after meeting with Smith, he wrote and signed a document stating that he &quot;is not attached to any mob, nor will attach himself to any such people, and so long as they [the latter-day saints] will not molest me, I will not molest them.&quot; The latter-day saints also visited Sheriff William Morgan and several other leading Daviess County citizens, forcing some of them to sign statements disavowing any ties to the vigilance committees as well.

At a meeting at Lyman Wight&#x27;s home between leading latter-day saints and non-latter-day saints, both sides agreed not to protect any law-breakers and to surrender all offenders to the authorities. With peace restored, Smith&#x27;s group returned to Caldwell County. Black later swore an affidavit before the justice of the peace in Daviess county attesting to the treatment and threats he received from George Smith the other church members. On September 7, Smith and Lyman Wight appeared before Judge Austin A. King to answer the charges. Three Danite leaders testified convincingly in their defence. George Robinson asserted that evidence of wrongdoing was insufficient. However Judge King ordered Smith and Wight to stand trial in order to pacify the mob.

==Latter-day saints expelled from De Witt==

In the spring of 1838, Henry Root, a non-latter-day saint and a major landowner in Carroll County, visited Far West and sold his plots in the mostly vacant town of De Witt to latter-day saints he had invited there. De Witt was strategically located near the confluence of the Grand and the Missouri Rivers. George M. Hinkle and John Murdock, members of the High Council at Far West, were sent to take possession of the town and to begin to colonize it.

On July 30, citizens of Carroll County met in Carrollton to discuss this. The question of whether or not latter-day saints should be allowed to settle in the county was placed on the August 6 ballot; a heavy majority favored expulsion of the latter-day saints. A committee sent to De Witt ordered the latter-day saints to leave. The latter-day saint leaders refused, citing their right as American citizens to settle where they pleased. Sentiment among the anti-latter-day saint segment of Carroll County&#x27;s population hardened, and some began to take up arms. On August 19, 1838, latter-day saint settler Smith Humphrey reported that 100 armed men led by Colonel William Claude Jones took him prisoner for two hours and threatened him and the rest of the latter-day saint community.

While latter-day saints were viewed as a fringe religious group, the sentiment reflected in the Southern Advocate questioned the legitimacy of the vigilante committees:
By what color of propriety a portion of the people of the State, can organize themselves into a body, independent of the civil power, and contravene the general laws of the land by preventing the free enjoyment of the right of citizenship to another portion of the people, we are at a loss to comprehend.

As tensions built in Daviess County, other counties began to respond to Carroll County&#x27;s request for assistance in expelling the latter-day saints from their midst. Citizens in Saline, Howard, Jackson, Chariton, Ray, and other nearby counties organized vigilance committees sympathetic to the Carroll County expulsion party. Some isolated latter-day saints in outlying areas also came under attack. In Livingston County, a group of armed men forced Asahel Lathrop from his home, where they held his family captive while they were sick. Lathrop wrote &quot;I was to leave my home my house was thronged with a company of armed men consisting of fourteen in number and they abusing my family in every form that in the shape of human could invent.&quot; After more than a week, a company of armed latter-day saints assisted Lathrop in rescuing his wife and two of his children (one had died while prisoner). Lathrop&#x27;s wife and remaining children died shortly after their rescue. On September 20, 1838, about one hundred fifty armed men rode into De Witt and demanded that the latter-day saints leave within ten days. Hinkle and other latter-day saint leaders informed the men that they would fight. They also sent a request for assistance to Governor Boggs, noting that the mob had threatened &quot;to exterminate them, without regard to age or sex&quot;.

On October 1, vigilantes burned the home and stables of Smith Humphrey. Later that day, the vigilantes sealed off the town. The besieged town resorted to butchering whatever loose livestock wandered into town in order to avoid starvation while waiting for the militia or the Governor to come to their aid. General Parks arrived with the Ray County militia on October 6, but his order to disperse was ignored. When his own troops threatened to join the attackers, Parks was forced to withdraw to Daviess County in hopes that the Governor would come to mediate. Parks wrote his superior, General David Rice Atchison, that &quot;a word from his Excellency would have more power to quell this affair than a regiment.&quot;

On October 9, A. C. Caldwell returned to De Witt with the Governor&#x27;s response: &quot;the quarrel was between the latter-day saints and the mob&quot; and they should fight it out. On October 11, latter-day saint leaders agreed to abandon the settlement and move to Caldwell County. On the first night of the march out of Carroll County two latter-day saint women died, one of exposure and the other, a woman named Jenson, in childbirth. Several children also became ill during the ordeal and died later.

==Daviess County expedition==
In an October 16 letter, General Atchison relayed to Governor Lilburn Boggs that General Parks reported that &quot;a portion of the men from Carroll County, with one piece of artillery, are on their march for Daviess County, where it is thought the same lawless game is to be played over, and the latter-day saints to be driven from that county and probably from Caldwell County.&quot; Atchison said further, &quot;I would respectfully suggest to your Excellency the propriety of a visit to the scene of excitement in person, or at all events, a strong proclamation&quot; as the only way to restore peace and the rule of law. Boggs, however, ignored this plea as events unravelled.

Meanwhile, a group of vigilantes from Clinton, Platte, and other counties began to harass latter-day saints in Daviess County, burning outlying homes and plundering property. Latter Day Saint refugees began to flee to Adam-ondi-Ahman for protection and shelter against the upcoming winter. As Joseph Smith, returned to Far West in Caldwell County from De Witt in Carroll County to the west General Doniphan informed him of the deteriorating situation. Doniphan already had raised troops to prevent fighting between latter-day saints and those opposed to them in Daviess County. On Sunday, October 14, a small company of state militia under the command of Colonel William A. Dunn of Clay County arrived in Far West. Dunn, acting on Doniphan&#x27;s orders, continued on to Adam-ondi-Ahman. Although he was sympathetic to the latter-day saints&#x27; plight, Doniphan reminded the Latter Day Saints that their Caldwell County militia, led by church member Colonel George M. Hinkle, could not legally enter Daviess County. He advised latter-day saints traveling there to go in small parties and unarmed. Ignoring this counsel, Elias Higbee, a latter-day saint judge in Caldwell County, called on the Caldwell militia to defend church members&#x27; settlements in neighboring Daviess County. They were joined by elements of the Danite vigilante organization.

On October 18, these two groups marched under arms in three groups to Daviess County. Lyman Wight attacked Millport, and David W. Patten attacked Gallatin, both of which had been evacuated before they arrived. Seymour Brunson attacked Grindstone Fork, driving the unarmed Missourians from their homes to make their way to neighboring counties. Having taken control of the Missourian settlements, the latter-day saints plundered the property and burned the stores and houses. The county seat, Gallatin, was reported to have been &quot;completely gutted&quot; – only one shoe store remained unscathed. Millport, Grindstone Fork and the smaller Missourian settlement of Splawn&#x27;s Ridge were also plundered and had some houses burned. The plundered goods were deposited in the Bishop&#x27;s storehouse at Diahman. During the days that followed, latter-day saint vigilantes under the direction of Lyman Wight drove Missourians who lived in outlying farms from their homes, which were similarly plundered and burned. According to one witness, &quot;We could stand in our door and see houses burning every night for over two weeks... the latter-day saints completely gutted Daviess County. There was scarcely a Missourian&#x27;s home left standing in the county. Nearly every one was burned.&quot;

The Missourians evicted from their homes were no better prepared than the latter-day saint refugees had been. After the stress of being expelled from Millport into the snow, Milford Donaho&#x27;s wife gave birth prematurely, and the child was severely injured during the birth. Even Missourians who had been friendly to the latter-day saints were not spared. Jacob Stollings, a Gallatin merchant, was reported to have been generous in selling to latter-day saints on credit, but his store was plundered and burned with the rest. Judge Josiah Morin and Samuel McBrier, both considered friendly to the latter-day saints, both fled Daviess County after being threatened. McBrier&#x27;s house was among those burned. When a latter-day saint band plundered and burned the Taylor home, one young latter-day saint, Benjamin F Johnson, argued his fellow vigilantes into leaving a horse for a pregnant Mrs Taylor and her children to ride to safety. Ironically, as a result of his kindness, he was the only latter-day saint who was positively identified to have participated in the home burnings. After several non-latter-day saints made statements to the authorities that Johnson had acted as a moderating influence on the Danites, he was allowed to escape rather than stand trial.

Many Latter Day Saints were greatly troubled by the occurrences. latter-day saint leader John Corrill wrote, &quot;the love of pillage grew upon them very fast, for they plundered every kind of property they could get a hold of.&quot; Some latter-day saints claimed that some of the Missourians burned their own homes in order to blame the latter-day saints. None of these claims, however, purport to be eyewitness accounts. These claims are contradicted by the majority of both Missourian and Latter Day Saint testimony and also by the evidence of the looted property found in the possession of Latter Day Saints. latter-day saint leader Parley P Pratt conceded that some burnings had been done by latter-day saints. LeSueur estimates that latter-day saints were responsible for the burning of fifty homes or shops and the displacement of one hundred non-latter-day saint families. Millport, which at time was the largest settlement in the county and the center for trade, never recovered from the latter-day saint burnings, and became a ghost town. Local citizens were outraged by the actions of the Danites and other latter-day saint bands. Several latter-day saint homes near Millport were burned and their inhabitants expelled into the snow. Agnes Smith, a sister-in-law of Joseph, was chased from her home with two small children when her home was burned. With one child in each arm, she waded across an icy creek to safety in Adam-ondi-Ahman. Nathan Tanner reported that his militia company rescued another woman and three small children who were hiding in the bushes as their home burned. Other latter-day saints, fearing similar retribution by the Missourians, gathered into Adam-ondi-Ahman for protection.

===Marsh affidavit===

Thomas B. Marsh, President of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles of the church, and fellow Apostle Orson Hyde were alarmed by the events of the Daviess County expedition. On October 19, 1838, the day after Gallatin was burned, Thomas B. Marsh and fellow apostle Orson Hyde left the association of the Church. On October 24, they swore out affidavits concerning the burning and looting in Daviess County. They also reported the existence of the Danite group among the latter-day saints and repeated a popular rumor that a group of Danites was planning to attack and burn Richmond and Liberty.

==Battle of Crooked River and latter-day saint Extermination Order==
 
Fearing attack, many citizens of Ray County moved their wives and children across the Missouri River for safety. A militia under the command of Samuel Bogart was authorized by General Atchison to patrol the no-man&#x27;s land between Ray and Caldwell Counties known as &quot;Bunkham&#x27;s Strip&quot; – a territory east to west and north to south. Instead of staying in the strip, Bogart crossed into Caldwell County and began to disarm latter-day saints, reportedly threatening to attack Far West. When rumors reached Far West that a mob had taken latter-day saints prisoner and were threatening to execute them, an armed party was quickly assembled to rescue these prisoners and drive the mob out of the county.

When the latter-day saints arrived on the scene, the militia was camped along Crooked River in the Bunkham&#x27;s Strip just south of Caldwell County. After a militia sentry shot at the crowd, the latter-day saints divided into three columns led by David W. Patten, Charles C. Rich, and James Durphee. The militia broke ranks and fled across the river. Although latter-day saints won the battle, they took heavier casualties than the militia, only one of whom, Moses Rowland, was killed. On the latter-day saint side, Gideon Carter was killed in the battle and nine other latter-day saints were wounded, including Patten, who soon after died from his wounds. According to one latter-day saint witness, the deaths &quot;threw a gloom over the whole place&quot;.

News of the battle quickly spread and contributed to an all-out panic in northwestern Missouri. Exaggerated initial reports indicated that nearly all of Bogart&#x27;s company had been killed. Generals Atchison, Doniphon and Parks decided they needed to call out the militia to &quot;prevent further violence&quot;. In a letter to US Army Colonel R. B. Mason of Ft. Leavenworth, they expressed:
The citizens of Daviess, Carroll, and some other counties have raised mob after mob for the last two months for the purpose of driving a group of latter-day saints from those counties and from the State.

Missouri vigilantes continued to act on their own, driving latter-day saints inward to Far West and Adam-ondi-Ahman. Meanwhile, exaggerated reports from the Battle of Crooked River made their way to Missouri&#x27;s governor, Lilburn Boggs. Boggs was considered more adversarial towards the latter-day saints than his predecessor, and, as Lieutenant Governor, had sided with the vigilantes who had expelled the latter-day saints from Jackson County in 1833. Boggs mustered 2,500 state militiamen to put down what he considered a latter-day saint insurrection against the state. Possibly playing on Rigdon&#x27;s July 4 sermon that talked of a &quot;war of extermination&quot;, Boggs issued Missouri Executive Order 44, also known as the &quot;Extermination Order&quot;, on October 27, which stated that &quot;the latter-day saints must be treated as enemies, and must be exterminated or driven from the State if necessary for the public peace...&quot; The Extermination Order was officially rescinded on June 25, 1976, by Governor Christopher Samuel &quot;Kit&quot; Bond.

==Hawn&#x27;s Mill Massacre==

Agitation against the Latter Day Saints had become particularly fierce in the sparsely settled counties north and east of Caldwell County. latter-day saint dissenters from Daviess County who had fled to Livingston County reportedly told Livingston County militia under Colonel Thomas Jennings that latter-day saints were gathering at Hawn&#x27;s Mill to mount a raid into Livingston County. One 19th century Missouri historian noted:

The Daviess County men were very bitter against the latter-day saints, and vowed the direst vengeance on the entire sect. It did not matter whether or not the latter-day saints at [Haun&#x27;s] mill had taken any part in the disturbance which had occurred [in Daviess County]; it was enough that they were latter-day saints. The Livingston men became thoroughly imbued with the same spirit, and were eager for the raid ... feel[ing] an extraordinary sympathy for the outrages suffered by their neighbors

Although it had just been issued, little evidence exists that the governor&#x27;s &quot;Extermination Order&quot; had reached the attackers. None of the participants in the raid cited the order as justification for their actions.

On October 29, this large vigilante band of about 250 men assembled and entered eastern Caldwell County. When the Missourian raiders approached the settlement on the afternoon of October 30, some 30 to 40 Latter Day Saint families were living or encamped there. Despite an attempt by the latter-day saints to parley, the mob attacked. Thomas McBride surrendered his rifle to Jacob Rogers, who shot McBride with his own gun. When McBride held out a hand, Rogers cut it off with a corn knife, then may have further mangled his body while McBride was still alive. Other members of the mob opened fire, which sent the latter-day saints fleeing in all directions.

While latter-day saint women and children scattered and hid in the surrounding woods and nearby homes, latter-day saint men and boys rallied to defend the settlement. They moved into a blacksmith shop, which they hoped to use as a makeshift defensive fortification, however, the shop had large gaps between the logs which the Missourians shot into and, as one latter-day saint later recalled, it became more &quot;slaughter-house rather than a shelter&quot;. After firing at the shop for half an hour, some of the Missourians entered to kill the survivors. They found 10-year-old Sardius Smith hiding behind the bellows. William Reynolds of Livingston County shot and killed the boy, saying: &quot;Nits will make lice, and if he had lived he would have become a latter-day saint&quot; 17 were killed in total. When survivors of the massacre reached Far West, the reports of the savagery of the attack played a significant part in the decision of the latter-day saints to surrender. No Missourians were ever prosecuted for their role in the Hawn&#x27;s Mill Massacre.

== The use of sexual violence ==
Though they were not believed in their day, latter-day saints reported threats of sexual violence, attempts to commit it and actual acts of rape perpetrated on latter-day saint women. Ruth Naper swore before a justice of the peace that in early November, after the Haun&#x27;s Mill Massacre, armed nonlatter-day saints billeted themselves in her home without her consent while she was living there as a widow with small children. One night as she was sleeping one of the men came to her bed and fondled her. She was so frightened she made some sort of commotion and crawled over her children to get away. He retreated and tried nothing more that night.

Elijah Reed similarly swore before a clerk of the circuit court that, fleeing for his life from a group of armed Missouri settlers, he took shelter with the Jameson family (here spelled &quot;Jimmison&quot;). On October 29, a group of Missourians came to the house, demanding entrance or they would break down the door. Mr. Jimmison answered the door while Reed hid under a bed. The men, identifying themselves as soldiers, said they had come to take Mr. Jimmison away. As Jimmison was taken to get a horse for him to ride away with them, he broke free and escaped. They returned to the house and began to assault Mrs. Jimmison, preparing to rape her as Reed witnessed this from under the bed. According to Reed, they stopped fondling her after she cried and begged for them to do so.

Hyrum Smith also stated under oath before a municipal judge that after the skirmishes that destroyed houses and farmlands, the latter-day saint leadership sent a message to General Atchison and expected an army to provide protection for them. The army that arrived the evening of October 30 was lead by General Doniphan and the far less friendly General Lucas, who had already murdered latter-day saints in the area in 1833 and 1834. The next day the latter-day saint leaders and men of Far West were lured to a cornfield on the pretext of a consultation with the generals and officers but they were surrounded and taken prisoner. November 1, the armed soldiers patrolling the streets of Far West were permitted enter homes, molest the people at their leisure, confiscate the firearms and ravish (rape) the women there.

Parley P. Pratt added his sworn testimony to the rapes committed when he attested before a municipal judge that he was among the group with Joseph Smith who were taken prisoner in the corn field. He said that while imprisoned, their guards named a couple of female latter-day saints and claimed that about twenty or thirty soldiers had tied the women down and raped them.

The account John Murdock recorded in his journal reflects what Pratt and Smith avowed, adding that the rapes and abuse continued for as long as the latter-day saints remained in Missouri.

==Siege of Far West and capture of latter-day saint leaders==

Most latter-day saints gathered to Far West and Adam-ondi-Ahman for protection. Major General Samuel D. Lucas marched the state militia to Far West and laid siege to the latter-day saint headquarters on the 1st of November. Surrounded by the state militia, Joseph Smith ordered Colonel George M. Hinkle, the head of the latter-day saint militia in Caldwell County, to ride out and meet with General Lucas to seek terms. According to Hinkle, Smith wanted a treaty with the Missourians &quot;on any terms short of battle&quot;. Other Latter Day Saint witnesses remembered that Smith said to &quot;beg like a dog for peace&quot;.

Lucas&#x27; terms were one-sided. The latter-day saints were to give up their leaders for trial and to surrender all of their arms. Every latter-day saint who had taken up arms was to sell his property to pay for the damages to Missourian property and for the muster of the state militia. Finally, the latter-day saints who had taken up arms were to leave the state. Colonel Hinkle stated that the latter-day saints would help bring to justice those who had violated the law, but he protested that the other terms were illegal and unconstitutional.

Colonel Hinkle rode to the church leaders in Far West and informed them of the offered terms. According to latter-day saint witness Reed Peck, when Smith was told that the latter-day saints would be expected to leave the state, he replied that &quot;he did not care&quot; and that he would be glad to get out of the &quot;damnable state&quot; anyway. Smith and the other leaders rode with Hinkle back to the Missouri militia encampment. The militia promptly arrested Smith and the other leaders. Smith believed that Hinkle had betrayed him, but Hinkle maintained his innocence and claimed that he was following Smith&#x27;s orders. To William Wines Phelps, a fellow latter-day saint and witness to the events, Hinkle wrote: &quot;When the facts were laid before Joseph, did he not say, &#x27;I will go&#x27;; and did not the others go with him, and that, too, voluntarily, so far as you and I were concerned?&quot;

Joseph Smith and the other arrested leaders were held overnight under guard in General Lucas&#x27; camp. Hyrum Smith, Brigham Young, and other leaders left at Far West warned the veterans of Crooked River to flee. &quot;If found, they will be shot down like dogs,&quot; warned Hyrum. Joseph Smith attempted to negotiate with Lucas, but Lucas considered his conditions to be non-negotiable. At 8:00 am, Joseph sent word to Far West to surrender. Ebenezer Robinson described the scene at Far West:General Clark made the following speech to the brethren on the public square: &quot;... The orders of the governor to me were, that you should be exterminated, and not allowed to remain in the state, and had your leaders not been given up, and the terms of the treaty complied with, before this, you and your families would have been destroyed and your houses in ashes.&quot;

The Far West militia was marched out of the city and forced to turn over their weapons to General Lucas. The men under the command of Lucas were then allowed to ransack the city to search for weapons. Brigham Young recounts that, once the militia was disarmed, Lucas&#x27;s men were turned loose on the city:
[T]hey commenced their ravages by plundering the citizens of their bedding, clothing, money, wearing apparel, and every thing of value they could lay their hands upon, and also attempting to violate the chastity of the women in sight of their husbands and friends, under the pretence of hunting for prisoners and arms. The soldiers shot down our oxen, cows, hogs and fowls, at our own doors, taking part away and leaving the rest to rot in the streets. The soldiers also turned their horses into our fields of corn.
===Trials of latter-day saint leaders===
Lucas tried Joseph Smith and other latter-day saint leaders by court martial on November 1, the evening of the surrender. After the court martial, he ordered General Alexander William Doniphan:
You will take Joseph Smith and the other prisoners into the public square of Far West and shoot them at 9 o&#x27;clock tomorrow morning.

Doniphan refused to obey the order, replying:
It is cold-blooded murder. I will not obey your order. My brigade shall march for Liberty to-morrow morning, at 8 o&#x27;clock, and if you execute those men, I will hold you responsible before an earthly tribunal, so help me God!
The defendants, consisting of about 60 men including Joseph Smith and Sidney Rigdon, were turned over to a civil court of inquiry in Richmond under Judge Austin A. King, on charges of treason, murder, arson, burglary, robbery, larceny and perjury. The court of inquiry began November 12, 1838. After the inquiry, most of the latter-day saint prisoners were released, but Joseph Smith, Sidney Rigdon, Lyman Wight, Caleb Baldwin, Hyrum Smith and Alexander McRae were held in the Liberty Jail in Liberty, Clay County on charges of treason against the state, murder, arson, burglary, robbery and larceny.

During a transfer to another prison in the spring of 1839, Smith and the other prisoners escaped. The exact circumstances that allowed for him to escape are not certain. John Whitmer suggests that Smith bribed the guards. Historian Richard Bushman believes that Smith&#x27;s imprisonment had become an embarrassment, and that an escape would be convenient for Boggs and the rest of the Missouri political establishment. Smith and the other latter-day saints resettled in Nauvoo, Illinois, beginning in 1839.

Daviess County residents were outraged by the escape of Smith and the other leaders. William Bowman, one of the guards, was dragged by his hair across the town square. Sheriff Morgan was ridden through town on an iron bar, and died shortly afterward from the injuries he suffered during the ride.

==Aftermath==

General Clark viewed Executive Order 44 as having been fulfilled by the agreement of the latter-day saints to evacuate the state the following spring. The militia was disbanded in late November. Missouri blamed the latter-day saints for the conflict and forced the latter-day saints to sign over all their lands in order to pay for the state militia muster. Latter-day saint leaders appealed to the state legislature to overturn the requirement that they leave the state, but the legislature tabled the issue until a date well after that when the latter-day saints would have left the state.

Having surrendered the bulk of their firearms, latter-day saints were left nearly defenseless against the mobs. latter-day saint residents were harassed and attacked by angry residents who were no longer restrained by militia officers. Judge Austin A King, who had been assigned the cases of the latter-day saints charged with offenses during the conflict, warned &quot;If you once think to plant crops or to occupy your lands any longer than the first of April, the citizens will be upon you: they will kill you every one, men, women and children.&quot;

===Flight of latter-day saints to Illinois===

Stripped of their property, most refugees made their way east to Illinois, where residents of the town of Quincy helped them. When faced with the latter-day saint refugees from Missouri, the people of Quincy were outraged by the treatment the latter-day saints had experienced. One resolution passed by the Quincy town council read:
Resolved: That the gov of Missouri, in refusing protection to this class of people when pressed upon by an heartless mob, and turning upon them a band of unprincipled Militia, with orders encouraging their extermination, has brought a lasting disgrace upon the state over which he presides. 

Eventually, the latter-day saints purchased and settled the mostly vacant city of Commerce, north of Quincy, which they renamed Nauvoo in 1839.

===Political fallout===
Many of Boggs&#x27;s constituents felt that he had mismanaged the situation by failing to intervene earlier in the crisis, and then by overreacting on the basis of partial and incorrect information. The &quot;Missouri Argus&quot; published an editorial on December 20, 1838, arguing that the latter-day saints should not be permitted to be forcibly expelled from the state:They cannot be driven beyond the limits of the state—that is certain. To do so, would be to act with extreme cruelty. Public opinion has recoiled from a summary and forcible removal of our negro population;—much more likely will it be to revolt at the violent expulsion of two or three thousand souls, who have so many ties to connect them with us in a common brotherhood. If they choose to remain, we must be content. The day has gone by when masses of men can be outlawed, and driven from society to the wilderness, unprotected. ... The refinement, the charity of our age, will not brook it.

Even people who otherwise expressed no sympathy towards the latter-day saints disapproved of Boggs&#x27;s order and the treatment of the latter-day saints by the mobs. One contemporary critic of the latter-day saints wrote:
Mormonism is a monstrous evil; and the only place where it ever did or ever could shine, this side of the world of despair, is by the side of the Missouri mob.

LeSueur notes that, along with other setbacks, Boggs&#x27;s mishandling of the latter-day saint conflict left him &quot;politically impotent&quot; by the end of his term.

===Boggs assassination attempt===
On May 6, 1842, Boggs was shot in the head at his home three blocks from Temple Lot. Boggs survived, but latter-day saints came under immediate suspicion, especially Orrin Porter Rockwell, bodyguard of Joseph Smith. Sheriff J.H. Reynolds discovered a revolver at the scene, still loaded with buckshot. He surmised that the perpetrator had fired upon Boggs and lost his firearm in the night when the weapon recoiled due to its unusually large shot. The gun was found to have been stolen from a local shopkeeper, who identified &quot;that hired man of Ward&#x27;s&quot; as the most likely culprit. Reynolds determined the man in question was Rockwell.
John C. Bennett, a disaffected latter-day saint, reported that Smith had offered a cash reward to anyone who would assassinate Boggs, and that Smith had admitted to him that Rockwell had done the deed. Joseph Smith denied Bennett&#x27;s account, speculating that Boggs—who was campaigning for state senate—was attacked by an election opponent. One historian notes that Governor Boggs was running for election against several violent men, all capable of the deed, and that there was no particular reason to suspect Rockwell of the crime. Other historians are convinced that Rockwell was involved in the shooting. The following year, Rockwell was arrested, tried, and acquitted of the attempted murder, after a grand jury was unable to find sufficient evidence to indict him, although most of Boggs&#x27; contemporaries remained convinced of his guilt. Rockwell famously stated that he &quot;never shot &quot;at&quot; anybody, if I shoot they get shot!... He&#x27;s still alive, ain&#x27;t he?&quot;

<doc id="780741" wikidata="Q6775020" url="?curid=780741" title="Martin Boehm">
<text>Martin Boehm (November 30, 1725 – March 23, 1812) was an American clergyman and pastor. He was the son of Jacob Boehm and Barbara Kendig who settled in Lancaster, Pennsylvania. Boehm married Eve Steiner in 1753 and in 1756 he was chosen by lot to become the minister of the local German-speaking Mennonite church.

Although raised a Mennonite, he lacked the assurance of the presence and power of Jesus Christ in his life and he prayed for a heart-warming experience, to deepen his personal faith. Then one day, after many months of prayer and meditation he had an epiphany. After this, Martin preached with confidence and fervor. In 1761, Martin was advanced to the office of bishop in the Mennonite tradition.

On May 10, 1767, in a Great Meeting held at Long&#x27;s Barn near Lancaster, Pa., Boehm met Philip William Otterbein, an ordained missionary to German speaking residents in America for the Reformed Church in Germany. Otterbein was so impressed with Boehm&#x27;s passionate message that afterwards he embraced Boehm and declared, &quot;Wir sind Brüder&quot; (We are brethren). From that moment, the two were lifelong friends and companions.

In 1774, Boehm opened his home to a Methodist group that needed a place to meet. Soon the members of his family became Methodists, while he remained a Mennonite.
In 1791 Boehm donated land six miles south of Lancaster to that Methodist group to build religious buildings. That same year a church was built and named Boehm&#x27;s Chapel.

In 1774, Otterbein helped a splinter group from a Reformed Evangelical church in Baltimore become the Second Reformed Evangelical Church and, with Boehm’s encouragement, he became its pastor.

Both men continued their outreach to others and both were strongly influenced by Methodist beliefs. They had a number of followers.

In 1800, after being expelled by the Mennonites for being too evangelical, Boehm and Otterbein formed the Church of the United Brethren in Christ, and they were elected the denomination&#x27;s first two bishops. 

In 1802, Boehm joined the Methodist Episcopal Church while still a bishop of the United Brethren Church, becoming a bishop there too.

He is believed to be a descendant of Jakob Boehme. His youngest child of eight children, Henry Boehm, also became a clergyman.

Martin Boehm died on March 23, 1812. Methodist Episcopal Church Bishop Francis Asbury and Boehn&#x27;s son Henry Boehm, a Methodist pastor, conducted a memorial service for Boehm on April 5, 1812.

== Restoration to Bishop Emeritus ==
On February 26, 2016, the bishops of the Lancaster Mennonite Conference unanimously approved a resolution to &quot;grant a remission of the censure of excommunication to Martin Boehm and a restoration of his bishop creditial, &quot;emeritus&quot;.&quot; The resolution was presented, and a written confession signed, by three Mennonite bishops at the 225th anniversary of Boehm&#x27;s Chapel on June 26, 2016, to a crowd of more than 250 witnesses.

<doc id="780744" wikidata="Q328580" url="?curid=780744" title="Moses Jacob Ezekiel">
<text>Moses Jacob Ezekiel, also known as Moses &quot;Ritter von&quot; Ezekiel (October 28, 1844 – March 27, 1917), was an American sculptor who lived and worked in Rome for the majority of his career. Ezekiel was &quot;the first American-born Jewish artist to receive international acclaim&quot;. Ezekiel was an ardent supporter, in both his writings and in his works, of the Lost Cause view of history.

He was a cadet at the Virginia Military Institute and served in the Confederate Army during the American Civil War, including at the Battle of New Market.

After the war, he completed his degree at VMI, and a few years later went to Berlin, studying at the Prussian Academy of Art. He subsequently moved to Rome, where he lived and worked most of his life, selling his works internationally, including several commissions in the United States.

He has been described as a &quot;Confederate expatriate&quot; and a &quot;proud Southerner&quot;, and the Confederate battle flag hung in his Rome studio for 40 years. The most famous of his monuments is the Confederate Memorial in Arlington National Cemetery, which he thought of as the &quot;crowning achievement of his career.&quot; The monument was removed on December 20, 2023.

==Early life==
Ezekiel was born in Richmond, Virginia, the son of Jacob Ezekiel (1812–1899), an Ashkenazic Jew. His mother, Catherine de Castro Ezekiel, was Sephardic. His grandparents had emigrated from Holland in the early 1800s, settling first in Philadelphia and later in Richmond. His father was a cotton merchant and bookbinder, &quot;a good writer and a well-read man, who possessed the complete works of Maimonides&quot;. While in the book-binding business in Baltimore (1833–34), Jacob founded the Hebrew Benevolent Society of Baltimore. Jacob moved to Richmond in 1834, entering the dry-goods business with first one, then another brother-in-law. He was secretary of the synagogue Kahal Kadosh Beth Shalome &quot;and spokesman of the Jews of Richmond&quot;. In Cincinnati, Jacob served as Secretary of the Board of Hebrew Union College. He was a charter member of B&#x27;nai B&#x27;rith.

The seventh child, Moses had three brothers and eight sisters, at least one of which was stillborn. He was brought up as an observant Jew by his grandparents, to whom his parents sent him to live due to financial difficulties. They owned a dry-goods store that sold suits and women&#x27;s dresses for slaves about to be sold. They also owned a few slaves. Moses &quot;was sent to a &#x27;pay&#x27; school&quot;, that of &quot;old Mr. Burton Davis&quot;, and he attended dancing school.

==Virginia Military Institute and the Civil War==

When Fort Sumter was fired upon and Virginia seceded, Ezekiel enrolled in the Virginia Military Institute in Lexington, Virginia, the first Jewish cadet to do so. He was Corporal of the Guard that accompanied the coffin of Stonewall Jackson (a Virginia Military Institute instructor) at his burial in Lexington in 1863.

He and other cadets from VMI marched eighty miles north and fought at the Battle of New Market, providing crucially needed reinforcements against the army of Union General Franz Sigel. Wounded in the fight, he recovered and was reassigned with other surviving cadets to serve as drill instructors for new Confederate recruits. Shortly before the end of the war, he joined a last-ditch effort to defend Lexington during Grant&#x27;s Richmond-Petersburg campaign. When peace was declared, he returned to VMI to finish his education, graduating in 1866.

== Sculpture ==
He then studied anatomy at the Medical College of Virginia in 1866–68, thinking of becoming a doctor. In 1867–68, he was superintendent of the Richmond Hebrew Sunday School. He moved in with his parents in Cincinnati in 1868; his parents had moved there, where their oldest daughter Hannah lived, after losing their business in Richmond to fire. While not there long, in his memoirs he called Cincinnati his home.

In Cincinnati he began the study of sculpture at the Art School of J. Insco Williams and in the studio of Thomas Dow Jones. Moving to Berlin in 1869, he studied at the Prussian Academy of Art under Professor Albert Wolf.

Needing money, in 1873, during the Franco-Prussian War, he was a war correspondent for the &quot;New York Herald&quot;, and he was arrested and imprisoned &quot;for a time&quot; as a spy for France. He was admitted into the Society of Artists, Berlin, and at age 29 was the first foreigner to win the Michael Beer Prix de Rome, for a &quot;bas relief&quot; entitled &quot;Israel&quot;. The prize of $1,000 provided for two years of study in Rome, but he traveled to Rome by way of the United States, where he had not been for five years, as he had &quot;unexpectedly&quot; received a commission from B&#x27;nai B&#x27;rith for a monument to religious liberty.

==Rome studio==
Arriving in Rome in 1874, Ezekiel fell in love with the city, which he soon made his home. It was there that he completed the sculptures and paintings for which he is famous.

Ezekiel&#x27;s life and studio in Rome were lavish. &quot;He dressed like a dandy and spent extravagantly on entertaining friends, clients, and potential clients.&quot; His studio in Rome was in the former Baths of Diocletian, where every Friday afternoon he had open house. It was called &quot;one of the Show Places of the Eternal City, magnificent in proportions and stored with fine art works.&quot; and many visitors left descriptions of it.

Among the visitors to his studio were:

* Gabriele d&#x27;Annunzio
* Queen of Italy Margherita of Savoy
* General and future President Ulysses Grant
* Franz Liszt
* U.S. ambassador to Italy John Stallo
* Cardinal Gustav Adolf Hohenlohe
* writer Annie Besant
* railroad magnate Melville Ingalls
* engineer Benjamin Hotchkiss, and
* Emperor Wilhelm II of Germany

Here also he made the acquaintance of Franz Liszt and Cardinal Gustave von Hohenlohe, the Papal representative of Austria. Thus, naturally, busts of these two famous men are included in Ezekiel&#x27;s oeuvre.

A lecture in his studio was attended by 150 people. He also hosted musicales there, where could be heard &quot;the finest music by the greatest talent&quot;.

Ezekiel occupied this studio from 1879 to 1910. After 30 years, the government &quot;demand[ed] the possession of this part of the ruins as an adjunct to the National Roman Museum. On leaving there he was given by the municipal authorities the Tower of Belisarius on the Pincian Hill overlooking the Borghese Gardens, which furnished him a home for the rest of his years, while he took a studio and work rooms in the Via Fausta and just off the Piazza del Popolo.&quot;

==Personal life==

Although Ezekiel never married, he had a daughter, Alice Johnson (1859–1924). According to a census document of July 14, 1860, Alice Johnson was 10 months old, suggesting she was born in September 1859. She would therefore have been conceived at the beginning of 1859 when Moses was 14. Her mother was Isabella, a &quot;beautiful mulatto housemaid&quot; of his father. After graduating from Howard University, Alice became a schoolteacher and married Daniel Hale Williams in 1898, who was also mixed race. He became a prominent, pioneering heart surgeon. They lived in Chicago for much of his career.

Isabella visited Moses in Rome with Alice, but returned shortly thereafter. Moses never refers to Alice in his &quot;Memoirs&quot;, and there is no record of any other contact between them.

In 1872, in Berlin, he met Fedor Encke (1851–1926), the &quot;illegitimate grandson of King Friedrich Wilhelm II of Prussia.&quot; Encke was a portrait painter later commissioned to do portraits of Theodore Roosevelt and John Pierpont Morgan, among others; he also painted Ezekiel. The pair &quot;traveled together often and socialized with Europe&#x27;s elites, including Hungarian composer Franz Liszt, French actress Sarah Bernhardt and Queen Margherita of Italy.&quot; Encke accompanied Ezekiel on a visit to the United States. According to writer Michael Feldberg, Ezekiel and Encke had &quot;a forty-five year homosexual relationship…that neither acknowledged publicly.&quot; About this relationship, Ezekiel was always circumspect in his letters and memoirs, referring to Encke only as his &quot;traveling companion&quot; and &quot;my dear friend.&quot;

Biographer Peter Adam Nash, in &quot;The Life and Times of Moses Jacob Ezekiel&quot;, describes Ezekiel as homosexual, but Nash does not produce any direct evidence for this; Nash&#x27;s assumption is made from his research of Ezekiel&#x27;s papers and of their social and historical context.

==Awards and honors==
In his lifetime, Ezekiel received numerous honors: he was decorated by King Umberto I of Italy, the &quot;Crosses for Merit and Art&quot; from the German Emperor, another from Prince Frederick Johann of Saxe-Meiningen, and the awards of &quot;Chevalier&quot; (Cavaliere) and &quot;Officer of the Crown of Italy&quot; (1910) from King Victor Emmanuel III of Italy. Ezekiel received the Gold Medal of the Royal Society of Palermo, Italy; the silver medal at the 1904 Louisiana Purchase Exposition in St. Louis, Missouri; and the Raphael Medal from the Art Society of Urbino, Italy.

The honorific &quot;Sir&quot; by which Ezekiel is often referred is technically incorrect, as Ezekiel was never knighted by the monarch of the United Kingdom. More properly, his title was &quot;Cavaliere&quot; Moses Ezekiel, because of his Italian knighthood, or Moses &quot;Ritter von&quot; Ezekiel, because of his German honors. Ezekiel translated his Italian title into the English &quot;Sir&quot; on his visiting cards, resulting in the honorific by which he became known in English-speaking countries.

In 1904, he was presented the New Market Cross of Honor at VMI by the Government of Virginia as one of the 294 cadets who fought at the Battle of New Market.

== Grave ==

Ezekiel died in his studio in Rome, Italy during the First World War, and was temporarily entombed there. In 1921, he was reinterred at the foot of his Confederate Memorial in Section 16 of Arlington National Cemetery. The inscription on his grave reads &quot;Moses J. Ezekiel Sergeant of Company C Battalion of Cadets of the Virginia Military Institute.&quot;

==Legacy==
===Critical assessments===
Compared to Michelangelo in 1876, Ezekiel&#x27;s fame has not stood the test of time. &quot;Famous in his day, he is almost forgotten now&quot; (1986). According to his biographer Peter Nash, &quot;You wouldn&#x27;t go to Rome to make new, progressive art.&quot; &quot;He could not accept modern art&quot;, and &quot;rejected&quot; Rodin, whom he considered &quot;pretentious&quot;. After noting the awards he received during his life, Sue Eisenfeld wrote in 2018:

&quot;As was his custom with his monuments, Ezekiel proceeded meticulously to reflect historical accuracy,&quot; according to the editors of his memoirs.

===&quot;Lost Cause&quot; movement===
Another factor possibly contributing to his relative obscurity may be his devotion to the Confederacy.

Ezekiel&#x27;s sculptures of Confederate heroes are the most visible manifestation of, and a significant factor in the legitimacy of, the Lost Cause of the Confederacy, which he espoused.

Ezekiel&#x27;s work has been identified as integral to this sympathetic view of the Civil War. He depicted Confederate leaders, like Stonewall Jackson, or fallen soldiers like the VMI students, as heroes. &quot;But no monument exemplifies the Lost Cause narrative better than Ezekiel&#x27;s &quot;Confederate Memorial&quot; in Arlington, where the woman representing the South appears to be protecting the black figures below.&quot; According to his relative Judith Ezekiel, &quot;This statue was a very, very deliberate part of revisionist history of racist America.&quot; According to historian Gabriel Reich, &quot;the statue functions as propaganda for the Lost Cause.… It couldn&#x27;t be worse.&quot;

On August 20, 2017, in the aftermath of the Unite the right rally in Charlottesville, Virginia — members of Ezekiel&#x27;s extended family sent a letter to the &quot;Washington Post&quot;, asking for the Arlington monument&#x27;s removal:

, plans were under way to remove the statue from Arlington, with plans to relocate it to the New Market Battlefield State Historical Park. Ezekiel had a personal link to the New Market site as he fought for the Confederacy and was wounded at this battlefield.

==Works==

In the early 1880s, Ezekiel created eleven larger-than-life sized statues of famous artists. These were installed in niches on the façade of the Corcoran Gallery of Art&#x27;s original building (later the Smithsonian&#x27;s Renwick Gallery). In the early 1960s, they were removed to the Norfolk Botanical Garden in Norfolk, Virginia.

Among his other works was a memorial at VMI, &quot;Virginia Mourning Her Dead&quot; (1903), for which he declined payment. It was installed in the small cemetery where six of the 10 VMI cadets killed at the Battle of New Market are buried. He also created a Confederate memorial which he called &quot;New South&quot; (1914); it was installed at Arlington National Cemetery. Many of his works were of famous leaders.

One word frequently used by Ezekiel as well as others to describe his statues is &quot;colossal&quot;: his &quot;genius often asserts itself in colossal figures and emblematic monuments&quot;. His never-built statue of Johns Hopkins, founder of Johns Hopkins University, was to have been over 15 feet (4.6 m) high, with a &quot;colossal&quot; bust of Hopkins, in bronze, 21⁄2 times life size. His most important statues are huge, and in one case he claimed that it was the largest statue ever made.

Lists of Ezekiel&#x27;s works are found in the introduction to his &quot;Memoirs&quot;, in an obituary in &quot;Art and Archaeology&quot;, and in the &quot;New York Times&quot;.

Ezekiel was a postwar friend of Robert E. Lee, who recommended he become &quot;an artist&quot;, and Ezekiel once remarked &quot;the one work I would love to do above anything else in the world&quot; was a public sculpture of Robert E. Lee. But, despite entering at least four contests to do so, this ambition was not realized.

==Archival material==
The American Jewish Archives, in Cincinnati, has a &quot;Moses Jacob Ezekiel Collection.&quot; It &quot;includes original and photocopies of Ezekiel&#x27;s correspondence and writings, photographs of many of his works, biographies, genealogies, memorial tributes, correspondence of Ezekiel&#x27;s biographers, articles and newsclippings concerning Ezekiel and miscellaneous items.&quot;

Virginia Military Institute has two boxes of Ezekiel papers. &quot;Included is correspondence to Virginia Military Institute Superintendent Edward West Nichols and others, 1867 – 1917, some relating to the design of the Battle of New Market memorial sculpture &quot;Virginia Mourning Her Dead&quot;; pen and ink sketches by Ezekiel (ca. 67 items); the typed manuscript of Ezekiel&#x27;s autobiography, &quot;Memoirs from the Baths of Diocletian&quot;, and miscellaneous printed material.&quot; Ezekiel&#x27;s &quot;Memoirs&quot;, a fundamental source, were unknown until they were rediscovered in the Hebrew Union Archives by the two rabbis, who after much editorial work, prepared them for publication in 1975. They were called &quot;gossipy&quot; but &quot;readable&quot; in a review.

Some additional material is in the archives of Congregation Beth Ahabah, of Richmond, which contains the archive of Jacob Ezekiel&#x27;s synagogue, Kahal Kadosh Beth Shalome, the Hebrew Union College of Cincinnati, on whose board of directors Jacob was secretary, and the organizations such as B&#x27;nai Brith and United Daughters of the Confederacy that commissioned sculptures.

A poem about his &quot;Israel&quot; was written by Pietschmann, of Berlin.

Gabriele d&#x27;Annunzio wrote a poem, &quot;To Moie Ezekiel,&quot; in 1887.

A description of his studio by Lilian V. de Bosis was published in the May 1891 issue of &#x27;kTye Esquiline&quot;.&quot;

<text>An Internet appliance is a consumer device whose main function is easy access to Internet services such as WWW or e-mail. The term was popularized in the 1990s, when it somewhat overlapped in meaning with an information appliance, desktop computer, network computer, or even thin client, but now it has fallen out of general use.

Internet appliances were contrasted with any general purpose computer, but unlike personal computers, internet appliances were low cost and low margin products, usually using highly optimised low power silicon specifically built for internet use. Modern smart phones and tablet computers do approximately the same things, but are more powerful, more successful in the market, and generally not classified as Internet appliances.

== History ==
Internet appliances were promoted by a variety of technology companies during the 1990s but, as the price of full-featured computers dropped, never met the market expectations. Jim Louderback would later describe the concept as one of the &quot;eight biggest tech flops ever&quot;.

An Internet tablet is a type of a mobile Internet appliance. Examples include the Sony Airboard and the Nokia Internet Tablet series (including the Nokia N900).

Early in the 21st century a new breed of household devices, such as Vonage Internet Phones, PenguinRadio&#x27;s Internet radio, and IPTV boxes, began to use the broadband connections in PC-independent ways.

<doc id="780751" wikidata="Q891294" url="?curid=780751" title="Boldt Castle">
<text>Boldt Castle is a major landmark and tourist attraction in the Thousand Islands region of the U.S. state of New York. Open to guests seasonally between mid-May and mid-October, it is located on Heart Island in the Saint Lawrence River. Heart Island is part of the Town of Alexandria, in Jefferson County. Originally a private mansion built for German-American millionaire George Boldt, it is now maintained by the Thousand Islands Bridge Authority as a tourist attraction.

==History==

George Boldt, proprietor of the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel in New York City and manager of the Bellevue-Stratford Hotel in Philadelphia, and his family enjoyed an earlier frame cottage on Hart Island (the island&#x27;s original name) for several summers, which they greatly expanded. In 1900, George Boldt launched an ambitious construction campaign to build a huge masonry structure, one of the largest private homes in the United States. He engaged the architectural firm G. W. &amp; W. D. Hewitt and hundreds of workers to build a six-story castle as a present to his wife. In addition, four other masonry structures on the island are architecturally notable. Equally distinctive is a huge yacht house on neighboring Wellesley Island, where the Boldts had another summer home and a vast estate, incorporating farms, canals, a golf course, tennis courts, stables, and a polo field.

The construction of Boldt Castle ceased abruptly in early 1904 after the death of Boldt&#x27;s wife, Louise Kehrer Boldt. Boldt never returned to Heart Island, but continued to spend summers in the Thousand Islands until his death in 1916. For 73 years, the castle and other stone structures were left exposed to the harsh winter weather and vandals. The Thousand Islands Bridge Authority acquired Heart Island and the nearby yacht house in 1977, for one dollar, under the agreement that all revenues obtained from the castle operation would be applied towards restoration, so that the island would be preserved for the enjoyment of future generations. In 1981, the movie &quot;Fear No Evil&quot; was filmed at several sites in and around Boldt Castle, marking the only time the castle has made an appearance in cinema. In the five decades after acquiring the property, the Thousand Islands Bridge Authority spent around $15 million for restoration and improvements with work continuing annually. The initial goal of the restoration of Heart Island was not to finish what had not been completed, but to restore the island to the state it was in when construction was halted. Improvements have surpassed that goal, as a stained glass dome, marble floor, grand staircase woodwork, butler&#x27;s pantry, servant&#x27;s dining room and kitchen were restored. As of 2020, over $50 million had been spent on restoration and rehabilitation work on the castle and surrounding structures.

==Current estate==
Today, Boldt Castle is accessible by ferry or tour boat from Alexandria Bay, New York, Clayton, New York, Gananoque, Ontario, Rockport, Ontario, and Ivy Lea, Ontario. Most of the grounds and buildings can be explored by the public for a fee. Private boaters may also dock at Heart Island for free. Boldt Castle is a Port of Entry and has a U.S. Customs and Border Protection office on Heart Island. Visitors coming from Canada require appropriate identification to check in to the country, as visiting the island is considered entering the United States.

 All of the rooms on the first floor and second floors of Boldt Castle are restored and furnished. The second floor houses the Gift Shop and Theatre, where visitors can view a 16-minute documentary about George Boldt and Boldt Castle. Most of the rooms on the third and fourth floors are unfurnished, but there are exhibits of pictures and original artifacts of the Thousand Islands region during the Gilded Age in which the Boldts lived. Rooms are also left unfurnished to give the visitor an opportunity to imagine what the castle looked like before the Thousand Island Bridge Authority&#x27;s restoration efforts. The basement is mostly unfinished, with a swimming pool, many compartments, and a long tunnel passage to the Power House. At the edge of the island, a large peristyle archway stands as the intended original entrance way for boats to Heart island. The bridge connecting the two sides would have been raised and lowered as required.

The Power House is located on the eastern edge of the island, and was built to hold a generator to supply the island with power via steam generator. Exhibits inside describe how power was obtained in the early 1900s, and hosts a small display of historic photographs of Boldt Castle construction and the Thousand Islands region Nearly destroyed by a fire in the 1930s, the Power House was one of the first restoration projects completed after the Thousand Island Bridge Authority acquired it in 1977.

Alster Tower was modeled after a Rhineland defense tower in Germany and purposely constructed with slanting and uneven walls, ceilings, and roofs. This unique structure sits on the south side of the island facing Alexandria Bay, and boasts a two-lane bowling alley and stage for performances. The Alster Tower cafe is one of the restoration projects currently taking place on the island.

The George C. Boldt Yacht House on nearby Wellesley Island represents the only remaining wooden yacht house structure of this kind. The interior features extensive living quarters and a number of antique and wooden boats. For an additional admission fee, visitors can take a shuttle from Heart Island to the Yacht House on Wellesley Island to tour these exhibits. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1978.

The 1969 children&#x27;s novel &quot;Secret Castle&quot; by Anne Colver is about the castle and Alexandria Bay.

Thompson became a high school coach in Washington, D.C., before coaching Georgetown for 27 seasons. He worked as a radio and television sports commentator after his retirement from coaching. Thompson earned a master&#x27;s degree in Counseling and Guidance at the University of the District of Columbia (UDC). He also served as an employee at the center for 4-H and Youth Development at UDC.

==Early life==
Thompson was born and raised in Washington, D.C., and was a practicing Roman Catholic. As a child, his mother insisted on sending him to Catholic schools for the educational opportunities and academic challenges.

At Archbishop Carroll High School, Thompson emerged as a standout center, playing in three consecutive City Championship games (1958–60). In 1959, Carroll All-Mets Thompson, Monk Malloy, George Leftwich and Tom Hoover won over Cardozo 79–52. The next year, Thompson and Leftwich led the Lions over the Ollie Johnson/Dave Bing led Spingarn, 69–54. During his senior year, Thompson led Carroll to a 24–0 record, preserving their 48-game winning streak along the way. Carroll capped off the undefeated 1960 season with a 57–55 win over St Catherine&#x27;s Angels of Racine, Wisconsin in the Knights of Columbus National Championship Tournament with Thompson scoring a team-high 15 points and adding 12 rebounds.

He was voted to the all-tournament team and was later named a second-team &quot;Parade&quot; All-American.

==Playing career==
===Providence College===
After graduating from Archbishop Carroll, Thompson went to Providence College, where he played on the 1963 NIT Championship team with Ray Flynn, and was part of the first Providence NCAA tournament team in his senior year in 1964, when he received honorable mention from the Associated Press for its All-American team. Upon graduation, Thompson was the Friars&#x27; all-time leader in points, scoring average, and field goal percentage, and second in rebounds to former teammate Jim Hadnot.

===National Basketball Association===
He was selected in the third round of the 1964 NBA draft and played two seasons in the National Basketball Association (NBA) for the Boston Celtics from 1964 to 1966. At and , he backed up Bill Russell, the Celtics star center, en route to consecutive NBA championships. Nicknamed &quot;the Caddy&quot; for his secondary role to Russell, he averaged 3.5 points and 3.5 rebounds in 74 games played. Thompson was selected by the Chicago Bulls in the 1966 NBA expansion draft, but he decided to retire from playing instead of relocating to Chicago.

==Coaching career==
===Georgetown===

Thompson was a guidance counselor and head coach at St. Anthony High School in Washington, D.C. from 1966 to 1972, compiling a 122–28 record. He left St. Anthony for Georgetown University, who chose him over more experienced candidates Morgan Wootten and George Raveling.

Inheriting a Hoyas team which had been 3–23 the year before, Thompson led the Hoyas to a .500 record by his second season. By his third season in 1974–75, Georgetown qualified for the NCAA tournament for the first time since 1943. Over 27 years, Thompson&#x27;s Hoyas went 596–239 (), running off a streak of 24 postseason appearances – 20 in the NCAA tournament and 4 in the NIT – including a 14-year streak of NCAA appearances from 1979 to 1992 that saw three Final Four appearances in 1982, 1984 and 1985. The 1984 squad, led by center Patrick Ewing, won the Division I national championship over Houston, and Thompson became the first African-American coach to lead his team to the title. Two years earlier, Thompson had become the first Black coach to advance their team to the Final Four. Georgetown missed repeating as champs in 1985, losing in the finals to underdog Villanova.

An imposing figure on the sidelines who towered over many opposing coaches and even players, Thompson was noted for a trademark white towel that he carried on his shoulder during the games, which he did as a tribute to his mother. He won seven Coach of the Year awards: Big East (1980, 1987, 1992), United States Basketball Writers Association (1982), The Sporting News (1984), National Association of Basketball Coaches (1985), and United Press International (1987). Thompson coached many notable players, including Ewing, Sleepy Floyd, Alonzo Mourning, Dikembe Mutombo, and Allen Iverson. Under Thompson, 26 players were chosen in the NBA draft; eight were drafted in the first round, including two players selected first overall: Ewing and Iverson. Thompson also insisted on top academic performance from his players and maintained a 97% graduation rate among the team.

====Confronting drug lord====
In the late 1980s, Thompson got word that several of his players, including Alonzo Mourning, were associating with noted Washington, D.C. drug lord and avid Hoya fan Rayful Edmond III, whose crew was connected to at least forty homicides. At the height of his empire, Edmond became very friendly with several Hoyas players. When Thompson confirmed what was happening, he sent word through his sources to have Edmond meet him at his office at McDonough Gymnasium.

When Edmond arrived, Thompson was initially cordial, and informed Edmond that he needed to cease all contacts with his players post haste, specifically John Turner and Mourning, both of whom had befriended Edmond. When Edmond tried to assure him that his players were not involved in anything illegal, the 6&#x27;10&quot; Thompson stood up and pointed his index finger between Edmond&#x27;s eyes. Thompson, known for his volatility, quickly boiled over, and unleashed a profanity-laced tirade in which he told Edmond that he did not care about his crew&#x27;s violent reputation or propensity to commit murder. Edmond had crossed a line with Thompson&#x27;s players, and Thompson was not going to allow Edmond to destroy the players&#x27; lives.

At the publishing of his autobiography, however, it was revealed that the conversation between Edmond and Thompson was not as confrontational as once believed. &quot;A myth has grown about me threatening Rayful and ordering him to stay away from my players. Some people like to say I stood over him and pointed my finger in his face. That&#x27;s nonsense. That myth is based on the perception of me as intimidating and a bully. Like when I argued with refs, I supposedly scared them.

Edmond never associated with another Hoyas player on a personal level, and Thompson was the only person to stand up to Edmond without consequence, initially causing some shock and surprise that there was no reprisal.

===U.S. national team===
Thompson was an assistant coach for the U.S. national team on its gold medal-winning 1976 Olympic team. He was later the head coach of the 1988 Olympic team, the Americans&#x27; last fully collegiate squad. Although favored to win the international tournament, the United States was narrowly defeated by the all-professional and experienced Soviet Union in the semifinals 82–76, marking the first time the Americans did not reach the gold medal game. The United States won its final game against Australia to capture the bronze medal, the lowest finish by an American team for men&#x27;s basketball.

===Protest against Proposition 42===
On January 14, 1989, before the start of Georgetown&#x27;s home game against Boston College, Thompson walked off the Capital Centre floor and turned coaching duties over to assistant Mike Riley. Thompson was protesting the NCAA&#x27;s Proposition 42, which would have denied athletic scholarships to student athletes who failed to qualify academically under standards of the already in effect Proposition 48. Thompson expressed concerns that the proposal would leave many student athletes without a means of paying for their education, as well as what he felt would be the proposal&#x27;s disproportionate impact on Black athletes.

===Resignation===
On January 8, 1999, Thompson announced his resignation as Georgetown&#x27;s head coach, citing marriage problems. He was replaced by longtime assistant Craig Esherick. Thompson was inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame on October 1, 1999.

Esherick was fired in 2004 and replaced by John Thompson III, Thompson&#x27;s eldest son. At the time the elder Thompson was serving Georgetown in what Rev. Leo J. O&#x27;Donovan, university president, referred to as a &quot;coach &quot;emeritus&quot;&quot; position, assisting on academic, athletic, and community projects. John Thompson III coached Georgetown until 2017.

John Thompson Jr.&#x27;s younger son, Ronny Thompson, formerly an assistant coach at Georgetown, was the head coach at Ball State.

==Post-coaching career==
After retiring from coaching, Thompson became the presidential consultant for urban affairs at Georgetown University, a basketball commentator for TNT, and host of a sports talk show, &quot;The John Thompson Show&quot;, on WTEM in Washington, D.C. He signed a lifetime contract with Clear Channel Radio and WTEM in 2006. Working with Rick Walker, Thompson remained on the show until 2012.

Thompson was scheduled to be on American Airlines Flight 77 on September 11, 2001, which was hijacked and crashed into the Pentagon in the September 11 attacks. He was scheduled to appear on Jim Rome&#x27;s radio show in Los Angeles and wished to fly on September 11 and attend a friend&#x27;s birthday party in Las Vegas on the 13th. After Rome&#x27;s producer told Thompson that his plans would not work for the show, assuring him that he would be able to travel from Los Angeles to Las Vegas immediately after the show, he canceled his flight. Ten years later, on &quot;The Jim Rome Show,&quot; Thompson reunited with the producer who persuaded him not to take Flight 77.

Georgetown University&#x27;s John R. Thompson Intercollegiate Athletic Center was completed in 2016. The lobby includes a statue of Thompson.

Thompson&#x27;s autobiography, &quot;I Came as a Shadow&quot;, was published posthumously in December 2020. Thompson died at his home in Arlington County, Virginia on August 30, 2020, three days before his 79th birthday.

<doc id="780760" wikidata="Q251211" url="?curid=780760" title="Spanish dialects and varieties">
<text>Some of the regional varieties of the Spanish language are quite divergent from one another, especially in pronunciation and vocabulary, and less so in grammar.

While all Spanish dialects adhere to approximately the same written standard, all spoken varieties differ from the written variety, to different degrees. There are differences between European Spanish (also called Peninsular Spanish) and the Spanish of the Americas, as well as many different dialect areas both within Spain and within the Americas. Chilean and Honduran Spanish have been identified by various linguists as the most divergent varieties.

Prominent differences in pronunciation among dialects of Spanish include:
# the maintenance or lack of distinction between the phonemes and ( vs. and );
# the maintenance or loss of distinction between phonemes represented orthographically by &quot;ll&quot; and &quot;y&quot; ();
# the maintenance of syllable-final vs. its weakening to (called aspiration, or more precisely debuccalization), or its loss; and
# the tendency, in areas of central Mexico and of the Andean highlands, to reduction (especially devoicing), or loss, of unstressed vowels, mainly when they are in contact with voiceless consonants.
Among grammatical features, the most prominent variation among dialects is in the use of the second-person pronouns. In Hispanic America, the only second-person plural pronoun, for both formal and informal treatment, is , while in most of Spain the informal second-person plural pronoun is with used only in the formal treatment. For the second-person singular familiar pronoun, some American dialects use (and its associated verb forms), while others use either (see &quot;voseo&quot;) or both &quot;tú&quot; and (which, together with , can make for a possible three-tiered distinction of formalities).

There are significant differences in vocabulary among regional varieties of Spanish, particularly in the domains of food products, everyday objects, and clothes; and many American varieties show considerable lexical influence from Native American languages.

==Sets of variants==
While there is no broad consensus on how Latin American Spanish dialects should be classified, the following scheme which takes into account phonological, grammatical, socio-historical, and language contact data provides a reasonable approximation of Latin American dialect variation:

* Mexican (except coastal areas) and southwestern US (including New Mexican).
* Central American, including southeastern Mexico.
* Caribbean (Cuba, Venezuela, Puerto Rico, Dominican Republic, Panama, Caribbean Colombia, Trinidad and Caribbean and Pacific Coasts of Mexico).
* Inland Colombia and the speech of neighboring areas of Venezuela.
* Pacific coast of Colombia, Ecuador, and Peru
* Andean regions of Ecuador, Peru, Bolivia, southwestern Colombia, northwestern Argentina, and northeastern Chile.
* Chilean, including western Argentina.
* Paraguayan, including northeastern Argentina, and eastern Bolivia.
* Rioplatense (central-west Argentina and Uruguay).

While there are other types of regional variation in Peninsular Spanish, and the Spanish of bilingual regions shows influence from other languages, the greatest division in Old World varieties is from north to south, with a central-northern dialect north of Madrid, an Andalusian dialect to the south, and an intermediary region between the two most important dialect zones. Meanwhile, the Canary Islands constitute their own dialect cluster, whose speech is most closely related to that of western Andalusia.

The non-native Spanish in Equatorial Guinea and Western Sahara (formerly Spanish Sahara) has been influenced mainly by varieties from Spain. Spanish is also an official language in Equatorial Guinea, and many people speak it fluently.

Though no longer an official language in the Philippines, Philippine Spanish has had a tremendous influence on the native tongues of the archipelago, including Filipino.

The Spanish spoken in Gibraltar is essentially not different from the neighboring areas in Spain, except for code-switching with English and some unique vocabulary items. It is frequently blended with English as a sort of Spanglish known as Llanito.

Judaeo-Spanish, a &quot;Jewish language&quot;, encompasses a number of linguistic varieties based mostly on 15th-century Spanish; it is still spoken in a few small communities, mainly in Israel, but also in Turkey and a number of other countries. As Jews have migrated since their expulsion from Iberia, the language has picked up several loan words from other languages and developed unique forms of spelling, grammar, and syntax. It can be considered either a very divergent dialect of Spanish, retaining features from Old Spanish, or a separate language.

==Pronunciation==

===Distinción vs. seseo and ceceo===
The distinction between and is maintained in northern Spain (in all positions) and in south-central Spain (only in syllable onset), while the two phonemes are not distinguished in the Americas, the Canary Islands, the Philippines and much of Andalusia. The maintenance of phonemic contrast is called &quot;distinción&quot; in Spanish. In areas that do not distinguish them, they are typically realized as , though in parts of southern Andalusia the realization is closer to ; in Spain uniform use of is called and uniform use of [s] &quot;&quot;.

In dialects with the words (&#x27;house&#x27;) and (&#x27;hunt&#x27;) are pronounced as homophones (generally ), whereas in dialects with they are pronounced differently (as and respectively). The symbol stands for a voiceless sibilant like the &quot;s&quot; of English &quot;sick&quot;, while represents a voiceless interdental fricative like the &quot;th&quot; of English &quot;think&quot;.

In some cases where the phonemic merger would render words homophonic in the Americas, one member of the pair is frequently replaced by a synonym or derived form—e.g. replaced by , or (&#x27;to boil&#x27;), homophonic with (&#x27;to sew&#x27;), replaced by . For more on &quot;seseo&quot;, see González-Bueno.

===Yeísmo===
Traditionally Spanish had a phonemic distinction between (a palatal lateral approximant, written &quot;ll&quot;) and (a palatal approximant, written &quot;y&quot;). But for most speakers in Spain and the Americas, these two phonemes have been merged in the phoneme . This merger results in the words (&#x27;silenced&#x27;) and (&#x27;fell&#x27;) being pronounced the same, whereas they remain distinct in dialects that have not undergone the merger. The use of the merged phoneme is called &quot;yeísmo&quot;.

In Spain, the distinction is preserved in some rural areas and smaller cities of the north, while in South America the contrast is characteristic of bilingual areas where Quechua languages and other indigenous languages that have the sound in their inventories are spoken (this is the case of inland Peru and Bolivia), and in Paraguay.

The phoneme can be pronounced in a variety of ways, depending on the dialect. In most of the area where &quot;yeísmo&quot; is present, the merged phoneme is pronounced as the approximant , and also, in word-initial positions, an affricate . In the area around the Río de la Plata (Argentina, Uruguay), this phoneme is pronounced as a palatoalveolar sibilant fricative, either as voiced or, especially by young speakers, as voiceless .

===Variants of ===
One of the most distinctive features of the Spanish variants is the pronunciation of when it is not &quot;aspirated&quot; to or elided. In northern and central Spain, and in the Paisa Region of Colombia, as well as in some other, isolated dialects (e.g. some inland areas of Peru and Bolivia), the sibilant realization of is an apico-alveolar retracted fricative , a sound transitional between laminodental and palatal . However, in most of Andalusia, in a few other areas in southern Spain, and in most of Latin America it is instead pronounced as a lamino-alveolar or dental sibilant. The phoneme is realized as or before voiced consonants when it is not aspirated to or elided; is a sound transitional between and . Before voiced consonants, [ ~ ] is more common in natural and colloquial speech and oratorical pronunciation, [s ~ ] is mostly pronounced in emphatic and slower speech.

In the rest of the article, the distinction is ignored and the symbols are used for all alveolar fricatives.

===Debuccalization of coda ===

In much of Latin America—especially in the Caribbean and in coastal and lowland areas of Central and South America—and in the southern half of Spain, syllable-final is either pronounced as a voiceless glottal fricative, (debuccalization, also frequently called &quot;aspiration&quot;), or not pronounced at all. In some varieties of Latin American Spanish (notably Honduran and Salvadoran Spanish and Llanero Spanish in between Colombia and Venezuela), this may also occur intervocalically within an individual word—as with , which may be pronounced as —or even in initial position. In southeastern Spain (eastern Andalusia, Murcia and part of La Mancha), the distinction between syllables with a now-silent &quot;s&quot; and those originally without &quot;s&quot; is preserved by pronouncing the syllables ending in &quot;s&quot; with (that is, the open/closed syllable contrast has been turned into a tense/lax vowel contrast); this typically affects the vowels , and , but in some areas even and are affected, turning into . For instance, &quot;&quot; (&#x27;all the swans are white&#x27;), can be pronounced , or even (Standard Peninsular Spanish: , Latin American Spanish: ). This vowel contrast is sometimes reinforced by vowel harmony, so that &quot;casas&quot; &#x27;houses&#x27; differs from &quot;casa&quot; not only by the lack of the final in the former word but also in the quality of both of the vowels. For those areas of southeastern Spain where the deletion of final is complete, and where the distinction between singular and plural of nouns depends entirely on vowel quality, it has been argued that a set of phonemic splits has occurred, resulting in a system with eight vowel phonemes in place of the standard five.

In the dialects that feature &quot;s-aspiration&quot;, it works as a sociolinguistic variable, [h] being more common in natural and colloquial speech, whereas [s] tends to be pronounced in emphatic and slower speech. In oratorical pronunciation, it depends on the country and speaker; if the Spanish speaker chooses to pronounces all or most of syllable-final [s], it is mostly voiced to [] before voiced consonants.

===Vowel reduction===
Although the vowels of Spanish are relatively stable from one dialect to another, the phenomenon of vowel reduction—devoicing or even loss—of unstressed vowels in contact with voiceless consonants, especially , can be observed in the speech of central Mexico (including Mexico City). For example, it can be the case that the words (&#x27;pesos [money]&#x27;), (&#x27;weights&#x27;), and (&#x27;fish [pl.]&#x27;) sound nearly the same, as . One may hear (&#x27;well (then)&#x27;) pronounced . Some efforts to explain this vowel reduction link it to the strong influence of Nahuatl and other Native American languages in Mexican Spanish.

===Pronunciation of &quot;j&quot;===

In the 16th century, as the Spanish colonization of the Americas was beginning, the phoneme now represented by the letter &quot;j&quot; had begun to change its place of articulation from palato-alveolar to palatal and to velar , like German &quot;ch&quot; in &quot;Bach&quot; (see History of Spanish and Old Spanish language). In southern Spanish dialects and in those Hispanic American dialects strongly influenced by southern settlers (e.g. Caribbean Spanish), rather than the velar fricative , the sound was backed all the way to , like English &quot;h&quot; in &quot;hope&quot;. Glottal is nowadays the standard pronunciation for &quot;j&quot; in Caribbean dialects (Cuban, Dominican, and Puerto Rican) as well as in mainland Venezuela, in most Colombian dialects excepting Pastuso dialect that belongs to a continuum with Ecuadorian Spanish, much of Central America, southern Mexico, the Canary Islands, Extremadura and western Andalusia in Spain. In the rest of Spain, alternates with a uvular fricative allophone , which may also be trilled . In the rest of the Americas, the velar fricative is prevalent. In Chile, is fronted to (like German &quot;ch&quot; in &quot;ich&quot;) when it precedes the front vowels and : , ; in other phonological environments it is pronounced or [h].

For the sake of simplicity, these are given a broad transcription in the rest of the article.

===Word-final &quot;-n&quot;===
In standard European Spanish, as well as in many dialects in the Americas (e.g. standard Argentine or Rioplatense, inland Colombian, and Mexican), word-final is, by default (i.e. when followed by a pause or by an initial vowel in the following word), alveolar, like English in &quot;pen&quot;. When followed by a consonant, it assimilates to that consonant&#x27;s place of articulation, becoming dental, interdental, palatal, or velar. In some dialects, however, word-final without a following consonant is pronounced as a velar nasal (like the &quot;-ng&quot; of English &quot;long&quot;), and may produce vowel nasalization. In these dialects, words such as (&#x27;bread&#x27;) and (&#x27;well&#x27;) may sound like &quot;pang&quot; and &quot;byeng&quot; to English-speakers. Velar &quot;-n&quot; is common in many parts of Spain (Galicia, León, Asturias, Murcia, Extremadura, Andalusia, and Canary Islands). In the Americas, velar &quot;-n&quot; is prevalent in all Caribbean dialects, Central American dialects, the coastal areas of Colombia, Venezuela, much of Ecuador, Peru, and northern Chile.
This velar &quot;-n&quot; likely originated in the northwest of Spain, and from there spread to Andalusia and then the Americas.
Loss of final &quot;-n&quot; with strong nasalization of the preceding vowel is not infrequent in all those dialects where velar &quot;-n&quot; exists. In much of Ecuador, Peru, Venezuela (except for the Andean region) and Dominican Spanish, any pre-consonantal nasal can be realized ; thus, a word like &quot;ambientación&quot; can be pronounced .

===&quot;R&quot; sounds===
All varieties of Spanish distinguish between a &quot;single-R&quot; and a &quot;double-R&quot; phoneme. The single-R phoneme corresponds to the letter &quot;r&quot; written once (except when word-initial or following &quot;l&quot;, &quot;n&quot;, or &quot;s&quot;) and is pronounced as , an alveolar flap—like American English &quot;tt&quot; in &quot;better&quot;—in virtually all dialects. The single-R/double-R contrast is neutralized in syllable-final position, and in some dialects these phonemes also lose their contrast with , so a word such as may sound like &quot;altesanía&quot;. This neutralization or &quot;leveling&quot; of coda and is frequent in dialects of southern Spain, the Caribbean, Venezuela and coastal Colombia.

The double-R phoneme is spelled &quot;rr&quot; between vowels (as in &quot;carro&quot; &#x27;car&#x27;) and &quot;r&quot; word-initially (e.g. rey&quot; &#x27;king&#x27;, ropa&quot; &#x27;clothes&#x27;) or following &quot;l&quot;, &quot;n&quot;, or &quot;s&quot; (e.g. &quot;alrededor&quot; &#x27;around&#x27;, &quot;enriquecer&quot; &#x27;enrich&#x27;, &quot;enrollar&quot; &#x27;roll up&#x27;, &quot;enrolar&quot; &#x27;enroll&#x27;, &quot;honra&quot; &#x27;honor&#x27;, &quot;Conrado&quot; &#x27;Conrad&#x27;, &quot;Israel&quot; &#x27;Israel&#x27;). In most varieties it is pronounced as an alveolar trill , and that is considered the prestige pronunciation. Two notable variants occur additionally: one sibilant and the other velar or uvular. The trill is also found in lexical derivations (morpheme-initial positions), and prefixation with &quot;sub&quot; and &quot;ab&quot;: &quot;abrogado&quot; , &#x27;abrogated&#x27;, &quot;subrayar&quot; , &#x27;to underline&#x27;. The same goes for the compound word &quot;ciudadrealeño&quot; (from &quot;Ciudad Real&quot;). However, after vowels, the initial &quot;r&quot; of the root becomes &quot;rr&quot; in prefixed or compound words: &quot;prorrogar, infrarrojo, autorretrato, arriesgar, puertorriqueño, Monterrey.&quot; In syllable-final position, inside a word, the tap is more frequent, but the trill can also occur (especially in emphatic or oratorical style) with no semantic difference, especially before &quot;l&quot;, &quot;m&quot;, &quot;n&quot;, &quot;s&quot;, &quot;t&quot;, or &quot;d&quot;—thus &quot;arma&quot; (&#x27;weapon&#x27;) may be either (tap) or (trill), &quot;perla&quot; (&#x27;pearl&#x27;) may be either or , &quot;invierno&quot; (&#x27;winter&#x27;) may be or , &quot;verso&quot; (&#x27;verse&#x27;) may be or , and &quot;verde&quot; (&#x27;green&#x27;) or . In &quot;word&quot;-final position the rhotic will usually be: either a trill or a tap when followed by a consonant or a pause, as in &quot;amo&quot; &quot;paterno&quot; &#x27;paternal love&#x27;) and &quot;amo&quot;, with the tap being more frequent and the trill before &quot;l&quot;, &quot;m&quot;, &quot;n&quot;, &quot;s&quot;, &quot;t&quot;, &quot;d&quot;, or sometimes a pause; or a tap when followed by a vowel-initial word, as in &quot;amo&quot; &quot;eterno&quot; &#x27;eternal love&#x27;) (Can be a trill or tap with a temporary glottal stop in emphatic speech: &quot;amo&quot; &quot;eterno&quot;, with trill being more common). Morphologically, a word-final rhotic always corresponds to the tapped in related words. Thus, the word &quot;olor&quot; &#x27;smell&#x27; is related to &quot;olores, oloroso&quot; &#x27;smells, smelly&#x27; and not to &quot;*olorres, *olorroso&quot;, and the word &quot;taller&quot; &#x27;workshop&#x27; is related to &quot;talleres&quot; &#x27;workshops&#x27; and not to &quot;*tallerres&quot;. When two rhotics occur consecutively across a word or prefix boundary, they result in one trill, so that &quot;da rosas&quot; (&#x27;s/he gives roses&#x27;) and &quot;dar rosas&quot; (&#x27;give roses&#x27;) are either neutralized, or distinguished by a longer trill in the latter phrase, which may be transcribed as or (although this is transcribed with in , even though it differs from purely by length); &quot;da rosas&quot; and &quot;dar rosas&quot; may be distinguished as vs. , or they may fall together as the former.

The pronunciation of the double-R phoneme as a voiced strident (or sibilant) apical fricative is common in New Mexico, Guatemala, Costa Rica, Ecuador, Bolivia, Chile, and Paraguay; in western and northern Argentina; and among older speakers in highland areas of Colombia. 
Some linguists have attempted to explain the assibilated &quot;rr&quot; (written in IPA as []) as a result of influence from Native American languages, and it is true that in the Andean regions mentioned an important part of the population is bilingual in Spanish and one or another indigenous language. Nonetheless, other researchers have pointed out that sibilant &quot;rr&quot; in the Americas may not be an autonomous innovation, but rather a pronunciation that originated in some northern Spanish dialects and then was exported to the Americas. Spanish dialects spoken in the Basque Country, Navarre, La Rioja, and northern Aragon (regions that contributed substantially to Spanish-American colonization) show the fricative or postalveolar variant for &quot;rr&quot; (especially for the word-initial &quot;rr&quot; sound, as in &quot;Roma&quot; or &quot;rey&quot;). This is also pronounced voiceless when the consonants after the trill are voiceless and speaking in emphatic speech; it is written as [], it sounds like a simultaneous and . In Andean regions, the alveolar trill is realized as an alveolar approximant or even as a voiced apico-alveolar , and it is quite common in inland Ecuador, Peru, most of Bolivia and in parts of northern Argentina and Paraguay. The alveolar approximant realization is particularly associated with the substrate of Native American languages, as is the assibilation of to in Ecuador and Bolivia. Assibilated trill is also found in dialects in the /sr/ sequence wherein /s/ is unaspirated, example: &quot;las rosas&quot; (&#x27;the roses&#x27;), &quot;Israel&quot; . The assibilated trill in this example is sometimes pronounced voiceless in emphatic and slower speech: &quot;las rosas&quot; (&#x27;the roses&#x27;), &quot;Israel&quot; .
The other major variant for the &quot;rr&quot; phoneme—common in Puerto Rico and the Dominican Republic—is articulated at the back of the mouth, either as a glottal followed by a voiceless apical trill [] or, especially in Puerto Rico, with a posterior articulation that ranges variously from a velar fricative to a uvular trill . Canfield describes it as a voiceless uvular trill . These realizations for &quot;rr&quot; maintain their contrast with the phoneme , as the latter tends to be realized as a soft glottal : compare &quot;Ramón&quot; (&#x27;Raymond&#x27;) with &quot;jamón&quot; (&#x27;ham&#x27;).

In Puerto Rico, syllable-final can be realized as (probably an influence of American English), aside from , , and , so that &quot;verso&quot; (&#x27;verse&#x27;) becomes , alongside , , or ; &quot;invierno&quot; (&#x27;winter&#x27;) becomes , alongside , , or ; and &quot;parlamento&quot; (parliament) becomes , alongside , , or . In word-final position, the realization of depends on whether it is followed by a consonant-initial word or a pause, on the one hand, or by a vowel-initial word, on the other:

* Before a consonant or pause: a trill, a tap, an approximant, the lateral , or elided, as in &quot;amo&quot; &quot;paterno&quot; (&#x27;paternal love&#x27;).
* Before a vowel: a tap, an approximant, or the lateral , as in &quot;amo&quot; &quot;eterno&quot; (&#x27;eternal love&#x27;).

The same situation happens in Belize and the Archipelago of San Andrés, Providencia and Santa Catalina, in these cases an influence of British English.

Although in most Spanish-speaking territories and regions, guttural or uvular realizations of /r/ are considered a speech defect, back variants for (, or ) are widespread in rural Puerto Rican Spanish and in the dialect of Ponce, whereas they are heavily stigmatized in the dialect of the capital San Juan. To a lesser extent, velar variants of are found in some rural Cuban (Yateras, Guantánamo Province) and Dominican vernaculars (Cibao, eastern rural regions of the country).

In Paraguay, syllable-final is pronounced as before &quot;l&quot; or &quot;s&quot; and word-final position, influenced by a substrate from Native American languages.

In Chile, as in Andalusia, the archiphoneme in the sequence is sometimes assimilated to in lower-class speakers, and sometimes in educated speakers. Thus, &quot;jornada&quot; &#x27;workday&#x27; may be pronounced .

Additionally, in the Basque-speaking areas of Spain, the uvular articulation for , , has a higher prevalence among bilinguals than among Spanish monolinguals.

===Pronunciation of &quot;x&quot;===
The letter &quot;x&quot; usually represents the phoneme sequence . An exception to this is the pronunciation of the &quot;x&quot; in some place names, especially in Mexico, such as and the name itself, reflecting an older spelling (see &quot;Name of Mexico&quot;). Some personal names, such as &quot;Javier&quot;, &quot;Jiménez&quot;, &quot;Rojas&quot;, etc., also are occasionally spelled with &quot;X&quot;: &quot;Xavier&quot;, &quot;Ximénez&quot;, &quot;Roxas&quot;, etc., where the letter is pronounced . A small number of words in Mexican Spanish retain the historical pronunciation, e.g. .

There are two possible pronunciations of in standard speech: the first one is , with a voiceless plosive, but it is commonly realized as instead (hence the phonemic transcription ). Voicing is not contrastive in the syllable coda, so these different pronunciations do not change the meanings of words.

In dialects with &quot;seseo&quot;, &quot;c&quot; following &quot;x&quot; pronounced is deleted, yielding pronunciations such as for .

===Adoption of the affricates &quot;tz&quot; and &quot;tl&quot;===
Mexican Spanish and some other Latin American dialects have adopted from the native languages the voiceless alveolar affricate and many words with the cluster (originally an affricate ) represented by the respective digraphs and , as in the names Azcapotzalco and Tlaxcala. is a valid onset cluster in Latin America, with the exception of Puerto Rico, in the Canary Islands, and in the northwest of Spain, including Bilbao and Galicia. In these dialects, words of Greek and Latin origin with , such as and , are also pronounced with onset : , . In other dialects, the corresponding phonemic sequence is (where is the onset), with the coda realized variously as and . The usual pronunciation of those words in most of Spain is and .

The sound also occurs in European Spanish in loanwords of Basque origin (but only learned loanwords, not those inherited from Roman times), as in &quot;abertzale&quot;. In colloquial Castilian it may be replaced by or . In Bolivian, Paraguayan, and Coastal Peruvian Spanish, also occurs in loanwords of Japanese origin.

===Other loaned phonetics===
Spanish has a fricative for loanwords of origins from native languages in Mexican Spanish, loanwords of French, German and English origin in Chilean Spanish, loanwords of Italian, Galician, French, German and English origin in Rioplatense Spanish and Venezuelan Spanish, Chinese loanwords in Coastal Peruvian Spanish, Japanese loanwords in Bolivian Spanish, Paraguayan Spanish, Coastal Peruvian Spanish, Basque loanwords in Castilian Spanish (but only learned loanwords, not those inherited from Roman times), and English loanwords in Puerto Rican Spanish and all dialects. 

===Pronunciation of &quot;ch&quot;===
The Spanish digraph &quot;ch&quot; (the phoneme ) is pronounced in most dialects. However, it is pronounced as a fricative in some Andalusian dialects, New Mexican Spanish, some varieties of northern Mexican Spanish, informal and sometimes formal Panamanian Spanish, and informal Chilean Spanish. In Chilean Spanish this pronunciation is viewed as undesirable, while in Panama it occurs among educated speakers. In Madrid and among upper- and middle-class Chilean speakers, it can be pronounced as the alveolar affricate .

===Open-mid and open front vowels===

In some dialects of southeastern Spain (Murcia, eastern Andalusia and a few adjoining areas) where the weakening of final leads to its disappearance, the &quot;silent&quot; continues to have an effect on the preceding vowel, opening the mid vowels and to and respectively, and fronting the open central vowel toward . Thus the singular/plural distinction in nouns and adjectives is maintained by means of the vowel quality: 
* &quot;libro&quot; &#x27;book&#x27;, but &quot;libros&quot; &#x27;books&#x27;. 
* &quot;libre&quot; &#x27;free, &quot;singular&quot; &#x27;, but &quot;libres&quot; &#x27;free, &quot;plural&quot;&#x27;.
* &quot;libra&quot; &#x27;pound&#x27;, but &quot;libras&quot; &#x27;pounds&#x27;.

Furthermore, this opening of final mid vowels can affect other vowels earlier in the word, as an instance of metaphony:

* &quot;lobo&quot; &#x27;wolf&#x27;, but &quot;lobos&quot; &#x27;wolves&#x27;.

(In the remaining dialects, the mid vowels have nondistinctive open and closed allophones determined by the shape of the syllable or by contact with neighboring phonemes. See Spanish phonology.)

===Post-tonic &quot;e&quot; and &quot;o&quot;===
Final, non-stressed and may be raised to and respectively in some rural areas of Spain and Latin America. Examples include &#x27;night&#x27;, . In Spain, this is mainly found in Galicia and other northern areas. This type of raising carries negative prestige.

===Judaeo-Spanish===
Judaeo-Spanish (often called &quot;Ladino&quot;) refers to the Romance dialects spoken by Jews whose ancestors were expelled from Spain near the end of the 15th century.

These dialects have important phonological differences compared to varieties of Spanish proper; for example, they have preserved the voiced/voiceless distinction among sibilants as they were in Old Spanish. For this reason, the letter , when written single between vowels, corresponds to a voiced —e.g. (&#x27;rose&#x27;). Where is not between vowels and is not followed by a voiced consonant, or when it is written double, it corresponds to voiceless —thus (&#x27;to sit down&#x27;). And due to a phonemic neutralization similar to the &quot;seseo&quot; of other dialects, the Old Spanish voiced and the voiceless have merged, respectively, with and —while maintaining the voicing contrast between them. Thus (&#x27;to make&#x27;) has gone from the medieval to , and (&#x27;town square&#x27;) has gone from to .

A related dialect is Haketia, the Judaeo-Spanish of northern Morocco. This too tended to assimilate with modern Spanish, during the Spanish occupation of the region.
Tetuani Ladino was brought to Oran in Algeria.

=== Intonation ===

Patterns of intonation differ significantly according to dialect, and native speakers of Spanish use intonation to quickly identify different accents. To give some examples, intonation patterns differ between Peninsular and Mexican Spanish, and also between northern Mexican Spanish and accents of the center and south of the country. Argentine Spanish is also characterized by its unique intonation patterns which are supposed to be influenced by the languages of Italy, particularly Neapolitan. Language contact can affect intonation as well, as the Spanish spoken in Cuzco and Mallorca show influence from Quechua and Catalan intonation patterns, respectively, and distinct intonation patterns are found in some ethnically homogenous Afro-Latino communities. Additionally, some scholars have historically argued that indigenous languages influenced the development of Latin America&#x27;s regional intonation patterns.

==Grammar==

===Second-person pronouns and verbs===
Spanish is a language with a &quot;T–V distinction&quot; in the second person, meaning that there are different pronouns corresponding to &quot;you&quot; which express different degrees of formality. In most varieties, there are two degrees, namely &quot;formal&quot; and &quot;familiar&quot; (the latter is also called &quot;informal&quot;).

For the second person &quot;formal&quot;, virtually all Spanish dialects of Spain and the Americas use and (singular and plural respectively). But for the second person &quot;familiar&quot;, there is regional variation—between and for the singular, and, separately, between and for the plural. The use of &quot;vos&quot; (and its corresponding verb forms) rather than &quot;tú&quot; is called &quot;voseo&quot;.

Each of the second-person pronouns has its historically corresponding verb forms, used by most speakers. Most speakers use both the pronoun &quot;vos&quot; and its historically corresponding verb forms (e.g. &quot;vos &quot;, &#x27;you have&#x27;). But some dialects use the pronoun &quot;tú&quot; with &quot;&quot;vos&quot; verb forms&quot; (verbal &quot;voseo&quot;—&quot;tú &quot;), while others use &quot;vos&quot; with &quot;&quot;tú&quot; verb forms&quot; (pronominal &quot;voseo&quot;—&quot;vos &quot;).

====Second-person singular====

In most dialects the familiar second person singular pronoun is &quot;tú&quot; (from Latin &quot;tū&quot;), and the formal pronoun is &quot;usted&quot; (usually considered to originate from &quot; &quot;, meaning &#x27;your grace&#x27; or, literally, &#x27;your mercy&#x27;). In a number of regions in the Americas, &quot;tú&quot; is replaced by another pronoun, &quot;vos&quot;, and the verb conjugation changes accordingly (see details below). Spanish &quot;vos&quot; comes from Latin &quot;vōs&quot;, the second person &quot;plural&quot; pronoun in Latin.

In any case, there is wide variation as to when each pronoun (formal or familiar) is used. In Spain, &quot;tú&quot; is familiar (for example, used with friends), and &quot;usted&quot; is formal (for example, used with older people). In recent times, there has been a noticeable tendency to extend the use of &quot;tú&quot; even in situations previously reserved for &quot;usted&quot;. Meanwhile, in several countries (in parts of Middle America, especially, Costa Rica and Colombia), the formal &quot;usted&quot; is also used to denote a closer personal relationship. Many Colombians and some Chileans, for instance, use &quot;usted&quot; for a child to address a parent and also for a parent to address a child. Some countries, such as Cuba and the Dominican Republic, prefer the use of &quot;tú&quot; even in very formal circumstances, and &quot;usted&quot; is seldom used.

Meanwhile, in other countries, the use of formal rather than familiar second-person pronouns denotes authority. In Peru, for example, senior military officers use &quot;tú&quot; to speak to their subordinates, but junior officers use only &quot;usted&quot; to address their superior officers.

Using the familiar &quot;tú&quot;, especially in contexts where &quot;usted&quot; was to be expected, is called . The corresponding verb is (a transitive verb, the direct object being the person addressed with the pronoun). The verb &quot;tutear&quot; is used even in those dialects whose familiar pronoun is &quot;vos&quot; and means &#x27;to treat with the familiar second-person pronoun&#x27;.

Pronominal voseo, the use of the pronoun &quot;vos&quot; instead of &quot;tú&quot;, is the prevalent form of the familiar second person singular pronoun in Guatemala, El Salvador, Honduras, Nicaragua, Costa Rica, Paraguay, Argentina and Uruguay. In those countries, it is used by many to address others in all kinds of contexts, often regardless of social status or age, including by cultured/educated speakers and writers, in television, advertisements, and even in translations from other languages. In Guatemala and Uruguay, &quot;vos&quot; and &quot;tú&quot; are used concurrently, but &quot;vos&quot; is much more common. Both pronouns use the verb forms normally associated with &quot;vos&quot; (&quot;vos &quot; / &quot;tú querés&quot;, &#x27;you want&#x27;).

The name &quot;Rioplatense&quot; is applied to the dialect of Spanish spoken around the mouth of the Río de la Plata and the lower course of the Paraná River, where &quot;vos&quot;, not &quot;tú&quot;, is invariably used, with the &quot;vos&quot; verb forms (&quot;vos tenés&quot;). The area comprises the most populous part of Argentina (the provinces of Buenos Aires and Santa Fe) as well as an important part of Uruguay, including Montevideo, the capital.

In Ecuador, &quot;vos&quot; is the most prominent form throughout the Sierra region of the country, though it does coexist with &quot;usted&quot; and the lesser-used &quot;tú&quot;. In this region, &quot;vos&quot; is regarded as the conversational norm, but it is not used in public discourse or the mass media. The choice of pronoun to be used depends on the participants&#x27; likeness in age and/or social status. Based on these factors, speakers can assess themselves as being equal, superior, or inferior to the addressee, and the choice of pronoun is made on this basis, sometimes resulting in a three-tiered system. Ecuadorians of the Highlands thus generally use &quot;vos&quot; among familiarized equals or by superiors (in both social status and age) to inferiors; &quot;tú&quot; among unfamiliarized equals, or by a superior in age but inferior in social status; and &quot;usted&quot; by both familiarized and unfamiliarized inferiors, or by a superior in social status but inferior in age. In the more populated coastal region, the form &quot;tú&quot; is used in most situations, &quot;usted&quot; being used only for unfamiliar and/or superior addressees.

&quot;Vos&quot; can be heard throughout most of Chile, Bolivia, and a small part of Peru as well, but in these places it is regarded as substandard. It is also used as the conversational norm in the Paisa Region and the southwest region of Colombia, in Zulia State (Venezuela), in Honduras, El Salvador, Costa Rica, Guatemala, and the state of Chiapas in Mexico.

In Chile, even though &quot;tú&quot; is the prestige pronoun among educated speakers, the use of &quot;verbal voseo&quot;, i.e. &quot;&quot;tú&quot; + verb conjugation of &quot;vos&quot;&quot; (e.g. &quot;tú &quot;) is widespread. On the other hand, &quot;pronominal voseo&quot;, the use of the pronoun &quot;vos&quot;—pronounced with aspiration of the final —is used derisively in informal speech between close friends as playful banter (usually among men) or, depending on the tone of voice, as an offensive comment.

In Colombia, the choice of second person singular varies with location. In most of inland Colombia (especially the Andean region), &quot;usted&quot; is the pronoun of choice for all situations, even in speaking between friends or family; but in large cities (especially Bogotá), the use of &quot;tú&quot; is becoming more accepted in informal situations, especially between young interlocutors of opposite sexes and among young women. In Valle del Cauca (Cali), Antioquia (Medellín) and the Pacific coast, the pronouns used are &quot;vos&quot; and &quot;usted&quot;. On the Caribbean coast (mainly Barranquilla and Cartagena), &quot;tú&quot; is used for practically all informal situations and many formal situations as well, &quot;usted&quot; being reserved for the most formal environments. A peculiarity occurs in the Altiplano Cundiboyacense and among some speakers in Bogotá: &quot;usted&quot; is replaced by for formal situations (it is relatively easy to identify a &quot;Boyacense&quot; by his/her use of this pronoun). &quot;Sumercé&quot; comes from &quot;su merced&quot; (&#x27;your mercy&#x27;).

In parts of Spain, a child used to use not &quot;tú&quot; but &quot;usted&quot; to address a parent. Today, however, this usage is unusual. Among the factors for the ongoing replacement of &quot;usted&quot; by &quot;tú&quot; are the new social relevance of youth and the reduction of social differences. In particular, it has been attributed to the egalitarianism of the right-wing Falange party. By contrast, Spanish leftists of the early 20th century would address their comrades as &quot;usted&quot; as a show of respect and workers&#x27; dignity.

According to Joan Coromines, by the 16th century, the use of &quot;vos&quot; (as a second person &quot;singular&quot; pronoun) had been reduced to rural areas of Spain, which were a source of many emigrants to the New World, and so &quot;vos&quot; became the unmarked form in many areas of Latin America.

A slightly different explanation is that in Spain, even if &quot;vos&quot; (as a singular) originally denoted the high social status of those who were addressed as such (monarchs, nobility, etc.), the people never used the pronoun themselves since there were few or no people above them in society. Those who used &quot;vos&quot; were people of the lower classes and peasants. When the waves of Spanish immigrants arrived to populate the New World, they primarily came from these lower classes. In the New World, wanting to raise their social status from what it was in Spain, they demanded to be addressed as &quot;vos&quot;.

Through the widespread use of &quot;vos&quot; in the Americas, the pronoun was transformed into an indicator of low status not only for the addresser but also for the addressee. Conversely, in Spain, &quot;vos&quot; is now considered a highly exalted archaism virtually confined to liturgy.

Speakers of Ladino still use &quot;vos&quot; as it was used in the Middle Ages, to address people higher on the social ladder. The pronoun &quot;usted&quot; had not been introduced to this dialect of Spanish when the Jews were expelled from Spain in 1492 so &quot;vos&quot; is still used in Ladino much as &quot;usted&quot; is used in modern Spanish.

A variant of &quot;usted&quot;, &quot;vusted&quot;, can be heard in Andean regions of South America. Other, less frequent forms analogous to &quot;usted&quot; are (short for &quot; &quot;), and &quot;usía&quot; (from &quot;vuestra &quot;).

There is a traditional assumption that Chilean and River Plate &quot;voseo&quot; verb forms are derived from those corresponding to &quot;vosotros&quot;. This assumption, however, has been challenged, in an article by —in the theoretical framework of classical generative phonology—as synchronically inadequate, on the grounds that it requires at least six different rules, including three monophthongization processes that lack phonological motivation. Alternatively, the article argues that the Chilean and River Plate &quot;voseo&quot; verb forms are synchronically derived from underlying representations that coincide with those corresponding to the non-honorific second person singular &quot;tú&quot;. The proposed theory requires the use of only one special rule in the case of Chilean &quot;voseo&quot;. This rule—along with other rules that are independently justified in the language—makes it possible to derive synchronically all Chilean and River Plate &quot;voseo&quot; verb forms in a straightforward manner. The article additionally solves the problem posed by the alternate verb forms of Chilean &quot;voseo&quot; such as the future indicative (e.g. &quot;vay a bailar&quot; &#x27;will you dance?&#x27;), the present indicative forms of &quot;haber&quot; (&quot;habih&quot; and &quot;hai&quot; &#x27;you have&#x27;), and the present indicative of &quot;ser&quot; (&quot;soi&quot;, &quot;eríh&quot; and &quot;erei&quot; &#x27;you are&#x27;), without resorting to any ad hoc rules.

====Second-person plural====
In Standard European Spanish the plural of &quot;tú&quot; is &quot;vosotros&quot; and the plural of &quot;usted&quot; is &quot;ustedes&quot;. In Hispanic America &quot;vosotros&quot; is not used, and the plural of both &quot;tú&quot; and &quot;usted&quot; is &quot;ustedes&quot;. This means that speaking to a group of friends a Spaniard will use &quot;vosotros&quot;, while a Latin American Spanish speaker will use &quot;ustedes&quot;. Although &quot;ustedes&quot; is semantically a second-person form, it is treated grammatically as a third-person plural form because it originates from the term &quot; &quot; (&#x27;your [pl.] mercies,&#x27; sing. &quot;vuestra merced&quot;).

The only vestiges of &quot;vosotros&quot; in the Americas are / in Papiamento and the use of &quot;vuestro/a&quot; in place of &quot; ( ustedes)&quot; as second person plural possessive in the Cusco region of Peru.

In very formal contexts, however, the &quot;vosotros&quot; conjugation can still be found. An example is the Mexican national anthem, which contains such forms as and .

The plural of the Colombian (Cundi-Boyacense Plateau) &quot;sumercé&quot; is &quot;sumercés/susmercedes&quot;, from &quot;sus mercedes&quot; (&#x27;your mercies&#x27;).

In some parts of Andalusia (the lands around the Guadalquivir river and western Andalusia), the usage is what is called &quot;ustedes-vosotros&quot;: the pronoun &quot;ustedes&quot; is combined with the verb forms for &quot;vosotros&quot;. However, this sounds extremely colloquial and most Andalusians prefer to use each pronoun with its correct form.

In Ladino, &quot;vosotros&quot; is still the only second person plural pronoun, since &quot;ustedes&quot; does not exist.

====Second-person verb forms====
Each second-person pronoun has its historically corresponding verb forms. The formal &quot;usted&quot; and &quot;ustedes&quot;, although semantically second person, take verb forms identical with those of the third person, singular and plural respectively, since they are derived from the third-person expressions &quot;vuestra merced&quot; and &quot;vuestras mercedes&quot; (&#x27;your grace[s]&#x27;). The forms associated with the singular &quot;vos&quot; can generally be derived from those for the plural &quot;vosotros&quot; by deleting the palatal semivowel of the ending (&quot;vosotros habláis&quot; &gt; &quot;vos hablás&quot;, &#x27;you speak&#x27;; &quot;vosotros coméis&quot; &gt; &quot;vos comés&quot;, &#x27;you eat&#x27;).

General statements about the use of &quot;voseo&quot; in different localities should be qualified by the note that individual speakers may be inconsistent in their usage, and that isoglosses rarely coincide with national borders. That said, a few assertions can be made:
* &quot;Full&quot; &quot;voseo&quot; (involving both pronoun and verb—&quot;vos comés&quot;, &#x27;you eat&#x27;) is characteristic of two zones: that of Argentina, Paraguay and Uruguay and that of Central America and the Mexican state of Chiapas.
* Pronominal &quot;voseo&quot; (&quot;vos tienes&quot;, &quot;vos dices&quot;, etc. but &quot;vos sos&quot;) is common in Santiago del Estero Province, Argentina
* &quot;Full&quot; &quot;voseo&quot; coexists with the use of &quot;tú&quot; and its verb forms (e.g. &quot;tú comes&quot;) in Colombia and Ecuador, and in parts of Colombia also with &quot;usted&quot; (with its standard verb forms) as a familiar form.
* In Chile there is coexistence of three usages:
** &quot;tú&quot; and its verb forms (&quot;tú comes&quot;);
** &quot;full&quot; &quot;voseo&quot; with uniquely Chilean &quot;voseo&quot; verb endings (&quot;-ái&quot;, &quot;-ís&quot;, and &quot;-ís&quot; respectively for &quot;-ar&quot;, &quot;-er&quot;, and &quot;-ir&quot; verbs: &quot;vos hablái&quot;—&#x27;you speak&#x27;, &quot;vos comís&quot;—&quot;you eat&quot;, &quot;vos vivís&quot;—&#x27;you live&#x27;); and
** verbal &quot;voseo&quot; with the Chilean verb endings (&quot;tú hablái&quot;, &quot;tú comís&quot;, etc.).
* &quot;Full&quot; &quot;voseo&quot; coexists with verbal &quot;voseo&quot; (&quot;tú comés&quot;) in Uruguay.
* In Venezuela&#x27;s Zulia State and parts of the state of Falcón there is no deletion of the palatal semivowel, creating &quot;vos coméis&quot;, &quot;vos habláis&quot;, and &quot;vos seáis&quot;. In Trujillo State, the &quot;voseo&quot; is like that of Argentina, with the exception of the imperative mood, which is like that of the standard &quot;tú&quot;.
* &quot;Voseo&quot; is absent from the Spanish of Spain, and from most of Mexico, Peru, and the islands of the Caribbean.

As for the second person familiar &quot;plural&quot;, it can be said that northern and central Spain use &quot;vosotros&quot; and its verb forms (&quot;vosotros habláis&quot;, &#x27;you [pl.] speak&#x27;), while the rest of the Spanish-speaking world merges the familiar and formal in &quot;ustedes&quot; (&quot;ustedes hablan&quot;). Usage in western Andalusia includes the use of &quot;ustedes&quot; with the traditional &quot;vosotros&quot; verb form (&quot;ustedes habláis&quot;).

In Ladino, the second-person pronouns are quite different from those of Spain and Latin America. The forms &quot;usted&quot; and &quot;ustedes&quot; had not yet appeared in 1492 when the Jews were expelled from Spain. Speakers of Ladino still use &quot;vos&quot; as it was used in the Middle Ages (as a singular) to address people higher on the social ladder. And &quot;vosotros&quot; is the only second person plural pronoun. In Ladino the formal singular for &#x27;you speak&#x27; is &quot;vos avláis&quot; (pronounced , and the same verb form serves for the plural, both formal and familiar: &quot;vosotros avláis&quot; (). The subjunctive &#x27;that you lose (formal singular)&#x27; is &quot;que vos pedráis&quot; (), while the plural (both formal and familiar) is &quot;que vosotros pedráis&quot; (). The formal &quot;singular&quot; imperative (&#x27;come&#x27;) is &quot;venid&quot; or &quot;vení&quot;, and the same form serves as the &quot;plural&quot; imperative, both formal and familiar.

===Third-person object pronouns===
In many dialects in northern and central Spain, including that of Madrid, the indirect object pronouns &quot;le&quot; and &quot;les&quot; may be used in place of the direct object pronouns &quot;lo&quot;, &quot;la&quot;, &quot;los&quot;, and &quot;las&quot; in a phenomenon known as &quot;leísmo&quot;. &quot;Leísmo&quot; typically occurs when the direct object refers to a person or personalized thing, such as a pet, and is most commonly used for male direct objects. The opposite phenomenon also occurs in the same regions of Spain and is known as &quot;loísmo&quot; or &quot;laísmo&quot;. In &quot;loísmo&quot;, the direct object pronouns &quot;lo&quot; and &quot;los&quot; are used in contexts where the indirect object pronouns &quot;le&quot; and &quot;les&quot; would normally be prescribed; this usually occurs with a male indirect object. In &quot;laísmo&quot;, &quot;la&quot; and &quot;las&quot; are used instead of &quot;le&quot; and &quot;les&quot; when referring to a female indirect object.

===Verb tenses for past events===
In a broad sense, when expressing an action viewed as finished in the past, speakers (and writers) in most of Spain use the perfect tense—e.g. &quot;he llegado&quot; *&#x27;I have arrived&#x27;)—more often than their American counterparts, while Spanish-speakers in the Americas more often use the preterite (&quot;llegué&quot; &#x27;I arrived&#x27;).

The perfect is also called the &quot;present perfect&quot; and, in Spanish, &quot;pasado perfecto&quot; or &quot;pretérito perfecto compuesto&quot;. It is described as a &quot;compound&quot; tense (&quot;compuesto&quot; in Spanish) because it is formed with the auxiliary verb &quot;haber&quot; plus a main verb.

The preterite, also called the &quot;simple past&quot; and, in Spanish, &quot;pretérito indefinido&quot; or &quot;pretérito perfecto simple&quot;, is considered a &quot;simple&quot; tense because it is formed of a single word: the verb stem with an inflectional ending for person, number, etc.

The choice between preterite and perfect, according to prescriptive grammars from both Spain and the Americas, is based on the psychological time frame—whether expressed or merely implied—in which the past action is embedded. If that time frame includes the present moment (i.e. if the speaker views the past action as somehow related to the moment of speaking), then the recommended tense is the perfect (&quot;he llegado&quot;). But if the time frame does not include the present—if the speaker views the action as only in the past, with little or no relation to the moment of speaking—then the recommended tense is the preterite (&quot;llegué&quot;). This is also the real spontaneous usage in most of Spain.

Following this criterion, an explicit time frame such as &quot;hoy&quot; (&#x27;today&#x27;) or &quot;este año&quot; (&#x27;this year&#x27;) includes the present and thus dictates the compound tense: &quot;Este año he cantado (&#x27;I have sung this year&#x27;). Conversely, a time frame such as &quot;ayer&quot; (&#x27;yesterday&#x27;) or &quot;la semana pasada&quot; (&#x27;last week&#x27;) does not include the present and therefore calls for the preterite: &quot;La semana pasada canté (&#x27;I sang last week&#x27;).

However, in most of the Americas, and in the Canary Islands, the preterite is used for all actions viewed as completed in the past. It tends to be used in the same way in those parts of Spain where the local languages and vernaculars do not have compound tenses, that is, the Galician-speaking area and the neighbouring Astur-Leonese-speaking area.

In most of Spain, the compound tense is preferred in most cases when the action described is close to the present moment:
*&quot;He viajado a (los) Estados Unidos.&quot; (&#x27;I have [just] traveled to (the) United States&#x27;)
*&quot;Cuando he llegado, la he visto.&quot; (&#x27;When I arrived, I saw her&#x27;)
*&quot;¿Qué ha pasado?&quot; (&#x27;What just happened?&#x27;)
Prescriptive norms would rule out the compound tense in a &quot;cuando&quot;-clause, as in the second example above.

Meanwhile, in Galicia, León, Asturias, Canary Islands and the Americas, speakers follow the opposite tendency, using the simple past tense in most cases, even if the action takes place at some time close to the present:
*&quot;Ya viajé a (los) Estados Unidos.&quot; (&#x27;I [have already] traveled to (the) United States&#x27;)
*&quot;Cuando llegué, la vi.&quot; (&#x27;When I arrived, I saw her&#x27;)
*&quot;¿Qué pasó?&quot; (&#x27;What just happened?&#x27;)

In Latin America one could say, &quot;he viajado a España varias veces&quot; (&#x27;I have traveled to Spain several times&#x27;), to express a repeated action, as in English. But to say &quot;El año pasado he viajado a España&quot; would sound ungrammatical (as it would also be in English to say &quot;last year, I have traveled to Spain&quot;, as &quot;last year&quot; implies that the relevant time period does not include the present). In Spain, speakers use the compound tense when the period of time considered has not ended, as in &quot;he comprado un coche este año&quot; (&#x27;I have bought a car this year&#x27;). Meanwhile, a Latin American Spanish speaker is more likely to say, &quot;compré un carro este año&quot; (&#x27;I bought a car this year&#x27;).

==Vocabulary==

Different regional varieties of Spanish vary in terms of vocabulary as well. This includes both words that exist only in certain varieties (especially words borrowed from indigenous languages of the Americas), and words that are used differently in different areas. Among words borrowed from indigenous languages are many names for food, plants and animals, clothes, and household object, such as the following items of Mexican Spanish vocabulary borrowed from Nahuatl.

In addition to loan words, there are a number of Spanish words that have developed distinct senses in different regional dialects. That is, for certain words a distinct meaning, either in addition to the standard meaning or in place of it, exists in some varieties of Spanish.

==Mutual intelligibility==
The different dialects and accents do not block cross-understanding among relatively educated speakers. Meanwhile, the basilects have diverged more. The unity of the language is reflected in the fact that early imported sound films were dubbed into one version for the entire Spanish-speaking market. Currently, films not originally in Spanish (usually Hollywood productions) are typically dubbed separately into two or sometimes three accents: one for Spain (standardized Peninsular Spanish without regional terms and pronunciations), and for the Americas, either just one (Mexican), or two: a Mexican one for most of the Americas (using a neutral standardized accent without regionalisms) and one in Rioplatense Spanish for Argentina, Uruguay, and Paraguay. Some high-budget productions, however, such as the &quot;Harry Potter&quot; film series, have had dubs in three or more of the major accents. On the other hand, productions from another Spanish-language country are seldom dubbed. Exceptionally, the made-in-Spain animated features &quot;Dogtanian and the Three Muskehounds&quot; and &quot;The World of David the Gnome&quot;, as well as TV serials from the Andean countries such as &quot;Karkú&quot; (Chile), have had a Mexican dub. The popularity of &quot;telenovelas&quot; and music familiarizes the speakers with other accents of Spanish.

Prescription and a common cultural and literary tradition, among other factors, have contributed to the formation of a loosely defined register which can be termed Standard Spanish (or &quot;Neutral Spanish&quot;), which is the preferred form in formal settings, and is considered indispensable in academic and literary writing, the media, etc. This standard tends to disregard local grammatical, phonetic and lexical peculiarities, and draws certain extra features from the commonly acknowledged , preserving (for example) certain verb tenses considered &quot;bookish&quot; or archaic in most other dialects.

Mutual intelligibility in Spanish does not necessarily mean a translation is wholly applicable in all Spanish-speaking countries, especially when conducting health research that requires precision. For example, an assessment of the applicability of QWB-SA&#x27;s Spanish version in Spain showed that some translated terms and usage applied US-specific concepts and regional lexical choices and cannot be successfully implemented without adaptation.

<doc id="780761" wikidata="Q7443690" url="?curid=780761" title="Second dealing">
<text>Second dealing (also known as dealing seconds) is a method of manipulating a deck of cards during a card game by way of dealing the second, rather than the top card of the deck, usually for the purpose of cheating. Second dealing and bottom dealing are also used in performance magic.

A card cheat who specializes in manipulating playing cards is called a card mechanic; a card mechanic who specializes in second dealing is called a &quot;second dealer&quot;, a &quot;deuce dealer&quot;, a &quot;two dealer&quot;, or a &quot;number two man.&quot;

Second dealing is only useful when the cheat knows the value of the top card of the deck. Once the value of the top card is known the cheat may resort to second dealing in order to avoid dealing a good card to an opponent, or to avoid dealing a bad card to himself or to a secret accomplice.

==Method==
In order to secretly gain knowledge of the value of the top card, second dealing is always used in conjunction with other cheating methods. One of the easiest, and most common methods of gaining knowledge of the top card is to employ the use of marked cards. When marked cards are not in use the cheat can still gain knowledge of the top card by means of peeking, flashing (to an accomplice; and receiving signals), or by employing the use of various mechanical devices that enable the cheat to see the value of the top card of the deck.

Second dealing is generally done by dealing the cards from the hand. While holding the deck in the hand, the dealer will either push the top card to the side - revealing a small portion of the back of the second card (called &#x27;the brief&#x27;), and strike the second card instead (this method is known as the strike second deal), or by pushing two top cards as one, in almost perfect alignment, and peeling off the second card while pushing the top card back flush with the deck (this method is called the pushoff second deal). Both methods have some advantages and disadvantages, depending on the situation.

Second dealing can also be done when the cards are dealt from a dealing shoe, such as in many casino games. In this case the dealer will push the top card upwards and strike the partially exposed second card. Although this method is usually employed with the use of a gaffed dealing shoe, an expert card mechanic can do it with a regular dealing shoe as well.

The second deal can be performed using either one or two hands, and also from a tabled deck, again using one or two hands. The practice of using the dealing hand in such a way that disguises the deal is known as &#x27;using shade&#x27;. The practice of tilting the deck to help provide &#x27;shade&#x27; is known as a &#x27;necktie&#x27;.

==Countermeasures==
The practice of using a burn card developed to help prevent second dealing. When burn cards are used, the top card is always discarded and the second one dealt. This is intended to prevent the dealer from gaining information about the next card to be dealt, since the second card is concealed by the top. Ironically, the second deal can be used to discard the second card from the pack and deal the original first.

The design of the back of the card can either help or hinder second dealing. A playing deck with only a solid color back makes second dealing very difficult to detect. Less so are cards with a uniform pattern or a single logo, such as an airline promotional pack. Easiest to detect are cards with a strong white border design, which appears stationary on the top card as the second card is slid out from underneath.

Tells on the second deal include changes in pace when a second is made, variations in the dealing card noise on a second, strange deck movements when dealing a second, or odd finger movements. Odd grips are sometimes employed, which can suggest someone is not dealing honestly.

<doc id="780762" wikidata="Q6260682" url="?curid=780762" title="John Thompson III">
<text>John Robert Thompson III (born March 11, 1966) is a professional basketball coach and executive who has been the assistant coach for the United States men&#x27;s national basketball team since 2017. He previously served as the head coach of the men&#x27;s basketball team at Georgetown University. He grew up in Washington, D.C., and was named first team All-Metro by &quot;The Washington Post&quot; while playing for Gonzaga College High School in 1984. Thompson was hired on April 20, 2004, to replace Craig Esherick and was fired at the end of the 2017 season. Prior to being hired at Georgetown, Thompson was the head coach for four years at his alma mater, Princeton University. Thompson is the son of John Thompson Jr., Georgetown&#x27;s head coach from 1972 to 1999, and is a 1988 graduate of Princeton University.

==Coaching career==

===Princeton===
Thompson was hired by Princeton in 2000 as a replacement for Bill Carmody, who had departed for Northwestern after having led them to the NCAA Tournament and the National Invitation Tournament twice each. Thompson guided the Tigers to a record of 16–11 (11–3 conference record), which was good enough to win the Ivy League for the first time since 1998. The following year, the Tigers went 16–12 (11–4) to finish in a three-way tie for the Ivy League title, which resulted in them having to play in a tiebreaker tournament, which they lost to Yale. The following year, they went 16–11 (10–4) and finished 3rd in the conference. In his final season in 2003, he led them to twenty wins while losing only one conference game to win the Ivy League for the third time in Thompson&#x27;s four years at the program and the sixth overall time in the last eight years.

===Georgetown===
Thompson was hired by Georgetown in 2004 to replace Craig Esherick. Esherick (as had been the case with his predecessor John Thompson) had utilized an offense built on quick and physical play; however, Georgetown had not made the NCAA Tournament in six of the last seven years. Thompson III immediately introduced the Princeton offense at Georgetown, a style of play that he learned from coach Pete Carril at Princeton as a player and assistant coach; the offense is cited as more deliberate in nature with establishing scoring opportunities through ball movement alongside passes and backdoor cuts. The 2004–05 team started out fair, with Thompson&#x27;s first win over a ranked team coming against Pittsburgh on January 5. However, the Hoyas finished 16–11 after losing five straight games to end the regular season, which meant they finished 7th in the Big East Conference. They fell to Connecticut in the Quarterfinals of the Big East tournament, but the Hoyas were invited to the NIT that year; the Hoyas went to the Quarterfinal before losing to South Carolina.

In 2005, the team won 23 games while finish tied for fourth in the Big East, and they would receive a bid to the NCAA Tournament, the first for the team since 2001. Thompson&#x27;s first notable win with the team took place on January 21, 2006, when unranked Georgetown upset No. 1 Duke. This was Georgetown&#x27;s first win over a No. 1 ranked team in 21 years. The Hoyas received a seventh seed in the South Region. They beat Northern Iowa and Ohio State to reach the Sweet Sixteen against Florida, where they lost 57–53 to the eventual national champions.

The 2006 team, led by players such as Roy Hibbert, reached their potential. The Hoyas would go on a tremendous run that year, as they won twelve of their last thirteen games en route to a Big East championship. They won their first regular season title since 1997 before rolling to victory in the Big East tournament for their first tournament title since 1989. The Hoyas were seeded as a two-seed in the East Region, their highest seeding since 1996. They would beat Belmont, Boston College, and Vanderbilt to reach the Elite Eight. Facing the top seed in North Carolina, the Hoyas trailed by as much as eleven points with twelve minutes remaining before rallying to win 96–84 and reach the Final Four for the first time since 1985. They faced Ohio State in the Final Four; the game was tied with nine minutes remaining, but the Buckeyes went on a 23–16 run to beat Georgetown 67–60. 

While the 2006–07 season was a banner year for the Hoyas, it also would prove to be the high point of Thompson&#x27;s tenure at Georgetown. It would be the last time that the Hoyas would survive the tournament&#x27;s opening weekend under Thompson; indeed, Thompson would only win two more tournament games.

The 2015–16 season was a disappointment for all sides involved. They notched one ranked victory in nonconference play and were 7–5, and expectations were fair for a contending team. Big East play would prove to be a disaster, as the Hoyas went 8–13, which included losing seven of the last eight games in the regular season. It was the first time in his tenure that the Hoyas were not invited to either the NCAA Tournament or the NIT. After the season, Thompson (dubbed one of the &quot;most polarizing figures in college sports&quot; by the campus newspaper) called the season the most challenging of his career. The 2016–17 season proved to be the last for Thompson as coach. A 9–4 non-conference record ended up being a mirage for a miserable season of Big East play, where they went 5–13. They managed to beat three ranked teams (including eleventh-ranked Butler in January), but the Hoyas lost seven of their last eight games to finish below .500 for the second straight year, which was the first time Georgetown had suffered back-to-back losing seasons since 1972–1973. On March 23, 2017 (fifteen days after the Hoyas lost in the First Round of the Big East tournament), Thompson was fired. Thompson&#x27;s 13-year tenure as head coach is the second longest in Georgetown history, and his 278 wins are also second all-time in school history–in both cases, only behind his father.

===United States Men&#x27;s National Team===
On October 12, 2017, Thompson was named by USA Basketball as the assistant coach of the United States men&#x27;s national basketball team for all FIBA World Cup qualifiers leading to the 2019 FIBA World Cup. This was his second time as an assistant coach in the National Programme; he has previously (2008) served as an assistant for the Under 18 men&#x27;s team.

===Washington Wizards===
In July 2019, Thompson joined Monumental Sports &amp; Entertainment, owner of the NBA&#x27;s Washington Wizards and WNBA&#x27;s Washington Mystics, to become the lead of their newly formed athlete development and engagement department.

<text>Ezzelino III da Romano (25 April 1194, Tombolo7 October 1259) was an Italian feudal lord, a member of the Ezzelini family, in the March of Treviso (in modern Veneto). He was a close ally of the emperor Frederick II (r. 1220–1250), and ruled Verona, Vicenza and Padua for almost two decades. He became infamous as a cruel tyrant, and was, in fact, the most &quot;notorious&quot; of the &quot;early tyrants&quot;.

==Biography==
=== Early life ===

Ezzelino was a son of Ezzelino II da Romano, ruler of Bassano del Grappa and other fiefs in the Veneto, and Adelaide D&#x27;egli Alberti di Mangona, who came from a family of counts in Tuscany. At the age of four years, he was sent as a hostage to Verona, but nothing else is known about his childhood or education. In 1213, he took part in the siege of the castle of Este, which belonged to his father&#x27;s archenemy, marquess Azzo VI of Este, who died in 1212 and later to his son Aldobrandino. According to the chronicler Rolandino of Padua, the young Ezzelino already showed a keen interest in siegecraft and acquired a hatred of the Este which would last his entire life.

=== Rise to power 1226–1239 ===

When Ezzelino II retired to a monastery in 1223, his possessions went to his sons Alberico, who received the castles and villages in the countryside of Vicenza (including the important centre of Bassano del Grappa) and Ezzelino, who received the possessions in the countryside of Treviso. In 1226 Ezzelino intervened in a factional struggle in Verona, aiding the Monticuli and Quattuorviginti against their enemies, the so-called &quot;pars comitis&quot; (&quot;party of the count&quot;), which was headed by the Veronese count Richard of San Bonifacio. From this time onwards Ezzelino became an important factor in Veronese politics and in 1226-1227 he had become or Lord Mayor of that city. He briefly lost Verona, but regained it in 1230.

At this time control over Verona was important because Frederick II was in conflict with the Second Lombard League, an alliance of cities in Northern Italy. Whoever controlled Verona could block the Brenner Pass through the Alps, and thereby prevent the arrival of reinforcements for Frederick from Germany. Initially, Ezzelino favoured the Lombard League which could block the Brenner and emerge victorious from its first confrontation with the Emperor. However, he and his brother Alberico later changed sides, when it became apparent that the League favoured their enemies in the March, particularly the Este and the San Bonifacio (Sambonifacio).

In 1232 the brothers struck an alliance with Frederick and received an imperial privilege of protection. However, four years passed before the emperor could personally intervene in the March of Treviso. The years 1232–1236 were therefore very difficult for Ezzelino and Alberico, who were assailed by many enemies, primarily the San Bonifacio, the Este and the city of Padua.

In 1236, Frederick II finally arrived in the March of Treviso. Because Ezzelino and his Veronese allies, the Monticuli and Quattuorviginti, had gained control of Verona in early 1236, the emperor could bring reinforcements across the Alps, including 3000 German men-at-arms. In a campaign that began in November 1236 Frederick and Ezzelino, who was becoming an increasingly important ally of the emperor, subjugated all the important cities of the March of Treviso: Vicenza was conquered in November 1236, Padua and Treviso surrendered in February/March 1237.

In 1236 Ezzelino married Selvaggia, Frederick&#x27;s natural daughter who was thirteen years old at the time; conquered Verona and by treason Padua, seizing the position of &quot;podestà&quot; of that city. In Padua he had the monk Giordano Forzatè arrested and exiled.

Ezzelino was one of the protagonists in the Ghibelline-Imperial victory of Cortenuova (1237) and in 1239 was named Imperial viceroy for the March of Treviso. His long-lasting struggle against Azzo VII of Este, the new duke of the Este ended with the total defeat of the latter and the annexion of many territories.

===Last years===
After a failed pacification attempt by Frederick, as soon as the emperor departed Ezzelino attacked the Este, submitting Treviso - even though it was his brother&#x27;s fief - Belluno and Feltre. He was now lord of all lands between the city of Trento and the Oglio river and had acquired a reputation for cruelty and the regular use of torture against all enemies and alleged plotters, in the cities he ruled. In 1249, five years after Selvaggia&#x27;s death at the age of just 21 years, he married Beatrice di Buontraverso.

After Frederick&#x27;s death in 1250, Ezzelino supported his son, Conrad IV. There was growing disgust at Ezzelino&#x27;s cruel behavior, and in 1254 he was excommunicated by Pope Innocent IV, who also launched a crusade against him. He had reconciled with his brother and allied himself with other seigneurs of the Veneto and Lombardy, attacking Padua, which resisted, and Brescia, which was instead sacked after an easy victory of his German knights over the crusaders&#x27; army. 
In 1258 he launched a broad Ghibelline offensive in Lombardy and Veneto along with Oberto Pallavicino of Cremona. After a failed attempt to assault Milan itself, he was wounded by an arrow in the course of the Battle of Cassano d&#x27;Adda and had to retreat but was captured near Bergamo. He killed himself by intentional self-neglect during his imprisonment in the castle of Soncino, near the city of Cremona in Lombardy. In the following year his brother Alberico was put to death, and the Romano family became extinct.

It was only after his death that the alliance between Sambonifacio and Este fell apart.

==Legacy==
Much of what we know about Ezzelino comes from a literary tradition that was embroidered over the course of centuries; despite the brevity of his reign, Ezzelino&#x27;s reputed cruelty became symbolic of tyranny, poets and chroniclers living in recent memory of his tactics used his name to evoke the sense of arbitrary power and the moral transgressions it enabled; fourteenth century authors raised the level of accusation, insisting that Ezzelino&#x27;s parentage was demonic. Rolandino of Padua&#x27;s &quot;Chronicle of the Trevisan March&quot; (c. 1262) charts the rise and the fall of the &#x27;da Romano&#x27; family, introducing Ezzelino as a young man throwing stones at the home of the family rival; the extremely partisan political work follows the fortunes of Padua under the tyrant&#x27;s iron grip up to the commune&#x27;s liberation by the Guelph League.
Albertino Mussato&#x27;s &quot;Ecerinis&quot; ( c. 1315 ) portrays Ezzelino as the son of the Devil; the Latin verse play introduces Ezzelino&#x27;s mother, who provides testimony of the tyrant&#x27;s infernal sire.
In Dante Aligheri&#x27;s &quot;Divine Comedy&quot;, his soul is consigned to Hell, where Dante encounters him in the Seventh Circle, First Ring: the Violent against their Neighbors (&quot;Inferno&quot;, XII, 109). His younger sister Cunizza is also cited by Dante, in &quot;Paradise&quot;, IX, 31-33.

Before Ezzelino, the seizing of political power in city-states throughout the Middle Ages, had been based on real or pretended inheritance claims or else were directed against infidels and the excommunicated; but with him, as the historian Jacob Burkhardt relates, &quot;Here for the first time the attempt was openly made to found a throne by wholesale murder and endless barbarities, by the adoption in short, of any means with a view to nothing but the end pursued.&quot; The example set by the success of this kind of ruthlessness, was not lost on the future tyrants of late Middle Age and early Renaissance Italy.

<doc id="780776" wikidata="Q1329278" url="?curid=780776" title="Sin (song)">
<text>&quot;Sin&quot; is the third single by American industrial band Nine Inch Nails from the album &quot;Pretty Hate Machine&quot;. Released in October 1990, the song peaked at number 35 in the UK Singles Chart.

&quot;Sin&quot; has been commonly a staple of Nine Inch Nails live performances for many years; setlist.fm lists it as the band&#x27;s ninth most played live song. Its versions on the single differentiate heavily from the album cut, with more an EBM sound with distorted vocals and alternate instrumentation that became the foundation for its many live renditions, as opposed to the synth-pop style featured on &quot;Pretty Hate Machine&quot;.

== Single ==
Stylized as &quot;5in&quot;, it is the fourth official Nine Inch Nails release and final single for &quot;Pretty Hate Machine&quot;, containing three variations of the track and Nine Inch Nails&#x27; first cover song. The spine of the US version refers to the single as &quot;Sin &quot;Long, Dub &amp; Short&quot;&quot;. The lyric &quot;Stale incense, old sweat, and lies...&quot; directly quotes the short story &quot;In the Hills, the Cities&quot; by Clive Barker, from &quot;Books of Blood&quot;. All three versions were produced by Keith LeBlanc and Adrian Sherwood of Tackhead.

The design of the single was created by The Designers Republic, a British studio known for their unique electronic-oriented aesthetics. Other musical artists associated with the group included Aphex Twin and Pop Will Eat Itself, among others.

&quot;Get Down, Make Love&quot; is a cover of the Queen song originally released on &quot;News of the World&quot;. This version of &quot;Get Down, Make Love&quot; samples Dan O&#x27;Herlihy from &quot;The Cabinet of Caligari&quot;, as well as a brief snippet of &quot;We Will Rock You&quot; in the final seconds. It was co-produced by Al Jourgensen of Ministry under the alias of Hypo Luxa and was later released again as a bonus track on the 2010 remaster of &quot;Pretty Hate Machine&quot;.

The single was included in the Record Store Day–Black Friday exclusive box set, &quot;Halo I–IV&quot;.

== Music video ==

A music video, directed by Brett Turnbull and produced by Sarah Bayliss was released, using the &quot;(short)&quot; remix of the song. It features two girls dancing with each other at the beginning, cutting to a black-and-white footage of a woman, naked except for what looks like straps to spelunking gear and a halogen lamp, walking a wrist-bound Trent Reznor with a bag over his head through what looks like an industrial warehouse complex and eventually to strap him into an Aerotrim where she spins him throughout the video. These scenes are intercut with two young gay lovers, a man and woman wearing ritualistic dressings and dancing, as well as visuals of a pierced phallus and clitoris, all reflecting the song&#x27;s dark, sexual aspects.

Though the video never aired, an edited version appears on &quot;Closure&quot;. The original video later became available through TVT&#x27;s website.

<doc id="780778" wikidata="Q3525096" url="?curid=780778" title="Thomas Eugene Everhart">
<text>Thomas Eugene Everhart FREng (born February 15, 1932, in Kansas City, Missouri) is an American educator and physicist. His area of expertise is the physics of electron beams. Together with Richard F. M. Thornley he designed the Everhart–Thornley detector. These detectors are still in use in scanning electron microscopes, even though the first such detector was made available as early as 1956.

Everhart was elected a member of the National Academy of Engineering in 1978 for contributions to the electron optics of the scanning electron microscope and to its use in electronics and biology. He was appointed an International Fellow of the Royal Academy of Engineering in 1990. He served as chancellor of the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign from 1984 to 1987 and as the president of the California Institute of Technology from 1987 to 1997.

== Early life and education==
Everhart&#x27;s parents were William E. Everhart and Elizabeth A. West. Everhart received his A.B. in physics from Harvard University in 1953, and his M.S. in applied physics from the University of California, Los Angeles, in 1955. He held a Marshall Scholarship at Clare College, Cambridge, where he completed a PhD in Physics under Professor Charles Oatley in 1958.

==Career==

=== Everhart-Thornley detector ===

Everhart began working on electron detection and the design of scanning electron microscopes (SEMs) as a student with Charles Oatley at Cambridge in 1955. An initial prototype, the SEM1, had been developed by Dennis McMullen, who published his dissertation &quot;Investigations relating to the design of electron microscopes&quot; in 1952. It was further modified by Ken C. A. Smith, who developed a way to efficiently detect low-energy secondary electrons. Oatley and his students used SEM to develop a variety of new techniques for studying surface topography.

Everhart developed techniques to detect low-energy secondaries. His Ph.D. thesis, in 1958, was &quot;Contrast formation in the scanning electron microscope&quot;. Analyzing the electrons detected by the SEM, he reported that about 67% of the signal measured could be attributed to low energy secondaries from the specimen. About 3% was due to higher-energy reflected electrons. He also presented equations to model the noise introduced.

Use of the term &quot;voltage contrast&quot; to describe the relationship between the voltage applied to a specimen and the resulting image contrast, is attributed to Everhart. As of 1959, Everhart produced the first voltage-contrast images of p-n junctions of biased silicon diodes. Voltage contrast, the ability to detect variations in surface electrical potentials on a specimen, is now one of several imaging modes used for the characterization, diagnosis and failure analysis of semiconductors. As many as half of the SEMs sold are believed to be used in semiconductor applications.

Everhart studied contrast mechanisms in detail and developed a new theory of reflection of electrons from solids. He also made some of the first quantitative studies of the effects of beam penetration on image formation in the SEM.

In 1960 Everhart and Richard F. M. Thornley published a description for the improved design of a secondary electron detector, since known as the Everhart–Thornley detector. Everhart and Thornley increased the efficiency of existing detectors by adding a light pipe to carry the photon signal from the scintillator inside the evacuated specimen chamber of the scanning electron microscopes to the photomultiplier outside the chamber. This strengthened the signal collected and improved the signal-to-noise ratio. In 1963, Pease and Nixon incorporated the Everhart-Thornley detector into their prototype for the first commercial SEM, later developed as the Cambridge Scientific Instruments Mark I &quot;Stereoscan&quot;. This type of secondary electron and back-scattered electron detector is still used in modern scanning electron microscopes (SEMs).

By using various types of detectors with SEM, it becomes possible to map the topography, crystallography and composition of specimens being examined. In the 1960s, Wells, Everhart, and Matta built an advanced SEM for semiconductor studies and microfabrication at Westinghouse Laboratories in Pittsburgh. They were able to combine signals so to more effectively examine multiple layers in active devices, an early example of EBIC imaging.

===University of California, Berkeley ===
From 1958-1978 Everhart was a professor and latterly department chairman of engineering and computer science, at the University of California at Berkeley. There he supported the construction of the first scanning electron microscope in a U.S. university.

=== Cornell University ===
In January 1979, he became Joseph Silbert Dean of the college of engineering at Cornell University, Ithaca, New York.

===University of Illinois ===
Everhart served as chancellor of the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign from 1984 to 1987. As chancellor, Everhart was involved in proposals for and development of the Beckman Institute for Advanced Science and Technology, an interdisciplinary research institute substantially funded by an appeal to Arnold Orville Beckman. In a formal invitation to proposed members of the Administrative Committee for the Beckman Institute, Everhart wrote that creation of the Beckman Institute was &quot;an exceptional opportunity, perhaps the most dramatic and exciting one that we will see in our working lifetimes.&quot;

===California Institute of Technology ===
Everhart was president of the California Institute of Technology from 1987 to 1997. As Caltech&#x27;s president, Everhart authorized the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO) project, a large-scale experiment that seeks to detect gravitational waves and use them for fundamental research in physics and astronomy.

While at Caltech, Everhart was involved in substantial expansion of the university, heading a $350-million fund-raising drive. In 1989, he helped dedicate the Beckman Institute at Caltech, a research center for biology, chemistry, and related sciences. It was the second of five research centers supported by Arnold Orville Beckman and his wife Mabel. Everhart also was involved in the development of the W. M. Keck Observatory in Hawaii, supported by the W. M. Keck Foundation; the Gordon and Betty Moore Laboratory of Engineering, supported by Gordon Moore of Intel; and the Fairchild Engineering Library, supported by the Sherman Fairchild Foundation.

Everhart promoted efforts to hire more female faculty and increase the enrollment of women. In his final year at Caltech the number of women in the freshmen class was double that of the year he joined Caltech.

Since 1998, Everhart has served as a trustee of the California Institute of Technology. He sits on the boards of directors of Raytheon and the Kavli Foundation, among others.

=== Harvard University ===
In 1999, Everhart was elected to a six-year terms as Overseer of Harvard University. In 2001 he became a member of the Overseers executive committee. He was one of three overseers who participated in the university&#x27;s presidential search committee in 2000-01. In 2004, he was elected president of Harvard&#x27;s Board of Overseers for 2004-05.

== Awards and honors ==
Everhart has been elected to a number of scientific societies, including the following:

<doc id="780780" wikidata="Q12059934" url="?curid=780780" title="Hero Honda CBZ Series">
<text>The Hero Honda CBZ is a motorcycle launched in early 1999 by Hero Honda, with an original Honda 156.8cc single-cylinder engine. The styling of the bike was a scaled version of the Honda CB series.

The CBZ has an Over Square and Overhead camshaft engine with a Keihin slide type carburetor with accelerator pump. It has a larger spring operated nozzle to provide a richer fuel air mixture into the engine for better acceleration. An air injection to new emission standards, including Euro1.

==CBZ==
The bike was launched as Hero Honda CBZ in India. It was Powered by an Original Honda&#x27;s 156.8cc.The engine was based on Honda CRF 150F and it came equipped with TPFC and self start as optional. The term TPFC Means Transient Power Fuel Control system .. This system uses a constant-choke carburetor. This Carburetor plays a major role by increasing the speed without any Power lag and Vibration jerks. The throttle valve inside the Carburetor creates the vacuum which operates a diaphragm pump, Which helps to controls the air-fuel ratio inside the engine through a tapered jet. Hero Honda CBZ is first and last bike to get TPFC Technology which gives a reasonable amount of boost by sending additional fuel into the engine when the throttle is opened but it also reduce the fuel efficiency of the motorcycle. The model went unchanged more or less for five years. Hero Honda CBZ was available in the following colors- CANDY BLAZING RED, BLACK, CANDY TAHITIAN BLUE, SIENA GOLD METALLIC, SPARKLING SILVER METALLIC and TASMANIA GREEN METALLIC. Suggested Engine oil grade: SAE 20W 40 and Hero Honda CBZ (1999–2004) complies (BS1) emission norms Bharat stage emission standards.

== Hero Honda CBZ Star ==
In 2004, a new variant called CBZ Star was launched with revised graphics and addition of self start, it replaces the Keihin Slide Carburetor with Conventional CV Carburetor which improves the fuel efficiency but hampered in pickup which is main feature of previous model CBZ, and was not popular due to over use of graphics and significantly higher price compared to its competitors. The bike was discontinued after September 2005 and Hero Honda CBZ Star also complaints (BS1) emission norms Bharat stage emission standards

== Hero Honda CBZ Xtreme ==
The CBZ Star was followed after a gap of two years by the CBZ-Xtreme, which shared no engine and body parts with the CBZ, and had a new 149cc engine and five-speed gearbox, which also powers Hero Honda Achiever and Honda Unicorn with Advanced Microprocessor Ignition System which was introduced first by Hero Honda in Hero Honda Ambition 135. After 3 years it got facelift update by changing clear lens indicators, tail lamp setup and part digital instrument cluster and Hero Honda CBZ-Xtreme Complies (BS3) emission norms Bharat stage emission standards.&lt;br&gt; After the separation of Hero Honda joint venture in 2010, Hero Updated next generation model by changing the bike name as Hero Xtreme in 2012.

==Transient Power Fuel Control==

Transient Power Fuel Control system uses its nozzle inside the carburetor to sprays petrol inside the engine. So, when the rider opens the throttle suddenly. it will give power instantly to rev the engine without any issues, nearly equal to fuel injection concept but it is powered mechanically, whereas Fuel injection is an electronic concept. This increases the throttle response crisps as like fuel injection and the engine feels lively. However, this increases the emission levels and TPFC Accidentally waste&#x27;s some fuel, Because, the accelerator pump inject some extra amount fuel when the rider applies sudden throttle compensate for lean air-fuel mixture which it generates. Hence, TPFC was consequently discontinued. Later, the fuel injection technology replaced the carburetor, it performs the same mechanism but drastically improves the fuel efficiency, due to correct level of air-fuel mixture performed electronically instead of old Carburetor mechanism..

<text>Harringay Green Lanes is a station on the Suffragette line of the London Overground in Harringay, north London. It is from (measured via Kentish Town and Mortimer Street Junction) and is situated between and .

==Services==
All services at Harringay Green Lanes are operated by London Overground using EMUs.

The typical off-peak service is four trains per hour in each direction between and . During the late evenings, the service is reduced to three trains per hour in each direction.


==Connections==
London Buses routes 29, 141, 341 and night route N29 serve the station.

The station is a 0.36 mile (0.58 km) walk from Harringay railway station on the East Coast Main Line.

==History==
It was opened on 1 June 1880 with the name &quot;Green Lanes&quot;, but has since been renamed a number of times:
*Harringay Park, Green Lanes (1883)
*Harringay Park (18 June 1951)
*Harringay Stadium (27 October 1958)
*Harringay East (12 May 1990)
*Harringay Green Lanes (8 July 1991)

There were originally wooden platform buildings, which were replaced by brick and concrete structures in the 1950s. The original ticket office at street level survived and in recent times has been converted into a café. To cope with the huge number of passengers visiting Harringay Stadium and Arena, both right next to the station, very long platforms were provided, but these were shortened in late 2003 due to subsidence. Just west of the station was a goods yard; this closed on 3 February 1964, and the site is now occupied by Railway Fields nature reserve.

==Station infrastructure==
In summer 2008, the station was repainted and re-signed in London Overground colours, with the green-painted staircase railings (for example) of the former Silverlink franchise giving way to Overground orange.

The station has no direct interchange to a tube station, despite the fact that the Piccadilly line runs directly beneath it and the distance between the two stations at either end of this section, and , is particularly long for the line. Manor House station is about away.
Transfer on a single ticket is allowed between Harringay Green Lanes and nearby .

The station has step-free access from street to platform.

<doc id="780793" wikidata="Q1189983" url="?curid=780793" title="Scissor-tailed flycatcher">
<text>The scissor-tailed flycatcher (Tyrannus forficatus), known as swallow-tailed flycatcher or scissorstail, is a long-tailed insectivorous bird of the genus &quot;Tyrannus&quot;, whose members are collectively referred to as kingbirds. Its scientific name used to be Muscivora forficata until it was changed to Tyrannus forficatus. It is found in North and Central America, and is Oklahoma&#x27;s State Bird.

==Taxonomy==
The scissor-tailed flycatcher was formally described in 1789 by the German naturalist Johann Friedrich Gmelin in his revised and expanded edition of Carl Linnaeus&#x27;s &quot;Systema Naturae&quot;. He placed it with the flycatchers in the genus &quot;Muscicapa&quot; and coined the binomial name &quot;Muscicapa forficata&quot;. The specific epithet is from Latin &quot;forfex&quot;, &quot;forficis&quot; meaning &quot;a pair of scissors&quot;. Gmelin based his description on &quot;Le moucherolle à queue fourchue du Mexique&quot; (French: &quot;the Mexican swallow-tailed flycatcher&quot;) that had been described in 1778 by the French polymath Comte de Buffon from a specimen from Mexico and illustrated with a hand-coloured engraving by François-Nicolas Martinet. The scissor-tailed flycatcher is now one of 13 species placed in the kingbird genus &quot;Tyrannus&quot; that was introduced in 1799 by Bernard Germain de Lacépède. The species is monotypic: no subspecies are recognised. 

Within the genus &quot;Tyrannus&quot;, the scissor-tailed flycatcher is most closely related to the western kingbird (&quot;Tyrannus verticalis&quot;). In eastern Arkansas and western Tennessee, there is a hybrid breeding zone where the scissor-tailed flycatcher and the western kingbird are sympatric and possibly compete for the same niche. Both these species have simultaneously expanded their breeding ranges eastward over the past 50 years.

==Description==
Adult birds have pale gray heads and upper parts, light underparts, salmon-pink flanks and undertail coverts, and dark gray wings. Axillars and patch on underwing coverts are red. Their extremely long, forked tails, which are black on top and white on the underside, are characteristic and unmistakable. At maturity, the male may be up to in length, while the female&#x27;s tail is up to 30% shorter. The wingspan is and the weight is up to . Immature birds are duller in color and have shorter tails. A lot of these birds have been reported to be more than .

== Breeding ==
They build a cup nest in isolated trees or shrubs, sometimes using artificial sites such as telephone poles near towns. The male performs a spectacular aerial display during courtship with his long tail forks streaming out behind him. Both parents feed the young. Like other kingbirds, they are very aggressive in defending their nest. Clutches contain three to six eggs.

== Diet ==
In the summer, scissor-tailed flycatchers feed mainly on insects (grasshoppers, robber-flies, and dragonflies), which they may catch by waiting on a perch and then flying out to catch them in flight (hawking). For additional food in the winter they will also eat some berries.

== Distribution and habitat ==
Their breeding habitat is open shrubby country with scattered trees in the south-central states of Texas, Oklahoma, Kansas, western portions of Louisiana, Arkansas, and Missouri west to far eastern New Mexico and northeastern Mexico. Reported sightings record occasional stray visitors as far north as southern Canada and Upstate New York, as far east as Florida and Georgia, and in the West Indies. They migrate through Texas and eastern Mexico to their winter non-breeding range, from southern Mexico to Panama. Pre-migratory roosts and flocks flying south may contain as many as 1000 birds.

== In culture ==
 The scissor-tailed flycatcher is the state bird of Oklahoma, and is displayed in flight with tail feathers spread on the reverse of the Oklahoma Commemorative Quarter. 

Professional soccer team FC Tulsa features a scissor-tailed flycatcher on their crest. The scissor-tailed flycatcher is also displayed in the background of the current license plate.

<text>The Limerick Generating Station is a nuclear power plant in Pennsylvania located next to the Schuylkill River in Limerick Township, Montgomery County, northwest of Philadelphia. The facility has two General Electric boiling water reactor (BWR) units, cooled by natural draft cooling towers. According to its owner, Constellation Energy, the two units are capable of producing 2,317 megawatts of power, which combined would provide electricity to around 2 million households. Constellation owns and operates this facility following their separation from Exelon Corporation in 2022. With the exception of refueling outages, Limerick Generating Station continuously operates at 100% power. The plant is connected to the grid, and transmits power, via multiple 500kv transmission lines.

Limerick is a black start plant, meaning it doesn&#x27;t require grid power for stator excitation. For critical standby power, Limerick depends on eight Fairbanks Morse 38 8-1/8 diesel engine generator sets that each deliver 3000 kilowatts of power and are capable of achieving rated speed within ten seconds of start.

The cooling towers for the Limerick Generating Station can be seen for miles away in parts of Montgomery, Chester, and Berks counties.

==History==

The site was chosen and plans to build the station were announced in 1969, by the Philadelphia Electric Company (now PECO Energy, a subsidiary of Exelon). It is located approximately one mile south of Sanatoga, PA. Community protests by the Keystone Alliance and other delays pushed the start of construction by the Bechtel Power Corporation to June 1974.

Limerick Unit 1 first attained criticality (began producing nuclear power, at limited capacity) on December 22, 1984 and was certified for commercial operation on February 1, 1986.

Limerick Unit 2 attained criticality on August 1, 1989, and commercial operation began on January 8, 1990.

On July 27, 1994, an F3 tornado struck the area surrounding the Limerick Generating Station. The tornado narrowly missed the station by two miles, but caused considerable damage to a nearby housing development in Limerick Township.

President George W. Bush visited the Limerick Generating Station in May 2006 to discuss nuclear power and its role in the Advanced Energy Initiative, which he announced at the 2006 State of the Union Address. He toured the facility, including a trip to the control room of the plant.

On October 20, 2014, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) granted extensions for Limerick Units 1 and 2 for another 20 years. The units are now licensed to operate until 2044 and 2049 respectively.

Unit 2 of the station was scrammed from 100% power to a shutdown on June 1, 2016, at 9 am. The reactor was shut down due to an electrical fault, causing the recirculation pumps to stop. The steam bypass valves that lead to the main condenser were opened and Limerick went through a normal hot shutdown process.

== Electricity production ==
==Seismic risk==
The Nuclear Regulatory Commission estimates the risk of an earthquake intense enough to cause core damage to every reactor in the U.S. According to the NRC study published in August 2010, Limerick&#x27;s earthquake risk was calculated at 1 in 18,868. Following the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster in 2011, government regulators announced the plant would undergo further evaluations for seismic activity risk.

A quarry is located nearby which occasionally does blasting; however, this is done with the consent of plant staff.

==Surrounding population==
The Nuclear Regulatory Commission defines two emergency planning zones around nuclear power plants: a plume exposure pathway zone with a radius of , concerned primarily with exposure to, and inhalation of, airborne radioactive contamination, and an ingestion pathway zone of about , concerned primarily with ingestion of food and liquid contaminated by radioactivity.

The 2010 U.S. population within of Limerick was 252,197, an increase of 18.7 percent in a decade, according to an analysis of U.S. Census data for msnbc.com. The 2010 U.S. population within was 8,027,924, an increase of 6.1 percent since 2000.

<doc id="780801" wikidata="Q570693" url="?curid=780801" title="Azerbaijani alphabet">
<text>The Azerbaijani alphabet (, , ) has three versions which includes the Arabic, Latin, and Cyrillic alphabets.

North Azerbaijani, the official language of Republic of Azerbaijan, is written in a modified Latin alphabet. After the fall of Soviet Union this superseded previous versions based on Cyrillic and Arabic scripts.

In Iran, a modified Persian script has always been used for the South Azerbaijani language.

Azerbaijanis of Dagestan still use the Cyrillic script.

== Azerbaijani Latin alphabet ==

The Azerbaijani Latin alphabet consists of 32 letters.
===History===

From the nineteenth century there were efforts by some intellectuals like Mirza Fatali Akhundov and Mammad agha Shahtakhtinski to replace the Arabic script and create a Latin alphabet for Azerbaijani. In 1922, a Latin alphabet was created by Soviet Union sponsored &quot;Yeni türk əlifba komitəsi&quot; (New Turkic Alphabet Committee; ) in Baku which hoped that the new alphabet would divide the Azerbaijanis in the USSR from those living in Iran.

An additional reason for the Soviet regime&#x27;s encouragement of a non-Arabic script was that they hoped the transition would work towards secularizing Azerbaijan&#x27;s Muslim culture and since language script reform, proposed as early as the 19th century by Azerbaijani intellectuals (e.g. Mirza Fatali Akhundov), had previously been rejected by the Azerbaijani religious establishment on the grounds that Arabic script, the language of the Koran, was &quot;holy and should not be tampered with.

There was some historical basis for the reform which received overwhelming support at the First Turkology Congress in Baku during 1926 where the reform was voted for 101 to 7. 
The Azerbaijani poet Samad Vurgun declared &quot;Azerbaijani people are proud of being the first among Oriental nations that buried the Arabic alphabet and adopted the Latin alphabet. This event is written in golden letters of our history&quot;
As a result, in the Soviet Union in 1926 the Uniform Turkic Alphabet was introduced to replace the varieties of the Arabic script in use at the time. From 1922 to 1929, both Arabic and Latin scripts were used in Soviet Azerbaijani editions; in 1929, the Latin script was finally chosen. In 1933, the Azerbaijani Latin alphabet was reformed to match alphabets of other Soviet Turkic languages. The reform changed glyphs for some letters and phonetic values for some other letters. In 1939 Joseph Stalin ordered that the Azerbaijani Latin script used in the USSR again be changed, this time to the Cyrillic script in order to sever the Soviet Azerbaijani Turks&#x27; ties with the Turkish people in the Republic of Turkey.

When the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991 and Azerbaijan gained its independence, one of the first laws passed in the new Parliament was the adoption of a new Latin-script alphabet. The period from 1991 to 2001 was declared the transitional period, when both Latin and Cyrillic alphabet were accepted. Since 2001, the Azerbaijani Latin alphabet is the official alphabet of the Azerbaijani language in the Republic of Azerbaijan.

* From 1922 until 1933 (old alphabet defined using the Latin script):
*: Aa, Bb, Cc, Çç, Dd, Ee, Əə, Ff, Gg, Ƣƣ, Hh, Ii, , Jj, Kk, Ll, Mm, Nn, Ꞑꞑ, Oo, Ɵɵ, Pp, Qq, Rr, Ss, Tt, Uu, Vv, Xx, Yy, Zz, Ƶƶ, Ɜɜ, &#x27; 
* From 1933 until 1939:
*: Aa, Bʙ, Cc, Çç, Dd, Ee, Əə, Ff, Gg, Ƣƣ, Hh, Ii, Ьь, Jj, Kk, Qq, Ll, Mm, Nn, Ꞑꞑ, Oo, Ɵɵ, Pp, Rr, Ss, Şş, Tt, Uu, Vv, Xx, Уy, Zz, Ƶƶ, &#x27; 
* From 1939 until 1958 (first version of the alphabet defined using the Cyrillic script):
*: Аа, Бб, Вв, Гг, Ғғ, Дд, Ее, Әә, Жж, Зз, Ии, Йй, Кк, Ҝҝ, Лл, Мм, Нн, Оо, Өө, Пп, Рр, Сс, Тт, Уу, Үү, Фф, Хх, Һһ, Цц, Чч, Ҹҹ, Шш, Ыы, Ээ, Юю, Яя, &#x27; 
* From 1958 until 1991 (simplified version of the alphabet defined using the Cyrillic script and the letter Јј borrowed from Latin and abolition of the letters Ээ, Юю, Яя):
*: Аа, Бб, Вв, Гг, Ғғ, Дд, Ее, Әә, Жж, Зз, Ии, Ыы, Јј, Кк, Ҝҝ, Лл, Мм, Нн, Оо, Өө, Пп, Рр, Сс, Тт, Уу, Үү, Фф, Хх, Һһ, Чч, Ҹҹ, Шш, &#x27; 
* From 1991 until 1992 (first version of the modern alphabet defined using the Latin script):
*: Aa, Ää, Bb, Cc, Çç, Dd, Ee, Ff, Gg, Ğğ, Hh, Xx, Iı, İi, Jj, Kk, Qq, Ll, Mm, Nn, Oo, Öö, Pp, Rr, Ss, Şş, Tt, Uu, Üü, Vv, Yy, Zz
* Since 1992 (current version of the modern alphabet defined using the Latin script, replacing Ää with the historic Əə for better sorting):
*: Aa, Bb, Cc, Çç, Dd, Ee, Əə, Ff, Gg, Ğğ, Hh, Xx, Iı, İi, Jj, Kk, Qq, Ll, Mm, Nn, Oo, Öö, Pp, Rr, Ss, Şş, Tt, Uu, Üü, Vv, Yy, Zz

The Azerbaijani alphabet is the same as the Turkish alphabet, except for Әə, Xx, and Qq, the letters for sounds which do not exist as separate phonemes in Turkish. When compared to the historic Latin alphabet of 1933, as well as the 1991 version: Ğğ has replaced the historic Ƣƣ; the dotless Iı has replaced the historic I with bowl Ьь (also, the lowercase form of the letter B was changed from small capital ʙ to the usual b, while the uppercase form of the letter y was also changed from a Cyrillic-looking У to the usual Y); the dotted İi has replaced the historic soft-dotted Ii, with the addition of the tittle on its uppercase counterpart, additionally I is now the uppercase counterpart of ı, while i is the lowercase counterpart of İ; Jj has replaced the historic Ƶƶ; Öö has replaced the historic Ɵɵ; Üü has replaced the historic Yy; and Yy has replaced the historic Jј. Әə was replaced by Ää, which was placed between Aa and Bb, but was then changed back to Әə, placed between Ee and Ff in the alphabet. Consequently, Jj, Yy, and some other several letters (Cc, Çç) have also changed their phonetic values in comparison with the historical alphabet.

The sounds and in loanwords were rendered as respectively as q and ƣ in the Latin alphabet of 1933, but as к and г in Cyrillic and are rendered as k and q in the current Latin alphabet: (1933 Latin) — (Cyrillic) — (current Latin).

In translingual contexts (e.g. mathematics), the letters of the ISO basic Latin alphabet are named in Azerbaijani in the following way: &quot;a, be, ce (se), de, e, ef, qe, aş (haş), i, yot, ka, el, em, en, o, pe, ku, er, es, te, u, ve, dubl-ve, iks, iqrek, zet&quot;.

=== Schwa (Ə) ===
When the new Latin script was introduced on 25 December 1991, A-diaeresis (&quot;Ä ä&quot;) was selected to represent the sound /æ/. However, on 16 May 1992, it was replaced by the grapheme schwa (&quot;Ə ə&quot;), used previously. Although use of &quot;Ä ä&quot; (also used in Tatar, Turkmen, and Gagauz) seems to be a simpler alternative as the schwa is absent in most character sets, particularly Turkish encoding, it was reintroduced; the schwa had existed continuously from 1929 to 1991 to represent Azerbaijani&#x27;s most common vowel, in both post-Arabic alphabets (Latin and Cyrillic) of Azerbaijan.

However, the &quot;upside-down &#x27;e&#x27;&quot; on computers caused considerable problems during the early 1990s as its placement on standard Azerbaijani keyboards and its assignment in computer encodings had not yet become standardized.

==Azerbaijani Arabic alphabet==

The development of a modern standardized Azerbaijani Arabic alphabet has been an ongoing project in Iran in the past several decades. Persian alphabet, without modification or standardization is not suitable for Azerbaijani as:

# It contains multiple letters for the same consonant sounds, for example there are two letters for the sound [t] (ت، ط)
# Persian alphabet does not have letters and diacritics for many of the vowels used in Azerbaijani and other Turkic languages.

The first steps in the process of standardization started with the publication of Azerbaijani magazines and newspapers such as Varlıq from 1979. Azerbaijani-speaking scholars and literarians showed great interest in involvement in such ventures and in working towards the development of a standard writing system. These effort culminated in language seminars being held in Tehran, chaired by the founder of Varlıq, Javad Heyat in 2001 where a document outlining the standard orthography and writing conventions were published for the public. This standard of writing is today canonized by the official Persian–Azerbaijani Turkic dictionary in Iran titled &quot;&quot;.

The use of Azerbaijani Arabic alphabet, is widespread. However, due to a failure by the Iranian government to implement the constitutionally-required formal education of Azerbaijani language in the Iranian education system, and due to the spread of use of computers and smartphones, and the ease of using Latin alphabet on these platforms, the Latin alternative from Iran&#x27;s northern neighbor has been gaining popularity in the last two decades.

===Vowels===

In Azerbaijani Arabic alphabet, nine vowels are defined. Six of those vowels are present in Persian, whereas three are missing. Diacritics (including hamza) in combination with the letters &quot;alef&quot; (), &quot;vav&quot; () or &quot;ye&quot; () are used in order to mark each of these vowels.

Important to note that similar to Persian alphabet, vowels in the initial position require an &quot;alef&quot; () all the time—and if needed, followed by either &quot;vav&quot; () or &quot;ye&quot; (). This excludes Arabic loanwords that may start with &quot;ʿayn&quot; ().

Below are the six vowel sounds in common with Persian, their representation in Latin and Arabic alphabets.

* (); ; A front vowel; only marked with &quot;fatha&quot; () diacritic, or with a &quot;he&quot; at middle or final positions in a word. Examples include: , , 
* (); ; A front vowel; marked with a &quot;hamza&quot; on top a &quot;ye&quot; (). Examples include: , 
* (); ; A rounded back vowel; Shown with &quot;vav&quot; (), either unmarked, or marked with sukun (zero-vowel) (). Examples include: , , . 
* (); ; A back vowel; shown with &quot;alef&quot; () in middle and final positions, and &quot;alef-maddeh&quot; () in initial position. Examples include: , 
* () ; A front vowel; shown with a &quot;ye&quot; () and no diacritic. Examples include: , 
* () ; A back vowel; shown with a &quot;vav&quot; and a Ḍammah (). Examples include: , 

Below are the three vowels that don&#x27;t exist in Persian, and are marked with diacritics.
* () ; A front vowel; shown with a &quot;hamza&quot; on top a &quot;vav&quot; (). Examples include: , 
* () ; A front vowel; shown with a &quot;v&quot; diacritic on top a &quot;vav&quot; (). Examples include , , 
* () (rarely used and usually substituted by ); A back vowel; shown with an inverted &quot;v&quot; diacritic on top of a &quot;ye&quot; (). Examples include: , , , 

====Vowel harmony====
Like other Turkic languages, Azerbaijani has a system of vowel harmony. Azerbaijani&#x27;s system of vowel harmony is primarily a front/back system. This means that all vowels in a word must be ones that are pronounced either at the front or at the back of the mouth. In Azerbaijani there are two suffixes that make a plural. It is either or , front and back vowels respectively. The same variety of options for suffixes exists across the board in Azerbaijani. Here is how vowel harmony works, in an example of a word in which the vowels are all frontal: 
* The word for is . The word for is . ( is incorrect.)

And below are examples for back vowels:
* The word for is , thus the word for is .

A secondary vowel harmony system exists in Azerbaijani language, which is a rounded/unrounded system. This applies to some (but not all) of the suffixes. For example, there are four variations for the common suffix and . 
* The word for is . The word for will be .
* In Azerbaijani, the city of Tabriz is . The word for someone from Tabriz is .

====Conventions on writing of vowels====
In the Perso-Arabic script, or in Arabic scripts in general, diacritics are usually not written out, except in texts for beginners or in order to avoid confusion with a similarly written word.

In the Azerbaijani Arabic alphabet, there are conventions with regards to writing of diacritics.

For (), the vowel is always written and shown with &quot;alef&quot;.

For (), the initial vowel is written with an &quot;alef&quot;. Vowels in the middle of the word are written in two ways. They are either shown, i.e. written with a diacritic, which usually needs not be written; or they are written with a final &quot;he&quot; (). The former is used in closed syllables (CVC), or in the first open syllable of the word. The latter is used in open syllables (CV) with the exception of the first syllable of the word. Note that the vowel &quot;he&quot; () is not attached to the following letter, but is separated from it with a Zero-width non-joiner. For example, the word (gə-lə-cəy-im) is written as . Note that the first syllable of the word is open, but it is not marked. The second syllable is open, and thus the vowel is marked with &quot;he&quot; (), not attached to the following letter. Also note the breakdown of the word into syllables – this is because the word is made up of plus possessive pronoun .

For E-e (ائ / ئ), the sound is shown with a &quot;hamzeh&quot; on top of a &quot;ye&quot; in almost all cases. The exceptions are loanwords of Persian, Arabic, or European origin. For example, is written as . Writing it as is incorrect. Other examples include ), , and . In words, for both Azerbaijani and loanwords, if and come side by side, both letters are written; e.g., , , , . Loanwords from Persian or Arabic which contain the sound , but are adopted in Azerbaijani with an sound, are shown with . Examples include , , .

For (), the sound is always shown with &quot;ye&quot; ().

For (), the sound is shown with &quot;ye&quot; () all the time. The writing of the diacritic is optional and not necessary, and is only ever actually done in beginner language lesson books or in order to avoid confusion with a similarly written word. Native speakers can usually read words without the use of diacritic, as they are aware of vowel harmony rules (meaning that they can interpolate the correct pronunciation of by the presence of other vowels in the word). In words like , familiarity with the vocabulary helps native speakers.

For round vowels, (), (), (), and (), it is recommended that the first syllable containing such vowel be marked with diacritic, while the rest can remain unmarked and solely written with a &quot;vav&quot; (). This reduces the effort of marking vowels, while also providing readers with a clue with respect to vowel harmony, namely as to whether the vowels of the word are to be front or back. Examples include , , .

However, it is recommended new learners write diacritics on all round vowels, e.g., , , .

In daily practice, it is rare to see vowels other than () marked. This may be due to the fact that &quot;hamza&quot; is the only one of such symbols that is frequently written in Persian as well, and due to the fact that the inverted &quot;v&quot; diacritic for () does not exist on typical Persian keyboards.

===Consonants===
While Azerbaijani Latin alphabet has nine vowels and twenty-three consonants, Azerbaijani Arabic alphabet has thirty consonants, as there are sounds that are represented by more than one consonant. Highlighted columns indicate letters from Persian or Arabic that are exclusively used in loanwords, and not in native Azerbaijani words.

Notes
# Arabic loanwords that in their original spelling end in ʿayn (ع), such as &quot;طمع&quot; (təmə&#x27;) &quot;(meaning greed)&quot;, or &quot;متاع&quot; (məta&#x27;) &quot;(meaning baggage)&quot;, are instead pronounced in Azerbaijani with a final [h]. Thus they are to be written with a &quot;ح&quot; (&quot;he&quot;). e.g. &quot;طاماح&quot; (tamah), &quot;ماتاح&quot; (matah). (Note that the vowels of these words are also changed in accordance with the vowel harmony system) If the change in pronunciation of ʿayn (ع) happens mid-word, it would be written as &quot;ه / هـ&quot;. An example being &quot;فعله&quot; (fə&#x27;lə) &quot;(meaning worker)&quot; being written as &quot;فهله&quot; (fəhlə).
# Loanwords that start with consonant sequences &quot;SK, ST, SP, ŞT, ŞP&quot;, in Azerbaijani Arabic script, they are to be written starting with an &quot;ای&quot; (i). e.g. ایستئیک (isteyk) &quot;(meaning steak)&quot;, ایسپورت (isport) &quot;(meaning sports)&quot;
# There is a distinction between the pronunciation of &quot;غ&quot; and &quot;ق&quot; in Azerbaijani. Such distinction does not exist in standard Iranian Persian. But in any case, loanwords from Arabic or Persian, regardless of how their &quot;غ&quot; and &quot;ق&quot; is pronounced, are to be kept as their original writing. This is not a rule in Latin alphabet. An example being the word meaning &quot;Afghan&quot;, &quot;افغان&quot; (Əfqan). The &quot;غ&quot; in Azerbaijani is pronounced as a [g], meaning that, as it is done in Latin, it is being pronounced as if it is a &quot;ق&quot;. But the writing of the loanword in Azerbaijani Arabic will remain the same.
# Loanwords whose original spelling was with a &quot;گ&quot; (G g) but are written in Latin alphabet with a Q q, are to be written with a &quot;ق&quot;. Examples include &quot;قاز&quot; (Qaz) &quot;(meaning gas, written as &quot;گاز&quot; in Persian)&quot;, &quot;اوْرتوقرافی&quot; (Orfoqrafi) &quot;(meaning orthography, written as &quot;اورتوگرافی&quot; in Persian)&quot;
# When suffixes are added to words ending in &quot;ک&quot; (K k), resulting in the letter &quot;ک&quot; (K k) being between two vowels, will have its pronunciation modified to [j], equivalent to the letter &quot;ی&quot; (Y y). This change is reflected in Latin writing. However, in the Arabic script, in order to maintain the original familiar shape of the word, the letter &quot;گ&quot; (G g) (functioning in a role dubbed &quot;soft G&quot;) is used, as the letter is similar in shape to &quot;ک&quot;. Examples: &quot;çörək+im&quot; becoming &quot;çörəyim&quot; in Latin script &quot;(meaning my bread)&quot;, but &quot;چؤرک+یم&quot; becoming &quot;چؤرگیم&quot;. &quot;gələcək+im&quot; becoming &quot;gələcəyim&quot; in Latin script &quot;(meaning my future)&quot;, but &quot;گله‌جک+یم&quot; becoming &quot;گله‌جگیم&quot;.
# Whenever the letter &quot;ی&quot; (Y) is placed between two &quot;ای&quot; (İ-i) vowels, it is written as &quot;گ&quot; (G g) (functioning in a role dubbed &quot;soft G&quot;). This is not something done in Latin script. Example: &quot;ایگیرمی&quot; (iyirmi) &quot;(meaning twenty)&quot;
# The letters &quot;و&quot; ,&quot;ه / هـ&quot;, and &quot;ی&quot; have a double function, as consonant, and as part of vowels. When used as consonant, they are written with no diacritic or marking.
# Shadda, the Arabic diacritic for gemination, is retained for loanwords from Arabic. Examples: &quot;مۆکمّل&quot; (mükəmməl) &quot;(meaning complementary)&quot;, &quot;مدنیّت&quot; (mədəniyyət) &quot;(meaning civility)&quot;. In native Azerbaijani words and in loanwords of European origin, double consonants are written twice. Examples: &quot;یئددی&quot; (yeddi) &quot;(meaning seven)&quot;, &quot;ساققال&quot; (saqqal) &quot;(meaning beard)&quot;, &quot;اوْتللو&quot; (Otello).
==Comparison of Azerbaijani alphabets==
===National anthem===
This section contains the national anthem of Azerbaijan, in the current Latin, Cyrillic, Jaŋalif, Georgian, and Arabic alphabets.

== Transliteration ==
The Arabic, Latin, and Cyrillic alphabets each have a different sequence of letters. The table below is ordered according to the latest Latin alphabet:


The Azerbaijani Arabic alphabet originally contained the letter ڴ. Originally ڴ stood for the sound [ŋ], which then merged with [n]. Initial versions of the Azerbaijani Latin alphabet contained the letter Ꞑꞑ, which was dropped in 1938. This letter no longer exists in the Azerbaijani Arabic orthographic conventions anymore either.

The letter Цц, intended for the sound [ts] in loanwords, was used in Azerbaijani Cyrillic until 1951. In Azerbaijani, like in most Turkic languages, the sound [ts] generally becomes [s].

The apostrophe was used until 2004 in loanwords from Arabic for representing the glottal stop or vowel length. Since 2004, the apostrophe is not used in Azerbaijani except in foreign proper names.

<text>The GAA Hurling All-Ireland Senior Championship, known simply as the All-Ireland Championship, is an annual inter-county hurling competition organised by the Gaelic Athletic Association (GAA). It is the highest-tier competition for inter-county hurling in Ireland and has been contested in every year except one since 1887.

The final, formerly held in September, then August and now moved to July, is the culmination of a series of games played during July and August, with the winning team receiving the Liam MacCarthy Cup. The All-Ireland Championship has been played on a straight knockout basis for the majority of its existence, whereby a team&#x27;s first loss eliminated them from the championship. In more recent years, the qualification procedures for the championship have changed several times. Currently, qualification is limited to teams competing in 3 feeder competitions; three teams from the Leinster Senior Hurling Championship, three teams from the Munster Senior Hurling Championship and two teams who qualify to the All-Ireland preliminary quarter-finals from the second-tier Joe McDonagh Cup. Annual promotion and relegation allows teams outside these competitions (teams from the Christy Ring Cup - tier 3, the Nicky Rackard Cup - tier 4 and the Lory Meagher Cup - tier 5) to eventually reach the All-Ireland Senior Hurling Championship.

Seventeen teams currently participate in the All-Ireland Championship, with the most successful coming from the provinces of Leinster and Munster. 13 different teams have won the title, 10 of whom have been champions more than once. Kilkenny are the competition&#x27;s most successful team, having been All-Ireland champions on 36 occasions. Kilkenny, Cork and Tipperary are considered &quot;the big three&quot; of hurling and hold 94 championships between them. The current title holders are Clare, who defeated Cork by 3–29 to 1–34 in the 2024 final. This was Clare&#x27;s fifth All Ireland hurling title, and their first since 2013.

The All-Ireland Senior Hurling Championship final was listed in second place by CNN in its &quot;10 sporting events you have to see live&quot;, after the Olympic Games.

==History==
===Creation===
Following the foundation of the Gaelic Athletic Association in 1884, new rules for Gaelic football and hurling were drawn up and published in the &quot;United Irishman&quot; newspaper. In 1886, county committees began to be established, with several counties affiliating over the next few years. The GAA ran its inaugural All-Ireland Senior Hurling Championship in 1887. The decision to establish that first championship was influenced by several factors. Firstly, inter-club contests in 1885 and 1886 were wildly popular and began to draw huge crowds. Clubs started to travel across the country to play against each other and these matches generated intense interest as the newspapers began to speculate which teams might be considered the best in the country. Secondly, although the number of clubs was growing, many were slow to affiliate to the Association, leaving it short of money. Establishing a central championship held the prospect of enticing GAA clubs to process their affiliations, just as the establishment of the FA Cup had done much in the 1870s to promote the development of the Football Association in England. The championships were open to all affiliated clubs who would first compete in county-based competitions, to be run by local county committees. The winners of each county championship would then proceed to represent that county in the All-Ireland series.

===Beginnings===
The inaugural All-Ireland Championship used, for the only time in its history, an open draw format without the provincial series of games. All of the existing county boards were eligible to enter a team, however, only six chose to do so. Disputes in Cork and Limerick over which club should represent the county resulted in neither county fielding a team. Dublin later withdrew from the championship. In all five teams participated: Clare (Garraunboy Smith O&#x27;Briens), Galway (Meelick), Kilkenny (Tullaroan) Tipperary (Thurles) and Wexford (Castlebridge).

Galway and Wexford contested the very first championship match on Saturday 2 July 1887. Postponements, disqualifications, objections, withdrawals and walkovers were regular occurrences during the initial years of the championship. The inaugural All-Ireland final took place on 1 April 1888 in Birr, County Offaly, with Tipperary defeating Galway to take the title.

===Development===
The provincial championships were introduced in 1888 in Munster, Leinster, Connacht and Ulster on a knock-out basis. The winners of the provincial finals participated in the All-Ireland semi-finals. Over time the Leinster and Munster teams grew to become the superpowers of the game, as Gaelic football was the more dominant sport in Ulster and Connacht. After some time Galway became the only credible team in Connacht and was essentially given an automatic pass to the All-Ireland semi-final every year. This knock-out system persisted for over 100 years and was considered to be the fairest system as the All-Ireland champions would always be the only undefeated team of the year.

Unlike in other European countries, such as neighbouring England, where annual sports events were cancelled during the twentieth century due to the First and Second World Wars, the All-Ireland Championship has been running continuously since 1887, with the final running since 1889 (the 1888 competition was played but no final was held due to the Invasion). The competition continued even in spite of the effects on the country of the Civil War and the Second World War (the National Hurling League was not held during the latter). In 1941, the All-Ireland Championship was disrupted by an outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease.

The duration of certain championship matches increased from 60 to 80 minutes during the 1970s. They were settled at 70 minutes after five seasons of this in 1975. This applied only to the provincial finals, All-Ireland semi-finals and finals.

In the mid-1990s the Gaelic Athletic Association looked at developing a new system whereby a defeat in the championship for certain teams would not mean an immediate exit from the Championship. In the 1997 championship the first major change in format arrived when the &#x27;back-door system&#x27; was introduced. This new structure allowed the defeated Munster and Leinster finalists another chance to regain a place in the All-Ireland semi-finals. Tipperary and Kilkenny were the first two teams to benefit from the new system when they defeated Down and Galway respectively in the quarter-finals. The All-Ireland final in the first year of this new experiment was a replay of the Munster final with Clare defeating Tipperary. The first team to win the All-Ireland through the &#x27;back-door&#x27; was Offaly in 1998, winning a replay of the Leinster final by beating Kilkenny 2–16 to 1–13.
The new &quot;back-door system&quot; proved successful and was expanded over the following years. The 2005 Championship saw even bigger changes in the &quot;back-door&quot; or qualifier system. The Munster and Leinster champions and defeated finalists automatically qualified for the new quarter-final stages, while two groups of four other teams played in a league format to fill the vacant four places in the quarter-finals. Many criticised the structure for not being a real championship at all, for degrading the Munster and Leinster championships and for penalising the strongest teams.

2008 brought a change to the competition format, whereby the team that won the Leinster and Munster championships advanced to the All-Ireland semi-finals, and the losers of the provincial finals advanced to two quarter-finals. A series of knockout qualifiers for the remaining teams decided which other two teams would reach the quarter-finals. The updated qualifier structure provided more games and gave renewed hope to the &quot;weaker&quot; teams, as a defeat in the first round no longer meant the end of a county&#x27;s All-Ireland ambitions.

Since 2018, the All-Ireland SHC final is held on the third Sunday in August.

==Format==

Group stage (15 matches): Each team plays each other once. The 1st and 2nd placed teams advance to the Leinster final and the 3rd placed team advances to the all-Ireland preliminary quarter-finals. All other teams are eliminated from the championship and the bottom placed team may face relegation to next years Joe McDonagh Cup.

Final (1 match): The top 2 teams in the group stage contest this game. The Leinster champions advance to the All-Ireland semi-finals and the Leinster runners-up advance to the All-Ireland quarter-finals.

==== Munster Championship (five teams) ====
Group stage (10 matches): Each team plays each other once. The 1st and 2nd placed teams advance to the Munster final and the 3rd placed team advances to the all-Ireland preliminary quarter-finals.

Teams who may have already met in the provincial championships are kept apart in separate quarter-finals. Two teams are eliminated at this stage while the winners advance to the semi-finals.

Semi-finals (2 matches): The winners of the quarter-finals join the Leinster and Munster champions to make up the semi-final pairings. Teams who may have already met in the provincial championships are kept apart in separate semi-finals where possible. Two teams are eliminated at this stage while the winners advance to the final.

==Venues==

===Attendances===
Stadium attendances are a significant source of regular income for the GAA and for the teams involved. For the 2017 championship, the average attendances for the five games was 56,565 with a total aggregate attendance figure of 282,826. The 2017 figure represented the highest combined total for an All-Ireland Championship since 2012, when 294,079 fans attended six games, including a final replay between Kilkenny and Galway. The highest all-time aggregate attendance for the championship was 332,387 in 2007 when eight games were played.

===Quarter-finals===
Croke Park was initially used as the venue for All-Ireland quarter-finals following their introduction in 1997. These games were usually played as a double-header. From 2008 until 2017 the quarter-finals were played at Semple Stadium in Thurles.

===Semi-finals===
The All-Ireland semi-finals have been played exclusively at Croke Park since 1977. Croke Park had been regularly used as a semi-final venue prior to this, however, a number of other stadiums around the country were also used. St Brendan&#x27;s Park and St Cronan&#x27;s Park were regularly used for semi-finals involving Kilkenny and Galway. Other regular semi-final venues included the Markets Field, Páirc Uí Chaoimh, St Ciarán&#x27;s Park, the Cork Athletic Grounds and Cusack Park. Since introduction of the back door in 1997 less All Ireland hurling semi-finals involved Galway. Ulster team never reached the semi-final stage if the pre 1997 system had stayed Ulster hurling champions would possibly be still playing in the All Ireland semi-finals.

===Final===
Since 1910, Croke Park has been the regular venue for the All-Ireland final. Only on two occasions since then has the final been played outside of Croke Park. Construction of the Cusack Stand in 1937 meant that that year&#x27;s final was played at the newly opened FitzGerald Stadium in Killarney. In 1984 the GAA celebrated its centenary by playing the All-Ireland final at Semple Stadium in Thurles.

In the years prior to 1910, the All-Ireland final was held in a variety of locations around the country, including Jones&#x27;s Road as Croke Park was known before its dedication to Thomas Croke. The inaugural final in 1887 was played at Birr, before Dublin venues Clonturk Park, the Pond Field and the Phoenix Park were used in the early 1890s. Fraher Field hosted the final on three occasions, while the final was played at the newly opened Cork Athletic Grounds on two occasions.

==Managers==

Managers in the All-Ireland Championship are involved in the day-to-day running of the team, including the training, team selection, and sourcing of players from the club championships. Their influence varies from county-to-county and is related to the individual county boards. From 2018, all inter-county head coaches must be Award 2 qualified. The manager is assisted by a team of two or three selectors and an extensive backroom team consisting of various coaches. Prior to the development of the concept of a manager in the 1970s, teams were usually managed by a team of selectors with one member acting as chairman.

==Trophy and medals==
At the end of the All-Ireland final, the winning team is presented with a trophy. The Liam MacCarthy Cup is held by the winning team until the following year&#x27;s final. Traditionally, the presentation is made at a special rostrum in the Ard Chomairle section of the Hogan Stand where GAA and political dignitaries and special guests view the match.

The cup is decorated with ribbons in the colours of the winning team. During the game the cup actually has both teams&#x27; sets of ribbons attached and the runners-up ribbons are removed before the presentation. The winning captain accepts the cup on behalf of his team before giving a short speech. Individual members of the winning team then have an opportunity to come to the rostrum to lift the cup.

The Liam MacCarthy Cup commemorates the memory of Liam MacCarthy. Born in London to Irish parents in 1851, he was prominently involved in the establishment of a county board in London in the 1890s. In 1922 he presented the GAA with £500 to commission a cup for the All-Ireland champions. The cup, which was constructed to look like a medieval Irish drinking vessel called a mather, was made by jeweller Edmund Johnson at his premises on Dublin&#x27;s Grafton Street. It replaced the Great Southern Cup as the All-Ireland trophy and was first presented to Bob McConkey of Limerick in 1923.

Declan Carr of Tipperary was the last recipient of the original Liam MacCarthy Cup in 1991 before it was retired. It is now on display in the GAA Museum in Croke Park. JMK Gold &amp; Silversmith&#x27;s produced an exact replica which was first awarded to Liam Fennelly of Kilkenny in 1992.

In accordance with GAA rules, the Central Council awards up to twenty-six gold medals to the winners of the All-Ireland final. The medals are 9 carat gold and depict the design of the GAA. Trophies are awarded to the All-Ireland runners-up. A miniature replica of the Liam MacCarthy Cup is awarded to the captain of the winning team.

==Sponsorship==
Since 1995, the All-Ireland Championship has been sponsored. The sponsor has usually been able to determine the championship&#x27;s sponsorship name.

==Media coverage==
From the early 1920s, British Pathé recorded newsreel footage of the All-Ireland finals which was later shown in cinemas around the country. The National Film Institute and Gael Linn later produced their own newsreels of All-Ireland finals with Michael O&#x27;Hehir providing commentary. These newsreels were staples for cinema-goers until the 1960s.

Following the establishment of 2RN, Ireland&#x27;s first radio broadcasting station, on 1 January 1926, sports coverage, albeit infrequent, was a feature of the schedules. Early broadcasts consisted of team announcements and short reports on events of interest. 2RN recorded a broadcasting first on 29 August 1926, when former hurler and journalist P.D. Mehigan carried a live commentary of the All-Ireland semi-final between Kilkenny and Galway. It was the first live radio broadcast of a field game outside of the United States. Although there was no designated sports department within Irish radio for many years, a two-way relationship between the national broadcaster and the GAA was quickly established. As well as exclusive live commentaries, Seán Ó Ceallacháin began broadcasting a weekly results programme on Radio Éireann in 1930.

When Telefís Éireann was established on 31 December 1961, the new station was interested in the broadcasting of championship games. The GAA, however, were wary that live television coverage would result in lower attendances at games. Because of this, the association restricted annual coverage of its games to the All-Ireland hurling and football finals, the two All-Ireland football semi-finals and the two Railway Cup finals. The first live broadcast of a hurling championship match was the All-Ireland final between Tipperary and Wexford on 2 September 1962. While the All-Ireland semi-finals were reintroduced in 1969, RTÉ was still confined to just broadcasting the final. In spite of this, highlights of the semi-finals were regularly shown.

The All-Ireland final between Tipperary and Kilkenny on 5 September 1971 was the first to be broadcast in colour.

The first All-Ireland semi-final to be broadcast live was the meeting of Cork and Galway on 7 August 1977. The popularity of the evening highlights programme led to the development of &quot;The Sunday Game&quot;, which was first broadcast on 8 July 1979. For the early years financial and logistical reasons restricted the programme to featuring just one full championship game and discussion about it. The show, however, soon expanded featuring coverage of one or more of the day&#x27;s main championship games, followed by extended highlights of the other major games of the day.

The 1981 All-Ireland final between Offaly and Galway was simultaneously broadcast on RTÉ 1 and RTÉ 2, with Ger Canning providing commentary in the Irish language on the secondary channel.

In 1983, Channel 4 began broadcasting RTÉ&#x27;s coverage of the All-Ireland final in Britain. This simulcast lasted until 1992 when the live broadcast was dropped; however, the entire match was shown at a later time.

In 2014, the GAA signed a three-year broadcasting deal with Sky Sports. While Sky were granted exclusive rights to some high-profile games, they were also permitted to broadcast live coverage of the All-Ireland semi-finals and final, however, these games were also broadcast live on RTÉ.

===Scoring records===
==== Scoring statistics ====

* In 1971 Eddie Keher of Kilkenny broke his own record of 14 points from the 1963 final by capturing 2–11 against Tipperary (although his team lost). This record was broken by Nicky English of Tipperary in 1989 when he scored 2–12 against Antrim. Keher&#x27;s tally of 6–45 in the 1972 championship is also a record.
* The official hurling records owned and published by Croke Park, and authenticated by the county historians of participating counties, note three records. (This information comes from p. 40 of official programme published the GAA on the day of 2005 final between Cork and Galway).
* (1) The 80 minute final. This 80 minute final took place in 1971 between Tipperary and Kilkenny. Eddie Keher scored 2-11 which makes a total of 17 points. However 2-8 of this was scored from frees. (2) The record for all 70 minute finals. This record was made in 1989. This hurling final was between Tipperary and Antrim. Nicholas English scored 2-12 points which equals a total of 18 points. However 0-9 of this was achieved from frees. (3) The 60 minute final: The overall scoring record is held by Michael Gah Ahern the greatest sharpshooter of the 1920s and early 1930s. He scored 5–4. What makes this scoring record remarkable is that he scored all of his scores from his hands.
* Nicky Rackard of Wexford got the highest total in a championship game. In Wexford&#x27;s 12−17 to 2–3 defeat of Antrim in the 1954 semi-final, he scored a remarkable 7-7.
* Prior to the 1930s, scoring records for championship games were rarely kept. A number of players have been credited with enormous tallies. Andy &#x27;Dooric&#x27; Buckley scored at least 6 goals when Cork beat Kilkenny by 8–9 to 0–8 in the 1903 All-Ireland &#x27;home&#x27; final. Other newspaper reports credit him with 7 goals and 4 points.
* P. J. Riordan is alleged to have scored all but 1 point of Tipperary&#x27;s total when they beat Kilkenny by 6–8 to 0−1 in the 1895 All-Ireland final.
* Jimmy Kelly of Kilkenny is said to have scored 7 goals in 30 minutes against Cork in the replay of the 1905 final.
* In 1990 the rule prohibiting a hand-passed score was introduced. This had a large bearing on scoring, with fewer goals being scored in open play.

<text>In church architecture, the chancel is the space around the altar, including the choir and the sanctuary (sometimes called the presbytery), at the liturgical east end of a traditional Christian church building. It may terminate in an apse.

==Overview==
The chancel is generally the area used by the clergy and choir during worship, while the congregation is in the nave. Direct access may be provided by a priest&#x27;s door, usually on the south side of the church. This is one definition, sometimes called the &quot;strict&quot; one; in practice in churches where the eastern end contains other elements such as an ambulatory and side chapels, these are also often counted as part of the chancel, especially when discussing architecture. In smaller churches, where the altar is backed by the outside east wall and there is no distinct choir, the chancel and sanctuary may be the same area. In churches with a retroquire area behind the altar, this may only be included in the broader definition of chancel.

In a cathedral or other large church, there may be a distinct choir area at the start of the chancel (looking from the nave), before reaching the sanctuary, and an ambulatory may run beside and behind it. All these may be included in the chancel, at least in architectural terms (see above). In many churches, the altar has now been moved to the front of the chancel, in what was built as the choir area, or to the centre of the transept, somewhat confusing the distinction between chancel, choir and sanctuary. In churches with less traditional plans, the term may not be useful in either architectural or ecclesiastical terms. The chancel may be a step or two higher than the level of the nave, and the sanctuary is often raised still further. The chancel is very often separated from the nave by altar rails, or a rood screen, a sanctuary bar, or an open space, and its width and roof height is often different from that of the nave; usually the chancel will be narrower and lower.

In churches with a traditional Latin cross plan, and a transept and central crossing, the chancel usually begins at the eastern side of the central crossing, often under an extra-large chancel arch supporting the crossing and the roof. This is an arch which separates the chancel from the nave and transept of a church. If the chancel, strictly defined as choir and sanctuary, does not fill the full width of a medieval church, there will usually be some form of low wall or screen at its sides, demarcating it from the ambulatory or parallel side chapels.

As well as the altar, the sanctuary may house a credence table and seats for officiating and assisting ministers. In some churches, the congregation may gather on three sides or in a semicircle around the chancel. In some churches, the pulpit and lectern may be in the chancel, but in others these, especially the pulpit, are in the nave. The presbytery is often adorned with chancel flowers.

==Name==
The word &quot;chancel&quot; derives from the French usage of &quot;chancel&quot; from the Late Latin word &quot;cancellus&quot; (&quot;lattice&quot;). This refers to the typical form of rood screens. The chancel was formerly known as the &quot;presbytery&quot;, because it was reserved for the clergy.

==History==
In Early Christian architecture the templon was a barrier dividing off the sanctuary from the rest of the church; in Eastern Christianity this developed into different arrangements from those of the Western church, with the sanctuary often not visible to the congregation. In the West the ciborium, an open-walled but usually roofed structure sheltering the altar, became common, and was originally fitted with curtains that were drawn and pulled back at different points in the Mass, in a way that some Oriental Orthodox churches still practice today.

A large (or &quot;deep&quot;) chancel made most sense in monasteries and cathedrals where there was a large number of singing clergy and boys from a choir school to occupy the choir. In many orders &quot;choir monk&quot; was a term used to distinguish the educated monks who had taken full vows, or were training to do so, from another class, called &quot;lay brothers&quot; or other terms, who had taken lesser vows and mostly did manual tasks, including farming the monastery&#x27;s land. These usually sat in the nave, with any lay congregation.

Following the exposition of the doctrine of transubstantiation at the fourth Lateran Council of 1215, clergy were required to ensure that the blessed sacrament was to be kept protected from irreverent access or abuse; and accordingly the area of the church used by the lay congregation was to be screened off from that used by the clergy. This distinction was enforced by the development of canon law, by which the construction and upkeep of the chancel was the responsibility of the rector, whereas the construction and upkeep of the nave was the responsibility of the parish. Barriers demarcating the chancel became increasingly elaborate, but were largely swept away after both the Protestant Reformation and then the Counter-Reformation prioritized the congregation having a good view of what was happening in the chancel. Now the low communion rail is generally the only barrier; despite being essentially a Counter-Reformation invention, this has proved useful and accepted in the Protestant churches that dispense communion. However the screen enjoyed a small revival in the 19th century, after the passionate urgings of Augustus Pugin, who wrote &quot;A Treatise on Chancel Screens and Rood Lofts&quot;, and others.

After the Reformation Protestant churches generally moved the altar (now often called the communion table) forward, typically to the front of the chancel, and often used lay choirs who were placed in a gallery at the west end. The rear of deep chancels became little used in churches surviving from the Middle Ages, and new churches very often omitted one. With the emphasis on sermons, and their audibility, some churches simply converted their chancels to seat part of the congregation. In 19th-century England one of the battles of the Cambridge Camden Society, the architectural wing of the Anglo-Catholics in the Church of England, was to restore the chancel as a necessary part of a church. By pushing the altar back to its medieval position and having the choir used by a lay choir, they were largely successful in this, although the harder end of the High Church objected to allowing a large group of laity into the chancel. Different approaches to worship in the 20th century again tended to push altars in larger churches forward, to be closer to the congregation, and the chancel again risks being a less used area of the church.

<doc id="780817" wikidata="Q1028939" url="?curid=780817" title="Lightweight markup language">
<text>A lightweight markup language (LML), also termed a simple or humane markup language, is a markup language with simple, unobtrusive syntax. It is designed to be easy to write using any generic text editor and easy to read in its raw form. Lightweight markup languages are used in applications where it may be necessary to read the raw document as well as the final rendered output.

For instance, a person downloading a software library might prefer to read the documentation in a text editor rather than a web browser. Another application for such languages is to provide for data entry in web-based publishing, such as blogs and wikis, where the input interface is a simple text box. The server software then converts the input into a common document markup language like HTML.

== History ==
Lightweight markup languages were originally used on text-only displays which could not display characters in italics or bold, so informal methods to convey this information had to be developed. This formatting choice was naturally carried forth to plain-text email communications. Console browsers may also resort to similar display conventions.

In 1986 international standard SGML provided facilities to define and parse lightweight markup languages using grammars and tag implication. The 1998 W3C XML is a profile of SGML that omits these facilities. However, no SGML document type definition (DTD) for any of the languages listed below is known.

== Types ==
Lightweight markup languages can be categorized by their tag types. Like HTML (codice_1), some languages use named elements that share a common format for start and end tags (e.g. BBCode codice_2), whereas proper lightweight markup languages are restricted to ASCII-only punctuation marks and other non-letter symbols for tags, but some also mix both styles (e.g. Textile codice_3) or allow embedded HTML (e.g. Markdown), possibly extended with custom elements (e.g. MediaWiki codice_4).

Most languages distinguish between markup for lines or blocks and for shorter spans of texts, but some only support inline markup.

Some markup languages are tailored for a specific purpose, such as documenting computer code (e.g. POD, reST, RD) or being converted to a certain output format (usually HTML or LaTeX) and nothing else, others are more general in application. This includes whether they are oriented on textual presentation or on data serialization.

Presentation oriented languages include AsciiDoc, atx, BBCode, Creole, Crossmark, Djot, Epytext, Haml, JsonML, MakeDoc, Markdown, Org-mode, POD (Perl), reST (Python), RD (Ruby), Setext, SiSU, SPIP, Xupl, Texy!, Textile, txt2tags, UDO and Wikitext.

Data serialization oriented languages include Curl (homoiconic, but also reads JSON; every object serializes), JSON, and YAML.
== Comparison of language features ==

Markdown&#x27;s own syntax does not support class attributes or id attributes; however, since Markdown supports the inclusion of native HTML code, these features can be implemented using direct HTML. (Some extensions may support these features.)

txt2tags&#x27; own syntax does not support class attributes or id attributes; however, since txt2tags supports inclusion of native HTML code in tagged areas, these features can be implemented using direct HTML when saving to an HTML target.

DokuWiki does not support HTML import natively, but HTML to DokuWiki converters and importers exist and are mentioned in the official documentation. DokuWiki does not support class or id attributes, but can be set up to support HTML code, which does support both features. HTML code support was built-in before release 2023-04-04. In later versions, HTML code support can be achieved through plugins, though it is discouraged.

== Comparison of implementation features ==

== Comparison of lightweight markup language syntax ==
=== Inline span syntax ===
Although usually documented as yielding italic and bold text, most lightweight markup processors output semantic HTML elements codice_5 and codice_6 instead. Monospaced text may either result in semantic codice_7 or presentational codice_8 elements. Few languages make a distinction, e.g. Textile, or allow the user to configure the output easily, e.g. Texy.

LMLs sometimes differ for multi-word markup where some require the markup characters to replace the inter-word spaces (&quot;infix&quot;).
Some languages require a single character as prefix and suffix, other need doubled or even tripled ones or support both with slightly different meaning, e.g. different levels of emphasis.

Gemtext does not have any inline formatting, monospaced text (called preformatted text in the context of Gemtext) must have the opening and closing codice_9 on their own lines.

==== Emphasis syntax ====

In HTML, text is emphasized with the codice_10 and codice_11 element types, whereas codice_12 and codice_13 traditionally mark up text to be italicized or bold-faced, respectively.

Microsoft Word and Outlook, and accordingly other word processors and mail clients that strive for a similar user experience, support the basic convention of using asterisks for boldface and underscores for italic style. While Word removes the characters, Outlook retains them.


==== Editorial syntax ====

In HTML, removed or deleted and inserted text is marked up with the codice_14 and codice_15 element types, respectively. However, legacy element types codice_16 or codice_17 and codice_18 are still also available for stricken and underlined spans of text.

AsciiDoc, ATX, Creole, MediaWiki, PmWiki, reST, Slack, Textile, Texy! and WhatsApp do not support dedicated markup for underlining text. Textile does, however, support insertion via the codice_19 syntax.

AsciiDoc, ATX, Creole, MediaWiki, PmWiki, reST, Setext and Texy! do not support dedicated markup for striking through text.

DokuWiki supports HTML-like codice_20 syntax, even with embedded HTML disabled. 

==== Programming syntax ====

Quoted computer code is traditionally presented in typewriter-like fonts where each character occupies the same fixed width. HTML offers the semantic &lt;code&gt;codice_4 and the deprecated, presentational codice_22 element types for this task.

Mediawiki and Gemtext do not provide lightweight markup for inline code spans.

=== Heading syntax ===

Headings are usually available in up to six levels, but the top one is often reserved to contain the same as the document title, which may be set externally. Some documentation may associate levels with divisional types, e.g. part, chapter, section, article or paragraph.

Most LMLs follow one of two styles for headings, either Setext-like underlines or atx-like line markers, or they support both.

==== Underlined headings ====

The first style uses underlines, i.e. repeated characters (e.g. equals codice_23, hyphen codice_24 or tilde codice_25, usually at least two or four times) in the line below the heading text.
RST determines heading levels dynamically, which makes authoring more individual on the one hand, but complicates merges from external sources on the other hand.

==== Prefixed headings ====

The second style is based on repeated markers (e.g. hash codice_26, equals codice_23 or asterisk codice_28) at the start of the heading itself, where the number of repetitions indicates the (sometimes inverse) heading level. Most languages also support the reduplication of the markers at the end of the line, but whereas some make them mandatory, others do not even expect their numbers to match.

Org-mode supports indentation as a means of indicating the level.

BBCode does not support section headings at all.

POD and Textile choose the HTML convention of numbered heading levels instead.

Microsoft Word supports auto-formatting paragraphs as headings if they do not contain more than a handful of words, no period at the end and the user hits the enter key twice. For lower levels, the user may press the tabulator key the according number of times before entering the text, i.e. one through eight tabs for heading levels two through nine.

=== Link syntax ===
Hyperlinks can either be added inline, which may clutter the code because of long URLs, or with named codice_29 or numbered codice_30 references to lines containing nothing but the address and related attributes and often may be located anywhere in the document.
Most languages allow the author to specify text codice_31 to be displayed instead of the plain address codice_32 and some also provide methods to set a different link title codice_33 which may contain more information about the destination.

LMLs that are tailored for special setups, e.g. wikis or code documentation, may automatically generate named anchors (for headings, functions etc.) inside the document, link to related pages (possibly in a different namespace) or provide a textual search for linked keywords.

Most languages employ (double) square or angular brackets to surround links, but hardly any two languages are completely compatible. Many can automatically recognize and parse absolute URLs inside the text without further markup.

Gemtext and setext links must be on a line by themselves, they cannot be used inline.

Org-mode&#x27;s normal link syntax does a text search of the file. You can also put in dedicated targets with codice_34.
=== List syntax ===
HTML requires an explicit element for the list, specifying its type, and one for each list item, but most lightweight markup languages need only different line prefixes for the bullet points or enumerated items. Some languages rely on indentation for nested lists, others use repeated parent list markers.

Microsoft Word automatically converts paragraphs that start with an asterisk codice_28, hyphen-minus codice_24 or greater-than bracket codice_37 followed by a space or horizontal tabulator as bullet list items. It will also start an enumerated list for the digit &quot;1&quot; and the case-insensitive letters &quot;a&quot; (for alphabetic lists) or &quot;i&quot; (for roman numerals), if they are followed by a period codice_38, a closing round parenthesis codice_39, a greater-than sign codice_37 or a hyphen-minus codice_24 and a space or tab; in case of the round parenthesis an optional opening one codice_42 before the list marker is also supported.

Languages differ on whether they support optional or mandatory digits in numbered list items, which kinds of enumerators they understand (e.g. decimal digit &quot;1&quot;, roman numerals &quot;i&quot; or &quot;I&quot;, alphabetic letters &quot;a&quot; or &quot;A&quot;) and whether they support to keep explicit values in the output format. Some Markdown dialects, for instance, will respect a start value other than 1, but ignore any other explicit value.

Slack assists the user in entering enumerated and bullet lists, but does not actually format them as such, i.e. it just includes a leading digit followed by a period and a space or a bullet character codice_43 in front of a line.

<text>Intrado, formerly West Corporation, is an American telecommunications company. It was purchased by private equity firm Apollo Global Management on October 11, 2017.

==Business Operations==

Intrado is reorganized in five main segments: Cloud Collaboration, Life and Safety (including 911 operations), Enterprise Communications, Digital Media (including streaming operations), and Health and Wellness (including healthcare claims and customer support) in 2019. It spun out its telemarketing brand to West Revenue Generation Services (WRGS), also owned by Apollo Global Management in 2019

==History==

Gary and Mary West co-founded WATS Marketing of America in 1978. The couple left the company in 1985 and Mary West founded West Teleservices with Troy Eaden in 1986. Gary West joined West Teleservices one year later as chairman.

During the first decade, West Teleservices hired thousands of employees and reached over $100 million in net proceeds. West Teleservices expanded their products through a series of acquisitions, including Tel Mark Sales Inc., Intercall, Televox, and HyperCube.

In November 1996, West went public with 2,000 employees.

In 2002, West acquired Tel Mark Sales, Dakotah Direct, and Attention, LLC.
The following year, West acquired conferencing company InterCall and ConferenceCall.com.

In 2006, West which had been publicly traded since 1996, recapitalized under the sponsorship of investor groups led by Thomas H. Lee Partners and Quadrangle Group. Gary and Mary West continued to maintain 25 percent of the company.

In January 2015, West announced the sale of its agent services businesses to Alorica. The sale closed in early March 2015.

In October 2017, West was purchased by Apollo Global Management, a New York-based private equity firm, for $5.2 billion.

On August 31, 2018 West Corporation laid off 148 employees between their Middleton, WI and Green Bay, WI location after losing a major contract.

On June 25, 2019 West Corporation rebranded itself to Intrado.

On September 11, 2020 Intrado acquired Syn-Apps LLC, developer of mass notification software.

On December 20, 2020 Intrado acquired Asparia

On January 31, 2023 Stonepeak acquired Intrado Life &amp; Safety for $2.4 billion. The Intrado name and brand will transition with the safety business. Intrado Corporation rebranded its remaining holdings to West Technology Group, LLC.

On October 2, 2023 Matt Carter was appointed CEO of Intrado Life &amp; Safety replacing Jeff Robertson.

==Name history==
* November 1996: West TeleServices Corporation
* January 1, 2001: West Corporation
* June 25, 2019: Intrado

==Controversies==
In April 2014, Intrado was partially responsible for a 14-state 911 outage that affected an estimated 11 million people and 6,000 emergency help calls. As a result, the FCC fined Intrado $1.4 million.

In November 2019, Intrado agreed to pay $175,000 to the US Treasury due to glitches in their system that occurred in August 2018 that left millions without access to 911 access for 65 minutes across 6 states.

In September 2020, 911 outages were reported across 14 states for more than an hour due in part to Intrado.

==Acquisitions==

Between 2002 and 2013, West Corporation invested approximately $2.7 billion in strategic acquisitions.

West has acquired:

The company&#x27;s flagship product is the Nautilus file manager for the GNOME desktop environment on Linux, which was immediately adopted and maintained by the free software movement. As the core of Eazel&#x27;s business model, it is an early example of cloud storage services in the form of personal file storage, transparently and portably stored on the Internet.

==History==
Eazel was founded by Andy Hertzfeld in August 1999 in Mountain View, California. It had 22 initial employees and raised from several venture capital investment companies. Initially, all the programmers worked on every aspect of the product and eventually specialized on its components.

The company grew from 22 employees in 1999 to 75 employees in 2001 and was named one of the top 10 companies to watch among &quot;earsplitting buzz surrounding Linux&quot;, by &quot;Red Herring&quot; magazine.

Staff consisted of former employees of many technology companies such as Apple, Netscape, Be Inc., Linuxcare, Microsoft, Red Hat, and Sun Microsystems. Mike Boich was CEO, having been a major figure at Apple and co-founder of Radius; Bud Tribble was VP of Engineering, having been software manager and a designer of the original Macintosh project; Andy Hertzfeld was a principal designer, having been a lead software engineer and a designer of the original Macintosh project; Darin Adler led development, having been the technical lead for System 7 for the Macintosh; and Susan Kare designed new vector graphics-based iconography, having designed the original Macintosh icons. Other staff included programmer Maciej Stachowiak, who was a programmer and board member for GNOME; and board member Michael Homer, formerly of Apple, AOL, and Netscape.

Eazel&#x27;s flagship product is the Nautilus file manager for the GNOME desktop environment. In this, the company faced several simultaneous challenges: creating a lot of intricate user-facing software from scratch or from existing code which must target all the disparate Linux environment versions; integrating a corporate personality into the existing and outspoken volunteer community of the GNOME desktop environment; building upon a very small nascent market of Linux desktop users among an already widely served and monopolized desktop computing market; and monetizing free software for individual consumers by creating essential business services. In other words, Eazel sought to switch a groundswell of users from Macintosh and Windows to a new and immature system that free software users would want to pay for. Of the two predominant free desktop environments for Linux, the choice to target GNOME instead of KDE was made largely because of the questionable legality of the Qt license upon which KDE was based.

In December 2000, Dell invested a &quot;substantial stake&quot; in Eazel and committed to preloading Nautilus on its Linux-based desktop and laptop systems, while Eazel preannounced its core business services which were woven directly into the free Nautilus application. Described as the &quot;network user experience&quot;, those services are the Software Catalog to aid users in locating and installing applications, and Eazel Online Storage for easily storing and browsing files via their desktop or web browser.

The company failed to successfully monetize, or to secure more funding before venture capital ran out, and the technology market changed drastically in the two years of the company&#x27;s lifespan. On March 13, 2001, Eazel simultaneously launched the first release of Nautilus (version 1.0), and laid off most of its 75 employees in an attempt to secure funding in its final few months. The company attempted to sell its core development group but ceased operations on May 15, 2001.

Hertzfeld arranged a meeting with Steve Jobs and most of Apple&#x27;s high level management. In June 2001, most of Eazel&#x27;s final roster of senior engineers joined Apple&#x27;s Safari team, including Bud Tribble, Lisa Melton, Darin Adler, John Sullivan, Ken Kocienda, and Maciej Stachowiak.

===Legacy===
The Nautilus file manager was received positively, and has been incorporated into GNOME since GNOME version 1.4. GNOME has renamed Nautilus to Files and now refers to some of Eazel&#x27;s early concept of &quot;network user experience&quot; as &quot;cloud storage&quot;, which is provisioned by a variety of sources including the complimentary Google Drive. Files is continuously maintained by the free software movement as a centerpiece of some free Linux-based desktop environments.

<text>The Mike&#x27;s Place suicide bombing was a Palestinian suicide bombing, perpetrated by Hamas and Al Aqsa Martyrs Brigades affiliated British nationals, at Mike&#x27;s Place, a bar in Tel Aviv, Israel, on April 30, 2003, killing three civilians and wounding 50.

==First attack==
=== Preparations for the attack ===
The two assailants entered Israel from Jordan, via the Allenby Bridge.

They reached the scene of the attack from a nearby hotel where they had rented a room. Investigators who later searched their room discovered an elastic belt, explosives and a map of downtown Tel Aviv, on which several crowded venues, including Mike&#x27;s Place, were clearly marked.

===Attack===
At 12:45 am on April 30, 2003, the suicide bomber approached Mike&#x27;s Place and blew himself up at the entrance. The force of the blast killed three people and injured over 50. One of the wounded was security guard Avi Tabib, who managed to block the suicide bomber, preventing him from entering the bar and causing further fatalities.

=== Perpetrators ===
After the attack, Hamas and Al Aqsa Martyrs Brigades claimed joint responsibility for the attack. In addition, Hamas spokesman identified the perpetrators as British nationals Asif Muhammad Hanif, 22, from London and Omar Khan Sharif, 27, from Derby.

== Failed second bombing ==

Immediately after the first attack the other suicide bomber, who was carrying a concealed explosive belt, was supposed to carry out another attack but his explosive device failed to detonate. This second suicide bomber, who may have been injured at that point from the explosion, threw away his explosive belt and fled the scene. He reached the David Intercontinental Hotel and struggled with the security guard at the entrance trying to steal his ID, but he did not manage to do so. An examination of the unexploded bomb discarded by Omar Khan Sharif showed that it had been hidden in a book and contained standard explosives.

The body of the second suicide bomber was washed ashore on the Tel Aviv beachfront on May 12 and was eventually identified on May 19, 2003. Forensic experts said he had drowned.

== Subsequent related events ==
Despite the events of that day, the bar reopened on Yom Haatzmaut, Israeli Independence Day.

===ISM visit controversy===
On April 25, five days before the attack, Hanif and Sharif had visited International Solidarity Movement (ISM) office, and after chatting for 15 minutes with an ISM volunteer, the men briefly joined a group of 20 people who were commemorating Rachel Corrie&#x27;s death.

ISM said activists Hanif and Sharif appeared to be &quot;typical Brits.&quot; An ISM volunteer reported that the bombers had been among a group of &#x27;alternative tourists&#x27; who were offered tea when they paid an unscheduled visit to an ISM office on the way to a memorial for Rachel Corrie.

==Cultural references==
A documentary called &quot;Blues by the Beach&quot;, about the Tel Aviv Mike&#x27;s Place, the suicide attack at the bar, and the people affected by it, was directed by American-Israeli filmmaker Joshua Faudem and produced by Jack Baxter, who was seriously injured while making the film.

The Jerusalem branch appears in the film &quot;The Holy Land&quot;, about a wayward Yeshiva student. The director, Eitan Gorlin, worked as one of the bar&#x27;s first bartenders in 1994.

The attack is mentioned in the TV series &quot;The Blacklist&quot; by the main character Raymond Reddington, as he describes the aftermath created by the explosion.

<doc id="780845" wikidata="Q412226" url="?curid=780845" title="Yohimbine">
<text>Yohimbine (), also known as quebrachine, is an indole alkaloid derived from the bark of the African tree &quot;Pausinystalia johimbe&quot;; also from the bark of the unrelated South American tree &quot;Aspidosperma quebracho-blanco&quot;. Yohimbine is an α2-adrenergic receptor antagonist, and has been used in a variety of research projects. It is a veterinary drug used to reverse sedation in dogs and deer.

While yohimbine behaves as an aphrodisiac in some mammals, it does not do so in humans. It has been prescribed as a treatment for erectile dysfunction, although its reported clinical benefits were modest and it has largely been superseded by the PDE5 inhibitor class of drugs. Substances that have purported to be extracts from the yohimbe tree have been marketed as dietary supplements for various purposes, but they contain highly variable amounts of yohimbine, if any; no published scientific evidence supports their efficacy.

==Uses==
Yohimbine is a drug used in veterinary medicine to reverse the effects of xylazine in dogs and deer. It is used as a research reagent. In the US, it is prescribed, but now rarely, for erectile dysfunction in men.

==Yohimbine and yohimbe==
===Confusion===
Yohimbine should not be confused with yohimbe but often is.

Yohimbe is the common English name for the tree species &quot;P. johimbe&quot; (also called &quot;Corynanthe johimbe&quot;)
and, by extension, the name of a medicinal preparation made from the bark of that tree, sold as an aphrodisiac. In contrast, yohimbine is a pure alkaloid that can be isolated from yohimbe bark.

Yohimbine is just one of at least 55 indole alkaloids that have been isolated from the bark; and, while it has been described as the most active of these, it constitutes only 15% of the total alkaloid content. Others include rauwolscine, corynanthine and ajmalicine; the bark also contains non-alkaloids about which virtually nothing is known.

Yohimbe, thus a complex mixture, has been studied far less thoroughly than yohimbine, the pure compound. Pharmaceutical grade yohimbine is usually presented as the hydrochloride, which is more soluble.

===Effect on sexual function===
====History, research and literature====
Yohimbe is used in folk medicine as an aphrodisiac. In 1900, it attracted scientific interest in Germany, where an initial report claimed that yohimbe exerted a strong aphrodisiacal effect in animals and humans. Attention soon shifted from the plant to its active constituents, particularly yohimbine. According to a 2010 encyclopedia article by Joseph M. Betz of the National Institutes of Health:

 In contrast, there is a &quot;fairly rich literature on yohimbine&quot;.

Subsequent work on yohimbine, while confirming that it behaves as an aphrodisiac in animals, including rats, dogs and golden hamsters, has failed to do so in humans. According to Betz:
====Clinical efficacy====
Yohimbine has been used to treat female sexual dysfunction, but there are few reported clinical trials and these do not show it to be better than placebo. On treatment for male erectile dysfunction (ED), a review article by Tam &quot;et al.&quot; (2001) concluded:

Again according to Betz (2010),

A 2011 review by Andersson said:
Yohimbine has been largely superseded by the PDE5 inhibitor drugs such as sildenafil (Viagra). Prescriptions for it are now rare, and most US pharmaceutical manufacturers have discontinued production of prescription capsules and tablets.

===Yohimbine and dietary supplements===

In the US, &quot;yohimbe&quot; preparations are sold as a dietary supplements for enhancing libido, for weight loss and as aids for bodybuilding; but &quot;There is virtually no published research on yohimbe which supports these or any other claims&quot;. Often, these products explicitly claim to contain yohim&quot;bine&quot;.

Cohen et al. found that samples of brands sold in American brick-and-mortar stores contained highly variable amounts of yohimbine, and sometimes none at all. Labelling claims were often misleading. Similar results have been reported by other laboratories for products sold in the U.S., in other countries and on the internet. One study found that many brands of &quot;yohimbe&quot; might not derive from the &quot;P. johimbe&quot; tree in the first place. According to yet another source, the yohimbe sold in markets in West Africa, where the tree grows, is frequently adulterated with other species of the genus &quot;Pausinystalia&quot;; these contain little yohimbine. The amounts of alkaloid found even in genuine &quot;P. johimbe&quot; bark vary considerably, depending on the source of the bark (roots, stem, branches, height, etc.).

Some brands sold over-the-counter were found to contain more yohimbine per serving than a standard pharmaceutical dose; yet, in the US, pharmaceuticals are subject to the strict regulatory regime pertaining to medicines. It is illegal to introduce or deliver &quot;drugs&quot; into interstate commerce without the permission of the FDA. The FDA has asserted that some yohimbine-containing products are &quot;drugs&quot; because they are so promoted as to show &quot;they are intended for use in the cure, mitigation, treatment or prevention of disease&quot;: 21 U.S.C. § 321(g)(1)(B). However the legal position is not entirely straightforward, and as of 1 February 2019 there does not appear to be any record of a successful prosecution.

Because of the lack of reliable scientific data on yohimbe, the European Food Safety Authority Panel on Food Additives determined that it was not possible to conclude on its safety or to establish a health-based guidance value. They wrote:
==Extracts and chemistry==
Yohimbe (&quot;Pausinystalia johimbe&quot;) is a tree that grows in western and central Africa; yohimbine was named as originally extracted from the bark of yohimbe in 1896 by Adolph Spiegel (but see § Aspidosperma quebracho-blanco below). In 1943 the correct constitution of yohimbine was proposed by Witkop. Fifteen years later, a team led by Eugene van Tamelen used a 23-step synthesis to become the first persons to achieve the synthesis of yohimbine.

==Side effects==
Side effects of yohimbine in humans at high doses include hypertension (high blood pressure), tachycardia (rapid heart rate), agitation, hyperalertness, anxiety, and urinary frequency.

== Pharmacology ==
Yohimbine has high affinity for the α2-adrenergic receptor, moderate affinity for the α1 receptor, 5-HT1A, 5-HT1B, 5-HT1D, 5-HT1F, 5-HT2B, and dopamine D2 receptors, and weak affinity for the 5-HT1E, 5-HT2A, 5-HT5A, 5-HT7, and dopamine D3 receptors. It behaves as an antagonist at α1-adrenergic, α2-adrenergic, 5-HT1B, 5-HT1D, 5-HT2A, 5-HT2B, and dopamine D2, and as a partial agonist at 5-HT1A. Yohimbine interacts with serotonin and dopamine receptors in high concentrations.
==Research==
Yohimbine has been studied as a way to improve the effects of exposure therapy in people with post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).

It has also been studied as a potential treatment for erectile dysfunction but there is insufficient evidence to rate its effectiveness. It is illegal in the United States to market an over the counter product containing yohimbine as a treatment for erectile dysfunction without getting FDA approval to do so. Nevertheless, the quantity of yohimbine in dietary supplements, often advertised as promoting sexual function, has been found to overlap with prescription doses of yohimbine.

Yohimbine selectively blocks the pre-synaptic α2 receptors. Blockade of post-synaptic α2 receptors causes only minor corpus cavernosum smooth muscle relaxation, due to the fact that the majority of adrenoceptors in the corpus cavernosum are of the α1 type. Blockade of pre-synaptic α2 receptors facilitates the release of several neurotransmitters in the central and peripheral nervous system — thus in the corpus cavernosum — such as nitric oxide and norepinephrine. Whereas nitric oxide released in the corpus cavernosum is the major vasodilator contributing to the erectile process, norepinephrine is the major vasoconstrictor through stimulation of α1 receptors on the corpus cavernosum smooth muscle. Under physiologic conditions, however, nitric oxide attenuates norepinephrine vasoconstriction.

==Botanical sources of yohimbine; sustainability==
===&quot;Pausinystalia johimbe&quot;===
The traditional source of yohimbine is the bark of the African tree &quot;P. johimbe&quot;. It has other uses, but the tree is sought out primarily for its bark; in practice, harvesting the bark kills the tree. Tree density is relatively low (average ≈ 4 harvestable trees/hectare). The high demand for medicines based on the bark has led to the tree&#x27;s over-exploitation. The bark is traded in local markets and, because it is scarce, it is often adulterated with that of other species which contain little yohimbine. The species is becoming endangered.

Around the year 2000, Cameroon was shipping &quot;P. johimbe&quot; to Europe at the rate of about 100 tonnes annually. Most bark is collected illegally by local people who are paid 150 CFA francs per kilo (about US$0.10 per pound) for delivery of pre-dried bark at the roadside. In practice they confuse and mix it with &quot;P. macroceras&quot; (&quot;false yohimbe&quot;), a species that contains little yohimbine.

===&quot;Aspidosperma quebracho-blanco&quot;===
&quot;Aspidosperma quebracho-blanco&quot; is an unrelated tree whose common name is &quot;quebracho blanco&quot;. It is found in large areas of central South America, particularly the Gran Chaco, where it is often the dominant species in the canopy. It is one of the most widely distributed Argentine arboreal species. Traditionally it was logged for fuel, timber and railway sleepers. While in recent times cattle ranching and soya cultivation have led to considerable habitat loss, and while there is still illegal logging, no shortage of the bark is reported. The tree has not been described as endangered: a few members of the genus &quot;Aspidosperma&quot; are on the IUCN Red List. but the &quot;quebracho blanco&quot; species is not one of them.

In its bark an alkaloid is found which was given the name Quebrachine. In 1914, two scientific papers claimed quebrachine was chemically identical to yohimbine. This was disputed, and the matter long remained in doubt. However, in 1972, Effler and Effler using modern analytical techniques, including mass spectrometry, UV absorption, IR absorption, and NMR, established that quebrachine and yohimbine are one and the same thing. They wrote: 

A range of secondary reference works give &#x27;quebrachine&#x27; as a synonym for yohimbine.

Strictly speaking, wrote George Barger, yohimbine should have been given the scientific name &quot;quebrachine&quot;, seeing that it was first isolated from the quebracho tree and first named in the scientific literature. However the later work on &quot;P. yohimbe&quot; was better known, so the newer name stuck.

===Other plants===
Yohimbine has also been isolated from other plant genera in the family Apocynaceae including Lochnera (Catharanthus), &quot;Rauvolfia&quot;, &quot;Amsonia&quot;, &quot;Vallesia&quot; and &quot;Vinca&quot;; from the family Loganiaceae (genera &quot;Gelsemium&quot; and &quot;Strychnos&quot;); and from the family Euphorbiaceae (genus &quot;Alchornea&quot;).

== Doping ==
There was a case in the World Anti-Doping Agency practice in 2007, when an athlete, who reportedly consumed Yohimbine prior to a given athletic event, was later tested positive for 19-norandrosterone, which is a prohibited substance. However, WADA did not yet list Yohimbine (which can come into a body via an energy drink, also in a form of pre-workout supplement or fat burner) as a prohibited substance, nor did it confirm that its use can increase the endogenous level of anabolic steroids, in particular of 19-norandrostenedione and testosterone.

<text>are random fortunes written on strips of paper at Shinto shrines and Buddhist temples in Japan. Literally &quot;sacred lot&quot;, these are usually received by making a small offering and randomly choosing one from a box, hoping for the resulting fortune to be good. , vending machines sometimes dispense .

The predicts the person&#x27;s chances of their hopes coming true, of finding a good match, or generally matters of health, fortune, life, etc. When the prediction is bad, it is a custom to fold up the strip of paper and attach it to a pine tree or a wall of metal wires alongside other bad fortunes in the temple or shrine grounds. A purported reason for this custom is a pun on the word for and the verb , the idea being that the bad luck will wait by the tree rather than attach itself to the bearer. In the event of the fortune being good, the bearer has two options: they can also tie it to the tree or wires so that the fortune has a greater effect or they can keep it for luck. are available at many shrines and temples, and remain one of the traditional activities related to shrine or temple-going.

A similar custom of writing a prayer on a specially-prepared wooden block called an , which is then tied to an ad hoc scaffold, also exists.

==History==
The sequence historically commonly used in Japanese Buddhist temples, consisting of one hundred prophetic five-character quatrains, is traditionally attributed to the Heian period Tendai monk Ryōgen (912–985), posthumously known as or more popularly, , and is thus called or the , after a legend claiming that these verses were revealed to him by the Bodhisattva Avalokiteśvara (Kannon).

Historically, however, the Japanese system is thought to have been modeled after the Chinese , a similar form of divination involving a tube full of bamboo sticks and a sequence of written or printed oracles. A wooden container containing oracular lots dated 1409 (Ōei 16) is preserved in Tendai-ji in Iwate Prefecture, suggesting that this method of fortune telling was imported to Japan somewhere before the Muromachi period (1336–1573). The quatrains of the are themselves ultimately based on a set of oracles dating from the Southern Song period (1127-1279) known as the (, ; Japanese: ).

The became popular in the Edo period due to the notable monk Tenkai (1536–1643), who is credited with attaching Ryōgen&#x27;s name to it. A story related by one of Tenkai&#x27;s disciples claims that Tenkai was once visited in a dream by Ryōgen, who revealed to him the existence of the 100 quatrains, which had been supposedly lost for centuries. Copies of these short poems were eventually discovered at Togakushi Shrine in Shinano Province (modern Nagano Prefecture) and widely disseminated. The eventually became standard across many Buddhist temples (even those not affiliated with the Tendai school) and served as a model for other sequences. Various books explaining the meaning of the oracles were published during the period, suggesting their widespread popularity.

==Fortunes==

The standard sequence contains the following fortunes (from best to worst):
* 
* 
* 

Other sequences may include additional degrees such as , , or .

It then lists fortunes regarding specific aspects of one&#x27;s life, which may include any number of the following among other possible combinations:

* – auspicious/inauspicious directions (see feng shui)
* – one&#x27;s wish or desire
* – a person being waited for
* – lost article(s)

<doc id="780852" wikidata="Q232002" url="?curid=780852" title="Two Dogmas of Empiricism">
<text>&quot;Two Dogmas of Empiricism&quot; is a paper by analytic philosopher Willard Van Orman Quine published in 1951. According to University of Sydney professor of philosophy Peter Godfrey-Smith, this &quot;paper [is] sometimes regarded as the most important in all of twentieth-century philosophy&quot;. The paper is an attack on two central aspects of the logical positivists&#x27; philosophy: the first being the analytic–synthetic distinction between analytic truths and synthetic truths, explained by Quine as truths grounded only in meanings and independent of facts, and truths grounded in facts; the other being reductionism, the theory that each meaningful statement gets its meaning from some logical construction of terms that refer exclusively to immediate experience.

&quot;Two Dogmas&quot; has six sections. The first four focus on analyticity, the last two on reductionism. There, Quine turns the focus to the logical positivists&#x27; theory of meaning. He also presents his own holistic theory of meaning.

==Analyticity and circularity==

Most of Quine&#x27;s argument against analyticity in the first four sections is focused on showing that different explanations of analyticity are circular. The main purpose is to show that no satisfactory explanation of analyticity has been given.

Quine begins by making a distinction between two different classes of analytic statements. The first one is called logically true and has the form:

:(1) No unmarried man is married.

A sentence with that form is true independent of the interpretation of &quot;man&quot; and &quot;married&quot;, so long as the logical particles &quot;no&quot;, &quot;un-&quot; and &quot;is&quot; have their ordinary English meaning.

The statements in the second class have the form:

:(2) No bachelor is married.

A statement with this form can be turned into a statement with form (1) by exchanging synonyms with synonyms, in this case &quot;bachelor&quot; with &quot;unmarried man&quot;. It is the second class of statements that lack characterization according to Quine. The notion of the second form of analyticity leans on the notion of synonymy, which Quine believes is in as much need of clarification as analyticity. Most of Quine&#x27;s following arguments are focused on showing how explanations of synonymy end up being dependent on the notions of analyticity, necessity, or even synonymy itself.

How do we reduce sentences from the second class to a sentence of the first class? Some might propose &quot;definitions&quot;. &quot;No bachelor is married&quot; can be turned into &quot;No unmarried man is married&quot; because &quot;bachelor&quot; is defined as &quot;unmarried man&quot;. But, Quine asks: how do we find out that &quot;bachelor&quot; is defined as &quot;unmarried man&quot;? Clearly, a dictionary would not solve the problem, as a dictionary is a report of already known synonyms, and thus is dependent on the notion of synonymy, which Quine holds as unexplained.

A second suggestion Quine considers is an explanation of synonymy in terms of interchangeability. Two linguistic forms are (according to this view) synonymous if they are interchangeable in all contexts without changing the truth-value. But consider the following example:

:(3) &quot;Bachelor&quot; has fewer than ten letters.

Obviously &quot;bachelor&quot; and &quot;unmarried man&quot; are not interchangeable in that sentence. To exclude that example and some other obvious counterexamples, such as poetic quality, Quine introduces the notion of cognitive synonymy. But does interchangeability hold as an explanation of cognitive synonymy? Suppose we have a language without like &quot;necessarily&quot;. Such a language would be extensional, in the way that two predicates which are true about the same objects are interchangeable again without altering the truth-value. Thus, there is no assurance that two terms that are interchangeable without the truth-value changing are interchangeable because of meaning, and not because of chance. For example, &quot;creature with a heart&quot; and &quot;creature with kidneys&quot; share extension.

In a language with the modal adverb &quot;necessarily&quot; the problem is solved, as &quot;salva veritate&quot; holds in the following case:

:(4) Necessarily all and only bachelors are unmarried men

while it does not hold for

:(5) Necessarily all and only creatures with a heart are creatures with kidneys.

Presuming that &#x27;creature with a heart&#x27; and &#x27;creature with kidneys&#x27; have the same extension, they will be interchangeable &quot;salva veritate&quot;. But this interchangeability rests upon both empirical features of the language itself and the degree to which extension is empirically found to be identical for the two concepts, and not upon the sought for principle of cognitive synonymy.

It seems that the only way to assert the synonymy is by supposing that the terms &#x27;bachelor&#x27; and &#x27;unmarried man&#x27; are synonymous and that the sentence &quot;All and only all bachelors are unmarried men&quot; is analytic. But for &quot;salva veritate&quot; to hold as a definition of something more than extensional agreement, i.e., cognitive synonymy, we need a notion of necessity and thus of analyticity.

So, from the above example, it can be seen that in order for us to distinguish between analytic and synthetic we must appeal to synonymy; at the same time, we should also understand synonymy with interchangeability &quot;salva veritate&quot;. However, such a condition to understand synonymy is not enough so we not only argue that the terms should be interchangeable, but necessarily so. And to explain this logical necessity we must appeal to analyticity once again. Thus, the argument is circular, and fails.

Ultimately, Quine reaches the conclusion about analyticity the paper is famous for:

:&quot;It is obvious that truth in general depends on both language and extralinguistic fact... Hence the temptation to suppose in general that the truth of a statement is somehow analyzable into a linguistic component and a factual component. Given this supposition, it next seems reasonable that in some statements the factual component should be null; and these are the analytic statements. But, for all its a priori reasonableness, a boundary between analytic and synthetic statements simply has not been drawn. That there is such a distinction to be drawn at all is an unempirical dogma of empiricists, a metaphysical article of faith.&quot;

==Reductionism==

Analyticity would be acceptable if we allowed for the verification theory of meaning: an analytic statement would be one synonymous with a logical truth, which would be an extreme case of meaning where empirical verification is not needed, because it is &quot;confirmed no matter what&quot;. &quot;So, if the verification theory can be accepted as an adequate account of statement synonymy, the notion of analyticity is saved after all.&quot;

The problem that naturally follows is how statements are to be verified. An empiricist would say that it can only be done using empirical evidence. So some form of reductionism - &quot;the belief that each meaningful statement is equivalent to some logical construct upon terms which refer to immediate experience&quot; - must be assumed in order for an empiricist to &#x27;save&#x27; the notion of analyticity. Such reductionism, says Quine, presents just as intractable a problem as did analyticity.

In order to prove that all meaningful statements can be translated into a sense-datum language, a reductionist would surely have to confront &quot;the task of specifying a sense-datum language and showing how to translate the rest of significant discourse, statement by statement, into it.&quot; To illustrate the difficulty of doing so, Quine describes Rudolf Carnap&#x27;s attempt in his book &quot;Der logische Aufbau der Welt&quot;.

Quine first observes that Carnap&#x27;s starting point was not the strictest possible, as his &quot;sense-datum language&quot; included not only sense-events but also &quot;the notations of logic, up through higher set theory... Empiricists there are who would boggle at such prodigality.&quot; Nonetheless, says Quine, Carnap showed great ingenuity in defining sensory concepts &quot;which, but for his constructions, one would not have dreamed were definable on so slender a basis.&quot; However, even such admirable efforts left Carnap, by his own admission, far short of completing the whole project.

Finally, Quine objects in principle to Carnap&#x27;s proposed translation of statements like &quot;quality q is at point-instant x;y;z;t&quot; into his sense-datum language, because he does not define the connective &quot;is at&quot;. Without statements of this kind, it is difficult to see, even in principle, how Carnap&#x27;s project could have been completed.

The difficulty that Carnap encountered shows that reductionism is, at best, unproven and very difficult to prove. Until a reductionist can produce an acceptable proof, Quine maintains that reductionism is another &quot;metaphysical article of faith&quot;.

==Quine&#x27;s holism==
Instead of reductionism, Quine proposes that it is the whole field of science and not single statements that are verified. All scientific statements are interconnected. Logical laws give the relation between different statements, while they also are statements of the system. This makes talk about the empirical content of a single statement misleading. It also becomes impossible to draw a line between synthetic statements, which depend on experience, and analytic statements, that hold come what may. Any statement can be held as necessarily true according to Quine, if the right changes are made somewhere else in the system. In the same way, no statements are immune to revision.

Even logical laws can be revised according to Quine. Quantum logic, introduced by Garrett Birkhoff and John von Neumann, abandons the law of distributivity from classical logic in order to reconcile some of the apparent inconsistencies of classical Boolean logic with the facts related to measurement and observation in quantum mechanics. He states also that a revision of the law of excluded middle has been proposed as a means of simplifying quantum mechanics. Quine makes the case that the empirical study of physics has furnished apparently credible grounds for replacing classical logic by quantum logic, rather as Newtonian physics gave way to Einsteinian physics. The idea that logical laws are not immune to revision in the light of empirical evidence has provoked an intense debate (see &quot;Is Logic Empirical?&quot;).

According to Quine, there are two different results of his reasoning. The first is a blurring of the line between metaphysics and natural science. The common-sense theory about physical objects is epistemologically comparable to the gods of Homer. Quine is a physicalist, in the sense that he considers it a scientific error not to adopt a theory which makes reference to physical objects. However, like Gods of Homer, physical objects are posits, and there is no great epistemic difference in kind; the difference is rather that the theory of physical objects has turned out to be a more efficient theory. After having defined himself an &quot;empiricist&quot;, Quine states in &quot;Two Dogmas&quot;: &quot;The myth of physical objects is epistemologically superior to most in that it has proved more efficacious than other myths as a device for working a manageable structure into the flux of
experience&quot;.

The second result is a move towards pragmatism. Since, Quine says, the function of science is to predict future experiences in the light of past ones, the only ground for choosing which explanations to believe is &quot;the degree to which they expedite our dealings with sense experiences.&quot; While pragmatic concerns are important for Carnap and other logical positivists when choosing a linguistic framework, their pragmatism &quot;leaves off at the imagined boundary between the analytic and the synthetic&quot;. For Quine, every change in the system of science is, when rational, pragmatic.

==Reception==

Rudolf Carnap prepared a reply entitled &quot;Quine on Analyticity&quot;, but this was not published until 1990. Addressing Quine&#x27;s concern over the status of the sentence &quot;Everything green is extended&quot;, Carnap wrote &quot;the difficulty here lies in the unclarity of the word &#x27;green&#x27;, namely in an indecision over whether one should use the word for something unextended, i.e., for a single space-time point. In daily life it is never so used, and one scarcely ever speaks of space-time points.&quot; Carnap then puts forward that an exact artificial language ought to clarify the problem by defining &#x27;green&#x27; (or its synonym) as something that is either necessarily or contingently not applied to space-time points. He wrote that once that decision is made, the difficulty is resolved. Carnap also answers Quine&#x27;s argument on the use of sets of formal sentences to explain analyticity by arguing that this method is an explication of a poorly understood notion.

Paul Grice and P. F. Strawson criticized &quot;Two Dogmas&quot; in their (1956) article &quot;In Defense of a Dogma&quot;. Among other things, they argue that Quine&#x27;s skepticism about synonyms leads to a skepticism about meaning. If statements can have meanings, then it would make sense to ask &quot;What does it mean?&quot;. If it makes sense to ask &quot;What does it mean?&quot;, then synonymy can be defined as follows: Two sentences are synonymous if and only if the true answer of the question &quot;What does it mean?&quot; asked of one of them is the true answer to the same question asked of the other. They also draw the conclusion that discussion about correct or incorrect translations would be impossible given Quine&#x27;s argument. Four years after Grice and Strawson published their paper, Quine&#x27;s book &quot;Word and Object&quot; was released. In the book Quine presented his theory of indeterminacy of translation.

In &quot;Two Dogmas&#x27; revisited&quot;, Hilary Putnam argues that Quine is attacking two different notions. Analytic truth defined as a true statement derivable from a tautology by putting synonyms for synonyms is near Kant&#x27;s account of analytic truth as a truth whose negation is a contradiction. Analytic truth defined as a truth confirmed no matter what however, is closer to one of the traditional accounts of &quot;a priori&quot;. While the first four sections of Quine&#x27;s paper concern analyticity, the last two concern apriority. Putnam considers the argument in the two last sections as independent of the first four, and at the same time as Putnam criticizes Quine, he also emphasizes his historical importance as the first top rank philosopher to both reject the notion of apriority and sketch a methodology without it.

Jerrold Katz countered the arguments of &quot;Two Dogmas&quot; directly by trying to define analyticity non-circularly on the syntactical features of sentences.

In his book &quot;Philosophical Analysis in the Twentieth Century, Volume 1 : The Dawn of Analysis&quot; Scott Soames (pp. 360–361) has pointed out that Quine&#x27;s circularity argument needs two of the logical positivists&#x27; central theses to be effective:

:All necessary truths (and all &quot;a priori&quot; truths) are analytic

:Analyticity is needed to explain and legitimate necessity.

It is only when these two theses are accepted that Quine&#x27;s argument holds. It is not a problem that the notion of necessity is presupposed by the notion of analyticity if necessity can be explained without analyticity. According to Soames, both theses were accepted by most philosophers when Quine published &quot;Two Dogmas&quot;. Today however, Soames holds both statements to be antiquated.

<doc id="780856" wikidata="Q3880944" url="?curid=780856" title="Black-tailed deer">
<text>Black-tailed deer or blacktail deer occupy coastal regions of western North America. There are two subspecies, the Columbian black-tailed deer (&quot;Odocoileus hemionus columbianus&quot;) which ranges from the Pacific Northwest of the United States and coastal British Columbia in Canada to Santa Barbara County in Southern California, and a second subspecies known as the [[Sitka deer]] (&quot;O. h. sitkensis&quot;) which is geographically disjunct occupying from mid-coastal British Columbia up through southeast Alaska, and southcentral Alaska (as far as Kodiak Island). The black-tailed deer subspecies are about half the size of the mainland mule deer (&quot;Odocoileus hemionus hemionus&quot;) subspecies, the latter ranging further east in the western United States.

==Range==
The black-tailed deer lives along the Pacific coast from Santa Barbara County, California north to southeastern Alaska. East of the Cascade Range and Sierra Nevada in Washington, Oregon and California, black-tailed deer are replaced by phenotypically different mainland mule deer, the latter being much larger, with lighter pelage, more prominent rump patches and larger ears. Black-tailed deer adult live weights range from 35–65 kg (77–144 pounds) in California up to 43–74 kg (96–164 pounds) in Alaska. The largest mule deer range up to in the northern Sierra Nevada.

The black-tailed deer is currently common in California, ranging as far south as San Luis Obispo and Santa Barbara County; Home range, habitat use, disturbance, and mortality of Columbian black-tailed deer in Mendocino National Forest. California Fish and Game 77:201–209.&lt;/ref&gt; north into western Oregon, Washington, and coastal and interior British Columbia; and north into the Alaskan panhandle. It is a very popular game animal.

Approximately 40 deer from Oregon were released in Western Kauai, Hawaii between 1961 and 1966. These deer thrived on the island, where they now number around 1,000. They have become a fairly popular game species on the island. 

==Taxonomy== 
All recent authorities consider black-tailed deer a subspecies of mule deer (&quot;O. hemionus&quot;). As above, the black-tailed deer group is considered to consist of two subspecies, as it also includes &quot;O. h. sitkensis&quot; (the Sitka deer). However, in a review of genetics studies, black-tailed deer differed significantly from mule deer by all DNA marker types, including mitochondrial DNA, allozymes, Y chromosome markers, microsatellites, and single nuclear polymorphisms.The mitochondrial DNA divergence between mule deer and black-tailed deer was 6–8%, among the highest divergence ever reported within a mammal species. Integration of multiple genetics studies provided definitive support for two black-tailed deer subspecies: Columbian black-tailed deer (&quot;O. h. columbianus&quot;) and Sitka black-tailed deer (&quot;O. h. sitkensis&quot;), and three mule deer subspecies: mainland mule deer (&quot;O. h. hemionus&quot;) and two additional island mule deer subspecies. There is a large zone of admixture or hybrid swarm of black-tailed deer and mainland mule deer between the east and west slopes of the Cascade Range and Sierra Nevada.

The mtDNA of the white-tailed deer and mule deer are similar, but differ from that of the black-tailed deer. This may be the result of introgression, although hybrids between the mule deer and white-tailed deer are rare in the wild (apparently more common locally in West Texas), and the hybrid survival rate is low even in captivity.

==Ecology==
These two subspecies thrive on the edge of the forest, as the dark forest lacks the underbrush and grasslands the deer prefer as food, and completely open areas lack the hiding spots and cover they prefer for harsh weather. One of the plants that black-tailed deer browse is western poison oak, despite its irritant content. This deer often is most active at dawn and dusk, and is frequently involved in collisions with automobiles.

==Diet and reproduction==

Deer are browsers. During the winter and early spring, they feed on Douglas fir, western red cedar, red huckleberry, salal, deer fern, and lichens growing on trees. Late spring to fall, they consume grasses, blackberries, apples, fireweed, pearly everlasting, forbs, salmonberry, salal, and maple. The mating or &#x27;rutting&#x27; season occurs during November and early December. Bucks can be observed running back and forth across the roads in the pursuit of does. After the rut, the bucks tend to hide and rest, often nursing wounds. They suffer broken antlers, and have lost weight. They drop their antlers between January and March. Antlers on the forest floor provide a source of calcium and other nutrients to other forest inhabitants. Bucks regrow their antlers beginning in April through to August.

The gestation period for does is 6–7 months, with fawns being born in late May and into June. Twins are the rule, although young does often have only single fawns. Triplets can also occur. Fawns weigh and have no scent for the first week or so. This enables the mother to leave the fawn hidden while she goes off to browse and replenish her body after giving birth. She must also eat enough to produce enough milk to feed her fawns. Although does are excellent mothers, fawn mortality rate is 45 to 70%. Does are very protective of their young and humans are viewed as predators.

Deer communicate with the aid of scent and pheromones from several glands located on the lower legs. The metatarsal (outside of lower leg) produces an alarm scent, the tarsal (inside of hock) serves for mutual recognition and the interdigital (between the toes) leave a scent trail when deer travel. Deer have excellent sight and smell. Their large ears can move independently of each other and pick up any unusual sounds that may signal danger.

At dawn, dusk, and moonlit nights, deer are seen browsing on the roadside. Wooded areas with forests on both sides of the road and open, grassy areas, i.e. golf courses, attract deer. Caution when driving is prudent because often as one deer crosses, another one or two follow.

==Controversy over habitat management==

In Southeast Alaska, the Sitka deer is the primary prey of the rare Alexander Archipelago wolf (&quot;Canis lupus ligoni&quot;), which is endemic to the region. In the mid-1990s, the United States Fish and Wildlife Service evaluated a petition to list this wolf subspecies as threatened, and decided a listing was not warranted in August 1997, largely on the basis of provisions the Forest Service had included to protect the viability of the wolf subspecies in its Forest Plan for the Tongass National Forest, adopted three months earlier. The Tongass NF is important in wolf conservation because it includes about 80% of the region&#x27;s land area. The protections for the wolf included a standard and guideline intended to retain, in the face of logging losses, enough habitat carrying capacity for deer in winter to assure the viability of the Alexander Archipelago wolf and an adequate supply of deer for hunters. The needed carrying capacity was originally specified as 13 deer per square mile, but was corrected in 2000 to 18. Use of a deer model is specified for determining carrying capacity, and is the only tool available for the purpose.

However, the Forest Service&#x27;s implementation of the deer provision in the Tongass wolf standard and guideline has been controversial for many years, and led to a lawsuit by Greenpeace and Cascadia Wildlands in 2008, over four logging projects. The data set the Forest Service was using in the deer model was known through the agency&#x27;s own study (done in 2000) to generally overestimate the carrying capacity for deer and underestimate the impacts of logging. The study showed the data set (called Vol-Strata) is not correlated to habitat quality. Also, a conversion factor, known as the &quot;deer multiplier&quot; (used in calculating carrying capacity) was incorrectly applied, causing — by itself – a 30% overestimation of carrying capacity and corresponding underestimation of impacts. The combined effect of the two errors is variable because Vol-Strata is not correlated to habitat quality. Regarding the Traitors Cove Timber Sales project, in 2011 the plaintiffs noted in oral arguments before the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals that the difference is between a claimed 21 deer per square mile carrying capacity in the project EIS, and 9.5 deer per square mile (about half of the Tongass Forest Plan&#x27;s requirement) according to unpublished corrections the agency made in 2008.

The 9th Circuit panel ruled unanimously on August 2, 2011, in favor of the plaintiffs, remanding the four timber sale decisions to the Forest Service and giving guidance for what is necessary during reanalysis of impacts to deer. The ruling says in part:

We do not think that USFS has adequately explained its decision to approve the four logging projects in the Tongass. ... USFS has failed to explain how it ended up with a table that identifies 100 deer per square mile as a maximum carrying capacity, but allows 130 deer per square mile as a potential carrying capacity. &#x27;The agency is obligated to articulate a rational connection between the facts found and the choices made,&#x27; which the agency has not done here. Pac. Coast Fed&#x27;n of Fisherman&#x27;s Ass&#x27;ns v. U.S. Bureau of Reclamation, 426 F.3d 1082, 1091 (9th Cir. 2005)...

We have similar questions about USFS&#x27;s use of VolStrata data, which identifies total timber volume and not forest structure, to approve the projects, where forest structure—and not total timber volume—is relevant to the habitability of a piece of land. USFS itself has recognized the limitations in the VolStrata data. ... Because we must remand to the agency to re-examine its Deer Model, we need not decide whether the use of the VolStrata data was arbitrary and capricious. We anticipate that, in reviewing the proposed projects, USFS will use the best available data ...

In a statement to the press, a spokesman for the plaintiffs said the errors in this lawsuit apply to every significant Tongass timber sale decision between 1996 and 2008, before the Forest Service corrected errors in the deer model when the agency issued its revised Tongass Forest Plan in 2008. But he said despite those corrections, the agency still fails to address cumulative impacts to deer, especially on Prince of Wales Island, as is being challenged in the Logjam timber sale lawsuit, by ignoring substantial logging on nonfederal lands. In September 2013, under the same litigation, the U.S. District Court in Anchorage made a second remand to the Forest Service because the agency&#x27;s further work under the first remand had not resolved the modeling issues. Activity on the four timber sales involved in the litigation has been suspended since 2008.

<text>Abraham Viktor Rydberg (; 18 December 182821 September 1895) was a Swedish writer and a member of the Swedish Academy, 1877–1895. &quot;Primarily a classical idealist&quot;, Viktor Rydberg has been described as &quot;Sweden&#x27;s last Romantic&quot; and by 1859 was &quot;generally regarded in the first rank of Swedish novelists.&quot;

== Biography ==
Viktor Rydberg was of humble parentage. He was the son of a soldier turned prison guard, Johan Rydberg, and a midwife, Hedvig Düker. Viktor Rydberg had two brothers and three sisters. In 1834 his mother died during a cholera epidemic. Her death broke the spirit of his father, who yielded to hypochondria and alcoholism, contributing towards his loss of employment and the family&#x27;s apartment, forcing authorities to board young Viktor out to a series of foster homes, one of which burnt down, further traumatizing the youth. From 1838 to 1847, Rydberg attended grammar school, and studied law at the University of Lund from 1851 to 1852. Due to financial reasons, his university studies ended after one year without a degree. Afterward, he took a job as a private tutor. 

Despite his economic status, Rydberg was recognized for his talents. One biographer notes that: &quot;He had a hard struggle to satisfy the thirst for learning which was a leading passion of his life, but he finally attained distinction in several fields of scholarship.&quot; In 1855, he was offered work at the &quot;Göteborgs Handels- och Sjöfartstidning&quot;, a newspaper in Gothenburg, where he remained employed for more than 20 years. It was during this time that his first novels saw print. He soon became a central figure of late Romanticism in Sweden, and Sweden&#x27;s most famous living author.

Throughout his adult life, Rydberg was active in politics. In 1859, he wrote a pamphlet on national defense, which inspired the &quot;Sharpshooter&#x27;s movement&quot;, a voluntary militia of some political importance during the 1860s. In 1870, he took a controversial pro-German stance during the Franco-Prussian War. Representing the traditional economic system of Sweden, from 1870 to 1872, Rydberg was a member of the Swedish Parliament as a supporter of the Lantmanna Party. Having been a supporter of the Jewish cause since his youth, it was MP Viktor Rydberg who gave the keynote speech in the parliamentary debate to enact a law granting all non-Lutherans full civil rights. He worked diligently for working-class people and in 1906 his works on the labor question in both prose and poetry were regarded as part of the &quot;treasury of this class.&quot; He also advocated language reform, purging foreign words from the Swedish language, particularly those of German origin. Around this time, he advocated a more Germanic spelling of his own name: &quot;Viktor&quot;, as opposed to &quot;Victor&quot;.

Throughout his life and career, Rydberg coined several Swedish words; many, such as &quot;gudasaga&quot; for the foreign &quot;mythologi&quot;, are still in use today. In 1884, he refused to support anarchist writer August Strindberg in his blasphemy case. As a juror in an 1888 trial of socialist leader Hjalmar Branting, Rydberg voted to send him to jail for blasphemy. They never spoke to one another again. His apprehension of unregulated capitalism at the dawn of the industrial age is most fully expressed in his acclaimed poem &quot;Den nya Grottesången&quot; (&quot;The New Grotti Song&quot;) in which he delivered a fierce attack on the miserable working conditions in factories of the era, using the mill of &quot;Grottasöngr&quot; as his literary backdrop.

For his lifetime of literary achievement, Rydberg received an honorary doctorate from the University of Uppsala in 1877 and was elected a member of the Swedish Academy the same year. He served from 1883 as teacher, from 1884 as professor, of the History of Culture at Stockholms högskola, now Stockholm University, and from 1889 as the first holder of the J. A. Berg Chair of the History and Theory of Art there. In 1889, he was also elected a member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences.

Rydberg died at the age of 66 on 21 September 1895 due to complications from diabetes and arteriosclerosis. Rydberg&#x27;s passing was reported as far away as the United States of America, where the &quot;New York Times&quot; published an obituary titled: &quot;Death of Prof. A.V. Rydberg, Career and Remarkable works of one of Sweden&#x27;s Leading Men.&quot; A national day of mourning ensued all over Sweden. Today, his grave is a national monument. Many of his works have been translated and remain in print. His works are widely read in schools throughout Sweden, and his poem &quot;Tomten&quot; (&quot;Santa&quot; or &quot;The Gnome&quot;) is a Christmas favorite, as well as the lyrics for &quot;Gläns över sjö och strand&quot;. A group of three charter high schools (Gymnasium) and one middle school in Stockholm, as well as a street in Göteborg, a student dormitory, and other buildings carry his name. He is still listed in many English language encyclopedias as an individual entry.

Since the late 1920s, scholars and critics have speculated about Rydberg&#x27;s private life and sexual orientation. Referring to a failed engagement, Judith Moffett writes:

We can construct a story of backdoor illicit liaisons and front door respectability from these fragments and others— Rydberg would hardly be the first, if it were true— but he never spoke openly about his private life at any time, and our best guess would still be guesswork.
Svanberg (1928) and Stolpe (1978) suggested that Rydberg had a homosexual orientation, based on their interpretations of Rydberg&#x27;s published works. Moffett (2001) endorsed Stolpe&#x27;s theory, speculating that Rydberg&#x27;s sexual orientation was the result of the early loss of his mother, concluding that Rydberg was homosexual but celibate. In her opinion, Rydberg found all sexual expression &quot;despicable, impossible, or, at best, delicious but lethal.&quot; Sven Delblanc (1983) argued that the novel &quot;Singoalla&quot; &quot;reflected homosexual desires and impulses in Rydberg himself&quot;, and that the protagonist&#x27;s slaying of his unacknowledged son Sorgborn [&#x27;child of sorrow&#x27;] was a &quot;masked representation of homosexual intercourse.&quot; Bäckmann (2004) disputed this theory noting that there is &quot;no textual evidence&quot; to support this &quot;empathetic reading&quot; of Rydberg&#x27;s biography.

== Publications ==

In 1857, Rydberg&#x27;s first novel, &quot;Fribytaren på Östersjön&quot; (&quot;The Freebooter of the Baltic&quot;; 1857), a historical romance set in the 17th century, incorporating themes of piracy, witchcraft and nautical excursions, was published.

This was soon followed by his first major success, and one of his most popular novels, &quot;Singoalla&quot; (1858), a &quot;romantic story out of the Middle Ages, permeated with a poetic nature-mysticism, about the tragic love between a knight and a gypsy girl.&quot; Rydberg rewrote the book throughout his life. The fourth and final edition of 1894, concludes with Erland dying as a hermit monk. The story has been made into a film twice, and today, a popular brand of cookie takes its name from the book&#x27;s main character: Singoalla. A review of the first English translation of the work in the Saga-Book of the Viking Club, Vol. 4, Part 1, 1904–5, noting that the book &quot;has already been translated into most of the languages of continental Europe&quot;, remarks that &quot;Singoalla is a novel occupying a pre-eminent place among Rydberg&#x27;s prose writings.&quot;

In 1859, Rydberg&#x27;s most ambitious novel, and his last one for thirty years, was published under the title &quot;Den siste Atenaren&quot; (&quot;The Last Athenian&quot;). This, his best-known novel, offers a contrast between &quot;Rydberg&#x27;s admiration for classical antiquity and his critical attitude to dogmatic Christianity.&quot; This struggle is set in Athens, in the time of the last pagan emperor, Julian the Apostate, during the transition from Platonic paganism to Christianity. The novel advocates a philosophy founded on the noblest elements of both ideologies. William Widgery Thomas, Jr. said that &quot;at scarcely thirty years of age&quot; Rydberg was &quot;already acknowledged to be the foremost living prose writer of Scandinavia.&quot;

In 1862 he wrote and published &quot;Bibelns lära om Kristus&quot; (&quot;The Bible&#x27;s Doctrine concerning Christ&quot;), a work of contemporary religious criticism, which was hugely successful. Introducing modern Biblical criticism to Scandinavia, he used the New Testament itself to deny the divinity of Christ. &quot;At a conference of the Swedish church in 1865, Mr. Rydberg ...and he pleaded his cause with so much eloquence as to make a favorable impression upon his most eminent official opponents. The agitation which he called forth made his name known throughout Sweden, and in 1870 he was elected a member of parliament, where he boldly advocated democratic principles.&quot;
The long-term effects of the book would be the weakening of the authority of the Church over the educated classes of Scandinavia. August Strindberg &quot;acknowledged the liberating influence of Rydberg&#x27;s Bibelns lära om Kristus (The Bible&#x27;s Doctrine Concerning Christ, 1862) on his generation (like David Friedrich Strauss and Ernst Renan).&quot; He taught freedom of individual conscience. It was this that inspired him in the fight against the state church. Predictably, this book attracted the ire of the orthodox religious establishment and is generally credited for Rydberg&#x27;s exclusion from the Swedish Academy until as late as 1877. From 1865 to 1868, Rydberg suffered a severe bout of depression caused by the theological struggle and a broken engagement in 1865.

Rydberg&#x27;s next work, &quot;Medeltidens Magi&quot; (&quot;The Magic of the Middle Ages&quot;) 1865 is an exposition of the magical practices and beliefs of the Medieval period. According to Rydberg, the contemporary Church was still driven by the ideology of the Dark Ages, and its dualistic notions of good and evil, represented by God and the Devil, Heaven and Hell, contributed towards the horror of the witch-hunts in Europe and America in the recent past. From this point forward, Rydberg was economically successful as a writer.

&quot;Lille Viggs äventyr på julafton&quot; (&quot;Little Vigg&#x27;s Adventures on Christmas Eve&quot;, 1871) is a short Christmas tale for all ages, originally written for a newspaper, but later widely printed. It has since become a Christmas classic in Sweden.

After a long journey in Italy in 1874, Rydberg published &quot;Romerska sägner om apostlarna Petrus och Paulus&quot; (&quot;Roman Legends concerning the Apostles Peter and Paul&quot; 1874) and &quot;Romerska Dagar&quot; (&quot;Roman Days&quot; 1877), a series of essays on Italian culture, history and archaeology; The journey is said to have strengthened Rydberg&#x27;s creative power, as he now produced some of &quot;the finest philosophical lyrics in Swedish literature&quot;. &quot;His poems are not numerous, but their masterly form and wealth of thought give them rank among the best poetry in Swedish literature.&quot; Charles Wharton Stork remarks: &quot;In the originality and forcefulness of his imagery Rydberg marks an important advance in Swedish poetry;&quot; &quot;there is a manliness in Rydberg&#x27;s voice which makes the notes carry. His ideas are not the shadows of others, they are his by strong conviction.&quot;

Other important works include his translation of Goethe&#x27;s &quot;Faust&quot; (1876) and the historical novel &quot;Vapensmeden&quot; (&quot;The Armoror&quot;, 1891), his first novel in three decades. Set during the Reformation, the novel depicts the struggle between Lutheran Protestantism and Roman Catholicism. In it, Rydberg &quot;still fought fanaticism and dogmatism, and his ideal was still humanity and liberty.&quot;

Between 1886 and 1889, his literary work was focused on Norse and broader Germanic mythology. &quot;Rydberg had already begun, in the guise of fiction, to devote himself to cultural history, and this now continued in the form of a series of scientific investigations. These dealt first and foremost with religion and mythology.&quot; He published several works in the field including two articles on the origins of the Poetic Edda poem &quot;Völuspá&quot;, in which he debated the authenticity of the poem with Norwegian scholar Sophus Bugge, who held that the poem was based on Classical and Biblical sources. An article by George Stephens in &quot;The Antiquary&quot; August 1881, describes Rydberg&#x27;s response:

&quot;Against this last theory, the Swedish savant, Dr. Viktor Rydberg, of Gotenburg, has written a brilliant paper in the two first numbers of &quot;Nordisk Tidskrift&quot; for 1881. It is not too much to say, that a more crushing and masterly reply was never penned.

A century later, Old Norse scholar Ursula Dronke characterizes this work similarly:
&quot;... over one hundred pages (as against Bang&#x27;s twenty-three!) of marvellously intelligent, masterly criticism of the errors, imprecise thinking and failure of scholarly imagination that underlay Bang&#x27;s claim.&quot;

Even Sophus Bugge acknowledged that Rydberg won the argument, ushering in the modern age of Eddic scholarship by firmly vanquishing the nature-school of mythology. The result of his own investigations in prose was titled &quot;Segerssvärdet&quot; 1882, (&quot;The Sword of Victory&quot;), followed by two volumes of mythic studies titled &quot;Undersökningar i germanisk mythologi, första delen&quot;, 1886 (&quot;Investigations into Germanic Mythology, Volume 1&quot;); and &quot;Undersökningar i germanisk mythologi, andre delen&quot;, (&quot;Investigations into Germanic Mythology, Volume 2&quot;) 1889 as well as a children&#x27;s version of Norse mythology in 1887 titled &quot;Fädernas gudasaga&quot; (&quot;Our Fathers&#x27; Godsaga&quot;). In a letter to Rydberg, after receiving the first volume of his mythological research, Bugge stated: &quot;As I have read my heart has warmed more and more. ...Forgive these words from a man who before such a magnificent and in many respects remarkable work is well aware that he is nothing but a philologist.&quot;

Henrik Schück wrote at the turn of the 20th century that he considered Rydberg the &quot;last —and poetically most gifted —of the mythological school founded by Jacob Grimm and represented by such men as Adalbert Kuhn&quot; which is &quot;strongly synthetic&quot; in its understanding of myth. Of this work, Jan de Vries said:
&quot;At a time, when one was firmly convinced that the Old Norse myths were a late product, Rydberg&#x27;s voice resounds. At that time, he swam against the stream, but he clearly expressed that which has become an ever stronger certainty today: a large part of the myths of the Germanic tradition —and that is to say basically the Old Norse tradition—must be set back in a time when the undivided Proto-Indo-European people themselves created the vessel of their worldview in myths.&quot;

During the 1880s, Rydberg also published two studies of runic inscriptions. His acceptance speech into the Swedish Academy, titled &quot;Om Hjeltesagan å Rökstenen&quot; (translated as &quot;Concerning the Heroic-Saga on the Rök runestone&quot;) was published in English translation, with an introduction by Swedish Scholar Ola Östin, in its entirety in &quot;The Runestone Journal&quot; 1, 2007, a publication of the Asatru Folk Assembly.

Rydberg&#x27;s final publication, an essay titled &quot;Den hvita rasens framtid&quot;, &quot;The Future of the White Race&quot;, was published posthumously as an introduction to the Swedish edition of Benjamin Kidd&#x27;s &quot;Social Evolution&quot;. Noting that &quot;Rydberg&#x27;s conception of race is not equivalent with the modern term; the meaning he gives the word is in fact more cultural than biological, ...he includes Jews, Muslims, Hindus, Buddhists living in Asia, America and to some extent Africa in this expression.&quot; Swedish scholar Anna Lindén says &quot;what he actually criticizes is a phenomenon within Europe, not on other continents&quot;, continuing, &quot;The Swedish author is, unlike Kidd, not a Social Darwinist and far more pessimistic about the European future than the Irishman. A common feature is, however, that both of them view religion and ethics as most important for the survival of a &quot;race&quot;.

&quot;Evolution is rightly said to be one of the most typical theme in 19th century Europe, but parallel to this optimism in the second half of the century there was a widespread, nearly apocalyptic, anxiety for the degeneration of the population caused by exceptional fast development. Rydberg shared this anxiety: he was very critical to industrialism and unhealthy milieu of the big European metropolises, ...in combination with low nativity this was a dangerous threat to Europe, especially compared to the steadily growing, physically as well as morally sound population in China and the Far East. ...This lack of morals will in the long run ruin the ecological system as well as the poor people on our continent.&quot;

In contrast to Kidd&#x27;s optimistic Darwinism (&quot;all&#x27;ottimismo darwiniano di Kidd&quot;), Rydberg foresaw the possibility of European culture being overcome by the more industrious and more prolific Chinese nation. In this essay,

&quot;Rydberg&#x27;s belief in a swift, negative transformation ... is not initially eugenic or biological; instead he advocates moral rearmament.&quot; &quot;Rydberg envisioned European culture being overthrown by the Chinese. He predicted that the downfall would come in the very near future and would come about because of moral degeneration, demographic conditions, and the ensuing defects in the population.&quot;
===Mythological works===

There is no shortage of scholarly opinion and no consensus on Viktor Rydberg&#x27;s works on Indo-European and Germanic mythology. Some scholars feel that his work is ingenious, while others feel the work is too speculative. One scholar expressed the opinion that &quot;Rydberg&#x27;s views&quot; concerning resemblances of Thor and Indra were carried to extremes, therefore receiving &quot;less recognition than they deserved,&quot; while another says &quot;Rydberg correctly establishes, like many before and after him, the similarities with the myth of Thor and the Midgard serpent&quot; with that of Indra and the dragon Vrtra. Others contest individual points of the work. While some scholars have praised Rydberg&#x27;s method, still others have commented on what they see as fundamental flaws in his methodology, objecting to any systematization of the mythology including the one imposed by Snorri Sturlusson, believing it artificial. However, John Lindow and Margaret Clunies Ross have recently supported a chronological systemization of the most important mythic episodes as inherent in the oral tradition underlying Eddic poetry. Rydberg believed that most of the Germanic myths were part of a chronological epic, an approach that H. R. Ellis Davidson characterized as arising &quot;from an assumption that the mythology was once complete and rational.&quot;

While Rydberg&#x27;s ingenuity has been recognized by some, his work has most often been criticized for being too subjective. Yet, within his work, many find points on which they can agree. In the first comprehensive review of the work in English, Rydberg&#x27;s &quot;brilliancy&quot; and &quot;great success&quot; were recognized, alongside an acknowledgement that he sometimes &quot;stumbles badly&quot; in his effort to &quot;reduce chaos to order.&quot; In 1976, German-language scholar Peter-Hans Naumann published the first evaluation of the full range of Viktor Rydberg&#x27;s mythological writings. In 2004, Swedish doktorand (PhD student) Anna Lindén reviewed the full two-volume work on mythology, concluding in part that it was not more widely received because it was not fully available in one of the three international languages of scholarship: English, German or French.

At the time of its publication, the German school of Nature mythology dominated the field, and contemporary scholars took a dim view of comparative mythology, which would come to flourish in the 20th century. Commenting on Rydberg&#x27;s mythological work in 1902, Dutch Professor, P.D. Chantepie de la Saussaye, remarks:

&quot;The comparative school has, even at the present time, some firm adherents. Among these may be reckoned the Swede, V. Rydberg, who shows great learning in the combination of various aspects of mythical narratives and according to whom even the cosmogonic myths are to be classed among the original possessions of the primitive Indo-European period. Such attempts, however, —of which this single example will suffice—lie outside of the current of modern development.&quot;As Fredrik Gadde has explained, it was in this context, that

 &quot;the book was reviewed by several German scholars, who all took up a more or less disparaging attitude towards Rydberg&#x27;s methods of investigation and his results. Although they speak with high praise of the author&#x27;s learning, his thorough insight, his ability to occasionally throw light upon intricate problems by means of ingenious suggestions, they criticize severely his hazardous etymologies, his identification of different mythical figures without sufficient grounds, his mixing up of heroic saga and myth, and, above all, his bent for remodeling myths in order to make them fit into a system which (they say) never existed.&quot;

&quot;Rydberg&#x27;s work was, then, stamped as a failure, and this verdict from certain points of view cannot be considered unjust, seems to have caused the book to fall into oblivion, a fate which surely it has not deserved.&quot; Among contemporary Swedish reviewers, Hildebrand and Bååth were appreciative, the latter unreservedly praising the work. In 1892, Irish scholar Stopford A. Brooke remarked: &quot;When we have made every allowance for a certain fancifulness, and for the bias which a well-loved theory creates, this book is a real contribution to Northern mythology.&quot; While, in 1942, Fredrik Gadde concluded: &quot;Even though the views set forth by Rydberg never stood a chance of being accepted, there are points in his exposition that deserve being once more brought to light.&quot;

Since their publication, some of Rydberg&#x27;s mythological theories have been cited in a number of other scholarly works including his theory regarding a World Mill, the dead, and his identification of Harbard with Loki in the &quot;Poetic Edda&quot; poem &quot;Hárbarðsljóð&quot;. He has been mentioned as one of several writers who proposed analogs of Ask and Embla in comparative mythology, and who sought Indo-Iranian analogs for the &quot;Poetic Edda&quot; poem, &quot;Völuspá&quot;. Marvin Taylor cites Rydberg&#x27;s definition of the phrase, &quot;dómr um dauðan hvern,&quot; as predating that of a more contemporary writer cited by the author in his review of Julia Zernack&#x27;s Geschichten aus Thule, 1994, published in the Saga-Book of the Viking Society.

<doc id="780871" wikidata="Q1973704" url="?curid=780871" title="Stephen Ames">
<text>Stephen Michael Ames (born April 28, 1964) is a professional golfer formerly of the PGA Tour, who now plays on the PGA Tour Champions. The biggest win of his career was at The Players Championship in 2006. He holds dual citizenship of Trinidad and Tobago and Canada.

==Early life==
Ames was born in San Fernando, Trinidad and Tobago and is of English and Portuguese descent, and much of his family resides in the Caribbean nation. His grandmother was Trinidad and Tobago Champion twice. Ames grew up on the Petrotrin employee compound (Then known as Trintoc) in Pointe-à-Pierre. He learned to play golf at Petrotrin&#x27;s staff club, Pointe-à-Pierre Golf Club.

Ames&#x27; golfing talent developed early in life, assisted by support and discipline from his father, Michael. In his Hoerman Cup debut at the age of 16 in 1980, he set the course record at Sandy Lane, Barbados with a six-under-par total of 66.

==Professional career==
Ames won a golf scholarship at the College of Boca Raton in Florida in the United States and turned professional in 1987, but failed to win a PGA Tour card over the following few years, partly due to a neck injury. He won his first professional tournament in the United States (the Ben Hogan Pensacola Open) in 1991 on what was then the Ben Hogan Tour.

In 1992, Ames tried his luck at European Tour Qualifying School and was successful. He spent five seasons on the European Tour and performed consistently, making the top 80 on the Order of Merit each time, with a best of 13th in 1996. He won the 1994 Open V33 Grand Lyon in France and the 1996 Benson &amp; Hedges International Open in England.

In 1997, Ames finished third at the PGA Tour Qualifying Tournament to earn exempt status for the 1998 season. Due to visa difficulties, Ames was unable to play the PGA Tour in 1999 for nearly six months.

In his first six seasons he didn&#x27;t break into the top 40 of the money list. He highest finish was runner-up to Craig Perks at the 2002 The Players Championship. In 2004 Ames won for the first time on the PGA Tour at the Cialis Western Open among a field that included many of the best professionals in the world, including Tiger Woods, Vijay Singh and Davis Love III. Later that year, he reached the top 20 in the Official World Golf Ranking.

In 2005, Ames initiated an international Ryder Cup style competition entitled the Stephen Ames Cup. The event pits CJGA Team Canada against Team Trinidad &amp; Tobago. He co-hosts, with MP Jim Prentice, an annual charity golf tournament for kids and owns a steakhouse in Calgary called the Vintage Chophouse.

In February 2006, after provoking world No. 1 Tiger Woods with the comment: &quot;Anything can happen, especially where [Tiger&#x27;s] hitting the ball,&quot; Ames was soundly defeated by Woods at the 2006 WGC-Accenture Match Play Championship at La Costa, losing 9 and 8; the largest amount a player can possibly lose by in an eighteen-hole match play event is 10 and 8. However, on March 26, Ames overcame the record defeat by taking The Players Championship at the TPC at Sawgrass. Playing against 48 of the top 50 golfers in the world (including Woods), Ames emerged victorious, with a record-equaling six stroke margin over World No. 3 Retief Goosen, becoming the second-oldest champion in championship history. With the win, Ames surpassed the US$10 million career earnings barrier and climbed 37 places to 27th in the Official World Golf Ranking.

At the 2007 PGA Championship, Ames was in the final pairing with Tiger Woods in the final round but put himself out of contention after shooting a 76, finishing T-12. In November 2007, he picked up his third PGA Tour victory at the Children&#x27;s Miracle Network Classic. He has featured in the top 25 of the Official World Golf Rankings.

Ames won for the fourth time on the PGA Tour in 2009, again at the Children&#x27;s Miracle Network Classic, shooting a final round -8 64. He won in a three-way playoff over George McNeill and Justin Leonard.

Ames was inducted into the Canadian Golf Hall of Fame in August 2014.

On April 16, 2017, Ames secured his first PGA Tour Champions victory, in his 49th start, at the Mitsubishi Electric Classic. He shot a 66 in the final round to finish four strokes ahead of Bernhard Langer. He is the third Canadian to win on the tour and the 11th golfer to win on the three main tours run by the PGA Tour: PGA Tour, PGA Tour Champions, and Web.com Tour.

In June 2021, Ames came from behind and won his second PGA Tour Champions event at the Principal Charity Classic. He won four events on the 2023 PGA Tour Champions season.

==Personal life==
Ames was awarded the Chaconia Medal (Gold), Trinidad &amp; Tobago&#x27;s second highest honour, in 2004. In 2003, his Canadian wife was a former air hostess and he took Canadian citizenship. They have two sons.

In 2006, Ames was awarded the Trinidad and Tobago First Citizens Sports Foundation Sportsman of the Year Award.

Ames moved from Calgary to Vancouver in 2014 after separating from his wife.

<doc id="780873" wikidata="Q465910" url="?curid=780873" title="Phone Booth (film)">
<text>Phone Booth is a 2002 American psychological thriller film directed by Joel Schumacher, produced by David Zucker and Gil Netter, written by Larry Cohen and starring Colin Farrell, Forest Whitaker, Katie Holmes, Radha Mitchell, and Kiefer Sutherland. In the film, a malevolent hidden sniper calls a phone booth, and when a young publicist inside answers the phone, he quickly finds his life is at risk. The film received generally positive reviews from critics and was a box-office hit, grossing $97 million worldwide against a production budget of $13 million.

Produced by Fox 2000 Pictures and Zucker/Netter Productions, the film premiered at the 2002 Toronto International Film Festival, and was set to be theatrically released in November 2002, but the D.C. sniper attacks in October 2002 prompted 20th Century Fox to delay the release of the film, and it was then released theatrically in the United States on April 4, 2003.

==Plot==
Stuart Shepard is an arrogant and dishonest New York City publicist who has been planning an affair with a client, Pamela McFadden, behind the back of his wife Kelly. While in Times Square, Stuart uses a public phone booth to contact Pamela, allowing him to avoid detection by Kelly. During the call, he is interrupted by a pizza delivery man who attempts to deliver a free pizza to him, but Stuart aggressively turns him away. As soon as Stuart completes his call, the phone rings. Stuart answers; a man on the other end, who knows his name, warns him not to leave the booth, threatening to tell Kelly about Pam.

The caller tells Stuart that he has tested two previous individuals who have done wrong deeds in a similar manner, giving each a chance to reveal the truth to those they wronged, but in both cases, they refused and were killed. Stuart must confess his feelings to both Kelly and Pam to avoid the same fate. To demonstrate the threat, the caller fires a suppressed sniper rifle with pinpoint accuracy. The caller then contacts Pam and connects her to Stuart, who admits he is married.

The booth is approached by three prostitutes demanding to use the phone, but Stuart refuses to leave, without revealing his dilemma. Leon, a pimp, breaks the glass side of the booth, grabs Stuart and pummels him while the prostitutes cheer. The caller offers to &quot;make him stop&quot; and in Stuart&#x27;s confusion, he inadvertently asks for this; the caller shoots Leon dead. The prostitutes immediately blame Stuart, accusing him of having a gun, as the police and news crews converge on the location.

NYPD Captain Ed Ramey seals off the area and negotiates to make Stuart leave the booth, but he refuses. Stuart tells the caller that there is no way they can incriminate him, but the caller draws his attention to a handgun planted on the roof of the phone booth. As Kelly and Pam both arrive on the scene, the caller demands that Stuart tell Kelly the truth, which he does. The caller then orders Stuart to choose between Kelly and Pam, and the woman he does not choose will be shot.

Stuart secretly uses his cell phone to call Kelly, allowing her to overhear his conversation with the caller; she quietly informs Ramey of this. Meanwhile, Stuart continues to confess to everyone that his whole life is a lie, to make himself look better than he really is. Stuart&#x27;s confession provides sufficient distraction to allow the police to trace the payphone call to a nearby building. Stuart warns the caller that the police are on the way, and the caller replies that if he is caught, he will kill Kelly. Desperate, Stuart grabs the handgun and leaves the booth, begging for the sniper to kill him instead. The police fire upon Stuart, while a SWAT team breaks into the room that the caller was tracked to, only to find a rifle and a man&#x27;s corpse.

Stuart regains consciousness; the police had fired only rubber bullets, stunning but not harming him. Stuart and Kelly happily reconcile. As the police bring down the body, Stuart identifies it as the pizza delivery man from earlier. Stuart gets medical treatment at a local ambulance. After getting a shot from a paramedic, he starts losing consciousness. The real caller passes by, warning Stuart that if his newfound honesty does not last, he will return, before disappearing into the crowd, while the pay phone rings again.

==Production==
===Development===
In the 1960s, Larry Cohen pitched Alfred Hitchcock an idea for a film which took place in real-time, entirely within the confines of a telephone booth. Hitchcock liked the idea, but the project did not move forward, because the two men were unable to devise a plot which explained why the action had to be restricted to one location. Cohen recalled that Hitchcock would ask him if he had a solution to the problem when they periodically met over the following years, but it was not until the late 1990s, some two decades after Hitchcock&#x27;s death, when he came up with the answer of a sniper forcing the protagonist to remain within the phone booth, and was able to write a script.

Creative Artists Agency signed a contract with Cohen and the script appealed to several A-list actors, such as Tom Cruise, Will Smith, Mel Gibson, Robin Williams, Anthony Hopkins, and Nicolas Cage; directors placed in contention included Gibson, Steven Spielberg, the Hughes brothers, and Michael Bay. According to Cohen, Bay was removed from consideration after the first question he asked about the script was, &quot;OK, how do we get this thing out of the damn telephone booth?&quot; Eventually, Joel Schumacher, who had been considered early in development, was brought back on to direct the film. Jim Carrey was originally cast as Stu Shepard, but he dropped out. Schumacher said: &quot;We were going to shoot it that summer and he was fitted for the suit. But I got a call from Jim one night and told me he had cold feet. He really didn&#x27;t feel comfortable with it. Actors never give up their role. If an actor gives up a part then it&#x27;s not right for them.&quot;

===Filming===

The principal photography on the film was completed in ten days, with an additional two days of establishing shots, pickups, and re-shoots. This accelerated filming schedule was aided by the adoption of French hours, a work schedule that skips the typical one-hour production shutdown for the lunch break, in exchange for making food available all throughout the shooting day.

The filming was done with Ron Eldard cast in the role of The Caller. During filming, Eldard delivered his performance from the window of a building across the street from the phone booth Farrell was in. The role was recast with Kiefer Sutherland after screenwriter Cohen told director Schumacher that Eldard&#x27;s &quot;voice lacked the mesmerizing tone&quot; that Cohen wanted. Sutherland rerecorded all of The Caller&#x27;s lines for use in the final film.

This was costume designer Daniel Orlandi&#x27;s second feature with Joel Schumacher, having previously worked together on &quot;Flawless&quot;. According to him, Dolce &amp; Gabbana created the suit and shirt worn by Colin Farrell. Though the fashion house was tasked with making additional suit copies for filming, they unfortunately would not arrive until the last day of shooting. Thankfully, the film was shot chronologically and thus the costume could sustain damage without slowing down production. Orlandi was able to keep one of the suit copies for himself as he and Farrell were the same size.

The film is set in real time, so the timespan in which the film takes place is as long as it takes to watch it, much like the television series &quot;24&quot;, which also stars Kiefer Sutherland. Like &quot;24&quot;, it also uses split screens. Although the film is set in New York City, it was filmed in front of what is now the CB1 Gallery in downtown Los Angeles, in November 2000. This is made evident by the LACMTA buses periodically driving by. The exact location of the phone booth in the film is the corner of West 5th Street and Frank Court, given away by the black gate in the background.

==Release==
===Theatrical===
The film premiered on September 10, 2002, at the Toronto International Film Festival. It was originally due to be released in the United States on November 15 of that year. However, in October 2002, the Beltway sniper attacks occurred in the Washington, D.C., area, prompting 20th Century Fox to delay the release of the film to April 4, 2003.

===Home media===
It was released on VHS and DVD on July 8, 2003.

==Reception==
===Box office===
The film grossed $46.5 million in the United States of America and $51.3 million internationally for a total gross of $97.8 million, from a $13 million production budget.

===Critical response===
On Rotten Tomatoes, &quot;Phone Booth&quot; has an approval rating of 72% based on 187 reviews, with an average rating of 6.5/10. The website&#x27;s critical consensus reads: &quot;Quick pacing and Farrell&#x27;s performance help make &quot;Phone Booth&quot; a tense nail-biter.&quot; At Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 56 out of 100 based on 35 critics, indicating &quot;mixed or average reviews&quot;. Audiences surveyed by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of &quot;C+&quot; on scale of A+ to F.

Roger Ebert of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; gave the film three out of four stars, and said of Sutherland&#x27;s performance, &quot;if the voice doesn&#x27;t work, neither does the movie. It does.&quot; Todd McCarthy of &quot;Variety&quot; magazine criticized the film for not having enough material even for its relatively short length, and wrote: &quot;Gussied up with a host of filmmaking tricks in an attempt to keep things lively, this intensely acted little exercise just doesn&#x27;t have enough going for it, with the exception of gradually growing interest in lead Colin Farrell.&quot;

<doc id="780875" wikidata="Q5755431" url="?curid=780875" title="High Fidelity (magazine)">
<text>High Fidelity — often abbreviated HiFi — was an American magazine that was published from April 1951 until July 1989 and was a source of information about high fidelity audio equipment, video equipment, audio recordings, and other aspects of the musical world, such as music history, biographies, and anecdotal stories by or about noted performers.

Great Barrington, Massachusetts-based High Fidelity magazine was original founded as a quarterly publication in 1951 by audiophile Milton B. Sleeper. One of the first editors was Charles Fowler. Later, the publication became a monthly and Fowler became the publisher.

In 1957, High Fidelity and its sister publication Audiocraft were acquired by Billboard Publications, Inc., when it purchased High Fidelity&#x27;s parent company, Audiocom, Inc. from Audiocom&#x27;s president and publisher Charles Fowler.

After 16 years of ownership, Billboard sold &quot;High Fidelity&quot; in 1974, along with its sister publication &quot;Modern Photography&quot;, to the magazine division of the American Broadcasting Companies for $9 million. At the time of the sale, &quot;High Fidelity&quot; and &quot;Modern Photography&quot; had circulations of 260,000 and 470,000 respectively.

Until 1981, its editorial offices were located in Great Barrington, Massachusetts. In January of that year, its parent company, ABC Consumer Magazines, began moving the publication&#x27;s operations to New York City, a process that was completed in about a year. In 1989, ABC sold &quot;High Fidelity&quot; and its sister publication &quot;Modern Photography&quot; to Diamandis Communications (now Hachette Filipacchi Media), which merged its subscriber list with that of &quot;Stereo Review&quot; magazine. (&quot;Stereo Review&quot; transformed into the present &quot;Sound and Vision&quot; magazine in 2000.) &quot;High Fidelity&quot; and &quot;Modern Photography&quot; had circulations of 327,000 and 689,000 respectively by the time these magazines were shut down by Diamandis.

== Musical America ==

During the period in which it was a subsidiary of Billboard Publications, &quot;High Fidelity&quot; purchased &quot;Musical America&quot; in 1964 and incorporated the newly acquired publication as an additional insert to selected editions of &quot;High Fidelity&quot; that were mailed to subscribers who had paid an additional fee. During this time, the Musical America was not available in the copies of &quot;High Fidelity&quot; that were sold at newsstands, but only in certain copies available only by subscription. This business arrangement continued after &quot;High Fidelity&quot; was sold to ABC Consumer Magazines in 1974.

ABC continued this publishing arrangement until 1986 when ABC decided it needed to revive &quot;Musical America&quot; as a separate monthly publication (which later became bimonthly) to fight back against the loss of readership caused by the foundation of a new competing classic music publication by James R. Oestreich called Opus. Oestreich was a former &quot;High Fidelity&quot; classic music editor who was fired in 1983 for protesting the cutbacks in classic music coverage in the joint &quot;High Fidelity/Musical America&quot; publication. In protest to Oestreich dismissal, several noted classic music editors resigned in mass to eventually join Oestreich at his new publication.

The reintroduction of the first separate issue of &quot;Musical America&quot; in 1987 was mishandled by ABC since ABC did not provide copies for distribution at newsstands in many major cities. Although &quot;Musical America&#x27;s&quot; tenure at ABC was not very impressive, it avoided &quot;High Fidelity&#x27;s&quot; fate of being sold to Diamandis and remained with ABC until 1991 when it was sold to media investor Gerry M. Ritterman.

<text>Alum Rock Park, in the Alum Rock district of San Jose, California, is California&#x27;s oldest municipal park, established in 1872 but serving as public land since the pueblo was established in 1777. Located in a valley in the Diablo Range foothills on the east side of San Jose, the 720 acre (2.9 km2) park offers 13 miles (21 km) of trails, varying from fairly level along Penitencia Creek to sharp switchbacks climbing to the ridges to the South Rim Trail and the North Rim Trail. The narrow floor of the valley includes a visitor center, a small museum/animal rehab facility, picnic areas, playgrounds, lawns, sand volleyball pits, mineral springs, lush plant life, woodlands, creek play opportunities, and occasional group camping.

The ridge trails offer views of Santa Clara Valley and of the valley in which the park is located. Some trails in the park are a part of the Bay Area Ridge Trail; the Todd Quick trail connects with the Santa Clara Valley Open Space Authority&#x27;s 1,600-acre Sierra Vista Open Space Preserve.

Equestrians and mountain bikers have access to some of the park&#x27;s trails, while others are reserved for hikers only. Cross-country and distance track teams from high schools around North San Jose, mainly Piedmont Hills High School, and occasionally James Lick High School and Independence High, use the park for training and for meets.

==History==

===Naming===
Alum Rock Park was originally known simply as &quot;the reservation&quot;; it received its current name around the turn of the 20th century when thenardite-containing rocks near its entrance were mistaken for alum. Another black rock with an estimated weight of two thousand tons near the mouth of Penitencia Creek canyon was supposed to be one of the largest meteorites in the world.

Penitencia Creek is properly called Upper Penitencia Creek because it no longer connects with Lower Penitencia Creek, which is in Milpitas. The creek also had a different name until the early 20th century; somehow it began to be called by the name of a different creek located to the north, which was so-named because monks (possibly from Mission San José) would meditate by its waters.

===San Jose &amp; Alum Rock Park Railway===

Construction of a narrow-gauge railway to the park from downtown San Jose began in 1891. In late 1891, or early 1892, a gasoline powered locomotive built by the Best Manufacturing Company arrived. This was the first internal combustion locomotive built in the western United States, though it was only a limited success and was returned to Best in 1892.

By 1896, of track had been completed from 26th Street up Santa Clara and Alum Rock Avenues to Kirk Avenue and thence upstream along Penitencia Creek into the park. Passengers paid 25 cents to ride to the park on street cars pulled by steam dummy locomotives. The line converted to electric power in 1901, but a storm during the winter of 1911 washed out the narrow-gauge line up Penitencia Creek. The narrow-gauge route was replaced on 2 September 1913 by the standard gauge interurban Peninsular Railway running up Berryessa Road from a connection with the downtown streetcars on 17th Street. Passengers could reach the park from any point on the San Jose streetcar system until service into the park was abandoned on 11 July 1932.

===Renovation===

From 1921 until unknown, the Santa Clara County Council of the Boy Scouts of America was given exclusive access to 15 acres (61,000 m2) in the park. By the 1960s, the park attracted so many visitors from the rapidly growing Santa Clara Valley that its facilities became overburdened and the natural scenery was damaged. In the 1970s, the park removed most of the buildings, closed off parts of the park, and began emphasizing the park&#x27;s natural attractions rather than its human-made ones. Much of the stonework remains, however, as do old support structures for the railroad.

===Natural disasters===
El Niño winter storms of February 1998 caused dozens of landslides which precipitated the complete closing of the park for nearly six months. The aftermath of several of these slides resulted in the closure of the Alum Rock Avenue vehicle entrance in the autumn of 2000; vehicle access is currently available from Penitencia Creek Road, which was re-opened to vehicle traffic at this time.

On October 30, 2007, the 2007 Alum Rock earthquake, a 5.6 earthquake, hit the Bay Area at 8:04 pm Pacific time. It was centered NNE of Alum Rock and at a depth of . The Hayward Fault and Calaveras Fault converge close to Alum Rock Park. One effect of the earthquake was to cause a previously dried spring to begin flowing again.

On February 20, 2017, heavy rain storms caused fallen trees, landslides and flooding resulting in the park to close.

==Features==

===Springs===
The valley has abundant mineral springs, which were touted as beneficial to people&#x27;s health. In the late 19th century and through the 1930s, the park was famed throughout the country as a health resort advertising hot and cold sulfur, soda and magnesia springs, as well as mixtures of sulfur, soda, magnesia, arsenic, iron, and their sulfates. Plumbing routed some of these springs into bathtubs or drinking fountains. A very early 20th century advertising brochure listing the names of eleven physicians suggested: &quot;...a remarkable spring furnishing a mixture of sulphur, magnesia, and arsenic, which has been found very beneficial in cases of rheumatism, Bright&#x27;s disease, and other kidney and stomach troubles and malarial affections.&quot; Through those years and as late as the 1970s, the park featured a natatorium (a huge, indoor swimming pool filled with heated sulfur water), dozens of private heated mineral baths that visitors could rent, a restaurant, and various other buildings. Many of the springs were enclosed in stonework grottos, and stone bridges were built across the creek. Due to overuse, some of the springs became extinct, and surviving ones became very weak, producing very little output.

===Alum Rock Falls Road===
Private residents have access to the publicly-owned road. They enter the park and continue on to the rear parking lot. At the end of the parking lot is a metal gate which requires a security code number to continue on the public road. Visitors can also walk up the road, but there are various signs which indicate no trespassing.

===Fork in the creek===

Penitencia Creek has two main sources which converge at the &quot;horse bridge&quot; near the uphill end of the creek trail. The fork from the north is Penitencia and originates from Cherry Flat Reservoir. Alum Rock Falls is within the park but the City of San Jose has marked this part of the park as off limits since the 1980s. The creek from the south is Arroyo Aguague and originates in Grant Ranch. Although a couple miles of this lush canyon are within the park, this area too is off limits to visitors.

===Youth Science Institute===
Opened in 1953, the Youth Science Institute - Alum Rock Science and Nature Center, operated by the Youth Science Institute, features natural history exhibits and a collection of live teaching animals, including several injured and non-releasable hawks and owls that are found in the region. The center offers nature and science school and group programs, after-school science and summer camp programs.

Animals that are commonly found throughout the park are displayed in the center. There is an exhibit of taxidermy birds that is sectioned off into owls, hawks, seabirds, and waterfowl. Animal remains are set up throughout the center and labeled accordingly. There is a separate room for live animals that are kept in their designated space along with a brief description of each animal. Occasionally, there is a pair of owls that roam free within the room. 

==Environment==
===Vegetation===

The steep sides of the valley are home to many diverse plants native to California. The south-facing slopes primarily consist of grasses, poison oak, sagebrush, and occasional live oak trees. The warm sun on the sagebrush lends a unique smell to the air.

The north-facing slopes are dominated by trees, including coast live oak, California bay laurel, madrone, and California buckeye. On the valley floor, in the moist areas along Penitencia Creek, bigleaf maple, white alder, and western sycamore provide shade for the abundant ferns.

The most common native species of the park include California fuchsia, California wild rose, black sage, hummingbird sage, and blackberry. Problematic invasive species are star thistle, cape ivy, and periwinkle vinca. 

===Animals===
Bird species found in the park include red-tailed hawk, red-shouldered hawk, Cooper&#x27;s hawk, American kestrel, turkey vulture, wild turkey, mallard, great blue heron, green heron, Steller&#x27;s jay, great egret, snowy egret, and California quail. Owls that are native to the park are the western screech owl, barn owl, great horned owl, and northern pygmy owl. The northern pygmy owl unlike most owl species is active from dawn to dusk. Larger wildlife includes black-tailed deer, gray foxes, bobcats, and the occasional mountain lions. There has been an increase in the mountain lion population in the San Francisco Bay Area. Smaller wildlife would include the darkling beetle, &quot;Eurypelma californicum&quot; (tarantula), black widow, and Pacific tree frog. Two species of lizards that are native to the park are southern alligator lizard and western fence lizard. Native fish that can be found in Penetencia Creek are the California roach and riffle sculpin.

Rattlesnakes (specifically, the northern Pacific rattlesnake: &quot;Crotalus oreganus&quot;) are known to be active during the summer months. They can occasionally be seen shading themselves in the foliage along the trails. Other snakes that are native to the park include the California kingsnake, California mountain kingsnake, Rosy boa, Pacific gopher snake, and Western yellow-bellied racer, all are harmless, nonvenomous and can also be found along the trails.

Yellow-Eyed Ensatina (&quot;Ensatina eschscholztii xanthoptica&quot;), California Slender Salamanders (&quot;Batrachoseps attenuatus&quot;), and Arboreal Salamanders (&quot;Aneides lugubris&quot;) can be found in the wooded areas of the park.

<text>Sayyid Muhammad Jaunpuri (; 9 September 1443 – 23 April 1505) was an Indian religious leader and the founder of the Mahdavia movement. He claimed to have been divinely appointed as the promised &quot;Mahdī&quot;, in fulfillment of the Islamic prophecies regarding the end times. Hailing from Jaunpur, he traveled extensively throughout India, Arabia and Khorasan.

==Early life==
His first wife, Bibi Alahdadi (Rz), was the daughter of his uncle, Syed Jalaluddin (Rz). He married her in Jaunpur in 866H, when he was nineteen years old. Syed Muhammad (AS) and Alhadadi (Rz) had two sons and two daughters together, Syed Mahmood Sani-e-Mahdi (Rz), Syed Ajmal (Rz), Syeda Khunza (Rz) and Syeda Fatima (Rz).

==Travels==
He left Jaunpur along with his family and a group of followers. Migrating from place to place and gathering companions, that would later become the core of the Mahdavia sect founded by him, until he reached Farah in Afghanistan.

==Pilgrimage and claim to be the Mahdi==
By the age of 53 he embarked on the Hajj pilgrimage to Mecca, where in 1496 (901 Hijri), after circumambulating the Kaaba, he declared that he was the Promised Mahdi and whoever believes in him is a Momin.

After staying in Mecca for nearly seven or nine months, he returned to India where he proclaimed himself Mahdi at Ahmedabad and later at Badhli (near Patan, Gujarat).

<doc id="780886" wikidata="Q2937829" url="?curid=780886" title="Characterization (mathematics)">
<text>In mathematics, a characterization of an object is a set of conditions that, while possibly different from the definition of the object, is logically equivalent to it. To say that &quot;Property &quot;P&quot; characterizes object &quot;X&quot; is to say that not only does &quot;X&quot; have property &quot;P&quot;, but that &quot;X&quot; is the &quot;only&quot; thing that has property &quot;P&quot; (i.e., &quot;P&quot; is a defining property of &quot;X&quot;). Similarly, a set of properties &quot;P&quot; is said to characterize &quot;X&quot;, when these properties distinguish &quot;X&quot; from all other objects. Even though a characterization identifies an object in a unique way, several characterizations can exist for a single object. Common mathematical expressions for a characterization of &quot;X&quot; in terms of &quot;P&quot; include &quot;P&quot; is necessary and sufficient for &quot;X&quot;, and &quot;X&quot; holds if and only if &quot;P&quot;&quot;.

It is also common to find statements such as &quot;Property &quot;Q&quot; characterizes &quot;Y&quot; up to isomorphism&quot;. The first type of statement says in different words that the extension of &quot;P&quot; is a singleton set, while the second says that the extension of &quot;Q&quot; is a single equivalence class (for isomorphism, in the given example — depending on how &quot;up to&quot; is being used, some other equivalence relation might be involved).

A reference on mathematical terminology notes that &quot;characteristic&quot; originates from the Greek term &quot;kharax&quot;, &quot;a pointed stake&quot;:From Greek &quot;kharax&quot; came &quot;kharakhter&quot;, an instrument used to mark or engrave an object. Once an object was marked, it became distinctive, so the character of something came to mean its distinctive nature. The Late Greek suffix &quot;-istikos&quot; converted the noun &quot;character&quot; into the adjective &quot;characteristic&quot;, which, in addition to maintaining its adjectival meaning, later became a noun as well.Just as in chemistry, the characteristic property of a material will serve to identify a sample, or in the study of materials, structures and properties will determine characterization, in mathematics there is a continual effort to express properties that will distinguish a desired feature in a theory or system. Characterization is not unique to mathematics, but since the science is abstract, much of the activity can be described as &quot;characterization&quot;. For instance, in &quot;Mathematical Reviews&quot;, as of 2018, more than 24,000 articles contain the word in the article title, and 93,600 somewhere in the review.

In an arbitrary context of objects and features, characterizations have been expressed via the heterogeneous relation &quot;aRb&quot;, meaning that object &quot;a&quot; has feature &quot;b&quot;. For example, &quot;b&quot; may mean abstract or concrete. The objects can be considered the extensions of the world, while the features are expressions of the intensions. A continuing program of characterization of various objects leads to their categorization.

== Characterizations in higher mathematics ==
Characterizations are particularly important in higher mathematics, where they take up a large volume of theory in typical undergraduate courses. They are commonly known as &quot;necessary and sufficient conditions,&quot; or &quot;if-and-only-if statements.&quot; Characterizations help put difficult objects into a form where they are easier to study, and many types of objects in mathematics have multiple characterizations. Sometimes, one characterization in particular particular is more readily generalizable to abstract settings than the others, and it is often chosen as a &quot;definition&quot; for the generalized concept.

In real analysis, for example, the completeness property of the real numbers has several useful characterisations:

* The least-upper-bound property
* The greatest-lower-bound property
* The nested interval property
* The Bolzano-Weierstrass theorem
* The convergence of Cauchy sequences

A typical real analysis university course would begin with the first of these, the least-upper-bound property, as an axiomatic definition of the reals (sometimes called the &quot;axiom of completeness&quot; in texts), and gradually prove its way to the last, the convergence of Cauchy sequences. The proofs are quite nontrivial. Among these five characterizations, the Cauchy-sequence perspective turns out to be the easiest to generalize, and is chosen as the &quot;definition&quot; for the completeness of an abstract metric space. However, the least-upper-bound property is often the most useful to prove facts about real numbers themselves, such as the intermediate value theorem. Thus the most useful and most generalizable characterizations are at times different.

Another example of this phenomenon is found in physics. Hamiltonian mechanics is a characterization of classical mechanics, being equivalent to Newton’s laws. However, it is much easier to generalize to quantum mechanics and statistical mechanics, which is its primary virtue. However, it is a different characterization, Lagrangian mechanics, that is often preferred for the study of classical mechanics itself.

Since a characterization result is equivalent to the initial definition or axiom(s) of the object, it can be used as an equivalent definition, from which the original definition can be proved as a theorem. This leads to the question of which definition is “best” in a given situation, out of many possible options. There is no absolute answer, but the ones that are chosen by authors of books or papers is often a matter of aesthetic or pedagogical considerations, as well as convention, history, and tradition. For real numbers, the least-upper-bound property may have been chosen on the grounds of being easier to learn than Cauchy sequences.

One of the most important results in complex analysis is a characterization result, namely the fact that all locally complex-differentiable functions are analytic (equal to their Taylor series).

Characterisations are very common in abstract algebra, where they often take the form of “structure theorems,” expressing the structure of an object in a simple form. These results are often very difficult to prove. In the theory of matrices, the Jordan Canonical Form is a characterization, or structure theorem, for complex matrices, and the spectral theorem is likewise for symmetric matrices (if real) or Hermitian matrices (if complex). According to the spectral theorem, the real symmetric matrices are precisely the ones that have a basis of perpendicular eigenvectors (called principal axes in physics). In the theory of groups, there is a structure theorem for finite abelian groups, that states that every such group is a direct product of cyclic groups.

As if-and-only-if statements, characterizations are, in a sense, the “strongest” type of mathematical theorem, which is in line with the difficulty of their proofs. Consider a generic mathematical theorem, that A implies B. If B does not imply A, the theorem may be said to be “underpowered”, as the proved statement B is “weaker” than the ingredient A, being not strong enough to prove A on its own. In a characterization, however, B must imply A also – the proved statement is as strong as the ingredient, and it can be no stronger. In a sense, such a result “uses” all of the structure in A in proving B.

==Examples==
* A rational number, generally defined as a ratio of two integers, can be characterized as a number with finite or repeating decimal expansion.
*A parallelogram is a quadrilateral whose opposing sides are parallel. One of its characterizations is that its diagonals bisect each other. This means that the diagonals in all parallelograms bisect each other, and conversely, that any quadrilateral whose diagonals bisect each other must be a parallelogram.
* &quot;Among probability distributions on the interval from 0 to ∞ on the real line, memorylessness characterizes the exponential distributions.&quot; This statement means that the exponential distributions are the only probability distributions that are memoryless, provided that the distribution is continuous as defined above (see Characterization of probability distributions for more).
* &quot;According to Bohr–Mollerup theorem, among all functions &quot;f&quot; such that &quot;f&quot;(1) = 1 and &quot;x f&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) = &quot;f&quot;(&quot;x&quot; + 1) for &quot;x&quot; &gt; 0, log-convexity characterizes the gamma function.&quot; This means that among all such functions, the gamma function is the &quot;only&quot; one that is log-convex.
* The circle is characterized as a manifold by being one-dimensional, compact and connected; here the characterization, as a smooth manifold, is up to diffeomorphism.

<doc id="780888" wikidata="Q921033" url="?curid=780888" title="Fourteen Hours">
<text>Fourteen Hours is a 1951 American drama directed by Henry Hathaway that tells the story of a New York City police officer trying to stop a despondent man from jumping to his death from the 15th floor of a hotel.

The film stars Richard Basehart, Paul Douglas, Barbara Bel Geddes, and Debra Paget. It also marked the screen debut of Grace Kelly and Jeffrey Hunter, who appear in small roles.

The screenplay was written by John Paxton based on an article by Joel Sayre in &quot;The New Yorker&quot; describing the 1938 suicide of John William Warde.

==Plot==
Early in the morning on St. Patrick&#x27;s Day, a room service waiter at a New York City hotel is horrified to discover that the young man to whom he has just delivered breakfast is standing on the narrow ledge outside his room on the 15th floor. Charlie Dunnigan, a traffic cop on the street below, tries to convince the man to come in, to no avail. Dunnigan&#x27;s officious chief dismisses him with contempt. The man on the ledge refuses to speak to psychiatrists: He wants Dunnigan, who is summoned from the street. A psychiatrist advises Dunnigan to relate to the man on a human basis. Meanwhile, a curious crowd gathers in the street below and on surrounding buildings; It continues to grow throughout the day, and into the night.

The police identify the man as Robert Cosick and locate his mother. Her overwrought, hysterical behavior upsets Cosick and seems to drive him closer to jumping. His father, whom his mother has taught him to despise, arrives but, while explaining why he has been absent, he criticizes Robert&#x27;s mother, and Robert threatens to kill him.

Mrs. Cosick mentioned the name Virginia to her son. Dunnigan forces her to reveal that Virginia is Cosick&#x27;s estranged fiancée. She lives in Connecticut. The police send for her. Mrs. Cosick relieves her feelings by telling her life&#x27;s story to reporters. The psychiatrist tells the chief she is “a case, just like her boy.” A reporter observes: “The lady doth protest too much.”

Among the watchers, cabbies take bets on when Cosick will jump, a young couple meet and a woman who is seeking a divorce changes her mind.

Against the psychiatrist&#x27;s advice, the police lower a man down to lasso Robert. People in the crowd warn him. He is furious. Dunnigan loses his temper, tells him the cop was risking his life, tells him of all the other people trying to help him—and tells him to jump. Robert apologizes. Dunnigan asks if Robert will see his father, who is “a good Joe.”

Dunnigan convinces Cosick that everyone will leave the hotel room so that he can rest and eat. He gives him the key.  As Cosick begins to enter the room, a mentally ill street evangelist comes into the room, frightening Cosick back to the ledge and wrecking his trust in Dunnigan, Dunnigan calls his home to say he will be late, but does not say why.

Night has fallen, and giant spotlights are in place on the street, trained on the hotel. The Chief orders them turned away. Virginia arrives. She did not break the engagement. Cosick told her he  would make her unhappy. She tried to get him to see a doctor. The psychiatrist explains the family dynamic in terms of Freudian theory, which boils down to this: Cosick&#x27;s mother taught him to hate his father, which made him hate himself. He wants to love her, but feels unworthy. There is hope that he can be helped.

Virginia pleads with Cosick to come in to her, saying she loves, needs, wants  him. She knows the poem he wrote her by heart. She recites it, but stops at the last lines, which he completes. They are full of despair.

Meanwhile, police place a net below him, out of his sight in the dark. In the street, TV crews train the spotlights on the evangelist, calling “Kneel and pray!”. Among the watchers, the young couple who have become separated

Dunnigan reconnects with Cosick who says he could come in for 10 good reasons—but “life stinks. It&#x27;s rat race.”  

Dunnigan talks about  the good things in his life, and he offers to take Cosick fishing. Cosick agrees to the coming Sunday, but a teenager on the street, mocking Cosick, jumps and accidentally lights a spotlight.  It blinds Cosick, and he falls from the ledge, onto the net. He is hauled into the hotel as the watchers cheer.

The psychiatrist tells Virginia and Dunnigan that Cosick, now sleeping in a hotel room behind them,  wants to live,

In the hotel lobby, Dunnigan&#x27;s son runs into his arms and is carried out to his mother, faintly visible through the revolving doors A Department of Sanitation truck washes the now-empty street clean as the young couple walk away, arm in arm.

==Cast==
==Production==
===Factual basis===
Although the onscreen credits contain a statement saying that the film and characters depicted were &quot;entirely fictional,&quot; the film was based on the suicide of John William Warde, a 26-year-old man who jumped from the 17th floor of the Gotham Hotel in Manhattan on Tuesday, July 26, 1938 after 14 hours on a ledge. The character of Charlie Dunnigan was based on Charles V. Glasco, a policeman who tried to convince Warde to return to the safety of the hotel. In the film, various details about Glasco&#x27;s life were fictionalized.

Pretending to be a bellhop at the hotel, Glasco entered room 1714 and tried to persuade Warde that he would be fired if Warde did not exit the ledge. Glasco spoke with Warde intermittently for 14 hours. Warde, who had made previous suicide attempts, also heard pleas from his sister. Glasco had convinced Warde to return to the hotel, but a photographer scared him as he was reentering. As a result, Warde jumped off of the ledge at 10:38 p.m. Police had tried to rig a net below him, but the net could not be extended sufficiently from the hotel to block his fall. During his 14 hours on the ledge, traffic was stopped for blocks around the hotel and thousands watched the drama unfold.

===Script===
Writer Joel Sayre wrote about the Warde suicide in &quot;The New Yorker&quot; in an article entitled &quot;That Was New York: The Man on the Ledge&quot;, which was published on April 16, 1949. The story was purchased by Twentieth Century-Fox in April 1949 and the studio assigned Sol C. Siegel to produce the film. In August 1949, Fox announced that the team of James Gow and Arnaud d&#x27;Usseau, who had written the Broadway hits &quot;Tomorrow, the World!&quot;, and &quot;Deep Are the Roots&quot;, would write the script. In January 1950, Fox assigned screenwriter John Paxton to write the script, which was entirely fictional despite the real-life event. Paxton elected against employing flashbacks to explain what had led the lead character onto the ledge.

Twentieth Century-Fox changed the title in April 1950 from &quot;The Man on the Ledge&quot; to &quot;Fourteen Hours&quot; following a request from Warde&#x27;s mother, who wished to distance the film from her son&#x27;s story. Studio chief Darryl F. Zanuck considered changing the film&#x27;s setting to another city for the same reason, but it was ultimately filmed in New York.

===Director===
Howard Hawks refused to direct the film because of its subject matter. He was only interested in directing if the script could be converted into a Cary Grant comedy, but Fox declined. Henry Hathaway was assigned to the project in April 1950.

=== Casting ===
Sayre&#x27;s story was originally purchased as a vehicle for Richard Widmark, who was to play Cosick, with Robert Wagner to play the role of Danny, the young man in the couple. The role of Cosick was awarded to Richard Basehart, who had achieved stage fame in &quot;The Hasty Heart&quot; and had just signed a long-term contract with Fox. Paul Douglas was announced for the role of Dunnigan as early as August 1949. Grace Kelly, previously known for appearing in &quot;The Father&quot; on stage, made her film debut in &quot;Fourteen Hours&quot;, besting Anne Bancroft for the role of the would-be divorcée. Barbara Bel Geddes, who plays Cosick&#x27;s love interest, would not appear in another film until &quot;Vertigo,&quot; seven years later.

Hathaway hired more than 300 actors to play bit parts and serve as extras.

===Filming===

Filming began with a modest budget in New York City in June 1950 and lasted 50 days. Much of the filming occurred on Broadway in Manhattan, including exteriors at the American Exchange National Bank building at 128 Broadway. Basehart&#x27;s stunt double on the ledge of the building was Richard Lacovara. There was a padded platform below Lacovara, but it was removed for some shots. Basehart had to endure more than 300 hours on the ledge himself with little movement, despite having a sprained ankle and poison oak rashes on his legs. His wife died of cancer during production of the film.

Gary Cooper noticed Grace Kelly during a visit to the set. He subsequently starred with her in &quot;High Noon&quot;.

In the film&#x27;s original ending, Cosick falls to his death (as did John Warde in the real-life incident). However, on July 17, 1950, Fox president Spyros Skouras&#x27;s 23-year-old daughter Chickie fell to her death from the roof of the Fox West Coast Building. Although authorities were unsure whether the fall was accidental, the woman had recently been treated for mental illness. After Skouras watched a preview version of the film, he refused to release it with its tragic ending, so director Henry Hathaway shot a new ending in which Cosick is saved, which delayed the film&#x27;s release.

==Release==
As a sales gimmick when the film was shown in Baltimore, the studio stationed a trained nurse in the theater lobby to tend to any viewers who might be overcome by the film&#x27;s suspense. Gimmicks were also employed in advertisements for the film, which contained a warning for film critics to avoid divulging the ending and stated that no customers would be seated during the film&#x27;s final ten minutes.

In many American markets, &quot;Fourteen Hours&quot; was presented as the headliner in a double feature with &quot;My Outlaw Brother&quot;.

==Reception==
In a contemporary review for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, critic Bosley Crowther called &quot;Fourteen Hours&quot; a &quot;superior American film&quot; with &quot;hard, staggering shocks&quot; and wrote: &quot;Fox has taken the story of that poor, unbalanced young man, as it recently was recollected in The New Yorker Magazine by Joel Sayre, and has staged it, with liberal alterations and some added atmospheric details, to put on display a hotly throbbing, brutally candid slice of metropolitan life. Fitly directed by Henry Hathaway in crisp journalistic style and played to the hilt down to its &quot;bit&quot; parts, it makes a show of accelerating power.&quot;

Edwin Schallert of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; wrote: &quot;The cast is good, the subject unusual, and &#x27;Fourteen Hours&#x27; is suspenseful in essence. However, it has the big disadvantage of centering around a single issue, which is bound to wear thin. ... Novelty and its documentary quality are the keynotes of the appeal of &#x27;Fourteen Hours,&#x27; though its public perception is likely to be mixed.&quot;

&quot;The New Yorker&quot; praised Basehart&#x27;s performance, writing that he &quot;succeeds in conveying the notion that he is indeed sorely beset.”

&quot;Rotten Tomatoes&quot; rates the film at 63%, based on 8 reviews.

== Awards ==
The film was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Art Direction (Lyle R. Wheeler, Leland Fuller, Thomas Little and Fred J. Rode).

&quot;Fourteen Hours&quot; was listed among the top 10 films of 1951 by the National Board of Review of Motion Pictures. For his performance, Richard Basehart won the board&#x27;s 1951 award for best actor.

The film was nominated for the BAFTA award for best film from any source. Hathaway was nominated for the Golden Lion Award at the Venice Film Festival, and Paxton was nominated for a Writers Guild of America award for his screenplay.

==Remake==
In 1955, &quot;Fourteen Hours&quot; was remade as an episode of &quot;The 20th Century Fox Hour, Man on the Ledge&quot;, starring Cameron Mitchell and Joseph Cotten. The episode was released theatrically in Britain.

==Home video==
When the film was shown at a revival at a Los Angeles theater in 2003, only one print survived. However, the title was included in the &quot;Fox Film Noir&quot; DVD series in 2006.

<doc id="780889" wikidata="Q1552174" url="?curid=780889" title="Green Fire">
<text>Green Fire is a 1954 American CinemaScope and Eastmancolor adventure drama film released by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. It was directed by Andrew Marton and produced by Armand Deutsch, with original music by Miklós Rózsa. The picture stars Grace Kelly, Stewart Granger, Paul Douglas and John Ericson.

Grace Kelly was under contract to MGM, which released &quot;Green Fire,&quot; though she was often dissatisfied with the roles that MGM gave her. She made many of her more famous and critically acclaimed films while loaned out to other studios such as Warner Bros. and Paramount.

==Plot==
Rugged mining engineer Rian Mitchell discovers a lost emerald mine in the highlands of Colombia, which had last been operated by the Spanish conquistadors. Rian is a man consumed by the quest for wealth. However, he has to contend with local bandits and a savage jaguar.

Taken to recuperate at the plantation home of local coffee grower Catherine Knowland and her brother Donald, Rian manages to charm Catherine.

His partner, Vic Leonard, is preparing to leave Colombia on the next ship. Anxious to get Vic&#x27;s assistance to mine the emeralds, Rian tricks Vic into staying. Returning to the mine, Rian first gets Catherine&#x27;s cooperation and then resumes his romantic overtures. However, his greed to get the emeralds at any cost soon creates trouble. He comes into conflict with the chief of the local bandits, who threatens Catherine at her home. Rian also takes Donald into the mining operation, despite Donald&#x27;s complete inexperience, solely in order to obtain the coffee plantation workers on for his mining needs. This, however, means that Catherine does not have enough workers available to pick the coffee when harvest time arrives. Rian&#x27;s mining operations also put the plantation at risk of flooding.

When a tragic accident at the mine site kills Donald, even Vic abandons his old friend Rian and sets out to help Catherine with her harvest, all the while harboring his own passion for the beautiful young woman.

In a shootout between the bandits and Rian&#x27;s men, in which Catherine and Vic do support him, Rian finally comes to his senses and realize his mistakes. At great risk to himself, he sets in place an explosion of dynamite that not only diverts the water away from Catherine&#x27;s plantation, but also buries the mine under tons of rubble, from where it can no longer be reached. He reunites with a forgiving Catherine.

==Production==
===Source material===
The author of the memoir &quot;Green Fire&quot;, on which the film was based, was Major Peter William Rainier 1890–1945, a South African whose great-great-granduncle was the person that Mount Rainier, Washington was named after (by the explorer George Vancouver).

Rainier was a mining engineer who spent eleven years working in the Andes. The book came out in 1942. The &quot;New York Times&quot; praised its &quot;adventure and sense of high spirit&quot;.

Rainier died in a fire at Red Lake in Canada in 1945 while inspecting mining properties.

===Development===
Film rights were bought by MGM. In January 1953 MGM reported that producer Armand Deutsch and writer Everett Freeman were travelling to Colombia to research &quot;Green Fire&quot;. The film was going to be made as a vehicle for Clark Gable, in the vein of &quot;Mogambo&quot; which had been a big success for the actor.

In July MGM said Gable&#x27;s co star would be Grace Kelly, on the basis of her successful appearance in &quot;Mogambo&quot;. By October however the female lead was Eleanor Parker, with Ivan Goff and Ben Roberts having replaced Freeman was writer.

In September 1953 Dore Schary head of MGM announced Richard Thorpe would direct. In January 1954 the film was officially put on the studio&#x27;s schedule for the year. Also in January the male role was assigned from Gable to Stewart Granger, as Gable&#x27;s contract with MGM was about to expire and he refused to re-sign. Later that month Andrew Marton, who had worked with Granger on &quot;King Solomon&#x27;s Mines&quot; and &quot;The Wild North&quot;, was announced as director.

Parker dropped out of the film. MGM wanted to use Grace Kelly but she refused, wanting to make &quot;The Country Girl&quot; at Paramount instead. The studio refused to loan her out. Kelly threatened to retire. Eventually MGM agreed to push back production and let her make &quot;The Country Girl&quot; (Kelly&#x27;s performance in that film earned her a Best Actress Oscar).

Kelly later said &quot;Green Fire&quot; &quot;was not the kind of picture I became an actress to do. I had to accept it for the chance to do &quot;The Country Girl&quot; and it taught me a lesson - never agree to a role before reading a script.&quot;

===Shooting===
In April 1954, a crew of 28, including Granger, Kelly and Paul Douglas, traveled to Colombia for three weeks of location filming. Locations included Magdalena River, Cartagena, Barranquilla, the mountains surrounding Bogota and Buenavista. The shoot was a difficult one, plagued by weather, lack of facilities and complications from the fact that there had recently been a military coup in the country and new permissions needed to be obtained.

Several exteriors were filmed in the Hollywood Hills, just off of Mulholland Drive, where the production company received permission to cut steps into part of the hill. Interiors were completed by May.

In common with all MGM CinemaScope films at the time (1954), it was filmed in both a CinemaScope and a non-anamorphic 4 x 3 version for screening in cinemas that hadn&#x27;t yet converted to CinemaScope.

==Reception==
Granger said &quot;I had the misfortune to be in the only really bad movie Grace ever made.&quot;

===Box office===
According to Dore Schary the film &quot;was a dog and we never should have made it - it was just terrible but we thought it would do well and it would bring in some money. It didn&#x27;t.&quot; However, according to MGM records the film earned $1,829,000 in the US and Canada and $2,631,000 elsewhere, resulting in a profit to the studio of $834,000. In France, the film recorded admissions of 2,048,836.
