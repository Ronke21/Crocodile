<text>The Salinas River (Rumsen: &quot;ua kot taiauačorx&quot;) is the longest river of the Central Coast region of California, running and draining . It flows north-northwest and drains the Salinas Valley that slices through the central California Coast Ranges south of Monterey Bay. The river begins in southern San Luis Obispo County, originating in the Los Machos Hills of the Los Padres National Forest. From there, the river flows north into Monterey County, eventually making its way to connect with the Monterey Bay, part of the Pacific Ocean, approximately south of Moss Landing. The river is a wildlife corridor, and provides the principal source of water from its reservoirs and tributaries for the farms and vineyards of the valley.

== Hydrology ==
In 1769, when the river was first discovered by non-Native peoples via the Portola expedition, it was reported by them as being a &quot;river watering a luxuriant plain&quot; filled with fish weighing . As of the end of 2016, the river had been transformed into little more than a dry bedded run-off feature for the majority of its length.

Until 1989 the Salinas River had a continuous flow throughout the year, stretching back to at least 1941 when the United States Geological Survey (USGS) began complete monitoring records in the Salinas area. Most probably primarily due to recent increases in agricultural water demand in the Salinas Valley, and the resultant lowering of water tables, the lower reaches of the Salinas river (north of King City) remained entirely dry during the three years 2013–2016.

Nonetheless, with sufficiently heavy rains, and on rare occasions, this now normally dry runoff feature is still capable of quickly transforming itself back into a fast-flowing river. In rainfall-induced flood conditions, it can at times measure over a mile in width. During the 20th century, such flood conditions are reported to have generally occurred approximately once every 3–10 years. The last similar flooding event along the river was reported in 1998.

The atypical drought-breaking rains of the winter of 2016–2017 restored the river&#x27;s flow to its lower northern reaches in January 2017.

The current most typical dry or zero flow state of the majority of the river may be more the result of human activity than of any recent changes in weather patterns. Rainfall patterns of recent years in the Salinas area have not significantly changed from historical average rainfall patterns; the 139-year average annual rainfall in Salinas is per year, and the average annual rainfall since 2000 is per year. Recent increases in water use, primarily in the agricultural sector, and the damming of the river and its tributaries may be contributing factors causing the now mostly-dry condition of the riverbed.

The Monterey County Water Resources Agency currently operates a water use monitoring program which requires that all agricultural water users self-report annually on the estimated amount of groundwater pumped from the shrinking Salinas Valley aquifer. This is in contrast to some areas of the country where various water authorities both monitor and regulate water use for agriculture.

The previous ecosystem of the Salinas River, which once included steelhead trout, and numerous other species throughout the full length of a once year-round flowing river, has clearly been drastically impacted in recent years by the expanding heavy demands of agricultural water use in the Salinas Valley, and the resulting most typical dry-river conditions.

Despite regularly running dry, the Salinas River has at the same time had occasional notable floods. Among these were the flood of 1964 and the flood of 1995.

== History ==
=== Hypothesized geological history ===
The geological history of the ancient Salinas River is currently held by tectonic plate theory to likely be rather unique among the many rivers of the western North American seaboard: The shifting position of the raised section of the Pacific Plate that the river flows through was in ancient times aligned with the North American Plate at a point far south of its present location.

The discovery of the Monterey Canyon, the remarkably deep submarine canyon extending into the Pacific from the mouth of the Salinas River, is the basis for the proposal of what is presently thought to be the most probable geological history of the Salinas River.

The long and deep submarine Monterey Canyon dwarfs all other such canyons along the Pacific coast of North America. However, the known flow-rates and drainage area of the Salinas River in no way indicate the river as it presently stands was ever capable of creating such a large submarine outflow canyon. The current hypothesis is that, at one point in the Miocene epoch, many millions of years ago, the river was probably located in the vicinity of what is now Los Angeles County, having been carried north to its present position due to tectonic plate drift at the same rate as currently. When the ancient Salinas river was in that southern location, it may have served as the mouth of a river that drained the catchment of the Colorado River, that currently flows from the Rocky Mountains into the Sea of Cortez in western Mexico.

The Salinas River is also thought to have been, about 700,000 years ago, the outlet for prehistoric Lake Corcoran. Lake Corcoran once filled much of what is now California&#x27;s Central Valley, prior to the lake&#x27;s developing an outlet via the Carquinez Strait, to empty through the present San Francisco Bay.

=== Prehistory ===
People first appeared along the California coast approximately 13,000 years ago, during the latter part of the Pleistocene epoch.

Up until European settlement in Alta California, the indigenous people who lived along the Salinas River were the Rumsen in the northern Salinas Valley, and the Salinan in the southern Salinas Valley.
The Chalon and Esselen peoples also lived in the general vicinity of the Salinas River.

=== Mission and Rancho eras ===
The Salinas river was first sighted by European settlers on 27 September 1769. This first European contact with the river was recorded by the Spanish &quot;colonizing expedition&quot; of Gaspar de Portolà. As was the practice of the Spanish government in the New World at the time, soldiers and priests were then typically sent out together on such colonizing expeditions.

The Portolá expedition included Franciscan priests, who soon thereafter established two missions along the banks of the Salinas river (then referred to as &quot;el Rio de Monterey&quot;.)
The new missions built along the banks of the Salinas river were the Mission Nuestra Señora de la Soledad established in 1791, and the Mission San Miguel Arcángel, established in 1797.

The Mission San Antonio de Padua was established during this same time period in the Salinas Valley, but not on the river itself. These three missions were a part of the chain of 21 missions, then commissioned by the Spanish government in Alta California, now the U.S. State of California. All three of the Salinas Valley missions remain intact to this day, the Soledad mission having evolved into the City of Soledad, and the San Miguel mission having evolved into the unincorporated village of San Miguel. The San Antonio mission is now embedded in Fort Hunter Liggett (a U.S. Army garrison).

The mission period ended with the Mexican revolution and the replacement of missions with ranchos in the 1820s and 30s. Ranchos around the Salinas river included Rancho Las Salinas, Rancho Bolsa Nueva y Moro Cojo

===American rule===
The Rancho period ended with the 1848 American seizure of California from Mexico. The City of Monterey, about 10 miles south of the mouth of the Salinas (at that time), was the capital city of Alta California, and the site of the 7 July 1846 invasion by American warships, commanded by Admiral J.D. Sloat.

===20th century===
When Americans first arrived, the river approached Monterey Bay near Mulligan Hill just north of Marina. It turned north to flow parallel to the bay, separated by sand dunes, before flowing into Elkhorn Slough and finally entering the bay north of Moss Landing. Possibly because of flooding and human activity sometime between 1908 and 1910, the river mouth changed by to a new channel by Mulligan Hill. The old river bed was converted to farmland.

The historic increase in agriculture and settlement in the area, and the related increased water consumption demands have had a significant impact on the Salinas River. The river now typically remains dry or without flow for the majority of the year, and downstream (north) of King City remained fully dry or with zero flow during the years 2013–2016.

== Name ==
During the Spanish / Mexican / Mission period, the river was named &quot;El Rio de Monterey&quot;. When first encountered by the Spanish Portola Expedition on 27 September 1769, the members of the expedition at first suspected that they had found the Carmel River, that had been discovered earlier by Vizcaíno. One of the party members, Father Crespi, then proposed that the [Salinas] river might be a different river, and that it should therefore be given a new name, however he appears to have been over-ruled by the other members of his party at the time.

The first agreed upon name for the river, as it subsequently appeared on many Spanish and Mexican maps, was &quot;Rio de Monterey&quot;, presumably being named after the newly founded nearby town of Monterey, the capital of Alta California. The earliest recorded use of this name for the river was a reference made by Fr. Pedro Font on 4 March 1776. This name continued in use as late as 1850.

After the American annexation of the area, it was renamed the &quot;Salinas River&quot;. The river was apparently renamed as the &quot;Salinas&quot; river by an American cartographer in 1858, ten years after the 1848 American seizure of Alta California from Mexico. In 1858 the newer name &quot;Salinas&quot; first appeared on an American-made map as the &quot;Rio Salinas&quot;, most probably so renamed after the nearby American-founded town of Salinas, which in turn appears to have first been named in 1854 after the old Rancho Las Salinas land grant, parts of which included the city.

==River course==
===Headwaters===
The river begins in southern San Luis Obispo County, approximately east of the summit point of Pine Ridge, at a point just off of Agua Escondido Road, coming down off of the slopes of the Los Machos Hills of the Los Padres National Forest. The only dam situated directly on the Salinas River (the Salinas Dam) forms the small Santa Margarita Reservoir.

===Upriver===
The Salinas flows down the valley bounded on its southwestern side by the Santa Lucia Mountain Range, and bounded on its northeastern side by the Gabilan Mountain Range. It flows past Atascadero and Paso Robles (to Monterey). It receives the natural outflow of the Estrella River and the controlled outflows of the Nacimiento and San Antonio reservoirs through their respective river tributaries in southern Monterey County.

The river passes through the active San Ardo Oil Field, and then into and through the Salinas Valley. It flows past many small towns in the valley, including King City, Greenfield, and Soledad, where it combines with the flash-flood prone Arroyo Seco, its fourth major tributary (in wet years).

===Outflow===
It flows south of the city of Salinas before cutting through Fort Ord and flows into central Monterey Bay approximately 3 miles west of Castroville.

The final stretch of the river forms a lagoon protected by the Salinas River National Wildlife Refuge and its outflow to Monterey Bay is blocked by sand dunes except during winter high-water flows.

===Pre-1906 course===
The land owners altered the course of the river by filling in the river bed during the dry season. This allowed them to farm all of their land and use the water as they saw fit. The old stream bed went from the Old Salinas River, joining Elkhorn Slough on Monterey Bay near Moss Landing, to the present course where the main channel&#x27;s mouth is directly on the Pacific Ocean.

The old Salinas River channel that diverts north behind the sand dunes along the ocean, acts as an overflow channel during the rainy season.

===River Road===
Commencing from Hill Town running south along the western banks of the Salinas River to Gonzales is River Road (County Route G17). This road also falls along the edge of the Santa Lucia Highlands AVA, giving rise to its designation as River Road Wine Trail.

==Ecology==

Before the arrival of Hispanic and American settlers in the area, the Salinas River was once home to abundant fish and beaver populations.

Regarding historical fish populations, the Arroyo Seco is the only major Salinas River tributary which has remained undammed and as of 2015, still supported a small remnant population of the threatened Central Coast Steelhead trout (&quot;Oncorhynchus mykiss&quot;) that once spawned throughout in the Salinas River watershed. At one time it was also an important middle link for salmon migrating from the Salinas River to Tassajara Creek and other tributaries.

Estrella River also remains undammed. A 2015 assessment of the survivability of the river&#x27;s steelhead trout indicated that such a survival may be unlikely, due to the river&#x27;s recent tendency to run dry for most of the year.

Other tributaries of the Salinas River that supported steelhead trout once included Paso Robles Creek, Jack Creek, Atascadero Creek, Santa Margarita Creek and Trout Creek in the upper reaches of the River. It once took over ten days for the steelhead from the upper part of the watershed to migrate to the Pacific Ocean near the City of Marina on Monterey Bay. From there, the steelhead would migrate to the area west of the Aleutian Islands before returning to the spawning grounds in the tributaries of the Salinas River. As noted, the trout life-cycle which requires an annual migration to the sea and then back, was broken during the dry-river conditions of the years 2013–2016, and the current fate of the river&#x27;s steelhead trout remains uncertain at best.

Father Pedro Font described salmon in the Salinas River (&quot;Rio de Monterey&quot;) on the de Anza Expedition in March 1776:
... there are obtained also many good salmon which enter the river to spawn. Since they are fond of fresh water they ascend the streams so far that I am assured that even at the mission of San Antonio some of the fish which ascend the Rio de Monterey have been caught. Of this fish we ate almost every day while we were here.

If Father Font was describing salmon (and not steelhead), then his records suggest that salmon once traversed the Salinas River main stem and up its San Antonio River tributary to Mission San Antonio near what is now Jolon. This may support other historical observer records primarily in the form of oral histories taken and compiled by H.A. Franklin that placed Chinook salmon in the mainstem as far south as Atascadero where Highway 41 crosses, as well as southern tributaries of the Salinas River, including the Las Tablas Creek tributary of the Nacimiento River, and Jack Creek, a tributary of Paso Robles Creek west of Templeton.

In regards to the area&#x27;s historical beaver population, after a period of depletion by 19th-century fur trappers, California golden beaver (&quot;Castor canadensis subauratus&quot;) populations rebounded and expanded their range from the Salinas River mouth to the San Antonio River tributary below its reservoir and beyond to the upper Salinas River watershed. More recent accounts suggested that beaver are no longer found along the northern reaches of the river, a recent comprehensive survey found beaver throughout the entire Salinas River mainstem and virtually all of its major tributaries, including the Estrella River.

==Agricultural use==
The use of the river for irrigation in the Salinas Valley makes it one of the most productive agricultural regions in California. It is especially known as one of the principal regions for lettuce and artichokes in the United States. 

The river is shallow above ground, periodically dry, with much of its flow underground. The underground flow results from numerous aquifers, which are recharged by water from the Salinas, especially from the Nacimiento and San Antonio lakes during the dry months. In the 18th and early 19th centuries, the river valley provided the route of El Camino Real, the principal overland route from southern to northern Alta California, used by Spanish explorers and missionaries and early Mexican settlers.

<doc id="778923" wikidata="Q1197455" url="?curid=778923" title="Naha Airport">
<text>is an international airport located west of the city hall in Naha, Okinawa Prefecture, Japan. It is Japan&#x27;s sixth busiest airport and the primary air terminal for passengers and cargo traveling to and from Okinawa Prefecture, Japan. It handles scheduled international traffic to Taiwan, Hong Kong, South Korea, Thailand, Malaysia, Singapore and mainland China. The airport is also home to Naha Air Base of the Japan Air Self-Defense Force.

Naha Airport is the hub for Japan Transocean Air, which connects Okinawa Prefecture with other prefectures of Japan, and Ryukyu Air Commuter, which connects Okinawa main island with surrounding islands.

Naha Airport is a 24-hour airport, and served 21.5 million passengers in 2018, an increase of roughly three million passengers in two years. It’s the sixth busiest airport in Japan after New Chitose Airport in Sapporo. As of 2022, the route between Tokyo Haneda Airport and Naha Airport is the third busiest in Japan, while the route between Fukuoka Airport and Naha is the seventh busiest.
The longest domestic scheduled flight in Japan is the daily route between New Chitose and Naha, operated by Peach Aviation. The flight takes 4 hours.

According to Skytrax’s World Top Airports 100 in 2024, Naha Airport is ranked 91st in the world, a significant improvement from 199th place the previous year, making Naha Airport the most improved airport in the world.


==History==

===Early years===
, an Imperial Japanese Navy airfield, opened in 1933. The base was taken over by the United States in 1945 and was renamed . Pan American World Airways and Northwest Orient began service to Naha in 1947. The airport was closed for refurbishment between 1952 and 1954. Japan Airlines began service to Okinawa during this time and initially used Kadena Air Base.

Air America operated interisland flights to Miyako and Ishigaki from 1964 to 1967, when Southwest Airlines (now Japan Transocean Air) took over these routes. Okinawa was returned to Japan in 1972. In 1982, Naha Airport was transferred from US military control to the Japan Air Self-Defense Force. The basic and detailed design engineering works in addition to the later construction management phase of the main passenger terminal were awarded in the 1990s in part to the Japan Branch of the American design-build engineering company, The Austin Company, which joined Japanese firms in a joint venture design consortium.

===Development===
The airport has been undergoing major development projects that will continue to transform the airport. In 2008, the government agreed to significantly expand the domestic terminal, which will require the relocation of cargo facilities and the international terminal.

The construction of a second parallel runway began on March 1, 2014 on of an artificial island. 

The new international terminal opened in February 2014. The international terminal was again expanded by in November 2016. A new building connecting the domestic and international terminals was completed in 2019, the second runway began operation in March 26 2020.

A LCCT terminal has been in operation since 2012. A six-lane under bay tunnel for auto transport linking the airport with the Naha Port boosting the utility of the intermodal facility was completed in 2011. This tunnel will also link a Free Trade Zone near the Airport with another FTZ located at Nakagusuku Bay. Peach, a low-cost carrier (LCC) based at Kansai International Airport in Osaka, announced that it would establish its second hub at Naha in July 2014, which would initially have flights to Osaka, Fukuoka, Ishigaki and Taipei. ANA Holdings, the parent company of both Peach and Vanilla Air, opened a new LCC terminal in a refurbished portion of the airport&#x27;s cargo area in October 2012, and plans to open new international facilities in October 2014.

==Terminals==


* Domestic Terminal (1999) - replaced former domestic terminal, extended to include LCCT, other extensions works to conclude in 2016.
* Cargo Terminal (2009) - Former domestic terminal became the cargo terminal
* LCCT Terminal (2012) - north annex of domestic terminal (Peach Domestic &amp; International only).
* New International Terminal (2014) - replaced old international terminal
* New Integrated Terminal (2019) - The building connecting the domestic and international terminals was completed and began integrated operation.

==Airlines and destinations==

===Passenger===

===Cargo service===
All Nippon Airways operates an overnight cargo hub at Naha Airport, which receives inbound Boeing 767 freighter flights from key destinations in Japan, China and Southeast Asia between 1 and 4 a.m., followed by return flights between 4 and 6 a.m., allowing overnight service between these regional hubs as well as onward connections to other ANA and partner carrier flights.

The hub began operations in 2009; by 2013 it served eight cities, and ANA had chartered a Nippon Cargo Airlines Boeing 747 freighter to handle demand on the trunk route from Narita International Airport.

==Statistics==
==Accidents and incidents==

* On July 27, 1970, Flying Tiger Line Flight 45, a Douglas DC-8-63AF flying to Da Nang Air Force Base from Los Angeles via San Francisco and Tokyo, was on its final approach when it crashed 0.4 miles short of Runway 18, killing all 4 crew members.
* On December 11, 1994, Armaldo Forlani (Ramzi Yousef) planted a bomb on Philippine Airlines Flight 434, which exploded while the flight was en route from Cebu to Tokyo, killing one passenger and injuring ten other passengers. The plane made an emergency landing at Naha Airport safely.
* On August 20, 2007, China Airlines Flight 120, a Boeing 737-800, was taxiing to the ramp after landing when suddenly a fire started beneath the right wing, quickly engulfing the entire plane. All passengers and crew members were evacuated safely. Investigations later revealed that part of the slat drive mechanism pierced the fuel tank, and the leaking fuel ignited when it came into contact with hot engine parts.
* On June 3, 2015, an All Nippon Airways Boeing 737 bound for Sapporo aborted takeoff at Naha after a JASDF CH-47 Chinook helicopter crossed its departure path without clearance. An inbound Japan Transocean Air flight landed on the same runway, stopping 400 meters behind the ANA aircraft, despite an air traffic control order to go around, which the JTA pilot claimed to have received after landing.
* On December 4, 2020, Japan Airlines Flight 904, operated by a Boeing 777-200 from Okinawa Naha airport to Tokyo Haneda suffered a fan blade failure in one of its two PW4084 engines. None of the 189 occupants on board were injured in the incident.

==Access==
The airport is served by the Okinawa Urban Monorail (Yui Rail) which carries passengers from Naha Airport Station to the center of Naha, and to the terminal at Tedako-Uranishi Station in Urasoe. Bus service is also available to many parts of Okinawa Island.

<text>Iitti (; ) is a municipality of Finland. It is located in the province of Southern Finland and is part of the Päijänne Tavastia region. The municipality has a population of () and covers an area of of which is water. The population density is . Neighbour municipalities are Heinola, Kouvola, Lapinjärvi, Lahti and Orimattila. The municipality is unilingually Finnish.

The current administrative center of Iitti is in the village of Kausala. In 1990, the historical center of Iitti, which surrounds the old parish church, was voted the most attractive &quot;kirkonkylä&quot; (&quot;church village&quot;) in Finland.

In the coat of arms of Iitti, the gray wavy fess refers to Kymi River and the key above it to the municipality&#x27;s central position along the river. The coat of arms was designed by heraldist Ahti Hammar, and was officially confirmed for use on 3 March 1953.

The Kymi Ring motor sport center is located in Iitti, right next to the border of Kouvola.

== History ==

The surroundings of lakes Urajärvi and Pyhäjärvi have been known to be exploited as wilderness since the Stone Age, although no signs of permanent habitation from the era have been found, and the area is presumed to have been entirely uninhabitated in the interim between the Stone Age and the conversion of Finland to Christianity. By the end of paganism, Iitti had gained its first permanent inhabitants first from Hauho and Vanaja, as well as later on from Hollola.

The oldest village in Iitti is presumed to be Kauramaa, though several others are mentioned in documents dating to the Middle Ages. Administratively, Iitti was a chapel subordinated to the parish of Hollola until 1539, after which it became an independent parish that also included Nastola, Jaala, Valkeala and parts of Mäntyharju, by proclamation from Gustav I. At this time, Iitti had 14 villages and 89 estates.

Iitti suffered greatly over the Russo-Swedish War of 1788–1790, becoming a battleground as well as a headquarters for Swedish forces. The battle of Tillolankangas was one of the bloodiest over the entire war in Finland; the Swedes&#x27; victory cemented the liberation of the villages around river Kymi. Over the course of the war, 13 villages were destroyed in Iitti.

Until 2021, Iitti was part of the Kymenlaakso region before it became part of Päijänne Tavastia.

<text>Butler University is a private university in Indianapolis, Indiana, United States. Founded in 1855 and named after founder Ovid Butler, the university has over 60 major academic fields of study within six colleges in the arts, business, communication, education, liberal arts and the sciences, and health sciences. It enrolls approximately 5,700 undergraduate and graduate students. Its campus is approximately northwest of downtown Indianapolis.

==History==
On January 15, 1850, the Indiana General Assembly adopted Ovid Butler&#x27;s proposed charter for a new Christian university in Indianapolis. After five years in development, the school opened on November 1, 1855, as North-Western Christian University at 13th Street and College Avenue on Indianapolis&#x27;s near northside at the eastern edge of the present-day Old Northside Historic District. Attorney and university founder Ovid Butler provided the property. The university was founded by members of the Christian Church (Disciples of Christ), although it was never controlled by that church. The university&#x27;s charter called for &quot;a non-sectarian institution free from the taint of slavery, offering instruction in every branch of liberal and professional education&quot;. The university was the second in Indiana and the third in the United States to admit both men and women.

The university established the first professorship in English literature and the first Department of English in the state of Indiana. In 1869, Ovid Butler endowed the Demia Butler Chair of English Literature in honor of his daughter, who was the first woman to graduate from the Classical course at the university and had died in 1867. The chair was the first endowed position at an American university designated for a female professor. Catharine Merrill, was the first to occupy the chair in 1869. Merrill was just the second female university professor in the country.

The university moved to a new campus in the community of Irvington on the east side of Indianapolis in 1875, and changed its name to Butler University in 1877. The university was renamed for Ovid Butler &quot;in recognition of Ovid Butler&#x27;s inspirational vision, determined leadership, and financial support&quot;. The campus consisted of several buildings, including an observatory, most of which were demolished in 1939. The Bona Thompson Library at the intersection of Downey and University avenues, designed by architects Henry H. Dupont and Jesse T. Johnson, is the only remaining building, although several buildings that housed faculty remain, including the Benton House.

In 1896, Butler joined with two private professional schools, the Medical College of Indiana and the Indiana Law School, to form the University of Indianapolis (U of I), an institution unrelated to the modern university of that name. The Indiana Dental College later joined in 1904. Renamed as Butler College, the school constituted the undergraduate and liberal arts organ of the new university. Butler left U of I in 1906 after the Medical College of Indiana joined with Purdue University&#x27;s medical school in 1905 (itself later merging with the Indiana University School of Medicine in 1908). 

In 1930, Butler merged with the Teachers College of Indianapolis, founded by Eliza Cooper Blaker, creating the university&#x27;s second college. The third college, the College of Business Administration, was established in 1937, and the College of Pharmacy and Health Sciences was established in 1945, following a merger that absorbed the Indianapolis College of Pharmacy. The Jordan College of Fine Arts, the university&#x27;s fifth college, was established in 1951, following a merger with the Arthur Jordan Conservatory of Music. 

The university&#x27;s department of religion became a separate Christian Church seminary and &quot;college of applied Christianity&quot; in 1924; it was variously called the School of Religion and the College of Religion. The school became independent in 1958 and is currently known as the Christian Theological Seminary.

==Campus==

Enrollment at Butler increased following the end of World War I, prompting the administration to examine the need for a larger campus. The new and current campus, designed in part by architect George Sheridan, was formed on the site of Fairview Park, a former amusement park on the city&#x27;s northwest side. Classes began on the campus in 1928.

In 1928, the first building completed on the Fairview campus was Arthur Jordan Memorial Hall, designed by Robert Frost Daggett and Thomas Hibben. The structure&#x27;s Collegiate Gothic style of architecture, also used in the original William Tinsley-designed 13th Street and College Avenue building, set the tone for subsequent buildings erected on the campus over the next three decades. The same year, the Butler Fieldhouse (later renamed Hinkle Fieldhouse) was completed after having been designed by architect Fermor Spencer Cannon. The building remained the largest indoor sports facility in the state until the mid-1960s.

In 1942, the Religion Building and Sweeney Chapel were both completed. These structures, designed by Burns and James, were remodeled and combined into Robertson Hall in 1966. 

Following World War II, construction began on the student center, Atherton Union (designed by McGuire and Shook). McGuire and Shook also designed the dormitories called Ross Hall and Schwitzer Hall. Art Lindbergh, with help from Daggett, designed the Holcomb Observatory and Planetarium, which was dedicated in 1955.

In 1963, Irwin Library, designed by acclaimed architect Minoru Yamasaki, opened. Also in the early 1960s, Lilly Hall and Clowes Memorial Hall were constructed following the move of the Arthur Jordan Conservatory of Music to the campus. Clowes Hall, which opened in 1963, was co-designed by Indianapolis architect Evans Woollen III and John M. Johansen (of New Canaan, Connecticut). Ten years following the construction of Clowes Hall and Irwin Library, the science complex of Gallahue Hall and the Holcomb Research Institute (now Holcomb Building) were built, completing the U-shaped complex of academic buildings.

In 1990, the Residential College, designed by James and Associates, was completed, becoming the university&#x27;s last major construction project of the 20th century.

In 2001, the Fairbanks Center for Communication and Technology was opened.

In early 2004, the Eidson-Duckwall Recital Hall, seating 140, was added onto Robertson Hall.

On May 8, 2008, Butler broke ground on a , four-story addition to the Pharmacy and Health Sciences Building.

In 2013, the Howard L. Schrott Center for the Arts opened.

==Academics==
The university is organized into the following schools and colleges:
* Andre B. Lacy School of Business
* College of Communication
* College of Education
* College of Liberal Arts and Sciences
* College of Pharmacy and Health Sciences
* Jordan College of the Arts

Over 60 major academic fields of study, 8 pre-professional programs, and 19 graduate programs are offered across the six academic colleges. Butler ranks first among Midwest Regional Universities in &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot;″s 2024 Best Colleges. The publication also ranked the university first in the Midwest for both innovation and undergraduate teaching. Nationally, the publication ranked Butler 16th for first-year experiences and 28th for study abroad opportunities. 

The university emphasizes the practicality of knowledge and offers individual attention to its students with its small class size and no teaching assistants. Butler University increased its focus on faculty and student research with the Butler Institute for Research and Scholarship (BIRS), bolstered by a $1-million grant from Lilly Endowment. The university also provides student research opportunities, such as the Butler Summer Institute, a 10-week program in which Butler students are granted funding to perform independent research with a faculty member.

==Student life==

Students at Butler University participate in more than 150 student organizations and dozens of club and intramural sports, and many multi-cultural programs and services. More than 94 percent of students are involved in campus activities.

===Greek organizations===
Greek life is a popular option at Butler with over 35 percent of undergraduates becoming members of social fraternities or sororities. Fraternities and sororities have long been a part of student life at Butler, with the first fraternity established in 1859, and the first sorority established in 1874.

In 1922, Sigma Gamma Rho was founded at Butler University. The sorority had its beginnings on the Irvington campus of Butler University.

==Athletics==
Butler&#x27;s athletic teams, known as the Butler Bulldogs, compete in Division I of the NCAA. On July 1, 2012, the Bulldogs left the Horizon League, their conference home since 1979, for the Atlantic 10 Conference. Since the A-10 does not sponsor football, the Butler football team plays in the FCS&#x27;s Pioneer League. The women&#x27;s golf team at Butler joined the Metro Atlantic Athletic Conference, as the A-10 sponsors the sport only for men. Butler left the Atlantic 10 Conference and became a founding member of the reconfigured Big East Conference on July 1, 2013.

In the past decade, Butler teams have captured 26 conference championships (in four different leagues). The Bulldogs have made appearances in NCAA National Championship Tournaments in men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s basketball, men&#x27;s soccer, volleyball, men&#x27;s cross country, lacrosse, and baseball. Butler won the James J. McCafferty trophy, awarded annually by the Horizon League for all-sports excellence based on conference championship points, seven times, including three-straight from 1996–97 to 1998–99 and back-to-back years in 2001–02 and 2002–03, 2006–07, and 2009–10.

===Men&#x27;s basketball===

The Butler program was one of the most successful &quot;mid-major&quot; basketball programs from 2000 to 2011, having won at least 20 games and reached postseason play eight of the last ten seasons, including six NCAA tournament appearances. Butler also holds two national championships in men&#x27;s basketball from the pre-tournament era: one from 1924 (earned via the AAU national tournament), and one from 1929 (selected by the Veteran Athletes of Philadelphia).

In 2010 and 2011, Butler qualified for consecutive national championship games. The 2010 Butler team, led by star player Gordon Hayward, advanced to the national championship game at their hometown Lucas Oil Stadium, where they lost a close game to Duke, while creating an enduring reputation of its athletes prioritizing education by attending classes the day of the game. With a total enrollment of only 4,500 students, Butler is the smallest school to play for a national championship since the tournament expanded to 64 teams in 1985. In 2011, the Bulldogs advanced to the championship game but finished as runners-up again, this time losing to Connecticut.

===Football===
The Hoosier Helmet Trophy was established as the trophy helmet for the rivalry football game played between Butler and Valparaiso University. The Hoosier Helmet was created prior to the 2006 season to commemorate the football rivalry that has existed since 1921. The helmet trophy was created to further intensify the rivalry between these two teams. A group of Butler players, along with their head coach, Jeff Voris, came up with the idea. After Valparaiso head coach Stacey Adams agreed to play for the helmet, Butler equipment manager John Harding put the trophy together.

<text>USS &quot;Barry&quot;, was a , she was the first ship of the United States Navy to be named for Commodore John Barry (1745–1803).

==Construction==
&quot;Barry&quot; was launched on 22 March 1902, by Neafie and Levy Ship and Engine Building Company of Philadelphia; sponsored by Miss Charlotte Adams Barnes the great-grandniece of Commodore Barry: and commissioned on 24 November 1902, Lieutenant Noble Edward Irwin in command.

==Service history==
===Commissioning===
&quot;Barry&quot; was assigned to the 1st Torpedo Flotilla, Coast Squadron, North Atlantic Fleet, and during the summer of 1903 participated in maneuvers off the New England coast.

===Transfer to the Far East===
Setting out on 23 December 1903, the flotilla proceeded by way of Puerto Rico and the Canary Islands to Gibraltar where it arrived on 27 January 1904. Resuming the voyage on 31 January, the warships stopped at Algiers for a week in early February. On 9 February, they arrived at Valletta, Malta, where the flotilla and had to lay over for a fortnight while &quot;Barry&quot; went into dry dock to have her propellers repaired after damaging them while mooring. Transiting the Suez Canal on 26 February, the flotilla stayed at Port Suez, Egypt, until the 29th when it headed down the Red Sea to Aden. In March, &quot;Barry&quot; and her companions visited Bombay, India, and Colombo, Ceylon. They made the last stop before reaching their destination, a port call at Singapore, between 3 and 9 April. The flotilla then made the relatively short final leg of the voyage, from Singapore to Cavite in the Philippines, on 9 April 1904.

===&quot;Show the flag&quot; - China 1905–1906===
On 1 July 1905, &quot;Barry&quot; stood out of Manila Bay with the flotilla to accompany the battleship and cruiser squadrons on the annual northern redeployment to conduct summer exercises and to &quot;show the flag&quot; in Chinese waters. The first portion of the normal summer drills and port visits went off as usual; but, early in August, China displayed another burst of nationalism when a boycott was organized in response to the Chinese exclusion policy then in effect on the American west coast. Initially, this brought little disruption to the Asiatic Fleet&#x27;s routine. The warships carried out their exercises and visited Chinese ports as usual. The destroyers even returned south to the Philippines in October according to custom. Only then came the break with normal routine. Instead of passing the winter months in the Philippines, &quot;Barry&quot; and spent just six weeks there before returning north to China late in November after President Theodore Roosevelt chose to brandish the &quot;Big Stick&quot;.

The mission lasted through the winter with the destroyers joining other ships of the Asiatic Fleet in repeated calls at Chinese ports in a vigorous display of the naval might of the United States. By the spring of 1906, the Chinese national feeling against the United States had subsided so that, though &quot;Barry&quot; and &quot;Bainbridge&quot; remained in Chinese waters and continued to &quot;show the flag,&quot; they were also able to resume many of the normal training evolutions more typical of their annual summer sojourns in Chinese waters. Her stay in northern waters thus continued through the summer and into the fall. At the end of September, &quot;Barry&quot; and &quot;Bainbridge&quot; left Chefoo, China, in company with to return to the Philippines for the first time since the previous fall. After stopping off at Amoy, China, from 3 to 8 October, the warships arrived back at Cavite on the 10th.

===Asiatic Station===
On the Asiatic Station she served with the 1st Torpedo Flotilla, Battleship Squadron, until August 1917, except for two short periods (2 April – 21 December 1908 and on 21 October 1912 – 24 June 1913) out of commission.

===World War I===
On 1 August 1917, &quot;Barry&quot; stood out of Cavite with the rest of her division and embarked on the long voyage to Europe. She steamed by way of Borneo, Singapore, Ceylon, and India, making extended pauses at Columbo, Ceylon, where the division had to wait for &quot;Barry&quot; to repair a damaged propeller, and at Bombay, India, before reaching the southern terminus of the Suez Canal on 23 September. The division transited the canal on 25 September arriving at Port Said, Egypt, early in the afternoon. After a week at Port Said, &quot;Barry&quot; headed across the Mediterranean with the division. She steamed with the division to Malta, arriving in Valletta on 6 October and leaving again the following day escorting some ships to Naples. On the 9th, &quot;Barry&quot; and her division mates saw the merchant ships safely into Naples where they stood down for almost a week. She and her colleagues stood out of Naples on the last leg of their voyage on 15 October and reached their new base at Gibraltar on the 20th.

She escorted merchantmen in the Mediterranean until August 1918 and arrived at Charleston, South Carolina on 5 September. She remained there until the end of the year performing patrol and convoy duties. In January 1919, she left for the Philadelphia Navy Yard where she was decommissioned on 28 June and sold on 3 January 1920 to Henry A. Hitner&#x27;s Sons Company of Philadelphia.

<text>Ilmajoki (; ) is a municipality of Finland. Ilmajoki is a town and municipality situated in Finland&#x27;s South Ostrobothnia region, founded in 1865. Ilmajoki has a population of 12,165 (28. February 2017) and covers an area of 579.79 km2 (223.86 sq mi), of which 2.89 km2 (1.12 sq mi) is water. The population density is 20.2 inhabitants per square kilometre (52.3 per sq mi). Ilmajoki borders the municipalities of Isokyrö, Kurikka, Laihia and Seinäjoki. The municipality is unilingually Finnish.

The population of Ilmajoki has increased by 700 over the past year (vuosi), with one in five inhabitants being under 14 years of age. Ilmajoki&#x27;s tax rate is the lowest in all of South Ostrobothnia at 20.24% (average in South Ostrobothnia is 21.23%). Ilmajoki&#x27;s production of renewable electricity exceeds it consumption of electricity.

Each June, thousands of people gather for opera, organized annually by Ilmajoki Music Festival. Plenty of sightseeing opportunities exist for those interested in history. Successful athletes from Ilmajoki include Olympic javelin thrower Tero Pitkämäki and Finnish former wrestler Marko Yli-Hannuksela.

==Geography==
The geographic location of Ilmajoki is surrounded by nature and a scenic view of northern open countryside. Kyrönjoki River, South Ostrobothnia&#x27;s largest river, flows onto the shores of Finland&#x27;s largest fields. Kyrönjoki has been chosen as one of the National Landscapes of Finland.

== History ==
Ilmajoki existed as a part of other municipalities in South Ostrobothnia, as has been the case for Kyrö/Kyrönjoensuu/Pohjankyrö which presently exist together as Isokyrö&#x27;s civil parish. Ilmajoki&#x27;s congregation was established under Isokyrö&#x27;s civil parish, and extended to the areas of present-day Alavus, Jalasjärvi, Kauhajoki, Kurikka, Peräseinäjoki and Seinäjoki. In 1532, the Ilmajoki area gained independence, and Ilmajoki&#x27;s civil parish was founded. To compare, this occurred in Kyrö at a much later time in the 1550s. Ilmajoki held its first trials in 1554. In 1575, administration was established at the first mention of Ilmajoki&#x27;s own nominee.

Greater-Ilmajoki has since been independent of Alavus, Jalasjärvi, Kauhajoki, Kurikka, Peräseinäjoki and Seinäjoki. As stipulated by a municipal decree in 1867, the municipality of Ilmajoki began operating on its own, following the municipal administration&#x27;s separation from the church.

During the Cudgel War in the years 1596–1597, Jaakko Ilkka from Ilmajoki led the peasants as their leader but was executed by his opponents in January 1597. The following month, the war&#x27;s final and largest engagement, the Battle of Santavuori, took place in Ilmajoki.

There are also a number of original one-and-half-story houses, as well as two-story houses traditionally seen in the South Ostrobothnia region. Grandfather clocks were manufactured in Ilmajoki, and a concentration of blacksmiths specialized in horse carriages developed in the village of Nopankylä – both of which portray aspects of Ilmajoki&#x27;s long-standing traditions in construction and design.

==Economy==
Business and entrepreneurship have long been traditions in Ilmajoki, with nearly 1,000 companies. Ilmajoki has repeatedly been rated as one of the top entrepreneurial municipalities, according to an annual survey conducted by South Ostrobothnia&#x27;s Federation of Finnish Enterprise (Yrittäjät). The municipality also maintains a highly advanced bio and environmental economy.

The largest industrial plant is Altia’s Koskenkorva manufacturing plant, which produces ethanol as a raw material for Koskenkorva viina, a clear spirit drink in Finland. Also known as “Kossu”, Koskenkorva has become one of Finland&#x27;s most recognized brands, domestically and internationally.

A privately owned airport that meets international standards is situated in Ilmajoki&#x27;s village of Rengonkylä. The busy traffic route between Seinäjoki and Kaskinen runs through Ilmajoki. The distance from Ilmajoki to Seinäjoki is 17 km, to Vaasa 70 km, to Tampere 150 km and to Helsinki 360 km.

<text>Ngchesar, also known as Oldiais, is one of the sixteen states of the nation of Palau in Oceania.

== History ==
The terraces in the village of Ngerngesang are examples of archaeological sites in the area, through radiocarbon dating, are believed to date back to 491 and 1150 AD.

Ngchesar, like the rest of Palau, was part of the Spanish Empire from the 16th century until 1899 when the territory was sold to the Empire of Germany who ruled the area until the end of World War I, at which time the Empire of Japan took over the area until the end of World War II when the United States took possession of the Territory. Ngchesar became an autonomous state after Palau&#x27;s independence from the United States.

== Geography ==
Ngchesar is located on the south central east coast between Melekeok and Airai and extends from the coast to the Rael Kedam. The coast is lined with a thick fringe of mangrove swamp forest backed by a ridge parallel to the coast. This coastal ridge is cut by short, steep drainages separated by small ridges which extend like fingers to the coast. Along the coastal plain and ridge, are coconut plantations, thick forests and savannas with thick grass. West of the coastal ridge is the large central valley of the Ngerdorch River. An open forest lines the east side of the valley with rolling hills covered by scrub vegetation on the west. The flanks of the Rael Kedam are covered with a thick upland forest. The southwest part of the state is drained by the Meskelat River, a major tributary of the Ngerdorch. Much of the southern part of the state is covered with open forest.

There are 291 inhabitants, and its capital is Ngersuul. It is the sixth largest state in terms of land, with an area of roughly 40 square kilometers, and it is located on the eastern side of the island of Babeldaob, northwest of Airai State, and southeast of Melekeok State, where the Palauan government is situated. The sacred totem of Ngchesar is the Stingray.
Ngchesar is famous for its war canoe &quot;kabekel&quot; named Bisbush which means Lightning.

Presently, most of the use of the land in Ngchesar is confined to gardens surrounding the modern villages of Ngerngesang and Ngchesar and the smaller hamlets at Rrai, Ngerkesou, Simizu, and Ngeruikl. Interspersed with these kitchen gardens are stands of agroforest which include coconut, and betelnut, breadfruit, almond trees, and banana plants. In and around many of the uninhabited villages are stands of coconut and betelnut palms, and occasionally patches of irregularly attended taro swamp gardens. Except for occasional forays to hunt pigeon or harvest special plants, there is little active use of most of the interior of Ngchesar.

== Demography ==
The population of the state was 291 in the 2015 census and median age was 34.5 years. The official languages of the state are Palauan and English. Ngirakebou is the title of the traditional high chief from the state.

In June 1972, the resident population was 604.

==Political system==
Ngchesar has its own constitution, adopted in 1981. The state government was established in 1982. The state of Ngchesar, with population of less than 300, has an elected chief executive, governor. The state also has a legislature elected every four years. The state population elects one of the members in the House of Delegates of Palau.

== Transport ==
A bladed road now connects Ngchesar to Ngatpang extending from Ngerngesang on the east coast, across the Ngerdorch at Simizu, and crossing the Rael Kedam at Ollumel la Rechieb (Peaches). During the Japanese administration, a network of roads connected Ngchesar to Melekeok, Ngatpang, and Airai, but today these roads are impassable. A road along the coast connects the modern villages from Rrai to Ngeruikl, and a trails extend further north to Ngerubesang in Melekeok.

== Traditional villages ==
More than a dozen traditional village sites lie within Ngchesar, with at least two situated at some distance from the coast on the coastal ridge. The traditional villages represent important symbols giving identity to families, clans, and regions. Within villages are numerous stone features with historical and traditional importance. Many of the stone platforms, odesongel, serve as clan cemeteries, and other stone features serve as shrines. The lagoon is an important resource area and was intensively exploited prehistorically. Important resources include the many species of fish. Near Ngerngesang and the other traditional villages are taro swamp gardens, and most village sites are surrounded by garden plots and terraced hillsides.

==Education==
The Ministry of Education operates public schools.

Palau High School in Koror is the country&#x27;s only public high school, so children from this community go there.

<text>Bernard Shalom Kotzin (November 11, 1918 – December 14, 1997), known as Stubby Kaye, was an American actor, comedian, vaudevillian and singer, known for his appearances on Broadway and in film musicals.

Kaye originated the roles of Nicely-Nicely Johnson in &quot;Guys and Dolls&quot; and Marryin&#x27; Sam in &quot;Li&#x27;l Abner&quot;, introducing two show-stopping numbers of the era: &quot;Sit Down, You&#x27;re Rockin&#x27; the Boat&quot; and &quot;Jubilation T. Cornpone.&quot; He reprised these roles in the movie versions of the shows. Other well-known roles include Herman in Bob Fosse&#x27;s &quot;Sweet Charity&quot;, Sam the Shade in &quot;Cat Ballou&quot;, and Marvin Acme in &quot;Who Framed Roger Rabbit&quot;.

==Biography==
Kaye was first generation born Bernard Sholom Kotzin in 1918, at West 114th Street in the Morningside Heights section of Manhattan. He kept his original name secret throughout his career. His parents were Jewish-Americans originally from Russia and Austria-Hungary. His father, David Kotzin, was a dress salesman, and the former Harriet &quot;Hattie&quot; Freundlish was his mother. He was raised in the Far Rockaway section of Queens and later in The Bronx, where he acted in student productions at DeWitt Clinton High School, and where he graduated in 1937.

In 1939, he won the &quot;Major Bowes Amateur Hour&quot; contest on radio where the prize included touring in vaudeville, where he was sometimes billed as an &quot;Extra Padded Attraction.&quot; During the Second World War, he joined the USO where he toured battle fronts and made his London debut performing with Bob Hope. After the war, he continued to work in vaudeville and as master of ceremonies for the swing orchestras of Freddy Martin and Charlie Barnet.

As Nicely-Nicely Johnson in &quot;Guys and Dolls&quot;, first on Broadway (1950) and then in the film version (1955), Kaye introduced &quot;Fugue for Tinhorns&quot; (&quot;I got the horse right here, his name is Paul Revere...&quot;) and &quot;Sit Down, You&#x27;re Rockin&#x27; the Boat.&quot; He created the role of Marryin&#x27; Sam in &quot;Li&#x27;l Abner&quot; on Broadway (1956), introducing the song &quot;Jubilation T. Cornpone.&quot; In 1957 he was named best actor in a musical by the Outer Critics Circle. In his New York Times review, Brooks Atkinson said Kaye sang &quot;it with that vaudeville rhythm and those vaudeville blandishments that turn song numbers into triumphant occasions.&quot; He also played the role in the film (1959). His next Broadway show, &quot;Everybody Loves Opal,&quot; starring Eileen Heckart, closed after 21 performances in 1961.

In 1956, he co-starred with June Allyson and Jack Lemmon in the film&quot;You Can&#x27;t Run Away from It&quot;, a musical remake of &quot;It Happened One Night&quot;. He played the title character in Michael Winner&#x27;s British film &quot;The Cool Mikado&quot; (1962), based on Gilbert and Sullivan&#x27;s comic opera, &quot;The Mikado&quot;.

In the mid-1950s, Kaye guest starred on NBC&#x27;s early sitcom &quot;The Martha Raye Show&quot;. In 1958, he appeared on the short-lived NBC variety show &quot;The Gisele MacKenzie Show&quot;. About this time, he also appeared on ABC&#x27;s &quot;The Pat Boone Chevy Showroom&quot;. In the 1959–60 television season, Kaye co-starred in the short-lived NBC sitcom &quot;Love and Marriage&quot;.
In the 1960–61 television season, Kaye appeared as Marty, the agent of aspiring actress Eileen Sherwood, in the CBS sitcom &quot;My Sister Eileen&quot;, starring Shirley Bonne, Elaine Stritch, Jack Weston, Raymond Bailey, and Rose Marie.

In the 1960s, Kaye became known as the host of a weekly children&#x27;s talent show, &quot;Stubby&#x27;s Silver Star Show&quot;. During the 1962–63 television season, he was a regular on &quot;Stump the Stars&quot;. On April 14, 1963, he guest-starred as &quot;Tubby Mason&quot; in NBC&#x27;s &quot;Ensign O&#x27;Toole&quot;, a comedy series, starring Dean Jones.

From 1964 to 1965, Kaye hosted the Saturday-morning children&#x27;s game show &quot;Shenanigans&quot; on ABC. Shenanigans was a children&#x27;s television game show produced by Heatter-Quigley Productions that aired from September 26, 1964, to March 20, 1965, and again from September 25 to December 18, 1965. He was dubbed &quot;the Mayor of Shenanigans&quot; and sang the theme song.

Kaye and Nat King Cole portrayed banjo-playing minstrels who sang the title song in the western/comedy &quot;Cat Ballou&quot; (1965), starring Jane Fonda and Lee Marvin. He played Herman in the Universal musical film &quot;Sweet Charity&quot; (1969), directed by Bob Fosse and starring Shirley MacLaine in the title role.

<doc id="778940" wikidata="Q580524" url="?curid=778940" title="Archery at the 1992 Summer Olympics">
<text>There were four different archery competitions at the 1992 Summer Olympics. The format of the previous Olympics was dropped for this Olympiad, with an entirely new system being put in place.

For the first time, all archery was done at a single distance, 70 metres. All archers took place in the ranking round, in which they shot 144 arrows. These scores were used to determine both individual and team ranks. The top 32 individual archers in each division (men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s) were seeded into a single-elimination tournament called the &quot;Olympic round&quot;. Nations that sent the maximum number of three archers in either or both division also had the chance for those three archers to compete as a team; the top 16 teams in each division were also seeded into single-elimination tournaments.

Winners of the semifinal in each of the four competitions faced each other for the gold and silver medals, while the semifinal losers faced off for the bronze medal and fourth place. All other rankings were determined by the score of the archer or team in the round they were defeated. That is, fifth through eighth place were determined by the quarterfinal scores of the four archers defeated in the quarterfinals.

<text>The W Broadway Local is a rapid transit service of the New York City Subway&#x27;s B Division. Its route emblem, or &quot;bullet&quot;, is colored since it uses the BMT Broadway Line in Manhattan.

The W operates weekdays during daytime hours only between Ditmars Boulevard in Astoria, Queens and Whitehall Street in Lower Manhattan, making all stops along the full route; limited rush hour service is extended beyond Whitehall Street to and from 86th Street in Gravesend, Brooklyn, making all stops in Brooklyn. The W is internally staffed and scheduled as part of the .

Introduced on July 22, 2001, the W originally ran at all times on the BMT West End Line and BMT Fourth Avenue Line in Brooklyn to Coney Island–Stillwell Avenue across the Manhattan Bridge, running express on the Broadway Line. It was truncated in 2004 to its current service pattern, running local on the Broadway Line to Whitehall Street until June 25, 2010, when it was eliminated due to the Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA)&#x27;s financial crisis. The route was later restored on November 7, 2016, using its original emblem and 2004–2010 routing, as part of the updated service pattern related to the opening of the Second Avenue Subway.

== Service history ==
===Context===
The W was originally conceived as an extra Broadway Line local service running on the Astoria and Broadway lines to Whitehall Street in Manhattan. This service was essentially a variant of the route, which in the 1970s and 1980s ran express on the Broadway Line between Forest Hills–71st Avenue in Queens and Coney Island–Stillwell Avenue in Brooklyn. At the time, some N trains (until 1976 designated EE) were designated with a diamond N bullet, ran local on Broadway, and traveled only between Forest Hills and Whitehall Street.

The Manhattan Bridge, between Manhattan and Brooklyn, contains four subway tracks: a northern pair for the IND Sixth Avenue Line and a southern pair for the BMT Broadway Line. Repairs to the bridge forced the N, which normally ran express on the Broadway Line and via the bridge, to run local via the Montague Street Tunnel starting in 1986. The south tracks were closed completely for repairs from 1988 to 2001. This service change precluded W local service from running as envisioned. The W bullet appeared on older roll signs as a yellow diamond bullet, while newer roll signs featured the modern round bullet. The W also appeared on the digital signs of the R44s and R46s with any route and destination combination that could be used for the Broadway Line.

The W label was first used in 2001, when the two tracks on the Manhattan Bridge&#x27;s northern side, which connected to the IND Sixth Avenue Line, were closed for repairs. This required the suspension of Sixth Avenue service south of 34th Street–Herald Square as it used those tracks to travel to and from Brooklyn. The W service replaced the B on the BMT West End Line and BMT Fourth Avenue Line in Brooklyn, ran on the BMT Broadway Line in Manhattan and BMT Astoria Line in Queens. It replicated the route of the Brooklyn-Manhattan Transit Corporation (BMT)&#x27;s old 3 route, later named the , that operated from 1916 until 1967, when the B replaced it. The W also replicated the split in B service from 1986 to 1988, when the bridge&#x27;s north tracks were first closed, although both halves of the route were labeled .

=== 2001–2004 ===
Plans for the W train were announced in late 2000, when the Metropolitan Transportation Authority announced that the Manhattan Bridge&#x27;s south tracks would reopen and that the north tracks would be closed. W service began on July 22, 2001. Service began operating between Coney Island and Astoria–Ditmars Boulevard, Queens, via the West End Local and Fourth Avenue Express in Brooklyn; the Manhattan Bridge south tracks; Broadway Express (switching to the local tracks to serve 49th Street) in Manhattan; and the 60th Street Tunnel and BMT Astoria Line in Queens. The W ran express on the Astoria Line during weekday daytime hours in the peak direction between 6a.m. and 9p.m., and local at all other times. Trains ran express to Manhattan between 6a.m. and 1p.m., and to Astoria from 1p.m. to 9p.m. Evening service terminated at 57th Street–Seventh Avenue in Manhattan (using the express tracks and bypassing 49th Street), while late night and weekend evening service operated as a shuttle within Brooklyn only, terminating at 36th Street during late nights and Atlantic Avenue–Pacific Street on weekends.

After September 11, 2001, all Broadway Line service in Lower Manhattan was suspended due to extensive damage caused by the collapse of the World Trade Center. As a result, the entire N route was suspended, and W trains ran at all times between Ditmars Boulevard and Coney Island. It made all stops except in Brooklyn north of 36th Street. During late nights, it ran in two sections: between Ditmars Boulevard and 34th Street, skipping 49th Street in the northbound direction, and in Brooklyn between 36th Street and Coney Island. Normal service on both routes resumed on October 28, 2001. With the December 16, 2001, timetable, two morning rush hour northbound trains terminated at 57th Street, and one evening rush hour train was put into service at 57th Street.

The Astoria express service was discontinued on January 15, 2002, because it was unpopular among Astoria residents. This change was approved by the MTA Board in December 2001. Express service was implemented on the Astoria Line in order to improve operations at the Ditmars Boulevard terminal, and because 43% of the line&#x27;s riders boarded at express stations. Instead, the change yielded no operational benefits, and made local N trains overcrowded, and express W trains underutilized. N trains carried 1.9 times as many passengers as W trains in the morning, and 2.6 times as many in the evening. W express service had been suspended after the September 11 attacks to replace N service. Even after normal service resumed in October 2001, local W service was kept until November 19 on a trial basis. Analysis of the operating pattern found that the terminal could handle the all-local service pattern and that the ridership split between the N and W was more balanced.

Around that time, evening service was extended from 57th Street to Astoria.

On September 8, 2002, W service was extended to Astoria during late nights and weekends, running fully local via the Fourth Avenue and Broadway Lines and Montague Street Tunnel. This was because ongoing reconstruction of the Coney Island–Stillwell Avenue terminal left the W as the only train serving it. This change also gave the West End Line late-night service to Manhattan for the first time since 1977.

On April 27, 2003, early evening weekend service was increased from running every 12 minutes to every 8 minutes, and Sunday morning and early evening service were increased to run every 8 minutes instead of every 10 minutes.

===2004–2010===
When the Manhattan Bridge&#x27;s north tracks were restored to service on February 22, 2004, the W was curtailed to its current service pattern, running weekdays only from 7:00 a.m. to 9:30 p.m. as an entirely local service between Astoria–Ditmars Boulevard and Whitehall Street–South Ferry, Lower Manhattan. The Brooklyn portion was replaced by the , which was extended over the north side of the bridge and down the West End Line. W service between Manhattan and Queens remained, because of increasing ridership on the BMT Astoria Line. The first three W trains of the day entered service at 86th Street in Gravesend, Brooklyn and the last three trains of the night continued in service to Kings Highway. These trips ran local in Brooklyn via the Montague Street Tunnel, BMT Fourth Avenue and BMT Sea Beach lines. On July 27, 2008, the W was extended to run until 11:00 p.m. in response to growth in the subway system&#x27;s ridership.

On March 24, 2010, the MTA announced the elimination of the W due to financial shortfalls. In its place, on weekdays, the train ran local north of Canal Street while the train was extended from 57th Street–Seventh Avenue to Astoria–Ditmars Boulevard, running local north of 34th Street–Herald Square. The W ceased operation on Friday, June 25, 2010, with the last train bound for Astoria–Ditmars Boulevard leaving Whitehall Street–South Ferry at 10:50 p.m.

=== 2015–present ===
In July 2015, the MTA announced it was considering restoring the W with its 2004–2010 service pattern following the opening of the first phase of the Second Avenue Subway, which would reroute the Q from the Astoria Line to 96th Street on Manhattan&#x27;s Upper East Side. The W would replace the Q on the Astoria Line to maintain two services on the line weekdays.

On May 23, 2016, the MTA announced it would restore the W. Service was restored on November 7, 2016, running between 7:00a.m. and 11:00p.m. The Q was temporarily cut back to 57th Street–Seventh Avenue, allowing for a seamless extension to the Second Avenue Line, which opened on January 1, 2017. Additionally, the N train again ran express in Manhattan on weekdays from 34th Street–Herald Square to Canal Street. The W&#x27;s restoration meant there would be 20 fewer trips to and from Astoria per weekday as the W ran for a shorter time span each day than the Q did. In June 2018, the MTA added service between 6:00a.m. and 7:00a.m., and between 11:00p.m. and midnight in response to overcrowded N trains during those hours. As the N and W share the same fleet from the Coney Island Yard, a small number of W trains originate or terminate at 86th Street throughout the day. These trains operate via the Montague Street Tunnel and local along the BMT Fourth Avenue Line and BMT Sea Beach Line as they did prior to 2010.

In July 2019, the MTA introduced a proposal to end late evening service. Instead, W service would once again end at around 9:30 PM. In their proposal, the MTA noted that service often ended early on weeknights to accommodate planned work.

In March 2020, the W was temporarily suspended due to lack of ridership and train crew availability caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, though full service was restored in June. On December 29, 2021, W service was again suspended due to a shortage of crew members exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic; service was again restored on January 24, 2022.

<doc id="778945" wikidata="Q715613" url="?curid=778945" title="William of Modena">
<text>William of Modena ( – 31 March 1251), also known as &quot;William of Sabina&quot;, &quot;Guglielmo de Chartreaux&quot;, &quot;Guglielmo de Savoy&quot;, &quot;Guillelmus&quot;, was an Italian clergyman and papal diplomat. He was frequently appointed a legate, or papal ambassador by the popes Honorius III and Gregory IX, especially in Livonia in the 1220s and in the Prussian questions of the 1240s. Eventually he resigned his see to devote himself to these diplomatic issues. On 28 May 1244 he was created Cardinal-Bishop of Sabina by Pope Innocent IV. For a short time (1219–1222) he served also as Vice-Chancellor of the Holy Roman Church.

==In Livonia==
Born in Piedmont and named bishop of Modena in May 1222, William was sent as Papal legate to resolve differences that resulted from the outcome of the Livonian Crusade in Livonia in 1225. The Prince Bishop Albert and the semi-monastic military Order, the Livonian Brothers of the Sword, the Teutonic crusaders and the Russians, all had claims, which were made more difficult by language barriers. William soon earned the confidence of all sides, arranging diplomatic compromises on boundaries, overlapping ecclesiastical and territorial jurisdictions, taxes, coinage, and other subjects, but he could not resolve the basic quarrel: who was to be master in Livonia. William sought to remove Estonia from contention by placing it directly under papal control, appointing his own vice-legate as governor, and by bringing in German knights as vassals. But the vice-legate subsequently turned the land over to the Brothers of the Sword. The &quot;Chronicle of Henry of Livonia&quot; one of the greatest medieval narratives, was written probably as a report for him, giving him the history of the Church in Livonia up to his time. It relates how in 1226, in the stronghold of Tarwanpe, William of Modena successfully mediated peace between Germans, Danes and Estonians.

==Intervention for the Stedingers==
Upon hearing of the situation in Stedingen, the Teutonic knights asked the Pope to intervene in order to avoid bloodshed. On 18 March 1234, in the letter &quot;Grandis et gravis&quot;, Gregory ordered his legate in Germany, William of Modena, to mediate the dispute between the Stedinger and the archbishop Gerhard II of Lippe. Since the conflict was not resolved before the spring campaign, either word of the pope&#x27;s decision did not reach the crusaders in time or the archbishop ignored it.

==The bishoprics of Prussia question==
Even while William was negotiating in Livonia, the conflicts were brewing that would occupy him two decades later. In the Crusades to conquer and Christianize Prussia at swordpoint, William of Modena found himself required to mediate between the rival claims and conflicting programs of Christian, the evangelizing first Bishop of Prussia, who, if he had been more successful, would have been sainted, as an &quot;Apostle to the Prussians,&quot; and the Knights of the Teutonic Order, to whom Christian and Duke Conrad of Masovia had pledged territorial properties. Before 1227, only Christian&#x27;s own Cistercian order had assisted him in fortified eastern missions; but with the arrival of the Teutonic Knights, the Dominicans, who were favored by the order and by Pope Gregory IX, took a strong foothold in Prussia, while Christian and his Cistercians were thrown into the background. William of Modena, who had been appointed papal legate for Prussia, disregarded the rights of Christian, who had the misfortune to be captured by the pagan Prussians and held for ransom (1233–39), and proceeded in his absence to appoint another Bishop of Prussia. In 1236, Gregory IX, apparently giving up on Christian, empowered William of Modena to divide Prussia into three dioceses. The bishops for these new sees were, in accordance with the wish of the Teutonic Order, to be selected from the Dominican Order, while no provision whatsoever was made for the imprisoned Bishop Christian.

Finally, in the winter of 1239–40, Christian obtained his liberty. He was obliged to give hostages whom he afterwards ransomed for a sum stated as no less than eight hundred marks, which was granted to him by Gregory. Immediately upon his liberation, Christian complained to the pope that the Teutonic Order refused baptism to those who desired it and oppressed the newly converted. More concrete charges concerned episcopal rights that they claimed and properties they refused to restore. The confrontation had not been settled when Gregory died (22 August 1241). Christian and the Teutonic Order then agreed that two thirds of the conquered territory in Prussia should belong to the Order, to form a Teutonic Order state, and one-third to the bishop; that, moreover, the bishop should have the right to exercise ecclesiastical functions in the territory belonging to the Order.

William of Modena did not give up his plans of dividing Prussia into dioceses instead of empowering a vast territorial knightly order. He finally obtained from Pope Innocent IV permission to make a division, and on 29 July 1243, the Bishopric of Prussia was divided into four dioceses:

In 1243 the territorial possessions of the Teutonic Knights were divided into the Dioceses of Culm, Pomesania, Ermland, and Samland.

*Bishopric of Culm Culm,
*Bishopric of Pomesania Pomesania,

==An embassy to Frederick II==
In the meantime William had been at Rome. When Celestine IV died after a short reign of sixteen days, the excommunicated Hohenstaufen emperor, Frederick II, was in possession of the Papal States of the Church around Rome and attempted to intimidate the cardinals into electing a pope to his own liking. The cardinals fled to Anagni and cast their votes for Sinibaldo de&#x27; Fieschi, who ascended to the papal throne as Innocent IV on 25 June 1243, after an interregnum of more than a year and a half. Innocent IV had previously been a friend of Frederick II. Immediately after the election the emperor sent messengers with congratulations and overtures of peace, which Innocent refused to receive. Two months later he sent emissaries including Peter de Colmieu, Archbishop of Rouen, William of Modena, who had resigned his episcopal office, and Abbot William of St. Facundus as legates to the emperor at Melfi with instructions to ask him to release the prelates whom he had captured while on their way to a council that Gregory IX had intended to hold at Rome and challenge the emperor to make satisfaction for the injuries which he had inflicted upon the Church, which had caused Gregory IX to put him under the ban of excommunication. Should the emperor deny that he had done any wrong to the Church, or even assert the injustice of the Church, the legates were to propose that the decision should be left to a council of kings, prelates, and temporal princes. Frederick entered into an agreement with Innocent on 31 March 1244. He promised to yield to the demands of the Curia in all essential points, to restore the States of the Church, to release the prelates, and to grant amnesty to the allies of the pope. His insincerity became apparent when he secretly incited various tumults in Rome and refused to release the imprisoned prelates.

Feeling himself hindered in his freedom of action on account of the emperor&#x27;s military preponderance, and fearing for his personal safety, Innocent decided to flee Sutri in disguise for Civitavecchia and board a fleet provided by the sympathetic Genoese. During the night of 27–28 June he made his escape to Genoa. In October he went to Burgundy, and in December to Lyons, where he remained in exile the following six years. He died in Lyons.

== Resting place ==
William of Modena was &quot;buried in the church of the Dominicans&quot; in Lyon., possibly the église Notre-Dame-de-Confort.

<text>Syburi (; , meaning &quot;City of the Banyan&quot;) is the name for the Malay state of Kedah returned to Thailand when the Japanese occupied British Malaya during World War II.

==History==

General Plaek Phibunsongkhram signed a secret agreement with the Japanese Empire on 14 December 1941 and committed the Thai armed forces to participate in the planned Malayan Campaign and Burma Campaign. An alliance between Thailand and Japan was formally signed on 21 December 1941. On 25 January 1942, the Thai government, believing the Allies beaten, declared war on the United States and the United Kingdom. As a reward for entering into a military alliance with the Japanese, the latter agreed to return to Thailand the four Malayan provinces ceded to the British in 1909, Kedah, Perlis, Kelantan, and Terengganu, as well as parts of Shan State in British Burma.
In July 1943, Japanese Prime Minister Hideki Tojo announced that Kedah (along with Perlis, Kelantan and Terengganu) were to be returned to Thailand as part of the military alliance signed between Thailand and Japan on 21 December 1941. 

From 18 October 1943 until the surrender of the Japanese at the end of the war, Kelantan, Terengganu, Kedah and Perlis were under Thai administration. On 2 September 1945, Kedah and the three other states were returned to the British.

People from Syburi have interacted with people from Phuket and Nakhon Si Thammarat and the result has been a number of marriages between Buddhists and Muslims.

==Administration==
Administrative services were carried out by Thai civil servants who were under military supervision. The Japanese authorities retained a great degree of control.

<doc id="778953" wikidata="Q7495165" url="?curid=778953" title="Peninsular Japonic">
<text>The Peninsular Japonic languages are now-extinct Japonic languages reflected in ancient placenames and glosses from central and southern parts of the Korean Peninsula.
Most linguists believe that Japonic arrived in the Japanese archipelago from the Korean peninsula during the first millennium BCE.
The placename evidence suggests that Japonic languages were still spoken in parts of the peninsula for several centuries before being replaced by the spread of Korean.

The most-cited evidence comes from chapter 37 of the (compiled in 1145), which contains a list of pronunciations and meanings of placenames in the former kingdom of Goguryeo. As the pronunciations are given using Chinese characters, they are difficult to interpret, but several of those from central Korea, in the area south of the Han River captured from Baekje in the 5th century, seem to correspond to Japonic words. Scholars differ on whether they represent the language of Goguryeo or the people that it conquered.

Chinese and Korean texts also contain very sparse traces from the states in the south of the peninsula, and from the former Tamna kingdom on Jeju Island.

== Placename glosses in the &quot;Samguk sagi&quot; ==
The is a history, written in Classical Chinese, of the Korean Three Kingdoms period, which ended in 668. Chapter 37 gives place names and meanings, mostly for places in the Goguryeo lands seized by Silla. These glosses were first studied by Naitō Torajirō in 1907, with substantial analysis beginning with a series of articles by Lee Ki-Moon in the 1960s.

For example, the following entry refers to the city now known as Suwon:

That is, the characters are used to record the sound of the name, while the characters represent its meaning. From this, we infer that 買 and 忽 represent the pronunciations of local words for &#x27;water&#x27; and &#x27;city&#x27; respectively. In this way, a vocabulary of 80 to 100 words has been extracted from these place names. Characters like and presumably represented pronunciations based on some local version of the Chinese reading tradition, but there is no agreement on what this sounded like. One approximation is to use the Middle Chinese reading pronunciations recorded in such dictionaries as the &quot;Qieyun&quot; (compiled in 601), in which is pronounced . Another uses the Sino-Korean readings of 15th century dictionaries of Middle Korean, yielding a pronunciation of for the same character. In some cases, the same word is represented by several characters with similar pronunciations.

Several of the words extracted from these names resemble Korean or Tungusic languages. Others, including all four of the attested numerals, resemble Japonic languages, and are accepted by most authors as evidence that now-extinct relatives of Japonic were once spoken on the Korean peninsula.

The first authors to study these words assumed that, because these place names came from the territory of Goguryeo, they must have represented the language of that state. Lee and Ramsey offer the additional argument that the dual use of Chinese characters to represent the sound and meaning of the place names must have been done by scribes of Goguryeo, which would have borrowed written Chinese earlier than the southern kingdoms. They argue that the Goguryeo language formed a link between Japanese, Korean and Tungusic.

Christopher I. Beckwith, applying his own Middle Chinese readings, claims that almost all of the words have Japonic cognates. He takes this as the language of Goguryeo, which he considers a relative of Japanese in a family he calls Japanese-Koguryoic. He suggests that the family was located in western Liaoning in the 4th century BC, with one group (identified with the Yayoi culture) travelling by sea to southern Korea and Kyushu, others migrating into eastern Manchuria and northern Korea, and others by sea to the Ryukyu Islands. In a review for &quot;Korean Studies&quot;, Thomas Pellard criticizes Beckwith&#x27;s linguistic analysis for the &quot;ad hoc&quot; nature of his Chinese reconstructions, for his handling of Japonic material and for hasty rejection of possible cognates in other languages. Another review by historian Mark Byington casts doubt on Beckwith&#x27;s interpretation of the documentary references on which his migration theory is based.

Other authors point out that none of the placenames with proposed Japonic cognates are located in the historical homeland of Goguryeo north of the Taedong River, and no Japonic morphemes have been identified in inscriptions from the area, such as the Gwanggaeto Stele. The glossed place names of the &quot;Samguk sagi&quot; generally come from central Korea, in an area captured by Goguryeo from Baekje and other states in the 5th century, and suggest that the place names reflect the languages of those states rather than that of Goguryeo. This would explain why they seem to reflect multiple language groups. Kōno Rokurō and Kim Bang-han have argued for bilingualism in Baekje, with the placenames reflecting the language of the common people.

== Other evidence ==
Several authors have suggested that the sole recorded word of the Gaya confederacy is Japonic. Alexander Vovin has suggested Japonic etymologies for several words and placenames from southern Korea appearing in ancient Chinese and Korean texts.

As noted above, several authors believe that the glossed placenames of the &quot;Samguk sagi&quot; reflect an early language of Baekje. In addition, chapter 54 of the &quot;Book of Liang&quot; (635) gives four Baekje words, two of which may be compared to Japonic:
* &#x27;ruling fortress&#x27; vs Old Japanese &#x27;to put inside&#x27;
* &#x27;settlement&#x27; vs Old Japanese &#x27;house&#x27; and &#x27;circle&#x27;

=== Silla ===
Some words from Silla and its predecessor Jinhan are recorded by Chinese historians in chapter 30 of &quot;Wei Zhi&quot; in &quot;Records of the Three Kingdoms&quot; (3rd century) and chapter 54 of the &quot;Book of Liang&quot; (completed in 635). Many of these words appear to be Korean, but a few match Japonic forms, e.g. &quot;mura&quot; () &#x27;settlement&#x27; vs Old Japanese &#x27;village&#x27;.

Chapter 34 of the &quot;Samguk sagi&quot; gives former place names in Silla and the standardized two-character Sino-Korean names assigned under King Gyeongdeok in the 8th century.
Many of the pre-reform names cannot be given Korean derivations, but are explicable as Japonic words. For example, several of them contain an element &quot;miti&quot; (), which resembles Old Japanese &#x27;way, road&#x27;.

=== Byeonhan/Gaya ===
The Chinese &quot;Records of the Three Kingdoms&quot; (3rd century) gives phonographic transcriptions in Chinese characters of names of 12 settlements in the Byeonhan confederacy in southern Korea. Two of these include a suffix , which has been compared with Late Middle Korean and Proto-Japonic *, both meaning &#x27;base, bottom&#x27; and claimed by Samuel Martin to be cognate. The name Mioyama has a suffix , which is commonly identified with Proto-Japonic &#x27;mountain&#x27;.

The Gaya confederacy, which succeeded Byeonhan, maintained trading relations with Japan, until it was overrun by Silla in the early 6th century. A single word is explicitly attributed to the Gaya language, in chapter 44 of the &quot;Samguk sagi&quot;:

Because the character was used to transcribe the Silla word ancestral to Middle Korean &#x27;ridge&#x27;, philologists have inferred that the Gaya word for &#x27;gate&#x27; had a similar pronunciation. This word has been compared with the Old Japanese word &#x27;gate, door&#x27;.

=== Tamna ===
Chapter 81 of the Chinese &quot;Book of Sui&quot; (656) mentions (), an earlier form of the name of the kingdom of Tamna on Jeju Island. Vovin suggests that this name may have a Japonic etymology &#x27;valley settlement&#x27; or &#x27;people&#x27;s settlement&#x27;.

A village in southwestern Jeju called Gamsan (/kamsan/ &#x27;persimmon mountain&#x27;) has an old name &#x27;deity mountain&#x27;. The first character of the place name () cannot be read as / in Korean, but Vovin suggests that the first syllable was originally a word cognate to Old Japanese &#x27;deity&#x27;.

The Jeju language is Koreanic, but may have a Japonic substratum. For example, the colloquial word &#x27;mouth&#x27; may be connected to the Japonic word &#x27;mouth&#x27;.

== Proposed archaeological links ==
Most linguists studying the Japonic family believe that it was brought to the Japanese archipelago from the Korean peninsula around 700–300 BCE by wet-rice farmers of the Yayoi culture. John Whitman and Kazuo Miyamoto associate Japonic on the Korean peninsula with the Mumun culture, which introduced wet-rice agriculture around 1500 BCE. In addition to rice, the onset of the Yayoi culture in northern Kyushu saw the introduction and adaptation of many cultural features from the Mumun culture, including types of housing, pottery and tools. Archaeologists believe this reflects a combination of diffusion, migration from the peninsula, and hybridisation within the archipelago.

Whitman further suggests that Koreanic arrived in the peninsula from the north with the Liaoning bronze dagger culture about 300 BCE. Vovin and James Marshall Unger propose similar models, but associate Koreanic with iron-using mounted warriors from Manchuria. In contrast, Juha Janhunen argues that Koreanic expanded from Silla in the southeast, replacing Japonic languages in Baekje and the rest of the peninsula.

<text>H. Lundbeck A/S, commonly referred to as Lundbeck, is a Danish international pharmaceutical company engaged in the research, development, manufacturing, marketing and sale of pharmaceuticals across the world. The company’s products are targeted at brain diseases, including depression, schizophrenia, Alzheimer&#x27;s disease, Parkinson&#x27;s disease and migraine.

Headquartered in Copenhagen, Denmark, Lundbeck has approximately 5,600 employees in more than 50 countries, and their products are registered in more than 100 countries. They have production facilities in Denmark, France and Italy and their research centers are based in Denmark and the US.

Lundbeck is listed on the Copenhagen Stock Exchange (CSE).

Lundbeck is a full member of the European Federation of Pharmaceutical Industries and Associations (EFPIA) and of the International Federation of Pharmaceutical Manufacturers and Associations (IFPMA)

==History==
The company was founded by Hans Lundbeck in 1915, and was initially a trading company supplying a variety of goods to the Danish market, including machinery for manufacturing, aluminium foil, artificial sweeteners, and photographic equipment.

Lundbeck entered the pharmaceutical market in 1924, importing medicines and cosmetics from companies based in other European and American countries. By the late 1930s, Lundbeck had begun to produce its own medicinal products and had established its own research department. Production continued during the Second World War, although it was limited due to a lack of raw materials.

After the war, Lundbeck continued to grow and in 1957 the company introduced Truxal (chlorprothixene) for the treatment of schizophrenia, entering the market for brain disorders. In 1954, the Lundbeck Foundation was established to maintain and expand the activities of Lundbeck Group and also to provide funding for scientific research of the highest quality.
From the late 1970s, and up through the 1980s, Lundbeck diverted its old agency business and thus became a dedicated pharmaceutical company focusing on the production of drugs used to treat disorders and diseases of the central nervous system.
In 1989, Lundbeck launched the antidepressant Celexa (citalopram), which became the cornerstone for the company&#x27;s international expansion and in 2009, Lundbeck, bought Ovation and established a commercial platform in the USA.

In 2012, to focus on newer, strategic CNS-products, Lundbeck sold a portfolio of non-core products to Recordati S.p.A. (Recordati Rare Diseases). In 2014 Lundbeck acquired Chelsea Therapeutics for up to $658 million.

In March 2018, the company acquired Prexton Therapeutics for up to €905 million ($1.1 billion)

In June 2018, the former Millennium Pharmaceuticals CEO, Deborah Dunsire, was named the new CEO of Lundbeck.

In September 2019, Lundbeck announced it would acquire Alder BioPharmaceuticals $18 per share, valuing Alder at almost $2 billion.

In June 2023, Charl van Zyl, head of neurology solutions at UCB, has announced as the next CEO and President to succeed Dunsire.

In October 2024, Lundbeck agreed to acquire American epilepsy drug maker Longboard Pharmaceuticals for $2.6 billion.

==Controversy==
Lundbeck formerly held the only license to manufacture pentobarbital (Nembutal) in the United States. The drug is commonly used for execution by lethal injection in the United States (either as part of a three drug cocktail or by itself). After coming under criticism for not adding an ‘end user’ agreement to prevent importers from selling Nembutal to American prisons for use in executions, Lundbeck announced that it would not sell Nembutal to prisons in U.S. states that carry out executions. By introducing a new distribution system, Nembutal will be supplied exclusively through a specialty pharmacy drop ship program that will deny distribution of the product to prisons in U.S. states currently active in carrying out the death penalty by lethal injection.
 In December 2011, Lundbeck divested a portfolio of products including Nembutal to US pharmaceutical company Akorn Inc. As part of the agreement, Akorn committed to continue with Lundbeck&#x27;s restricted distribution program for Nembutal, which was implemented to restrict the use of the product in the US. Since 2012, US prisons have reported a serious shortage of Nembutal.

==2013 fine==
On June 19, 2013, the European Commission imposed a fine of €93.8 million on Lundbeck and fined several producers of generic pharmaceuticals a total of €52.2 million after Lundbeck made agreements in 2002 with the other companies to delay less expensive generics of Lundbeck&#x27;s citalopram from entering the market. In return for the ability to maintain a monopoly on the drug&#x27;s manufacture, Lundbeck offered payments and other kickbacks.

&quot;Whistle!&quot; is about a middle school boy named Shō Kazamatsuri. He transfers from Musashinomori School to Sakura Jōsui Junior High School for better hopes to make the soccer team, since he never got a game at his old school due to his small stature. Yūko Katori, his teacher, introduces him as a former star of the famed Musashinomori team, causing his classmates to be wrongly ecstatic. Right after that, one of the players, Tatsuya Mizuno, reveals that he was never a regular. In other words, since he never got the chance to play, Shō is a poor player. Shō struggles to improve his skill so he can make the team at his new school and to ignore the drastic disadvantage he has due to his height.

==Reception==
The &quot;Whistle!&quot; series has received good reception. A review by Greg McElhatton of Read About Comics stated that the &quot;Whistle!&quot; manga had good drawings that showed the characters move around with the soccer ball during matches. David Welsh of Precocious Curmudgeon said the series is very interesting that those who do not have soccer background will enjoy reading the manga, as well as with the realistic illustration used.

Scott Campbell and Holly Ellingwood of Active Anime have remarked that the art is clear since all the &quot;line and detail has obvious care and attention given to it, resulting in well-managed visuals for a well-flowing read.&quot;, while praising Sho&#x27;s character development as the readers &quot;see him strive against so much to obtain what he worked for is uplifting.&quot; Eduardo M. Chavez&#x27;s review on &quot;Whistle!&quot; Volume 1 noted that although it does not look good for characters to run away from their problems, Sho&#x27;s inner determination to play soccer is the main highlight of the series.

<doc id="778974" wikidata="Q5196143" url="?curid=778974" title="Curzon Park Abbey">
<text>Curzon Park Abbey is one of three monasteries of nuns in the English Benedictine Congregation.

==History==
It began as an Anglican Benedictine convent at Feltham, Middlesex, founded by Father Ignatius on 24 June 1868. Feltham Priory, or Feltham Nunnery, was dedicated to Saints Mary and Scholastica (twin sister of St Benedict).

The community spent 5 years in Feltham before moving to Twickenham, West Malling and Milford Haven before settling in Talacre, North Wales in 1920, having been received into the Roman Catholic Church in 1913. In 1921, the nuns were accepted as members of the English Benedictine Congregation, thus inheriting a venerable tradition and a more deeply rooted Catholic identity. The changes heralded by Vatican II 
led to an increasing simplification in the style of monastic life. The present Community is responding to the call for renewal within the Church, and finding an authentic role in society today.

In July 1988 the community of nuns moved to a much smaller property in Curzon Park, Chester, where they also have a small retreat house. The main Abbey building is a converted late 19th Century mansion constructed mainly of red brick. A chapel was built on the Curzon Park Abbey site in 1997.

<doc id="778979" wikidata="Q4283795" url="?curid=778979" title="1971 Atlantic hurricane season">
<text>The 1971 Atlantic hurricane season was an active Atlantic hurricane season overall, producing 13 named storms (including a nameable system that went unnamed), of which 6 strengthened into hurricanes. The season officially began on June 1, 1971, and lasted until November 30, 1971. These dates conventionally delimit the period of each year when most tropical cyclones form in the Atlantic basin. This season, the first storm, Arlene, developed on July 4, while the last, Laura, dissipated on November 22.

Activity was steady through most of the season. Hurricane Edith was its strongest system, reaching Category 5 on the Saffir–Simpson scale. It struck Nicaragua at peak intensity, killing dozens, and later hit southern Louisiana. Hurricane Ginger was its longest-lived system, lasting 27 days from early September to early October, setting a record for the longest known duration of a North Atlantic tropical cyclone (not surpassed until 2003). Ginger moved ashore in North Carolina, producing heavy rains and damaging winds. An unnamed storm in August attained hurricane status further north than any other Atlantic hurricane on record. On September 11–12, there were five active Atlantic tropical cyclones at one time. Despite the activity, damage in the United States totaled about $235 million (1971 USD$,  USD), which National Hurricane Center forecaster Paul Hebert noted was &quot;pretty small considering we had five storms in a row strike the U.S.&quot; Most of the damage came from Tropical Storm Doria, which affected much of the East Coast of the United States. Hurricane Fern struck Texas after executing an unusual track, dropping heavy rainfall and producing flooding.


== Systems ==
=== Tropical Storm Arlene ===

The origins of Arlene were from a cold front that exited the East Coast of the United States on July 2 and stalled offshore. A frontal wave developed the next day, steadily developing due to thermal instability. On July 4, the system organized into a tropical depression about 120 mi (195 km) southeast of Cape Hatteras, North Carolina. While in its formative stages, it dropped rainfall along the coast of the Carolinas, peaking at in Pinopolis, South Carolina. The depression tracked northeastward due to a ridge over New England, and the cyclone passed just southeast of the Outer Banks. After a Hurricane Hunters plane observed gale-force winds, the depression was upgraded to Tropical Storm Arlene late on July 5; in the post-season summary, meteorologist Neil Frank noted, &quot;the surprising element in the development of Arlene was the rapidity of the transformation process.&quot;

Upon being named, Arlene continued northeastward, possessing a circular mass of convection with spiral rainbands. Late on July 6, the storm attained peak winds of 65 mph (100 km/h), based on a ship report. It weakened thereafter, and Arlene transitioned into an extratropical cyclone late on July 7 just south of Newfoundland. The cyclone last observed early the following day. The storm capsized a boat in the Grand Banks of Newfoundland, and the crew of 12 was rescued.
=== Unnamed hurricane ===

A hybrid-type depression formed east of Bermuda on July 29. It moved rapidly southwestward before turning to a northwest drift. On August 3, it was classified as a tropical depression, and the next day the system passed near Bermuda. The depression accelerated to the northeast, strengthening into a tropical storm on August 5. It intensified further due to baroclinity, or enhanced instability through different levels of the atmosphere caused by temperature and moisture gradients. On August 6, a drilling rig about southeast of Newfoundland recorded sustained winds of with gusts to 126 mph (204 km/h) at an altitude of ; this suggested the storm attained hurricane status at 46° North, which is the northernmost location for a tropical storm to intensify into a hurricane.

Despite the intensity, the cyclone was not purely tropical; although the radius of maximum winds was only , the thermal structure did not resemble a tropical cyclone, and there was no precipitation or convection near the center. It continued northeastward and dissipated on August 7 to the southwest of Greenland. It was not named operationally, but it was later added to the Atlantic hurricane database.
=== Hurricane Beth ===
On August 9, an upper-level low developed off the coast of Florida, and the next day spawned a tropical depression. The newly developed cyclone tracked slowly northeastward, eventually encountering conditions favorable for development. On August 14, the depression intensified into Tropical Storm Beth off the coast of North Carolina, and it quickly strengthened into a hurricane by August 15. After reaching peak winds of off the coast of Cape Cod, Beth slightly weakened and later moved ashore near Copper Lake, Nova Scotia. Shortly thereafter, Beth was swept up by a nearby cold front and transitioned into an extratropical cyclone.

The hurricane left extensive damage in its wake, especially to crops and infrastructure. Halifax International Airport reported 10.49 in (266 mm) of rainfall in a 30‑hour span, which caused widespread flooding. Several bridges in the region were washed out, while railways were covered by water, forcing trains to suspend their operation. Overall monetary damage from Beth is estimated up to $5.1 million (1971 USD$,  USD). One person was indirectly killed by the hurricane in a traffic accident induced by heavy rainfall.
=== Tropical Depression Seven ===

On August 12, a tropical depression developed southwest of Fort Myers, Florida. It quickly moved ashore, reaching Lake Okeechobee before looping to the northwest. While moving across the state, it dropped heavy rainfall of around along the west coast. In Pinellas Park, the heavy rains led to flash flooding that forced 200 families from their house, including one that required evacuation from a helicopter. Damage in the region was estimated at $250,000 (1971 USD$,  USD).

The depression emerged into the Gulf of Mexico on August 15 near Tampa, and later turned to the northeast ahead of an upper-level low. On August 16, it intensified as it moved ashore near Cedar Key, where hurricane-force wind gusts were briefly observed. The depression dissipated on August 17 over South Carolina, although in that state it produced its heaviest rainfall, totaling in Sullivan&#x27;s Island. In nearby Savannah, Georgia, the rainfall forced about 100 families from their houses in low-lying areas. The remnants continued northeastward through the Mid-Atlantic States and New England, crossing into Canada on August 20.
=== Tropical Storm Chloe ===

A tropical wave moved off the coast of Africa on August 13, moving westward for several days before organizing into a tropical depression on August 18 about east of Barbados. It quickly moved through the Lesser Antilles, where it produced wind gusts up to . The cyclone also dropped heavy rainfall up to on Barbados and Martinique. After entering the eastern Caribbean Sea, the depression intensified into Tropical Storm Chloe on August 20. About 18 hours after attaining tropical storm status, Chloe quickly strengthened to peak winds of about 215 mi (345 km) south of the Mona Passage, as reported by reconnaissance aircraft.

After reaching peak intensity, Chloe began weakening as it turned to the west-southwest, and late on August 22, it was downgraded to a tropical depression as a weakening ridge to its north cut off the low-level inflow. For several days it continued generally westward, gradually losing organization. While passing south of Jamaica, the storm prompted the evacuation of the SS Hope, a hospital ship, at Kingston. On August 25, Chloe moved ashore in Belize as a weak tropical depression, and dissipated shortly thereafter without ever having caused significant damage or deaths. The remnants of Chloe later spawned Hurricane Lily in the eastern Pacific Ocean.
=== Tropical Storm Doria ===
Tropical Storm Doria, the costliest storm of the season, developed from a tropical wave on August 20 to the east of the Lesser Antilles, and after five days without development attained tropical storm status to the east of Florida. Doria turned to the north, and reached peak winds of 65 mph (105 km/h) as it was making landfall near Morehead City, North Carolina. It turned to the northeast, and moved through the Mid-Atlantic and New England as a tropical storm before becoming an extratropical storm over Maine on August 29.

In North Carolina, Doria produced moderate rainfall, resulting in localized flooding and damage. The storm spawned a tornado near Norfolk, Virginia, damaging twelve houses and downing hundreds of trees. Tropical Storm Doria dropped heavy precipitation in New Jersey, peaking at 10.29 in (261 mm) in Little Falls. The rainfall led to record-breaking river levels and flooding in several houses, resulting in damage to dozens of houses across the state. Moderate damage and rainfall continued along its path into New England and southeastern Canada. In all, Tropical Storm Doria caused seven deaths and $147.6 million (1971 USD$,  USD).
=== Hurricane Fern ===
Hurricane Fern was the first of four tropical systems to develop in association with an extended surface trough across the Gulf of Mexico into the open Atlantic, along with Ginger, Heidi, and a strong tropical depression. Fern developed on September 3 in the central Gulf of Mexico. It moved over southern Louisiana the next day, but due to increased ridging to the north the depression moved southwestward back over water. On September 7, the depression intensified into Tropical Storm Fern; it is rare for a tropical depression to move over land in the continental United States (excluding Florida) and later attain tropical storm status. Fern later turned to the northwest, intensifying into a hurricane on September 8. It quickly reached peak winds of , but later weakened as it curved to the southwest, moving ashore on September 10 between Freeport and Matagorda, Texas as a tropical storm. Fern dissipated on September 13 over northeastern Mexico.

The precursor of Fern dropped rainfall up to of rainfall across South Florida, while totals of up to were reported in southeastern Louisiana where it made its first landfall. As it struck Texas, Fern produced strong winds up to , along with storm tides and heavy rainfall; the highest precipitation total was in Beeville. The heavy rainfall caused severe flash flooding that isolated numerous small towns in the southeastern portion of the state, damaging 7,500 buildings. In all, Fern left two indirect deaths and moderate damage totaling $30.2 million (1971 USD$,  USD).
=== Hurricane Edith ===
Hurricane Edith, the strongest storm of the season, developed from a tropical wave on September 5 to the east of the southern Lesser Antilles. It moved quickly across the southern Caribbean Sea, intensifying into a hurricane just off the north coast of South America. Edith rapidly intensified on September 9 and made landfall on Cape Gracias a Dios as a Category 5 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale. It quickly lost intensity over Central America and after briefly entering the Gulf of Honduras it crossed the Yucatán Peninsula in Mexico. After moving across the Gulf of Mexico, a trough turned the storm to the northeast and Edith, after having restrengthened while accelerating towards the coast, made landfall on Louisiana with winds of 105 mph (170 km/h) on September 16. Edith steadily weakened over land and dissipated over Georgia on September 18.

The hurricane killed two people when it passed near Aruba. Striking northeastern Central America as a Category 5 hurricane, Edith destroyed hundreds of homes and killed at least 35 people. In Texas high tides caused coastal flooding but little damage. Edith caused moderate to heavy damage in portions of Louisiana due to flooding and a tornado outbreak from the storm. One tornado, rated F3 on the Fujita Scale, damaged several homes and injured multiple people in Baton Rouge. The tornado outbreak extended eastward into Florida. Damage in the United States totaled $25 million (1971 USD$,  USD).
=== Hurricane Ginger ===
Hurricane Ginger was thought to be the longest lasting Atlantic hurricane on record until 2003, when the 1899 San Ciriaco hurricane was retroactively found to have lasted longer. The eighth tropical cyclone and fifth hurricane of the season, Ginger spent 27.25 days as a tropical cyclone, and lasted from September 6 to October 3. The storm developed in a large region of convection across the Gulf of Mexico and western Atlantic, and for the first nine days of its duration tracked generally east- or northeastward while gradually strengthening to peak winds of 110 mph (175 km/h). On September 14 Ginger slowed and turned to a general westward track, passing near Bermuda on September 23; there, the hurricane produced gusty winds and high waves, but no damage.

While over the western Atlantic Ocean, Ginger became the last target of Project Stormfury, which sought to weaken hurricanes by depositing silver iodide into tropical cyclone rainbands. The plane dropped silver iodide into the center of Ginger, although there was no effect due to Ginger&#x27;s large eye and diffuse nature; Ginger was the last seeding done by the project. Ginger ultimately struck North Carolina on September 30 as a minimal hurricane, lashing the coastline with gusty winds that caused power outages across the region. Heavy rainfall flooded towns and left heavy crop damage, with 3 million bushels of corn and 1 million bushels of soybean lost. Damage in the state was estimated at $10 million (1971 USD$,  USD). Further north, moderate rainfall and winds spread through the Mid-Atlantic states, although no significant damage was reported outside of North Carolina.
=== Tropical Storm Heidi ===

Tropical Storm Heidi was the last of the four tropical systems to develop from the extended surface trough of low pressure, forming on September 11 northeast of the Bahamas and intensifying into a tropical storm the next day. After initially moving to the northwest, Heidi curved northeastward and attained its peak intensity of 65 mph (100 km/h) on September 14 off the coast of Virginia. The storm failed to become a well-organized system, and it gradually weakened while accelerating north-northeastward. On September 15, shortly after Heidi moved ashore in Maine, it was absorbed by a broad extratropical cyclone over the northern Appalachians.

Heidi did not directly cause any fatalities or severe damage. However, the larger extratropical storm drew in moisture from Heidi, producing rainfall from North Carolina through northern New England, including a peak of in southeastern Pennsylvania. The heavy rains triggered extensive flooding that caused over a dozen fatalities and left thousands of residents homeless in Pennsylvania and New Jersey. In Chester, Pennsylvania a stone dam collapsed, forcing hundreds of families to evacuate and damaging homes, businesses, roads, and bridges. Governor Milton Shapp declared a state of emergency in several Pennsylvania counties following the floods.
=== Hurricane Irene ===
A tropical wave spawned a tropical depression on September 11 about 800 mi (1300 km) east of the Windward Islands. The cyclone tracked nearly due westward at a low latitude, passing through the southern Windward Islands and later over northern South America. In the southwest Caribbean Sea, it intensified to a tropical storm and later a hurricane. Irene made landfall on southeastern Nicaragua on September 19, and maintained its circulation as it crossed the low-lying terrain of the country. Restrengthening after reaching the Pacific, Irene was renamed Hurricane Olivia, which ultimately attained peak winds of 115 mph (185 km/h) before weakening and dissipating over northwestern Mexico.

In the Atlantic, Irene produced moderate rainfall and winds along its path, although impact was greatest in Nicaragua where it moved ashore as a hurricane. A total of 96 homes were destroyed, and 1,200 people were left homeless. The rainfall resulted in widespread flooding, killing three people in Rivas. In neighboring Costa Rica, Hurricane Irene caused more than $1 million (1971 USD$,  USD) in damage to the banana crop. The hurricane was the first actively tracked tropical cyclone that moved into the eastern Pacific Ocean from the Atlantic Ocean.
=== Tropical Storm Janice ===

The origins of Janice were from a tropical wave that moved off the coast of Africa on September 18. It developed into a tropical depression on September 21 about 1050 mi (1700 km) west-southwest of Cape Verde, which was the easternmost formation of the named storms this season. The next day, the depression intensified into Tropical Storm Janice, and quickly reached peak winds of . The storm never became well-organized, with its peak winds located east of the broad center. Despite being in a climatologically favored region for further development, Janice weakened due to increased wind shear from Hurricane Ginger. The circulation became elongated and separated from the convection, and on September 24 the storm weakened to a tropical depression. Later that day Janice dissipated just northeast of the Lesser Antilles as it was absorbed by Ginger. Around that time, it produced rainfall in the northeastern Caribbean, reaching on Saint Kitts; no damage or fatalities were reported.
=== Tropical Storm Kristy ===

The interaction between a tropical wave and an upper-level trough led to the development of a tropical depression on October 18, about 685 mi (1100 km) northeast of Puerto Rico. It moved quickly north-northeastward, followed by a curve to the northeast. On October 20, a ship reported winds of , indicating the depression intensified into Tropical Storm Kristy. As it reached this strength, an approaching cold front produced cooler, drier air over the storm. Kristy intensified slightly further to peak winds of 50 mph (85 km/h) before becoming indistinguishable from the cold front. By October 21 it transitioned into an extratropical cyclone before dissipating near the Azores.
=== Tropical Storm Laura ===
The final storm of the season, Laura, formed on November 12 in the western Caribbean Sea, and reached winds of 70 mph (120 km/h) as it approached western Cuba. Across the island, the storm produced heavy rainfall, peaking at 32.5 in (830 mm). The resulting flooding killed one person and caused crop damage, and also forced 26,000 people to evacuate their homes.&lt;ref name=&quot;TEI 11/19&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Initially, Laura was forecast to move across the island and impact the southern United States, but it executed a small loop and turned to the southwest. The storm moved ashore on Belize, one of only four November storms to affect the country. Little impact occurred during Laura&#x27;s final landfall, and it dissipated on November 22 over central Guatemala.
=== Other systems ===

In addition to the named storms and otherwise notable cyclones, there were several weak depressions during the season. After a June devoid of activity, three tropical depressions developed within the first ten days of July. The first became Tropical Storm Arlene on July 4, and the second formed off the coast of Louisiana on July 6. Tropical Depression Two moved westward due to a ridge to its northeast, and it struck just west of the Texas-Louisiana border before dissipating on July 8. Its precursor dropped near Carrabelle, Florida, but much less along its path. Just two days later, another tropical depression formed in the northwestern Gulf of Mexico, quickly moving ashore in southern Texas before dissipating on July 11; it dropped light rainfall along its path.

In August, there were two tropical depressions, in addition to the named storms and the notable Tropical Depression Seven. The first, Tropical Depression Five, developed in the central Gulf of Mexico on August 6. It made landfall in Louisiana three days later, eventually dissipating over Mississippi. The other, designated Tropical Depression Ten, formed over the Bahamas on August 28. It moved westward, crossing Florida and the Gulf of Mexico before dissipating over southeastern Louisiana on September 1. The depression dropped moderate rainfall along the Gulf Coast, peaking at at Gulf Shores, Alabama.

There were three non-developing tropical depressions in September, the first of which just off the coast of Africa on September 3. It moved west-northwestward, passing near Cape Verde before dissipating on September 8. The next, Tropical Depression Fifteen, originated on September 8 east of Florida from the same trough that also spawned Fern, Ginger, and Heidi. It initially moved northward before curving to the west, making landfall near the Georgia-South Carolina border on September 11 before dissipating the following day. The other, Tropical Depression Sixteen, developed off the coast of Africa on September 10, moving westward before dissipating on September 14.

The final non-developing tropical depression of the season formed on October 6 in the western Caribbean Sea. It crossed the Yucatán Peninsula the next day, dropping heavy rainfall up to . The depression turned to the northeast due to an approaching upper-level trough, and it transitioned into a frontal wave on October 10. As the trough advanced ahead of the storm, a ridge built across the southeast United States, causing the cyclone to turn northward and parallel the west coast of Florida. It regained tropical characteristics before moving ashore near Apalachicola and dissipating on October 14.

== Storm names ==

The following list of names was used for named tropical storms that formed in the North Atlantic in 1971. This is the same list used in the 1967 season, with the exception of &quot;Beth&quot;, which replaced &quot;Beulah&quot;. Storms were named &quot;Beth&quot;, &quot;Kristy&quot;, and &quot;Laura&quot; for the first time in 1971. No names were retired following the season; however, an overhaul of the naming system in 1979 to include male names resulted in this list being discarded.

== Season effects ==
This is a table of all of the storms that formed in the 1971 Atlantic hurricane season. It includes their name, duration, peak classification and intensities, areas affected, damage, and death totals. Deaths in parentheses are additional and indirect (an example of an indirect death would be a traffic accident), but were still related to that storm. Damage and deaths include totals while the storm was extratropical, a wave, or a low, and all of the damage figures are in 1971 USD.

==History==
The history of Jokioinen is tightly connected to the Jokioinen estate, which was established in 1562. The estate developed into the largest estate in Finland during the time of the provincial governor Ernst Gustaf von Willebrand. At the beginning of 20th century the estate had a corn mill, saw mill, a brick factory, steel plant and a sugar and syrup factory.

Due to the crofters law of 1918 and the land reform law of 1945 the estate was split into more than 1500 homes and small farms. The rest of the estate was transferred to the ownership of the Finnish state in 1918. In 1928 the Department of Finnish Plant Breeding from Tikkurila and in 1957 the observatory from Pasila were transferred to the Jokioinen estate.

== Climate ==

<text>Jomala is a municipality of Åland, an autonomous territory of Finland. In terms of population, it is the next largest after Mariehamn, the capital of Åland.

The municipality has a population of () and covers an area of of which is water. The population density is .

The municipality is unilingually Swedish.

Mariehamn Airport is located in Jomala. Three of Åland&#x27;s four highways cross the municipality of Jomala as they start from Mariehamn; highway 1 runs west to Eckerö, highway 2 northeast to Sund and highway 3 east to Lumparland.

== History ==
&quot;Jomala&quot; is the name of a god common to many Finno-Ugric peoples. Jumala is Finnish for god and Jomala is one of the sites where the Christian church organized itself in Finland. Other versions of the name that have occurred are Jwmala in 1356, Jomalum in 1414, Jomala in 1486 and Jwmala in 1494. One of oldest churches in Finland stands here as testament to these times.

Jomala was inhabited around 2000 BC with Jettböle being one of the most renowned prehistoric sites. Other ancient sites include Borgberget, where there was a Viking fortress, and Kasberget which was one of the many mountains where signal fires were lit when enemies were seen approaching.

Before the city of Mariehamn was established in 1861, the peninsula where the city is situated was a part of Jomala.

== Sights ==
The church of Jomala is dedicated to the patron saint of Åland, St. Olav. It is the oldest surviving church in Finland and it is situated in the village of Prästgården. The oldest parts of the church date from the 13th century. The church tower is 52 meters tall and there is also a memorial for all the Ålanders who emigrated. Another memorial refers to sailors who lost their lives at sea. The &quot;King of Åland&quot; Julius Sundblom is buried here. A large medieval cemetery with graves from the Iron Age can be visited behind the church.

The Lemström channel divides Jomala from its neighboring municipality, Lemland. It was widened by Russian POWs in 1882.

The Kungsö battery was one of the ten coastal batteries which the Russians built in Åland during the First World War in 1916. The battery was situated 32 meters above sea level, on the highest point of Dalsberg. Finnish, Swedish and German troops invaded it in 1918. It was dismantled in 1919 by Finnish civilian workers.

There are various well-preserved windmills in Jomala, e.g. on &quot;Norrgård&quot; farm in Björsby.

== Culture ==
Since Jomala belongs to the Swedish-speaking areas of Finland, Midsummer is celebrated every year by hoisting up a maypole. It was a tribute to the sun in the ancient times. Harvest festivities are held every September.

== Geography ==
Jomala is bordered by Lemland in the southwest, Mariehamn in the south, Hammarland in the northwest, Finström in the north and Sund in the northeast.

During the Edo period, economic growth within the wealthy but low-status merchant classes resulted in an excess of disposable income, much of which was spent on clothing.

<text>Bixente Jean-Michel Lizarazu (, born 9 December 1969) is a French former professional footballer who played as a left-back.

He rose through the ranks at Bordeaux, where he was part of a team that finished second in the French First Division in 1989–1990, were administratively relegated to the Second Division at the end of the 1990–1991 due to financial problems, and then won promotion from the Second Division in the 1991–92 season. His Bordeaux team finished runners-up in the 1995–96 UEFA Cup. Due to his Basque heritage, he was able to join Athletic Club in 1996, but did not nail down a starting spot during his one season at the club.

In 1997, he joined German giants Bayern Munich, where he enjoyed much success. He won six Bundesliga championships with the team, as well as the 2000–01 UEFA Champions League, where he scored his penalty in the shootout in the final.

In a 12-year international career from 1992 to 2004, Lizarazu earned 97 caps for the France national team. He played in three UEFA European Championships and two FIFA World Cups for France, winning the 1998 World Cup and UEFA Euro 2000.

==Early life==
Lizarazu was born in Saint-Jean-de-Luz, Pyrénées-Atlantiques, and grew up in Hendaye; both cities being located in the French Basque Country. He is of Basque descent.

==Club career==
===Bordeaux===
An enthusiast in several sports from a young age, Lizarazu began his professional career with Bordeaux, joining the club&#x27;s youth setup as a 15-year-old in 1984 and initially playing as a winger. After being told he would not make a career from football due to his frail physicality as a teenager, he impressed the staff with his determination and became a member of the senior squad in 1988 alongside forward Christophe Dugarry. He was retrained to play as a counter-attacking left-back at the suggestion of coach Didier Couécou and soon replaced the veteran Gernot Rohr (later to be the club&#x27;s manager) in the position.

In 1990 Bordeaux finished runners-up in the French championship, but the following year they were administratively relegated amid financial problems. Lizarazu remained with the club and helped them immediately regain their top tier status in 1992. The club also signed Zinedine Zidane, who became another important element of the team, which went on to achieve two 4th- and a 7th-place finish over the next three seasons, Lizarazu contributing 101 appearances and 15 goals.

In summer 1995, Bordeaux won the UEFA Intertoto Cup to qualify for the 1995–96 UEFA Cup. They would go all the way to the final under coach Rohr, beating Real Betis, A.C. Milan and Slavia Prague before losing to Bayern Munich 5–1 on aggregate. However their league form suffered, dropping to 16th. Following UEFA Euro 1996, in which Dugarry, Zidane and Lizarazu were part of the French squad which reached the semi-finals, the three moved abroad seeking a new challenge: Zidane joining Juventus, Dugarry going to Milan and Lizarazu staying local but changing nations by moving to Athletic Bilbao, based the same distance from his home in the French Basque Country as Bordeaux. He appeared 299 times for his formative club, scoring 28 goals.

===Athletic Bilbao===
Lizarazu spent just one season with the La Liga club after becoming the first Frenchman to play for Athletic, which has a policy of selecting only players of Basque birth or heritage.

Suffering from a persistent groin injury, he was unable to displace the experienced Aitor Larrazábal at left-back, received two red cards among the 16 league appearances he did make, and had disagreements with the head coach, compatriot Luis Fernández. In the 1997 close season, he transferred to Bayern Munich.

===Bayern Munich===
Before even playing a Bundesliga match, Lizarazu lifted a trophy with his new club, winning the inaugural edition of the preseason DFL-Ligapokal. It was the start of a highly successful spell in Bavaria, despite the interruption of some serious injuries, as he went on to win six Bundesliga championships (including three in a row between 1999 and 2001), as well as five DFB-Pokals, the Champions League in 2001 (scoring his penalty in the shootout), and the Intercontinental Cup. On winning the Intercontinental Cup in 2001, he became the first player to be a current European and World champion in both club and international football.

Lizarazu said that he would leave Bayern in the summer of 2004 and eventually signed with Marseille. However, after only six months back in France, he returned to Bayern Munich in January 2005. During his second spell with Bayern, ending in 2006 when he gave way to the emerging Philipp Lahm, Lizarazu wore the shirt number 69; clarifying that it was not a lewd gesture, he said this was because he was born in 1969, his height is 1.69 m and he weighed 69 kg. He made 268 appearances in all competitions for Bayern between 1997 and 2006, scoring eight goals. 183 of these games were in the German top-flight.

==International career==
Lizarazu was capped 97 times for France (for the first time on 14 November 1992 against Finland), scoring two goals, and helped them win the 1998 FIFA World Cup and Euro 2000, starting in the final of both tournaments. He was also part of squad for France in the 2002 FIFA World Cup, though France were eliminated from group stage in the tournament without scoring a single goal where he was involved all 3 matches in the group stage. He retired from international football after France were surprisingly eliminated by eventual winners Greece at Euro 2004.

==Style of play==
Regarded by pundits as one of the best left-backs of his generation, Lizarazu was an attacking full-back or wing-back, who was known for his passing, technique, pace, stamina, and his ability to get up the flank and provide accurate crosses from the touch-line. In addition to his offensive prowess, he was also known for his defensive abilities, despite his diminutive stature, which, along with his speed, allowed him to track back.

==Personal life==
After retirement, Lizarazu got involved in Brazilian jiu-jitsu. He competed in a jiu-jitsu competition in Europe in 2009, where he became European champion in the Blue Belt Senior 1 Light Division. He is also a keen surfer and works as a football pundit for French television and radio. In 2013, Lizarazu was described as a &quot;tramp&quot; by his successor as France&#x27;s left-back, Patrice Evra, after he and other pundits criticised Evra for giving an impromptu team talk during half-time of a 2014 FIFA World Cup qualifying match against Belarus.

Lizarazu has two children. He is in a relationship with actress Claire Keim with whom he has a daughter.

Lizarazu was formerly engaged to singer Elsa Lunghini from 1999 to 2006.

Lizarazu is a native speaker of Basque and French. In addition, he also speaks Spanish, German and English.

The municipality is unilingually Finnish.

== Geography ==

* Ahmovaara
* Halivaara (Hali)
* Juuka
* Kannas
* Kajoo
* Kuhnusta
* Larinsaari
* Matara
* Nunnanlahti
* Paalasmaa
* Petrovaara
* Pihlajavaara
* Polvela

The neighboring municipalities of Juuka are Kuopio, Kaavi, Kontiolahti, Lieksa, Nurmes, Polvijärvi and Rautavaara. The &quot;former&quot; neighboring municipalities are the Nurmes rural municipality, which was annexed to Nurmes in 1973, Pielisjärvi, which was also connected to Lieksa in 1973, and Säyneinen, which was annexed to Juankoski in 1971; Juankoski, on the other hand, was connected to Kuopio in 2017.

==Etymology==
Juuka means a river that flows through a lake. The village of Juuka dates back to the 16th century. In the late 19th century, settlements began to be settled along the roads and shops were established by the banks of the Lake Pielinen. 

The parish of Juuka was initially a prayer room separated from the parts of the parishes of Pielisjärvi and Nurmes and its own parish from 1873. The present church was completed in the 1850s, but was preceded by two earlier churches. 

== Juuan Elli ==
Ellinpäivät is a scenario where in four days different associations, communities, and companies arrange events for each day. To get information about these events there is a notification in the newspaper Vaarojen Sanomat. In the paper there is info and a timetable for the events. The board selects the people in charge of the scenario. Elli refers to the figurehead of the scenario and a new figurehead is chosen every year. 

The events can include concerts, market events, the declaring of a new Elli, and a new event called “Juuret Juuassa –ryhmän Rehvit”. Essentially, the event is a car show where many retro cars and their drivers can be found. For that reason, it&#x27;s often called a rally for older youngsters.

<doc id="779046" wikidata="Q939447" url="?curid=779046" title="Painkiller (video game)">
<text>Painkiller is a first-person shooter video game developed by Polish game studio People Can Fly and published by DreamCatcher Interactive in April 2004 for Microsoft Windows and ported to Xbox in 2006. The game&#x27;s single player campaign follows a dead man in Purgatory who is offered a deal to defeat the invading forces of Lucifer&#x27;s army in exchange for being allowed to enter Heaven. The game was particularly well-received for its multiplayer experience and was featured for two seasons on the Cyberathlete Professional League&#x27;s World Tour.

== Gameplay ==

The game is inspired by first-person shooters such as &quot;Quake&quot;, &quot;Doom&quot; and &quot;Serious Sam&quot;, with the emphasis on killing large numbers of monsters. The game is divided into five chapters, each about five levels long. The player&#x27;s objective is to get through each level, from start to finish, by slaughtering hundreds of monsters. Fighting monsters often occurs in mass battles, where the player has to fight an attack by a swarm of enemies in a large room, while the exits shut and heavy metal music plays in the background, and after such a battle, the player passes a &quot;checkpoint&quot; which advances the game, the exits open up again, and the music returns to the usual softer tune played in the level. One of the game&#x27;s most important aspects is its diversity, with each level presenting a new location with various themes and graphic styles. The levels include castles, monasteries, an opera house, graveyards, and more. Monsters are also very different, with new ones almost every level. There are five &quot;boss&quot; levels where the player fights a boss.

The game presents an option to complete a special task each level, which results in the player getting a &quot;tarot card&quot;, a rare, hard-to-obtain bonus. Each equipped card provides different bonuses for a small amount of time (30 seconds), like powered-up weapons or slow motion.

The game also features a multiplayer component. It includes classic modes like Deathmatch and Capture-the-Flag.

== Plot ==
The game revolves around a young man named Daniel Garner (Cam Clarke), who is happily married to his wife Catherine (Vanessa Marshall). At the start of the game, Daniel is about to take Catherine out for a birthday meal. As they drive towards their destination at high speed, in the pouring rain, Daniel takes his eyes off the road to look at his wife and while his attention is diverted, he ploughs their car into a truck. Both of them are killed instantly in the crash.

While Catherine manages to make it to Heaven and lives in harmony, Daniel is trapped in Purgatory. One day, an angel called Samael (John Cygan) tells him that in order to receive purification, he has to kill four of Lucifer&#x27;s generals in order to prevent a war between Heaven and Hell. Lucifer has been secretly organizing a massive army that could overwhelm Heaven, taking over Purgatory in the process. Small portions of the army are already beginning the march. With little choice available to him, Daniel accepts the task. With the forces of Hell seizing and corrupting various parts of Purgatory, Daniel goes through different and random phases of history within Purgatory, which range greatly from ancient times to the modern era, including Medieval Europe, Babylon, the Crusades, the 1800s, and a time slice of modern industry.

After killing the first general, Daniel meets a woman named Eve (also voiced by Marshall), another soul who has been in Purgatory for a long time. She gives him information about the whereabouts of the remaining generals and small elements of Lucifer&#x27;s army already mobilizing. She also tells him about life in Purgatory, and the possibility that he could be dragged to Hell should he fall in battle and become lost forever. While this is all understood, what Daniel does not understand is why he came here, but Eve insists it is because of something in his past, and it is up to him to find out.

After the second general&#x27;s defeat and reuniting with Eve, Daniel travels to meet a demonic friend named Asmodeus (Jim Ward), for information about new rallying positions for Lucifer&#x27;s armies. Asmodeus once saved Daniel&#x27;s life after he single-handedly defeated four demons at once one day, almost losing himself in the process. Eve is wary of Asmodeus and questions as to why he did not finish off Daniel when he was weak, but he insists that he did not come to Purgatory to fill the graves with lost souls like the others. He also questions Eve if she is really &quot;The Eve&quot; referenced in the Bible, to which Daniel jokes &quot;Where is Adam?&quot; before continuing on.

After the third general&#x27;s defeat, he confronts Samael, having had enough of the fighting and wanting out of Purgatory, but Samael remains firm with Daniel that it is not that simple to leave and he must finish the task given to him. After being directed to the whereabouts of Alastor (Jim Cummings), Lucifer&#x27;s right-hand and final general, Daniel is warned that Alastor is already aware that he is being pursued and his own elite soldiers are prepared and waiting. Daniel reluctantly continues his quest for purification.

After Daniel kills Alastor, Eve arrives at the scene in shock, realizing Lucifer will no doubt be on his way and they should make themselves ready. Surprisingly, Asmodeus arrives, complimenting Daniel for his victory and examining the scene. Suddenly, both Eve and Daniel find Asmodeus highly suspicious and try questioning him as to why he is really in Purgatory, to which he eventually replies, &quot;I dig graves&quot;. Suddenly, he dissolves into a ball of fire and Lucifer himself (Lex Lang) appears. He mocks Daniel while recognizing him as a worthy opponent and thanking him for removing Alastor, who had been constantly arguing with Lucifer that the armies should have attacked sooner rather than wait. He snatches Eve, whom he claims had escaped from Hell, and takes her with him before disappearing back into Hell.

Samael appears, congratulating Daniel for his success and informs him his task is done. Now he may proceed to Heaven and reunite with Catherine. But Daniel refuses, knowing that it is not over yet, &quot;not even close&quot; to use his words. He also knows that it would be only a matter of time before Lucifer can fledge a new and massive enough army, but the next time would be far worse. He decides to go after them, but Samael tries to make him reconsider, for if Daniel goes to Hell, there will be no escaping from there. Daniel turns down the offer once more and asks that Catherine be told not to wait for him, for he will not be coming. Samael gives in and shows him the direction to the gates of Hell, warning that they are protected from the inside by the most elite of the demonic forces for the purpose of keeping the souls of those who are damned within Hell.

Daniel eventually emerges in Hell, a twisted landscape made of torn fragments from various wars throughout human history (a play on the phrase &quot;War Is Hell&quot;). After vanquishing enough souls of the damned, most of which are recognizable as foes he has defeated, he confronts Lucifer in Demon Mode and kills him, rescuing Eve in the process, who has been rendered unconscious. After killing Lucifer, Alastor reappears before him, with hordes of demons around him. Daniel learns that he did not really kill Alastor as he could only be defeated in Hell. With Lucifer gone, the position of Hell&#x27;s ruler is open. Alastor has already taken it and announced his ultimatum. He leaves Daniel to the mercy of the demons around him, who eagerly accepts the challenge. The game ends with Daniel defending himself against the never-ending hordes.

If the game is finished in Trauma (the hardest difficulty in the game), an extra ending is presented. Daniel is now finally able to go to Heaven and reunite with Catherine.

== Release ==
The Special Edition release is a budget version of the game. It includes only 12 of the 24 levels in the full game, no full-motion videos, and no multiplayer mode. It does, however, show its award-winning features on the front case like PC Gaming World Game of the Year, &quot;Game Informer&quot; game of the month and GameSpy&#x27;s editor&#x27;s choice.

The Gold/Black Edition combines the &quot;Battle Out of Hell&quot; expansion with the original game onto a single disc. It also features mapping and editing tools, a limited edition Penny Arcade poster, a making-of movie, and behind the scenes interviews, and the latest patch which adds new features to the game and brings its quality up to competition standard (see below). The technical difference is that the Gold Edition has the game over six CDs, while the Black Edition has the game on DVD.

* The Universe/Triple Dose edition was released July 8, 2008. The original game, as well as the &quot;Battle Out of Hell&quot; and &quot;Overdose&quot; packages, are all contained in one case.
* The Pandemonium Edition contains the original game as well as its three expansions &quot;Battle Out of Hell&quot;, &quot;Overdose&quot; and &quot;Resurrection&quot;.
* The Collection contains all Painkiller Games with their expansions &quot;Black Edition&quot;, &quot;Overdose&quot;, &quot;Resurrection&quot;, &quot;Redemption&quot;, &quot;Recurring Evil&quot;, &quot;Hell &amp; Damnation&quot; (with all DLC content). It also features mapping and editing tools. All games require Steam if they are purchased in the Collection.

=== Ports ===
In 2006 the game was ported by People Can Fly to the Xbox as &quot;Painkiller: Hell Wars&quot;. While not a straight port, it is actually a mix of the game and its expansion, &quot;Painkiller: Battle Out of Hell&quot;. &quot;Painkiller: Hell Wars&quot; was also announced for the PlayStation Portable and PlayStation 2. However, both versions were cancelled worldwide. The publisher of &quot;Painkiller: Hell Wars&quot; was DreamCatcher Interactive. &quot;Painkiller: Purgatory (HD)&quot; was developed by Machineworks Northwest (level design by Med-Art) for Android and iOS.

== Expansions ==
=== &quot;Battle Out of Hell&quot; ===
&quot;Painkiller: Battle Out of Hell&quot; is an expansion pack for &quot;Painkiller&quot;, released on December 1, 2004. It was developed and published by the same companies as &quot;Painkiller&quot;. &quot;Painkiller: Battle Out of Hell&quot; features an all-new 10-level single player campaign, two new weapons (with two fire modes each), new multiplayer game modes, and improved visual effects.

The story continues where the original left off: Lucifer is killed and his position as ruler of Hell is now free. Alastor, one of four hell generals Daniel Garner was assigned to kill in the original game, appears with a horde of demons and confronts Daniel, who now has to retreat with the help of Eve. Daniel&#x27;s new goal is to battle out of hell and eliminate Alastor, who is now rightful ruler of the demonic forces. Before confronting his powerful enemy, Daniel visits such places as an orphanage full of possessed children, a hellish circus named Loony Park, a pirate bay, coliseums, Necropolis, and even a twisted version of World War II Leningrad. After Daniel kills Alastor, Eve absorbs Alastor&#x27;s power, to Daniel&#x27;s surprise. She transforms into the new ruler of hell, and thanks Daniel for allowing her to take control. Eve offers Daniel the chance to rule by her side, but Daniel refuses. Eve then invites Daniel to leave and join Catherine in Heaven, but Daniel again refuses, and begins firing his gun at Eve as the screen fades to black.

=== &quot;Overdose&quot; ===

&quot;Painkiller: Overdose&quot; is the second stand-alone &quot;Painkiller&quot; game and uses the same engine as the first. It was released for Windows on October 30, 2007, worldwide. Originally being developed by Mindware from the Czech Republic as a fan-made game mod, DreamCatcher Interactive granted the project full financial and technical support. In &quot;Overdose&quot;, the player takes the role of Belial, a half-angel, half-demon gatekeeper. The game contains 6 new weapons, 40 monster types and 16 new levels. The story is a spin-off and is said to tie wandering ends and provide a bridge between the original game and a potential sequel. On October 17, 2007, the demo was released. On October 23, 2007, DreamCatcher announced that the game had started shipping to retail stores.

The story is set just after Daniel kills Lucifer. The death of Hell&#x27;s leader allows Belial, the prisoner and outcast, to escape and start his vendetta against those who imprisoned him: demonic beast Cerberus and Samael, an angel who betrayed his own kind. Belial starts his journey with killing his prison warden (and later using his head as a weapon). After traveling through various hellish places and defeating countless demons, he kills Cerberus and reaches Samael&#x27;s lair. There, Belial defeats the fallen angel and rips his wings off as an act of vengeance.

=== &quot;Resurrection&quot; ===

On April 9, 2009, developer Homegrown Games and publisher DreamCatcher Interactive revealed &quot;Painkiller: Resurrection&quot;, a stand-alone expansion to the original game running on an updated PainEngine. It was released on October 27, 2009, for Microsoft Windows.

It features six new levels, and a new hero: William &quot;Bill&quot; Sherman, who is blown to pieces by his own C-4 payload, with which he wanted to eliminate a group of mobsters. The fact that he accidentally blew a bus full of innocent civilians means he is about to be claimed by Hell. However, he wakes up in purgatory and is tasked with redeeming his soul by battling a new demonic threat, which is revealed to be led by Astaroth, once a general of Lucifer, and Ramiel, a corrupted angel.

=== &quot;Redemption&quot; ===
&quot;Painkiller: Redemption&quot; is an add-on released on February 25, 2011, as a downloadable game. Similar to &quot;Overdose&quot;, the new expansion pack was originally a mod, created by a small group of fans under the label &quot;Eggtooth&#x27;&quot;. Additional development by Homegrown. The publisher of &quot;Painkiller: Redemption&quot; is DreamCatcher Interactive. It features a new heavy metal soundtrack, minor graphic changes, and six levels with nearly 6,000 enemies to kill. &quot;Painkiller Redemption&quot; features the return of Daniel Garner and Belial, both as playable characters. The development team has released free post-release support for the game, which includes extra content for multiplayer, or a new single-player chapter. Eggtooth Team did not create any new content, so the maps used are the ones originally found in Painkiller multiplayer, and all monsters are taken from previous Painkiller installments, including the final boss, who uses the model of King Alastor from &quot;Battle Out of Hell&quot;.

The game is narrated through animated text messages, and starts when Belial, the hero of &quot;Painkiller: Overdose&quot;, saves Daniel Garner from Eve, the current queen of Hell. Together, Daniel and Belial fight a big battle through her minions in Purgatory, until they have found Bill Sherman, the protagonist of &quot;Painkiller: Resurrection&quot;. With Bill&#x27;s help, they are able to strike at Eve. The game ends with the surprising arrival of Samael, an angel of God who once tasked Daniel with destroying Hell&#x27;s leaders. With Eve defeated, Samael plans to use the dark essence left by her to become a new ruler of Hell. The game concludes with Belial and Daniel understanding that the battle is not yet over.

=== &quot;Recurring Evil&quot; ===
&quot;Painkiller: Recurring Evil&quot; is an add-on featuring 5 new levels with about 4000 enemies. It was released digitally on February 29, 2012, by Nordic Games via Steam, and developed by Med-Art and Eggtooth.

It continues the story of &quot;Resurrection&quot; and serves as a side story for &quot;Redemption&quot;. Bill Sherman becomes the ruler of Purgatory, blessed with power of the Sword of Seraphim. However, the fallen angel Samael (now wingless after his defeat at the hands of Belial in &quot;Overdose&quot;), who took the power of Hell from Eve, steals Bill&#x27;s sword and sends him to Purgatory&#x27;s unexplored locations, forcing the fight to start again. Bill reaches Samael in the end of his journey, but the game ends without a fight, as the fallen angel defeats Bill. Depending on the player choosing the good or evil side, Bill is either rescued by Belial or killed by Samael.

==Development==
The game was in development for more than 18 months.

== Reception ==

=== Critical reception ===
With the release of &quot;Painkiller&quot; in 2004, reception was generally positive with an average critic score of 82% at GameRankings and 81/100 at Metacritic. &quot;Painkiller&quot; was mostly praised for its simple yet entertaining first-person shooter gameplay and its varied level and artistic design. GameSpot noted the variety in levels and foes by stating &quot;Remarkably, the eclectic variety of settings somehow ends up having a cohesive feel to it, and the variety itself is definitely to the game&#x27;s credit&quot; while GameSpy praised the graphics engine calling it &quot;an original, muscular engine, capable of vast spectacular levels&quot;. However while IGN noted the gameplay positively, they also mentioned repetition in certain stages going on to say &quot;simple aiming exercises seem to lack a little substance when compared to more recent shooters&quot;. IGN gave the soundtrack of the game a rating of 4/10, calling it &quot;generic speed metal with a techno flourish&quot;, criticizing it as dated and generic. Another criticism was focused on its multiplayer aspect being similar to that of the older &quot;Quake&quot; games, being called by GameSpot as a more of a &quot;throwback to the days of the original &quot;Quake&quot;&quot; with the feel of &quot;deja vu&quot;.

Upon its release, &quot;Painkiller&quot; received &quot;PC Game of the Month&quot; awards from &quot;Game Informer&quot; and GameSpot, &quot;Editors Choice&quot; from GameSpy, &quot;Computer Games Magazine&quot; and &quot;PC Zone&quot;, and &quot;Kick Ass Product&quot; from &quot;Maximum PC&quot;. &quot;Computer Games Magazine&quot; named &quot;Painkiller&quot; the third-best computer game of 2004. The editors wrote, &quot;&quot;Painkiller&quot; is dumb turned up to 11, but it reaches a rarefied level of dumb where it flips around to become genius.&quot; It was a runner-up for the magazine&#x27;s &quot;Best Art Direction&quot; award. It received a runner-up position in GameSpot&#x27;s 2004 &quot;Best Shooter&quot; category across all platforms, losing to &quot;Half-Life 2&quot;.

In May 2008, Painkiller was featured on &quot;Escapist Magazine&quot;&#x27;s weekly review series Zero Punctuation. Reviewer Ben &quot;Yahtzee&quot; Croshaw, known for his acerbic reviews, stated that &quot;Painkiller&quot; was an example of an excellent first-person shooter game, praising its removal of aspects such as key hunting and fetch side quests in favor of &quot;pure genocidal fun.&quot; Seemingly hours after the review, the &quot;Painkiller&quot; banner found on the Steam Store appeared on the front page, now sporting the tag &quot;All you really need to know is that there is a gun that shoots shurikens and lightning...&quot;, a quote from the review. In 2010, UGO included the game on the list of the 42 Best Games Ever.

&quot;Battle out of Hell&quot; was also met with a positive response but with less only being an expansion pack. While some were enthusiastic over the new content, like Game Informer even saying &quot;If I had to pick a game to be the poster child for the concept of expansion packs, P&quot;ainkiller: Battle Out Of Hell&quot; might well be it&quot;, others like GameSpot found some of the levels not as interesting as the original saying &quot;for the most part, much of the rest of the game is kind of bland&quot; but still found &quot;Great &quot;Painkiller&quot; gameplay mostly intact&quot;. They also pointed out longer loading times and &quot;aggravating&quot; puzzles.

Upon the release in 2006 of the Xbox port &quot;Hell Wars&quot;, many were generally pleased with its translation while others found some issues. IGN were not favourable towards the &quot;Environmental textures&quot; that &quot;don&#x27;t do much to enhance the experience&quot; and even found the port to have additional bugs like when enemies &quot;get stuck out of sight on a level [that] mean you can&#x27;t advance until you reload your game&quot;.

Three years later in late 2007 when &quot;Overdose&quot; was released, reception, while also positive was quick to point the game&#x27;s shortcomings. GameZone praised &quot;Overdose&quot; for retaining the basic gameplay elements that made the original 2004 title popular, and that it &quot;extends the world with new weapons, enemies, bosses, and levels that will fulfill any adrenaline junkie&#x27;s craving&quot;. GameSpot however were still annoyed by the long load times and unhappy with the quiet multiplayer mode but were still positive over the gameplay concluding&quot; this old-fashioned shooter is a welcome respite from the scripted, story-driven epics littering the FPS landscape these days (and a pleasant reminder of the simple joy of shooting fiendish creeps in the face)&quot;. However, Game Informer found the game to be aged and while &quot;there is a group out there who will find this game charming&quot;, it concluded that &quot;their numbers might be growing thin.&quot;

=== Competitive play ===
At the end of 2004 &quot;Painkiller&quot; was chosen by the Cyberathlete Professional League to be their official 2005 World Tour game. This was slightly controversial with many esports followers and competitors due to the fact that other games had proven themselves at least as popular online multiplayer games. As the tour had already been announced as a one-on-one deathmatch format competition, &quot;Unreal Tournament 2004&quot; and &quot;Doom 3&quot; were also fan favourites for this tour. However, since &quot;Unreal Tournament 2004&quot; developer Epic Games was in the process of changing publishers from Atari to Midway Games and could not guarantee their full support throughout the year-long tour, it was not chosen.

This agreement between the CPL and DreamCatcher also meant that no other organization was allowed to use &quot;Painkiller&quot; in a gaming competition with prizes above 2,000.- without obtaining a license from the CPL. It also had effects on &quot;Painkiller&quot; beyond professional competition; a patch was released to add new features to the game and bring its quality up to competition standard. This updated version of the game also resulted in a special edition re-release of the game bearing the CPL World Tour logo, entitled &quot;Painkiller: Gold Edition&quot; in North America and &quot;Painkiller: Black Edition&quot; elsewhere. This new version contained both &quot;Painkiller&quot; and its expansion pack &quot;Painkiller: Battle out of Hell&quot; unpatched, among other additions including a video about the making of the game. However, &quot;Quake III Arena&quot; was selected as the one-versus-one deathmatch game of the CPL for 2006, replacing &quot;Painkiller&quot;.

==Remake and sequel==
&quot;Painkiller: Hell &amp; Damnation&quot;, developed by The Farm 51 on Unreal Engine 3, was released in 2012. It is notable for being both partial remake of and sequel to the original title.

== Geography ==

There are all together around 465 lakes in Jämsä; the largest lakes are Päijänne, and Lake Kuorevesi. Jämsä is located on the watershed of the main catchment areas of the Kokemäki River and the Kymi River. The eastern and central areas of the municipality belong to the Kymi River watershed, the western ones to the Kokemäki River watershed. The catchment area of the Jämsä route of the first division phase of the Kymijoki main catchment area covers almost the entire area of Koskenpää and Jämsänkoski as well as the center of Jämsä and the central part of Jämsänniemi. The Great Päijänne area of the first division of the Kymi River watershed covers the eastern, south-eastern and southern areas of Jämsä. The catchment area of the Längelmävesi and Hauho routes of the first division of the Kokemäki River main catchment area covers the southwestern part of Jämsä, i.e. the southern part of Längelmäki and Kuorevesi. The catchment area of the Keuruu route in the first division phase of the Kokemäki River watershed covers the western and north-western part of Jämsä, i.e. the northern part of Kuorevesi and the westernmost parts of Koskenpää.

The bedrock of Jämsä belongs to the abyssal rock area of the Central Finland. The predominant species are coarse-grained granodiorites and granites, which are often porphyry and weathered in places. Rapakivi granite rock has also been found in the vicinity of Jämsä. The geological formation of the Inner Finland, which is similar to the Salpausselkä formations but younger than them, runs from Hämeenkangas in the north-west of Tampere through Orivesi and Jämsä to Laukaa. The meltwater of the Weichselian glaciation associated with its formation and melting has shaped several Jämsä valleys. The meltwater of the glacier flowed through the numerous transition valleys of the present-day Jämsä area.

===Food===
In the 1980s, Jämsä&#x27;s traditional parish dishes were called &quot;liponen&quot; (meat cooked with turnip chips and barley groats), &quot;piimätalkkuna&quot; and grandma&#x27;s buns.

<text>Eudaf Hen (Eudaf &quot;the Old&quot;) is a figure of Welsh tradition. He is remembered as a King of the Britons and the father of Elen Luyddog and Conan Meriadoc in sources such as the Welsh prose tale &quot;The Dream of Macsen Wledig&quot; and Geoffrey of Monmouth&#x27;s Latin chronicle &quot;Historia Regum Britanniae&quot;. He also figures into Welsh genealogies. Geoffrey of Monmouth calls him Octavius, a corruption and faux-Latinization of Old Welsh/Breton Outham (later spelled Eudaf). According to the medieval Welsh genealogy from Mostyn MS. 117, Eudaf was a direct ancestor of King Arthur.

==Etymology==
Modern Welsh &quot;Eudaf&quot; (Middle Welsh &quot;Eudav&quot;, early Old Welsh &quot;Out(h)am&quot;) comes from Brittonic &quot;*Aui-tamos&quot; meaning &quot;Very Strong in Will&quot;.

==Geoffrey of Monmouth==
Geoffrey of Monmouth, in his &quot;Historia Regum Britanniae&quot;, renders the name in pseudo-Latin form as &quot;Octavius&quot; and introduces him as a half-brother to Constantine I, who has become King of the Britons following the death of his father Constantius. Eventually Constantine is made Roman Emperor, requiring him to leave Britain in the hands of a proconsul. Octavius (Eudaf Hen), rebels against Roman rule, killing the proconsul and proclaiming himself king.

Constantine responds by sending three legions to Britain under the command of his great-uncle Trahern, the brother of the late King Coel. Trahern lands at &quot;Kaerperis&quot; and captures it, forcing Octavius to conscript all the island into the army to combat the Roman legions. Octavius engages Trahern in a field outside Winchester and is victorious. Trahern flees to Alba (Scotland) and pillages the land, and Octavius comes after him. They meet at Westmorland, and Octavius was defeated and forced out of Britain. Trahern takes the crown himself, while Octavius seeks aid from King Gunbert of Norway. In Britain, supporters of Octavius ambush Trahern and kill him near London, allowing Octavius to return to Britain. Once arrived, he scatters the Roman forces and retakes the throne of Britain, gaining an incredible amount of wealth and prestige.

Eventually, Caradocus, Duke of Cornwall, suggests that Octavius marry his only daughter Helen to the new Roman Emperor, Maximianus (Magnus Maximus), thereby uniting the British and Roman crowns. Octavius agrees, and Caradocus&#x27; son Mauricius is sent to Rome with the proposal. However Octavius&#x27; nephew Conan Meriadoc (elsewhere his son) opposes the union, and nearly attacks the arriving Maximianus. Finally Caradocus restores the peace, and Octavius abdicates the throne in favor of Maximianus.

==The Breton Life of Saint Gurthiern==
Utilizing an archaic spelling of his name, Eudaf Hen is mentioned as Outham Senis (Outham &quot;the Old&quot;) in a fabricated genealogy from the &quot;Life of Saint Gurthiern&quot;, included in the Breton Latin Kemperle Cartulary, compiled between 1118 and 1127. This text traces the descent of Saint Gurthiern back to the ancestor figure Beli (Beli Mawr) son of Outham son of Maximianus (Maximus) son of Constantius the son of Constantine the son of Helen &quot;who was thought to have held the Cross of Christ&quot;. Outham is given another son, Kenan (Conan Meriadoc), who is said to have been the founder of Brittany. Evidence suggests that the sources for the Life originated in Wales. The text&#x27;s compiler, Gurheden, says that his source for the information was one &quot;Iuthael son of Aidan&quot;; while the name &quot;Iuthael&quot; is a Brythonic name known in both Wales and Brittany, the Gaelic &quot;Aidan&quot; is not attested in early Brittany, but is known in Wales. Additionally, Gurthiern&#x27;s genealogy corresponds strongly with the descent elsewhere attributed to the Welsh saint Cadoc, further suggesting a Welsh origin.

==The Dream of Macsen Wledig==

Although the &quot;Mabinogion&quot; tale &quot;Breudwyt Macsen Wledic&quot; (&quot;The Dream of Macsen Wledig&quot;) is written in later manuscripts than Geoffrey&#x27;s version, the two accounts are so different that scholars agree the Dream cannot be based purely on Geoffrey&#x27;s version. The Dream&#x27;s account also seems to accord better with details in the Triads, so it perhaps reflects an earlier tradition.

Macsen Wledig, the Emperor of Rome, dreams one night of a lovely maiden in a wonderful, far-off land. Awakening, he sends his men all over the earth in search of her. With much difficulty they find the maiden in a rich castle in Wales, Segontium (Caernarfon), and lead the Emperor to her. Everything he finds is exactly as in his dream, including the presence of her young, &quot;gwyddbwyll&quot;-playing brothers Cynan (Conan Meriadoc) and Gadeon, as well as her father, king Eudaf Hen, son of Caradawc (Caradog ap Bran). The maiden, whose name is Helen or &quot;Elen Llwyddawc&quot;, accepts and loves him. Because Elen is found a virgin, Macsen gives her father sovereignty over the island of Britain and orders three castles built for his bride. In Macsen&#x27;s absence, a new emperor seizes power and warns him not to return. With the help of men from Britain led by Cynan and Gadeon, Macsen marches across Gaul and Italy and recaptures Rome. In gratitude to his British allies, Macsen rewards them with a portion of Gaul that becomes known as Brittany.

==Medieval Welsh Genealogies and Triads==
Eudaf appears in a number of medieval Welsh genealogies and Triads including:

===Genealogies from Jesus College MS 20===
====The lineage of Saint Cattwg (&quot;Llyma weithon ach Cattwc sant&quot;)====
Kynan son of Eudaf son of Custenin son of Maxen son of Maximianus son of Constantinus son of Custeint.

====Family of Cunedda (&quot;Plant Cunedda&quot;)====
The wife of Coel Hen was daughter of Gadeon son of Eudaf Hen (&quot;Gwreic Coyl hen oed verch Gadeon m Eudaf hen vchot&quot;).

====Lineage of Morgan son of Owein (&quot;Ach Morgan ab Owein&quot;)====
Gereint son of Erbin son of [Custennin son of] Kynwawr son of Tudwawl son of Gwrwawr son of Gadeon son of Cynan son of Eudaf Hen.

===Genealogies from Mostyn MS. 117===
Arthur son of Vthyr son of Kustenhin son of Kynuawr son of Tutwal son of Moruawr son of Eudaf son of Kadwr son of Kynan son of Karadawc son of Bran son of Llyr lletieith.

===The North Britain Triads===
====These are the three times when the Lordship of Gwynedd went by the Distaff====
One of them was Stradweul daughter of Gadean ap Cynan ab Eudaf ap Caradog ap Bran ap Llyr Llediaith; and this Stradweul wife of Coel Godebog was mother to Dyfrwr and mother to Ceneu son of Coel ().

==Medieval Welsh Poetry==
===The Gododdin===
The &quot;daughter of Eudaf &quot;Hir&quot; (&quot;the Tall&quot;)&quot; is mentioned briefly in the famous poem Gododdin of Aneirin:
:A.67 (LXVII):
:
:

:&quot;Poetry as deserved for brilliant high hosts.
:for the purpose of the courtly subjects of the mountain realm,
:and the daughter of Tall Eudaf, [there came] the violence of border fighting.
:The breakers of countries were dressed in purple.&quot;

===Lewis Glyn Cothi===
The poet Lewis Glyn Cothi (&quot;fl.&quot; 1447-86 CE), in an ode to Dafydd ap Sion of Gower, compares his subject to Macsen Wledig and his bride Gwenllian (daughter of Jenkin son of Owen) to Elen daughter of Eudaf:
:XXXVI, &quot;I Davydd ap Sion, o Vro Wyr&quot;, l. 51:
:&quot;Ail yw Gwenllian Elen verch Eudav&quot;;
:&quot;Gwenllian is a second Elen daughter of Eudaf&quot;

<text>Winchester Magnum refers to a &quot;family&quot; of belted magnum cartridges developed by the Winchester Repeating Arms Company, one of the oldest firearms manufacturers in the United States, in the late 1950s and early 1960s, all based on the same basic cartridge case derived from the .375 Holland &amp; Holland Magnum. The basic case was a &quot;short&quot; magnum, meaning it would work through a standard (i.e.; .30-06 Springfield) length rifle action rather than requiring the longer, magnum (i.e. .375 Holland &amp; Holland) actions. Nowadays, these are considered standard length, as the short length cartridges are classified as those who have similar dimensions to the .308 Winchester. 
==Dimensions==
The dimensions of the basic case are:

Originally known as a &quot;short&quot; magnum as compared to the .375 H&amp;H Magnum, this is now considered the &quot;long&quot; magnum since the development of the family of Winchester Short Magnums. So today you would consider the .300 Winchester Magnum to be a &quot;long action&quot; cartridge.

== History ==
Before the introduction of Winchester Magnum family of cartridges, most cartrdiges offering a &quot;Magnum&quot; performance were restricted to Holland &amp; Holland cartridges and Weatherby proprietary catridges, either requiring a full-length magnum action or being chambered exclusively in high end rifles.

With the introduction of Winchester Magnum cartridges, during the 50s, hunters around the world could afford taking advantage of these cartridges available in large scale production rifles such manufactured around a standard length action.

The first to come was the .458 Winchester Magnum, a large bore centerfire cartridge released along with the resurge of the interest for the African Safari by the North American sports hunter inspired by Hemingway and Ruark&#x27;s writings as well as by the post war booming. The .458 Win Mag was first released along with the Winchester Model 70 Safari Express rifle.

A couple of years later the .338 Winchester Magnum is released along with the Winchester Model 70 Alaskan model, just by when Alaska, the last hunting fronteer, was founded as a State. The .338 Win Mag was marketed as the ideal cartridge for big game hunting in Alaska, especially a bear cartridge that was also suitable for a large variety of native game such as moose, caribou, dall ram and blacktail deer.

A year later and ahead of its time, the .264 Winchester Magnum was introduced along with the 26-inch barrel Winchester Model 70 &quot;Westerner&quot; rifle, which offered a very flat trajectory ideal for long range shots. The .264 Win Mag offered different bullet alternatives suitable for hunting mid sized big game as well as varmints. However, the .264 Win Mag popularity was short lived due to Remington&#x27;s introduction of the 7mm Remington Magnum, a belted magnum with a similar case necked up to accept .284&quot; bullets.

Due to the gaining popularity of the 7mm Rem Mag, in 1963 Winchester launches the last member of the Winchester Magnum family of cartridges; the .300 Winchester Magnum; a standard length action belted magnum driving a 180 grain bullet at 3000 fps and a 150 grain bullet at a muzzle velocity of 3300 fps. The cartridge took off slowly but managed to gain popularity along the years to become the most popular &quot;magnum&quot; cartridge and one of the most popular big game cartridges in the world up to date, mainly due to its versatility, flat trajectory and long range capability, pulling interest not only among hunters but, bench rest shootes, law enforcement and military units around the globe.

==Cartridge list==
The cartridges in this family are, in the order of development:
*.458 Winchester Magnum (1956): bullet
*.338 Winchester Magnum (1958): bullet
*.264 Winchester Magnum (1959): bullet
*.300 Winchester Magnum (1963): bullet

With the exception of the .264 Win Mag, all of these cartridges are still widely used and among the most popular big game cartridges around the world. The .458 Win Mag has become the #1 cartridge for dangerous game in Africa, as well as a very popular round with Alaskan/Canadian bear guides. The .338 is widely used for game ranging from elk and African plains game to dangerous game such as grizzly/brown bears and African lions. The .300 Win Mag is one of the most popular cartridges in the world, used for everything from deer to brown bears and seeing military use as a sniper caliber. It is the most popular round for hunting large Alaskan game, and is considered to be a true round for all North American game, including the kodiak bears.

<text>An aortic aneurysm is an enlargement (dilatation) of the aorta to greater than 1.5 times normal size. Typically, there are no symptoms except when the aneurysm dissects or ruptures, which causes sudden, severe pain in the abdomen and lower back.

The etiology remains an area of active research. Known causes include trauma, infection, and inflammatory disorders. Risk factors include cigarette smoking, extreme alcoholism, advanced age, dyslipidemia, hypertension, and coronary artery disease. The pathophysiology of the disease is related to an initial arterial insult causing a cascade of inflammation and extracellular matrix protein breakdown by proteinases leading to arterial wall weakening. They are most commonly located in the abdominal aorta, but can also be located in the thoracic aorta.

Aortic aneurysms result from a weakness in the wall of the aorta and increase the risk of aortic rupture. When rupture occurs, massive internal bleeding results and, unless treated immediately, shock and death can occur. One review stated that up to 81% of people having abdominal aortic aneurysm rupture will die, with 32% dying before reaching a hospital.

According to a review of global data through 2019, the prevalence of abdominal aortic aneurysm worldwide was about 0.9% in people under age 79 years, and is about four times higher in men than in women at any age. Death occurs in about 55-64% of people having rupture of the AAA.

Screening with ultrasound is indicated in those at high risk. Prevention is by decreasing risk factors, such as smoking, and treatment is either by open or endovascular surgery. Aortic aneurysms resulted in about 152,000 deaths worldwide in 2013, up from 100,000 in 1990.

==Classification==
Aortic aneurysms are classified by their location on the aorta.
* An aortic root aneurysm, or aneurysm of the sinus of Valsalva.
* Thoracic aortic aneurysms are found within the chest; these are further classified as ascending, aortic arch, or descending aneurysms.
* Abdominal aortic aneurysms, &quot;AAA&quot; or &quot;Triple A&quot;, the most common form of aortic aneurysm, involve that segment of the aorta within the abdominal cavity. Thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysms involve both the thoracic and abdominal aorta.
* Thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysms comprise some or all of the aorta in both the chest and abdomen, and have components of both thoracic and abdominal aortic aneurysms. The &quot;Crawford classification&quot; describes five types.

==Signs and symptoms==
Most intact aortic aneurysms do not produce symptoms. As they enlarge, symptoms such as abdominal pain and back pain may develop. Compression of nerve roots may cause leg pain or numbness. Untreated, aneurysms tend to become progressively larger, although the rate of enlargement is unpredictable for any individual. Rarely, clotted blood which lines most aortic aneurysms can break off and result in an embolus.

Aneurysms cannot be found on physical examination. Medical imaging is necessary to confirm the diagnosis and to determine the anatomic extent of the aneurysm. In people presenting with aneurysm of the arch of the aorta, a common sign is a hoarse voice from stretching of the left recurrent laryngeal nerve, a branch of the vagus nerve that winds around the aortic arch to supply the muscles of the larynx.

===Abdominal aortic aneurysm===
Abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs) are more common than their thoracic counterpart. One reason for this is that elastin, the principal load-bearing protein present in the wall of the aorta, is reduced in the abdominal aorta as compared to the thoracic aorta. Another is that the abdominal aorta does not possess vasa vasorum, the nutrient-supplying blood vessels within the wall of the aorta. Most AAA are &quot;true aneurysms&quot; that involve all three layers (tunica intima, tunica media and tunica adventitia). The prevalence of AAAs increases with age, with an average age of 65–70 at the time of diagnosis. AAAs have been attributed to atherosclerosis, though other factors are involved in their formation. Risk factors for AAA include the male gender, aging, a history of smoking, hypercholesterolemia, and hypertension. Reviews reported estimates for prevalence rates of AAA were 0.9-9% in men and 1–2% in women, where, generally, the incidence of AAA is four times greater in men compared to women at the same age.
The risk of rupture of an AAA is related to its diameter; once the aneurysm reaches about 5 cm, the yearly risk of rupture may exceed the risks of surgical repair for an average-risk patient. Rupture risk is also related to shape; so-called &quot;fusiform&quot; (long) aneurysms are considered less rupture-prone than &quot;saccular&quot; (shorter, bulbous) aneurysms, the latter having more wall tension in a particular location in the aneurysm wall.

The prevalence of AAA worldwide in 2019 was about 0.9% in people under age 79 years, whereas a 2014 review reported a range of 2-12%, occurring in about 8% of men more than 65 years of age. Men are about four times more likely to have AA compared to women at any age, with death occurring in about 55-64% of people having AAA rupture.

Before rupture, an AAA may present as a large, pulsatile mass above the umbilicus. A bruit may be heard from the turbulent flow in the aneurysm. Rupture may be the first sign of AAA. Once an aneurysm has ruptured, it presents with classic symptoms of abdominal pain which is severe, constant, and radiating to the back.

The diagnosis of an abdominal aortic aneurysm can be confirmed by the use of ultrasound. Rupture may be indicated by the presence of free fluid in the abdomen. A contrast-enhanced abdominal CT scan is the best test to diagnose an AAA and guide treatment options.

In 2019, some 170,000 people worldwide died from AAA rupture, with aging, smoking, and hypertension as principal factors. Annual mortality from ruptured aneurysms in the United States is about 15,000.

===Aortic rupture===

An aortic aneurysm can rupture from wall weakness. Aortic rupture is a surgical emergency and has a high mortality even with prompt treatment. Weekend admission for a ruptured aortic aneurysm is associated with increased mortality compared with admission on a weekday, and this is likely due to several factors including a delay in prompt surgical intervention.

==Risk factors==
* Coronary artery disease
* Hypertension
* Loeys-Dietz Syndrome
* Hypercholesterolemia
* Hyperhomocysteinemia
* Elevated C-reactive protein
* Tobacco use
* Alcohol use
* Peripheral vascular disease
* Marfan syndrome
* Fluoroquinolone use
* Ehlers-Danlos type IV
* Bicuspid Aortic Valve
* Syphilis
* IgG4-related disease
* Pregnancy
* Chronic obstructive sleep apnea
* Psoriasis

==Pathophysiology==

An aortic aneurysm can occur as a result of trauma, infection, or, most commonly, from an intrinsic abnormality in the elastin and collagen components of the aortic wall. Aortic aneurysm development and progression have been directly associated with a deficiency of elastin as well as a loss of collagen type 1. The elastin-to-collagen ratio is also significantly higher in aneurysmal abdominal aortas compared to healthy abdominal aortas. While definite genetic abnormalities were identified in true genetic syndromes (Marfan, Elher-Danlos and others) associated with aortic aneurysms, both thoracic and abdominal aortic aneurysms demonstrate a strong genetic component in their aetiology.

==Prevention==
The risk of aneurysm enlargement may be diminished with attention to the patient&#x27;s blood pressure, smoking and cholesterol levels. There have been proposals to introduce ultrasound scans as a screening tool for those most at risk: men over the age of 65.

Anacetrapib is a cholesteryl ester transfer protein inhibitor that raises high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol and reduces low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol.
Anacetrapib reduces progression of atherosclerosis, mainly by reducing non-HDL-cholesterol, improves lesion stability and adds to the beneficial effects of atorvastatin
Elevating the amount of HDL cholesterol in the abdominal area of the aortic artery in mice both reduced the size of aneurysms that had already grown and prevented abdominal aortic aneurysms from forming at all. In short, raising HDL cholesterol is beneficial because it induces programmed cell death. The walls of a failing aorta are replaced and strengthened. New lesions should not form at all when using this drug.

==Screening==
Screening for an aortic aneurysm so that it may be detected and treated prior to rupture is the best way to reduce the overall mortality of the disease. The most cost-efficient screening test is an abdominal aortic ultrasound study. Noting the results of several large, population-based screening trials, the US Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) now provides payment for one ultrasound study in all smokers aged 65 years or older (&quot;SAAAVE Act&quot;).

==Management==
Surgery (open or endovascular) is the definitive treatment of an aortic aneurysm. Medical therapy is typically reserved for smaller aneurysms or for elderly, frail patients where the risks of surgical repair exceed the risks of non-operative therapy (observation alone).

===Medical therapy===
Medical therapy of aortic aneurysms involves strict blood pressure control. This does not treat the aortic aneurysm per se, but control of hypertension within tight blood pressure parameters may decrease the rate of expansion of the aneurysm.

The medical management of patients with aortic aneurysms, reserved for smaller aneurysms or frail patients, involves cessation of smoking, blood pressure control, use of statins and occasionally beta blockers. Ultrasound studies are obtained on a regular basis (i.e. every 6 or 12 months) to follow the size of the aneurysm.

Despite optimal medical therapy, patients with large aneurysms are likely to have continued aneurysm growth and risk of aneurysm rupture without surgical repair.

===Surgery===
Decisions about repairing an aortic aneurysm are based on the balance between the risk of aneurysm rupture without treatment versus the risks of the treatment itself. For example, a small aneurysm in an elderly patient with severe cardiovascular disease would not be repaired. The chance of the small aneurysm rupturing is overshadowed by the risk of cardiac complications from the procedure to repair the aneurysm.

The risk of the repair procedure is two-fold. First, there is consideration of the risk of problems occurring during and immediately after the procedure itself (&quot;peri-procedural&quot; complications). Second, the effectiveness of the procedure must be taken into account, namely whether the procedure effectively protects the patient from aneurysm rupture over the long term, and whether the procedure is durable so that secondary procedures, with their attendant risks, are not necessary over the life of the patient. A less invasive procedure (such as endovascular aneurysm repair) may be associated with fewer short-term risks to the patient (fewer peri-procedural complications) but secondary procedures may be necessary over long-term follow-up.

The determination of surgical intervention is determined on a per-case basis. The diameter of the aneurysm, its rate of growth, the presence or absence of Marfan syndrome, Ehlers–Danlos syndromes or similar connective tissue disorders, and other co-morbidities are all important factors in the overall treatment.

A large, rapidly expanding, or symptomatic aneurysm should be repaired, as it has a greater chance of rupture. Slowly expanding aortic aneurysms may be followed by routine diagnostic testing (i.e.: CT scan or ultrasound imaging).

For abdominal aneurysms, the current treatment guidelines for abdominal aortic aneurysms suggest elective surgical repair when the diameter of the aneurysm is greater than . However, recent data on patients aged 60–76 suggest medical management for abdominal aneurysms with a diameter of less than .

====Open surgery====

Open surgery starts with exposure of the dilated portion of the aorta via an incision in the abdomen or abdomen and chest, followed by insertion of a synthetic (Dacron or Gore-Tex) graft (tube) to replace the diseased aorta. The graft is sewn in by hand to the non-diseased portions of the aorta, and the aneurysmal sac is closed around the graft.

The aorta and its branching arteries are cross-clamped during open surgery. This can lead to inadequate blood supply to the spinal cord, resulting in paraplegia. A 2004 systematic review and meta analysis found that cerebrospinal fluid drainage (CFSD), when performed in experienced centers, reduces the risk of ischemic spinal cord injury by increasing the perfusion pressure to the spinal cord. A 2012 Cochrane systematic review noted that further research regarding the effectiveness of CFSD for preventing a spinal cord injury is required. A 2023 systematic review suggested that rates of postoperative spinal cord ischaemia can be kept at low levels after open repair of thoracoabdominal aneurysm with the adequate precautions and perioperative manoeuvres. The majority of the surgeons believe prophylactic lumbar drains are effective in reducing spinal cord ischaemia. Neuromonitoring with motor-evoked potentials (MEP) can provide the surgeon objective criteria to direct selective intercostal reconstruction or other protective anaesthetic and surgical manoeuvres. Simultaneous monitoring of MEP and somatosensory-evoked potentials (SSEP) seems to be the most reliable method.

====Endovascular====

Endovascular treatment of aortic aneurysms is a minimally invasive alternative to open surgery repair. It involves the placement of an endo-vascular stent through small incisions at the top of each leg into the aorta.

As compared to open surgery, EVAR has a lower risk of death in the short term and a shorter hospital stay but may not always be an option. There does not appear to be a difference in longer term outcomes between the two. After EVAR, repeat procedures are more likely to be needed.

==Epidemiology==
Globally, aortic aneurysms resulted in about ~170,000 deaths in 2017. This figure represents an increase from approximately ~100,000 in 1990.

<text>A phagemid or phasmid is a DNA-based cloning vector, which has both bacteriophage and plasmid properties. These vectors carry, in addition to the origin of plasmid replication, an origin of replication derived from bacteriophage. Unlike commonly used plasmids, phagemid vectors differ by having the ability to be packaged into the capsid of a bacteriophage, due to their having a genetic sequence that signals for packaging. Phagemids are used in a variety of biotechnology applications; for example, they can be used in a molecular biology technique called &quot;phage display&quot;.

The term &quot;phagemid&quot; or &quot;phagemids&quot; was coined by a group of Soviet scientists, who discovered them, named them, and published the article in April 1984 in Gene magazine.

== Properties of the cloning vector ==
A phagemid (plasmid + phage) is a plasmid that contains an f1 origin of replication from an f1 phage. It can be used as a type of cloning vector in combination with filamentous phage M13. A phagemid can be replicated as a plasmid, and also be packaged as single stranded DNA in viral particles. Phagemids contain an origin of replication (ori) for double stranded replication, as well as an f1 ori to enable single stranded replication and packaging into phage particles. Many commonly used plasmids contain an f1 ori and are thus phagemids. 

Similarly to a plasmid, a phagemid can be used to clone DNA fragments and be introduced into a bacterial host by a range of techniques, such as transformation and electroporation. However, infection of a bacterial host containing a phagemid with a &#x27;helper&#x27; phage, for example VCSM13 or M13K07, provides the necessary viral components to enable single stranded DNA replication and packaging of the phagemid DNA into phage particles. The &#x27;helper&#x27; phage infects the bacterial host by first attaching to the host cell&#x27;s pilus and then, after attachment, transporting the phage genome into the cytoplasm of the host cell. Inside the cell, the phage genome triggers production of single stranded phagemid DNA in the cytoplasm. This phagemid DNA is then packaged into phage particles. The phage particles containing ssDNA are released from the bacterial host cell into the extracellular environment.

Filamentous phages retard bacterial growth but, contrasting with the lambda phage and the T7 phage, are not generally lytic. Helper phages are usually engineered to package less efficiently (via a defective phage origin of replication) than the phagemid so that the resultant phage particles contain predominantly phagemid DNA. F1 Filamentous phage infection requires the presence of a pilus so only bacterial hosts containing the F-plasmid or its derivatives can be used to generate phage particles.

Prior to the development of cycle sequencing, phagemids were used to generate single stranded DNA template for sequencing purposes. Today phagemids are still useful for generating templates for site-directed mutagenesis. Detailed characterisation of the filamentous phage life cycle and structural features lead to the development of phage display technology, in which a range of peptides and proteins can be expressed as fusions to phage coat proteins and displayed on the viral surface. The displayed peptides and polypeptides are associated with the corresponding coding DNA within the phage particle and so this technique lends itself to the study of protein-protein interactions and other ligand/receptor combinations.

<text>Järvenpää (; , ; ) is a town in Finland, located in the southern interior of the country. Järvenpää is situated in the centre of the Uusimaa region in the immediate vicinity of Lake Tuusula. The population of Järvenpää is approximately . It is the most populous municipality in Finland. Järvenpää is part of the Helsinki Metropolitan Area, which has approximately  million inhabitants.

Järvenpää is located on the Helsinki-Riihimäki railway line in the Uusimaa region, about north of Helsinki. Neighbouring municipalities are Tuusula, Sipoo and Mäntsälä. People also refer to Kerava as Järvenpää&#x27;s neighbour, although technically they do not share a border due to the one kilometre-wide strip of land that belongs to Tuusula.

==History==
The first documented mention of the village of Järvenpää is found in a tax list from 1540, where it is named in Swedish as ; starting from the next decade, its Finnish name was used in parallel, in forms such as &quot;Jerffuepä&quot; or &quot;Järuenpää&quot;. Around this time, the village was documented to consist of eight estates. Prior to being transferred to the newly formed chapel of Tuusula in 1643, Järvenpää was part of the parish of Sipoo; Tuusula, in turn, became an independent pastorate () in 1654.

While the population in Järvenpää had long been stagnant, it had started expanding again by the late 1700s, thanks to the evolution of agriculture at the time. In the middle of the 1800s, Järvenpää together with Nummenkylä formed the most populous village of Tuusula with around 450 inhabitants. Thanks to its location on the road between Helsinki and Mäntsälä, the village had grown into a minor concentration of commerce, with the presence of a - a type of tavern - and several craftsmen. Thanks to these factors, one of the original intermediate stations of the Helsinki–Riihimäki railway was placed in Järvenpää.

Järvenpää was separated from its parent community Tuusula in 1951. Järvenpää was granted the status of a market town (kauppala) after the separation. Neighbouring districts Kellokoski and Nummenkylä were not added to the municipality of Järvenpää, and controversy over this decision exists to this day. In the event, Kellokoski remained part of the municipality of Tuusula. Bjarne Westermarck developed Järvenpää and is considered to be the founder of the town and was honored at its centennial celebrations by the release of a book about Järvenpää. Järvenpää was granted full legal town (kaupunki) status in 1967.

Järvenpää is widely known as the location of Ainola, the home of the composer Jean Sibelius and his wife Aino (née Järnefelt). It is situated about two kilometers south of the city centre. The composer moved with his family to the cottage designed by Lars Sonck on September 24, 1904, and he lived there until his death in 1957. Ainola is open for visitors in the summer months as the &quot;museum of Sibelius&quot;.

Juhani Aho moved with his wife Venny Soldan-Brofeldt to Järvenpää in 1897. They lived there for fourteen years in a villa, called &#x27;, next to the shore of Lake Tuusula. The villa was later called &#x27;.

<text>Zvonimir Boban (; born 8 October 1968) is a Croatian former professional footballer who works at UEFA as the Chief of Football. A midfielder, Boban played most of his career for Italian club AC Milan with whom he won four Serie A titles and one UEFA Champions League title. He also captained the Croatia national team which won third place at the 1998 FIFA World Cup.

Before 1990 and the international recognition of Croatia&#x27;s national team, Boban had played for the Yugoslavia under-20 team which won the 1987 World Youth Championship. Boban scored three times in this tournament, as well as scoring in the final (drawn 1–1 with West Germany) and then converting the decisive penalty in the shootout. Having made his debut for the senior Yugoslavia team in 1988, Boban switched to playing for Croatia after the national team&#x27;s inception, debuting against Romania in December 1990. Having appeared seven times for Yugoslavia, scoring once, Boban was capped 49 times for Croatia, scoring 12 goals, between 1992 and 1999.

Since retiring from playing in 2002, Boban gained a history degree from the University of Zagreb. He has also become a football pundit on Croatian and Italian television, working most notably for Sky Italia and RTL Televizija.

==Club career==

===Dinamo Zagreb===
Born in Imotski, Boban started his career with Dinamo Zagreb. He made his debut for the team in the 1985–86 season, aged 16. He would play 109 games for the club over six seasons, scoring 45 goals and becoming club captain aged 19.

====Dinamo Zagreb–Red Star Belgrade riot====

In a game against Red Star Belgrade on 13 May 1990, Boban kicked a police officer in the face for assaulting a Dinamo supporter after a riot broke out in the stadium. This incident made Boban an icon of resistance in Croatia.

It is cited by some as the expression of Croatian discontent with the Yugoslav regime. It also earned him a suspension from the Yugoslav national team, causing him to miss the 1990 World Cup in Italy. In January 2011, the match (due to the incident) was named by CNN as one of &quot;five football games that changed the world&quot;. The police officer (who turned out to be a Bosniak) later forgave Boban for his action.

===Serie A===
AC Milan signed Boban in 1991 in a deal worth £8 million. Milan immediately loaned him to Bari, as they felt he needed time to settle in Italy without counting as one of the 3 non-Italian players the club was limited to at the time. Bari were relegated in this season, but Boban ably demonstrated his ability in the team and was recalled to Milan. He stayed in the club for nine seasons, and enjoyed great success with them, helping the team to the 1994 Champions League title and contributing to the 1995 campaign in which they ended as runners-up. Playing 251 games for Milan and scoring 30 goals, Boban won four Serie A titles, as well as three Italian Supercups. In the second leg of the 1994 UEFA Super Cup final against Arsenal in Milan, he scored the opening goal in Milan&#x27;s 2–0 aggregate victory. In August 2001, with his role at Milan diminished due to the signing of Rui Costa, he was loaned to La Liga side Celta Vigo where he played in only four league matches. Unhappy with his role as a substitute, he retired in October 2001 and finished his last season earlier than he intended.

==International career==

===Yugoslavia===
Boban played a big part in Yugoslavia&#x27;s win in 1987 World Youth Championship. He scored three goals for Yugoslavia in this tournament, and also scored a decisive penalty in the final shootout. At the full international level, he earned seven caps for Yugoslavia between 1988 and 1991, debuting against the Republic of Ireland on 27 April 1988. He played his last game for Yugoslavia on 16 May 1991 against the Faroe Islands, during which he scored his only goal for Yugoslavia.

===Croatia===
When the nation of Croatia declared its independence of Yugoslavia, Boban left Yugoslavia to play for Croatia. He played his first international match for Croatia against a Romanian side on 22 December 1990. The match was considered unofficial because Croatia at that time was not affiliated to FIFA. This match was only the second fixture Croatia had played as an independent nation since 1956. Boban played his last match for the national team in a friendly against France on 13 November 1999. He blamed back pain for his decision to quit international football, but would go on to play in two more seasons of club football. In his career with the Croatia national team, Boban won 49 international caps and scored 12 goals.

====1998 World Cup====
Boban was a member of the Croatian team that finished third at the 1998 World Cup, captaining the squad at that tournament, as he had at the 1996 European Football Championship. At the tournament, he sported a slightly unusual haircut, with the number 10 (his jersey number) shaved onto the back of his head and highlighted in red dye. A mistake he made in the semi-final allowed France to equalize immediately after Croatia had fought hard to earn a one-goal lead. To make matters worse, Boban was injured and wanted to come off at half time but stayed on until the 65th minute, when he was replaced by Silvio Maric. France won the match 2–1 and eventually won the tournament. Croatia went on to defeat the Netherlands, with Boban providing the pass to Davor Šuker to score the winner, allowing Croatia to attain third place and receive the bronze medal.

==Style of play==
Nicknamed &quot;Zorro&quot;, Boban was a talented and creative yet tenacious and hard-working player, known for his use of feints to beat opponents. He was gifted with excellent vision, passing range, dribbling skills, technical ability, and an eye for the final ball; he mixed these attributes with a unique tactical versatility and intelligence, which enabled him to be deployed in several midfield and offensive positions throughout his career. In addition to his preferred playmaking role behind the forwards as an attacking midfielder, he was also capable of playing on the wing, as a central midfielder, or even as a supporting striker, due to his powerful and accurate bending shots from distance; he was also effective from set-pieces. Throughout his career, he also became known for his vocal presence, determination and aggression on the pitch, as well as his strong character.

==Post-playing career==
Boban officially retired from football in 2002 after receiving little pitch time at Celta Vigo. On 7 October 2002, Boban organised and played in a farewell testimonial, with Croatia&#x27;s 1998 World Cup team supported by tennis star Goran Ivanišević matching up against a World XI featuring such stars as Rivaldo, Marco van Basten and Lothar Matthäus.

Since retiring from football, Boban, always known to be a literary man, completed his history degree at the University of Zagreb. He graduated from the Faculty of Humanities and Social Sciences, University of Zagreb in 2004, with a thesis named &quot;Christianity in the Roman Empire&quot;.

He also started a career in sports journalism, being the administration president for the Croatian daily sports newspaper &quot;Sportske novosti&quot;, a co-commentator during live broadcasts of the Croatia national team&#x27;s away matches on the country&#x27;s commercially-funded national TV station RTL Televizija as well as a commentator for SKY Italia and columnist for &quot;La Gazzetta dello Sport&quot;. As a commentator, Boban has become known as frank and outspoken. Boban also owns a restaurant in Zagreb, called &quot;Boban&quot;.

Boban has always maintained that he would never become a coach.
===FIFA===
On 30 May 2016, Boban was appointed FIFA&#x27;s Deputy Secretary-General, focusing on developing the game and the organization of competitions. He has been immediately among the endorsers of the implementation of technology on the field and played a fundamental role in the development of the video assistant referee. In fact, during the 2018 World Cup played in Russia, the first-ever with the VAR, he lived in Moscow alongside Pierluigi Collina, chairman of FIFA&#x27;s Referees&#x27; Committee, and Massimo Busacca, head of FIFA&#x27;s Refereeing Department, thus bringing referees&#x27; world closer to the Institutions. On 14 June 2019, after three years in office, he resigned. FIFA President Gianni Infantino had words of thanks for the Croatian: &quot;I cannot thank Zvonimir enough for everything he has done for FIFA and for the game of football over the last three years by our side. Nobody embodies football better than he does and he has always worked for the good of the game. Many of the positive changes that we have made over the last three years could not have been achieved without Zvone. He has shown the same commitment, heart, and passion at FIFA that characterized his attitude on the pitch. We will miss him a lot at FIFA.&quot; One of Infantino&#x27;s collaborators at FIFA said it was a massive loss, especially now that his work was beginning to make a difference for the whole organization.

===AC Milan===
In June 2019, Boban resigned from his FIFA job to return to his former club AC Milan where he was hired as a Chief Football Officer, the closest cooperator of the club&#x27;s technical director Paolo Maldini. However, he was sacked on 7 March 2020, after he publicly criticized club CEO Ivan Gazidis, who negotiated a possible job offer with German manager Ralf Rangnick for the 2020−21 season behind Boban and Maldini&#x27;s backs.

===UEFA===
In April 2021, Boban was hired by UEFA as the Chief of Football, first ever person to hold that position.

==Personal life==
Boban married Leonarda Lončar, a fashion designer, in 1994. They have five children: adopted children Marija, Gabrijel, Marta, Rafael, and a biological daughter Ruža (Rose). In 2021, the couple separated.

Boban is also a keen tennis player. He is known to be close friends with Goran Ivanišević, with whom he plays at his private indoor clay tennis court.

<doc id="779075" wikidata="Q2715462" url="?curid=779075" title="And the Ass Saw the Angel">
<text>And the Ass Saw the Angel is the first novel by the Australian musician and singer Nick Cave, originally published in 1989 by Black Spring Press in the United Kingdom and HarperCollins in the United States. It was re-published in 2003 by 2.13.61. A luxury &quot;collector&#x27;s edition&quot; was released, in the summer of 2007, by Black Spring Press.

The title is a biblical quotation from the Book of Numbers, Chapter 22, Verses 23-31: &quot;And the ass saw the angel of the Lord standing in the way, ...&quot;. With its Southern Gothic setting, critics have compared it favorably with novels by American authors William Faulkner and Flannery O&#x27;Connor.

Cave&#x27;s second novel, &quot;The Death of Bunny Munro&quot;, was published in September 2009.

In 2009, &quot;Nick Cave: The Exhibition&quot; toured nationally in Australia. The exhibition - which displayed original lyrics, notebooks, artwork, photography and books, as well as objects from Cave&#x27;s own library and office - included Cave&#x27;s original manuscript of &quot;And the Ass Saw the Angel.&quot;

==Origin==

The origin of &quot;And the Ass Saw the Angel&quot; was an unfilmed screenplay by Cave and Evan English titled &quot;Swampland&quot; (a song bearing that title appeared on the &quot;Mutiny!&quot; EP released by Cave&#x27;s band, &quot;The Birthday Party&quot;, in 1983). When the film project fell through, Cave expanded the script into a novel. Cave&#x27;s essay &quot;The Flesh Made Word&quot; - written for a radio broadcast by BBC Radio 3 in 1996 and reprinted in &quot;King Ink II&quot; in 1997 - includes Cave&#x27;s recollection of writing &quot;And the Ass Saw the Angel&quot;:

==Plot==
&quot;And the Ass Saw the Angel&quot; tells the story of Euchrid Eucrow, a mute born to an abusive drunken mother and a father obsessed with animal torture and the building of dangerous traps. The family live in a valley of fanatically religious Ukulites, where they are shunned. Euchrid&#x27;s mental breakdown includes horrific angelic visions, and the story builds towards Euchrid exacting terrible vengeance on the people who have made him suffer.

==Major themes==
The lyrics of some of the songs from the first few albums of Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds (&quot;From Her to Eternity&quot;, &quot;The Firstborn Is Dead&quot; and &quot;Your Funeral... My Trial&quot;), are extensions of the ideas represented in the novel. 
The title comes from the Bible, the Book of Numbers 22:23, where Balaam does not see the angel of the Lord but his donkey does. The Bible is heavily referenced throughout the novel. In an interview with BOMB magazine, Cave noted, &quot;There are a number of voices in the book: first person narrative by Euchrid, third person authorial voice, quotations usually from the Bible, either real or ersatz, constant changes in tone or approach to language, depending on who is talking. When I first started the book there were certain elements I wasn’t interested in reading about. When you read a novel, you have to wade through the setting up of the scene before the story starts. So I wrote a long prologue. It has no action. It includes documentary, poetry, maps and charts, in very short chapters. Once this is done, the actual story begins. The voice then changes between the narrator’s truth and Euchrid’s delusionary truth. The final book is Euchrid’s monologue which runs to the climax&quot; The book is narrated in the protagonist&#x27;s silent Southern drawl, which Cave writes in eye dialect.

One particularly present theme is Man&#x27;s inhumanity to man and their innate ability to fear what they do not understand. Euchrid is constantly under siege from those who perceive difference as a threat. The only other character to see Euchrid as something more than a dumb beast is Beth (and to a certain extent, her mother). Though Beth is taken into the fold by the Ukulites, she too is different from the rest. There is a transference of thought throughout the novel; her difference is seen by the community as godly, while Beth sees Euchrid as godly. Another theme presented in the novel is the beauty of things perceived as ugly. In an interview with director Lindzee Smith, Cave said, &quot;The things that are ugly are supposed to be ugly. I’d hate to think the book was only about ugly things. It’s about innocence as well ––the beauty in that. There’s a cartoon image to many of the characters––Beth, who I see as the idealized young girl, perfect and innocent, seen through the obsessive eyes of Euchrid.&quot;

<doc id="779078" wikidata="Q603598" url="?curid=779078" title="Battle of Jieqiao">
<text>The Battle of Jieqiao, also known as the Battle of Jie Bridge, was fought between the warlords Yuan Shao and Gongsun Zan in late 191 or early 192 in the late Eastern Han dynasty. It was the first significant clash of arms between the rival warlords in the contest for dominion of Ji and Qing provinces in northern China. The site of the battle is generally considered to be a site east of Guangzong County, Julu Commandery (present-day Wei County, Xingtai, Hebei).

==Background==
Late in the winter of 191, following a victorious campaign against remnants of the Yellow Turban rebels, Gongsun Zan took the pretext of his cousin Gongsun Yue&#x27;s death in the Battle of Yangcheng to declare war on Yuan Shao. His army marched southwest between the Qing and Yellow rivers into Ji Province. Very quickly a number of cities under Yuan&#x27;s control were compelled to change sides. Yuan Shao hurriedly made conciliatory gestures, in a bid to forestall a full blown war. He gave his official position as Grand Administrator of Bohai to Gongsun Fan, a cousin of Gongsun Zan. Gongsun Fan, however, took the Bohai garrison to join his clansman.

==Battle==
Soon, Yuan Shao himself came in force and the two sides met 40 km south of Jie Bridge, a crossing on the Qing River. Gongsun Zan&#x27;s army had a reported strength of 40,000, consisting of 30,000 infantry and 10,000 cavalry. He arrayed his infantry in a square and divided his cavalry between the left and right wings. In the centre were placed his &quot;white horse volunteers&quot; (), an elite mounted unit which formed the core of his fighting force. Whilst the numbers may have exaggerated, their appearance must have been impressive; &quot;Records of Heroes&quot; describes how their &quot;flags and armour lit up Heaven and Earth&quot;. Though Yuan Shao&#x27;s army was of comparable size, it consisted almost entirely of infantry. His commander Qu Yi was placed at the vanguard with 800 crack troops and 1,000 crossbowmen. Behind them stood masses of footsoldiers, numbering in the tens of thousands, commanded by Yuan Shao himself.

Observing that Yuan&#x27;s vanguard was thinly spread, Gongsun Zan ordered a charge by his cavalry. The aim was to &quot;break the enemy line&quot; - destroying the core of an opposing army and then rolling up its retreating multitudes. Qu Yi&#x27;s men hid behind their shields and awaited the onslaught. When Gongsun&#x27;s cavalry was a mere ten paces away, the crossbowmen let loose waves of bolts, followed by the foot soldiers, who rose with their spears. After a general melée, the front of Yuan Shao&#x27;s line was littered with fallen horses and Gongsun Zan&#x27;s dead. Gongsun&#x27;s general Yan Gang () was killed in the fighting. Yuan Shao&#x27;s army is said to have taken 1,000 heads. Having failed to breach the enemy line, Gongsun&#x27;s cavalry wheeled around and streamed away from the battle, followed by the infantry.

Gongsun Zan attempted to rally and hold the line at the Qing River. His rearguard clashed with Qu Yi&#x27;s men at Jie Bridge and were driven into retreat. The abandoned Gongsun camp was quickly overrun, its yak tail standard lost.

Seeing that Gongsun was all but defeated, Yuan Shao advanced with a bodyguard of several tens of crossbowmen and a hundred men-at-arms. He was caught by surprise by 2,000 horsemen who had been detached from Gongsun Zan&#x27;s main force. According to the &quot;Records of Heroes&quot;, the aide-de-camp Tian Feng was about to support Yuan Shao behind a low wall for refuge. Yuan threw his helmet to the ground, and said, &quot;A real man should die in front of the ranks. To be idle behind a wall: that is no way to live!&quot; The enemy horsemen, ignorant of Yuan Shao&#x27;s identity, were beginning to withdraw when Qu Yi arrived on the scene to drive them away. This story, somewhat detached from the main battle sequence, emphasizes Yuan Shao&#x27;s bravery.

==Aftermath==
The Battle of Jieqiao halted the southern advance of Gongsun Zan but it was by no means decisive in the protracted struggle between Gongsun and Yuan which lasted until 199. Gongsun returned a year later, in the winter of 192, along the same route. Even though the battle was a setback for Gongsun Zan, it did not significantly impact his army. Many of the soldiers who fled found their way back to Gongsun in the days and weeks after the battle.

The battle is unique in that it is described in detail in Pei Songzhi&#x27;s annotations to &quot;Records of Three Kingdoms&quot;. The arrangement of the armies and the tactics used, usually neglected by traditional Chinese histories, are reasonably clear. The battle demonstrates the ineffectiveness of even an experienced cavalry force against a disciplined infantry unit with competent leadership. It is also significant to note that although the numbers involved are very high, the actual fighting is decided by only a small elite portion of the entire army. Once the core was defeated, the demoralized masses quickly follow.

<doc id="779097" wikidata="Q188983" url="?curid=779097" title="Giorgos Karagounis">
<text>Georgios Karagkounis (; born 6 March 1977), known as Giorgos Karagounis (), is a Greek former professional footballer who played as a midfielder.

In his club career, Karagounis played for Panathinaikos, Apollon Smyrnis, Inter Milan, Benfica and Fulham.

At international level, Karagounis represented Greece between 1999 and 2014. He was a member of the UEFA Euro 2004 winning squad, and also represented Greece at UEFA Euro 2008, the 2010 FIFA World Cup, UEFA Euro 2012 and the 2014 FIFA World Cup. With 139 appearances, he is the most capped player in the history of the Greece national team.

==Early life==
Karagounis was born in Pyrgos. He grew up in Ampelonas, Elis.

He started playing football in Ampelonas FC and then to Paniliakos F.C. He was discovered by Juan Ramón Rocha in 1990 and encouraged his family to send him to the Panathinaikos academy.

==Club career==
===Panathinaikos and loan to Apollon Smyrnis===
Karagounis began his professional career in 1996 when he signed on loan for Apollon Smyrnis from Panathinaikos. In his first couple of years with the Athens-based club, he already showed signs of his talent as a very energetic player in the centre of midfield who could also score goals. After two seasons with Apollon, he returned to his parent club Panathinaikos in 1998, the club where he learned his trade.

At Panathinaikos he became a fixture in the first team for the next five years. Although Panathinaikos did not win the Alpha Ethniki title during his spell due to several controversial reasons, including a ball-fixing scandal, the team was always a title contender, and had good runs in both the UEFA Champions League and the UEFA Cup, with Karagounis scoring important goals for the team. He scored 6 times in 24 league matches during his first season with the &quot;Greens&quot;, and in the 2000–01. In the UEFA Champions League, he appeared in all 12 of Panathanaikos&#x27; games, scoring a memorable goal from a free kick against Manchester United at Old Trafford.

The following season, at the Leoforos Alexandras Stadium, Karagounis scored a wonderful goal against Arsenal, beating David Seaman with a header to help his team reach the quarter-finals of the Champions League.

===Inter Milan===
In the summer of 2003, Karagounis left Panathinaikos to join Italian Serie A club Inter Milan. During his first season with Inter, he was not a regular starter in the league, mainly appearing in European and Coppa Italia matches. At the end of his first season in Italy, despite Karagounis spending a lot of time on the substitutes&#x27; bench, Inter could only finish a disappointing fourth, with city rivals Milan winning the title. However, he performed well enough to be called up to represent Greece at UEFA Euro 2004 in Portugal.

After helping Greece win that tournament, he returned to Italy for the 2004–05 season. Under Roberto Mancini, he was again mainly used in European and domestic Coppa Italia matches rather than in Serie A matches. He won the 2004–05 Coppa Italia, helping Inter beat Roma in the final. At the end of the 2004–05 season, Inter finished third in Serie A, with Juventus winning the title. Inter also reached the quarter-finals of the Champions League, suffering elimination by Milan.

===Benfica===
In 2005, Karagounis moved to Portugal to sign a three-year contract with Benfica, who are based at the Estádio da Luz, the stadium where he won the Euro 2004 final with Greece.

Karagounis scored a couple of memorable long-range goals while in Portugal, against Shakhtar Donetsk, and a free kick against Desportivo das Aves.

Karagounis&#x27; first season at Benfica was challenging, as he had difficulty establishing himself as a first-team regular. However, he became a regular starter in his second season, putting in some excellent performances and becoming a fan favourite, who were by this time managed by Fernando Santos, who already knew Karagounis from their time together at Panathinaikos. After a successful stint with Benfica, Karagounis seemed ready to return to play in Greece, again for Panathinaikos.

Karagounis would return to the Estádio da Luz to play for a Benfica All-Stars team in a charity match against a team that included Zinedine Zidane and Ronaldo in 2010.

===Return to Panathinaikos===
Karagounis&#x27; contract with Benfica was due to expire in July 2008, but his immediate departure was negotiated due to personal issues. After his release in the summer of 2007, Karagounis immediately returned to Panathinaikos, signing for the club for the next three years. He quickly re-established himself in the team again, scoring key goals, especially in Europe.

With his acquisition by the Athenians regarded as the start of a new era at the club, Karagounis emerged not only as a leading figure at club level, but for Greece as well. He established himself as the captain of the national team. Karagounis&#x27; grit and dedication continued to give Panathinaikos an edge as the team made progress in Europe. On 3 September 2009, Karagounis extended his stay until 2012 and stated he wanted to end his career at the club. As captain of the team, he won his second Superleague title and the Greek Cup. A 79th-minute strike by Karagounis secured Panathinaikos three UEFA Europa League points in Group F.

===Fulham===
On 11 September 2012, Karagounis left Panathinaikos to join English Premier League side Fulham on a free transfer. Karagounis became the eighth Greek player from the Euro 2004-winning side to play in the Premier League, after Nikos Dabizas, Stelios Giannakopoulos, Vassilios Lakis, Theodoros Zagorakis, Angelos Basinas and Kostas Chalkias. Speaking at Fulham&#x27;s Motspur Park Training Ground, Karagounis said, &quot;I&#x27;m delighted to have signed for Fulham Football Club and I am excited by a new challenge in England and the Premier League. I&#x27;m looking forward to working under Martin Jol and playing alongside some fantastic players at this Club.&quot; Then-Fulham manager Martin Jol added, &quot;Giorgos Karagounis has a wealth of club and international experience and I&#x27;m happy that he&#x27;s joined us for this season. He&#x27;s been an influential player for his club sides and is a renowned player in world football as he&#x27;s about to become the most-capped player for Greece. He brings many certain qualities to our squad.&quot;

Karagounis made his debut for the club in the Premier League on 29 September 2012, against Manchester City at Craven Cottage, coming on in the 81st minute to replace Chris Baird. Karagounis played the full 90 minutes for Fulham in their 4–0 loss to Liverpool at Anfield. He scored his first goal in England on 5 January 2013 in the FA Cup against Blackpool in the 80th minute, with a &quot;stunning 25-yard half-volley&quot; which went in off the underside of the crossbar; the match ended 1–1. On 12 January 2013, a week after his FA Cup strike, he scored his first Premier League goal against Wigan Athletic in the 22nd minute.

Karagounis was 1 of 12 players released by Fulham at the end of the 2012–13 season.

However, Karagounis declared his interest to return to Fulham through his agent Paschalis Tountouris. On 9 July 2013, Karagounis signed a new one-year deal to rejoin Fulham. In his second season with the &quot;Cottagers&quot;, Karagounis scored his only goal in a 4–3 loss for League Cup against Leicester City when he equalised with just three minutes to play, but could not prevent Leicester from scoring a late winner. Karagounis suffered from muscle problems throughout the season, but on 19 April 2014, he came on as a substitute in his last match for the club in a 3–1 away defeat against Tottenham Hotspur. Fulham was relegated from the Premier League at the end of the season.

Karagounis was one of nine players released by Fulham in the summer of 2014, and retired from football after the 2014 FIFA World Cup.

==International career==
===Early years===
Karagounis captained Greece&#x27;s entry to the 1998 UEFA European Under-21 Championship, and the team came very close to winning, losing 1–0 to Spain in the final. After that, he soon became a regular on the national team. He made his first full international appearance against El Salvador in 1999 and went on to appear in 2002 FIFA World Cup qualification.

===UEFA Euro 2004 and beyond===
The highlight of his international career was undoubtedly winning the UEFA European Championship for Greece at Euro 2004. He was a key player for Greece and famously scored the first goal of the tournament against Portugal, a stunning long-range shot that shocked the hosts and gave Greece the confidence they needed to win the game and progress in the tournament. After winning Euro 2004, Karagounis continued to play on a regular basis for Greece in the 2005 FIFA Confederations Cup, 2006 FIFA World Cup qualification and UEFA Euro 2008. On 26 March 2008, Karagounis participated in a Greece–Portugal friendly match in Düsseldorf. This proved to be somewhat of a highlight of his international career, as he scored two almost identical well-placed free kicks to give Greece a 2–1 victory.

Karagounis, as a captain of Greece, contributed to the nation&#x27;s qualification for the 2010 FIFA World Cup. As captain, he led Greece to its first win in a World Cup match with a 2–1 win against Nigeria. On 8 October 2010, against Latvia, Karagounis reached 100 international appearances, equaling the record of his former Greece teammate Angelos Basinas. On 12 October 2010, Karagounis made his 101st appearance, becoming the second-most capped player in Greek footballing history, behind Theodoros Zagorakis, and scoring his seventh goal in the victory against the Israel national team. On 7 October 2011, Karagounis was awarded by Zagorakis and Basinas for reaching 111 appearances with Greece. The awarding ceremony took place at the Karaiskakis Stadium in Athens before Greece&#x27;s kickoff against Croatia.

===UEFA Euro 2012===
On 8 June 2012, Poland played with Greece on the opening day of Euro 2012. Poland goalkeeper Wojciech Szczęsny fouled Greek international Dimitris Salpingidis, resulting in a red card for Szczęsny. Karagounis took the penalty against substitute goalkeeper Przemysław Tytoń, who saved Karagounis&#x27; penalty.

On 16 June 2012, Karagounis started the final match of Group A against Russia, making him Greece&#x27;s joint-most capped player with 120 caps, together with Theodoros Zagorakis. Karagounis scored the only goal of the match, at the stroke of half-time. This meant Greece qualified for the next stage of the competition. The second half was slightly less dramatic but had its share of talking points. Coming off a significant goal, Karagounis made a mad dash to the Russian box. The captain looked like he was going to score another, but his leg was caught by a Russian defender. Karagounis was adamant he had earned a penalty, but the referee was not impressed and booked him for simulation. Karagounis received his second yellow card of the tournament, forcing him to miss the quarter-finals.
===Qualification for 2014 FIFA World Cup and record===
On 12 October 2012, Karagounis played in the second half in the match against Bosnia and Herzegovina in 2014 FIFA World Cup qualification, making the 121st appearance for his country. With this match, he set a new record of most caps for Greece, surpassing Zagorakis. He also scored a free-kick goal against the Liechtenstein national football team. Karagounis played another inspiring and energetic role throughout the qualifying campaign and helped lead to its third World Cup finals appearance. Despite the waning number of starts for the 37-year-old, his influence was still large for Greece. Greece head coach Fernando Santos, who worked with Karagounis at both Panathinaikos and Benfica, held him in high regard due to the sureness the veteran exudes. &quot;We have confidence and know we can beat any opponent&quot;, Karagounis said during World Cup qualifying. Karagounis played the entire 120 minutes of the match between Costa Rica and Greece for the World Cup 2014, consisting of 90 minutes of regular time and 30 minutes of extra time.

Karagounis retired from international football after Greece&#x27;s World Cup elimination in a penalty shootout loss to Costa Rica. He left as the nation&#x27;s most capped player with 139 appearances over 15 years since making his debut in 1999. Greece&#x27;s goalscorer in the Costa Rica match, defender Sokratis Papastathopoulos, paid tribute to his departing leader: &quot;He&#x27;s written his own story ... he&#x27;s the record holder [of caps], he&#x27;s given everything for the team and had to make concessions for it... He&#x27;s left us a legacy for the future. He shouldn&#x27;t worry.&quot;

==Style of play==
As a midfielder, Karagounis was short in stature, standing at 5 feet nine inches. He was largely known for his tough, gritty play on the field. He gained many comparisons to &quot;The General&quot;, Mimis Domazos. Karagounis was known for his dribbling, and creative passing, especially the accuracy of his long passes. Karagounis was described as a &quot;dogged worker in the midfield and a deliverer of fine set plays&quot;. During his career he was one of the finer set piece exponents in Europe. His dribbling was noted as one of his strengths, with Karagounis able to win his own free kicks as well as provide a sometimes-laboured attack with bursts of energy. He also possessed a shooting ability from distance and combined his varied attacking talents with an aggression in midfield that made him able to win the ball back, as well as produce with it at his feet.

<text>Xenotransplantation (&quot;xenos-&quot; from the Greek meaning &quot;foreign&quot; or strange), or heterologous transplant, is the transplantation of living cells, tissues or organs from one species to another. Such cells, tissues or organs are called xenografts or xenotransplants. It is contrasted with allotransplantation (from other individual of same species), syngeneic transplantation or isotransplantation (grafts transplanted between two genetically identical individuals of the same species) and autotransplantation (from one part of the body to another in the same person). Xenotransplantation is an artificial method of creating an animal-human chimera, that is, a human with a subset of animal cells. In contrast, an individual where each cell contains genetic material from a human and an animal is called a human–animal hybrid.

Patient derived xenografts are created by xenotransplantation of human tumor cells into immunocompromised mice, and is a research technique frequently used in pre-clinical oncology research.

Human xenotransplantation offers a potential treatment for end-stage organ failure, a significant health problem in parts of the industrialized world. It also raises many novel medical, legal and ethical issues. A continuing concern is that many animals, such as pigs, have a shorter lifespan than humans, meaning that their tissues age at a quicker rate. (Pigs have a maximum life span of about 27 years.) Disease transmission (xenozoonosis) and permanent alteration to the genetic code of animals are also causes for concern. Similarly to objections to animal testing, animal rights activists have also objected to xenotransplantation on ethical grounds. A few temporarily successful cases of xenotransplantation are published.

Bioprosthetic artificial heart valves are generally pig or bovine-derived, but the cells are killed by glutaraldehyde treatment before insertion, therefore technically not fulfilling the WHO definition of xenotransplantation of being live cells.

==History==
The first serious attempts at xenotransplantation (then called heterotransplantation) appeared in the scientific literature in 1905, when slices of rabbit kidney were transplanted into a child with chronic kidney disease. In the first two decades of the 20th century, several subsequent efforts to use organs from lambs, pigs, and primates were published.

Scientific interest in xenotransplantation declined when the immunological basis of the organ rejection process was described. The next waves of studies on the topic came with the discovery of immunosuppressive drugs. Even more studies followed Joseph Murray&#x27;s first successful renal transplantation in 1954 and scientists, facing the ethical questions of organ donation for the first time, accelerated their effort in looking for alternatives to human organs.

=== Non-human kidney to a human ===
In 1963, doctors at Tulane University attempted chimpanzee-to-human renal transplantations in six people who were near death; after this and several subsequent unsuccessful attempts to use primates as organ donors and the development of a working cadaver organ procuring program, interest in xenotransplantation for kidney failure dissipated. Out of 13 such transplants performed by Keith Reemtsma, one kidney recipient lived for nine months, returning to work as a schoolteacher. At autopsy, the chimpanzee kidneys appeared normal and showed no signs of acute or chronic rejection. 

=== Non-human heart to a human ===
An American infant girl known as &quot;Baby Fae&quot; with hypoplastic left heart syndrome was the first infant recipient of a xenotransplantation, when she received a baboon heart in 1984. The procedure was performed by Leonard Lee Bailey at Loma Linda University Medical Center in Loma Linda, California. Fae died 21 days later due to a humoral-based graft rejection thought to be caused mainly by an ABO blood type mismatch, considered unavoidable due to the rarity of type O baboons. The graft was meant to be temporary, but unfortunately a suitable allograft replacement could not be found in time. While the procedure itself did not advance the progress on xenotransplantation, it did shed a light on the insufficient amount of organs for infants. The story made such an impact that the crisis of infant organ shortage improved for that time.

=== Non-human heart, lungs, and kidneys to a human ===
The first transplant of a non-genetically modified pig&#x27;s heart, lungs and kidneys into a human was performed in Sonapur, Assam, in India in mid-December 1996, and was announced in January 1997. The recipient was Purno Saikia, a 32-year-old terminally-ill man; he died of multiple infections shortly after the operation. The Indian cardiothoracic surgeon Dhani Ram Baruah and two of his associates, Jonathan Ho Kei-shing (of the Hong Kong-based Prince of Wales Medical Institute) and C.S. James, performed the surgeries. Baruah claimed that Saikia had failed to respond to conventional surgery, and that the patient and his family had consented to the procedure.

All three involved in the surgery were arrested on January 9, 1997, for the alleged violation of the Transplantation of Human Organs and Tissues Act of 1994. Baruah was dismissed in medical circles as a &quot;mad scientist&quot; and the procedure was dubbed a &quot;hoax&quot;. Baruah himself signed a statement saying he had done no transplant, but then alleged that the confession was forced from him. They were found guilty of unethical procedure and culpable homicide and imprisoned for 40 days. Dhani Ram Baruah&#x27;s surgical institute was also found to be without necessary registration.

Critics said Dhani Bam Baruah&#x27;s claims and medical procedures were neither taken seriously nor accepted by the scientific community because he never got his findings scientifically peer-reviewed. Past complaints of ethics violations during surgeries in Hong Kong by Baruah and Ho had occurred in 1992, when they had implanted heart valves, developed by Baruah, made of animal tissue. A year later, six patients died. The Asian Medical News reported that &quot;grave concerns&quot; were expressed &quot;over the procedure and ethics of the implementation&quot;.

=== Genetically engineered non-human kidney to a human ===
In September 2021, surgeons led by Robert Montgomery performed the first genetically engineered pig kidney xenotransplant to a brain-dead human at NYU Langone Health with no sign of immediate rejection (partly because the pig thymus gland was transplanted as well). The kidney was procured from a pig with only a single gene modification: the removal of alpha-gal. 

In July 2023, surgeons from the NYU Langone Transplant Institute completed a transplant of a genetically modified pig kidney (along with the pig&#x27;s thymus gland underneath it) into a patient declared brain dead but maintained on a respirator. The patient had previously consented to be an organ donor, but his tissues were not considered suitable for transplant. The kidney came from an animal with a knocked-out gene for the production of alpha gal sugars, which has been implicated in immune response to mammalian tissue. In order to ensure that renal function was only supported by the pig kidney, the team removed both of the patient&#x27;s kidneys. The team has reported that the kidney has maintained optimal functioning for over a month, as evidenced by routine testing of creatinine and weekly biopsies. The team plans to monitor the patient for another month, pending approval by ethics board and his family.

In March 2024, Richard Slayman, a patient whose transplanted human kidney had failed, received a genetically engineered pig kidney xenotransplant from surgeons at Massachusetts General Hospital.&lt;ref name=&quot;3/21/24nyt&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;3/21/24CNN&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; This kidney has 69 genomic edits (3 gene knockout, 7 human gene insertion and 59 copies of the porcine retrovirus knockout) made by eGenesis, Inc. Mr. Slayman died a few months later of unrelated causes, with no apparent rejection of the kidney. Meanwhile, in April 2024, Lisa Pisano became the second person to receive such a kidney transplant. Because of &quot;unique challenges&quot; related to a mechanical heart pump she received along with the kidney, her kidney had to be removed due to &quot;insufficient blood flow&quot; late in May. Medication also deteriorated the kidney, which led to the organs rejection. 

=== Genetically engineered non-human heart to a human ===

In January 2022, doctors led by cardiothoracic surgeon Bartley P. Griffith and Muhammad M. Mohiuddin at the University of Maryland Medical Center and University of Maryland School of Medicine performed a heart transplant from a genetically modified pig to a terminally ill patient, David Bennett Sr., who was ineligible for a standard human heart transplant. The pig had undergone specific gene editing to remove enzymes responsible for producing sugar antigens that lead to hyperacute organ rejection in humans. The US medical regulator gave special dispensation to carry out the procedure under compassionate use criteria. The recipient died two months after the transplantation.

In June and July 2022, surgeons at NYU Langone Health performed two genetically modified pig heart transplants into recently deceased humans. The hearts were from pigs that had the identical 10 genetic modifications used in the University of Maryland Medical Center heart xenotransplantation in January 2022. All three hearts came from Revivicor, Inc., a facility based in Blacksburg, Va., and a subsidiary of United Therapeutics.

On 20 September 2023, surgeons at the University of Maryland Medical Center in Baltimore performed a heart transplant from a genetically modified pig to Lawrence Faucette, a patient with terminal heart disease who was ineligible for a traditional heart transplant. On 30 October 2023, Faucette died after showing signs of organ rejection.

==Potential uses==
A worldwide shortage of organs for clinical implantation causes about 20–35% of patients who need replacement organs to die on the waiting list. Certain procedures, some of which are being investigated in early clinical trials, aim to use cells or tissues from other species to treat life-threatening and debilitating illnesses such as cancer, diabetes, liver failure and Parkinson&#x27;s disease. If vitrification can be perfected, it could allow for long-term storage of xenogenic cells, tissues and organs so that they would be more readily available for transplant.

Xenotransplants could save thousands of patients waiting for donated organs. The animal organ, probably from a pig or baboon could be genetically altered with human genes to trick a patient&#x27;s immune system into accepting it as a part of its own body. They have re-emerged because of the lack of organs available and the constant battle to keep immune systems from rejecting allotransplants. Xenotransplants are thus potentially a more effective alternative.

Xenotransplantation of human tumor cells into immunocompromised mice is a research technique frequently used in oncology research. It is used to predict the sensitivity of the transplanted tumor to various cancer treatments; several companies offer this service, including the Jackson Laboratory.

Human organs have been transplanted into animals as a powerful research technique for studying human biology without harming human patients. This technique has also been proposed as an alternative source of human organs for future transplantation into human patients. For example, researchers from the Ganogen Research Institute transplanted human fetal kidneys into rats which demonstrated life supporting function and growth.

== Potential animal organ donors ==
Since they are the closest relatives to humans, non-human primates were first considered as a potential organ source for xenotransplantation to humans. Chimpanzees were originally considered the best option since their organs are of similar size, and they have good blood type compatibility with humans, which makes them potential candidates for xenotransfusions. However, since chimpanzees are listed as an endangered species, other potential donors were sought. Baboons are more readily available, but impractical as potential donors. Problems include their smaller body size, the infrequency of blood group O (the universal donor), their long gestation period, and their typically small number of offspring. In addition, a major problem with the use of nonhuman primates is the increased risk of disease transmission, since they are so closely related to humans.

Pigs (&quot;Sus scrofa domesticus&quot;) are currently thought to be the best candidates for organ donation. The risk of cross-species disease transmission is decreased because of their increased phylogenetic distance from humans. Pigs have relatively short gestation periods, large litters, and are easy to breed, making them readily available.
They are inexpensive and easy to maintain in pathogen-free facilities, and current gene editing tools are adapted to pigs to combat rejection and potential zoonoses. Pig organs are anatomically comparable in size, and new infectious agents are less likely since they have been in close contact with humans through domestication for many generations. Treatments sourced from pigs have proven to be successful such as porcine-derived insulin for patients with diabetes mellitus. Increasingly, genetically engineered pigs are becoming the norm, which raises moral qualms, but also increases the success rate of the transplant.
Current experiments in xenotransplantation most often use pigs as the donor, and baboons as human models. In 2020 the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved a genetic modification of pigs so they do not produce alpha-gal sugars. Pig organs have been used for kidney and heart transplants into humans.

==Barriers and issues==

=== Immunologic barriers ===
To date, no xenotransplantation trials have been entirely successful due to the many obstacles arising from the response of the recipient&#x27;s immune system. Xenozoonoses are one of the biggest threats to rejections, as they are xenogeneic infections. The introduction of these microorganisms are a big issue that lead to the fatal infections and then rejection of the organs. This response, which is generally more extreme than in allotransplantations, ultimately results in rejection of the xenograft, and can in some cases result in the immediate death of the recipient. There are several types of rejection organ xenografts are faced with, these include hyperacute rejection, acute vascular rejection, cellular rejection, and chronic rejection.

A rapid, violent, and hyperacute response comes as a result of antibodies present in the host organism. These antibodies are known as xenoreactive natural antibodies (XNAs).

==== Hyperacute rejection ====

This rapid and violent type of rejection occurs within minutes to hours from the time of the transplant. It is mediated by the binding of XNAs (xenoreactive natural antibodies) to the donor endothelium, causing activation of the human complement system, which results in endothelial damage, inflammation, thrombosis and necrosis of the transplant. XNAs are first produced and begin circulating in the blood in neonates, after colonization of the bowel by bacteria with galactose moieties on their cell walls. Most of these antibodies are the IgM class, but also include IgG, and IgA.

The epitope XNAs target is an α-linked galactose moiety, galactose-alpha-1,3-galactose (also called the α-Gal epitope), produced by the enzyme alpha-galactosyltransferase. Most non-primates contain this enzyme thus, this epitope is present on the organ epithelium and is perceived as a foreign antigen by primates, which lack the galactosyl transferase enzyme. In pig to primate xenotransplantation, XNAs recognize porcine glycoproteins of the integrin family.

The binding of XNAs initiate complement activation through the classical complement pathway. Complement activation causes a cascade of events leading to: destruction of endothelial cells, platelet degranulation, inflammation, coagulation, fibrin deposition, and hemorrhage. The result is thrombosis and necrosis of the xenograft. 

Hyperacute rejection is a severe, immediate immune response that occurs when a transplanted organ, such as a pig kidney, is rapidly attacked and destroyed by the recipient&#x27;s immune system. In the context of pig kidney xenotransplantation, this type of rejection is triggered by pre-existing antibodies in the recipient&#x27;s blood that recognize and bind to antigens on the surface of the pig kidney cells. These antigens, which are foreign to the human immune system, include certain carbohydrates and proteins that are not present in human tissues. The binding of these antibodies activates the complement system, leading to a cascade of events that cause widespread clotting and inflammation in the transplanted organ&#x27;s blood vessels. As a result, the kidney quickly becomes ischemic (lacking adequate blood flow) and undergoes acute damage, often resulting in the organ&#x27;s immediate loss.

Hyperacute rejection can severely affect the recipient’s body by leading to the rapid and complete failure of the transplanted kidney. This failure not only undermines the purpose of the transplant, which is to restore kidney function, but also poses serious health risks to the recipient. The sudden loss of kidney function can result in the accumulation of waste products and fluids in the body, causing symptoms such as swelling, electrolyte imbalances, and potential life-threatening complications. Furthermore, hyperacute rejection necessitates immediate medical intervention, often leading to the removal of the rejected kidney and the need to explore alternative treatment options, such as returning to dialysis or seeking another transplant source. Yang S, Zhang M, Wei H, Zhang B, Peng J, Shang P, Sun S.

==== Overcoming hyperacute rejection ====
Since hyperacute rejection presents such a barrier to the success of xenografts, several strategies to overcome it are under investigation:

&quot;Interruption of the complement cascade&quot;
* The recipient&#x27;s complement cascade can be inhibited through the use of cobra venom factor (which depletes C3), soluble complement receptor type 1, anti-C5 antibodies, or C1 inhibitor (C1-INH). Disadvantages of this approach include the toxicity of cobra venom factor, and most importantly these treatments would deprive the individual of a functional complement system.

&quot;Transgenic organs (Genetically engineered pigs)&quot;
* 1,3 galactosyl transferase gene knockouts – These pigs do not contain the gene that codes for the enzyme responsible for expression of the immunogeneic gal-α-1,3Gal moiety (the α-Gal epitope).
* Increased expression of H-transferase (α-1,2-fucosyltransferase), an enzyme that competes with galactosyl transferase. Experiments have shown this reduces α-Gal expression by 70%.
* Expression of human complement regulators (CD55, CD46, and CD59) to inhibit the complement cascade.
* Plasmaphoresis, on humans to remove 1,3 galactosyltransferase, reduces the risk of activation of effector cells such as CTL (CD8 T cells), complement pathway activation and delayed type hypersensitivity (DTH).

====Acute vascular rejection====

Also known as delayed xenoactive rejection, this type of rejection occurs in discordant xenografts within 2 to 3 days, if hyperacute rejection is prevented. The process is much more complex than hyperacute rejection and is currently not completely understood. Acute vascular rejection requires de novo protein synthesis and is driven by interactions between the graft endothelial cells and host antibodies, macrophages, and platelets. The response is characterized by an inflammatory infiltrate of mostly macrophages and natural killer cells (with small numbers of T cells), intravascular thrombosis, and fibrinoid necrosis of vessel walls.

Binding of the previously mentioned XNAs to the donor endothelium leads to the activation of host macrophages as well as the endothelium itself. The endothelium activation is considered type II since gene induction and protein synthesis are involved. The binding of XNAs ultimately leads to the development of a procoagulant state, the secretion of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, as well as expression of leukocyte adhesion molecules such as E-selectin, intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1), and vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1).

This response is further perpetuated as normally binding between regulatory proteins and their ligands aid in the control of coagulation and inflammatory responses. However, due to molecular incompatibilities between the molecules of the donor species and recipient (such as porcine major histocompatibility complex molecules and human natural killer cells), this may not occur.

==== Overcoming acute vascular rejection ====
Due to its complexity, the use of immunosuppressive drugs along with a wide array of approaches are necessary to prevent acute vascular rejection, and include administering a synthetic thrombin inhibitor to modulate thrombogenesis, depletion of anti-galactose antibodies (XNAs) by techniques such as immunoadsorption, to prevent endothelial cell activation, and inhibiting activation of macrophages (stimulated by CD4+ T cells) and NK cells (stimulated by the release of Il-2). Thus, the role of MHC molecules and T cell responses in activation would have to be reassessed for each species combo.

==== Accommodation ====
Accommodation, which is the survival of the xenograft despite the presence of circulating XNAs, is possible if hyperacute and acute vascular rejection are avoided. The graft is given a break from humoral rejection when the complement cascade is interrupted, circulating antibodies are removed, their function is changed, or there is a change in the expression of surface antigens on the graft. This allows the xenograft to up-regulate and express protective genes, which aid in resistance to injury, such as heme oxygenase-1 (an enzyme that catalyzes the degradation of heme).

==== Cellular rejection ====
Rejection of the xenograft in hyperacute and acute vascular rejection is due to the response of the humoral immune system, since the response is elicited by the XNAs. Cellular rejection is based on cellular immunity, and is mediated by natural killer cells that accumulate in and damage the xenograft and T-lymphocytes which are activated by MHC molecules through both direct and indirect xenorecognition.

In direct xenorecognition, antigen presenting cells from the xenograft present peptides to recipient CD4+ T cells via xenogeneic MHC class II molecules, resulting in the production of interleukin 2 (IL-2). Indirect xenorecognition involves the presentation of antigens from the xenograft by recipient antigen presenting cells to CD4+ T cells. Antigens of phagocytosed graft cells can also be presented by the host&#x27;s class I MHC molecules to CD8+ T cells.

The strength of cellular rejection in xenografts remains uncertain, however, it is expected to be stronger than in allografts due to differences in peptides among different animals. This leads to more antigens potentially recognized as foreign, thus eliciting a greater indirect xenogenic response.

==== Overcoming cellular rejection ====
A proposed strategy to avoid cellular rejection is to induce donor non-responsiveness using hematopoietic chimerism. Donor stem cells are introduced into the bone marrow of the recipient, where they coexist with the recipient&#x27;s stem cells. The bone marrow stem cells give rise to cells of all hematopoietic lineages, through the process of hematopoiesis. Lymphoid progenitor cells are created by this process and move to the thymus where negative selection eliminates T cells found to be reactive to self. The existence of donor stem cells in the recipient&#x27;s bone marrow causes donor reactive T cells to be considered self-reactive and undergo apoptosis.

==== Chronic rejection ====
Chronic rejection is slow and progressive, and usually occurs in transplants that survive the initial rejection phases. Scientists are still unclear how chronic rejection exactly works, research in this area is difficult since xenografts rarely survive past the initial acute rejection phases. Nonetheless, it is known that XNAs and the complement system are not primarily involved. Fibrosis in the xenograft occurs as a result of immune reactions, cytokines (which stimulate fibroblasts), or healing (following cellular necrosis in acute rejection). Perhaps the major cause of chronic rejection is arteriosclerosis. Lymphocytes, which were previously activated by antigens in the vessel wall of the graft, activate macrophages to secrete smooth muscle growth factors. This results in a build up of smooth muscle cells on the vessel walls, causing the hardening and narrowing of vessels within the graft. Chronic rejection leads to pathologic changes of the organ, and is why transplants must be replaced after so many years. It is also anticipated that chronic rejection will be more aggressive in xenotransplants as opposed to allotransplants.

==== Dysregulated coagulation ====
Successful efforts have been made to create knockout mice without α1,3GT; the resulting reduction in the highly immunogenic αGal epitope has resulted in the reduction of the occurrence of hyperacute rejection, but has not eliminated other barriers to xenotransplantation such as dysregulated coagulation, also known as coagulopathy.

Different organ xenotransplants result in different responses in clotting. For example, kidney transplants result in a higher degree of coagulopathy, or impaired clotting, than cardiac transplants, whereas liver xenografts result in severe thrombocytopenia, causing recipient death within a few days due to bleeding. An alternate clotting disorder, thrombosis, may be initiated by preexisting antibodies that affect the protein C anticoagulant system. Due to this effect, porcine donors must be extensively screened before transplantation. Studies have also shown that some porcine transplant cells are able to induce human tissue factor expression, thus stimulating platelet and monocyte aggregation around the xenotransplanted organ, causing severe clotting. Additionally, spontaneous platelet accumulation may be caused by contact with pig von Willebrand factor.

Just as the α1,3G epitope is a major problem in xenotransplantation, so too is dysregulated coagulation a cause of concern. Transgenic pigs that can control for variable coagulant activity based on the specific organ transplanted would make xenotransplantation a more readily available solution for the 70,000 patients per year who do not receive a human donation of the organ or tissue they need.

=== Physiology ===
Extensive research is required to determine whether animal organs can replace the physiological functions of human organs. Many issues include:
* size – with pigs for example, organs are taken from young pigs to be of suitable size for donation, and these may still be able to grow afterwards 
* longevity – the lifespan of most pigs is roughly 15 years, currently it is unknown how xenotransplanted organs age
* hormone and protein differences – some proteins will be molecularly incompatible, which could cause malfunction of important regulatory processes. These differences also make the prospect of hepatic xenotransplantation less promising, since the liver plays an important role in the production of so many proteins
* environment – for example, pig hearts work in a different anatomical site and under different hydrostatic pressure than in humans
* temperature – the body temperature of pigs is 39 °C (2 °C above the average human body temperature). Implications of this difference, if any, on the activity of important enzymes are currently unknown.

===Xenozoonosis===
Xenozoonosis, also known as zoonosis or xenosis, is the transmission of infectious agents between species via xenograft. Animal to human infection is normally rare, but has occurred in the past. An example of such is the avian influenza, when an influenza A virus was passed from birds to humans. Xenotransplantation may increase the chance of disease transmission for 3 reasons: (1) implantation breaches the physical barrier that normally helps to prevent disease transmission, (2) the recipient of the transplant will be severely immunosuppressed, and (3) human complement regulators (CD46, CD55, and CD59) expressed in transgenic pigs have been shown to serve as virus receptors, and may also help to protect viruses from attack by the complement system.

Examples of viruses carried by pigs include porcine herpesvirus, rotavirus, parvovirus, and circovirus. Porcine herpesviruses and rotaviruses can be eliminated from the donor pool by screening, however others (such as parvovirus and circovirus) may contaminate food and footwear then re-infect the herd. Thus, pigs to be used as organ donors must be housed under strict regulations and screened regularly for microbes and pathogens. Unknown viruses, as well as those not harmful in the animal, may also pose risks. Of particular concern are PERVS (porcine endogenous retroviruses), vertically transmitted microbes that embed in swine genomes. The risks with xenosis are twofold, as not only could the individual become infected, but a novel infection could initiate an epidemic in the human population. Because of this risk, the FDA has suggested any recipients of xenotransplants shall be closely monitored for the remainder of their life, and quarantined if they show signs of xenosis.

Baboons and pigs carry myriad transmittable agents that are harmless in their natural host, but extremely toxic and deadly in humans. HIV is an example of a disease believed to have jumped from monkeys to humans. Researchers also do not know if an outbreak of infectious diseases could occur and if they could contain the outbreak even though they have measures for control. Another obstacle facing xenotransplants is that of the body&#x27;s rejection of foreign objects by its immune system. These antigens (foreign objects) are often treated with powerful immunosuppressive drugs that could, in turn, make the patient vulnerable to other infections and actually aid the disease. This is the reason the organs would have to be altered to fit the patients&#x27; DNA (histocompatibility).

In 2005, the Australian National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) declared an eighteen-year moratorium on all animal-to-human transplantation, concluding that the risks of transmission of animal viruses to patients and the wider community had not been resolved.
This was repealed in 2009 after an NHMRC review stated &quot;... the risks, if appropriately regulated, are minimal and acceptable given the potential benefits.&quot;, citing international developments on the management and regulation of xenotransplantation by the World Health Organisation and the European Medicines Agency.

==== Porcine endogenous retroviruses ====
Endogenous retroviruses are remnants of ancient viral infections, found in the genomes of most, if not all, mammalian species. Integrated into the chromosomal DNA, they are vertically transferred through inheritance. Due to the many deletions and mutations they accumulate over time, they usually are not infectious in the host species, however the virus may become infectious in another species. PERVS were originally discovered as retrovirus particles released from cultured porcine kidney cells. Most breeds of swine harbor approximately 50 PERV genomes in their DNA. Although it is likely that most of these are defective, some may be able to produce infectious viruses so every proviral genome must be sequenced to identify which ones pose a threat. In addition, through complementation and genetic recombination, two defective PERV genomes could give rise to an infectious virus. There are three subgroups of infectious PERVs (PERV-A, PERV-B, and PERV-C). Experiments have shown that PERV-A and PERV-B can infect human cells in culture. To date no experimental xenotransplantations have demonstrated PERV transmission, yet this does not mean PERV infections in humans are impossible. Pig cells have been engineered to inactivate all 62 PERVs in the genome using CRISPR Cas9 genome editing technology, and eliminated infection from the pig to human cells in culture.

===Ethics===
Xenografts have been a controversial procedure since they were first attempted. Many, including animal rights groups, strongly oppose killing animals to harvest their organs for human use. In the 1960s, many organs came from the chimpanzees, and were transferred into people that were deathly ill, and in turn, did not live much longer afterwards. Modern scientific supporters of xenotransplantation argue that the potential benefits to society outweigh the risks, making pursuing xenotransplantation the moral choice. None of the major religions object to the use of genetically modified pig organs for life-saving transplantation. Religions such as Buddhism and Jainism, however, have long espoused non-violence towards all living creatures.
In general, the use of pig and cow tissue in humans has been met with little resistance, save some religious beliefs and a few philosophical objections. Experimentation without consent doctrines are now followed, which was not the case in the past, which may lead to new religious guidelines to further medical research on pronounced ecumenical guidelines. The &quot;Common Rule&quot; is the United States bio-ethics mandate .

====History of xenotransplantation in ethics====
At the beginning of the 20th century when studies in xenotransplantation were just beginning, few questioned the morality of it, turning to animals as a &quot;natural&quot; alternative to allografts. While satirical plays mocked xenografters such as Serge Voronoff, and some images showing emotionally distraught primates – whom Voronoff had deprived of their testicles – appeared, no serious attempts were yet made to question the science based on animal rights concerns. Xenotransplantation was not taken seriously, at least in France, during the first half of the 20th century.

With the Baby Fae incident of 1984 as the impetus, animal rights activists began to protest, gathering media attention and proving that some people felt that it was unethical and a violation of the animal&#x27;s own rights to use its organs to preserve a sick human&#x27;s life. Treating animals as mere tools for the slaughter on demand by human will would lead to a world they would not prefer. Supporters of the transplant pushed back, claiming that saving a human life justifies the sacrifice of an animal one. Most animal rights activists found the use of primate organs more reprehensible than those of, for example, pigs. As Peter Singer et al. have expressed, many primates exhibit greater social structure, communication skills, and affection than mentally deficient humans and human infants. Despite this, it is considerably unlikely that animal suffering will provide sufficient impetus for regulators to prevent xenotransplantation.

==== Informed consent of patient ====
Autonomy and informed consent are important when considering the future uses of xenotransplantation. A patient undergoing xenotransplantation should be fully aware of the procedure and should have no outside force influencing their choice. The patient should understand the risks and benefits of such a transplantation. A public health dimension can also be considered.

The Ethics Committee of the International Xenotransplantation Association pointed out in 2003 that one major ethical issue is the societal response to such a procedure.

The application of the four bioethics principles is standardized in the moral conduct of laboratories. The four principles emphasize informed consent, the Hippocratic Oath to do no harm, using skills to help others, and protecting the right to quality care.

Though xenotransplantation may have future medical benefits, it also has the serious risk of introducing and spreading the infectious diseases, into the human population. Guidelines have been drafted by governments with the purpose of forming the foundation of infectious disease surveillance. United Kingdom guidelines state that patients have to agree to &quot;the periodic provision of bodily samples that would then be archived for epidemiological purposes&quot;, &quot;post-mortem analysis in case of death, the storage of samples post-mortem, and the disclosure of this agreement to their family&quot;, &quot;refrain from donating blood, tissue or organs&quot;, &quot;the use of barrier contraception when engaging in sexual intercourse&quot;, &quot;keep both name and current address on register and to notify the relevant health authorities when moving abroad&quot; and &quot;divulge confidential information, including one&#x27;s status as a xenotransplantation recipient to researchers, all health care professionals from whom one seeks professional services, and close contacts such as current and future sexual partners.&quot; The patient must abide by these rules throughout their lifetime or until the government determines that there is no need for public health safeguards.

==== Xenotransplantation guidelines in the United States ====
The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has also stated that if a transplantation takes place, the recipient must undergo monitoring for the rest of their lifetime and waive their right to withdraw. The reason for requiring lifelong monitoring is due to the risk of acute infections that may occur. The FDA suggests that a passive screening program should be implemented and should extend for the life of the recipient.

<text>Gossip Girl is an American young adult novel series written by Cecily von Ziegesar and published by Little, Brown and Company, a subsidiary of the Hachette Group. The series revolves around the lives and romances of the privileged socialite teenagers at the Constance Billard School for Girls, an elite private school in New York City&#x27;s Upper East Side. The books primarily focus on best friends Blair Waldorf and Serena van der Woodsen, whose experiences are among those chronicled by the eponymous gossip blogger. The novel series is based on the author&#x27;s experiences at Nightingale-Bamford School and on what she heard from friends.

== Publication ==
The first novel, &quot;Gossip Girl&quot;, was released in April 2002; the eleventh novel of the series was released in May 2007, with a prequel novel following in October 2007. Another follow-up novel, in which the characters return home from college for the holidays, was released in hardback format in November 2009. The original novel became the inspiration for the &quot;Gossip Girl&quot; teen drama television series, created by Josh Schwartz and Stephanie Savage, which premiered on The CW on September 19, 2007. There are now 13 novels.

In May 2008, a follow-up series, &quot;Gossip Girl: The Carlyles&quot;, began publication, following the Carlyle triplets as they begin moving to the Upper East Side. As of October 2009, four novels have been released in this series. Ziegesar created a spin-off series, &quot;The It Girl&quot;, which began publication in 2005, and Yen Press has adapted the series into a manga series titled &quot;Gossip Girl: For Your Eyes Only&quot;.

==History==
The novel that started the series, &quot;Gossip Girl,&quot; was published in paperback format in April 2002. Two new novels were released annually until the final novel, &quot;Don&#x27;t You Forget About Me&quot;, was released in May 2007, showing the main characters graduating from high school and moving on to college and other pursuits. A prequel novel, &quot;It Had To Be You&quot;, was released in October 2007 in hardcover and electronic book format. It detailed the events that occurred a year before the first novel. A box set containing the eleven novels of the series and the prequel novel, in paperback format, was released November 1, 2009. Two days later, a sequel novel, &quot;I Will Always Love You&quot; was released. The hardcover book tells the story of the main characters returning home from college for the holidays. Hachette Group re-released all of the original novels in electronic book format between 2008 and 2009.

Books nine, ten and eleven of the main series were ghostwritten.

In December 2009, Yen Press announced that it was working with Korean artist Hyekyung Baek to create a manga adaptation of the series titled &quot;Gossip Girl: For Your Eyes Only&quot;. Rather than adapting the original novels, however, the graphic novels feature original stories with the same characters. It was serialized in the company&#x27;s anthology magazine &quot;Yen Plus&quot;, from August 2010 to December 2013.

In October 2011, a parody of the series &quot;Gossip Girl: Psycho Killer&quot; written by von Ziegesar was released.

Unlike the show, Gossip Girl&#x27;s identity in the books is not known. Von Ziegesar said of the character, &quot;She was the omniscient narrator. Gossip Girl was me&quot;.

Cecily morphed the real-life high school named Nightingale Bamford into Constance Billard, and also derived St. Jude from The Allen-Stevenson School.

==Characters==
* Blair Waldorf – a beautiful and active student of her elite high school. Blair uses money and scheming to get what she wants. Blair attends Yale University, the school of her dreams, after graduating from high school. Throughout the series, she has an on-off relationship with Nate Archibald, whom she always imagined marrying. At the end of the series, Nate admits he loves her, and always will. Gossip Girl herself says that the two are just meant to be together.
*Serena van der Woodsen – an angelically attractive and charming it-girl who returns to the Upper East Side after getting expelled from boarding school. Nate&#x27;s interest in Serena causes conflict between her and her frenemy, Blair, who is also Nate&#x27;s girlfriend. In the end, Serena settles in New York City. She is an heiress to a billion dollar Dutch shipping empire and a socialite who later becomes a successful Hollywood actress.
* Nate Archibald is a wealthy, good-looking lacrosse player from St. Jude&#x27;s School for Boys. He has dated a number of girls in the series, but his only serious relationships have been with his on-again/off-again girlfriend, Blair Waldorf and her close friend Serena. After stealing his lacrosse coach&#x27;s Viagra, he relied on Blair and her alumnus father&#x27;s connections to get accepted into Yale. Nate eventually left to sail around the world with his father&#x27;s Navy mentor because he is unable to choose between Blair and Serena. In the sequel, he attends Deep Springs recommended by Chuck Bass, and then Brown University. Eventually, he professes his love for Blair over Serena, which leaves Serena heartbroken and Blair overjoyed. He and Serena got into every college that they entered for.
*Dan Humphrey is a sexy, skinny, sensitive, caffeine-addicted poet who often sees the darker side of things. A romantic whose imagination runs off wildly at the worst times, he is also over-analytical and easily frustrated. Dan was attracted to Serena when he saved her from walking into a car when she was drunk one Thanksgiving. They officially meet later at school and briefly date. Dan had experimented with homosexuality, before he began dating Vanessa Abrams (whom he had known at his old state school). He is a published writer of poetry and songs. At the end of the series, he is attending Evergreen State College in Washington. In the sequel, he transfers to Columbia University. He dated Serena van der Woodsen and Mystery Craze before settling down with Vanessa Abrams.
*Jenny Humphrey – the younger sister of Dan, a fan of Serena but has major insecurities with her huge chest. She later gets her own spinoff series, The It Girl.
*Vanessa Abrams is a budding filmmaker and the total opposite of most of her classmates, sporting a shaved head and always wears black. She has a shaky relationship with Dan Humphrey, particularly after she ends up living with the Humphrey family for a short time. At the end of the series, she is attending New York University. In the prequel, it is revealed she shaved her head in front of Blair.
*Chuck Bass is the series&#x27; handsome, lust-driven antagonist who tries to take advantage of several girls, though it is eventually revealed that he is quite possibly bisexual. He is largely despised by other characters, but due to his wealth and power, he is tolerated. Notes for a planned prequel to the series revealed that Chuck was originally called &quot;Chip Wiskers&quot;, but the name was later scrapped in favor of the more substantial sounding variation of the &quot;wood word + animal name&quot; themed moniker applied in the final draft. Plans to depict &quot;Chip&quot; as a Rhythm Gymnast were also cut, due to the overtly feminine nature of the sport. At the end of the series, he is not accepted into any college that he applied to and claims he is going to military college. However, he never arrives at the school and his whereabouts remain unknown. He later returns to New York as a changed, respectable man, albeit somewhat dependent on his wealth. In the books, Chuck is a secondary character. However, he is elevated to a primary role in its television adaptation, in which he holds an intense relationship with Blair, and is best friends with Nate and Serena.

==List of novels==

===&quot;Gossip Girl&quot;===
===&quot;Gossip Girl: The Carlyles&quot;===
==Reception==
The &quot;Gossip Girl&quot; series has received a mixed reception. 

The American Library Association selected the &quot;Gossip Girl&quot; series as Quick Picks for Reluctant Young Adult Readers in 2003. In 2008, it was also named Booklist Editors&#x27; Choice: Adult Books for Young Adults.

Despite the above, the &quot;Gossip Girl&quot; series has frequently been the center of controversy due to homosexuality, offensive language, drugs, being sexually explicit, and being unsuited to age group. The series appears on the American Library Association&#x27;s list of the one hundred most banned and challenged books from 2000 to 2009, and 2010 to 2019 (56). The series also appeared in the top ten list in 2006 (2), 2008 (7) and 2011 (9).

The criticism of the &quot;Gossip Girl&quot; series primarily revolves around whether the events depicted in the story are appropriate for the teenage audience the books attract. American author and feminist Naomi Wolf in 2006 called the books &quot;corruption with a cute overlay.&quot; Wolf also claims that &quot;sex saturates the &quot;Gossip Girl&quot; books... This is not the frank sexual exploration found in a Judy Blume novel, but teenage sexuality via Juicy Couture, blasé and entirely commodified.&quot;

Pam Spencer Holley, former YALSA President with the American Library Association (ALA), presents a different point of view, claiming simply to be &quot;happy to see teen girls reading.&quot; Confident that young girls will move onto more respected literature, Holley points out, &quot;Unless you read stuff that&#x27;s perhaps not the most literary, you&#x27;ll never understand what good works are.&quot; She went on to say, &quot;Nobody complains about the adult women who read Harlequin romances.&quot; Holley created a new ALA book list to encourage teens to consult a list of recommendations for &quot;both avid and reluctant readers, who are looking for books like Cecily von Ziegesar&#x27;s &quot;Gossip Girl&quot; series. &#x27;The books on this list are perfect for when your readers have finished with every &quot;Gossip Girl&quot; title in your library and are clamoring for another book like the Gossip Girl.&#x27;&quot;

Scholars have criticized the series as a low quality series fiction aimed at teenage girls, focused on activities such as &quot;frenzied shopping, gossiping, partying, and sexual encounters&quot;, and portraying beauty and wealth as most important and desirable qualities.

==Television adaptation==

The television adaptation of the novel series, also titled &quot;Gossip Girl&quot;, was picked up by The CW. Josh Schwartz, the creator of &quot;The O.C.&quot;, is executive producer for the project. In the show, Blake Lively plays Serena, Leighton Meester plays Blair, Chace Crawford plays Nate, Penn Badgley plays Dan, Ed Westwick plays Chuck, Taylor Momsen plays Jenny and Jessica Szohr plays Vanessa. The show is loosely based on the books and does not follow the same story line. Some key characters from the books, such as Aaron Rose or the Lord, are introduced into the show with different storylines, and some characters undergo changes to their personality and characteristics. For example, Serena&#x27;s older brother in the books, Erik van der Woodsen, is two years younger than her instead of older, and the characters of Serena, Blair, Chuck and Nate have been best friends since childhood compared to the novel series where the story&#x27;s main friendship was only between Serena, Blair and Nate; with Chuck not being one of the main characters.

In 2021 the show got a soft reboot with the series by the same name.

<doc id="779146" wikidata="Q18544941" url="?curid=779146" title="Lineman's handset">
<text>A lineman&#x27;s handset is a special type of telephone used by technicians for installing and testing local loop telephone lines. It is also called a test set, butt set, or buttinski.

==Components==
A typical lineman&#x27;s handset integrates an earpiece, a mouthpiece, a dialing interface, and a set of test leads for connecting to the telephone circuit. Originally, lineman&#x27;s handsets featured a rotary dial, but modern sets use some variant of the standard 12-button DTMF keypad and also employ an amplifier for speaker use. Most handsets are designed to be used with analog &quot;POTS&quot; lines, and have limited or no function with digital circuits. Older telephone linemen also referred to the handset as a &quot;Goat&quot;.

In addition to the basic features listed above, handsets often include one or more of:
* Speakerphone
* Redial
* A talk/monitor toggle switch
* Mute
* Hook flash button
* Tone/pulse dialing selection switch
* Low-pass filtering to prevent disruption of data communications (such as DSL)
* A mechanical hook for hanging the set from a tool belt. On some sets, it may be moved to the receiver side, mouthpiece side, or removed altogether.

==Typical use==
A lineman&#x27;s handset typically connects via a pair of test leads, not the modular connector found on most consumer telephone equipment. The test leads will feature some combination of alligator clips (to connect to bare wires), a piercing spike or &quot;bed-of-nails&quot; (for insulated wires), and something designed to fit a punch block. Adapters designed to fit other punch block types, heat coil sockets, or modular jacks may also be used.

A butt set can be connected wherever there is a line appearance—anywhere the wires are accessible. Inside the central office, this would be at a main or intermediate distribution frame. For outside plant work, this would include any serving area interface, such as a cross-connect box or aerial splice enclosure. At subscriber sites (e.g., residence), this could be inside or behind the housing of a modular connector or at the network interface.

When connected to a line, a lineman&#x27;s handset is essentially indistinguishable from regular subscriber equipment. The technician can monitor an active call, answer incoming calls, and make outgoing calls. Common tests include checking for dial tone, using ANAC to identify the line, and using a ringback number.

<text>The BSD Daemon, nicknamed Beastie, is the generic mascot of BSD operating systems. The BSD Daemon is named after &quot;software daemons&quot;, a class of long-running computer programs in Unix-like operating systems—which, through a play on words, takes the cartoon shape of a demon. The BSD Daemon&#x27;s nickname &quot;Beastie&quot; is a slurred phonetic (in American English) pronunciation of &quot;BSD&quot;. Beastie customarily carries a trident to symbolize a software daemon&#x27;s forking of processes. The FreeBSD web site has noted Evi Nemeth&#x27;s 1988 remarks about cultural-historical daemons in the &quot;Unix System Administration Handbook&quot;: &quot;The ancient Greeks&#x27; concept of a &#x27;personal daemon&#x27; was similar to the modern concept of a &#x27;guardian angel&#x27; ... As a rule, UNIX systems seem to be infested with both daemons and demons.&quot;

==Copyright==
The copyright on the official BSD Daemon images is owned by Marshall Kirk McKusick, a very early BSD developer who worked with Bill Joy. McKusick has freely licensed the mascot for individual &quot;personal use within the bounds of good taste (an example of bad taste was a picture of the BSD Daemon blowtorching a Solaris logo).&quot; Any use requires both a copyright notice and attribution.

Reproduction of the daemon in quantity, such as on T-shirts and CDROMs, requires advance permission from McKusick, who restricts its use to implementations having to do with BSD and not as a company logo, although companies with BSD-based products such as Scotgold and Wind River Systems have obtained this kind of permission.

McKusick said that, during the early 1990s, &quot;I almost lost the daemon to a certain large company because I failed to show due diligence in protecting it. So, I&#x27;ve taken due diligence seriously since then.&quot;

McKusick explained:

I prefer that the BSD Daemon be used in the context of BSD software. That is the reason that I carefully control my copyright of the BSD Daemon image to ensure that the image is not used inappropriately. I have agreed to allow the small image to appear on Wikipedia but not the larger ones. It is also why I am not going to put a Creative Commons copyright on it.

==History==
The BSD Daemon was first drawn in 1976 by comic artist Phil Foglio. Developer Mike O&#x27;Brien, who was working as a bonded locksmith at the time, opened a wall safe in Foglio&#x27;s Chicago apartment after a roommate had &quot;split town&quot; without leaving the combination. In return Foglio agreed to draw T-shirt artwork for O&#x27;Brien, who gave him some Polaroid snaps of a PDP-11 system running UNIX along with some notions about visual puns having to do with pipes, demons/daemons, forks, a &quot;bit bucket&quot; named /dev/null, etc. Foglio&#x27;s drawing showed four happy little red daemon characters carrying tridents and climbing about on (or falling off of) water pipes in front of a caricature of a PDP-11 and was used for the first national UNIX meeting in the US (which was held in Urbana, Illinois). Bell Labs bought dozens of T-shirts featuring this drawing, which subsequently appeared on UNIX T-shirts for about a decade. Usenix purchased the reproduction rights to Foglio&#x27;s artwork in 1986. His original drawing was then apparently lost, shortly after having been sent to Digital Equipment Corporation for use in an advertisement; all known copies are from photographs of surviving T-shirts.

The later, more popular versions of the BSD Daemon were drawn by animation director John Lasseter beginning with an early greyscale drawing on the cover of the &quot;Unix System Manager&#x27;s Manual&quot; published in 1984 by USENIX for 4.2BSD. Its author/editor Sam Leffler (who had been a technical staff member at CSRG) and Lasseter were both employees of Lucasfilm at the time. About four years after this Lasseter drew his widely known take on the BSD Daemon for the cover of McKusick&#x27;s co-authored 1988 book, &quot;The Design and Implementation of the 4.3BSD Operating System&quot;. Lasseter drew a somewhat lesser-known running BSD Daemon for the 4.4BSD version of the book in 1994.

===Use in operating system logos===
From 1994 to 2004, the NetBSD project used artwork by Shawn Mueller as a logo, featuring four BSD Daemons in a pose similar to the famous photo, Raising the Flag on Iwo Jima. However, this logo was seen as inappropriate for an international project, and it was superseded by a more abstract flag logo, chosen from over 400 entries in a competition.

Early versions of OpenBSD (2.3 and 2.4) used a BSD Daemon with a halo, and briefly used a daemon police officer for version 2.5. Then, however, OpenBSD switched to Puffy, a blowfish, as a mascot.

The FreeBSD project used the 1988 Lasseter drawing as both a logo and mascot for 12 years. However, questions arose as to the graphic&#x27;s effectiveness as a logo. The daemon was not unique to FreeBSD since it was historically used by other BSD variants and members of the FreeBSD core team considered it inappropriate for corporate and marketing purposes. Lithographically, the scanned Lasseter drawing is not line art and however drawn neither scaled easily in a wide range of sizes nor rendered appealingly in only two or three colours. A contest to create a new FreeBSD logo began in February 2005 and a scalable graphic which somewhat echoes the BSD Daemon&#x27;s head was chosen the following October, although &quot;the little red fellow&quot; has been kept on as an official project mascot.

Walnut Creek CDROM also produced two variations of the daemon for its CDROM covers. The FreeBSD 1.0 and 1.1 CDROM covers used the 1988 Lasseter drawing. The FreeBSD 2.0 CDROM used a variant with different colored (specifically green) tennis shoes. Other distributions used this image with different colored tennis shoes over the years. Starting with FreeBSD 2.0.5, Walnut Creek CDROM covers used the daemon walking out of a CDROM. Starting with FreeBSD 4.5, the FreeBSD Mall used a mirrored image of the Walnut Creek 2.0 image. The Walnut Creek 2.0 image has also appeared on the cover of different FreeBSD Handbook editions.

====Deprecated name====
In the mid-1990s a marketer for Walnut Creek CDROM called the mascot &quot;Chuck&quot;, perhaps referring to a brand name for the kind of shoes worn by the character but this name is strongly deprecated by the copyright holder who has said the BSD Daemon &quot;is very proud of the fact that he does not have a name, he is just the BSD Daemon. If you insist on a name, call him Beastie.&quot;

<text>JRT Pascal (Jim Russell Tyson) is an implementation of the Pascal programming language. It was available in the early 1980s on the CP/M operating system.

== History ==
At the end of the 1970s, the most popular Pascal implementation for microcomputers was UCSD Pascal, which many people considered overpriced at hundreds of dollars. The original basis for UCSD Pascal was the p-machine compiler from ETH Zurich, the originators of Pascal.

JRT was a Pascal interpreter by Jim Russell Tyson that compiled to its own pseudocode separate from UCSD Pascal p-code.

In the early 1980s various organizations developed compilers for UCSD Pascal on microcomputers. UCSD&#x27;s developers announced that they were working on a native compiler that would essentially convert UCSD from an interpreter to a compiled, native system in one step. JRT was able to get considerable attention for several months by being a much cheaper alternative to UCSD Pascal. This lasted less than a year, as Borland began selling Turbo Pascal. However, JRT was very important in that it established a low price precedent (less than ) for a Pascal implementation.

JRT advertisements promised &quot;a complete CP/M Pascal for only !&quot;, stating that &quot;this is the same system we sold for !&quot;. After receiving too many orders for it to fill—Jerry Pournelle reported in &quot;BYTE&quot; that Sarah Smith had not received the software eight months after ordering—JRT Systems filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy on 18 November 1983. The product eventually continued through a version 4 priced at and along with a Modula-2 at may have been successful had not Turbo Pascal shown up for about the same price. Turbo Pascal was a true compiler with an IDE as well as a business model that allowed it to meet customer demand. JRT was said to have later been sold under the name &quot;Nevada Pascal&quot; by Ellis Computing.

==Reception==
Pournelle in May 1983 reported that JRT Pascal 2.0 was &quot;intentionally a nonportable dialect&quot;, criticized its error handling, and advised beginners with the language to &quot;stay away from it&quot;. &quot;BYTE&quot; editors in April 1983 and January 1984 reported receiving many complaints from readers on slow delivery of JRT Pascal. Pournelle in January 1984 called version 3.0 &quot;a bargain at $29.95. Qualifications: it&#x27;s a bargain in comparison to a lot of stuff on the market, and its value depends in good part on what you intend to do with it&quot;. He reported that 3.0 &quot;has fixed most—not all, but most—of the bugs that plagued the earlier versions&quot;, and that &quot;it&#x27;s cheap for the compiler alone, and you get a bunch of useful utilities with it&quot;. Pournelle warned, however, of its &quot;nonstandard features&quot; and that based on Smith&#x27;s experience and &quot;lots of letters from readers who ordered JRT Pascal and received nothing ... for months&quot;, &quot;you must then be prepared to wait&quot; for delivery. Because of JRT, Borland at first had difficulty in persuading customers that it was shipping Turbo Pascal. Bruce F. Webster in August 1985 described JRT Pascal in the magazine as a &quot;fiasco&quot;. Jeff Duntemann stated in &quot;PC Magazine&quot; in 1984 that JRT Pascal &quot;was a terrible compiler. Besides doing great harm to the Pascal language definition, it was a bug farm, locking up my CP/M-80 computer several times an evening. Not surprisingly, JRT Systems went bankrupt late last year&quot;.

<doc id="779156" wikidata="Q122649" url="?curid=779156" title="Vrba, Žirovnica">
<text>Vrba (; ) is one of ten villages in the Municipality of Žirovnica in the Upper Carniolan region of Slovenia. It was first mentioned in written sources from 1247 and is a typical example of a compact Alpine village. The Slovene national poet France Prešeren, who was born in the village, dedicated the sonnet &quot;O Vrba&quot; to the village, the first of his &quot;Sonnets of Misfortune&quot;.

==History==

In 1940, the Prešeren House and the village were filmed for the black and white sound documentary &quot;O, Vrba&quot;. It was directed by and produced in 1941. Due to the communist-imposed ban on artistic productions, it was released only in 1945. The house was presented by Finžgar, and Oton Župančič read the poem &quot;O Vrba&quot;. Due to the news about the German assault on Poland the film has a threatening atmosphere created by clouds moving over the Karawanks mountain range.

===Mass grave===

Vrba is the site of a mass grave associated with the Second World War. The Bele Linden Mass Grave () is located in a meadow south of the settlement and west of the freeway, near a hayrack along a field road. It contains the remains of 20 people from Jesenice that were killed en route from Jesenice to Begunje na Gorenjskem.

==Church==

St. Mark&#x27;s Church stands on the outskirts of the village behind the Prešeren House. It has Romanesque foundations, but the actual structure is Gothic with an interesting apse, extensive Gothic frescoes from the 15th and early 16th century on the interior walls, a renovated wooden ceiling, and two gilded Baroque altars. On the outside wall there are also relatively well-preserved frescoes of St. Christopher, the Crucifixion, and St. George fighting the dragon from the 15th century.
==Other landmarks==
The Prešeren House, where France Prešeren and Archbishop Anton Vovk were born, is a typical example of a rural residence from the first half of the 19th century and has been in 1939 on the initiative and under the leadership of the writer Fran Saleški Finžgar arranged as a museum, dedicated to Prešeren&#x27;s life and work. The museum was opened in May that year.

The linden tree, around which there are sixteen stones, in the center of the village was the meeting place of the elders of the village, who would traditionally meet under this tree to discuss village issues.

In January 2011, the Prešeren House, St. Mark&#x27;s Church, and the linden tree were proclaimed cultural monuments of national importance by the Government of Slovenia.

==Notable people==
Notable people that were born or lived in Vrba include:
*Janez Zlatoust Pogačar, bishop of Ljubljana (1875–1884)
*France Prešeren (1800–1849), poet
*Anton Vovk (1900–1963), archbishop of Ljubljana

<text>Jones in the Fast Lane is a social simulation game for MS-DOS compatible operating systems. It was developed and published by Sierra Entertainment in 1991. Using a board game motif, the objective is to attain certain amounts of money, happiness, status, and education. The exact amounts needed are defined by the player(s) when the game begins. The game&#x27;s name and goals are a play on the concept of keeping up with the Joneses.

==Gameplay==
The game world is represented by a board game-like ring of buildings in squares, resembling a cross between &quot;Monopoly&quot; and &quot;Careers&quot;. The game can be played by up to four players, who take turns &quot;living&quot; their respective weeks. If only one player is present, he or she may play against the titular &quot;Jones&quot;.

Each player is represented by a coloured marble on the board. Players are free to move around in either direction, only limited by the time remaining per turn. Time is used up by moving to a new location and by performing actions like working, attending class, or resting. Each turn represents a week of the character&#x27;s life, during which the player decides what the character does.

On weekends, each character experiences an &quot;Oh What a Weekend&quot; event, which uses up some money (usually less than $200), or, if the player has got a computer, creates some money in the form of earnings. These events are usually based on a purchase that the player made during his or her previous week, such as attending a show if the player purchased theater or concert tickets. The event can also be random, described to the player with traditional Sierra humor, e.g. &quot;You went to Las Vegas in a $20,000 car and came back in a $200,000 Greyhound bus.&quot; If the player chooses to deposit all his or her cash in the bank at the end of week or simply ends the week with no cash then no money will be spent over the weekend.

The object of the game is to be the first player to achieve 100% success, this is achieved by reaching the top of four goals. The goals are wealth, happiness, education and career. Wealth is achieved by having a certain level of money in the bank, shares and cash in the hand, the player normally would earn this money by going to work. Happiness is achieved by achieving other goals, acquiring goods and taking time off work. Education is achieved by completing the available university qualifications, the number of qualifications the player must complete will be dependent on how high the goal level is set. Career is achieved by climbing the career ladder into a management position in a particular job.

The game does have several fail states such as when a player exits the bank or Black&#x27;s Market the player may have his or her money stolen by Wild Willy. Wild Willy, from time to time, may also rip off the Low Cost Housing apartments, taking items from all players living there, such as TV sets and VCRs. Wild Willy will never rip off the Security Apartments. Other fail states may include a bank glitch causing the loss of savings in the banks and also the loss of the players&#x27; jobs. The game also has a changing economy where prices may increase or drop including rents and wages. If prices drop the player will normally stay on the same wage but if the player changes jobs he or she may be forced to take a pay cut. The player can also choose to lock in a lower rent when prices are low and continue to pay that price for the remainder of the game regardless of increases to prices.

Most buildings feature a live-action clerk or store person who greets the player with a variety of humorous phrases, complete with lip-syncing.

==Development==
The game&#x27;s working title was &quot;Keeping Up with Jones&quot;. &quot;Jones in the Fast Lane&quot; was entirely developed as a set of storyboards before artwork or coding commenced. The &quot;board game&quot; interface was aimed at ensuring the rules were intuitive and accessible to younger or inexperienced players. The 256-color VGA graphics were impressive for the time, with most computer games still produced in 16-color EGA. Produced in 1990, its 1992 CD-ROM version was also one of the first games to run in Windows 3.1x which was released that year.

Monolith Burger, a fast food restaurant in &quot;Jones in the Fast Lane&quot;, is a reference to the restaurant of the same name in another Sierra series, &quot;Space Quest&quot;. Bill Davis, &quot;Jones in the Fast Lane&#x27;s&quot; designer, stated that it is &quot;the game you&#x27;ll bring out when friends drop by, or when the family just can&#x27;t take one more evening of &quot;Trivial Pursuit&quot;.&quot;

==Reception==
&quot;The One&quot; gave the MS-DOS version of &quot;Jones in the Fast Lane&quot; an overall score of 88%, calling it a &quot;good example&quot; of how to implement the gameplay of a board game on a computer. &quot;The One&quot; praises &quot;Jones in the Fast Lane&#x27;s&quot; graphics, music and gameplay, expressing that gameplay has a &quot;generally good feeling&quot;, noting the game&#x27;s digitized actors and the varying music for each game location, furthermore stating that &quot;Jones&quot; has &quot;first-class presentation&quot;. &quot;The One&quot; praises the computer AI, saying that it offers &quot;a challenge&quot;, as well as &quot;Jones&#x27; &quot; multiplayer, expressing that &quot;Playing the game with others incites plenty of excitement ... It&#x27;s this kind of intensely competitive atmosphere that makes &quot;Jones&quot; a winner.&quot;

&quot;Strategy Plus&quot;″s Brian Walker wrote, &quot;As in most Sierra games, the joy comes from the process of discovery, and &quot;Jones&quot; is no exception to this.&quot; He considered the game &quot;fun, and easy to play&quot;, but found it overpriced given its simplicity. Walker summarized it as &quot;one of life&#x27;s less essential purchases.&quot;

Contemporary reviews describe the game as a &quot;humorous romp through modern life&quot; and praised the graphics and clever wordplay, but noted it was essentially a computerised board game.

<text>7 Notas 7 Colores is a Spanish hip-hop group of the 90&#x27;s hailing from Barcelona.

==Biography==
7 Notas 7 Colores emerged in Barcelona in 1993, when there were few rap groups in Spain. Its members were from different towns and neighborhoods around the city: Mucho Muchacho from El Prat, Dive Dibosso from San Andrés/Sant Andreu and later member Eddy la Sombra from Sabadell.

In the beginning, only Mucho Muchacho (aka Mucho Mu) was at the mic, and Dive Dibosso dealt with the production. They were accompanied by DJ Neas on live performances, but left after the first album was released.

Later, Eddy Drammeh (aka Eddy La Sombra) joined them as a rapper; and they took Russian DJ Vadim behind the turntable. They made a song with Company Flow. After that, they started to record their albums in the United States. They were introduced to the U.S. market by Juan Brujo, from Brujeria.

They had many problems with their label, so they started their own, &quot;La Mami Internacional&quot;, releasing an album with the same title. After that, they disappeared from the rap scene, although Mucho Muchacho made a solo album, under his own label &quot;C.R.E.A.M.&quot;, called &quot;Chulería&quot;, a Spanish word for &quot;cockiness&quot;. Ray Roll, Tony Touch and Griffi also collaborated in the LP.

Nowadays, Mucho Mu works at a disco in Ibiza as a DJ.

In 2007, they announced the return of 7 Notas 7 Colores, with a new formation. DJ Vadim will be the producer, along with Mucho Muchacho and Principante, an MC from Valencia, who has a solo LP.

<doc id="779165" wikidata="Q1413570" url="?curid=779165" title="Sardana">
<text>The sardana (; plural sardanes in Catalan) is a Catalan musical genre typical of Catalan culture and danced in circle following a set of steps. The dance was originally from the Empordà region, but started gaining popularity throughout Catalonia from the late 19th century to beginning of the 20th century after the modernisation done by Josep Maria Ventura i Casas.

Men and women join together in a circle by holding hands and facing inwards to dance either the historical &quot;sardana curta&quot; (with an approximate duration of 5 minutes) or the present-day &quot;sardana llarga&quot; (with a duration of approximately 12–13 minutes). Other more unusual sardanes are the &quot;sardana de lluïment&quot; and the &quot;sardana revessa&quot;.

The steps are meticulously counted as two- or three-step movements taken sideways within the circle. The direction of the steps is alternated. The hands stay on the hip or shoulder level depending on the step structure. The pattern of the choreography has jumping intervals changing with the music. Usually there is more than one circle with varying tempo and levels of dance knowledge.

The participants are called &quot;sardanistes&quot;. Professional dancers organise themselves in &quot;colles sardanistes&quot;, &quot;colla&quot; meaning group or club. All &quot;colles&quot; are united under the &quot;Confederació Sardanista de Catalunya&quot;.

&quot;Sardana&quot; is mainly danced during festivities and on weekends. &quot;Sardanes&quot; danced during a festival are termed &quot;aplecs&quot;. Brief public dances are known as &quot;ballades&quot;. The accompanying orchestra of 11 people, a &quot;cobla&quot;, includes 10 wind instruments and a bass. One person plays the &quot;flabiol&quot; (a flute) and the &quot;tambori&quot; (a small hand drum). Since the 1980s female musicians are also allowed in the &quot;cobles&quot;.

This dance stands out from others because it allows people to join a public dance circle at any time, for anyone of any age and background who is familiar with the sardana can drop their coat and bag in the centre of the circle and join in. It is emphasised by &quot;sardanistes&quot; as the specialty of the &quot;sardana&quot;.

==History==
The origin of the Sardana is unknown. The oldest found reference to the word Sardana is from 1552. From the 16th century to the 19th century a folk dance known as sardana propagated around the territory of the present province of Girona. The sardana was a popular dance in Empordà, Rosselló and Garrotxa at the middle of the 19th century. &quot;Sardana llarga&quot; fits the prototype of invented traditions common in the Industrial Revolution. It is believed that the invented traditions are a way to stabilize cultural anchors in a time of rapid socioeconomic or political change. The modern sardana was created in the context of the &quot;Renaixença&quot; period, in which some people wanted to relate the Sardana with dances of Ancient Greek origin, with the purpose of linking Classical antiquity with old Empúries while taking advantage of the rising popularity of the modern sardana in Empordà. This imagined account is the legendary origin of the dance. The invention served to symbolize the distinct Catalan ethos promoted by the then-newborn Catalan nationalism. In fact, today Catalans are known for their musicality throughout Spain and much of Western Europe; sardana has emerged as a major source of personal and social identity.

Ignoring the myth, the creation of &quot;sardana llarga&quot; or its evolution was driven by three people: Andreu Toron, Miquel Pardàs, and Josep Maria Ventura (Pep Ventura). Andreu Toron was responsible for introducing a type of oboe-tenor known in Catalonia as the tenora. This happened in 1849 at Perpignan. In parallel, influences to the music composition of &quot;sardana llarga&quot; include the popular Italian and German operas of the time as well as Contrapàs, a Catalan dance which in religious celebrations preceded &quot;sardana curta&quot;. These influences evolved into &quot;sardanes&quot; (plural of &quot;sardana&quot;) of different lengths. As a consequence, people started counting steps in order to finish at the same time. Shorter choreographies could be accommodated in longer melodies. The new melodies which progressively were made popular required new instruments, increasing the size of the &quot;cobla.&quot; Similar to what happened with the Catalan language when in 1891 Pompeu Fabra published his grammar, the different &quot;sardanes&quot; were standardised into what today is known as &quot;sardana llarga&quot;. Choreography was updated with slight differences from the original North-Catalan dance. Pep Ventura is credited for stabilizing the different variants around a clear rhythm and making the instrumental ensemble of a fixed size. He included the today&#x27;s standard long steps (&quot;els llargs&quot;) and the eleven player cobla band. Though some Iberian and Mediterranean circle dances follow similar patterns, instrumental music for the sardana has achieved a complexity of its own.

In 1850 Miquel Pardàs publishes (&#x27;Method to learn how to dance &quot;sardana llarga&quot;″).

By 1860 the dance was popular in Barcelona and from there it disseminated through Catalan towns and villages. Between 1840 and 1860 the sardana was established as &quot;dance of the Catalans&quot;. Its influence was extended throughout the 20th century thanks to the dance group , which organised and other sardana events in communities where it was previously unknown.

In 1924, during the dictatorship of Miguel Primo de Rivera, the civil governor of Barcelona banned the patriotic sardana , seen as being Catalanist. This fact increased the identification of the sardana with Catalanism. The creation of associations and &quot;cobles&quot; grew dramatically thanks to the continuous attack from the Establishment and Lerrouxism.

Sardana was temporally prohibited in the 1940s in Francoist Spain because it was considered to foment false feelings of pride and superiority among the Catalans. The prohibition was made on certain locales in and around Barcelona. Nevertheless, sardana was considered relatively innocuous in Spain and this allowed the use of sardana as a peaceful protest against the more effective and oppressive campaign to eliminate the public use of the Catalan language. Even more, pro-Franco Catalans continued to dance sardana throughout the Franco period.

Since the 1960, the travels from one city to another with the (&#x27;Eternal light of the Sardana&#x27;). Each city is named &quot;Heir to the Sardana&quot; for the year in which it conserves the Eternal Light.

In the year 2010, the Government of Catalonia added the sardana to the (&#x27;Catalonia&#x27;s festivities heritage catalogue&#x27;) and declared it a festivity of national interest.

In 2015 the Spanish parliament approved unanimously an initiative of the People&#x27;s Party of Spain to urge the Spanish Government to promote sardana for inclusion in the UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritage. The same vote was done in 2002 in Spain&#x27;s senate and was rejected due to the negative vote of People&#x27;s Party of Spain.

== Sardana and Catalan nationalism ==
The dance became a national symbol because it is identified with the core Catalan values including harmony, brotherhood, and democracy. People of all classes, ages, genres and origins are encouraged to dance sardana together. It is hard to believe this dance had emerged without expressing qualities appreciated by Catalans. The sardana is considered by Catalans one of the most prominent elements of their culture and deserving to be defended against threats from outsiders. This view was greatly increased with the suppression of in 1924 and the prohibition of &quot;sardana&quot; in 1940s Francoist Spain and its use as a protest mechanism. Fear of culture loss is notable among Catalans because they define themselves in cultural terms, so suppressing their culture is considered equivalent to annihilation as a people. This vexes and baffles Castilians and other Spaniards whose custom believes that birthplace and descent primarily define national identity. The tradition of Catalan people is that biology and culture are separable. Catalan ethnic identity can be acquired by learning, they do not consider it a biological or race matter. However, this concept of culture by acquisition represents also a fear of being consumed by the dominant Castilian culture. In the case of sardana, the rigidity of the dance rules and group exclusivity by those who follow the detailed rules is a handicap for inclusion. In sardana the dancers who do not follow the rules are excluded to their own circle until they master the technicalities.

Andalusian immigration in the mid-19th and mid-20th centuries introduced the Andalusian and flamenco dancing. The internal migration was perceived by some as a manipulation by the Spanish state, to be used as an instrument of cultural domination. Ensuring that sardana prevailed was somehow seen as vital to Catalan survival. In fact, learning sardana can be considered a way of expressing solidarity with Catalans. A quote from Montserrat Roig&#x27;s novel reads:

The protagonist of the novel says this to defend Castilians who support Catalan culture. The sardana forms part of Catalan culture and as such has to be protected from possible incursions by the dominant Castilian culture. Failing to adopt Catalan culture might cause it to disappear, effectively annihilating Catalan people.

Another threat concerns the ethnic origins of the creator of the modern sardana (&quot;sardana llarga&quot;), Josep Maria Ventura i Casas. He was born in 1817 in Andalusia, but when he was 2 years old he moved to Catalonia along with his father. Castilian custom would define Pep Ventura as Andalusian due to his birthplace. Pep&#x27;s Catalan identity rejection is reflected in Castilian press such as the digital &quot;El Español&quot;. Catalan historians and ethnomusicologists refer to his blood lineage (his father was born in Empordà), the first language he spoke and the composition of his soul to state that his birthplace does not change anything of what they consider a Catalan person. The &quot;soul&quot; is a way to express the imprinting made through learning and exposure to the world around a person. It is therefore a union of nature and nurture, providing the rhetorical basis for classifying Pep Ventura as Catalan, with a combination of Castilian and Catalan criteria (ascribed and achieved characteristics). Objectively speaking &quot;sardana llarga&quot; is not inherently Andalusian nor Catalan. Neither is Pep Ventura. Ethnicity is an invention, so is &quot;sardana llarga&quot; composed by Pep Ventura. The attributes and values in which Catalan people are invested make the sardana (any type) and Pep Ventura of Catalan nature. They express Catalan qualities. As a result, both &quot;sardana llarga&quot; and Pep Ventura have become symbols of national resistance against the power of Castile. That&#x27;s why scholars insist on Ventura&#x27;s Catalan origins while Castilian people insist in his birthplace.

Nowadays sardana is considered too rigid and conservative. Only a few younger dancers care about learning sardana and dance. Still, the Catalan government continues to invest in dance schools and training. Its socio-political relevance has decreased but holds its symbolic value.

==Sardana band==
Music for the sardana is played by a &quot;cobla&quot;, a band consisting of 10 wind instruments, double bass and a &quot;tamborí&quot; (little drum) played by 11 musicians. The cobla has five woodwind instruments: the &quot;flabiol&quot; which is a small fipple flute, and the &quot;tenora&quot; and &quot;tible&quot; (two of each) which belong to the oboe family. These and the &quot;tamborí&quot; are typical Catalan instruments. The brass instruments are: two trumpets, two &quot;fiscorns&quot;, and a trombone (usually a valve trombone). The double bass was traditionally a three-stringed one, but now the part is usually written for and played on the modern four-stringed instrument.

In Catalonia, about one hundred and thirty cobles are active, most of which are amateur bands. Outside Catalonia, there is at least one more cobla: Cobla La Principal d&#x27;Amsterdam.

==Sardana dance==

The music written for the dance is a &quot;sardana&quot; (plural: &quot;sardanes&quot;), and is usually in two sections (&quot;tirades&quot;), called &quot;curts&quot; and &quot;llargs&quot;, each of which may be repeated in various ways to form the pattern for the complete dance. There is usually an experienced dancer leading the circle. The dancers hold hands throughout the dance: arms down during the &quot;curts&quot; and raised to shoulder height during the &quot;llargs&quot;.
* The &quot;introit&quot; is a few introductory notes played freely by the flabiolist, typically ending with an upward scale and a tap of the &quot;tamborí&quot;, signalling the other players and dancers to begin the &quot;curts&quot;.
* The first &quot;tirada&quot; played by the band, called the &quot;tirada de curts&quot; (&quot;short steps&quot;), is of length between 20 and 50 measures and has a two-measure pattern. The tempo is typically about =112 to 120, in and/or rhythm. It is danced with the arms down: (point-step-step-cross) to the right followed by (point-step-step-cross) to the left. The &quot;curts&quot; is usually repeated the first time it is played.
* The &quot;tirada de llargs&quot; (&quot;long steps&quot;) is of 50 to 100 measures and has a four-measure pattern. It is danced with the arms up to shoulder level, and is more lively than the &quot;curts&quot;. However the tempo is typically slower than the &quot;curts&quot;, about =100 to 108, with long lyrical tunes accompanied by variants of a dactyl rhythm. The &quot;llargs&quot; is usually repeated the first time it is played.
* The &quot;contrapunt&quot; is played by the flabiolist, and is a two-measure break signalling the last repeat of the &quot;llargs&quot;.
*The &quot;cop final&quot; (&quot;final beat&quot;) concludes the dance with a unified movement from all the dancers, still holding hands.
* A modern sardana dance has the following typical pattern, which shows all the repeats of the &quot;curts&quot; and &quot;llargs&quot;:
# &quot;introit&quot;
# 1st &quot;tirada&quot;: &quot;curts&quot;
# 2nd &quot;tirada&quot;: &quot;curts&quot;
# 3rd &quot;tirada&quot;: &quot;llargs&quot;
# 4th &quot;tirada&quot;: &quot;llargs&quot;
# 5th &quot;tirada&quot;: &quot;curts&quot;
# 6th &quot;tirada&quot;: &quot;llargs&quot;
# &quot;contrapunt&quot;
# 7th &quot;tirada&quot;: &quot;llargs&quot;
# &quot;cop final&quot;

The number of measures in the &quot;curts&quot; and &quot;llargs&quot;, called the &quot;tiratge&quot; or &quot;run&quot;, is important to the players, and may be indicated before the start of the dance (e.g. a &quot;run&quot; shown as 25x79 indicates 25 measures of &quot;curts&quot; and 79 measures of &quot;llargs&quot;) in order to terminate the &quot;tirada&quot; correctly with the correct foot, though a method commonly used is to count the measures in the first &quot;tirada&quot; and not dance until the second has begun.

A dancer is called a &quot;sardanista&quot; (plural: &quot;sardanistes&quot;).

As a relatively slow, non-performance dance, the sardana does not require special fitness. The dance circle can be opened to a highly variable number of dancers. When danced in the streets and town squares, small circles of dancers can be seen to form and grow: these are open circles called &quot;rotllanes obertes&quot;, and passers-by can join, leaving their bags in the center of the circle. When a dance circle is too big it may split into smaller circles. The dancers are alternate men and women – with the man&#x27;s partner on his right – and care must be taken by those joining not to split partners. Another kind of circle may be formed by members of organised sardana clubs called &quot;colles&quot;, and each &quot;colla&quot; may wear its own costume.
In order to dance sardanes comfortably the footwear must be flexible enough to allow the dancer to jump slightly when the &quot;llargs&quot; come. Traditionally &quot;sardanistes&quot; wear special dancing shoes called &quot;espardenyes&quot; made of esparto grass fabric and with two long fabric strips to tie them up around the ankle. Nowadays most people have replaced these with regular trainers.

Many sardanes have sung versions, but mostly instrumental versions are used for dancing. Recordings of sardanes or sardanes played in concert usually contain the &quot;introit&quot;, two &quot;curts&quot; and two &quot;llargs&quot;. Sardanes may be recorded for dancing, having all the &quot;entrades&quot; in order. Often sardanes are written for special occasions or to commemorate people.

<doc id="779172" wikidata="Q2396253" url="?curid=779172" title="Zmeu">
<text>The Zmeu (plural: &quot;zmei&quot;, feminine: &quot;zmeoaică&quot; / &quot;zmeoaice&quot;) is a fantastic creature of Romanian folklore and Romanian mythology.

Though referred by some sources as a dragon, the zmeu is nevertheless distinct, because it usually has clear anthropomorphic traits: it is humanoid and has legs, arms, the ability to create and use artifacts such as weapons, and to ride a horse, and has the desire to marry young girls. There are commentators that class it as a giant (equivalent of an ogre), or a devil, or even a vampire.

In some stories, Zmeu appears in the sky and spits fire, or has the ability to change form. In other stories, it has a magical precious stone on its head that shines like the sun. It likes beautiful young girls, whom it kidnaps, usually for the purpose of marrying them. It is almost always defeated by a daring prince or knight-errant.

The zmei has also been conflated with or confused with the &quot;dracu&quot; or with the &quot;balaur&quot; type dragon.

== Etymology ==

Most scholars agree that the Romanian term &quot;zmeu&quot; derives from Slavic &quot;zmey&quot;. However, Václav Machek considered this problematic, leading to Romanian linguists Sorin Paliga and Eugen S. Teodor to propose the hypothesis of an early Slavic loan from the North Thracian language.

The relation with Romanian &quot;zmeură&quot; ‘raspberry’ has been deemed to be possible, but rather unlikely, by .

== General description ==

The zmeu is described by some as a &quot;dragon&quot;, but a dragon that may assume the role of a suitor or a lover of a human woman, and in some cases are heroic figures, though in other cases, diabolical.

Thus zmeu has been noted to be &quot;anthropo-ophidian&quot;, i.e., possessing both man and dragon/serpent-like features: a &quot;scale-covered, human-like body, a snake&#x27;s tail, and bat-like wings&quot;, or rather it is a &quot;man&#x27;s head&quot; sitting on a &quot;bird&#x27;s trunk, [and a] serpent&#x27;s tail&quot;, according to other accounts.

Indeed, zmeu has been described as a sort of man-eating giant, an equivalent of the Western ogre, possessing a &quot;rocky tail&quot;, but still able to mount a horse. The zmeu was no more than a creature with human-face, though somewhat taller and thicker-bodied, according to the assertions of some folklorists, and are capable of human speech, though in somewhat uncouth a fashion.

One paper categorized the zmeu among the Rumanian vampires, alongside the &quot;vârcolac&quot; (blood-drinking werewolf), but the latter tends to be confused more with the blood-sucking strigă (pl. &quot;strigoi&quot;).

The &quot;zmei&quot; are also confused with the &quot;dracu&quot; (dragon) among the populace. The flying creatures ridden by the Șolomonarii are the zmeu, or the balaur, depending on the authority.

But in certain fairytales, the zmeu merely appears as a king of the serpents.

== Role and functions ==
The &quot;zmeu&quot; figures prominently in many Romanian folk tales as the manifestation of the destructive forces of greed and selfishness. Often, the zmeu steals something of great value, which only &quot;Făt-Frumos&quot; (the Romanian &quot;Prince Charming&quot;; literally: &quot;handsome youth&quot;) can retrieve through his great, selfless bravery. For example, in the ballad of the knight &quot;Greuceanu&quot;, the zmeu steals the sun and the moon from the sky, thereby enshrouding all humanity in darkness. In the story of &quot;Prâslea the Brave and the Golden Apples&quot;, the zmeu robs the king of the precious &quot;golden apples&quot;; a parallel can be drawn to the German fairy tale &quot;The Golden Bird&quot;, the Russian &quot;Tsarevitch Ivan, the Fire Bird and the Gray Wolf&quot;, and the Bulgarian &quot;The Nine Peahens and the Golden Apples&quot; — although in all these other cases, the thief was a bird (nevertheless, in some versions of the Romanian story, the zmeu does transform into a bird to steal the golden apples). Usually, the zmeu resides in the &quot;other world&quot; (&quot;celălalt tărâm&quot;) and sometimes &quot;Făt-Frumos&quot; has to descend into his dark kingdom, implying that the zmeu lives underground.

The zmeu has a plethora of magical, destructive powers at his disposal. He can fly, shapeshift, and has tremendous supernatural strength. Ultimately, the abilities of the zmeu are of no avail, as &quot;Făt-Frumos&quot; defeats him through martial skill and daring.

The zmeu likes to kidnap a maiden to be his wife in his otherworldly realm. After &quot;Făt-Frumos&quot; slays the zmeu, he takes the maiden as his own bride-to-be. Similarly, like the giant in the popular British stories of &quot;Jack and the Beanstalk&quot;, the zmeu returns home to his fortress from his raids into human lands sensing that a human (&quot;Făt-Frumos&quot;) is lying in ambush somewhere nearby. A Zmeu is also sometimes pictured as a flame who goes in the room of a young girl or widow and once inside, becomes a man and seduces her.

There are people who have allegedly seen zmei flying through the sky. They are supposed to look like a living trail of fire, or fireworks.

<text>Super-Cannes is a novel by the British author J. G. Ballard, published in 2000. It picks up on the same themes as his earlier &quot;Cocaine Nights&quot;, and has often been called a companion piece to that book.

==Plot summary==
In the hills above Cannes, a European elite has gathered in the business-park Eden-Olympia, a closed society that offers its privileged residents luxury homes, private doctors, private security forces, their own psychiatrists, and other conveniences required by the modern businessman. The book&#x27;s protagonist, Paul, quits his job as an editor and moves to Eden-Olympia with his wife Jane when she is offered a job there as a pediatrician. At first glance, Eden-Olympia seems the ideal workers&#x27; paradise, but beneath its glittering, glass-wall surface, all is not well. For if things are running smoothly, then why are all the residents – these well-established businessmen, doctors, architects, and producers – all suffering heavily from stress and insomnia? And why did Jane&#x27;s predecessor, the well-liked and apparently quite sane David Greenwood, go to work one day with an assault rifle strapped over his shoulders, murdering several of his friends and co-workers, before he put the rifle to his own head?

Quickly bored with life in Eden-Olympia (&quot;the kind of adolescent society where you define yourself by the kind of trainers you wear&quot;), Paul decides to investigate the events that led to Greenwood&#x27;s death, and begins walking in his footsteps. He soon discovers that just beneath the calm, well-mannered surface of his new home lies an underworld of crime, deviant sex, and drugs that seems to be prospering and growing. And all the residents at Eden-Olympia seem not only to be aware of this, but to encourage and welcome this underworld, as it provides them with a means to relate to something other than their jobs, and – by entering that world – to let go of the social restraints and etiquette that define their lives.

Paul discovers that Eden-Olympia&#x27;s resident psychiatrist, Wilder Penrose, is eagerly encouraging his patients (and there are many of them) to indulge themselves in activities involving sex and violence, as a (successful) cure for their symptoms of stress. Says Penrose: &quot;Psychopathy is its own most potent cure, and always has been. At times, it grasps entire nations in its grip and sends them through vast therapeutic spasms. No drug in the world is that powerful.&quot;

== Television adaptation ==
In May 2021, it was announced that Canadian filmmaker Brandon Cronenberg would write and direct an adaptation as a limited series for television.

<doc id="779188" wikidata="Q3493405" url="?curid=779188" title="Bounding sphere">
<text>In mathematics, given a non-empty set of objects of finite extension in formula_1-dimensional space, for example a set of points, a bounding sphere, enclosing sphere or enclosing ball for that set is a formula_1-dimensional solid sphere containing all of these objects.

Used in computer graphics and computational geometry, a bounding sphere is a special type of bounding volume. There are several fast and simple bounding sphere construction algorithms with a high practical value in real-time computer graphics applications.

In statistics and operations research, the objects are typically points, and generally the sphere of interest is the minimal bounding sphere, that is, the sphere with minimal radius among all bounding spheres. It may be proven that such a sphere is unique: If there are two of them, then the objects in question lie within their intersection. But an intersection of two non-coinciding spheres of equal radius is contained in a sphere of smaller radius.

The problem of computing the center of a minimal bounding sphere is also known as the &quot;unweighted Euclidean 1-center problem&quot;.

==Applications==

===Clustering===
Such spheres are useful in clustering, where groups of similar data points are classified together.

In statistical analysis the scattering of data points within a sphere may be attributed to measurement error or natural (usually thermal) processes, in which case the cluster represents a perturbation of an ideal point. In some circumstances this ideal point may be used as a substitute for the points in the cluster, advantageous in reducing calculation time.

In operations research the clustering of values to an ideal point may also be used to reduce the number of inputs in order to obtain approximate values for NP-hard problems in a reasonable time. The point chosen is not usually the center of the sphere, as this can be biased by outliers, but instead some form of average location such as a least squares point is computed to represent the cluster.

==Algorithms==
There are exact and approximate algorithms for solving the bounding sphere problem.

===Linear programming===
Nimrod Megiddo studied the 1-center problem extensively and published on it at least five times in the 1980s. In 1983, he proposed a &quot;prune and search&quot; algorithm which finds the optimum bounding sphere and runs in linear time if the dimension is fixed as a constant. When the dimension formula_1 is taken into account, the execution time complexity is formula_4, which is impractical for high-dimensional applications.

In 1991, Emo Welzl proposed a much simpler randomized algorithm, generalizing a randomized linear programming algorithm by Raimund Seidel. The expected running time of Welzl&#x27;s algorithm is formula_5, which again reduces to formula_6 for any fixed dimension formula_1. The paper provides experimental results demonstrating its practicality in higher dimensions. A more recent deterministic algorithm of Timothy Chan also runs in formula_6 time, with a smaller (but still exponential) dependence on the dimension.

The open-source Computational Geometry Algorithms Library (CGAL) contains an implementation of Welzl&#x27;s algorithm.

===Ritter&#x27;s bounding sphere===
In 1990, Jack Ritter proposed a simple algorithm to find a non-minimal bounding sphere. It is widely used in various applications for its simplicity. The algorithm works in this way:

#Pick a point formula_9 from formula_10, search a point formula_11 in formula_10, which has the largest distance from formula_9;
#Search a point formula_14 in formula_10, which has the largest distance from formula_11. Set up an initial ball formula_17, with its centre as the midpoint of formula_11 and formula_14, the radius as half of the distance between formula_11 and formula_14;
#If all points in formula_10 are within ball formula_17, then we get a bounding sphere. Otherwise, let formula_24 be a point outside the ball, constructs a new ball covering both point formula_24 and previous ball. Repeat this step until all points are covered.

Ritter&#x27;s algorithm runs in time formula_26 on inputs consisting of formula_27 points in formula_1-dimensional space, which makes it very efficient. However, it gives only a coarse result which is usually 5% to 20% larger than the optimum.

===Core-set based approximation===
Bădoiu et al. presented a formula_29 approximation to the bounding sphere problem, where a formula_29 approximation means that the constructed sphere has radius at most formula_31, where formula_32 is the smallest possible radius of a bounding sphere.

A coreset is a small subset, that a formula_29 expansion of the solution on the subset is a bounding sphere of the whole set. The coreset is constructed incrementally by adding the farthest point into the set in each iteration.

Kumar et al. improved this approximation algorithm so that it runs in time formula_34.

===Fischer&#x27;s exact solver===
Fischer et al. (2003) proposed an exact solver, though the algorithm does not have a polynomial running time in the worst case. The algorithm is purely combinatorial and implements a pivoting scheme similar to the simplex method for linear programming, used earlier in some heuristics. It starts with a large sphere that covers all points and gradually shrinks it until it cannot be shrunk further. The algorithm features correct termination rules in cases of degeneracies, overlooked by prior authors; and efficient handling of partial solutions, which produces a major speed-up. The authors verified that the algorithm is efficient in practice in low and moderately low (up to 10,000) dimensions and claim it does not exhibit numerical stability problems in its floating-point operations. A C++ implementation of the algorithm is available as an open-source project.

=== Extremal points optimal sphere ===
 proposed the &quot;extremal points optimal sphere&quot; method with controllable speed to accuracy approximation to solve the bounding sphere problem. This method works by taking a set of formula_35 direction vectors and projecting all points onto each vector in formula_35; formula_35 serves as a speed-accuracy trade-off variable. An exact solver is applied to the formula_38 extremal points of these projections. The algorithm then iterates over the remaining points, if any, growing the sphere if necessary. For large formula_27 this method is orders of magnitude faster than exact methods, while giving comparable results. It has a worst case time of formula_40.

<text>The Bungle Bungle Range is a major landform and the main feature of the Purnululu National Park, situated in the Kimberley region of Western Australia.

==Formation ==
The distinctive beehive-shaped towers are made up of sandstones and conglomerates (rocks composed mainly of pebbles and boulders and cemented together by finer material). These sedimentary formations were deposited into the Red Basin 375 to 350 million years ago, when active faults altered the landscape. The combined effects of wind from the Tanami Desert and rainfall over millions of years shaped the domes.
==Description==
The range is found on the plains fringing the eastern Kimberley region. The ranges consist of stacks of ancient seabeds with layers of dolomite contained throughout them. 
A diameter circular topographic feature is clearly visible on satellite images of the Bungle Bungle Range. It is believed that this feature is the eroded remnant of a very ancient meteorite impact crater and is known as the Piccaninny crater.

The unusual orange and dark grey banding on the conical rock formations is caused by differences in the layers of sandstone. The darker bands are on the layers of rock which hold more moisture, and are a dark algal or cyanobacteria growth. The orange coloured layers are stained with iron and manganese mineral deposits contained within the sandstone.

The Bungle Bungle Range formation occupies an area of approximately .

==History==
The traditional owners of the area are the Kija/Gija people.

Aboriginal people have been living in the area for over 20,000 years and continue to maintain a strong connection to this ancient landscape. The national park is managed by the Western Australian Department of Environment and Conservation in conjunction with the traditional Aboriginal owners.

The range remained largely unknown except by local Aboriginal people and stockmen until 1982 when film-makers arrived and produced a documentary about the Kimberley. The area was gazetted as a National Park in 1987 and was also inscribed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2003.

<text>La Boca (; &quot;the Mouth&quot;, probably of the Matanza River) is a neighborhood (&quot;barrio&quot;) of Buenos Aires, the capital of Argentina.

Its location near the Port of Buenos Aires meant the neighbourhood became a melting pot of different cultures during the 20th century, when millions of immigrants from Europe and Asia arrived to Argentina. In particular, many of its settlers originated from the Italian region of Liguria. The neighbourhood became a cornerstone for &quot;porteño&quot; culture, being an important site during the early development of the tango.

Today, it is mostly known for being home to Boca Juniors, one of the two largest football teams in Argentina.

==Geography==
La Boca is located in the south-east of the city, near its old port. Another of the 48 &quot;barrios&quot;, Barracas, lies to the west; San Telmo and Puerto Madero are to the north.

==History==
In 1882, after a lengthy general strike, La Boca seceded from Argentina, and the rebels raised the Genoese flag, which was immediately torn down personally by then President Julio Argentino Roca.

Among sports fans, Boca is best known for being the home of the world-renowned football club Boca Juniors. The club plays its home matches in Estadio Alberto J. Armando, popularly known as La Bombonera (Spanish for &quot;the bonbon box&quot;).

 La Boca was home to the &quot;garra&quot;, or a fighting spirit that was represented in the hard working, no nonsense people of the barrio and reflected by the most popular club Boca Juniors on the pitch. Throughout the first half of the 20th century, La Boca’s citizens was characterized for rejecting “art for arts sake” and adopting a workmanlike attitude to work and life, in contrast to the richer citizens to the north, often represented through their club River Plate. In 1907, La Boca became its own micronational republic. Their first attempt was short-lived, but two later attempts were more successful. The former lasted from 1923 to 1972 and the latter was established since 1986. Republic graffiti was still present in the barrio.

Another of Argentina’s most popular clubs, River Plate, originally started in the La Boca. However, in 1938 the club relocated to the Núñez neighborhood on the northern edge of the city and became more identifiable with the Buenos Aires elite than the lower class citizens of La Boca. The land in and around La Boca was often controlled by the state or wealthy corporations in the first half of the 20th century, due to its location near the docks, making soccer pitches difficult to obtain for citizens.

La Boca is a popular destination for tourists visiting Argentina, with its colourful houses and pedestrian street, the Caminito, where tango dancers perform and tango-related memorabilia is sold. Other attractions include the La Ribera theatre, many tango music clubs, and Italian taverns. The area visited by tourists is only a few blocks long and has been built up for tourism very actively over the last few years, with many market stalls and restaurants catering to tourists. Outside this tourist area, it is a fairly poor neighborhood that has had many regular occurrences of petty crimes reported.

It has also been a centre for radical politics, having elected the first socialist member of the Argentine Congress (Alfredo Palacios in 1935) and was home to many demonstrations during the crisis of 2001.

As of 2016, the health of over 1,000 La Boca citizens is threatened by the pollution of the Matanza-Riachuelo River (which contains high levels of arsenic and lead, due to centuries of unrestrained pollution).

<text>In automata theory, an alternating finite automaton (AFA) is a nondeterministic finite automaton whose transitions are divided into &quot;existential&quot; and &quot;universal&quot; transitions. For example, let &quot;A&quot; be an alternating automaton.
* For an existential transition formula_1, &quot;A&quot; nondeterministically chooses to switch the state to either formula_2 or formula_3, reading &quot;a&quot;. Thus, behaving like a regular nondeterministic finite automaton.
* For a universal transition formula_4, &quot;A&quot; moves to formula_2 and formula_3, reading &quot;a&quot;, simulating the behavior of a parallel machine.

Note that due to the universal quantification a run is represented by a run &quot;tree&quot;. &quot;A&quot; accepts a word &quot;w&quot;, if there &quot;exists&quot; a run tree on &quot;w&quot; such that &quot;every&quot; path ends in an accepting state.

A basic theorem states that any AFA is equivalent to a deterministic finite automaton (DFA), hence AFAs accept exactly the regular languages.

An alternative model which is frequently used is the one where Boolean combinations are in disjunctive normal form so that, e.g., formula_7 would represent formula_8. The state tt (&quot;true&quot;) is represented by formula_9 in this case and ff (&quot;false&quot;) by formula_10. This representation is usually more efficient.

Alternating finite automata can be extended to accept trees in the same way as tree automata, yielding alternating tree automata.

==Formal definition==
An alternating finite automaton (AFA) is a 5-tuple,
formula_11, where

*formula_12 is a finite set of states;
*formula_13 is a finite set of input symbols;
*formula_14 is the initial (start) state;
*formula_15 is a set of accepting (final) states;
*formula_16 is the transition function.

For each string formula_17, we define the acceptance function formula_18 by induction on the length of formula_19:

*formula_20 if formula_21, and formula_22 otherwise;
*formula_23.

The automaton accepts a string formula_17 if and only if formula_25.

This model was introduced by Chandra, Kozen and Stockmeyer.

==State complexity==
Even though AFA can accept exactly the regular languages, they are different from other types of finite automata in the succinctness of description, measured by the number of their states.

Chandra et al. proved that converting an formula_26-state AFA to an equivalent DFA
requires formula_27 states in the worst case, though a DFA for the reverse language can be constructued with only formula_28 states. Another construction by Fellah, Jürgensen and Yu. converts an AFA with formula_26 states to a nondeterministic finite automaton (NFA) with up to formula_28 states by performing a similar kind of powerset construction as used for the transformation of an NFA to a DFA.

==Computational complexity==

The membership problem asks, given an AFA formula_31 and a word formula_19, whether formula_31 accepts formula_19. This problem is P-complete. This is true even on a singleton alphabet, i.e., when the automaton accepts a unary language.

The non-emptiness problem (is the language of an input AFA non-empty?), the universality problem (is the complement of the language of an input AFA empty?), and the equivalence problem (do two input AFAs recognize the same language) are PSPACE-complete for AFAs.

<doc id="779200" wikidata="Q1962608" url="?curid=779200" title="Meșterul Manole">
<text>In Romanian mythology, Meșterul Manole (roughly: &quot;The master builder Manole&quot;) was the chief architect of the Curtea de Argeș Monastery in Wallachia. The myth of the cathedral&#x27;s construction is expressed in the folk poem &quot;Monastirea Argeșului&quot; (&quot;The Monastery on the Argeș River&quot;). 

In the poem, Manole finds it impossible to build the monastery without a human sacrifice and, despite his efforts, is forced to sacrifice his own pregnant wife by encasing her in the walls of the building. Written in the style of a folk ballad, the poem is often seen as an example of an &quot;aesthetic myth&quot; in folkloric literature, having at its core the belief that nothing durable and unique can be built without the creator&#x27;s self-sacrifice.

George Călinescu considered Meșterul Manole, along with Miorița, Zburătorul and Dochia and Trajan, as being part of the four fundamental myths of Romanian folk literature.

== Plot ==

The Legend of Master Manole: Prince Radu the Black (Radu Negru) wanted to build the most beautiful monastery in the country, so he hired Master Manole, the best mason of those times, along with his 9 men. During construction, because the walls of the monastery would continuously crumble, the Prince threatened to kill Manole and his workers.

Desperate about the way construction went, one night Manole had a dream in which he was told that, for the monastery to be built, he had to incorporate into its walls some person very loved by him or his masons. He told his masons about his dream, and they agreed that the first wife who would come there with lunch for her husband the following day should be the one to be built into the walls of the monastery so that their art would last.

The next day, Manole looked over the hills and sadly saw his wife, Ana (who was pregnant), coming from afar. He prayed to God to start rain and storm in order for her to stop her trip or go back home. But her love was stronger than the storm, and she kept going. He prayed again, but nothing could stop her. When she arrived, Manole and the builders told her that they wanted to play a little game, which involved building walls around her body. She accepted happily, but she soon realized that this was no game and implored Manole to let her go. But he had to keep his promise. And that was how the beautiful monastery was built.

When the monastery was completed, the Prince asked the builders if they could ever make a similarly splendid building. Manole and his masons told the Prince that they surely could always build an even greater building. Hearing that and fearing they&#x27;ll build a bigger and more beautiful building for someone else, the Prince had them all stranded on the roof so that they would perish and never build something to match it. They fashioned wooden wings and tried to fly off the roof. But, one by one, they all fell to the ground. A well of clear water, named after Manole, is believed to mark the spot where Manole himself fell.

=== Negru Vodă ===
Negru Vodă from the tale appears to be a fusion between Radu Negru, the traditional founder of Ţara Românească (Wallachia), and Neagoe Basarab, the historical builder of the church.

== Publication and legacy ==
Alongside &quot;Miorița&quot;, &quot;Toma Alimoș&quot; and &quot;Dolca&quot;, it was published by Vasile Alecsandri in the first collection of Romanian folk creations in 1852, entitled &quot;Poezii populare, balade (Cântice bătrânești) adunate și îndreptate de Vasile Alecsandri&quot;. Although the popular text has several variants, because the author is anonymous and the ballad was transmitted orally from generation to generation, the one published by Alecsandri is consecrated in literary form. 

Many Romanian writers had the legend as a motif and source of inspiration. Among them, Lucian Blaga (in his &quot;Meşterul Manole&quot; theatre play) brought forth a modern take on the myth. In Blaga&#x27;s version, Manole&#x27;s self-sacrifice is not prompted by any gesture of Prince Radu, but it is instead a personal journey. 

== Analysis ==
The role of Ana, in particular was widely discussed by scholars, often as an example of a model wife, who never wavers from commitment and duty to Manole even in the face of supernatural efforts to stop her, but also as a feminist critique of marriage, which requires women to sacrifice themselves and become confined within the walls of the house for the sake of their husbands&#x27; work.

The attempt by Manole and the other masons to flee the roof by building wooden wings only appears in the Romanian version and is a variation of the Icarus myth.

== Similarities ==

A similar tale in the Hungarian culture is &quot;Kőműves Kelemen&quot; (&quot;Kelemen, the Bricklayer&quot;), whose synopsis is essentially equivalent to the story of Manole. Another story is that of Rozafa, the castle in Shkodra, Albania. Rozafa was the wife of the youngest of three brothers that could only built the castle after they had to wall her alive. In Serbia, The Building of Skadar also uses the &quot;bricked-in wife&quot; trope.

Similar stories exist in Inner Mongolia (related to the Hunnic city of Tongwancheng) and in the Southern Balkans, Montenegro, Bulgaria, and Greece (the Bridge of Arta). In Bulgaria there is also a legend about a master-builder by the name of Manol who flew from the minaret of the Selimiye Mosque in Edirne using eagle wings he crafted. Another similar story is the legend of the Matsue Castle in Japan. By some estimated, there are over 700 local variants of the myth.

<text>In Romanian mythology, apa vie (literally translated as &quot;Living Water&quot; but more accurately as &quot;Water of Life&quot;) means the water from which heroes drink so that they come back to life after healing their wounds. 
Apa moartǎ (&quot;Dead Water&quot; or &quot;Water of Death&quot;) is the complement of apa vie. In the vast majority of the tales it has the power to heal wounds of dead bodies (but not to give life). Usually, reviving a dead person is done (in such tales) by putting this Dead Water on their wounds to heal them and then bring them back to life with Living Water, because the Living Water cannot heal the wounds of the dead, and even revived, the people would still bleed to death without being healed first. There is a small percent of tales in which apa moartǎ is a poisonous drink that kills any person who drinks it.

Examples of the use of apa vie can be found in the fairy tales &quot;Prâslea the Brave and the Golden Apples&quot; and &quot;Greuceanu.&quot;

<text>A spiriduș in Romanian mythology is said to be a &quot;demon incarnate&quot;, or a domestic spirit, oftentimes taking the form of an avian familiar, such as hens, crows, or hunting birds.&#x27; The purpose of these familiars once they&#x27;re summoned, is to act as messengers or intermediaries between the master of the home in which the spiriduș was born, and [[the devil]].&#x27; The master can use the spiriduș to request from the devil any mortal desire, in return for their soul in the afterlife.

<doc id="779211" wikidata="Q7423340" url="?curid=779211" title="Saratoga, New South Wales">
<text>Saratoga is a residential south-eastern village and suburb of the Central Coast region of New South Wales, Australia, located on a peninsula of Brisbane Water and part of the local government area. The suburb is characterised by its largely settled shoreline, with houses extending up coastal slopes to the base of the tall hills that comprise the core of the peninsula.

The village of Saratoga occupies the central portion of its peninsula, bordered towards the point by Davistown and toward the mainland by Yattalunga.

Initially utilised by indigenous peoples, the area of Saratoga was first exploited by European settlers for citrus orchards, after John Bourke and his family settled in the area in 1863. Bourke went on to become a pioneer in commercial citrus growing in the area of Brisbane Water. Sporadic building occurred thereafter, including the notable Federation-style house &#x27;Rosemount&#x27;, built in 1917 and surviving on 0.5 ha of land at the corner of Village Road and Brooklyn Road. In recent decades, housing development has transformed most of Saratoga into an outer residential suburb of Gosford. Bordered on three sides by water, Saratoga has also become a favourite haunt of fishermen and sports people.

Most residents commute to Gosford, Kincumber or Erina for their daily needs, with few working in the suburb itself. Saratoga has a small shopping centre located on Village Road, which includes a petrol station, a general store, a hairdresser, a newsagency, a liquor outlet, a pharmacy, two takeaway shops, a bakery and a jeweller.

Brisbania Public School stands at the corner of High Street and Davistown Road.

Saratoga is the home of the Saratoga Hawks, a Junior Australian Football Club established in 2001.

<doc id="779220" wikidata="Q1757070" url="?curid=779220" title="Mission control center">
<text>A mission control center (MCC, sometimes called a flight control center or operations center) is a facility that manages space flights, usually from the point of launch until landing or the end of the mission. It is part of the ground segment of spacecraft operations. A staff of flight controllers and other support personnel monitor all aspects of the mission using telemetry, and send commands to the vehicle using ground stations. Personnel supporting the mission from an MCC can include representatives of the attitude control system, power, propulsion, thermal, attitude dynamics, orbital operations and other subsystem disciplines. The training for these missions usually falls under the responsibility of the flight controllers, typically including extensive rehearsals in the MCC.
==NASA&#x27;s Mission Control Center==

United States missions are, prior to liftoff, controlled from the Launch Control Center (LCC) located at NASA&#x27;s Kennedy Space Center on Merritt Island, Florida. Responsibility for the booster and spacecraft remains with the Launch Control Center until the booster has cleared the launch tower.

After liftoff, responsibility is handed over to NASA&#x27;s Mission Control Center in Houston, Texas (abbreviated MCC-H, full name &quot;Christopher C. Kraft Jr. Mission Control Center&quot;), at the Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center.

<text>Taslim Olawale Elias (11 November 1914 – 14 August 1991) was a Nigerian jurist who served as minister of Justice and attorney-general of Nigeria from 1960 to 1966, Chief Justice of Nigeria from 1972 to 1975 and president of the International Court of Justice from 1982 to 1985. He was a scholar who modernised and extensively revised the laws of Nigeria.

== Youth and studies ==

Elias was born into the traditional aristocracy of Lagos, then the capital of Nigeria, on 11 November 1914. He received his secondary education at the Church Missionary Society Grammar School and Igbobi College in Lagos. He married Ganiat Yetunde Fowosere, and the couple would have five children together (three sons, including Olufemi Elias a lawyer, and two daughters). After passing the Cambridge School Certificate examination, he worked as an assistant in the Government Audit Department. In 1935 he joined the Nigerian Railway and served in the Chief Accountant&#x27;s Office for nine years.

While working at the Nigerian Railway, Elias became an external student of the University of London, and later he passed the intermediate examinations for the BA and LLB degrees. He left Nigeria for the United Kingdom in 1944 and was admitted to University College London. As this was during World War II, with London the target of frequent bomb attacks, he spent some time at Cambridge&#x27;s Trinity College. He graduated with a BA the year he entered University College London and two years later received the LLB. In 1947, he was called to the bar at the Inner Temple, where he was a Yarborough Anderson Scholar, and in the same year received his LLM degree. He continued his graduate education and became the first African to earn a PhD in law from the University of London in 1949.

In 1951, Elias was awarded a UNESCO Fellowship to undertake research into the legal, economic, and social problems of Africa. Later that year he had his first academic appointment, the Simon Senior Research Fellow at Manchester University. There he was an instructor in law and social anthropology. It was also in 1951 that he published his first book, &quot;Nigerian Land Law and Custom&quot;.

== Professional life ==
Elias moved from Manchester to Oxford in 1954, when he became the Oppenheimer Research Fellow at the Institute of Commonwealth Studies, Nuffield College and Queen Elizabeth House. He continued his research into Nigerian law and published Groundwork of Nigerian Law in the same year. In 1956, he was a visiting professor of political science at the University of Delhi. He was instrumental in organizing courses in government, law, and social anthropology and in establishing the African Studies Department. Elias also lectured at the universities of Aligarh, Allahabad, Bombay, and Calcutta. In that year he also published two books, &quot;Makers of Nigerian Law&quot; and &quot;The Nature of African Customary Law&quot;.

He returned to London in 1957 and was appointed a governor of the School of Oriental and African Studies. As the constitutional and legal adviser to the National Council of Nigeria and the Cameroons (which later became the National Convention of Nigerian Citizens), he participated in the 1958 Nigerian Constitutional Conference in London. He was one of the architects of Nigeria&#x27;s independence constitution

In 1960, Elias was invited to become Nigeria&#x27;s attorney-general and minister of justice. He served in this capacity through the whole of the first republic. Although later dismissed after the coup d&#x27;état in January 1966, he was reinstated in November of that year.

In addition to contributing to Nigerian and African law, Elias had long been active in the field of international law. He was a member of the United Nations International Law Commission from 1961 to 1975, he served as General Rapporteur from 1965 to 1966 and was its chairman in 1970. He was the leader of the Nigerian delegations to the conference held to consider the Draft Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of Other States in 1963 and to the Special Committee on the Principles of International Law concerning Friendly Relations and Co-operation among States in 1964. He was a member of the United Nations Committee of Experts, which drafted the constitution of the Congo, 1961–1962. He also helped to draft the charter of the Organization of African Unity (OAU), and its Protocol of Mediation, Conciliation and Arbitration. Elias also represented the OAU and Nigeria before the International Court of Justice in the proceedings concerning the status of Namibia. He was elected as an associate member of the Institut de droit international in 1969. He was chairman of the Committee of the Whole at the Vienna Conference on the Law of Treaties (1968–1969).

In 1966, Elias was appointed professor and dean of the Faculty of Law at the University of Lagos. Four years earlier he had received the LLD degree from the University of London for his work on African law and British colonial law. (He would go on to receive a total of 17 honorary doctorate degrees from various universities around the world). He was one of the inaugural recipients of the Nigerian National Merit Award in 1979. Several of his works on various legal subjects were standard reading in Africa in law schools of the former British colonies.

Later in 1966, Elias was re-appointed as Nigeria&#x27;s attorney-general and commissioner for justice (a position he held while remaining dean and professor at the University of Lagos), until 1972, when he became Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of Nigeria. He was ousted from this position by a military regime that took power in Nigeria at the end of July 1975.

A few months later (in October 1975), he was elected by the General Assembly and the Security Council of the United Nations to the International Court of Justice at The Hague. In 1979, he was elected vice-president by his colleagues on that court. In 1981, after the death of Sir Humphrey Waldock, the president of the court, Elias took over as acting president. In 1982, the members of the court elected him president of the court. He thus became the first African jurist to hold that honour. Five years later, Elias was also appointed to the Permanent Court of Arbitration at The Hague.

== Death ==
Elias died on 14 August 1991, in Lagos, Nigeria.

<text>William Greenleaf Eliot (August 5, 1811 – January 23, 1887) was an American educator, Unitarian minister, and civic leader in Missouri. He is most notable for founding Washington University in St. Louis, and also contributed to the founding of numerous other civic institutions, such as the Saint Louis Art Museum, public school system, and charitable institutions. The modernist poet T. S. Eliot was his grandson.

==Early life and education==
Eliot was born in New Bedford, Massachusetts, the son of Margaret Greenleaf (Dawes) and William Greenleaf Eliot. Eliot attended the Friends Academy in New Bedford.

Eliot attended Columbian College, which is now George Washington University, in Washington, D.C., where he graduated in 1831. He then attended Harvard Divinity School, where he graduated in 1834. The same year, on August 17, he was ordained as a minister of the Unitarian church.

==Career==
===Unitarian minister===
After his ordination, Eliot moved to St. Louis, where he lived until his death in 1887. In St. Louis, he founded the Church of the Messiah, the first Unitarian church west of the Mississippi River, which is currently the First Unitarian Church of Saint Louis. He led the congregation from 1834 to 1870, which included a period of rapid expansion in the city.

===Community involvement===
Eliot was active in civic life and was instrumental in founding many civic institutions, including the St. Louis Public Schools, the Saint Louis Art Museum, Mission Free School, South Side Day Nursery, and the Western Sanitary Commission to provide medical care and supplies during the Civil War. In 1861, he was part of a small group of men who helped Generals Nathaniel Lyon and Francis P. Blair to retain Missouri in the Union. He contributed to the development of the Colored Orphans&#x27; Home, Soldiers&#x27; Orphans&#x27; Home, Memorial Home, Blind Girls&#x27; Home, Women&#x27;s Christian Home, and other charitable institutions. When Ralph Waldo Emerson visited St. Louis, he met Eliot and called him &quot;the Saint of the West.&quot;

Eliot publicly associated himself with the American Colonization Society and served as president of the St. Louis&#x27;s Young Men&#x27;s Colonization Society. Despite his anti-slavery beliefs and acts of emancipating slaves and assisting in emancipation, he did not agree with Northern abolitionist politics but instead supported gradual emancipation to avoid Civil War.

===Washington University in St. Louis===
Eliot had a strong interest in developing educational opportunities in St. Louis. In 1853, he co-founded Washington University in St. Louis, initially called Eliot Seminary to his chagrin. He donated funds to its construction and served as its chancellor from 1870 to 1887. In 1859 he founded Mary Institute, a school for girls which he named after his daughter, who died young. It is now part of the co-educational Mary Institute and St. Louis Country Day School.

===Author===
Eliot was also a writer, publishing &quot;Doctrines of Christianity&quot;; &quot;Lectures to Young Men&quot;; &quot;Lectures to Young Women&quot; (re-printed as &quot;Home and Influence&quot;); &quot;Discipline of Sorrow&quot;; and &quot;The Story of Archer Alexander: From Slavery to Freedom&quot;. These ranged from works of theology in the Unitarian tradition to specific moral advice to young people. He advocated individual responsibility. In public policy, he supported women&#x27;s suffrage and prohibition of alcohol.

==Legacy and honors==
* Eliot was honored for his civic contributions with a star on the St. Louis Walk of Fame.
* Eliot Unitarian Chapel in Kirkwood, Missouri, is named for W. G. Eliot.

==Personal life==
The Eliots had 14 children but not all survived to adulthood. Among their children were Rev. Thomas Lamb Eliot, Regent and Trustee of Reed College, and Henry Ware Eliot, businessman. W.G. Eliot was the grandfather of poet T. S. Eliot, Martha May Eliot, a pediatrician and expert in public health and her sister, Abigail Adams Eliot, co-founder of the Eliot-Pearson School at Tufts University.

Dr. Eliot was the brother of Thomas D. Eliot, U.S. Congressman from Massachusetts. William Greenleaf Eliot&#x27;s wife, Abigail Adams Cranch, was the daughter of William Cranch, a nephew of Abigail Adams. William G. Eliot&#x27;s father, mother, and wife were first cousins of each other. Their mothers were three of the daughters of William Greenleaf (Elizabeth, Margaret and Nancy respectively.)

<doc id="779230" wikidata="Q948104" url="?curid=779230" title="Elipandus">
<text>Elipandus (717–805) was a Spanish theologian and the archbishop of Toledo from 782. He was condemned by the Catholic Church as an Adoptionist.

Six letters written by Elipandus survive, including one to Migetius and another on behalf of the bishops of Spain to the bishops of Francia. All in all, three of his letters address the Migetian controversy. He credited Bishop Ascaric of Braga with also fighting the &quot;Migetians&quot;.

Although he affirmed Catholic teaching that Jesus is true Son of God, eternally begotten from God the Father and thus of one divine nature with the Father, he also proposed that Jesus, as the son of David, according to his human nature was the adopted rather than the begotten son of God. Elipandus&#x27;s assertion seemed to suggest that Christ&#x27;s human nature existed separately from His divine personhood. Thus, it seemed to be a nuanced form of Nestorianism and came to be known as Adoptionism.

Elipandus&#x27;s teaching was condemned as heresy by the Councils of Ratisbon in 792 and of Frankfurt in 794. The heresy was rejected by the English theologian Alcuin who wrote, among many other works against adoptionism, a &quot;Treatise against Elipandus&quot; in four books. Paulinus II of Aquileia also composed a book refuting Elipandus unorthodox teachings for the Council of Frankfort.

<text>Hintlesham is a small village in Suffolk, England, situated roughly halfway between Ipswich and Hadleigh. It is in the Belstead Brook electoral division of Suffolk County Council.

The village is notable for Hintlesham Hall, a 16th-century Grade I listed country house, now operated as a hotel.

==The church==
The parish church of St Nicolas is a typical Decorated church, and therefore not typical for Suffolk. It has many memorials to the Tymperley family and the squint in the north wall shows that the vestry was once a chapel, possibly a chantry to the family, converted to secular use in the 1540s. The stairway to the roodloft in the south wall is one of the best preserved in the county. For about 350 years Hintlesham has been a joint parish with Chattisham whose church, St Margaret&#x27;s, stands about a mile away, separated by a valley of meadows and woods.

==Hintlesham Hall==
For six years from 1448, Hintlesham Manor, a single storey Tudor Hall, was owned by Sir John Fortescue who used one of the rooms as a local court. In 1454 the manor was purchased by John Timperley.

In August 1720 the hall was bought by Richard Powys, a Principal Clerk to The Treasury, and the Powys family lived there for nearly 30 years, after which it was sold to the lawyer Richard Lloyd, a future solicitor-general, and passed down through his descendants until the early 1900s.

In 1972 the hall was bought by chef Robert Carrier for £32,000 () and was restored. The business was later owned by the hotelier and broadcaster Ruth Watson and her husband. Today the hall is operated as a country-house hotel.

==Amenities==
The village has its own Church of England Voluntary Aided junior school.

The village public house is The George, the original premises of which burned down at the end of the 19th century.

<doc id="779236" wikidata="Q471281" url="?curid=779236" title="James Dunn (actor)">
<text>James Howard Dunn (November 2, 1901September 1, 1967), billed as Jimmy Dunn in his early career, was an American actor and vaudeville performer. The son of a New York stockbroker, he initially worked in his father&#x27;s firm but was more interested in theater. He landed jobs as an extra in short films produced by Paramount Pictures in its Long Island studio, and also performed with several stock theater companies, culminating with playing the male lead in the 1929 Broadway musical &quot;Sweet Adeline&quot;. This performance attracted the attention of film studio executives, and in 1931, Fox Film signed him to a Hollywood contract. 

His screen debut in the 1931 film &quot;Bad Girl&quot; made him an overnight box-office star and he was cast as the lead in a succession of romantic drama and comedy films. In 1934, he co-starred with Shirley Temple in her first three films. In 1935, at the height of his popularity, he broke his studio contract two years before it expired and became a free agent. With musicals on the wane in the late 1930s, he was cast in a series of B movies and struggled with alcoholism in his personal life. In 1945, having not worked for a major studio for five years, he was selected by director Elia Kazan for the role of Johnny Nolan, the dreamy alcoholic father in &quot;A Tree Grows in Brooklyn&quot; (1945), which earned him the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor. 

The Oscar did not advance his film career, however, and while he still found roles in Broadway productions, he became a character actor on television. He had a regular role in the hit sitcom &quot;It&#x27;s a Great Life&quot; from 1954 to 1956, and guest-starred in dozens of episodes of popular television series from the 1950s through mid-1960s. In 1960, his contributions to film and television were recognized with two stars on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.

==Early life==
James Howard Dunn was born on November 2, 1901, in Manhattan. His parents, Ralph H. Dunn (c. 1875–1943), a member of the New York Stock Exchange, and mother Jessie L. Archer (c. 1871–1946) had married in January 1901. He was their only child. He was of Irish descent. 

In December 1905, while wintering with his parents at Shippan Point, Connecticut, the four-year-old Dunn had a near-accident, reported in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, when a bulldog belonging to his babysitter lunged at him. He was unhurt. Dunn grew up in New Rochelle, New York, and attended school there. He often skipped high school classes to hang around film studios in the upper Bronx.

==Early film and stage career==
After graduation, Dunn tried his hand at sales, selling lunch wagons and also becoming an automobile demonstrator. He worked for three years in his father&#x27;s brokerage firm. But his real love was the theater. In 1927 he left his father&#x27;s employ to join a small theatrical troupe. He later said in a 1934 interview: &quot;I wasn&#x27;t at all sure I&#x27;d be a hit, or even an actor good enough to obtain reasonably steady work. But that didn&#x27;t make a lot of difference. I could not see any other career and I knew I wouldn&#x27;t be happy unless I tried it&quot;. He also sought out jobs as an extra in short films at Paramount Pictures&#x27; Long Island studios. He joined a stock theater company out of Englewood, New Jersey, for a 37-week engagement, and performed with another company, the Permanent Players, at the Playhouse Theatre in Winnipeg, Canada, for a 22-week run. With the latter troupe, he was said to be &quot;highly popular&quot; among theatre-goers for his &quot;pleasing, breezy personality&quot;. Upon his return to New York, he landed the male lead in the touring company of the musical &quot;Sweet Adeline&quot;, opposite Helen Morgan.

==Success in Hollywood==

Dunn&#x27;s Broadway performance attracted the attention of film studio executives. In 1931, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM), which conducted its screen tests at Fox Film&#x27;s Astoria Studios in Queens, New York, called Dunn in for a screen test. A Fox Film employee asked if they could also test Dunn, and had him read a scene from the stage production of &quot;Bad Girl&quot;. While MGM was not impressed with their result, Fox director Frank Borzage liked Dunn&#x27;s screen test and wanted to cast him in his upcoming film version of &quot;Bad Girl&quot;. Dunn signed a film contract with Fox a few days later and relocated to Hollywood; his mother came to live with him the following year. 

Dunn made his screen debut in &quot;Bad Girl&quot; (1931), which catapulted him and co-star Sally Eilers to &quot;overnight fame&quot;. A &quot;Baltimore Evening Sun&quot; review wrote: &quot;Without Dunn, &quot;Bad Girl&quot; would be just another movie. With him, it&#x27;s something that provokes chuckles, tears, laughs, sighs and everything else that a nice little movie hopes to provoke&quot;. The &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; called Dunn&#x27;s star turn &quot;triumphant&quot;, asserting that &quot;no performance has lately equaled the impression made by this rather plain young man, who, aside from having a likable personality, scores a major hit by his ability as an actor&quot;. 

Fox immediately re-teamed Dunn and Eilers in &quot;Over the Hill&quot; (1931), followed by &quot;Dance Team&quot; (1932), &quot;Sailor&#x27;s Luck&quot; (1933), and &quot;Hold Me Tight&quot; (1933). Dunn also played the lead in &quot;Sob Sister&quot; (1931), &quot;Society Girl&quot; (1932), and &quot;Hello, Sister!&quot; (1933). By the end of 1932, Dunn was considered &quot;one of the top 10 box office draws&quot;. By the end of 1933, he was being referred to as &quot;America&#x27;s boy friend&quot;.

===Shirley Temple co-star===

In 1934, Dunn appeared in seven films for Fox. Three of them were also the first three film appearances of six-year-old Shirley Temple. In &quot;Stand Up and Cheer!&quot;, Dunn and Temple play a father and daughter who perform in one song-and-dance sequence. Rather than have the young girl learn a new routine, the producers had Temple teach Dunn the steps to a tap-dance routine she had learned in her dancing school. Their memorable performance prompted studio executives to immediately cast them in a follow-up film, &quot;Baby Take a Bow&quot;, a remake of the 1928 silent film &quot;Square Crooks&quot;. Temple again plays Dunn&#x27;s daughter in this film, whose title was the name of Dunn and Temple&#x27;s song in &quot;Stand Up and Cheer!&quot; Their third film pairing was in &quot;Bright Eyes&quot;, a vehicle specifically written for Temple and co-starring Dunn as a bachelor pilot and friend of Temple&#x27;s deceased father who seeks to adopt her. Temple sings &quot;On the Good Ship Lollipop&quot; aboard Dunn&#x27;s character&#x27;s airplane in this film. Later that same year, Temple was cast in a small part as Dunn&#x27;s neighbor in &quot;Change of Heart&quot;.

Dunn and Temple worked well together. Temple later said that the day they began shooting their first film &quot;was the start of my great romance with Jimmy Dunn&quot;. She also appreciated the fact that Dunn treated her as a peer. Dunn admitted that he was initially worried about playing opposite Temple, saying: &quot;All actors dislike working with children. The kids usually steal most of your scenes, or run away with the picture entirely&quot;. Despite this, he admired Temple&#x27;s professionalism and professed to being one of her fans. Temple received top billing in each of their films, and her career soon eclipsed his.

==Career decline==
During his five years as a contract player with Fox, Dunn appeared in 30 films. In 1935, at the height of his popularity, Dunn broke his studio contract two years before its expiration. He was about to start filming a remake of &quot;The Song and Dance Man&quot;, but the project was shelved due to Fox&#x27;s merger with Twentieth Century Pictures. Dunn claimed he was &quot;dissatisfied with pictures recently given me – except those with Shirley Temple&quot;. He was reportedly reimbursed for the remainder of his contract.

In 1936, Dunn signed a two-picture deal with Republic Pictures, with &quot;Hearts in Bondage&quot; being his first starring turn for the studio. With musicals on the wane in the late 1930s, Dunn&#x27;s career slumped as he found roles in a series of &quot;mediocre comedies and melodramas&quot;.

His prospects were also hurt by his problem with alcoholism. He admitted to a &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; journalist in 1945 that he had often gone out for a few drinks with colleagues in the middle of the day while working on the Fox lot. According to Dorothy Lee, who worked alongside him on &quot;Take a Chance&quot; (1933), Dunn and co-star Lillian Roth took turns getting drunk during the production. Lee said: &quot;They were both darling people ... when they were sober. When they began drinking heavily, they couldn&#x27;t work at all. As soon as Jimmy sobered up, Lillian would go on a bender. They shot around them as much as they could, but they had scenes together and it was difficult to get them on the set at the same time. So I wound up staying in New York longer than I expected&quot;. During the filming of &quot;George White&#x27;s 1935 Scandals&quot;, shooting started in the late morning to accommodate Dunn and other members of the cast who frequently imbibed. As drinking affected Dunn&#x27;s performances in the late 1930s and early 1940s, he was regarded as &quot;unemployable&quot; by the major film studios. 

In 1940, Dunn returned to Broadway for an 87-week run in the hit musical &quot;Panama Hattie&quot; with Ethel Merman, to positive reviews. 

===Academy Award winner===

Dunn had not worked for a major studio for five years when he was called in to screen-test for the role of Johnny Nolan, the dreamy alcoholic father in the 20th Century Fox production &quot;A Tree Grows in Brooklyn&quot; (1945). Dunn had returned to Hollywood in 1944 to seek film roles but had not applied for this part for fear of another rejection. However, a friend, actress and dancer Gloria Grafton, urged casting directors involved in the extensive talent search to hire him. Director Elia Kazan said he chose Dunn for the role because drinking had impacted the actor&#x27;s career, and because he saw &quot;a trace of pain in Dunn&#x27;s face that indicated he had &#x27;failed the test of life&#x27; and [Kazan] wanted to bring that &#x27;pain&#x27; to the screen&quot;. Dunn reportedly drew from his own experiences for his characterization.

Critics widely hailed Dunn&#x27;s performance as his &quot;finest&quot;. The &quot;Pittsburgh Sun-Telegraph&quot; wrote: &quot;Mr. Dunn&#x27;s Johnny Nolan has the mark of greatness about it, and he has never done before, nor ever will again, anything of more sublime conviction&quot;. Bosley Crowther of &quot;The New York Times&quot; commended the strong screen chemistry achieved by Dunn and Peggy Ann Garner, who played his daughter Francie:

Little Miss Garner, with her plain face and lank hair, is Francie Nolan to the life. And James Dunn plays her father, Johnny Nolan, with deep and sympathetic tenderness. In the radiant performance by these two actors of a dreamy adoration between father and child is achieved a pictorial demonstration of emotion that is sublimely eloquent.

At the 18th Academy Awards ceremony, Dunn won the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor for his performance.

Winning the Oscar, however, did not revive his film prospects, and acting jobs were slow in coming. He returned to the role of an alcoholic father in &quot;Killer McCoy&quot; (1947) opposite Mickey Rooney, to complimentary reviews. His last film performance for nearly a decade was in the short film &quot;A Wonderful Life&quot; (1951), produced for the Christian film industry. Dunn appeared in four films in the 1960s, including another role as an alcoholic in &quot;The Bramble Bush&quot; (1960).

==Return to the stage==
In 1947, largely on the basis of his performance in &quot;A Tree Grows in Brooklyn&quot;, Dunn was cast as Jamie Tyrone, a man who resorted to drink to forget his unhappy past, in Eugene O&#x27;Neill&#x27;s semi-autobiographical play &quot;A Moon for the Misbegotten&quot;. Considered the &quot;name&quot; actor in the production, Dunn was given a run-of-the-play contract and $1,000 per week, compared to the $750 per week salary of fellow performer J. M. Kerrigan. During rehearsals, O&#x27;Neill was dissatisfied with Dunn&#x27;s portrayal of Tyrone, a character based on O&#x27;Neill&#x27;s brother, claiming that Dunn &quot;wasn&#x27;t playing the role with enough gentlemanliness&quot;. The director defended Dunn&#x27;s interpretation of the script. Meanwhile, Dunn felt out of his league playing tragedy rather than comedy. He had never seen an O&#x27;Neill play and said his wife had persuaded him to take the part for the &quot;prestige&quot;. The production budget was increased by 10% to enable dress rehearsals to take place in New York rather than in the first out-of-town tryout in Columbus, Ohio, in order to accommodate Dunn&#x27;s poor health. While Dunn&#x27;s performance garnered critical praise on the tour, he left the production before it reached Broadway.

In 1948, Dunn succeeded James Stewart in &quot;Harvey&quot;, appearing in 108 performances of the long-running Broadway play. In 1951, Dunn played Willy Loman in &quot;Death of a Salesman&quot; at the Norwich Summer Theater. In 1964, he played the title role in &quot;Finian&#x27;s Rainbow&quot; in a two-week summer engagement at the Melodyland Theatre in Anaheim, California.

==Television career==
In 1949, Dunn pursued a new direction as a character actor on television. He guest-starred in dozens of episodes of popular television series in the 1950s through mid-1960s, including &quot;Bonanza&quot;, &quot;Rawhide&quot;, &quot;Route 66&quot;, &quot;Ben Casey&quot;, and &quot;The Virginian&quot;. He had a regular role in the popular sitcom &quot;It&#x27;s a Great Life&quot;, which aired 78 episodes from 1954 to 1956. Dunn played Earl Morgan, the deadbeat brother-in-law of the main character, Amy Morgan (Frances Bavier), who was always concocting get-rich-quick schemes to interest Amy&#x27;s tenants, Steve Connors (William Bishop) and Denny Davis (Michael O&#x27;Shea). The three male comedians had good rapport and often ad-libbed their lines. The role required Dunn to play slapstick, which he had only done previously on stage.

In 1962, Dunn played a clown in full makeup and costume in an episode of &quot;Follow the Sun&quot;, and sang &quot;On the Good Ship Lollipop&quot; from his 1934 film &quot;Bright Eyes&quot;. In 1963 he played the character of P. J. Cunningham, the manager-driver for a music band led by Bobby Rydell, in the unsold Desilu half-hour television pilot &quot;Swingin&#x27; Together&quot;.

==Screen persona and recognition==

Dunn&#x27;s smile, described as &quot;sunny&quot;, &quot;whimsical&quot;, &quot;infectious&quot;, and &quot;winning&quot;, was often singled out as an asset. The &quot;Arcadia Tribune&quot; claimed Dunn&#x27;s smile was &quot;patterned after the one the Prince of Wales uses&quot;. 

In his Hollywood heyday in the 1930s, Dunn was noted for his &quot;clean-cut good looks and boyish charm&quot;. As he matured, &quot;The New York Times&quot; described Dunn&#x27;s &quot;trademark&quot; as an &quot;expression of slightly battered wistfulness&quot;. The Associated Press characterized Dunn&#x27;s later screen persona as &quot;a well-meaning type of fellow whom women marry to mother&quot;.

Dunn was honored with two stars on the Hollywood Walk of Fame—one for his contributions to motion pictures at 6555 Hollywood Boulevard, and one for his contributions to television at 7010 Hollywood Boulevard. Both were dedicated on February 8, 1960.

==Personal life==

Even after his rise to stardom, Dunn was described as &quot;unaffected and friendly&quot;. On the set of &quot;Hold Me Tight&quot; (1933), he insisted on filling in for an extra who was going home sick and who had confided to Dunn that he could not afford to lose his day&#x27;s pay of $7.50. Author Pete Haynes, a Malibu, California, resident who played with Dunn&#x27;s adopted son, Billy Pick, in the 1950s, remembers Dunn as &quot;down to earth and friendly toward every person he came in contact with&quot;. 

Dunn&#x27;s sense of humor was often evident. To commemorate the leap year of 1936, he announced a $50 prize to the woman who could send him the best proposal, with a $25 prize for the runner-up. He received a total of 10,000 submissions and awarded first prize to a 20-year-old native of Oklahoma, who wrote him a four-page poem. An Associated Press wire photo showed the two sharing a toast at Dunn&#x27;s studio in January 1937. Dunn awarded the second prize to a woman from Fort Beaufort, South Africa, and sent runner-up gifts to three other American women.

When he was not working, Dunn enjoyed playing golf and flying his airplane. He earned a pilot&#x27;s license shortly after his arrival in California, having received training from Bob Blair, a charter pilot at Los Angeles Municipal Airport, who described him as &quot;ultra-conservative&quot; in the air. By 1940, Dunn had logged 750 flying hours. While under contract to Fox, however, the studio forbade him from participating in the 1935 Ruth Chatterton Air Derby.

===Marriages===

Dunn was married three times. His first marriage ended in divorce in 1922. On Christmas Day 1937, Dunn and his fiancée, 17-year-old actress Frances Gifford, flew in his plane to Yuma, Arizona, to be married in a Presbyterian church there and afterwards returned to Hollywood. The couple later starred together in &quot;Mercy Plane&quot; (1939) and &quot;Hold That Woman!&quot; (1940). The marriage failed in 1942 as Dunn&#x27;s career was in decline and he was struggling with alcoholism; their divorce was finalized in 1943. In 1945 Dunn married his third wife, singer Edna Rush, who survived him. Dunn adopted Rush&#x27;s three-and-a-half-year-old son Billy.

===Finances===
In the 1930s, Dunn&#x27;s weekly earnings were in the thousands of dollars; he also charged $5,000 for a personal appearance tour. His mother took charge of his finances and invested most of his earnings in stocks, bonds, real estate, and trust funds, giving him a weekly allowance. As a result, after Dunn left Fox and his career slumped, he had financial security. Upon his 1938 marriage, Dunn&#x27;s mother gave him control of his portfolio. Thereafter Dunn lost a $40,000 option on a play, &quot;Cock of the Walk&quot;, that failed to reach Broadway, as well as thousands of dollars in the stock market. He was forced to sell his $50,000 house and move to a two-bedroom apartment in Malibu, from where he commuted to Hollywood.
In October 1951, he filed for bankruptcy. However, his mother had reserved one trust fund for him which matured when he turned 50 and paid out $900 per month for life.

===Death===
Dunn died on September 1, 1967, aged 65, from complications following stomach surgery at Santa Monica Hospital. His funeral service in Santa Monica was attended by some 200 people, including fellow actors. His body was cremated and his ashes strewn at sea.

<text>Stephen Benton Elkins (September 26, 1841January 4, 1911) was an American industrialist and politician. He served as the Secretary of War between 1891 and 1893. He served in the United States Congress as a Delegate from the Territory of New Mexico and a Senator from West Virginia.

==Biography==

===Early life===
Stephen Benton Elkins was born on September 26, 1841, near New Lexington, Ohio and moved with his family to Westport, Missouri (now part of Kansas City) in the mid-1840s. His parents were Philip Duncan Elkins and Sarah Pickett Withers. He attended the Masonic College in Lexington, Missouri in the 1850s, and graduated from the University of Missouri in Columbia in 1860. After graduation, he briefly taught school in Cass County, Missouri. Among his pupils was future James-Younger Gang member Cole Younger.

===Civil War===
In the American Civil War Elkins&#x27; father and brother joined the Confederate Army under Sterling Price, but he joined the Union Army. Before he joined the Union Army he was to encounter Quantrill&#x27;s Raiders twice and was spared from being killed because of his father and brother. He noted:
Elkins entered the Union Army as a captain of militia in the 77th Missouri Infantry. He served under Kersey Coates and only saw action once in the Battle of Lone Jack, which he said filled him with disgust for war. Elkins noted that his good fortune of being protected by Quantrill matched a fear of being butchered by Quantrill for becoming a Union soldier as Quantrill&#x27;s Raiders were thought to be present at the battle.

Elkins and Foster from the Lone Jack Battle were to argue for a pardon for Younger following his conviction in the Northfield, Minnesota bank robbery (Younger had rescued Foster from execution by Quantrill&#x27;s Raiders in the battle).

===New Mexico===
Elkins entered the practice of law at Mesilla, New Mexico, and was elected to the territorial legislature in 1864 and 1865. He was appointed territorial district attorney for a term from 1866 to 1867. It was at this time, on June 10, 1866, that he married his first wife Sarah Simms Jacobs.

In 1867, Elkins served as attorney general of the territory and later as U.S. district attorney from 1867 to 1870. He was elected territorial delegate to the U.S. Congress in 1872, and reelected in 1874, serving from March 4, 1873, to March 4, 1877. In 1875, he met and married his second wife, Hallie Davis, and continued to practice law. He founded and was president of the Santa Fe National Bank, and pursued broad business interests in land, rail, mining, and finance including president of the massive Maxwell Land Grant Company. It is widely believed that the boundaries of the land grant were expanded by Maxwell through fraud. In attempting to evict &quot;squatters&quot; (legitimate land grant heirs) from the Land Grant he would be accused of being part of the Santa Fe Ring. Along with his brother in law, Thomas B. Catron, Elkins participated in what would become the largest land speculation conspiracy in U.S. history. Using his influence on politicians such as congressmen, territorial judges, and U.S. Surveyors General, Elkins was able to patent Spanish and Mexican land grants in his name, thereby illegally including himself as a legitimate heir to the grants. By collectively representing opposing parties in land disputes, Elkins and Catron effectively manipulated territorial government policy to illegally partition Spanish and Mexican land grants, a direct violation of the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo.

===West Virginia===
Elkins married Hallie Davis, daughter of Senator Henry G. Davis of West Virginia, in 1875. He became a citizen of West Virginia in 1878 and began developing oil, coal, and timber industries with his father-in-law. They partnered to form the Davis Coal and Coke Company.

Stephen and Hallie built their home, Halliehurst, in Randolph County, and the town of Elkins was established nearby. New York architect Charles T. Mott designed the house. It was given by his widow along with surrounding property to Davis and Elkins College and is now part of the college&#x27;s campus. It is individually listed on the National Register of Historic Places and also is a contributing property in the Davis and Elkins Historic District.

===Secretary of War===
Elkins served as Secretary of War in the Benjamin Harrison administration from December 17, 1891, to March 5, 1893. He was appointed owing to close friendship with Secretary of State James G. Blaine. Amongst his goals were that the rank of lieutenant general be revived, and also that noncommissioned officers receive higher pay to improve the quality of the service. He also broadened the intelligence functions of the Division of Military Information.

===U.S. Senator===
After his service as Secretary, Elkins was elected to the U.S. Senate in 1895, serving the state of West Virginia, and was re-elected twice. In the Senate, he held the positions of chairman of the Committee on the Geological Survey (Fifty-sixth and Fifty-ninth Congresses), and of member of the Committee on Interstate Commerce (Fifty-seventh through Sixty-first Congresses). Elkins served as Senator until his death in Washington, D.C. in 1911, and is interred in Maplewood Cemetery of Elkins, West Virginia.

<text>The Glen Waverley line is a commuter railway line in the city of Melbourne, Victoria, Australia. Operated by Metro Trains Melbourne, it is the city&#x27;s sixth shortest metropolitan railway line at . The line runs from Flinders Street station in central Melbourne to Glen Waverley station in the east, serving 20 stations including Burnley, Kooyong, East Malvern, and Jordanville. The line operates for approximately 19 hours a day (from approximately 5:15 am to around 12:00 am) with 24 hour service available on Friday and Saturday nights. The line operates with headways of up to 10 minutes during peak hours and as long as 30 minutes during off-peak hours. Trains on the Glen Waverley line run with two three-car formations of X&#x27;Trapolis 100 trainsets.

Sections of the Glen Waverley line opened as early as 1890, with the line fully extended to Glen Waverley in 1930. The line was built to connect Melbourne with the rural towns of Kooyong, East Malvern, Mt Waverley, and Glen Waverley, amongst others.

Since the 2010s, due to the heavily utilised infrastructure of the Glen Waverley line, significant improvements and upgrades have been made. Different packages of works have upgraded the corridor to replace sleepers, upgrade signalling technology, introduce new rolling stock, and remove 2 out of the 6 remaining level crossings.

== History ==

=== 19th century ===
A rail connection from Princes Bridge station to Punt Road (Richmond) was built by the Melbourne and Suburban Railway Company in 1859, with a branch line from Richmond to Burnley opening in 1861. In 1890, part of what would become the Glen Waverley line opened from Burnley to Darling. At the same time in 1890, a line known as the Outer Circle line opened, running from Oakleigh station to Darling, continuing to Burnley with the line continuing north to Riversdale and beyond. The Outer Circle closed in sections between 1893 and 1897, with the Burnley to Waverley Road section of the line closing back to Darling in 1895.

=== 20th century ===
Electrification of the line to Glen Waverley occurred in three stages between 1922 and 1930. In March 1922, the section from Burnley to Darling station was electrified, with the section to East Malvern being electrified in June 1929, and the final section to Glen Waverley being completed by May 1930. The electrification of the line allowed for the introduction of Swing Door electric multiple unit trains for the first time.

The introduction of power signalling on the line begun in 1919 with the section from Richmond to East Richmond, with the remainder of the line converted in stages from 1922 to 1964. In 1929, the Glen Waverley line began construction on an extension from Darling to East Malvern along the original track of the Outer Circle line. The Outer Circle line previously begun its curve south towards Waverley Road and Oakleigh. The Glen Waverley line continued east towards Holmesglen.

The 1950s saw the line undergo major upgrades, including the first centralised traffic control installation in Australia. Commissioned in September 1957 at a length of in length, the Victorian Railways installed it as a prototype for the North East standard project. On 6 February 1956, the Toorak Road level crossing between Kooyong and Tooronga stations was the first in Victoria to receive boom barriers, replacing hand operated gates.

New Comeng trains were introduced to the Melbourne railway system in 1981. Initially, along with the Glen Waverley line, they were only allowed to operate on the Alamein, Belgrave, Dandenong and Lilydale lines, due to the width of the trains (). Also in 1981, Glen Waverley line services commenced operations through the City Loop, after previously terminating at Flinders or Spencer Street stations. The commencement of operations involved the service stopping at three new stations—Parliament, Melbourne Central (formally Museum), and Flagstaff. The Loop follows La Trobe and Spring Streets along the northern and eastern edges of the Hoddle Grid. The Loop connects with Melbourne&#x27;s two busiest stations, Flinders Street and Southern Cross, via the elevated Flinders Street Viaduct.

Many stations were rebuilt and level crossings removed along the corridor through the construction of road bridges during the 1970s to the late 1980s. These works coincided with the construction of the Monash Freeway which runs alongside the route for part of the journey.

=== 21st century ===

In 2014, the Level Crossing Removal Project announced the removal of 2 level crossings on the Glen Waverley line, to be completed in 2016 and 2020. The removal of Burke Road, Glen Iris involved the lowering of the rail line and the reconstruction of Gardiner station. This was the first crossing to be removed by the project and was completed in 2016. The second removal involved raising the rail corridor above Toorak Road, Kooyong, with the crossing removed by early 2020. With the removal of 2 level crossings along the corridor, only 4 crossings now remain on the Glen Waverley line.

In 2021, the metropolitan timetable underwent a major rewrite, resulting in all Glen Waverley line trains operating via the City Loop alongside Alamein, Belgrave, and Lilydale services.

In 2023, data from Public Transport Victoria found that the Glen Waverley line was the most on-time train service on the network. Commuters on the Craigieburn line faced the highest train delays, with 10.6% of services arriving late between March 2022 and February 2023. The Pakenham line experienced the most cancellations in the city&#x27;s south-east, at 3.1%, excluding lines with fewer services. On the positive side, the Glen Waverley line was the top performer, boasting 97.1% on-time arrivals during the same period.

== Network and operations ==

=== Services ===
Services on the Glen Waverley line operates from approximately 5:15 am to around 12:00 am daily. During peak hours train frequency is 5–10 minutes while service during non-peak hours drops to 10–30 minutes throughout the entire route. On Friday nights and weekends, services run 24 hours a day, with 60 minute frequencies available outside of normal operating hours.

Train services on the line are also subjected to maintenance and renewal works, usually on selected Fridays and Saturdays. Shuttle bus services are provided throughout the duration of works for affected commuters.

=== Operators ===
The Glen Waverley line has had a total of 6 operators since its opening in 1888. The majority of operations throughout its history have been government run: from its first service in 1888 until the 1999 privatisation of Melbourne&#x27;s rail network, four different government operators have run the line. These operators, Victorian Railways, the Metropolitan Transit Authority, the Public Transport Corporation and Hillside Trains have a combined operational length of 111 years. Hillside Trains was privatised in August 1999 and later rebranded Connex Melbourne. Metro Trains Melbourne, the current private operator, then took over the operations in 2009. Both private operators have had a combined operational period of years.
=== Route ===
The Glen Waverley line forms a mostly curved route from the Melbourne central business district to its terminus in Glen Waverley. The route is long and is predominantly doubled tracked. Between Flinders Street station and Richmond, the track is widened to 12 tracks, narrowing to 4 tracks between Richmond and Burnley before again narrowing to 2 tracks between Burnley and Glen Waverley. After departing from its terminus at Flinders Street, the Glen Waverley line traverses both flat and hilly country with few curves and fairly minimal earthworks for most of the line. The journey from Holmesglen to the terminus involves some of the steepest grades in Melbourne (1 in 30). Sections of the line have been elevated or lowered into a cutting to eliminate level crossings. However, a small number of level crossings are still present with no current plans to remove them.

The line follows the same alignment as the Alamein, Belgrave, and Lilydale lines with the four services splitting onto different routes at Burnley. The Glen Waverley line goes on its south eastern alignment, whereas the Alamein, Belgrave, and Lilydale lines take an eastern alignment towards their final destinations. The rail line goes through built-up suburbs towards its terminus in Glen Waverley.

=== Stations ===
The line serves 20 stations across of track. The stations are a mix of elevated, lowered, underground, and ground level designs. Underground stations are present only in the City Loop, with the majority of elevated and lowered stations being constructed as part of level crossing removals. 

== Infrastructure ==

=== Rolling stock ===
The Glen Waverley line uses X&#x27;Trapolis 100 electric multiple unit (EMU) trains operating in a two three-car configuration, with three doors per side on each carriage, and can accommodate up to 432 seated passengers in each six-car configuration. The trains were originally built between 2002 and 2004 as well as between 2009 and 2020 with a total of 212 three-car sets constructed. The trains are shared with 7 other metropolitan train lines and have been in service since 2003. Comeng trains are approved for revenue service on the line, but they don&#x27;t run due to the abundance of X&#x27;trapolis trains.

Alongside the passenger trains, Glen Waverley line tracks and equipment are maintained by a fleet of engineering trains. The four types of engineering trains are: the shunting train; designed for moving trains along non-electrified corridors and for transporting other maintenance locomotives, for track evaluation; designed for evaluating track and its condition, the overhead inspection train; designed for overhead wiring inspection, and the infrastructure evaluation carriage designed for general infrastructure evaluation. Most of these trains are repurposed locomotives previously used by V/Line, Metro Trains, and the Southern Shorthaul Railroad.

=== Accessibility ===

In compliance with the Disability Discrimination Act of 1992, all stations that are newly built or rebuilt are fully accessible. Half of stations on the corridor haven&#x27;t been upgraded to meet these guidelines. These stations do feature ramps, however, they have a gradient greater than 1 in 14. Stations that are fully accessible feature ramps that have a gradient less than 1 in 14, have at-grade paths, or feature lifts. These stations typically also feature tactile boarding indicators, independent boarding ramps, wheelchair accessible myki barriers, hearing loops, and widened paths.

Projects improving station accessibility have included the Level Crossing Removal Project, which involves station rebuilds and upgrades, and individual station upgrade projects. These works have made significant strides in improving network accessibility, with half of Glen Waverley line stations classed as fully accessible. Potential future station upgrade projects will continue to increase the number of fully accessible stations over time.

=== Signalling ===
The Glen Waverley line uses three position signalling which is widely used across the Melbourne train network. Three position signalling was first introduced on the line in 1919, with the final section of the line converted to the new type of signalling in 1964.

<doc id="779250" wikidata="Q363276" url="?curid=779250" title="Allen J. Ellender">
<text>Allen Joseph Ellender (September 24, 1890 – July 27, 1972) was an American politician and lawyer who was a U.S. senator from Louisiana from 1937 until his death. He was a Democrat who was originally allied with Huey Long. As Senator he had a generally conservative record, voting 77% of the time with the Conservative Coalition on domestic issues. A staunch segregationist, he signed the Southern Manifesto in 1956, voted against the Voting Rights Act of 1965, and opposed anti-lynching legislation in 1938. Unlike many Democrats he was not a &quot;hawk&quot; in foreign policy and opposed the Vietnam War.

Ellender served as President Pro Tempore, and the chair of the Senate Appropriations Committee. He also served as the chair of the Senate Agriculture Committee for over 18 years.

==Early life==
Ellender was born in the town of Montegut in Terrebonne Parish. He was the son of Victoria Marie (Javeaux) and Wallace Richard Ellender, Sr. He attended public and private schools, and in 1909 he graduated with a Bachelor of Arts degree from the Roman Catholic St. Aloysius College in New Orleans. (It has been reorganized as Brother Martin High School). He graduated from Tulane University Law School with an LL.B. in 1913, was admitted to the bar later that year, and launched his practice in Houma.

===World War I===
Though he received a draft deferment for World War I, Ellender volunteered for military service. Initially rejected on medical grounds after being diagnosed with a kidney stone, Ellender persisted in attempting to serve in uniform. After surgery and recovery, Ellender inquired through his Congressman about obtaining a commission in the Army&#x27;s Judge Advocate General Corps, and was offered a commission as an interpreter and translator in the United States Marine Corps, which he declined over concerns that because he spoke Louisiana French, he might not be proficient enough in the formal French language.

While taking courses to improve his French, he also applied for a position in the Student Army Training Corps at Tulane University. He was accepted into the program in October 1918, and reported to Camp Martin on the Tulane University campus. The war ended in November, and the SATC program was disbanded, so Ellender was released from the service in December before completing his training. Despite attempts lasting into the late 1920s to secure an honorable discharge as proof of his military service, Ellender was unsuccessful in obtaining one. Instead, the commander of Camp Martin replied to an inquiry from Ellender&#x27;s congressman that &quot;Private Allen J. Ellender&quot; had been released from military service in compliance with an army order prohibiting new enlistments in the SATC after the Armistice of November 11, 1918. As his career progressed, his biography often included the incorrect claim that Ellender had served as a sergeant in the United States Army Artillery Corps during the war.

===State politics===
Ellender was a delegate to the Louisiana constitutional convention in 1921. The constitution produced by that body was retired in 1974, two years after Ellender&#x27;s death. He served in the Louisiana House of Representatives from 1924 to 1936. He was floor leader from 1928 to 1932, when in 1929 he worked successfully against the impeachment forces, led by Ralph Norman Bauer and Cecil Morgan, that attempted to remove Governor Huey Long for a litany of abuses of power. Ellender was the House Speaker from 1932 to 1936, when he was elected to the US Senate.

==U.S. Senator==
In 1937 he took his Senate seat, formerly held by the fallen Huey Long and slated for the Democratic nominee Oscar Kelly Allen, Sr., of Winnfield, the seat of Long&#x27;s home parish of Winn. Allen had won the Democratic nomination by a plurality exceeding 200,000 votes, but he died shortly thereafter. His passing enabled Ellender&#x27;s election. The Democrats had so dominated state politics since the disfranchisement of most blacks at the turn of the century, that the primary was the decisive election for offices.

Ellender was one of twenty liberal Democratic senators in July 1937 who voted against killing the Judicial Procedures Reform Bill of 1937, which was introduced by President Franklin D. Roosevelt in an effort to pack the United States Supreme Court following several anti-New Deal decisions from the Court.

Ellender was repeatedly re-elected to the Senate and served until his death in 1972. He gained seniority and great influence. He was the leading sponsor of the federal free lunch program, which was enacted in 1945 and continues; it was a welfare program that helped poor students.

In 1946, Ellender defended fellow Southern demagogue Theodore Bilbo, who incited violence against blacks in his re-election campaign. When a petition was filed to the Senate, a committee chaired by Ellender investigated the voter suppression. Ellender defended the violent attacks on blacks trying to vote as the result of &quot;tradition and custom&quot; rather than Bilbo&#x27;s incitements. The committee voted on party lines to clear Bilbo, with the three Democrats siding with the Mississippi demagogue while the two conservative Republicans, Bourke Hickenlooper of Iowa and Styles Bridges of New Hampshire, dissented from the verdict. Bilbo, however, ultimately did not take his Senate seat due to medical issues and died a short time later.

Ellender served as the powerful chairman of the Senate Agriculture Committee from 1951 to 1953 and 1955 to 1971, through which capacity he was a strong defender of sugar cane interests. He chaired the even more powerful Senate Appropriations Committee from 1971 until his death. Denoting his seniority as a Democrat in the Senate, Ellender was President pro tempore of the U.S. Senate from 1971 to 1972, an honorific position.

Ellender was an opponent of Republican Senator Joseph McCarthy of Wisconsin, who had achieved national prominence through a series of well-publicized speeches and investigations attacking supposed communist infiltration in the US government, army and educational institutions during the 1950s.

In March 1952, Ellender stated the possibility of the House of Representatives electing the president in that year&#x27;s general election and added that the possibility could arise from the entry of Georgia Senator Richard Russell, Jr. into the general election as a third-party candidate and thereby see neither President Truman or Republican Senator Robert A. Taft able to secure enough votes from the Electoral College.

Ellender strongly opposed the federal civil rights legislation of the 1960s, which included the Voting Rights Act of 1965 to enforce blacks&#x27; constitutional rights in voting. Many, particularly in the Deep South, had been disfranchised since 1900. In the aftermath of the Duck Hill lynchings, he also helped block a proposed anti-lynching bill which had previously been passed in the House, proclaiming, &quot;We shall at all cost preserve the white supremacy of America.&quot; He did support some Louisiana state legislation sought by civil rights groups, such as repeal of the state poll tax (a disfranchisement mechanism).

In late 1962 he underwent a tour of East Africa. In Southern Rhodesia he spoke to the media and was reported by a newspaper to have said he did not believe African territories were ready for self-governance and &quot;incapable of leadership&quot; without the assistance of white people. He was further reported to have said apartheid in South Africa was a proper policy choice and should have been instituted sooner. Ellender later denied making these remarks, but Uganda and Tanganyika responded to the allegations by barring him from entering their countries.

On August 31, 1964, during President Johnson&#x27;s signing of the Food Stamp Act of 1964, the president noted Ellender as one of the members of Congress he wanted to compliment for playing &quot;a role in the passage of this legislation&quot;.

==Last campaign, death, and aftermath==

In 1972, the Democratic gubernatorial runner-up from December 1971, former state senator J. Bennett Johnston, Jr., of Shreveport, challenged Ellender for renomination. Ellender was expected to defeat Johnston, but he died from a heart attack on July 27, aged 81, at Bethesda Naval Hospital. Nearly 10 percent of Democratic voters, however, still voted for the deceased Ellender.

The Ellender family endorsed McKeithen in the 1972 general election because of resentment over Johnston&#x27;s entry into the race against Ellender.
Ellender&#x27;s immediate successor was not Johnston but Elaine S. Edwards, first wife of Governor Edwin Edwards, who was appointed to fill his seat from August 1, 1972, to November 13, 1972. Six days after the election, Johnston was appointed to finish Ellender&#x27;s remaining term to gain a seniority advantage over other freshman senators.

<text>George Frank Elliott (November 30, 1846 – November 4, 1931) was a United States Marine Corps major general. He was the tenth Commandant of the Marine Corps between 1903 and 1910.

==Biography==
George Elliott, born in Eutaw, Alabama, was appointed to the United States Military Academy in 1868 and was honorably discharged in June 1870 upon the completion of two-years of the four-year course of study there.

In October 1870, he was appointed a second lieutenant in the Marine Corps by the President of the United States. Second Lieutenant Elliott served at the Marine Barracks, Washington, D.C., from the time of his appointment to the Marine Corps until 1871, when he was transferred to Portsmouth, New Hampshire. He later served on , , and , and was on duty at the Marine Barracks at Norfolk, Virginia, in 1877 when a battalion of Marines was ordered to that post from Washington, D.C. during the strike of railway employees. He was in command of the detachment that guarded the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad tunnel and also acted as guard for the paymaster of the railroad. He returned to Norfolk upon detachment from that duty. He was promoted to first lieutenant in 1878.

In 1880, First Lieutenant Elliott was ordered to duty on board and served at the Marine Barracks, Boston, Massachusetts, from 1882 to 1884, when he returned to Norfolk. He was with the Marine battalion sent to the Isthmus of Panama in 1885. He was promoted to captain in 1892.

In 1894, he was attached to as Fleet Marine Officer when that ship was sent to China to guard American interests during the war between Japan and China. He and his men made a forced march to Seoul, a distance of , part of which was through submerged rice fields, in eleven hours.

In June 1895, Captain Elliott was sent to the Marine Barracks, Brooklyn, New York, and from 22 April to 22 September 1898, he was on duty with the 1st Marine Battalion with the North Atlantic Fleet. The fleet was sent to hold its position at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.

On 14 July 1898, Elliott was in command of Companies C and D, composed of 150 Marines and 50 Cubans, which were ordered to destroy the well at Cuzco, about from Guantanamo, and the only water supply of the Spaniards within . from Cuzco, half of the Cubans and the first platoon of Company C passed over a mountain to the left, hoping to cut off the Spanish pickets. In this they failed, and the main force was discovered by the Spanish outpost, which retreated immediately and gave the alarm to the main body, whose headquarters were in a house at Cuzco. A high mountain separated the two forces at this point and each attempted to gain its crest as a point of vantage. The Marines were successful, but were fired on heavily by the enemy from the valley. Following a straggling retreat by the Spaniards, the Marines began the return march, the well having been destroyed. For his eminent and conspicuous conduct in this engagement, Captain Elliott&#x27;s seniority in his grade was advanced three numbers.

Later in 1898, upon his return to the United States, he became a Veteran Companion of the Pennsylvania Commandery of the Military Order of Foreign Wars.

In October 1898, he was detached from the Marine Barracks in Brooklyn and ordered to the Marine Barracks at the Washington Navy Yard. He was promoted to Major (United States) in March 1899.

In August 1899, Major Elliott was ordered to command the Second Battalion of Marines for duty in the Philippines and was promoted to lieutenant colonel in September of that year. From October 1899 to January 1900, Lt. Col Elliott commanded the First Brigade of Marines in the Philippines. During this period he engaged in the Battle of Novaleta. For his conduct during this battle, he was personally commended by Secretary of the Navy Long. Secretary Long wrote:
On his return to the United States he was on duty at Norfolk until 1903, when he was given command of the Marine Barracks, Washington, D.C., and promoted to colonel in March 1903.

On 3 October 1903, he was appointed Brigadier General Commandant of the Marine Corps, relieving Major General Charles Heywood. In December 1903, he was ordered to command a Provisional Brigade of Marines organized for service in Panama. He departed on 27, December with the brigade on board , arriving at Colón on 3 January 1904, and went into camp at Haute Obispo, Panama. He relinquished command of the brigade on 15 February 1904, and resumed his duties at Headquarters Marine Corps on the 25th of the same month.

On 21 May 1908, he was appointed Major General Commandant of the Marine Corps. One of the most difficult endeavors of General Elliott&#x27;s career was his successful resistance to attempts to remove seagoing Marines from capital ships and to merge the Corps into the Army. Also during his tenure, the home post of the Corps, the Marine Barracks at 8th and I Streets SE in Washington, D.C., underwent major changes. In 1903, the old barracks were condemned and pulled down and by 1910 had been rebuilt essentially in their present form. He was placed on the retired list on 30 November 1910 upon reaching the statutory retirement age.

Major General Elliott died at his home in Washington, D.C., shortly after noon 4 November 1931 after a brief illness. His remains were interred in the Arlington National Cemetery.

==Legacy==
USS &quot;George F. Elliott&quot; (AP-13), a Heywood-class transport (1918–1942), was named in honor of Major General Elliott. The ship was sunk off Guadalcanal in 1942.

USS &quot;George F. Elliott&quot; (AP-105) was also named after him. The second &quot;Elliott&quot; was commissioned on 23 September 1943 and decommissioned on 10 June 1946.

General Elliott&#x27;s nephew was Vice Admiral Elliott Buckmaster, USN (1889–1976). VADM Buckmaster commanded the USS &quot;Yorktown&quot; when she was sunk at the Battle of Midway.

Camp Elliott, a Marine Corp Tanks, artillery, and infantry training facility near Camp Kearny in San Diego County, east of the Miramar Marine Corps Airfield, was renamed after George F. Elliott (formerly Camp Holcomb) in 1940. The camp was instrumental in training the landing forces for the Pacific Campaign against the Japanese in WWII.

<text>Maxine Elliott (February 5, 1868 – March 5, 1940) also known as Little Jessie, Dettie or by her birth name Jessie Dermott, was an American actress and businesswoman. She managed her own theater and experimented with silent films in the 1910s. Immensely popular, she was rumored to have intimate relationships with highly notable people such as King Edward VII and J.P. Morgan. During World War I, she was active on the cause of the Belgian relief.

==Early life==
Born on February 5, 1868, to Thomas Dermot, a sea captain and Adelaide Hill Dermot, she had a younger sister, actress Gertrude Elliott and at least two brothers, one of whom, a sailor, was lost at sea in the Indian Ocean.

By age 15 in 1883, Jessie had been seduced and made pregnant by a 25-year-old man whom she may have married underage, according to the biography by Diana Forbes-Robertson, her niece. She either miscarried or lost the baby. This incident left a psychological wound on her for the rest of her life.

Eliott later developed a relationship with a man from a rich local family, Arthur Hall. When suspicions of her pregnancy developed and when her relationship with Hall was eventually exposed, she and her father left for South America. In her later years she would make bitter remarks about the separation between her and Hall.

==Acting==

She adopted her stage name &quot;Maxine Elliott&quot; in 1889, making her first appearance in 1890 in &quot;The Middleman&quot;.

In 1895, she got her first big break when Augustin Daly hired her as a supporting actress for his star player, Ada Rehan. After divorcing her first husband, Elliott married comedian Nat C. Goodwin in 1898. The two starred together at home and abroad in such hits as &quot;Nathan Hale&quot; and &quot;The Cowboy and the Lady&quot;.

For her appearance in a production of &quot;The Merchant of Venice&quot;, she negotiated a contract for $200 and one-half of the profits over $20,000. She was billed alone when Charles B. Dillingham&#x27;s production of &quot;Her Own Way&quot; opened on Broadway on September 28, 1903. From then on, Elliott was a star. When the production moved to London in 1905, King Edward VII asked that she be presented to him, and they were rumoured to have had an intimate relationship.

Goodwin eventually divorced Elliott in 1908. Around this time she became friendly with financier J. P. Morgan. Some biographers of Morgan claim the seventy-year-old Morgan had a sexual relationship with Elliott but no evidence substantiates these rumours. Assuredly Morgan gave her financial advice, which helped her become a rich woman. Shortly after divorcing Goodwin, she returned to New York City and in 1908 opened her own theater, &quot;The Maxine Elliott&quot;, located on 39th Street near Broadway.

She was both owner and manager, and, at the time, the only woman in the United States running her own theater. Her first production was &quot;The Chaperon&quot;. She experimented with acting in silent films in 1913. In that year, she was in &quot;Slim Driscoll, Samaritan&quot;, &quot;When the West Was Young&quot; and &quot;A Doll for the Baby&quot;, but she soon returned to Britain. In 1913, she started dating New Zealand&#x27;s tennis star Anthony Wilding, who was over 15 years her junior, with &quot;The Seattle Star&quot; calling him her lover.

According to the &quot;Star&quot; she had planned to marry Wilding, but he was killed on May 9, 1915, at the Battle of Aubers Ridge in World War I. After his death she reportedly became obsessed with the War and moved to Belgium. There she volunteered both her income and her time to the cause of the Belgian relief, being rewarded with the Belgian Order of the Crown. 

In 1917, Elliott returned to the U.S. and signed with the newly formed Goldwyn Pictures to make the 1917 film &quot;Fighting Odds&quot; and 1919 film &quot;The Eternal Magdalene&quot;. Elliott can be seen visiting Charlie Chaplin&#x27;s studios in 1918 and cavorting with him and her entourage before Chaplin&#x27;s cameras. Her visit to Chaplin survives and is sometimes included in omnibus videos on Chaplin.

Elliott&#x27;s last stage appearance was in 1920 in &quot;Trimmed in Scarlett&quot;, aged 52. She then retired from acting, announcing that she &quot;wished to grow middle-aged gracefully&quot;. According to biographer Diana Forbes-Robertson, contemporary critics were divided on whether it was &quot;her beauty or her acting ability that attracted attention&quot; over her career.

==Businesswoman==
Elliott was successful in both business and investment. She had homes in America, England, and in France. A photograph of Winston Churchill (accompanied by his wife, Clementine) working on an oil painting in the grounds of one of her houses, Hartsbourne Manor in England, appears in Andrew Roberts&#x27; &quot;Churchill: Walking with Destiny&quot;.

Elliott&#x27;s sister Gertrude Elliot with her husband Johnston Forbes-Robertson and their children Maxine &quot;Blossom&quot; Miles, Jean, Chloe and Diana lived in a wing of Hartsbourne Manor. In 1932, she built le Château de l&#x27;Horizon near Juan-les-Pins. There she entertained guests that included Churchill, Lloyd George and Vincent Sheean. In her old age, the diarist &quot;Chips&quot; Channon described her as &quot;an immense bulk of a woman with dark eyes, probably the most amazing eyes one has ever seen&quot;, &quot;lovable, fat, oh so fat, witty and gracious&quot;; he recorded having watched her eat &quot;pat after pat of butter without any bread&quot;. Elliott died on March 5, 1940, in Cannes, France, a wealthy woman, at the age of 72.

== Death and legacy ==
Elliott was interred at Protestant Cemetery in Cannes and became the subject of a biography titled &quot;My Aunt Maxine: The Story of Maxine Elliot&quot; c.1964, written by her niece, Diana Forbes-Robertson. Her other descendants include British actor Leo Woodall.

<text>Alexander John Ellis (14 June 1814 – 28 October 1890) was an English mathematician, philologist and early phonetician who also influenced the field of musicology. He changed his name from his father&#x27;s name, Sharpe, to his mother&#x27;s maiden name, Ellis, in 1825 as a condition of receiving significant financial support from a relative on his mother&#x27;s side. He is buried in Kensal Green Cemetery, London.

== Biography ==
He was born Alexander John Sharpe in Hoxton, Middlesex, to a wealthy family. His father, James Birch Sharpe, was a notable artist and physician who was later appointed Esquire of Windlesham. His mother, Ann Ellis, was from a noble background, but it is not known how her family made its fortune. Alexander&#x27;s brother James Birch Sharpe junior died at the Battle of Inkerman during the Crimean War. His other brother, William Henry Sharpe, served with the Lancashire Fusiliers after moving north with his family to Cumberland, due to military work.

Alexander was educated at Shrewsbury School, Eton College and Trinity College, Cambridge (BA 1837). Initially trained in mathematics and the classics, he became a well-known phonetician of his time and wrote the article on phonetics for the &quot;Encyclopaedia Britannica&quot; in 1887. Through his work in phonetics, he also became interested in vocal pitch and, by extension, in musical pitch, as well as speech and song.

Ellis is noted for translating and extensively annotating Hermann von Helmholtz&#x27;s &quot;On the Sensations of Tone&quot;. The second edition of this translation, published in 1885, contains an appendix which summarises Ellis&#x27;s own work on related matters.

In his writings on musical pitch and scales, Ellis elaborates his notion and notation of cents for musical intervals. This concept became especially influential in comparative musicology, a predecessor of ethnomusicology. Analyzing the scales (tone systems) of various European musical traditions, Ellis also showed that the diversity of tone systems cannot be explained by a single physical law, as had been argued by earlier scholars.

In part V of his series &quot;On Early English Pronunciation&quot;, he distinguished forty-two different dialects in England and the Scottish Lowlands. This was one of the first works to apply phonetics to English speech and has been cited continuously by linguists since publication.

He was acknowledged by George Bernard Shaw as the prototype of Professor Henry Higgins of &quot;Pygmalion&quot; (adapted as the musical &quot;My Fair Lady&quot;). He was elected in June 1864 as a Fellow of the Royal Society.

Ellis&#x27;s son Tristram James Ellis trained as an engineer, but later became a noted painter of the Middle East.

==Phonetic alphabets==

Ellis developed two phonetic alphabets, the English Phonotypic Alphabet (together with Isaac Pitman), which used many new letters, and the Palaeotype alphabet, which replaced many of these with turned letters (such as ⟨ə⟩, ⟨ɔ⟩), small caps (such as ⟨ɪ⟩), and italics. These letters, as well as two of his own creation, ⟨ʃ⟩ and ⟨ʒ⟩, were passed on to Henry Sweet&#x27;s Romic alphabet and from there to the International Phonetic Alphabet.

<doc id="779275" wikidata="Q5325899" url="?curid=779275" title="Earl Hancock Ellis">
<text>Lieutenant Colonel Earl Hancock &quot;Pete&quot; Ellis (December 19, 1880 – May 12, 1923) was a United States Marine Corps Intelligence Officer, and author of &quot;Operations Plan 712: Advanced Base Operations in Micronesia&quot;, which became the basis for the American campaign of amphibious assault that defeated the Japanese in World War II.

During World War I, Ellis established his reputation as a superior administrator and trainer when he played a large role in the creation of Marine Corps Base Quantico and operation of the Marine Corps&#x27; first Officer Candidate School. He also earned accolades for his work as an organizer when he served as one of the lead staff officers responsible for planning the St. Mihiel and Meuse-Argonne Offensives.

Ellis was an alcoholic, and frequently alternated between bouts of excessive drinking and hospitalization to receive treatment for the illnesses and complications it caused. In 1922 and 1923, he carried out a covert spying mission to obtain information on Japanese activities on the islands of the Pacific Ocean. He died on Palau in 1923 under circumstances that were somewhat mysterious, but were probably the result of over consumption of alcohol. His remains were cremated and eventually interred at Arlington National Cemetery in 2004.

Ellis&#x27; prophetic study of Japan and the Pacific established him at the forefront of naval theorists and strategists in the field of amphibious warfare, because he foresaw both the initial Japanese attack, and the subsequent island-hopping campaigns in the Central Pacific. He is still regarded as one of the Marine Corps&#x27; primary theorists because his advocacy of amphibious operations provided the organization an enduring mission and structure as the need for what had been its primary role—security detachments aboard Navy ships and at naval bases—became less critical.

==Early life==
Ellis was born on December 19, 1880, in Iuka, Kansas, a small farming community. His parents, Augustus and Catherine Axline Ellis, migrated from southeast Iowa to Kansas following passage of the Homestead and Preemption Acts. He was the second oldest of six surviving children. He graduated first in his high school class at Pratt, Kansas, was interested in baseball and was an avid reader, especially enjoying Rudyard Kipling&#x27;s stories and poems. His inspiration to enlist came from reading magazine and newspaper articles as a teenager; during the Spanish–American War he read about the 1st Marine Battalion (Reinforced), known as &quot;Huntington&#x27;s Battalion&quot;, during its action at Cusco Well, as well as the Marine landing parties serving with Admiral George Dewey in the Philippines.

==Start of career==
Ellis began his Marine Corps career by enlisting as a private in Chicago, Illinois, on September 3, 1900. He arrived at the Washington Navy Yard days later to begin his initial entry training, which included instruction from experienced noncommissioned officers, some of whom were veterans of the American Civil War era. In February 1901 he was promoted to corporal.

Ellis&#x27; parents subsequently made inquiries with Congressman Chester I. Long from nearby Medicine Lodge about the possibility of Ellis obtaining a commission. Long followed up with Marine Corps Commandant Charles Heywood and was informed that the Marines enabled a select number of noncommissioned officers to sit for competitive examinations. As a corporal, Ellis qualified; he was tutored by an Army colonel, performed well on the written examination, and received his commission as a second lieutenant on December 21, 1901.

On January 11, 1902, he reported to Colonel Percival C. Pope, commanding officer of the Marine Barracks at the Charlestown Navy Yard in Boston, to receive his initial training, including how to perform inspections and other tasks required of junior officers. On March 1, 1902, he was directed to report to Marine Barracks, Washington, D.C. to receive orders for an assignment in the western Pacific. He departed for San Francisco on April 1, 1902, where he boarded the steamboat &quot;Sheridan&quot;. On April 13 he arrived in Manila, Philippines, and reported for duty at the naval base along the Cavite Peninsula, where he was assigned as adjutant of the 1st Marine Regiment (also referred to as &quot;1st Marines&quot;). During this period, the boredom and monotony of routine occupation duty began to have a negative effect on him.

I think that this is the laziest life that a man could find—there is not a blamed thing to do except lay around, sleep and go &#x27;bug house&#x27;. But the same, I am helping to bear the &#x27;White Man&#x27;s Burden&#x27;.

Ellis had maintained a good relationship with the commander of the 1st Marine Regiment (&quot;1st Marines&quot;), and in January 1903 he was assigned to command the Marine Detachment on board the battleship &quot;Kentucky&quot;, the fleet flagship of the United States Navy. The ship&#x27;s crew conducted exercises in Manila Bay and entertained the British Fleet stationed in the Far East. By late February, Ellis sojourned to Singapore, China, and then to Yokohama, until the United States Secretary of the Navy ordered the &quot;Kentucky&quot; home to New York City. In March he was promoted to first lieutenant.

On May 25, 1904, Ellis was directed to report to the commandant on June 12, 1904. In June received assignment to the staff at the Marine Barracks in Washington, D.C. In September he was transferred to Mare Island, California, where he served as quartermaster until December 31, 1905.

In 1906 and 1907 Ellis was on temporary duty as a recruiting officer; he served in Oakland, California, during the summer of 1906, and Des Moines, Iowa from July 31, 1906, to April 19, 1907. He then returned to Mare Island, where he served until November 18, 1907, when he was ordered to Olongapo, Philippines, as the adjutant of the 2nd Marine Regiment (&quot;2nd Marines&quot;), which was commanded by Lieutenant Colonel Hiram I. Bearss (&quot;Hiking Hiram&quot;).

==Continued career==
On February 14, 1908, Ellis was assigned as executive officer of the 2nd Regiment&#x27;s Company E. In May 1908 he was promoted to captain. When Major John A. Lejeune arrived in Olongapo to assume command of the brigade which included the 2nd Regiment, he selected Ellis to command the 2nd Regiment&#x27;s Company F, and he served from July 1 to September 30, 1908. He performed special duty assignments involving disputes about land claims among the local Filipinos until resuming command of Company F from January 1 through May 31, 1909. He then commanded Company E and directed fortification and management of the local post exchange located on Grande Island. During this period, he supposedly shot the glasses off a table to lighten the mood of a &#x27;boring&#x27; dinner while visiting a Navy chaplain. He returned to Olongapo in the spring of 1910 and resumed duties as the 2nd Regiment&#x27;s adjutant, serving until returning to the United States in January 1911.

Ellis reported to the Barracks at the Washington Navy Yard on March 22, 1911. William P. Biddle was the commandant; Ellis requested aviation duty, but Biddle suggested that he attend the Naval War College. Ellis acquiesced; after graduating, he remained as a lecturer and seminar leader from October 29, 1912, to October 16, 1913. In 1913, Ellis co-authored the &quot;Report of Naval War College Committee on Defense of Guam,&quot; with Commander F. N. Schofield.

Ellis then reported to the Philadelphia Navy Yard, where he was assigned as military intelligence officer on the staff of George Barnett. Ellis played a significant role in planning the exercises that took place in Culebra of Puerto Rico.

The Advance Base Outfit appears to be in efficient condition and it is believed that if called upon for use it would be found thoroughly satisfactory. This condition is mainly due to the excellent work of Captain Earl H. Ellis.

On February 9, 1914, Ellis and the Advance Base Force embarked to New Orleans for a possible deployment to Mexico because of tensions in the area. Barnett was slated to succeed Biddle as commandant, and selected Ellis for special assignment as a member of a Joint Army-Navy Board committee that studied the defenses of Guam and made recommendations for improvements at the outbreak of World War I. Upon arrival on Guam, Ellis was assigned as the committee&#x27;s secretary and aide-de-camp, and assumed the duties of chief of police, registrar of the civil government, and Intelligence officer. While on Guam, Ellis conducted a simulated attack with a small group of men across the reef at Orote Point, which demonstrated the ability of men in boats to carry out an amphibious attack and capture artillery. Ellis&#x27;s health began to deteriorate during this assignment, and his medical records attributed his illnesses to alcohol abuse.

On August 27, 1915, Ellis returned to Washington, D.C. for duty as one of the three aides-de-camp to George Barnett, and in 1916, Ellis was promoted to major. This action coincided with the beginning of US intervention on the side of the Allies in World War I, and Barnett persuaded Secretary of the Navy Josephus Daniels to allow participation of the 5th Marines in the American Expeditionary Forces (AEF).

==World War I==
Ellis requested front line duty in France, but in May 1917 he was assigned to assist in the establishment of a new installation, Marine Corps Base Quantico. He later served as an instructor for the course which became the Marine Corps&#x27; Officer Candidate School. In late 1917, Barnett dispatched Ellis to France to observe the formation and training of the AEF, and report back. Ellis embarked on the &quot;Von Steuben&quot; on October 25, 1917, and returned to the US in early 1918.

The War Department directed the 6th Marines to France to join with the 5th Marines and form the 4th Marine Brigade, 2nd Division. When Lejeune received orders to go to France and command a brigade, he asked for Ellis to serve on his staff. Lejeune was assigned to the 64th Brigade, 32nd Division, and Ellis was assigned as adjutant. When Lejeune assumed command of the 4th Marine Brigade on July 25, 1918, Ellis again became Lejeune&#x27;s adjutant. During this time Ellis also served as the 2nd Division&#x27;s inspector.

Ellis played major roles in the planning of the St. Mihiel (Champagne) (12–16 September 1918) and Meuse-Argonne (Champagne) Offensives (September 29 to October 10, 1918) including the attack on and capture of Blanc Mont Ridge, and in the Meuse-Argonne Offensivemfrom October 31 to November 11, 1918. After Lejeune succeeded to command of the 2nd Division, Ellis&#x27;s reputation as a strategist and planner led his new brigade commander, Brigadier General Wendell Cushing Neville, to recommended Ellis for an accelerated promotion to colonel. Ellis did not receive the promotion, but was awarded both the Navy Distinguished Service Medal and Navy Cross, which he received on November 11, 1920. In addition, France awarded him the Croix de guerre and Légion d&#x27;honneur (Grade of Chevalier).

His Navy Cross was awarded for his planning of the attack and capture of Blanc Mont Ridge and his unit&#x27;s role in the Meuse-Argonne Offensive. His citation read:

For exceptionally meritorious and distinguished service. As Adjutant, Fourth Brigade Marines, he displayed utter disregard of personal hardship and danger, energetic application and an unfailing devotion to the duties of his office. He has ever shown himself ready for any emergency, even when he has been without sleep or rest for several days and nights at a time. His keen analytical mind, quick grasp of intricate problems, resourcefulness, decision and readiness to take prompt action on important questions arising during the temporary absence of the Brigade Commander within the Brigade, have contributed largely to the success of the Brigade, rendered his services invaluable and won for him the high esteem and complete confidence of the Brigade Commander.

Ellis was a recipient of the Silver Star for heroism while serving with the 4th Brigade:

By direction of the President, under the provisions of the act of Congress approved July 9, 1918 (Bul. No. 43, W.D., 1918), Lieutenant Colonel Earl Hancock Ellis (MCSN: 0-260), United States Marine Corps, is cited by the Commanding General, SECOND Division, American Expeditionary Forces, for gallantry in action and a silver star may be placed upon the ribbon of the Victory Medals awarded him. Lieutenant Colonel Ellis distinguished himself while serving with Headquarters, 4th Brigade, 2d Division, American Expeditionary Forces in France during World War I.
Ellis&#x27;s French Croix de guerre with Gold Star citation read:

From the 2nd to the 10th of October, 1918, near Blanc Mont, Lieutenant Colonel Ellis has shown a high sense of duty. Thanks to his intelligence, his courage and high energy, the operations that this Brigade (Fourth Brigade, Second Division) took part in, have always been successful.

==Post-World War I==
The war ended on November 11, 1918. On November 17, the 2nd Division marched north to begin occupation duty. For the remainder of the occupation, the 4th Marine Brigade was employed along the Rhine. When the 5th Regiment&#x27;s commander, Logan Feland was promoted to brigadier general, Colonel Harold Snyder assumed command of the regiment, and Ellis was appointed as regimental executive officer. On July 1, 1919, he was promoted to lieutenant colonel. In August 1919, the 4th Marine Brigade returned to the United States. On August 3, 1919, Barnett instructed Ellis to report to Galveston, Texas, for an intelligence-gathering mission on behalf of the Office of Naval Intelligence, which was concerned that Germany might attempt to seize Mexico&#x27;s oil fields.

On November 25, 1919, Ellis reported for staff duty at Headquarters Marine Corps. On New Year&#x27;s Day, he was admitted to the hospital, and diagnosed with depression, &quot;delirium tremens&quot;, and neurasthenia, all symptoms of acute alcohol abuse. He later traveled to Ray, Arizona, where he remained on convalescent leave for three weeks. When he was discharged from care he departed for an intelligence-gathering mission in the Dominican Republic. He embarked on a troop transport ship &quot;Kittery&quot; from Charleston, South Carolina on April 20, 1919, and reported to Brigadier General Logan Feland on May 10. While in the Dominican Republic, Ellis aided in the formation of the Guardia Nacional in Santo Domingo, which the Marines had been attempting since their occupation in 1916. Feland lauded Ellis&#x27;s performance:

The effect of his [Ellis&#x27;s] thorough knowledge of intelligence duties and of his hard work in training his subordinates became apparent almost at once. The intelligence reports, which had been a mass of unrelated and generally unimportant scraps of information, became well-compiled and well-digested reports of the condition in Santo Domingo.

Ellis served with the 2nd Brigade in Santo Domingo from April to December, 1920. On December 11, 1920, Ellis reported to Commandant John A. Lejeune, who assigned Ellis to head the Marine Corps Intelligence section of the newly established Division of Operations and Training (DOT) at Headquarters Marine Corps (HQMC). During this assignment, he prepared an essay regarding the details of military and civil operations required to eradicate subversion and insurgency, titled &quot;Bush Brigades&quot;&#x27;. This essay was considered controversial because Marines had been recently accused of killing local citizens in the Philippines and Haiti. As a result, &quot;Bush Brigades&quot; was never officially published, though it was printed and circulated among Marines and other members of the US military. For example, while serving as Director of the Marine Corps Intelligence section, Ellis sent an excerpt of the essay titled &quot;Intelligence Service in Bush Brigades and Baby Nations&quot; to Marine Corps Intelligence units worldwide.

In late 1920, Lejeune and his senior staff focused on review and revision of war plans that were prepared for use in the event of hostilities with Imperial Japan; this work included revising War Plan Orange. As part of this effort, Ellis produced the prophetic document, &quot;Operation Plan 712 – Advanced Base Operations in Micronesia&quot;, which underscored that in the event of hostilities with Japan, the US would require advanced bases to support its fleet. The Territory of Hawaii constituted the &#x27;only&#x27; support for the United States Navy due to the lack of naval facilities in the US possessions of the Philippines and Guam.

Japan had already occupied the Marshall, Caroline, and Palau Islands, which flanked the U.S. lines of communications in the region by more than 2,300 miles. Ellis&#x27;s Operation Plan 712 predicted that Japan would initiate a war, and that Japan would stay near their own territorial waters until encountered by the U.S. fleet. He also added that great losses would occur in what he termed the &quot;ship-shore belt&quot; because of confusion during amphibious assaults. Ellis advised war planners to minimize confusion and casualties by organizing task forces prior to leaving base ports, and to maintain unit integrity rather than dividing Marines up among several transports.

... a major fleet action would decide the war in the Pacific; the U.S. fleet would be 25 percent superior to that of the enemy; the enemy would hold his main fleet within his defense line; fleet units must be husbanded; preliminary activities of the U.S fleet must be accomplished with a minimum of assets; Marine Corps forces must be self-sustaining; long, drawn-out operations must be avoided to afford the greatest protection to the fleet; sea objectives must include a fleet anchorage.

==Undercover mission in the Central Pacific==
Ellis believed that US acquiescence to Japan&#x27;s South Seas Mandate, which allowed Japan to occupy islands that had previously been controlled by Germany, would enable Japan to operate behind a defensive screen to expand its territory and influence without being observed. Convinced that this course would eventually lead to war between Japan and the United States, Ellis determined to carry out intelligence gathering activities to obtain details on Japan&#x27;s activities.

On April 9, 1921, Ellis submitted a pro forma request to the commandant to conduct a clandestine reconnaissance mission to the Central Pacific to examine the Marshall and Caroline Islands. His request indicated that he expected to travel as a civilian and to provide an undated resignation that would enable the Marine Corps to deny knowledge of his actions if necessary. (In fact, the Marine Corps did not use the letter of resignation, and retained Ellis on its roll of active officers until he died. At the time of his death, Ellis was listed in payroll and personnel records as being on &quot;extended leave,&quot; a status the commandant had directed his staff to use.) Shortly after he submitted his request he suffered another occurrence of neurasthenia; after recovering he asked to resume the intelligence mission in the Pacific. On May 4, 1921, Assistant Secretary of the Navy Theodore Roosevelt Jr. approved the request as the acting Secretary of the Navy. Ellis left the hospital the same day, and reported to Headquarters Marine Corps to finish making arrangements.

To hide his identity as a military officer gathering intelligence abroad, Ellis turned to John A. Hughes, who was commissioned from the ranks with him in 1902. Hughes had been medically retired in 1920, after which he joined his father&#x27;s import-export business, the Hughes Trading Company. Hughes provided Ellis with a cover identity as a traveling representative of the company. After a brief visit home to Kansas, Ellis traveled to San Francisco on May 28, 1921. He subsequently traveled to New Zealand and Australia via the American President Lines SS &quot;Maheno&quot;, and arrived on September 28.

Ellis was soon hospitalized in Manila due to acute nephritis, an inflammation of the kidneys. After his discharge, he departed for Yokohama, Japan aboard SS &quot;President Jackson&quot; so he could arrange for a visa and travel authorization that would permit him to visit the mandated Caroline and the Marshall Islands. Ellis continued drinking heavily, which apparently caused him to disclose his mission to civilians, including the physicians who treated him when he was hospitalized again for neurasthenia on September 1, 1922. The local naval attaché issued Ellis orders to return home on the next available ship; Ellis ignored them, cabled Marine Corps Headquarters for a draft of one thousand dollars he could receive at a local bank, and departed for Saipan.

Upon arrival aboard NBK Lines &quot;Kasuga Maru&quot;, he debarked at the Tanapag Harbor, and checked into a hotel in Garapan with the intention of scouting the Mariana Islands, which Japan was using as a central hub for their activities in Micronesia. The Office of Naval Intelligence was able to track his whereabouts by his withdrawals from the special bank account they established to fund his covert activities.

As Ellis continued his intelligence gathering mission and heavy drinking, he attracted the attention of the Japanese authorities, who began to keep track of his movements and activities. A friend, Kilili Sablan, suggested that Ellis check out of the hotel and live with the Sablan family. Ellis traveled around Saipan for several weeks, and produced detailed maps and charts. On December 3, 1922, he boarded the ship &quot;Matsuyama Maru&quot; to travel to the Carolines, Marshalls, Yap, and the Palaus. Upon arrival, he checked into a hotel in Koror, and again boarded the &quot;Matsuyama Maru&quot;, intending to travel to Truk; Ellis was unable to survey this island because Japanese authorities denied him passage, which was an indication that they remained suspicious of him.

During a trip from Kusaie, Ellis became ill aboard the &quot;Matsuyama Maru&quot; and was hospitalized in Jaluit by missionary Jesse &quot;Mother&quot; Hoppin who assigned her student Benjamin Lajipun to be Ellis&#x27; houseboy. After his recovery in January 1923, he continued to survey the Marshalls, Kwajalein, Ponape, Celebes, and New Guinea aboard the copra-collecting sailboat &quot;Caroline Maru&quot;. Ellis slept on deck and took copious notes charting the reefs and inventorying local facilities, populations, and products.

Japanese officials assigned Dr. Uichi Ishoda to watch Ellis on these voyages, and during a storm which nearly capsized &quot;Caroline Maru&quot; Ellis demonstrated a knowledge of seamanship which caused Ishoda to conclude Ellis was a naval officer. While staying on Koror, he met a teenage Palauan woman named Metauie, who became his wife. His friends attempted to keep him from drinking, but by then, he had a coterie of native boys who would obtain his alcohol for him. He continued to drink excessively, and his health continued to deteriorate. On May 12, 1923, he was unable to obtain any alcoholic beverages as the result of his friends attempting to keep him sober, and he unsuccessfully looted the home of his friend William Gibbons in search of drink. Aware of Ellis&#x27;s condition, the Japanese police had two bottles of whiskey delivered to him; he consumed them both, and died later the same day from the effects of excessive alcohol intake.

==Ellis&#x27; death==
In contemporary newspaper accounts and in later years, numerous conspiracy theorists alleged that Ellis was assassinated by Japanese military authorities, who may have poisoned the whiskey they sent him on his last day alive; however, detractors of such theories note that Ellis was known to have a severe drinking problem and likely died from an alcohol-related illness such as cirrhosis of the liver.

Ellis&#x27; official medical records indicate that not long before his death, he was admitted to a naval hospital for treatment of &quot;delirium tremens&quot; and hallucinations. Ellis researcher and author Dirk Anthony Ballendorf noted that tremors and hallucinations like the ones Ellis experienced are often attributable to depression and alcoholism:

That the Japanese would have placed poison in his whiskey is unlikely since, for Ellis whiskey itself was poison enough.

Question also arose because the agent sent to investigate the circumstances of Ellis&#x27; death, who was the only one known to have seen Ellis&#x27;s body and its condition before it was cremated, died before he could provide a report of his findings. Chief Pharmacist Lawrence Zembsch—who had treated Ellis during his hospitalization—traveled on a Japanese steamer to Palau, where he stayed at the Japanese officer&#x27;s barracks. After talking to Japanese authorities who had dealings with Ellis (including the medical officer), Zembsch witnessed and photographed the exhumation of Ellis&#x27;s body and its cremation, taking custody of the remains when this was completed. Zembsch became ill and suffered a nervous breakdown on the return voyage, and was admitted to a hospital in Yokohama, which was soon after buried by falling rubble in the 1923 Great Kantō earthquake. The urn containing Ellis&#x27;s remains was found in the rubble, and returned to the United States. In November, 2004, the remains were disinterred from Greenlawn Cemetery in Pratt and reburied with full military honors at Arlington National Cemetery, Section 54 Site 3082.

Ellis&#x27; maps and papers were confiscated by Japanese authorities. An inquiry undertaken at the behest of General Douglas MacArthur after World War II found no trace of any of Ellis&#x27; effects, nor a report on Ellis&#x27; activities by the Japanese governor of the island. It is not clear how competently Ellis performed his map-making and analysis, given his demonstrated instability in the final months of his life and the fact that the Japanese had not yet begun fortifying Palau. Had Ellis survived, he would likely have completed addenda to &quot;Advanced Base Operations in Micronesia&quot; that would have provided military authorities with information on the potential military uses of the islands.

==Legacy==
Though he had a native wife in Papua, Ellis was not married before traveling in the Pacific islands, and he had no children.

Ellis had a Marine Corps-wide reputation for excellence in organizational, administrative, intelligence analysis, and strategic planning, as evidenced by the fact that successive Commandants, including Biddle, Barnett, and Lejeune, relied on Ellis for their most important activities, including covert information gathering, despite being aware that he consumed alcohol so excessively that he often required a doctor&#x27;s care and extensive hospitalization before he could return to duty.

Despite the loss of the maps and notes from his final intelligence gathering effort, Ellis&#x27; overall strategic view of the Pacific Ocean islands remained valid, especially in light of events at the start of US involvement in World War II. In &quot;Operations Plan 712: Advanced Base Operations in Micronesia&quot;, drew particular attention to the strategic value of the Marshall and Caroline islands, noting that they &quot;form a ‘cloud’ of islands stretching east and west.” This cloud concept contrasts with later emphasis on the north to south &quot;Second Island Chain,&quot; running from Japan through the Nanpo Shoto and Mariana Islands to Indonesia.

In addition to predicting the circumstances of World War II in the Pacific, Ellis is regarded as a significant strategic theorist in the history of the Marine Corps because his advocacy of amphibious warfare aided the Marines to identify and organize for an enduring mission, which replaced what had previously been their primary function—small security detachments on ships and at naval bases.

Ellis is listed on the Roll of Honor of the Marine Corps Intelligence Association, which lists Marines from the Intelligence field who were killed in the line of duty.

Ellis Hall, one of the main educational buildings at the Marine Corps&#x27; Quantico base, is named for Ellis.

<doc id="779277" wikidata="Q458270" url="?curid=779277" title="Copperhead (climbing)">
<text>In rock climbing, a copperhead is a small nut with a head made of soft metal on a loop of wire, originally copper or brass, later aluminium. Copperheads are most often placed into small shallow seams and crevices by pounding or hammering them in to place, with a climbing hammer, sometimes with the aid of metal rod, chisel, or punch. The malleability of the soft metal head makes copperheads conform to the rock and grip better than other devices, and are often the only protection that will stay fixed in many placements. Their small size and low strength makes them among the poorest kinds of protection; their main use is in aid climbing where a placement that will just support the weight of the climber can be used to make progress, even though it would be useless in a fall. Variations such as Double-heads and Circleheads can also be used.

<text>Ici RDI is a Canadian French-language specialty news channel owned by the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (known in French as Société Radio-Canada). The channel began broadcasting on January 1, 1995, as Réseau de l&#x27;information (, &quot;Information Network&quot;). It is the French-language equivalent of CBC News Network.

==Overview==
ICI RDI is distributed on basic cable and satellite television to 9.8 million homes, including two million in Quebec, and is seen by half a million English viewers each week. The channel has mandatory carriage status for viewers outside Quebec.

ICI RDI relies on the news-gathering resources of the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation:
* 400 journalists
* Ten newsrooms based in &quot;Maison Radio-Canada&quot; in Montreal
* 30 bureaus across Canada, and seven foreign bureaus

ICI RDI provides news, business, weather, and sports information on Air Canada&#x27;s inflight entertainment and is seen in five major Canadian airports as &quot;RDI express&quot;.
Ici RDI is likewise responsible for continuous news updates on all public screens in the Montreal Subway System.

==Revenue==

According to the Canadian Communication&#x27;s Monitoring Report - Broadcasting System 2014, there are 11.1 million subscribers to the channel and a revenue of $54.6 million.
==Programming==

ICI RDI broadcasts full newscasts at the top of each hour and headlines every half hour from the newsroom of Maison Radio-Canada in Montreal and Quebec City. &quot;Le Téléjournal Midi&quot; is broadcast each weekday at noon and the main evening news bulletin &quot;Le Téléjournal/Le Point&quot; every evening live at 9:00 p.m. (eastern). These bulletins are also on the main French-language television network, Ici Radio-Canada Télé. The channel covers major events live from around the world, relying on a staff interpreter for simultaneous translation from English to French whenever necessary. It also rebroadcasts the main supper-hour bulletins from CBVT-DT Quebec City, CBAFT-DT Moncton and CKTV-DT Saguenay.

The channel also broadcasts factual programs in the form of food program &quot;L&#x27;épicerie&quot;, current affairs in &quot;Les Grand Reportages&quot; (The Big Reports), science in Découverte (Discovery), and &quot;Tout le Monde en Parlait&quot; - a look back at past culture seen through the eyes of current events. During the weekend there is a greater amount of these programs, much in the same format as its English-language counterpart, the CBC News Network.

===Slogans===

<text>Edmund Gwenn (born Edmund John Kellaway; 26 September 1877 – 6 September 1959) was an English actor. On film, he is best remembered for his role as Kris Kringle in the Christmas film &quot;Miracle on 34th Street&quot; (1947), for which he won the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor and the corresponding Golden Globe Award. He received a second Golden Globe and another Academy Award nomination for the comedy film &quot;Mister 880&quot; (1950). He is also remembered for his appearances in four films directed by Alfred Hitchcock.

As a stage actor in the West End and on Broadway, he was associated with a wide range of works by modern playwrights, including Bernard Shaw, John Galsworthy and J. B. Priestley. After the Second World War, he lived in the United States, where he had a successful career in Hollywood and Broadway.

==Life and career==

===Early years===
Gwenn was born in Wandsworth, London to John and Catherine ( Oliver) Kellaway. His brother was the actor Arthur Chesney, and his cousin was the actor Cecil Kellaway. Gwenn was educated at St. Olave&#x27;s School and later at King&#x27;s College London. He began his acting career in the theatre in 1895, and learned his craft as a member of Willie Edouin&#x27;s company, playing brash comic roles. In 1901 he married Minnie Terry, niece of Dame Ellen Terry. In the same year, he went to Australia and acted there for three years with the J. C. Williamson company. His wife accompanied him, and when Gwenn was in a production of &quot;Ben Hur&quot; that was a disastrous failure, she restored the couple&#x27;s fortunes by accepting an engagement from Williamson. Later, the couple appeared on stage together in London in a farce called &quot;What the Butler Saw&quot; in 1905 and, in 1911, when Irene Vanbrugh made her debut in variety, she chose Terry and Gwenn to join her in a short play specially written by J. M. Barrie.

When he returned to London, Gwenn appeared not in low comedy but in what &quot;The Times&quot; called &quot;a notably intellectual and even sophisticated setting&quot; at the Court Theatre under the management of J. E. Vedrenne and Harley Granville-Barker. There, in 1905 to 1907, in the words of &quot;The Times&quot;, &quot;he was invaluable in smaller parts [giving] every part he played its full worth&quot;, including Straker, the proletarian chauffeur to John Tanner in Bernard Shaw&#x27;s &quot;Man and Superman&quot;, and Drinkwater, the cockney gangster in &quot;Captain Brassbound&#x27;s Conversion&quot;. He also appeared in plays by Granville-Barker and John Galsworthy, in Elizabeth Robins&#x27;s suffragette drama &quot;Votes for Women&quot; and in works by other contemporaries. In Barrie&#x27;s &quot;What Every Woman Knows&quot; (1908) in the role of the over-enthusiastic James Wylie he impressed the producer Charles Frohman, who engaged him for his repertory company at the Duke of York&#x27;s Theatre. In 1912, Gwenn went into management in partnership with Hilda Trevelyan. His career was interrupted by his military service during the First World War, serving as an officer in the British Army. During the war, Gwenn&#x27;s marriage broke up and was dissolved. His ex-wife remarried but remained on affectionate terms with him.

===Leading roles on stage and screen===
After peace returned, Gwenn&#x27;s leading roles in the West End during the 1920s included Old Bill in Bruce Bairnsfather&#x27;s &quot;Old Bill, M.P.&quot; (1922); Christian Veit in &quot;Lilac Time&quot; (1922–23); the title role in A. A. Milne&#x27;s &quot;The Great Broxoff&quot; (1923); Leo Swinburne in &quot;Good Luck&quot; by Seymour Hicks and Ian Hay (1923); and Hippolyte Gallipot in Lehár&#x27;s &quot;Frasquita&quot; (1925). Looking back at Gwenn&#x27;s career, &quot;The Times&quot; considered, &quot;Out of scores of other parts which he played in England and in America, the best remembered are probably Hornblower in Galsworthy&#x27;s &quot;The Skin Game&quot;, the Viennese paterfamilias in &quot;Lilac Time&quot; and Samuel Pepys in Fagan&#x27;s &quot;And So to Bed&quot; in 1926.&quot;

Gwenn began his film career in 1916, playing Macbeth in &quot;The Real Thing at Last&quot;, a satire of the American film industry written by &quot;Peter Pan&quot; playwright J. M. Barrie. A notable early role was a recreation of his stage character Hornblower in the 1921 Anglo-Dutch silent film of &quot;The Skin Game&quot;, which he reprised ten years later in Alfred Hitchcock&#x27;s early sound version of &quot;The Skin Game&quot;. His debut in a talking picture was in an adaptation of Shaw&#x27;s &quot;How He Lied to Her Husband&quot;, made at Elstree in 1931. Of Gwenn&#x27;s many British film roles, &quot;The Times&quot; considered his best known to be Jess Oakroyd in &quot;The Good Companions&quot; with John Gielgud and Jessie Matthews (1933) and Radfern in Carol Reed&#x27;s &quot;Laburnum Grove&quot; with Cedric Hardwicke (1936). His final British film role, as a capitalist trying to take over a family brewery in &quot;Cheer Boys Cheer&quot; (1939) is credited with being the first authentic Ealing comedy.

Gwenn appeared in more than eighty films, including &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot; (1940), &quot;Cheers for Miss Bishop&quot;, &quot;Of Human Bondage&quot; and &quot;The Keys of the Kingdom&quot;. George Cukor&#x27;s &quot;Sylvia Scarlett&quot; (1935) was his first appearance in a Hollywood film, as Katharine Hepburn&#x27;s father. He settled in Hollywood in 1940 and became part of its British colony. He had a small role as a Cockney assassin in a Hitchcock film, &quot;Foreign Correspondent&quot; in 1940. For his Santa Claus role in &quot;Miracle on 34th Street&quot; he won an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor. He received a second Oscar nomination for his role in &quot;Mister 880&quot; (1950). Near the end of his career, he played one of the main roles in &quot;Them!&quot; (1954) and in Hitchcock&#x27;s &quot;The Trouble with Harry&quot; (1955). His last film role was in the Spanish satire &quot;The Rocket from Calabuch&quot; (1956), directed by Luis García Berlanga.

On Broadway Gwenn starred in the acclaimed 1942 production of Chekhov&#x27;s &quot;Three Sisters&quot;, starring Katharine Cornell (who was also the producer), Judith Anderson, and Ruth Gordon. &quot;Time&quot; proclaimed it, &quot;a dream production by anybody&#x27;s reckoning – the most glittering cast the theatre has seen, commercially, in this generation.&quot;

==Later years==
Gwenn remained a British subject all his life. When he first moved to Hollywood, he lived at the Beverly Wilshire Hotel in Beverly Hills. His home in London had been reduced to rubble during the bombings by the German Luftwaffe in the Second World War. Only the fireplace survived. What Gwenn regretted most was the loss of the memorabilia he had collected of the actor Henry Irving. Eventually, Gwenn bought a house at 617 North Bedford Drive in Beverly Hills, which he later shared with the former Olympic athlete Rodney Soher. At the age of 78 he travelled from his home in California for a reunion with his ex-wife in London. He told a reporter, &quot;I never married again because I was very happy with my wife. I simply stayed faithful to the memory of that happiness.&quot;

==Death==
Gwenn died from pneumonia after suffering a stroke, in Woodland Hills, California, twenty days before his 82nd birthday. He was cremated, and his ashes were placed in the private vaults at the Chapel of the Pines Crematory in Los Angeles. Gwenn has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 1751 Vine Street for his contribution to motion pictures.

On March 5, 2023, Gwenn&#x27;s misplaced urn was located in Vault 5 of Chapel of the Pines Crematory by researcher Jessica Wahl and Hollywood Graveyard YouTube channel creator Arthur Dark. After a GoFundMe campaign organized by Wahl and Dark and with the permission of Gwenn&#x27;s surviving family, Gwenn&#x27;s urn was relocated to a publicly accessible niche in the Cathedral Mausoleum of Hollywood Forever Cemetery on December 3, 2023.

<text>Amos Ellmaker (February 2, 1787 – November 28, 1851) was a U.S. politician, attorney, and judge from Pennsylvania. He served as the Pennsylvania Attorney General and was the Anti-Masonic vice presidential candidate in the 1832 presidential election.

Born in Lancaster County, Pennsylvania, he established a legal career in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania after attending Litchfield Law School. During the War of 1812, he served as an aide to General John Forster. After serving in the Pennsylvania House of Representatives, Ellmaker accepted appointment as the Pennsylvania Attorney General. He returned to private practice in 1819 and helped found the Pennsylvania Railroad and the Philadelphia and Columbia Railroad.

From 1828 to 1829, Ellmaker served another term as Pennsylvania Attorney General. In 1832, Ellmaker was nominated as the Anti-Masonic vice presidential candidate. The ticket of William Wirt and Ellmaker took 7.8% of the national popular vote and won the state of Vermont. Ellmaker sought election to the United States Senate in 1834 but was defeated by James Buchanan. After the election, Ellmaker retired from politics and practiced law in Lancaster, Pennsylvania.

==Education==
Amos Ellmaker was born in Leacock Township, Lancaster County, Pennsylvania on a property called, &quot;Apple Bottom&quot;, the son of Peter Ellmaker and Susannah (Carpenter) Ellmaker. He graduated from Princeton College in 1805, attended the Litchfield Law School, and continued his legal studies under James Hopkins, the same Lancaster attorney who trained James Buchanan. Ellmaker completed his studies in the Harrisburg office of Thomas Elder, whose daughter he later married. In 1808, Ellmaker was admitted to the bar and began practicing law in Harrisburg.

==Public service==
On Jan. 13, 1809, at age 21, Ellmaker was appointed deputy attorney general for Dauphin County, Pennsylvania.

He served in the Pennsylvania House of Representatives in 1813 and 1814, elected from the legislative district composed of Dauphin and Lebanon Counties.

He volunteered for the militia during the War of 1812 and served in 1814 as aide-de-camp to Brigadier General John Forster during the Chesapeake Campaign. While in this position, he was elected to the Fourteenth Congress from the congressional district consisting of Lancaster, Dauphin, and Lebanon Counties, but never filled that office. On July 3, 1815 Ellmaker was appointed Judge of the Twelfth Judicial District of Pennsylvania, composed of Dauphin, Lebanon, and Schuylkill Counties.

Ellmaker resigned from the bench in December 1816 to accept Governor Simon Snyder&#x27;s appointment as Pennsylvania Attorney General. Governor William Findlay re-appointed him in 1818, and Ellmaker served until December 1819.

In 1817, Ellmaker declined an offer from James Monroe to serve as Secretary of War. During his career, he also twice turned down offers of appointment as Secretary of the Commonwealth, and twice as justice of the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania.

In 1821, Ellmaker moved from Harrisburg to Lancaster, where he continued to practice law.

===Pennsylvania Railroad===
In 1823, Ellmaker was an original incorporator of the Pennsylvania Railroad. In 1826, he was an original incorporator of the Columbia, Lancaster and Philadelphia Railroad, as was James Buchanan.

In May 1828, Ellmaker returned to the office of state Attorney General, and served until August 1829.

===1832 Presidential campaign===

In 1832, Ellmaker was the candidate for Vice President on the Anti-Masonic ticket, with William Wirt as the candidate for president. Wirt and Ellmaker won in Vermont, and received seven electoral votes.

In 1834, Ellmaker ran for the United States Senate, losing to James Buchanan. After this election, Ellmaker retired from politics and continued the practice of law.

In 1838, the Lancaster Female Seminary was incorporated, with Ellmaker as one of the original 10 trustees.

==Personal life==
In 1816, Ellmaker married Mary Rachael Elder (born December 31, 1799 in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania; died March 15, 1866), the daughter of Thomas Elder. They had two sons, Nathaniel (born April 28, 1817 in Harrisburg) and Levi Ellmaker (born 1828 in Harrisburg).

==Death and burial==
On November 28, 1851, Ellmaker died in Lancaster, Pennsylvania. He was buried in the churchyard of St. James&#x27; Episcopal Church in Lancaster.
