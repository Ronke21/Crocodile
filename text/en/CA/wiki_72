<text>The Young Finnish Party or Constitutional-Fennoman Party ( or ) was a liberal and nationalist political party in the Grand Duchy of Finland. It began as an upper-class reformist movement during the 1870s and formed as a political party in 1894.

==Background==

Industrialization and opening of the Finnish economy by Emperor Alexander II gave room for liberal economic thinking. The Young Finns opposed on constitutional basis Russification efforts commenced by Emperor Nicholas II during 1899-1905. During that period various political factions joined the movement and they were held together by a common opponent, the autocratic Russian Empire. The movement separated itself from the main Fennoman movement, the Finnish Party due to political competition between two political generations that had differing views on Finland&#x27;s constitutional status in the Russian Empire.

In 1907, after a general strike that finished the first Russification period and brought parliamentary democracy with universal suffrage and a unicameral parliament to Finland, the Young Finnish Party took part in the first Finnish parliamentary election as a liberal-minded centrist party. However, already during the 19th century there had been disputes inside the party over its political line, and after the pressure by Russia eased the major differences between the separate groups became open and there was even discussion of establishing two completely separate factions or parties. The party was formally kept together, but was split in two major groups: the &quot;sparrows&quot; (&quot;varpuset&quot;) led by Kaarlo Juho Ståhlberg and the &quot;swallows&quot; (&quot;pääskyt&quot;) led by Jonas Castrén and Pehr Evind Svinhufvud. The &quot;sparrows&quot; were a liberal faction seeking social liberalism and social reforms. They were initially oriented in foreign policy toward the United Kingdom and France, but after the Finnish Civil War of 1918 their support for Germany substantially increased. The members of the &quot;swallows&quot; were mainly conservative, part fundamentally conservative and part economically liberal, who did not emphasize the need for social reforms. During World War I and especially after the Civil War, they leaned on Germany. Svinhufvud strongly favored the German Empire and supported a monarchist political system for Finland. Ståhlberg urged full democracy and the formation of a republic in Finland. During the hegemony of Germany in 1918, the monarchists won the political battle and a clear majority of the Young Finns voted for a German prince Friedrich Karl to become the King of Finland. Only Ståhlberg and few other Young Finns voted against monarchy during the crucial election.

==End of the party==
After Germany&#x27;s defeat in the Great War in late 1918, the Young Finnish Party finally split into two new parties. A minority of members joined Svinhufvud in forming the conservative, monarchist National Coalition Party (together with the majority of the Finnish Party), while the majority joined Ståhlberg in forming the liberal, republican National Progressive Party. After the defeat of the German Empire in World War I, the monarchist policy had collapsed and Ståhlberg, as the first President of Finland elected on July 25, 1919, became the leader of the Republic of Finland.

A small economically right-wing party with the same name, Young Finns, was established in the 1990s. The newer party gained two seats in the Parliament, but lost them in the next elections.

<text>The Finnish Party () was a Fennoman conservative political party in the autonomous Grand Duchy of Finland and independent Finland. Born out of Finland&#x27;s language strife in the 1860s, the party sought to improve the position of the Finnish language in Finnish society. Johan Vilhelm Snellman, Yrjö Sakari Yrjö-Koskinen, and Johan Richard Danielson-Kalmari were its ideological leaders. The party&#x27;s chief organ was the Suometar newspaper, later Uusi Suometar, and its members were sometimes called Suometarians (&quot;suomettarelaiset&quot;).

==History==
The party started to form around a core of Fennoman intellectuals in the 1860s, but remained formally unorganized for decades. Improving the status of the Finnish language, especially furthering its use in education, was a central issue from the start. In the 1877–1878 sessions of the Diet of Finland the party attained a leading role among the clergy and the peasantry, which it would hold till 1904.

In the 1880s, a faction within the party took a critical view of Russia, eventually breaking away and founding the Young Finnish Party in 1894. The Finnish Party sought legitimacy in the eyes of the Russian authorities and saw cooperation with Russia as a way to enact its language policies. When Russification began in 1899, the Young Finns advocated passive resistance, whereas the Finnish Party, now often called the Old Finns (&quot;vanhasuomalaiset&quot;), supported appeasement. Although the party maintained that Finland&#x27;s rights were being violated, it emphasized the importance of keeping official positions in Finnish hands and feared that resistance could lead to further loss of autonomy.

Aside from the central language question, the party espoused conservative values and supported many social reforms, especially during Danielson-Kalmari&#x27;s time as its ideological leader after Yrjö-Koskinen&#x27;s death in 1903. On economic issues, the 1906 party program placed the party in the political centre, between the Social Democratic Party on the left and the Young Finns on the right. After the 1906 parliamentary reform, the party was consistently the biggest non-socialist party in parliamentary elections in 1907–1917 and the second biggest overall after the Social Democrats. However, it lost seats in every election, sliding down from 59 MPs in 1907 to 32 in 1917.

After the Finnish independence in December 1917 and the Civil War of 1918, Russification was no longer an issue and the language question had lost a great deal of its importance in Finnish politics. The main issues holding the party together were now secondary to economic and constitutional issues. Although it had agreed to establishing a republican form of government before the war, the party leadership now switched to supporting constitutional monarchy. Party leaders saw in a monarchy a bulwark against socialism and thought that the election of a German prince as a monarch would guarantee Germany&#x27;s military support, but the plan failed when the First World War ended in a German capitulation and the abolition of German Monarchy. In December 1918, the party&#x27;s supporters divided into two new parties, with a majority going to the conservative, monarchist National Coalition Party and a minority to the liberal, republican National Progressive Party.

<text>A chemise or shift is a classic smock type of women&#x27;s undergarment or dress. Historically, a chemise was a simple garment worn next to the skin to protect clothing from sweat and body oils, the precursor to the modern shirts commonly worn in Western nations.

==Etymology==
The English word &quot;chemise&quot; is a loanword from the French word for shirt and is related to the Italian or Latin , which, according to Elizabeth Wayland Barber, is likely derived from Celtic.

==History==

The chemise seems to have developed from the Roman &quot;tunica&quot; and first became popular in Europe in the Middle Ages. At this time, the chemise was commonly referred to as a &quot;kemse&quot; or &quot;kemes&quot;. A type of undergarment worn close to the skin in order to protect outergarments, though the term chemise has since been commonly considered a women’s garment, during this period (Medieval through to the 15th century), it was also used to describe an item of men’s underclothing. Women wore a shift or chemise under their gown or robe; while men wore a chemise with their trousers or &quot;braies&quot;, and covered the chemise with garments such as doublets, robes, etc.

A chemise, shift, or smock was usually sewn at home, by the women of a household. It was assembled from rectangles and triangles cut from one piece of cloth so as to leave no waste. The poor would wear chemises pieced from a narrow piece of rough cloth; while the rich might have voluminous chemises pieced from thin, smooth fine linen. 
Chemise during the period up to the 15th century were most often made from linen, Over time cotton chemise also came into popularity, with both linen and cotton easy to wash – underclothes often being the only piece of clothing that was washed regularly. Further, through the 17th and 18th centuries, linen was considered an essential means of maintaining cleanliness, and therefore, health, a starched white chemise served as an indicator of an individual’s personal hygiene.

The term chemise was first used to describe an outer garment in the 1780s, when Queen Marie Antoinette of France popularized a kind of informal, loose-fitting gown of sheer white cotton, resembling a chemise in both cut and material, which became known as the . Such a &quot;chemise gown&quot; was made from very lightweight, slightly sheer fabrics, including muslin, silk, or cambric.

In saying this, through the 18th century, chemise continued to be used to refer primarily to an undergarment, the type earlier described as a &quot;smock&quot; for women, and a &quot;shirt&quot; for men. Through the century, the term &quot;shift&quot; slowly replaced smock, which would eventually be exchanged for chemise in the 19th century, when chemise came into common use to refer to such a garment, as it was deemed more socially acceptable than shift, which had developed connotations of crudeness. 

Into the 19th century, the chemise as an undergarment developed structure, fitting to the bust where worn next to the skin, underneath a pair of stays, the shaping and fabrics used reminiscent of late 18th century chemise. Though simple in design, the early 19th century chemise often featured small decorative elements, such as a lace or ruffled edge.

Where early and mid-19th century examples are often of plain cotton with a square-cut neckline, through the century, chemise as an undergarment developed different shapes and styles, some being highly decorative with trimmings and embroidery. Through the century, different types of undergarments began to be worn, including combinations.

In Western countries, the chemise as an undergarment fell out of fashion in the early 20th century, and was generally replaced by a brassiere, girdle, and full slip, and panties first came to be worn.

Men&#x27;s chemises may be said to have survived as the common T-shirt, which still serves as an undergarment. The chemise also morphed into the smock-frock, a garment worn by English laborers until the early 20th century. Its loose cut and wide sleeves were well adapted to heavy labor. The name &quot;smock&quot; is still used for military combat jackets in the UK.

==Modern chemise==
A modern chemise is generally a woman&#x27;s garment that vaguely resembles the older shirts but is typically more delicate, and usually more revealing. Most commonly the term refers to a loose-fitting, sleeveless undergarment or type of lingerie which is unfitted at the waist. It can also refer to a short, sleeveless dress that hangs straight from the shoulders and fits loosely at the waist. A chemise typically does not have any buttons or other fasteners and is put on by either dropping it over the head or stepping into it and lifting it up.

As lingerie, a chemise is similar to a babydoll, which is also a short, loose-fitting, sleeveless garment. Typically, though, babydolls are looser fitting at the hips.

<text>Alvecote Priory is a ruined Benedictine Priory in Alvecote, Warwickshire, England. The site has been scheduled as an ancient monument. Now very little remains of the priory, most of the walls have been eroded but a fairly high wall remains on one side. The main entrance arch is the most impressive feature, still standing at around high. The attached dovecote also survives, however both the ruined priory and dovecot are on the Heritage at Risk Register due to vandalism and water damage.

==History==
It was founded 1159 by William Burdett as a dependency of Great Malvern Priory. After returning from a crusade, Burdett accused his wife of being unfaithful and stabbed her, and as penance founded the monastery. Little is known of the history of this small priory, which was a dependency of Great Malvern Priory. We only know the names of five of its priors. The first prior of whom any record survives was William de Wikwane who resigned in 1282. The last priors of this small house occurred in rapid succession. William Sutton was recorded as prior in 1535 but by the following year he had been succeeded by William Umberleye. It was probably he who finally surrendered the house to the King&#x27;s commissioners when the mother house of Great Malvern was finally dissolved in 1540.

Dugdale stated that the tomb of the founder was located in an arch of the wall on the north side of the church and was covered by “a plain free stone curiously embossed with the sculpture of a large cross”. The priory was not richly endowed and the taxation of 1291 gave its property a value of £7 9s 2d. After two centuries the priory buildings were in poor repair and the monks gained the favour of Edward III. Protection was granted to the monks and their attorneys to collect alms in churches for the restoration of the church and cloister. The priory was suppress in 1543 and the priory and its lands were granted to Chancellor Audley. In June it was alienated to Joan Robynson, the widow of the mercer George Robynson of London. The priory remains are now included in Pooley Country Park.

The priory house (ruin in 1965) was built from the stone of the old Benedictine Priory.

<text>William Smith O&#x27;Brien (; 17 October 1803 – 18 June 1864) was an Irish nationalist Member of Parliament (MP) and a leader of the Young Ireland movement. He also encouraged the use of the Irish language. He was convicted of sedition for his part in the Young Irelander &quot;Famine Rebellion&quot; of 1848 but his sentence of death was commuted to deportation to Van Diemen&#x27;s Land. In 1854, he was released on the condition of exile from Ireland, and he lived in Brussels for two years. In 1856 Smith O&#x27;Brien was pardoned and returned to Ireland, but he was never active again in politics.

==Early life==
Born in Dromoland, Newmarket on Fergus, County Clare, William Smith O&#x27;Brien was the second son of Sir Edward O&#x27;Brien, 4th Baronet, of Dromoland Castle. His mother was Charlotte Smith, whose father owned a property called &quot;Cahirmoyle&quot; in County Limerick. William took the additional surname &quot;Smith&quot;, his mother&#x27;s maiden name, upon inheriting the property. He lived at Cahermoyle House, a mile from Ardagh, County Limerick. He was a descendant of the eleventh century Ard Rí (High King of Ireland), Brian Boru.
He received an upper-class English education at Harrow School and Trinity College, Cambridge.
Subsequently, he studied law at King&#x27;s Inns in Dublin and Lincoln&#x27;s Inn in London.

From April 1828 to 1831 Smith O&#x27;Brien was the Tory faction MP for Ennis, his father&#x27;s borough. Although a Protestant country-gentleman, he supported Catholic Emancipation and the Roman Catholic Relief Act 1829 while remaining a supporter of British-Irish union.

In 1835 Smith O&#x27;Brien became Whig MP for County Limerick. In 1837 Daniel O&#x27;Connell clashed with him over his opposition to the introduction of secret voting in elections and also Smith O&#x27;Brien&#x27;s support for granting state payments to Catholic clergy. The Catholic Bishops came out in support of O&#x27;Connell&#x27;s stance on Church and nation, resolving &quot;most energetically to oppose any such arrangement, and that they look upon those that labour to effect it as the worst enemies of the Catholic religion.&quot;

Smith O&#x27;Brien remained in the House of Commons until 1849 when his seat was forfeited.

==Young Ireland and the Irish Confederation==
In 1843, in protest against the imprisonment of Daniel O&#x27;Connell, he joined O&#x27;Connell&#x27;s anti-union Repeal Association. Within the association he identified with the circle around Charles Gavan Duffy and his paper &quot;The Nation&quot; which O&#x27;Connell in hostile reference to Giuseppe Mazzini&#x27;s anti-clerical and insurrectionary Young Italy dubbed Young Ireland.

After O&#x27;Connell and his son John forced a division with resolutions renouncing a resort to revolutionary force regardless of circumstances, Smith O&#x27;Brien withdrew with the Young Irelanders into a new Irish Confederation, although he was to continue to preach reconciliation until O&#x27;Connell&#x27;s death in May 1847. The objectives of the Confederation were &quot;independence of the Irish nation&quot; with &quot;no means to attain that end abjured, save such as were inconsistent with honour, morality and reason&quot;.

In the Confederation Duffy was trying to hold together a broad national coalition, and had for that reason advanced Smith O&#x27;Brien, as a Protestant and a landowner, to the leadership. On the Confederation&#x27;s Council Duffy and Smith O&#x27;Brien were supported by Patrick James Smyth who argued that with propertied classes, as well as the priesthood opposed, the Confederation could not, in the event of insurrection, hope to call out a single parish in Ireland.

As the famine took hold, Smith O&#x27;Brien started organising practical relief. By the spring of 1848, the scale of the catastrophe facing the country persuaded all factions on the Irish Confederation Council that independence was an existential issue; that the immediate need was for an Irish national government able take control of national resources. In March 1848, Smith O&#x27;Brien called for the formation of a National Guard. He was arrested, but acquitted on a charge of sedition. In May, Duffy published &quot;The Creed of the Nation.&quot; If Irish independence was to come by force, it would be in the form of a Republic.

The Government made clear that its chosen response to the crisis in Ireland was coercion not concession. John Mitchel was convicted under new martial law measures approved by Parliament (including by a number of &quot;Old Ireland&quot; O&#x27;Connellite MPs). On 9 July 1848 Duffy was arrested for sedition. He managed to smuggle a few lines out to &quot;The Nation&quot; but the issue that would have carried his declaration, that there was no remedy now but the sword, was seized and the paper suppressed.

==Rebellion==

Planning for an insurrection had already advanced. Mitchel, although the first to call for action, had scoffed at the necessity for systematic preparation. Smith O&#x27;Brien, to Duffy&#x27;s surprise, attempted the task. In March 1848 Smith O&#x27;Brien and Thomas Francis Meagher returned from revolutionary Paris with hopes of French assistance. (Among the leading republicans in France, Ledru-Rollin had been loud in his declaration of French support for the Irish cause). There was also talk of an Irish-American brigade and of a Chartist diversion in England With Duffy&#x27;s arrest, it was left to Smith O&#x27;Brien to confront the reality of the Confederates&#x27; &quot;domestic&quot; isolation.

Having with Meagher and John Dillon gathered a small group of both landowners and tenants, on 23 July Smith O&#x27;Brien raised the standard or revolt in Kilkenny. This was a tricolour he and Meagher had brought back from France, its colours (green for Catholics, orange for Protestants) intended to symbolise the United Irish republican ideal.

As Smith O&#x27;Brien proceeded into County Tipperary he was greeted by curious crowds, but found himself in command of only a few hundred ill-clad largely unarmed men. They scattered after their first skirmish with the constabulary, derisively referred to by &quot;The Times&quot; of London as &quot;Battle of Widow McCormack&#x27;s Cabbage Patch&quot;.

==Conviction==

In Smith O&#x27;Brien&#x27;s subsequent trial, the jury found him guilty of high treason. He was sentenced to be hanged, drawn, and quartered. Petitions for clemency were signed by 70,000 people in Ireland and 10,000 people in England.

In Dublin on 5 June 1849, the sentences of Smith O&#x27;Brien and his confederates Meagher, Terence MacManus and Patrick O&#x27;Donoghue were commuted to transportation for life to Van Diemen&#x27;s Land (Tasmania in present-day Australia).

Smith O&#x27;Brien attempted to escape from Maria Island off Tasmania, but was betrayed by Ellis, the captain of the schooner hired for the escape. He was sent to Port Arthur where he met up with John Mitchel, who had been transported before the rebellion. The cottages which Smith O&#x27;Brien lived in on Maria Island and Port Arthur have been preserved in their 19th century state as memorials.

Having emigrated to the United States, Ellis was tried by another Young Irelanders leader, Terence MacManus, at a lynch court in San Francisco for the betrayal of Smith O&#x27;Brien. He was freed for lack of evidence.

In 1854, after five years in Tasmania, Smith O&#x27;Brien was released on the condition he never return to the United Kingdom. He settled in Brussels. In May 1856, he was granted an unconditional pardon and returned to Ireland that July. He contributed to the &quot;Nation&quot; newspaper, and published the two-volume &quot;Principles of Government, or Meditations in Exile&quot; in 1856. But despite the efforts of George Henry Moore to recruit him as a leader of the Independent Irish Party, Smith O&#x27;Brien played no further part in politics.

In 1864 he visited England and Wales, with the view of rallying his failing health, but no improvement took place, and he died at Bangor, in Wales on 16 June 1864.

===Quotes===
* &quot;The new Irish flag would be Orange and Green, and would be known as the Irish tricolor.&quot;
* &quot;To find a gaol in one of the lovliest spots formed by Nature in one of her loneliest solitudes creates a revulsion of feeling I cannot describe.&quot; November 1849, when first sighting Maria Island.

===Memorial===

A statue of William Smith O&#x27;Brien stands in O&#x27;Connell Street, Dublin. Sculpted in Portland limestone, it was designed by Thomas Farrell and erected in D&#x27;Olier Street, Dublin, in 1870. It was moved to its present position in 1929.

Smith O&#x27;Brien Avenue in Limerick city is named for him. As is Smith O&#x27;Brien&#x27;s GAA club, in Killaloe, County Clare.

In the United States, O&#x27;Brien County, Iowa is named after him.

===Irish language===
Smith O&#x27;Brien was a founding member of the Ossianic Society, whose aim was to further the revival of the Irish language and to publish and translate literature relating to the Fenian Cycle of Irish mythology.

He wrote to his son Edward from Van Diemen&#x27;s Land, urging him to learn the Irish language. He himself studied the language and used an Irish-language Bible, and presented to the Royal Irish Academy Irish-language manuscripts he had collected. He enjoyed the respect of County Clare bards (the county being largely Irish-speaking at the time), and in 1863, on his advice, Irish was introduced into a number of schools there.

===Family===
While studying in London Smith O&#x27;Brien met Mary Ann Wilton and fathered two children born to her. In Autumn 1832 he married Lucy Caroline Gabbett (1811–1861) of County Limerick. They had five boys and two girls.

The children of William Smith O&#x27;Brien and Lucy O&#x27;Brien were Edward William (Ned) (1831–1909), William Joseph (1839–1867), Lucy Josephine (1840–1907), Lucius Henry (1842–1913), Robert Donough (1844–1917), Charlotte Grace (1845–1909) and Charles Murrough (1849–1877). The elder daughter Lucy Josephine O&#x27;Brien married Rev John Gwynn and their children included writer and MP Stephen Gwynn, Lucy Gwynn who was the first woman registrar of Trinity College Dublin, and Edward Gwynn who was Provost of Trinity College Dublin. O&#x27;Brien&#x27;s younger daughter Charlotte Grace O&#x27;Brien was a campaigner for the better treatment of Irish emigrants.

William Smith O&#x27;Brien&#x27;s elder brother Lucius O&#x27;Brien (1800–1872) was for some time member of parliament for County Clare.

William Smith O&#x27;Brien&#x27;s sister Harriet O&#x27;Brien married an Anglican priest but was soon widowed. As Harriet Monsell, she founded the order of Anglican nuns, the Community of St John Baptist, in Clewer, Windsor, in 1851. The gold cross she wore, and which still belongs to the Community, was made with gold panned by her brother during his exile in Australia.

<text>Amara Essy (born 20 December 1944) is a diplomat from Ivory Coast.

==Early life and education==
Essy was born in Bouaké, Ivory Coast. He received a bachelor&#x27;s degree in public law and a higher education diploma in public law as well.

==Diplomatic career==
Essy began his professional career in 1970 as head of economic relations in the office of technical and economic cooperation. A year later, he was named first counselor of the Ivorian embassy in Brazil. He also served as counselor of the permanent mission of Côte d&#x27;Ivoire to the United Nations in New York from 1973 to 1975. He later served as permanent representative of Côte d&#x27;Ivoire to the European office of the UN in Geneva and to UNIDO in Vienna, Austria from October 1975 to September 1978. He also served as president of the Group of 77 in Geneva from 1977 to 1978 and was later named ambassador extraordinary and plenipotentiary to Switzerland. He was the Permanent Representative of Côte d&#x27;Ivoire to the United Nations from 1981 to 1990, and in January 1990 he was President of the United Nations Security Council. Simultaneously, he served as Ivorian ambassador to Argentina (1981–1983), Cuba (1988–1990). In 1990 he became Minister of Foreign Affairs, and while in that position he served as President of the 49th Session of the United Nations General Assembly from 1994 to 1995. In February 1996, he was elected the mayor of Kouassi-Datékro, serving until 2000. In 1998 he gained the rank of Minister of State from 1998 to 2000, while remaining Foreign Minister. Along with other ministers, he was detained following the military coup of 24 December 1999, but he was released on 28 December. He was replaced in the transitional government named on 4 January 2000.

On 9 July 2001 he was elected secretary-general of the Organisation of African Unity (OAU) in Lusaka, Zambia, with the task of leading the OAU&#x27;s transformation into the African Union over the course of one year. He took office as secretary-general in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia on 17 September 2001. Essy served in that position until 9 July 2002, when the OAU became the African Union and he was appointed as interim Chairman of the Commission of the African Union.

Essy was initially a candidate for the post of chairman of the commission at the AU&#x27;s July 2003 summit in Maputo, but he withdrew prior to the vote, leaving Alpha Oumar Konaré, the former president of Mali, as the only candidate.

<text>In typography, overstrike is a method of printing characters that are missing from the printer&#x27;s character set. The character is created by placing one character on another one – for example, overstriking ⟨L⟩ with ⟨-⟩ results in printing a ⟨Ł⟩ (L with stroke) character.

The ASCII code supports six different diacritics. These are: grave accent, tilde, acute accent (approximated by the apostrophe), diaeresis (double quote), cedilla (comma), and circumflex accent. Each is typed by typing the preceding character, then backspace, and then the &#x27;related character&#x27;, which is ⟨`⟩, ⟨~⟩, ⟨&#x27;⟩, ⟨&quot;⟩, or ⟨^⟩, respectively for the above-mentioned accents.

With the wide adoption of Unicode (especially UTF-8, which supports a much larger number of characters in different writing systems), this technique is of little use today. However, combining characters such as diacritics are still used to depict characters which cannot be shown otherwise.

Many font renderers in computer programs invent missing bold characters by overstriking the normal character with itself, slightly horizontally offset. The horizontal offset is essential since, unlike a typewriter where repeating a letter in exactly the same space will make it darker, most modern printers will not darken repeated &quot;strikes&quot; to the same space. Actual bold fonts are designed with some features thicker and others the same size as a regular font, so the use of this &quot;fake bold&quot; is considered undesirable from a typographic point of view. Overstriking with an offset was also used to created &quot;Blackboard bold&quot; style characters used in mathematics.

The character set for the APL programming language includes several characters that were printed by overstriking other characters on printing terminals such as the IBM 2741, for example the functions and may be used to reverse the elements of an array.

The WordPerfect word processor includes overstrike functionality. Collabora Online, LibreOffice and Microsoft Word do not; however Collabora Online and LibreOffice allow the use of the characters X and / (forward slash) to overstrike, using the strikethrough function.
No known keyboard arrangement includes a function key that allows any two characters to be superimposed.

<text>Jerome Young (born August 14, 1976) is an American former track and field sprinter who specialized in the 400-meter dash. He won gold medals with the United States 4 × 400-meter relay team at the 2001 World Championships in Athletics and 1997 World Championships in Athletics, but was later stripped of these medals due to doping and was ultimately banned from the sport. He also was the heats runner for the relay team at the 2000 Summer Olympics, where the Americans won gold, but this medal was rescinded as well.

==Background==
Born in Clarendon, Jamaica, he attended A.I. Prince Technical High School in Hartford, Connecticut. In 1995, as a senior in high school, Jerome set a Connecticut state record of 45.01 in the 400 m. He was &quot;Track and Field News&quot; &quot;High School Athlete of the Year&quot; in 1995.

Jerome was part of the world record breaking 4 × 400 m relay team in 1998 along with Michael Johnson, Antonio Pettigrew, and Tyree Washington.

On June 29, 2004 the IAAF announced that Young committed a doping offense on 26 June 1999.

The effect of the decision was to negate all his results from 26 June 1999 to 25 June 2001, and to ban him permanently from the date of the decision. Accordingly, he and his teammates were stripped of their 2000 Olympic medal in the 4x400 m relay.

The Court of Arbitration for Sport reinstated the 2000 Olympic gold for Jerome&#x27;s relay teammates in 2005. Jerome had not run in the final; he had only run in one of the qualifying heats.

Young and the U.S. team had previously been stripped of the 2003 world championship relay gold due to a doping admission by teammate Calvin Harrison.

On August 2, 2008, the International Olympic Committee stripped the gold medal from the U.S. men&#x27;s 4x400-meter relay team, due to a doping admission by teammate Antonio Pettigrew.

Jerome Young resides in Raleigh, NC as a sprinting coach at Millbrook High School. Jerome also teaches special education at high school.

==International competitions==
These were later stripped due to Young&#x27;s drug use during his career.

<text>The Greens (, , ) is a green political party in Luxembourg.

==Party history==

===1983–93===
The Luxembourgish Greens were founded on 23 June 1983 as the Green Alternative Party (GAP). Among its founding members were people engaged in the peace movement and the movement against a nuclear power plant in Luxembourg. Many came from left socialist groups that had split from the LSAP and from the former Maoist movement who had already in 1979 been involved in the electoral Alternative List - Resist. In the 1984 elections, the party two seats in the Chamber of Deputies. In 1985, however the GAP split and its more conservative wing founded the Green List Ecological Initiative (GLEI). They competed separately in the 1989 election, where they won two seats each.

===1994–2003===

In 1994, the two parties presented a common list for the elections. They won five seats in the Chamber, getting nearly 11% of the votes, which made them the fourth strongest force in parliament. In that year&#x27;s European elections, which coincided with the national elections, the party won one of the six seats allotted to Luxembourg. In 1995, the two parties merged officially. That same year, the Greens&#x27; MEP, Jup Weber, left the party again, forming the Green and Liberal Alliance and joining the European Radical Alliance in the European Parliament.

In the 1999 elections, the party lost a considerable number of votes (falling to 9%), but retained its five seats in the Chamber and re-gained its single seat in the European Parliament.

===Since 2004===
In 2004, the Greens regained the ground that they had lost in 1999 and won two additional seats in the Chamber. Although they got 15% of the votes in the coinciding European elections, placing them third, they couldn&#x27;t add to their single seat.

In the June 2009 elections, the Luxembourg Green Party further increased their European score to 16,83% and sent its outgoing MEP Claude Turmes to Brussels and Strasbourg for a third mandate. In the coinciding national elections, they kept a status quo (+0,13%). Its 7 Members of Parliament (MP) all got reelected. However, its longest serving MP and founding member Jean Huss declared the following day, that he would retire from parliamentary politics in 2011 to the benefit of Josée Lorsché.

In the 2013 general election, the Greens stagnated at 10.1% and their number of seats dropped to 6. However, they became part of a three-party-coalition government with the liberal Democratic Party (DP) and the Luxembourg Socialist Workers&#x27; Party (LSAP) led by DP&#x27;s Xavier Bettel. The Greens had three ministers: Félix Braz, Minister for Justice, François Bausch, Minister for Sustainable Development and Infrastructure and Carole Dieschbourg, Minister for the Environment. It was the first time that the Greens were part of a national government of Luxembourg. 

Since the 2023 election, they have been in opposition again.

==Ideology and issues==
The Greens are a typical green party. Sustainable development is one of their key issues. However, topics such as an ecological tax reform, renewable energy and energy efficiency or the consolidation of pension funds play an equally and ever increasingly important role. Especially in a country such as Luxembourg, pioneer of a new melting-pot society in Europe, equal participation of migrants is of utmost importance.

Furthermore, in its declaration of principles it has outlined, among others, the following priorities:
* Human rights and solidarity
* Democracy
* Social justice
* Structural change of the economy
* Equality between men and women
* A commitment to a green and social Europe.

==Electoral results==
===Chamber of Deputies===


===European Parliament===
==Organisation==

===Organisational structure===
The Congress is the highest organ of the party. It sets out the party&#x27;s strategy and political course and is open to all members of the party. Every two years, the congress elects the leadership of the party&#x27;s organisation: two presidents, an executive committee, the party board in which the party&#x27;s youth wing and the gender council are also represented, an executive council that represents the congress, the treasurer and a financial control board.

===International organisations===
The Greens are member of the European Green Party and the Global Greens.

<text>The Winner is a 1996 film directed by Alex Cox and written by Wendy Riss based on her play &quot;A Darker Purpose&quot;. Most noted for its quirky cast (Vincent D&#x27;Onofrio, Richard Edson, Michael Madsen, Billy Bob Thornton and Frank Whaley) and art department, including production designer Cecilia Montiel.

The film was substantially re-edited by its executive producers, Mark Damon and Rebecca De Mornay, and the original score – by Cox&#x27;s longtime collaborators Pray for Rain – was replaced by a jazz score. Cox requested that his name be removed from the credits.

==Plot==
Phillip is a naive nobody with an uncanny knack for winning in a casino. Not much caring if he wins or loses, Phillip goes on a weeks-long hot streak in Las Vegas that ultimately comes to the attention of a lot of people who want his money.

Lusting after it most is Louise, a lounge singer and con artist who seduces Phillip in the Liberace museum, then lies to him that she is $150,000 in debt from medical and funeral expenses for her parents.

Her ex-husband Wolf wants a piece of the action as well. He just happens to be Phillip&#x27;s brother, and is lugging around the corpse of their own dead father. Louise&#x27;s current boyfriend Jack is another interested party, as is a loan shark, Kingman, and a mob hit man, Joey, who&#x27;s perfectly willing to shoot innocent bystanders in the casino if it&#x27;ll get him what he wants. Phillip seems helpless against them, but there may be more to him than meets the eye.

==Cast==
* Rebecca De Mornay as Louise
* Vincent D&#x27;Onofrio as Phillip
* Richard Edson as Frankie
* Delroy Lindo as Kingman
* Michael Madsen as Wolf

<doc id="779817" wikidata="Q7268270" url="?curid=779817" title="Quad City DJ's">
<text>Quad City DJ&#x27;s is an American music group originally consisting of Jay Ski (Johnny McGowan), C.C. Lemonhead (Nathaniel Orange), and JeLana LaFleur who recorded the 1996 hit &quot;C&#x27;mon N&#x27; Ride It (The Train)&quot;, a rap-remix of Barry White&#x27;s 1974 &quot;Theme from Together Brothers&quot;. They are also known for writing and performing the theme song to the 1996 live-action/animated basketball film &quot;Space Jam&quot;.

==Background==
===1988–1995: Early years===
Ski and Lemonhead first partnered in 1988 in Jacksonville, Florida. They first were in a group known as Chill Deal. During this time they produced fellow acts Three Grand and Icey J, the latter being famous for the female answer rap to Rob Base&#x27;s &quot;It Takes Two&quot; entitled &quot;It Takes a Real Man&quot;. After Chill Deal dissolved, they reformed as 95 South to create the triple platinum hit &quot;Whoot, There It Is&quot;. Their success led to work with Dis-n-Dat producing &quot;Freak Me Baby&quot; and 69 Boyz producing the double platinum single &quot;Tootsee Roll&quot;.

===1996–1997: Formation and &quot;Get On Up and Dance&quot;===
In 1996, Ski and Lemonhead enlisted singer JeLanna “Lana” LaFleur and formed Quad City DJ&#x27;s; the term &quot;Quad&quot; in the group&#x27;s name is a local reference to bass. In February 1996, they released the single &quot;C&#x27;mon N&#x27; Ride It (The Train)&quot;. The song was a success, peaking at number three on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 and was certified platinum. Following its release, Lemonhead opted to take a step back from the limelight and instead the group was marketed as a duo.

As a duo, Quad City DJ&#x27;s released their debut album &quot;Get On Up and Dance&quot; in June 1996. It peaked at number 31 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 200 and was certified platinum. Along with the &quot;C&#x27;mon N&#x27; Ride It (The Train)&quot;, the album also included the minor hit &quot;Summer Jam&quot; which was released as a single the following year and peaked at #27 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot Rap Singles chart.

Later in 1996, the duo contributed to the &quot;Space Jam&quot; soundtrack, performing its titular theme song. The song peaked at number 37 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100.

In the summer of 1997, the duo co-headlined the Dance Across America tour with La Bouche.

===2015–present: Later releases and new members===
In 2015, Quad City DJ&#x27;s released the single &quot;4 Minute TwerkOut&quot;; the release was credited to Jay Ski and the Quad City DJ&#x27;s. Another single, &quot;What Happens Here Stays Here&quot;, was released in 2017.

In 2021, the group began touring occasionally across the United States with a new line-up featuring original member C.C. Lemonhead alongside new members Tony WHOA! (Anthony Wallace II) and Tamara Wallace (formerly of the Funky Green Dogs). A year prior, this line-up recorded &quot;Brand New Jam&quot; for the soundtrack to &quot;Space Jam: A New Legacy&quot;, but it ended up not being included on the soundtrack.

<text>Alcester Abbey was a Benedictine monastery in Alcester, Warwickshire in England, founded in 1138 by the Botellers of Oversley, Warwickshire. Its many endowments included the Chapel of St. James and St. Peter, near Shaftesbury, Dorset; the manor of Blynfield in the parish of St. James, which is known as the &#x27;Manor of Alcester and Bec&#x27;; and a number of other churches and estates.

The last of its priors was Richard Tutbury, from 1459 to 1466. In 1467 it was annexed by Evesham Abbey, from whence it had a prior or warden who was an Evesham monk. In 1536 its ownership was transferred to Thomas Cromwell. Little now remains of the site.

<doc id="779822" wikidata="Q1356937" url="?curid=779822" title="Ernie Ladd">
<text>Ernest L. Ladd (November 28, 1938 – March 10, 2007), nicknamed &quot;the Big Cat&quot;, was an American professional football defensive tackle and professional wrestler. A standout athlete in high school, Ladd attended Grambling State University on a basketball scholarship before being drafted in 1961 by the San Diego Chargers of the American Football League (AFL). Ladd found success in the AFL as one of the largest players in professional football history at 6′9″ and 290 pounds. He helped the Chargers to four AFL championship games in five years, winning the championship with the team in 1963. He also had stints with the Kansas City Chiefs and Houston Oilers. Ladd took up professional wrestling during the AFL offseason, and after a knee injury ended his football career turned to it full-time in 1969.

As a professional wrestler, Ladd became one of the top heels in the business. For the majority of his career, he played a villainous character who would arrogantly taunt both opponents and crowds. Ladd feuded with many popular wrestlers of the time, including Wahoo McDaniel, André the Giant, Bobo Brazil, Dusty Rhodes, and Mr. Wrestling, and even had a heel to heel feud with Professor Toru Tanaka, before retiring from the ring in 1986.

For his American football career, Ladd was inducted into the Chargers Hall of Fame in 1981 and the Grambling State University Hall of Fame in 1989. For his professional wrestling career he was inducted into the WCW Hall of Fame in 1994, the WWF Hall of Fame in 1995, the &quot;Wrestling Observer Newsletter&quot; Hall of Fame in 1996, and the NWA Hall of Fame in 2013.

Ladd was diagnosed with colon cancer in the winter of 2003–2004, and died from the disease on March 10, 2007, at the age of 68.

==Early life==
Ladd was born in Rayville, Louisiana, and raised in Orange, Texas by his mother Louada and stepfather James Ford. He was a high school football and basketball star. His football coach at Wallace High School was the legendary William Ray Smith Sr., father of NFL star Bubba Smith. Ladd subsequently attended Grambling State University on a basketball scholarship. He also played defensive tackle on the football team at Grambling under another legend, Eddie Robinson. He was the nephew of Grambling and Houston Oilers teammate Garland Boyette.

==Professional football career==
Ladd was drafted in the fourth round of the 1961 NFL draft by the Chicago Bears. He was also taken by the American Football League&#x27;s San Diego Chargers with their 15th pick (119th overall) in the 1961 AFL draft. He chose to sign with the Chargers.

At 6 ft 9 in and 290 pounds, Ladd was said to be the biggest and strongest man in professional football during his era. His physical measurements included a 52-inch chest, 39-inch waist, 20-inch biceps, 19-inch neck, and size 18D shoes.

Ladd played in four AFL championship games, helping the Chargers win the American Football League title in 1963 with teammate Earl Faison, both members of the original Fearsome Foursome. Ladd, an American Football League All-Star from 1962 through 1965, was one of the AFL players that organized a walkout on the 1965 AFL All-Star Game due to the racism they experienced in New Orleans.

Although Ladd found success with the Chargers, he had a contentious relationship with the Chargers front office. He started the 1965 season being indefinitely suspended from the team by Coach/General Manager Sid Gillman.

Ladd stated he and teammate Earl Faison would play out their contract options, opting to take a 10 percent cut in salary in exchange for becoming free agents at the end of the season. A planned trade with the Oilers in early 1966 would have sent Faison and Ladd to Houston. However, both were declared free agents by AFL commissioner Joe Foss, who ruled Oilers owner Bud Adams had tampered in trade dealings with the Chargers. Ladd refused to re-sign with the Chargers and suggested he might instead turn to professional wrestling full-time.

Eventually, Ladd signed with the Oilers and spent the 1966 season playing for them before moving in 1967 to the Kansas City Chiefs. There, with similarly king sized Grambling teammate and future Pro Football Hall of Famer Buck Buchanan (6 ft 7 in, 286 lbs), he filled out what was probably the biggest defensive tackle tandem in history. Both Ladd and Buchanan were inducted into the Grambling State University Athletic Hall of Fame.

Boston Patriots center Jon Morris said Ladd was so big &quot;It was dark. I couldn’t see the linebackers. I couldn’t see the goalposts. It was like being locked in a closet.&quot; In 1981, Ladd was inducted into the Chargers Hall of Fame.

He played in 112 consecutive games. He is a member of the Museum of the Gulf Coast Sports Hall of Fame.

==Professional wrestling career==
Ladd started wrestling in 1961. As a publicity stunt, some wrestlers in the San Diego area challenged Ladd to a private wrestling workout. Before long, Ladd was a part-time competitor in Los Angeles, during football&#x27;s off-season. Ladd became a huge draw in short order. When knee problems cut his football career short, Ladd turned to the more financially lucrative business of wrestling full-time in 1969. Ladd also said he could have continued playing football, but wrestling was more lucrative. He made $98,000 his first full year wrestling, and over $100,000/year after that, and “‘That was big money back in the ‘60s.’” After a run as a fan favorite, Ladd became one of wrestling&#x27;s most hated heels during the 1970s, as well as one of the first African American wrestlers to portray a heel character. It was Ladd’s idea to become a heel. He riled crowds with his arrogant and colorful demeanor during interviews, especially with his derogatory nicknames for opponents such as Wahoo McDaniel (whom he referred to as &quot;the Drunken Indian&quot;), and Mr. Wrestling (whom he called &quot;the Masked Varmint&quot; and insisted he was an escaped criminal). Ladd also controversially employed a taped thumb, claiming the support was needed due to an old football injury. Often when Ladd appeared to be in serious trouble during a match, he would walk out of the arena and accept a countout loss, known since as &quot;pulling an Ernie Ladd&quot;.

Ladd wrestled for a number of different professional associations, including the World Wide Wrestling Federation numerous times from 1968 to 1981. Additionally, he had several successful runs in the NWA territories, The Mid-South promotion, NWF, and WWC promotion.

Known for his immense size and power, it was a natural for Ladd to engage in feuds with other giants, including famously with André the Giant (whom Ladd antagonizingly referred to as &quot;Andre the Dummy&quot; or &quot;The Big Fat French Fry&quot; during interviews).

In certain areas, Ladd&#x27;s wrestling nickname was &quot;The King&quot;, and he would wear an ornate crown. In other wrestling associations, he was &quot;The Big Cat&quot;, and entered wearing a big cowboy hat.

After handily pinning Earl &quot;Mr. Universe&quot; Maynard the month prior, Ladd challenged Bruno Sammartino at Madison Square Garden for the WWWF title on March 1, 1976. In 1978, he wrestled WWWF champion Bob Backlund. When the International Wrestling Association had its brief run in the New York area, Ladd lost a two out of three falls match at Roosevelt Stadium, in Jersey City, New Jersey, to champion Mil Mascaras, two falls to one (he pinned Mascaras the first fall, was disqualified in the second, and was pinned by Mascaras in the third).

After leaving the WWWF, Ladd ventured to the Mid-South territory promoted by Bill Watts. While there, Ladd feuded with Paul Orndorff, Ray Candy, and Junkyard Dog. He also served as a manager to Afa and Sika, The Wild Samoans. Ladd also had a decent run as part of a tag team with &quot;Bad&quot; Leroy Brown in the early 1980s. Ladd also assisted Watts as a booker behind the scenes and had a large part in the development of Sylvester Ritter as the area&#x27;s top draw.

Ladd retired from wrestling in 1986 due to recurring knee problems. He then returned to the WWF as a color commentator, calling the 20-man battle royal at Wrestlemania 2 (which featured NFL players) and then earning a trial run doing commentary for various shows, including the April 1986 show at Madison Square Garden. He was also used as a fill-in for matches on syndicated programming such as &quot;WWF Championship Wrestling&quot;. Ladd also teamed with Gorilla Monsoon and Johnny Valiant in the broadcast booth during The Big Event at C.N.E. Stadium in Toronto, Ontario. Ladd, Monsoon, and Valiant were the original three-man team for the first few weeks of &quot;WWF Wrestling Challenge&quot;, before Ladd was replaced by Bobby Heenan and Valiant&#x27;s role was reduced significantly to only calling matches when Heenan had to be at ringside for one of the wrestlers he managed. Following this, Ladd quietly left the WWF.

He wrestled one more match on January 3, 1988, at a WWF house show in Long Island, New York in a 20-man battle royal won by Bam Bam Bigelow.

He was inducted into the WCW Hall of Fame in 1994 and the WWF Hall of Fame class of 1995, becoming the first (and for several years only) inductee in both halls.

==Later years==

Ladd was a longtime friend of the Bush family and supported the 2000 campaign of George W. Bush. Ladd also owned and operated Big Cat Ernie Ladd&#x27;s &quot;Throwdown&quot; BBQ Restaurant in New Orleans, Louisiana, until it was destroyed by Hurricane Katrina on August 29, 2005. In the disaster&#x27;s aftermath, he ministered to Katrina evacuees at the Astrodome. He was a friend of WWE Hall of Fame commentator Jim Ross. Ladd also appeared in an episode of &quot;That &#x27;70s Show&quot; entitled &quot;That Wrestling Show.&quot; He was in the locker room with The Rock, who was playing his own father &quot;Soul Man&quot; Rocky Johnson. Ladd was also a basketball coach for young kids in Franklin, Louisiana.

==Death==
Ladd was diagnosed with colon cancer in the winter of 2003–2004, being advised he had three to six months to live. He reportedly ignored the doctor&#x27;s diagnosis, stating “The doctor told me I had three to six months to live…I told the doctor that he’s a liar and that Dr. Jesus has got the verdict on me! I also told him, ‘You’re working with a miracle when you work with me.” The cancer eventually spread to his stomach and bones, and three years passed before he died on March 10, 2007, at the age of 68.

<text>The transfer DNA (abbreviated T-DNA) is the transferred DNA of the tumor-inducing (Ti) plasmid of some species of bacteria such as &quot;Agrobacterium tumefaciens&quot; and &quot;Agrobacterium rhizogenes (actually an Ri plasmid)&quot;. The T-DNA is transferred from bacterium into the host plant&#x27;s nuclear DNA genome. The capability of this specialized tumor-inducing (Ti) plasmid is attributed to two essential regions required for DNA transfer to the host cell. The T-DNA is bordered by 25-base-pair repeats on each end. Transfer is initiated at the right border and terminated at the left border and requires the &quot;vir&quot; genes of the Ti plasmid.

The bacterial T-DNA is about 24,000 base pairs long and contains plant-expressed genes that code for enzymes synthesizing opines and phytohormones. By transferring the T-DNA into the plant genome, the bacterium essentially reprograms the plant cells to grow into a tumor and produce a unique food source for the bacteria. The synthesis of the plant hormones auxin and cytokinin by enzymes encoded in the T-DNA enables the plant cell to overgrow, thus forming the crown gall tumors typically induced by &quot;Agrobacterium tumefaciens&quot; infection. &quot;Agrobacterium rhizogenes&quot; causes a similar infection known as hairy root disease. The opines are amino acid derivatives used by the bacterium as a source of carbon and energy. This natural process of horizontal gene transfer in plants is being utilized as a tool for fundamental and applied research in plant biology through &quot;Agrobacterium tumefaciens&quot; mediated foreign gene transformation and insertional mutagenesis. Plant genomes can be engineered by use of &quot;Agrobacterium&quot; for the delivery of sequences hosted in T-DNA binary vectors.

== Mechanism of transformation in nature ==
The infection process of T-DNA into the host cell and integration into its nucleus involve multiple steps. First, the bacteria multiply in the wound sap before infection and then attach to the plant cell walls. The bacterial virulence genes&#x27; expression of approximately 10 operons is activated by perception of phenolic compounds such as acetosyringone emitted by wounded plant tissue and follows cell-cell contact. Then this process proceeds with the macromolecular translocation from &quot;Agrobacterium&quot; to cytoplasm of host cell, transmission of T-DNA along with associated proteins (called T-complex) to the host cell nucleus followed by disassembly of the T-complex, stable integration of T-DNA into host plant genome, and eventual expression of the transferred genes. The integration of T-DNA into a host genome involves the formation of a single-stranded nick in the DNA at the right border of the Ti plasmid. This nick creates a region of single stranded DNA from the left border of the T-DNA gene over to the right border which was cut. Then, single stranded binding proteins attach to the single stranded DNA. DNA synthesis displaces the single stranded region and then a second nick at the left border region releases the single stranded T-DNA fragment. Further this fragment can be incorporated into a host genome.

&quot;Agrobacterium&quot; has been known to evolve a control system that uses plant host factors and cellular processes for several pathways of host-plant defense response to invade the host cell nucleus. For the integration of T-DNA into the target host genome, &quot;Agrobacterium&quot; carries out multiple interactions with host-plant factors. To interact with host plant proteins many &quot;Agrobacterium&quot; virulence proteins encoded by vir genes. &quot;Agrobacterium&quot; &quot;vir&quot; gene expression occurs via the VirA-VirG sensor that results in generation of a mobile single-stranded T-DNA copy (T-strand). A processed form of VirB2 is the major component of the T-complex that is required for transformation. VirD2 is the protein that caps the 5′ end of the transferred T-strand by covalent attachment and is transported to the host cell cytoplasm. VirE2 is the single-stranded DNA binding protein that presumably coats the T- strand in the host cytoplasm by cooperative binding. It is then directed into the nucleus via interactions with the host cell proteins such as importin a, bacterial VirE3, and dynein-like proteins. Several other bacterial virulence effectors like VirB5, VirB7 (the minor components of the T-complex), VirD5, VirE2, VirE3, and VirF that may also interact with proteins of host plant cells.

== Uses in biotechnology ==
&quot;Agrobacterium&quot;-mediated T-DNA transfer is widely used as a tool in biotechnology. For more than two decades, &quot;Agrobacterium tumefaciens&quot; has been exploited for introducing genes into plants for basic research as well as for commercial production of transgenic crops. In genetic engineering, the tumor-promoting and opine-synthesis genes are removed from the T-DNA and replaced with a gene of interest and/or a selection marker, which is required to establish which plants have been successfully transformed. Examples of selection markers include neomycin phosphotransferase, hygromycin B phosphotransferase (which both phosphorylate antibiotics) and phosphinothricin acetyltransferase (which acetylates and deactivates phosphinothricin, a potent inhibitor of glutamine synthetase) or a herbicide formulations such as Basta or Bialophos. Another selection system that can be employed is usage of metabolic markers such as phospho-mannose isomerase. &quot;Agrobacterium&quot; is then used as a vector to transfer the engineered T-DNA into the plant cells where it integrates into the plant genome. This method can be used to generate transgenic plants carrying a foreign gene. &quot;Agrobacterium tumefaciens&quot; is capable of transferring foreign DNA to both monocotyledons and dicotyledonous plants efficiently while taking care of critically important factors like the genotype of plants, types and ages of tissues inoculated, kind of vectors, strains of &quot;Agrobacterium&quot;, selection marker genes and selective agents, and various conditions of tissue culture.

The same procedure of T-DNA transfer can be used to disrupt genes via insertional mutagenesis. Not only does the inserted T-DNA sequence create a mutation but its insertion also &#x27;tags&#x27; the affected gene, thus allowing for its isolation as T-DNA flanking sequences. A reporter gene can be linked to the right end of the T-DNA to be transformed along with a plasmid replicon and a selectable antibiotic (such as hygromycin)-resistance gene and can explicit approximately 30% of average efficiency having successful T-DNA inserts induced gene fusions in &quot;Arabidopsis thaliana&quot;.

Reverse genetics involves testing the presumed function of a gene that is known by disrupting it and then looking for the effect of that induced mutation on the organismal phenotype. T-DNA tagging mutagenesis involves screening of populations by T-DNA insertional mutations. Collections of known T-DNA mutations provide resources to study the functions of individual genes, as developed for the model plant &quot;Arabidopsis thaliana&quot;. Examples of T-DNA insertion mutations in &quot;Arabidopsis thaliana&quot; include those associated many classes of phenotypes including seedling-lethals, size variants, pigment variants, embryo-defectives, reduced-fertility, and morphologically or physiologically aberrant plants.

<doc id="779825" wikidata="Q7797368" url="?curid=779825" title="Three Businessmen">
<text>Three Businessmen is a 1998 comedy film directed by Alex Cox and written by Tod Davies, who was also the producer. It is an international co-production between the United Kingdom, Netherlands, and United States. Two businessmen, played by Miguel Sandoval and Cox, wander Liverpool in search of a meal. After wandering through Liverpool, they end up at various locations throughout the world and are eventually joined by a third businessman, played by Robert Wisdom.

== Plot ==
Art dealers Benny (Miguel Sandoval) and Frank (Alex Cox) set out in Liverpool in search of a meal, and end up in a whirlwind trip around the Earth in search of food. After meeting businessman Leroy (Robert Wisdom) in the desert, they discover they are present at the birth of the new female Messiah... and promptly forget again.

== Production ==
In 1996, Dutch television producer Wim Kayzer contacted director Alex Cox and said he was looking for a project that fit the themes of &quot;beauty and consolation&quot;. After discussing various ideas with Kayzer, including thunderstorms, Cox turned to writer-producer Tod Davies, who had an existing idea about two couples who roam the world in search of a meal over the course of one night. The lead characters were written for Sandoval and Cox, though James Gandolfini was considered for the role of Benny. The story was inspired by &quot;The Discreet Charm of the Bourgeoisie&quot; and &quot;My Dinner with Andre&quot;. The film&#x27;s original title was &quot;Dad Has Left the Building&quot;, a reference to the film&#x27;s ending, in which a new messiah is born.

After securing around $250,000 in funding from Japanese investors, the Netherlands Film Fund, and Kayzer, they began shooting in March 1998. Locations included Liverpool, Rotterdam, Hong Kong, Tokyo, and Almería, Spain. The scenes set in the desert were initially planned to be shot in Mexico, but Cox wanted to keep costs down by not traveling to a third continent; he also cited the Biblical look of Almería.

The score by Dan Wool and Pray for Rain features Deborah Harry singing a techno version &quot;Ghost Riders in the Sky&quot;.

== Release ==
The film premiered at the Hamptons International Film Festival in October 1998. The international premiere was in 1999. Kayzer wanted the international premiere on Dutch television station VPRO, where he worked, and urged Cox to decline a spot at the Rotterdam Film Festival. The Rotterdam Film Fund, in turn, wanted Cox to take a position at the festival as a judge and to premiere his film there. Cox, caught between opposing obligations, chose to hold the international premiere at the festival. Upset, Kayzer lost interest in screening the film. The Rotterdam screening went poorly, which Cox attributed to audiences wanting a fast-paced, entertaining film like &quot;Repo Man&quot;, rather than a slower, philosophical film. Like most of Cox&#x27;s films, it received a limited theatrical release.

== Reception ==
Writing for &quot;Variety&quot;, Oliver Jones called it &quot;a dramatically turgid concept piece&quot; that nonetheless has a satisfying ending and good acting from Cox. Although criticizing the writing, Jones complimented Davies&#x27; producing. Brendan Boyle of PopMatters rated it 7/10 stars and compared it to city-symphony films, saying the focus is on abstraction. He cited the play &quot;Waiting for Godot&quot; and the film &quot;The Exterminating Angel&quot; as influences, calling &quot;Three Businessmen&quot; more humanistic. In &quot;Screening Early Modern Drama: Beyond Shakespeare&quot;, academic Pascale Aebischer described it as a critique of consumerism that was influenced by the Latin American film movement Third Cinema.

<text>The Kilburn White Horse is a hill figure cut into the hillside in the North York Moors National Park near Kilburn in North Yorkshire, England.

It is long by high and covers about and said to be the most northerly &quot;chalk&quot; hill figure in England.

Located on the southern flank of Sutton Bank, near Roulston Scar at the edge of the Hambleton table-land, it faces south-south-west and is visible from some distance, particularly from the East Coast Main Line railway south of Thirsk, and from the A19. On a clear day, the horse is visible from north Leeds, away on the higher ground to the west of the Vale of York.

Sutton Bank is formed of jurassic, limey sandstone and the horse was created by removing topsoil to expose that underlying rock, and covering it with white chalk chips.

It was created in November 1857, and some accounts state that it was done by schoolmaster John Hodgson and his pupils, together with local volunteers.

However, a tablet erected at the car park below it reads,
Morris Marples in his 1949 book also gives Thomas Taylor the credit for being the prime mover: a native of Kilburn, he was a buyer for a London provision merchant. He seems to have attended celebrations at the Uffington White Horse in 1857, and he was inspired to give his home village a similar example. Thirty-three men were involved in cutting it, and 6 tons (6.1 metric tonnes) of lime were used to whiten the exposed rock.

Nowadays a car park is provided below the white horse and there is a footpath ascending past it and crossing immediately above it. The image itself is now formed of off-white limestone chips, but the steep gradient of the hillside, especially at the horse&#x27;s breast and forelegs, have led to slumping and retention boards have been fixed to restrain this.

The cutting of the current Litlington White Horse in East Sussex during 1924, was inspired by the story of the Kilburn horse. 

The footpath offers a scenic view. The car park is located on a steeply graded minor road between Kilburn village and the Sutton Bank National Park Centre on the A170 road, and the best view of the white horse itself is from the Bagby road; benches are provided there to allow leisurely observation.

During World War II the horse was covered over to prevent it from becoming a conspicuous navigation landmark for enemy bombers.

This white horse can reputedly be seen from Julian&#x27;s Bower, Alkborough in North Lincolnshire, over away.


The horse featured in the launch video for Channel 3 North East, the rebranded version of regional ITV station Tyne Tees Television, in September 1996.

The horse was repainted in 2014. The Kilburn White Horse Association, run by volunteers, handed the site to Forestry England in 2018. In 2022, the horse was resprayed at a cost of £20,000.

<text>Nichita Stănescu (; born Nichita Hristea Stănescu; 31 March 1933 – 13 December 1983) was a Romanian poet and essayist.

==Biography==
Stănescu&#x27;s father was Nicolae Hristea Stănescu (1908–1982). His mother, Tatiana Cereaciuchin, was Russian (originally from Voronezh, she had fled Russia and married in 1931). Nichita Stănescu graduated from the Ion Luca Caragiale High School in Ploiești, then went on to study Romanian language and literature at the University of Bucharest, graduating in 1957. He made his literary debut in the &quot;Tribuna&quot; literary magazine.

Stănescu married Magdalena Petrescu in 1952, but the couple separated a year later. In 1962 he married Doina Ciurea. In 1982 he married Todorița &quot;Dora&quot; Tărâță.

For much of his career, Stănescu was a contributor to and editor of &quot;Gazeta Literară&quot;, &quot;România Literară&quot;, and &quot;Luceafărul&quot;.

His editorial debut was the poetry book &quot;Sensul iubirii&quot; (&quot;The Aim of Love&quot;), which appeared under the &quot;Luceafărul&quot; selection, in 1960. He also was the recipient of numerous awards for his verse, the most important being the Herder Prize in 1975 and a nomination for the Nobel Prize in 1980. The last volume of poetry published in his lifetime was &quot;Noduri și semne&quot; (&quot;Knots and Signs&quot;), published in 1982. A heavy drinker, he died of cardiopulmonary arrest. He is buried in Bucharest&#x27;s Bellu Cemetery.

<doc id="779833" wikidata="Q6869224" url="?curid=779833" title="Minoritarianism">
<text>In political science, minoritarianism (or minorityism) is a neologism for a political structure or process in which a minority group of a population has a certain degree of primacy in that population&#x27;s decision making, with legislative power or judicial power being held or controlled by a minority group rather than a majority that is representative of the population.

== Concept in depth ==
Minoritarianism is most often applied disparagingly to processes in which a minority is able to block legislative changes in the presence of supermajority threshold requirements. For example, if a two-thirds majority vote in favor is required to enact a new law, an opposing minority of greater than one-third is said to have &quot;minoritarian&quot; powers.

Even in the case where minority control is nominally limited to blocking the majority with veto power (whether as a result of a supermajority requirement or consensus decision-making), this may result in the situation where the minority retains effective control over the group&#x27;s agenda and the nature of the proposals submitted to the group, as the majority would be disinclined to propose ideas that they know the minority would veto.

Critics of this use of &quot;minoritarianism&quot; argue that the ability to block legislation is substantially different from the ability to enact new legislation against the will of the majority, making the analogy to unpopular &quot;dominant minority rule&quot; examples inappropriate.

Minoritarianism is sometimes used to describe rule by a dominant minority such as an ethnic group delineated by religion, language, or some other identifying factor.

Minoritarianism may also be used to describe some cases where appeasement of minorities by votebank politics is practiced. Examples include but are not limited to, Indian Muslims and Francophone Canadians.

== In small deliberative groups ==
Supermajority decision threshold requirements are often found in small deliberative groups where these requirements are sometimes adopted in an attempt to increase protection of varied interests within the group. The requirements may be formally stated or may be unstated (for example, when an organization is described as having a &quot;consensus culture&quot;).

A common criticism of consensus decision-making is that it can lead to a situation wherein a minority can block the will of the majority. Consensus advocates argue that this is a good feature—that &quot;no action&quot; is preferable to one without the consensus support of the group.

Attempts to resolve the dilemma through formal supermajority standards are generally discouraged by parliamentary authorities:
Some people have mistakenly assumed that the higher the vote required to take an action, the greater the protection of the members. Instead the opposite is true. Whenever a vote of more than a majority is required to take an action, control is taken from the majority and given to the minority. ... The higher the vote required, the smaller the minority to which control passes.
—from &quot;The Standard Code of Parliamentary Procedure&quot; by Alice Sturgis

== Dominant minority ==

A dominant minority, also called elite dominance, is a minority group that wields political, economic, or cultural dominance in a country, despite representing only a subset of the overall population (a demographic minority). Dominant minorities are also known as &quot;alien elites&quot; if they are recent immigrants.

The term is most commonly used to refer to an ethnic group which is defined along racial, national, religious, cultural or tribal lines and that holds a disproportionate amount of power.

== Examples of minoritarianism ==

=== Africa ===
Christians in Sierra Leone are an example of minoritarianism. As of 2020, they make up 21% of its population compared to 78% Muslims.

The Tutsi in Rwanda from 1884 to 1959 exerted minoritarian rule over the Hutu population.
==== Rhodesia ====
From 1965 to 1979, the government of Rhodesia (later renamed Zimbabwe) was controlled by a white minority. During this period, Black Rhodesians faced institutional discrimination and had limited rights compared to their White counterparts.
==== South Africa ====
South Africa was ruled by the apartheid regime from 1948 to 1994, wherein White South Africans wielded predominant control of the country although they were never more than 22% of the population. All non-white South Africans were subject to segregation and discriminatory laws, resulting in disparities in quality of life.
==== Liberia ====
In Liberia, African American-descended nationals (known as Americo-Liberians) settled in Liberia during the 19th century. Americo-Liberians were culturally disconnected from native Liberians, preferring Western-style wear, American food, Protestantism, and the English language. They formed an elite that ruled as a de facto one-party state under the True Whig Party (TWP). The 1980 Liberian coup d&#x27;état overthrew the TWP administration, ending Americo-Liberian minoritarian rule.

=== Asia ===
==== China ====
During the Imperial period of Chinese history, China experienced minoritarian rule in two separate instances. The Yuan dynasty was founded by Mongols, and ruled over the majority-Han population of China from 1271 to 1368.

The Qing dynasty took power of China in 1644 and ruled until 1912; this dynasty was formed by Manchus. Han Chinese were forced to assimilate to Manchu customs under the policy of &quot;Tifayifu&quot;, which demanded the Han people wear Manchu-syle clothing, and adopt the queue hairstyle.
==== Middle East ====
Sunni Arabs in Ba&#x27;athist Iraq, the Alawite minority in Ba&#x27;athist Syria, have also been cited as 20th-century and early-21st-century examples.
==== India ====
Non Hindu minorities in India have been seen as examples of minoritarianism as the Indian constitution enshrines special rights for religious minorities including cultural and economic rights under Article 30 and 31A that are denied to the Hindu majority. The minority also enjoys exemption from laws of the land like the  Right to Education  act.

<text>Tod Davies (born 1955) is an American writer, publisher and producer.

==Biography==
Davies was born and grew up in San Francisco, where she attended Convent of the Sacred Heart High School (California). She graduated from the University of California.

Davies&#x27;s screenplay credits include &quot;Three Businessmen&quot;, in which she also appears briefly as an actress; and as a co-writer for the screenplay of the adaptation of Hunter S. Thompson&#x27;s novel &quot;Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas&quot;. Although Davies&#x27;s husband Alex Cox did not direct the project, the Writers Guild of America twice determined that their script be credited.

She is the producer of &quot;Three Businessmen&quot; and &quot;Revengers Tragedy&quot;, the founder of Toxteth TV, an educational/media studio for young people, based in Liverpool, and the editor/publisher of the online magazine, Exterminating Angel Press. In 2005, she was Artist in Residence at St John&#x27;s College, Oxford, and is a member of the Senior Common Room there. In 2009, Exterminating Angel Press became an independent press and published three books including &quot;The Supergirls&quot; by Mike Madrid, and &quot;Jam Today&quot;, a cooking memoir &amp; the first book by Davies.

Davies published her first book of fiction, &quot;Snotty Saves the Day: The History of Arcadia&quot; in 2011. The second book of her History of Arcadia series, &quot;Lily the Silent&quot;, was released in 2012, both through Exterminating Angel Press. &quot;Publishers Weekly&quot; described &quot;Lily the Silent&quot; as an &quot;absorbing salute to the necessity and power of storytelling&quot;.

In 2014 she published her second book on cookery, &quot;Jam Today Too: The Revolution Will Not Be Catered&quot;, with 70 recipes and personal stories.

Davies is the wife of film director Alex Cox. She lives in Colestin, Oregon and Boulder, Colorado.

==Exterminating Angel Press==
Davies founded the independent book publisher, Exterminating Angel Press (EAP), which grew from an online art project started in 2005. EAP set out &quot;to challenge the received cultural narrative&quot;. They also include stories that bring out values of partnership, nurturing and finding a consensus rather than having one dominant point of view. By the Fall of 2013 EAP had published 13 books. Davies launched an Indiegogo fundraising campaign to raise $7,500 to continue her publishing venture.

<doc id="779842" wikidata="Q2915346" url="?curid=779842" title="Houses of the Molé">
<text>Houses of the Molé is the ninth studio album by American industrial metal band Ministry, released on June 21, 2004, by Sanctuary Records. It is noteworthy for being the first Ministry album not to feature bassist and longtime collaborator Paul Barker since &quot;Twitch&quot; (1986). It was also the first album to feature Mike Scaccia on guitar since 1996&#x27;s &quot;Filth Pig&quot;.

==Overview==
The album is the first part of the band&#x27;s anti-Bush trilogy, followed by &quot;Rio Grande Blood&quot; (2006) and &quot;The Last Sucker&quot; (2007). It was released in the run up to the 2004 American presidential elections, in the last few months of Bush&#x27;s first term as president. Nearly all songs start with the letter &quot;W&quot; in their title, except for &quot;No W&quot; and the hidden track &quot;Psalm 23&quot;. The first track on the album, &quot;No W&quot;, features numerous satirical samples of Bush&#x27;s speeches, particularly samples in which he spoke of his war on terror. Compared to its subsequent follow-ups, the musical style of the album is more thrash metal-oriented.

Al Jourgensen describes &quot;Houses of the Molé&quot; as a &quot;rebirth&quot; album as he started Ministry anew without long time collaborator Paul Barker who left after the &quot;Animositisomina&quot; tour due to a falling-out. In his autobiography, Jourgensen describes that he wrote &quot;Walrus&quot; as a way to &quot;celebrate&quot; Barker&#x27;s departure. In it, it has the words &quot;Paul is no longer with us&quot; played backwards on repeat.

Jourgensen has stated that the name &quot;Houses of the Molé&quot; is a tribute to Led Zeppelin&#x27;s 1973 album &quot;Houses of the Holy&quot;. Mole itself is a Mexican sauce made from chocolate that is nearly black in color, an image that Jourgensen believes represents crude oil.

Former Ministry drummer Rey Washam stated in an interview that he worked on &quot;Houses of the Molé&quot;, for which he received no credit, and also stated that Ministry had problems properly compensating all of the musicians who contributed to their records. He also referred to &quot;someone&quot; in Ministry as being a &quot;liar&quot; and &quot;full of shit&quot;, and disputed the statement and common belief that Al Jourgensen was solely responsible for writing almost all of Ministry&#x27;s material. He also said &quot;Houses of the Molé&quot; was &quot;the worst [album] title in the world&quot;.

This was the first Ministry studio album to not chart on the Billboard 200. Due to slow sales, the band left Sanctuary.

==Reception==

&quot;Houses of the Molé&quot; received generally positive reviews upon release, holding a 75/100 on review aggregate Metacritic.

Johnny Loftus of AllMusic credited the album for &quot;fully resurrect[ing]&quot; Jourgenson&#x27;s career. &quot;The Austin Chronicle&quot; gave the album a positive review, with reviewer Michael Chamy saying &quot;&quot;Houses of the Molé&quot; is signed, sealed, and delivered so powerfully that one can overlook the fact that it&#x27;s basically &quot;Psalm 69 or The Mind Is a Terrible Thing to Taste&quot; Part II. Playlouder called the album &quot;intense and angry&quot; and praised the use of soundbites.

&quot;Houses of the Molé&quot; also received some mixed reviews from critics. &quot;Q&quot; gave the album a mixed review, saying &quot;It&#x27;s [an album] whose tricks... we&#x27;ve heard done before.&quot; In its review, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; said &quot;the album is so densely noisy that you&#x27;ll need lots of patience to figure out whether Jourgensen is going on about politics, Armageddon or a hangnail.&quot;

In 2005, &quot;Houses of the Molé&quot; was ranked No. 434 in &quot;Rock Hard&quot; magazine&#x27;s book of &quot;The 500 Greatest Rock &amp; Metal Albums of All Time&quot;.

==Track listing==


The original release of &quot;Houses of the Molé&quot; featured &quot;Psalm 23&quot;, an alternate version of &quot;No W&quot;. Later releases feature a Redux version of &quot;No W&quot; (with the &quot;O Fortuna&quot; samples removed), dropped &quot;Psalm 23&quot;, and added another (hidden) track titled &quot;Bloodlines&quot;. &quot;Walrus&quot; is hidden track on track 69, just like their song &quot;Everybody&quot; on their 1999 album &quot;Dark Side of the Spoon&quot;. Every other track on the CD editions of the album consists of five seconds of silence.

<doc id="779847" wikidata="Q414491" url="?curid=779847" title="Cosmid">
<text>A cosmid is a type of hybrid plasmid that contains a Lambda phage &quot;cos&quot; sequence. Often used as cloning vectors in genetic engineering, cosmids can be used to build genomic libraries. They were first described by Collins and Hohn in 1978.
Cosmids can contain 37 to 52 (normally 45) kb of DNA, limits based on the normal bacteriophage packaging size. They can replicate as plasmids if they have a suitable origin of replication (ori): for example SV40 ori in mammalian cells, ColE1 ori for double-stranded DNA replication, or f1 ori for single-stranded DNA replication in prokaryotes. They frequently also contain a gene for selection such as antibiotic resistance, so that the transformed cells can be identified by plating on a medium containing the antibiotic. Those cells which did not take up the cosmid would be unable to grow.

Unlike plasmids, they can also be packaged in vitro into phage capsids, a step which requires &quot;cohesive ends&quot;, also known as &quot;cos&quot; sites also used in cloning with a lambda phage as a vector, however nearly all the lambda genes have been deleted with the exception of the &quot;cos&quot; sequence. The hybrid cosmid DNA in the capsids can then be transferred into bacterial cells by transduction. Since there is a requirement for in vitro packaging whereby at least 38 kb of DNA is required between the cos sites, the vector without insert DNA will not be packaged (plasmids instability is increased if the novel inserted DNA contains many direct repeats or palindromic (inverted repeats) DNA. This instability can largely be counteracted by using a host bacterium with specific mutations affecting DNA recombination (N.B. Absence of inverted repeats was noted in the first Hohn &amp; Collins publication cited above; see also).

==&quot;Cos&quot; sequences==
&quot;Cos&quot; sequences are ~200 base pairs long and essential for packaging. They contain a &quot;cosN&quot; site where DNA is nicked at each strand, 12 bp apart, by terminase. This causes linearization of the circular cosmid with two &quot;cohesive&quot; or &quot;sticky ends&quot; of 12bp. (The DNA must be linear to fit into a phage head.) The &quot;cosB&quot; site holds the terminase while it is nicking and separating the strands. The &quot;cosQ&quot; site of next cosmid (as rolling circle replication often results in linear concatemers) is held by the terminase after the previous cosmid has been packaged, to prevent degradation by cellular DNases.

==Cosmid features and uses==

Cosmids are predominantly plasmids with a bacterial &quot;oriV&quot;, an antibiotic selection marker and a cloning site, but they carry one, or more recently two, cos sites derived from bacteriophage lambda. Depending on the particular aim of the experiment, broad host range cosmids, shuttle cosmids or &#x27;mammalian&#x27; cosmids (linked to SV40 oriV and mammalian selection markers) are available. The loading capacity of cosmids varies depending on the size of the vector itself but usually lies around 40–45 kb. The cloning procedure involves the generation of two vector arms which are then joined to the foreign DNA. Selection against wild type cosmid DNA is simply done via size exclusion. Cosmids, therefore, always form colonies and not plaques. Also the clone density is much lower with around 105 – 106 CFU per μg of ligated DNA.

After the construction of recombinant lambda or cosmid libraries the total DNA is transferred into an appropriate &quot;E. coli&quot; host via a technique called in vitro packaging. The necessary packaging extracts are derived from &quot;E. coli&quot; cI857 lysogens (red- gam- Sam and Dam (head assembly) and Eam (tail assembly) respectively). These extracts will recognize and package the recombinant molecules &quot;in vitro&quot;, generating either mature phage particles (lambda-based vectors) or recombinant plasmids contained in phage shells (cosmids). These differences are reflected in the different infection frequencies seen in favour of lambda-replacement vectors. This compensates for their slightly lower loading capacity. Phage libraries are also stored and screened more easily than cosmid libraries.

Target DNA: the genomic DNA to be cloned has to be cut into the appropriate size range of restriction fragments. This is usually done by partial restriction followed by either size fractionation or dephosphorylation (using calf-intestine phosphatase) to avoid chromosome scrambling, i.e. the ligation of physically unlinked fragments.

==Examples of cosmid vectors==
Commonly used vectors include &quot;SuperCos 1&quot;

<text>Buprenorphine, sold under the brand name Subutex among others, is an opioid used to treat opioid use disorder, acute pain, and chronic pain. It can be used under the tongue (sublingual), in the cheek (buccal), by injection (intravenous and subcutaneous), as a skin patch (transdermal), or as an implant. For opioid use disorder, the patient must have moderate opioid withdrawal symptoms before buprenorphine can be administered under direct observation of a health-care provider.

In the United States, the combination formulation of buprenorphine/naloxone (Suboxone) is usually prescribed to discourage misuse by injection. However, more recently the efficacy of naloxone in preventing misuse has been brought into question, and preparations of buprenorphine combined with naloxone could potentially be less safe than buprenorphine alone. Maximum pain relief is generally within an hour with effects up to 24 hours. Buprenorphine affects different types of opioid receptors in different ways. Depending on the type of opioid receptor, it may be an agonist, partial agonist, or antagonist. Buprenorphine&#x27;s activity as an agonist/antagonist is important in the treatment of opioid use disorder: it relieves withdrawal symptoms from other opioids and induces some euphoria, but also blocks the ability for many other opioids, including heroin, to cause an effect. Unlike full agonists like heroin or methadone, buprenorphine has a ceiling effect, such that taking more medicine past a certain point will not increase the effects of the drug.
Side effects may include respiratory depression (decreased breathing), sleepiness, adrenal insufficiency, QT prolongation, low blood pressure, allergic reactions, constipation, and opioid addiction. Among those with a history of seizures, a risk exists of further seizures. Opioid withdrawal following stopping buprenorphine is generally less severe than with other opioids. Whether use during pregnancy is safe is unclear, but use while breastfeeding is probably safe, since the dose the infant receives is 1–2% that of the maternal dose, on a weight basis.
Buprenorphine was patented in 1965, and approved for medical use in the United States in 1981. It is on the World Health Organization&#x27;s List of Essential Medicines. In addition to prescription as an analgesic it is a common medication used to treat opioid use disorders, such as addiction to heroin. In 2020, it was the 186th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 2.8million prescriptions. Buprenorphine may also be used recreationally for the high it can produce. In the United States, buprenorphine is a schedule III controlled substance.
==Medical uses==
===Opioid use disorder===

Buprenorphine is used to treat people with opioid use disorder. In the U.S., the combination formulation of buprenorphine/naloxone is generally prescribed to deter injection, since naloxone, an opioid antagonist, is believed to cause acute withdrawal if the formulation is crushed and injected. Taken orally, the naloxone has virtually no effect, due to the drug&#x27;s extremely high first-pass metabolism and low bioavailability (2%). However, the efficacy of naloxone in preventing misuse by injection has as of 2020 been brought into question and preparations including naloxone could even be less safe than preparations containing solely buprenorphine. Anecdotally, posters on drug-related online forums have stated that they were able to attain a high by injecting preparations of buprenorphine despite being combined with naloxone. 

Before starting buprenorphine, individuals are generally advised to wait long enough after their last dose of opioid until they have some withdrawal symptoms to allow for the medication to bind the receptors, since if taken too soon, buprenorphine can displace other opioids bound to the receptors and precipitate an acute withdrawal. The dose of buprenorphine is then adjusted until symptoms improve, and individuals remain on a maintenance dose of 8–16 mg. 

Because withdrawal is uncomfortable and a deterrent for many patients, users have called for different means of treatment initiation. The Bernese method, also known as micro dosing was described in 2016, where very small doses of buprenorphine (0.2 to 0.5 mg) are given while patients are still using street opioids, and without precipitating withdrawal, with medicine levels slowly titrated upward. This method has been used by some providers as of the 2020s.

====Buprenorphine versus methadone====
Both buprenorphine and methadone are medications used for detoxification and opioid replacement therapy, and appear to have similar effectiveness based on limited data. Both are safe for pregnant women with opioid use disorder, although preliminary evidence suggests that methadone is more likely to cause neonatal abstinence syndrome. In the US and European Union, only designated clinics can prescribe methadone for opioid use disorder, requiring patients to travel to the clinic daily. If patients are drug-free for a period they may be permitted to receive &quot;take-home doses,&quot; reducing their visits to as little as once a week. Alternatively, up to a month&#x27;s supply of buprenorphine has been able to be prescribed by clinicians in the US or Europe who have completed basic training (8–24 hours in the US) and received a waiver/licence allowing the prescription of the medicine. In France, buprenorphine prescription for opioid use disorder has been permitted without any special training or restrictions since 1995, resulting in treatment of approximately ten times more patients per year with buprenorphine than with methadone in the following decade. In 2021, seeking to address record levels of opioid overdose, the United States also removed the requirement for a special waiver for prescribing physicians. Whether this change will be sufficient to impact prescription is unclear, since even before the change as many as half of physicians with a waiver permitting them to prescribe buprenorphine did not do so, and one-third of non-waivered physicians reported that nothing would induce them to prescribe buprenorphine for opioid use disorder.

===Chronic pain===
A transdermal patch is available for the treatment of chronic pain. These patches are not indicated for use in acute pain, pain that is expected to last only for a short period, or pain after surgery, nor are they recommended for opioid addiction.

===Potency===
For equianalgesic dosing, when used sublingually, the potency of buprenorphine is about 40 to 70 times that of morphine. When used as a transdermal patch, the potency of buprenorphine may be 100 to 115 times that of morphine.

==Adverse effects==

Common adverse drug reactions associated with the use of buprenorphine, similar to those of other opioids, include nausea and vomiting, drowsiness, dizziness, headache, memory loss, cognitive and neural inhibition, perspiration, itchiness, dry mouth, shrinking of the pupils of the eyes (miosis), orthostatic hypotension, male ejaculatory difficulty, decreased libido, and urinary retention. Constipation and central nervous system (CNS) effects are seen less frequently than with morphine. Central sleep apnea has also been reported as a side effect of long-term buprenorphine use.

===Respiratory effects===

The most severe side effect associated with buprenorphine is respiratory depression (insufficient breathing). It occurs more often in those who are also taking benzodiazepines or alcohol, or have underlying lung disease. The usual reversal agents for opioids, such as naloxone, may be only partially effective, and additional efforts to support breathing may be required. Respiratory depression may be less than with other opioids, particularly with chronic use. In the setting of acute pain management, though, buprenorphine appears to cause the same rate of respiratory depression as other opioids such as morphine. Central sleep apnea is possible with long-term use, possibly resolving with dose reduction.

===Buprenorphine dependence===
Buprenorphine treatment carries the risk of causing psychological or physiological (physical) dependencies. It has a slow onset of activity, with a long duration of action, and a long half-life of 24 to 60 hours. Once a patient has stabilised on the (buprenorphine) medication and programme, three options remain - continual use (buprenorphine-only medication), switching to a buprenorphine/naloxone combination, or a medically supervised withdrawal.

===Pain management===

Achieving acute opioid analgesia is difficult in persons using buprenorphine for pain management. However, a systematic review found no clear benefit to bridging or stopping buprenorphine when used in opioid substitution therapy to facilitate perioperative pain management, but failure to restart it was found to pose concerns for relapse. Therefore, it is recommended that buprenorphine opioid substitution therapy is continued in the perioperative period when possible. In addition, preoperative pain management in patients taking buprenorphine should use an interdisciplinary approach with multimodal analgesia.

==Pharmacology==

===Pharmacodynamics===
====Opioid receptor modulator====
Buprenorphine has been reported to possess these following pharmacological activities:

* μ-Opioid receptor (MOR): Very high affinity partial agonist: at low doses, the MOR-mediated effects of buprenorphine are comparable to those of other narcotics, but these effects reach a &quot;ceiling&quot; as the receptor population is saturated. This behavior is responsible for several unique properties: buprenorphine greatly reduces the effect of most other MOR agonists, can cause precipitated withdrawal when used in actively opioid dependent persons, and has a lower incidence of respiratory depression and fatal overdose relative to full MOR agonists.
* κ-Opioid receptor (KOR): High affinity antagonist/weak partial agonist —this activity is hypothesized to underlie some of the effects of buprenorphine on mood disorders and addiction.
* δ-Opioid receptor (DOR): High affinity antagonist
* Nociceptin receptor (NOP, ORL-1): Weak affinity, very weak partial agonist

In simplified terms, buprenorphine can essentially be thought of as a nonselective, mixed agonist–antagonist opioid receptor modulator, acting as an unusually high affinity, weak partial agonist of the MOR, a high affinity antagonist of the KOR and DOR, and a relatively low affinity, very weak partial agonist of the ORL-1/NOP.

Although buprenorphine is a partial agonist of the MOR, human studies have found that it acts like a full agonist with respect to analgesia in opioid-intolerant individuals. Conversely, buprenorphine behaves like a partial agonist of the MOR with respect to respiratory depression.

Buprenorphine is also known to bind to with high affinity and antagonize the putative ε-opioid receptor.

Full analgesic efficacy of buprenorphine requires both exon 11- and exon 1-associated μ-opioid receptor splice variants.

The active metabolites of buprenorphine are not thought to be clinically important in its CNS effects.

In positron emission tomography (PET) imaging studies, buprenorphine was found to decrease whole-brain MOR availability due to receptor occupancy by 41% (i.e., 59% availability) at 2 mg, 80% (i.e., 20% availability) at 16 mg, and 84% (i.e., 16% availability) at 32 mg.

====Other actions====
Unlike some other opioids and opioid antagonists, buprenorphine binds only weakly to and possesses little if any activity at the sigma receptor.

Buprenorphine also blocks voltage-gated sodium channels via the local anesthetic binding site, and this underlies its potent local anesthetic properties.

Similarly to various other opioids, buprenorphine has also been found to act as an agonist of the toll-like receptor 4, albeit with very low affinity.

===Pharmacokinetics===
Buprenorphine is metabolized by the liver, via CYP3A4 (also CYP2C8 seems to be involved) isozymes of the cytochrome P450 enzyme system, into norbuprenorphine (by &quot;N&quot;-dealkylation). The glucuronidation of buprenorphine is primarily carried out by UGT1A1 and UGT2B7, and that of norbuprenorphine by UGT1A1 and UGT1A3. These glucuronides are then eliminated mainly through excretion into bile. The elimination half-life of buprenorphine is 20 to 73 hours (mean 37 hours). Due to the mainly hepatic elimination, no risk of accumulation exists in people with renal impairment.

One of the major active metabolites of buprenorphine is norbuprenorphine, which, in contrast to buprenorphine itself, is a full agonist of the MOR, DOR, and ORL-1, and a partial agonist at the KOR. However, relative to buprenorphine, norbuprenorphine has extremely little antinociceptive potency (1/50th that of buprenorphine), but markedly depresses respiration (10-fold more than buprenorphine). This may be explained by very poor brain penetration of norbuprenorphine due to a high affinity of the compound for P-glycoprotein. In contrast to norbuprenorphine, buprenorphine and its glucuronide metabolites are negligibly transported by P-glycoprotein.

The glucuronides of buprenorphine and norbuprenorphine are also biologically active, and represent major active metabolites of buprenorphine. Buprenorphine-3-glucuronide has affinity for the MOR (Ki = 4.9 pM), DOR (Ki = 270 nM) and ORL-1 (Ki = 36 μM), and no affinity for the KOR. It has a small antinociceptive effect and no effect on respiration. Norbuprenorphine-3-glucuronide has no affinity for the MOR or DOR, but does bind to the KOR (Ki = 300 nM) and ORL-1 (Ki = 18 μM). It has a sedative effect but no effect on respiration.

==Chemistry==
Buprenorphine is a semisynthetic derivative of thebaine, and is fairly soluble in water, as its hydrochloride salt. It degrades in the presence of light.

===Detection in body fluids===
Buprenorphine and norbuprenorphine may be quantified in blood or urine to monitor use or non-medical recreational use, confirm a diagnosis of poisoning, or assist in a medicolegal investigation. A significant overlap of drug concentrations exists in body fluids within the possible spectrum of physiological reactions ranging from asymptomatic to comatose. Therefore, knowing both the route of administration of the drug and the level of tolerance to opioids of the individual is critical when results are interpreted.

==History==
In 1969, researchers at Reckitt and Colman (now Reckitt Benckiser) had spent 10 years attempting to synthesize an opioid compound &quot;with structures substantially more complex than morphine [that] could retain the desirable actions whilst shedding the undesirable side effects&quot;. Physical dependence and withdrawal from buprenorphine itself remain important issues since buprenorphine is a long-acting opioid. Reckitt found success when researchers synthesized RX6029 which had shown success in reducing dependence in test animals. RX6029 was named buprenorphine and began trials on humans in 1971. By 1978, buprenorphine was first launched in the UK as an injection to treat severe pain, with a sublingual formulation released in 1982.

==Society and culture==
===Regulation===
====United States====
In the United States, buprenorphine and buprenorphine with naloxone were approved for opioid use disorder by the Food and Drug Administration in October 2002. The DEA rescheduled buprenorphine from a schedule V drug to a schedule III drug just before approval. The ACSCN for buprenorphine is 9064, and being a schedule III substance, it does not have an annual manufacturing quota imposed by the DEA. The salt in use is the hydrochloride, which has a free-base conversion ratio of 0.928.

In the years before buprenorphine/naloxone was approved, Reckitt Benckiser had lobbied Congress to help craft the Drug Addiction Treatment Act of 2000, which gave authority to the Secretary of Health and Human Services to grant a waiver to physicians with certain training to prescribe and administer schedule III, IV, or V narcotic drugs for the treatment of addiction or detoxification. Before this law was passed, such treatment was permitted only in clinics designed specifically for drug addiction.

The waiver, which can be granted after the completion of an eight-hour course, was required for outpatient treatment of opioid addiction with buprenorphine from 2000 to 2021. Initially, the number of people each approved physician could treat was limited to 10. This was eventually modified to allow approved physicians to treat up to 100 people with buprenorphine for opioid addiction in an outpatient setting. This limit was increased by the Obama administration, raising the number of patients to which doctors can prescribe to 275. On 14 January 2021, the US Department of Health and Human Services announced that the waiver would no longer be required to prescribe buprenorphine to treat up to 30 people concurrently.

New Jersey authorized paramedics to give buprenorphine to people at the scene after they have recovered from an overdose.

====Europe====
In the European Union, Subutex and Suboxone, buprenorphine&#x27;s high-dose sublingual tablet preparations, were approved for opioid use disorder treatment in September 2006. In the Netherlands, buprenorphine is a list II drug of the Opium Law, though special rules and guidelines apply to its prescription and dispensation. In France, buprenorphine prescription by general practitioners and dispensed by pharmacies has been permitted since the mid-1990s as a response to HIV and overdose risk. Deaths caused by heroin overdose were reduced by four-fifths between 1994 and 2002, and the incidence of AIDS among people who inject drugs in France fell from 25% in the mid-1990s to 6% in 2010.

===Barriers to access===
In the US, the list price for a long-acting injectable form is five to 20 times as much as a daily pill. This has reduced the number of people who are able to get a single monthly dose, instead of daily pills. Some jails consider the more expensive form a positive tradeoff: a single monthly injection may be simpler and easier for the staff to manage than daily trips to the dispensary to have a nurse provide a pill and make sure that it has been swallowed.

===Brand names===
Buprenorphine is available under the brand names Cizdol, Brixadi (approved in the US by FDA for addiction treatment in 2023), Suboxone (with naloxone), Subutex (typically used for opioid use disorder), Zubsolv, Bunavail, Buvidal (approved in the UK, Europe and Australia for addiction treatment in 2018), Sublocade (approved in the US in 2018), Probuphine, Temgesic (sublingual tablets for moderate to severe pain), Buprenex (solutions for injection often used for acute pain in primary-care settings), Norspan, and Butrans (transdermal preparations used for chronic pain). In Poland buprenorphine is available under the trade names Bunondol (for pain treatment, when morphine is too little; amounts of 0.2mg and 0.4mg) and Bunorfin (for addicts substitution in amount of 2 and 8mg).

==Research==

===Microdosing===
There is some evidence that a buprenorphine microdosing regime, started before opioid withdrawal symptoms have started, can be effective in helping people transition away from opioid dependence.

===Depression===
Some evidence supports the use of buprenorphine for depression. Buprenorphine/samidorphan, a combination product of buprenorphine and samidorphan (a preferential μ-opioid receptor antagonist), appears useful for treatment-resistant depression.

A buprenorphine implant (developmental code name SK-2110) is under development by Shenzhen ScienCare Pharmaceutical in China for the treatment of refractory major depressive disorder.

===Cocaine dependence===
In combination with samidorphan or naltrexone (μ-opioid receptor antagonists), buprenorphine is under investigation for the treatment of cocaine dependence, and recently demonstrated effectiveness for this indication in a large-scale (n = 302) clinical trial (at a high buprenorphine dose of 16 mg, but not a low dose of 4 mg).

===Neonatal abstinence===
Buprenorphine has been used in the treatment of the neonatal abstinence syndrome, a condition in which newborns exposed to opioids during pregnancy demonstrate signs of withdrawal. In the United States, use currently is limited to infants enrolled in a clinical trial conducted under an FDA-approved investigational new drug (IND) application. Preliminary research suggests that buprenorphine is associated with shorter time in hospital for neonates, compared to methadone. An ethanolic formulation used in neonates is stable at room temperature for at least 30 days.

== Veterinary uses ==
Veterinarians administer buprenorphine for perioperative pain, particularly in cats, where its effects are similar to morphine. The drug&#x27;s legal status and lower potential for human abuse makes it an attractive alternative to other opioids.

It has veterinary medical use for treatment of pain in dogs and cats, as well as other animals.

<doc id="779851" wikidata="Q1063846" url="?curid=779851" title="Charles Burnett (director)">
<text>Charles Burnett (; born April 13, 1944) is an American film director, film producer, writer, editor, actor, photographer, and cinematographer. His most popular films include &quot;Killer of Sheep&quot; (1978), &quot;My Brother&#x27;s Wedding&quot; (1983), &quot;To Sleep with Anger&quot; (1990), &quot;The Glass Shield&quot; (1994), and &quot;&quot; (2007). He has also directed several short films and documentary films.

Burnett has been named as &quot;one of America&#x27;s very best filmmakers&quot; by the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; and &quot;the nation&#x27;s least-known great filmmaker and most gifted black director&quot; by &quot;The New York Times&quot;. He received an Academy Honorary Award from the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences for being an &quot;influential film pioneer who has chronicled the lives of black Americans with eloquence and insight&quot; in 2017.

==Early life and education ==
Burnett was born on April 13, 1944, in Vicksburg, Mississippi, to a nurse&#x27;s aide and a military father. According to a DNA analysis, he is mainly descended from people from Sierra Leone.
In 1947, Charles&#x27;s family moved to Watts, a largely black neighborhood in South Los Angeles. Burnett was interested in expressing himself through art from a young age, but the economic pressure to maintain a stable job kept him from pursuing film or art in college.

Watts had a significant effect on Burnett&#x27;s life and work. The community, which gained notoriety in 1965 when violent riots in the area caused the deaths of 34 people and injured more than 1,000, again made the news in 1992 when protestors turned to looting and arson following the acquittal of police officers tried for the beating of Rodney King. Burnett has said that the neighborhood had a strong Southern influence due to the large number of Southerners living in the area. Watts strongly influences his movies&#x27; subject matter, which often revolves around southern folklore mixed with modern themes. His film &quot;Killer of Sheep&quot; was set in Watts.

Burnett first enrolled at Los Angeles City College to study electronics in preparation for a career as an electrician. Dissatisfied, he took a writing class and decided that his earlier artistic ambitions needed to be explored and tested. He went on to earn a BA in writing and languages at the University of California, Los Angeles.

In an interview for &quot;Cahiers du Cinéma,&quot; Burnett speculated that &quot;a serious speech impediment&quot; may have led him to become a filmmaker: I always felt like an outsidean observerwho wasn&#x27;t able to participate because I couldn&#x27;t speak very well. So this inability to communicate must have led me...to find some other means to express myself...I really liked a lot of the kids I grew up with. I felt an obligation to write something about them, to explain what went wrong with them. I think that&#x27;s the reason I started to make these movies. Burnett continued his education at the UCLA film school, earning a Master of Fine Arts degree in theater arts and film. His experiences at UCLA had a profound influence on his work, and the students and faculty he worked with became his mentors and friends. Some fellow students include filmmaking greats like Larry Clark, Julie Dash, Haile Gerima, and Billy Woodberry. The students&#x27; involvement in each other&#x27;s films is highlighted by Burnett&#x27;s work as a cinematographer for Haile Gerima&#x27;s 1979 movie &quot;Bush Mama&quot;, as a crew member for Julie Dash&#x27;s 1982 &quot;Illusions&quot;, and as a writer and cameraman for Billy Woodberry&#x27;s &quot;Bless Their Little Hearts&quot;. His professors Elyseo Taylor, who created the department of Ethno-Communications, and Basil Wright, a British documentarian, also had a significant influence on his work. 

The turbulent social events of 1967 and 1968 were vital in establishing the UCLA filmmaking movement known as the &quot;Black Independent Movement”, in which Burnett was highly involved. The films of this group of African and African American filmmakers had strong relevance to the politics and culture of the 1960s, yet stayed true to the history of their people. Their characters shifted from the middle class to the working class to highlight the tension caused by class conflict within African American families. The independent writers and directors strayed away from the mainstream and won critical approval for remaining faithful to African American history. Another accomplishment of the Black Independent Movement and Burnett was the creation of the Third World Film Club. The club joined with other organizations in a successful campaign to break the American boycott banning all forms of cultural exchange with Cuba. Many critics have compared the films of the Black Independent Movement to Italian neorealist films of the 1940s, Third World Cinema films of the late 1960s and 1970s, and the 1990s Iranian New Wave. At the time the movement flourished, many countries in the Third World were involved in a struggle for revolution, inspiring them to create films expressing their own indigenous views of their history and culture. In addition to staying true to history, many Black Independent Movement films have been considered a response to Hollywood and Blaxploitation films that were popular at the time.

== Career==
Burnett&#x27;s earliest works include his UCLA student films made with friends, &quot;Several Friends&quot; (1969) and &quot;The Horse&quot; (1973), for which he was the director, producer, and editor. Burnett was involved in many shorts that include &quot;Several Friends&quot; (1969), &quot;The Horse&quot; (1973), &quot;When It Rains&quot; (1995), &quot;Olivia&#x27;s Story&quot; (2000), and &quot;Quiet as Kept&quot; (2007). &quot;When It Rains&quot; follows the story about a musician that tries to assist his friend with paying her rent. &quot;Quiet as Kept&quot; is a story about a relocated family after Hurricane Katrina.

=== 1978–1989: Film debut and breakthrough ===
Burnett&#x27;s first full-length feature film, &quot;Killer of Sheep&quot;, was his UCLA master&#x27;s thesis. It took Burnett five years to finish, apparently due to the imprisonment of one of the film&#x27;s actors, and was released to the public in 1978. The cast consisted mainly of his friends and film colleagues and it was filmed primarily with a handheld camera, seemingly in documentary style. The main character was played by Henry G. Sanders, a Vietnam veteran who had studied cinema at Los Angeles City College and was enrolled in several classes at UCLA. Sanders went on to a career in films and TV, including roles in &quot;Rocky Balboa&quot;, &quot;ER&quot;, &quot;Miami Vice&quot;, and &quot;The West Wing&quot;. The lead female character in &quot;Killer of Sheep&quot; was played by Kaycee Moore, who went on to act in former UCLA classmate Julie Dash&#x27;s film &quot;Daughters of the Dust&quot;. The story follows the protagonist Stan, a slaughterhouse worker, who struggles to make enough money to support his family. According to the film&#x27;s website, the movie “offers no solutions; it merely presents life”. &quot;Killer of Sheep&quot; revolves around rituals, in the family, childhood, oppression, and resistance to oppression. The soundtrack of ballads, jazz, and blues includes artists Faye Adams, Dinah Washington, Gershwin, Rachmaninov, Paul Robeson, and Earth Wind &amp; Fire. The film was only screened occasionally because of its poor 16mm print quality and failed to find widespread distribution due to the cost and complexity of securing music rights. It was restored by the UCLA Film &amp; Television archive in a new 35mm print of much higher quality. The re-released film won an array of awards including the critics&#x27; award at the Berlin International Film Festival, first place at the Sundance Film Festival in the 1980s, then called the USA Film Festival, and a Special Critics&#x27; Award from the 2007 New York Film Critics Circle. It was an inductee of the 1990 National Film Registry list. In addition, it was chosen as one of the 100 Essential Films of All Time by the National Society of Film Critics in 2002. Burnett was awarded a Guggenheim Foundation Fellowship in 1981, following the film&#x27;s completion.

Burnett served as the director, producer, director of photography, and screenwriter for &quot;My Brother&#x27;s Wedding&quot;. &quot;My Brother&#x27;s Wedding&quot; was his second full-length film, but was not released because of a mixed review in &quot;The New York Times&quot; after playing at the New Directors/New Films Festival in 1983. As in &quot;Killer of Sheep&quot;, many of the film&#x27;s actors were amateurs, including the costume designer&#x27;s wife. The role of Pierce Mundy, the protagonist, was played by Everett Silas. Mundy struggles to choose between his brother&#x27;s middle-class existence and his best friend&#x27;s working-class world. The movie was the first feature Burnett shot on 35mm color film. Its cost was estimated at $80,000. The movie was acquired by Milestone Films, restored by the Pacific Film Archive at the University of California, Berkeley, and digitally reedited by Burnett.

=== 1990–1999: Established work === 
&quot;To Sleep with Anger&quot; was Burnett&#x27;s first higher-budget film, with an estimated cost of $1.4 million. The grant he received from the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation helped Burnett support his family while working on the film. The $250,000 grant spread over the course of five years is awarded to gifted individuals to pursue personal projects. The movie was set in South Central LA and followed the same themes of family and southern folklore as most of his films. The story concerns a lower middle class Los Angeles family that welcomes a guest from the South who overstays his welcome and causes a major disturbance in the family. The family&#x27;s instability seems to reflect the larger community&#x27;s volatility. &quot;To Sleep with Anger&quot; was Burnett&#x27;s first film to feature professional actors. The lead actors include Danny Glover, Paul Butler, Mary Alice, Carl Lumbly, and Vonetta McGee. Glover, who plays Harry Mention, agreed to a reduced fee and went on to invest in the production. A box-office favorite known for his role in the Lethal Weapon films, Glover continued to star in many successful productions including &quot;The Royal Tenenbaums&quot;, &quot;Dreamgirls&quot;, &quot;2012&quot;, and &quot;Death at a Funeral&quot;. Although highly acclaimed by critics, &quot;To Sleep with Anger&quot; did poorly at the box office. Burnett attributes this to poor distribution and lack of good taste. The film won many awards, including best screenplay from the National Society of Film Critics (the first award of its kind given to an African American writer). Other awards include two Independent Spirit Awards for Best Director and Best Screenplay, the American Film Institute&#x27;s Maya Deren Award, the Special Jury Recognition Award at the 1990 Sundance Film Festival, a Special Award from the Los Angeles Film Critics Association, and nominations for Burnett and Glover by the New York Film Critics Association.

&quot;The Glass Shield&quot; follows a story of corruption and racism in the Los Angeles County Sheriff&#x27;s Department. It was Burnett&#x27;s first film catering to a wider audience, featuring Ice Cube, the rap artist, as a man wrongfully convicted of murder. The protagonist of the movie, JJ Johnson, is played by Michael Boatman. The movie&#x27;s themes include a strong emphasis on the powerlessness of its African American characters and female characters. Johnson&#x27;s fellow Sheriff&#x27;s Deputy, the first woman at the station, is forced to deal with sexism both within the Sheriff&#x27;s department and on the streets. The Deputy is played by Lori Petty, who went on to become a director in the 2008 movie The Poker House. &quot;The Glass Shield&quot; was nominated for a Golden Leopard award at the 1994 Festival del film Locarno. It grossed approximately $3,000,000 in the U.S.

&quot;Oprah Winfrey Presents: The Wedding&quot; (1998) was directed by Burnett, with Oprah Winfrey as an executive producer. Halle Berry and Carl Lumbly star in this drama surrounding the wedding of a wealthy African American woman and a poor white musician. &quot;Selma, Lord, Selma&quot;, a Disney movie, follows the story of a young girl inspired by Martin Luther King Jr. who decides to join the historic protest march from Selma to Montgomery. &quot;Selma, Lord, Selma&quot; was nominated for a Humanitas Prize in 1999 and an Image Award from Image Awards in 2000. &quot;Finding Buck McHenry&quot; is about a young boy who tries to discover whether his baseball coach is a former legend in baseball. &quot;Finding Buck McHenry&quot; won a Daytime Emmy in 2001, a Silver Award from WorldFest Houston in 2000, and a Young Artists Award in 2001, and was nominated for an Image Award in 2001. &quot;Relative Stranger&quot; was nominated for an Emmy in 2009, an Image Award in 2010, and a Vision Award from NAMIC Vision Awards in 2010.

=== 2000–present ===
Burnett has made many documentaries including &quot;America Becoming&quot; (1991), &quot;Dr. Endesha Ida Mae Holland&quot; (1998), &quot;Nat Turner: A Troublesome Property&quot; (2003), &quot;For Reel?&quot; (2003), and &quot;Warming by the Devil&#x27;s Fire&quot; (2003) which was part of a TV series called &quot;The Blues&quot;. &quot;America Becoming&quot; was a made-for-television documentary financed by the Ford Foundation. The documentary concentrated on ethnic diversity in America, especially the relations between recent immigrants and other racial groups. &quot;Dr. Endesha Ida Mae Holland&quot; was a short documentary about a civil rights activist, playwright, and professor who fought hard to overcome obstacles caused by racism and injustice. &quot;Nat Turner: A Troublesome Property&quot; featured Burnett&#x27;s actor and friend Carl Lumbly. The movie won a Cinematography Award in 2003 from the Long Beach International Film Festival. &quot;Warming by the Devil&#x27;s Fire&quot; was an episode for Martin Scorsese&#x27;s six-part compilation PBS documentary. Burnett worked as a producer for the documentary &quot;For Reel?&quot;.

Burnett has directed many made-for-television movies, including &quot;Nightjohn&quot; (1996), &quot;Oprah Winfrey Presents: The Wedding&quot; (1998), &quot;Selma, Lord, Selma&quot; (1999), &quot;Finding Buck McHenry&quot; (2000), and &quot;Relative Stranger&quot; (2009). &quot;Nightjohn&quot; was adapted from a Gary Paulsen novel, and went on to premiere on the Disney Channel in 1996 to high praise. The story follows an escaped slave who learns to read and returns to his former home to teach others to read and write. &quot;Nightjohn&quot; was awarded the Vision Award of the NAMIC Vision Awards in 1997 and a Special Citation Award from the National Society of Film Critics in 1998, and was nominated for a Young Artist Award by the Young Artists Awards in 1997. 

In 1999, Burnett directed a film called &quot;The Annihilation of Fish&quot;. The film is an interracial romance film starring James Earl Jones and Lynn Redgrave that won the Jury Award from the Newport Beach Film Festival in 2001, the Audience Award at the Sarasota Film Festival in 2001, and a Silver Award at WorldFest Houston in 2000. Burnett and two other directors, Barbara Martinez Jitner and Gregory Nava, directed the television series &quot;American Family&quot;. &quot;American Family&quot; was nominated for 2 Emmys and a Golden Globe Award and won many other awards. Burnett also acted in the documentary &quot;Pierre Rissient: Man of Cinema&quot; with Clint Eastwood. He is currently in pre-production on two films projects: &quot;The Emir Abd El-Kadir&quot; and &quot;83 Days: The Murder of George Stinney.&quot;

&quot;&quot; follows the story of Namibia&#x27;s hardships while attempting to win independence from South African rule. The film is based loosely on the memoirs of Namibia&#x27;s first president, Sam Nujoma, the former leader of the South West Africa People&#x27;s Organization SWAPO. The script was based on Nujoma&#x27;s autobiography, &quot;Where Others Wavered&quot;, and was reported to be a government-commissioned celebration of liberation. Both main actors in the movie, Carl Lumbly and Danny Glover, participated in Burnett&#x27;s prior films, with Lumbly and Glover both appearing in &quot;To Sleep with Anger&quot;. The movie was filmed in Namibia and casting was especially difficult because the over 200 speaking parts were mostly given to local Namibians, many of whom had differing dialects. The film was an opening-night selection at the 2008 New York African Film Festival.

In January 2019, it was announced that Burnett would direct the film &quot;Steal Away&quot;, based on Robert Smalls&#x27;s escape from slavery.

==Recurring themes==
The recurring themes in Charles Burnett&#x27;s work were primarily history&#x27;s effect on the structure of family. He also strived to make films about working-class African-Americans that denounced stereotypes and clichés. Burnett has told critics that he makes films that deal with emotions coming out of real problems like maturity and self-identity. He also found a recurring theme in liberation and struggle perhaps after the influence from the UCLA&#x27;s Third World Film Club that championed the revolutions occurring worldwide in the 1960s and 1970s.

== Awards and nominations ==
In 1988 Burnett won a MacArthur Fellowship for his work as an independent filmmaker.

Burnett earned the Freedom in Film Award from the First Amendment Center and the Nashville Independent Film Festival. The award was given to Burnett to honor his commitment to presenting cultural and historical content that he felt needed to be discussed, rather than focusing on commercial success. Burnett was honored by the Film Society of Lincoln Center and the Human Rights Watch International Film Festival in 1997. In addition, Burnett was presented grants by the Rockefeller Foundation, the National Endowment for the Arts, and the J.P. Getty Foundation. The prestigious Howard University&#x27;s Paul Robeson Award was given to Burnett for achievement in cinema. To honor his achievements, the mayor of Seattle declared February 20, 1997, Charles Burnett Day.

In September 2017 it was announced that Burnett was to receive a Governors Award – known as an &quot;honorary Oscar&quot; – from the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences.

==Personal life==
Burnett is married to actress and costume designer Gaye Shannon-Burnett. They have two sons, Steven and Jonathan.

<text>Acraman impact structure is a deeply eroded impact crater in the Gawler Ranges of South Australia. Its location is marked by Lake Acraman, a circular ephemeral playa lake about in diameter. The discovery of the impact structure and independent discovery of its ejecta were first reported in the journal Science in 1986 by George E. Williams. The evidence for impact includes the presence of shatter cones and shocked quartz in shattered bedrock on islands within Lake Acraman.

The impact structure is deeply eroded, and its original size must be inferred by indirect means. Some authors estimate an original diameter of up to , while other suggest a smaller size, perhaps only , closer to that of the depression in which Lake Acraman is centred. The larger size estimate would imply an energy release of 5.2 × 106 megatons of TNT.

The impact event is estimated to have occurred about 590 million years ago during the Ediacaran; this age is not derived from the crater itself but from the position of ejecta within nearby sedimentary basins.

The Lake Acraman Impact Structure is listed on the South Australian Heritage Register.

== Ejecta layer ==
A widespread layer of ejecta, believed to be from the Acraman impact structure, is found within Ediacaran rocks of the Flinders Ranges at least east of the crater, and in drill holes from the Officer Basin to the north. At the time these areas were shallow sea, and the ejecta settled into mud on the sea floor. The ejecta, containing shocked minerals and small shatter cones, is composed of rock similar in age and composition to that at the crater, and is associated with an iridium anomaly suggesting contamination with extraterrestrial material. An evolutionary radiation within marine microorganisms (acritarchs) occurs just above the level as the ejecta layer, and some authors believe there may be a connection. The proximity of the crater to the type area for the Ediacara Biota is noted, though probably not significant given the likely global consequences of the impact.

==John Acraman==
The Acraman impact structure, Lake Acraman and the nearby Acraman Creek are named after South Australia Colonial businessman John Acraman.

<doc id="779856" wikidata="Q655137" url="?curid=779856" title="Independence/Democracy">
<text>Independence/Democracy (IND/DEM) was a Eurosceptic political group that operated in the European Parliament between 2004 and 2009. At its height in 2004, it had 37 MEPs and it only existed during the European Parliament&#x27;s 6th term. It was affiliated with the Eurosceptic Europeans United for Democracy party.

Ideologically, IND/DEM was strongly opposed to the European Union and positioned on the radical right within the right-wing spectrum. It was a very heterogeneous grouping; it also included parties such as the UK Independence Party, Greek Popular Orthodox Rally, French Movement for France, League of Polish Families, and Lega Nord. After the 2009 European Parliament election, IND/DEM lost many of its MPs and was dissolved in favour of the Europe of Freedom and Democracy (EFD). In comparison, EFD was far-right group that was nationalist and more strongly opposed immigration than IND/DEM.

==History==
The 2004 European Parliament elections were reported as a good result for Eurosceptic parties. 37 MEPs (33 on 20 July, with four more the next day) from the UK Independence Party (UKIP), June Movement (Denmark), Movement for France (France), Northern League (Italy), ChristianUnion – Reformed Political Party (Netherlands), Popular Orthodox Rally (Greece), June List (Sweden), Independent Democrats (Czech Republic), the League of Polish Families (Poland) and an Independent MEP from the Republic of Ireland, joined in the first week of the new Parliament to form the Eurosceptic group called &quot;Independence/Democracy&quot; (IND/DEM), succeeding the group called &quot;Europe of Democracies and Diversities&quot; (EDD) that had existed during the European Parliament&#x27;s 1999–2004 term.

In the first week, IND/DEM assigned a UKIP MEP to the Committee on Women&#x27;s Rights and Gender Equality. The MEP, Godfrey Bloom, promptly made comments including &quot;No self-respecting small businessman with a brain in the right place would ever employ a lady of child-bearing age&quot; and &quot;I am here to represent Yorkshire women who always have dinner on the table when you get home. I am going to promote men&#x27;s rights.&quot; The remarks engendered outrage from a range of fellow politicians.

One UKIP MEP never made it to IND/DEM. MEP Ashley Mote was expelled from UKIP prior to IND/DEM&#x27;s formation when it became known that he faced charges for housing benefit fraud. Mote went on to join the far-right Identity, Tradition, Sovereignty group before being convicted in 2007.

The Northern League MEPs eventually all left the group after their expulsion from IND/DEM following an incident involving a T-shirt and the Jyllands-Posten Muhammad cartoons controversy. MEPs from the League of Polish Families also left the group, although not all and not all at once.
After having been suspended from UKIP following his arrest on fraud allegations, MEP Tom Wise left IND/DEM in June 2008.

By 24 June 2008, IND/DEM had 22 MEPs.

After the 2009 European Parliament elections, 18 IND/DEM MEPs from four Member States were elected for the 2009–2014 term (the Seventh European Parliament). The great majority of these seats (thirteen) were from the UK Independence Party, with others being two from the ChristianUnion – Reformed Political Party of the Netherlands, two from the Popular Orthodox Rally of Greece, and one from Libertas France. But that didn&#x27;t meet the threshold laid down in the European Parliament&#x27;s Rules of Procedure. So when the Seventh European Parliament started on 14 July 2009, IND/DEM would not qualify as a group.

On 30 June 2009, it was reported the remnants of IND/DEM were to unite with the remnants of another collapsing group, Union for a Europe of Nations (UEN), to create a new group whose official name was not yet determined.

On 1 July 2009 a press conference was held launching the new group. That press conference named the new group &quot;Europe of Freedom and Democracy&quot;. IND/DEM had ceased to exist.

==Structure==

===Subgroups===
IND/DEM was a coalition of MEPs from two distinct wings of Euroscepticism: a reformist subgroup (sometimes referred to as &quot;Eurorealists&quot;) made up of those MEPs who believed that the EU was essentially desirable if reformed and who supported greater transparency and control over the EU bureaucracy, and a secessionist subgroup consisting of those MEPs (notably UKIP) who believed that the EU was inherently wrong even if reformed and who advocated withdrawal from the EU.

===Organisation===
IND/DEM had a joint political leadership. The group&#x27;s co-chairs were Nigel Farage (UKIP) and Hanne Dahl, the latter succeeding Kathy Sinnott, who in turn succeeded long-time MEP Jens-Peter Bonde (June Movement) on his retirement in May 2008. Farage represented the secessionist subgroup, and Sinnott the reformist subgroup. The leadership was loose, enabling the two subgroups to unite around the broad principles of democracy and transparency which were embodied in its statute and to which IND/DEM MEPs were expected to adhere. The day-to-day running of the group was performed by its secretariat, and its secretaries-general were Claudine Vangrunderbeeck and Herman Verheirstraeten.

==Membership==

===11 June–1 July 2009===

After the 2009 European Parliament elections, 18 IND/DEM MEPs (too few for a viable group) were elected as follows:

===24 July 2008–11 June 2009===
IND/DEM member parties as of 24 July 2008 were as follows:
===Membership by country at December 2007===

A December 2007 European Parliament document considered the groups. Page 9 of that document had a table. That table gave the number of MEPs for each group and member state at December 2007. That table&#x27;s data for IND/DEM is depicted as percentages in the diagram on the right.

Such support for IND/DEM as was expressed came from Northern European states, with especial reference to the member states of the North-West. Its strongholds were Sweden and Denmark, who sent &quot;June list&quot; MEPs from June List and June Movement to the Parliament, and the United Kingdom, with 13% of its MEPs at December 2007 coming from UKIP and sitting with IND/DEM. As of December 2007 no member state had more than 13% of its MEPs sitting with IND/DEM and eighteen member states (Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Cyprus, Estonia, Finland, Germany, Hungary, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, Portugal, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain) had none.

===Parliamentary activity profile===

The debates and votes in the European Parliament are tracked by its website and categorised by the Groups that participate in them and the rule of procedure that they fall into. The results give a profile for each Group by category and the total indicates the Group&#x27;s level of participation in Parliamentary debates. The activity profile for each Group for the period 1 August 2004 to 1 August 2008 in the Sixth European Parliament is given on the diagram on the right. IND/DEM is denoted in orange.

The website shows IND/DEM as participating in 43 motions, making it one of the most inactive Groups during the period.

===Publications===
IND/DEM publications included the Prague Declaration of October 2005, which restated their disapproval of the Constitution Treaty and belief that the values it embodied should not be resurrected, and the Delphi Declaration of July 2007, which made similar points concerning the Treaty of Lisbon. IND/DEM also published a newsletter called EU Watch, which gave a eurosceptic view on the EU activities of the day.

<text>Ames crater is a meteorite crater (astrobleme) in Major County, Oklahoma, United States. Ames, Oklahoma is near the center of the structure, which is southwest of Enid, Oklahoma. Buried under a thick layer of sediment, it was not discovered until 1991. Subsequent drilling within the crater found a large amount of oil and gas. It is one of the largest of six meteor craters associated with oil-producing formations in the United States.

== Crater description ==

Ames Crater is in diameter and the age is estimated to be 470 ± 30 million years (Ordovician). The crater is not exposed at the surface.
It may be one of several Middle Ordovician meteors that fell roughly simultaneously 469 million years ago, part of a proposed Ordovician meteor event, including the Decorah crater in Iowa, the Slate Islands crater in Lake Superior, and the Rock Elm crater in Wisconsin.

The crater&#x27;s origin has been postulated as meteorite impact, volcanic activity, dissolution collapse and other causes. Geomorphology, rock textures, mineralogies and stratigraphic arguments have been used to support impact origin.

== Discovery ==
When the meteor struck, this part of the Earth was covered by a shallow sea. The object, traveling at an estimated speed of , created a crater in the Earth&#x27;s crust. This created enormous pressures below the point of impact, which made the remnant of the meteorite recoil slightly, creating an uplift. The sea returned and over eons, deposited layers of sediment. Other geological movements tilted the formation slightly. The sea eventually disappeared, leaving the crater buried in the earth, invisible from the surface. It was discovered by Rex Olson in 1991 as he was studying a map generated using data from seismic tests. Olson, an exploration manager for Continental Resources, saw a seismic pattern that resembled a hoof print, or &quot;a cow track in the mud&quot;. Showing the map to Harold Hamm, owner and chief executive officer (CEO) of the company, he pointed out what appeared to be an anomaly or &quot;glitch&quot; in the data. The two agreed that the anomaly resembled an astrobleme, a term meaning &quot;star wound.&quot;

An unknown number of concealed impact sites have been discovered. Some have produced uranium, gold or diamonds. Prior to 1991, geologists were skeptical that worthwhile quantities of oil and gas could be found at such a site.

== Oil and gas production ==
The Ames Crater is covered by about of sediment, so it is not visible from the surface. It was discovered only in 1991. Prior to its discovery, many geologists believed that impact craters were unlikely to contain petroleum. Wells had been drilled near the crater site since the 1960s, but none had been drilled within the crater. However, Continental Resources drilled deep into the crater. The well struck oil at a depth that initially produced about .

The crater penetrated the Arbuckle Dolomite which resulted in vast amounts of oil and gas becoming accessible in the fractured rock. There were even rumors that the impact might have created diamonds. But no evidence of that was found. Iridium was also not found although it is used to identify astroblemes elsewhere.

At least 60 wells have been drilled in Ames Crater since 1991. About 30 of the original wells were still producing in 2007. According to an article published by the American Oil &amp; Gas Historical Society (AOGHS), Ames had produced over of oil and of natural gas, making it the largest of the six producing astroblemes in the United States.

<text>The Battle of Gravelotte (or Battle of Gravelotte–St. Privat) on 18 August 1870 was the largest battle of the Franco-Prussian War. Named after Gravelotte, a village in Lorraine, it was fought about west of Metz, where on the previous day, having intercepted the French army&#x27;s retreat to the west at the Battle of Mars-la-Tour, the Prussians were now closing in to complete the destruction of the French forces.

The combined German forces under King Wilhelm I were the Prussian First and Second Armies of the North German Confederation with 210 infantry battalions, 133 cavalry squadrons, and 732 heavy cannons totaling 188,332 officers and men. The French Army of the Rhine, commanded by Marshal François Achille Bazaine, dug in along high ground with their southern left flank at the town of Rozerieulles, and their northern right flank at St. Privat.

On 18 August, the Prussian First Army under General Karl Friedrich von Steinmetz launched its VII and VIII Corps in repeated assaults against the French positions, backed by artillery and cavalry support. All attacks failed with enormous casualties in the face of French infantry and &quot;mitrailleuse&quot; firepower. The French did not counter-attack Steinmetz&#x27;s weakened army. On the Prussian left, the Prussian Guards attacked the French position at St. Privat at 16:50 hours. With the support of the Prussian II and Saxon XII Corps of Prince Friedrich Karl&#x27;s Second Army, the Guards conquered St. Privat by 20:00 hours after heavy losses, pushing back the French right wing.

Bazaine&#x27;s Army of the Rhine withdrew into Metz fortress on the morning of 19 August. The German victory at Gravelotte ended Bazaine&#x27;s army&#x27;s last chance of retreating west to Verdun. After a siege lasting over two months, the Army of the Rhine surrendered on 27 October 1870.

==Background==
The German Second Army, commanded by Prince Friedrich Karl of Prussia had met the right wing of the French Army of the Rhine, commanded by Marshal Bazaine, at the Battle of Mars-La-Tour both sides claimed victory. Marshal Bazaine&#x27;s four corps of the French Army of the Rhine retreated in vile weather along the road toward Verdun. The Germans were on their heels, pressing hard to prevent the Army of the Rhine from linking up with French forces at Sedan.

The pursuing Prussian First and Second Armies had more artillery, men, and ammunition than Bazaine&#x27;s four corps. Their pressure forced Bazaine to occupy the crests of the gently rolling hilltops east of the Moselle, with his southern left flank at the town of Rozerieulles, and his northern right flank at St. Privat. They lacked efficient digging tools, but Bazaine regarded the position as virtually impregnable, with the defenders sheltered behind hedges and low walls and anchored in villages and farmhouses.

The battlefield extended from the woods bordering the Moselle above Metz to Roncourt, near the river Orne. Other villages that played an important part in the battle were Saint Privat, Amanweiler or Amanvillers and Sainte-Marie-aux-Chênes, all lying to the north of Gravelotte.

==Battle==

The French cavalry failed to detect the strength of the Prussian pursuit. On 18 August at 08:00 Wilhelm I, whose chief of staff was Moltke, ordered the First and Second Armies to advance against the French positions. By 12:00, General Manstein with artillery from the Hessian 25th Infantry Division was advancing toward the village of Amanvillers. The mass of advancing Germans was met with murderous fire from the superior French &quot;Chassepot&quot; rifle and their rapid-firing &quot;mitrailleuses&quot;, before they were within range to retaliate with their shorter-ranged needle-guns. At 14:30, General Steinmetz, the commander of the First Army, launched his VIII Corps across the Mance Ravine but they were soon pinned down by rifle and &quot;mitrailleuse&quot; fire. At 15:00, the massed new Krupp all-steel breech-loading guns of the German VII and VIII Corps opened fire to support the attack. But with the attack still failing, at 16:00 Steinmetz ordered the VII Corps forward, followed by the 1st Cavalry Division.
At 16:50, with the Prussian southern attacks stalling, the Prussian 3rd Guards Infantry Brigade of the Second Army opened an attack against the French positions at St. Privat, which were commanded by Marshal Canrobert. At 17:15, the Prussian 4th Guards Infantry Brigade joined the advance followed at 17:45 by the Prussian 1st Guards Infantry Brigade. All of the Prussian Guard attacks were pinned down on the slopes by lethal French gunfire. At 18:00 King William ordered a renewed advance. At 18:15 the Prussian 2nd Guards Infantry Brigade, the last of the 1st Guards Infantry Division, was committed to the attack on St. Privat, while Steinmetz ordered the last unit in the reserves of the First Army across the Mance Ravine. By 18:30, a considerable portion of the VII and VIII Corps panicked and disengaged from the fighting without attaining their objective and withdrew towards the Prussian positions at Rezonville.

With the partial withdrawal of the First Army, Prince Frederick Charles ordered a mass artillery barrage against Canrobert&#x27;s position at St. Privat to prevent the Guards attack from failing too. At 19:00 the 3rd Division of Eduard von Fransecky&#x27;s II Corps of the Second Army advanced across Ravine while the Saxon XII Corps cleared out the nearby town of Roncourt, along with the survivors of the 1st Guards Infantry Division, launched a fresh attack against the ruins of St. Privat. At 20:00, the arrival of the Prussian 4th Infantry Division of the II Corps and with the Prussian right flank on Mance Ravine, the line stabilized. Then, the Prussians of the 1st Guards Infantry Division and the XII and II Corps captured St. Privat, forcing the decimated French forces to withdraw. Some French officers incorrectly thought the Prussians were exhausted, so they urged a counter-attack. General Bourbaki, however, refused to commit the reserves of the French Old Guard to the battle because, by that time, he rightfully considered the overall situation a &#x27;defeat&#x27; having run out of ammunition, being outflanked by Prussian artillery, and losing 1/4 of his men. By 22:00, firing largely died down across the battlefield for the night.

==Aftermath==

The next morning, the exhausted French Army of the Rhine retreated to Metz where they were besieged and forced to surrender two months later.

===Analysis===
The battle was a Prussian victory in that it succeeded in blocking Bazaine&#x27;s way to Verdun. In a short time the Prussians trapped Bazaine in the city and the siege of Metz ensued.

===Casualties===
The casualties were severe. The combined Prussian and Hessian force had 20,163 troops killed, wounded or missing in action during the 18 August battle. The French losses were 1,146 killed along with 6,709 wounded and 4,420 prisoners of war (half of these were wounded) for a total of 12,275. Howard qualifies the French casualty records as &#x27;incomplete&#x27;. While most Prussians fell to the French &quot;Chassepot&quot; rifle, most French fell to the Krupp shells of the Prussian artillery. In a breakdown of the casualties, Steinmetz&#x27;s Prussian First Army lost 4,300 men before the Pointe du Jour, while the French forces opposing him had casualties of 2,155. Losses of the Prussian Guards Corps were even more staggering, with 8,000 casualties out of 18,000 men. The Guards &quot;Jäger&quot; Battalion lost 19 officers, a surgeon and 431 men killed, wounded, or missing out of a total of 700. The 2nd Guards Infantry Brigade lost 39 officers and 1,076 men. The 3rd Guards Infantry Brigade lost 36 officers and 1,060 men. On the French side, the units holding St. Privat lost more than half their number in the village.

<doc id="779862" wikidata="Q2145081" url="?curid=779862" title="Replicator equation">
<text>In mathematics, the replicator equation is a deterministic monotone non-linear and non-innovative game dynamic used in evolutionary game theory. The replicator equation differs from other equations used to model replication, such as the quasispecies equation, in that it allows the fitness function to incorporate the distribution of the population types rather than setting the fitness of a particular type constant. This important property allows the replicator equation to capture the essence of selection. Unlike the quasispecies equation, the replicator equation does not incorporate mutation and so is not able to innovate new types or pure strategies.

== Equation ==

The most general continuous form of the replicator equation is given by the differential equation:where formula_1 is the proportion of type formula_2 in the population, formula_3 is the vector of the distribution of types in the population, formula_4 is the fitness of type formula_5 (which is dependent on the population), and formula_6 is the average population fitness (given by the weighted average of the fitness of the formula_7 types in the population). Since the elements of the population vector formula_8 sum to unity by definition, the equation is defined on the n-dimensional simplex.

The replicator equation assumes a uniform population distribution; that is, it does not incorporate population structure into the fitness. The fitness landscape does incorporate the population distribution of types, in contrast to other similar equations, such as the quasispecies equation.

In application, populations are generally finite, making the discrete version more realistic. The analysis is more difficult and computationally intensive in the discrete formulation, so the continuous form is often used, although there are significant properties that are lost due to this smoothing. Note that the continuous form can be obtained from the discrete form by a limiting process.

To simplify analysis, fitness is often assumed to depend linearly upon the population distribution, which allows the replicator equation to be written in the form:

:formula_9

where the payoff matrix formula_10 holds all the fitness information for the population: the expected payoff can be written as formula_11 and the mean fitness of the population as a whole can be written as formula_12. It can be shown that the change in the ratio of two proportions formula_13 with respect to time is:formula_14In other words, the change in the ratio is driven entirely by the difference in fitness between types.

=== Derivation of deterministic and stochastic replicator dynamics ===
Suppose that the number of individuals of type formula_5 is formula_16 and that the total number of individuals is formula_17. Define the proportion of each type to be formula_18. Assume that the change in each type is governed by geometric Brownian motion:formula_19where formula_20 is the fitness associated with type formula_5. The average fitness of the types formula_22. The Wiener processes are assumed to be uncorrelated. For formula_23, Itô&#x27;s lemma then gives us:formula_24The partial derivatives are then:formula_25where formula_26 is the Kronecker delta function. These relationships imply that:formula_27Each of the components in this equation may be calculated as:formula_28Then the stochastic replicator dynamics equation for each type is given by:formula_29Assuming that the formula_30 terms are identically zero, the deterministic replicator dynamics equation is recovered.

== Analysis ==

The analysis differs in the continuous and discrete cases: in the former, methods from differential equations are utilized, whereas in the latter the methods tend to be stochastic. Since the replicator equation is non-linear, an exact solution is difficult to obtain (even in simple versions of the continuous form) so the equation is usually analyzed in terms of stability. The replicator equation (in its continuous and discrete forms) satisfies the folk theorem of evolutionary game theory which characterizes the stability of equilibria of the equation. The solution of the equation is often given by the set of evolutionarily stable states of the population.

In general nondegenerate cases, there can be at most one interior evolutionary stable state (ESS), though there can be many equilibria on the boundary of the simplex. All the faces of the simplex are forward-invariant which corresponds to the lack of innovation in the replicator equation: once a strategy becomes extinct there is no way to revive it.

Phase portrait solutions for the continuous linear-fitness replicator equation have been classified in the two and three dimensional cases. Classification is more difficult in higher dimensions because the number of distinct portraits increases rapidly.

== Relationships to other equations ==

The continuous replicator equation on formula_7 types is equivalent to the Generalized Lotka–Volterra equation in formula_32 dimensions. The transformation is made by the change of variables: 
:formula_33
:formula_34
where formula_35 is the Lotka–Volterra variable. The continuous replicator dynamic is also equivalent to the Price equation.

== Discrete replicator equation ==
When one considers an unstructured infinite population with non-overlapping generations, one should work with the discrete forms of the replicator equation. Mathematically, two simple phenomenological versions---

:formula_36 
:formula_37

---are consistent with the Darwinian tenet of natural selection or any analogous evolutionary phenomena. Here, prime stands for the next time step. However, the discrete nature of the equations puts bounds on the payoff-matrix elements. Interestingly, for the simple case of two-player-two-strategy games, the type I replicator map is capable of showing period doubling bifurcation leading to chaos and it also gives a hint on how to generalize the concept of the evolutionary stable state to accommodate the periodic solutions of the map.

== Generalizations ==

A generalization of the replicator equation which incorporates mutation is given by the replicator-mutator equation, which takes the following form in the continuous version:

:formula_38

where the matrix formula_39 gives the transition probabilities for the mutation of type formula_40 to type formula_2, formula_42 is the fitness of the formula_43 and formula_44 is the mean fitness of the population. This equation is a simultaneous generalization of the replicator equation and the quasispecies equation, and is used in the mathematical analysis of language.

The discrete version of the replicator-mutator equation may have two simple types in line with the two replicator maps written above:
:formula_45
and
:formula_46
respectively.

The replicator equation or the replicator-mutator equation can be extended to include the effect of delay that either corresponds to the delayed information about the population state or in realizing the effect of interaction among players. The replicator equation can also easily be generalized to asymmetric games. A recent generalization that incorporates population structure is used in evolutionary graph theory.

<doc id="779869" wikidata="Q615987" url="?curid=779869" title="Aorounga crater">
<text>Aorounga is an eroded meteorite impact crater in Chad, Africa. The exposed remnant of the crater is in diameter and its age is estimated to be less than 345 million years (Carboniferous or younger).

== Description ==
An outer and an inner ring (, respectively) rise about above the mean level of the surrounding plain (see topographic map). Both aforementioned rings are separated by a relatively flat depression of uniform width. A possible central hill, maybe an uplift structure, of is almost centrally located in the depression.

The crater is accompanied by two nearby circular features revealed by Space Shuttle SIR-C radar. These may be related impact craters, and if correct, Aorounga may be part of a crater chain. On the assumption that this hypothesis is correct, the exposed Aorounga crater is sometimes referred to as Aorounga South. The central highland, or peak, of the crater is surrounded by a small sand-filled trough; this, in turn, is surrounded by a larger circular trough. Linear rock ridges alternating with light orange sand deposits cross the image from upper left to lower right; these are called yardangs by geomorphologists. Yardangs form by wind erosion of exposed rock layers in a unidirectional wind field. The wind blows from the northeast at Aorounga, and sand dunes formed between the yardangs are actively migrating to the southwest.

===Geology===
The geology of the two craters was summarised based on published geological information for Aorounga (Becq-Giraudon et al. 1992) and Gweni Fada (Vincent and Beauvilain 1996). 
Aorounga, a circular depression, appears on some regional geographic maps and has a visible present-day diameter of ~13 km. It is situated in northern Chad about 110 km southeast of the Emi Koussi volcano in the Tibesti Massif. A photogeological investigation of Gemini, Apollo, Landsat, and aerial photographs suggested an origin either as a granite diapir or an impact crater. The structure was mentioned as a possible impact crater by Grieve et al. (1988). A French expedition collected a few samples from the structure and reported the first observation of shock deformation.

The crater, formed in fine-grained, well-sorted, slightly carbonate-bearing sandstone possibly of Upper Devonian age, is characterised by outer and inner rings rising about 100 m above the surrounding plain. The two rings are separated by a depression of uniform width. The ring walls consist of steeply outward dipping sandstone layers, with some breccia found on top of the inner rim wall. No reliable age dating exists for Aorounga. Cosmogenic nuclide exposure dating suggested a minimum age of 0.5 Ma, indicating a minimum age for the impact event. The Gweni Fada structure, estimated to be ~14 km in diameter, is located about 320 km southeast of Aorounga. The structure is centred at 17°25′ N and 21°45′ E, and appears asymmetric and deeply eroded. A French team reported shock metamorphic effects in quartz grains from sandstones. The structure occurs in sandstones of probable Upper Devonian age. Remote sensing analysis using Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) data provided detailed topographic information about the Aorounga structure.

The Aorounga impact structure is recognised as a multi-ring structure, with a central complex surrounded by a near-circular ring feature of strong elevation, followed by the flat annulus and an outer ring, presumably the actual crater rim zone. A maximum diameter for the Aorounga structure of 16 km is proposed. Superposition of Landsat 5 scene onto SRTM data provides a realistic 3-D perspective of the crater region.

<text>The Conejos River is a tributary of the Rio Grande, approximately long, in south-central Colorado in the United States. It drains a scenic area of the eastern San Juan Mountains west of the San Luis Valley.

==Description==
It rises from snowmelt along the continental divide west of Conejos Peak in western Conejos County, approximately northeast of Pagosa Springs. It flows briefly northeast, through Platoro Reservoir, then southeast through the Rio Grande National Forest, then east along the New Mexico border through a scenic canyon. It enters the southwestern corner of the San Luis Valley from the west near Conejos and joins the Rio Grande from the west approximately 15 mi (24 km) southeast of Alamosa. It is impounded at Platoro Reservoir for flood control and to manage irrigation in the San Luis Valley, as part of the San Luis Valley Project of the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation.

The river is wide and shallow along much of its course. It descends steeply in several areas, including Pinnacle Canyon, a popular destination for whitewater rafting.

Off-limits to white settlement during the New Spain years, the river was the site of early land grants to settlers from the government of Mexico in the 1830s. The first settlement of 50 families along the river, in the Guadalupe Grant in 1833, was destroyed in an attack by Native Americans. José Jacques established the first white settlement on the river in 1851. The town of Conejos was founded in 1854 by Lafayette Head, who later became the first lieutenant governor of Colorado.

<text>Patsy Fagan (born 15 January 1951) is an Irish former professional snooker player. Having been runner-up in the 1974 English Amateur Championship, he turned professional in October 1976. He experienced early success with victories at the 1977 UK Championship and the 1977 Dry Blackthorn Cup but following a car accident, developed a psychological block when using the which affected his playing and he did not win another title. He lost his professional status in 1989 following a 2–9 playoff defeat by Brady Gollan and now works as a snooker coach. His highest career ranking was 11, in 1978/79.

==Early life and amateur career==
Fagan was born in Dublin on 15 January 1951, one of twelve children. He started playing snooker at the age of 12, and moved to London in 1968.

He played at the Chiswick Memorial Club, and in 1974 it was reported in a local newspaper that in a six-frame session he had recorded a break of 106, another over 80, and three more over 70. In the 1974 English Amateur Championship, he defeated Mick Fisher 6–1 in the Southern section final before being beaten 7–11 by the reigning world amateur champion Ray Edmonds in the main final. In 1975, Fagan became the youngest player ever to win the London and Home Counties billiards championship, playing with a focus on potting the red ball as he defeated Ron Riggins 1,176–881 in the final. In the 1975 English Amateur Snooker Championship he lost 1–4 to Terry Griffiths in the Southern region quarter-finals, and in the 1976 Southern area final he lost 6–8 to Chris Ross despite making a tournament record break of 115.

In 1974, Fagan won a money match against Alex Higgins for £2,000, an amount equal to that received by the winner of the 1974 World Snooker Championship.

==Early professional success==
Regarded as &quot;one of the most exciting players of the mid-seventies&quot;, and &quot;one of the men most likely to succeed when he turned professional&quot;, Fagan turned professional in October 1976. He made his first maximum break on 15 January 1977, his 26th birthday, against Dave Gilbert at the Clapton Bus Garage Social Club. At the 1977 World Snooker Championship, he beat Jim Meadowcroft 11–9 in qualifying and then lost 7–13 to defending champion Ray Reardon in the last 16, having finished the first session of the match level at 4–4 and the second 7–10 behind. Reardon then won all three in the final session, taking the last two of them on the black. The matches between Fagan and Reardon, and between Fred Davis and John Pulman, were the first to be held at the Crucible Theatre, which as of 2022 had remained as the venue for the World Snooker Championship for 45 years.

At the UK Championship in 1977, which at the time was a non-ranking event open only to UK passport holders, Fagan beat Jackie Rea 5–1 in the first round, and Fred Davis 5–0 in the second round. He won in the deciding frame in each of the next two rounds, 5–4 against Jim Meadowcroft in the quarter-finals and 9–8 against John Virgo in the semi-finals, to reach the final against another player in his first year as a professional, Doug Mountjoy. The two finalists shared the first four frames but Fagan won the next four to take a 6–2 lead, after which Mountjoy also won four frames in a row to level the match at 6–6. Fagan then took the next two frames to lead 8–6, eventually winning the match 12–9.

Before the UK championship, Fagan had been announced as one of the four invited contenders for the 1977 Dry Blackthorn Cup, along with world championship winners Alex Higgins, John Spencer and Reardon. He beat Spencer in the semi-final then Higgins 4–2 in the final to win the tournament. He received £2,000 prize money for his Dry Blackthorn Cup win, the same amount he had received for his UK championship victory a couple of weeks earlier.

==Later professional career==
Fagan failed to make an impact at the 1978 Masters, losing 2–4 to John Pulman in the first round. At the 1978 World Snooker Championship he beat John Dunning 9–5 and then Alex Higgins 13–12. In the match against Higgins, Fagan was 10–12 behind but won two frames on the black and the last on the pink. He lost 10–13 to Fred Davis in the quarter-finals.

In the 1970s and until 1982, the Irish Professional Championship was played on a challenge basis, and in April 1978 Fagan played defending champion Alex Higgins for the title. Fagan was a frame ahead after the first day of the match, at 5–4. At the start of the next day&#x27;s play he extended his lead to 8–5 before Higgins drew level at 8–8 and then won seven of the next nine to leave Fagan 10–15 behind at the end of the second day. Higgins won the match 21–13.

Entering the 1978 UK Championship as defending champion, Fagan lost the first four frames of his opening match against David Taylor before tying the match at 4–4, eventually losing 7–9. He was also defeated by Taylor in the first round of the 1979 Masters, losing 3–5 after having been 3–2 ahead. From late 1978, following a car accident, Fagan started to experience a psychological block when using the . This version of the &quot;yips&quot; caused him to spend a long time cueing and then usually ; because of this, he would play left-handed rather than using the rest where possible. This problem affected his match against Taylor at the Masters in January 1979. Two months later, he challenged Higgins again for the Irish Professional title. Higgins won the match 21–12, making a break of 124 in 2 minutes and 45 seconds on the final day.

Fagan was part of the &quot;rest of the world&quot; team at the 1979 World Challenge Cup, along with Perrie Mans and Jimmy van Rensberg. In their match against the Northern Ireland team, Fagan lost 0–1 to Dennis Taylor on the first day, in a match where Taylor asked him to play again after Fagan had fouled by touching the blue ball with his sleeve whilst using the rest in attempting to hit the yellow ball. Fagan was quoted afterwards as saying &quot;Dennis took advantage of my rest problems but it didn&#x27;t bother me.&quot; On the second day, he beat Jackie Rea 1–0 but then lost 0–3 to Higgins on the second. Northern Ireland won the match 8–7 after having been 2–7 behind. Fagan and his fellow team members also lost 7–8 against the England team.

Dennis Taylor also beat Fagan in the quarter-finals of the 1979 UK Championship, 9–6, after Fagan had knocked out Mike Hallett 9–4 and Graham Miles 9–5. In the 1980 World Snooker Championship Fagan lost in his first match, 6–10 to Steve Davis. This was the last time he reached as far as the quarter-final of a major tournament other than the Irish Professional Championship or the 1986 Irish Masters, the latter resulting from a walkover against Kirk Stevens. He lost to Dennis Taylor in a challenge for the Irish Professional Championship in 1981, coming from 0–3 down to lead 5–4 at the end of the first session, and 10–8 at the close of the second session. The third session saw Fagan make a break of 107 on his way to building a 15–12 lead. However, Taylor retained the title, winning 22–21.

A 2–9 professional playoff defeat by Brady Gollan in April 1989 meant that Fagan lost his professional status. His highest career ranking had been 11, in 1978/79, and his best finish in a ranking tournament was reaching the quarter-final at the 1978 World Snooker Championship. He subsequently worked as a landscape gardener and a night-shift sorter for the Post Office. Fagan works as a snooker coach and has coached the Paddington professional Alfie Burden, who was the world amateur champion in 2009. Ronnie O&#x27;Sullivan sought coaching advice from Fagan in 2011.

He entered the 2021 World Seniors Championship, losing 0–3 to Stephen Hendry in the first round.

<text>Khalid Khannouchi () (born September 12, 1971) is a Moroccan-born American retired long-distance runner. He is the former world record holder for the marathon and held the former road world best for the 20 km distance. He is one of only five men to break the marathon world record more than once, and one of only five to break their own marathon world record (the others are Jim Peters, Derek Clayton, Eliud Kipchoge, and Haile Gebrselassie).

Khalid fell out with the Moroccan athletics federation over training expenses and moved to Brooklyn, New York City in 1992 with three of his friends. He married American Sandra Inoa in 1996, who coached him and acted as his agent. They set up home in Ossining, New York. He became a naturalized citizen of the United States on May 2, 2000. He first gained broad notoriety by winning the 1997 Chicago Marathon by over a minute with a time of 2:07.10, breaking the 12-year old course record held by Steve Jones.

, Khalid holds the American record for the marathon, with a time of 2:05:38 at the London Marathon in 2002.

Khannouchi officially retired on March 27, 2012 due to recurring foot injuries since 2003. Khannouchi stated &quot;It was really my feet that betrayed me. Every time I go and try to push hard, I get the pain and soreness again. I can&#x27;t train hard and if you can&#x27;t train at a certain level where you can be competitive it&#x27;s not worth it to keep wasting time.&quot;

<doc id="779882" wikidata="Q3727405" url="?curid=779882" title="Araguainha crater">
<text>The Araguainha crater or Araguainha dome is an impact crater on the border of Mato Grosso and Goiás states, Brazil, between the villages of Araguainha and Ponte Branca. With a diameter of , it is the largest known impact crater in South America.

The crater has most recently been dated to years ago, when the region was probably a shallow sea. The margins of error of this date overlap the time of the Permian–Triassic extinction event, one of the largest mass extinction events in Earth&#x27;s history. The impact punched through Paleozoic sedimentary units belonging to the Paraná Basin formations, and exposed the underlying Ordovician granite basement rocks. It is estimated that the crater was initially wide and deep, which then widened to as its walls subsided inwards.

== Description ==
Araguainha is a complex crater with annular and radial faults, exposed to the surface and eroded, cut through by the Araguaia River. The crater has an uplifted central core, shaped like an elliptical basin, consisting of exposed basement granite. Surrounding this core is a ring of shocked granite and overlying breccias; then another ring of ridges and mountains, in diameter and up to high, consisting of folded and steeply tilted Devonian sandstones. This central region is surrounded by an annular depression floored by rocks from Devonian and Carboniferous sandstone formations. The outer rim of the crater consists of remnants of semi-circular grabens in highly deformed Permo-Carboniferous sediments. Evidences of impact origin include shatter cones, impact breccias, and shocked quartz.

== Access and conservation ==
The Araguainha Dome can be reached by car from Goiânia or from Cuiabá. An unpaved state road, between Ponte Branca and Araguainha, cuts across the central uplift, as does the Araguaia River. As of 1999, the local residents were not yet aware of the dome&#x27;s nature and scientific importance.

== Dating and interpretation ==
The earliest report on the Araguainha structure was published by Northfleet &quot;et al&quot;. (1969), who interpreted it as an uplift of the Phanerozoic sediments caused by a Cretaceous syenite intrusion. A geological reconnaissance survey by Silveira Filho and Ribeiro (1971) noted the occurrence of lavas, breccias, and tuffs around the central core and deduced that Araguainha was a crypto-volcanic structure. Dietz and French (1973) reported the occurrence of impact breccias and shocked quartz, and recognized the structure as an impact crater. A detailed study of the crater by Crósta &quot;et al&quot;. (1981) and Crósta (1982) reported further petrological and mineralogical evidence of the impact. Further geomorphologic evidence was published by Theilen-Willige (1981). A magnetic survey was conducted by Fischer and Masero (1994).

Dome formation was first dated (at years ago, with Rb-Sr method) by Deutsch &quot;et al&quot;. (1992). Engelhardt &quot;et al&quot;. (1992) published a detailed study of the uplifted core and a revised date of about 246 million years ago, later revised to about 244 million years ago. Most recently it was dated by Tohver &quot;et al&quot;. (2012) at years ago.

== Effects ==
Recent dating by Tohver &quot;et al&quot;. (2012), to years ago, places the impact at dates overlapping estimates for the Permo-Triassic boundary. and the Permian–Triassic extinction event.

Much of the local rock was oil shale. The estimated energy released by the Araguainha impact is insufficient to be a direct cause of the global mass extinction, but the colossal local earth rifting would have released huge amounts of oil and gas from the shattered rock. The resulting sudden global warming might have precipitated the Permian–Triassic extinction.

<doc id="779883" wikidata="Q190327" url="?curid=779883" title="Magical objects in Harry Potter">
<text>The following is a list of magical objects that appear in the &quot;Harry Potter&quot; novels and film adaptations.

== Deathly Hallows ==

The Deathly Hallows are three magical objects that appear in &quot;Deathly Hallows&quot;. They are the Elder Wand, the Resurrection Stone, and the Cloak of Invisibility. According to wizarding legend, they can provide mastery over death if one person owns all three. The objects are generally remembered only as part of a fairy tale called &quot;The Tale of the Three Brothers&quot;. According to J. K. Rowling, this fictional fairy tale is based on &quot;The Pardoner&#x27;s Tale&quot; by Geoffrey Chaucer.

Harry eventually comes to possess all three Hallows – the cloak being inherited from his father James Potter, later understood to be a descendant of one of the Peverell brothers, the Resurrection Stone in the Golden Snitch bequeathed to him by Dumbledore, and the allegiance and mastery of the Elder Wand when he defeats and disarms its prior owner, Draco Malfoy, who unwittingly won it from Dumbledore just before Dumbledore&#x27;s death.

=== Elder Wand ===
The Elder Wand is described in &quot;Deathly Hallows&quot; as a legendary and extremely powerful wand made of elder wood with a core of Thestral tail hair. Harry discovers that the Elder Wand&#x27;s allegiance is transferred when its owner is killed, defeated, or disarmed. Through a series of events, Voldemort comes to possess the Elder Wand, even though Harry is its true master. Unaware of the wand&#x27;s loyalty to Harry, Voldemort attempts to duel him near the end of the novel. The wand refuses to kill Harry, with the result that Voldemort&#x27;s curse rebounds on him, and he dies. After Voldemort&#x27;s death, Harry uses the Elder Wand to repair his own broken wand. He then returns the Elder Wand to Dumbledore&#x27;s tomb. In the film adaptation of &quot;Deathly Hallows&quot;, Harry snaps the wand in two and throws the pieces off a bridge.

J. K. Rowling revealed in an interview that the first working title for &quot;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows&quot; was &quot;Harry Potter and the Elder Wand&quot;.

=== Resurrection Stone ===
The Resurrection Stone allows the bearer to communicate with the dead. The form of Sirius Black generated by the stone tells Harry that he and the other forms created by the stone are part of him and invisible to others. According to the fairy tale concerning the origin of the Deathly Hallows, using the Resurrection Stone drove its first owner to kill himself because he brought his late fiancée back from the dead, and she was very unhappy in the living world because she did not belong there. By the time the stone was seen in Marvolo Gaunt&#x27;s possession, it had been set into a ring that bore the symbol of the Deathly Hallows, which the ignorant Gaunt believed to be the Peverell coat of arms; he used the ring to boast about his ancestry and blood purity. Harry said this is the Hallow he would desire most, as like Dumbledore he could name people he would like to communicate with again. Voldemort became aware of the ring&#x27;s antiquity and eventually used it as a Horcrux, a container for part of his soul, being unaware of the stone&#x27;s additional magical properties.

Dumbledore recovered the ring from Marvolo&#x27;s estate, recognizing it as both a Horcrux and one of the Deathly Hallows. Forgetting that as a Horcrux, it was likely to be protected by curses laid by Voldemort, and blinded by personal desire, Dumbledore attempted to use the Resurrection Stone to talk to his deceased family. The curse disfigured his hand and began to spread into his body. Although Snape partly contained the spread in the damaged and blackened hand, Dumbledore was doomed to have, at most, a year left to live.

The stone is later passed to Harry through Dumbledore&#x27;s will. Harry uses the Stone to summon his deceased loved ones – his parents, his godfather Sirius Black, and Remus Lupin – to comfort him and strengthen his courage, before he goes to meet his death at Voldemort&#x27;s hand. The stone falls unseen from Harry&#x27;s fingers in the Forbidden Forest as he reaches Voldemort&#x27;s encampment. Harry survives the encounter and he and Dumbledore&#x27;s portrait later agreed that Harry will neither search for the stone nor tell others where it is.

=== Cloak of Invisibility ===
In the &quot;Harry Potter&quot; universe, an invisibility cloak is a rare type of cloak used to make the wearer invisible. Rowling&#x27;s 2001 book &quot;Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them&quot; states that invisibility cloaks may be crafted from Demiguise pelts. Invisibility cloaks can also be ordinary cloaks with a Disillusionment Charm or a Bedazzlement Hex placed on them. Over time, these cloaks will lose their invisibility.

In the novels, Harry owns an invisibility cloak which is later revealed to be a Hallow. Unlike other invisibility cloaks, the Cloak of Invisibility cannot be worn out by time or spells. The Hallow Cloak belonged to Ignotus Peverell and was passed down to his descendant, James Potter. After James&#x27;s death, Dumbledore gives the Cloak to Harry, who uses it throughout the series to sneak around Hogwarts on various adventures.

== Detectors ==

=== Moody&#x27;s Eyeball ===
During the First Wizarding War, Alastor Moody lost his eye and replaced it with an enchanted glass eyeball. With the eyeball, Moody can see through solid objects, invisibility cloaks, and the back of his own head. Following Moody&#x27;s death in &quot;Deathly Hallows&quot;, the eyeball ends up in the possession of Dolores Umbridge. When Harry infiltrates the Ministry of Magic, he steals the eyeball from her office and buries it in the forest.

=== Foe-glass ===
A Foe-glass is a mirror that depicts the enemies of its owner.

=== The Marauder&#x27;s Map ===
The Marauder&#x27;s Map is a magical map of Hogwarts created by Sirius Black, Remus Lupin, Peter Pettigrew, and James Potter while they were students at the school. In &quot;Prisoner of Azkaban&quot;, Fred and George Weasley give the map to Harry so he can travel to Hogsmeade through a hidden passageway. The map is a blank piece of parchment when not in use, but it becomes a detailed layout of Hogwarts when it is activated. It shows the locations of secret passages and instructions on how to access them. It also depicts the location of every individual at Hogwarts in real-time, including their movements.

=== Probity Probe ===
A Probity Probe detects hidden magical objects and concealment spells. Probity Probes are depicted as thin golden rods in &quot;Order of the Phoenix.&quot; After Voldemort&#x27;s return, Probes are used to protect Gringotts Bank and to scan Hogwarts students for Dark objects.

=== Remembrall ===
A Remembrall is a small glass orb. It contains smoke that turns red when the person holding it has forgotten something. It does not tell the holder what has been forgotten. Neville Longbottom is sent a Remembrall by his grandmother in &quot;Philosopher&#x27;s Stone&quot;.

=== Revealer ===
A Revealer is a bright red eraser, used to make invisible ink appear. It first appears in &quot;Chamber of Secrets&quot; when Hermione tries to make hidden writing appear in Tom Riddle&#x27;s diary.

=== Secrecy Sensor ===
A Secrecy Sensor is a Dark detector that looks like &quot;an extra-squiggly, golden television aerial.&quot; It vibrates when it detects concealment and lies. In &quot;Half-Blood Prince&quot;, every student and owl entering Hogwarts is inspected with Secrecy Sensors to ensure no Dark objects enter the school.

=== Sneakoscope ===
A Sneakoscope serves as a Dark Arts detector. The device is described as a miniature glass spinning-top that emits shrill noises in the presence of deception, for instance, when an untrustworthy person is near or when a deceitful event takes place nearby.

=== Weasley family clock ===
The Weasleys have a special clock in their home with nine hands, one for every member of the family. Instead of telling the time, the clock reveals the location or status of each family member. The known locations are: &quot;Home&quot;, &quot;School&quot;, &quot;Work&quot;, &quot;Travelling&quot;, &quot;Lost&quot;, &quot;Hospital&quot;, &quot;Prison&quot;, and &quot;Mortal Peril&quot;.

In the sixth novel, all nine hands point to &quot;mortal peril&quot; at all times, except when someone is travelling. Mrs. Weasley takes this to mean that with Voldemort&#x27;s return, everyone is always in mortal peril, but she cannot verify this as she does not know anyone else who has a clock like hers.

Various fans have re-created the clock for their own families, for example by using geofencing for cell phones.

== Horcruxes ==
A Horcrux is an object used to store part of a wizard&#x27;s soul, which protects them from death. If the body of a Horcrux owner is killed, that portion of the soul that had remained in the body does not pass on to the next world, but will rather exist in a non-corporeal form capable of being resurrected by another wizard, as stated in &quot;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince&quot; and demonstrated in &quot;Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire&quot;. If all of someone&#x27;s Horcruxes are destroyed, then the soul&#x27;s only anchor in the material world would be the body, the destruction of which would then cause final death. The creation of Horcruxes is considered the darkest of all magic.

This method was chosen by Voldemort to attain immortality. J. K. Rowling uses Horace Slughorn&#x27;s expository dialogue to reveal that the creation of a Horcrux requires one to commit a murder, which, as the supreme act of evil, &quot;rips the soul apart&quot;. After the murder, a spell is cast to infuse part of the ripped soul into an object, which then becomes a Horcrux. In the final book of the series, Hermione finds the spell in a book titled &quot;Secrets of the Darkest Art&quot;. Rowling has revealed that she intends to detail the process and spell used to create a Horcrux in her long-mentioned &quot;Harry Potter&quot; Encyclopedia.

Both inanimate objects and living organisms have been used as Horcruxes, though the latter are considered riskier to use, since a living being can move and think for itself. There is no limit to the number of Horcruxes a witch or wizard can create. As the creator&#x27;s soul is divided into progressively smaller portions, they lose more of their natural humanity and the soul becomes increasingly unstable. Consequently, under very specific conditions, a soul fragment can be sealed within an object without the intention or knowledge of the creator. While the object thus affected will, like any Horcrux, preserve the immortality of the creator, it does not become a &quot;Dark object&quot;. For example, Voldemort has unusual control over Nagini, and consequently Nagini is able to communicate with Voldemort about the presence of Harry in Godric&#x27;s Hollow in &quot;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows&quot;.

Horcruxes made from inanimate objects cannot be destroyed by conventional means such as smashing, breaking, or burning. The known materials or objects that can destroy Horcruxes are Basilisk venom, the Sword of Gryffindor (which contains Basilisk venom after Harry uses it to kill a Basilisk), and Fiendfyre, which is a magical flame that cannot be extinguished unless it runs out of fuel.

Voldemort&#x27;s creation of Horcruxes is central to the later storyline of the &quot;Harry Potter&quot; novels. Voldemort intended to split his soul into seven pieces, with six Horcruxes and the last piece reposing within his body. When Voldemort attacked the Potter family, and his body was destroyed by the rebounded Killing Curse, a piece of his soul splintered off and attached itself to the only living thing remaining in the room, Harry Potter, in a manner similar to a Horcrux. Voldemort went on to complete his collection of the intended six Horcruxes by turning his snake Nagini into one, thus fragmenting his soul into a total of eight (counting the one residing in his own body), not seven, pieces. By that time, though, unbeknownst to Voldemort himself, the first Horcrux (a diary) had already been destroyed, therefore all seven Horcruxes never existed together at the same point in time.

All of Voldemort&#x27;s deliberately created Horcruxes were made using objects that had been important to him or that held some symbolic value. He hid some of them carefully so that no one could find and destroy them, but used Nagini to do his bidding on several occasions, and the diary was always intended to be a weapon to carry out Voldemort&#x27;s plan to remove Muggle-borns from Hogwarts. In &quot;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince&quot;, the discovery of Voldemort&#x27;s diary is revealed as the proof that led to Dumbledore beginning the hunt for other Horcruxes, as it not only gave absolute proof that Voldemort split his soul, but also that there were likely other, better-protected artifacts.

J. K. Rowling revealed on Pottermore that Quirinus Quirrell served as a temporary Horcrux when Voldemort&#x27;s soul possessed his body during Harry&#x27;s first year at Hogwarts. A notable difference, however, is that the piece of soul within Quirrell was able to exist without its container, as it abandoned Quirrell and left him to die in the underground chambers.

=== Tom Riddle&#x27;s diary ===
Tom Riddle (later known as Lord Voldemort) created his first Horcrux during his fifth year at Hogwarts, using his own school diary. In order to cast the spell, he murdered his fellow student Myrtle Warren. In &quot;Chamber of Secrets&quot;, Ginny Weasley becomes possessed by the fragment of Riddle&#x27;s soul that is encased in the diary, which compels her to open the Chamber of Secrets. At the end of the novel, Harry saves Ginny and destroys the diary by stabbing it with a Basilisk fang.
=== Marvolo Gaunt&#x27;s ring ===
Voldemort created his second Horcrux using a ring owned by his grandfather, Marvolo Gaunt. He murdered his father to make this Horcrux, which is later destroyed by Albus Dumbledore, using the sword of Gryffindor. The ring contains the Resurrection Stone, one of the three Deathly Hallows.

=== Slytherin&#x27;s locket ===
Voldemort created his third Horcrux using a locket that once belonged to his ancestor Salazar Slytherin. He murdered a Muggle to make the Horcrux. Albus Dumbledore and Harry obtain the locket in &quot;Half-Blood Prince&quot;, only to discover that it is fake. Later, Harry and his friends infiltrate the Ministry of Magic and steal the real locket from Dolores Umbridge. Ron then destroys it with the sword of Gryffindor.

=== Hufflepuff&#x27;s cup ===
Voldemort created his fourth Horcrux using a cup that once belonged to Helga Hufflepuff. In &quot;Deathly Hallows,&quot; Harry and his friends break into Gringotts Wizarding Bank and steal the cup from the vault of Bellatrix Lestrange. Hermione Granger later destroys it with a Basilisk fang.

=== Ravenclaw&#x27;s diadem ===
Rowena Ravenclaw&#x27;s daughter, Helena, stole her mother&#x27;s diadem in an attempt to become more intelligent than her. Helena hid the diadem in Albania, where it was eventually found by Voldemort. The Dark Lord turned the diadem into his fifth Horcrux, and later sequestered it in the Room of Requirement in Hogwarts. In the novel &quot;Deathly Hallows&quot;, the diadem is destroyed by a Fiendfyre spell cast by Vincent Crabbe. In the film adaptation, Harry stabs the diadem with a Basilisk fang before Ron Weasley kicks it into the Fiendfyre. 

=== Harry Potter ===

When Voldemort attempted to murder Harry as an infant, he inadvertently sealed a fragment of his soul within him in a manner similar to a Horcrux. Rowling has stated that Harry never became a proper &quot;Dark object&quot; since the Horcrux spell was not cast. Regardless, as with all Horcruxes, Voldemort would remain immortal so long as his soul fragment remained within Harry. That portion of Voldemort&#x27;s soul is unintentionally destroyed by Voldemort himself in &quot;Deathly Hallows&quot;.

As a baby, Harry was in the room when Voldemort&#x27;s fatal Killing Curse backfired. Voldemort&#x27;s soul had been weakened and destabilised by his continuous murders and the creation of his previous Horcruxes. Harry became a Horcrux when a fragment of Voldemort&#x27;s soul attached itself to him after the unsuccessful curse. The lightning bolt-shaped scar on Harry&#x27;s forehead is a direct result of this attempted murder, and the connection that formed as a result is used to explain several important plot points. Throughout the series, Harry is able to receive insight into Voldemort&#x27;s mental and emotional states, allowing the reader to eavesdrop on the series&#x27; primary antagonist. This insight is usually accompanied by pain in the scar on Harry&#x27;s forehead. Through Voldemort, Harry also inherited many of Voldemort&#x27;s powers and the ability to speak and understand Parseltongue. It is also revealed by Rowling in an interview that Harry&#x27;s frequent pain in his scar when Voldemort is either active, nearby, or feeling strong emotions, is really the trapped bit of soul yearning to depart from Harry&#x27;s body and rejoin its master&#x27;s soul.

This yearning was one of the reasons why the Killing Curse used by Voldemort on Harry in the Forbidden Forest does destroy the fragment of Voldemort&#x27;s soul within Harry, but only sends Harry&#x27;s soul into a near-death state. Harry could return to his body despite being hit by the Killing Curse from the Elder Wand because Voldemort had used Harry&#x27;s blood to regain his full strength in &quot;Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire&quot;, and because the actual master of the Elder Wand, Draco Malfoy, had been defeated by Harry, making Harry the new master of the Elder Wand. Harry&#x27;s ownership of the wand used for the curse and the Horcrux-like connection between Voldemort and Harry diminished Voldemort&#x27;s curse and protected Harry from irreversible death.

While Voldemort did learn of Harry&#x27;s telepathic connection, Voldemort was never aware that Harry was inadvertently carrying a fragment of his soul. With this destroyed, the connections between the two were also broken, and Harry never again felt pain in his scar. Rowling revealed Harry has also lost the ability to speak Parseltongue, though he regained the ability to understand it in &quot;Harry Potter and the Cursed Child&quot; after his scar began to hurt again following the rise of Voldemort and Bellatrix&#x27;s daughter Delphi whom Harry, his son Albus, and his allies defeated and sent to Azkaban. In the epilogue of the last film, the scar has faded to an ordinary-looking scar on Harry&#x27;s forehead.

=== Nagini ===

The sixth Horcrux was Nagini, the snake Voldemort had with him constantly. This Horcrux was created by Voldemort when he was hiding in the forests of Albania; the murder victim whom he used for its creation was Bertha Jorkins. He found Nagini, and becoming smitten by the snake, turned it into a Horcrux, being connected with it. In the last chapter of &quot;Deathly Hallows&quot;, Nagini was killed by Neville Longbottom using the sword of Godric Gryffindor. The destruction of the last remaining Horcrux made Voldemort mortal.

== Legendary magical artifacts ==

=== Goblet of Fire ===
The Goblet of Fire is an artefact used at the beginning of every Triwizard Tournament. Each student who is of-age and wishes to compete places a piece of parchment with their name on it into the Goblet. At the designated time, the GobIet selects one champion from each of the three schools in competition.

=== Sword of Gryffindor ===
The Sword of Gryffindor is a goblin-crafted sword. It was once owned by Godric Gryffindor, and can magically present itself to any Gryffindor student who needs it. During the course of the novel series, the sword is used to kill a Basilisk and destroy three of Voldemort&#x27;s Horcruxes.

=== Philosopher&#x27;s Stone ===
Based upon the ancient alchemical idea of the philosopher&#x27;s stone, the stone is owned by Nicolas Flamel and first mentioned in &quot;Harry Potter and the Philosopher&#x27;s Stone&quot;. The stone is legendary in that it changes all metals to gold, and can be used to brew a potion called the Elixir of Life, making the drinker immortal. The Philosopher&#x27;s Stone is seen only in the first and last book, although it is referenced several times throughout the series. It was destroyed at the end of the first book by Dumbledore with Flamel&#x27;s agreement.

In the American version, this stone is called the Sorcerer&#x27;s Stone.

=== Sorting Hat ===
The Sorting Hat is an artefact used to sort Hogwarts students into houses. At the beginning of each school year, the Hat is placed on each first-year student&#x27;s head. The Hat announces whether the student will be assigned to Gryffindor, Hufflepuff, Ravenclaw or Slytherin. In the &quot;Harry Potter&quot; films, the Sorting Hat is voiced by Leslie Phillips.

== Mirrors ==

=== The Mirror of Erised ===

The Mirror of Erised is a mystical mirror discovered by Harry in an abandoned classroom in &quot;Philosopher&#x27;s Stone&quot;. On it is inscribed &quot;erised stra ehru oyt ube cafru oyt on wohsi&quot;. When mirrored and correctly spaced, this reads &quot;I show not your face but your heart&#x27;s desire.&quot; As &quot;erised&quot; reversed is &quot;desire&quot;, it is the &quot;Mirror of Desire&quot;. Harry, upon encountering the Mirror, can see his parents, as well as what appears to be a crowd of relatives. The last thing Harry saw in the mirror was Voldemort defeated.

Dumbledore cautions Harry that the Mirror gives neither knowledge nor truth, merely showing the viewer&#x27;s deepest desire, and that men have wasted their lives away before it, entranced by what they see.

The Mirror of Erised was the final protection given to the Philosopher&#x27;s Stone in the first book. Dumbledore hid the Mirror and hid the Stone inside it, knowing that only a person who wanted to find but not use the Stone would be able to obtain it. Anyone else would see themselves making an Elixir of Life or turning things to gold, rather than actually finding the Stone, and would be unable to obtain it. What happens to the mirror afterwards is unknown.

=== Two-way mirrors ===
In &quot;Order of the Phoenix&quot;, Sirius gives Harry a mirror he originally used to communicate with James while they were in separate detentions. That mirror is a part of a set of &quot;two-way mirrors&quot; that are activated by holding one of them and saying the name of the other possessor, causing his or her face to appear on the caller&#x27;s mirror and vice versa. Harry receives this mirror from Sirius in a package after spending his Christmas holiday at Grimmauld Place. Harry, at first, chooses not to open the package, although he does discover the mirror after Sirius&#x27;s death, by which point it is no longer functional. It makes its second appearance in &quot;Deathly Hallows&quot; when Mundungus Fletcher loots Grimmauld Place and sells Sirius&#x27;s mirror to Aberforth Dumbledore, who uses it to watch out for Harry in &quot;Deathly Hallows&quot;. When Harry desperately cries for help to a shard of the magical mirror (which broke in the bottom of his trunk), a brilliant blue eye belonging to Aberforth (which Harry mistakes for Albus&#x27;s eye), appears and he sends Dobby, who arrives to help Harry escape from Malfoy Manor to Shell Cottage.

== Prank objects ==

=== Weasleys&#x27; Wizard Wheezes ===
Prank objects from Weasleys&#x27; Wizard Wheezes are made and designed by the owners of the shop, Fred and George, who test their new creations on themselves and other Hogwarts students.
* Patented Daydream Charms are kits that put the user into a “highly realistic 30-minute daydream”.
* A Headless Hat creates a limited field of invisibility that covers the wearer&#x27;s head, giving them the appearance of not having a head. Its counterpart is a Shield Hat, which deflects minor hexes and curses. 
* Trick Wands are magical fake wands that turn into a silly item (rubber chickens, tin parrots, etc.) when someone tries to use them.
* Extendable Ears are long flesh-coloured strings, one end of which is inserted into a user&#x27;s ear and the other end placed further away towards a conversation or sound. Much like a listening device, the user will be able to hear the sounds as if they were much closer to the source.
* Portable Swamps are, as the name suggests, realistic pop-up swamps. They were first seen in &quot;Order of the Phoenix&quot; after Umbridge is named Headmistress. Fred and George set one off in a corridor, partly as a distraction for Umbridge so Harry can use her fireplace, and partly to just cause general mayhem. They seem to be reasonably difficult to remove: Umbridge cannot remove it and forces Filch to punt students across, while Professor Flitwick vanishes it almost instantly later on in the novel.
* Decoy Detonators are described as black horn type objects that will run out of sight, and make a noise giving the user a good distraction.

There are also prank items which the Weasleys import from elsewhere, such as:

*Peruvian Instant Darkness Powder, which throws an area into darkness that cannot be penetrated by wand light or any magical means, although the effect wears off in a few minutes.

=== Other prank objects ===
Other prank objects include Belch Powder, Dungbombs (which explode and cause a large and extremely smelly mess), and Ever-Bashing Boomerangs (which hit their target repeatedly after being thrown). Fanged Frisbees are quite literally normal Frisbees with fangs and are first mentioned in &quot;Goblet of Fire&quot; as one of Filch&#x27;s newest restricted items during Dumbledore&#x27;s start-of-term speech.

== Storage receptacles ==

=== Moody&#x27;s Magical Trunk ===

Alastor Moody owns a strangely bewitched magical trunk. It has seven locks on it, and the trunk opens to a different assortment of objects for each lock. Most notably, though, the seventh compartment is about deep (possibly because of the use of an Undetectable Extension Charm), and is where Barty Crouch Jr. imprisoned the real Moody. Other compartments contain spellbooks, Dark Detectors, and Moody&#x27;s invisibility cloak.

=== Pensieve ===
A Pensieve is a stone basin used to review memories. Covered in mystic runes, it contains memories whose physical form is neither gas nor liquid. A witch or wizard can extract their own or another&#x27;s memories, store them in the Pensieve, and review them later. It also relieves the mind when it becomes cluttered with information. Anyone can examine the memories in the Pensieve, which also allows viewers to fully immerse themselves in the memories stored within, much like a magical form of virtual reality.

Users of these devices view the memories from a third-person-point-of-view, providing a near-omniscient perspective of the events preserved. J. K. Rowling confirmed memories in the Pensieve allow one to view details of things that happened even if they did not notice or remember them, and stated &quot;that&#x27;s the magic of the Pensieve, what brings it alive.&quot; The memories contained in the Pensieve have the appearance of silver threads. Memories that have deteriorated due to age, or that were heavily manipulated or tampered with to alter perspectives (such as Slughorn&#x27;s), may appear thick and jelly-like and offer obscured viewing. Memories are not limited to just those of humans, since Hokey the house-elf provided Dumbledore with a memory as well. It makes its last appearance in &quot;Deathly Hallows&quot; when Harry uses it to uncover the truth about Snape.

In the fourth film, the Pensieve in Dumbledore&#x27;s office conforms to the description given in the novel. However, in the sixth and eighth films, it appears as a shallow metal dish, floating in midair and filled with a mercury-like liquid. During the eighth film, Harry removes it from the stone basin so he can use it to examine Snape&#x27;s memories.

== Transportation ==

=== Arthur Weasley&#x27;s Flying Ford Anglia ===

Arthur Weasley owned a 1960 Ford Anglia 105E that he subsequently enchanted; consequently, the vehicle can fly, become invisible, and carry the entire Weasley family in spite of its formerly non-enchanted interior dimensions (also the Undetectable Extension Charm), among other abilities. The enchantment placed on the car also made it semi-sentient.

The 1962 Ford Anglia used in the film was acquired by Rupert Grint, who plays Ron Weasley, and is currently displayed in the National Motor Museum, Beaulieu. A total of 14 Ford Anglias were destroyed during the filming of the scene where the car crashes into the Whomping Willow.

A replica of the car in its feral state could be seen in the queue line for the now-defunct Dragon Challenge roller coaster at the Universal Studios Islands of Adventure theme park. Occasionally it blinked its headlights and honked its horn when its motion detectors sensed that guests were standing in front of it or walking by it. The replica has been integrated into Hagrid&#x27;s Magical Creatures Motorbike Adventure and can be seen sitting atop a large rock formation with its windshield wipers and headlights running while under the control of Cornish Pixies. It can also be heard blaring its horn as riders pass beneath the arch. The car appears in the Hogwarts Express attraction where it can be seen flying alongside the train before crashing in the Forbidden Forest.

=== Broomsticks ===

Broomsticks are used for transportation by witches and wizards of all ages, and for participating in the game of Quidditch. Their use is similar to that of flying carpets, although the latter are banned in Great Britain by the Ministry of Magic. However, they are uncomfortable for extended trips, even with a cushion charm applied, and thus many wizards favour other means of transport for those journeys.

Broomsticks are treated as a major consumer product in the wizarding world. There are numerous manufacturers and models of brooms, including &quot;Cleansweeps&quot; and &quot;Comets&quot;, all of which vary in their capabilities. These range from expensive high-performance models to toy broomsticks for young children that fly only a few feet off the ground to family-sized broomsticks that seat multiple people and include a luggage compartment below the seating area.

Since Harry plays Quidditch, his broomsticks - a &quot;Nimbus 2000&quot; and later a &quot;Firebolt&quot; - are prominent in the series. The &quot;Nimbus 2000&quot; was given to him by special consent of Dumbledore via Minerva McGonagall, who had chosen him as the Gryffindor Seeker. The &quot;Firebolt&quot; was given to him by his godfather Sirius Black as a Christmas gift after his &quot;Nimbus&quot; was destroyed by the Whomping Willow tree during a Quidditch match. The &quot;Firebolt&quot; remains the fastest broom in the world, having surpassed the previous record holder, the &quot;Nimbus 2001&quot; (which Draco Malfoy owns and which his father Lucius Malfoy had given as gifts to the entire Slytherin team as a bribe to have Draco as their Seeker). The price of the &quot;Firebolt&quot; is so high it is only available upon request.

=== Floo Powder ===

Floo Powder is a glittering powder used by wizards to travel between fireplaces that are connected to the Floo Network. The traveler throws a handful of Floo powder into the flames, then steps into the fireplace and states their intended destination. Floo powder can also be used for communication; a wizard can kneel in front of the fireplace and stick their head into the fire, which will then appear in the fire of the destination fireplace, leaving the witch or wizard free to talk. It is also known that other body parts may be transported via Floo Powder, as Umbridge almost catches Sirius the second time he converses with Harry through the Floo network. Voices can also be transmitted through the Floo Network, as seen in the &quot;Prisoner of Azkaban&quot; by Snape, who summons Lupin through his office&#x27;s fireplace while interrogating Harry about the Marauder&#x27;s Map.

The Floo Network is controlled by the Ministry of Magic. The Ministry also has over 700 fireplaces in its headquarters so that officials and workers can go directly to/from work without the hustle and bustle of travelling on brooms or by Portkey - or the indignity of having to flush themselves in through a public toilet, as portrayed in &quot;Deathly Hallows&quot;.

According to Pottermore, the only licensed producer of Floo Powder in Britain is Floo-Pow, a company whose Headquarters is located in Diagon Alley. No shortage of Floo Powder has ever been reported, nor does anybody know anyone who makes it. Its price has remained constant for one hundred years: two Sickles a scoop.

=== Hogwarts Express ===

The Hogwarts Express is a steam train which transports Hogwarts students to and from the school at the beginning and end of each term. It also transports willing students home for the Christmas holidays. It is stationed in Hogsmeade when not in use, and it can be accessed only by using the magical barrier between platforms 9 and 10 of King&#x27;s Cross train station (known as &quot; Platform 9¾&quot;) in London. The train referenced in the novels and filmed in the movie adaptations is based on the Jacobite Steam Train that runs through the Scottish Highlands. 

=== Knight Bus ===

The Knight Bus is an enchanted bus that transports wizards. It makes its first appearance in &quot;Prisoner of Azkaban&quot; when Harry unintentionally summons it. The Knight Bus is faster than travelling by broomstick, but not as fast as near-instantaneous Floo Powder and apparating.

The bus functions as a convenient form of public transportation for wizards and witches who either prefer to use it or are unable to travel by other means. It bolts through the streets entirely invisible to Muggles and causes other objects to dodge it (instead of the other way around) for short distance-travel. For longer distances, the Knight Bus instantly leaps 100 miles (160 km) at a time, accompanied by a great bang and jolt.

The conductor of the Knight Bus is Stan Shunpike, and its driver is Ernie Prang. In the third film, Ernie is accompanied by a talking shrunken head voiced by Lenny Henry.

The actual Knight Bus seen in the film adaptation was built by grafting the top deck of a London AEC Regent III RT bus onto the top of another &quot;RT&quot; bus. Both buses were originally built for London Transport. A replica of the Knight Bus sits in front of the London facade at The Wizarding World of Harry Potter in Universal Studios Florida, serving as a stage for a small audience-interactive show with a Stan Shunpike look-alike and a shrunken head.

=== Portkeys ===
Portkeys are first introduced in &quot;Goblet of Fire&quot;. They are an alternative to Apparation but can also be used to transport a group of people at once. Created by using the Portus spell, a Portkey can be set to transport anybody who touches it to a designated location or to become active at a predetermined time and transport itself and anyone touching it to its set destination. It may be created for one-way, one-time use or to transport the holder to and from a particular place in a round trip; in addition, it may be set to activate at a particular time or automatically transport the first person who touches it. The creation of Portkeys is highly restricted and controlled by the Ministry.

Any object can be used as a Portkey. As a safety measure to discourage unsuspecting Muggles from picking them up and activating them, wizards are advised to use old, worthless items. Portkey objects used in the novels include a football and an old boot.

=== Rubeus Hagrid&#x27;s Enchanted Motorbike ===

Sirius Black owned a flying motorbike, which he lent to Hagrid the night Harry&#x27;s parents died. It is first seen when Hagrid delivers the baby Harry to Number 4, Privet Drive in the first book, and then again when Hagrid uses it to transport Harry to a safe house in the seventh volume. In &quot;Deathly Hallows&quot;, various modifications have been made to the bike by Mr. Weasley, allowing it to create a brick wall or a net that erupts from the exhaust pipe and to shoot dragon fire from the exhaust, impelling the bike&#x27;s sudden acceleration. The dragon-fire feature is used to great effect by Hagrid and Harry when being chased by Voldemort; however, Mr. Weasley did warn that he was unsure of its safety and that they should use it only in an emergency. He was right to say this, as the sidecar of the motorbike, unaffected by Hagrid&#x27;s magic, dislodged after the abrupt acceleration.

=== Time-Turner ===
A Time-Turner may be used for short-term time travel. Hermione receives a Time-Turner from McGonagall in &quot;Prisoner of Azkaban&quot;, enabling her to attend more than one class simultaneously. Hermione is ordered to keep it a secret from everyone, including Harry and Ron, although they notice the suspicious impossibility of her schedule and several bizarre disappearances and reappearances. Hermione reveals the secret to Harry and Ron near the end of the book, when she and Harry use the Time-Turner to save Sirius Black and Buckbeak. Strained by her heavy course load, she returns the device to McGonagall at the end of the novel. Hermione&#x27;s Time-Turner resembles a gold hourglass pendant on a necklace.

Time-Turners are a significant point device in &quot;Cursed Child&quot;, where it is revealed that a principle known as Croaker&#x27;s Law restricts all legal Time-Turners to travelling a maximum of five hours into the past. It is widely rumoured that Draco Malfoy&#x27;s son Scorpius is the son of Lord Voldemort and that Scorpius&#x27;s mother used a Time-Turner to make this possible. An illegal Time-Turner capable of travelling back years is confiscated from a Dark wizard by the Ministry of Magic (although official word remains that all Time-Turners are destroyed) and is later stolen by Albus Potter and Scorpius Malfoy, who intend to travel back in time to prevent the death of Cedric Diggory. Unfortunately, they quickly discover the Time-Turner is a cheaply made prototype that only takes them back for five minutes before forcibly returning them to the present. After accidentally creating (and then undoing) an alternate reality where Voldemort survived and took over the world, Albus and Scorpius resolve to destroy the Time-Turner, but are forced into another time trip by the story&#x27;s villain and are left trapped in the past when the Time-Turner is destroyed. Back in the present, Draco reveals he possesses a professionally made Time-Turner (bound by neither Croaker&#x27;s Law nor the five-minute flaw) - he never admitted its existence for fear it would lend credence to the rumours surrounding his son and never used it (despite being tempted by the possibility of seeing his dead wife alive again). When Albus and Scorpius are able to send a message to their parents, Draco&#x27;s Time-Turner is used to rescue the boys.

=== Vanishing Cabinet ===
Two Vanishing Cabinets play a role in the novels, separately stored at Borgin and Burkes and in the Room of Requirement at Hogwarts. When they are in good working order and used properly, a person who steps into either cabinet will instantly emerge from the other.

The Vanishing Cabinet is first seen in &quot;Chamber of Secrets&quot; when Harry hides in it to elude the Malfoys after accidentally travelling to Borgin and Burkes via the Floo Network; its transportation features are not activated as he does not shut its door completely. Its Hogwarts counterpart is also mentioned in &quot;Chamber of Secrets&quot; when Nearly Headless Nick persuades Peeves the Poltergeist to drop it (thus breaking it) over Filch&#x27;s office in order to help Harry escape detention for tracking in mud. It is also used in &quot;Order of the Phoenix&quot; by Fred and George Weasley when they force Montague, the Slytherin Quidditch captain and a member of Dolores Umbridge&#x27;s Inquisitorial Squad, into it after he tries to take house points from Gryffindor. Montague is found several days later, jammed in a toilet and badly disoriented. In &quot;Half-Blood Prince&quot;, Draco Malfoy learns of his experience, determines that the cabinet is linked to the one still at Borgin &amp; Burkes, and repairs it to allow Death Eaters access to Hogwarts.

Though this set is the only one mentioned in the book series, the film version of &quot;Half-Blood Prince&quot; reveals that they were popular when Voldemort first came to power, as they would allow people to make a quick getaway from Voldemort and his Death Eaters in an emergency.

== Writing equipment ==

=== Anti-Cheating Quill ===
The Anti-Cheating Quill, a quill with an anti-cheating charm on it, is first mentioned in &quot;Philosopher&#x27;s Stone&quot;. In book five they are assigned to every O.W.L. student to prevent them from cheating on their written exams.

=== Auto-Answer Quill ===
The Auto-Answer Quill is a quill that has been bewitched so that when the quill touches a question on a piece of parchment it writes the answer instantly. The quill is banned from the O.W.L. Examinations and the inks are checked out every time the test is on.

=== Blood Quill ===
The Blood Quill is a torture quill used by Umbridge throughout the &quot;Order of the Phoenix&quot; to punish students whom she has given detention. It is described as having an unusually sharp black nib. As the user writes, the quill magically and very painfully cuts into the back of the user&#x27;s hand and uses his or her blood for ink. In the fifth book, Harry has detention with Umbridge on several occasions; he is required to write lines (&quot;I must not tell lies&quot;) and is not released from this until Umbridge believes &quot;the message has sunk in.&quot; When carried out repeatedly over an extended period, this leads to permanent scarring, as Harry shows Scrimgeour in the last two books. The scars tingle whenever Harry hears Umbridge&#x27;s name, but it is not clear whether this is psychological or akin to Harry&#x27;s forehead scar hurting whenever Voldemort is active. Another victim of this form of detention is Lee Jordan; in the film adaptation of the book, members of Dumbledore&#x27;s Army are forced to use these quills as well. Blood quills are considered illegal to own.

=== The Quill of Acceptance ===
According to Pottermore, the Quill of Acceptance is a magical object which detects the birth of a child with magical capabilities. It is located in Hogwarts School, where it records the children&#x27;s names in a large book. Professor McGonagall consults the book and sends out the subsequent Hogwarts acceptance letters by owl once the child turns eleven. It has been made very popular due to its use in registering users for the closed beta of Pottermore.

=== Quick Quotes Quill ===
A Quick Quotes Quill is a stenographic tool, acid green in colour, employed by Rita Skeeter to spin the words of her subjects into a more salacious or melodramatic form. In &quot;Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire&quot;, Skeeter uses the quill to interview Harry about his participation in the Triwizard Tournament for her column in &quot;The Daily Prophet&quot;. Harry continually tries to alert her to the inaccuracy of the quill; however, she continually ignores him. Additionally, in &quot;Deathly Hallows&quot;, Rita mentions in her &quot;Daily Prophet&quot; interview concerning her posthumous biography of Dumbledore that her Quick Quotes Quill helped her to write the book so quickly after his death.

=== Spell-Checking Quill ===
The Spell-Checking Quill temporarily corrects spelling as the user writes; however, once the charm wears off it constantly misspells words, even if the user writes them correctly. The most notable example is its misspelling of Ron&#x27;s name as &quot;Roonil Wazlib&quot; in &quot;Half-Blood Prince&quot;. It is sold through Weasley&#x27;s Wizard Wheezes, the joke shop opened by Fred and George Weasley.

== Other objects ==

=== Deluminator ===
A deluminator is a device invented by Albus Dumbledore that can remove light from any light source. It can also return the removed light to its source. The deluminator first appears in &quot;Philosopher&#x27;s Stone&quot; when Dumbledore uses it to darken Privet Drive. In &quot;Deathly Hallows&quot;, it is bequeathed to Ron Weasley in Dumbledore&#x27;s will. Later in the novel, the deluminator serves a different function by helping Ron locate Harry and Hermione after he is separated from them. The device emits a ball of light that enters Ron&#x27;s body and shows him the location of his friends.

=== Fake Galleon ===
In the novel &quot;Order of the Phoenix&quot;, the character Hermione Granger creates fake, enchanted Galleon coins that are used for communication between members of the student organisation Dumbledore&#x27;s Army. The coins have numerals around the edge which display the time and date of the group&#x27;s next meeting.

=== Howler ===
In the &quot;Harry Potter&quot; novels and films, a Howler is a letter sent to express extreme anger or to convey a message very loudly and publicly. When the Howler is opened, the sender&#x27;s voice bellows the message at a deafening volume. The letter then self-destructs by burning.

=== Omnioculars ===
Omnioculars are magical brass binoculars. Omnioculars, besides having the magnification capabilities of binoculars, have many other useful features. For example, they have the ability to slow down or replay something seen through the lenses, although a side effect is that the view in the lenses is not current and can lead to confusion as to the state of the match. They also have a play-by-play feature, where the names of moves performed by Quidditch players are shown in bright purple letters across the Omnioculars&#x27; lenses. Omnioculars also have the ability to list the names and numbers of the players, and can zero in on players rapidly.

=== Spellotape ===
Spellotape is magical adhesive tape. It is named after Sellotape, a popular brand which has become a generic name for transparent adhesive tape in the United Kingdom.

=== Wand ===
A wand is a wooden rod used to perform spells. It is crafted by a wandmaker, who inserts a &quot;core&quot; into the wandwood. Common cores include phoenix tail feathers, unicorn tail hairs, and dragon heartstrings. The only wand shop depicted in the novels is Ollivanders, which is run by the wandmaker Garrick Ollivander.

In the United States, wand cores are created from the horn of river serpents, Wampus hair, Snallygaster heartstring, and Jackalope antlers, a practice originated in the 17th century by the first American wandmaker, Isolt Sayre, an Irish immigrant who founded the Ilvermorny School of Witchcraft and Wizardry in Massachusetts.

A wand is generally considered a very personal object. Wands belonging to other wizards can be borrowed, resulting in a comparatively less potent effect. In &quot;Philosopher&#x27;s Stone&quot;, Harry had to try out many wands before he found one that &quot;chose him.&quot; Wands with cores from the same source give strange effects (&quot;Priori Incantatem&quot;) when forced to fight each other, as is the case with Harry and Voldemort&#x27;s wands. In &quot;Goblet of Fire&quot;, it is revealed each of their wands contains a tail feather from Fawkes, the phoenix belonging to Dumbledore. After &quot;Priori Incantatem&quot;, the wands get to know the opposites&#x27; master, as explained in &quot;Deathly Hallows&quot;. While, according to Ollivander, any object can channel magic if the wizard is strong enough, wands are the most commonly used because of their efficiency (due to the owner&#x27;s bond with the wand itself). This can explain how some wizards are able to use spells without wands (for example, retrieving an item with &quot;Accio&quot;).

Furthermore, wands are able to be won from a witch or wizard and can therefore change their allegiance. This is the case when Harry takes Draco&#x27;s wand at Malfoy Manor, and consequently the wand&#x27;s allegiance swaps to Harry, as explained by Ollivander; and, by extension, so does the allegiance of the Elder Wand, which itself has changed hands many times. When a wizard is expelled from Hogwarts, their wand is snapped in half. This type of damage is usually irreparable.

<doc id="779884" wikidata="Q3407424" url="?curid=779884" title="Promised Land (1987 film)">
<text>Promised Land is a 1987 drama film written and directed by Michael Hoffman and starring Kiefer Sutherland and Meg Ryan. The film is set in Utah. It was the first film to be commissioned by the Sundance Film Festival, and uses the drama over economic class and manhood to critique the Reagan Administration.

==Plot==
The film opens by following two American high school acquaintances, a few years after graduation. They are now suffering from deep anger and anguish, because they are not as successful as they hoped to be.

David Hancock is the high school basketball star who gets into college on an athletic scholarship only to lose the scholarship to a better player. Unable to succeed in college based on his academic merit, he returns to his hometown, becomes a police officer and is slowly moving into a middle-class mediocrity with his cheerleader girlfriend, Mary Daley, who is in college and plans to major in the arts. Hancock is still stewing over the fact that he is no longer the sports star and that his girlfriend is not only reluctant to marry him but may end up being more successful than he.

Danny Rivers is the academic &quot;nerd&quot; who was supposedly destined to be so successful that he earned the nickname &quot;Senator&quot;. It was felt by some that one day he would become a decent and just politician. He has returned home with his unrestrained, unpredictable, overbearing bride, Bev Sykes.

After a quick Christmas Eve reunion with his parents, Danny learns that his father is dying. He is unable to accept that while he left town with great expectations, he has returned a poor drifter. His desire to run from his problems again, however, prompts Bev to mock his manhood in front of some of his high school friends at a bar and the two decide to hold up a convenience store perhaps as a means for Danny to prove his manhood or because that is just what &quot;Hollywood white trash&quot; would do.

Just then, Hancock, unaware that Danny has returned to town, drives into the store&#x27;s parking lot arguing with his girlfriend about the future of their relationship. Interrupting the robbery, he fatally shoots Danny and wounds Bev. Hancock then suffers something of an emotional breakdown. Danny and Hancock are shown to really have little in common except that Danny once had a crush on Mary and perhaps a repressed crush on Hancock.

As other police officers and paramedics arrive on scene, Hancock drives with his girlfriend to an open field where he had previously shared, with his police partner, some of his frustrations. He screams to Mary how he feels he has been lied to while growing up.

Later Hancock has to personally inform Danny&#x27;s father that he has killed his son.

==Cast==
==Production==
&quot;Promised Land&quot; was filmed in Reno, Nevada and various locations in Utah, with the assistance of the Sundance Institute, and Robert Redford is credited as one of two executive producers. The Utah cities of Salt Lake, Midvale and Lehi are cited in the closing credits. Parts of the film were also shot in Wendover and Provo, Utah.

==Reception==
&quot;Variety&quot; gave a critical review, writing the film is &quot;drained of dramatic tension&quot; and &quot;fails to deliver&quot;. In the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, Michael Wilmington wrote, &quot;There’s something a little tentative and unsatisfying about the last few scenes but, forgetting them, &quot;Promised Land&quot; is almost a great American movie--in the anguished, poetically off-kilter tradition of Kazan&#x27;s &quot;East of Eden&quot;, Malick&#x27;s &quot;Days of Heaven&quot; and &quot;Badlands&quot;, Ray&#x27;s &quot;They Live by Night&quot;.&quot; He concluded the film &quot;is a film of lost chances, a story of people who try to go home again: why some of them can’t, and why some of them have stayed in spite of themselves. It’s a gently scary film, and its images echo long afterwards--the serpent on Bev’s back, the trapped dustiness of Danny’s old house, all the angels passing by . . . and the lonely pink car lost in love’s desert, rushing toward crushed dreams, whirling slowly in its mad and sandy spins of death.&quot;

The performance of Meg Ryan received acclaim, with Wilmington writing, &quot;Ripping against the elegiac mood, she galvanizes the movie--whipping psychopathically between wounded tenderness and shrieking rage, raucous gaiety and mean, starved fury.&quot;

<text>Bremelanotide, sold under the brand name Vyleesi, is a medication used to treat low sexual desire in women. Specifically it is used for low sexual desire which occurs before menopause and is not due to medical problems, psychiatric problems, or problems within the relationship. It is given by an injection just under the skin of the thigh or abdomen.
Common side effects include nausea, pain at the site of injection, and headache. It may also cause a temporary increase in blood pressure and decrease in heart rate after each dose, and darkening of the gums, face, and breasts. The medication is a peptide and acts by activating the melanocortin receptors.
Bremelanotide was approved for medical use in the United States in 2019. It was developed by Palatin Technologies. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) considers it to be a first-in-class medication.

==Medical uses==
Bremelanotide is used for the treatment of generalized hypoactive sexual desire disorder (HSDD) in premenopausal women. Specifically it is only recommended in those who have the condition without an underlying cause, such as medical, psychiatric, or relationship problems.

It should be used at least 45 minutes before anticipated sexual activity. Only one dose per 24 hours or no more than eight doses per month is recommended. It should be stopped after eight weeks if there is no improvement in sexual desire and associated distress.

==Contraindications==
Due to its effects on blood pressure (generally a transient increase in systolic blood pressure by 6mmHg, and diastolic blood pressure by 3mmHg), bremelanotide is considered contraindicated in people with uncontrolled high blood pressure or cardiovascular disease. As long as bremelanotide is not used more than once in one day, it is not expected to cause more severe increases in blood pressure.

==Side effects==
The most frequently encountered side effect of bremelanotide is nausea (40.0%), which may be intolerable to some people. The use of anti-nausea medications (e.g., ondansetron) prior to administration of bremelanotide may help to reduce the nausea. Other side effects may include flushing (20.3%), injection site reactions (13.2%), headache (11.3%), vomiting (4.8%), cough (3.3%), fatigue (3.2%), hot flashes (2.7%), paresthesia (2.6%), dizziness (2.2%), and nasal congestion (2.1%). Discoloration of the skin, specifically hyperpigmentation, may occur—especially if bremelanotide is used more than eight times in one month. The discoloration may not resolve upon stopping use of bremelanotide, and may occur on the face, gums, or breasts. Experiments in animals, even at high doses, failed to find any negative consequence of bremelanotide on fertility.

An analysis of clinical trials found that obese women reduced their calorie intake and lost weight. Another drug with a similar mechanism of action (setmelanotide) is approved for weight loss in rare types of obesity.
== Interactions ==
Bremelanotide does not meaningfully interact with alcohol, unlike flibanserin (for which the interaction with alcohol is a major barrier to its use). However, bremelanotide does interact with certain medications that people take by mouth. By slowing gastric motility, bremelanotide is thought to reduce the oral absorption (bioavailability) of certain medications, such as naltrexone and indomethacin.

==Pharmacology==

===Pharmacodynamics===
Bremelanotide is a non-selective agonist of the melanocortin receptors, MC1 through MC5 (with the exception of MC2, the receptor of ), but acting primarily as an MC3 and MC4 receptor agonist.

===Pharmacokinetics===
The bioavailability of bremelanotide with subcutaneous injection is about 100%. Following a subcutaneous injection of bremelanotide, maximal levels occur after about one hour, with a range of 0.5 to 1.0 hours. The plasma protein binding of bremelanotide is 21%. Bremelanotide is metabolized via hydrolysis of its peptide bonds. The elimination half-life of bremelanotide is 2.7 hours, with a range of 1.9 to 4.0 hours. Bremelanotide is excreted 64.8% in urine and 22.8% in feces.

==Chemistry==
Bremelanotide is a cyclic heptapeptide lactam analogue of α-melanocyte-stimulating hormone (α-MSH). It has the amino acid sequence Ac-Nle-&quot;cyclo&quot;[Asp-His--Phe-Arg-Trp-Lys]-OH, and is also known as (a substitutional name). Bremelanotide is an active metabolite of melanotan II that lacks the C-terminal amide group.

Aside from melanotan II and endogenous melanocyte-stimulating hormones like α-MSH, other peptide analogues of the same family as bremelanotide include afamelanotide (NDP-α-MSH), modimelanotide, and setmelanotide.

==History==
Studies in the early 1960s showed that administration of α-MSH caused sexual arousal in rats, sparking interest in α-MSH. In the 1980s, scientists at University of Arizona began developing α-MSH and analogs as potential sunless tanning agents. They synthesized and tested several analogs, including peptides they subsequently named, melanotan-I and melanotan II.

Very early in the process one of the scientists, Mac Hadley, who was conducting experiments on himself with the peptide melanotan II, injected himself with twice the dose he intended and experienced an eight-hour erection, along with nausea and vomiting.

To pursue the tanning agent, melanotan-I was licensed by Competitive Technologies, a technology transfer company operating on behalf of University of Arizona, to an Australian startup called Epitan, which changed its name to Clinuvel in 2006.

To pursue the sexual dysfunction agent, melanotan II was licensed by Competitive Technologies to Palatin Technologies. Palatin ceased development of melanotan-II in 2000, and synthesized, patented, and began to develop bremelanotide, a likely metabolite of melanotan-II that differs from melanotan-II in that it has a hydroxyl group where melanotan-II has an amide. Competitive Technologies sued Palatin for breach of contract and to try to claim ownership of bremelanotide; the parties settled in 2008, with Palatin retaining rights to bremelanotide, returning rights to melanotan-II to Competitive Technologies, and paying $800,000.

In August 2004, Palatin signed an agreement with King Pharmaceuticals to co-develop bremelanotide in the US and jointly license it outside the US; King paid Palatin $20M upfront.

Palatin conducted Phase II trials of intranasal bremelanotide in both female sexual dysfunction (FSD) and male erectile dysfunction (ED) but these trials were halted by the FDA in 2007, due to increased blood pressure in clinical trial subjects; Palatin stopped development of the intranasal formulation in 2008. Four trials were conducted in ED, the last being a Phase IIb published in 2008. King terminated the co-development agreement shortly after the FDA halted the trials.

The drug was then reformulated to be delivered by injection and trials continued in FSD. A phase II dose-finding trial in FSD in which the drug was administered 45 minutes before sex showed promise at the highest dose and only transient signs of high blood pressure; two Phase III trials were launched at the end of 2014. Palatin launched the Phase III trials with bremelanotide administered via an autoinjector.

In 2014, Palatin licensed European rights to bremelanotide to Gedeon Richter Plc. for around $10 million, and Palatin received a milestone payment of around $3 million when it started the Phase III trials in the US. In September 2016, Palatin and Gedeon RIchter terminated that agreement.

In November 2016, Palatin announced results of the Phase III trials, and shortly thereafter began seeking a partner to complete development in the US. In January 2017, Palatin and AMAG Pharmaceuticals agreed that AMAG exclusively would complete development and market bremelanotide in North America and the two would work together to license it in other territories; AMAG agreed to pay $60 million upfront, up to $80 million in regulatory milestones, up to $300 million in sales milestones, and tiered royalties ranging from high single digit to low double digit percentages.

A New Drug Application of bremelanotide for female sexual dysfunction was accepted by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in June 2018, with a Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) goal date set for 23 March 2019. It was approved for use in the United States in June 2019.

<doc id="779888" wikidata="Q7238970" url="?curid=779888" title="Pray for Rain (band)">
<text>Pray for Rain is a San Francisco, California-based music production company and recording group specialising in film soundtracks, led by St. Louis, Missouri musician Dan Wool. Past members of Pray for Rain include Gary Brown, Paul Trupin, and James Woody. Originally a performing post-punk band active in San Francisco in the 1980s and 1990s, Pray for Rain transitioned to being a soundtrack-collective after scoring the film &quot;Sid and Nancy&quot;. 

Among their many soundtracks are the scores to several Alex Cox films, including &quot;Sid and Nancy&quot;, &quot;Straight to Hell&quot;, &quot;The Winner&quot;, &quot;Death and the Compass&quot;, and &quot;Three Businessmen&quot;. They also worked on the music for the 1998 David Schwimmer film &quot;Since You&#x27;ve Been Gone&quot;, the 1998 film &quot;Standoff&quot;, and the Fox TV series &quot;Key West&quot;. 

In 1992, Pray for Rain threatened a lawsuit against Christian rock group Pray for Rain, who then shortened their name to PFR, allowing Pray for Rain to retain the name.

<doc id="779889" wikidata="Q449857" url="?curid=779889" title="Promised Land (1996 TV series)">
<text>Promised Land is an American drama television series that aired on CBS from September 17, 1996, to May 20, 1999. It is a spin-off from another series, &quot;Touched by an Angel&quot;. The series was cancelled after its third season, spanning a total of sixty-nine episodes.

==Plot==
&quot;Promised Land&quot; had an ensemble cast, which featured Russell Greene (Gerald McRaney) who was on a divine mission. In the premiere episode, which aired as a special episode of &quot;Touched by an Angel&quot;, angels Tess (Della Reese) and Monica (Roma Downey) asked Russell, recently laid off from his factory job, to &quot;redefine what it means to be a good neighbor and recapture the American dream.&quot; To do this, Russell and his family traveled around the country in a beat up Airstream trailer, helping people in need, looking for work, and learning from their experiences.

Russell&#x27;s family included his wife Claire (Wendy Phillips), who was licensed to homeschool their kids while they were on the road; his mother Hattie (Celeste Holm), who updated a hand-embroidered map to show all places they had traveled; teenage son Josh (Austin O&#x27;Brien); daughter Dinah (Sarah Schaub); and young nephew Nathaniel (Eddie Karr), who had been abandoned by Russell&#x27;s troubled brother Joe (Richard Thomas). Erasmus was an old friend of the family who lived in Chickory Creek, the small town in Kentucky where Hattie grew up. The family frequently returned to Chickory Creek to celebrate holidays and to rest. Occasionally they were assisted by Tess or other angels while they tried to help people overcome their personal problems or rekindle their lapsed faith.

Early in the second season, Claire found out that she was pregnant, but tragically their infant daughter, Grace, died soon after her birth in the season&#x27;s final episode. In the third season, the family decided to settle down and moved into a run-down small house in a poor neighborhood in Denver, Colorado. Russell convinced the owner to let them live there rent free in exchange for the renovations he made to the house. Claire got a job as a guidance counselor at the local high school, where Josh and Dinah enrolled as students. Russell volunteered at the Ridley Center, a neighborhood teen center. Living next door to the Greenes in Denver were Shamaya and her teenage brother L.T., a former gang member who was struggling with trying to go straight. Josh&#x27;s girlfriend was Bobbie, an unwed mother with an infant son, and Dinah had a friend named Margot, who enjoyed the 1940s era and its fashions in particular. In the series&#x27; final episode, Hattie married an old friend of the family and Russell quit the Ridley Center to take a job as a police officer.

Most of the third season was spent in Denver, Colorado, but—much like &quot;Touched by an Angel&quot;—it was filmed in Salt Lake City, Utah.

==Episodes==

==Production==
The pilot episode was filmed in the spring of 1996 by the crew of &quot;Touched by an Angel&quot; at the conclusion of production of the latter&#x27;s second season. The pilot episode took place primarily in the fictional town of Chickory Creek, Kentucky but the actual location was Springville, Utah.

Because &quot;Touched by an Angel&quot; continued production for a third season, a new crew was hired for production of the &quot;Promised Land&quot; series. In the meantime, parts of the pilot episode were re-written and two characters from the original pilot episode were recast. Originally, the part of Hattie Greene was played by Peg Phillips. Celeste Holm replaced her in the cast. The part of Nathaniel Greene was also recast with Eddie Karr playing the role in the new version of the pilot and throughout the series. The newly hired crew of &quot;Promised Land&quot; spent six days reshooting portions of the pilot episode in July 1996.

The storyline of the series called for the Greene family to travel throughout the United States, so northern Utah served as a stand-in for many states. As was the case with &quot;Touched by an Angel&quot;, the crew&#x27;s filming locations were usually within a two-hour drive from downtown Salt Lake City. However, during each of the first two seasons, three episodes were filmed in and around Saint George, Utah. During the third season, three episodes were filmed in and around Natchez, Mississippi (in August and September 1998).

==Cancellation==
After the show&#x27;s third season in 1999, the show was cancelled by CBS due to low ratings and not the controversial school shooting episode &quot;A Day in the Life&quot; scheduled to air two days after the Columbine shooting. According to then CBS president, Nancy Tellem, she states the following on the show&#x27;s cancellation: &quot;We were looking at it to see how it was growing, as we normally do with all our shows, and, unfortunately, it wasn&#x27;t growing. And, as much as we tried to change the emphasis -- instead of it being a Winnebago going across the country we placed it in an urban setting -- it just wasn&#x27;t performing.&quot;

The last episode, simply titled &quot;Finale&quot; aired on May 20, 1999. The characters of the Greene family were never seen or mentioned again on the parent show &quot;Touched by an Angel&quot; which continued on for four more years, ending in 2003. Recurring actor Ossie Davis returned to the show on a recurring basis, but not as his Erasmus Jones character, but instead playing an angel named Gabriel.

==Broadcast==
The series aired Tuesdays at 8:00 pm (EST) on CBS for its first season and Thursdays at 8:00 pm (EST) for the rest of its run.

==Home media==
In May 2018, Visual Entertainment released &quot;Promised Land: The Complete Collection&quot; on DVD in Region 1.

<doc id="779891" wikidata="Q673367" url="?curid=779891" title="Arkenu structures">
<text>The Arkenu structures, also known as the Arkenu craters, are a pair of prominent circular geological structures in eastern Libya. The structures are approximately and in diameter, and lie about west of Jabal Arkanu on the eastern margin of the al-Kufrah Basin. 

It has been argued that both structures were formed by simultaneous meteorite impacts. Field investigations by Dr. P. Paillou, Dr. A. Rosenqvist, and others reported the presence of impact breccias at the structures&#x27; bottoms, shatter cones pointing toward the center of the structures, and microscopic planar deformation features found in quartz grains of sandstones outcropping in the structures. Based on these reports and other observations, it was proposed that both structures are extraterrestrial impact craters that were formed simultaneously as a double impact event less than 140 million years ago (Jurassic or younger). 

More recently, on the basis of field, petrographic, and textural observations, it has been argued that the Arkenu structures are not in fact extraterrestrial impact craters. Field studies found a lack of identifiable shatter cones at both structures. Instead, the striations which were previously reported as shatter cones were identified as ventifacts created by wind erosion in sandstones. These striations are surficial features that are unrelated to fracturing of the sandstone, are consistently oriented with the prevailing Holocene wind patterns, and occur within and outside of, even distal to, both of the Arkenu structures. In addition, detailed petrographic analyses of rock samples from both of the Arkenu structures found a lack of any microscopic effect of shock metamorphism including a lack of planar deformation features in quartz grains and evidence of impact melting, or presence of glass. A lack of any apparent differences between the sedimentary rocks outcropping inside and outside these circular structures was found. Finally, field observations found silicified sandstone dikes and igneous rocks, such as syenite, porphyries, tephrites, phonolites, and lamprophyres (monchiquites) directly associated with each circular feature. Based on these and other observations, it was concluded that the Arkenu structures are stocks of porphyritic syenitic that have intruded the Nubia Formation to form rather simple and eroded ring dike complexes. Hydrothermal activity that followed the intrusion of these ring dike complexes resulted in the formation of massive magnetite–hematite deposits and dikes of silicified sandstone. As a result of this research, the Arkenu structures were removed from and are currently not listed in the Earth Impact Database.

<text>Avak is an impact crater centered approximately southeast of Utqiagvik, Alaska, United States.

Avak is a subcircular structure about in diameter and deep. In the structure, metamorphic basement rocks and regionally flat lying sedimentary rocks are uplifted and intensely deformed. The Avak structure has no surface expression in the swampy, lake-dotted tundra of the Arctic coastal plain. The structure is covered by a thin veneer of permanently frozen Pliocene and Pleistocene rock. This means that the age of the impact took place anywhere between 3 million and 95 million years ago. Palynological data on its ejecta suggest Middle–Late Turonian age of the impact (about 90 million years ago).

The Avak structure provides the structural trap for the natural gas in the adjacent South Barrow and East Barrow gas fields. These fields have accumulated about 37 bcf of natural gas in Jurassic sandstones.

==History==
The Avak structure was first recognized from seismic surveys in the National Petroleum Reserve No. 4 (NPR4) by the U.S. Navy during the period from 1943 to 1953. The Navy drilled the Avak 1 well in 1951–1952 and encountered deformed rocks from near the surface to a total depth of . Shatter cones and other evidence of impact origin was found.

In 1995, geologists from the Geological Survey of Canada and U.S. Geological Survey found another group of mineralogic features that indicated that Avak is a meteorite impact structure: the planar deformation features.

<text>The National Progressive Party (; ) was a liberal political party in Finland from 1918 to 1951. The party was founded 8 December 1918, after the Finnish Civil War, by the republican majority of the Young Finnish Party and the republican minority of the Finnish Party (the next day the monarchists of both parties founded the National Coalition Party.)

In December 1918, the National Progressive Party adopted a social liberal programme that contained a wide range of progressive proposals. Amongst others, these included land reform, state job creation work and unemployment schemes, state participation in the provision of housing-building schemes and compulsory sickness insurance pensions, legislation guaranteeing contracts, conditions of work and a minimum wage, and a progressive income and wealth tax to pay for this social reform programme. As noted by one study, “The spirit of the NPP’s programme, in short, was clearly that of social liberalism.” Later programmes adopted by the National Progressive Party contained a number of reformist proposals as well.

Famous members of the party included Kaarlo Juho Ståhlberg and Risto Ryti, the first and fifth Presidents of Finland, and Sakari Tuomioja.

The National Progressive Party finished its existence in early 1951, as most of its active members had joined the People&#x27;s Party of Finland. A minority group including Sakari Tuomioja founded the Liberal League.

<doc id="779902" wikidata="Q917318" url="?curid=779902" title="Tōru Furuya">
<text>is a Japanese voice actor and narrator. As a child, he was a member of Gekidan Himawari, a children&#x27;s acting troupe. He is currently employed by the talent management firm Aoni Production, since 1982.

Furuya is most known for the anime roles of Amuro Ray (&quot;Gundam&quot;), Hyūma Hoshi (&quot;Star of the Giants&quot;), Pegasus Seiya (&quot;Saint Seiya&quot;), Yamcha (&quot;Dragon Ball&quot;), Kyōsuke Kasuga (&quot;Kimagure Orange Road&quot;) and Tuxedo Mask (&quot;Sailor Moon&quot;). He considers these roles as his most important roles. He also voiced Mario in several anime and commercials, starting with the film &quot;Super Mario Bros.: The Great Mission to Rescue Princess Peach!&quot; (1986).

He also used a pseudonym in the cast of &quot;Mobile Suit Gundam 00&quot; for Ribbons Almark&#x27;s role (but used his real name in the narration role) and in the casting of &quot;Sekai-ichi Hatsukoi&quot; for Zen Kirishima. Both the narration role and Ribbons Almark were Furuya&#x27;s first role in a non-Universal Century Gundam series. He is also the best known official dubbing voice for Hong Kong action film actor, Yuen Biao.

==Personal life==
Furuya married voice actress Mami Koyama in 1976; they later divorced in 1983. He married Satomi Majima on March 23, 1985. 

On May 22, 2024, Furuya posted a public apology to Twitter, confirming a recent report and interview in &quot;Shūkan Bunshun&quot; magazine in which it was reported that he had an extramarital affair with a female fan 37 years his junior for around four and a half years, until September 2023. He admitted to striking her once, as well as pressuring her into having an abortion. 

Because of this, his Showroom program was abruptly cancelled and he was dropped from &quot;&quot; with all of his characters getting recast. 

On June 22, 2024, Furuya announced that he would step down from his roles in &quot;Detective Conan&quot; and &quot;One Piece&quot;. On June 28, 2024, Bandai Namco began considering to employ a new voice actor to portray Amuro Ray for later works in the &quot;Gundam&quot; series in the wake of Furuya&#x27;s affair being made public. On October 4, 2024, Toei Animation announced that the role of Yamcha had been recast to Ryōta Suzuki for &quot;Dragon Ball Daima&quot;.

==Appearances==
Furuya was featured as a guest at Tsukino-Con in British Columbia in February 2017. Furuya was going to be featured as a guest at MomoCon 2024, but his appearance was cancelled due to the affair/abuse scandal.

<text>The BP Structure, also known as Gebel Dalma, is an exposed impact crater in Libya. It is so called because it was identified by a BP (then British Petroleum) geological survey team.

French &quot;et al.&quot; state that the BP Structure and the larger Oasis crater, about to the south, were probably simultaneous impacts. Both impacts deform the Nubian Sandstone of early Cretaceous age.

<doc id="779908" wikidata="Q589217" url="?curid=779908" title="Malvern Wells">
<text>Malvern Wells is a village and civil parish south of Great Malvern in the Malvern Hills district of Worcestershire, England. The parish, once known as South Malvern, was formed in 1894 from parts of the civil parishes of Hanley Castle, Welland, and the former parish of Great Malvern, and owes its development to the 19th-century boom years of Malvern as a spa town. Malvern Wells is a centre of commercial bottling of Malvern water. The population of the parishes of Malvern Wells and Little Malvern was recorded in 2011 as 3,196.

==Etymology==
The name &quot;Malvern&quot; is first attested in a charter of around 1030, as &quot;Mælfern&quot;, and then in the Domesday Book of 1086 as &quot;Malferna&quot;. The name derives from the Common Brittonic words that survive in modern Welsh as (&quot;bare&quot;) and (&quot;hill&quot;); thus it once meant &quot;bare hill&quot;. The name perhaps applied originally to the hill now called Worcester Beacon, after which Great Malvern and later Little Malvern, West Malvern, and the Malvern Hills were then named. The name &quot;Malvern Wells&quot; takes its name from these places, first being attested in 1831.

==Location==
Malvern Wells lies on the eastern slopes of the Malvern Hills south of Great Malvern (the town centre of Malvern) and north of Little Malvern. It takes its name from the Malvern water issuing from springs on the hills, principally from the Holy Well and the Eye Well. The northern end of the parish includes the Wyche Cutting, the historic salt route pass through the hills, which form the border between the counties of Herefordshire (on the western side) and Worcestershire. The actual cutting through the granite hill face is at a height of 856 feet above sea level.

The northern part of the parish includes the &quot;Fruitlands&quot; housing estate. In the southern part of the parish is the settlement of Upper Welland and in the western part the settlements of Upper Wyche and Lower Wyche. To the east of the village of Malvern Wells and also in the parish is the Three Counties Showground.
==History==

===Wells===
In 1558 Queen Elizabeth I granted the land to John Hornyold, lord of the manor, under the premise that any pilgrim or traveller should be able to draw rest and refreshment from the Holy Well, a covenant which still stands today. The first record of spring water being bottled in the UK is from 1622, at Holy Well. Holy Well was later used by the Schweppes Company as the source for bottled Malvern Water sold at the Great Exhibition of 1851.

===Railway history===
Malvern Wells railway station, as part of the Worcester and Hereford Railway (which became part of the West Midland Railway then the Great Western Railway), opened on 25 May 1860, then closed again on 19 January 1861 before reopening 1 February 1864. It was closed finally on 5 April 1965.

Previously served by Malvern Hanley Road railway station on the Tewkesbury and Malvern Railway was a branch of the Midland Railway which ran from Ashchurch via Tewkesbury to Great Malvern. This opened on 16 May 1864. With the regrouping in 1923, it became part of the London Midland and Scottish Railway. The section from Malvern to Upton-upon-Severn was closed in December 1952. The remainder closed to passengers on 14 August 1961. Freight continued to be carried to Upton until July 1963 and to Tewkesbury until December 1964.
===All Saints===
All Saints, the parish church, was built by a local builder, William Porter, to a design by Troyte Griffith – a friend of Edward Elgar who is depicted in the &quot;Enigma Variations&quot;. The church was consecrated on 19 November 1903. There is evidence to suggest that Elgar composed part of the &quot;Enigma Variations&quot; in the church, but his offer of the original manuscript of his oratorio &quot;The Apostles&quot;, as a gift to the church, was refused by the Anglican church authorities because Elgar was a Roman Catholic and the oratorio was heavily based in that tradition. Next to the church is the Wyche School; &quot;Land of Hope and Glory&quot;, set to Elgar&#x27;s Pomp and Circumstance March No. 1, was first performed there in the presence of Elgar. In later life Elgar came to tire of the work for &quot;its jingoism and the fact it overshadowed everything else he wrote.&quot;

==Amenities==
The Malvern Wells War Memorial honours local people killed and injured in the First and Second World Wars. It was designed by the Arts and Crafts architect and designer C. F. A. Voysey, and was unveiled in 1920. The village has a petrol station, a convenience store, a post office and several other small businesses.

==Education==
Abbey College, a secondary school and English language centre mainly for international students, is found at 253 Wells Road. Primary education is provided by Malvern Wells Church of England School and the Wyche Church of England School, which feed the two Malvern secondary schools of The Chase in Barnards Green, and Dyson Perrins in Malvern Link. Wells House School, a preparatory school for boys, closed in 1991.

==Transport==
The nearer of the two Malvern railway stations to the village is Great Malvern on the Worcester to Hereford line. It has services to Birmingham and to London Paddington station. The village is served by a daily long-distance coach service between Worcester and London Victoria. There are regular bus links with Great Malvern and Malvern Link.

<text>The Beaverhead impact structure is the second largest impact structure within the U.S. It lies within the states of Idaho and Montana. Estimated at in diameter, it is the ninth largest impact crater on Earth.

With an estimated age of 600 million years (Neoproterozoic), the impact&#x27;s original shatter cones along the impact structure&#x27;s perimeter provide some of the structure&#x27;s only remaining visible evidence.

It is named for the Beaverhead region of southwestern Montana in which it was first discovered.

<doc id="779914" wikidata="Q7377710" url="?curid=779914" title="Rudy Wurlitzer">
<text>Rudolph &quot;Rudy&quot; Wurlitzer (born January 3, 1937) is an American novelist and screenwriter.

Wurlitzer&#x27;s fiction includes &quot;Nog&quot;, &quot;Flats&quot;, &quot;Quake&quot;, &quot;Slow Fade&quot;, and &quot;Drop Edge of Yonder&quot;. He is also the author of the travel memoir, &quot;Hard Travel to Sacred Places&quot;, an account of his spiritual journey through Asia after the death of his wife Lynn Davis&#x27;s 21-year-old son.

==Biography==

Wurlitzer was born in Cincinnati, Ohio, but the family moved to New York City shortly after his birth. He is a descendant of Rudolph Wurlitzer (1831–1914), founder of the jukebox company of the same name, but the family fortune had long since been diminished by the time Wurlitzer came of age in the 1950s. When he was 17, he found work on an oil tanker and it was on this first trip he began to write. He spent time at Columbia University and in the Army, and continued to travel, spending time in Paris, and on Majorca where he worked as a secretary for author Robert Graves. He credits Graves with teaching him how to &quot;write short sentences.&quot; He returned to New York City in the mid 1960s where he met and befriended the artists Claes Oldenburg, Robert Frank, and Philip Glass, all of whom he collaborated with at some point. He is married to photographer Lynn Davis and splits his time between homes in upstate New York and Nova Scotia.

==Novels==

Wurlitzer&#x27;s first novel was the highly experimental and psychedelic &quot;Nog&quot; (1968) which was compared to the work of Thomas Pynchon. It was followed by the minimalist, Beckett-influenced &quot;Flats&quot; in 1970. &quot;Quake,&quot; published in 1974, takes place in a post-apocalyptic Los Angeles where mankind&#x27;s worst impulses are acted out in one long, unbroken narrative. 1984&#x27;s &quot;Slow Fade&quot;, also dealing with Hollywood, is a portrait of an aging, once-brilliant film director attempting to make peace with his demons and his past. It has been suggested that &quot;Slow Fade&quot; was influenced by Wurlitzer&#x27;s time with director Sam Peckinpah on the set of &quot;Pat Garrett &amp; Billy the Kid&quot;, for which he wrote the screenplay. His most recent novel is &quot;The Drop Edge Of Yonder&quot;, which had its origins in a screenplay called &quot;Zebulon&quot; that had existed in various versions over the years. Directors Peckinpah, and Hal Ashby were attached to the project at some point, but the film was never made.

==Screenplays and other work==

Wurlitzer&#x27;s first script &quot;Glen and Randa&quot;, co-written with Jim McBride and released in 1969, was another take on a post-apocalyptic world. At some point, Monte Hellman, who had been directing films for Roger Corman read Wurlitzer&#x27;s novel &quot;Nog&quot; and approached him about writing the screenplay for &quot;Two-Lane Blacktop&quot;. The film became a cult-classic, and the script was printed in its entirety in the April 1971 issue of &quot;Esquire&quot;. During his time in Hollywood, Wurlitzer also wrote the screenplays &quot;Walker&quot; (1987) directed by Alex Cox, &quot;Candy Mountain&quot; (1988) which he co-directed with Robert Frank, and &quot;Little Buddha&quot; (1993) directed by Bernardo Bertolucci. Wurlitzer was working on a script with Michelangelo Antonioni at the time of Antonioni&#x27;s death.

He wrote the libretto for Philip Glass&#x27;s opera &quot;In the Penal Colony&quot;, and has also written four television scripts for &quot;100 Centre Street&quot;, directed by Sidney Lumet.

<text>The Boltysh crater or Bovtyshka crater is a buried impact crater in the Kirovohrad Oblast of Ukraine, near the village of Bovtyshka. The crater is in diameter and its age of 65.39 ± 0.14/0.16 million years, based on argon-argon dating techniques, less than 1 million years younger than Chicxulub crater in Mexico and the Cretaceous–Paleogene boundary (K–Pg boundary). The Chicxulub impact is believed to have caused the mass extinction at the end of the Cretaceous period, which included the extinction of the non-avian dinosaurs. The Boltysh crater is currently thought to be unrelated to the Chicxulub impact, and to have not generated major global environmental effects.

== Overview ==
Boltysh crater is located in central Ukraine, in the basin of the Tiasmyn River, a tributary of the Dnieper River. It is in diameter, and is surrounded by an ejecta blanket of breccia preserved over an area of . It is estimated that immediately after the impact, ejecta covered an area of to a depth of or greater, and was some deep at the crater rim.

The crater contains a central uplift about in diameter, rising about above the base level of the crater. This uplift currently lies beneath about of sediment deposited since the impact, and was discovered in the 1960s during oil shale deposits exploration.

== Age ==
The Boltysh depression was identified as a fossil meteorite crater by 1975. By 1987, it was dated to 100 ± 12 million years old. Early age estimates could only be roughly constrained between the age of the impacted rocks (the target) and the age of overlying sediments. The target rocks date from the Cenomanian (98.9 to 93.5 million years ago) and Turonian (93.5 to 89 million years ago) epochs. Bore samples of sediments overlying the crater contain fossils dating from the Paleocene epoch, 66 to 54.8 million years ago. The age of the crater was thus constrained to between 54 and 98 million years.

Subsequent radiometric dating reduced the uncertainty. The concentration of decay products in impact glasses from the crater were used to derive an age of 65.04 ± 1.10 million years. A 2002 analysis of argon radioactive decay products yielded an age of 65.17 ± 0.64 million years. While these radiometric dating measurements place the Boltysh crater hundreds of thousands of years after the Chicxulub crater, a 2010 radiometric and palynological study of fern spore (fern spikes) abundance suggested the Boltysh impact may have occurred several thousand years before Chicxulub. However, in response, a follow-up study in 2021 estimated using argon–argon dating that Boltysh formed about 65.39 ± 0.14/0.16 million years ago, 650,000 years after the Chicxulub catastrophe, and suggested that the fern spike was plausibly a result of the impact itself. The authors of the paper suggested that the impact may have disrupted recovery after the K/Pg extinction.

<text>Johann Goldsmid, better known by his Latinized name Johann(es) Fabricius (8 January 1587 – 19 March 1616), eldest son of David Fabricius (1564–1617), was a Frisian/German astronomer and a modern era discoverer of sunspots in 1611, preceded by Thomas Harriot and followed by Galileo Galilei.

==Biography==
Johannes was born in Resterhafe (East Friesland). He studied at the University of Helmstedt, Wittenberg University and graduated from Leiden University in 1611. He returned from university in the Netherlands with telescopes that he and his father turned on the Sun. Despite the difficulties of observing the Sun directly with a telescope, they noted the existence of sunspots, one of the first confirmed instance of such observations telescopically; sunspots had first been identified without telescopes in ancient China and Greece. Johannes first observed a sunspot on February 27, 1611; in Wittenberg in that year he published the results of his observations in his 22-page pamphlet &quot;De Maculis in Sole observatis...&quot;. It was the first publication on the topic of sunspots.

The pair soon used camera obscura telescopy so as to save their eyes and get a better view of the solar disk, and observed that the spots moved. They would appear on the eastern edge of the disk, steadily move to the western edge, disappear, then reappear at the east again after the same amount of time that it had taken for it to cross the disk in the first place.

He is also mentioned in Jules Verne&#x27;s 1865 novel &quot;From the Earth to the Moon&quot; as someone who claimed to have seen lunar inhabitants through his telescope, though that particular fact is merely part of Verne&#x27;s fiction. The large () Fabricius crater, on the Moon&#x27;s southern hemisphere, is named after his father, David Fabricius.

He died in Marienhafe, at the age of 29.

==Legacy==
In 1895, a monument was erected to his memory in the churchyard at Osteel, where his father had been pastor from 1603 until 1616.

<text>Boxhole is a young impact crater located approximately 180 km (265 km by road) north-east of Alice Springs in the Northern Territory, Australia. It is 170 metres in diameter and its age is estimated to be 5,400 ± 1,500 years based on the cosmogenic 14C terrestrial age of the meteorite, placing it in the Holocene. The crater is exposed to the surface.

== Description ==
In 1937 Joe Webb, a shearer at Boxhole sheep station, took geologist Cecil Madigan to examine the crater. Madigan discovered nickel-bearing metallic fragments and iron shale-balls similar to those found at Henbury to the south of Alice Springs. It was the second impact crater to be described in Australia, after Henbury.
A later search found additional meteoritic metal including an iron mass of 181 pounds (82 kg) , now in the Natural History Museum, London.

<doc id="779929" wikidata="Q3123150" url="?curid=779929" title="Neutron generator">
<text>Neutron generators are neutron source devices which contain compact linear particle accelerators and that produce neutrons by fusing isotopes of hydrogen together. The fusion reactions take place in these devices by accelerating either deuterium, tritium, or a mixture of these two isotopes into a metal hydride target which also contains deuterium, tritium or a mixture of these isotopes. Fusion of deuterium atoms (D + D) results in the formation of a helium-3 ion and a neutron with a kinetic energy of approximately 2.5 MeV. Fusion of a deuterium and a tritium atom (D + T) results in the formation of a helium-4 ion and a neutron with a kinetic energy of approximately 14.1 MeV. Neutron generators have applications in medicine, security, and materials analysis.

The basic concept was first developed by Ernest Rutherford&#x27;s team in the Cavendish Laboratory in the early 1930s. Using a linear accelerator driven by a Cockcroft–Walton generator, Mark Oliphant led an experiment that fired deuterium ions into a deuterium-infused metal foil and noticed that a small number of these particles gave off alpha particles. This was the first demonstration of nuclear fusion, as well as the first discovery of Helium-3 and tritium, created in these reactions. The introduction of new power sources has continually shrunk the size of these machines, from Oliphant&#x27;s that filled the corner of the lab, to modern machines that are highly portable. Thousands of such small, relatively inexpensive systems have been built over the past five decades.

While neutron generators do produce fusion reactions, the number of accelerated ions that cause these reactions is very low. It can be easily demonstrated that the energy released by these reactions is many times lower than the energy needed to accelerate the ions, so there is no possibility of these machines being used to produce net fusion power. A related concept, colliding beam fusion, attempts to address this issue using two accelerators firing at each other.

==Neutron generator theory and operation==
Small neutron generators using the deuterium (D, hydrogen-2, 2H) tritium (T, hydrogen-3, 3H) fusion reactions are the most common accelerator based (as opposed to radioactive isotopes) neutron sources. In these systems, neutrons are produced by creating ions of deuterium, tritium, or deuterium and tritium and accelerating these into a hydride target loaded with deuterium, or deuterium and tritium. The DT reaction is used more than the DD reaction because the yield of the DT reaction is 50–100 times higher than that of the DD reaction.

D + T → n + 4He En = 14.1 MeV

D + D → n + 3He En = 2.5 MeV

Neutrons produced by DD and DT reactions are emitted somewhat anisotropically from the target, slightly biased in the forward (in the axis of the ion beam) direction. The anisotropy of the neutron emission from DD and DT reactions arises from the fact the reactions are isotropic in the center of momentum coordinate system (COM) but this isotropy is lost in the transformation from the COM coordinate system to the laboratory frame of reference. In both frames of reference, the He nuclei recoil in the opposite direction to the emitted neutron consistent with the law of conservation of momentum.

The gas pressure in the ion source region of the neutron tubes generally ranges between 0.1 and 0.01 mm Hg. The mean free path of electrons must be shorter than the discharge space to achieve ionization (lower limit for pressure) while the pressure must be kept low enough to avoid formation of discharges at the high extraction voltages applied between the electrodes. The pressure in the accelerating region, however, has to be much lower, as the mean free path of electrons must be longer to prevent formation of a discharge between the high voltage electrodes.

The ion accelerator usually consists of several electrodes with cylindrical symmetry, acting as an einzel lens. The ion beam can thus be focused to a small point at the target. The accelerators typically require power supplies of 100–500 kV. They usually have several stages, with voltage between the stages not exceeding 200 kV to prevent field emission.

In comparison with radionuclide neutron sources, neutron tubes can produce much higher neutron fluxes and consistent (monochromatic) neutron energy spectra can be obtained. The neutron production rate can also be controlled.

==Sealed neutron tubes==

The central part of a neutron generator is the particle accelerator itself, sometimes called a neutron tube. Neutron tubes have several components including an ion source, ion optic elements, and a beam target; all of these are enclosed within a vacuum-tight enclosure. High voltage insulation between the ion optical elements of the tube is provided by glass and/or ceramic insulators. The neutron tube is, in turn, enclosed in a metal housing, the accelerator head, which is filled with a dielectric medium to insulate the high voltage elements of the tube from the operating area. The accelerator and ion source high voltages are provided by external power supplies. The control console allows the operator to adjust the operating parameters of the neutron tube. The power supplies and control equipment are normally located within of the accelerator head in laboratory instruments, but may be several kilometers away in well logging instruments.

In comparison with their predecessors, sealed neutron tubes do not require vacuum pumps and gas sources for operation. They are therefore more mobile and compact, while also durable and reliable. For example, sealed neutron tubes have replaced radioactive modulated neutron initiators, in supplying a pulse of neutrons to the imploding core of modern nuclear weapons.

Examples of neutron tube ideas date as far back as the 1930s, pre-nuclear weapons era, by German scientists filing a 1938 German patent (March 1938, patent #261,156) and obtaining a United States Patent (July 1941, USP #2,251,190); examples of present state of the art are given by developments such as the Neutristor, a mostly solid state device, resembling a computer chip, invented at Sandia National Laboratories in Albuquerque NM. Typical sealed designs are used in a pulsed mode and can be operated at different output levels, depending on the life from the ion source and loaded targets.

==Ion sources==

A good ion source should provide a strong ion beam without consuming much of the gas. For hydrogen isotopes, production of atomic ions is favored over molecular ions, as atomic ions have higher neutron yield on collision. The ions generated in the ion source are then extracted by an electric field into the accelerator region, and accelerated towards the target. The gas consumption is chiefly caused by the pressure difference between the ion generating and ion accelerating spaces that has to be maintained. Ion currents of 10 mA at gas consumptions of 40 cm3/hour are achievable.

For a sealed neutron tube, the ideal ion source should use low gas pressure, give high ion current with large proportion of atomic ions, have low gas clean-up, use low power, have high reliability and high lifetime, its construction has to be simple and robust and its maintenance requirements have to be low.

Gas can be efficiently stored in a replenisher, an electrically heated coil of zirconium wire. Its temperature determines the rate of absorption/desorption of hydrogen by the metal, which regulates the pressure in the enclosure.

The Penning source is a low gas pressure, cold cathode ion source which utilizes crossed electric and magnetic fields. The ion source anode is at a positive potential, either dc or pulsed, with respect to the source cathode. The ion source voltage is normally between 2 and 7 kilovolts. A magnetic field, oriented parallel to the source axis, is produced by a permanent magnet. A plasma is formed along the axis of the anode which traps electrons which, in turn, ionize gas in the source. The ions are extracted through the exit cathode. Under normal operation, the ion species produced by the Penning source are over 90% molecular ions. This disadvantage is however compensated for by the other advantages of the system.

One of the cathodes is a cup made of soft iron, enclosing most of the discharge space. The bottom of the cup has a hole through which most of the generated ions are ejected by the magnetic field into the acceleration space. The soft iron shields the acceleration space from the magnetic field, to prevent a breakdown.

Ions emerging from the exit cathode are accelerated through the potential difference between the exit cathode and the accelerator electrode. The schematic indicates that the exit cathode is at ground potential and the target is at high (negative) potential. This is the case in many sealed tube neutron generators. However, in cases when it is desired to deliver the maximum flux to a sample, it is desirable to operate the neutron tube with the target grounded and the source floating at high (positive) potential. The accelerator voltage is normally between 80 and 180 kilovolts.

The accelerating electrode has the shape of a long hollow cylinder. The ion beam has a slightly diverging angle (about 0.1 radian). The electrode shape and distance from target can be chosen so the entire target surface is bombarded with ions. Acceleration voltages of up to 200 kV are achievable.

The ions pass through the accelerating electrode and strike the target. When ions strike the target, 2–3 electrons per ion are produced by secondary emission. In order to prevent these secondary electrons from being accelerated back into the ion source, the accelerator electrode is biased negative with respect to the target. This voltage, called the suppressor voltage, must be at least 500 volts and may be as high as a few kilovolts. Loss of suppressor voltage will result in damage, possibly catastrophic, to the neutron tube.

Some neutron tubes incorporate an intermediate electrode, called the focus or extractor electrode, to control the size of the beam spot on the target. The gas pressure in the source is regulated by heating or cooling the gas reservoir element.

===Radio frequency (RF)===
Ions can be created by electrons formed in high-frequency electromagnetic field. The discharge is formed in a tube located between electrodes, or inside a coil. Over 90% proportion of atomic ions is achievable.

==Targets==

The targets used in neutron generators are thin films of metal such as titanium, scandium, or zirconium which are deposited onto a silver, copper or molybdenum substrate. Titanium, scandium, and zirconium form stable chemical compounds called metal hydrides when combined with hydrogen or its isotopes. These metal hydrides are made up of two hydrogen (deuterium or tritium) atoms per metal atom and allow the target to have extremely high densities of hydrogen. This is important to maximize the neutron yield of the neutron tube. The gas reservoir element also uses metal hydrides, e.g. uranium hydride, as the active material.

Titanium is preferred to zirconium as it can withstand higher temperatures (200 °C), and gives higher neutron yield as it captures deuterons better than zirconium. The maximum temperature allowed for the target, above which hydrogen isotopes undergo desorption and escape the material, limits the ion current per surface unit of the target; slightly divergent beams are therefore used. A 1 microampere ion beam accelerated at 200 kV to a titanium-tritium target can generate up to 108 neutrons per second. The neutron yield is mostly determined by the accelerating voltage and the ion current level.

An example of a tritium target in use is a 0.2 mm thick silver disc with a 1 micrometer layer of titanium deposited on its surface; the titanium is then saturated with tritium.

Metals with sufficiently low hydrogen diffusion can be turned into deuterium targets by bombardment of deuterons until the metal is saturated. Gold targets under such condition show four times higher efficiency than titanium. Even better results can be achieved with targets made of a thin film of a high-absorption high-diffusivity metal (e.g. titanium) on a substrate with low hydrogen diffusivity (e.g. silver), as the hydrogen is then concentrated on the top layer and can not diffuse away into the bulk of the material. Using a deuterium-tritium gas mixture, self-replenishing D-T targets can be made. The neutron yield of such targets is lower than of tritium-saturated targets in deuteron beams, but their advantage is much longer lifetime and constant level of neutron production. Self-replenishing targets are also tolerant to high-temperature bake-out of the tubes, as their saturation with hydrogen isotopes is performed after the bakeout and tube sealing.

==High voltage power supplies==
One approach for generating the high voltage fields needed to accelerate ions in a neutron tube is to use a pyroelectric crystal. In April 2005 researchers at UCLA demonstrated the use of a thermally cycled pyroelectric crystal to generate high electric fields in a neutron generator application. In February 2006 researchers at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute demonstrated the use of two oppositely poled crystals for this application. Using these low-tech power supplies it is possible to generate a sufficiently high electric field gradient across an accelerating gap to accelerate deuterium ions into a deuterated target to produce the D + D fusion reaction. These devices are similar in their operating principle to conventional sealed-tube neutron generators which typically use Cockcroft–Walton type high voltage power supplies. The novelty of this approach is in the simplicity of the high voltage source. Unfortunately, the relatively low accelerating current that pyroelectric crystals can generate, together with the modest pulsing frequencies that can be achieved (a few cycles per minute) limits their near-term application in comparison with today&#x27;s commercial products (see below). Also see pyroelectric fusion.

==Other technologies==

In addition to the conventional neutron generator design described above several other approaches exist to use electrical systems for producing neutrons.

===Inertial electrostatic confinement/fusor===

Another type of innovative neutron generator is the inertial electrostatic confinement fusion device. This neutron generator avoids using a solid target which will be sputter eroded causing metalization of insulating surfaces. Depletion of the reactant gas within the solid target is also avoided. Far greater operational lifetime is achieved. Originally called a fusor, it was invented by Philo Farnsworth, the inventor of electronic television.

== Applications ==

Neutron generators find application in semiconductor production industry. They also have use cases in the enrichment of depleted uranium, acceleration of breeder reactors, and activation and excitement of experimental thorium reactors.

In material analysis neutron activation analysis is used to determine concentration of different elements in mixed materials such as minerals or ores.

<doc id="779935" wikidata="Q909645" url="?curid=779935" title="Brent crater">
<text>The Brent crater is an impact crater in both the geographic township of Deacon, Unorganized South Nipissing District and the municipal township of Papineau-Cameron in Nipissing District, northeastern Ontario, Canada, located north of Cedar Lake in northern Algonquin Provincial Park. It is in diameter and the age is estimated to be ca. 453 million years (Ordovician). The crater can be reached using Brent Road, south of Ontario Highway 17.

A sign, erected at the site by the Archeological and Historic Sites Board, Archives of Ontario, reads:

The Brent Crater: First recognized in 1951 from aerial photographs, the crater is a circular depression about two miles in diameter formed in Precambrian crystalline rocks. Geophysical and diamond drilling investigations show that the crater has a present depth of about 1,400 feet but is partly filled with sedimentary rocks with a thickness of 900 feet. The rocks beneath the crater floor are thoroughly fragmented over a depth of 2,000 feet. Like the similar New Quebec (Chubb) crater, the Brent crater is attributed to the high speed impact of a giant meteorite. It is calculated that the impact released energy equaling 250 megatons of TNT and occurred about 450 million years ago when this area was probably covered by a shallow sea.

There is an observation tower on the rim of the crater. The old wooden tower was demolished in July 2007, because it was not safe to use due to its age. A new tower has been built on a hill directly across the Brent Road from the demolished tower. The new tower on the hill offers a much better panorama of the entire crater. Parking will also be increased as part of the new tower improvements. There is a hiking trail leading to the crater floor. There are two small lakes, Gilmour and Tecumseh, located in the crater. Unlike most Algonquin Park lakes, which are usually acidic, the water in these lakes contains bicarbonate; this is thought to be a result of some sedimentary deposits of limestone escaping removal by glaciers in the lower parts of the crater.

The crater lies in the Ottawa-Bonnechere Graben, a 452 million year old rift valley.

The crater was named after the nearby village of Brent.

<text>Campo del Cielo refers to a group of iron meteorites and the area in Argentina where they were found. The site straddles the provinces of Chaco and Santiago del Estero, located north-northwest of Buenos Aires, Argentina and approximately southwest of Asunción, Paraguay. The crater field covers and contains at least 26 craters, the largest being .

The craters are estimated to be four to five thousand years old. They were reported to the general public in 1576, but were already well-known by aboriginal peoples. The craters and surrounding areas contain many fragments of an iron meteorite. In total, approximately 100 tonnes of fragments have been recovered, the most of any meteorite finding.

The two largest fragments, the 30.8-tonne &quot;Gancedo&quot; and 28.8-tonne &quot;El Chaco&quot;, are among the heaviest single-piece meteorite masses recovered on Earth, following the 60-tonne Hoba meteorite and a 31-tonne fragment of the Cape York meteorite.

== History ==
In 1576, the governor of a province in northern Argentina commissioned the military to search for a huge mass of iron, which he had heard that natives used for their weapons. The natives claimed that the mass had fallen from the sky in a place they called &quot;Piguem Nonralta,&quot; which the Spanish translated as &quot;Campo del Cielo&quot; (&quot;Field of heaven (or the sky)&quot;). The expedition found a large mass of metal protruding out of the soil and collected a few samples, which were described as being of unusual purity. The governor documented the expedition and submitted the report to the General Archive of the Indies in Seville, Spain, but it was quickly forgotten and later reports merely repeated the native legends.

Following the legends, in 1774 Don Bartolomé Francisco de Maguna rediscovered the iron mass which he called &quot;el Mesón de Fierro&quot; (&quot;the Table of Iron&quot;). Maguna believed that the mass was the tip of an iron vein. The next expedition, led by Rubin de Celis in 1783, used explosives to clear the ground around the mass and found that it was likely a single stone. Celis estimated its mass as 15 tonnes and abandoned it as worthless. He believed that it had formed by a volcanic eruption, rather than being a meteorite. However, he sent samples to the Royal Society in London and published his report in the &quot;Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society&quot;. Those samples were later analyzed and found to contain 90% iron and 10% nickel; they were assigned to a meteoritic origin.

 Since the crater field&#x27;s discovery, hundreds of iron pieces have been recovered, weighing from a few milligrams to 34 tonnes. &quot;Otumpa&quot;, a mass of approximately 1 tonne, was discovered in 1803. A portion of this mass was taken to Buenos Aires in 1813, then donated to the British Museum. Other large fragments are summarized in the table below. The mass called &quot;El Taco&quot; was originally , but the largest remaining fragment weighs .

In 1969 &quot;El Chaco&quot; (the second-largest mass at ) was discovered below the surface using a metal detector. It was extracted in 1980 and, at the time, was estimated to weigh about 37 tonnes. This made it the second heaviest meteorite after the 60-tonne Hoba meteorite, discovered in Namibia. Currently, more than 100 tonnes of Campo del Cielo fragments have been discovered, making it the heaviest set of such finds on Earth.
In 1990 an Argentine highway police officer foiled a plot by Robert Haag to steal &quot;El Chaco.&quot; It was returned to Campo del Cielo and is now protected by provincial law.

In 2015, police arrested four alleged smugglers trying to steal more than of protected meteorites.

In 2016, the largest-known meteorite of the strewn field was unearthed. Named the Gancedo meteorite after the nearby town of Gancedo, which lent equipment to aid in the extraction, this nickel-iron meteorite has a mass of (less than the original estimated mass of &quot;El Chaco&quot;). Due to a suspected lack of precision when &quot;El Chaco&quot; was weighed in 1980, the latter was reweighed with the same instruments and discovered to only have a mass of , making &quot;Gancedo&quot; the largest Campo del Cielo fragment recovered.

At least 26 craters make up the Campo del Cielo crater field, the largest being . The field covered an area of with an associated strewn area of smaller meteorites including an additional . At least two of the craters contained thousands of small iron pieces. Such an unusual distribution suggests that a large body entered the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere and broke into pieces, which fell to the ground. The size of the main body is estimated to have been larger than in diameter. Samples of charred wood were taken from beneath the meteorite fragments and analyzed for carbon-14 composition. The results indicate the date of the fall to be around 4,200–4,700 years ago, or 2,200–2,700 years BC. The age is estimated to be 4.5 billion years old, formed as part of the development of our solar system.

The fragments contain an unusually high density of inclusions for an iron meteorite, which may have contributed to the disintegration of the original meteorite. The average composition of the Campo del Cielo meteorites is 3.6 ppm iridium, 87 ppm gallium, 407 ppm germanium, 0.25% phosphorus, 0.43% cobalt, and 6.67% nickel, with the remaining 92.6% being iron.

<text>Jan Šindel (1370s – between 1455 and 1457), also known as Jan Ondřejův ( or &quot;Joannes de Praga&quot;), was a Czech medieval scientist and Catholic priest. He was a professor at Charles University in Prague and became the rector of the university in 1410. He lectured on mathematics and astronomy and was also a personal astrologer and physician of kings Wenceslaus IV of Bohemia and his brother Holy Roman Emperor Sigismund.

== Life ==
Jan Šindel was born in Hradec Králové probably in the 1370s. As a young man he came to Prague to study at Charles University. In 1395 or 1399, he became the Master of Arts at Prague University. In 1406, he worked at the parish school of the St. Nicolas Church in Malá Strana in Prague. Later he worked as a teacher of mathematics in Vienna, where he also studied medicine. Then he came back to Prague and became the professor of astronomy at Charles University, where he became Doctor of Medicine and rector of the university in 1410.

At the beginning he was a supporter of John Hus but later he stayed Catholic. He avoided religious disputes and preferred science. In 1418 he became a canon of Prague St. Vitus Chapter. Because of the Hussite Wars he had to leave Prague and came to Olomouc. In 1423–1436 he worked in Nuremberg as a physician. In 1432, he became the personal physician of the Emperor Sigismund. In 1441 he became the dean of the Vyšehrad Chapter in Prague. He had a good relationship with Enea Silvio Bartolomeo Piccolomini (later Pope Pius II), their correspondence from the years 1445–1447 has been preserved. He died probably between 1455 and 1457 in Prague.

==Legacy==
Šindel&#x27;s astronomical tables and maps were allegedly still used by Tycho Brahe. He had a special liking for astronomical devices. Based on his suggestion and calculations, Mikuláš of Kadaň constructed the Prague Orloj clock in 1410. The Šindel sequences in mathematics are named from the appearance of one of these sequences in this clock.

In 1982, an asteroid (3847 Šindel) was named after him.

<text>Carswell is an impact structure within the Athabasca Basin of the Canadian Shield in northern Saskatchewan, Canada. It is in diameter and the age is estimated to be 115 ± 10 million years (Lower Cretaceous). The impact structure is exposed at the surface. 
The central peak complex of faulted metamorphic rocks displays shatter cones, planar deformation features, pseudotachylyte veins, and impact melts and breccias. There is also evidence of planar deformation features in quartz grains far to the south of the outer ring of present-day hills, which suggests the ring of hills are not the rim of the original crater but a peak ring within a much larger structure. The Carswell Formation, composed of algal limestone, may have formed on seamounts elevated to near the surface as part of the peak ring.

==Access==
The Carswell impact structure can be reached by Saskatchewan Highway 955. The gravel road begins in the village of La Loche and ends at the old Cluff Lake mine site within the crater. The Cluff Lake uranium mine produced over 62 million pounds of yellowcake during its 22-year operating life. Since the mine is now closed and decommissioned, there are no travel services in the vicinity and no functional airstrip. Motorists driving to the structure need to carry sufficient fuel and supplies for the round trip back to La Loche.

<text>The Charlevoix impact structure is a large eroded meteorite impact structure in the Charlevoix region of Quebec, Canada. Only part of the impact structure is exposed at the surface, the rest lying beneath the Saint Lawrence River.

== Description ==
The original impact structure is estimated to have been in diameter and the age of the impact is estimated to be 450 ± 20 million years (Ordovician to Silurian age). The projectile was probably a stony asteroid, at least in diameter, and weighing an estimated . The Mont des Éboulements, situated in the exact centre of the impact structure, is interpreted as the central uplift, a consequence of elastic rebound. The impact structure is classified as a multi-ringed basin with a central uplift.

The impact origin of Charlevoix impact structure was first realized in 1965 after the discovery of many shatter cones in the area. Other evidence for impact includes planar deformation features (PDFs) in quartz and feldspar grains.

In contrast to the surrounding craggy Laurentian Mountains, the impact structure is relatively smooth and flat, which has facilitated human settlement. Today, 90% of the people of Charlevoix live within this impact structure.

<text>Michael Magner VC (21 June 1840 – 6 February 1897) was born in County Fermanagh, Ireland and was an Irish recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

==Details==
He was 27 years old, and a drummer in the 33rd Regiment of Foot, later the Duke of Wellington&#x27;s Regiment, British Army, during the Abyssinia Expedition when the following deed took place for which he was awarded the VC.

On 13 April 1868 in Abyssinia (now Ethiopia), during the assault on Magdala, when the head of the column of attack was checked by the obstacles at the gate, a small stream of officers and men of the 33rd Regiment and an officer of the Royal Engineers broke away from the main approach to Magdala and, reaching the defences, climbed a cliff, forced their way over a wall and through a strong and thorny fence, thus turning the defenders of the gateway. The first two men to enter Magdala were Drummer Magner and a private (James Bergin).

Magner later achieved the rank of Corporal. He died in Melbourne, Australia on 6 February 1897.

==The medal==
Magner&#x27;s medal is on public display in Museum Victoria, Carlton Gardens, Melbourne, Australia.

<doc id="779968" wikidata="Q6780923" url="?curid=779968" title="Mary Ward Catholic Secondary School">
<text>Mary Ward Catholic Secondary School (abbreviated Mary Ward C.S.S., MWCSS, MW, Mary Ward, or simply Ward) is a Catholic secondary school in Toronto Ontario, Canada. It is administered by the Toronto Catholic District School Board, formerly the Metropolitan Separate School Board. Mary Ward is a centre of self-directed learning and a member of the Canadian Coalition of Self-Directed Learning. It is one of only two self-directed learning schools currently in Ontario and seven in Canada.

The school was founded in 1985 as a conventional high school between two campuses in northeast Toronto until it moved into a new building at Kennedy Rd. and McNicoll Ave., designed specifically for its self-directed learning program (formerly called Direction 2000) in January 1992. The school is named after Mary Ward, a seventeenth-century English Catholic nun who founded the Sisters of Loreto.

==History==
Mary Ward Catholic Secondary School started out as two campuses known as the &quot;Tin Can&quot;, one which later became Cardinal Carter Academy for the Arts and a demolished relocatable. It was founded on January 23, 1985, during the 400th anniversary of Mary Ward&#x27;s birth, as a conventional high school in northeast Toronto under the leadership of the first principal, Mary Anne O&#x27;Leary with 200 students. The school came to existence due to overcrowding population secondary schools at Francis Libermann and Senator O&#x27;Connor. The North Campus of Mary Ward was situated on 25 Canongate Trail at Birchmount and Steeles with 102 students in relocatables; the South Campus is located at 36 Greenfield Avenue with 47 students until they were consolidated in the Canongate campus in 1986 with 400 students.

By 1987, another &quot;South Campus&quot; was built with 600 students and 70 portables on the present site at 3200 Kennedy Road. The modern building for 861 students was built and completed by September 1991 as the school was opened and blessed in January 1992, designed specifically for its self-directed learning program (formerly called Direction 2000 established in the late 1980s). By the 1992–93 school year, the school had grown to over 1,000 students.

In 1995, MWCSS became a founding member of the Canadian Coalition of Self-Directed Learning Schools (CCSDL). By 1996, the school had an independent learning system. Sandra Gionas of the &quot;Toronto Star&quot; in 1996 explained, &quot;There are no classes or classrooms at Mary Ward. It&#x27;s sometimes said the teachers don&#x27;t teach. There&#x27;s no first period or second period, no semester system or terms. And students decide when to write exams.&quot;

==Campus==
The current Mary Ward campus shares 26 acres of land with the L&#x27;Amoreaux Community Centre that is also attached to the school.

With Mary Ward built for the self-directed learning program, the existing configuration shares several classrooms with the community centre, plus a gymnasium, a cafetorium, an atrium, a student services area, several technological labs, a chapel, and a day care room.

A large parking lot is on the eastern side of the property where the portables previously stood. The school has a 400m running track and soccer/football field with a baseball diamond on the northern side of the school.

==Operations==
The school does not use a set schedule, and students do self-paced learning. There are no specific designated areas set as classrooms. In 2024, the school has a higher number of students leaving prior to graduation than other area high schools because of students being unable to adjust to self-paced learning.

==Culture==
In 2015, Karen K. Ho stated in &quot;Toronto Life&quot; that the school &quot;was something of an anomaly&quot; since it had &quot;a decidedly bohemian vibe&quot; despite having a &quot;strict dress code&quot; and &quot;the usual high academic standards&quot;.

==Notable alumni==

* Craig Kielburger — co-founder of Free The Children
* Pat Mastroianni — actor
* Jennifer Pan — convicted murderer (did not graduate)
* Cassie Steele — actor
* Phylicia George — Canadian Olympian

<doc id="779970" wikidata="Q207474" url="?curid=779970" title="List of cities in the United Kingdom">
<text>This is a list of cities in the United Kingdom that are officially designated as such . It lists those places that have been granted city status by letters patent or royal charter. 

There are currently 76 such cities in the United Kingdom: 55 in England, eight in Scotland, seven in Wales, and six in Northern Ireland. Of these, 24 in England, two in Wales, and two in Northern Ireland have Lord Mayors; four in Scotland have Lord Provosts. In some cases, the area holding city status does not coincide with the built up area or conurbation of which it forms part. In Greater London, for example, the Cities of London and Westminster hold city status separately, but no other local authority in the London Region has been granted city status, nor has the Greater London Authority. 

In other cases, such as the cities of Canterbury and Lancaster, the status applies to a local government district which extends over a number of towns and rural areas outside the main settlement proper. In England, city status sometimes applies to civil parishes, such as with Ripon; though the status may not apply to the local government district which share their name. For example, the civil parishes of Lichfield and Chichester each hold city status, but Lichfield District and Chichester District in which they are situated do not.

As of 2022, there are currently five ceremonial counties which contain three cities – Cambridgeshire (Ely, Cambridge and Peterborough), Essex, Hampshire, West Midlands and West Yorkshire. Outside the UK within British overseas cities of the British Overseas Territories and Crown Dependencies, there are currently five. The number increased as part of the Platinum Jubilee celebrations by the addition of Stanley in the Falkland Islands and Douglas in the Isle of Man.

== History ==
The earliest cities () in Britain were the fortified settlements organised by the Romans as capitals of the Celtic tribes under Roman rule. The British clerics of the early Middle Ages later preserved a traditional list of the &quot;28 Cities&quot; () which was mentioned in &quot;De Excidio Britanniae&quot; and &quot;Historia Brittonum&quot;.

The title of city was initially informal and, into the 20th century, royal charters were considered to &quot;recognise&quot; city status rather than grant it. The usual criterion in early modern Britain was the presence of a cathedral, particularly after King Henry VIII granted letters patent establishing six new cities when he established a series of new dioceses of the Church of England in the 1540s as part of the English Reformation. No new cities were created between the 16th and 19th centuries, but following the Industrial Revolution and the accompanying population boom and growth in urbanisation, new sees were established at Ripon (1836) and Manchester (1847); their councils began to style them cities immediately. Inverness in Scotland was refused a charter at the time of the Diamond Jubilee of Queen Victoria honours of 1897, in part because it would have drawn more attention to the other traditional &quot;cities&quot; still not formally chartered as such.

Beginning in the mid-19th century, however, the process became more formal. After a visit by Queen Victoria in 1851, Manchester petitioned Parliament for recognition of its status. Ripon followed in the 1860s, and a series of hitherto informal &quot;cities&quot; were formally recognised in the 1880s and 1890s. On the basis of its size, importance, and regular government, Belfast was elevated in spite of its lack of a cathedral in 1888; other large municipalities followed, while smaller applicants began to be rejected. King Edward VII and the Home Office established three criteria for future applicants in 1907: a minimum population of 300,000, a good record of local government, and a &quot;local metropolitan character&quot;. These criteria were not made public, however, and following Leicester&#x27;s successful elevation in 1919, a series of exceptions were made. The Local Government Act 1972 effectively eliminated all authorities holding city status outside Greater London on 1 April 1974; most of their replacements were confirmed in their predecessor&#x27;s status—even in cases such as the 1974–2023 City of Carlisle district, where much of the local authority area was undeveloped countryside—but the Borough of Medway was not permitted to continue Rochester&#x27;s title. In recent times there have been competitions for new grants of city status. Towns or councils that claim city status or add &quot;city&quot; to their name have been rebuked by the Advertising Standards Authority.

The cities of the Kingdom of Scotland and Kingdom of Ireland were treated separately. Scottish towns irregularly applied the description to themselves, but were formally organised as royal burghs; the special rights of these were preserved by Article XXI of the Treaty of Union which established the single state of the Kingdom of Great Britain in 1707. Edinburgh and Glasgow were confirmed as cities &quot;by ancient usage&quot; in the 18th century, as was Aberdeen, and this was later reconfirmed in the Act enlarging the burgh in 1891. Dundee was granted letters patent in 1889 and Elgin and Perth were recognised as cities by the Home Office in 1972, before the privilege was removed by the Scottish Local Government Act of 1973. In Northern Ireland, only the seat of the Primate of All Ireland at Armagh was accorded city status by ancient usage, and this status was abolished by the Municipal Corporations (Ireland) Act 1840. All other cities have been those explicitly recognised as such.

Thirty-two cities have a Lord Provost (in Scotland) or a Lord Mayor (in England, Wales, and Northern Ireland), see List of lord mayoralties and lord provostships in the United Kingdom. The six cities where the Lord Mayor or Lord Provost has the right to the style &quot;The Right Honourable&quot; are York, the City of London, Edinburgh, Glasgow (since 1912), Belfast (since 1923), and Cardiff (since 1956).

== Statistical role ==

City status has little statistical significance in UK because it is not a measure of a city&#x27;s size and only holds a ceremonial status. Historic cities, such as St Davids (a cathedral city in Wales) can be quite small, however newer cities, such as those conferred in 2022, can range in size from anywhere between 50,000 to over 200,000. Populous towns, such as Luton, Northampton and Reading, do not have city status.

=== Conurbations ===
The term &quot;city&quot; is sometimes loosely applied to conurbations in the UK. The government tends to recognise these as primary urban areas for statistical and economic purposes, though greater urban areas are what most people determine to be a city region. Large cities other than London, such as Manchester or Birmingham, are often confused with these conurbations. Manchester has a significantly lower population than Birmingham, though the Greater Manchester Built-up Area is more populous than the West Midlands conurbation. This question of definition has provoked a second city debate in the United Kingdom.

Conversely, many official cities in the UK contain a substantial rural area encompassing settlements which are physically separated from the core urban area. The City of Milton Keynes (a unitary authority) and City of Colchester (non-metropolitan district) received letters patent which covered an area substantially larger than that of their respective core urban areas; this meant that extra-urban settlements such as the towns of Olney and West Mersea fall within &quot;de jure&quot; cities.

<doc id="779975" wikidata="Q5547323" url="?curid=779975" title="Georgia (coffee)">
<text>is a brand of coffee drinks sold by The Coca-Cola Company. The brand is named after Coca-Cola&#x27;s home state of Georgia. Launched in 1975, it has since expanded to markets in Singapore, South Korea, India, Bahrain, and the United States.

== History ==
Georgia was first launched in 1975 by Coca-Cola (Japan) Company, a Japanese subsidiary of the company. Georgia enjoys the most success in Japan, where it is the highest-grossing coffee beverage—one of many brands of Japanese canned coffee. It is also the highest-grossing beverage by Coca-Cola (Japan) Company. As of 2007, in Japan, Georgia&#x27;s sales are double the sales of Coca-Cola.

=== International expansion ===
Georgia coffee was introduced in the United States in 2009, where it is almost exclusively sold in Asian grocery stores. In India, Georgia Gold is part of the non-carbonated beverage portfolio of Coca-Cola India. Under this brand, beverages are dispensed from machines, but not in the canned format.
The coffee is freshly brewed from roast beans with variants like cappuccino, caffe latte, mochaccino, espresso etc. Other beverages, such as tea or hot chocolate, may also be offered from the same machine. The brand in India also features machines that dispense Iced Tea (Lemon &amp; Peach) and Cold Coffee.

==Advertising==
Characters from David Lynch&#x27;s &quot;Twin Peaks&quot; advertised Georgia coffee in a four-part commercial series in 1991. In PlayStation Home, the PlayStation 3&#x27;s online community-based service, Coca-Cola has placed a vending machine in Home that takes users to a space called the &quot;Georgia Break Station&quot;. The vending machine also distributes original avatar items and presents, along with &quot;C-pons&quot;, digital coupons that can be used to get real drinks from real vending machines. This is to promote Georgia series of canned coffee. The space is a lounge for users to sit and chat with two in-lounge avatars that talk about the Georgia coffee. It was available from September 7, 2009, to December 15, 2009. In 2012, the &quot;Digital × Real Campaign&quot; was a collaboration with Crypton Future Media featuring the fictional character Hatsune Miku.

<doc id="779978" wikidata="Q1231561" url="?curid=779978" title="Matt Stajan">
<text>Matthew Stajan ( ; born December 19, 1983) is a Canadian former professional ice hockey centre. He was a second round selection, 57th overall, of the Toronto Maple Leafs at the 2002 NHL Entry Draft. Stajan made his NHL debut in 2004 and was a member of the Maple Leafs until he was traded to the Calgary Flames in 2010. Stajan played his final professional season with EHC Red Bull München of the Deutsche Eishockey Liga (DEL)

Internationally, Stajan was a member of the Canadian national junior team that won a silver medal at the 2003 World Junior Hockey Championships.

==Playing career==

===Junior===
A native of Mississauga, Ontario, Stajan played his minor hockey in the Greater Toronto Hockey League with the Toronto Red Wings and Mississauga Senators associations before being drafted by the Belleville Bulls in the Ontario Hockey League (OHL) Priority Selection draft in 2000. He played three seasons in the OHL between 2000 and 2003 in which he scored 206 points in 182 games. Stajan made his debut in 2000–01 season with a 27-point season in 57 games, then improved to 33 goals and 85 points the following season. He also finished with a plus-minus rating of +36 and was a finalist in an OHL coaches poll naming the best defensive forward. Stajan was also a member of the OHL&#x27;s Eastern Conference All-Star Team in the Canadian Hockey League&#x27;s All-Star series.

The Toronto Maple Leafs selected Stajan with their second-round pick, 57th overall, at the 2002 NHL Entry Draft. He described being chosen by his hometown team as a &quot;dream come true&quot;. He returned to Belleville for his final OHL season in 2002–03 where he finished 8th in league scoring with 94 points. He played his second all-star game for the Eastern Conference, and was named to the OHL&#x27;s third All-Star Team following the season. Stajan was also a member of the Canadian national junior team at the 2003 World Junior Hockey Championships. He scored a goal and an assist in six games to help Canada win the silver medal.

===Toronto Maple Leafs===
Stajan was assigned to the American Hockey League (AHL)&#x27;s St. John&#x27;s Maple Leafs at the conclusion of Belleville&#x27;s season. He made his professional debut on April 4, 2003, and registered an assist against the Manitoba Moose. He was recalled to Toronto and made his NHL debut the following night against the Ottawa Senators. He scored his first goal that night on goaltender Martin Prusek in a 3–1 loss. Stajan earned a spot on the Toronto roster in 2003–04; he appeared in 69 games in his rookie season, scored 14 goals and recorded 27 points. He appeared in three playoff games. Stajan also participated in the YoungStars Game at the 2004 All-Star Game, where he scored a goal and an assist for the Eastern Conference in a 7–3 loss to the West.

While the 2004-05 season was delayed, and ultimately cancelled, due to a labour dispute, Stajan was assigned to St. John&#x27;s. He recorded 66 points in 80 games and scored 23 goals. Stajan returned to Toronto when NHL play resumed in 2005–06 where he focused on developing his two-way play, trying to become both an offensive presence while remaining defensively responsible. He finished with 27 points, and led the league with eight short-handed points (tied with Marián Hossa).

The Maple Leafs and Stajan agreed to a new two-year, $1.75 million contract prior to the 2006–07 season. His offensive production improved modestly; he scored 39 points that season and followed it with 33 in 2007–08. His performances earned him another two-year contract, worth $3.5 million.

With 55 points in 76 games, Stajan finished third in Maple Leafs&#x27; scoring in 2008–09; his 40 assists led the team. He was again among Toronto&#x27;s leading scorers, with 41 points in 55 games, when he was included in a blockbuster trade: On January 31, 2010, Stajan was sent to the Calgary Flames, along with Niklas Hagman, Ian White and Jamal Mayers in exchange for Dion Phaneuf, Fredrik Sjöström and Keith Aulie. He finished the year with 16 points in 27 games with Calgary, resulting in a combined total and career high of 57 points.

===Calgary Flames===
Though he was set to become an unrestricted free agent following the season, Stajan opted to remain in Calgary and signed a four-year, $14 million contract with the Flames. Stajan&#x27;s offensive production rapidly declined over the following two seasons – he scored 31 points in 2010–11 and only 18 in 2011–12 – which resulted increasing condemnation of his play and arguments that his contract had become one of the &quot;worst in franchise history&quot; while head coach Brent Sutter dropped him from the top scoring lines to the fourth line in a checking role. His troubled 2011–12 season was exacerbated by a sprained ankle, an injury that caused him to miss 14 games. However, he finished the season on an offensive high that included scoring his 100th career goal late in the year.

When the Flames replaced Sutter with Bob Hartley in the 2012–13, the new head coach expanded Stajan&#x27;s role. He responded with what he called his best season, scoring 23 points in 43 games in the lockout-shortened season while earning praise for his defensive responsibility; Stajan&#x27;s plus-minus rating of +7 led the team and he was one of only two players with a positive total. Following the departure of several of Calgary&#x27;s top players and with the team entering a rebuilding period, Stajan was expected to centre Calgary&#x27;s top line in 2013–14. However, he suffered a leg contusion in the team&#x27;s season opening game that caused him to miss several weeks of play. Stajan appeared in only 63 games for the Flames, but recorded 33 points, his highest total in four years. Injury again sidelined Stajan early in the 2014–15 season. He suffered a knee injury as a result of a knee-on-knee collision with Montreal&#x27;s Jarred Tinordi that was expected to keep him out of the Flames&#x27; lineup for six weeks.

The Flames made the playoffs for the first time since 2008–09 in 2014–15, and Stajan played every game of the postseason, forming one of the Flames&#x27; most dangerous forward lines with wingers David Jones and Micheal Ferland. Jones and Ferland were the offensive and physical leaders on the line during the Flames&#x27; run to the second round of the playoffs, but it was Stajan who scored the series-clinching goal in Game 6 of the Flames&#x27; first-round playoff series against the Vancouver Canucks. The Anaheim Ducks would defeat Calgary in five games in the semifinals, ending the Flames&#x27; season. Stajan finished the playoffs with 1 goal and 4 points in 11 games.

With the emergence of rookie Sam Bennett, Stajan centred the Flames&#x27; fourth line throughout the following season, 2015–16, and saw his offensive production decrease accordingly. Stajan went from 17 points in 59 games in 2014–15 to 17 points in 80 games in 2015–16. Coach Bob Hartley was fired in the offseason following a disastrous 2015-16 campaign, and was replaced with former Canucks assistant Glen Gulutzan, who quickly re-established Stajan&#x27;s third-line position, this time with Kris Versteeg and Troy Brouwer.

During the 2017–18 season Stajan played in his 1,000th NHL game in a 4–0 loss to the Anaheim Ducks.

===EHC Munchen===
On August 29, 2018, after fifteen seasons in the NHL, Stajan signed with EHC Red Bull München of the Deutsche Eishockey Liga (DEL).

Stajan announced his retirement from hockey on May 2, 2019. On December 3, 2019, he announced his retirement again, this time through the NHLPA.

==Personal life==
Matt is the son of Mike and Nada Stajan, and he has an elder sister, Michelle. He and his wife Katie have lived in Calgary since his trade from Toronto. Their first child died shortly after birth in March 2014. The couple had their second son, one year later and a third son born in August 2018. Stajan is of Slovenian descent; both of his sets of grandparents immigrated to Canada in the 1950s. His paternal grandfather, Ludvic, started a company that manufactures fire doors that Mike and an uncle took over. Stajan wore uniform number 14 throughout his youth career and with the Maple Leafs in honour of his uncle Robert, who wore the number in his own hockey career and died of cancer when Stajan was a young boy. Stajan changed his number to 18 upon joining the Flames, as 14 was taken out of circulation following Theoren Fleury&#x27;s departure from the team.

Stajan has been recognized several times for his charitable contributions. He was the Toronto Maple Leafs&#x27; nominee for the King Clancy Memorial Trophy in 2007, which recognizes players who exhibit leadership qualities while making a significant contribution to their community. In Calgary, Stajan has been a spokesman for the Alberta Children&#x27;s Hospital and supports the Ronald McDonald House. In 2013, the Flames named him the winner of the Ralph T. Scurfield Humanitarian Award for perseverance, dedication and leadership, and nominated him for the NHL Foundation Player Award. Following the death of his first child, Stajan and his wife Katie hosted an event called &quot;A Night Under the Stars&quot;, which raised over $100,000 for the neonatal intensive care unit at Calgary&#x27;s Foothills Medical Centre. Additionally, Stajan is active within the National Hockey League Players&#x27; Association; he has served as his team&#x27;s player representative in both Toronto and Calgary.

<doc id="779983" wikidata="Q752511" url="?curid=779983" title="Sanda (sport)">
<text>Sanda (), formerly Sanshou (), is the official Chinese kickboxing full-contact combat sport. In Chinese Language, &quot;Sanda&quot; originally referred to independent and separate training and combat techniques in contrast to &quot;Taolu&quot; (pre-arranged forms or routines). 

Sanda is a fighting system which was originally developed by the Chinese military based upon the study and practices of traditional Chinese martial arts and modern combat fighting techniques; it combines boxing and full-contact kickboxing, which includes close range and rapid successive punches and kicks, with wrestling, takedowns, throws, sweeps, kick catches, and in some competitions, even elbow and knee strikes.

As part of the development of sport wushu by the Chinese government, a standard curriculum for Sanda was developed. It is to this standard curriculum that the term &quot;Wushu Sanda&quot; is usually applied. Sanda may also involve techniques from any other fighting style depending on the teacher&#x27;s mode of instruction.

==History==
Sanda&#x27;s competitive history is rooted in barehanded &quot;elevated arena&quot; or Lei Tai fights in which no rules were observed. However, Sanda as a competitive event developed in the military as these bouts were commonly held between the soldiers to test and practice barehanded martial skills, ability and techniques. Rules were developed and the use of protective gloves etc. was adopted. It was originally used by the Kuomintang at the first modern military academy in Whampoa in the 1920s. In 1928, the Central Kuoshu Academy was formed, and they sponsored a full-contact tournament. When the Kuomintang government moved to Taiwan, they began holding a full-contact tournament in the 1950s, calling it lei tai. The sport was also adopted as a method by the People&#x27;s Liberation Army of China, and subseqently civilian competitions developed. Sanda&#x27;s curriculum as a competitive sport was developed with reference to traditional Chinese martial arts, but since the goal in sports is &quot;winning the match&quot;, techniques were adapted to make the activity scoring-oriented. This general Wushu Sanda curriculum varies in its different forms, as the Chinese government developed a version for civilians for self-defense and as a sport.

==Curriculum==
The generalized modern curriculum practiced in modern wushu schools is composed of different traditional martial arts fighting styles from China and Western Boxing, but mainly based on scientific efficiency. Wushu Sanda is composed of Chinese martial arts applications including most aspects of combat including striking and grappling, however when Wushu Sanda was developed as a sport, restrictions were made for safety reasons as well as to promote it as a non-violent sport. Examples of such restrictions included no blows delivered to the back of the head, throat, spine or groin and the discontinuation of the combat when any of the fighters fall to the ground. However many schools, whether traditional or modern, practice it as an all-round martial arts system with no restrictions, only adapting their training in relation to competition rules prior to the event. Sanda tournaments are one of the two disciplines recognized by the International Wushu Federation.

Hand Strikes
* Jab
* Cross
* Hook
* Overhand
* Uppercut
* Back-fist

Elbows and Knees
* Horizontal
* Vertical
* Diagonal

Kicks
* Front Kick
* Side Kick
* Sweep Kicks
* Spinning Back Kick
* Roundhouse Kick
* Axe kick

Throws
* Hip Throw
* Shoulder Throw
* Sweep
* Double leg takedowns
* Single leg takedowns
* Body lock takedowns
* Kick catch throws
* Trips
*Scissor takedown

One can see Sanda as a synthesis of traditional Chinese fighting techniques into a more amorphous system and is commonly taught alongside traditional Chinese styles, from which Wushu Sanda techniques, theory and training methods are derived. The emphasis of Sanda is on a more amorphous fighting ability.
==Sport variation==
Yundong Sanda () or Jinzheng Sanda (): A modern fighting method, sport, and applicable component of Wushu / Kung Fu influenced by traditional Chinese Boxing, in which takedowns &amp; throws are legal in competition.

Sanda appears much like kickboxing but includes many more grappling techniques. Sanda fighting competitions are often held alongside taolu or form competitions. Sanda represents the modern development of Lei Tai contests, but with rules in place to reduce the chance of serious injury. 
Many Chinese martial art schools teach or work within the rule sets of Sanda, working to incorporate the movements, characteristics, and theory of their style.

Chinese martial artists also compete in non-Chinese or mixed combat sports, including boxing, kickboxing and mixed martial arts. Sanda is practiced in tournaments and is normally held alongside taolu events in wushu competition. For safety reasons, some techniques from the self-defense form such as elbow strikes, chokes, and joint locks, are not allowed during tournaments. Competitors can win by knockout or points which are earned by landing strikes to the body or head, throwing an opponent, or when competition is held on a raised lei tai platform, pushing them off the platform. Fighters are only allowed to clinch for a few seconds. If the clinch is not broken by the fighters, and if neither succeeds in throwing his opponent within the time limit, the referee will break the clinch. In the U.S., competitions are held either in boxing rings or on the raised lei tai platform. Amateur fighters wear protective gear.

&quot;Amateur Sanda&quot; allows kicks, punches, knees (not to the head), and throws. A competition held in China, called the &quot;King of Sanda&quot;, is held in a ring similar to a boxing ring in design but larger in dimension. As professionals, they wear no protective gear except for gloves, cup, and mouthpiece, and 
&quot;Professional Sanda&quot; allows knee strikes (including to the head) as well as kicking, punching and throwing.

Some Sanda fighters have participated in fighting tournaments such as K-1 and Shoot boxing. They have had some degree of success, especially in Shoot boxing competitions, which is more similar to Sanda. Due to the rules of Kickboxing competition, Sanda fighters are subjected to more limitations than usual. Also notable competitors in China&#x27;s mainstream Mixed Martial Arts competitions, Art of War Fighting Championship and Ranik Ultimate Fighting Federation are dominantly of wushu Sanda background. Sanda coach, Zhao Xuejun played a significant role in helping transition Sanda fighters to MMA. Although it is less common, some Sanda practitioners have also fought in American Mixed Martial Arts competitions such as the UFC and Strikeforce. Sanda has been featured in many style-versus-style competitions. Muay Thai is frequently pitted against Sanda as is Karate, Kickboxing, &amp; Tae Kwon Do.

==Military variation==
Junshi Sanda (): A system of unarmed combat that was designed by Chinese Elite Forces based upon their intense study of traditional martial arts such as traditional Kung Fu, Shuai Jiao, Chin Na and modern hand-to-hand fighting and combat philosophy to develop a realistic system of unarmed fighting for the Chinese military. Junshi Sanda employs all parts of the body as anatomical weapons to attack and counter with, by using what the Chinese consider to be the four basic martial arts techniques:
* Da – Upper-Body Striking – using fists, open hands, fingers, elbows, shoulders, forearms and the head
* Ti – Lower-Body Striking – including kicks, knees and stomping
* Shuai – Throws – using wrestling and Judo-like takedowns and sweeps, and
* Chin-Na – Seizing – which includes jointlocks, strangulation and other submissions

==Competitions==
The International Wushu Federation (IWUF) promotes wushu and is the governing body for wushu in all its forms worldwide. Sanda and taolu (forms) are the two categories of competitive sport wushu . The IWUF is recognized by the International Olympic Committee (IOC).

<text>Cloud Creek crater is an impact crater in Wyoming, United States. The crater is located in Natrona County, about northwest of Casper, near the center of a geological feature known as the Casper Arch.

The Cloud Creek structure is circular with a current diameter of about , and it is buried beneath about of Mesozoic rocks. The age of the structure is estimated to be 190 ± 20 million years, which means that it formed as the result of an impact during the early part of the Jurassic Period. This impact feature is not exposed at the surface, but it is known only through wells drilled for oil and gas. First reported by Donald Stone, Cloud Creek is a circular structure documented using several 2D reflection seismic lines of fair to good quality, gravity, magnetic and borehole data. The structure has a central core of brecciated, fractured and faulted rocks uplifted up to 520 m relative to the normal stratigraphy outside the structure. The core is surrounded by an annular trough and a detached fault-bounded rim anticline. The rim anticline defines the 7 km diameter of the structure. The structure was compressed and upthrown during the Laramide compression. Morphometric parameters of the structure are consistent with known impact structures. The core is associated with a positive gravity anomaly. Magnetic data could not be interpreted.

== History ==
The first published report of the Cloud Creek Structure was in 1985. However, an impact origin was probably first proposed sometime after 1973 by a Casper geologist named Jack Wroble A total of ten wells have been drilled for oil and gas within the boundaries of the Cloud Creek structure between 1955 and 1999. Two wells have been drilled with the central peak, four wells within the encircling skirt, and four through the outer rim structure.

<doc id="779987" wikidata="Q5161988" url="?curid=779987" title="Connolly Basin crater">
<text>Connolly Basin is a 9 km-diameter impact crater located in the Gibson Desert of central Western Australia. It lies adjacent to the Talawana Track 45 km west of the junction (Windy Corner) with the Gary Highway, but is difficult to access due to the remoteness of the area. It was originally thought to be a diapir (salt dome); an impact origin was first proposed in 1985.,

== Description ==

The depression has a topographic rim 25–30 m high, while the centre displays a slight circular rise about 1 km in diameter and 5 m high exposing strongly deformed and steeply dipping bedrock interpreted as a central uplift., Sedimentary rocks comprising the rim are of Early Cretaceous to Palaeogene age, while uplifted rocks in the centre are likely of Early Permian age, all part of the Canning Basin; the impact event itself is inferred to be of Paleocene (early Paleogene) age or later.,

<doc id="779988" wikidata="Q941085" url="?curid=779988" title="Olinto De Pretto">
<text>Olinto De Pretto (26 April 1857 – 16 March 1921) was an Italian industrialist and geologist from Schio, Vicenza. It is claimed by an Italian mathematician, Umberto Bartocci, that De Pretto may have been the first person to derive the energy–mass-equivalence formula_1, generally attributed to Albert Einstein. But this is refuted by Ignazio Marchioro in &quot;Quaderni di Schio&quot;, where it shows that the similarity was a coincidence, and that the energy proposed by De Pretto doubles the one of Einstein&#x27;s formula.
Also, De Pretto suggested that radioactive decay of uranium and thorium was an example of mass transforming into energy.

==Early life==
Olinto De Pretto was born on April 26, 1857, in Schio in what is now the province of Vicenza in northern Italy. Olinto was the sixth of seven children (three boys, and four girls). His mother was Angelica Boschetti (1822–1905). His father, Pietro De Pretto (1810–1891), was an architect whose hobbies included astronomy and geology, two studies Olinto would later take up.

He attended the Superior School of Agriculture in Milan where he studied agriculture and geology with a major in agronomics. He graduated in 1879 with a degree in agronomics. Immediately upon graduation, he became a university assistant to professor Gaetano Cantoni, a Dean of the agricultural school. Together they developed methods that helped modernize Italian agriculture by improving methods of crop rotation and analyzing soil chemistry.

When Cantoni died in 1887, Olinto left the university and became a director at a mechanical foundry mill owned by his older brother Silvio, where he worked for the rest of his life.

==Early scientific research and papers==
In 1888, as a result of his research with his brother Augusto, he published his first paper, &quot;The Influence of the Raising and the Degradation of Mountains on the Development of Glaciers&quot;. In 1892, along with his brothers Augusto and Silvio, they founded the Alpinistic Circle with Silvio as the first president. In 1896 the Bulletin of the Italian Society of Geology republished his article as &quot;The Degradation of Mountains and Its Influence on Glaciers&quot;. In 1898, his paper titled &quot;Glacial Epoch and Orografical Theory&quot; was published in the Bulletin of the Italian Alpine Club.

In 1899, he published &quot;Geological Signs in the Surroundings of Schio&quot;.

==Contributions to physics and energy–mass-equivalence==
From 1899 to 1903 De Pretto began to study the emerging field of nuclear physics and its relationship to astronomy. He focused on the theory of aether, a hypothetical substance that at that time was believed to fill all space.

As a result of his research on November 29, 1903, De Pretto published a 62-page paper in the &quot;Atti del Reale Istituto Veneto di Scienze, Lettere ed Arti&quot;, vol LXIII (&quot;Proceedings of the Royal Veneto Institute of Science, Letters and Arts&quot;) entitled &quot;&quot;Ipotesi dell&#x27;Etere nella Vita dell&#x27;Universo&quot; (&quot;Hypothesis of Aether in the Life of the Universe&quot;&quot;). The paper was endorsed by the famous astronomer Giovanni Schiaparelli. De Pretto&#x27;s paper was later included in the proceedings of an Italian scientific institute The Royal Veneto Institute of Science.

This theory was similar to Samuel Tolver Preston&#x27;s 1875 hypothesis that matter and energy might be interchangeable. De Pretto&#x27;s theory was based on his hypothesis that a mass traveling at velocity &quot;v&quot; has the potential energy (&quot;forza viva&quot;) proportional to mv2 (the exact formula is mv2). In the section of his paper headed &quot;Energy of the Ether and Potential Energy in Matter&quot;, De Pretto wrote:

:&quot;Matter uses and stores energy as inertia, just like a steam engine that uses the energy in steam and stores energy in inertia as potential energy[... ] All components of a body are animated by infinitesimal but rapid movements equal to perhaps the &quot;vibration of the ether&quot;. It must be concluded that the matter in any body contains the sum of the energy represented by the entire mass of that body if it could move through space with the speed of a single particle.&quot;

By theorizing the &quot;vibration of the ether&quot;, De Pretto asserted that mass is vibrating energy and that mass and energy are therefore interchangeable. He then speculated that ordinary matter may be considered to be vibrating at the speed of light &quot;c&quot;.

According to De Pretto,

:&quot;The matter of any body contains within it a sum of energy represented by the entire mass of the body[... ] Nobody will easily admit that, stored in a latent state, in any kilogram of matter, completely hidden to all our investigations, hides such a sum of energy, equivalent to the amount that can be extracted from [burning] millions and millions of kilograms of coal.&quot;&quot;

===½mv² versus mc²===

De Pretto used the expression formula_2 for the &quot;vis viva&quot; and the energy stored within matter, where he identified &quot;v&quot; with the speed of light. According to Italian mathematician Umberto Bartocci, his formula precedes by two years, and is in agreement with Albert Einstein&#x27;s later formula formula_1 for mass–energy equivalence, which was derived by Einstein as a consequence of special relativity. According to Bartocci, Einstein may have learned of de Pretto&#x27;s work through his Swiss-Italian friend Michele Besso.

===Radioactive decay===
De Pretto&#x27;s paper discussed the radioactive decay of uranium and thorium and was the first to conclude that this decay was energy transformation from mass into energy. He also presented a hypothesis that the intense heat assumed to be in the centre of the Earth (theory of central fire) was caused by the tremendous mass of the earth creating a massive radioactive core giving off heat and energy.

==Honours==
In 1906 De Pretto was accepted as a member of Accademia dei Lincei, a scientific organization whose members included Galileo Galilei. The director of the organization, Ernesto Mancini, was also a member of The Royal Society of London, an international scientific society. Mancini submitted De Pretto&#x27;s paper to the Royal Society for international recognition. It was received favourably and was listed in the Society&#x27;s &quot;International Catalogue of Scientific Literature&quot;.

<text>Lac Couture is a lake in Northern Quebec, Canada. It is located near Hudson Bay in the Kativik territory. The lake is approximately 150 meters deep.

Most of the lake covers an 8 km in diameter impact crater. The crater is estimated to be 430 ± 25 million years old (Silurian). Breccia, suggesting impact origin, is present in boulders at the surface on islands around the perimeter of the lake. There is also a 25-meter central uplift in the lake floor, suggesting complex crater morphology.

<doc id="779990" wikidata="Q1049697" url="?curid=779990" title="Battle of Płowce">
<text>The Battle of Płowce took place on 27 September 1331 between the Kingdom of Poland and the Teutonic Order.

==Background==
The Teutonic plan was to support John of Bohemia in an invasion of Silesia. Władysław I the Elbow-high had claimed lordship over Silesia, but John believed that he had an equally valid claim to it. The Bohemian king marched in with an army and occupied Silesia. Luther von Braunschweig believed that Władysław would be so outraged by this move that he would muster all of the Polish forces to drive John out of Silesia, leaving the Germans free to invade Samogitia without Polish interference. 

In order to increase the chances of John securing Silesia, Braunschweig aided the Bohemian army with his own forces and any other force that he could muster. A rather large army consisting of Bohemians (Czechs), knights from the Teutonic order, rebel Polish noblemen who wished to make a stand against Władysław, mercenaries from the Holy Roman Empire and some English crusaders all set off for Poland. Władysław scrambled to assemble the Polish forces, along with soldiers from Lithuania and Hungary, into position. The elderly Władysław delegated a significant portion of the command to his son, Casimir III of Poland. Many of the Polish soldiers were not confident of Casimir&#x27;s military capabilities, and large-scale desertions occurred when Władysław took measures to increased Casimir&#x27;s authority. Casimir did not offer much resistance to the invasion of Poland by the Teutonic Order, and he was nearly captured by the Teutonic knights before narrowly escaping into a nearby forest.

Władysław led the remainder of the Polish forces south toward the Bohemian army. The Teutonic army reached Silesia successfully and met up with the Bohemians. Władysław determined that his forces were insufficient to repel the invaders, so John of Bohemia set himself up as the occupier of Silesia. John then set off to matters in Italy when there still was a pocket of resistance in Silesia. Well-fortified Polish castles in the region held out and little would be done to capture them. This led to Braunschweig to believe that Poland would still be a major threat and that his forces could not act as they wished in the Baltic region. Braunschweig sent word to John and wanted to start a second invasion of Poland, hoping that it would be more decisive than the previous invasion attempt.

==Battle==
The plan for the Teutonic army, led by Marshal Dietrich von Altenburg, was to pull back from Poland. Władysław I the Elbow-high, who by this time was suffering from poor health, led the Polish forces. Though his troops outnumbered the Teutons, they were not equipped as well as their enemy. The Polish king followed the Teutonic army and found an opportunity when Marshal Dietrich von Altenburg split his forces into three sections. Władysław decided to attack the weakest of these three sections, which had descended upon the small village of Płowce. 

A heavy fog had descended over the area when Altenburg gathered his forces and divided them into five divisions. They Polish were also grouped into five divisions. A lengthy, hard-fought battle ensued that lasted from sunrise until 3:00 p.m. the same day. The armies were fairly evenly matched, and the deadlock was only broken when a horse carrying the marshal&#x27;s banner was pierced by a spear and the Teutonic army saw the banner fall, assuming that their leader had fallen, and began to flee the battle.

The Polish forces took advantage of the fleeing Teutons and struck hard, turning the tide of the battle in their favor. By the end of the battle, Władysław and his son Casimir III of Poland had 56 Teutonic knights in their custody, along with Altenburg however Teutons managed to take back most of the captives.

An army of Teutonic knights was dispatched from Prussia to relieve the forces at Płowce and were fast approaching the battle. The exhausted Polish troops engaged in another hard-fought battle, continuing until nightfall, when King Łokietek ordered the withdraw from the battlefield. Altenburg was released after he was found chained to a wagon. After the battle, the Teutonic Knights kept 56 of the most valuable Polish prisoners alive, murdering the rest. According to the chronicler Wigand from Marburg, Bishop Maciej from Gołańcza ordered to count the dead before the burial after the battle, and it was found that 4,187 fighters on both sides were killed, most of whom were Teutonic Knights.

==Aftermath==
The Chełmno Commander Otto von Lutterberg, despite repelling the attack of the Polish army, decided to stop the march to Brześć Kujawski and, under the cover of darkness, to immediately retreat to Toruń without burying his own fallen. The decision to withdraw the Teutonic forces also meant that the entire campaign in Poland was interrupted, and therefore this battle can be considered a strategic success of Władysław Łokietek. The battle also prevented the Teutonic army from joining the Czech troops of John of Luxembourg, whose cooperation could lead to the collapse of the recently reunited Kingdom of Poland.

After the battle, both sides tried to use their successes for propaganda purposes. The battle greatly strengthened the morale of Polish troops and made a great impression on the fourteenth century Polish society. The conviction of the triumph of the Polish army was emphasized by the ceremonial entry of Władysław Łokietek to Krakow with the captured Commander Henryk Reuss von Plauen and 40 other prisoners. The fact that the battle was a Polish success is also evidenced by the Teutonic Order&#x27;s report from 1335 for the Teutonic prosecutor at the papal curia in Avignon.

<text>Crawford is an impact crater near Adelaide in South Australia, Australia.

The Crawford crater is up to 8.5 km long, and is thought to have been formed by oblique (low angle) impact. Its age is estimated to be greater than 35 million years (probably Eocene). Quartz rocks affected by impact-related pressure are present at the site, which is a flat area. The affected rocks are exposed at the surface.

<text>In fishing, a bumper knot (also known as a bait loop or egg loop) can be used to secure soft or loose bait, including clusters of eggs, to a hook.

==Instructions==
The first suggestion for tying the bumper knot is to always keep the loops tight. If the loops become loose at all the knot will not work. The initial string used for the lead usually consumes about 8 inches when tying. To start tying the knot, hold the bend of the hook, and start feeding one end of the line through the eye of the hook. Do this until it is possible to grasp it with the same fingers holding the hook. After that, start to wrap the line around the shank of the hook in a clockwise direction. It is known that the first loop is also the toughest to make. Altogether, about 18-20 loops will be adequate. It needs to be tight and there needs to be a lot of pressure on the line. Then place the opposite end of the leader in a parallel direction to the shank of the hook and put it through the eye. All this needs to be done so that the previous loops do not come undone. Wrap over the line that is put through the eye, and make these wraps clockwise. On this set, it is recommended to only wrap with medium pressure. For about four or five wraps, continue to work with this process and make sure that they do not overlap. Then grasp all of the wraps on the hook to hold them tightly. Then pull the line hanging out of the eye and pull it through the wraps. The final step is to make everything snug and in place.

<doc id="779994" wikidata="Q4647908" url="?curid=779994" title="A. J. Cook (trade unionist)">
<text>Arthur James Cook (22 November 1883 – 2 November 1931) was a British trade union leader who was General Secretary of the Miners&#x27; Federation of Great Britain from 1924 until 1931, a period that included the 1926 General Strike.

==Biography==
===Early years===
A. J. Cook was born to Thomas and Selina Cook in Wookey, Somerset. Cook spent the early part of his life in the West Country. Cook later described his childhood as a troubled one, which included both a poor relationship with his family as well as a struggle in school.

===Political career===
As a result, at the age of 18, Cook moved to Porth in South Wales, and later to Merthyr Tydfil, to find work in the coal mines; and was also a lay preacher in the local Baptist chapel. In this mining town, Cook first became involved in politics, committing active service to the Independent Labour Party (ILP). He came to prominence in the Cambrian Coal Dispute in 1910 and went on to active involvement in the Miners&#x27; Unofficial Reform Committee which published the famous syndicalist pamphlet &#x27;The Miners&#x27; Next Step&#x27; in 1912. The pamphlet argued that the left needed to organise from below to gain control of the leadership of the union.

Cook opposed World War I and in March 1918 was arrested and charged with sedition under the Defence of the Realm Act. He was sentenced to three months&#x27; imprisonment.

Having established a reputation as being a left wing politician, Cook spent the next ten years following through on this initiative. In September 1920, Cook was a founding member of the short-lived Communist Party of South Wales and the West of England, which had emerged from South Wales Socialist Society sharing a similar rejection of parliamentarism as the Communist Party (British Section of the Third International) who held their third conference in Cardiff in December 1920. In 1921, Cook was selected to be the SWMF representative on the MFGB executive and spent another brief period in prison in the same year for incitement and unlawful assembly. In 1924 the Miners&#x27; Minority Movement was able to force Frank Hodges to resign his union office, and thus an election was held to determine the next leader of the movement. The South Wales Miners&#x27; Federation nominated A. J. Cook to replace him, and he beat Joseph Jones for the post by 217,664 votes to 202,297. Cook was then 39 years old.
On learning of his election, Trades Union Congress general secretary Fred Bramley exploded in outrage against Cook&#x27;s election, claiming him to be a &quot;raving Communist&quot;. Regardless, he was General Secretary of the Miners&#x27; Federation of Great Britain from 1924 until 1931, a period that included the 1926 General Strike, about which he wrote the pamphlet &quot;The Nine Days&quot;. This led to his becoming closely associated with the slogan, &quot;Not a penny off the pay, not a minute on the day&quot;. He was also elected as secretary of the International Miners&#x27; Federation.

Although a member of the Independent Labour Party, Cook worked closely with the Communist Party after its formation in 1920 and the National Minority Movement from 1924 to 1929. Arthur Horner, a leading South Wales Communist and mining militant described Cook&#x27;s tenure as General Secretary as &quot;a time for new ideas — an agitator, a man with a sense of adventure&quot;.

===Death===
Cook was seriously injured from an aggravated miner attack on him during the 1926 strike, with his leg having to be amputated and died from complications (with some sources stating he died of cancer) at the Manor House Hospital, London in 1931, aged 47.

<doc id="779999" wikidata="Q832786" url="?curid=779999" title="Let There Be Rock">
<text>Let There Be Rock is the fourth studio album by Australian rock band AC/DC. It was originally released on 21 March 1977 in Australasia, through Albert Productions label. A modified international edition was released on 25 July 1977, through Atlantic Records. It was the last AC/DC album to feature Mark Evans on bass.

==Background==
In late 1976 AC/DC were in a slump. &quot;It was very close to being all over&quot;, manager Michael Browning said. &quot;Things were progressing very well in London and Europe. We&#x27;d been through a whole thing with the Marquee where they broke all the house records. We&#x27;d done the &#x27;Lock Up Your Daughters&#x27; UK tour and the Reading Festival. It was all shaping up really well.&quot;
 &quot;In the middle of the tour, I get a phone call saying Atlantic Records in America didn&#x27;t like the &quot;Dirty Deeds&quot; album&quot;, said Browning. &quot;That, in fact, they were going to drop the group from the label. And that&#x27;s when things got really bad.&quot;

Angus Young said, &quot;Our brother George asked us what kind of album we wanted to make and we said it would be great if we could just make a lot of guitar riffs, because we were all fired up after doing all this touring.&quot;

==Artwork==
The Australian cover features the fingers of guitarist Chris Turner, from Australian band Buffalo. &quot;There was a bloke called Colin Stead, who was in Buffalo for about ten minutes,&quot; Turner recalled. &quot;He was also the centrefold photographer for &quot;Playboy&quot;. He phoned me up and said he was doing the album cover for &quot;Let There Be Rock&quot;, but AC/DC were out of town, so could I help out? He wanted a flash guitar run up and down the neck. Apparently, when he saw it, Angus said, &#x27;He&#x27;s got fat fingers, hasn&#x27;t he?&#x27;&quot;

The cover of the international version, released in July 1977, marked the first appearance of the band&#x27;s now iconic logo, designed by Gerard Huerta. The photograph used for the international cover was taken at a concert on 19 March 1977 at the Kursaal Ballroom, Southend, Essex, UK, by rock photographer Keith Morris.

==Reception==

Reception to &quot;Let There Be Rock&quot; was extremely positive; according to AllMusic, which gave the album a rating of four and a half out of five stars in a retrospective review, AC/DC played &quot;sweaty, dirty, nasty rock&quot; and the band had &quot;rarely done that kind of rock better than they did&quot; on &quot;Let There Be Rock&quot;.
In 2001, &quot;Q&quot; magazine named &quot;Let There Be Rock&quot; as one of the &quot;50 Heaviest Albums of All Time&quot;.

&quot;Cashbox&quot; said &quot;Heavy metal is their special forte and there is plenty of voltage displayed on this electrified disc.&quot;

Eduardo Rivadavia of AllMusic enthuses, &quot;&quot;Let There Be Rock&quot; sees AC/DC&#x27;s religious-like respect for the simple art of making rock &amp; roll brought to its logical conclusion: a veritable gospel to the glory of rock, canonized here in hymn-like worship. The near-epic title track to what is widely regarded as the best Bon Scott-era album, the song is a holy testimony, bringing good news to all those who believe in the healing power of rock &amp; roll -- amen! Oh yeah, it also kicks unholy ass!&quot;

David Fricke of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; wrote of the album in a 2008 cover story, &quot;AC/DC&#x27;s early albums were perfectly frenetic, but inconsistent. Their second U.S. LP was almost all killer. Scott sings &#x27;Bad Boy Boogie&#x27; and &#x27;Problem Child&#x27; like he&#x27;s the &quot;enfant terrible&quot;...Angus&#x27; solos are true white heat.&quot; In 2006, AC/DC biographer Murray Engleheart wrote that &quot;Let There Be Rock&quot; &quot;elevated AC/DC to the status of an album band, something that had previously been the exclusive domain of the likes of The Rolling Stones, The Who and Led Zeppelin.&quot; In 2000, Angus Young recalled to &quot;Guitar World&quot; that producer Mutt Lange once told him &quot;of all the many albums we&#x27;d done with my brother George and his partner, Harry Vanda, the one Mutt wished he would have done, where he was envious of George, was &quot;Let There Be Rock&quot;.&quot; Band biographer Jesse Fink writes, &quot;Wherever AC/DC ended up in the annals of rock history, this album would stand for all time as an expression of their unrivaled might as a guitar band.&quot;

On 28 January 1867, representatives of thirteen football clubs from the Sheffield area met at the Adelphi Hotel to form the &quot;Youdan Prize Committee&quot;. The committee drew up the following regulations to govern the tournament:

* Matches would be played under Sheffield Rules.
* Matches would start at three o&#x27;clock, with two umpires and one referee.
* There would be 12 players on each side.
* Games would last ninety minutes. If the scores were tied, up to one hour of extra time would be played, with the first team to score during this period being declared the winner. If scores were still tied after extra time, the match would be replayed.

After the first round, the committee added a new rule that &quot;the referee shall have power to award a Free Kick to the opponents of any Club, which makes more than three fouls or kicks-out, when the ball is being thrown in, if he (the referee) considers those fouls or kicks-out to be intentional&quot;.

==Participating teams==

==Format==

The competition was organised as a straight knockout tournament, with two exceptions:

* Because twelve teams entered the tournament, there were three teams remaining after two rounds: one team, drawn at random, received a bye to the final, while the other two teams played a semi-final to determine the other finalist.
* After the final had been played, it was decided to hold a second-place playoff between the losing finalist and the losing semi-finalist.

The semi-final, final and second-place playoff were all held at Bramall Lane, which at the time was primarily a cricket ground.

==Results==

Under the Sheffield Rules of the time, the rouge was used as a tiebreaker if both teams scored an equal number of goals.

Of the thirteen matches played in the tournament, seven were goalless, of which six were decided by rouges. Only one goal was scored after the first round.

In the results below, rouges are shown in brackets beneath the main scoreline.

==Trophy==

The Youdan Prize Committee invited members of the public to submit their proposed designs for the trophy. The creator of the entry judged the best would be rewarded by Thomas Youdan with a prize of one sovereign.

This prize was initially awarded to a Mr Jarvis, of Roscoe Works. His design was subsequently combined with that of another entrant: Mr. Topham, engraver, who was awarded a further prize of one pound.

Before the semi-final, it was decided that the second-placed club would also be awarded a prize, to be funded by an admission fee of 3d at the semi-final and final. This prize ended up being valued at £2 10s.

The trophies were presented at a dinner held at the Adelphi Hotel on Monday 11 March. Because the winning design required &quot;protracted time [...] in its manufacture&quot;, it had not been completed in time for the ceremony. In its place, a &quot;richly-ornamented claret jug&quot;, created by Martin, Hall, and Co., was awarded to Hallam. Thomas Youdan was absent through illness, so the trophy was presented by Mr J. Birley to J. C. Shaw, Hallam&#x27;s captain. The second prize, a &quot;double-handed goblet [...] enriched with athletic figures&quot;, was awarded to Norfolk.

The inscription on the cup awarded to Hallam reads: 
Shaw presented the trophy to the members of the Hallam Club at a dinner after the final match of their season, played at Sandygate on Saturday 16 March.
The first-place trophy was subsequently lost. It did not resurface again until 1997, when a Scottish antiques collector contacted Hallam F.C. to tell them that he was in possession of it – they subsequently bought it back for £1,600. Since then it has been valued to be worth at least £100,000 by silver specialist Alastair Dickenson of the BBC programme &quot;Antiques Roadshow&quot;, although the owners have insisted it is not for sale.

==Legacy==
Attendances of up to 3,000 were reported in the press. This would not be exceeded by the reported attendance at an FA Cup final until 1878.

Contemporary reports suggest that the 1867 tournament was expected to be repeated in subsequent years, with Youdan awarding a trophy of the original competition-winning design. This did not occur, and in the event the Cromwell Cup was held in 1868, sponsored and named after another Sheffield theatre owner. Youdan nevertheless maintained an interest in football, for example by donating £50 in prize money to the Sheffield Football Association in 1870.

The work of the ad-hoc Youdan Prize Committee in co-ordinating activity between local clubs and framing rules was a precursor to that of the Sheffield Football Association, which had already been formed by the end of January 1867, and issued its own first set of rules on 6 March 1867, the day following the final of the Youdan Cup.

The Youdan Trophy, a Sheffield-based international youth team tournament founded in 2014, takes its name from the Youdan Cup.

<doc id="780007" wikidata="Q1966068" url="?curid=780007" title="Whole Lotta Rosie">
<text>&quot;Whole Lotta Rosie&quot; is a song by Australian hard rock band AC/DC. It is the eighth and final track on the band&#x27;s fourth Australian album, &quot;Let There Be Rock&quot;, released in Australia in March 1977, and was written by Angus Young, Malcolm Young, and Bon Scott. It is also the eighth and final track on the international version of the album, released in June the same year.

It was released as a single in a few countries in 1977, backed by &quot;Dog Eat Dog&quot;. In 1978, the live version from &quot;If You Want Blood You&#x27;ve Got It&quot;, which had been recorded in Glasgow on 30 April 1978, was also released as a single in October 1978.

==Composition==
The song is about an obese Tasmanian woman, Rosie, with whom the singer (Bon Scott) had a one-night stand at the Freeway Gardens Motel in North Melbourne. In addition to pointing out the woman&#x27;s size, the singer finds her to be one of the most talented lovers he has ever experienced.

The song&#x27;s first verse reveals Rosie&#x27;s substantial physical measurements (42&quot;-39&quot;-56&quot;), and that she weighs nineteen stone, or . On the &quot;Live from the Atlantic Studios&quot; disc, however, Scott describes the titular woman as &quot;... a Tasmanian devil ... weighs ...,&quot; a measurement that differs from the &quot;nineteen stone&quot; lyric.

In 1998, speaking to &quot;Vox&quot; magazine, Angus Young remembered:We&#x27;d been in Tasmania and after the show [Bon Scott] said he was going to check out a few clubs. He said he&#x27;d got about 100 yards down the street when he heard this yell: &#x27;Hey! Bon!&#x27; He looked around and saw this leg and thought: &#x27;Oh well!&#x27; From what he said, there was this Rosie woman and a friend of hers. They were plying him with drinks and Rosie said to him: &#x27;This month I&#x27;ve slept with 28 famous people,&#x27; and Bon went: &#x27;Oh yeah?!&#x27; Anyway, in the morning he said he woke up pinned against the wall, he said he opened one eye and saw her lean over to her friend and whisper: &#x27;29!&#x27; There&#x27;s very few people who&#x27;ll go out and write a song about a big fat lady, but Bon said it was worthy. 

In 2021, the woman the song was written about was identified by British-Australian AC/DC biographer Jesse Fink as Rosemaree (or stylized as Rose-Maree) Garcia, an Australian sex worker who saw Scott for some time before he went to England. Rosie was indeed born in Launceston, Tasmania, lived in St Kilda and died in the Melbourne suburb of Prahran in 1979, aged 22.

In 2023, Fink released the first known photograph of Rosie Garcia.

==Early version==
The song&#x27;s main riff was also featured on an earlier recording with different lyrics, titled &quot;Dirty Eyes&quot;, which saw official release on &quot;Volts&quot;, part of the &quot;Bonfire&quot; box set. &quot;Dirty Eyes&quot; features a different chord progression in the chorus, as well as a slower tempo than &quot;Rosie&quot;.

In September 1976, &quot;Dirty Eyes&quot; was first recorded by AC/DC, along with &quot;Carry Me Home&quot; and &quot;Love at First Feel&quot; for a possible EP. This recording is possibly the version that was later issued on the &quot;Bonfire&quot; boxed set. The EP was scrapped, leaving &quot;Love at First Feel&quot; as a fill-in for the upcoming International &quot;Dirty Deeds Done Dirt Cheap&quot; album and &quot;Carry Me Home&quot; as a b-side. In the following months, &quot;Dirty Eyes&quot; was recrafted into &quot;Whole Lotta Rosie,&quot; and recorded during the &quot;Let There Be Rock&quot; sessions of January–February 1977.

When the song was released as a single in 1978 it was heavily edited, making the song considerably shorter. A big part of the guitar solo was left out as well as the characteristic guitar-band duel.

==Live recordings and performances==
One of AC/DC&#x27;s most popular songs, &quot;Whole Lotta Rosie&quot; has been included on each of the band&#x27;s official live albums: three with Scott &quot;If You Want Blood You&#x27;ve Got It&quot; (short version which misses the second guitar solo), &quot;Live from the Atlantic Studios&quot;, &quot;Let There Be Rock: The Movie – Live in Paris&quot;, the latter two released in 1997 as part of the &quot;Bonfire&quot; box set, and also four with Brian Johnson (released on &quot;Live&quot;, &quot;&quot;, the tour edition of &quot;Stiff Upper Lip&quot;, and also on &quot;Live at River Plate&quot;). The only other song that appears on all these releases is &quot;The Jack&quot;. A live video of &quot;Whole Lotta Rosie&quot; is also featured on the DVD &quot;Family Jewels&quot;, from a 1978 performance on the BBC&#x27;s TV concert series &quot;Rock Goes to College&quot;, on which Scott refers to Rosie as the &quot;biggest, fattest woman who ever fornicated.&quot;

The song was first played live in February 1977, with the 15 February 1977 Perth Entertainment Centre show being the earliest known performance (and possibly the very first time the song was played live since it was not played at the other few shows before. Bootlegs of the Perth show and the few shows before exist). Since then, the song has been played at almost every AC/DC concert.

When the song is performed live, the crowd will usually shout &quot;Angus!&quot; in between each of the opening riffs. This has its origins in the version heard on &quot;If You Want Blood You&#x27;ve Got It&quot;.

The latest live performances of &quot;Whole Lotta Rosie&quot; were accompanied by a giant, inflatable &quot;Rosie&quot; as seen on the &quot;Live at Donington&quot; video. The inflatable Rosie was first used on the 1990/91 &quot;The Razors Edge&quot; tour. In March 2005, &quot;Q&quot; magazine placed the live version from &quot;If You Want Blood ...&quot; at number 16 in its list of the 100 Greatest Guitar Tracks. 

Rosie was seen (at the same table as Brian Johnson) during the cartoon intro video that was played on the Black Ice World Tour. The song was also used in Brian Johnson&#x27;s audition as Scott&#x27;s successor.

==Covers==
&quot;Whole Lotta Rosie&quot; was covered by Guns N&#x27; Roses, who included it on the 1987 UK vinyl singles of &quot;Welcome to the Jungle&quot; and the 1988 &quot;Live from the Jungle&quot; album. It has also been played as part of Guns N&#x27; Roses&#x27; concerts.

Australian psychedelic band Electric Hippies recorded a cover in 1995 for the &quot;Fuse Box&quot; alternative tribute album.

It was also covered by W.A.S.P. on the American version of the 1996 &quot;Still Not Black Enough&quot; album.

The Japanese power metal band Galneryus released a cover of it, on their 2007 &quot;Voices from the Past&quot; EP, which is an EP of 5 cover songs. 
Another cover version, by Steel Panther, was released in 2010 on &quot;The Metal Forge Volume Two (A Tribute To AC/DC)&quot; by Metal Hammer.

Bullet for My Valentine also released a cover of the song as a bonus track on their 2013 album &quot;Temper Temper&quot;.

==In other media==
A live version of this song is included on &quot;AC/DC Live: Rock Band Track Pack&quot;.

<doc id="780010" wikidata="Q6392130" url="?curid=780010" title="Kentuckiana">
<text>Kentuckiana, a portmanteau of Kentucky and Indiana, is the area in the Upland South region of the United States containing metropolitan areas with counties in both Kentucky and Indiana. Kentuckiana is primarily the Louisville metropolitan area, including nine counties in Kentucky (Jefferson, Bullitt, Hardin,
Oldham,
Meade, Shelby, Trimble, Henry, and Spencer) and five counties in Southern Indiana (Clark, Floyd, Harrison, Scott, and Washington). This area &quot;is regularly referred to as Kentuckiana&quot;.

One other area that could lay claim to using the name is the combined metros of Evansville, Indiana and Owensboro, Kentucky, though that region identifies more on its own as &quot;The Tri-State Area&quot; combined. Dearborn, Ohio and Franklin Counties in Indiana make up the western portion of the Cincinnati metropolitan area and make no claims to the Kentuckiana name on their own.

==Etymology==
The original meaning of the term &quot;Kentuckiana&quot; dates back to the 19th century as a collection of items from or relating to Kentucky. The modern meaning of term as a geographical area was coined by &quot;The Louisville Courier-Journal&quot; and &quot;The Louisville Times&quot; sometime during the 1930s. This second definition originally referred to only Jefferson County, Kentucky and Clark and Floyd Counties in Indiana- this referring to the geographic center of the Louisville metropolitan area. Since the 1980s the term has expanded to include more counties on both sides of the Ohio River. Today it refers to an indefinitely large region where Kentucky and Indiana meet, usually centered on Louisville, Kentucky.

<doc id="780014" wikidata="Q1777274" url="?curid=780014" title="Bone age">
<text>Bone age is the degree of a person&#x27;s skeletal development. In children, bone age serves as a measure of physiological maturity and aids in the diagnosis of growth abnormalities, endocrine disorders, and other medical conditions. As a person grows from fetal life through childhood, puberty, and finishes growth as a young adult, the bones of the skeleton change in size and shape. These changes can be seen by x-ray and other imaging techniques. A comparison between the appearance of a patient&#x27;s bones to a standard set of bone images known to be representative of the average bone shape and size for a given age can be used to assign a &quot;bone age&quot; to the patient.

Bone age is distinct from an individual&#x27;s biological or chronological age, which is the amount of time that has elapsed since birth. Discrepancies between bone age and biological age can be seen in people with stunted growth, where bone age may be less than biological age. Similarly, a bone age that is older than a person&#x27;s chronological age may be detected in a child growing faster than normal. A delay or advance in bone age is most commonly associated with normal variability in growth, but significant deviations between bone age and biological age may indicate an underlying medical condition that requires treatment. A child&#x27;s current height and bone age can be used to predict adult height. Other uses of bone age measurements include assisting in the diagnosis of medical conditions affecting children, such as constitutional growth delay, precocious puberty, thyroid dysfunction, growth hormone deficiency, and other causes of abnormally short or tall stature.

In the United States, the most common technique for estimating a person&#x27;s bone age is to compare an x-ray of the patient&#x27;s left hand and wrist to a reference atlas containing x-ray images of the left hands of children considered to be representative of how the skeletal structure of the hand appears for the average person at a given age. A paediatric radiologist specially trained in estimating bone age assesses the patient&#x27;s x-ray for growth, shape, size, and other bone features. The image in the reference atlas that most closely resembles the patient&#x27;s x-ray is then used to assign a bone age to the patient. Other techniques for estimating bone age exist, including x-ray comparisons of the bones of the knee or elbow to a reference atlas and magnetic resonance imaging approaches.

== Measurement techniques ==
Estimating the bone age of a living child is typically performed by comparing images of their bones to images of models of the average skeleton for a given age and sex acquired from healthy children and compiled in an atlas. Features of bone development assessed in determining bone age include the presence of bones (have certain bones ossified yet), the size and shape of bones, the amount of mineralization (also called ossification), and the degree of fusion between the epiphyses and metaphyses. The first atlas published in 1898 by John Poland consisted of x-ray images of the left hand and wrist. Since then, updated atlases of the left hand and wrist have appeared, along with atlases of the foot and ankle, knee, and elbow. An alternative approach to the atlas method just described is the so-called &quot;single-bone method&quot; where maturity scales are assigned to individual bones. Here, a selection of bones are given a score based on their perceived development, a sum is totaled based on the individual bone scores, and the sum is correlated to a final bone age.

=== Evaluation of the bones of the hand and wrist ===
The two most common techniques for estimating bone age are based on a posterior-anterior x-ray of a patient&#x27;s left hand, fingers, and wrist. The reason for imaging only the left hand and wrist are that a hand is easily x-rayed with minimal radiation and shows many bones in a single view. Further, most people are right-hand dominant and the left hand is therefore less likely to be deformed due to trauma. Finally, only the wrist and hand are imaged out of a desire to minimize the amount of potentially harmful ionizing radiation delivered to a child.

==== Greulich and Pyle atlas ====
In the United States, bone age is usually determined by comparing an x-ray of the patient&#x27;s left hand and wrist to a set of reference images contained in the Greulich and Pyle atlas. Drs. William Walter Greulich and Sarah Idell Pyle published the first edition of their standard reference atlas of x-ray images of the left hands and wrists of boys and girls in 1950. The Greulich and Pyle atlas contains x-ray images of the left hands and wrists of different children deemed to be good models of the average appearance of the bones of the hand at a given age. The atlas has a set of images arranged in chronological order by age for males ranging from 3 months to 19 years and for females ranging from 3 months to 18 years in varying intervals of 3 months to 1 year.

Images in the Greulich and Pyle atlas came from healthy white boys and girls enrolled in the Brush Foundation Study for Human Growth and Development between the years 1931 and 1942.

To assign a bone age to the patient under review, a radiologist compares the patient&#x27;s hand and wrist x-ray to images in the Greulich and Pyle atlas. Assessment of the carpals, metacarpals, and phalanges are used to find the closest match in the atlas; the chronological age of the patient in the atlas becomes the bone age assigned to the patient under review. If a patient&#x27;s x-ray is found to be very close in appearance to two contiguous images in the atlas, then an average of the chronological ages in the atlas may be used as the patient&#x27;s bone age, although some evaluators choose to interpolate the closest age while others report a range of possible bone ages.

A drawback associated with the Greulich and Pyle method of assessing bone age is that it relies on x-ray imaging and therefore requires exposing the patient to ionizing radiation. Further, there can be moderate levels of variability in the bone ages assigned to the same patient by different assessors. Other downsides are that the atlas has not been updated since 1959 and the images in the atlas were acquired from healthy white children living in Cleveland, Ohio in the 1930s and 1940s and therefore may not yield accurate bone age assignments when applied to non-white patients or unhealthy children.

==== Tanner-Whitehouse method ====
The Tanner-Whitehouse (TW) technique of estimating bone is a &quot;single-bone method&quot; based on an x-ray image of a patient&#x27;s left hand and wrist. There have been two updates since the first publication of the TW method in 1962: the TW2 method in 1975 and the TW3 method in 2001. The TW methods consist of evaluating individual bones and assigning a letter grade to each bone based on its degree of maturation. Next, the scores for all evaluated bones are compiled into a sum, and that sum is correlated to bone age through a lookup table for males or females depending on the sex of the patient.

The bones considered in the TW3 method include the distal radius and ulna, the metacarpals and phalanges of the 1st, 3rd, and 5th fingers, and all of the carpal bones except the pisiform.

=== Knee maturation ===
An atlas based on knee maturation has also been compiled.

=== Hemiskeleton method ===
The bones in the hand a wrist in a newborn do not change much in the first year of life. However, most pediatric radiologists still use the Greulich and Pyle technique for estimating bone age in infancy. Alternative techniques for estimating bone age in infancy include tallying the number of ossification centers present in the left half of the infant&#x27;s body requiring a hemiskeleton x-ray. One common method based on x-rays of the hemiskeleton is the Sontag method. This technique was created to avoid errors in estimating bone age thought to arise from focusing on only one area of the body. The Sontag method uses x-rays of all the bones and joints of the upper and lower limbs on the left side of the body. Then, a radiologist counts the number of ossification centers present and uses a chart to convert the sum of ossification centers to a bone age. There is a chart for males and another for females with possible bone ages ranging from 1 month to 5 years. Since most of the ossification centers counted using this technique appear early in life, this method is only valid for measuring bone age up to around 5 years of age.

=== Evaluation of cervical vertebrae ===
Lamparski (1972) used the cervical vertebrae and found them to be as reliable and valid as the hand-wrist area for assessing skeletal age. He developed a series of standards for the assessment of skeletal age for both males and females. This method has the advantage of eliminating the need for additional radiographic exposure in cases where the vertebrae have already been recorded on a lateral cephalometric radiographic. This method is called the Cervical vertebral maturation method

Hassel &amp; Farman (1995) developed an index based on the second, third, and fourth cervical vertebrae (C2, C3, C4) and proved that atlas maturation was highly correlated with skeletal maturation of the hand-wrist. Several smartphone applications have been developed to facilitate the use of vertebral methods such as &quot;Easy Age&quot;.

== Clinical significance ==
Assessment of a patient&#x27;s bone age is used in pediatric medicine to help determine if a child is growing normally. Large differences between a person&#x27;s bone age and their chronological age may indicate a growth disorder. For example, a patient&#x27;s bone age may be less than their chronological age suggesting a delay in growth as may be caused by a growth hormone deficiency. In the case of too much growth hormone, a child may have a bone age that is older than their chronological age suggesting that they are growing abnormally fast. Since bone age measurements are inherently approximations, they are conventionally reported with a standard deviation which serves as an estimate of the associated error. For a child&#x27;s bone age to be considered abnormal, the chronological age must differ from the assigned bone age by more than 2 standard deviations.

Bone age acts as a surrogate for physiological development because growth and maturation of the skeletal system depend on the presence of hormones like growth hormone, sex steroids (e.g., estrogen and testosterone), and thyroxine. Studies of bone age in children allow physicians to correlate a child&#x27;s current height and bone age to their predicted future maximum height in adulthood.

Not only can bone age help in diagnosing a child with a growth abnormality, but it can also play a role in treatment. In certain instances, abnormal growth conditions may be treated with supplemental hormone therapy. The best time to start and stop such therapies can be determined based on a patient&#x27;s bone age.

=== Height prediction ===
Statistics have been compiled to indicate the percentage of height growth remaining at a given bone age. By simple arithmetic, a predicted adult height can be computed from a child&#x27;s height and bone age. Separate tables are used for boys and girls because of the sex difference in timing of puberty, and slightly different percentages are used for children with unusually advanced or delayed bone maturation. These tables, the Bayley-Pinneau tables, are included as an appendix in the Greulich and Pyle atlas.

In several conditions involving atypical growth, bone age height predictions are less accurate. For example, in children born small for gestational age who remain short after birth, bone age is a poor predictor of adult height.

=== Evaluation of growth abnormalities ===
For the average person with average puberty, the bone age would match the person&#x27;s chronological age. In terms of height growth and height growth related to bone age, average females stop growing taller two years earlier than average males. Peak height velocity (PHV) occurs at the average age of 11 years for girls and at the average age of 13 years for boys. While there is no exact age for the culmination of bone maturity, modern research suggests a range of between 15-17 years for bone maturity in boys and 14-16 years for girls.

There are exceptions with people who have an &quot;advanced&quot; bone age (bone age is older than chronological age) due to being an early bloomer (someone starting puberty and hitting PHV earlier than average), being an early bloomer with precocious puberty, or having another condition. There are also exceptions with people who have a &quot;delayed&quot; bone age (bone age is younger than chronological age) due to being a late bloomer (someone starting puberty and hitting PHV later than average), being a late bloomer with delayed puberty, or having another condition.

An &quot;advanced&quot; bone age is common when a child has had prolonged elevation of sex steroid levels, as in precocious puberty or congenital adrenal hyperplasia. The bone age is often marginally advanced with premature adrenarche, when a child is overweight from a young age or when a child has lipodystrophy. Those with an advanced bone age typically hit a growth spurt early on but stop growing at an earlier age. Bone age may be significantly advanced in genetic overgrowth syndromes, such as Sotos syndrome, Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome and Marshall-Smith syndrome.

Bone maturation is &quot;delayed&quot; with the variation of normal development termed constitutional delay of growth and puberty, but delay also accompanies growth failure due to growth hormone deficiency and hypothyroidism.

Recent studies show that organs like the liver can also be used to estimate age and sex, because of the unique feature of liver. Liver weight increases with age and is different between males and females. Thus, the liver can be employed in special medico-legal cases of skeletal deformities or mutilation.

A table of possible causes of abnormal stature and the expected bone age associated with each condition is provided below.

== Physiology ==
Formation of the human skeletal system begins in fetal life with the development of a loosely ordered connective tissue known as mesenchyme. The cells of the mesenchyme can become bone by one of two primary methods: (1) intramembranous ossification where mesenchymal cells differentiate directly into bone or (2) endochondral ossification where mesenchymal cells become a cartilaginous model of chondrocytes which then become bone. The bones of the limbs form and lengthen through endochondral ossification beginning by the 12th week after fertilization.

At birth, only the metaphyses of the &quot;long bones&quot; are present. The long bones are those that grow primarily by elongation at an epiphysis at one end of the growing bone. The long bones include the femurs, tibias, and fibulas of the lower limb, the humeri, radii, and ulnas of the upper limb (arm + forearm), and the phalanges of the fingers and toes. The long bones of the leg comprise nearly half of adult height. The other primary skeletal component of height is the spine and skull.
As a child grows the epiphyses become calcified and appear on x-rays, as do the carpal and tarsal bones of the hands and feet, separated on x-rays by a layer of invisible cartilage where most of the growth is occurring. As sex steroid levels rise during puberty, bone maturation accelerates. As growth nears conclusion and attainment of adult height, bones begin to approach the size and shape of adult bones. The remaining cartilaginous portions of the epiphyses become thinner. As these cartilaginous zones become obliterated, the epiphyses are said to be &quot;closed&quot; and no further lengthening of the bones will occur. A small amount of spinal growth concludes an adolescent&#x27;s growth.

The carpal bones arise from primary ossification centers and continue their calcification in an outward manner. The emergence of the primary ossification centers of the carpal bones appear in a predictable order that can help in determining bone age. First the capitate forms at an average age of 2 months, followed shortly by the hamate, then the triquetrum around 14 months, and so on.

<text>Bramall Lane is a football stadium in Sheffield, South Yorkshire, England, which is the home of Sheffield United.

The stadium was originally a cricket ground, built on a road named after the Bramall family of file and graver manufacturers. The Bramalls owned The Old White House, on the corner of Bramall Lane and Cherry Street, and the Sheaf House, now a pub, that still stands at the top of Bramall Lane.

It was the largest stadium in Sheffield in the 19th century, and hosted the city&#x27;s most significant matches, including the final of the world&#x27;s first football tournament, first floodlit match and several matches between the Sheffield and London Football Associations that led to the unification of their respective rules. It was also used by The Wednesday F.C. (later called Sheffield Wednesday) and Sheffield FC. It has been the home of Sheffield United since the club&#x27;s establishment in 1889. It is the oldest major stadium in the world still hosting professional association football matches.

Bramall Lane is one of only two grounds (the other being the Oval) which has hosted England football internationals (five games before 1930), an England Test cricket match (in 1902, against Australia) and an FA Cup Final (the 1912 replay, in which Barnsley beat West Bromwich Albion 1–0). It also regularly hosted FA Cup semi-finals and replays between 1889 and 1938. In 2022, it hosted UEFA Women&#x27;s Euro 2022 matches.

The ground has also hosted rugby league games for the Sheffield Eagles, as well as for the delayed 2021 Rugby League World Cup in 2022. The ground also hosted a Billy Graham revival meeting in 1985, rock concerts by Bruce Springsteen in 1988, a friendly match for the 150th anniversary of Sheffield FC when they played Inter Milan in 2007, a Travis Pastrana Motor cross event in 2016, an IBF Welterweight title boxing match featuring Sheffield United fan Kell Brook in 2017, the Women&#x27;s League Cup final and a Rod Stewart concert in 2019, and Def Leppard and Mötley Crüe rock concerts in 2023. The stadium has also been used to host England men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s senior and youth teams in friendly and competitive matches.

The record attendance at the ground is 68,287, set during an FA Cup fifth round tie between Sheffield United and Leeds United on 15 February 1936. The ground was extensively renovated in the wake of the Taylor Report and has an all-seated capacity of 32,050.

==History==
===Cricket===

Bramall Lane opened as a cricket ground in 1855, having been leased by Michael Ellison from the Duke of Norfolk at an annual rent of £70. The site was then away from the city&#x27;s industrial area, and relatively free from smoke. It was built to host the matches of local cricket clubs and originally had six clubs playing there, one of whom was the Wednesday Cricket Club, which was founded in 1820 and turned out to be the direct forerunner of Sheffield Wednesday Football Club.

Bramall Lane opened on 30 April 1855 as a cricket ground with a match between &quot;The Eleven&quot; and &quot;The Twenty Two&quot;, The Eleven, despite being the senior team, lost by an innings and 28 runs.

A team representing Yorkshire played the first county match at the ground, on 27 August 1855 against Sussex, but lost by an innings and 117 runs.

Although the first county game had been played eight years earlier, the official Yorkshire County Cricket Club was not formed until 1863. The idea came from Ellison, who was using his own finances to support the club, in order to improve Bramall Lane&#x27;s financial position as the county&#x27;s headquarters. It was the club&#x27;s headquarters until 1893, when they moved to Headingley in Leeds.

In 1897, Jack Brown and John Tunnicliffe recorded a first wicket score of 378 against Sussex — a ground record that stands to this day. Brown&#x27;s score of 311 and Yorkshire&#x27;s innings of 681–5 declared were also records when the cricket ground closed. Other notable scores include 582–7 against Surrey in 1935 and 579 against the touring South Africa team in 1951. Six other scores in excess of 500 were made. In contrast there were a host of scores under 100, mainly in the 19th century, although Derbyshire&#x27;s paltry total of 20 in 1939 remains the lowest ever score. Nottinghamshire were dismissed for 24 in 1888, but Kent bowled Yorkshire out for 30 during a match in 1865. Many of the low totals were made on rain affected, uncovered wickets.

The ground hosted a single Test match in 1902, against Australia, which England lost by 143 runs. Australia won thanks to a century by Clem Hill and the bowling of Saunders and Noble, who each took five wickets in England&#x27;s first innings of 145 and Noble and Trumble who took six and four wickets respectively to bowl the home team out for 195 second time around. The defeat was blamed on the poor light at the ground; a product of smoke emitted by local factories. Attendances were poor and the experiment was never repeated.

In addition, Jack Brown&#x27;s triple century 10 double centuries were scored on the ground. Len Hutton scored unbeaten two double centuries, a 280 not out against Hampshire in 1939 and 271 not out against Derbyshire in 1937. W Barber posted 255 against Surrey in 1935 while the great Indian batsman V.S. Hazare scored 244 not out for the Indian tourists in the first season after World War II.

Among many notable partnerships W. Barber and Maurice Leyland amassed 346 for the second wicket against Middlesex in 1932 and the aforementioned V.S. Hazare and Vinoo Mankad put on 322 for the Indians against Yorkshire for the 4th wicket in 1946. Only one century was scored in list A one-day cricket at Bramall Lane, John Hampshire&#x27;s 108 against Nottinghamshire in 1970 in the Sunday League.

Three bowlers took all ten wickets in an innings at Bramall Lane, the feat being more common in the annals of first-class cricket than many imagine. The great Australian leg spinner Clarrie Grimmett took 10 for 37 for the tourists in 1930 while TF Smailes took all 10 for 47 for Yorkshire against Derbyshire in 1939. G. Wootton took 10 for 54 for an All England Eleven v Yorkshire in 1865 while 9 other bowlers took 9 wickets in an innings there, including a haul of 9 for 12 by the great Yorkshire slow left armer Hedley Verity.

The best match bowling figures at the ground, 16 for 114, were recorded by G. Burton of Middlesex against Yorkshire in 1888 while Hedley Verity took a remarkable 15 for 38 against Kent in 1936. Len Braund took 15 for 71 for Somerset in 1902 while W. G. Grace showed his youthful talent with the ball with a haul of 15 for 79 for Gloucestershire in 1872.

D. Hunter of Surrey dismissed caught five batsmen and stumped another in one innings in 1891 while Yorkshire stalwart Jimmy Binks completed 5 dismissals in an innings 3 times.

The two ends of the ground were known as the Pavilion End and the Football Ground End. Between 1863 and 1973, Yorkshire played 391 first class matches, including 339 County Championship matches at Bramall Lane. Yorkshire&#x27;s last match at the ground took place on 4, 6 and 7 August 1973, a drawn game against Lancashire. The construction of the South Stand began soon after, over the cricket square, finally enclosing the football pitch on all four sides. Yorkshire&#x27;s cricket games in Sheffield moved to Abbeydale Park.

===International centuries===
One Test century has been scored at the venue.

===International five-wicket hauls===
Five five-wicket hauls have been taken at the venue.
===Football===


The ground hosted its first football match on 29 December 1862, between Sheffield and Hallam The game was played to raise money for the Lancashire Distress Fund during the cotton famine and ended 0–0.

As Sheffield&#x27;s primary sporting stadium, it held all the most important local matches. Bramall Lane hosted the semi-final, final and second-place playoff of the 1867 Youdan Cup (won by Hallam). This was followed by the Cromwell Cup a year later, which was won by a newly formed team called The Wednesday. By 1877, a crowd of 8,000 watched The Wednesday beat Hallam in the Sheffield Challenge Cup. Bramall Lane effectively became The Wednesday&#x27;s permanent home between 1880 and the opening of their new stadium at Olive Grove in 1887.

The first inter-association match, between the FA (often referred to as the London FA) and Sheffield FA, was also held at Bramall Lane on 2 December 1871. It was won 3–1 by the home side, who also arranged a number of games with other Associations including regular fixtures against the Glasgow FA (the first in 1874 and the last in 1957).

On 22 March 1889, six days after 22,688 people paid to watch the FA Cup semi-final between Preston North End and West Bromwich Albion, it was decided to create a home football team to play at Bramall Lane. It was named Sheffield United after the cricket team.

===International matches===
Bramall Lane was regularly used for international matches before the construction of a national stadium in London. The world&#x27;s first ever floodlit football match took place at Bramall Lane on 14 October 1878 in front of an attendance of over 20,000. England&#x27;s match against Scotland on 10 March 1883 was the first match between these two countries outside London or Glasgow. Bramall Lane is the second-oldest football venue in the world still capable of hosting international matches, after the Racecourse Ground in Wrexham.

===UEFA Women&#x27;s Euro 2022===
Bramall Lane was one of several venues used for the UEFA Women&#x27;s Euro 2022 tournament. It was used to host Group C matches, alongside Leigh Sports Village, and a semi-final, which involved England.

==The ground today==
===The stands and layout===
The ground has been an all-seater stadium since 1994 and comprises four stands and two corner infill sections in the north-east and south-west corners. The north-west corner (as well as a lot of the land under the John Street Stand) contains the Blades Enterprise Centre. The south-west corner behind the Bramall Lane corner stand is a four-star hotel built in 2008.

====Bramall Lane Stand====

This is the oldest existing stand at Bramall Lane, this two-tiered structure was opened in 1966 behind the goal at the Bramall Lane end, opposite the Kop. The bottom tier is generally occupied by away fans whilst the upper tier, which links into the south-west corner infill stand, is given to home fans (although part of the upper tier may be offered to away fans for cup fixtures if demand is sufficient). During the 2005–06 season, the outside of the Bramall Lane Stand was reclad in red-and-white, with the stand sponsors and the club crest on the outside of the stand, while the wooden seats of the upper tier were replaced with newer plastic seats with the words &quot;BLADES&quot; written into them. When the corner infill stand was built during the close season, the roof over the Bramall Lane Stand was extended toward the pitch to provide better cover for the lower tier and to remove the supporting pillars from the upper tier. There are approximately 2,700 seats in the upper tier, and 2,990 in the lower, giving a total capacity of 5,680. This stand had for many years housed a basic LCD scoreboard and clock between the upper and lower tiers, however at the start of the 2006–07 season both were replaced by a modern colour video scoreboard.

The stand was temporarily known as the &quot;Jessica Ennis Stand&quot; following the 2012 Olympics but was renamed after sponsors in 2015. Ennis-Hill had threatened to remove her name from the stand following controversy over the club&#x27;s decision to re-sign Ched Evans after his release from prison.

====The Tony Currie Stand====

Located off Cherry Street, The Tony Currie Stand opened in August 1975. In 2018, the stand was named after Sheffield United legend Tony Currie. The Stand is also known as the &quot;South Stand&quot;, although some fans still refer to it as the &quot;Laver Stand&quot; (after the stand&#x27;s long-term sponsors in the 1990s) or even the &quot;New Stand&quot; by many older fans since there was no stand on the South end of the pitch until 1975, where previously it was used as the cricket pitch&#x27;s outfield.

During the 2005–06 season, this stand was renovated, with a re-clad of the outside of the stand and the old wooden seats replaced by newer red plastic seats and white plastic seats forming an emblem of two swords. The box-seats were also upgraded. This stand holds approximately 7,500 fans, and most of the ground&#x27;s amenities, including the box office, Blades Superstore, Platinum Suite, &quot;Legends of the Lane&quot; museum, &quot;1889&quot; award-winning restaurant (formerly known as Bosworth&#x27;s of Bramall Lane), the former police control centre (now relocated to the Blades Enterprise Centre between the Bramall Lane and John Street Stands), newly refurbished reception, press box, players entrance, administrative offices and television gantry attached to the roof of the stand.

The bottom of the stand, facing into the club car park, has been made into a fans &quot;Wall of Fame&quot;. Built of the ground&#x27;s signature mark red bricks, each one is etched with an individual supporters&#x27; name or nickname. The wall was launched as a commercial venture by the club in the 1990s and is still offered today for other sections of the ground. Within the car park situated adjacent to the stand on Cherry Street, statutes were erected in 2010 commemorating Joe Shaw, holder of United&#x27;s attendance record with 714 appearances, and Derek Dooley, former club chairman.

====The Kop Stand====

Located on Shoreham Street, The Kop has been seated since 1991, this is the area in which the most boisterous home fans sit, such that former assistant manager (1999–2003) and manager (2008–10) Kevin Blackwell named the noise coming from this stand as the &quot;Bramall Roar&quot; after the 2003 play-off semi-final second-leg against Nottingham Forest, which the Blades won 4–3, coming from 0–2 down. The stand is currently sponsored by Kennedy&#x27;s Law and, was formerly sponsored by Hallam FM. The stand itself is built into a hillside situated behind the goal, at the east end of the stadium. This places the stand along Shoreham Street, hence the often-heard chant of &quot;Shoreham boys we are here oh oh oh oh, Shoreham boys we are here oh oh oh oh etc&quot; coming from this stand on matchdays. It has the club&#x27;s initials &quot;SUFC&quot; written into the seats, and holds 10,221 fans, making this the largest stand at Bramall Lane. The facilities are of lower quality in the Kop because there is no indoor concourse, although an outdoor bar was completed in September 2007 to complement the fast-food takeaway, but in spite of this it is still a firm favourite amongst the fans, and usually full on matchday.

====John Street Stand====

The John Street stand, also known as the DSM Roofing stand for sponsorship reasons, is used as a family enclosure for home fans and is situated along the north side of the pitch. It was completed in 1966 to replace the previous terrace demolished two years prior. It has the word &quot;BLADES&quot; written in the seats and holds just under 7,000 fans. The stand also contains a row of wheelchair-accessible spaces along the pitch, along with the ground&#x27;s 31 executive boxes, the International Bar and both the Tony Currie and 1889 suites, which provide the majority of Sheffield United&#x27;s hospitality provision on matchdays.

====John Street Corner====

Also called the Northeast Corner and formerly known as the Pukka Pies Stand after its sponsorship deal, this stand was completed in 2001 and is between the Kop and the John Street stand. It is fully linked to the John Street Stand and is also used as a family enclosure holding around 900 fans (after the installation of new restricted-view seats after the 2006–07 campaign. This section of the ground has always been part of the Kop stand structure and the lower half was historically used as a family standing enclosure until it was demolished as part of the main Kop re-development.

====Bramall Lane Corner ====

Also known as the &quot;new&quot; corner infill, this stand is in the south-west corner of the stadium, between the Bramall Lane Stand and the South Stand and was sponsored by Westfield Health. It is linked to the Bramall Lane Stand (upper tier), sharing its facilities, turnstiles and exits. It is always used by home fans, and reputedly has the best views of the ground. The stand holds approximately 2,000 fans. Built just behind the stand is a four-star hotel.

===Blades Enterprise Centre===
The north-west corner is filled in by rentable offices, known as the Blades Enterprise Centre, one of many examples of United diversifying their off-the-field activities to maximise income streams. Completed in 2002, the Enterprise Centre provides office space for smaller and new companies in the block between the John Street and Bramall Lane Stands, and also underneath the John Street Stand itself.

===Hotel===
The stadium has an enviable central location close to the city centre. In order to maximise the earnings potential of the land around the stadium in June 2007 work began to build a 158 bedroomed 4-star Millennium and Copthorne Hotel behind the new Westfield stand. The new hotel opened its doors in November 2008, but subsequently closed in June 2020. Hilton were chosen as the new operator of the hotel in 2021, with a DoubleTree branded hotel opening in August 2024.

==Current and ongoing work==
At the Shareholders&#x27; meeting in November 2007 the club announced that it intended to extend the back of the Kop stand with an additional 3,200 seats and remove the pillars holding up the roof. The revised stand capacity is likely to be about 13,400, slightly less than the Holte End at Villa Park.

The club also planned a major upgrade to the Kop facilities and covering of the concourse areas, in tandem with a plan to build student accommodation at the back of the Kop and a large business centre (office block) between the Kop and South stand.

In the same meeting, the club announced that its long-term ambitions are to add an additional 6,000 seats to the South Stand with the intentions of taking the overall stadium capacity to just over 44,000, however this expansion would depend on demand in the Premier League and any potential 2018 World Cup venue bid. United PLC Former Chairman Kevin McCabe stated that he would build Bramall Lane&#x27;s extensions to any specifications laid down by the FA with a view to the ground hosting matches should England be successful in winning their World Cup bid. However, on 16 December 2009, the FA announced that Hillsborough Stadium (home of rivals Sheffield Wednesday) would be Sheffield&#x27;s venue in the event that a World Cup is awarded to England and Sheffield is named a host city.
Following this announcement Sheffield United&#x27;s Chief Executive, Trevor Birch, made it known that all planned redevelopment work had been put on hold until the club was able to regain and maintain Premier League status. The plans were later revived in 2017, with a planning application for the expansion of the South Stand submitted in 2018. As of 2024, work is yet to begin.

New proposals for the currently open corner between the Kop and South Stand were revealed in 2017, with the plans including the construction of a block of residential flats and a new, larger club shop.

==Attendance==

The record attendance stands at 68,287 for the Sheffield United v. Leeds United FA Cup fifth round tie, played on 15 February 1936.

The record attendance since the 1994 introduction of all spectators being seated is 32,604 at the Sheffield United v. Wigan Athletic game in the Premier League, on 13 May 2007.

In the 2007–2008 season, Sheffield United had the best average attendance in the Championship. The following season Sheffield United had the second-best average attendance in the league of 26,023.

===Average league attendances===
:&quot;This is the average league attendances stretching back to the 2009–10 season for Sheffield United home matches at Bramall Lane. Sheffield United away games and any home cup matches are excluded.&quot;

==Location and transport==
Bramall Lane is located in the district of Highfield, south of Sheffield city centre. Heading south from Junction 4 of the A61 Sheffield Inner Ring Road which surrounds the city centre.

On match days Bramall Lane closes off to most traffic shortly before and after matches, with traffic diverted to Shoreham Street, or towards London Road or onto the A61. This is to ensure the safety of the public, as Bramall Lane is a main road labelled as the A621 and the turnstiles on Bramall Lane are only a few metres away from the road. Also this enables the away fans&#x27; coaches and team coaches to approach/leave the stadium unimpeded (usually with a police escort from/to Park Square roundabout) and avoid a bottleneck scenario.

===Public transport===
Sheffield station (Train and Tram) and Sheffield Interchange (Bus and Coach) are under a mile from the ground.

Sheffield&#x27;s light rail tram network, called the Supertram, runs to the east of the ground. Granville Road/Sheffield College is the nearest tram stop on a tram &quot;from&quot; the city centre (South bound). Park Grange Croft is the nearest tram stop on a tram &quot;towards&quot; the city centre (North bound). Both stops are 0.5 miles from the ground and either stop can be used in both directions.

The ground is also visible from the viaduct which connects the two stops. The Blue route and the Purple route serve these stops. Both routes go to/from the city centre.
There are bus links outside the ground with bus stops on Shoreham Street and Bramall Lane. Other bus stops located near the ground are on Charlotte Road, Queens Road and London Road. All buses from these locations will go to/from the city centre.

===Cycling===
The stadium is located near Route 6 of the National Cycle Network with numerous cycle paths and lanes surrounding the stadium which connect to it. Bramall Lane roundabout has an underpass for easy access to/from the city centre for cycles and pedestrians, with Bramall Lane itself having an on-road cycle lane running its length. Shorham Street is a signed cycle route and St. Mary&#x27;s Gate (A61 ring road) has a traffic free cycle path. There are various secured and unsecured bike parking facilities close to the ground.

<doc id="780021" wikidata="Q1344191" url="?curid=780021" title="Louis Antoine Fauvelet de Bourrienne">
<text>Louis Antoine Fauvelet de Bourrienne (; July 9, 1769 – February 7, 1834) was a French diplomat, born in Sens. He is known primarily for his close relationship with Napoleon Bonaparte, of whom he wrote in detail in his celebrated memoirs.

==Biography==
Bourrienne is famous for his Memoirs of Napoleon Bonaparte, a work based on years of intimate friendship and professional association. They met at the Military Academy at Brienne in Champagne when eight years old. Napoleon recalled the famous snowball battles that he masterminded: “Unfortunately the pleasure did not last long, for we put stones in the snowballs, so that many boys were injured, among them my friend Bourrienne, and the game was forbidden”. Typically, Napoleon recalled that when they graduated in 1787 at age 15 he led in all subjects; Bourrienne recalled that Napoleon led in mathematics, while he was first in all else.

===Friendship renewed===
Bonaparte continued his military studies and entered the army. Bourrienne prepared for a diplomatic career, studying in Vienna and then at Leipzig. Appointed Secretary of the Legation at Stuttgart he remained there during the first years of the French Revolution, flouting orders to return. He did not come home until the spring of 1792, so his name was on the list of emigrants, a potentially dangerous classification. Reunited with Bonaparte in Paris, they enjoyed bachelor life together, and among other incidents of that exciting time were horrified witnessing the rabble mobbing the royal family in the Tuileries (June 20) and the massacre of the Swiss Guards at the same spot (August 10). After that Bourrienne returned to his family home in Sens. Following the affair of 13 Vendémiaire (October 5, 1795) he moved back to Paris and again associated with Bonaparte, who was then second in command of the Army of the Interior and who soon left to command the Army of Italy. The spectacularly victorious general urgently summoned Bourrienne to Italy for the long negotiations with Austria (May–October 1797), where his knowledge of law and diplomacy was useful in drafting the terms of the Treaty of Campo Formio (October 7). Bourrienne recognized that his friend was likely to become a major historical figure, so he began making notes and filing copies of pertinent documents. In November 1797 his name was removed from the list of emigrants.

===Private secretary and disgrace===
The following year he accompanied Bonaparte to Egypt as his private secretary. Later Bourrienne strongly defended the controversial decisions at Jaffa to euthanize the French plague victims and to bayonet the Turkish prisoners who had violated parole. They returned together on the adventurous voyage to Fréjus (September–October 1799), and Bourrienne helped in the parleys that led up to a &quot;coup d&#x27;état&quot;. Then they worked on the Constitution of the Year VIII, which made Bonaparte First Consul for ten years. Almost every day he arrived at 7 AM to work side by side with Bonaparte, often going on to 10 PM. Bourrienne left to become head of the police, but soon was recalled because Bonaparte needed him. He remained in Paris during the second Italian campaign, after which he watched with admiration as his friend continued to organize France so that it would be governed effectively under clearly codified laws by the talented men he brought into the government. As Bonaparte progressed to become Consul for Life Bourrienne recorded—with a mix of admiration and apprehension—his skilled maneuvers to clench power and to enrich his family. In the autumn of 1802 Bonaparte started to ease him out, after a few uncertain weeks firing him without stating a cause. Most likely Bonaparte was revolted by his financial speculations. They never talked together again. Bourrienne was in disgrace.

===The Hanseatic League===
In the spring of 1805 he was appointed French consul to the free city of Hamburg, the leading city of the Hanseatic League. He was supposed to enforce the measures for the commercial war against England, known as the Continental System, but was convinced that cutting off trade hurt Europe more than Britain. His unanswered letters did not persuade the Emperor Napoleon to change his policy. In the early spring of 1807, when directed to provide a large number of military cloaks for the army in East Prussia, he procured them secretly and expeditiously from England. He was recalled to France in 1810 when, to his regret, the Hanseatic towns were incorporated into the Empire. He had made a fortune in Hamburg.

===The restoration and the 100 days===
In 1814 the victorious Allied Armies occupied Paris. Charles Maurice de Talleyrand-Périgord headed a provisional government in which Bourrienne was appointed head of the Post Office, which was also responsible for secretly transcribing suspects&#x27; letters. He participated in the meetings with the Tsar and other Allied leaders that led to the Bourbon restoration. The returning Louis XVIII received him warmly, nevertheless he promptly lost his position. When Napoleon escaped from Elba Bourrienne was appointed Prefect of Police. Napoleon issued an amnesty for all but thirteen individuals; one of them was Bourrienne. He spent the Hundred Days (1815) with Louis XVIII in Ghent. 
After that he did not play a notable part in public affairs. In 1830 he published his book and that revolution cost him his fortune. He died at Caen on February 7, 1834, after spending two years in an asylum.

==The Memoirs==
His book gives a vivid, intimate, detailed account of his interactions with Napoleon and his mother, brothers and sisters; with his first wife Joséphine de Beauharnais and her children; with notable French politicians; and with the marshals, he was especially friendly with Jean Baptiste Jules Bernadotte, the future King of Sweden, when they both were in Northern Germany. His narrative is invigorated by many dialogues, not only of those in which he was a speaker but even of conversations that he only was told about by others. Their exactitude may be suspect but surely they give a memorable portrait of his times. Many judgments are supported by quotes from his stockpile of documents. Naturally his narration is colored by his complicated relationship with his subject: close friendship, working together intimately for years, followed by dismissal and humiliating rejection. He tries to be balanced and gives many examples of Napoleon&#x27;s brilliance, his skill at governance, and his deft political maneuvers, while deploring his inexorable grabs for personal and familial power and wealth, his willingness to sacrifice French lives, and his abhorrence of a free press. Military campaigns are left for professional judges. One of his bombshells is the claim that the Grand Army based at Boulogne was never meant to invade England, too chancy an enterprise: it was a diversion to keep British forces at home.

Of course the book infuriated devoted Bonapartists; two volumes of criticisms were published promptly to attack his credibility. Controversy was still raging half a century later.

His book is not a source in which to check particular facts, but as Goethe wrote: &quot;All of the nimbus, all of the illusions, with which journalists and historians have surrounded Napoleon, vanishes before the awe-inspiring realisms of this book…&quot;.

<text>TTCN is a programming language used for testing of communication protocols and web services. A TTCN test suite consists of many test cases written in the TTCN programming language.
Until version 2 the language was written in tables and called Tree and Tabular Combined Notation. Reading and editing this language required special TTCN editors. Beginning with version 3 TTCN was renamed to Testing and Test Control Notation. It is now closer to current programming languages and can be edited with traditional editors. TTCN-3 is more flexible than TTCN-2 in that it can be used for protocol testing as well as testing traditional software. 

All versions of TTCN need dedicated compilers or interpreters for execution.

TTCN is widely used, for example; ETSI, ITU for the testing of telecommunication protocols. Conformance test cases of ETSI standards like ISDN, DECT, GSM, EDGE, 3G, DSRC have also been written in TTCN. Recently it has also been used for testing various protocol standards e.g. Bluetooth, IP. 

Execution of those test cases against products (e.g. phones, mobile phones, service enablers or network elements) is used to verify that the protocol implementation in those products meet the requirements defined by telecommunication standards.

TTCN is often combined with ASN.1.

==Versions==

*TTCN-1: Standardized in 1992 by ISO and CCITT as ISO/IEC 9646-3 and CCITT X.292 for Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) conformance testing methodology and framework.
*TTCN-2: Standardized in 1998 by ISO and ITU, adding concurrency and multiple modules support to TTCN-1.
*TTCN-3: Written by ETSI and standardized in 2000 by ITU under reference Z.140. It aimed at being a more generic testing language than TTCN-2. In 2007 the recommendation moved from Z.140 to Z.160.

==Background information==

Conformance testing means a test execution against a well-defined test case, e.g. a test written in TTCN. Plug-tests, also called interoperability testing, are test cases executed with a client - server model; e.g. Mail-Client against Mail-server, phone against network, Bluetooth headset against Bluetooth phone. Plug-tests are e.g. often executed at so-called unplug-tests.

Conformance-tests and plug-tests complement each other. If properly done, interoperability errors found with plug-tests should lead to definition of new conformance test cases that cover the failed test.

<text>Lexicon Technicum: or, Universal English Dictionary of Arts and Sciences: Explaining not only the Terms of Art, but the Arts Themselves was in many respects the first alphabetical encyclopedia written in English, compiled by John Harris, with the first volume published in 1704 and the second in 1710. Although the emphasis of the &quot;Lexicon Technicum&quot; was on mathematical subjects, its contents go beyond what would be called science or technology today, in conformity with the broad eighteenth century understanding of the terms &quot;arts&quot; and &quot;science,&quot; and it includes entries on the humanities and fine arts, notably on law, commerce, music, and heraldry. However, the &quot;Lexicon Technicum&quot; neglects theology, antiquity, biography, and poetry. 

== Overview ==
The &quot;Lexicon Technicum&quot; was the work of a London clergyman, John Harris (1666-1719). Its professed advantage over French dictionaries of the arts and sciences was that it contained explanation not only of the terms used in the arts and sciences, but also of the arts and sciences themselves. Harris issued a three-page proposal for this work in 1702, and the first edition of the first volume was published in London in 1704. The first volume contains 1220 pages, 4 plates, and many additional diagrams and figures within the text. Like many early English encyclopedias, the pages are not numbered; numbering may have been thought unnecessary as readers could search by its alphabetical arrangement.

Volume 2, which was also alphabetized from A through Z, was first published in 1710. The second volume contains 1419 pages and 4 plates, with a list of about 1300 subscribers. A previously unpublished treatise on acids by Sir Isaac Newton was included in its original Latin along with Harris&#x27;s English translation, perhaps without the latter&#x27;s permission or encouragement. A large part of the volume consists of mathematical and astronomical tables, since Harris intended his work to serve as a small mathematical library. He provided tables of logarithms, sines, tangents, and secants, a two-page list of books, and an index of the articles in both volumes under 26 heads, filling 50 pages. The longest lists are for law (1700 articles), surgery, anatomy, geometry, fortification, botany, and music.

In his preface, Harris stated that he got less help from previous dictionaries than one would expect. While acknowledging some borrowing, Harris insisted that &quot;much the greater part of what [the reader] will find here is collected from no Dictionaries, but from the best Original Authors I could procure.&quot; Harris&#x27;s preface touted his coverage of mathematical subjects. He admitted the imperfection of his data on stars, noting that Flamsteed had refused to assist him, but he vaunted his coverage of astronomy, especially his full coverage of Newton&#x27;s theories of the moon and of comets. In botany he claimed to have given &quot;a pretty exact botanick lexicon, which was what we really wanted before,&quot; using Dr John Ray&#x27;s method. To describe the parts of a ship accurately, he supposedly &quot;often&quot; went on board himself. In law, he wrote, he abridged from the best writers and had the result &quot;carefully examined and corrected by a Gentleman of known Ability in that Profession.&quot;

The specified aims of the book did not prevent Harris from including some highly opinionated asides, for example this definition conveying the poor view he took of lawyers: &quot;Sollicitor, is a Man imploy&#x27;d to take care of, and follow Suits depending in Courts of Law, or Equity, formerly allowed only to Nobility, whose Menial Servants they were; but now too frequently used by others, to the damage of the People, and the increase of Champerty and Maintenance&quot;.

Harris wrote that he had wished to supply an index for each art and science as well as more plates on anatomy and ships, but the underwriters could not afford it, &quot;the Book having swelled so very much beyond the Expectation.&quot;

A review of this work, extending to the unusual length of four pages, appeared in the &quot;Philosophical Transactions&quot; for 1704.

The &quot;Lexicon Technicum&quot; was long very popular, enduring through at least 1744 as the main rival of Ephraim Chambers&#x27;s &quot;Cyclopaedia&quot;. The final publication of the two volumes of the &quot;Lexicum Technicum&quot; was in 1736. An anonymous one-volume supplement did appear in 1744, with 996 pages and 6 plates, but this work was allegedly &quot;not well received,&quot; being perceived by contemporaries as a mere &quot;booksellers speculation.&quot; In any case, no new editions of the &quot;Lexicon Technicum&quot; were published thereafter.

==Publication History==
Unlike most multi-volume works, the several editions of volumes 1 and 2 were not synchronized until 1736. The first volume appeared in five editions, while the second volume appeared only in three editions. The first edition of volume 1 appeared in 1704; the second edition in 1708, the third edition in 1716, and the fourth edition in 1725. In contrast, the first edition of volume 2 appeared in 1710, and the second edition did not appear until 1723. The two volumes were not published together until 1736, constituting the fifth edition of the first volume and the third edition of the second volume. The supplement of 1744 was billed as volume 3.

We do not know the names of the editors who carried on Harris&#x27;s work after his death in 1719.

<text>Euroa is a town in the Shire of Strathbogie in the north-east of Victoria, Australia. At the 2021 census, Euroa&#x27;s population was 3,116.

The name Euroa comes from an Aboriginal word in the old local dialect meaning &#x27;joyful&#x27;.

==History==

Major T.L. Mitchell camped on the banks of the Seven Creeks at Euroa during his 1836 &quot;Australia Felix&quot; expedition. 
The Post Office opened on 1 January 1854 in the old town, as the township was settled.

Euroa&#x27;s claim to fame is that the National Bank was robbed by Ned Kelly in 1878. Much of the region&#x27;s wealth once came from sheep but now it comes from horse studs.

The Euroa Magistrates&#x27; Court closed on 1 January 1990.

===Heritage sites===

Euroa contains a number of heritage-listed sites, including:
* 1 Binney Street: National Bank of Australasia Building
* 90 Binney Street: Euroa Post Office
* 99 Binney Street: Euroa Court House

== Geography ==
Euroa is roughly midway between Melbourne and Albury. The area is geographically very flat, as the town is located in the huge Goulburn Valley, however the Strathbogie Ranges are not far away. 
=== Climate ===
Euroa possesses a humid subtropical climate bordering on an oceanic climate (Köppen: Cfa/Cfb), with very warm, relatively dry summers and cool, wetter winters. Average maxima vary from in February to in July while average minima fluctuate between in January and in July. Mean precipitation is moderately low (averaging per annum). Euroa receives 100.6 precipitation days annually, with a maximum frequency of rain in winter. Extreme temperatures have ranged from on 31 January 1968 to on 6 August 1974.

== Facilities ==
The town is home to the Shire of Strathbogie headquarters. The shire was established as part of the conservative Kennett government mass rationalisation across Victoria in the 1990s. Shire of Strathbogie incorporates the former Shires of Euroa, Violet Town, and Goulburn.

The town was bypassed by a deviation of the Hume Highway that was constructed around 1992.

The town is located on the main North East railway, and is served by V/Line passenger services from Euroa station.

== Schools ==

=== St John&#x27;s Primary School ===
St John&#x27;s is Euroa&#x27;s only Catholic primary school and has served the Euroa community since 1921. The school has an approximate enrolment of 180 students and, from its founding until 2002, the school was run by the Sisters of Mercy.

The current principal is Libby Hamilton.

=== Euroa Primary School ===
Euroa Primary School (School Number: 1706) is the town&#x27;s only government-run primary school. Euroa Primary School No:1706 is located in picturesque central Victoria, Australia, and has an enrolment of 120 students. There is a mixture of historical, refurbished, and modern open plan buildings, with extensive playgrounds and an oval.

=== Euroa Secondary College ===

Euroa Secondary College (School Number: 7820) is the only secondary school in the Shire of Strathbogie and, in 2007, had an enrolment of 371 students. These students come from the surrounding area including Nagambie, Avenel, Longwood, Ruffy and Violet Town. The current principal is Ms Leanne Whinfield

==Sport==
The town has an Australian rules football team, the &quot;Euroa Magpies&quot;, competing in the Goulburn Valley Football League.

In June 1952, during the 1952 VFL season, a senior Victorian Football League (VFL) game was played at Euroa Oval. The match was organised as part of an effort by the Australian National Football Council (ANFC) to promote the sport, and the other matches in the round were played in Albury, Brisbane, Hobart, Sydney, and Yallourn (all non-standard venues). The match in Euroa drew a crowd estimated at 7,500 people.

Golfers play at the course of the Euroa Golf Club on Walters Road.

<doc id="780028" wikidata="Q5210837" url="?curid=780028" title="Dalgaranga crater">
<text>Dalgaranga crater is a small meteorite impact crater located on Dalgaranga pastoral station northwest of Mount Magnet (or north of Yalgoo) in Western Australia. It is only in diameter and deep, making it Australia&#x27;s smallest impact crater (with exception of the smallest members of the Henbury crater field). Though discovered in 1921, it was not reported in the scientific literature until 1938. The bedrock at the site is weathered Archaean granite of the Yilgarn Craton. The discovery of fragments of mesosiderite stony-iron meteorite around the crater confirms an impact origin, making this crater unique as the only one known to have been produced by a mesosiderite projectile.

== Description ==
Asymmetries in the crater structure and the ejecta blanket imply that the projectile impacted at low angle from the south-southeast. The age is not accurately constrained but must be young because it is so well preserved for its small size, and the meteorite fragments have not weathered away; some authors suggest an age of as young as 3000 years.

== Discovery ==
The crater was discovered by an Aboriginal stockman named Billy Seward in 1921. The meteorites were found shortly after by Gerard Wellard, the station manager, when Seward took him to the site. It was not until 1923 that meteorite fragments were sent to the Western Australian Museum.

<text>The Decaturville crater, also referred to as the Decaturville Dome, is an impact crater near the town of Decaturville, Missouri, United States. It is one of the 38th parallel structures, a series of circular geophysical features stretching across the central United States which have been hypothesized to be the remnants of an ancient serial impact event.

The Decaturville crater is in diameter and is estimated to be less than 300 million years old (dating to the Permian or younger). The crater is exposed at the surface. The effect that the impact had on the surrounding bedrock can be seen in a roadcut that runs along Highway 5 about 16 miles north of Lebanon.

The crater was first described and mapped in detail by T. W. Offield and H. A. Pohn under NASA funding in the 1970s. Their work was reported in a 1979 U.S. Geological Survey Professional Paper that provides the most detailed description to date.

<doc id="780034" wikidata="Q940434" url="?curid=780034" title="Lyssavirus">
<text>Lyssavirus (from the Greek &quot;lyssa&quot; &quot;rage, fury, rabies&quot; and the Latin &quot;vīrus&quot;) is a genus of RNA viruses in the family &quot;Rhabdoviridae&quot;, order &quot;Mononegavirales&quot;. Mammals, including humans, can serve as natural hosts. The genus &quot;Lyssavirus&quot; includes the causative agent (rabies virus) of rabies.

==Taxonomy==

==Virology==
=== Structure ===
Lyssavirions are enveloped, with bullet shaped geometries. These virions are about 75 nm wide and 180 nm long. Lyssavirions have helical symmetry, so their infectious particles are approximately cylindrical in shape. This is typical of plant-infecting viruses. Virions of human-infecting viruses more commonly have cubic symmetry and take shapes approximating regular polyhedra.

The structure consists of a spiked outer envelope, a middle region consisting of matrix protein M, and an inner ribonucleocapsid complex region, consisting of the genome associated with other proteins.

===Genome===
Lyssavirus genomes consist of a negative-sense, single-stranded RNA molecule that encodes five viral proteins: polymerase L, matrix protein M, phosphoprotein P, nucleoprotein N, and glycoprotein G. Genomes are linear, around 11kb in length.

Based on recent phylogenetic evidence, lyssaviruses have been categorized into seven major species. In addition, five more species have recently been discovered: West Caucasian bat virus, Aravan virus, Khujand virus, Irkut virus and Shimoni bat virus. The lyssavirus genus can be divided into four phylogroups based upon DNA sequence homology. Phylogroup I includes viruses, such as Rabies virus, Duvenhage virus, European bat lyssavirus types 1 and 2, Australian bat lyssavirus, Khujand virus, Bokeloh bat lyssavirus, Irkut virus, and Aravan virus. Phylogroup II contains Lagos bat virus, Mokola virus, and Shimoni bat virus. West Caucasian bat lyssavirus is the only virus that is a part of phylogroup III. Ikoma lyssavirus and Lleida bat lyssavirus are examples in phylogroup IV. West Caucasian bat lyssavirus was classified within its own phylogroup because it is the most divergent lyssavirus that has been discovered.

===Evolution===
Phylogenetic studies suggest that the original hosts of these viruses were bats. However, the recent discovery of lyssavirus sequences from amphibians and reptiles challenges the mammalian origin of lyssaviruses. The greater antigenic diversity of lyssaviruses from Africa has led to the assumption that Africa was the origin of these viruses. An examination of 153 viruses collected between 1956 and 2015 from various geographic locations has instead suggested a Palearctic origin (85% likelihood) for these viruses. Date estimates (95% likelihood) for the most recent common ancestor were very broad – between 3,995 and 166,820 years before present – which suggests there is further work to be done in this area. Although bats evolved in the Palearctic, their origins antedate that of the lyssaviruses by millions of years, which argues against their co-speciation. The evolution rate in the N gene in the Africa 2 lineage has been estimated to be 3.75×10−3 substitutions per site per year. This rate is similar to that of other RNA viruses.

==Life cycle==
Viral replication is cytoplasmic. Entry into the host cell is achieved by attachment of the viral G glycoproteins to host receptors, which mediates clathrin-mediated endocytosis. Replication follows the negative stranded RNA virus replication model. Negative stranded RNA virus transcription, using polymerase stuttering, is the method of transcription. The virus exits the host cell by budding and by tubule-guided viral movement.
Wild mammals, especially bats and certain carnivores, serve as natural hosts. Transmission routes are typically via bite wounds.

==Testing==
As of 2018 the direct fluorescent antibody (DFA) test is still the gold standard to detect lyssavirus infection. Since the new millennium reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR) tests have been developed for rabies but only been used as a confirmatory test. Real-time PCR-based tests which have higher sensitivity and objective diagnostic thresholds and allow samples to be stored at room temperature have been promising since 2005, but require a real-time PCR machine and skilled workers with experience in molecular diagnostics. In an international evaluation a single TaqMan LN34 assay could detect Lyssavirus with high sensitivity (99.90%) across the genus and high specificity (99.68%) when compared to the DFA test. It will become the primary post-mortem rabies diagnostic test where possible.

==Epidemiology==
Classic rabies virus is prevalent throughout most of the world and can be carried by any warm blooded mammal. The other lyssaviruses have much less diversity in carriers. Only select hosts can carry each of these viral species. Also, these other species are particular only to a specific geographic area. Bats are known to be an animal vector for all identified lyssaviruses except the &quot;Mokola virus&quot;.

<text>Deep Bay is a bay near the south-western tip of Reindeer Lake in Saskatchewan, Canada. The bay is strikingly circular and very deep (220 m) in an otherwise irregular and shallow lake. It is the deepest body of water in Saskatchewan.

The bay was formed in a 13 km wide impact crater. The age of the crater is estimated to be 99 ± 4 million years (Cretaceous).

The smaller Gow crater, of Triassic age, is approximately 90 km west of Deep Bay crater. The Carswell impact structure, also of Cretaceous age, is to the northwest of Deep Bay and Gow.

<text>Fantastyka (est 1982, in 1990 renamed Nowa Fantastyka) is a Polish speculative fiction monthly fantasy and science fiction magazine. It is the leading and oldest of the Polish magazines on this topic.

==History==
&quot;Fantastyka&quot; was established in 1982 by sci-fi fans Andrzej Krzepkowski, Jacek Rodek and , under the direction of the writer and journalist Adam Hollanek, who became the magazine&#x27;s first editor-in-chief. It became known as one of few magazines to publish both foreign and Polish short stories, as well as full-length novels in instalments. Between 1990 and 1992 its editor-in-chief was Lech Jęczmyk, followed by Maciej Parowski and Arkadiusz Nakoniecznik. In March 2006 Paweł Matuszek took over.

Andrzej Sapkowski published his first short story about &quot;The Witcher&quot; in the magazine - a debut that led to the publishing success of The Witcher saga.

Today &quot;Fantastyka&quot; is dedicated predominantly to short stories, but also to articles on modern science, film and book reviews and comic pages. In addition, it brings fandom and convention news.

Apart from &quot;Nowa Fantastyka&quot;, there have been several periodical variations of the title:
* &quot;Mała Fantastyka&quot; (1987–1989) - an sf/fantasy quarterly for children
* &quot;Komiks-Fantastyka&quot; (1980s-1991) - comic books, in 1991 changed the name to Komiks
* &quot;Nowa Fantastyka - Wydanie specjalne&quot; (since 2003) - a quarterly with longer stories and novels
* &quot;Czas Fantastyki&quot; - (2004-2015) - a bimonthly with literary criticism, essays and prose

&quot;Fantastyka&quot; featured stories by Philip K. Dick, J. R. R. Tolkien, Anthony Burgess, Orson Scott Card, Kir Bulychov, and many other acclaimed writers. It was there that most of modern Polish sf/fantasy writers made their debut. Among them are Jacek Dukaj, Andrzej Sapkowski, Rafał A. Ziemkiewicz and Konrad T. Lewandowski. Finally, on the middle pages that used to be devoted to art, &quot;Fantastyka&quot; featured many renowned artists, including Enki Bilal, Wojciech Siudmak, Zdzisław Beksiński, Jacek Yerka and Jerzy Skarżyński. The comic series Lil &amp; Put (by Maciej Kur and Piotr Bednarczyk) are currently published in the magazine, with satirical take on fantasy adventures.

<text>Unterwasser () is a village in the Toggenburg region of the canton of St. Gallen, Switzerland, situated at the confluence of the two streams forming the upper Thur (known as &quot;Säntisthur&quot; and &quot;Wildhausthur&quot;). Formerly part of Wildhaus municipality, it has since 2010 been part of Wildhaus-Alt St. Johann by merger of Wildhaus and Alt St. Johann.
It is a relatively small ski resort, and many of its trails are shared with nearby Alt st. Johan.

Iltiosbahn, a funicular leads to Iltios and the aerial cableway to Chäserrugg.

The toponym was first recorded in the 15th century as &quot;under dem Wasser &quot;, or &quot;below the water&quot;.
Its population was 685 as of 2010 (down from 751 in 1990; historical population: 81 in 1827).
The village was owned by the counts of Montfort in the earlier Middle Ages, later by St. Johann Abbey, and after 1555 by St. Gall Abbey.

Ski jumper Simon Ammann — winner of four gold medals in the 2002 and 2010 Winter Olympics, and World Champion 2007 — comes from Unterwasser.

<doc id="780053" wikidata="Q7427199" url="?curid=780053" title="Saugatuck River">
<text>The Saugatuck River is a river in southwestern Connecticut in the United States. It drains part of suburban and rural Fairfield County west of Bridgeport, emptying into Long Island Sound.

The Aspetuck River is a major tributary of the Saugatuck River.

== Description ==
The Saugatuck River issues from Sugar Hollow Pond, its headwaters located at exactly 41°20&#x27;50.4&quot;N 73°28&#x27;06.4&quot;W approximately southwest of downtown Danbury. It flows generally southeast, passing through the Saugatuck Reservoir ( above sea level), then turns south-southwest. In Westport, it broadens into a navigable estuary along its lower and enters Long Island Sound approximately southeast of Norwalk. Interstate 95 crosses the river near its mouth downstream from Westport center. The river is wadeable along much of its course and is a popular seasonal destination for trout fishing, with the state of Connecticut stocking the river annually.

In the 17th century the river was the site of a Paugusset settlement. The name of the river means &quot;river that flows out&quot; in the Paugusset language. The land east of the river was opened to white settlement in 1637 after the defeat of the Pequots by John Mason in the Pequot War. After treaties with the local tribes, members of the Connecticut Colony began to settle the area between the Saugatuck and the Norwalk rivers to the west between 1639 and 1661. In the 18th century farming villages sprang up along the river, which was the principal means of transportation. During the 19th century, the lower river became the site of warehouses and shipyards, as well as an important hub of maritime commerce. The town of Westport was incorporated out of the existing village of Saugatuck at the mouth of the Saugatuck River and several surrounding communities in 1835.

In 1908, the author Samuel Clemens moved into a villa he named &quot;Stormfield&quot; built on a hill overlooking the Saugatuck River in Redding, Connecticut. Clemens died in 1910, and the original Stormfield was destroyed in a 1923 fire.

Bridgeport Hydraulic Company Holdings (now owned by Aquarion) flooded portions of the Saugatuck River Valley in Weston, Redding, and Easton after 1938, displacing the villages of Hull and Valley Forge to create the Saugatuck Reservoir.

== Crossings ==
In Westport, Route 136 crosses the river on the Saugatuck River Bridge, built in 1882, the oldest surviving moveable bridge in Connecticut. The moveable section consists of a hand-cranked swing span made of two pin-connected Pratt trusses. The bridge replaced a wooden truss structure erected in 1873. Before that, a ferry service, started in 1746, helped passengers cross the river.

The crossings of the Saugatuck River are (from mouth to source):
*In Westport:
**Saugatuck River Railroad Bridge (Metro-North railroad)
**Bridge carrying Interstate 95
**Saugatuck River Bridge (Route 136)
**Ruth Steinkraus Cohen Bridge (U.S. Route 1) vertical-lift bridge
**Bridge carrying King&#x27;s Highway (Route 57) bascule bridge
**Bridge carrying the Merritt Parkway
**Burrs Bridge (Weston Road/Route 57)
*In Weston:
**River Road
**Cartbridge Road
**Davis Hill Road
**Valley Forge Road
*In Redding:
**Newtown Turnpike (Route 53)
**Glen Road (Route 53)
**Redding Road (Routes 53 and 107)
**Diamond Hill Road
**Redding Road (Route 53 – twice)
**Station Road
**Simpaug Turnpike
**George Hull Hill Road
*In Danbury:
**East Starrs Plain Road
**Hemlock Hill Road
**Starrs Plain Road (twice)

== Culture ==
, a U.S. Navy oiler that saw service in World War II, was named after the river.

The 1972 REO Speedwagon song &quot;157 Riverside Avenue&quot; mentions the river in its lyrics.

&quot;Secrets of Redding Glen&quot;, a 1973 children&#x27;s book written and illustrated by Jo Polseno, chronicles the natural cycle of wildlife along a section of the Saugatuck River.
