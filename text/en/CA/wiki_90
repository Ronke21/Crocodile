<text>The Houston Press is an online newspaper published in Houston, Texas, United States. It is headquartered in the Midtown area. It was also a weekly print newspaper until November 2017.

The publication is supported entirely by advertising revenue and is free to readers. It reports a monthly readership of 1.6 million online users. Prior to the 2017 cessation of the print edition, the &quot;Press&quot; was found in restaurants, coffee houses, and local retail stores. New weekly editions were distributed on Thursdays.

==History==
The alt-weekly &quot;Houston Press&quot; was founded in 1989 by John Wilburn, Chris Hearne (founder of Austin&#x27;s &quot;Third Coast Magazine&quot;) and Kirk Cypel (a vice president of a Houston-based investment group) conceived of this news and entertainment weekly after rejecting a business plan to relaunch &quot;Texas Business Magazine&quot;.

Hearne and John Wilburn, who previously managed the Sunday magazine of the &quot;Dallas Morning News&quot;, jointly established the magazine. Hearne was the paper&#x27;s first publisher and Cypel served as the organization&#x27;s business advisor. Although the paper faced early challenges, the landscape changed when Hearne and Cypel engineered a buyout of &quot;713 Magazine&quot;, a key competitor. Once in control of 713, they stopped its publication and converted advertisers to the &quot;Houston Press&quot;. Thereafter, the &quot;Houston Press&quot;″s advertising and circulation grew dramatically. Prior to the establishment of the &quot;Houston Press&quot;, the city did not have a major alternative weekly publication. Its original cover story was about the election of the Mayor of Houston.

For the newspaper&#x27;s first five years, Niel Morgan served as the investor, and therefore the owner; Morgan was a real estate developer. Due to Wilburn&#x27;s desire to get mainstream advertising, he chose not to run sexually-oriented advertising. After Wilburn and Morgan found themselves disagreeing over aspects of the paper, Wilburn quit. In the period before 1993 the &quot;Houston Press&quot; experienced financial difficulties. That year, Morgan sold the paper to New Times Media.

Sexually-oriented advertising appeared after the sale. The paper&#x27;s fortunes improved due to the dot-com bubble of 1997–2001 and the increase in advertising; it was one of the first alternative weeklies in the United States to establish a website. In 1998 &quot;Houston Press&quot; acquired the assets of an alternative paper, &quot;Public News&quot;, that was ceasing operations. Employees of &quot;Public News&quot;&#x27; sales department began working for the &quot;Houston Press&quot;. That year Margaret Downing became the primary editor. There were 23 reporters and editors in 1998. Michael Hardy stated in the &quot;Texas Observer&quot; that the &quot;heyday&quot; of the paper was around 2004.

Advertising-related income declined due to the rise of persons reading articles online, as well as the establishment of Craigslist. In 2005, New Times acquired Village Voice Media, and changed its name to Village Voice Media. In September 2012, Village Voice Media executives Scott Tobias, Christine Brennan and Jeff Mars bought Village Voice Media&#x27;s papers and associated web properties from its founders and formed Voice Media Group. The paper&#x27;s fortunes declined, as Backpage, which separated from Village Voice Media, had contributed significant funding.

On November 3, 2017, Voice Media Group announced that it would cease printing of the &quot;Press&quot;, moving to online-only publication, and that the paper would only use freelance journalists. Voice Media Group cited Hurricane Harvey as the final factor behind the cessation, and Downing stated that a recession in the oil industry and the decline of revenue from advertising contributed to the decision. The majority of the &quot;Press&quot; employees, including nine full-time editorial staff members and at least six employees on the advertising staff, lost their jobs. Downing and publisher Stuart Folb continued, along with a small advertising staff and marketing manager. The online-only scenario was a compromise reached by Downing and Folb with the owners, who initially wished to completely shut the paper down.

In 2021, Voice Media Group sold the &quot;Houston Press&quot; to an anonymous buyer.

==Content==
Hardy stated that the &quot;Houston Press&quot;, known for its coverage of the culture of Houston, was like a &quot;court jester&quot; compared to the &quot;Houston Chronicle&quot; being the &quot;king&quot; of Houston&#x27;s journalism industry; he added &quot;Its music and arts listings were more comprehensive and reliable than those of the &quot;Chronicle&quot;, which often seemed painfully out of touch, and it had the best critics in the city.&quot; He added that &quot;The &quot;Press&quot; established a reputation for punching above its weight&quot; in regards to investigative journalism, citing how an article led to the exoneration of Roy Criner.

The publication included John Nova Lomax&#x27;s articles on the cityscape and music as well as Robb Walsh&#x27;s articles on the cuisine of Houston.

==Headquarters==
The headquarters of the &quot;Houston Press&quot; are located in Midtown Houston on McGowen Street.

Prior to 1998, the &quot;Houston Press&quot; was located in Suite 1900 of the 2000 West Loop South building in Uptown Houston, off of the 610 Loop West Loop. In 1998, it moved to a new location in Downtown Houston, which became the &quot;Houston Press&quot; building and was originally built in 1927. That building is in close proximity to the ExxonMobil Building.

Shelor Motor Company was the building&#x27;s first occupant and used it as an automobile showroom. Beginning in the 1960s, the facility served as the Gillman Pontiac dealership building. In 1994 Suzanne Sellers painted a by trompe-l&#x27;œil mural around two of the building&#x27;s sides. It is visible from Leeland, Milam, and Travis streets. In 2008 the &quot;Houston Press&quot; building received damage from Hurricane Ike since the hurricane caused water to go through the parking area on the building&#x27;s roof into the offices. In 2010 the &quot;Houston Press&quot; installed new energy efficient windows in place of the original glass windows on the facility&#x27;s second and third floors. On the weekend after Friday October 25, 2013 the &quot;Houston Press&quot; was scheduled to move to its new offices in Midtown, then on 2603 LaBranch Street.

<text>Zabbix is an open-source software tool to monitor IT infrastructure such as networks, servers, virtual machines, and cloud services. Zabbix collects and displays basic metrics.

==Description==
Zabbix is designed primarily as an IT infrastructure monitoring tool. New features are generally released every six months to major versions and every 1.5 years to LTS versions.

Released under the terms of GNU Affero General Public License version 3 (before 7.0.0, under the terms of the GNU General Public License version 2), Zabbix is free software that does not require an additional license to use any of its features. Even though Zabbix is open-source software, it is a closed development software product, developed by Zabbix LLC based in Riga, Latvia.

Early in its history, Zabbix was described as simple to set up compared to other monitoring solutions. However, later it was considered by some to need a significant amount of manual configuration. As an open-source product however Zabbix focuses on the usage of existing tools and functionality as well as proprietary solutions to achieve a scalable monitoring solution.

==Development==

The first stable version, 1.0, was released in 2004. Since the first stable version was released as 1.0, Zabbix versioning has used minor version numbers to denote major releases. Each minor release implements many new features, while change level releases mostly introduce bugfixes.

Zabbix version numbering scheme has changed over time. While the first two stable branches were 1.0 and 1.1, after 1.1 it was decided to use odd numbers for development versions and even numbers for stable versions. As a result, 1.3 followed 1.1 as a development update to be released as 1.4.

==Zabbix Cloud==
Zabbix Cloud is a solution designed to provide the standard Zabbix features with additional flexibility. Released in October 2024, Zabbix Cloud nodes use the same data collection, processing, and analysis methods as an on-premise Zabbix instance.

<text>The Athletic Model Guild, or AMG, was a physique photography studio founded by Bob Mizer in December 1945. During those post-war years, United States censorship laws allowed women, but not men, to appear in various states of undress in what were referred to as &quot;art photographs&quot;. Mizer began his business by taking pictures of men that he knew. His subjects would often pose for pictures which illustrated fitness tips and the like, but were also viewed as homoerotic material.

==History==

Mizer established the Guild in December 1945 after spending the earlier part of the year taking photographs at Venice Beach and the offices were based around his life-long home. The formula used by AMG consisted of images (moving and still) of hunky young men doing bodybuilding poses, or perhaps wrestling in pairs or acting out improvised scenes. Mizer did appear in court to face several charges over the years, including obscenity, drug use, and prostitution. Allegedly, Mizer&#x27;s AMG models would sometimes earn extra money renting themselves out as gay for pay hustlers, but Mizer argued vigorously that it was not his business what they did on their own time. Despite some legal setbacks, AMG survived its many trials.

The AMG material (sold in the form of photographic prints, magazines, and short films) slowly evolved over time, from altered images where the male genitalia were painted over or otherwise covered, to photographic prints where the models wore extremely skimpy posing straps, and then finally, as the changing laws allowed, to full nudity. He used his quarterly magazine, &quot;Physique Pictorial&quot; which featured other artists such as Tom of Finland and MATT, as means of advertising his material. Several bodybuilders and actors of the day got their start posing for Mizer and his friends at AMG. It is estimated that he shot over 10,000 men throughout the course of his career. Andy Warhol&#x27;s protégé Joe Dallesandro was one of the many AMG models that even those not acquainted with Athletic Model Guild might be familiar with. Others included Ed Fury and Glenn Corbett of &quot;77 Sunset Strip&quot;, and Susan Hayward and Alan Ladd. Bodybuilder and future Governor of California, Arnold Schwarzenegger posed for AMG under Mizer in 1975.

Editorials in &quot;Physique Pictorial&quot; claimed that AMG had 35,000 photographs in its library by 1957. Two years later, the figure had risen to 50,000.

After Mizer&#x27;s death in May 1992, Wayne Stanley, a friend and legal advisor, tended to his archives. In 2004 the company and its archives were sold to physique photographer Dennis Bell. Under Bell&#x27;s reins, Athletic Model Guild continues to operate as Bob Mizer Foundation. The 1998 movie &quot;Beefcake&quot;, directed by Thom Fitzgerald, combines documentary footage with fictionalized dramatizations in an attempt to tell the story of Mizer and AMG. 

In 2016, Taschen published a book featuring one thousand of the Guild&#x27;s models, a reprint of a 1957 publication of the same name.

<doc id="788661" wikidata="Q961652" url="?curid=788661" title="Case–control study">
<text>A case–control study (also known as case–referent study) is a type of observational study in which two existing groups differing in outcome are identified and compared on the basis of some supposed causal attribute. Case–control studies are often used to identify factors that may contribute to a medical condition by comparing subjects who have the condition with patients who do not have the condition but are otherwise similar. They require fewer resources but provide less evidence for causal inference than a randomized controlled trial. A case–control study is often used to produce an odds ratio. Some statistical methods make it possible to use a case–control study to also estimate relative risk, risk differences, and other quantities.

==Definition==
Porta&#x27;s &quot;Dictionary of Epidemiology&quot; defines the case–control study as: &quot;an observational epidemiological study of persons with the disease (or another outcome variable) of interest and a suitable control group of persons without the disease (comparison group, reference group). The potential relationship of a suspected risk factor or an attribute to the disease is examined by comparing the diseased and nondiseased subjects with regard to how frequently the factor or attribute is present (or, if quantitative, the levels of the attribute) in each of the groups (diseased and nondiseased).&quot;

The case–control study is frequently contrasted with cohort studies, wherein exposed and unexposed subjects are observed until they develop an outcome of interest.

===Control group selection===
Controls need not be in good health; inclusion of sick people is sometimes appropriate, as the control group should represent those at risk of becoming a case. Controls should come from the same population as the cases, and their selection should be independent of the exposures of interest.

Controls can carry the same disease as the experimental group, but of another grade/severity, therefore being different from the outcome of interest. However, because the difference between the cases and the controls will be smaller, this results in a lower power to detect an exposure effect.

As with any epidemiological study, greater numbers in the study will increase the power of the study. Numbers of cases and controls do not have to be equal. In many situations, it is much easier to recruit controls than to find cases. Increasing the number of controls above the number of cases, up to a ratio of about 4 to 1, may be a cost-effective way to improve the study.

===Prospective vs. retrospective cohort studies===
A prospective study watches for outcomes, such as the development of a disease, during the study period and relates this to other factors such as suspected risk or protection factor(s). The study usually involves taking a cohort of subjects and watching them over a long period. The outcome of interest should be common; otherwise, the number of outcomes observed will be too small to be statistically meaningful (indistinguishable from those that may have arisen by chance). All efforts should be made to avoid sources of bias such as the loss of individuals to follow up during the study. Prospective studies usually have fewer potential sources of bias and confounding than retrospective studies.

A retrospective study, on the other hand, looks backwards and examines exposures to suspected risk or protection factors in relation to an outcome that is established at the start of the study. Many valuable case–control studies, such as Lane and Claypon&#x27;s 1926 investigation of risk factors for breast cancer, were retrospective investigations. Most sources of error due to confounding and bias are more common in retrospective studies than in prospective studies. For this reason, retrospective investigations are often criticised. If the outcome of interest is uncommon, however, the size of prospective investigation required to estimate relative risk is often too large to be feasible. In retrospective studies the odds ratio provides an estimate of relative risk. One should take special care to avoid sources of bias and confounding in retrospective studies.

==Strengths and weaknesses==
Case–control studies are a relatively inexpensive and frequently used type of epidemiological study that can be carried out by small teams or individual researchers in single facilities in a way that more structured experimental studies often cannot be. They have pointed the way to a number of important discoveries and advances. The case–control study design is often used in the study of rare diseases or as a preliminary study where little is known about the association between the risk factor and disease of interest.

Compared to prospective cohort studies they tend to be less costly and shorter in duration. In several situations, they have greater statistical power than cohort studies, which must often wait for a &#x27;sufficient&#x27; number of disease events to accrue.

Case–control studies are observational in nature and thus do not provide the same level of evidence as randomized controlled trials. The results may be confounded by other factors, to the extent of giving the opposite answer to better studies. A meta-analysis of what was considered 30 high-quality studies concluded that use of a product halved a risk, when in fact the risk was, if anything, increased. It may also be more difficult to establish the timeline of exposure to disease outcome in the setting of a case–control study than within a prospective cohort study design where the exposure is ascertained prior to following the subjects over time in order to ascertain their outcome status. The most important drawback in case–control studies relates to the difficulty of obtaining reliable information about an individual&#x27;s exposure status over time. Case–control studies are therefore placed low in the hierarchy of evidence.

==Examples==
One of the most significant triumphs of the case–control study was the demonstration of the link between tobacco smoking and lung cancer, by Richard Doll and Bradford Hill. They showed a statistically significant association in a large case–control study. Opponents argued for many years that this type of study cannot prove causation, but the eventual results of cohort studies confirmed the causal link which the case–control studies suggested, and it is now accepted that tobacco smoking is the cause of about 87% of all lung cancer mortality in the US.

==Analysis==
Case–control studies were initially analyzed by testing whether or not there were significant differences between the proportion of exposed subjects among cases and controls. Subsequently, Cornfield pointed out that, when the disease outcome of interest is rare, the odds ratio of exposure can be used to estimate the relative risk (see rare disease assumption). The validity of the odds ratio depends highly on the nature of the disease studied, on the sampling methodology and on the type of follow-up. Although in classical case–control studies, it remains true that the odds ratio can only approximate the relative risk in the case of rare diseases, there is a number of other types of studies (case–cohort, nested case–control, cohort studies) in which it was later shown that the odds ratio of exposure can be used to estimate the relative risk or the incidence rate ratio of exposure without the need for the rare disease assumption.

When the logistic regression model is used to model the case–control data and the odds ratio is of interest, both the prospective and retrospective likelihood methods will lead to identical maximum likelihood estimations for covariate, except for the intercept. The usual methods of estimating more interpretable parameters than odds ratios—such as risk ratios, levels, and differences—is biased if applied to case–control data, but special statistical procedures provide easy to use consistent estimators.

== Impact on longevity and public health ==

Tetlock and Gardner claimed that the contributions of medical science to increasing human longevity and public health were negligible, and too often negative, until Scottish physician Archie Cochrane was able to convince the medical establishment to adopt randomized control trials after World War II.

<doc id="788662" wikidata="Q1057925" url="?curid=788662" title="Northeast China">
<text>Northeast China () is a region of the People&#x27;s Republic of China. It consists of three provinces, namely Liaoning, Jilin, and Heilongjiang.

The heartland of the region is the Northeast China Plain, the largest plain in China, with an area of over . It is separated from the Russian Far East to the north by the Amur, Argun, and Ussuri Rivers; from North Korea to the south by the Yalu and Tumen Rivers; and from Inner Mongolia to the west by the Greater Khingan and parts of the Xiliao River.

Due to the shrinking of its once-powerful industrial sector and the decline of its economic growth and population, the region is often referred to as China&#x27;s Rust Belt. As a result, a campaign named Northeast Area Revitalization Plan was launched in the 2000s by the State Council of the People&#x27;s Republic of China, in which five prefectures of eastern Inner Mongolia, namely Hulunbuir, Hinggan, Tongliao, Chifeng and Xilin Gol, are also formally defined as regions of the Northeast.

==Names==

The name &quot;Manchuria&quot; is an exonym of Japanese origin, derived from the endonym &quot;Manchu&quot; and first used in the 18th or 19th century, though not itself used by the Manchus or Chinese people. Variations of &quot;Manchuria&quot; which arrived in European languages through Dutch, as a calque of the Japanese &#x27;Region of the Manchus&#x27;). The toponym has since become associated with Japanese colonialism. Its use is considered controversial by some historians such as Mark C. Elliott, Norman Smith, and Mariko Asano Tamanoi who question its legitimacy. In China, areas once considered part of Manchuria are referred to as the &quot;Northeast&quot;.

The area was historically referred to by various names. During the Ming dynasty, the area in which the Jurchens lived was referred to as Nurgan. The Qing dynasty used names such as &quot;Guandong&quot; (), East of the Pass) or the &quot;Three Provinces&quot; () referring to Jilin, Heilongjiang, and Fengtian since 1683 when Heilongjiang was split from Jilin.

== History ==
Northeast China was the homeland of several ethnic groups, including the Koreans, Manchus (or Jurchens), Ulchs, Hezhen (also known as the Goldi and Nanai), Sushen, Xianbei, and Mohe. The Han Chinese have settled in Northeast China at several points in history, with the first Chinese kingdom to enter the area being the state of Yan. The region came under the rule of various states throughout history, including Yan, Gija Joseon, Wiman Joseon, Buyeo, Western Han, Goguryeo, Xin dynasty, Eastern Han, Gongsun Yan, Cao Wei, Western Jin, Former Yan, Former Qin, Later Yan, Tang dynasty, Wu Zhou, Balhae, Liao dynasty, Jin dynasty, Eastern Liao, Later Liao, Eastern Xia, Mongol Empire, Yuan dynasty, Northern Yuan, Ming dynasty, Qing dynasty, and Republic of China.

During the late Qing dynasty, Northeast China came under influence of the Russian Empire with the building of the Chinese Eastern Railway through Harbin to Vladivostok. The Empire of Japan replaced Russian influence in the region as a result of the Russo-Japanese War in 1904–1905, and Japan laid the South Manchurian Railway in 1906 to Port Arthur. During the Warlord Era in the Republic of China, Zhang Zuolin established himself in Northeast China, but was murdered by the Japanese for being too independent. The last Qing emperor, Puyi, was then placed on the throne to lead a Japanese puppet state of Manchukuo. After the atomic bombing of Japan in 1945, the Soviet Union invaded the region as part of its declaration of war against Japan. From 1945 to 1948, Northeast China was a base area for the Communist People&#x27;s Liberation Army in the Chinese Civil War. With the encouragement of the Soviet Union, the area was used as a staging ground during the Civil War for the Chinese Communists, who were victorious in 1949 and have been controlling this region since.

== Demographics ==

Northeast China has a total population of about 107,400,000 people, accounting for 8% of China&#x27;s total population. The overwhelming majority of the population in the Northeast is Han Chinese, many of whose ancestors came in the 19th and 20th centuries during a migration movement called &quot;Chuang Guandong&quot; (). Northeast China historically had a significant Han Chinese population, reaching over 3 million by the end of the Ming Dynasty, but they were subjected to eviction and assimilation by the conquest of the Qing Dynasty, who then set up Willow Palisades during the reign of Shunzhi Emperor and prohibited any settlement of Han Chinese into the region. Despite officially prohibiting Han Chinese settlement, by the 18th century the Qing decided to settle Han into the Northeast so that Han Chinese farmed 500,000 hectares in the region by the 1780s. Besides moving into the Liao area in southern Manchuria, the path linking Jinzhou, Fengtian, Tieling, Changchun, Hulun, and Ningguta was settled by Han Chinese during the Qianlong Emperor&#x27;s reign, and Han Chinese were the majority in urban areas of Manchuria by 1800.
This resulted in the local Han Chinese population growing to over 20 million before the Second Sino-Japanese War. After the establishment of the People&#x27;s Republic of China at the end of the Chinese Civil War, further immigrations were organized by the Central Government to &quot;develop the Great Northern Wilderness&quot; (), eventually peaking the population at over 100 million people.

Because most people in Northeast China trace their ancestries back to the migrants from the Chuang Guandong era, Northeastern Chinese were more culturally uniform compared to other geographical regions of China. People from the Northeast would first identify themselves as &quot;Northeasterners&quot; () before affiliating to individual provinces and cities/towns.

Ethnic Manchus form the second significant ethnic group in Northeast China, followed by the Mongols, Koreans, and the Huis, as well as 49 other ethnic minorities such as Daurs, Sibos, Hezhens, Oroqens, Evenks, and Kyrgyz. Located in the Northeast is the Yanbian Korean Autonomous Prefecture where ethnic Koreans make up roughly 35% of the population.

=== Religion ===

Taoism and Chinese Buddhism coexist alongside predominating Chinese folk religions led by local shamans. The region has also a strong presence of folk religions and Confucian churches.

== Economy ==
The Northeast was one of the earliest regions to industrialize in China during the era of Manchukuo. Many of what became Chinese state-owned enterprises in the region originated under Japanese colonialization, particularly in the Manchukuo puppet state.

After the founding of the People&#x27;s Republic of China, Northeast China continued to be a major industrial base of the country, and has been hailed as &quot;the Republic&#x27;s eldest son&quot; (). Recent years, however, have seen the stagnation of Northeast China&#x27;s heavy-industry-based economy, as China&#x27;s economy continues to liberalize and privatize; the government has initialized the Revitalize the Northeast campaign to counter this problem, and established the Northeast Summit to improve policy coordination and integration. The region has experienced difficulty distancing itself from a planned economy, a legacy that began in 1905 with the establishment of the Japanese sphere of influence there. The region&#x27;s once-abundant raw materials have also depleted and the economy has suffered from bureaucratic inefficiency and protectionist politics.

The region is, on the whole, more heavily urbanised than most parts of China, largely because it was the first part of the country to develop heavy industry owing to its abundant coal reserves. Major cities include Shenyang, Dalian, Harbin, Changchun and Anshan, all with several million inhabitants. Other cities include the steel making centres of Fushun and Anshan in Liaoning, Jilin City in Jilin, and Qiqihar and Mudanjiang in Heilongjiang. Harbin, more than any other city in China, possesses significant Russian influences: there are many Orthodox churches that have fallen out of use since the Cultural Revolution. Shenyang and Dalian, meanwhile, have sizable populations of Japanese and South Koreans due to their traditional linkages.

The Northeast is an important breadbasket region of China, as the Northeast China Plain has the largest stretch of arable flatland in the country, with an abundance of fertile black soil. The rural population heavily concentrated in the warmer southern part of the Northeast, where very warm to hot summer weather permits crops such as maize and millet to be grown with high yields. Soybeans and flax are also very important, as are wheat and barley. The region possesses large flocks of sheep, and pigs are abundant in the more densely settled southern part. The northern half of Heilongjiang is so cold and poorly drained that agriculture is almost impossible; however, the Amur River provides very rich fisheries, and sheep are even more abundant than in southern Heilongjiang.

Northeast China is the country&#x27;s traditional industrial base, focusing mainly on equipment manufacturing. Major industries include the steel, automobile, shipbuilding, aircraft manufacturing, and petroleum refining industries. The Anshan Iron and Steel Works was the most important industrial enterprise in northeast China until the discovery of the Daqing oil field in 1959.

The region supplied many of the staff for the Third Front Construction of industrial bases in China&#x27;s interior.

As a response to the return of sent-down youth, state-owned enterprises in the late 1970s and 1980s often started collectively-owned enterprises to create employment opportunities for the family of SOE workers. This approach to providing jobs for returning youth was particularly common in northeast China.

After Reform and Opening Up, much of the industry in China&#x27;s northeast lagged in economic activity. 

In the 2000s, the Chinese government developed the Northeast Area Revitalization Plan to counteract the economic stagnation that had resulted from an overreliance on state-own enterprises and heavy industry. However, the region has continued to struggle economically. In 2023, Heilongjian had the second-lowest GDP per person out of all Chinese provinces. An aging population and the net outward migration of young workers have introduced additional demographic challenges; in 2023, the population in Heilongjian was declining faster than any other province in China.

== Culture ==

In general, the culture of Northeast China takes its elements from the cultures of North China and Shandong, the hometowns of most of the Han Chinese who migrated into Northeast China during the Chuang Guandong. Northeast China also takes cultural inspiration from the Tungusic peoples.
=== Dialects ===
There are two main varieties of Mandarin Chinese spoken in Northeast China. 

The most widely spoken lect is Northeastern Mandarin, commonly as &quot;dongbeihua&quot; (), spoken throughout Heilongjiang, Jilin, and most of Liaoning. It is very closely related to Standard Mandarin, though with unique phonological and syntactic features, and has noticeable vocabulary differences, with some terms originating from Russian. There are enough differences from Mandarin to give &quot;dongbeihua&quot; its own distinctive characteristics. 

The second variety is Jiaoliao Mandarin, spoken in the Liaodong Peninsula, as well as the Jiaodong Peninsula in Shandong. It is phonologically more different to Standard Mandarin than Northeastern Mandarin.

Ethnic Manchus speak mostly Mandarin, and the Manchu language is almost extinct due to widespread assimilation to Han culture over the last four centuries. Ethnic Mongols tend to be bilingual in their own Mongolian tongues as well as Mandarin.

=== Cuisine ===
Northeastern Chinese cuisine reflects the region&#x27;s ethnic diversity, blending Northern Han, Manchu and Korean cooking styles. One of the distinguishing characteristics of the cuisine is the use of uncooked fresh vegetables. During the long winter season, pickled Chinese cabbage, which is called &quot;suan cai&quot;, is preserved and used for cooking. Different from other parts of Northern China, rice is consumed more in Northeast China. Most of the meat dishes are based around pork due to how cold it can get. Often braised pork or dumplings are the main attraction of a meal.

=== Folk dance and sports ===
Errenzhuan, yangge, Jilin opera and stilts are popular forms of traditional entertainment in Northeast China. &quot;Northeastern Cradle Song&quot; is an example of the folk songs of this region.

Because of its climatic conditions, Northeast China is the base for China&#x27;s winter sports. Ice hockey and ice skating athletes often come from or were educated in Northeast China.

=== Film, music, and literature ===
In 2019, the term Dongbei renaissance was coined by the rapper Gem to describe a revival in interest in the culture of the Northeast after his song Yelang Disco went viral. Artwork associated with the Dongbei renaissance often incorporates nostalgia for the &quot;corny&quot; aesthetics of the 1970s boom period of the Northeast, self-deprecating humor, and speculations on the decline and potential future of the economically depressed region. Notable works associated with the movement include Shuang Xuetao&#x27;s fiction collection &quot;Moses on the Plain&quot; and the Diao Yinan film Black Coal, Thin Ice.

<text>Kenorland is a hypothetical Neoarchean supercontinent. If it existed, it would have been one of the earliest known supercontinents on Earth. It is thought to have formed during the Neoarchaean Era c. 2.72 billion years ago (2.72 Ga) by the accretion of Neoarchaean cratons and the formation of new continental crust. It comprised what later became Laurentia (the core of today&#x27;s North America and Greenland), Baltica (today&#x27;s Scandinavia and Baltic), Western Australia and Kalaharia.

Swarms of volcanic dikes and their paleomagnetic orientation as well as the existence of similar stratigraphic sequences permit this reconstruction. The core of Kenorland, the Baltic/Fennoscandian Shield, traces its origins back to over 3.1 Ga. The Yilgarn Craton (present-day Western Australia) contains zircon crystals in its crust that date back to 4.4 Ga.

Kenorland was named after the Kenoran orogeny (also called the Algoman orogeny), which in turn was named after the town of Kenora, Ontario.

==Formation==
Kenorland was formed around 2.72 billion years ago (2.72 Ga) as a result of a series of accretion events and the formation of new continental crust.

The accretion events are recorded in the greenstone belts of the Yilgarn Craton as metamorphosed basalt belts and granitic domes accreted around the high grade metamorphic core of the Western Gneiss terrane, which includes elements of up to 3.2 Ga in age and some older portions, for example the Narryer Gneiss terrane.
==Breakup or disassembly==
Paleomagnetic studies show Kenorland was in generally low latitudes until tectonic magma-plume rifting began to occur between 2.48 Ga and 2.45 Ga. At 2.45 Ga the Baltic Shield was over the equator and was joined to Laurentia (the Canadian Shield) and both the Kola and Karelia cratons. The protracted breakup of Kenorland during the Late Neoarchaean and early Paleoproterozoic Era 2.48 to 2.10 Gya, during the Siderian and Rhyacian periods, is manifested by mafic dikes and sedimentary rift-basins and rift-margins on many continents. On early Earth, this type of bimodal deep mantle plume rifting was common in Archaean and Neoarchaean crust and continent formation.
The geological time period surrounding the breakup of Kenorland is thought by many geologists to be the beginning of the transition point from the deep-mantle-plume method of continent formation in the Hadean to Early Archean (before the final formation of the Earth&#x27;s inner core) to the subsequent two-layer core-mantle plate tectonics convection theory. However, the findings of an earlier continent, Ur, and a supercontinent of around 3.1 Gya, Vaalbara, indicate this transition period may have occurred much earlier.
The Kola and Karelia cratons began to drift apart around 2.45 Gya, and by 2.4 Gya the Kola craton was at about 30 degrees south latitude and the Karelia craton was at about 15 degrees south latitude. Paleomagnetic evidence shows that at 2.45 Gya the Yilgarn craton (now the bulk of Western Australia) was not connected to Fennoscandia-Laurentia and was at about ~5 degrees south latitude.

This implies that at 2.515 Gya an ocean existed between the Kola and Karelia cratons, and that by 2.45 Gya there was no longer a supercontinent. Also, there is speculation based on the rift margin spatial arrangements of Laurentia, that at some time during the breakup, the Slave and Superior cratons were not part of the supercontinent Kenorland, but, by then may have been two different Neoarchaean landmasses (supercratons) on opposite ends of a very large Kenorland. This is based on how drifting assemblies of various constituent pieces should flow reasonably together toward the amalgamation of the new subsequent continent. The Slave and Superior cratons now constitute the northwest and southeast portions of the Canadian Shield, respectively. 

The breakup of Kenorland was contemporary with the Huronian glaciation which persisted for up to 60 million years. The banded iron formations (BIF) show their greatest extent at this period, thus indicating a massive increase in oxygen build-up from an estimated 0.1% of the atmosphere to 1%. The rise in oxygen levels caused the virtual disappearance of the greenhouse gas methane (oxidized into carbon dioxide and water).

The simultaneous breakup of Kenorland generally increased continental rainfall everywhere, thus increasing erosion and further reducing the other greenhouse gas, carbon dioxide. With the reduction in greenhouse gases, and with solar output being less than 85% its current power, this led to a runaway Snowball Earth scenario, where average temperatures planet-wide plummeted to below freezing. Despite the anoxia indicated by the BIF, photosynthesis continued, stabilizing climates at new levels during the second part of the Proterozoic Era.

<text>In computer networking, a network service is an application running at the network application layer and above, that provides data storage, manipulation, presentation, communication or other capability which is often implemented using a client–server or peer-to-peer architecture based on application layer network protocols.

Each service is usually provided by a server component running on one or more computers (often a dedicated server computer offering multiple services) and accessed via a network by client components running on other devices. However, the client and server components can both be run on the same machine.

Clients and servers will often have a user interface, and sometimes other hardware associated with it.

==Examples==

Examples are the Domain Name System (DNS) which translates domain names to Internet Protocol (IP) addresses and the Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) to assign networking configuration information to network hosts. Authentication servers identify and authenticate users, provide user account profiles, and may log usage statistics.

Email, printing and distributed (network) file system services are common services on local area networks. They require users to have permissions to access the shared resources.

Other network services include:
* Directory services
* Email
* File sharing
* Instant messaging
* Online game
* Printing
* File server
* Voice over IP
* Video on demand
* Videotelephony
* World Wide Web
* Simple Network Management Protocol
* Time service
* Wireless sensor network

==Application layer==
In computer network programming, the application layer is an abstraction layer reserved for communications protocols and methods designed for process-to-process communications across an IP network. Application layer protocols use the underlying transport layer protocols to establish host-to-host connections for network services.

===TCP-IP network services===

====Port numbers====
Many IP-based services are associated with a particular well-known port number which is standardized by the Internet technical governance.

For example, World-Wide-Web servers operate on port 80, and email relay servers usually listen on port 25.

===TCP versus UDP===

Different services use different packet transmission techniques.

In general, packets that must get through in the correct order, without loss, use TCP, whereas real time services where later packets are more important than older packets use UDP.

For example, file transfer requires complete accuracy and so is normally done using TCP, and audio conferencing is frequently done via UDP, where momentary glitches may not be noticed.

UDP lacks built-in network congestion avoidance and the protocols that use it must be extremely carefully designed to prevent network collapse.

<doc id="788678" wikidata="Q870505" url="?curid=788678" title="Columbia (supercontinent)">
<text>Columbia, also known as Nuna or Hudsonland, is a hypothetical ancient supercontinent. It was first proposed by John J.W. Rogers and M. Santosh in 2002 and is thought to have existed approximately (Ma), in the Paleoproterozoic era. The assembly of the supercontinent was likely completed during global-scale collisional events from 2,100 to 1,800 Ma.

Columbia consisted of proto-cratons that made up the cores of the continents of Laurentia, Baltica, Ukrainian Shield, Amazonian Craton, Australia, and possibly Siberia, North China, and Kalaharia as well. The evidence of Columbia&#x27;s existence is provided by geological and paleomagnetic data.

==Size and location==

Columbia is estimated to have been approximately from north to south at its broadest part. The eastern coast of India was attached to western North America, with southern Australia against western Canada. In the Paleoproterozoic most of South America was rotated such that the western edge of modern-day Brazil lined up with eastern North America, forming a continental margin that extended into the southern edge of Scandinavia.

==Formation==
Columbia was assembled along global-scale 2.1–1.8 Ga collisional orogens and contained almost all of Earth&#x27;s continental blocks. Some of the events associated with the assembly of Columbia are:
* the cratonic blocks in South America and West Africa were welded by the 2.1–2.0 Ga Transamazonian and Eburnean orogens;
* the Kaapvaal and Zimbabwe cratons in southern Africa were collided along the c. 2.0 Ga Limpopo Belt;
* the cratonic blocks of Laurentia were sutured along the 1.9–1.8 Ga Trans-Hudson, Penokean, Taltson–Thelon, Wopmay, Ungava, Torngat, and Nagssugtoqidian orogens;
* the Kola, Karelia, Volgo–Uralia, and Sarmatia cratons in Baltica (Eastern Europe) were joined by the 1.9–1.8 Ga Kola–Karelia, Svecofennian, Volyn-Central Russian, and Pachelma orogens;
* the Anabar and Aldan Cratons in Siberia were connected by the 1.9–1.8 Ga Akitkan and Central Aldan orogens;
* the East Antarctica and an unknown continental block were joined by the 1.73–1.70 Ga Nimrod orogen;
* the South and North Indian Blocks were amalgamated along the Central Indian Tectonic Zone;
* and the eastern and western blocks of the North China Craton were welded together by the c. 1.85 Ga Trans-North China Orogen.

==Outgrowth==
Following its final assembly at c. 1.82 Ga, Columbia underwent long-lived (1.82–1.5 Ga), subduction-related growth via accretion at key continental margins, forming at 1.82–1.5 Ga a great magmatic accretionary belt along the present-day southern margin of North America, Greenland, and Baltica. It includes the 1.8–1.7 Ga Yavapai, Central Plains and Makkovikian Belts, 1.7–1.6 Ga Mazatzal and Labradorian Belts, 1.5–1.3 Ga St. Francois and Spavinaw Belts, and 1.3–1.2 Ga Elzevirian Belt in North America; the 1.8–1.7 Ga Ketilidian Belt in Greenland; and the 1.8–1.7 Transscandinavian Igneous Belt, 1.7–1.6 Ga Kongsberggian-Gothian Belt, and 1.5–1.3 Ga Southwest Sweden Granitoid Belt in Baltica. Other cratonic blocks also underwent marginal outgrowth at about the same time.

In South America, a 1.8–1.3 Ga accretionary zone occurs along the western margin of the Amazonia Craton, represented by the Rio Negro, Juruena, and Rondonian Belts. In Australia, 1.8–1.5 Ga accretionary magmatic belts, including the Arunta, Mount Isa, Georgetown, Coen, and Broken Hill Belts, occur surrounding the southern and eastern margins of the North Australia Craton and the eastern margin of the Gawler Craton. In China, a 1.8–1.4 Ga accretionary magmatic zone, called the Xiong’er belt (Group), extends along the southern margin of the North China Craton.

==Fragmentation==
Columbia began to fragment about 1.5–1.35 Ga, associated with continental rifting along the western margin of Laurentia (Belt-Purcell Supergroup), eastern India (Mahanadi and the Godavari), southern margin of Baltica (Telemark Supergroup), southeastern margin of Siberia (Riphean aulacogens), northwestern margin of South Africa (Kalahari Copper Belt), and northern margin of the North China Block (Zhaertai-Bayan Obo Belt).

The fragmentation corresponded with widespread anorogenic magmatic activity, forming anorthosite-mangerite-charnockite-granite suites in North America, Baltica, Amazonia, and North China, and continued until the final breakup of the supercontinent at about 1.3–1.2 Ga, marked by the emplacement of the 1.27 Ga Mackenzie and 1.24 Ga Sudbury mafic dyke swarms in North America. Other dyke swarms associated with extensional tectonics and the break-up of Columbia include the Satakunta-Ulvö dyke swarm in Fennoscandia and the Galiwinku dyke swarm in Australia.

An area around Georgetown in northern Queensland, Australia, has been suggested to consist of rocks that originally formed part of Nuna 1.7 Ga in what is now northern Canada.

==Configuration==
In the initial configuration of Rogers and Santosh (2002), South Africa, Madagascar, India, Australia, and attached parts of Antarctica are placed adjacent to the western margin of North America, whereas Greenland, Baltica (Northern Europe), and Siberia are positioned adjacent to the northern margin of North America, and South America is placed against West Africa. In the same year (2002), Zhao et al. proposed an alternative configuration of Columbia, in which the fits of Baltica and Siberia with Laurentia and the fit of South America with West Africa are similar to those of the Rogers and Santosh configuration, whereas the fits of India, East Antarctica, South Africa, and Australia with Laurentia are similar to their corresponding fits in the configuration of Rodinia.

This continental configuration is based on the available geological reconstructions of 2.1–1.8 Ga orogens and related Archean cratonic blocks, especially on those reconstructions between South America and west Africa; western Australia and southern Africa; Laurentia and Baltica; Siberia and Laurentia; Laurentia and central Australia; East Antarctica and Laurentia; and North China and India. Of these reconstructions, the fits of Baltica and Siberia with Laurentia; South America with west Africa; and southern Africa with western Australia are also consistent with paleomagnetic data.

A new configuration of Columbia was reconstructed by Guiting Hou (2008) based on the reconstruction of giant radiating dike swarms. Another configuration has been suggested by Chaves and Rezende (2019) supported on available paleomagnetic data and fragments of 1.79-1.75 Ga large igneous provinces.

==Name and synonyms==
Rogers and Santosh proposed the name &quot;Columbia&quot; for a hypothetical supercontinent preceding Rodinia. They chose the name because critical evidence for the supercontinent was provided by the relationship between the Columbia region of North America (centered on the state of Washington) and east India.

The naming is not universally accepted. In 1997, P.F. Hoffman proposed the name &quot;Nuna&quot; (from Inuit &quot;lands bordering the northern oceans&quot;) for the Proterozoic core of Laurentia plus Baltica. Because Hoffman published his name earlier than Rogers and Santosh published theirs, there have been calls to use &quot;Nuna&quot; rather than &quot;Columbia&quot;, on the basis of scientific precedence. However, &quot;Nuna&quot; was essentially equivalent to an earlier &quot;Nena&quot;, and neither clearly referred to an early supercontinent as &quot;Columbia&quot; did, rather than merely the core of this earlier supercontinent. Other earlier speculative continents included &quot;Hudsonland&quot; and &quot;Arctica&quot;, but Rogers and Santosh were the first to give a complete reconstruction of a Paleoproterozic supercontinent preceding Rodinia.

<text>In United States law, a statement against penal interest is a statement that puts the statement-maker at risk of prosecution. It is the criminal equivalent of a statement against interest, a statement a person would not normally make, which would put them in a disadvantaged position that they would have had if they had not made the statement in the first place.

In certain circumstances, it can be a factor in allowing as evidence statements that would otherwise be excluded through the law of hearsay.

<text>Mount Kelsey is a mountain located in the western portion of Millsfield, New Hampshire. The western slopes of the mountain are contained within the township of Erving&#x27;s Location, New Hampshire. The summit is occupied by part of the Granite Reliable Wind Farm, with road access from the Phillips Brook watershed to the south.

The north side of Mount Kelsey drains into the West Branch of Clear Stream, a tributary of the Androscoggin River, which flows south and east into Maine, joining the Kennebec River near the Atlantic Ocean. The southeast side of Kelsey drains into North Inlet Stream, thence into Millsfield Pond Brook, and into Clear Stream. The west side of Kelsey drains into Phillips Brook, thence into the Upper Ammonoosuc River, the upper Connecticut River, and into Long Island Sound in Connecticut.

<text>William Howard Taft III (August 7, 1915 – February 23, 1991) was an American diplomat who served as United States Ambassador to Ireland from 1953 to 1957, and was a grandson of President William Howard Taft and First Lady Helen Louise &quot;Nellie&quot; Taft.

==Early life==
William Howard Taft III was born on August 7, 1915, and was the eldest of four sons born to Robert A. Taft (1889–1953) and Martha Wheaton Bowers (1889–1958), daughter of Lloyd Wheaton Bowers (1859–1910), the former solicitor general of the United States from 1909 to 1910. His three brothers were: Robert Taft Jr. (1917–1993), who was elected to the U.S. Senate; Lloyd Bowers Taft (1923–1985), who worked as an investment banker in Cincinnati, and Horace Dwight Taft (1925–1983), who became a professor of physics and dean at Yale.
At the time of his birth, his grandfather had just ended his Presidency and had recently become the Kent Professor of Law and Legal History at Yale Law School. Taft graduated from Yale University and earned a doctorate from Princeton University.

==Career==
After graduating from Princeton, Taft taught English at the University of Maryland and Haverford College. During World War II, Taft became an analyst in military intelligence. After the war ended, he went back to Yale and taught there.

In 1949, he went to Dublin as part of the Marshall Plan aid mission and worked for the Central Intelligence Agency and the Defense Department from 1951 to 1953.

===Ambassador to Ireland===
In 1953, President Eisenhower appointed Taft U.S. ambassador to Ireland. His task as ambassador was made easier by the fact that John A. Costello (Taoiseach, 1954–57) was a personal friend; Taft described Costello as &quot;pleasant and unassuming&quot; whereas he had found Éamon de Valera &quot;formal and aloof&quot;. (His predecessor, George A. Garrett, had also found Costello more sympathetic than de Valera.) Taft played a considerable part in organizing Costello&#x27;s successful state visit to the United States in March 1956.

In 1957, Eisenhower appointed R. W. Scott McLeod as his successor to the Ambassadorship and Taft returned to the State Department as a member of its policy planning staff. He remained with State until 1960, when he became Consul General in Mozambique. He retired from the State Department&#x27;s bureau for scientific, environmental and space affairs in 1977.

==Personal life==
Taft married Barbara Bradfield, with whom he had four children:
*John Thomas Taft
*William Howard Taft IV (b. 1945), who married Julia Vadala (1942–2008)
*Maria Herron Taft, who married John Clemow, son of Albert George Clemow, in 1971.
*Martha Bowers Taft, who married Michael Golden, son of the British Michael Golden, in 1971.
Taft was a member of the Metropolitan Club of Washington, D.C. He died of prostate cancer at his Washington home on February 23, 1991.

<doc id="788696" wikidata="Q358271" url="?curid=788696" title="William Hall (governor)">
<text>William Hall (February 11, 1775October 7, 1856) was an American politician who served as the seventh Governor of the state of Tennessee from April to October 1829.

Hall ascended to the office when Governor Sam Houston resigned amidst a scandal, and, as Speaker of the Tennessee Senate, he was the first in the line of succession. After finishing Houston&#x27;s term, he did not seek reelection. Hall had previously served in the Tennessee state legislature, both in the House and Senate. Following his brief term as governor, he served one term in the United States House of Representatives.

==Early life==
Hall was born in Surry County in the Province of North Carolina. He was the son of Major William Hall and Elizabeth Thankful Doak. In 1779, the family moved to the New River Valley of Virginia. In 1785, they moved again, this time to a tract of land that would eventually be known as &quot;Locustland,&quot; near modern Castalian Springs, Tennessee. Locustland would remain Hall&#x27;s residence for much of the remainder of his life.

The Cherokee–American wars were raging at this time, and the Sumner County area north of Nashville was particularly vulnerable. On June 3, 1787, William&#x27;s brother, James, was killed as the two were ambushed as they walked through a field, though William managed to escape. Two months later, as the family was moving its possessions into nearby Bledsoe&#x27;s Station in anticipation of a Chickamauga Cherokee attack, they were again ambushed. William&#x27;s brother, Richard, brother-in-law, Charles Morgan, and father were killed. William, along with his mother and two younger siblings, John and Prudence, managed to make it into the fort.

==Career==
During the early 1790s, Hall served as sheriff of Sumner County. In 1796, he was promoted to the rank of major in the Sumner County militia. He served in the Tennessee House of Representatives from 1797 until 1805.

At the outbreak of the War of 1812, he joined the Tennessee Volunteer Infantry with the rank of colonel, and had achieved the rank of brigadier general by the following year.

In 1821, Hall was elected to the Tennessee Senate. In 1827, he was chosen as speaker of the senate. In April 1829, Sam Houston resigned the governorship following a personal scandal. As Speaker of the Senate, Hall was the first in the line of succession, and thus became governor on April 16. He did not seek reelection, however, and Houston&#x27;s predecessor, William Carroll, was elected without opposition a few months later. During his brief time in office, Hall continued with the reform plans that Carroll and Houston had started.

An ally of Andrew Jackson, Hall later served in the U.S. House of Representatives for one term (1831–1833) (Twenty-second Congress) and then retired from public life.

==Death==
Hall died at his farm, Locustland, in Sumner County, a few weeks after giving an account of his frontier experiences for the June 1856 issue of &quot;Southwestern Monthly&quot;. He is interred at the family cemetery there.

<doc id="788698" wikidata="Q186486" url="?curid=788698" title="Hachikō">
<text>was a Japanese Akita dog remembered for his remarkable loyalty to his owner, Hidesaburō Ueno, for whom he continued to wait for over nine years following Ueno&#x27;s death.

Hachikō was born on November 10, 1923, at a farm near the city of Ōdate, Akita Prefecture. In 1924, Hidesaburō Ueno, a professor at the Tokyo Imperial University, brought him to live in Shibuya, Tokyo, as his pet. Hachikō would meet Ueno at Shibuya Station every day after his commute home. This continued until May 21, 1925, when Ueno died of a cerebral hemorrhage while at work. From then until his death on March 8, 1935, Hachikō would return to Shibuya Station every day to await Ueno&#x27;s return.

During his lifetime, the dog was held up in Japanese culture as an example of loyalty and fidelity. Since his death, he continues to be remembered worldwide in popular culture with statues, movies and books. Hachikō is also known in Japanese as , with the suffix originating as one once used for ancient Chinese dukes; in this context, it was an affectionate addition to his name Hachi.

==Life==
Hachikō, a white Akita, was born on November 10, 1923, at a farm located in Ōdate, Akita Prefecture, Japan. In 1924, Hidesaburō Ueno, a professor in the agriculture department at the Tokyo Imperial University, took Hachikō as a pet and brought him to live in Shibuya, Tokyo. Ueno would commute daily to work, and Hachikō would leave the house to greet him at the end of each day at the nearby Shibuya Station. The pair continued the daily routine until May 21, 1925, when Ueno did not return. The professor had suffered a cerebral hemorrhage while he was giving a lecture to his class, and he died without ever returning to the train station at which Hachikō waited.

Each day, for the next 9 years, 9 months and 15 days, Hachikō awaited Ueno&#x27;s return, appearing precisely when the train was due at the station.

Hachikō attracted the attention of other commuters. Many of the people who frequented the Shibuya train station had seen Hachikō and Professor Ueno together each day. Initial reactions from the people, especially from those working at the station, were not necessarily friendly. However, after the first appearance of the article about him in on October 4, 1932, people started to bring Hachikō treats and food to nourish him during his wait.

===Publication===

One of Ueno&#x27;s students, Hirokichi Saito, who developed expertise on the Akita breed, saw the dog at the station and followed him to the home of Ueno&#x27;s former gardener, Kozaburo Kobayashi, where he learned the history of Hachikō&#x27;s life. Shortly after the meeting, the former student published a documented census of Akitas in Japan. His research found only 30 purebred Akitas remaining, including Hachikō from Shibuya Station.

He returned frequently to visit Hachikō, and over the years he published several articles about the dog&#x27;s remarkable loyalty. In 1932, one of his articles, published in , placed the dog in the national spotlight.

Hachikō became a national sensation. His faithfulness to his master&#x27;s memory impressed the people of Japan as a spirit of family loyalty to which all should strive to achieve. Teachers and parents used Hachikō&#x27;s vigil as an example for children to follow. Teru Ando rendered a sculpture of the dog, and throughout the country, a new awareness of the Akita breed grew.

Eventually, Hachikō&#x27;s faithfulness became a national symbol of loyalty, particularly to the person and institution of Emperors.

===Death===
Hachikō died on March 8, 1935, at the age of 11. He was found on a street in Shibuya. In March 2011, scientists finally settled the cause of Hachikō&#x27;s death: the dog had both terminal cancer and a filaria infection. There were also four skewers in Hachikō&#x27;s stomach, but the skewers did not damage his stomach nor cause his death.

==Legacy==
After his death, Hachikō&#x27;s remains were cremated and his ashes were buried in Aoyama Cemetery, Minato, Tokyo where they rest beside those of Hachikō&#x27;s beloved master, Professor Ueno. Hachikō&#x27;s pelt was preserved after his death, and his taxidermy mount is on permanent display at the National Science Museum of Japan in Ueno, Tokyo.

===Bronze statues===
In April 1934, a bronze statue based in his likeness sculpted by Teru Ando was erected at Shibuya Station. The statue was recycled for the war effort during World War II. In 1948, Takeshi Ando (son of the original artist) made a second statue. The new statue, which was erected in August 1948, still stands and is a popular meeting spot. The station entrance near this statue is named &quot;Hachikō-guchi&quot;, meaning &quot;The Hachikō Entrance/Exit&quot;, and is one of Shibuya Station&#x27;s five exits.

A similar statue stands in Hachikō&#x27;s hometown, in front of Ōdate Station; it was built in 1932. In 2004, a new statue of Hachikō was erected in front of the Akita Dog Museum in Ōdate.

After the release of the American movie &quot;&quot; (2009), which was filmed in Woonsocket, Rhode Island, the Japanese Consulate in the United States helped the Blackstone Valley Tourism Council and the city of Woonsocket to unveil an identical statue of Hachikō at the Woonsocket Depot Square, which was the location of the &quot;Bedridge&quot; train station featured in the movie.

On March 9, 2015, the Faculty of Agriculture of the University of Tokyo, Ueno&#x27;s alma mater and workplace where he commuted every workday during his time with Hachikō, unveiled a bronze statue depicting Ueno returning to meet Hachikō to commemorate the 80th anniversary of Hachikō&#x27;s death. The statue was sculpted by Tsutomu Ueda from Nagoya and depicts an excited Hachikō jumping up to greet his master at the end of a workday. Ueno is dressed in a hat, suit, and trench coat, with his briefcase placed on the ground. Hachikō wears a studded harness as seen in his last photos.

===Annual ceremony===

Each year on March 8, Hachikō&#x27;s devotion is honored with a solemn ceremony of remembrance at Shibuya Station. Hundreds of dog lovers often turn out to honor his memory and loyalty.

===Hachikō&#x27;s bark===
In 1994, Nippon Cultural Broadcasting in Japan was able to lift a recording of Hachikō barking from an old 78 RPM record that had been broken into several pieces. The pieces were melded together using a laser. A huge advertising campaign ensued and on Saturday, May 28, 1994, 59 years after his death, millions of radio listeners tuned in to hear Hachikō&#x27;s bark.

===Shibuya ward minibus===
In 2003, in Shibuya ward, a minibus (officially called &quot;community bus&quot;) started routes in the ward, nicknamed &quot;Hachiko-bus&quot;. There are four different routes. People can hear the theme song in this bus.

===Images===
In July 2012, rare photos from Hachikō&#x27;s life were shown at the Shibuya Folk and Literary Shirane Memorial Museum in Shibuya ward as part of the (exhibition of newly stored materials).

In November 2015, a previously undiscovered photograph of Hachikō was published for the first time. The image, which was captured in 1934 by a Tokyo bank employee, shows the dog relaxing by himself in front of Shibuya Station.

===Yaeko Sakano===
, more often referred as Yaeko Ueno, was the unmarried partner of Hidesaburō Ueno for about 10 years until his death in 1925. Hachikō was reported to have shown great happiness and affection towards her whenever she came to visit him. Yaeko died on April 30, 1961, at the age of 76 and was buried at a temple in Taitō, further away from Ueno&#x27;s grave, despite her requests to her family members to be buried with her late partner.

In 2013, Yaeko&#x27;s record, which indicated that she had wanted to be buried with Ueno, was found by Sho Shiozawa, the professor of the University of Tokyo. Shiozawa was also the president of the Japanese Society of Irrigation, Drainage and Rural Engineering, which manages Ueno&#x27;s grave at Aoyama Cemetery.

Later on November 10, 2013, which also marked the 90th anniversary of the birth of Hachikō, Sho Shiozawa and Keita Matsui, a curator of the Shibuya Folk and Literary Shirane Memorial Museum, felt the need of Yaeko to be buried together with Ueno and Hachikō.

The process began with willing consent from the Ueno and Sakano families and the successful negotiations with management of the Aoyama Cemetery. However, due to regulations and bureaucracy, the process took about 2 years. Shiozawa also went on as one of the organizers involved with the erection of bronze statue of Hachikō and Ueno which was unveiled on the grounds of the University of Tokyo on March 9, 2015, to commemorate the 80th anniversary of Hachikō&#x27;s death.

===89th Birthday===
On November 10, 2012, Google commemorated what would have been Hachikō&#x27;s 89th birthday by uploading a Google Doodle that depicts the famous dog waiting by the Shibuya Station railway and holding Ueno&#x27;s hat in his mouth.

===100th Birthday===
On November 10, 2023, the Japanese people commemorated what would have been Hachikō&#x27;s 100th birthday. Events included visits to the Shibuya Station, songs, and dances. A holographic display of Hachikō was installed at the Akita Dog Visitor Center in Odate, Akita Prefecture, greeting guests who came by to celebrate his birth.

==Reunion of Hachikō&#x27;s family==
On May 19, 2016, during the ceremony at the Aoyama Cemetery with both Ueno and Sakano families in present, some of the ashes of Yaeko Sakano were buried with Ueno and Hachikō, her name and the date of her death was inscribed on the side of his tombstone, thus fulfilling the reunion of Hachikō&#x27;s family.

&quot;By putting the names of both on their grave, we can show future generations the fact that Hachikō had two keepers,&quot; Shiozawa said. &quot;To Hachikō the professor was his father, and Yaeko was his mother,&quot; Matsui added.

==In popular culture==
Hachikō plays an important part in the 1967 children&#x27;s book &quot;Taka-chan and I: A Dog&#x27;s Journey to Japan&quot;.

Hachikō was the subject of the 1987 film directed by Seijirō Kōyama, which told the story of his life from his birth up until his death and imagined spiritual reunion with his master. Considered a blockbuster success, the film was the last big hit for Japanese film studio Shochiku Kinema Kenkyū-jo.

&quot;Jurassic Bark&quot; (2002), episode 7 of season 4 of the animated series &quot;Futurama&quot; has an extended homage to Hachikō, with Fry discovering the fossilized remains of his dog, Seymour. After Fry was frozen, Seymour is shown to have waited for Fry to return for 12 years outside Panucci&#x27;s Pizza, where Fry worked, never disobeying his master&#x27;s last command to wait for him.

Hachikō is also the subject of a 2004 children&#x27;s book entitled &quot;Hachikō: The True Story of a Loyal Dog&quot;, written by Pamela S. Turner and illustrated by Yan Nascimbene. Another children&#x27;s book, a short novel for readers of all ages called &quot;Hachiko Waits&quot;, written by Lesléa Newman and illustrated by Machiyo Kodaira, was published by Henry Holt &amp; Co. in 2004. Another illustrated book about the faithful dog is &quot;Hachikō: The Dog that Waited&quot;, by Catalan author Lluís Prats and Polish illustrator Zuzanna Celej, published in 2022.

In the Japanese manga &quot;One Piece&quot;, there is a similar story with a dog named Shushu.

In the video game &quot;The World Ends with You&quot; (2007), the Hachikō statue is featured, its legend referenced on several occasions. The location of the statue plays an important role in the narrative of the game. The statue is featured again in the sequel, &quot;&quot; (2021).

&quot;&quot;, released in August 2009, is an American movie starring actor Richard Gere, directed by Lasse Hallström, about Hachikō and his relationship with an American professor &amp; his family following the same basic story, but a little different, for example Hachikō was a gift to professor Ueno, this part is entirely different in the American version. The movie was filmed in Woonsocket, Rhode Island, primarily in and around the Woonsocket Depot Square area and also featured Joan Allen and Jason Alexander. The role of Hachi was played by three Akitas – Leyla, Chico and Forrest. Mark Harden describes how he and his team trained the three dogs in the book, &quot;Animal Stars: Behind the Scenes with Your Favorite Animal Actors.&quot; After the movie was completed, Harden adopted Chico.

The 2015 Telugu film &quot;Tommy&quot; was based on the story of Hachikō.

<text>In propositional logic, conjunction elimination (also called and elimination, ∧ elimination, or simplification) is a valid immediate inference, argument form and rule of inference which makes the inference that, if the conjunction &quot;A and B&quot; is true, then &quot;A&quot; is true, and &quot;B&quot; is true. The rule makes it possible to shorten longer proofs by deriving one of the conjuncts of a conjunction on a line by itself. 

An example in English:
:It&#x27;s raining and it&#x27;s pouring.
:Therefore it&#x27;s raining.

The rule consists of two separate sub-rules, which can be expressed in formal language as:

:formula_1

and

:formula_2

The two sub-rules together mean that, whenever an instance of &quot;formula_3&quot; appears on a line of a proof, either &quot;formula_4&quot; or &quot;formula_5&quot; can be placed on a subsequent line by itself. The above example in English is an application of the first sub-rule.

== Formal notation ==
The &quot;conjunction elimination&quot; sub-rules may be written in sequent notation:

: formula_6
and
: formula_7

where formula_8 is a metalogical symbol meaning that formula_4 is a syntactic consequence of formula_3 and formula_5 is also a syntactic consequence of formula_3 in logical system;

and expressed as truth-functional tautologies or theorems of propositional logic:

:formula_13
and
:formula_14

where formula_4 and formula_5 are propositions expressed in some formal system.

<text>The Italian Democratic Socialists (, SDI) was a social-democratic political party in Italy. The party was the direct continuation of the Italian Socialists, the legal successor of the historical Italian Socialist Party. The Italian Democratic Socialist Party, the other long-time Italian social-democratic party, was merged into it along with other minor parties. The party&#x27;s long-time leader was Enrico Boselli, a former president of Emilia-Romagna (1990–1993). In 2007, the SDI were merged with other descendants of the PSI to form the modern-day Italian Socialist Party.

==History==

===Early years===
The SDI were founded in 1998 by the merger of the Italian Socialists (Enrico Boselli, Roberto Villetti, and Ottaviano Del Turco), the Italian Democratic Socialist Party (Gian Franco Schietroma, and Giorgio Carta), a portion of the Labour Federation, a portion of the Socialist Party (Ugo Intini), and the Socialist League (Claudio Martelli and Bobo Craxi). In their first appearance on the national stage, the 1999 European Parliament election in Italy, the SDI won 2.2% of the votes and two MEPs. In December 1999, the SDI formed a short-lived centrist alliance (The Clover) with the Union for the Republic and Italian Republican Party, which was responsible for the fall of the D&#x27;Alema I Cabinet in December 1999.

The SDI re-entered The Olive Tree of the centre-left coalition and in 2000 they were originally touted for inclusion in the Democracy is Freedom – The Daisy joint list, before being rejected by the Christian-inspired parties of the alliance, notably including the Italian People&#x27;s Party. For the 2001 Italian general election, the SDI formed an unusual alliance (The Sunflower) with the Federation of the Greens, which was disbanded soon after the election due to political divergences and ultimately to the disappointing electoral result: 2.2% of the vote, while the two parties&#x27; combined result in 1999 had been 4.0%. In the 2004 European Parliament election in Italy, two SDI MEPs were elected on the United in the Olive Tree ticket.

===The Rose in the Fist===
In 2001, Claudio Martelli and Bobo Craxi left the party to form, along with Gianni De Michelis, the New Italian Socialist Party (NPSI), which joined the House of Freedoms of the centre-right coalition, while in 2004 Giorgio Carta left to re-establish the Italian Democratic Socialist Party.

In 2005, the SDI entered in alliance with the Italian Radicals, forming the Rose in the Fist (RnP) electoral list. In 2006, the Socialist Unity of Claudio Signorile joined the SDI, while some members of NPSI, as Donato Robilotta, founded the Reformist Socialists and directly joined the RnP.

In the 2006 Italian general election, the RnP list won only 2.6% of the vote, much less than the combination of the two parties before the alliance, as the Radicals lost voters in their strongholds in the North to Forza Italia, while the Socialists lost ground in the South to The Olive Tree parties.

===Socialist Party===
During a party convention in April 2007, Boselli launched the proposal of a Socialist Constituent Assembly, open to all the Italian social democrats and especially to the remnants of the old Italian Socialist Party, while Ottaviano Del Turco supported the entry of the SDI in the Democratic Party (PD). Boselli was re-elected secretary of the party with 784 votes out of 787 and 3 abstentions. In May, Del Turco and his faction left the SDI and formed the Reformist Alliance (), which would merge into the PD.

Several groups, including a large portion of the New Italian Socialist Party, The Italian Socialists, Democracy and Socialism, and the Association for the Rose in the Fist, decided to join forces with the SDI. This happened on 5 October 2007, when they were merged into a unified Socialist Party, later renamed the Italian Socialist Party on 7 October 2009 to recall the historical party of the same name. The new party obtained 1.0% of the vote and no seats in Parliament in the 2008 Italian general election.

==Leadership==
*Secretary: Enrico Boselli (1998–2008)
**Deputy Secretary: Roberto Villetti (1998–2008), Claudio Martelli (1999–2001), Gian Franco Schietroma (2001–2002)

<text>James Charles Norton (October 20, 1938 – June 12, 2007) was an American professional football safety and punter who played for the Houston Oilers of the American Football League (AFL). An original member of the Oilers franchise, he played in their first nine seasons from 1960 to 1968. Norton was an AFL All-Star for three seasons and holds the league&#x27;s record for career interceptions. His jersey No. 43 was the first of eight retired by the Oilers/Titans franchise.

==Early years==
Born and raised in Southern California, Norton graduated from Fullerton Union High School in 1956 and played college football for head coach Skip Stahley at Idaho, alongside future pros Jerry Kramer, Wayne Walker, and Jim Prestel in the Pacific Coast Conference. Nicknamed &quot;Flamingo,&quot; Norton played defensive back and tight end, and also punted and returned kicks for the Vandals. Selected in the seventh round of in the 1960 NFL draft (75th overall) by the Detroit Lions and the Dallas Texans in the AFL&#x27;s inaugural draft in 1960, he signed as an original Houston Oiler.

==Professional career==
Although Norton intercepted only one pass in his rookie season in 1960, he went on to become the AFL&#x27;s all-time interception leader. In 1961, his first starting season, he snared nine passes and punted with a 40.7-yard average. In a tight defensive duel in the AFL Championship Game, his four booming punts helped Houston defeat the San Diego Chargers, 10–3, claiming their second AFL championship in as many seasons.

While nursing a slim half-game lead in the Eastern Division in Week 12 of the 1962 AFL season, Norton personally tormented Denver Broncos quarterback Frank Tripucka. He stopped three Bronco drives with interceptions as the Oilers stole a 34–17 victory and a berth in their third straight AFL Championship Game. That thriller for the 1962 AFL crown was the league&#x27;s longest game, a double-overtime contest won by the Dallas Texans, 20–17.
As a defensive back, Norton was a steady tackler with a nose for the football. His play earned him All-AFL honors for 1961, &#x27;62, &#x27;63, and &#x27;67, when he scored the only touchdown of his career, returning an interception 56 yards. His number 43 was the first retired by the Oilers, acknowledging his club-record 45 career interceptions, which he returned for 592 yards and a touchdown, and 519 punts. The Oilers/Titans later retired the numbers of Elvin Bethea, Earl Campbell, Mike Munchak, Bruce Matthews, Warren Moon, Steve McNair, and Eddie George.

<doc id="788723" wikidata="Q210384" url="?curid=788723" title="British Aerospace Sea Harrier">
<text>The British Aerospace Sea Harrier is a naval short take-off and vertical landing/vertical take-off and landing jet fighter, reconnaissance and attack aircraft. It is the second member of the Harrier family developed. It first entered service with the Royal Navy in April 1980 as the Sea Harrier FRS1 and became informally known as the &quot;Shar&quot;. Unusual in an era in which most naval and land-based air superiority fighters were large and supersonic, the principal role of the subsonic Sea Harrier was to provide air defence for Royal Navy task groups centred around the aircraft carriers.

The Sea Harrier served in the Falklands War and the Balkans conflicts; on all occasions it mainly operated from aircraft carriers positioned within the conflict zone. Its usage in the Falklands War was its most high profile and important success, when it was the only fixed-wing fighter available to protect the British Task Force. The Sea Harriers shot down 20 enemy aircraft during the conflict; 2 Sea Harriers were lost to enemy ground fire. They were also used to launch ground attacks in the same manner as the Harriers operated by the Royal Air Force.

The Sea Harrier was marketed for sales abroad, but India was the only other operator after attempts to sell the aircraft to Argentina and Australia were unsuccessful. A second, updated version for the Royal Navy was made in 1993 as the Sea Harrier FA2, improving its air-to-air abilities and weapons compatibilities, along with a more powerful engine; this version was manufactured until 1998. The aircraft was withdrawn from service early by the Royal Navy in 2006, but remained in service with the Indian Navy for a further decade until its retirement in 2016.

==Development==


In the post-World War II era, the Royal Navy began contracting in size. By 1960, the last battleship, , was retired from the Navy, having been in service for less than fifteen years. In 1966 the planned CVA-01 class of large aircraft carriers was cancelled. During this time, requirements within the Royal Navy began to form for a vertical and/or short take-off and landing (V/STOL) carrier-based interceptor to replace the de Havilland Sea Vixen. The first V/STOL tests on a ship began with a Hawker Siddeley P.1127 landing on in 1963.

A second concept for the future of naval aviation emerged in the early 1970s when the first of a new class of &quot;through deck cruisers&quot; was planned. These were very carefully and politically designated as cruisers, deliberately avoiding the term &quot;aircraft carrier&quot; to increase the chances of funding in a political climate hostile to expensive capital ships. The resulting carriers were considerably smaller than the CVA-01 design, but came to be widely recognised as aircraft carriers. Almost immediately upon their construction, a ski-jump was added to the end of the 170-metre deck, enabling the carriers to effectively operate a small number of V/STOL jets.

The naval staff were able to build an effective political argument for acquiring V/STOL aircraft on the grounds that anti-submarine groups operating in the NATO Atlantic area, the intended main role of the through-deck cruisers, would be vulnerable to attack by Soviet anti-ship missiles. These could be launched at a considerable distance by a submarine or surface ship but needed to be guided in by a maritime patrol aircraft; fast jets carried onboard would be able to shoot these down. No mention was made of the other capabilities that these aircraft would have.

The Royal Air Force&#x27;s Hawker Siddeley Harrier GR1s had entered service in April 1969. A navalized variant of the Harrier was developed by Hawker Siddeley to serve on the upcoming ships; this became the Sea Harrier. In 1975, the Royal Navy ordered 24 Sea Harrier &quot;FRS.1&quot; (standing for &#x27;Fighter, Reconnaissance, Strike&#x27;) aircraft, the first of which entered service in 1978. During this time, Hawker Siddeley became part of British Aerospace through nationalisation in 1977. By the time the prototype Sea Harrier was flown at Dunsfold on 20 August 1978, the order had been increased to 34. The Sea Harrier was declared operational in 1981 on board the first &quot;Invincible&quot;-class ship , and further aircraft joined the ageing aircraft carrier later that year.

In 1984, approval was given to upgrade of the fleet to &quot;FRS.2&quot; standard (later known as &quot;FA2&quot;) following the lessons learned during the aircraft&#x27;s deployment in the 1982 Falklands War. The first flight of the prototype took place in September 1988 and a contract was signed for 29 upgraded aircraft in December that year. In 1990, the Navy ordered 18 new-build FA2s at a unit cost of around £12 million, four further upgraded aircraft were ordered in 1994. The first aircraft was delivered on 2 April 1993.

==Design==


The Sea Harrier is a subsonic aircraft designed for strike, reconnaissance and fighter roles. It features a single Rolls-Royce Pegasus turbofan engine with two intakes and four vectorable nozzles. It has two landing gear on the fuselage and two outrigger landing gears on the wings. The Sea Harrier is equipped with four wing and three fuselage pylons for carrying weapons and external fuel tanks. The use of the ski jump allowed the aircraft to take off from a short flight deck with a heavier payload than would otherwise be possible, although it can also take off like a conventional loaded fighter without thrust vectoring from a normal airport runway.

The Sea Harrier was largely based on the Harrier GR3, but was modified to have a raised cockpit with a &quot;bubble&quot; canopy for greater visibility and an extended forward fuselage to accommodate the Ferranti Blue Fox radar. Parts were changed to use corrosion resistant alloys, or coatings were added, to protect against the marine environment. After the Falklands War, the Sea Harrier was fitted with the Sea Eagle anti-ship missile.

The Blue Fox radar was seen by some critics as having comparatively low performance for what was available at the time of procurement. The Sea Harrier FA2 was fitted with the Blue Vixen radar, which was described as one of the most advanced pulse doppler radar systems in the world. The Blue Vixen formed the basis of the Eurofighter Typhoon&#x27;s CAPTOR radar. The Sea Harrier FA2 carried the AIM-120 AMRAAM missile, the first UK aircraft with this capability. An upgraded model of the Pegasus engine, the Pegasus Mk 106, was used in the Sea Harrier FA2. In response to the threat of radar-based anti-aircraft weapons electronic countermeasures were added. Other improvements included an increased air-to-air weapons load, look-down radar, increased range, and improved cockpit displays.

The Sea Harrier&#x27;s cockpit includes a conventional centre stick arrangement and left-hand throttle. In addition to normal flight controls, the Harrier has a lever for controlling the direction of the four vectorable nozzles. The nozzles point rearward with the lever in the forward position for horizontal flight. With the lever back, the nozzles point downward for vertical takeoff or landing. The utility of the vertical landing capability of the Sea Harrier was demonstrated in an incident on 6 June 1983, when Sub Lieutenant Ian Watson lost contact with the aircraft carrier and had to land Sea Harrier ZA176 on the foredeck of the Spanish cargo ship &quot;Alraigo&quot;.

In 1998, the UK Defence Evaluation and Research Agency test-fitted an FA2 with AVPRO UK Ltd&#x27;s Exint pods, small underwing compartments intended to be used for deployment of special forces.

In 2005, a Sea Harrier was modified with an &#x27;Autoland&#x27; system to allow the fighter to perform a safe vertical landing without any pilot interaction. Despite the pitching of a ship posing a natural problem, the system was designed to be aware of such data, and successfully performed a landing at sea in May 2005.

==Operational history==
===Royal Navy===
====Entry into service====
The first three Sea Harriers were a development batch and were used for clearance trials. The first production aircraft was delivered to RNAS Yeovilton in 1979 to form an Intensive Flying Trials Unit, 700A Naval Air Squadron. In March 1980, the Intensive Flying Trials Unit became 899 Naval Air Squadron and would act as the landborne headquarters unit for the type. The first operational squadron, 800 Naval Air Squadron, was also formed in March 1980, initially to operate from HMS &quot;Invincible&quot; before it transferred to HMS &quot;Hermes&quot;. In January 1981, a second operational squadron 801 Naval Air Squadron was formed to operate from HMS &quot;Invincible&quot;.

====Falklands War====
Sea Harriers took part in the Falklands War () of 1982, flying from HMS &quot;Invincible&quot; and HMS &quot;Hermes&quot;. The Sea Harriers performed the primary air defence role with a secondary role of ground attack; the RAF Harrier GR3 provided the main ground attack force. A total of 28 Sea Harriers and 14 Harrier GR3s were deployed in the theatre. The Sea Harrier squadrons shot down 20 Argentine aircraft in air-to-air combat with no air-to-air losses, although two Sea Harriers were lost to ground fire and four to accidents. Out of the total Argentine air losses, 28% were shot down by Harriers. One Sea Harrier alone, flown by RAF Flight Lieutenant David Morgan, shot down two Skyhawks in a single encounter.

A number of factors contributed to the failure of the Argentinian fighters to shoot down a Sea Harrier. Although the Mirage III and Dagger jets were faster, the Sea Harrier was considerably more manoeuvrable. Moreover, the Harrier employed the latest AIM-9L Sidewinder missiles and the Blue Fox radar. Contrary to contemporary reports that &quot;viffing&quot; proved decisive in dogfights, the maneuver was not used by RN pilots in the Falklands as it was only used in emergencies against enemies unfamiliar with the aircraft. The British pilots noticed Argentinian pilots occasionally releasing weapons outside of their operating parameters. This is now thought to have been Mirages (IAI Neshers) releasing external fuel tanks to improve their maneuverability for air combat.

British aircraft received fighter control from warships in San Carlos Water, although its effectiveness was limited by their being stationed close to the islands, which severely limited the effectiveness of their radar. The differences in tactics and training between 800 Squadron and 801 Squadron have been a point of criticism, suggesting that the losses of several ships were preventable had Sea Harriers from &quot;Hermes&quot; been used more effectively.

Both sides&#x27; aircraft were operating in adverse conditions. Argentine aircraft were forced to operate from the mainland because airfields on the Falklands were only suited for propeller-driven aircraft. The bombing of Port Stanley airport by a British Vulcan bomber was also a consideration in the Argentinians&#x27; decision to operate them from afar. As most Argentine aircraft lacked in-flight refuelling capability, they were forced to operate at the limit of their range. The Sea Harriers also had limited fuel reserves due to the tactical decision to station the British carriers out of Exocet missile range and the dispersal of the fleet. The result was that an Argentine aircraft only had five minutes over the islands to search for and attack an objective, while a Sea Harrier could stay near to 30 minutes waiting in the Argentine approach corridors and provide Combat Air Patrol coverage for up to an hour.

The Sea Harriers were outnumbered by the available Argentinian aircraft and were, on occasion, deterred by the activities of the &quot;Escuadrón Fénix&quot; or civilian jet aircraft used by the Argentine Air Force. They had to operate without a fleet airborne early warning and control (AEW&amp;C) system that would have been available to a full NATO fleet in which the Royal Navy had expected to operate, which was a significant weakness in the operational environment. It is now known that British units based in Chile did provide early radar warning to the Task Force. Nonetheless, the lack of AEW&amp;C cover resulted in air superiority as opposed to air supremacy; the Sea Harriers could not prevent Argentine attacks during day or night nor could they completely stop the daily C-130 Hercules transports&#x27; night flights to the islands.

====Operations in the 1990s====
The Sea Harrier saw action in war again when it was deployed in the 1992–1995 Bosnian War. It launched raids on Serb forces and provided air-support for the international taskforce units conducting Operations Deny Flight and Deliberate Force against the Army of Republika Srpska. On 16 April 1994, a Sea Harrier of the 801 Naval Air Squadron, operating from the aircraft carrier HMS &quot;Ark Royal&quot;, was brought down by an Igla-1 surface-to-air missile fired by the Army of Republika Srpska while attempting to bomb two Bosnian Serb tanks. The pilot, Lieutenant Nick Richardson, ejected and landed in territory controlled by friendly Bosnian Muslims.

It was used again in the 1999 NATO campaign against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia in Operation Allied Force, where Sea Harriers operating from &quot;Invincible&quot; frequently patrolled the airspace to keep Yugoslavian MiGs on the ground. They were also deployed on board &quot;Illustrious&quot; in 2000 as part of Operation Palliser, the British intervention in Sierra Leone.

====Retirement====
The UK is procuring the STOVL F-35B to be operated from the Royal Navy&#x27;s s.

The Sea Harrier was withdrawn from service in 2006 and the last remaining aircraft from 801 Naval Air Squadron were decommissioned on 29 March 2006. The MoD argued that significant expenditure would be required to upgrade the fleet for only six years of service to meet the F-35s then planned in-service date.

Both versions of Harrier experienced reduced engine performance (Pegasus Mk 106 in FA2 and Mk 105 in GR7) in the higher ambient temperatures of the Middle East, which restricted the weight of payload that the Harrier could return to the carrier in &#x27;vertical&#x27; recoveries. This was due to the safety factors associated with aircraft landing weights. The option to install higher-rated Pegasus engines would not have been as straightforward as on the Harrier GR7 upgrade and would have likely been an expensive and slow process. Furthermore, the Sea Harriers were subject to a generally more hostile environment than land-based Harriers, with corrosive salt spray a particular problem. A number of aircraft were retained by the School of Flight Deck Operations at RNAS &quot;Culdrose&quot;.

The Royal Navy&#x27;s Fleet Air Arm would continue to share the other component of Joint Force Harrier. Harrier GR7 and the upgraded Harrier GR9 were transferred to Royal Navy squadrons in 2006, but were retired in 2010 due to budget cuts.

Although withdrawn from active Royal Navy service, Sea Harriers are used to train naval aircraft handlers at the Royal Navy School of Flight Deck Operations.

===Indian Navy===
In 1977, the Indian government approved plans to acquire the Sea Harrier for the Indian Navy. In November 1979, India placed its first order for six Sea Harrier FRS Mk 51 fighters and two T Mk 60 Trainers; the first three Sea Harriers arrived at Dabolim Airport on 16 December 1983, and were inducted the same year. Ten more Sea Harriers were purchased in November 1985; eventually a total of 30 Harriers were procured, 25 for operational use and the remainder as dual-seat trainer aircraft. Until the 1990s, significant portions of pilot training was carried out in Britain due to limited aircraft availability.

The introduction of the Sea Harrier allowed for the retirement of India&#x27;s previous carrier fighter aircraft, the Hawker Sea Hawk, as well as for the Navy&#x27;s aircraft carrier, , to be extensively modernised between 1987 and 1989. India has operated Sea Harriers from both the aircraft carriers INS &quot;Vikrant&quot; and INS &quot;Viraat&quot;. The Sea Harrier allowed several modern missiles to be introduced into naval operations, such as the Sea Eagle anti-ship missile, and the Matra Magic air-to-air missile. Other ordnance has included 68 mm rockets, runway-denial bombs, cluster bombs, and podded 30 mm cannons.

There have been a significant number of accidents involving the Sea Harrier; this accident rate has caused approximately half the fleet to be lost with only 11 fighters remaining in service. Following a crash in August 2009, all Sea Harriers were temporarily grounded for inspection. Since the beginning of operational service in the Indian Navy, seven pilots have died in 17 crashes involving the Sea Harrier, usually during routine sorties.
In 2006, the Indian Navy expressed interest in acquiring up to eight of the Royal Navy&#x27;s recently retired Sea Harrier FA2s in order to maintain their operational Sea Harrier fleet. Neither the Sea Harrier FA2&#x27;s Blue Vixen radar, the radar warning receiver or AMRAAM capability would have been included; certain US software would also be uninstalled prior to shipment. By October 2006, reports emerged that the deal had not materialised due to the cost of airframe refurbishment.

In 2006, the Indian Navy started upgrading up to 15 Sea Harriers, installing the Elta EL/M-2032 radar and the Rafael &#x27;Derby&#x27; medium-range air-to-air BVR missile. This enabled the Sea Harrier to remain in Indian service beyond 2012. By 2009, crashes had reduced India&#x27;s fleet to 12 (from original 30).

India purchased the deactivated Russian aircraft carrier Admiral &quot;Gorshkov&quot; in 2004. After refurbishment and trials, the ship was formally inducted into the Indian Navy as INS &quot;Vikramaditya&quot; in June 2014. Sea Harriers operated from INS &quot;Viraat&quot; for the last time on 6 March 2016.

On 11 May 2016, a ceremony was held at INS Hansa, Dabolim, Goa to commemorate the phasing out of Sea Harriers from INAS 300 &quot;White Tigers&quot; and their replacement by the MiG-29K/KUB fighters. Aircraft of both types performed an air display at the ceremony, marking the final flight of the Sea Harriers after 33 years of service in the Indian Navy. The Indian Navy operates MiG-29K/KUB STOBAR fighters from &quot;Vikramaditya&quot;.

==Variants==

;Sea Harrier FRS.1
: 57 FRS1s were delivered between 1978 and 1988; most survivors converted to Sea Harrier FA2 specifications from 1988.
;Sea Harrier FRS.51
: Single-seat fighter, reconnaissance, and attack aircraft made for the Indian Navy, similar to the British FRS1. Unlike the FRS1 Sea Harrier, it is fitted with Matra R550 Magic air-to-air missiles. These aircraft were later upgraded with the Elta EL/M-2032 radar and the Rafael Derby BVRAAM missiles.

;Sea Harrier F(A).2
: Upgrade of FRS1 fleet in 1988, featuring the Blue Vixen pulse-doppler radar and the AIM-120 AMRAAM missile.

<doc id="788725" wikidata="Q2051219" url="?curid=788725" title="Parabolic trough">
<text>A parabolic trough collector (PTC) is a type of solar thermal collector that is straight in one dimension and curved as a parabola in the other two, lined with a polished metal mirror. The sunlight which enters the mirror parallel to its plane of symmetry is focused along the focal line, where objects are positioned that are intended to be heated. In a solar cooker, for example, food is placed at the focal line of a trough, which is cooked when the trough is aimed so the Sun is in its plane of symmetry.

For other purposes, a tube containing a fluid runs the length of the trough at its focal line. The sunlight is concentrated on the tube and the fluid heated to a high temperature by the energy of the sunlight. The hot fluid can be piped to a heat engine (e.g. ORC or water/steam Rankine cycle), which uses the heat energy to drive machinery, or to generate electricity. This solar energy collector is the most common and best known type of parabolic trough.

When heat transfer fluid is used to heat steam to drive a standard turbine generator, thermal efficiency ranges from 50 to 80%. The overall efficiency from collector to grid, i.e. (electrical output power)/(total impinging solar power) is about 15%, similar to photovoltaic cells but less than Stirling dish concentrators. Large-scale solar thermal power plants need a method for storing the energy, such as a thermocline tank, which uses a mixture of silica sand and quartzite rock to displace a significant portion of the volume in the tank. It is then filled with the heat transfer fluid, typically a molten nitrate salt.

As of 2014, the largest solar thermal power systems using parabolic trough technology include the 354 MW SEGS plants in California, the 280 MW Solana Generating Station with molten salt heat storage, the 250 MW Genesis Solar Energy Project, the Spanish 200 MW Solaben Solar Power Station, and the Andasol 1 solar power station.

== Efficiency ==

The trough is usually aligned on a north–south axis, and rotated to track the sun as it moves across the sky each day. Alternatively, the trough can be aligned on an east–west axis; this reduces the overall efficiency of the collector due to the sunlight striking the collectors at an angle but only requires the trough to be aligned with the change in seasons, avoiding the need for tracking motors. This tracking method approaches theoretical efficiencies at the spring and fall equinoxes with less accurate focusing of the light at other times during the year. The daily motion of the sun across the sky also introduces errors, greatest at the sunrise and sunset and smallest at noon. Due to these sources of error, seasonally adjusted parabolic troughs are generally designed with a lower concentration acceptance product.

Parabolic trough concentrators have a simple geometry, but their concentration is about 1/3 of the theoretical maximum for the same acceptance angle, that is, for the same overall tolerances of the system to all kinds of errors, including those referenced above. The theoretical maximum is better achieved with more elaborate concentrators based on primary-secondary designs using nonimaging optics which may nearly double the concentration of conventional parabolic troughs and are used to improve practical designs such as those with fixed receivers.

Heat transfer fluid (usually thermal oil) runs through the tube to absorb the concentrated sunlight. This increases the temperature of the fluid to some 400 °C. The heat transfer fluid is then used to heat steam in a standard turbine generator. The process is economical and, for heating the pipe, thermal efficiency ranges from 60 to 80%.
The overall efficiency from collector to grid, i.e. (Electrical Output Power)/(Total Impinging Solar Power) is about 15%, similar to PV (Photovoltaic Cells) but less than Stirling dish concentrators.

== Design ==

A parabolic trough is made of a number of solar collector modules (SCM) fixed together to move as one solar collector assembly (SCA). A SCM could have a length up to or more. About a dozen or more of SCM make each SCA up to length. Each SCA is an independently-tracking parabolic trough.

A SCM may be made as a single-piece parabolic mirror or assembled with a number of smaller mirrors in parallel rows. Smaller modular mirrors require smaller machines to build the mirror, reducing cost. Cost is also reduced in case of the need of replacing a damaged mirror. Such damage may occur due to being hit by an object during bad weather.

In addition, V-type troughs exist which are made from 2 mirrors and placed at an angle towards each other.

In 2009, scientists at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) and SkyFuel teamed to develop large curved sheets of metal that have the potential to be 30% less expensive than today&#x27;s best collectors of concentrated solar power by replacing glass-based models with a silver polymer sheet that has the same performance as the heavy glass mirrors, but at a much lower cost and weight. It also is much easier to move and install. The glossy film uses several layers of polymers, with an inner layer of pure silver.

As this renewable source of energy is inconsistent by nature, methods for energy storage have been studied, for instance, the single-tank (thermocline) storage technology for large-scale solar thermal power plants. The thermocline tank approach uses a mixture of silica sand and
quartzite rock to displace a significant portion of the volume in the tank. Then it is filled with the heat transfer fluid, typically a molten nitrate salt.

== Enclosed trough ==
The enclosed trough architecture encapsulates the solar thermal system within a greenhouse-like glasshouse. The glasshouse creates a protected environment to withstand the elements that can increase the reliability and efficiency of the solar thermal system.

Lightweight curved solar-reflecting mirrors are suspended within the glasshouse. A single-axis tracking system positions the mirrors to track the sun and focus its light onto a network of stationary steel pipes, also suspended from the glasshouse structure. Steam is generated directly using oil field-quality water, as water flows along the length of the pipes, without heat exchangers or intermediate working fluids.

The steam produced is then fed directly to the field&#x27;s existing steam distribution network, where the steam is continuously injected deep into the oil reservoir. Sheltering the mirrors from the wind allows them to achieve higher temperatures and prevents dust from building up as a result from exposure to humidity. GlassPoint Solar, the company that created the Enclosed Trough design, states its technology can produce heat for EOR for about $5 per million British thermal units in sunny regions, compared to between $10 and $12 for other conventional solar thermal technologies.

Enclosed troughs are currently being used at the Miraah solar facility in Oman. In November 2017, GlassPoint announced a partnership with Aera Energy that would bring parabolic troughs to the South Belridge Oil Field, near Bakersfield, California.

== Early commercial adoption ==

In 1897, Frank Shuman, a U.S. inventor, engineer and solar energy pioneer built a small demonstration solar engine that worked by reflecting solar energy onto square boxes filled with ether, which has a lower boiling point than water, and were fitted internally with black pipes which in turn powered a steam engine. In 1908 Shuman formed the Sun Power Company with the intent of building larger solar power plants. He, along with his technical advisor A. S. E. Ackermann and British physicist Sir Charles Vernon Boys, developed an improved system using mirrors to reflect solar energy upon collector boxes, increasing heating capacity to the extent that water could now be used instead of ether. Shuman then constructed a full-scale steam engine powered by low-pressure water, enabling him to patent the entire solar engine system by 1912.

Shuman built the world&#x27;s first solar thermal power station in Maadi, Egypt between 1912 and 1913. Shuman&#x27;s plant used parabolic troughs to power a 45–52 kilowatt (60–70 hp) engine that pumped more than 22,000 litres of water per minute from the Nile River to adjacent cotton fields. Although the outbreak of World War I and the discovery of cheap oil in the 1930s discouraged the advancement of solar energy, Shuman&#x27;s vision and basic design were resurrected in the 1970s with a new wave of interest in solar thermal energy. In 1916 Shuman was quoted in the media advocating solar energy&#x27;s utilization, saying:

== Commercial plants ==


Commercial plants using parabolic troughs may use thermal storage at night while some are hybrids and support natural gas as a secondary fuel source. In the United States the amount of fossil fuel used in order for the plant to qualify as a renewable energy source is limited to a maximum 27% of electricity production. 
Because they include cooling stations, condensers, accumulators and other things besides the actual solar collectors, the power generated per square meter of area varies enormously.

As of 2014, the largest solar thermal power systems using parabolic trough technology include the 354 MW SEGS plants in California, the 280 MW Solana Generating Station with molten salt heat storage, the 250 MW Genesis Solar Energy Project, the Spanish 200 MW Solaben Solar Power Station, and the Andasol 1 solar power station.

<doc id="788731" wikidata="Q6858492" url="?curid=788731" title="Millar v Taylor">
<text>Millar v Taylor (1769) 4 Burr. 2303, 98 ER 201 is an English court decision that held there is a perpetual common law copyright and that no works ever enter the public domain. It represented a major victory for the bookseller monopolies.

==Facts==
Andrew Millar was a bookseller who in 1729, had purchased the publishing rights to James Thomson&#x27;s poem &quot;The Seasons&quot;. After the term of the exclusive rights granted under the Statute of Anne expired, Robert Taylor began publishing his own competing publication, which contained Thomson&#x27;s poem.

Following the creation of the first statutory copyright law in 1710 (via the Statute of Anne), as rights belonging to an author (rather than to printers or publishers), the lapse of the Licensing Act 1662 in 1695 and Parliament&#x27;s refusal to renew the licensing regime (1695), the practice of the English publishing oligopoly had not changed much. Though the purpose of the new law was to break up the monopolies that had been created by the English Crown – which had served, in part, as a basis for the previous English Civil War – there had been relatively little success in weakening the hold of the Stationers&#x27; Company over the publishing industry. Despite the Statute of Anne&#x27;s changes to the statutory law, some publishers continued to claim perpetual publishing rights under common law. Starting in the 1740s, London booksellers presented that argument in a series of court cases, after they had failed to convince Parliament to extend the statutory term of copyright.

==Judgment==
The Court of the King&#x27;s Bench, led by Lord Mansfield (with Aston and Willes JJ concurring in judgment, Sir Joseph Yates dissenting), sided with the publishers, finding that common law rights were not extinguished by the Statute of Anne. Under Mansfield&#x27;s ruling, the publishers had a perpetual common law right to publish a work for which they had acquired the rights. Thus, no amount of time would cause the work to pass to the public. The ruling essentially found that some works would have a perpetual term of copyright, by holding that when the statutory rights granted by the statute expired, the publisher was still left with common law rights to the work. Although this would greatly extend the control of the rights holder this would not extinguish the public domain since there would still be works unaffected by the ruling, and the public domain extends to unprotected elements in protected works. Millar died shortly after the ruling, and it was never appealed.

As an English court, however, the court&#x27;s decision did not extend to Scotland, where a reprint industry continued to thrive. The existence of a common-law copyright, however, was later rejected by a Scottish court in &quot;Hinton v Donaldson&quot;. Perpetual copyright was ultimately resolved against the London publishing monopolies in the landmark case of &quot;Donaldson v Beckett&quot;. Despite being overturned, the case of &quot;Millar v Taylor&quot; remains an important case in the development and history of copyright law.

<doc id="788738" wikidata="Q2341456" url="?curid=788738" title="Newlands Resolution">
<text>The Newlands Resolution, , was a joint resolution passed on July 7, 1898, by the United States Congress to annex the independent Republic of Hawaii. In 1900, Congress created the Territory of Hawaii.

The resolution was drafted by Representative Francis G. Newlands of Nevada, a Democrat. Annexation was a highly controversial political issue, along with the similar issue of the acquisition of the Philippines in 1898.

==Passage==
In 1897, US President William McKinley signed a treaty of annexation for the Republic of Hawaii which lacked two-thirds support in the Senate, and thus never went into effect. In April 1898, the United States went to war with Spain. The Republic of Hawaii decided not to support the war effort and declared its neutrality. However, according to Ralph S. Kuykendall, &quot;The Hawaiian government threw aside its neutrality and did all it could to aid the Americans...Honolulu became a mid-ocean stopover for the United States troops that were sent across the Pacific to follow up Dewey&#x27;s victory. The American soldiers were enthusiastically welcomed and given a taste of Hawaiian hospitality.&quot; This demonstrated Hawaii&#x27;s value as a naval base in wartime, and the American colony on Hawaii won widespread American approval for its help. With the opposition weakened by this strategic importance, Hawaii was annexed through the Newlands Resolution, a joint resolution of Congress with executive assent, which required only a majority vote in both houses. Although the resolution was authored by a Democrat, most of its support came from Republicans. It passed the house by a vote of 209 to 91, with 182 of the votes in favor from Republicans. In the event, it passed the Senate by 42–21, with exactly two-thirds in favor. It was approved on July 4, 1898, and signed on July 7 by President McKinley. Queen Liliʻuokalani sent a letter of protest to the U.S. House of Representatives in attempt to return control of her homeland to native Hawaiians, stating her throne had been taken illegally. On August 12, 1898, a ceremony was held on the steps of ʻIolani Palace to signify the official transfer of Hawaiian state sovereignty to the United States. None of the former Hawaiian leadership attended.

This account illustrates the popular response to the ceremony: &quot;An event of this magnitude would ordinarily call for gala celebrations that night. However, there were no celebrations as there was too much sadness, too much bitterness and resentment prevalent in the atmosphere and the authorities were afraid of riots by the unhappy frustrated Hawaiians.&quot; 

The resolution established a five-member commission to study the laws that were needed in Hawaii. The commission included Territorial Governor Sanford B. Dole (R-Hawaii Territory), Senators Shelby M. Cullom (R-IL) and John T. Morgan (D-AL), Representative Robert R. Hitt (R-IL) and former Hawaii Chief Justice and later Territorial Governor Walter F. Frear (R-Hawaii Territory). The commission&#x27;s final report was submitted to Congress, resulting in a debate that lasted over a year. Congress raised objections that establishing an elected territorial government in Hawaii would lead to the admission of a state with a non-white majority. Annexation allowed duty-free trade between the islands and the mainland, although this had mostly already been accomplished through a reciprocity trade agreement King David Kalakaua had made with the U.S. in 1875, which had also given the U.S. Navy a long term lease of Pearl Harbor as a naval base.

The creation of the Territory of Hawaii was the final step in a long history of dwindling Hawaiian sovereignty, and divided the local population. The annexation was opposed among the Polynesian population, and occurred without a referendum of any kind. Between September 11 and October 2, 1897, the Hui Aloha &#x27;Aina and Hui Kulai&#x27;aina groups organised a mass petition drive that obtained 21,269 signatures on the &quot;Petition Against Annexation&quot;—more than half of the 39,000 native Hawaiians. The Hawaiian sovereignty movement still disputes the legality of the acquisition of Hawaii under the United States Constitution. However, the U.S. Supreme Court gave tacit recognition to the legitimacy of Hawaii&#x27;s annexation in DeLima v. Bidwell, 182 U.S. 1, 196 (1901).

==Cost==
The United States assumed $4 million in Hawaiian debt as part of the annexation. David R. Barker of the University of Iowa stated in 2009 that unlike the Alaska Purchase, Hawaii has been profitable for the country, with net tax revenue almost always exceeding non-defense spending. He estimated an internal rate of return for the annexation of more than 15%.

==Popular controversy==

Multiple viewpoints in the United States and in Hawaii were raised for and against annexation from 1893 to 1898.
Historian Henry Graff wrote that at first, &quot;Public opinion at home seemed to indicate acquiescence... Unmistakably, the sentiment at home was maturing with immense force for the United States to join the great powers of the world in a quest for overseas colonies.&quot;

President Grover Cleveland, on taking office in March 1893, rescinded the annexation proposal. His biographer Alyn Brodsky argued that it was a deeply personal conviction on Cleveland&#x27;s part against immoral action against the little kingdom:
:Just as he stood up for the Samoan Islands against Germany because he opposed the conquest of a lesser state by a greater one, so did he stand up for the Hawaiian Islands against his own nation. He could have let the annexation of Hawaii move inexorably to its inevitable culmination. But he opted for confrontation, which he hated, as it was to him the only way a weak and defenseless people might retain their independence. It was not the idea of annexation that Grover Cleveland opposed, but the idea of annexation as a pretext for illicit territorial acquisition.

Cleveland had to mobilize support from Southern Democrats to fight the treaty. He sent former Georgia Representative James H. Blount as a special representative to Hawaii to investigate and to provide a solution. Blount was well known for his opposition to imperialism. Blount was also a leading advocate for white supremacy, which effectively ended the right to vote for southern Blacks in the 1890s. Some observers had speculated that he would support annexation on the grounds of the inability of Asiatics to govern themselves. Instead, Blount opposed imperialism, called for the US military to restore Queen Liliuokalani, and argued that the Hawaii natives should be allowed to continue their &quot;Asiatic ways.&quot;

Blount seemingly was unaware of the written policy set for Hawaii in Cleveland&#x27;s first term by his Secretary of State Thomas F. Bayard for Hawaii. Bayard sent written instructions to the American minister George W. Merrill that in the event of another revolution in Hawaii, it was a priority to protect American commerce, lives, and property. Bayard specified that &quot;the assistance of the officers of our Government vessels, if found necessary, will therefore be promptly afforded to promote the reign of law and respect for orderly government in Hawaii.&quot; In July 1889, during a small-scale rebellion, Merrill landed Marines to protect Americans, an action that the State Department explicitly approved. Stevens had read those 1887 instructions and followed them in 1893.

A vigorous nationwide anti-expansionist movement, organized as the American Anti-Imperialist League, emerged. Prominent anti-imperialists included Carl Schurz, Democratic leader William Jennings Bryan, industrialist Andrew Carnegie, author Mark Twain, sociologist William Graham Sumner, and many prominent intellectuals and politicians who came of age during the Civil War. The anti-imperialists opposed territorial expansion, believing that imperialism violated the fundamental principle that just, republican government derives from &quot;consent of the governed.&quot; The League argued that such activity would necessitate the abandonment of American ideals of self-government and non-intervention that were expressed in the Declaration of Independence, George Washington&#x27;s Farewell Address, and Lincoln&#x27;s Gettysburg Address.

However, they could not stop the even more energetic forces of imperialism, which were led by Secretary of State John Hay, naval strategist Alfred T. Mahan, Republican Senator Henry Cabot Lodge, Secretary of War Elihu Root, and the young politician Theodore Roosevelt. Those expansionists had vigorous support from newspaper publishers William Randolph Hearst and Joseph Pulitzer, who whipped up popular excitement. There was deep concern that Japan would force Hawaii into its colonial empire, which was believed to pose a serious threat to the West Coast. Mahan and Roosevelt designed a global strategy calling for a competitive modern navy, Pacific bases, an isthmian canal through Nicaragua or Panama, and (above all) an assertive role for the United States as the largest industrial power. McKinley&#x27;s position was that Hawaii could never survive on its own but would quickly be gobbled up by Japan, as about a quarter of the islands&#x27; population was already ethnically Japanese, and that this would allow Japan to dominate the Pacific and undermine American hopes for large-scale trade with Asia.

<doc id="788743" wikidata="Q319763" url="?curid=788743" title="Inferiority complex">
<text>In psychology, an inferiority complex is a consistent feeling of inadequacy, often resulting in the belief that one is in some way deficient, or inferior, to others. 

According to Alfred Adler, a feeling of inferiority may be brought about by upbringing as a child (for example, being consistently compared unfavorably to a sibling), physical and mental limitations, or experiences of lower social status (for example, being treated unfavorably by one&#x27;s peers).

An inferiority complex may cause an individual to overcompensate in a number of ways. For example, a person who feels inferior because they are shorter than average (also known as a Napoleon complex) due to common modern day heightism may become overly concerned with how they appear to others. They may wear special shoes to make themself appear taller or surround themselves with individuals who are even shorter than they are. If this is taken to the extreme, it becomes a neurosis.

It may also cause an individual to be prone to flashy outward displays, with behavior ranging from attention-seeking to excessive competitiveness and aggression, in an attempt to compensate for their either real or imagined deficiencies.

== Definition ==
According to the Cambridge Dictionary of Psychology, &quot;[i]n Adlerian psychology, a combination of an erroneous belief of an individual that they are unable to cope with some aspect of life because of a real or imagined physical or psychological deficiency, feelings of depression, and a cessation of coping efforts in that area&quot;. In another sense &quot;A general term for a personal sense of inferiority&quot;.

==History==
The notion of an inferiority complex was introduced into the psychoanalytic branch of psychology by Alfred Adler, founder of classical Adlerian psychology, paralleling what Pierre Janet had called a feeling of incompleteness (&quot;sentiment d’incomplétude&quot;). The idea appears in many of Sigmund Freud&#x27;s works, but has fallen out of favor due to later advances in theory. It was also used on occasion by Freud&#x27;s sometime colleague Carl Jung, (who first employed the term &quot;complex&quot; in general as the denotation for a group of related ideas that conform to a certain pattern). 

Adler considered that many neurotic symptoms could be traced to overcompensation for this feeling of inferiority, as well as such compensatory over-achievements as the oratory of the stammering Demosthenes.

In modern literature, the preferred terminology is &quot;lack of self-esteem&quot;.

==Causes==

An inferiority complex occurs when the feelings of inferiority are intensified in the individual through discouragement or failure. Those who are at risk for developing a complex include people who: show signs of low self-esteem or self-worth or have low status in their peer group. They may also display symptoms similar to depression. Children reared in households where the parents are perceived as having overbearing expectations may also develop an inferiority complex.

According to Adler, &quot;Everyone (...) has a feeling of inferiority. But the feeling of inferiority is not a disease; it is rather a stimulant to healthy, normal striving and development. It becomes a pathological condition only when the sense of inadequacy overwhelms the individual and, far from stimulating them to useful activity, makes them depressed and incapable of development.&quot;

==Classifications==
Classical Adlerian psychology makes a distinction between primary and secondary inferiority feelings.

* A primary inferiority feeling is said to be rooted in the young child&#x27;s original experience of weakness, helplessness and dependency, where there is also a lack of parental acceptance and affection, or an actual constitutional weakness. It can then be intensified by comparisons to siblings, romantic partners, and adults.

* A secondary inferiority feeling relates to an adult&#x27;s experience of being unable to reach a subconscious, reassuring fictional final goal of subjective security and success to compensate for the inferiority feelings. The perceived distance from that reassuring goal would lead to a negative/depressed feeling that could then prompt the recall of the original inferiority feeling; this composite of inferiority feelings, i.e. the original feeling recalled due to the secondary feeling, could be experienced as overwhelming. The reassuring goal invented to relieve the original, primary feeling of inferiority (which actually causes the secondary feeling of inferiority) is the &quot;catch-22&quot; of this dilemma.

==Effects==
When an inferiority complex is in full effect, it may impact the performance of an individual as well as impact an individual&#x27;s self-esteem. Unconscious psychological and emotional processes can inhibit a student&#x27;s ability to receive and understand new information in addition to an excessive guardedness that results from an inability to accept or understand one&#x27;s own subconscious feelings of inferiority. 

In his PhD dissertation, Guy Hutt found that in students who display difficulty with math classes, the subject can become associated with a psychological inferiority complex, low motivation and self-efficacy, poor self-directed learning strategies, and feelings of being unsafe or anxious.

In the mental health treatment population, this complex sometimes overlaps in patients with other disorders such as certain types of schizophrenia, mood disorders, and personality disorders. Alfred Adler identified an inferiority complex as one of the contributing factors to some unhealthy childhood behaviors.

Individuals with increased feelings of inferiority have a higher tendency toward self-concealment, which in turn results in an increase in loneliness and a decrease in happiness.

Inferiority complexes are strongly correlated with neuroticism, a trait from the Big Five personality model. Additionally, inferiority complexes show small, negative relationships with conscientiousness, agreeableness, and extraversion, but are positively related to Machiavellianism and narcissism.

== Superiority complex ==

Related to the inferiority complex is a &quot;superiority complex&quot;, a psychological defense mechanism in which a person&#x27;s outward display of superiority displaces or conceals their feelings of inferiority. Differentiated by Adler from a normal desire for social recognition, the superiority complex results in vulgar displays of self-worth or status, stemming from underlying feelings of inferiority – sometimes judged by observers to appear as a form of imposture.

<text>Kerridge is a village in the civil parish of Bollington, in the Cheshire East district, in the ceremonial county of Cheshire, England. Kerridge borders the neighbouring parish of Rainow.
It gives its name to Kerridge Ridge – one of the western foothills of the Pennines – by which it stands. It is overlooked by the local landmark of White Nancy. The local industries were quarrying and cotton mills, of which remnants remain.

On 29 February 1912, the Macclesfield Canal at Kerridge burst its banks, flooding several nearby streets.

== History ==
Kerridge itself comes from &#x27;key ridge&#x27;, and was known in Old English as &#x27;Gaeg Hrycg&#x27;.

Kerridge became a civil parish in 1894, being formed from the rural part of Bollington, On 30 September 1900 the parish was abolished and merged with Bollington.

<text>[[Ghana]] is a country of 33.48 million people and many native groups, such as:

* The Akans in the center and South of the country,
* The Ga and Adangbe in, around, and East of Accra,
* The Guan people in the rainforest,
* The Dagombas, Mamprusi, and related peoples in the North,
* The Gurunsi languages speaking peoples in the far North,
* The Gonjas in the Northern Region.

English is the official language, with the indigenous Twi of the Ashantis, the Fante language, Frafra, Dangme, Ga, Dagbani, Mampruli, Gonja, and Ewe also having official status, and being taught in schools as indigenous (local) languages in the respective areas where they are predominant.

==People==
=== Akans ===

The Akan people primarily live in Ghana, parts of Ivory Coast, and Togo. They are one of the few ⠀⠀matrilineal⠀⠀ societies in West Africa. The Akan matrilineal system continues to be economically and politically important. Each lineage controlled the land farmed by its members, functioned as a religious unit in the veneration of its ancestors, supervised marriages, and settled internal disputes among its members.

Once renowned for their splendor and wealth, the Akan kings retained dignitary status after colonization. Celebration of the Akan kings lives on in the tradition of the Golden Stool. The Akan are noted for their expertise in several forms of craftwork, particularly their weaving, wood carving, ceramics, fertility dolls, metallurgy, and kente cloth). Traditional &quot;kente&quot; cloth is woven outdoors, exclusively by men, in complex patterns of bright, narrow strips. The manufacturing of many Akan crafts is restricted to male specialists. Pottery-making is the only craft that is primarily a female activity; men usually fashion pots or pipes depicting anthropomorphic or zoomorphic figures.

The various Akan groups speak various dialects of the Akan language, a language rich in proverbs, the use of proverbs is considered a sign of wisdom. Euphemisms are also very common, especially concerning events connected with death.

The coastal Akans were the first to have relations with Europeans during the &quot;Scramble for Africa&quot;. As a result of this long association, these groups absorbed aspects of British culture and language. For example, it became customary among these peoples to adopt British surnames. The coastal Akans live predominantly in the Central Region and Western Region of Akanland.

===Ga-Adangbe===

The Ga-Adangbe people &quot;or simply&quot; Ga people (named for the common proto-Ga-Adangbe ancestral language) inhabit the Greater Accra Region. The Ga-Adangde have different but common languages, Ga, Krobo, Sh3, Osudoko, Shai, Gbugblaa, and Ada, Ningo to mention a few. The Adangbe inhabit the eastern plain, while the Ga groups occupy the western portions of the Accra coastlands. Both languages are derived from a common root language, and modern Ga and Adangbe languages are still similar today.

Despite the archeological evidence that proto-Ga-Adangbe-speakers relied on millet and yam cultivation, the modern Ga-Adangbe reside in what used to be fishing communities, and more than 75 percent of the Ga-Adangbe live in urban centers. The presence of major industrial, commercial, and governmental institutions in the city and towns, as well as the increasing migration of other people into the area, has not prevented the Ga people from maintaining aspects of their traditional culture, even though Twi is an important immigrant language in their lands.

=== Dagomba ===

The Dagomba speak the Dagbani language and live in the Kingdom of Dagbon. The kingdom is the earliest in Ghana. For centuries, the area inhabited by Dagomba peoples has been the scene of movements of people engaged in conquest, expansion, and north-south and east-west trade. Many terms from Arabic, Hausa, and Dyula are seen in the Dagbani language, due to the importance of trans-saharan trade and West African trade and the historic impact that the Islamic religion has had in the area.

===Ewé===

The Ewe people occupy southeastern Ghana and parts of neighboring Togo and Benin. The Ewe follow a patrilineal structure, meaning that the founder of a community becomes chief and is usually succeeded by his paternal relatives. Ewe religion is organized around a creator or deity, Mawu, and over 600 other deities. The Ewe are more traditionally inclined in terms of religion and belief. Many village celebrations and ceremonies take place in honor of one or more deities.

Coastal Ewe depend on the fishing trade, while inland Ewe are usually farmers and keep livestock. The local variations in economic activities have led to craft specialization. The Ewe also weave kente cloth, often in geometrical patterns and symbolic designs that have been handed down through the ages.

==Role and status of women==

Women in pre-modern society were seen as bearers of children, retailers of fish, and farmers. Traditionally, women&#x27;s childbearing abilities were perceived as a way for lineage ancestors to be reborn. In pre-colonial times, polygamy was encouraged, especially by wealthy men. In patrilineal societies, dowry received from marrying off daughters was traditionally seen as an acknowledgment to parents for raising their daughters well. In the last couple of decades, female gender roles have evolved tremendously. Ghanaian women now account for 43.1% of the working class in Ghana. Females have climbed to the upper leadership echelons of politics, career, business, and all other sectors. Notable political personalities include Joyce Bamford-Addo (Speaker of the 5th Session of the Parliament), Georgina Theodora Wood (Chief Justice) as well as multiple past and current political office holders. 

==Festival==
The Akwasidae Festival (alternate, Akwasiadae) is celebrated by the Ashanti people and chiefs in Ashanti, as well as the Ashanti diaspora. The festival is celebrated on a Sunday, once every six weeks.
The Panafest celebrates roots, and African-Americans with roots from the region, often visit and celebrate their heritage. 
Ashanti Yam Festival
is observed for five days starting with a Tuesday, as dictated by the local chief priest. It marks the first harvest of yams during autumn, after the monsoon season. This festival has both religious and economic significance. Religiously, the festival is used to thank the gods and the ancestors for the new harvest and to traditionally outdoor the new yam.

The Damba festival is celebrated by the people of Dagbon and other ethnic groups in Ghana. During this festival, there is a colorful and vibrant display of the Ghanaian Smock and other traditional dresses.

Also, the Fire festival is celebrated during the first month of the Dagomba lunar calendar. This festival takes place at night and involves fire procession and drumming and dancing to war songs.

When the first yam tubers are harvested, the people of Dagbon mark a ceremony to declare the opening of the yam season.

==Music==

There are three distinct types of music: ethnic or traditional music, normally played during festivals and at funerals; &quot;highlife&quot; music, which is a blend of traditional and ‘imported’ music; and choral music, which is performed in concert halls, churches, schools, and colleges.°

==Dance==
Each ethnic group has its traditional dances, with specific dances for different occasions. Some of these specific dances are meant for funerals, celebrations, storytelling, praise, and worship. There are various dances in Ghana performed by the ten regions across the country, most frequently during festivals and occasions such as funerals, marriage ceremonies, etc. These dances are performed to entertain and educate people. ( e.g. The &#x27;Gome&#x27; dance, as performed by the Gas of the Greater Accra region of Ghana during the Homowo festival in August). Other dances in Ghana include kpalongo performed by the Gas, Agbadza by the Ewes, Adowa by the Akans, Bambaya by the Northeners, Patsa and Dbahsh by the Ga-Adangbes, and many others. Many dances have originated from Ghana and its ethnic groups.

==Customs==
Funerals and libations are poured. African time is practiced. Sexuality is not discussed in Ghana. Being Left handed is frowned upon.

==Superstition==

Black magic belief is strong. Ghanaian churches openly promote the idea that disease and misfortune can be caused by supernatural forces. Superstition is so strong women who are accused of witchcraft are banished to Witch camps.

==Religion==

Ghana is a highly religious country where evangelical prophets are extremely popular.

==Health==
Traditional customs and contemporary medical methods are combined to create Ghana&#x27;s health culture. For a variety of illnesses, many Ghanaians turn to traditional medicine, frequently seeking the aid of herbalists and spiritual healers. This is especially true in rural areas, where there may be limited access to official healthcare facilities. But as the value of contemporary medicine is increasingly acknowledged, more people are using public health services, particularly for infectious diseases like HIV/AIDS and malaria. Although the Ghanaian government has made progress in enhancing healthcare infrastructure and access, issues like a lack of funding, a shortage of medical staff, and disparities in healthcare quality across regions still exist.

===Mental health===

Ghana faces many obstacles when it comes to mental health, one of which is the stigma associated with mental illness, which deters many people from getting treatment. There are few facilities for people in need of mental health services, and they are frequently concentrated in urban areas. Nevertheless, due to local and global advocacy, there is a slow movement to acknowledge mental health as an essential part of overall well-being. To address mental health issues, community involvement, and education are essential because they demystify mental illnesses and foster acceptance. The goal of recent efforts has been to incorporate mental health services into primary healthcare, highlighting the necessity of a more comprehensive approach to health that takes into account both physical and mental well-being.

==Cuisine==

The cuisine has diverse traditional dishes from each ethnic group. Generally, most dishes consist of a starchy portion, and a sauce or soup, with fish, snails, meat, or mushrooms.

==Sport==
Association football is the most popular sport in the country. The national men&#x27;s football team is known as the &quot;Black Stars&quot;, with the under-20 team known as the &quot;Black Satellites&quot;. The under-17 team is known as the &quot;Black Starlets&quot;, while the national men&#x27;s Olympic team is known as the &quot;Black Meteors&quot;. They have participated in many championships including the African Cup of Nations, the FIFA World Cup, and the FIFA U-20 World Cup.

On October 16, 2009, Ghana became the first African nation to win the FIFA U-20 World Cup by defeating Brazil 4-3 in a penalty shootout. On June 13, 2010, Ghana defeated Serbia 1-0 in first-round play in the 2010 FIFA World Cup becoming the first African team to win a FIFA World Cup game hosted on African soil and subsequently became the only African team to progress from the group stage to the knock out phase at the 2010 event. On June 26, 2010, Ghana defeated the US by 2 goals to 1 in their round of 16 matches, becoming the third African country to reach the quarter-final stage of the World Cup after Cameroon in 1990 and Senegal in 2002. A loss to Uruguay in Johannesburg on July 2, 2010, by a penalty shoot-out ended Ghana&#x27;s attempt at reaching the semi-finals of the competition.

While men&#x27;s football is the most widely followed sport in Ghana, the national women&#x27;s football team is gaining exposure, participating in the FIFA Women&#x27;s World Cup and the CAF Women&#x27;s Championship. The Ghana women&#x27;s national football team is known as the &quot;Black Queens&quot;, while the Ghana national women&#x27;s under-20 football team is called the &quot;Black Princesses&quot;.

There are several club football teams in Ghana, which play in the Ghana Premier League and Division One league, both managed by the Ghana Football Association. Notable among these are Accra Hearts of Oak SC and Asante Kotoko, which play at the premier league level and are the dominant contenders in the tournament.

Prominent football players recognized at the international level include Tony Yeboah, Michael Essien, Kevin-Prince Boateng, Emmanuel Agyemang-Badu, Abedi Pele, Asamoah Gyan, Anthony Annan, Quincy Owusu-Abeyie, John Pantsil, Samuel Osei Kuffour, Richard Kingson, Sulley Muntari, Laryea Kingston, Stephen Appiah, André Ayew, John Mensah and Dominic Adiyiah.

Ghana is also the birthplace of World Wrestling Entertainment Wrestler Kofi Kingston (born Kofi Sarkodie-Mensah), who is wrestling on the Smackdown brand. Also is Kwame Nkrumah-Acheampong who competed in the Vancouver Winter Olympics. There have also been quite a few quality boxers produced such as Azumah Nelson a three-time world champion, Nana Yaw Konadu also a three-time world champion, Ike Quartey, as well as boxers Joshua Clottey and IBF bantamweight champion Joseph Agbeko.

<text>Seoul Subway Line 5 of the Seoul Metropolitan Subway, dubbed &quot;the purple line&quot;, is a long line crossing from west to the east across the Seoul National Capital Area, South Korea. It is one of two subway lines in Seoul to cross &quot;under&quot; the Han River (the other being the Suin-Bundang Line), which is done at two points (between Mapo and Yeouinaru, and also between Gwangnaru and Cheonho). The main line runs through to Hanam Geomdansan Station while the branch line from Gangdong Station terminates at Macheon Station. In 2019, Line 5 carried an annual ridership of 334 million or about 915,000 passengers per day.

The total length of this line is . Upon opening, it was among the longest underground railway tunnels of any kind constructed. Today it is the 8th longest continuous underground subway tunnel in the world, just behind Chengdu Metro Line 6, Qingdao Metro Line 1, Guangzhou Metro Line 18, Guangzhou Metro Line 3, Moscow Metro Bolshaya Koltsevaya Line, Beijing Subway Line 10 and Beijing Subway Line 6. Line 5 is also the first subway and passenger railway line in the Korean Peninsula to directly serve an airport, when the line was extended westward to Banghwa via Gimpo International Airport in 1996.

== History ==
The line was built 1990–1996 and is an important east–west link connecting Gimpo Airport, the Yeouido business area, downtown Seoul, and the Gangdong residential districts.

In 1996 Line 5 was implemented with Automatic train operation. However, it was deemed that a driver would be necessary in case of a breakdown of the automation system, therefore each subway train has one driver on board.

It was the world&#x27;s longest underground railway line for 9 years until Guangzhou Metro Line 3 came into operation in 2005.

In December 2010 the line is recorded as having the third highest WiFi data consumption in the Seoul Metropolitan area. It averaged 1.67 times more than the other 14 subway lines fitted with WiFi service zones.

The main branch of the line was extended to the city of Hanam with a total of 5 stations spanning 6.5 km. The extension opened in two stages; the first opened on August 8, 2020, and the other opened on March 27, 2021.

==Tourism==
In January 2013, the Seoul Metropolitan Rapid Transit Corporation, which operated the line at the time, published free guidebooks features eight tours as well as recommendations for accommodations, restaurants and shopping centers. These guidebooks were printed in three languages: English, Japanese and Chinese (simplified and traditional). They were distributed from information centers on this line.

The tours are designed with different themes for travel along the subway lines, e.g. Korean traditional culture. The destinations range from Jongno 3-ga Station to Anguk Station and Gyeongbokgung Station on line No 3 showcasing antique shops and art galleries of Insa-dong.

In the summer of 2013, the Seoul Metropolitan Rapid Transit Corporation to display water parks that are located near stations operated by the Seoul Metropolitan Rapid Transit Corporation on the LCD display screens both inside the train, and on the station platforms.

<text>Silver Apples were an American electronic rock group from New York, active between 1967 and 1970, before reforming in the mid-1990s. It was composed of Simeon (born Simeon Oliver Coxe III, June 4, 1938 – September 8, 2020), who performed on a primitive synthesizer of his own devising; and, until his death in 2005, drummer Danny Taylor. The duo were among the first to employ electronic music techniques outside of academia, applying them to 1960s rock and pop styles.

As part of New York&#x27;s underground music scene, the band released two albums—&quot;Silver Apples&quot; (1968) and &quot;Contact&quot; (1969)—to poor sales. They began recording a third album before a lawsuit by Pan Am, owing to the use of their logo in the artwork of &quot;Contact&quot;, forced the end of the group and its label Kapp in 1970. In the 1990s, German bootleg recordings of the band&#x27;s albums raised their profile, and Simeon reformed the group with other musicians and released new music. In 1998, he reconnected with Taylor, and the two completed their original third LP &quot;The Garden&quot; (1998). After Taylor&#x27;s death, Simeon continued releasing Silver Apples projects using samples of Taylor&#x27;s drumming.

== History ==
=== The 1960s ===
The group formed out of a traditional rock band called The Overland Stage Electric Band, working regularly in the East Village. Simeon was the singer, but began to incorporate a 1940s vintage audio oscillator into the show, which alienated the other band members to the extent that the group was eventually reduced to the duo of Simeon and Taylor, at which point they renamed themselves The Silver Apples, after the William Butler Yeats poem &quot;The Song of Wandering Aengus&quot;. The arsenal of oscillators eventually grew (according to their first LP liner notes) to include &quot;nine audio oscillators piled on top of each other and eighty-six manual controls to control lead, rhythm and bass pulses with hands, feet and elbows&quot;. Simeon devised a system of telegraph keys and pedals to control tonality and chord changes, and reportedly never learned to play traditional piano-styled keyboards or synthesizers.

They were signed to Kapp Records and released their first record, &quot;Silver Apples&quot;, in 1968, and from that released a single, &quot;Oscillations&quot;, a song that Simeon has cited as the first song he had written. On the debut album, seven of the nine songs had lyrics by Stanley Warren (not Warren Stanley as incorrectly credited on the re-release of the 1997 MCA CD), including the group&#x27;s signature song &quot;Oscillations&quot;. Warren, who subsequently became a published poet, met Simeon and Taylor at the Fifth Annual Avant Garde Arts Festival in 1967 in New York City, organized by Charlotte Moorman, who was famous as the &quot;topless cellist&quot;. Soon after, Simeon became acquainted with Warren&#x27;s early work, and set a poem, &quot;MJ&quot;, to music as &quot;Seagreen Serenades&quot;. Inspired by Simeon&#x27;s interest, in the next few months Warren wrote the remaining six songs used on the &quot;Silver Apples&quot; album. Another song, &quot;Gypsy Love&quot;, was used on the Silver Apples&#x27; second album, &quot;Contact&quot;. In latter-day performances, Simeon still played some of his and Warren&#x27;s works from the early days of Silver Apples.

The following year, they released their second LP, &quot;Contact&quot;, and toured the United States. During the time of the recording of their second album, they shared a studio room with Jimi Hendrix. Both of them decided to jam together and recorded their version of the Star Spangled Banner for their special Fourth of July shows. The band had struck a deal with the airline Pan Am to shoot the front photo of the album&#x27;s artwork in an airliner cockpit, in exchange for including the Pan Am logo. However, the backside of the record featured a photograph of a plane crash. This led to a lawsuit and the record was pulled from stores. A third album was recorded in 1970, but Kapp was folded into MCA Records, leaving the album unreleased, and the group defunct. Simeon elaborates on the other reasons for Silver Apples disbanding and the record label&#x27;s demise online.

=== 1990s revival ===
In 1994, the German label TRC released a bootleg CD of both records. In 1996 the British label Enraptured released a tribute album, &quot;Electronic Evocations - A Tribute To The Silver Apples&quot;, featuring American and British space rock revivalist bands including Windy &amp; Carl, Flowchart, the Third Eye Foundation and Amp, among others. The interest provoked by this release prompted Simeon to reform the Silver Apples in 1996. The first two records were re-released as official records from the master tapes, and Simeon began a tour of the United States with a new Silver Apples band featuring Xian Hawkins (alias Sybarite) and Michael Lerner. In the ensuing years the Silver Apples released two albums of new material featuring this line-up: &quot;Decatur&quot; and &quot;Beacon&quot;. Eventually, &quot;after much searching&quot;, Danny Taylor was located, and a handful of reunion shows of the original lineup were performed. Taylor also had the tape of the unreleased third record, &quot;The Garden&quot;, in a box in his attic, and the record was finally released in 1998, featuring completed tracks from the original sessions plus tracks of Taylor&#x27;s drumming from the time mixed with Simeon&#x27;s new additions. On July 5, 1998, Silver Apples played with Damon Albarn and Graham Coxon from Blur at the Meltdown Festival at the London Royal Festival Hall.

In 1998 their tour van was forced off the road by an unknown driver, breaking Simeon&#x27;s neck. Plans for new recordings and further touring by the reunited duo were put on hold. As of 2004, Simeon was much recovered, but he was unable to play his instrument in the way he used to. Following the accident, Silver Apples&#x27; activity diminished. Simeon spent his time making new music, recuperating, and boating on the Gulf of Mexico. Xian Hawkins released four albums of solo material under the name Sybarite. Danny Taylor died on March 10, 2005, in Kingston, New York.

=== 2000s and 2010s concerts and festivals ===

In September 2007 Simeon went on tour for the first time in years, performing as a solo version of the Silver Apples. Silver Apples / Simeon performed at, among others, All Tomorrow&#x27;s Parties (Minehead, UK, December 2007); Electric Picnic, Stradbally, Ireland (September 2008); All Tomorrow&#x27;s Parties, Australia (January 2009), The Unit, Tokyo, (July 2009); Oscillations Music + Arts Festival, Belfast, Northern Ireland (September 2009); Austin Psych Fest 3, TX (April 2010); Albuquerque Experimental, Albuquerque, NM (October 2010), Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou (May 2011), London, England iTunes Festival (July 2011), RecBeat festival, in Recife, Brazil (February 2012) and Incubate, Netherlands (September, 2012), Mountain Oasis Electronic Music Summit, Asheville, NC (October, 2013), Audioscope 14 in Oxford, UK (November 2014). Stereo Glasgow, UK (November 2014)

In October 2011, Simeon performed as Silver-Qluster, a collaboration with Cluster frontman Hans-Joachim Roedelius, in ATP I&#x27;ll Be Your Mirror Festival in Asbury Park, NJ. On the same festival the following day, Simeon was invited onstage by Portishead to perform &quot;We Carry On&quot;, Portishead&#x27;s homage to Silver Apples.

Simeon toured the UK, Europe and the US in mid to late 2016.
2016 also marked the release of the first new Silver Apples studio album, &quot;Clinging To A Dream&quot;, in 19 years.

Simeon died on September 8, 2020, at the age of 82.

== Legacy and influence ==

Silver Apples are regarded as pioneers of electronic music, electronica, synth-pop, electro and electronic rock for their experimentation with electronic music in a rock/pop context and innovative work in melding psychedelic rock with home-made oscillators and synthesizers. Referring to this, AllMusic&#x27;s Jason Ankeny described them as &quot;a surreal, almost unprecedented duo&quot;.

John Lennon endorsed the group while appearing on a television broadcast in 1968, saying to &quot;[w]atch out for a band called Silver Apples, they are the next thing.&quot; Alan Vega of Suicide listed Silver Apples as one of his core inspirations that led him to form the group in the early 1970s.

Groups and artists influenced by Silver Apples include Radiohead, Portishead, Beck, Moby and Beastie Boys, as well as bands from the first wave of post-rock such as Stereolab, Spiritualized, and Laika. Portishead&#x27;s Geoff Barrow stated that &quot;for people like us, they are the perfect band [...] They should definitely be up there with the pioneers of electronic music&quot;; the band&#x27;s 2008 album &quot;Third&quot; was significantly inspired by their music.

&quot;Lovefingers&quot; was used in the 2024 film &quot;Civil War&quot; from A24 Films.

<text>Éditions Gallimard (), formerly Éditions de la Nouvelle Revue Française (1911–1919) and Librairie Gallimard (1919–1961), is one of the leading French book publishers. In 2003, it and its subsidiaries published 1,418 titles.

Founded by Gaston Gallimard in 1911, the publisher is now majority-owned by his grandson Antoine Gallimard.

Éditions Gallimard is a subsidiary of Groupe Madrigall, the third largest French publishing group.

== History ==
The publisher was founded on 31 May 1911 in Paris by Gaston Gallimard, André Gide, and Jean Schlumberger as &quot;Les Éditions de la Nouvelle Revue Française&quot; (NRF).

From its 31 May 1911 founding until June 1919, Nouvelle Revue Française published one hundred titles including &quot;La Jeune Parque&quot; by Paul Valéry. NRF published the second volume of &quot;In Search of Lost Time&quot;, In the Shadow of Young Girls in Flower, which became the first Prix Goncourt-awarded book published by the company. Nouvelle Revue Française adopted the name &quot;Librairie Gallimard&quot; in 1919.

During the occupation of France in World War II, Gaston Gallimard was hosted in Carcassonne by poet Joë Bousquet. He returned to Paris in October 1940 to enter discussions with the Third Reich authorities, who wished to control his publishing company. It was agreed that Gaston Gallimard would still control his company if he collaborated with the authorities and published pro-Hitler writings.

== Catalogue ==
Éditions Gallimard&#x27;s best-selling authors include Albert Camus (29 million copies), Antoine de Saint-Exupéry (26.3 million copies) and J. K. Rowling (whose &quot;Harry Potter&quot; series sold 26 million copies). Other important authors include Salman Rushdie, Roald Dahl, Marcel Proust, Louis-Ferdinand Céline, Philip Roth, George Orwell, Jack Kerouac, Pablo Neruda and John Steinbeck.

 its catalog consists of 36 Prix Goncourt winners, 38 writers who have received the Nobel Prize in Literature, and ten writers who have been awarded the Pulitzer Prize. In 2010 the company had a turnover of million, and over 1,000 employees.

Gallimard acquired Groupe Flammarion from RCS MediaGroup in 2012.

<text>Eschwege (), the district seat of the Werra-Meißner-Kreis, is a town in northeastern Hesse, Germany. In 1971, the town hosted the eleventh &quot;Hessentag&quot; state festival.

== Geography ==

=== Location ===
The town lies on a broad plain tract of the river Werra at the foot of the Leuchtberg (mountain) northwest of the Schlierbachswald (range) and east of the Hoher Meißner. The valley basin where the town is located includes a series of small lakes along the northern side of the river.
The nearest city in Hesse is Kassel (roughly 52 km to the northwest), and the nearest in Lower Saxony is Göttingen (roughly 55 km to the north). It lies more or less in the geographical centre of Germany.

=== Neighbouring communities ===
Eschwege borders in the north on the town of Bad Sooden-Allendorf and the community of Meinhard, in the east on the town of Wanfried (all three in the Werra-Meißner-Kreis), in the southeast on the town of Treffurt (in Thuringia’s Wartburgkreis), in the south on the communities of Weißenborn and Wehretal, in the west on the community of Meißner, and in the northwest on the community of Berkatal (all four in the Werra-Meißner-Kreis).

=== Constituent communities ===
Eschwege’s &quot;Stadtteile&quot;, besides the main town, also called Eschwege, are Albungen, Eltmannshausen, Niddawitzhausen, Niederdünzebach, Niederhone, Oberdünzebach and Oberhone.

== History ==

In 974, &quot;Eskinivvach&quot; had its first documentary mention. This name stems from an old Germanic language and means “Settlement near the ash trees at the water”. This origin is noteworthy for showing that the town arose before Franks overran the area, which was some time between 500 and 700. As far back as Merovingian times, a Frankish royal court arose here, which kept watch as a border defence over the ford (crossing) on the Werra leading into Thuringia, and which still stood in the 10th and 11th centuries. At this time, Saint Denis was still the foremost saint, having been the Merovingians’ main saint, to whom the church in the Old Town is consecrated.

The first documentary mention is found in a document from Emperor Otto II, in which he bequeathed the royal court and the settlement to his wife Theophanu. Their daughter Sophia founded on the Cyriakusberg about 1000 a canonical foundation for women (in which women did not take vows, but nonetheless lived in a conventlike environment) consecrated to Saint Cyriacus, which existed until the introduction of the Reformation into Hesse in 1527. All that is left of it now, though, is the &quot;Karlsturm&quot; (tower). Market rights were granted about 1188, and town rights followed by 1249. It was in this time that the groundwork was laid for the cloth- and leathermaking that flourished on into modern times.

Beginning in 1264, as a result of the Thuringian-Hessian War of Succession, Eschwege belonged, under Henry I, Landgrave of Hesse, to Hesse. On 12 May 1292, he offered King Adolf of Germany the town of Eschwege as an Imperial fief and was given it straight back along with the Imperial castle Boyneburg as an hereditary Imperial fief, thereby raising Henry to Imperial Prince, greatly strengthening his power in Hesse.

In 1385, Landgrave Balthasar of Thuringia moved to town and in 1386 he built a castle. In 1433, the town passed back to the Landgraviate of Hesse. Philip I, Landgrave of Hesse, William IV, Landgrave of Hesse-Kassel and Maurice, Landgrave of Hesse-Kassel expanded the castle into a palatial residence. From 1627 to 1632, this was Maurice&#x27;s “old man’s seat” after he had abdicated, and from 1632 to 1655, Landgrave Frederick of Hesse-Eschwege, a sideline in the so-called &quot;Rotenburger Quart&quot; of the house of Hesse-Kassel, was resident here, although he did not actually live in the town until some time after 1646. In the Thirty Years&#x27; War, Eschwege was sacked and widely laid waste by fire in 1637 by Imperial Croats under General Johann von Götzen. After Frederick&#x27;s death in 1655, his (part-)landgraviate passed to his brother Ernst of Hesse-Rheinfels. After 1731, his grandson, Christian of Hesse-Wanfried transferred the residence of the Landgraviate of Hesse-Wanfried to Eschwege. After the Hesse-Wanfried male line died out in 1755, the landgraviate passed to the Hesse-Rotenburg line. Once their male line also died out in 1834, the whole &quot;Quart&quot; passed back to the main house of Hesse-Kassel.

The town acquired in 1875 a railway link when the line from Bebra to Eschwege was built. Niederhone station (as of 1938, Eschwege-West) was the junction of two lines, the &quot;Cannons railway&quot; and the &quot;Bebra–Göttingen line&quot;.

After the Second World War ended in 1945, Eschwege belonged to the United States Zone of Occupation. The US military administration set up a displaced persons camp to lodge Jewish citizens. This camp, in which up to 3,300 people lived at times, was dissolved in 1949.

===Military history===
Eschwege is also home to old barracks, formerly used by the German Army during World War II. It was occupied by US Army troops for a short time after the war and is now a training center for the German Federal Police.

=== Town’s historical names ===
At the time of founding, Eschwege was known as &quot;Eskiniwach&quot;, meaning “Settlement near the ash trees at the water”.

Older people living in town and nearby also say &quot;Eschewei&quot; or &quot;Ischewei&quot;. These names may stem from High German and come from Eschwege&#x27;s original Germanic name.
=== Amalgamations ===
In 1936, Niederhone was amalgamated, and in 1973 in the course of municipal reform, the other six communities named above were also amalgamated.

=== Population development ===


== Religion ==
=== Churches ===
In Eschwege, there are four Protestant parishes in the main town and one each in the outlying centres of Albungen, Eltmannshausen, Niddawitzhausen, Niederdünzebach, Oberdünzebach, Niederhone and Oberhone. Furthermore, there are two Catholic parishes in the main town (St. Elisabeth and Apostelkirche), a state church community (Bismarkstraße 7), a Protestant Free Church parish (Baptists) and a New Apostolic parish, whose members attend services at the former synagogue (Vor dem Berge 4). On 31 December 2006, 13,967 of the town&#x27;s 22,574 inhabitants (61.87%) belonged to the Protestant Church and 3,403 (15.07%) belonged to the Catholic Church.

The town&#x27;s oldest church was built in the 10th century on the spot where now the &quot;Marktkirche&quot; (“Market Church”) is situated.

=== Jewish community ===

Already by the Middle Ages, there were Jews living in Eschwege (first reference in 1301). In the persecution arising in the time of the Black Death, the Jewish community was wiped out. In 1457, a &quot;Judengasse&quot; (“Jews’ Lane”) was mentioned, and from 1507 comes mention of the &quot;vicus iudaicus&quot;. The &quot;Judengasse&quot; lay in the town centre between &quot;Kohlenmarkt&quot; and &quot;Neuer Steinweg&quot;. In 1580, 30 Jewish inhabitants were counted in town. By the mid 18th century, this had risen to 171 (4.9% of the whole population). The families earned their livelihood at first almost exclusively from livestock trading and goods trading (textiles). In the 19th century, however, many Jewish trading, business and industrial operations arose, which earned great importance to the town&#x27;s economic life. Even in public life, the Jewish inhabitants readily took part. The community belonged to the Lower Hesse (Kassel) Rabbinate Region, although it had its own district rabbinate. The Jewish population peaked in 1885, when there were 549. As early as 1838, a synagogue had been dedicated. Its interior was utterly destroyed on 8 November 1938, one day before the nationwide Kristallnacht. Since 1954, the former synagogue has served as Eschwege&#x27;s New Apostolic church.

After 1933, some of the Jewish community&#x27;s members left Eschwege or emigrated as Jews were being stripped of their rights and subjected to reprisals. Four hundred and twenty-one left in 1933 alone, many of them for the United States (80). In 1941 and 1942, the last hundred or so Jewish residents were deported to the death camps.

After 1945, a displaced persons camp to lodge Jewish death camp survivors was set up under the supervision of the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration and lasted a few years. Almost all the camp dwellers emigrated to Israel once that state had been founded. The Jews left in Eschwege were in the long run too few in number to be able to form a community.

== Politics ==
=== Town council ===

The municipal election held on 26 March 2006 yielded the following results:

Social Democrats and the FDP work together on town council.

=== Executive ===
The town&#x27;s executive (&quot;Magistrat&quot;) is made up of two full-time members (Mayor Alexander Heppe [CDU] and treasurer Reiner Brill) and seven other councillors, of whom 3 are from the SPD, 2 from the CDU and one each from the FDP and the FWG.

=== Mayor ===
The current mayor is Alexander Heppe (CDU), who was elected mayor after winning 65.63% of the votes on 14 March 2021, increasing his majority over the candidate from the SPD.

=== Coat of arms ===
The town&#x27;s arms might be described thus: Gules a castle embattled with two towers with peaked roofs argent, between the towers an ash twig with three pinnate leaves vert.

The town of Eschwege has passed a bylaw governing the use of the coat of arms.

Through the town run &quot;Bundesstraßen&quot; 27, 249 and 452. Furthermore, Eschwege lies on the Regionalbahn line R7 (Göttingen–Eschwege–Bebra–Bad Hersfeld–Fulda) and belongs to the &quot;Nordhessischer Verkehrsverbund&quot; (“North Hesse Transport Association”, NVV). The nearby Autobahn A 44 (Kassel–Eisenach) is currently under construction.

At the timetable change on 13 December 2009, the &quot;Nordhessischer Verkehrsverbund&quot; (&quot;North Hesse Transport Association&quot;) added a service between Eschwege West and Eschwege town on its own infrastructure, which it had brought back into service and modernised. The old line, part of a closed section of the Kanonenbahn, was joined to the Göttingen–Bebra line north and south of Eschwege West station. This meant that Eschwege West station was bypassed and it was closed for scheduled passenger services. A new station was opened at Eschwege-Niederhone. A two-storey car park and a central bus station was opened at Eschwege town station.

Eschwege town station received in 2013 the European Rail Award as &quot;Small station of the Year&quot;.

<doc id="788767" wikidata="Q153620" url="?curid=788767" title="Amanullah Khan">
<text>Ghazi Amanullah Khan (Pashto and Persian: ; 1 June 1892 – 26 April 1960) was the sovereign of Afghanistan from 1919, first as Emir and after 1926 as King, until his abdication in 1929. After the end of the Third Anglo-Afghan War in August 1919, Afghanistan was able to relinquish its protected state status to proclaim independence and pursue an independent foreign policy free from the influence of the United Kingdom.

His rule was marked by dramatic political and social change, including attempts to modernise Afghanistan along Western lines. He did not fully succeed in achieving this objective due to an uprising by Habibullah Kalakani and his followers. On 14 January 1929, Amanullah abdicated and fled to neighbouring British India as the Afghan Civil War began to escalate. From British India, he went to Europe, where after 30 years in exile, he died in Zürich, Switzerland on 26 April 1960. His body was brought to Afghanistan and buried in Jalalabad near his father Habibullah Khan&#x27;s tomb.

==Early years==

Amanullah Khan was born on 1 June 1892, in Paghman near Kabul, Afghanistan to a Pashtun family. He was the favoured and the third son of the Emir Habibullah Khan from his second wife. Amanullah was installed as the governor of Kabul, and was in control of the army and the treasury. He gained the allegiance of most of the tribal leaders.

In February 1919, Emir Habibullah Khan went on a hunting trip to Afghanistan&#x27;s Laghman Province. Among those in his retinue were his brother Nasrullah Khan, Habibullah&#x27;s first son from his first wife Inayatullah, and Habibullah&#x27;s commander-in-chief Nadir Khan. On the evening of 20 February 1919, Habibullah was assassinated while in his tent by Shuja-ud-Daula Ghourbandi on orders from his younger son from his second wife, Amanullah Khan who would later become king in March 1919, leaving Nasrullah as successor to the Afghan throne. Nasrullah at first refused to take the throne and declared his allegiance to his nephew Inayatullah, Habibullah&#x27;s first-born son from his first wife. Inayatullah refused and said that his father had made his uncle Nasrullah the rightful heir and wanted him to become Emir. All the local tribespeople gave their allegiance to Nasrullah, who was a pious and religious man.

The remainder of Habibullah&#x27;s party journeyed southeast to Jalalabad, and on 21 February 1919 reached the city, where Nasrullah was declared Emir, supported by Habibullah&#x27;s first son Inayatullah.

Amanullah Khan, third son of Habibullah by Habibullah&#x27;s second wife, had remained in Kabul as the king&#x27;s representative. Upon receiving the news of his father&#x27;s death, Amanullah immediately seized control of the treasury at Kabul and staged a coup against his uncle. He took control of Kabul and the central government, declaring war against Nasrullah. Nasrullah did not want any bloodshed in order for him to be king. He told Amanullah that he could have the kingdom, and he would go into exile in Saudi Arabia. Amanullah Khan swore upon the Quran that no harm would come to Nasrullah if he returned to Kabul and then he could do as he pleased. On 28 February 1919, Amanullah proclaimed himself Emir. On 3 March 1919, fearing that Nasrullah&#x27;s supporters would rise against Amanullah, he subsequently went against his word. Nasrullah was arrested and imprisoned by Amanullah&#x27;s forces.

On 13 April 1919, Amanullah held a Durbar (a royal court under the supervision of Amanullah) in Kabul which inquired into the death of Habibullah. It found a colonel in the Afghanistan military guilty of the crime, and had him executed. On manufactured evidence, it found Nasrullah complicit in the assassination. Nasrullah was sentenced to life imprisonment but Amanullah had him assassinated approximately one year later while being held in the royal jail.

Russia had recently undergone its Communist revolution leading to strained relations between the country and the United Kingdom. Amanullah Khan recognized the opportunity to use the situation to gain Afghanistan&#x27;s independence over its foreign affairs. He led a surprise attack against the British in India on 3 May 1919, beginning the Third Anglo-Afghan war. After initial successes, the war quickly became a stalemate as the United Kingdom was still dealing with the costs of World War I. An armistice was reached towards the end of 1919, which led to Afghanistan being freed of British diplomatic influence.

==Reforms==
===Administrative and political reforms===
Amanullah conceptualized a modernist constitution that incorporated equal rights and individual freedoms, with the guidance of his father-in-law and Foreign Minister Mahmud Tarzi. To ensure national unity based on equal rights for all people before the law, and their participation in the political development of the country, he drafted the country&#x27;s first constitution, the &quot;Statute of the Supreme Government of Afghanistan&quot;, which was officially approved and ratified by 872 tribal elders and government officials gathered in a Loya Jirga in Jalalabad on 11 April 1922. Under Sharia law and government-enacted legislation, all citizens were entitled to equal rights and freedoms, according to Article 16 of the constitution.

===Education and literature===
Amanullah enjoyed early popularity within Afghanistan and he used his influence to modernise the country. Amanullah created new more cosmopolitan schools for both boys and girls in the regions and overturned centuries-old traditions such as strict dress codes for women. Various educational facilities, such as the Telegraph School, the Arabic Learning Academy or Daruloloom, Mastoorat School, Rashidya School in Jalalabad, Kandahar, and Mazar-e-sharif, Qataghan School, and the Academy of Basic Medical Sciences, as well as more than 320 schools, were established across all provinces. These schools initially had Indian instructors who were then replaced by French teachers. Primary education became obligatory, and literacy courses were developed to foster and improve reading abilities. Later, courses for teaching religious subjects and modern sciences were developed, with Amanullah Khan himself teaching some of them.

Despite Dari being the official language, the Pashto language was promoted as an important aspect of Afghan identity by Amanullah Khan. By the 1930s, a campaign had begun with the intention of making Pashto the Afghan government&#x27;s official language. Pashto was declared an official language in 1936, and this was reaffirmed in 1964.

===Cultural reforms===
Amanullah&#x27;s wife, Queen Soraya Tarzi played a significant role regarding his policy towards women. This rapid modernisation created a backlash and a reactionary uprising known as the Khost rebellion which was suppressed in 1925. Amanullah met with many followers of the Baháʼí Faith in India and Europe, from where he brought back books that are still to be found in the Kabul Library. This association later served as one of the accusations against him when he was overthrown.

The failure of Amanullah Khan&#x27;s reforms, like that of any other major political phenomena, was the result of a complex set of internal and external variables, some of which were objective in origin and others of which were linked to secret service organisations operating outside the country&#x27;s borders. On the one hand, objective reasons arose from existing tensions between the changes being implemented and the interests of society&#x27;s ruling class. At the time, Afghanistan&#x27;s foreign policy was primarily concerned with the rivalry between the Soviet Union and the United Kingdom, the so-called Great Game. Each attempted to gain influence in Afghanistan and foil attempts by the other power to gain influence in the region. This effect was inconsistent, but generally favourable for Afghanistan; Amanullah established a limited Afghan Air Force consisting of donated Soviet planes.

==Visit to Europe==

Amanullah travelled to Europe in late 1927. The Afghan King and Queen set out from the port of Karachi and en-route they met with King Fuad of Egypt in Cairo. They undertook a whirlwind European visit: Italy (arrived 8 January 1928), where they met with King Victor-Emanuel III of Italy along with his Prime Minister, Benito Mussolini and then Pope Pius XI in the Vatican City; France, (arrived in Nice on 22 January 1928 and then Paris on 25 January), meeting with President Doumergue; Belgium, (arrived in Brussels on 8 February), meeting with King Albert I and Queen Elisabeth of Belgium. The next stop was Germany. The germanophile king arrived in Berlin on 22 February and met with President Paul von Hindenburg the same day.

He travelled to Great Britain as guests of King George V and Queen Mary. The steam ship &quot;SS Maid of Orleans&quot; arrived in Dover on 13 March 1928. The royal couple left England on 5 April and made their way to Poland. On their way, they had a longer stopover in Berlin where the Amanullah underwent an emergency tonsillectomy. The royal train with the Emir back on board arrived in the Polish border town of Zbąszyń on 28 April. The next day it pulled into Warsaw to be met by Polish ministers, the speaker of the Sejm and the country&#x27;s president Ignacy Mościcki. At his request Amanullah was granted an audience with the First Marshal of Poland Józef Piłsudski. The Afghan party departed from Warsaw travelling east across the country to the border with the Soviet Union on 2 May 1928.

Finally Amanullah Khan visited the first Turkish president Mustafa Kemal Atatürk on 20 May 1928 which at the time was the first state visit by a foreign Head of State to Turkey. During this visit, Turkey signed its first technical assistant agreement with Afghanistan.

==Civil War==
During and after Amanullah&#x27;s visit to Europe, opposition to his rule increased to the point where an uprising in Jalalabad culminated in a march to the capital, and much of the army deserted instead of resisting. This was caused by Amanullah&#x27;s new policies of rapid modernisation after returning from his tour of Europe in a still very conservative society. Some of his new policies (inspired by Mustafa Kemal Atatürk&#x27;s revolution who however had advised him to be moderate and careful in his reforms during his visit to Turkey in 1928) included the abolishment of the veil, changing Friday which is a weekend and sacred day of worship in Islamic countries to a working day and making Thursday a non-working day instead. He also ordered people to replace their traditional Afghan attire with new western clothes (at a time when majority of the people could only afford with difficulty the basic necessities like food) and to tip their hats when greeting others like in Western countries. As a result, Islamic conservatives and opponents led by Habibullāh Kalakāni rose up against his rule and new western inspired modernisation policies.

On 14 December 1928 Kalakāni, a leader of the &quot;Saqqawists&quot; opposition movement accompanied by groups of Kohistanis, led an attack on Kabul, which was repelled after nine days of fighting and retreated to Paghman. He launched another attack on 7 January 1929 and successfully took Kabul. On 14 January 1929 Amanullah abdicated and went into temporary exile in then British India passing the monarchy to his half brother Inayatullah Khan who became the next king of Afghanistan until surrendering the Arg four days later on 18 January 1929 to Kalakani who proclaimed himself as Amir of Afghanistan.

Much of the resistance in support of Amanullah was confined to just one of the five &quot;culture zones.&quot; The impacted area was a small &quot;tribal zone&quot; that encompassed the Eastern and Southern provinces (Mashreqi and Jonub) in 1929, as well as the modern provinces of Nangarhar, Laghman, Kunar, Paktiya, and Paktika. The Shinwari, Mohmand, Kakar, Mangal, Jaji, Ahmadzai, Safi, Ghilzai, along with other Pashtun tribes populate most of this area. Hazarajat&#x27;s Shi&#x27;a Hazarahs were strong supporters of Amanullah&#x27;s reforms and hence resisted the Kalakāni&#x27;s rule. Large portions of the country were not involved in either of the violent conflicts.

While Amanullah was in India, Kalakāni battled anti-Saqqawist tribes. Around 22 March 1929, Amanullah returned to Afghanistan assembling forces in Kandahar to reach Kabul and to dispose of Kalakāni. In April 1929 he attempted to advance to Kabul but his forces were defeated in Muqur, Ghazni and on 23 May 1929 he fled to India again. He never returned to his country.

== Exile ==

Kalakāni&#x27;s rule lasted only nine months and he was replaced by Mohammad Nadir Shah on 13 October 1929. Amanullah Khan attempted to return to Afghanistan, but he had little support from the people. From British India, the ex-king travelled to Europe and settled in Italy, buying a villa in Rome&#x27;s Prati neighbourhood. Meanwhile, Nadir Shah made sure Amanullah&#x27;s return to Afghanistan was made impossible by engaging in propaganda. Most of Amanullah&#x27;s reforms were reversed, although later king Mohammad Zahir Shah made a more gradual program of reform.

Nevertheless, Amanullah still had a group of staunch supporters in Afghanistan. These Amanullah loyalists unsuccessfully attempted several times in the 1930s and 1940s to bring him back to power.

During World War II, Germany had extensive plans to reinstall Amanullah to his throne. Khan, while aware and keen to regain his throne, knew little more about the plan; Nazi officials never invited him to participate in discussions. It was Khan&#x27;s name and face that was needed to provide legitimacy to an uprising and, eventually, a puppet Nazi government in Afghanistan. The plan, however, did not come to fruition; for it to work, Germany needed the support of the Soviet Union, which it never fully received. While Hitler cancelled the plan in the last days of December 1939, there was still hope in the German Foreign Office and the Abwehr that the Soviets would come forward with a proposal; it never happened.

Discussions were revived in late 1942 but following the Axis loss in Stalingrad in 1943, the plans were abandoned.

Amidst all the negotiations, Khan remained in exile in Rome and never directly spoke to German or Soviet officials. While some war-time news articles suggest he was an active Nazi agent, other sources suggest he never even succeeded in obtaining a visa to visit Berlin. It was his brother-in-law, Ghulam Siddiq, to whom Khan had given full powers to negotiate on his behalf, that travelled between Germany, the Soviet Union, Italy and Switzerland to participate in talks surrounding the operation.

Khan survived the war unharmed but appears to have lived a life of poverty in his exile, at least during and post World War II. One of the reasons Nazi officials hesitated from inviting him to Berlin was because they suspected he would ask for money. Moreover, a British Intelligence Officer, who visited Khan after the Allies had captured Rome, described his household, &#x27;His Majesty from time to time rubbing his hand from cold. Her Majesty huddled in a ghastly gilt arm-chair, gracefully draped in a mink coat. Pimp-like princelings and over-painted Royal Aunts from time to time taping the conversation towards kilowatts and the lack of scruples shown by black marketeers.&#x27; Neverthelesss, people in Rome&#x27;s Prati neighbourhood, where Khan lived, claimed that he arrived with &quot;crates of jewels&quot; which he slowly sold.

== Death ==
After fleeing to British India, King Amanullah Khan sought asylum in Italy because he was given the Order of the Annunciation by King Victor Emmanuel III on his world tour. He died on 26 April 1960 in Zürich, Switzerland. His body was brought to Afghanistan and buried in the eastern city of Jalalabad near the tomb of his father Haibullah Khan. He left behind his widowed wife and four sons and five daughters, including Princess India of Afghanistan.

==Family==

Amanullah&#x27;s first marriage occurred in 1908, when he was sixteen but ended in divorce shortly afterwards. One of his wives, Gul Pari, was a Chitrali and served as a lady-in-waiting to his mother. They married in 1910, when he was eighteen. She died in 1912 during childbirth while giving birth to their son, Hedayatullah. Another wife, Soraya Tarzi (1899–1968), was the daughter of Mahmud Tarzi, who served as Afghanistan&#x27;s Foreign Minister, and his second wife, Asma Rasmiya Khanum. Together, Amanullah and Soraya had ten children—six sons and four daughters. He also married Vanda, with whom he had two sons. Another of his wives, Princess Aliah, was the daughter of his paternal uncle, Emir Nasrullah Khan, and his wife Gulshan, a Shighnani. They married on 31 December 1928, but she did not accompany him into exile to Italy in 1929, and he eventually sent her a divorce. Aliah chose not to remarry.

Amanullah and Soraya had ten children, six daughters and four sons:
*Princess Ameenah Shah (14 May 1916 – 29 October 1992). During her exile, in 1954 she married a naturalised Turkish citizen of Bosnian origin named Mustafa Hasanovic Ar. He was the son of the deputy of the Bosnian Young Muslims.
*Princess Abedah. She married firstly Ali Wali, son of Muhammad Wali and had one son. She married secondly to Hamidullah Enayat Siraj, son of Sardar Enayatullah.
**Ikhlil
*Princess Meliha (1920–2011). She became a medical doctor in Istanbul University, and married Turkish engineer A. Tahir Söker, a close relative of Celâl Bayar.
*Crown Prince Rahmatullah of Afghanistan (7 June 1921 – 11 September 2009). He married Adelia Graziani, a niece of an Italian general Rodolfo Graziani.
* Prince Saifullah died young from cholera.
*Prince Hymayatullah died very young from bronchial pneumonia.
*Princess Adeela (1925–2000) married Armando Angelini (b. August 10, 1924), the son of an Italian cavalry officer and they had four daughters: 
**Elisabetta (b. 31 May 1948)
**Cristina (b. 3 Oct 1949)
**Simin (b. 8 Oct 1954)
**Cinzia (b. 11 Jan 1957)
*Prince Ehsanullah (1926–2017) married Leyla Tarzi, daughter of Col. Tavvab Tarzi, son of Mahmud Tarzi. They had 2 sons, both born in Istanbul: 
**Ahmed Aman Ullah (b. 1961), married Sylvie Théobald Rahmat Ullah (b. at Bourges, Cher, France)
**Rahmad Ullah, (b. 1965), married Carine d&#x27;Afghanistan-Berger of Bernex, Switzerland.
* Princess India (1929–2023), in 1951 she married Kazem Malek, an Iranian landowner, and settled in Mashhad, Iran. They had two daughters: Soraya, born in 1954 in Rome, Italy, and Hamdam, born in Mashad, Iran in 1956. After eight years of marriage Princess India divorced her husband and returned to Rome to live with her two daughters. In 1966 she married an Afghan businessman, Abdul Rauf Haider. They had a son named Eskandar who was born in Rome in 1967. In 1968, Princess India returned to Afghanistan after the death of her mother Queen Soraya. She attended funeral ceremonies in Jalalabad and was very much impressed by her homeland and decided from that time on she would work for the benefit of Afghanistan.
**Soraya (b. 1954), first daughter of Princess India
**Haman (b. 1956), second daughter of Princess India and her husband Kazem Malek. Haman later married an Italian naval commander, Paolo Fusarini. The couple had two children, Matteo and Flavia.
**Eskandar (b. 1967), son of Princess India and Abdul Rauf Haider.
*Princess Nagia, the youngest daughter of Amanullah and Soraya. She married İlter Doğan, a Turkish businessman whom she met on her visit to Istanbul. They have two children.
**Ömer, son of Princess Nagia and İlter Doğan
**Hümeyra, daughter of Princess Nagia and İlter Doğan

<doc id="788772" wikidata="Q638206" url="?curid=788772" title="Arctica">
<text>Arctica, or Arctida is a hypothetical ancient continent which formed approximately 2.565 billion years ago in the Neoarchean era. It was made of Archaean cratons, including the Siberian Craton, with its Anabar/Aldan shields in Siberia, and the Slave, Wyoming, Superior, and North Atlantic cratons in North America. Arctica was named by because the Arctic Ocean formed by the separation of the North American and Siberian cratons. Russian geologists writing in English call the continent &quot;Arctida&quot; since it was given that name in 1987, alternatively the Hyperborean craton, in reference to the hyperboreans in Greek mythology.

Nikolay Shatsky () was the first to assume that the crust in the Arctic region was of continental origin. Shatsky, however, was a &quot;fixist&quot; and, erroneously, explained the presence of Precambrian and Paleozoic metamorphic rocks on the New Siberian, Wrangel, and De long Islands with subduction. &quot;Mobilists&quot;, on the other hand, also erroneously, proposed that North America had rifted from Eurasia and that the Arctic basins had opened behind a retreating Alaska.

==Precambrian continent==
In his reconstruction of the supercontinent cycle, Rogers proposed that the continent Ur formed at about 3 Ga and formed East Gondwana in the Middle Proterozoic by accretion to East Antarctica; Arctica formed around 2.5–2 Ga by the amalgamation of the Canadian and Siberian shields plus Greenland; and Atlantica formed around 2  Ga by the amalgamation of the West African Craton and eastern South America. Arctica then grew around 1.5  Ga by accretion of East Antarctica and Baltica to form the supercontinent Nena. Around 1  Ga Nena, Ur, and Atlantica collided to form the supercontinent Rodinia.

 argued that most cratons that were around at 2.5 Ga most likely formed in a single region simply because they were located in a single region in Pangaea, which is the reason Rogers argued for the existence of Arctica.
The core of Arctica was the Canadian Shield, which named Kenorland. They argued that this continent formed around 2.5  Ga and then rifted before reassembling along the 1.8  Ga Trans-Hudson and Taltson-Thelon orogenies. These two orogenies are derived from continental crust (not oceanic crust) and were probably intracontinental, leaving Kenorland intact from 2.5  Ga to the present. Correlations between orogenies in Canada and Siberia remain more controversial.

Laurentia and Baltica were connected during the Late Palaeoproterzoic (1.7–1.74  Ga) and Siberia later joined them. Paleomagnetic reconstructions indicate that they formed a single supercontinent during the Mesoproterozoic (1.5–1.45  Ga) but paleomagnetic data and geological pieces of evidence also suggest a considerable spatial gap between Siberia and Laurentia and Arctica is thought to be the missing link.

==Phanerozoic microcontinent==
The current geological structure of the Arctic Region is the result of tectonic processes during the Mesozoic and Cenozoic (250 Ma to present) when the Amerasian and Eurasian basins formed, but the presence of Precambrian metamorphic complexes discovered in the 1980s indicated a continent once existed between Laurentia, Baltica, and Siberia.

In the reconstruction of , Arctica originally formed as a continent during the Tonian 950 Ma and became part of the supercontinent Rodinia. It reformed during the Permian-Triassic 255 Ma and became part of Pangaea. During this period the configuration of Arctica changed and the continent moved from near the Equator to near the North Pole while keeping its position between three major cratons: Laurentia, Baltica, and Siberia.
An extended magmatic event, the High Arctic Large Igneous Province, broke Arctica in part 130–90 Ma, opened the Arctic Ocean, and left radiating dyke swarms across the Arctic.

Fragments of this continent include the Kara Shelf, New Siberian Islands, northern Alaska, Chukotka Peninsula, Inuit Fold Belt in northern Greenland, and two Arctic underwater ridges, the Lomonosov and Alpha-Mendeleev Ridges. More recent reconstructions also include Barentsia (including Svalbard and Timan-Pechora Plates).
Remains of the last continent are now located on the Kara Sea Shelf, New Siberian Islands and adjacent shelf, Alaska north of Brooks Ridge, Chukchi Peninsula in easternmost Siberia, and fragments in northern Greenland and Northern Canada and in the submerged Lomonosov Ridge.

<doc id="788773" wikidata="Q528283" url="?curid=788773" title="Stu Ungar">
<text>Stuart Errol Ungar (September 8, 1953 – November 22, 1998) was an American professional poker, blackjack, and gin rummy player, widely regarded to have been the greatest gin player of all time and one of the best Texas hold &#x27;em players.

Ungar is one of two people in poker history to have won the World Series of Poker Main Event three times. He is the only person to win Amarillo Slim&#x27;s Super Bowl of Poker three times, the world&#x27;s second most prestigious poker title of its time. Additionally, Ungar is one of only four players in poker history to win consecutive titles in the WSOP Main Event, along with Johnny Moss, Doyle Brunson and Johnny Chan.

==Early life==
Ungar was born to Jewish parents Isidore (1907–1967) and Faye Ungar (1916–1979). He was raised on Manhattan&#x27;s Lower East Side. His father, Isidore (&quot;Ido&quot;) Ungar, was a bookmaker and loan shark who ran a bar/social club called Foxes Corner that doubled as a gambling establishment, exposing Stu to gambling at a young age. Despite Ido&#x27;s attempts to keep his son from gambling after seeing its effects on his regular customers, Stu began playing underground gin rummy and quickly made a name for himself. Ungar was gifted at school and skipped seventh grade, but then dropped out of school in tenth grade.

Ido died of a heart attack on July 25, 1967. Following his father&#x27;s death, and with his mother virtually incapacitated by a stroke, Ungar drifted around the New York gambling scene until age 18, when he was befriended by reputed organized crime figure Victor Romano. Romano was regarded as one of the best card players of his time. He had the ability to recite the spelling and definition of all of the words in the dictionary and apparently shared a penchant and interest for calculating odds while gambling as Ungar did. By many accounts, the two developed a very close relationship, with Romano serving as a mentor and protector.

Ungar was infamous for his arrogance and for routinely criticizing aloud the play of opponents he felt were beneath him, which included just about anyone. One of Ungar&#x27;s most famous quotes sums up his competitiveness: &quot;I never want to be called a &#x27;good loser.&#x27; Show me a good loser and I&#x27;ll just show you a loser.&quot; However, his relationship with Romano gave Ungar protection from various gamblers who did not take kindly to his crass attitude and assassin-like playing style. 

===Gin rummy and transition to poker===
Ungar won a local gin tournament at age 10. He dropped out of school to play gin rummy in the 1960s full-time to help support his mother and sister after his father died, and began regularly winning tournaments which earned him $10,000 or more. By 1976, he was regarded as one of the best players in New York City.

Ungar eventually had to leave New York due to gambling debts at local race tracks. He later moved to Miami, Florida, to find more action. In 1977, Ungar left Miami for Las Vegas, Nevada, where he reunited with Madeline Wheeler, a former girlfriend who would become his wife in 1982.

One of the reasons Ungar eventually took up poker exclusively was because gin action had dried up due to his skilled reputation. Ungar destroyed anyone who challenged him in a gin match, including a professional widely regarded as the best gin player of Ungar&#x27;s generation, Harry &quot;Yonkie&quot; Stein. Ungar beat Stein 86 games to none in a high-stakes game of Hollywood Gin, after which Stein dropped out of sight in gin circles and eventually stopped playing professionally. As one observer who knew him put it, Stein &quot;was never the same after that night.&quot; After beating Stein and several other top gin professionals, Ungar was a marked man. Nobody wanted to play him in gin. In the hopes of generating more action for himself, Ungar began offering potential opponents handicaps to even the playing field. He was known to let his opponent (professional or not) look at the last card in the deck, offer rebates to defeated opponents and always play each hand in the dealer position, all of which put him at a strong disadvantage.

When Ungar first visited Las Vegas in 1977, gin was still popular in a tournament format, much like heads up poker tournaments. Ungar won or finished highly in so many gin tournaments that several casinos asked him to not play in them because many players said they would not enter if they knew Ungar was playing. Ungar later said in his biography that he loved seeing his opponent slowly break down over the course of a match, realizing he could not win and eventually get a look of desperation on his face.

Shortly after arriving in Las Vegas, Ungar defeated professional gambler Billy Baxter for $40,000. Baxter noted that when Ungar first entered the room, Baxter did not believe he was his opponent because of Ungar&#x27;s youthful looks and small stature. Baxter also said that during their match, a Coca-Cola crate had to be placed on Ungar&#x27;s chair so he could reach the table.

Though he is nowadays more well known for his poker accomplishments, Ungar regarded himself as a better gin rummy player, once stating,

==1980 and 1981 WSOP Main Event titles==
In 1980, Ungar entered the World Series of Poker (WSOP) looking for more high-stakes action. In an interview for the 1997 Main Event Final Table, Ungar told ESPN TV commentator Gabe Kaplan that the 1980 WSOP was the first time he had ever played a Texas hold&#x27;em tournament. Poker legend Doyle Brunson remarked that it was the first time he had seen a player improve as the tournament went on.

Ungar won the main event, defeating Brunson, who wrote the book on Texas Hold ‘Em, by reading the book the night before he entered, becoming the youngest champion in its history (surpassed first by Phil Hellmuth in 1989, then others). Ungar looked even younger than he was, and was dubbed &quot;The Kid.&quot;

Ungar would defend his title successfully at the 1981 WSOP by defeating Perry Green. Ungar was nearly not allowed to defend his title. Several days before the main event, he was banned from Binion&#x27;s Horseshoe by Benny Binion because he spat in the face of a dealer after losing a sizable pot in a high-stakes game. Binion&#x27;s son Jack interceded and convinced his father to let Ungar play, citing the media attention that the defending champion would attract.

===Other WSOP bracelets===
As the reigning world champion, Ungar won his second bracelet in 1981 in the $10,000 Deuce to Seven Draw event, defeating 1978 world champion Bobby Baldwin in heads-up play. For this victory, Ungar received $95,000.

In the 1983 World Series of Poker, Ungar won his fourth bracelet. He defeated professional poker player and multi-WSOP bracelet winner Dewey Tomko in the $5,000 Seven Card Stud event, winning $110,000.

==Blackjack==
Ungar&#x27;s prodigy-level IQ and total recall contributed to his blackjack card counting abilities, which were so sharp that he was frequently banned from playing in casinos; he was eventually unable to play blackjack in Las Vegas or anywhere else.

In 1977, Ungar was bet $100,000 by Bob Stupak, an owner and designer of casinos, that he could not count down half a six-deck shoe and determine the last three decks (156 cards). Ungar won the bet.

Ungar was fined in 1982 by the New Jersey Gaming Commission for allegedly cheating while playing blackjack in an Atlantic City casino. The casino said that Ungar &quot;capped&quot; a bet (put extra chips on a winning hand after it was over to be paid out more), something he vehemently denied. The fine for this offense was $500; however, paying it would have also forced Ungar to admit that he had cheated. Ungar believed that his memory and card counting ability were natural skills and thus he did not need to cap bets or partake in any form of cheating. Ungar fought the case in court and won, avoiding the $500 fine. The court battle, though, cost him an estimated $50,000 in legal and travel expenses. In his biography, Ungar claimed he was consequently so exhausted from travel and court proceedings that he was not able to successfully defend his WSOP main event title.

In 1997, a nearly-broke Ungar convinced the management at the Lady Luck Hotel &amp; Casino to let him play single-deck blackjack. Since Ungar was a known card counter, the casino managers agreed on the condition that his betting would have a high and a low limit (a limited spread), which they presumed would render useless Ungar&#x27;s card counting ability. However, in the game of single-deck blackjack, playing strategy (i.e. how to play a hand and deviate from basic strategy) brings more benefits to the player than betting strategy (i.e. how much to bet on the upcoming round). Ungar continued to play blackjack at the Lady Luck for six months. He built his bankroll up to as much as $300,000 but eventually busted out.

==Drug addiction and divorce==
Ungar&#x27;s mother had died in 1979. It was also around this time that Ungar began using cocaine. He noted in his autobiography that at first he used it on the advice of fellow poker players because of the drug&#x27;s ability to keep someone up and energized for a long period of time, something that would come in handy during marathon poker sessions. However, recreational use soon led to addiction.

Ungar and Madeline were married in 1982 and had a daughter, Stefanie, that same year. Ungar also legally adopted Madeline&#x27;s son from her first marriage, Richie, who adored Ungar and took his surname.

Ungar and Madeline divorced in 1986. Richie died by suicide in 1989, shortly after his high school prom.

Ungar&#x27;s drug problem escalated to such a point that during the WSOP Main Event in 1990, Ungar was found on the third day of the tournament unconscious on the floor of his hotel room from a drug overdose. However, he had such a chip lead that even when the dealers kept taking his blinds out every orbit, Ungar still made the final table and finished ninth without playing another hand, pocketing $25,050.

His addiction took such a physical toll that in an ESPN piece, many of Ungar&#x27;s friends and fellow competitors said that they thought that he would not live to see his fortieth birthday. In the same piece, one friend said that the only thing that kept him alive was his determination to see his daughter grow up.

Most of Ungar&#x27;s winnings at the poker table he lost quickly betting on sports or horses, always looking for &quot;action&quot;.

Many of Ungar&#x27;s friends, including Mike Sexton, began to encourage him to enter drug rehab and offered to pay for Ungar to receive treatment at any facility in the world. Ungar refused, citing several people he knew who had been to rehab previously who told him that drugs were easier to obtain in rehab than on the street.

==Later life==

===&quot;The Comeback Kid&quot;===
In 1997, Ungar was deeply in debt and clearly showed physical damage from his years of addiction. However, he would receive the $10,000 buy-in to the WSOP Main Event from fellow poker pro and friend Billy Baxter moments before the tournament started and was the last person added to the roster, mere seconds before the signup closed.

Ungar was exhausted on the tournament&#x27;s first day as he had been up for over 24 hours straight trying to raise or borrow enough money to play in the event. At one point midway through the first day of play, Ungar began to fall asleep at his table and told Mike Sexton (who was also playing) he didn&#x27;t think he could make it. After encouragement from Sexton and a tongue lashing from Baxter, Ungar settled in and made it through the day.

During the tournament, Ungar kept a picture of his daughter Stefanie in his wallet, and he regularly called her with updates on his progress. Following an up-and-down first day, Ungar showed up for each subsequent day well rested and mentally sharp. He would go on to amass a large chip lead and carry the lead into the final table. Ungar was so highly regarded at this point that local bookies made him the favorite to win the tournament over the entire field, an extreme rarity.

Ungar went on to win the Main Event, joining Johnny Moss as the only three-time winners. After his victory, which was taped for broadcast by ESPN, Ungar was interviewed by Gabe Kaplan, and he showed the picture of his daughter to the camera and dedicated his win to her. He and Baxter split the $1 million first prize. Ungar was dubbed &quot;The Comeback Kid&quot; by the Las Vegas media because of the 16-year span between his main event wins as well as his past drug abuse.

During the 1997 WSOP, Ungar wore a pair of round, cobalt blue-tinted sunglasses to, according to co-biographer Peter Alson, &quot;hide the fact that his nostrils had collapsed from cocaine abuse.&quot;

===Final years===
Ungar spent all of his 1997 WSOP prize money over the course of the next few months, mainly on drugs and sports betting. He attempted to give up drugs several times at the behest of Stefanie but stayed clean for only weeks at a time before relapsing.

As the 1998 WSOP approached, Baxter again offered to pay his entry fee to the main event. However, ten minutes before play started, Ungar told Baxter he was tired and did not feel like playing. Ungar later said the real reason he chose not to play in the event was due to his drug abuse in the weeks prior to the tournament. He noted that he felt showing up in his current condition would be more embarrassing than not showing up at all.

In November 1998, Ungar was looking to clean up his life. His friend Bob Stupak made an arrangement to stake Ungar over a period of time as a fresh start for Ungar. Baxter noted in Ungar&#x27;s biography that he also backed him in a high stakes game at the Bellagio around this time.

===Death===
On November 20, 1998, Ungar checked into room No. 6 at the Oasis Motel, a budget motel located at the end of the Las Vegas Strip. Ungar paid just $48 per night for two nights. On November 22, he was found in the room dead, lying on the floor, fully clothed and with the television off. Doyle Brunson was quoted as saying &quot;Everybody felt terrible, but it wasn&#x27;t a surprise.&quot;

Among his possessions was $800 of a $25,000 advance from Bob Stupak, who earlier in the month Ungar had signed a contract with to pay off debts and finance his tournament play in exchange for future winnings. No drugs were found in the room. It is unknown where the remainder of the money went.

An autopsy showed traces of drugs in Ungar&#x27;s system, but not enough to have directly caused his death. The medical examiner concluded that his death was the result of a heart condition brought on by years of drug abuse.

Despite having won an estimated $30 million during his poker career, Ungar died with no assets to his name. Stupak took up a collection at Ungar&#x27;s funeral to raise funds to pay for the services.

Ungar is interred at Palm Valley View Memorial Park in East Las Vegas.

==Gameplay==

Ungar was noted for his ultra-aggressive playing style and well-timed bluffs. Mike Sexton said that Ungar&#x27;s chips were constantly in motion, and he was described by a fellow professional poker player during the 1997 World Series of Poker as having a &quot;clairvoyant&quot; ability to see his opponents&#x27; hole cards.

Several of Ungar&#x27;s financial backers have commented that he could have earned an immeasurable amount more over his career had he been more of a &quot;hustler&quot;, giving his opponents the false belief they could beat him and thus be willing to risk more money trying. However, Ungar wanted to beat his opponents as soundly as possible, and he often insulted those whose skills he felt were inferior to his own. In his biography, Ungar also noted several opponents who offered to pay him to lose a gin match on purpose in order to collect a large side bet. The opponent would have someone else place the bet, and upon winning they would split the large payoff with Ungar. However, Ungar indicated that pride in his own skill would not allow him to do this; apparently he could not stand the idea of someone having a victory against him, even an illegitimate one.

During the 1992 World Series of Poker, Ungar faced off against 1990 World Champion Mansour Matloubi in a series of $50,000 buy-in no limit hold&#x27;em heads-up freezeout events. On the final hand of the game, Matloubi tried to bluff Ungar all-in for $32,000 on the river with a board of 3-3-7-K-Q. Ungar, who held 10-9, thought for a few seconds and said to Matloubi, &quot;You have 4-5 or 5-6 so I&#x27;m gonna call you with this&quot; and flipped over his 10-high to win the pot and bust Matloubi, who in fact held 4-5 offsuit.

==Personality==

Ungar was once at an airport attempting to fly out of the United States to Europe for a poker tournament with several fellow pros. All of his friends had passports, but he did not. He did not even have a Social Security number until after his 1980 WSOP win and that was only because he was forced to obtain one in order to collect his winnings. Upon telling the airport customs agent he needed the passport immediately to leave the country, the agent replied that for a small fee, they could push the necessary forms through quicker for him. Ungar misconstrued this as a request for a bribe, something he was used to back in New York when with Romano. He had no problem doing this and slipped the agent a $100 bill. However the agent was actually referring to a small &quot;expedite fee&quot; that was common for all passport applicants. The agent was going to call the police and have Ungar arrested for attempting to bribe a public official before his fellow poker players stepped in and smoothed things over.

At one point Ungar was being staked by Las Vegas mob enforcer Anthony &quot;The Ant&quot; Spilotro, and showed up at Spilotro&#x27;s house after having been gone for two days (he was supposed to check in to report his take every day) with a gun in his waistband. Through a slit in the doorway, Spilotro&#x27;s son Vincent witnessed his father beat Ungar brutally, not for losing money or not having reported, but for the disrespect of bringing a gun into his home. His relationship with Spilotro was one that helped define Las Vegas of the 1980s.

Despite owning several expensive cars, Ungar rarely drove. This could have possibly come from the time he purchased a brand new Mercedes sports car and drove it until the vehicle ran out of oil and broke down. He brought it back to the dealership and was told by a mechanic that it had no oil and thus would not run. Ungar replied, &quot;Why the hell didn&#x27;t you tell me you had to put oil in the car?&quot; He preferred to take a taxicab virtually anywhere he went, even from his home in Las Vegas to the casinos, which were only a short distance away. Ungar was known to be a large tipper to cabbies and casino employees, regardless of whether he was winning. Mike Sexton once noted that &quot;Stuey spent what most people make in a year on cab fares.&quot;

Ungar&#x27;s friends often said he &quot;ate like a wild animal.&quot; Ungar saw eating as something that had to be gotten over with so he could get back to gambling action. He would often call restaurants ahead of time and place an order for himself and everyone in his party so it was ready at the same time his table was when they got there. Sexton noted that because Ungar would pay for everyone in his dining party, regardless of how expensive the meal was, it was impossible to argue with his method. He would race in to the restaurant, shovel the food down as fast as he could, throw cash for the entire meal plus a generous tip on the table and be ready to leave, even if the rest of his party had just barely started on drinks or appetizers.

The same friends however also noted that Ungar, when he had money, was one of the most generous people they had ever met. He was known to always be willing to help out a friend. When he was on a hot winning streak, he sent his longtime sports betting friend Michael &quot;Baseball Mike&quot; Salem enough money to pay for several months of his mortgage. Salem had not asked for money and had only mentioned offhand to Ungar he was in the midst of a nasty losing streak. Ungar&#x27;s own attorney recalled a time when Ungar asked him how he was doing. He responded that he was OK, but struggling a little financially. Ungar immediately took $10,000 cash out of his pocket and gave it to him, saying &quot;Take it. It&#x27;s yours. Pay me back when you can. And if you don&#x27;t pay me back, that&#x27;s OK too.&quot; One time, he was walking through Las Vegas with Doyle Brunson. A man stopped him and asked for some money. Ungar pulled out a $100 bill and gave it to the man. When Brunson asked him who the man was, Ungar replied, &quot;If I had known his name, I would have given him $200.&quot;

Sexton and Ungar became friends when Sexton was suffering a losing streak and was nearly broke. Ungar was playing in a high limit seven card stud game and had to use the restroom. He told Sexton to &quot;pick up a hand&quot; (play the next hand) for him. This is generally not allowed in card rooms today, but for top pros like Ungar, rules were much more laxly enforced back then. Although Sexton made a straight on the first five cards he was dealt, he played cautiously at first, not wanting to be overly aggressive with another man&#x27;s money. Ungar returned from the restroom in the middle of the hand, at which point he was (to Sexton&#x27;s surprise) thrilled that his money was involved in such a giant pot. His attitude made Sexton more comfortable with playing the hand aggressively and he ended up winning a large amount. Ungar saw another stud game going on across the room and gave Sexton $1,500 to go play in it. Sexton did and won an additional $4,000, of which he gave Ungar half and began to rebuild his bankroll.

Ungar also once won a large amount of money (over $1.5 million) on a series of horse races. That night, he took all his close friends out to a strip club and paid for the entire evening, which included numerous girls, Cristal champagne and a VIP booth. Sexton estimated the night cost Ungar $8,800, and he never once asked or expected anybody to pay him back.

Ungar never had a bank account in his own name, preferring to keep his money in safe deposit boxes in hotels across Las Vegas. He dismissed the notion of a bank or checking account. &quot;You mean I can&#x27;t go there at midnight and get my money out?&quot;, he asked (this was before the advent of ATMs). &quot;That&#x27;s ridiculous.&quot; Madeline noted that Ungar had no concept of how a bank account even worked since he paid for everything in cash. According to her, he believed that if you had a bank account and wrote a check, the check would be honored; not understanding that you need to take cash to the bank and deposit it to have the funds available to write a check first.

==Legacy==
Ungar is regarded by many poker analysts and insiders as one of the greatest pure-talent players ever to play the game, but his long-time friend Mike Sexton said, &quot;In the game of life, Stu Ungar was a loser.&quot;

During his poker career, he won five WSOP bracelets, and over $3.6 million in tournament winnings, with over $2 million coming from cashes at the WSOP. He won 10 major no-limit Texas hold &#x27;em events (buy-ins $5,000 or higher) out of a total of 30 major tournaments he entered in his life, a record still unsurpassed in percentage terms.

Ungar also won the Main Event at the now-defunct Amarillo Slim&#x27;s Super Bowl of Poker in 1984, 1988 and 1989, when it was considered by the poker world the world&#x27;s second most prestigious poker title. As Amarillo Slim himself put it, &quot;Stu musta won a million dollars in my tournaments.&quot;

A movie based loosely on his life, &quot;High Roller: The Stu Ungar Story&quot; (alternate title &quot;Stuey&quot;), was made in 2003. He was portrayed by Michael Imperioli.

Ungar was inducted posthumously into the Poker Hall of Fame in 2001.

His biography, &quot;One of a Kind: The Rise and Fall of Stuey &#x27;the Kid&#x27; Ungar, the World&#x27;s Greatest Poker Player&quot; by Nolan Dalla and Peter Alson was published in 2005. The Emmy-winning ESPN documentary &quot;One of a Kind: The Rise and Fall of Stu Ungar&quot; was broadcast in 2006. It contains interviews with his wife and daughter and several other people who knew him. It also featured excerpts from tapes he recorded in the last year of his life for an autobiography that never appeared.

<text>(, ; in United Kingdom: New Horizons, in United States: Abrams Discoveries) is an editorial collection of illustrated monographic books published by the Éditions Gallimard in pocket format. The books are concise introductions to particular subjects, written by experts and intended for a general audience.

Created in the style of &quot;livre d&#x27;art&quot;, the collection is based on an abundant pictorial documentation and a way of bringing together visual documents and texts, enhanced by printing on coated paper, as commented in &quot;L&#x27;Express&quot;, &quot;genuine monographs, published like art books&quot;. Its creator—Pierre Marchand the &quot;&quot;, as remarked by the German graphic designer Raymond Stoffel—was instrumental in moulding the policy and ideals of the collection, which was an immediate success both in France and internationally.

The first title (English edition: &quot;The Search for Ancient Egypt&quot;) appeared on 21 November 1986, authored by the French Egyptologist Jean Vercoutter. These scholarly little books then released in successive volumes, without a systematic plan, each of which is structured like a separate book (see monographic series). 588 titles were published by November 2012, with more than 160 volumes of spin-offs and catalogues as of 2021.

== Overview ==


The books are printed using A6 format (125 × 178 mm), according to &quot;Encyclopædia Universalis&quot;, &quot;with breathtaking iconography (illustration)&quot; reproduced on thick and glossy coated paper, from which leap two or three images per page. In this picture-dense format, the authors must squeeze their words in edgewise. Each book is composed of a monograph on a particular topic, the whole collection covers all areas of human knowledge and experience, such as archaeology, art, culture, civilisation, history, music, religion, science, et cetera, with 502 specialists&#x27; contributions. Chronological narrative is the principal structure for describing a subject, for example, the title (UK ed. &quot;The Sky: Order and Chaos&quot;), which narrated in chronological order to present the varied subjects relating to the sky above and peoples&#x27; perception of it, through historical perspective of cultural, social and religious aspects.

The captions for illustrations must be informative, they should not duplicate information in the body text, nor do they interrupt the narrative thread. Researchers and academics must adhere to the constraints of a mainstream collection. Apart from obvious analytical abilities, authors are expected to write quality text and a sensitivity to illustration. A &quot;Découvertes&quot; is not a book of authorship, the author is only one of the many speakers. Bruno Blasselle, director of the Bibliothèque de l&#x27;Arsenal, author of two volumes of (&#x27;History of Book&#x27;, and ), and co-author of the title , explained his experience of working for the collection: &quot;For an author, to write a &quot;Découvertes&quot; title is to be trapped, to put oneself in a situation of being obliged to go beyond his/her own formulation.&quot;


The cover design is one of the specificities. The old covers are glossy with black background illustrated in colour, the newer covers are matt-laminated rather than glossy, but more colourful, with different colour codes according to the subject matter. It differs from other reference books by its visual: a full-size picture, with its framing and the power of figurative elements, also a picture well-matched to the inside page layout, with a tiny, relevant picture illustrating the spine. The visual identity is strong, one can even easily recognise the collection&#x27;s international editions. However, there are some exceptions, for instance, the Barcelonese publisher Ediciones B adopted a completely different cover design for their collection .
Each title contains 128–224 pages with approximately 120–220 illustrations printed in four, five, six, or seven colours, both matte and glitter, and sometimes even gold, as in the title , the metallic gold heightens Carl Otto Czeschka&#x27;s illustrations from . Each book begins with 8–10 full-page illustrations or photographs, prefaced by a pull-quote on the inside front cove, which Thames &amp; Hudson director Jamie Camplin calls it a &quot;cinema-influenced trailer&quot; (designated as &quot;pré-générique&quot; in French). For the title &quot;&quot;, this book opens with a succession of reproductions of Champollion&#x27;s manuscript &quot;Grammaire égyptienne&quot;; in &quot;L&#x27;Europe des Celtes&quot; (), the reader is greeted by a series of bronze masks and hoary faces carved in stone; the &quot;trailer&quot; for () evokes the tragic launch of the Space Shuttle &quot;Challenger&quot; in 1986; while that of () presents the Eiffel Tower at every stage of its construction.
The novelty lies in the subtle orchestration of the text and the illustration, where successive sequences, inserts and foldouts overlapping in double pages. According to the subject, the body text (designated as in French) is structured into three to eight chapters, consisting of 64 (in the case of the title ) to 128 pages (most of the titles). Each chapter is built using journalistic methods, with a lead paragraph and intertitle. The is punctuated by double-page spreads of images, known as inserts, sort of a halt for pictures. For the title (&#x27;Fear of Wolves&#x27;), two double-page spreads of reproductions of Gustave Doré&#x27;s engravings to illustrate &quot;Little Red Riding Hood&quot;. These books benefit a lot from journalistic and cinematographic techniques, some titles include panoramic foldouts, kind of projection on big screen. Two foldouts in the title , one showing Léon Jaussely&#x27;s reconstruction of the forum of Pompeii, the other representing the actual condition of the theatre quarter in 1859 by using Paul-Émile Bonnet&#x27;s drawings, both in a panoramic view. In the title (&#x27;The Paper: A Daily Adventure&#x27;), through a partnership with paper companies, there are even three luxurious foldouts that all made on different papers from Arjo Wiggins, presenting one of the century watercolours on the traditional manufacture of Chinese paper; the other of the engravings and drawings by Albrecht Dürer and Leonardo da Vinci; the third depicts today&#x27;s paper production line with its different machines.

Unlike the in colour, the second part—the &quot;Documents&quot; section ()—is always printed in black and white. It works as an anthology, providing more specialised texts from relevant authors, excerpts, historical records, among others. It contains files made jointly by the author or the publisher, with lead paragraph to link texts and short captions for each file. According to the subject, an annex concludes &quot;Documents&quot; section with a chronology, a filmography, a discography or a bibliography, with a &quot;List of Illustrations&quot; () giving full details of the sources of illustrations, an alphabetical index, as well as photo credits, dedicated to those who want to go deeper into the subject.

The collection also stands out for its attention to detail. On the choice of typeface, for example, Trump Mediaeval for body text, ITC Franklin Gothic for titling, Zapf Dingbats for guillemets, italic for captions with an initial and the last line is underlined, et cetera. The French editions are printed by Kapp Lahure Jombart in Évreux, while the Italian printer Gianni Stavro, who has largely contributed to the elaboration of new techniques used in the collection, retains his position as collaborator for international reissues and coeditions. The bindings are solid, sewn and not glued. As Gallimard&#x27;s promise to their readers, &quot;the most beautiful pocket collection in the world&quot; ().

The collection formerly consisted of eighteen series—, , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , and —which have been abandoned, it is now reorganised around seven major subjects with colour codes: (red), (brown), (blue), (white), (dark blue), (yellow) and (green).

== History ==

&quot;Découvertes Gallimard&quot; was born in Gallimard Jeunesse, based on an idea by Pierre Marchand after the publications of two pocket collections: &quot;Découvertes Cadet&quot; in 1983 and &quot;Découvertes Benjamin&quot; in 1984. These three Découvertes collections cater to three levels: grades 4 to 6 (&quot;Découvertes Benjamin&quot;), grades 7 to 9 (&quot;Découvertes Cadet&quot;), and grades 10 and up (&quot;Découvertes Gallimard&quot;). This pocket encyclopaedia initially named (&#x27;The Paths of Knowledge&#x27;), Pierre Marchand already had the idea when he entered Gallimard in 1972, as he explained: &quot;I have invested fourteen years of my professional life in this collection. Thanks to the success of &#x27;choose your own adventure books&#x27; that we were able to embark on this adventure. [...] For the first time, genuine encyclopaedias in pocket format. [...] Our bet is that once you open the book, no matter what subject you read or which page you are on, you can no longer close it.&quot; Françoise Balibar, Jean-Pierre Maury, Jean-Pierre Verdet, Marc Meunier-Thouret and some others were the first to experience this pharaonic project that would await the arrival of Élisabeth de Farcy and Paule du Bouchet, in 1981, for truly to take shape. To producing genuine encyclopaedias in pocket format and fully illustrated in colour, in that time, many judged such an editorial project insane. In November 1986, however, the collection was released at Gallimard and directed by Élisabeth de Farcy. She chose authors and organised iconographic campaigns, several editors and iconographers were then gathered, copious &quot;iconographies&quot; (illustrations) were extracted from heritage resources. Élisabeth explained in an interview with : &quot;The image should occupy a central place, as in a work of art.&quot; The authors were sceptical about this project at first, even contemptuous, but they have eventually been fascinated by the collection. Some have even authored several books, such as Françoise Cachin, curator of the Musée d&#x27;Orsay, author of three books – (), (), (); the physicist Jean-Pierre Maury, who wrote four titles – (), (), () and (); or the historian of religion , who published seven books in the collection.

A preview edition, or &quot;zero edition&quot; () was sent to 500 booksellers during the summer of 1986. The collection was officially released on 21 November of the same year. The first twelve titles, twenty-five thousand copies of each volume were printed. &quot;We&#x27;ve never seen so many things between the first and last pages of a book&quot; is the slogan proposed by Pascal Manry&#x27;s advertising agency CLM BBDO for the launch of the collection. Without market research at the start, Pierre Marchand, a self-taught man, explained on the television programme &quot;&quot;: &quot;This project was as old as my thirst for knowledge. No doubt it is necessary to be precisely self-taught to sense the importance of an encyclopaedia. We must have been forced to build our own culture, to seek reliable references, to make clear statements. To conceive &#x27;Découvertes&#x27;, I didn&#x27;t need market research, surveys or tests. Right from the start, I wanted to give the public the books I needed.&quot; Although &quot;Découvertes&quot; was reserved for youth at the beginning, it was eventually launched for the general adult public. The collection then had a rapid-growth, 105 titles appeared in five years. The first international collaboration was started with the Madrid-based Spanish publisher in 1989, and 19 countries would finally be associated with the project. In 1992, after 151 titles have been published, Gallimard showed interest in the work on mermaid and Siren () by , a Belgian Dutch-language writer. Nevertheless, the Parisian publishing house hesitated, &quot;interesting subject, but how can you illustrate that?&quot; Then De Donder showed a list of about one thousand images that he gathered over years, Gallimard was convinced and made him the first non-French-language author published in the collection.

In the heyday of &quot;Découvertes&quot; at the turn of the 1990s, authors were mainly recruited from academics and curators. Numerous artist monographs were often published on the occasions of major exhibitions, with a predilection for painters and musicians. Such as the title was released for the exhibition &quot;Henri Matisse 1904–1917&quot; at the Centre Georges Pompidou in 1993; and Geneviève Haroche-Bouzinac&#x27;s &quot;Élisabeth Vigée Le Brun&quot; (from &quot;Hors série&quot;) was on sale at the exhibit of Vigée Le Brun&#x27;s paintings in New York City at the Metropolitan Museum of Art. Or reactivity in relation to current events, for instance, the title &quot;&quot; was published on 5 January 1993 for the release of Francis Coppola&#x27;s &quot;Dracula&quot; in France; and () for the release of the French film &quot;Germinal&quot;; () for the of the CNAM; () was on sale on the occasion of &quot;Yves Saint Laurent retrospective&quot; at the Petit Palais in 2010. Some works were launched within an extremely limited time frame, such as (), for the inauguration of the Louvre Pyramid in 1989; and () for the Opéra Bastille in 1990, both completed in six to eight weeks instead of the usual two or three months. Alongside many works dictated by current events, there are also a number of &quot;strange curiosities&quot;, such as a book devoted to red hair ( – ), which is unusual in this type of collection. Some subjects can be more difficult to sell but considered necessary, such as the perspective ( – ), images of human body ( – ) and mannerism ( – ). But in recent years, there were more monographs on memoirs of places and large institutions instead of artists, as well as various sociological and religious aspects, for instance, a book on the history of New York City by Jerome Charyn, which is translated and adapted from his English work &quot;Metropolis: New York as Myth, Marketplace, and Magical Land&quot; ( – ); titles on agrifood ( – ), on homosexuality ( – ), or on drugs ( – ); titles about Marian devotions and apparition ( – &amp; – ), about Christian saints and Sufism ( – &amp; – ). And also numerous volumes devoted to writers, for example, the title .

Difficult subjects were frequently in demand, possibly because there was less competition. Thus a book on the Cistercian monks ( – ) was one of the bestsellers in 1990. While the others like (, about gold rush) or (, about pirates) are presumably subjects more common and popular, were relative failures. Generally, the most popular titles are those from and series, the title &quot;À la recherche de l&#x27;Égypte oubliée&quot; and the title &quot;&quot;—both in series—remain two of the bestsellers. As of 2001, the former would have sold more than five hundred thousand copies worldwide. As for the series, there are only four most favoured titles: (), (), () and (). Competition has emerged as early as in the middle of the 1990s, with a gradual decrease in circulation and novelties, but partially offset by the sub-collection entitled , which is one of the five spin-offs.

Today, about fifteen old titles are updated every year according to current cultural and scientific research. As general history plays a central role in &quot;Découvertes Gallimard&quot;, completed by archaeology, art history and science, richly accompanied by unpublished illustrations, thus it forms a solid editorial base. On 25 March 1994, a celebration was held at the Musée national des Monuments Français, for the publication of the title . The collection experienced two successive redesigns, one in September 1998 ( – ) for exterior model (colour of the back cover, more explicit signage), and the other in March 2000 ( – ) for interior page layout. Those reeditions underwent a decrease in page length, due to the reformulation introduced in the &quot;Documents&quot; section. The collection, which was too soon associated with a zapping visual culture, reaffirmed its first purpose: the image does not take precedence over the text, but combined with text to animate and enrich the reading. These books benefit from the latest technologies, with their mockups are all made using desktop publishing now. Since the QuarkXPress software was only released in 1987, the first 30 titles were made in a traditional way, with phototypesetting. The current price of a &quot;Découvertes&quot; book is between 8.40 and 15.90 euros (£7.95 in UK, $12.95–$14.95 in US and $19.95 in Canada) according to its category and number of pages, this is considered an extremely low price for a book of this quality.
The collection, totalling 588 volumes, is never entirely translated into another language, partial translations have been made available in 19 languages (currently more than 20 languages, see &quot;International editions&quot;). &quot;This inexpensive pocket encyclopaedia embodies its humanistic dream: to make the most advanced state of knowledge available to everyone. Diderot and D&#x27;Alembert would not have denied it...&quot;, commented by Hedwige Pasquet, current directress of Gallimard Jeunesse. According to &#x27;, these &quot;French-style nonfictions&quot; () have sold over twenty million copies worldwide as of 1999, with recently emerging markets in Asia and Eastern Europe, especially in Russia, about 100 titles have been published within four years. In 2002, during a presentation of &quot;Découvertes Gallimard&quot; in Moscow, the French ambassador to Russia Claude Blanchemaison told a Kommersant correspondent that he just finished reading &#x27; (), one of the latest titles from the collection at the time, which he found particularly interesting.

In order to remedy the problems of international proprietaries and reproduction rights of works of art, co-publishers firstly define a number of titles, then they choose according to their own editorial line, and share the high cost of worldwide photographic rights. Therefore, Harry N. Abrams in the United States chose more titles on traditional cultural subjects, such as &quot;À la recherche de la Rome antique&quot; () or &quot;La Naissance de la Grèce&quot; (); while in Japan, the publisher prefers original titles, such as the title (&#x27;Witches: Fiancées of Satan&#x27;), and the title (&#x27;The Hour of the Great Passage: Chronicle of Death&#x27;). The Madrilenian publisher Aguilar was the first one among &quot;Découvertes&quot;&#x27; international co-publishers since 1989, the first 12 titles for the Spanish collection were released in the same year. In Italy, the publisher Electa/Gallimard produced 128 titles within seven years; in Japan, the title for their series (&#x27;Rediscovery of Knowledge&#x27;) has been published in early 2017. In addition, foreign editions are usually co-printed to amortise fees and support countries with small circulation.

In addition to foreign publishers, &quot;Découvertes Gallimard&quot; has also been involved in national institutional partnerships for several years, notably the one held since 1989 with the Réunion des Musées Nationaux (RMN): thirty-two titles have been released (as of 2001), plus a title in English dedicated to Jean-Baptiste-Camille Corot ( – &quot;Corot: Extraordinary landscapes&quot;), the boxed set (1994) and four books in the &quot;Hors série&quot;. The principle of these co-editions is based on a sharing of costs and revenues, the RMN brings its knowledge of museums and distribution network, while the publisher brings its editorial competence. When a title is linked to an exhibition, it generates a lot of additional sales through the RMN. Other partnerships with public or private companies, such as the French Alternative Energies and Atomic Energy Commission ( – ), Crédit Mutuel ( – ), L&#x27;Oréal ( – ), paper industries ( – ), et cetera. The partner is sometimes explicitly indicated in the &quot;acknowledgments&quot; (), but it is most often mentioned equivocally (), even modestly kept in silence ( – ).

Nonfiction book publishing has been in decline in France for several years, market saturation is one of the causes, competition from other medias is another, especially from the internet. Despite its excellent image to the public, &quot;Découvertes Gallimard&quot; is also concerned by this disaffection. It remains an indisputable success internationally, but in France, the sales are eroding. The number of new productions decreases and also the prints. On 1 March 1999, the creator of &quot;Découvertes&quot;, Pierre Marchand, after working for 27 years at Gallimard, left to become a creative director at Hachette. This was no doubt a big loss to the collection, but with more than 10 years of experience and a rich fund created over years, &quot;Découvertes&quot; finally surpassed the difficulties. The end of 2006 is marked by the celebration of the collection&#x27;s anniversary and the publication of its title . A website was specially created on this occasion, which is the current official website &quot;http://www.decouvertes-gallimard.fr&quot;. On the occasion of Éditions Gallimard&#x27;s centenary in 2011, the title (&#x27;Gallimard: A Publisher at Work&#x27;) was launched as the first e-book for iPad of &quot;Découvertes&quot;. This was followed by an e-book collection consisting of &quot;À la recherche de l&#x27;Égypte oubliée&quot;, , , &quot;Léonard de Vinci : Art et science de l&#x27;univers&quot;, and in the next year.

== Image ==

Image (illustration, designated as in French) is the essential part to &quot;Découvertes Gallimard&quot;, the collection draws much inspiration from magazine layout designs. Full colour pictures, documentary illustrations, archival photographs, historical maps occupy a central place in this work, as said Pierre Marchand himself: &quot;the language of images is a universal language&quot;. But in the 1980s, desktop publishing and photo digitisation did not exist, the sophisticated mockups were entirely handmade and the iconographers ran around museums, libraries, painting galleries and other agencies to look for documents. Today, the technology has simplified all these procedures but the difficulty lies elsewhere, the status of the image is increasingly complex.

Contemporary subjects often generate much higher costs since the publisher is obliged to work with photographic agencies. In the choice of documents, priority is given to those original, unpublished images. Besides, the iconographers of &quot;Découvertes&quot; have some exceptional documents, such as English explorer Frederick Catherwood&#x27;s original drawings of Maya ruins decorate the title &quot;Les cités perdues des Mayas&quot;.

It&#x27;s not difficult to illustrate subjects like arts, civilisations, archaeology... But when it comes to a topic like &quot;pain&quot; ( – ) or &quot;sustainable development&quot; ( – ), it becomes more delicate. The question is how to avoid repetitiveness or the flatly illustrative image, the solution lies in a broadening field, through the use of historical documents, works of art and film stills.

== Case study of aestheticisation movement ==
The of postmodern everyday life, according to sociologists Michel Maffesoli and Mike Featherstone, it seems to spring from two parallel movements rooted in modernity, the so-called &quot;dual postmodern aestheticisation movement&quot;: first an aesthetic hedonism (Maffesoli) and second the trivialisation of art (Featherstone). The second movement is the result of the de-academisation and de-institutionalisation of art, thus &quot;art is part of everyday life&quot;. &quot;Découvertes Gallimard&quot; is considered an example of &#x27;art as part of everyday life&#x27; within this study.

Pierre Marchand, Head of Gallimard Jeunesse who created the new kind of artistic encyclopaedia with a dynamic layout, that would be as much a magazine as an encyclopaedia. It has been commented by a Gallimard employee that Découvertes &quot;seduces like a magazine but has the length of a book&quot;, kind of an objectified and specialised luxury magazine. A lot of work and research have been done on the reproduction of images and the choice of illustrations, often unpublished documents like antique engravings, old photos, on all types of themes. In this collection, all books share the same concept as to layout and looks, each book itself could become a work of art rather than only its substitute. It is coupled with up-to-date editing equipment, organisational innovations and a constant pursuit of higher printing quality at lower cost. A more friendship than business relationship between Marchand and the Italian printer Gianni Stavro has advanced the state of the art in printing. The suppliers of &quot;Découvertes&quot; are supposed to cooperate between themselves, &quot;for instance, the French printer had a problem concerning the pigments, so the Italian printer invited him over to explain how he could solve the problem&quot;, explained by a Gallimard employee.

Pierre Marchand might not be an &quot;Artistic Master&quot;, but he is almost considered as such by his employees. &quot;Découvertes&quot;&#x27; staff work like a team, where everybody is concerned with everything at the same time. They share the same culture and values, their office is intentionally built like a vessel, with Marchand as captain on the bridge, and anyone, at any time, is free to contribute with his/her own ideas about authors, pictures, front covers..., and becomes leader of a project.

== Spin-offs ==
* : Literally &#x27;Another History of the Century&#x27;. A closed series within &quot;Découvertes Gallimard&quot; collection released in 1999, consisting of ten volumes for ten decades, authored by French historian and based on the Gaumont cinematographic archives.
* : A sub-collection published since 1994, the title roughly translates as &#x27;off-series&#x27; or &#x27;off-collection&#x27;. &quot;Hors série&quot; books are even smaller (120 × 170 mm, generally, but not always), each one consists of 48 pages with full colour illustrations. These books are designed like museum guide booklets, according to Gallimard, &quot;&quot; (&#x27;books to visit like an exhibition&#x27;). Most of them are dedicated to artists like Botticelli, Arcimboldo, Fragonard, Soutine, Le Gray, et cetera, during major exhibitions devoted to them.
* : A sub-collection consists of 13 volumes, 12 volumes released in 1992 and one in 1994, a larger format (210 × 270 mm) is used for them.
* : A 6-volume sub-collection released in 1998 (124 × 178 mm), inspired by the &quot;Documents&quot; section at the back of every &quot;Découvertes&quot; book.
* : A sub-collection of exhibition booklets created in 2018, with the smaller format (120 × 170 mm).

The &quot;Hors série&quot; books are often coupled with art exhibitions and it works well. While the other attempts to diversify the collection have often resulted in resounding commercial failures, such as the &quot;Albums&quot; and &quot;Texto&quot;. Despite an interesting concept: the use of still images from Gaumont archives for &quot;Une autre histoire du XXe siècle&quot;, this series has had mixed success.

== English edition ==
A small portion of the collection has been translated into English, published by Thames &amp; Hudson in United Kingdom under the title New Horizons series, which launched its first titles in 1992 with the slogan, &quot;the expanding universe between two covers&quot;. According to Thames &amp; Hudson director Jamie Camplin, the remit is to &quot;educate in an entertaining way&quot;.

Paul Gottlieb, former director and editor in chief of the New York-based publisher Abrams Books (then called Harry N. Abrams), discovered Pierre Marchand&#x27;s &quot;Découvertes&quot; at the Gallimard stand during the Bologna Book Fair in 1991, which he called &quot;a dazzling array of books&quot; and an &quot;imaginative combination of text and pictures in a magnificently produced series of paperback books&quot;. He began to negotiate for English language translation. The collection was eventually titled Abrams Discoveries series by the U.S. publisher. They began to publish in the spring of 1992, and more than 100 titles were produced by 2008.

The two publishers shared the translation costs, the American edition was then re-edited to take into account English spelling, or vice versa. Unlike the numbered French edition, American and British editions are not put into numerical order. UK edition&#x27;s book spines have titles in white with black background, while the more Gallimard-style US edition has titles in colour and sometimes with decorative features, such as an for &quot;Cleopatra: The Life and Death of a Pharaoh&quot; and a for &quot;Heraldry: An Introduction to a Noble Tradition&quot;.

Apart from spelling and punctuation differences, certain titles of American edition have additional explanation placed in parentheses within the body text. For instance, in &quot;The Celts: Conquerors of Ancient Europe&quot;: &quot;Bohemia (now part of the Czech Republic)&quot; (), &quot;Gaelic (meaning an Irish or Scottish Celt)&quot; (), or &quot;Iberian Peninsula (Spain and Portugal)&quot; (); whereas in the British version &quot;The Celts: First Masters of Europe&quot;, has no such additional information. Besides, the texts are not entirely identical. As for the &quot;Documents&quot; section, though some co-publishers print the entire French version, Thames &amp; Hudson reformulates this part, tailoring the material to suit the nuances of the UK market.

== Reception ==
French weekly magazine &quot;Télérama&quot; praised &quot;Découvertes Gallimard&quot;, described the work as: &quot;they borrow suspense from the cinema, have efficiency of the journalism, literary temperament is their charm, and art is their beauty&quot;. &quot;New York&quot; magazine remarked the collection &quot;a lively interweaving of simple text and clever pictures&quot;. In his review for &quot;Die Zeit&quot;, the German literary scholar and historian wrote that the collection is an &quot;adventure stands for surprise, excitement and amusement. Boredom is already prevented by the curiosity of vivid illustrations which are accompanied by detailed explanations&quot;. Rick Poynor wrote in &quot;Eye&quot; magazine that the collection &quot;is one of the great projects of contemporary popular publishing&quot;. Raleigh Trevelyan&#x27;s article in &quot;The New York Times&quot; mentioned &quot;D-Day and the Invasion of Normandy&quot; from &quot;Abrams Discoveries&quot; series, said &quot;all volumes in the &#x27;Discoveries&#x27; series are ingeniously designed&quot;. Art critic John Russell considered these books contain unique information, such as Aelian&#x27;s authority on the musicality of the elephant or the precise look of Halley&#x27;s Comet as it was depicted in 1835. Eduardo Gudiño Kieffer of &quot;La Nación&quot; also gave the collection a positive review, writing, &quot;The books are excellent assistants for intellectuals, writers, journalists and students of different aspects of the culture, [...] they contain accurate and pithy information. [...] They obtain a cognitive &#x27;duration&#x27; difficult to achieve in the mediatic fugacity.&quot; The Spanish newspaper &quot;El País&quot;: &quot;Those books combine an important &#x27;Documents&#x27; section with an original thematic concept. It&#x27;s obviously a work of education and popularisation, but popularisation of very good level.&quot; The Brazilian newspapers – &quot;Folha de S.Paulo&quot;: &quot;What is most striking in the collection, however, is not the eclecticism or the unusual themes—usually developed by French experts—but the format and the iconographic content thereof.&quot;; &quot;&quot;: &quot;almost like a luxury comic magazine and of exquisite taste&quot;.

According to the French magazine &quot;L&#x27;Expansion&quot;, some other positive reviews including &quot;The Times&quot;: &quot;A brand-new and daring collection&quot;; &quot;Die Zeit&quot;: &quot;As soon as you open these handy books, you can not get away from them anymore&quot;; &quot;The New York Times Book Review&quot;: &quot;A collection that recalls nineteenth-century encyclopaedias, where intelligence went hand in hand with curiosity&quot;. The French news magazine &quot;L&#x27;Express&quot;: &quot;Genuine monographs, published like art books, offered in pocket format and sold at an affordable price. [...] &#x27;Découvertes&#x27; changed the face of encyclopaedism and art book, adapting the book to the era of &#x27;zapping&#x27;.&quot; &#x27;—a French bimonthly journal—referred to the collection as a &quot;classic&quot;. It is also included by &#x27;, a French weekly magazine, as one of six collections that marked the history of French publishing.

Despite all the favours to its quality and attractive visual design, the collection suffers from a problem of identity in bookshops: where to put these books? With books for youth or books for adults? As pocket books or human science reference books? And opt for a thematic scattering on the shelves. Many booksellers renounce the displays that were exclusively reserved for &quot;Découvertes&quot; due to high competition. All the more so because a rather tight inventory management at Gallimard, the complete titles are never available at the same time, which is not appreciated by the customers. The problem of identification is also latent in print media, the journalists, even if they are personally delighted to receive the new titles from a press agent, would not be too enthusiastic about presenting a simple pocket book in their articles, even if it&#x27;s a brand new title and not a reprint.

<text>Linda Taylor Miller (born August 18, 1953) is an American soap opera actress.

== Early life and education ==
Miller was born in New Orleans, Louisiana. She was raised in Rochester, New York and also lived with her family in Fort Worth, Texas for a time. Miller moved frequently during her formative years due to her father&#x27;s work as a pollution control specialist. She studied history at the H. Sophie Newcomb Memorial College at Tulane University from 1971 to 1975, joining the Chi Omega sorority.

==Career==
Miller modeled in New York City for a short time before she was discovered. She had her first audition for the role of Nina Cortlandt and began appearing on &quot;All My Children&quot; only months after her arrival.

She is best known for her role as Nina Cortlandt on ABC Daytime&#x27;s &quot;All My Children&quot; (&quot;AMC&quot;), which she played from 1979 to 1984 and from 1986 to 1989. Miller returned in cameos in 1994, 1995, 1996, and 2010 (40th Anniversary Episode). She returned with Gillian Spencer, who played Nina&#x27;s mother, on April 20, 2010, for the tribute to Palmer Cortlandt (James Mitchell). Her pairing with Peter Bergman&#x27;s Dr. Cliff Warner was arguably the first supercouple on the soap.

During a break from &quot;All My Children&quot;, she played Sally Frame on &quot;Another World&quot; (1985–1986). She also appeared in the NBC series &quot;Knight Rider&quot;.

On February 2, 2017, Miller made a surprise appearance on the Hallmark Channel&#x27;s &quot;Home &amp; Family&quot; show, where she was reunited with a number of her former &quot;All My Children&quot; castmates.

== Personal life ==
In 1988, Miller married Eli Tullis Jr., also a native of New Orleans. She currently resides in Chicago, Illinois. After her two children went to college, Miller was inspired to make a career transition into the health and wellness field.

<doc id="788782" wikidata="Q644973" url="?curid=788782" title="Democratic Rally">
<text>The Democratic Rally (, ΔΗΣΥ, DISY) is a Christian democratic and liberal-conservativepolitical party in Cyprus led by Annita Demetriou. The party was founded on 4 July 1976 by veteran politician Glafcos Clerides. Two leaders of the party have served as presidents of Cyprus, Clerides from 1993 until 2003 and Nicos Anastasiades from 2013 to 2023.

From 11 March 2023, the leader of the party is Annita Demetriou, who also serves as the president of the House of Representatives since June 2021.

== Background ==
DISY serves a widely diverse spectrum of voters, ranging from hard-line Greek Cypriot nationalists and anti-communists to humanist liberals with post-materialist and post-modern values who advocate human rights. DISY&#x27;s platform focuses on free enterprise economic policies, lower direct taxes and higher indirect taxes, economic development, opposing government deficits, investments in infrastructure, and a practical solution to the Cyprus dispute (though the party base is traditionally more hawkish and hard-line than the party leadership). It is the most explicitly Atlanticist and pro-NATO of Cyprus&#x27;s parties, and draws its support from middle-class professionals, businessmen, and white-collar employees.
== History ==

=== Origins ===
The Democratic Rally (DISY) emerged from the split of the right-wing &quot;Eniaion&quot; into two opposing parties. Following the Turkish invasion and the 1974 coup d&#x27;état, internal conflicts within Eniaion led to the creation of DISY, led by Glafkos Clerides, and DIKO, led by Spyros Kyprianou. The newly established DISY was a pro-Western and anti-communist party, that brought together the moderate centre-right and former EOKA B sympathisers, both of whom opposed the return of Archbishop Makarios to the presidency. Founded in 1976, DISY&#x27;s logo is the Nike of Paionios.

=== 1976–1981: Defeat by the Democratic Powers alliance ===
In the 1976 legislative election, the newly-established Democratic Rally (DISY) formed an alliance with the far-right Democratic National Party (DEK) to oppose the ruling president, Makarios III. This coalition ran against the governing parties, which had united under the alliance named &quot;Democratic Powers&quot; in support of the president. 

The Democratic Powers alliance, composed of DIKO, AKEL, and EDEK, won 34 out of the 35 seats. The independent candidate, Tassos Papadopoulos, secured the remaining seat. The DISY-DEK alliance failed to win any seats, leaving them without representation in the parliament.

=== 1981–1993: Electoral breakthrough ===
Five years after its electoral defeat, in the 1981 legislative election, DISY secured 12 seats in the House of Representatives, establishing itself as the official opposition to Spyros Kyprianou&#x27;s government. The party received 31.8% of the popular vote, winning the same number of seats as AKEL, which garnered 32.7% and finished first. This election marked the first time that former EOKA fighters entered the Cypriot parliament.

The Democratic Rally participated in presidential elections for the first time in 1983, supporting its president and founder, Glafcos Clerides. Clerides faced the incumbent president, Spyros Kyprianou, and the leader of EDEK, Vassos Lyssarides. Kyprianou was supported by the alliance of DIKO and AKEL. Clerides finished second with 33.9% of the vote and lost in the first round, with Kyprianou securing victory with 56.4% of the vote.

The electoral power of the Democratic Rally continued to grow, and in the 1985 legislative election, it finished first, securing 19 out of the 52 seats. In the 1988 presidential election, Glafcos Clerides led in the first round with 33.3% of the votes but narrowly lost in the second round to independent candidate George Vassiliou, who was supported by AKEL. In the 1991 legislative election, the party finished first again and gained one more seat, bringing their total to 20 seats in the House of Representatives.

=== 1993–2003: Clerides Presidency of Cyprus ===
In the second round of the 1993 presidential election, Glafcos Clerides narrowly defeated the incumbent president, George Vassiliou. Following his victory, Clerides extended an open invitation to all political parties to form a coalition government. After several days of negotiations, a majority government was established, consisting of the DISY and DIKO. Clerides did not seek re-election for the party leadership, and as a result, on June 11, 1993, Yiannakis Matsis became the president of the Democratic Rally, running unopposed. Matsis reassured that the party would continue supporting the government of its founder, Glafcos Clerides.Clerides prioritised the admission of Cyprus into the European Economic Community (EEC), the predecessor of the European Union, and aimed to hold a United Nations National Conference to address the Cyprus problem. Faced with a high budget deficit inherited from the previous administration, Clerides&#x27; finance minister implemented measures to reduce public spending and increase taxation.

During his presidency, Clerides engaged in multiple discussions with Rauf Denktaş, the &quot;president&quot; of the self-proclaimed Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus, to address the Cyprus problem. Clerides sought greater involvement from the United States in resolving the issue, which he conveyed to President Bill Clinton during their meeting in New York. Additionally, Clerides had a notable disagreement with British Foreign Minister Douglas Hurd over his stance on the Cyprus issue.

On June 7, 1997, Yiannakis Matsis, President of the Democratic Rally, expressed his serious dissatisfaction with president Clerides for not listening to the party&#x27;s input. He also criticised his party for failing to produce substantial policy proposals and for the vindictive behaviour of some members. In protest, he withdrew his candidacy for re-election as president of DISY. Nicos Anastasiades competed with Demetris Syllouris for the party leadership and won the election with 69% of the vote.

During his first five-year term, Clerides lost the support of his coalition partner, DIKO, which instead backed his opponent, Georgios Iacovou, in the 1998 presidential election. Despite being supported by both AKEL and DIKO, Iacovou lost the election, with Clerides winning a second term with 50.8% of the vote in the second round. Although Clerides aimed to create an all-party government, AKEL and DIKO strongly opposed his invitation and positioned themselves as &quot;strong opposition&quot; parties. After discussions with multiple party leaders, a coalition government was formed between DISY, EDEK and United Democrats (EDI). 

During 1997–1998, Clerides&#x27; government made the decision to acquire Russian-made S-300 missile systems, heightening tensions with Turkey, which threatened military action in response. The crisis ended in December 1998 when Cyprus relocated the missiles to Greece. The so-called Cypriot S-300 crisis led to the dissolution of the coalition government, leaving only DISY and EDI remaining in the coalition.

During his second term, Clerides actively pursued Cyprus&#x27;s admission to the European Union, engaging in numerous official accession talks.

Clerides had announced that he would not seek re-election for a third term. However, on January 3, 2003, he urged Cypriots to grant him an additional 16-month term to pursue a reunification deal with the self-proclaimed Northern Cyprus. Clerides called on other candidates to support him and form a national unity government to achieve this goal; however, his opponents did not agree to his proposal.

=== 2003: A fragmented presidential bid ===
In the 2003 presidential election, Glafcos Clerides sought an additional 16-month term to pursue a reunification deal. Although he had the official support of his party, a notable former DISY MP and Attorney General of Cyprus, Alecos Markides, opposed Clerides&#x27; candidacy and ran independently in the election. Markides garnered significant support from within DISY, including backing from 5 of the 19 DISY MPs, and secured 6.6% of the vote. Clerides received 38.8% in the first round, while Tassos Papadopoulos, supported by DIKO and AKEL, won the election outright with 51.5% of the vote, making DISY the official opposition.

Following the election results, DISY President Nicos Anastasiades immediately expelled the five MPs who had supported Markides from the party&#x27;s registry. These MPs included Demetris Syllouris, Prodromos Prodromou, Riccos Erotokritou, Eleni Vrahimi, and Sofoklis Hatziyiannis. Anastasiades strongly criticised them for undermining Clerides&#x27; candidacy and contributing to the party&#x27;s electoral defeat. The five expelled members condemned Anastasiades&#x27; action and demanded his resignation, warning of a &quot;civil war&quot; within the party.

=== 2004: DISY Splits into Three over the Annan Plan ===
On April 24, 2004, Cypriot voters participated in a referendum on the Annan Plan, which proposed the establishment of the United Republic of Cyprus as a federation of two states: Greek Cypriot and Turkish Cypriot. The plan outlined a federal government that would feature a collective Presidential Council, a bicameral legislature, a Supreme Court with equal representation from both communities, and mechanisms for reconciliation and troop reductions.

After an internal referendum, the Democratic Rally officially endorsed the Annan Plan, encouraging its voters to support it with a YES vote. Glafcos Clerides, who was 85, notably remarked that if the majority rejected the plan, he would prefer to die rather than witness the resulting devastating consequences.

The Democratic Rally was the only parliamentary party to support the Annan Plan, alongside the smaller United Democrats, leading to a vote against the referendum.

Despite the party&#x27;s official stance, a significant faction within DISY expressed opposition to the referendum, raising concerns about a potential split of the party. Former DISY president Yiannakis Matsis, who had previously clashed with Anastasiades&#x27; leadership, initiated plans to form a new political party called &quot;European Rally&quot;, receiving support from expelled MPs Prodromos Prodromou and Demetris Syllouris.

The opposers of the Annan Plan followed through on their threats by founding the alliance &quot;Rally For Europe&quot; in preparation for the 2004 European Parliament elections. Among the six candidates were Yiannakis Matsis, former president of DISY, along with Riccos Erotokritou and Prodromos Prodromou, all of whom were critical of Anastasiades&#x27; DISY leadership. The alliance also received support from expelled DISY MP and Parliamentary Spokesperson Demetris Syllouris, although he did not actively join it. The Democratic Rally contested the use of the term &quot;Rally&quot; in the alliance&#x27;s name, citing legal restrictions against other parties using it. Ultimately, the alliance was renamed &quot;For Europe&quot; and received 10.8% of the votes, with Matsis securing one of the six seats in the European Parliament. The Democratic Rally narrowly surpassed AKEL, winning two seats with 28.2% of the votes.

Following the elections, the &quot;For Europe&quot; alliance continued to distance itself from its parent party, DISY, and eventually evolved into a registered political party known as European Democracy (EvroDi). Despite initially endorsing the alliance, Demetris Syllouris refused to join EvroDi and promoted the foundation of a new political movement, the European Party (EVROKO).

In 2005, expelled DISY MP Syllouris proposed merging the right-wing parties EvroDi and New Horizons to form EVROKO. He gained support from New Horizons and from a significant faction of expelled DISY MPs and EvroDi members. However, Prodromos Prodromou, president of EvroDi, did not accept the merger proposal. This led to a split in EvroDi, with many of its members, including its vice-president Riccos Erotokritou, joining EVROKO.

The aftermath of the internal disagreements led to the split of DISY into three co-existing parties, each led by influential and notable figures who had played active roles during Clerides&#x27; administration.

=== 2006: Loss of voters to the European Party ===
In the 2006 legislative election, the Democratic Rally finished second to AKEL, securing 30.3% of the vote—its poorest performance since 1976. The European Party, led by expelled DISY MP Demetris Syllouris, garnered a notable 5.8% of the vote, drawing significant support away from DISY. European Democracy, the second splinter party, led by expelled DISY MP Prodromos Prodromou, received only 0.4% of the votes.
=== 2008: Another presidential defeat ===
After the defeat in the 2003 presidential election, the split of DISY into three parties over opposing views on the Annan Plan, and the loss to AKEL in the 2006 legislative election, the Democratic Rally sought a candidate with broad multi-party support for the 2008 presidential election. Their candidate, former Minister of Foreign Affairs and MEP Ioannis Kasoulidis, received backing from several small parties, including the splinter European Democracy. However, he failed to gain the support of the stronger EVROKO, which instead supported the incumbent Tassos Papadopoulos.

In the first round, Kasoulidis narrowly surpassed the leader of AKEL, Demetris Christofias. However, the Democratic Party, whose candidate Tassos Papadopoulos failed to advance to the second round, supported Christofias, resulting in Kasoulidis losing the election with 46.6% of the vote in the second round.

Following the election, Prodromos Prodromou, leader of the splinter party European Democracy, rejoined the Democratic Rally, effectively merging his party with it.

=== 2008–2013: Rising popularity as opposition to Christofias&#x27; administration ===
Following the defeat of Ioannis Kasoulidis in the 2008 presidential election, the Democratic Rally maintained its position as the main opposition party. The administration of President Demetris Christofias faced significant challenges that led to widespread protests, notably the Naval Base Explosion in Mari and the 2012–2013 Cypriot financial crisis. Opinion polls indicated that the Christofias&#x27; government was largely perceived as responsible for the economic downturn, resulting in low approval ratings by the end of his term.

The Democratic Rally capitalised on the prevailing dissatisfaction with the AKEL government, securing 34.3% of the votes in the 2011 legislative elections. Subsequent opinion polls suggested a strong likelihood of victory for the party in the 2013 presidential election.

=== 2013–2023: Anastasiades&#x27; turbulent presidency of Cyprus ===

An internal election was held within the Democratic Rally to select a candidate for the 2013 presidential election. The party president, Nikos Anastasiades won the election, receiving 86.7% of the votes, while his opponent, MEP Eleni Theocharous, received 13.3%.

Anastasiades campaigned on the public dissatisfaction with Christofias&#x27; handling of the economy, using the slogan &quot;Crises need Leaders&quot;, in reference to the financial crisis. He also received support from DIKO. In the first round of the election, Anastasiades secured 45.5% of the vote, nearly 20 percentage points ahead of AKEL-backed Stavros Malas. In the second round, Anastasiades won the presidency with 57.5% of the vote. His majority government was a coalition of DISY, DIKO and the splinter EVROKO.

Following Anastasiades&#x27; election, MP Averof Neofytou was elected as the new president of the Democratic Rally. Neofytou had previously served as Mayor of Polis (1992-1996) and as Minister of Communications and Works (1999-2003) in Clerides&#x27; administration.

Anastasiades inherited the 2012–2013 Cypriot financial crisis, forcing him to break his campaign promises and implement a strict banking bailout in collaboration with the European Union and the International Monetary Fund. The agreement, signed off by the Eurogroup, aimed to prevent the bankruptcy of Cyprus&#x27; main banks and avoid a potential euro exit. As a result of these broken promises, DIKO withdrew its support from the government, leading to the removal of its ministers from the cabinet. 

During his first term, Anastasiades oversaw the closure of Cyprus Popular Bank, Cyprus Cooperative Bank and Cyprus Airways. He also participated in critical negotiations regarding the Cyprus problem, including the Mont Pèlerin talks in November 2016 and the Crans-Montana talks in the summer of 2017. However, no agreement was reached between the two sides.

In November 2015, Eleni Theocharous, a two-term DISY MEP and paediatric surgeon who had contested Anastasiades for DISY&#x27;s presidential nomination in 2013, announced her resignation from the party. She cited disagreements over DISY&#x27;s stance on the Cyprus problem as the reason for her departure. Theocharous subsequently founded a new splinter party, the Solidarity Movement. In early 2016, the splinter party EVROKO, led by former DISY MP Demetris Syllouris, withdrew its support from Anastasiades&#x27; government and merged with Theocharous&#x27; Solidarity Movement ahead of the 2016 legislative election. This shift left Anastasiades with a minority government, supported solely by DISY.

In the 2016 legislative election, DISY received 30.7% of the votes and secured 18 seats, a decrease from the 20 seats won in the previous election. Theocharous&#x27; splinter party, Solidarity Movement, which had absorbed Syllouris&#x27; EVROKO, gained 5.2% and won 3 seats.

During his second term, Anastasiades confronted significant challenges, including the COVID-19 pandemic and the consequences of the Russian invasion of Ukraine, which he condemened. Despite these challenges, Anastasiades oversaw the implementation of the General Healthcare System and the establishment of a Minimum Wage.

During his presidency, Nicos Anastasiades was involved in multiple corruption scandals, including the Pandora papers, the Cyprus Confidential and the trilogy of Makarios Drousiotis&#x27; political thrillers. In 2024, Drousiotis&#x27; third publication, &quot;Mafia State,&quot; instigated a criminal investigation against Anastasiades, prompting the involvement of international legal practitioner Gabrielle Louise McIntyre.

=== 2023: DISY voters split over two candidates ===

In December 2021, the president of the Democratic Rally, Averof Neofytou, announced his candidacy for the 2023 presidential election, positioning himself as the official party nominee. However, his candidacy was challenged by Nikos Christodoulides, Anastasiades&#x27; Minister of Foreign Affairs, who also expressed his intention to seek DISY&#x27;s nomination. Following accusations of undermining his campaign, Christodoulides resigned from his ministerial role and subsequently declared his independent candidacy for the 2023 presidential election.

Nikos Christodoulides&#x27; independent candidacy created significant turmoil within the Democratic Rally. Averof Neofytou referred to Christodoulides as a &quot;traitor,&quot; alleging that he sought to divide the party. DISY expelled Christodoulides from its party register and attempted to distance itself from him. Despite this, Christodoulides, a prominent politician who secured official support from DIKO, EDEK, DIPA, and the DISY splinter party Solidarity Movement, led to a division among Democratic Rally voters. Early opinion polls indicated a near-even split among DISY supporters between Neofytou and Christodoulides.

Nikos Christodoulides used to be the absolute favourite to win the election, with approximately 50% of the public expressing support for him in May 2022, giving him a substantial 30-point lead over Averof Neofytou in the first round. Despite a decline in popularity over time, he retained a 6-point lead in the latest opinion polls. Throughout his campaign, Christodoulides was generally hesitant to criticise the 10-year administration of Nicos Anastasiades, often stating that his approach would focus on continuing successful policies while aiming to improve or abolish those that had not produced the desired outcomes.Nicos Christodoulides announced his intention to form a national unity government, consisting of ministers from all political parties and free from political opposition. This proposal was promptly rejected by Averof Neofytou, who stated that the Democratic Rally would not participate in any government led by Christodoulides and, should DISY lose the election, the responsible course of action would be to respect the will of the electorate and assume a constructive role in opposition.

During the Democratic Rally&#x27;s contentious presidential campaign, a significant portion of party members expressed support for Nikos Christodoulides. There were even allegations that President Nicos Anastasiades was covertly undermining Averof Neofytou&#x27;s candidacy in favor of Christodoulides. This internal division intensified, leading influential figures, including former parliamentary candidates Pantelis Poietis and Konstantinos Letybiotis, to resign from DISY and endorse Christodoulides.

Averof Neofytou finished third in the first round of the election, receiving 26.1% of the votes, the lowest share in the history of the Democratic Rally. This outcome marked the first instance in which a DISY candidate did not advance to the second round of a presidential election. In the second round, DISY opted not to endorse any candidate officially, although several prominent party members expressed their support. Notable endorsements for Nikos Christodoulides came from President Nicos Anastasiades, Education Minister Prodromos Prodromou, former Health Minister Constantinos Ioannou, and Parliamentary Spokesperson Nicos Tornaritis. In contrast, AKEL-backed Andreas Mavroyiannis received backing from Averof Neofytou, Foreign Minister Ioannis Kasoulidis, and former MP Kaiti Clerides, the daughter of party founder Glafkos Clerides.

The second round of the election resulted in an equal division among the DISY electorate between Andreas Mavroyiannis and Nikos Christodoulides, the latter of whom was viewed by some, including Averof Neofytou, as a &quot;renegade&quot;. Nikos Christodoulides ultimately won the election with 52.0% of the vote in the second round, incorporating a faction of DISY members into his government.

=== 2023 – present: A disoriented opposition to Christodoulides&#x27; administration ===
Following the defeat in the 2023 presidential election and the internal divisions resulting from Nikos Christodoulides&#x27; independent candidacy, three politicians announced their intention to run for the presidency of the Democratic Rally. Averof Neofytou, seeking a third term, was set to compete against former Minister of Finance Harris Georgiadis and MP Demetris Demetriou. However, to prevent further conflicts, both Neofytou and Georgiadis withdrew their candidacies and endorsed Annita Demetriou, the President of the House of Representatives, as a unity candidate. Annita Demetriou, recognised for her strong reputation and broad multi-party acceptance, ultimately defeated Demetris Demetriou, winning the presidency of DISY with 69.2% of the votes.

Despite the party&#x27;s official stance as &#x27;responsible opposition&#x27;, many view DISY&#x27;s role as ambiguous and uncertain. A substantial number of Christodoulides&#x27; ministers are active members of DISY, and the party has shown significant support for the president in parliament. A notable example is the 2024 National Budget, where DISY made fewer amendments than the governing parties. This perceived balancing act has led to public dissatisfaction with the party&#x27;s role as opposition to the unpopular Christodoulides administration.

In preparation for the 2024 European Parliament Election, DISY carried out an internal election to choose its six candidates. Nine personalities announced their interest for the election, with former Health Minister Michalis Hatzipantelas emerging as the top candidate.

Marios Pelekanos, one of the three vice presidents of the Democratic Rally, finished second to last in the internal election and was not included in the list of six nominees. Pelekanos expressed profound dissatisfaction and subsequently resigned from his position within the party leadership, citing a series of underlying events that had undermined his standing. After multi-day discussions with ELAM, on March 22, 2024, it was announced that he would run in the European Elections as a candidate of the ultranationalist party. The leader of DISY, Annita Demetriou, harshly condemned this move, and the centre-right party proceeded by deleting Pelekanos from its register, emphasising the vast differences in politics between the two parties. Marios Pelekanos, who had also held the position of government spokesperson in Anastasiades&#x27; administration from 2021 to 2023, became the Press Representative of ELAM

Despite numerous challenges, including the candidacy of Marios Pelekanos with ELAM, Eleni Theocharous (leader of the splinter Solidarity Movement) with DIKO, and Pantelis Poietis (former DISY MP candidate) with DIPA, as well as many corruption scandals from Anastasiades&#x27; administration and widespread dissatisfaction with DISY&#x27;s role as the main opposition in Christodoulides&#x27; government, the centre-right party managed to achieve another first-place finish, maintaining its two seats in the European Parliament. However, the 24.8% of the popular vote is the worst result in the party&#x27;s history, significantly lower than the 29% in the 2019 election and the 37.8% in the 2014 election.

==== Anastasiades–Neofytou dispute ====
In a podcast on July 8, 2024, former President Nicos Anastasiades criticised Averof Neofytou&#x27;s campaign for the 2023 presidential elections, suggesting that his detachment from the sentiments of DISY supporters contributed to the party&#x27;s defeat. Anastasiades also questioned Neofytou&#x27;s perceived alignment with the AKEL-backed candidate, Andreas Mavroyiannis, in the second round of the election.

Anastasiades&#x27; remark, &quot;I don&#x27;t want to bother with bitter people&quot;, directed at Averof Neofytou, elicited a strong response from Neofytou on Twitter. Neofytou responded by stating that those who are &quot;bitter&quot; are the thousands who once trusted Anastasiades, along with broader criticisms of Anastasiades&#x27; handling of the Cyprus problem.

==== Demetriou–Neofytou dispute ====

The Great Sea Interconnector is a planned HVDC interconnector between the Greek, Cypriot, and Israeli power grids via the world’s longest submarine power cable. The project has received support from the Democratic Rally. However, in late August 2024, Averof Neofytou expressed opposition to advancing any energy projects before resolving the Cyprus problem, and he questioned whether the interconnection will actually reduce energy bills in Cyprus. This stance led to a conflict with DISY President Annita Demetriou, who has strongly supported the project. Averof Neofytou, along with Kyriakos Hadjiyiannis, remains among the only two DISY MPs opposing the interconnection, which has been primarily developed during the presidency of Nicos Anastasiades.

In September 2024, when asked whether Averof Neofytou could again be the party&#x27;s candidate for the 2028 presidential election—following his expressed interest—Annita Demetriou responded that Neofytou had already been tested in 2023, and respecting the public&#x27;s verdict, DISY should now move forward for the good of the country.

==Election results==
===Parliament===

<doc id="788791" wikidata="Q1308177" url="?curid=788791" title="Incomes policy">
<text>Incomes policies in economics are economy-wide wage and price controls, most commonly instituted as a response to inflation, and usually seeking to establish wages and prices below free-market level. Incomes policies have often been resorted to during wartime. During the French Revolution, &quot;The Law of the Maximum&quot; imposed price controls (by penalty of death) in an unsuccessful attempt to curb inflation, and such measures were also attempted after World War II. Peacetime income policies were resorted to in the U.S. in August 1971 as a response to inflation. The wage and price controls were effective initially but were made less restrictive in January 1973, and later removed when they seemed to be having no effect on curbing inflation. Incomes policies were successful in the United Kingdom during World War II but less successful in the post-war era.

==Theory==
Incomes policies vary from voluntary wage and price guidelines to mandatory controls like price/wage freezes. One variant is &quot;tax-based incomes policies&quot; (TIPs), where a government fee is imposed on those firms that raise prices and/or wages more than the controls allow. Some economists agree that a credible incomes policy would help prevent inflation; however, by arbitrarily interfering with price signals, it provides an additional bar to achieving economic efficiency, potentially leading to shortages and declines in the quality of goods on the market and requiring large government bureaucracies for enforcement. That happened in the United States during the early 1970s. When the price of a good is lowered artificially, it creates less supply and more demand for the product, thereby creating shortages.

Some economists argue that incomes policies are less expensive (more efficient) than recessions as a way of fighting inflation, at least for mild inflation. Others argue that controls and mild recessions can be complementary solutions for relatively mild inflation. The policy has the best chance of being credible and effective for the sectors of the economy dominated by monopolies or oligopolies, particularly nationalised industry, with a significant sector of workers organized in labor unions. Such institutions enable collective negotiation and monitoring of the wage and price agreements. Other economists argue that inflation is essentially a monetary phenomenon, and the only way to deal with it is by controlling the money supply, directly or by changing interest rates. They argue that price inflation is only a symptom of previous monetary inflation caused by central bank money creation. They believe that without a totally planned economy the incomes policy can never work, the excess money in the economy greatly distorting other areas, exempt from the policy.

==Examples==

===France===
During the French Revolution in the 1790s, &quot;The Law of the Maximum&quot; was imposed in an attempt to decrease inflation. It consisted of limits on wages and food prices. Many dissidents were executed for breaking this law. The law was repealed 14 months after its introduction. By turning the crimes of price gouging and food hoarding into crimes against the government, Revolutionary France had limited success. With respect to its overt intention, that of ensuring the people were able to purchase food at a reasonable rate, the Maximum was mostly a failure. Some merchants having found themselves forced into a position to sell their goods for a price below cost (e.g. cost of baking bread or growing vegetables) chose to hide their expensive goods from the market, either for personal use or for sale on the black market; however, the General Maximum was very successful in deflecting a volatile political issue away from the Committee of Public Safety and Maximilien Robespierre, enabling them to focus on larger political issues more closely related to completing the French Revolution.

By creating the General Maximum, Robespierre shifted the attention of the French people away from government involvement in widespread shortages of money and food to a fight between consumers and merchants. The text of the General Maximum was written towards businessmen who were profiting on a large scale from the demise of the French economy. In practice, the law ultimately targeted local shopkeepers, butchers, bakers, and farmers-the merchants who were profiting the least from the economic crisis. With the General Maximum, Robespierre offered the people an answer regarding whom to blame for their poverty and their hunger. Furthermore, considering its association with the Law of Suspects, when a citizen informed the government about a merchant who was in violation of the law, they were considered to have done their civic duty.

===United States===
During World War II, price controls were used in an attempt to control wartime inflation. The Franklin Roosevelt Administration instituted the OPA (Office of Price Administration). That agency was rather unpopular with business interests and was phased out as quickly as possible after peace had been restored; however, the Korean War brought a return to the same inflationary pressures, and price controls were again established, this time under the Office of Price Stabilization. In the early 1970s, inflation had been much higher than in previous decades, getting above 6% briefly in 1970 and persisting above 4% in 1971. U.S. President Richard Nixon imposed price controls on August 15, 1971. This was a move widely applauded by the public and a number of Keynesian economists. The same day, Nixon also suspended the convertibility of the dollar into gold, which was the beginning of the end of the Bretton Woods system of international currency management established after World War II. The 90-day freeze was unprecedented in peacetime, but such drastic measures were thought necessary. It was quite well known at the time that this would likely lead to an immediate inflationary impulse (essentially because the subsequent depreciation of the dollar would boost the demand for exports and increase the cost of imports). The controls aimed to stop that impulse. The fact that the election of 1972 was on the horizon likely contributed to both Nixon&#x27;s application of controls and his ending of the convertibility of the dollar.

The 90-day freeze became nearly 1,000 days of measures known as Phases One, Two, Three, and Four, ending in 1973. In these phases, the controls were applied almost entirely to the biggest corporations and labor unions, which were seen as having price-setting power; however, 93% of requested price increases were granted and seen as necessary to meet costs. With such monopoly power, some economists saw controls as possibly working effectively, although they are usually skeptical on the issue of controls. Because controls of this sort can calm inflationary expectations, this was seen as a serious blow against stagflation. The first wave of controls were successful at curbing inflation temporarily while the administration used expansionary fiscal and monetary policies; however, the long-term effects proved to be destabilizing. Left unsuppressed after the initial price controls were relaxed, the overly expansionary policies proceeded to exacerbate inflationary pressures. Meat also began disappearing from grocery store shelves and Americans protested wage controls that did not allow wages to keep up with inflation. Since that time, the U.S. government has not imposed maximum prices on consumer items or labor, although the cap on oil and natural gas prices persisted for years after 1973. During times of high inflation, controls have been called for; in 1980 during unprecedented inflation, &quot;BusinessWeek&quot; editorialized in favor of semi-permanent wage and price controls.

===Canada===

During the 1974 Canadian federal election, Progressive Conservative Party leader Robert Stanfield proposed the imposition of a wage and price freeze on the Canadian economy as a response to rising inflation due to the 1973 oil crisis. The Liberal government under Pierre Trudeau was originally opposed to this idea; however, after winning the election, it introduced the Anti-Inflation Act in 1975. This act contained wage and price controls on parts of the economy and remained in force until 1978. In 1979, the anti-inflation board was dissolved and the Anti-Inflation Act repealed.

===United Kingdom===

The National Board for Prices and Incomes was created by the Labout government led by Harold Wilson in 1965 in an attempt to solve the problem of inflation in the British economy by managing wages and prices. The Callaghan government in the 1970s sought to reduce conflict over wages and prices through a social contract in which unions would accept smaller wage increases, and business would constrain price increases, imitating Nixon&#x27;s policy in America. Price controls ended with the election of Margaret Thatcher in 1979.

===Australia===
Australia implemented an incomes policy, called the Prices and Incomes Accord during the 1980s. The Accord was an agreement between trade unions and the Hawke Labor government. Employers were not party to the Accord. Unions agreed to restrict wage demands, and the government pledged action to minimise inflation and price rises. The government was also to act on the social wage. At its broadest, this concept included increased spending on education as well as welfare. Inflation declined during the period of the Accord, which was renegotiated several times; however, many of the key elements of the Accord were weakened over time, as unions sought a shift from centralised wage fixation to enterprise bargaining. The Accord ceased to play a major role after the recession of 1989–1992, and was abandoned after the Labor government was defeated in 1996.

===Italy===
Italy imitated the United States&#x27; price and wage controls in 1971 but soon gave up the policy to focus on controlling the price of oil.

===The Netherlands and Belgium===
The polder model in the Netherlands is characterized by tri-partite cooperation between employers&#x27; organizations like VNO-NCW, labour unions like the FNV, and the government. These talks are embodied in the Social Economic Council (Dutch: &quot;Sociaal-Economische Raad&quot;, SER). The SER serves as the central forum to discuss labour issues and has a long tradition of consensus, often defusing labour conflicts and avoiding strikes. Similar models are in use in Finland, namely Comprehensive Income Policy Agreement and universal validity of collective labour agreements. The polder model is said to have begun with the Wassenaar Accords of 1982 when unions, employers and government decided on a comprehensive plan to revitalize the economy involving shorter working times and less pay on the one hand, and more employment on the other. This model is also used in Belgium, hence its name (the &quot;polders&quot; are a region comprising the Netherlands and the northern part of Belgium). The polder model is widely, but not universally, regarded as successful incomes management policy.

===New Zealand===
In 1982, then Prime Minister and Finance Minister Rob Muldoon imposed a simultaneous freeze on wages, prices and interest rates in an effort to curb inflation, despite public resistance. These measures were subsequently repealed by Muldoon&#x27;s successor David Lange and Finance Minister Roger Douglas.

===Zimbabwe===
In 2007, Robert Mugabe&#x27;s government imposed a price freeze in Zimbabwe because of hyperinflation. That policy led only to shortages.

<doc id="788796" wikidata="Q3779786" url="?curid=788796" title="Cobra (G.I. Joe)">
<text>COBRA (sometimes referred to as Cobra Command) is a fictional terrorist organization and the nemesis of the G.I. Joe Team in the Hasbro action figure toyline &quot;G.I. Joe: A Real American Hero&quot; and &quot;G.I. Joe: Sigma 6&quot;, as well as in related media.

Cobra was first introduced during the launch of the &quot;G.I. Joe: A Real American Hero&quot; toyline in mid-1982. The toyline was accompanied by a Marvel Comics series, written by Larry Hama, and an animated television series by Sunbow and Marvel Productions. However, the origin and portrayal of Cobra has differed in each of them.

Marvel Comics invented the Cobra concept, with the name having been proposed by Archie Goodwin. When Marvel first proposed the concept, Hasbro was reluctant to make toys of the villains for fear that they would not sell. According to Jim Shooter, &quot;later ... villains became 40% of their volume.&quot; Cobra&#x27;s iconic logo was later created by Hasbro designer Ron Rudat.

==Organization==

===High command===

All members of the Cobra organization are portrayed as fighting against G.I. Joe, however, there are several internal power struggles within the group.

* Cobra Commander – The leader and founder of the Cobra organization. His face is mostly hidden, either with a hood, with only his eyes visible, or with a featureless, high-tech battle helmet. In the Sunbow cartoon, this concealment was said to be used in order to hide his inhuman disfigurement, but it was discovered later that it was actually done to maintain the secret of his civilian identity – he was revealed to be an agent from a race of reptilian serpent people known as &quot;Cobra-La&quot;. In the comic, he is regarded as the most dangerous man on Earth because of the extent of his ability to attract followers. Only the Baroness and Destro have seen his face.
* Serpentor – The Cobra Emperor, created through cloning research done by Doctor Mindbender. The process used DNA extracted from the remains of ruthless military leaders, including Julius Caesar, Napoleon Bonaparte, Attila the Hun, Vlad Tepes (cartoon only), Alexander the Great, Hannibal, and Genghis Khan. In the Sunbow TV series, G.I. Joe member Sgt. Slaughter. In the comics, Storm Shadow is the tenth and only live source of DNA instead of Sgt. Slaughter. In addition to his genetic disposition, an early experiment also gave him access to the brain patterns of G.I. Joe HALO jumper Ripcord, allowing him to use G.I. Joe&#x27;s strategies against them. In the comic Serpentor was killed by Zartan, only to be revived by a Cobra splinter group known as the Coil, and then killed again by Cobra Commander. In the Sunbow cartoon Serpentor was created to supplant Cobra Commander as the supreme leader of Cobra, using Cobra Commander as his willing scapegoat for his failed attempts to rule the world. It was later revealed that Serpentor was created at the behest of Cobra-La.
* Destro, or James McCullen Destro XXIV – A Scotsman who is depicted as wearing a metal mask, which was enabled by a form of nano-tech or liquid metal. In the cartoon, the mouth of his mask moves. Destro, an arms dealer, often attempts to usurp leadership of Cobra. Destro is the hereditary leader of M.A.R.S. (Military Armaments Research Syndicate) and uses his personal army, the Iron Grenadiers, to start conflicts in order to sell weapons to both sides. Destro has a warped sense of honor and a grudging respect for G.I. Joe.
* Baroness or Baroness Anastasia Cisarovna – The Baroness is a daughter of European aristocrats who became terrorists after their son (the Baroness&#x27; brother) was murdered. Her brother had been in a political hot spot aiding refugees when he was taken hostage alongside the group of relief workers he had volunteered for. US Army Rangers had attempted to free the hostages, but the mission was botched and resulted in the brother&#x27;s death. In the original Marvel comics, she blamed Snake Eyes for his death. The Baroness serves as Cobra&#x27;s director of intelligence, and is romantically involved with Destro.
* Doctor Mindbender – A mad scientist and former dentist, he created several mind-control devices, and was also an expert on genetic manipulation. He is responsible for the creation of Serpentor and the B.A.T.s, as well as perfecting the Brainwave Scanner. Though usually depicted as being quite muscular, Mindbender is portrayed as being cowardly and preferring to avoid physical confrontations.
* Tomax and Xamot – Twin brothers who lead the Crimson Guard and are the respectable corporate face of Cobra. When not engaged in field missions, Tomax and Xamot are found wearing suits and ties, managing Cobra&#x27;s business affairs. The brothers share an empathic connection. While this is often useful, as it allows them to communicate wordlessly and finish each other&#x27;s sentences, it is also a liability, as they feel each other&#x27;s pain during fights. Tomax and Xamot are mirror images of each other, except for Xamot having a scar on the right side (cartoon) of his face, portrayed on the left side in the 1985 action figure. The twins run a corporation named Extensive Enterprises and are known more for their skills in the boardroom rather than on the battlefield.
* Storm Shadow, or Thomas &quot;Tommy&quot; Arashikage – A ninja trained in martial arts who serves as both an assassin and bodyguard for Cobra. His origin varies depending on the source – in various cartoons, he is a cold-blooded villain and unrepentant killer. In Marvel Comics (which reveals that he served in the US military in Vietnam with Snake Eyes and Stalker), he joined Cobra in order to gather evidence and clear his name after having been framed for the murder of the Hard Master by Cobra operative Zartan. Storm Shadow eventually leaves Cobra and becomes a member of G.I. Joe, though captured and brainwashed by Cobra Commander to once again serve Cobra. He then breaks free and rejoins G.I. Joe. In the Sunbow/Marvel cartoon, Storm Shadow was depicted as a rival to Spirit and later Quick Kick instead of Snake Eyes. In the DIC cartoon, Storm Shadow only joined Cobra to find out who dishonored his clan before defecting to G.I. Joe.
* Zartan – The leader of the Dreadnoks, a master spy and assassin. He is a master of disguise, often literally morphing into the exact physical form of the person he seeks to impersonate (an ability attributed to a series of mysterious genetic experiments he endured). In most storylines, Zartan is also capable of changing his skin color to blend in with his background. His special ability is disrupted by sunlight.

===Minor command===
* Major Bludd – Major Sebastian Bludd is an Australian mercenary with extensive combat experience, who sometimes works for Cobra. He is a master tactician and is an expert in all known weapons. Usually portrayed as Cobra&#x27;s infantry commander, Major Bludd is best known for the assassination of General Flagg, the original leader of the G.I. Joe team, as well as for the running gag that Bludd wrote very bad poetry.
* Firefly – The world&#x27;s greatest saboteur, Firefly&#x27;s background is a mystery. A mercenary and assassin, Firefly offers no guarantees or refunds. He is portrayed as an expert in all types of explosive ordnance and demolition materials. He is also the faceless master of the Koga ninja clan.
* Doctor Venom – A Cobra scientist who played an important role in the first two years of the comic book story. He was then portrayed as having been killed in action, eventually to be replaced by Doctor Mindbender.
* Scrap-Iron – The anti-armor specialist of Cobra. Along with Dr. Mindbender, he also invented the B.A.T.s.
* Kwinn – An Inuit mercenary, only appearing in the first two years of the comic book series. A mercenary with a strong code of honor, he was described as having previously worked for the CIA, Mossad, MI6 and the KGB, leading to him working with Cobra in Sierra Gordo. He later renounced his life as a mercenary, but was betrayed and killed by Doctor Venom in the series.
* Fred VII – A soldier in the Crimson Guard, having temporarily impersonated Cobra Commander after believing that he had fatally shot him. He died after the real Cobra Commander made his return in the series.
* Black Out – Sniper Thomas Stall, who was rejected by G.I. Joe for failing his psychological exam, and was suspected of being involved with the disappearance of his sister. After being imprisoned, Thomas broke out of the brig at Fort Huachuca during an attack by Cobra, whom he surrendered to and subsequently joined.

===Factions===
There are different factions of Cobra:

====Black Dragon====
The Black Dragon is an organization that works for Cobra. While the original group was wiped out during the Cold War by the original G.I. Joe team, there was a survivor who formed the next incarnation of the group who allied with Cobra. The Black Dragon Leader has the Black Dragon organization consisting of Black Dragon Troopers and Black Dragon Ninjas.

====Cobra-La====
Cobra-La is an ancient civilization led by Golobulus that Cobra was said to have connections with in different adaptions. He is served by Pythona, Nemesis Enforcer, and his Royal Guards.

====Coil====
The Coil is a religious wing of Cobra and a highly influential cult that is known to the public as a self-help group.

====Dreadnoks====
Led by Zartan and his siblings Zandar and Zarana, the Dreadnoks are a militarized biker gang consisting of mercenaries, thieves, and vandals who work for Cobra when brute force was needed. Zartan used them for backup and brought them with him when he joined Cobra, with Zarana in particular becoming a top ranking agent of Cobra under Fred VII. Members include Burn Out, Buzzer, Crusher, Demolisher, the Dreadheads, Gnawgahyde, Monkeywrench, Ripper, Road Pig, Storm Rider, Thrasher, Torch, Zartan&#x27;s daughter Zanya, and Zanzibar.

====Iron Grenadiers====
The Iron Grenadiers are a private army owned and maintained by Destro. Its known members are Darklon, General Mayhem, Metal-Head, Roddy Piper, Sergeant Major Duncan, and Voltar.

====Lunartix Empire====
The Lunartix Empire is a kingdom of aliens who are allied with Cobra. Its known members are Predacon, Carcass, Lobotomaxx, and the Manimals Iguanus, Slythor, and Warwolf.

====V.E.N.O.M.====
V.E.N.O.M. is short for Vicious Evil Network Of Mayhem. Specialist Trakker&#x27;s action figure for the G.I. Joe toyline states that V.E.N.O.M. is a technology and weapons research branch and mercenary army for Cobra.

===Rank and file===
The vast majority of Cobra is made up of legions of uniformed soldiers. Nearly all of them appear masked in order to be anonymous and widely diversified according to specialties and functions. Some of the more prominent include:

* Cobra Troopers – These are the basic infantry soldiers introduced in 1982, equipped with normal military gear (as opposed to the more hi-tech gear of the Vipers), with Cobra Officers as the field leaders. They are featured on both the cartoon and comic series.
* Crimson Guard - Led by Tomax and Xamot, these elite soldiers were first introduced to the series in 1985. It is said that in addition to intense military training, they are required to have a degree in either accounting or law, and are often used in deep cover operations, posing as civilians or politicians. Later toys expanded on the Crimson Guard concept with the release of figures such as the Crimson Guard Immortals and Commanders, as well as group-specific vehicles. As another part of their deep cover operations, many Crimson Guardsmen undergo plastic surgery in order to adopt identical features in case one &quot;Seigie&quot; (the phonetic pronunciation of &quot;C.G&quot;) is required to replace another in a public cover. The Crimson Guard also maintain Cobra&#x27;s legal business fronts.
* Cobra Vipers – Introduced in 1986 as a replacement for the Cobra Troopers, these infantry soldiers complement the Cobra Troopers in both the cartoon and comic series. The concept, originally introduced in 1985 with the introduction of Tele-Vipers (communication experts) quickly evolved into a suffix for all future Cobra troops (such as Air-Viper, Ice-Vipers, Motor-Vipers, Techno-Vipers, etc.). With regards to the original adjective-less Vipers, Hasbro has often alternated between establishing the Vipers as the entry-level position into Cobra, or for them being the elite of Cobra&#x27;s ground troops as far as them being equal to or above the regular blue shirt troops.
* B.A.T.s – The Battle Android Troopers were introduced in 1986 and are used extensively in the cartoon series to present an army that the heroes could gun down without killing living beings. Intended as an alternative to living soldiers, the androids are hazardous to both friend and foe because of poor eye sensors.
* Python Patrol – Although their origin differs in the cartoon and comic series, the Python Patrol is an elite unit of Cobra, hand-selected by Cobra Commander (in the comic, they were hand-selected by his impostor). What makes this group stand out is their use of stealth coating technology, masking their vehicles and uniforms from most forms of electronic detection.
* Night Creepers – A syndicate of hi-tech ninjas and mercenaries hired by Cobra as spies or assassins. They made an appearance in both the cartoon and the comic series, where they become a recurring enemy of the Ninja Force.

===Bases===
Cobra maintains a number of bases around the world. In several media incarnations, Cobra&#x27;s primary base is Cobra Island. In the Marvel Comics series, Cobra has bases, underground cells, and even whole communities scattered across the globe. The following are several specific locations with names:

* Broca Beach – After the destruction of Springfield, Cobra created another town as their secret base of operations in America. This one was transformed from an abandoned seaside town. Former residents of the destroyed Springfield town were relocated here.
* Castle Destro – Destro&#x27;s fortress in Scotland. Training ground for the Iron Grenadiers. Though destroyed by Cobra Commander, a new castle was presumably reconstructed some years later.
* Cobra Citadel, also known as the Silent Castle – Cobra&#x27;s base of operations in Eastern Europe, located in Trans-Carpathia. Owned primarily by Destro, he incorporated many secret passageways and features into the castle&#x27;s design including the ability to shift its configuration (through a complex series of levels, pulleys, and gears) into a near-exact likeness of Castle Destro – both internally and externally. Although he initially gave up the rights to the castle to Destro, Cobra Commander later decided he wanted it back as it was rather close to his operations in Darklonia. Its design was first featured in &quot;The MASS Device&quot; TV miniseries.
* Cobra Consulate – A high-rise in New York City used by Cobra as an embassy and base of operations after Cobra Island was declared a sovereign nation. Its upper levels were destroyed in a battle with G.I. Joe, and the building was abandoned by Cobra for some time (save for a few late-night top-secret meetings). In the Devil&#x27;s Due comics it was rebuilt and used once again.
* Cobra Island – The primary base of Cobra operations. It was created after a massive man-made earthquake. Cobra lawyers, well-prepared, moved in and had it declared a sovereign nation. It was the battlefield for the Cobra civil war and the battle against The Coil. After Cobra disappeared for several years, the island was seized by the U.N. It then came under the control of The Coil, then Cobra, and was finally destroyed by a nuclear warhead, which also killed every member of the Coil.
* Helicarrier, also known as the Cobra Air Ship – A flying aircraft carrier from the Sunbow cartoon series. It served as a mobile base for Cobra until it was lost in a battle over a matter-antimatter device, when it rammed G.I. Joe&#x27;s conventional aircraft carrier. Both carriers sank to the bottom of the sea. Another helicarrier was commissioned, but was also destroyed over the skies of Liberty Island in New York City.
* Millville – A steel town that fell into economic ruin after the closing of the local plant. When Cobra descends en masse on it one day, the residents are swayed by Cobra Commander&#x27;s promise of quick wealth and prosperity for those who submit to his rule. However, Cobra immediately subjugates the town via a brainwashing device, leading to the formation of a local resistance. Combat with numerous Autobots and Decepticons result in Cobra ultimately abandoning the town and its citizens.
* Monolith Base – A massive mountain complex located in Badhikistan. It served as Cobra&#x27;s main base but was taken over in an all-out assault from G.I. Joe.
* Springfield – A small rather anonymous town in the U.S. which Cobra secretly operated as a base. The town was poor and desperate when the man who would become Cobra Commander arrived. He became the town&#x27;s savior and it was there that he started Cobra. Many covert operations were held there, including the creation of Serpentor, which in turn led directly to the town&#x27;s population being evacuated to Cobra Island when the Joes confronted Cobra. In the two-part Sunbow-produced episode &quot;There&#x27;s No Place Like Springfield&quot;, the town existed on an island and was known as Temple Alpha. Springfield was actually a facade for an underground Cobra training facility. However, unlike the comics, the town above ground was populated primarily by synthoids.
* Extensive Enterprises – A global conglomerate based out of the twin Enterprise Towers in Enterprise City. Tomax and Xamot serve as its owners and co-CEOs.
* M.A.R.S. – Military Armaments Research Systems/Syndicate – a legitimate weapons manufacturing firm headquartered in Callander, Scotland. Destro is the current owner and CEO.
* Terror Drome – In the comic series from Marvel Comics, the Terror Drome is a small pre-fab fortress, sold by Cobra to third world countries and developing nations for defense. Cobra personnel are required to run the Terror Dromes, providing ways for Cobra to infiltrate the country. The playset of the base was first released in 1986, and came with three vehicle bays, munitions depot, a prison cell, tower-mounted cannons, a launch silo for a mini-jet, and an action figure.

To hide certain aspects of its operation, Cobra maintains a number of legitimate business fronts (in addition to the town of Springfield itself and its encompassing businesses) nearly all of which appear to be anagrams of the word &quot;Cobra&quot;.

==Comic series==
===Marvel Comics===
Cobra had its beginnings when the financially ruined man who would become Cobra Commander settled in an American town called Springfield. Blaming the federal government and big business for his misfortunes, he conceived a plan to form a secret organization to acquire wealth and power and thereby take his revenge on the world. Springfield was a perfect place to start the organization, as the town itself had fallen on hard times and the population was disillusioned. Soon, the organization was growing with the entry of like-minded individuals from all over the country. Much of Cobra&#x27;s early funding came from pyramid schemes and other semi-legitimate business plans, and that financial success allowed a gradual and intense takeover.

In a very short time, Cobra evolved from a business into a paramilitary movement. Motivated by greed and power, the group soon expanded all over the country, operating in secret, engaging in terrorism to achieve their objectives. By the time the U.S. government recognized Cobra as a threat, the organization had already gained footholds as a powerful private army and terrorist organization around the world.

Many of its members (especially those in the elite Crimson Guard units) lead seemingly normal lives, supporting Cobra covertly. Cobra attracted members with the promise of fast financial rewards and power for those willing to be ruthless enough. It also offered a world of order and strength, with its &quot;model community&quot; of Springfield being one example of the Cobra ideal.

Cobra would eventually achieve a temporary legitimacy by the artificial creation of Cobra Island, which was recognized as an independent nation by the international community. This allowed Cobra to have diplomatic facilities in the United States via a Cobra Consulate building acquired in New York City.

During Serpentor&#x27;s tenure, Cobra&#x27;s primary source of income came from arms sales to Third World nations. This led to a clash with Destro&#x27;s M.A.R.S. Organization, which provided Cobra with much of its arms.

For a comic series predominantly aimed at children, Cobra was a relatively mature depiction of a highly successful terrorist organization. With its strong symbolic imagery, charismatic and ruthless leader and fanatical hierarchy, the fictional group is similar to other fictional terrorist and totalitarian organizations such as SPECTRE of James Bond fame and the similar Marvel Universe organization HYDRA.

Larry Hama depicted Cobra troops as being motivated by money, power and a sense of brotherhood. However, they are not fanatical to the point where they would fight to the last man and to the last breath. If all is lost, they would willingly surrender or run away had they the chance, something their leaders rarely let them do. The brutal training depicted in the file cards of the troopers are very much characteristic of ritual hazing.

The only instance that has shown Cobra as a suicidal fanatical organization was in issue #8 where the troopers willingly let themselves blow up on a boat after their loss.

===Action Force===
In the United Kingdom, G.I. Joe was marketed under the name &quot;Action Force&quot;. The original antagonists in the &quot;Action Force&quot; series were the Red Shadows. The Red Shadows were a terrorist organization led by Baron Ironblood and his lieutenant the Black Major. Prominent members included artillery expert Red Laser and tank commander Red Jackal.

The &quot;Action Force&quot; series was eventually written to more closely match the American &quot;G.I. Joe&quot; franchise. The &quot;World Enemy No. 1&quot; storyline in the &quot;Battle Action Force&quot; comic had Ironblood betraying the Red Shadows, abandoning them to die pointlessly, and going into hiding. When he reemerged, he had organized a new group called Cobra and renamed himself as Cobra Commander. The Red Jackal tracked down Cobra Commander with the intention of killing him to avenge the treachery he had performed. On the brink of throttling the Commander, Jackal succumbed to stun gas and passed out, not quite completing his sentence declaring his intention to destroy the former Baron Ironblood. Admiring his tenacity and resourcefulness, Cobra Commander elected not to kill the man, instead allowing him to continue to serve. To remind Jackal that, in the end, he failed to eliminate Cobra Commander, the leader renamed him &#x27;Destro&#x27; — the last word he spoke as his former self.

===IDW===
In the IDW universe, Cobra is a shadowy, rumored organization, led by a man known only as &quot;the Commander&quot;; however, there have been other Commanders in the past, elected into &#x27;office&#x27; by the faceless body known as the Cobra Council. The Baroness refers to it as &quot;an old organization ... ensconced in its own traditions&quot; that has existed for centuries. The Council members&#x27; identities are unknown.

Other high ranking agents include Xamot and Tomax (corporate leaders, coerced by Cobra to merge their Extensive Enterprises organization with them), Crystal Ball (psychological tactics master and internal affairs), Major Bludd, Captain Vicuna (submarine commander), and the chief scientists Dr. Mindbender and Copperback.

Cobra&#x27;s standard method is to destabilize an already unstable nation, using both terrorism and shell companies to hit the economy. They then openly hire out their Crimson Guard soldiers to that country and slowly make the population trust them more than their government. One operation involved manipulating a small war in Africa, forcing the attacked nation to sell off its national assets.

It has its own secret communications network, the Cobranet, unconnected to the regular Internet. Terrorist groups across the planet are somewhat aware of Cobra and scared of it. An international aid company serves as a Cobra front, and they use a psychological test to identify potential, loyal recruits. It is later revealed that a large cult, The Coil (led by Serpentor), is also part of Cobra&#x27;s organization. They have a prison called Section Ten and Selene Base, located on the Moon.

Mainframe first stumbles across the global Cobra conspiracy by accident, and was believed by General Hawk to be crazy. Determined to reveal the organization, he went AWOL. Later, Snake Eyes also goes AWOL looking for Cobra. The Joes later hear the word &quot;Cobra&quot; mentioned after busting one of Destro&#x27;s arm shipments, but are unaware of what it truly is. Duke believes the organization is just a myth and Hawk now believes it is the codename for an operation, but by this point Scarlett believes Cobra is a real, large-scale threat. As a result, she kept unauthorized contact with Snake Eyes about it. At about this time, Chuckles is sent to infiltrate a secret organization which, it is soon discovered, is in fact Cobra.

Thanks to Mainframe and Snake Eyes, Cobra is revealed to the Joes. At the same time, Xamot and Tomax reveal they have used Chuckles (whom they knew all along was a spy) to feed selective information to the Joes in order to intimidate them. Chuckles goes rogue in order to bring the organization down, and succeeds in assassinating the Commander and causing the nuclear obliteration of a Cobra island base.

After a series of catastrophic losses to the Joe team (including the destruction of Section Ten, the loss of the M.A.S.S. Device and the subsequent abandonment of the lunar Selene Base), the Cobra Council responds by creating a contest to determine who would be the next Commander: whoever murders the most Joes takes on the role of Commander. A ruthless agent named Krake wins the competition, largely by revealing that he had killed and replaced one of his rivals with Zartan, doubling his kill score and showing the initiative to break the rules to win.

The new Commander orders the open invasion of the Southeast Asian nation of Nanzhao and successfully convinces the world at large that Nanzhao was a brutal regime that profited off the international drug trade; in reality, the invasion is a front for acquiring the country&#x27;s massive gold reserves and driving up the price of heroin, a drug that Cobra itself deals. The Commander then slaughters the Cobra Council and assumes full control of Cobra.

==Animated series==
===Sunbow===
The Sunbow cartoon did not explore how Cobra began. It was only in &quot;G.I. Joe: The Movie&quot; that it is revealed that the organization was a front runner for a 40,000-year-old underground civilization called Cobra-La, whose snake-like inhabitants were driven underground by the advent of humankind. Cobra Commander was, in actuality, a member of this underground race. He was tasked with creating an organization that would overrun the world at large. It is also revealed that the creation of Serpentor was an initiative by Cobra-La: through the use of a biological mind controlling device, they implanted the idea into Dr. Mindbender&#x27;s mind.

The creation of Cobra-La was an unintentional side effect of Hasbro&#x27;s demand that the heretofore unintroduced Cobra Emperor Serpentor be inserted into the series, despite the fact that Cobra Commander had long been established as the one-and-only head of Cobra. Series story editor and writer Buzz Dixon offered two possible storylines to make it work: one had the senior Cobra leadership, fed up with Cobra Commander&#x27;s constant failures, deciding to literally build a better leader. The other presented Cobra as being a front for a vast, secretive and far more sinister organization whose leadership finds Cobra Commander lacking and sends Serpentor as a replacement. Hasbro, liking both ideas, had the series writers combine both concepts.

The writers despised the name Cobra-La and had only originally intended to use it as a working name to be replaced by a &quot;real&quot; name in the finished product; they were overruled by Hasbro. Buzz Dixon had a much different idea originally for the origin of Cobra. In a story entitled &quot;The Most Dangerous Man in the World&quot;, it was to be revealed that Cobra was originally organized around the political theories of a Karl Marx/Friedrich Nietzsche-type figure, whom Cobra Commander locked away when the Commander began corrupting the Cobra philosophies from their original principles. A first-season two-part episode, &quot;Worlds Without End&quot;, portrays an alternate reality in which Cobra has established control over the United States (and apparently all of the world). Although Cobra&#x27;s reign is totalitarian, it does not use its power to promote any ideology beyond glorifying its leadership, and there is no sign of Cobra-La or other inhuman backing.

None of the senior Cobra leaders, except Destro and the Baroness, likes the others. During the encounter with the Gamesmaster, Zartan accuses Destro of kidnapping Cobra Commander; Destro refuses to bargain for Zartan&#x27;s release from G. I. Joe, and regards Cobra Commander with contempt; the Baroness disbelieves Cobra Commander&#x27;s promise that he will send help after escaping via helicopter, and prefers G.I. Joe member Lady Jaye to use the vehicle; and Cobra Commander only trusts himself. Even after Cobra&#x27;s complete victory in &quot;Worlds Without End&quot;, distrustful rivalry between Cobra Commander and Destro persists, bringing the regime to the brink of civil war.

According to the recruitment brochures for Cobra&#x27;s troops, they provide excellent dental.

===&quot;Sgt. Savage and the Screaming Eagles&quot;===
In the pilot episode of &quot;Sgt. Savage and his Screaming Eagles&quot;, General Blitz states that he helped create Cobra, during a teleconference between Blitz and Cobra Commander.

===&quot;G.I. Joe: Sigma 6&quot;===
Several of the organization&#x27;s prominent members such as Cobra Commander, Destro, the Baroness and Zartan are featured prominently in the &quot;G.I. Joe: Sigma 6&quot; television series. Many of these members are given some form of cybernetic enhancements. The Sigma 6 version of Cobra maintains B.A.Ts as the primary bulk of their army with human personnel acting mostly as technicians.

===&quot;G.I. Joe: Renegades&quot;===
In the &quot;G.I. Joe: Renegades&quot; television series, Cobra is presented as Cobra Industries, a multinational company involved in communications, pharmaceuticals and military technologies. The US government has long suspected them of criminal activity, but had no evidence. The Joes, here framed as criminals for their attempt to discover the truth, attempt to find evidence of Cobra&#x27;s plans of world domination. Cobra Commander, Baroness, Destro, and Doctor Mindbender are seen as the most prominent members of Cobra, but Major Bludd, Storm Shadow, Zartan, and Firefly also work for Cobra.

==Live-action film==
===&quot;G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra&quot;===
Despite its title in the live-action film &quot;G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra&quot;, Cobra as an organization does not appear as such. Instead, M.A.R.S. Industries, owned by James McCullen, are presented as the main antagonists along with Baroness, Storm Shadow, Zartan and the Doctor. While McCullen builds up his company and convinces NATO to fund his research and development projects to build more advanced weapons, he also conceives an elaborate plan to take over the world by creating an enemy that would inspire fear on a global scale and make everyone turn to the most powerful individual on Earth: the President of the United States. To this end, McCullen turns M.A.R.S.&#x27;s unlimited resources towards espionage and terrorism.

While not present, there are several hints throughout the film of what will become Cobra, such as the presence of M.A.R.S. Industries elite warriors, called Neo-Vipers, and the Doctor taking the alias of &quot;the Commander&quot;, stating that &quot;the time has come for the cobra to rise up and reveal himself&quot; while escaping in a submarine branded with Cobra&#x27;s logo. At the end of the film, the Commander and McCullen, now known as Destro, are imprisoned on the &quot;USS Flagg&quot; while Zartan appears at the end impersonating the U.S. president.

===&quot;G.I. Joe: Retaliation&quot;===
While the Commander and Destro are still imprisoned, Cobra reappears in the sequel film &quot;G.I. Joe: Retaliation&quot;, under the leadership of the U.S. president who is secretly Zartan in disguise. Zartan recruits ex-Joe Firefly and Storm Shadow to free the Commander, but leaves Destro in prison. Storm Shadow would later betray Cobra and joins the Joes on stopping Cobra and killing Zartan.

===&quot;Snake Eyes&quot;===
Cobra played a big part in &quot;Snake Eyes&quot; with Baroness as a figurehead and yakuza head Kenta Takamura as members. Storm Shadow joined Cobra in the end after being cast out of Clan Arashikage, after the betrayal and death of Kenta.

==In other media==
===&quot;Invincible&quot;===
In Image Comics&#x27; &quot;Invincible&quot; and its television adaptation, Cobra is parodied as the Lizard League, whose members include Queen Lizard (voiced by Tatiana Maslany), King Lizard (voiced by Scoot McNairy as an adult, Jacob Tremblay as a child), Salamander (voiced by Phil LaMarr), Supreme Lizard (voiced by Fred Tatasciore), Iguana, and Komodo Dragon.

===&quot;Community&quot;===

Cobra are featured as the main antagonists of the &quot;Community&quot; episode &quot;G.I. Jeff&quot;, written by Dino Stamatopoulos and directed by Rob Schrab, set within the coma dream of Jeff Winger (Joel McHale), as he finds himself taking on Cobra after accidentally killing Destro (Isaac C. Singleton Jr.) and introducing death to the world of the &quot;G.I. Joe&quot; animated series.

<doc id="788797" wikidata="Q605268" url="?curid=788797" title="Antonio Starabba, Marchese di Rudinì">
<text>Antonio Starrabba (or Starabba), Marquess of Rudinì (16 April 18397 August 1908) was an Italian statesman, Prime Minister of Italy between 1891 and 1892 and from 1896 until 1898.

==Biography==
===Early life and patriotic activities===
He was born in Palermo (then part of the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies) into an aristocratic Sicilian family. However, his family was of a more cultured, liberal disposition than many of their contemporaries.

In 1859, he joined the revolutionary committee which paved the way for Garibaldi&#x27;s triumphs in the following year. After spending a short time in Turin as attaché to the Italian foreign office, he was elected mayor of Palermo. In 1866, he displayed considerable personal courage and energy in quelling an insurrection of separatist and reactionary tendencies. The prestige thus acquired led to his appointment as prefect of Palermo. It was while occupying that position that he put down brigandage throughout the province. In 1868, he was prefect of Naples.

In October 1869 he became minister of the interior in the Menabrea cabinet. The cabinet fell a few months later, and although Starabba was an elected member of parliament for Canicattì, he held no important position until, upon the death of Marco Minghetti in 1886, he became leader of the Right.

===Political career and premierships===
Early in 1891, he succeeded Francesco Crispi as premier and minister of foreign affairs, forming a coalition cabinet with a part of the Left under Giovanni Nicotera. His administration proved vacillating, but it initiated the economic reforms by virtue of which Italian finances were put on a sound basis and also renewed the Triple Alliance.

He was overthrown in May 1892 by a vote of the Chamber and was succeeded by Giovanni Giolitti. Upon the return of his rival, Crispi, to power in December 1893, he resumed political activity, allying himself with the Radical leader, Felice Cavallotti.

The crisis resulting from the disastrous battle of Adowa enabled Rudinì to return to power as premier and minister of the interior in a cabinet formed by the veteran Conservative, General Ricotti. He signed the Treaty of Addis Ababa that formally ended the First Italo–Ethiopian War recognizing Ethiopia as an independent country. He endangered relations with Great Britain by the unauthorized publication of confidential diplomatic correspondence in a Green-book on Abyssinian affairs.

Di Rudinì recognized the excessive brutality of the repression of the Fasci Siciliani under his predecessor Crispi. Many Fasci members were pardoned and released from jail. He made it clear though that a reorganization of the Fasci would not be tolerated. Di Rudini&#x27;s minister of the treasury Luigi Luzzatti passed two measures of social legislation in 1898. The industrial workmen&#x27;s compensation scheme from 1883 was made obligatory with the employer bearing all costs, and a voluntary fund for contributory disability and old age pensions was created.

To satisfy the anti-colonial party, he ceded Kassala to Great Britain, thereby provoking much indignation in Italy. His internal policy was marked by continual yielding to Radical pressure and by the persecution of Crispi. During his second term of office, he thrice modified his cabinet (July 1896, December 1897, and May 1898) without strengthening his political position. By dissolving the Chamber early in 1897 and favouring Radical candidates in the general election, he paved the way for the outbreak of popular uprisings about rising prices in May 1898. Rudinì declared the state of siege at Naples, Florence, Livorno and Milan, and the suppression of the riot resulted in a bloodshed in Milan. Indignation at the results of his policy left him without the support of both the Left – who blamed him for the bloodshed – and the Right – who blamed him for the permissiveness that allegedly had promoted the uprisings and led to his overthrow in June 1898.

===Death and legacy===
Di Rudinì retained his seat in Parliament until his death in 1908. Has reputed to be a thorough gentleman and &quot;grand seigneur&quot;. One of the largest and wealthiest landowners in Sicily, he managed his estates on liberal lines and was never troubled by agrarian disturbances. The marquis, who had not been in office since 1898, died at Rome in August 1908, leaving a son, Carlo, who married a daughter of Henry Labouchère.

In many respects Rudinì, though leader of the Right and nominally a Conservative politician, proved a dissolving element in the Italian Conservative ranks. By his alliance with the Liberals under Nicotera in 1891, and by his understanding with the Radicals under Cavallotti in 1894-1898; by abandoning his Conservative colleague, General Ricotti, to whom he owed the premiership in 1896; and by his vacillating action after his fall from power, he divided and demoralized a constitutional party which, with more sincerity and less reliance upon political cleverness, he might have welded into a solid parliamentary organization.

Many books have been written about his life, including &quot;La settimana dell&#x27;anarchia del 1866 a Palermo&quot; by Gaspare di Mercurio.

==List of Rudinì&#x27;s cabinets==
===1st cabinet (6 February 1891 15 May 1892)===

===2nd cabinet (10 March 1896 15 July 1896)===

===3rd cabinet (15 July 1896 14 December 1897)===

<text>Frank Goad Clement (June 2, 1920 – November 4, 1969) was an American lawyer and politician who served as the 41st Governor of Tennessee from 1953 to 1959 and from 1963 to 1967. Inaugurated for the first time at age 32, he was the state&#x27;s youngest and longest-serving governor in the 20th century. Clement owed much of his rapid political rise to his ability to deliver rousing, mesmerizing speeches. His sermon-like keynote address at the 1956 Democratic National Convention has been described as both one of the best and one of the worst keynote addresses in the era of televised conventions.

As governor, Clement oversaw the state&#x27;s economic transformation from a predominantly agricultural state to an industrial state. He increased funding for education and mental health, and was the first Southern governor to veto a segregation bill. In 1956, he dispatched the National Guard to disperse a crowd attempting to prevent integration at Clinton High School. He attempted to enter national politics, and although his aggressive speeches at the 1956 Democratic national convention impressed some members of his own party, they disgusted many other politicians and brought an end to his federal political career. His final years, including his last term as governor, were marked by severe alcohol abuse which deeply affected his personal and professional life. His wife, tired of his alcoholism, filed for divorce in 1969. He died in a car accident soon after announcing his intention to run for a fourth term, for a fourth separate term and for a third separate four-year term.

==Early life==
Clement was born at the Hotel Halbrook in Dickson, Tennessee, the son of Robert Samuel Clement, a local attorney and politician, and Maybelle (Goad) Clement, who operated the hotel. The family moved around for several years, living briefly in Vermont and Kentucky, before returning to Dickson in the 1930s. Clement graduated from Dickson County High School in 1937. While still young, he took speaking lessons with his aunt.

Clement attended Cumberland University from 1937 to 1939, where he was a member of the Sigma Alpha Epsilon fraternity. He then attended Vanderbilt University Law School, graduating with an LL.B in 1942. He worked as an agent for the FBI for about a year, mainly investigating internal security and espionage cases. In November 1943, at the height of World War II, he enlisted in the U.S. Army, eventually rising to the rank of first lieutenant and commanding officer of Company C of the Military Police Battalion at Camp Bullis in Texas.

After leaving the Army, Clement worked as counsel for the Tennessee Railroad and Public Utilities Commission from 1946 to 1950. He was an alternate delegate to the 1948 Democratic National Convention. During this same period, he was elected State Commander of Tennessee&#x27;s American Legion, a position through which he developed relationships with veterans in all of Tennessee&#x27;s counties. In the early 1950s, he practiced law with his father in Dickson.

==Governor, 1953–1959==

In the 1952 gubernatorial election, Clement challenged incumbent Gordon Browning for the Democratic Party&#x27;s nomination. Browning, nearly twice Clement&#x27;s age, derided Clement as a &quot;demagogue&quot; and &quot;pipsqueak.&quot; Clement had the support of political boss E. H. Crump and &quot;Nashville Banner&quot; publisher James Stahlman, however, and travelled to all 95 of the state&#x27;s counties, giving speeches in which he assailed Browning as &quot;dishonest, indecent, and immoral.&quot; He defeated Browning for the nomination, 302,487 votes to 245,156, and routed the Republican candidate, Madisonville attorney Beecher Witt, in the general election. Clement was only 32 years old when he won the election and took office. Upon inauguration, he became the youngest governor in the nation.

During his first term, Clement authorized a bond issue to provide free textbooks to children in grades 1 through 12, a first for the state (textbooks had previously been free through only the 3rd grade). He also implemented the state&#x27;s first long-range highway construction project, and established a mental health department (now the Department of Mental Health and Substance Abuse Services). Clement raised the state&#x27;s sales tax from 2% to 3%, an unpopular move that would haunt him in later elections.

In 1953, a state constitutional convention proposed eight amendments to the state constitution, all of which were subsequently approved by voters. The amendments included the extension of the gubernatorial term from two to four years, the repeal of the poll tax, and the authorization of consolidated city-county (or &quot;metropolitan&quot;) governments.

While the new constitutional amendments prevented governors from seeking a second consecutive term, Clement was allowed to run for a full four-year term in 1954. He was challenged in the primary by former Governor Browning, who accused Clement and his father of &quot;peddling&quot; state influence. Several of Clement&#x27;s close associates, among them his secretary of state, Eddie Friar, and comptroller, Jean Bodfish, turned against him. Browning was unable to match Clement&#x27;s oratorical skills and fundraising capabilities, however, and lost the nomination, 481,808 votes to 195,156. Clement easily defeated fringe candidate John R. Neal and other token opposition in the general election.

In 1954, the U.S. Supreme Court declared state segregation laws unconstitutional in its landmark decision in &quot;Brown v. Board of Education&quot;. Clement ordered state schools to comply with the law. In 1955, Clement vetoed a bill introduced by 85-year-old state senator Charles Stainback that would have effectively maintained segregation in schools in Fayette and Haywood counties. He also threatened to veto any attempt to change the state&#x27;s mandatory school attendance law, and rejected a request by the Parents School Preference Committee to use the National Guard to prevent integration (as Arkansas Governor Orval Faubus had done). In September 1956, he stationed National Guard troops in Clinton, Tennessee, to protect the first black students to attend Clinton High School from anti-integration protesters.
Constitutionally ineligible to run for governor in 1958, Clement supported the successful run of his campaign manager and Commissioner of Agriculture, Buford Ellington, and returned to the practice of law.

==1956 DNC keynote address==

By the mid-1950s, Clement had national aspirations. During the 1956 presidential race, he was among the candidates on the ballot for the party&#x27;s vice presidential nomination. He was also chosen to give the keynote address at the Democratic National Convention that year in Chicago, as party leaders hoped his speaking ability could help offset the popularity of the Republican incumbent, Dwight D. Eisenhower.

Clement&#x27;s speech resembled a standard Tennessee stump speech, with a strong evangelical, sermon-like tone. He derided the Republican Party as the &quot;party of privilege and pillage,&quot; referred to Vice President Richard Nixon as the &quot;vice hatchet man,&quot; and accused President Eisenhower of staring down the &quot;green fairways of indifference&quot; (a reference to Eisenhower&#x27;s love of golf). He stated that Democrats would not &quot;crucify the American farmer on a Republican cross of gold,&quot; recalling the Cross of Gold speech delivered by William Jennings Bryan at the party&#x27;s 1896 convention. Clement&#x27;s speech is often remembered for his repeated use of the phrase, &quot;How long, America, O how long?&quot;

Clement&#x27;s speech received raucous applause from convention delegates, and was well received by Democrats in general. &quot;Washington Post&quot; columnist Colbert I. King recalled watching the speech as a teenager and thinking afterward that Eisenhower and Nixon had no chance of winning. Future president Bill Clinton, then 9 years old, watched the speech from his parents&#x27; living room, and later described it as a &quot;rousing&quot; address in his memoir, &quot;My Life&quot;. Future Georgia governor Zell Miller, who would later deliver speeches at the 1992 Democratic convention and the 2004 Republican convention, missed the birth of his son to see Clement&#x27;s speech.

Many members of the national media panned Clement&#x27;s speech. &quot;Time&quot; columnist Lance Morrow called the speech a &quot;symphony of rhetorical excess.&quot; &quot;New York Herald Tribune&quot; writer Red Smith likened the speech to &quot;slaying the Republicans with the jawbone of an ass.&quot; David Halberstam described it as a &quot;thundering overheated, overlong, overkill speech&quot; that ended Clement&#x27;s career as a national politician. Evangelist Billy Graham disapproved of the speech, and distanced himself from Clement afterward. Arthur Langlie, who was slated to deliver the keynote address at the Republican convention later that year, stated, &quot;I&#x27;ll be passing up the Chicago brand of prejudicial fire and brimstone.&quot;

==Governor, 1963–1967==
In 1962, Clement once again sought the party&#x27;s nomination for governor. In the primary, he defeated Memphis attorney Bill Farris and Chattanooga mayor Rudy Olgiati, 309,333 votes to 211,812 for Olgiati and 202,813 for Farris. In the general election, he defeated Maryville attorney Hubert Patty, the Republican candidate, and retired naval captain William Anderson of Waverly, who was running as an independent.

When Senator Estes Kefauver died in office in August 1963, Clement surprised some by not appointing himself to the office, but rather a caretaker, Herbert S. Walters. However, Clement did enter the 1964 Democratic primary for the seat, losing to Congressman Ross Bass of Pulaski by a vote of 330,213 to 233,245. During the campaign, Clement was attacked for the sales tax increase enacted during his first tenure as governor.

Clement&#x27;s alcohol addiction reached a critical level during the 1960s. His alcoholism caused him to become alienated from many of his friends and affected his thinking ability. Although newspapers did not extensively cover his addiction to liquor, friends and family members noticed that Clement spent much time drinking and lost some of his political effectiveness.

Since the 1964 election was for the balance of Kefauver&#x27;s unexpired term, the seat was to be contested again in 1966. In the primary, Clement defeated Bass for the nomination, 384,322 votes to 366,078. His campaign faltered in the general election, however, as his long-time political ally, Buford Ellington, refused to endorse him, and he failed to pick up critical endorsements from the &quot;Nashville Tennessean&quot;, the &quot;Nashville Banner&quot;, and the &quot;Memphis Commercial Appeal&quot;. The Republican candidate, rising politician Howard Baker, successfully connected Clement to President Lyndon B. Johnson&#x27;s social policies, which were unpopular among rural Tennesseans. On election day, Baker defeated Clement, by a vote to of 483,063 (56%) to 383,843 (44%).

==Later life and other work==

After leaving office, Clement practiced law in partnership with Grant Smith. His wife, who had become tired of her husband&#x27;s alcoholism, filed for divorce in 1969. He announced his intention to run for a fourth term as governor in 1970, but on November 4, 1969, shortly after the start of his campaign, he was involved in a car crash near Nashville and was pronounced dead at Nashville General Hospital. At the time of his death, he and his estranged wife were headed towards reconciliation. His 10 total years as governor of Tennessee are the longest any person served in the position in the 20th century, and longer than all but two 19th-century governors, John Sevier and William Carroll. His remains were interred at Dickson County Memorial Gardens near Dickson.

In 1959, Clement served as honorary Co-Chairman on the Board of Directors for the newly founded Country Music Association (CMA). He and Albert Gore, Sr., were bestowed this honor in appreciation for their public service to the state of Tennessee and their support in accommodating the country music industry. In 1970, the CMA honored Clement with the Connie B. Gay Award in recognition of his outstanding service to the association.

Clement was a 32nd degree Mason and a member of the Shriners. He was also an active Methodist, and taught Sunday school throughout the 1960s.

==Family and legacy==
Clement&#x27;s sister, Anna Belle Clement O&#x27;Brien (1923–2009), worked as his chief of staff in the 1960s, and later served in the state legislature, initially in the state House of Representatives (1975–1977), and afterward in the state senate (1977–1991).

Clement married Lucille Christianson in 1940. They had three sons, two of whom are still living. Bob Clement has served as Tennessee Public Service Commissioner, director of the Tennessee Valley Authority, president of Cumberland University, and a member of the United States House of Representatives from 1987 to 2003. Frank G. Clement, Jr., has been an attorney, a probate court judge, and currently serves on the Tennessee Court of Appeals.

The Hotel Halbrook, where Clement was born in Dickson, is now home to the Clement Railroad Hotel Museum, and has been listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Clement&#x27;s namesakes include buildings at Austin Peay State University, the University of Tennessee, Tennessee Tech, Tennessee State University, and the University of Tennessee at Martin, as well as a golf course at Montgomery Bell State Park and a bridge over Barren Fork in McMinnville.

<text>William Alexander (13 April 1824 – 12 September 1911) was an Irish cleric in the Church of Ireland.

== Life ==

He was born in Derry on 13 April 1824, the third child of the Revd Robert Alexander. He was educated at Tonbridge School and Brasenose College, Oxford. During his time in Oxford he came under the influence of the Oxford Movement. Due to illness his academic record failed to live up to his promise, but he nonetheless displayed a solid scholarship which was to stand him in good stead in later life.

After holding several livings in Ireland, including the rectories of Fahan and later Camus-juxta-Mourne (Strabane), he was Dean of Emly from 1864 to 1867, resigning on becoming Bishop of Derry and Raphoe, to which see he was nominated on 27 July and consecrated on 6 October 1867. He and three of his brother bishops were the last bishops of Ireland to sit in the Westminster House of Lords before the disestablishment of the Church of Ireland in 1871 by the Irish Church Act 1869. On 25 February 1896 he was translated to become Archbishop of Armagh and Primate of All Ireland.

In the years 1871 to 1877 he was much involved in the reorganisation of the Church of Ireland and was one of the conservative voices, along with the primate, Marcus Beresford, Archbishop Trench, and Bishop John Gregg of Cork, that preserved the close identity of the Irish Book of Common Prayer with that of the Church of England. He did however regret some of the more aggressively anti-Ritualist provisions in the Irish canons, such as that prohibiting the placement of a cross upon the holy table. He gave the Bampton Lectures in 1876. An eloquent preacher and the author of numerous theological works, including &quot;Primary Convictions&quot;, he is best known as a master of dignified and animated verse. His poems were collected in 1887 under the title of &quot;St Augustine&#x27;s Holiday and other Poems&quot;.

His wife, Cecil Frances Alexander, wrote some tracts in connection with the Oxford Movement. She is known as the author of many well-known hymns, including &quot;Once in Royal David&#x27;s City&quot;, &quot;All Things Bright and Beautiful&quot;. They both lived in Milltown House, Strabane. The house is now used as a school, Strabane Grammar School. Their daughter, Eleanor Jane Alexander, was also a poet and novelist.
In March 1913, a stained glass window by James Powell and Sons was erected in memory of him in the east wall of the side chapel of St Columb&#x27;s Cathedral, financed by public subscription. The lower panels depict Moses, King David, and Isaiah in reference to his qualities as leader, poet, and preacher. His closing words of his resignation speech in February 1911 are quoted at the bottom: &quot;Not in wisdom of words, lest the Cross of Christ be made void&quot; (1 Cor 1:17).

There is a memorial to Alexander in the south aisle at St Patrick&#x27;s Cathedral, Armagh.

<text>Harold Mead Stark (born August 6, 1939)
is an American mathematician, specializing in number theory. He is best known for his solution of the Gauss class number 1 problem, in effect correcting and completing the earlier work of Kurt Heegner, and for Stark&#x27;s conjecture. More recently, he collaborated with Audrey Terras to study zeta functions in graph theory. He is currently on the faculty of the University of California, San Diego.

Stark received his bachelor&#x27;s degree from the California Institute of Technology in 1961 and his PhD from the University of California, Berkeley in 1964. He was on the faculty at the University of Michigan from 1964 to 1968, at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology from 1968 to 1980, and at the University of California, San Diego from 1980 to the present.

Stark was elected to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1983 and to the United States National Academy of Sciences in 2007. In 2012, he became a fellow of the American Mathematical Society.

<text>Knik Arm (Dena&#x27;ina: &quot;Nuti&quot;) is a waterway into the northwestern part of the Gulf of Alaska. It is one of two narrow branches of Cook Inlet, the other being Turnagain Arm. Knik Glacier empties into the Knik Arm. The Port of Anchorage is located on the arm.

==Etymology==
The Dena&#x27;ina name for Knik Arm is &quot;Nuti&quot;, meaning &quot;salt water&quot;. The name &quot;Knik&quot; comes from &quot;igniq&quot;, the Iñupiaq word for &quot;fire&quot;. It has been written Kinik, Kneep, Kneik, Kook, Knuyk, and Kweek.

==Geography==
Knik Arm begins at the Inlet&#x27;s northern edge, near Anchorage, before heading north and east. It is about long, and at its upper end, receives the waters of the Matanuska River. West of Knik Arm is the delta of the Susitna River, the largest stream emptying into the inlet. At the head of Knik Arm, at the mouth of Knik River, was the village (ghost town) of Knik. Knik Arm&#x27;s other major tributaries are Ship Creek, Eagle River, Peter&#x27;s Creek, Eklutna River and Fish Creek. The greater part of the plain, lying between the Knik Arm and the Susitna River, is drained by the Little Susitna. The upper part of Knik Arm merges into the delta of the Knik and Matanuska rivers, which unite just above tide limits.

==History==
Knakatnuk and Nitak (or Nitakh) were historic native villages on the arm&#x27;s shore. The 1964 Alaska earthquake destroyed or significantly damaged most of the Anchorage neighborhoods adjacent to the Arm, including the downtown area. The proposed Knik Arm Bridge would measure approximately from Point MacKenzie on the west in the Matanuska-Susitna Borough to Anchorage on the east. The Knik Arm ferry was a proposed year-round passenger and auto ferry across the arm which was to use the M/V &quot;Susitna&quot; SWATH / barge convertible expedition craft.

<text>Martyrs Mirror or The Bloody Theater, first published in Holland in 1660 in Dutch by Thieleman J. van Braght, documents the stories and testimonies of Christian martyrs, especially Anabaptists. The full title of the book is The Bloody Theater or Martyrs Mirror of the Defenseless Christians who baptized only upon confession of faith, and who suffered and died for the testimony of Jesus, their Saviour, from the time of Christ to the year A.D. 1660. The use of the word &quot;defenseless&quot; in this case refers to the Anabaptist belief in non-resistance. The book includes accounts of the martyrdom of the apostles and the stories of martyrs from previous centuries with beliefs similar to the Anabaptists.

Next to the Bible, the &quot;Martyrs Mirror&quot; has historically held the most significant and prominent place in Amish and Mennonite homes.

In 1745, Jacob Gottschalk arranged with the Ephrata Cloister to have them translate the &quot;Martyrs Mirror&quot; from Dutch into German and to print it. The work took 15 men three years to finish and in 1749, at 1,512 pages, it was the largest book printed in America before the Revolutionary War. An original volume is on display at the Ephrata Cloister.

The 1685 edition of the book is illustrated with 104 copper etchings by Jan Luyken. Thirty-one of these plates survive and are part of the &quot;Mirror of the Martyrs&quot; exhibit at Bethel College in North Newton, Kansas. Two of the copper plates are located at the Muddy Creek Farm Library established by Amos B. Hoover in Ephrata, Pennsylvania.

The first English edition, translated from German by I. Daniel Rupp, was published by David Miller near Lampeter Square, Lancaster County, Pennsylvania, in 1837. An edition entitled &quot;A Martyrology of the Churches of Christ&quot; was translated and printed in England in 1850 in 2 volumes by Edward Bean Underhill under the auspices of the Hanserd Knollys Society in England.
The &quot;Martyrs Mirror&quot; differs from &quot;Foxe&#x27;s Book of Martyrs&quot; in that it only includes those martyrs which were considered nonresistant, while Foxe&#x27;s book does not include many Anabaptist martyrs.

The &quot;Martyrs Mirror&quot; is still a beloved book among Amish and Mennonites. While less common now than in the 20th century, in Mennonite homes &quot;Martyrs Mirror&quot; is a common wedding gift.

<text>Turnagain Arm (Dena&#x27;ina: &quot;Tutl&#x27;uh&quot;) is a waterway into the northwestern part of the Gulf of Alaska. It is one of two narrow branches at the north end of Cook Inlet, the other being Knik Arm. Turnagain is subject to climate extremes and large tide ranges.

==Geography==

Turnagain extends in an east–west direction, and is between long. It forms part of the northern boundary of Kenai Peninsula, and reaches on the east to within of Passage Canal, a western branch of Prince William Sound. Turnagain is characterized by remarkably large tides of up to which are the largest tides in the United States. The flood tide often begins with a tidal bore especially on large tides with a strong east wind, which has a height of at times, and runs in from the west at a speed of an hour. At low tide, the arm becomes a broad mud flat, cut by the stream channels. Historically small steamers entered and left on high water though the practice is now rare since most if not all the places that they went are now connected by road. 

The region adjacent to Turnagain Arm is very rugged. South Suicide Peak (Now known as South Yuyanq&#x27; Ch&#x27;ex) is the tallest mountain rising from the north side of Turnagain, and Mount Alpenglow the highest on the south side. Mountains rise precipitously on both sides of the arm and reach altitudes of . Their tops are ragged and bare. The timber rarely reaches higher than . The smaller valleys are narrow and steep, but the larger ones frequently show by their U-shaped cross section the former presence of glaciers. Glaciers may be still seen at a number of places. Chief among them are Portage Glacier, occupying the Portage Valley between the head of Turnagain Arm and Passage Canal, the two neighboring glaciers which form the headwaters of the Glacier River and Twentymile River, Explorer Glacier, and Skookum Glacier. Besides these, there are several smaller ones on tributaries of Glacier Creek.

The Seward Highway follows a portion of the southern edge of the Chugach State Park along Turnagain Arm. Turnagain Arm boasts the second highest tides in North America after the Bay of Fundy. These tides, which can reach , come in so quickly that they produce a wave known as a bore tide. Adventurous kayakers and surfers have taken to riding the tide as an extreme sport. Hikers should take care not to get stuck in the quicksand-like mudflats that otherwise make up the beaches along Turnagain Arm.

Turnagain Arm communities within the Municipality of Anchorage include Indian, Bird, and Girdwood, all along the north shore of the Arm. Portage, at the eastern tip or head of the Arm, is a former settlement destroyed in the 1964 Alaska earthquake. Beluga Point Site, also known as ANC-054, is an archaeological location on the north shore of the Arm, while Alaska Wildlife Conservation Center is situated at the head of the Arm near the site of Portage.

==Tributaries==
Major tributaries of Turnagain Arm include the Twentymile River, Portage River, and Placer River. Minor tributaries include Resurrection Creek, Bear Creek, Sixmile Creek, and Glacier Creek, with their branches. Resurrection Creek flows into the south side of the arm about east of the main body of Cook Inlet, and with Sixmile Creek, farther east; with its various branches, it drains a large part of the northeastern portion of Kenai Peninsula. Resurrection Creek flows in a direction slightly east of north. The town of Hope is located near its mouth. Palmer Creek is its largest tributary.

Bear Creek flows into Turnagain Arm east of the mouth of Resurrection Creek. It is nearly long, and follows a northwesterly course through a steep, narrow valley. Bear and Palmer creeks are the two producing streams of this part of the field, and both are connected with Hope by roads.

The drainage area of Sixmile Creek is much larger than that of Resurrection Creek, and the stream is formed by the confluence of two large branches, which unite south of Sunrise, the mining camp at its mouth. The larger of the two forks, known as the East Fork, is itself formed by the confluence of a number of small streams. The more important of these are Gulch and Granite creeks on the north, and Lynx and Silvertip creeks on the south. The smaller fork, Canyon Creek, flows almost directly northward and, with its eastern tributary, Mills Creek, has been the chief producer of the Turnagain Arm field.

Glacier Creek enters Turnagain Arm from the north, from its eastern end. It is one of the larger tributaries of Turnagain Arm from the north and joins the Arm at a point from Seward by way of the Alaska Northern Railroad survey.

==History==
The Dena&#x27;ina called Turnagain Arm &quot;Tutl&#x27;uh&quot;, meaning &quot;back water&quot;.

Turnagain Arm was named by William Bligh of HMS &quot;Bounty&quot; fame. Bligh served as Cook&#x27;s Sailing Master on his third and final voyage, the aim of which was discovery of the Northwest Passage. Upon reaching the head of Cook Inlet in 1778, Bligh was of the opinion that both Knik Arm and Turnagain Arm were the mouths of rivers and not the opening to the Northwest Passage. Under Cook&#x27;s orders Bligh organized a party to travel up Knik Arm, which quickly returned to report Knik Arm indeed led only to a river.

Afterwards a second party was dispatched up Turnagain Arm and it too returned to report only a river lay ahead. As a result of this frustration the second body of water was given the disingenuous name &quot;Turn Again&quot;. Early maps label Turnagain Arm as the &quot;Turnagain River&quot;.
The mineral resources of the Turnagain-Knik region are notable for gold placers and the gold quartz lodes. From 1896 to 1898, a large number of placer claims were staked on the streams tributary to Turnagain Arm from the north, and on a few of these claims, notably those on lower Crow Creek, mining was carried out in subsequent years. The output of placer gold was derived from the Turnagain Arm slope of the mountains. Development work on gold quartz lodes was confined largely to the Turnagain Arm basin.

==Geology==
The eastern portion of Kenai Peninsula and the region about the head of Turnagain Arm present a succession of rocks, which as a whole are of remarkably uniform appearance and composition. They are of sedimentary origin and consist chiefly of fine-grained gray and bluish-black slates and gray arkoses. Interstratified with these, but in far less amount, are quartzose beds and occasional thin conglomerates. In a few places north of Turnagain Arm this series of rocks, called by Mendenhall &quot;the Sunrise series&quot;, is cut by dikes of igneous rock of an aplitic or granitic character. These igneous rocks were not found in the region immediately south of the arm. The whole rock succession is closely folded, and the arkoses as well as the slates show cleavage, which is, however, much more perfectly developed in the slates. Immense deposits of gravel occur at a number of localities, but are especially noticeable in the valleys of Sixmile Creek, Resurrection Creek, and Kenai River. The flat-topped benches have an elevation of nearly above sea level around the lower end of Kenai Lake, and the same elevation was observed in the valleys of the streams mentioned. The bench gravels show a thickness of in the upper valleys, where they have been cut through by the streams. Evidences of a former period of glacial activity are seen on all sides in broad-bottomed U-shaped valleys, polished rock surfaces, and transported boulders. The shores of Turnagain Arm afford frequent proof of ice action in glacial markings and striated pebbles. Hanging valleys are not uncommon.

==Flora and fauna==

The east shore along the Kenai Peninsula, from the mouth of Turnagain Arm nearly to Kachemak Bay, is low and comparatively flat, but is for the most part heavily wooded. 
The flora of the mountainous district about Turnagain Arm is different from that of the coastal plains of other parts of the inlet. The low country near Hope consists of a grassy tide flat, about 50 acres in extent, and a few miles of forest and occasional small swamps along the lower part of Resurrection Creek. Balsam poplars, paper birches, alders, and willows abound near the streams, and spruces (&quot;Picea canadensis&quot; and &quot;Picea sitchensis&quot;) and hemlocks (&quot;Tsuga mertensiana&quot;) are common on the slopes and slightly elevated flats. A third species of spruce (&quot;Picea mariana&quot;) is found in the small peat bogs, along with smaller Hudsonian plants. (&quot;Ledum&quot;), crowberry (&quot;Empetrum&quot;), and dwarf birch (&quot;Betula glandulosa&quot;) are in profusion. Of the larger trees, the hemlock is abundant, but it is exceeded in individual size by the spruces. The conifers ascend the mountain slopes to about but above that point rapidly disappear. Beyond this elevation are alder thickets, small patches of dwarf willows and birches, and vast stretches of waving grass from high.

Still higher, the slopes and rounded backs of the ridges are cushioned with a mass of heather and heather-like shrubs, chiefly &quot;Empetrum nigrum&quot;. This extends up to an approximate altitude of , above which there is very little or no plant growth. The whole country is characterized by the abundance of high grass; otherwise it is a typical Hudsonian-Alpine region.

Dall sheep, hoary marmot, American black bear, American marten, and long-tailed chickadee are noted. An endangered population of Beluga Whales are commonly seen traversing the waterway with rising and falling tides.

On May 3, 2019, a Falcated Duck was spotted at Potter Marsh, a first for the area and the whole state of Alaska. The last sighting was on May 4, 2019

<text>Bryan Bartlett Starr (January 9, 1934 – May 26, 2019) was an American professional football quarterback and head coach for the Green Bay Packers of the National Football League (NFL). He played college football for the Alabama Crimson Tide, and was selected in the 17th round of the 1956 NFL draft by the Packers, for whom he played for 16 seasons until 1971. Starr is the only quarterback in NFL history to lead a team to three consecutive league championships (1965–1967). He led his team to victories in the first two Super Bowls: I and II. As the Packers&#x27; head coach, he was less successful, compiling a 52–76–3 () record from 1975 through 1983.

Starr was named the Most Valuable Player (MVP) of the first two Super Bowls and during his career earned four Pro Bowl selections. He won the league MVP (MVP) award in 1966. He was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame and the Packers Hall of Fame in 1977. Starr has the second highest postseason passer rating (104.8), after Patrick Mahomes (106.3), of any quarterback in NFL history and a postseason record of 9–1. His career completion percentage of 57.4 was an NFL best when he retired in 1972. For 32 years (through the 2003 season), Starr also held the Packers&#x27; franchise record for games played (196).

==Early life==
Starr was born and raised in Montgomery, Alabama to parents Benjamin Bryan Starr (1910–1985), a labor foreman with the state highway department, and Lula (Tucker) Starr (1916–1995). Starr&#x27;s early life was marked by hardships. Shortly after the start of World War II, his father&#x27;s reserve unit was activated and in 1942 he was deployed to the Pacific Theater. He was first in the U.S. Army but transferred to the U.S. Air Force for his military career.

Starr had a younger brother, Hilton E. &quot;Bubba&quot; Starr. In 1946, Bubba stepped on a dog bone while playing in the yard and three days later died of tetanus. Starr&#x27;s relationship with his father deteriorated after Hilton&#x27;s death. He was an introverted child who rarely showed his emotions and his father pushed Starr to develop more of a mean streak.

Starr attended Sidney Lanier High School in Montgomery, and tried out for the football team in his sophomore year, but decided to quit after two weeks. His father gave him the option of playing football or working in the family garden; Starr chose to return to the football field.

In his junior year, the starting quarterback broke his leg and Starr became the starter. He led Lanier to an undefeated season. In his senior season, Starr was named all-state and All-American, and received college scholarship offers from universities across the country. He seriously considered the University of Kentucky, coached by Bear Bryant, where his idol, quarterback Babe Parilli, played. Starr&#x27;s high school sweetheart, Cherry Louise Morton, was planning to attend Auburn and Starr wished to attend a college close to her. Starr changed his mind and committed to the University of Alabama.

==College career==
During Starr’s freshman year at Alabama, the Southeastern Conference allowed freshmen to play varsity football. Starr did not start for Alabama as a freshman, but he did play enough minutes to earn a varsity letter. His high point of the season came in quarterback relief in the Orange Bowl, when he completed 8 of 12 passes for 93 yards and a touchdown against Syracuse.

Starr entered his sophomore year as Alabama&#x27;s starting quarterback, safety and punter. His punting average of 41.4 yards per kick ranked second in the nation in 1953, behind Zeke Bratkowski. Alabama recorded a 6–2–3 record and lost in the Cotton Bowl to Rice by a score of 28–6. Starr completed 59 of 119 passes for 870 yards, with eight touchdowns that season.

In May 1954, Starr eloped with Cherry Morton. The couple chose to keep their marriage a secret. Colleges often revoked the scholarships of married athletes in the 1950s, believing their focus should remain on sports. Cherry remained in Jackson, Alabama, while Starr returned to the University of Alabama.

That summer, Starr suffered a severe back injury during a hazing incident for his initiation into the A Club. He covered up the cause by fabricating a story about being hurt while punting a football. He rarely played during his junior year due to the injury. The back injury disqualified him later from military service, and would occasionally bother him the rest of his football career. After a disappointing season of 4–5–2, Harold Drew was replaced by Jennings B. Whitworth as coach of Alabama.

Whitworth conducted a youth movement at Alabama for the 1955 season and only two seniors started for the team. Supposedly healed from the back injury, Starr rarely played in his senior season. Starr&#x27;s decision to play football for Alabama rather than for Bear Bryant at the University of Kentucky did not sit well with Bryant, and four years later as head coach of the Blue–Gray Football Classic in 1955, Bryant hardly let Bart play at all.

Johnny Dee, the basketball coach at Alabama, was a friend of Jack Vainisi, the personnel director of the Green Bay Packers. Dee recommended Starr as a prospect to Vainisi. The Packers were convinced that Starr had the ability to succeed in the NFL and would learn quickly. In the 17th round of the 1956 NFL draft, Starr was selected by the Packers, with the 200th overall pick.

Starr spent the summer of 1956 living with his in-laws and throwing footballs through a tire in their backyard in order to prepare for his rookie season. The Packers offered $6,500 (equal to $ today) to sign Starr and he accepted, with the added condition, requested by Starr, that he receive $1,000 up front.

==Professional career==
Starr began as a backup to Tobin Rote in 1956 and split time with Babe Parilli until 1959, Vince Lombardi&#x27;s first year as Packers coach. In that season, Lombardi pulled starter Lamar McHan in favor of Starr, and he held the starting job henceforth. The following season, the Packers advanced to the 1960 NFL Championship Game, but lost to the Philadelphia Eagles in Lombardi&#x27;s only post-season loss as a head coach.

The 1961 season was Starr&#x27;s first season as a full-time starting quarterback for the Packers, throwing for over 2,400 yards and 16 touchdown passes, leading the Packers to an 11-3 record and a return to the NFL Championship Game, this time against the New York Giants. Starr threw for 164 yards and 3 touchdowns in a 37-0 Packers victory. Starr and the Packers continued their success in 1962, going 13-1. Even though Starr was not the focal point of the Packers&#x27; offense, with the running duo of Jim Taylor and Paul Hornung, he still provided a solid passing attack, throwing for a career-high 2,438 yards and 14 touchdowns, leading the league with a completion percentage of 62.5. The Packers repeated as NFL champions, beating the Giants again in the 1962 NFL Championship game, 16-7. While not as impressive with his passing in the early years of his career, Starr was responsible for calling plays on the Packers&#x27; offense (which was then the norm), proving to be an effective strategist on offense.

In 1963, the Packers fell short of qualifying for their fourth consecutive NFL Championship Game appearance, with injuries to Starr keeping him from finishing a few games. Even so, Starr still threw for 1,855 yards and 15 touchdowns. In 1964, with Jim Taylor and Paul Hornung struggling to continue their strong running game, Starr started to become more of the focus of the Packers&#x27; offensive attack. Vince Lombardi would help this shift by acquiring more capable pass catchers to the offense, trading for receiver Carroll Dale to join with Boyd Dowler and Max McGee, replacing tight end Ron Kramer with Marv Fleming, and drafting more pass-catching running backs in Elijah Pitts and Donny Anderson. With these new offensive weapons, Starr would put up his best passing seasons from 1964 to 1969. In 1964, despite the Packers only going 8-5-1, Starr threw for 2,144 yards, 15 touchdown passes, and only 4 interceptions. He led the league with a 97.1 passer rating.

In 1965, the Packers went 10-3-1, led by Starr&#x27;s 2,055 passing yards and 16 touchdown passes, a career-high. The Packers and their Western division foe, the Baltimore Colts, finished the season with identical records, so the two teams met in a playoff game to determine the division winner. Starr was knocked out of the game after the first play when he suffered a rib injury from a hard hit, but the Packers managed to win in overtime, 13-10, led by Starr&#x27;s backup, Zeke Bratkowski. Starr came back and started the 1965 NFL Championship Game against the Cleveland Browns. On a sloppy Lambeau field, the Packers went back to their classic backfield tandem of Taylor and Hornung, with the pair running for over 200 yards. Starr threw for only 147 yards, but that included a 47-yard touchdown pass to Carroll Dale in a 23-12 Packers victory.

In 1966, Starr had arguably the best season of his career, throwing for 2,257 yards, 14 touchdown passes, and only 3 interceptions. He led the NFL with a completion percentage of 62.2 and a 105 passer rating, while leading the Packers to a dominating 12-2 record. Starr would be named the NFL&#x27;s Most Valuable Player by the Associated Press (AP), the Sporting News, the Newspaper Enterprise Association (NEA), and the UPI In the NFL Championship Game against the Dallas Cowboys, Starr had his best postseason performance, throwing for 304 yards and 4 touchdown passes, leading the Packers to a 34-27 victory, and the right to represent the NFL in the first ever Super Bowl, against the AFL champion Kansas City Chiefs. Starr had another solid game against the Chiefs, throwing for 250 yards and two touchdowns, both to Max McGee, in a decisive 35-10 Packers win. Starr was named the first-ever Super Bowl MVP for his performance.

1967 was a down year for Starr, especially when compared to his previous three seasons. Bothered by a hand injury for much of the season, Starr threw for only 1,823 yards and 9 touchdowns, with a career-high 17 interceptions thrown. Helped in large part by their defense, the Packers still finished 9-4-1, which was good enough for the Packers to reach the postseason. In the divisional playoff against the Los Angeles Rams, Starr was back in form, throwing for 222 yards and a touchdown pass in a 28-7 Packers triumph. This victory would set the stage for the infamous Ice Bowl against the Dallas Cowboys in the 1967 NFL Championship Game. Consulting with Lombardi on the sideline, Starr suggested a basic wedge play ― with a twist. Instead of handing off to Chuck Mercein as the play dictated (and unbeknownst to his teammates), Starr suggested running it in himself. Having enough of the bitterly cold weather, Lombardi said, &quot;Then do it, and let&#x27;s get the hell out of here!&quot; Starr almost broke down in laughter as he ran back to the huddle, but held his composure. The quarterback sneak play worked and the Packers went on to beat the Cowboys 21-17. Even in the cold conditions, Starr was still able to throw for 191 yards in the Ice Bowl, with two touchdown passes to Boyd Dowler.

At the Orange Bowl in Miami, the Packers defeated the AFL champion Oakland Raiders 33–14 in Super Bowl II, Lombardi&#x27;s final game as head coach of the Packers. Starr won his second consecutive Super Bowl MVP award for his performance, where he threw for 202 yards and a touchdown pass, a 62-yard strike to Boyd Dowler. The 1967 Packers remain the only team to win a third consecutive NFL title since the playoff system was instituted in 1933.

Starr had originally planned to retire after the second Super Bowl win in January 1968, but without a clear successor and a new head coach, he stayed on. After Lombardi&#x27;s departure, Starr continued to be a productive quarterback under new Packers coach Phil Bengtson, though injuries hampered him. Starr threw for 15 touchdown passes in 1968, leading the NFL once again in completion percentage (63.7) and passer rating (104.3). Starr struggled to stay healthy again in 1969, but still once again led the league with a 62.2 completion percentage and an 89.9 passer rating, but only threw for 9 touchdowns and 1,161 yards. Starr was able to stay healthy for most of the entire 1970 season, but his age was showing, throwing for only 1,645 yards and 8 touchdowns, the last touchdown passes of his career. In an attempt to prolong his career, Starr had surgeries on his long-ailing throwing arm in July and August 1971. This nearly ended Starr&#x27;s life, as the initial surgery was botched, nearly causing Starr to bleed to death. The surgeries ended up damaging the nerves in Starr&#x27;s right arm, causing him to struggle to even grip a football, and while he stayed on the Packers&#x27; roster for the entire 1971 season, he only played in three games, usually with a glove on his throwing hand to try to regain his grip on the ball. In February 1972 Starr was set for one last year. He participated in the team&#x27;s spring camp in Arizona in April, but his throwing shoulder and arm were no longer effective. Starr announced his retirement in July 1972 at age 38.

Starr&#x27;s playing career ended with the 1971 season, having posted the fourth-best career passer rating of 80.5 (First at the time was Otto Graham with 86.6).

==Coaching career==
Immediately following his retirement as a player, Starr served as the Packers&#x27; quarterbacks coach and called plays in 1972 under head coach Dan Devine, when the Packers won the NFC Central division title at 10–4 with Scott Hunter under center. He pursued business interests and was then a broadcaster for CBS for two seasons. When Devine left for Notre Dame after the 1974 season, Starr was hired as head coach of the Packers on Christmas Eve. Upon taking the job, he recognized the long odds of a Hall of Fame player becoming a successful head coach. Initially given a three-year contract, he led the Packers for nine years, the first five as his own general manager.

His regular season record was a disappointing 52–76–2 (), with a playoff record of 1–1. Posting a 5–3–1 record in the strike-shortened season of 1982, Starr&#x27;s Packers made their first playoff appearance in ten years (and their last for another 11 years). They defeated the St. Louis Cardinals 41–16 in the expanded wild card round of 16 teams on January 8, 1983–their first home playoff game since 1967. However, they then lost to the Dallas Cowboys 37–26 in the divisional round the following week. He tallied only three other non-losing seasons as Packers coach. After a disappointing 8–8 finish the following year, Starr was dismissed in favor of his former teammate Forrest Gregg, who previously led the Cincinnati Bengals to Super Bowl XVI in the 1981 season and had coached the Cleveland Browns prior to that.

On January 13, 1984, Starr was named the head coach of the Arizona Firebirds, a proposed expansion team for the NFL in Phoenix. The NFL never granted the would-be ownership group of the Firebirds a team (Phoenix would get the Cardinals in 1988).

==Honors==

Starr was voted to the NFL Pro Bowl four times. He was voted NFL Most Valuable Player by both AP and UPI in 1966, and was chosen Super Bowl MVP in 1966 and 1967. He was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1977.

He is one of six Green Bay Packers to have had his number &quot;(15)&quot; retired by the team. The others are Tony Canadeo &quot;(3)&quot;, Don Hutson &quot;(14)&quot;, Ray Nitschke &quot;(66)&quot;, Reggie White &quot;(92)&quot;, and Brett Favre &quot;(4)&quot;.

On October 17, 1970, President Richard Nixon spoke at a testimonial reception honoring Bart Starr in the Brown County Veterans Memorial Arena in Green Bay, Wisconsin. &quot;We honor him as a very great practitioner of his profession, the proud profession of professional football,&quot; Nixon said. &quot;And as we honor him for that, we honor him not only for his technical skill but, as I&#x27;ve indicated, also for something that is just as important: his leadership qualities, his character, his moral fiber ... But I think the best way that I can present Bart Starr to his friends is to say very simply that the sixties will be described as the decade in which football became the number one sport in America, in which the Packers were the number one team, and Bart Starr was proudly the number one Packer.&quot;

In 1973, Starr received the Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement.

In 1977, Starr was inducted into the Green Bay Packers Hall of Fame. He was then elected to the Wisconsin Athletic Hall of Fame in 1981.

Starr has an NFL award named after him. The Athletes in Action/Bart Starr Award is given annually, by a panel of judges, to an NFL player who best exemplifies outstanding character and leadership in the home, on the field, and in the community.

There is a Bart Starr Street in San Antonio, Texas.

==Personal life==
Starr and his wife Cherry were married for more than 60 years. They had two sons, of whom the younger, Bret, is deceased (1988, age 24, drug overdose), and three granddaughters.

In 1965, Starr and his wife Cherry helped co-found Rawhide Boys Ranch in New London, Wisconsin, a facility designed to help at-risk and troubled boys throughout the state of Wisconsin. Starr even donated the Corvette he received as MVP of Super Bowl II to help Rawhide during their early years. He was affiliated with Rawhide Boys Ranch until his death. As of 2019, Cherry and Bart Jr. are still spokespersons for Rawhide and are in communication with Rawhide on a frequent basis.

In 1971, Starr and his wife Cherry helped start the Vince Lombardi Cancer Foundation raising funds for cancer research and care in honor of his late coach, Vince Lombardi. They were active at all their events throughout the years. He and Cherry launched the Starr Children&#x27;s Fund within the Vince Lombardi Cancer Foundation to continue their legacy of work supporting pediatric cancer research and care.

During his latter years, Starr suffered a number of physical ailments, including ischemic stroke, hemorrhagic stroke, a mild heart attack, seizures, and a broken hip. In June 2015, Starr&#x27;s family reported that he was undergoing stem-cell therapy in a clinical trial. He managed to attend a ceremony at Lambeau Field on November 26, 2015, retiring QB Brett Favre&#x27;s jersey number, and a fall 2017 reunion of the Ice Bowl Packers. At Super Bowl 50 in February 2016, the NFL held a pregame ceremony honoring the MVPs of all 49 Super Bowls. Although he wished to attend, Starr was not well enough to travel to the game and instead sent a videotaped greeting from home.

Starr died at the age of 85 on Sunday, May 26, 2019, in Birmingham, Alabama after a period of failing health caused by a serious stroke he suffered in 2014.

<text>Bibleman is an American Christian-themed direct-to-video children&#x27;s series created by Tony Salerno that ran from 1995 to 2010. The series centers around an evangelical superhero who fights evil, often by quoting scripture, and sometimes breaks the fourth wall. 

The show had three incarnations: The Bibleman Show, The Bibleman Adventure, and Bibleman: Powersource. The series&#x27; titular character was played by Willie Aames from 1995 to 2003 and by Robert T. Schlipp from 2004 to 2010. Originally owned by Pamplin Entertainment, then sold to Tommy Nelson, the series is currently owned by B&amp;H Kids. It was re-launched in CGI format in 2016 (new title Bibleman: The Animated Adventures).

&quot;Bibleman&quot; was also broadcast on the Australian Christian Channel in Australia.

==Plot==
Miles B. Peterson is a wealthy man who turns to God after he finds a Bible in some mud. From then on, he pledges to fight evil with the word of God. Disguised in the full armor of God, Bibleman fights against enemies using scripture and a lightsaber.

==Characters==

===Heroes===
Miles Peterson/Bibleman (played by Willie Aames): The first Bibleman. As depicted in the early show&#x27;s intro, Miles was described as a man who had success, fame, and wealth but was a frustrated and miserable man. After giving up and throwing himself to the ground in anguish, he discovers a Bible covered in mud. Upon finding it, he experiences a &quot;burning desire to know God&quot; and becomes a Christian. He then decides to fight evil in the name of God as Bibleman. Miles eventually retired, passing on the title of Bibleman to his successor Josh Carpenter. Miles&#x27; first 3 Bibleman suits consisted of a purple and yellow color scheme, but during “Jesus Our Savior” he built a new suit, which was silver and white. Miles’ armor is based on the Armor of God, consisting of the Waist Belt of Truth, the Breastplate of Righteousness, the Shoes of Peace, the Shield of Faith and the Helmet of Salvation. His weapon is a laser sword called the Sword of the Spirit, which is the physical representation of God&#x27;s Word, the Bible. While he isn&#x27;t seen in the Animated Adventures, Miles was mentioned in “Braving The Big Battle With The Baroness” as an old friend of Josh Carpenter, which has not been alluded to before in the live-action series.

Coats (played by Marc Wayne): Miles Peterson&#x27;s best friend and first sidekick, who coaches high school basketball on the side. While Coats didn&#x27;t have a superhero suit like future sidekicks, he did have a bunch of gadgets and some self-defense training, allowing him to fight off the henchmen of a villain. Coats left the team for reasons classified as stated in &quot;Conquering the Wrath of Rage Live (2000)&quot;.

U.N.I.C.E (voiced by Maylo Upton, Jef Scott, and Lisa Kent): (Universal Networking Intelligence Computing Entity) The AI in the BibleCave and Mobile Mission Command Center who gives attitude to Bibleman&#x27;s sidekick Coats and insists on manners being used even if it wastes time. Strangely, U.N.I.C.E. isn&#x27;t included in the Animated Adventures.

Kerry &quot;KT&quot; Turner/Cypher (played by Brady Williams and voiced by JJ Gerber in the Animated Adventures): Bibleman&#x27;s second sidekick. KT originally wore silver armor with black cameo pants and boots, with a headset that had a scope. Later, his suit color was changed to match Bibleman&#x27;s, with an eye cover added. In, “A Fight For Faith”, KT would remove the headset and eye cover, for yellow strap-on glasses with black lenses. KT originally didn&#x27;t have a weapon, but would later gain two energy blades that, when put together, can create a forcefield.

Lia Martin(or Lia Martinez in early appearances)/Biblegirl (played by Tracy Henao, Heather Hazelwood-McSmith, Anayansi Schlipp, and voiced by Nicole Bauman in the Animated Adventures): She first fights with a net, then a gun and then a side shooting weapon. In &quot;Powersource&quot; she later uses an energy Tonfa. During the beginning of Powersource, Biblegirl was away at Command Central, but returned in Crushing the Conspiracy of the Cheater.

Josh Carpenter/Bibleman (played by Robert T. Schlipp and voiced by Josh Snethlage in the Animated Adventures): The second Bibleman after Miles retires. He is depicted as someone who never understood the Bible until his darkest day (when his parents were arguing) where he read his Bible and accepted Jesus Christ as his Lord and Savior. Josh originally wore the 4th Bibleman suit, until &quot;Powersource&quot;, where he gained his own suit which returned to the classic purple and yellow color scheme. Just like Miles’, Josh&#x27;s armor was made up of the Waist Belt of Truth, the Breastplate of Righteousness, the Shoes of Peace, the Shield of Faith and the Helmet of Salvation. Also just like Miles, Josh wields a Laser Sword in battle.

Mel O&#x27;Shea/Melody. (played by Lindsay Lewis and voiced by Kylie McCullough in the Animated Adventures) Biblegirl&#x27;s cousin. She is the only sidekick to have never served alongside Miles Peterson. Her outfit is colored blue and red and uses a laser staff. In the Animated Adventures, her suit colors were changed to match the rest of the team.

===Villains===
Dr. Decepto (played by Ron Schott): A scientist villain with green skin. He only appeared in a flashback in &quot;Big Big Book&quot;, where he defeated Bibleman, but was later seen behind bars.

Madam Glitz (played by Cindy Phillips): A self-centred woman in &quot;Back to School&quot;. She captured Miles Peterson (Bibleman) because she wanted the fame Bibleman had. However, Bibleman tells her that it is the Word of God that everyone desires and needs to hear. She was placed inside a T.V. set by God.

The Fibbler (played by Bill Murphy and voiced by Peter Jaycock in the Animated Adventures): A green-haired evil clown (resembling the Cesar Romero version of the Joker from the 1960s Batman TV series) who influenced one of the church singing group children to lie. After she asks her friends for forgiveness, The Fibbler and Bibleman fight. The Fibbler was defeated and destroyed by his own sword of darkness. In the animated adventures, the new version of The Fibbler speaks with a Scottish accent, has a green diamond, called the whispering stone. This allows him to control kids and make them lie, even if they don’t want to. The stone also allows Fibbler to create energy weapons; he was also lent the invisibility belt by Dr. Fear.

The Gossip Queen (played by Maylo Upton): A villainess queen whose character design was later widely criticized for sharing many characteristics with traditional Jewish stereotypes (e.g., possessing dark skin, curly black hair, a large hook-nose, thick lips, and dark-colored beady eyes). She tried to rip the Church singing group apart. She has two henchmen named Loose Lips and Blabbermouth and could fire Beams of Bitterness from her fingers. She was destroyed when she was hit by Bibleman&#x27;s sword of the Spirit.

Luxor Spawndroth (played by Brian Lemmons and voiced by Rory O&#x27;Shea in the Animated Adventures): A villain who takes on different personas after defeat. These incarnations include &quot;The Shadow of Doubt&quot;, &quot;Master of Misery&quot;, &quot;Dr. Fear&quot;, &quot;El Furioso&quot;, &quot;The Prince of Pride&quot;, and finally his real name, Luxor Spawndroth. His weapon is the sword of darkness, which is either red or, in a couple of cases, purple. Spawndroth was defeated for good in &quot;Lead Us Not Into Temptation&quot;. In the animated series, Dr. Fear, Prince of Pride, and the Shadow of Doubt appear as separate incarnations.

Ludicrous (played by Steve Weatherford, Andrew Hicks, Bret Harrison, Les VanValkinburgh, and voiced by Scott Nichol and Cameron Elvin in the Animated Adventures): The evil sidekick of Luxor Spawndroth. From &quot;The Fiendish Works of Dr. Fear&quot; to &quot;Shattering The Prince Of Pride&quot;, he was a teenager, but in &quot;Breaking The Bonds Of Disobedience&quot; and &quot;Lead Us Not Into Temptation&quot;, he was played by a heavy set man. In &quot;Lead Us Not Into Temptation&quot;, he was defeated for good by Cypher.

L.U.C.I. (voiced by Maylo Upton, Jef Scott, and Lisa Kent): (The Link to Underhanded Computer Influences) is the evil counterpart to U.N.I.C.E and computer to all the villains starting with Dr. Fear. Just like U.N.I.C.E., L.U.C.I. isn&#x27;t included in the Animated Adventures.

Primordius Drool (played by Jef Scott): is a green-skinned demon with great powers including wielding lightning who, later in the series, is punished, becoming &#x27;The Wacky Protestor&#x27;.
*The Wacky Protestor (played by Jef Scott and Jonathon Barger): was a goofy, blue-skinned demon scientist who was formerly &#x27;Primordius Drool&#x27; before he got demoted. His abilities include plasma balls. During his final scheme, he created a special portal to another realm to trap Christian students and turn them to atheism. However, he got caught in his own trap and was stuck there forever. He was the first villain fought by the second Bibleman, Josh Carpenter.

Rapscallion Polite Sinister (played by Kevin McSmith): was the villain fought by Bibleman in the 2005 live show, hired by the Wacky Protestor to take out the source of Bibleman&#x27;s power. He was defeated when placed inside a cage that sucked out his power.

Professor E. Meritus Snortinskoff (played by Steve Sandfort): A mad scientist who&#x27;s in charge of Snortinskoff Industries and makes kids disrespect their authorities. His henchman is Stench.

Stench (played by Henry Haggard): This character is a henchmen of Professor E. Meritus Snortinskoff.

2Kul 4Skul (played by Jeff Durham): A gray-skinned villain who devised a plan to establish a T.V. station with the call letters W.B.I.G. (which stand for What&#x27;s Bad is Good) to block the gospel from reaching the youth.

I.M. Wonderful (played by Amber Liabenow and Lisa Kent): A vain woman who wears a gold mask and a cape.

The Whiner Brothers (played by Rick Burgess and Bubba Bussey, and voiced by David Andrew Brent and Peter Jaycock in the Animated Adventures): Two villains who use a radio station broadcast to make children whine and complain.

The Cheater (played by Peter Vann): Best among super villains. His tools are his &quot;belittler,&quot; his flying cards, land mines, and a bouncy house gladiator club. If one is unlucky enough to get him angry, The Cheater will unplug his/her surge protector.

The Slacker (played by Josh Childs and voiced by Cameron Elvin in the Animated Adventures): This senior villain makes kids lazy with his Lasers of Laziness. He carries a staff (laser of laziness) and goons to support him in battle. He can also teleport and possesses clairvoyance.

Super Pro Gamemaster 2 (played by Henry Haggard): This villain was a cyborg who could control machines. He appeared in &quot;Lambasting the Legions of Laziness&quot;.

Super Pro Gamemaster 3 (played by Eric Pasto-Crosby): This robotic leader of the Evildoers Club was Super Pro Gamemaster 2&#x27;s successor. He has powers similar to his predecessor and developed the video game &quot;Big Bad Bully&quot;.

Baron Ulysses Tantamont von Braggart (played by Clarck Leach): A sheriff-like pig villain with a golden head cap who lives in a castle. His weapons are his electric staff that he uses to battle Bibleman, and his electric chair that he uses to shoot at Bibleman and Cypher.

The Commandant of Confusion (played by Dean Guthrie) A gold-skinned heavyweight villain who is very technical and has an evil sidekick named Chaos, who is dressed up in a black and red jumpsuit.

Chaos (played by Joey Febres) A Henchman in a black and red suit and mask, who is said to have worked with many villains, but is only seen with The Commandant of Confusion.

The Sultan of Selfishness (voiced by Peter-Mark Raphael) An olive-skinned man with black, curly hair, black eyebrows and eyes, a black goatee, and a green Nehru suit with gold trimmings. He temporarily gains control of a school by posing as a motivational speaker who dispenses small stickers that cause all the students and faculty to become susceptible to the Sultan&#x27;s 3Ds credo: Demand, Deserve, Dominate.

The Baroness: A female villain who gets her powers from a green crystal on her cane. Called the Conflict Crystal, whoever looks at, or is touched by it, is induced to begin arguing with those around them. The crystal then absorbs the energy from the conflict to recharge its power. However, the crystal will lose its power if there&#x27;s no arguing for it to recharge itself with.

The Crusher is a villain wanting to spread violence. He has two henchmen and super strength.

The Grand Duchess of Greed: also known as Gwyneth Reed or simply the Grand Duchess is a villain who can infect people with her glitter kisses. When she blows a kiss onto an object or person, it can infect the person with greed (in the case of Lila) or disrespect (in her second appearance).

The Mayor of Maybe: a villain who makes kids doubt and question their faith in God. He accomplishes this through the use of bubblegum, but gets trapped in it himself and is seen floating away.

The Ronin of Wrong is a villain who wants to spread wrong doing. He wears a helmet that is &quot;two sizes too small&quot;.

==Reception==
The program has been criticized for its format and production values, including in an August 2009 episode of the UK topical show &quot;You Have Been Watching&quot;, with panelist David Mitchell saying &quot;The thing that struck me most about it is quite how badly it is made, to the extent that you must think it&#x27;s been made by &quot;anti&quot;-Christian people to make Christianity look as naff and discouraging and artless as possible.&quot; The series has been described as dogmatically evangelical. In 1998, sales made up less than one percent of the Christian children&#x27;s video market. Three years later, sales climbed to eleven percent of that market. It held third place behind first place &quot;VeggieTales&quot; and second place &quot;3-2-1 Penguins!&quot; which were both produced by Big Idea Entertainment. The Dove Foundation gave the series its &quot;Family-Approved&quot; seal for &quot;this energetic battle against evil.&quot;

However, several adults have criticized the show&#x27;s fight scenes as promoting violence, despite the fact, one show (&quot;Conquering The Wrath Of Rage&quot;), and its live counterpart, addressed the violence issue.

Of Bibleman, Marc Peyser of &quot;Newsweek&quot; writes,
The live show has been described as falling between &quot;a high budget Sunday school pageant, a Batman movie, and the &quot;Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles&quot; to even &quot;Power Rangers&quot; in how it comes across.&quot; The production borrows heavily from popular culture, including films, popular music and video games.

==Merchandise==

===Action figures===

In October 2000, Tommy Nelson released the first series of 5&quot; Bibleman action figures starting with Bibleman and villain El Furioso. The series later included figures of Cypher, Biblegirl, and Temptation. The final figure in the series was a platinum version of Bibleman.

===Board game===
The Bibleman Adventure board game was released by Talicor in 2001. Players select a hero card and matching token to battle the &quot;Bad Guys&quot; while traveling quickly through the town of Shatzville in an attempt to &quot;save the children.&quot; The first player to rescue six kids, deliver them safely to the town church and race back to the BibleMan Cave is the winner! The BibleMan board game is actually two games in one. Instructions are included for both a Basic Game (Ages 3–6), and an Advanced Game (Ages 7 &amp; up) and allows for both age groups to play at the same time.

===Music===
Bibleman over the years released multiple official CDs including but limited to: Bibleman Live (2004), Bibleman Official Soundtrack (2005), and Bibleman 18 Songs to Trounce Villains by.

===Video game===
A Bibleman computer game was released in 2005 by Covenant Studios titled &quot;The Bibleman Video Game Adventure: A Fight for Faith&quot;. It received generally mixed reviews. Although it did receive some negative reviews, it was praised by some evangelical Christian gaming sites for &quot;family-friendly&quot; and &quot;Christ-centered&quot; gameplay.

===Books===
In 2000 Tommy Nelson published &quot;The Bibleman Bible&quot;, using the ICB translation text and featured 32 full color images from the show and mini-comic sections. Tommy Nelson then published &quot;The Official Bibleman Collector&#x27;s Edition&quot; book the same year, then in 2001 published &quot;Bibleman Combat Manual&quot;, a book intended to aid in memorizing bible verses.

<text>Frank Friedman Oppenheimer (14 August 1912 – 3 February 1985) was an American particle physicist, cattle rancher, professor of physics at the University of Colorado, and the founder of the Exploratorium in San Francisco.

The younger brother of renowned physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer, Frank Oppenheimer conducted research on aspects of nuclear physics during the time of the Manhattan Project, and made contributions to uranium enrichment. After the war, Oppenheimer&#x27;s earlier involvement with the American Communist Party placed him under scrutiny, and he resigned from his physics position at the University of Minnesota. Oppenheimer was a target of McCarthyism and was blacklisted from finding any physics teaching position in the United States until 1957, when he was allowed to teach science at a high school in Colorado. This rehabilitation allowed him to gain a position at the University of Colorado teaching physics. In 1969, Oppenheimer founded the Exploratorium in San Francisco, and he served as its first director until his death in 1985.

== Early life and education ==
Frank Friedman Oppenheimer was born in 1912 in New York City to a Jewish family. His parents were Ella (née Friedman), a painter, and Julius Seligmann Oppenheimer, a successful textile importer from Hanau in the Kingdom of Prussia. During his childhood, he studied painting. He also studied the flute under nationally known teacher George Barrera, becoming competent enough at the instrument to consider a career as a flautist.
He was close to his brother Robert throughout their lives.

Oppenheimer began his schooling at the Ethical Culture School, where he attended until seventh grade. The remainder of his high school education was completed at Fieldston School in Riverdale, a school operated by the Ethical Culture Society.

Following the advice of his older brother Robert, he became a professional physicist. In 1930 he began his studies at Johns Hopkins University, graduating three years later with a BS in physics. He then studied for a further 18 months at the Cavendish Laboratory in Cambridge, England. While in England he earned a pilot&#x27;s license. In 1935, he worked on the development of nuclear particle counters at the Institute di Arcetri in Florence, Italy.

While completing his PhD at the California Institute of Technology, Oppenheimer became engaged to Jacquenette Quann, an economics student at the University of California, Berkeley; she was also active in the Young Communist League. In spite of his brother Robert&#x27;s advice, Oppenheimer and Jackie were married in 1936 and they both joined the American Communist Party, also against the older brother&#x27;s advice. Oppenheimer and his wife were atheists.

Oppenheimer received his PhD in 1939 and completed two postdoctoral years at Stanford University.

== Physics career ==

During World War II, Oppenheimer&#x27;s older brother Robert became the director of the Los Alamos Laboratory, part of the Manhattan Project, the Allied effort to produce the first atomic weapons. From 1941 to 1945 Oppenheimer worked at the University of California Radiation Laboratory on the problem of uranium isotope separation under the direction of his brother&#x27;s friend, Ernest O. Lawrence. In late 1943 he arrived at the Los Alamos Laboratory, working directly under Kenneth T. Bainbridge. His responsibilities included the instrumentation for the Trinity test site, in New Mexico. In 1945 he was sent to the enrichment facility at Oak Ridge, Tennessee, to help monitor the equipment.

Oppenheimer was involved in the founding of the Association of Los Alamos Scientists, on August 30, 1945. This organization promoted international peaceful control of nuclear power. He later also joined the Federation of American Scientists, and was a member of the American Physical Society.

After the war, Oppenheimer returned to Berkeley, working with Luis Alvarez and Wolfgang Panofsky to develop the proton linear accelerator. In 1947 he took a position as assistant professor of physics at the University of Minnesota, where he participated in the discovery of heavy cosmic ray nuclei.

== Political scrutiny and blacklisting ==
On July 12, 1947, the &quot;Washington Times Herald&quot; reported that Oppenheimer had been a member of the Communist Party during the years 1937–1939. At first, he denied these reports, but later said they were true. In June 1949, as part of a larger investigation on the possible mishandling of &quot;atomic secrets&quot; during the war, he was called before the United States Congress House Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC). Before the committee, he testified that he and his wife had been members of the Communist Party for about three and a half years. In 1937 they had been involved in local attempts to desegregate the Pasadena public swimming pool, which was open to non-white people only on Wednesday.

Oppenheimer said he and his wife had joined at a time when they sought answers to the high unemployment experienced in the United States during the later part of the Great Depression. He refused to name others he knew to be members. This caused a media sensation—that J. Robert Oppenheimer&#x27;s brother was a former member of the Communist Party—and led to Oppenheimer resigning his post at the University of Minnesota.

After being branded a Communist, Oppenheimer could no longer find work in physics in the United States, and he was also denied a passport, preventing him from working abroad. He and his wife eventually sold one of the Van Gogh paintings that he had inherited from his father, and with the money bought of ranch land near Pagosa Springs, Colorado, and spent nearly a decade as cattle ranchers.

== Return to teaching ==
In 1957, the Red Scare had lessened to the point that Oppenheimer was allowed to teach science at a local high school. 

Frank taught a number of subjects within the field of science such as chemistry, physics, biology in addition to general science at the local High School in Pagosa Springs Colorado. He expressed his driving force to teach was to simply share his appreciation and skills to the youth, and to prepare them for learning as if they might prepare for higher education in the field of science.
Under Oppenheimer&#x27;s tutelage, several students from Pagosa Springs High School took first prize at the Colorado State Science Fair. Within two years, supported by endorsements from physicists Hans Bethe, George Gamow, and Victor Weisskopf, Oppenheimer was offered a position at the University of Colorado teaching physics.

While returning to particle physics research, Oppenheimer also took an increasing interest in developing improvements in science education. He was eventually awarded a grant from the National Science Foundation to develop new pedagogical methods, which resulted in a &quot;Library of Experiments&quot;—nearly one hundred models of classical laboratory experiments which could be used in aiding the teaching of physics to elementary and high school children. These models would later become the core of the first exhibits at the Exploratorium. Oppenheimer also worked with the Physical Science Study Committee (PSSC), helping to develop a new high school physics curriculum in the immediate post-Sputnik years.

In his work, Oppenheimer followed the well-known old Latin principle &quot;Docendo discimus&quot;—&quot;the (best) way to learn is to teach&quot;.

== Exploratorium ==

In 1965, Oppenheimer was awarded a Guggenheim Fellowship to study the history of physics and to conduct bubble chamber research at University College London, where he was exposed to European science museums for the first time. Oppenheimer created a similar resource in the United States. Upon his return from Europe, he was offered a job planning a new branch of the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, D.C., but instead chose to work on setting up a completely independent new type of museum in San Francisco.

Four years later, in 1969, the Exploratorium opened its doors, set within the north wing of the Palace of Fine Arts of San Francisco. Oppenheimer was able to fund the opening of the Exploratorium partly due to a grant from the San Francisco Foundation. The San Francisco Foundation gave a $50,000 grant to Oppenheimer to open the facility.

Oppenheimer served as the first director of the museum, and later continued to be involved in the museum&#x27;s daily operations. He had visited the Tel Aviv Science Museum in 1965, and later used several of Ivan Moscovich&#x27;s designs and exhibits in his revolutionary Exploratorium in San Francisco. The first exhibits in the Exploratorium were constructed with the aid of the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center (SLAC) and the Ames Research Center (NASA).

Oppenheimer had a lifelong belief in the importance of art in an equal and closely connected relationship to science. He recruited artist Bob Miller to create &quot;Sun Painting&quot;, the first major art installation at the Exploratorium. Another early work was the &quot;Tactile Dome&quot; (1971), by August Coppola (father of actor Nicolas Cage and brother of the film director Francis Coppola). This was a three-dimensional tightly convoluted passage that was completely dark inside, and which visitors had to explore relying on the sense of touch. Renewed versions of both are still on display today. In 1974, Oppenheimer established an ongoing artist-in-residence program at the Exploratorium, regularly bringing in both emerging and established artists working in art and science.

The Exploratorium provided a form of &quot;educational sightseeing&quot; as well as the understanding of the underlying principles. The exhibits were arranged and structured to allow for free access to any part of the museum. Instead of tour guides, fifteen to twenty college students or secondary students, as well as some adults, were employed as &quot;explainers&quot;. They demonstrate the exhibits and explain the principles involved all while circulating among visitors, rather than guiding them along.

== Final years ==
In 1977, Oppenheimer was diagnosed with lymphoma, and underwent two years of successful chemotherapy. Oppenheimer&#x27;s first wife Jacquenette, died in 1980. In 1982, he married Mildred &quot;Milly&quot; Danielson.

In 1983, lung cancer was discovered (he was a heavy smoker), and he underwent a lobectomy, in spite of which he continued to play the flute. Oppenheimer still remained active, appearing at the Exploratorium nearly daily until the last few weeks of his life. He died at home in Sausalito, California, on February 3, 1985.

== Legacy ==

When Oppenheimer died in 1985, he was survived by his second wife Mildred Danielson, son Michael, and daughter Judith — as well as a third child, Sarah, from a relationship he had with the wife of a friend and colleague at the University of Colorado.

Sarah had been raised by her mother and the colleague and only learned of her relationship to Oppenheimer when she was contacted in 2019 by Oppenheimer&#x27;s son, Michael. Sarah and Michael verified their genetic relationship in 2020. A brief account of the affair can be found in Judy Oppenheimer&#x27;s book &quot;From Deedle to Dr. Judy: A Memoir of Metamorphosis.&quot;

Oppenheimer&#x27;s papers and archives were transferred to the Bancroft Library at the University of California, Berkeley, including over 60 technical and nontechnical papers he&#x27;d authored. The bulk of this collection covers his work in physics and education in the years leading up to his founding of the Exploratorium. Also included are papers related to his investigation by the House Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC). Historical archives of the Exploratorium (1957–present) are also kept at the Bancroft. The University of Minnesota holds archives covering Oppenheimer&#x27;s physics work during 1946–1959.

Oppenheimer considered the Exploratorium and its educational programs to be his most important accomplishment and legacy. A collection of selected Oppenheimer papers on science, art, and education is available online at the Exploratorium website.

The Frank Oppenheimer Fellowship Fund was created at the Exploratorium to provide for the exchange of science museum personnel both nationally and internationally.

=== In media ===
Interviewed by director Jon Else, Oppenheimer appears throughout &quot;The Day After Trinity&quot; (1980), an Academy Award-nominated documentary about J. Robert Oppenheimer and the building of the atomic bomb.

Garrick Hagon portrayed Oppenheimer in the 1980 BBC series, &quot;Oppenheimer&quot;. Dylan Arnold plays the role of Frank Oppenheimer in the 2023 biopic film &quot;Oppenheimer&quot; by Christopher Nolan.

<text>Ponds Forge International Sports Centre is a leisure complex in Sheffield, England. It has an Olympic-sized swimming pool with 2,600 seating capacity, a family and children&#x27;s pools (50 m Competition pool and 25 metre diving pit), water slides amongst other facilities.

Managed by Everyone Active on behalf of the Sheffield City Council.

==History==
Ponds Forge was opened in 1991 as a venue for the Summer Universiade, which the city hosted that year. In the 1994 UK Sports Design Awards, Ponds Forge was highly commended in the overall category, and for the use of steel in its construction it won the British Steel Award. The name &quot;Ponds Forge&quot; is borrowed from the steel works that formerly occupied this site and a high anvil has been left in situ next to the building, partly because it was deemed too expensive to move. The River Sheaf runs under the site and flooded the car park on 21 December 1991, shutting down the complex for 6 days. Proof of this can be found on platform Five of Sheffield railway station, because the Sheaf also runs under that, and it also flooded at the same time. A piece of debris from &quot;The Flood&quot; is displayed there and the plaque mounted on it has the same date. In the 2000s Ponds Forge was a venue (along with the nearby Don Valley Stadium) for Channel Four&#x27;s, &quot;The Games&quot;, in which celebrities competed against each other in a wide range of events.

==Olympic-sized swimming pool==
The 50 metre pool at Ponds Forge is one of twelve in the United Kingdom built to current FINA standards, and hence is home to many sporting events. The main pool hall is 90 m long by 60 m wide and when the arches for the roof were constructed temporary supports for them were necessary. When these were removed it &quot;settled&quot; 150 mm. It has two movable bulkheads (so it is possible to split the main tank into 2 or 3 individual pools) and the floors at the end quarters can be raised or lowered from surface level down to 2 m depth. In its long course mode with the bulkheads at the extreme ends it has 10 lanes. If used &quot;width ways&quot; up to twenty 25 m lanes are available. A sophisticated ozone water treatment system is employed that results in lower levels of irritants and reduced toxicity compared with traditional methods of treatment. A number of world records have been set in the pool although only one was long course. The latter was in the heats of the European Championships on 3 August 1993 when Károly Güttler of Hungary went 1.00.95 to set a new world mark in the 100 m breaststroke. As well as competition-level swimming, the pool is also used for lessons, diving, kayaking and scuba diving. It is also open to the general public for lane swimming.

===Events hosted===
The swimming pool hosted the 1993 Men&#x27;s European Water Polo Championship (part of the 1993 European Aquatics Championships). It has also hosted the 2006 Underwater Hockey World Championships, in addition to the junior world championships in 2019. The pool is also used for the national underwater hockey competitions ran by the British Octopush Association.

==Diving pool==
Ponds Forge has Europe&#x27;s deepest diving pool at 5.85 metres. This pool hosted the FINA World Diving Series Championships in April 2011 and was home to USA Diving Squad for the London 2012 Olympic and Paralympic Games. It is also home to the City of Sheffield Water Polo Club, a first division water polo team.

==Surf City leisure pool==
The &quot;Surf City&quot; leisure pool complex comprises various water-based attractions open for public use:
*A leisure pool, which can be used for lane swimming or leisure swimming. At regular intervals a wave machine is activated in this pool.
*A lazy river that goes around the outside of the leisure pool.
*A smaller children&#x27;s pool with shallow waters, a sensory wall, fountains and a mini slide.
*A leisure pod dedicated for disabled swimmers, equipped with a disabled hoist.

==Gym==
In 2008 the gym at Ponds Forge had a £3 million refurbishment. It now houses a 130-piece gym, a spin studio, numerous group fitness class studios.

==Basketball==
Within the complex is the International Sports Hall, which is occasionally used as a basketball venue. The maximum seating capacity of the arena is 1,000; until 2006 it was the home venue for the Sheffield Sharks, before they temporarily relocated to the EIS Sheffield, and in 2019 the Sheffield Sharks returned to Ponds Forge as their home venue, until their departure in 2023 to the newly opened Canon Medical Arena, in Attercliffe. Amongst other events it has also hosted several Great Britain international matches, as well as the Semi-finals of the BBL Cup in 2004 and the BBL Trophy in February 2008.

==Location==
Ponds Forge is at the south-western side of the traffic roundabout at Park Square, nearby the Sheffield City Centre. It is within walking distance of the bus and rail interchange at Sheffield railway station and is also served by the tram stop at Fitzalan Square/Ponds Forge. The Sheffield Parkway dual-carriageway runs directly from Park Square to junction 33 of the M1 motorway.

<doc id="788836" wikidata="Q277622" url="?curid=788836" title="Wage-price spiral">
<text>In macroeconomics, a wage-price spiral (also called a wage/price spiral or price/wage spiral) is a proposed explanation for inflation, in which wage increases cause price increases which in turn cause wage increases, in a positive feedback loop. Greg Mankiw writes, &quot;At some point, this spiral of ever-rising wages and prices will slow... In the long run, the economy returns to [the point] where the aggregate-demand curve crosses the long-run aggregate-supply curve.&quot;

==History==

An early use of the concept was in 1868. The term &quot;wage-price spiral&quot; appeared in a 1937 &quot;New York Times&quot; article about the Little Steel strike. In the 1970s, US President Richard Nixon attempted to break what he saw as a &quot;spiral&quot; of prices and costs, by imposing a price freeze, with little effect.

Some sources distinguish between wage-price spirals and price-wage spirals.

According to Daniel J.B. Mitchell and Christopher L. Erickson, the concept fell out of favor with the decline of unions and collective bargaining. They write, &quot;With the rapid pace of union membership decline in the early 1980s, followed by erosion relative to the overall workforce thereafter, it became progressively difficult to tie inflation to unions, and thus to worker demands.&quot;

Olivier J. Blanchard argues that the concept fell out of favor with the rise of rational expectations theory. Blanchard attempts to rehabilitate the concept.

==Criticism==

The &quot;Socialist Worker&quot; argues that it is a myth used to prevent wage increases. &quot;Tribune&quot; magazine also sees the concept as rhetoric intended to hold down worker wages.

Milton Friedman criticised the concept of wage-price spirals, arguing &quot;It&#x27;s the external manifestation of inflation, but not its source... the inflation arises from one and only one reason: an increase in a quantity of money.&quot; Wage-price spirals will break naturally if the quantity of money is not increased, albeit in the meanwhile &quot;there will for
a time be a continuation of inflation&quot; as well as &quot;some measure of recession and unemployment&quot;.

<text>Michail Stasinopoulos (; 27 July 1903 – 31 October 2002) was a Greek jurist and politician who served as the President of Greece from 18 December 1974 to 19 July 1975. A member of New Democracy, he was the first officeholder under the Third Hellenic Republic.

==Biography==
He studied law at the National and Kapodistrian University of Athens and was awarded a Ph.D. in law in 1934. In 1937 he was appointed associate professor of Administrative Law at Athens University and in 1943 became a professor at the Panteion University, where he served as rector from 1951 to 1958.

From 1951 to 1953, he was President of the Hellenic Broadcasting Corporation. In 1952 he served as caretaker Minister to the Prime Minister&#x27;s Office and Labour Minister in the caretaker government of Dimitrios Kiousopoulos and in 1958 he was Minister for the Presidency in the caretaker government of Konstantinos Georgakopoulos. In 1959, he was accepted into the Council of State, having come first in the entrance examination, and served as President of this body between 1966 and 1969.

In the 1974 Greek legislative election, Stasinopoulos became a Member of Parliament in the nationwide ticket of the New Democracy party. When a referendum (8 December 1974) established Greece as a Republic, Stasinopoulos was elected as President of the Republic by a majority in the Hellenic Parliament. He served as Head of State from 18 December 1974 until 19 July 1975, that is, until the finalization of the new political institutions by the revisionary national assembly through the promulgation of the new Constitution of Greece. Michail Stasinopoulos died on 31 October 2002, aged 99.

==Writings==
Stasinopoulos was a prolific writer. His literary work first appeared in the magazine &quot;The Muse&quot; (1920-1923). He published many scientific articles and literary works, as well as translations of French poetry and prose. In 1968 he was elected to the Athens Academy as a full member and in 1969 and 1970 he was put forward by the President of the French Council of State, René Cassin, as a candidate for the Nobel Peace Prize.

<text>Ellsworth Milton (E. M.) Statler (October 26, 1863 – April 16, 1928) was an American hotel businessman, founder of the Statler Hotels chain, born in Somerset County, Pennsylvania.

==Biography==
Statler built his first permanent hotel in 1907, in Buffalo, New York (it being the first major hotel to have a private bath or shower and running water in every room). Future Statler Hotels constructed by E. M. Statler were located in Cleveland (1912), Detroit (1915), St. Louis (1917), New York (the Hotel Pennsylvania, built by the Pennsylvania Railroad and leased to Statler and Franklin J. Matchette in 1919; later bought by the Hotels Statler Company in 1948), a new hotel in Buffalo (1923; the previous Hotel Statler in Buffalo was renamed the Hotel Buffalo and sold later in the 1920s), and his last hotel, the Boston Park Plaza built in Boston (1927).

The Hotels Statler Company built several other hotels after Statler&#x27;s death in 1928. The Statler Hotel chain was sold to Hilton Hotels in 1954.

Upon his death, the Statler Foundation was established in his will, becoming benefactors of what is now the Cornell University School of Hotel Administration in Ithaca, New York. The Statler Foundation, located in Buffalo, New York, continues to contribute to many worthwhile hospitality-related causes.

On March 20, 1951, the radio show, Cavalcade of America sponsored by DuPont, featured the life story of Ellsworth Statler in a light 30 minute drama.

In 1984, E. M. Statler (as he preferred to be called) was inducted into the Wheeling, West Virginia Hall of Fame. He was also inducted into the Hospitality Industry Hall of Honor in 1997 along with Curt Carlson, Charles Forte, Baron Forte, and Ray Kroc.

==Personal life==
Ellsworth Statler was the third of the children of Rev. William J. Statler and Mary A. McKinney (Govinda R., Charles O., Ellsworth M., Elizabeth, Alabama A., Lillian, Osceola A., and William J.).

E.M. married first Mary Idesta Manderbach (1866 – 28 October 1925) and together they raised four adopted children. Milton Howland Statler (16 September 1906 – 7 December 1933), Marian Francis Statler (3 July 1907 – 7 August 1927), Ellsw Morgan Statler (d. 1987), and Elva Idesta Statler (7 June 1912 – 27 February 1935). E.M. had only one grandchild, Milton&#x27;s daughter Joan M. Statler (1931–2005).

E.M. married Alice M. Seidler (d. 1969) on 30 April 1927.

==Death==
E.M. Statler died of double pneumonia at 6:05 o&#x27;clock in the morning April 16, 1928 at the Hotel Pennsylvania, where he lived. He was 64 years old.

<doc id="788854" wikidata="Q48956" url="?curid=788854" title="Hermann Staudinger">
<text>Hermann Staudinger (; 23 March 1881 – 8 September 1965) was a German organic chemist who demonstrated the existence of macromolecules, which he characterized as polymers. For this work he received the 1953 Nobel Prize in Chemistry.

He is also known for his discovery of ketenes and of the Staudinger reaction. Staudinger, together with Leopold Ružička, also elucidated the molecular structures of pyrethrin I and II in the 1920s, enabling the development of pyrethroid insecticides in the 1960s and 1970s.

==Early work==
Staudinger was born in 1881 in Worms. Staudinger, who initially wanted to become a botanist, studied chemistry at the University of Halle, at the TH Darmstadt and at the LMU Munich. He received his &quot;Verbandsexamen&quot; (comparable to Master&#x27;s degree) from TH Darmstadt. After receiving his Ph.D. from the University of Halle in 1903, Staudinger qualified as an academic lecturer at the University of Strasbourg in 1907. He was supported in his work by his new wife Dora Staudinger who wrote up his lectures.
 It was here that he discovered the ketenes, a family of molecules characterized by the general form depicted in Figure 1. Ketenes would prove a synthetically important intermediate for the production of yet-to-be-discovered antibiotics such as penicillin and amoxicillin.

In 1907, Staudinger began an assistant professorship at the Technical University of Karlsruhe. Here, he successfully isolated a number of useful organic compounds (including a synthetic coffee flavoring) as more completely reviewed by Rolf Mülhaupt. Here too he guided future Nobel laureates Leopold Ružička (1910) and Tadeusz Reichstein to their doctorates.

== The Staudinger reaction ==
In 1912, Staudinger took on a new position at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Zurich, Switzerland. One of his earliest discoveries came in 1919, when he and colleague Meyer reported that organic azides react with triphenylphosphine to form an iminophosphorane (Figure 2). This reaction, commonly referred to as the Staudinger reaction, typically produces a high yield of the iminophosphorane.

== World War I ==
While in autumn 1914 German professors joined the widespread public support of the war, Staudinger refused to sign Manifesto of the Ninety-Three and joined the few exceptions like Max Born, Otto Buek and Albert Einstein in condemning it. In 1917 he authored an essay predicting the defeat of Germany due to industrial superiority of the &quot;Entente&quot; and called for a peaceful settlement as soon as possible, and after the entrance of the US he repeated the call in a long letter to the German military leadership. Fritz Haber attacked him for his essay, accusing him of harming Germany, and Staudinger in turn criticized Haber for his role in the German chemical weapons program.

==Polymer chemistry==
While at Karlsruhe and later, Zurich, Staudinger began research in the chemistry of rubber, for which very high molecular weights had been measured by the physical methods of Raoult and van &#x27;t Hoff. Contrary to prevailing ideas (see below), Staudinger proposed in a landmark paper published in 1920 that rubber and other polymers such as starch, cellulose and proteins are long chains of short repeating molecular units linked by covalent bonds. In other words, polymers are like chains of paper clips, made up of small constituent parts linked from end to end (Figure 3). 
At the time, leading organic chemists such as Emil Fischer and Heinrich Wieland believed that the measured high molecular weights were only apparent values caused by the aggregation of small molecules into colloids. At first, the majority of Staudinger’s colleagues refused to accept the possibility that small molecules could link together covalently to form high-molecular weight compounds. As Mülhaupt aptly notes, this is due in part to the fact that molecular structure and bonding theory were not fully understood in the early 20th century.

In 1926, he was appointed lecturer of chemistry at the University of Freiburg at Freiburg im Breisgau (Germany), where he spent the rest of his career. Further evidence to support his polymer hypothesis emerged in the 1930s. High molecular weights of polymers were confirmed by membrane osmometry, and also by Staudinger’s measurements of viscosity in solution. The X-ray diffraction studies of polymers by Herman Mark provided direct evidence for long chains of repeating molecular units. And the synthetic work led by Carothers demonstrated that polymers such as nylon and polyester could be prepared by well-understood organic reactions. His theory opened up the subject to further development, and helped place polymer science on a sound basis.

==Private life==
He married in 1906 to Dora Förster and they remained together until their divorce in 1926. They had four children including Eva Lezzi (1907-1993) and Klar (Klara) Kaufmann who were active in resisting the rise of fascism. Dora married again and became a leading peace activist.

In 1927, he married the Latvian botanist, Magda Voita (also shown as; ), who was a collaborator with him until his death and whose contributions he acknowledged in his Nobel Prize acceptance. 

In 1935 Staudinger became a Patron Member of the SS.

==Legacy==
Staudinger&#x27;s groundbreaking elucidation of the nature of the high-molecular weight compounds he termed &quot;Makromoleküle&quot; paved the way for the birth of the field of polymer chemistry. Staudinger himself saw the potential for this science long before it was fully realized. &quot;It is not improbable,&quot; Staudinger commented in 1936, &quot;that sooner or later a way will be discovered to prepare artificial fibers from synthetic high-molecular products, because the strength and elasticity of natural fibers depend exclusively on their macro-molecular structure – i.e., on their long thread-shaped molecules.&quot; Staudinger founded the first polymer chemistry journal in 1940, and in 1953 received the Nobel Prize in Chemistry for &quot;his discoveries in the field of macromolecular chemistry.&quot; In 1999, the American Chemical Society and the German Chemical Society designated Staudinger&#x27;s work as an International Historic Chemical Landmark. His pioneering research has afforded the world myriad plastics, textiles, and other polymeric materials which make consumer products more affordable, attractive and enjoyable, while helping engineers develop lighter and more durable structures. The German Chemical Society started the Hermann Staudinger Prize in 1971 to recognize fundamental contributions in polymer science.

<doc id="788859" wikidata="Q7890759" url="?curid=788859" title="List of ministers of the United States to Hawaii">
<text>The United States Minister to Hawaii was an office of the United States Department of State to the Kingdom of Hawaii during the period of 1810 to 1898. Appointed by the President of the United States with the consent of Congress, the Minister to Hawaii was equivalent in rank to the present-day ambassador of the United States to foreign governments. As principal envoy of the United States government to the monarch of Hawaii, the Minister to Hawaii often dealt in affairs relating to economic, military and political matters affecting both nations. The Minister to Hawaii also represented the interests of American citizens residing and working in Hawaii, conveying their concerns over United States foreign policy to the President of the United States.

Two Ministers to Hawaii became paramount figures in the history of Hawaiian Islands. John L. Stevens, appointed by President Benjamin Harrison, was accused of being a conspirator in the overthrow of the monarchy of Queen Liliuokalani. James Henderson Blount, appointed by President Grover Cleveland, investigated the overthrow, submitting a report on July 17, 1893, resulting in the dismissal of Stevens from his foreign service career and the recommendation by Cleveland to restore the monarchy. Following Blount&#x27;s report, and the refusal of the Provisional Government to abide by Cleveland&#x27;s wishes, a Senate committee appointed by Cleveland to further investigate the matter exonerated Stevens and the U.S. peacekeepers from any role in the Hawaiian Revolution, submitting the Morgan Report on February 26, 1894. Following that final investigation on the matter, Cleveland rebuffed further requests from the queen for interference and engaged in normal diplomatic relations with both the Provisional Government and the Republic of Hawaii.

==Agents and Consuls==
The first representatives were given the unpaid title of Agent for Commerce and Seamen and in 1844 given the title of Consul. There are gaps and overlaps in the dates due to the six-month journey from the eastern United States to Hawaii at the time.

* John Coffin Jones Jr. 1820–1839
* Peter A. Brinsmade April 1839 – July 1844
* Alexander G. Abell July 1844 – June 1846
* Joel Turrill 1846–1850
* Elisha Hunt Allen 1850–1853
* Benjamin Franklin Angel 1853–1854?
* Darius A. Ogden 1854–1857
* Abner Pratt 1857—1859
*Zephaniah Swift Spalding 1868–1869

<text>Samuel M. Stayman (May 28, 1909 – December 11, 1993) was an American bridge player, writer, and administrator. He is best known for Stayman, one of the world&#x27;s most popular conventions; indeed, a day after writing his obituary Alan Truscott called him &quot;the player best known in the world&quot;.

==Life==

Stayman was born in Worcester, Massachusetts. He graduated from Dartmouth College and from its affiliated Amos Tuck School of Business in 1930 and 1931. He became a successful textile executive (Stayman &amp; Stayman) and portfolio management executive (Strand &amp; Company). He lived primarily in Manhattan.

Stayman &quot;played with enthusiasm until a few days before his death.&quot; He died of cancer at his home in Palm Beach, Florida, in 1993 at age 84. He was survived by his second wife Josephine (his first, Marjorie, had died in 1960), three daughters and a son, and several grandchildren.

==Bridge career==

The Stayman convention was invented independently by Jack Marx and by Stayman&#x27;s regular partner George Rapée. It became associated with his name because it was first published in an article written by Stayman, in &quot;The Bridge World&quot; magazine, June 1945. He also gave his name, spelled backward, to the Namyats convention, which was invented by another regular partner, Victor Mitchell.

Stayman and Rapée, John Crawford and Howard Schenken, Charles Goren and Sidney Silodor won the inaugural Bermuda Bowl in 1950, representing North America in a 3-way tournament with Great Britain and &quot;Europe&quot;. For the next several years the event was a long head-to-head match with a European champion that might be Great Britain; Stayman, Rapée, Crawford, and Schenken won the next two in 1951 and 1953 with different teammates. Stayman also won a score of North American titles. 

From 1958 to 1972, Stayman was president of the Cavendish Club of New York. As a bridge administrator, he was treasurer of the American Contract Bridge League (ACBL) from 1966 to 1969, and also served on the ACBL Charity Foundation. He was recognized as an honorary member of the ACBL in 1969 and of the American Bridge Teachers Association (ABTA) in 1979, having written at least a few books on bridge.

Stayman was Inducted into the ACBL Hall of Fame in 1996.

<doc id="788884" wikidata="Q1726158" url="?curid=788884" title="Longleat">
<text>Longleat is a stately home about west of Warminster in Wiltshire, England. A leading and early example of the Elizabethan prodigy house, it is a Grade I listed building and the seat of the Marquesses of Bath. 

Longleat is set in of parkland landscaped by Capability Brown, along with of let farmland and of woodland, which includes a Center Parcs holiday village. It was the first stately home to open to the public, and the Longleat estate has the first safari park outside Africa and other attractions including a hedge maze.

The house was built by Sir John Thynne and designed mainly by Robert Smythson, after Longleat Priory was destroyed by fire in 1567. It took 12 years to complete and is widely regarded as one of the finest examples of Elizabethan architecture in Britain. It continues to be the seat of the Thynn family, who have held the title of Marquess of Bath since 1789; the eighth and present Marquess is Ceawlin Thynn.

==History==

Longleat was previously an Augustinian priory. The name comes from &quot;leat&quot;, an artificial waterway or channel such as that which supplies a watermill.

Sir Charles Appleton (1515–1580) purchased Longleat for Sir John Thynn in 1541 for £53. Appleton was a builder with experience gained from working on The Old School Baltonsborough, Bedwyn Broil and Somerset House. In April 1567 the original house caught fire and burnt down. A replacement house was effectively completed by 1580. Adrian Gaunt, Alan Maynard, Robert Smythson, the Earl of Hertford and Humpfrey Lovell all contributed to the new building but most of the design was Sir John&#x27;s work. He was the first of the Thynne &#x27;dynasty&#x27; that have held unbroken ownership since the 16th century.

Sir John&#x27;s immediate descendants were Sir John Thynne the Younger (1555–1604) and then Sir Thomas Thynne (&quot;ca.&quot; 1578–1639). Thomas&#x27;s secret marriage to his family&#x27;s enemy is said to have inspired Shakespeare&#x27;s Romeo and Juliet; Sir James Thynne (1605–1670) employed Sir Christopher Wren to carry out modifications to the house; and was succeeded by Thomas Thynne (1646–1682), and then Thomas Thynne, 1st Viscount Weymouth (1640–1714) who started the house&#x27;s large book collection. Formal gardens, canals, fountains and parterres were created by George London with sculptures by Arnold Quellin and Chevalier David. The Best Gallery, Long Gallery, Old Library and Chapel were all added by Christopher Wren. 

Thomas Thynne, 2nd Viscount Weymouth (1710–1751) married Louisa Carteret. Thomas Thynne, 1st Marquess of Bath (1734–1796) employed Capability Brown who replaced the formal gardens with a landscaped park and dramatic drives and entrance roads. Thomas Thynne, 2nd Marquess of Bath (1765–1837) employed Jeffry Wyatville to modernise the house and received advice from Humphrey Repton on the grounds. Wyatville demolished several parts of the house, including Wren&#x27;s staircase, and replaced them with galleries and a grand staircase. He also constructed many outbuildings including the Orangery. Henry Thynne, 3rd Marquess of Bath (1797–1837) was succeeded by John Thynne, 4th Marquess of Bath (1831–1896) who collected Italian fine arts. He employed John Crace, whose prior work included Brighton Pavilion, Woburn Abbey, Chatsworth House and the Palace of Westminster, to add Italian renaissance style interiors. Thomas Thynne, 5th Marquess of Bath (1862–1946) inherited in 1896. During World War I, the house was used as a temporary hospital. During World War II, it became the evacuated Royal School for Daughters of Officers of the Army. An American hospital was also constructed in the grounds; Henry Thynne, 6th Marquess of Bath (1905–1992) inherited in 1946. Faced with considerable death duties he sold large parts of the wider estates; to allow Longleat itself to survive, he opened the house to public visitors. Russell Page redesigned the gardens around the house to allow for tourists. The safari park opened in 1966. Alexander Thynn, 7th Marquess of Bath (1932–2020) was an artist and mural painter with a penchant for mazes and labyrinths: he created the hedge maze, the love labyrinth, the sun maze, the lunar labyrinth and King Arthur&#x27;s maze on the property. Ceawlin Thynn, 8th Marquess of Bath (born 1974) inherited in 2020.

A Titian work, &quot;Rest on the Flight into Egypt&quot; – worth more than £5m – was stolen from the drawing room in January 1995. It was found in a plastic shopping bag in London in 2002. Longleat staged the Red Bull Air Race in 2005. A copy of the painting &quot;The Fallen Madonna&quot;, a running joke from the BBC television sitcom &quot;&#x27;Allo &#x27;Allo!&quot;, was made for Henry Thynne and hangs in Longleat House.

===Media appearances===
The house has been much used as a film location, including: &quot;Libel&quot; (1959); several episodes of the BBC science-fiction television series &quot;Doctor Who&quot;, and for 30 years a Doctor Who Exhibition was hosted on the grounds, with an event celebrating the series&#x27;s 20th anniversary being held at the house at Easter 1983; the Indian Hindi film &quot;Mohabbatein&quot; (2000); and the BBC show &quot;How to Improve Your Memory&quot; (2006). The music video for Toni Braxton&#x27;s 1993 single &quot;Breathe Again&quot; was filmed at the house &amp; gardens.

==Architecture==
The tour of the house comprises: the Elizabethan Great Hall, with a minstrels&#x27; gallery; The lower east corridor, a wide room originally used as servant access to the main rooms. This now holds fine furniture and paintings. Also on display are two visitor books, one showing the signatures of Elizabeth II and Philip, the other Albert (George VI) and Elizabeth (the Queen Mother); the ante-library, with a magnificent Venetian painting on the ceiling; the Red Library, which displays many of the 40,000 books in the house; the Breakfast Room, with a ceiling to match the ante-library; the Lower Dining Room; the bathroom and bath-bedroom: the bath is a lead-lined tub of coopered construction, originally filled by hand from buckets and drained the same way; taps and drains are now provided. The lead lining was replaced in 2005. The room holds the first plumbed-in flush lavatory in the house; the State Dining Room, with a Meissen porcelain table centrepiece; the Saloon; the State Drawing Room, designed by Crace; the Robes Corridor; the Chinese Bedroom; the Music Room, with instruments including a barrel organ; the Prince of Wales Bedroom, so named because of a large painting of Henry Frederick, Prince of Wales, the brother of Charles I; the upper west corridor; the Grand Staircase; and the banqueting suite on the top floor: the furniture and interiors designed by Claire Rendall, the dining table commissioned from John Makepeace and the chandelier from Jocelyn Burton.

===Historic listing designations===
The house was designated as a Grade I listed building in 1968. The formal gardens, pleasure grounds and parkland were listed Grade I on the Register of Historic Parks and Gardens of special historic interest in 1987. Other Grade I listed buildings on the Longleat Estate include: the stables, the orangery, and the boathouse and bridge over the lake.

==Gallery==
==Visitor attractions==

Longleat Safari Park opened in 1966 as the first drive-through safari park outside Africa, and is home to over 500 animals, including Rothschild&#x27;s giraffes, Grant&#x27;s zebras, Rhesus monkeys, rhinos, African lions, Amur tigers and grey wolves. Cheetahs, koalas and spotted hyenas are among the most recent additions to the safari park. Four lion cubs were born in September 2011, making a total of ten cubs born that year, and Disney named two of them Simba and Nala as part of a co-promotion agreement for the upcoming &quot;Lion King&quot; 3D film.

Longleat House was built in the sixteenth century by Sir John Thynn on the site of a dissolved priory, and in 1949 became the first stately home in Britain to be opened to the public on a commercial basis. The house, park and attractions are open from mid-February to the start of November each year. The estate, of which the park occupies , has long been one of the top British tourist attractions, and has motivated other large landowners to generate income from their heritage in response to rising maintenance costs. Longleat leases of land to Center Parcs for the operation of the Longleat Forest holiday village.

The Longleat hedge maze is considered the world&#x27;s longest, with of pathway. The layout was by maze designer Greg Bright. Over 16,000 English yews form the walls surrounding a central tower, and there are six raised footbridges.

<doc id="788889" wikidata="Q285817" url="?curid=788889" title="Lithuanian Farmers and Greens Union">
<text>The Lithuanian Farmers and Greens Union (, LVŽS) is a green-conservative and agrarian political party in Lithuania led by Ramūnas Karbauskis. The party is considered one of the main representatives of the left wing of Lithuanian politics. Lithuanian journalist Virgis Valentinavičius described the party as &quot;the mixture of the extreme left in economic matters and the extreme right in some social issues, all spiced up with an anti-establishment rhetoric of radical change&quot;.

Following the 2024 parliamentary election, the LVŽS has been in opposition to the Paluckas Cabinet. The party&#x27;s one MEP sits in the European Conservatives and Reformists group in the European Parliament. Founded in 2001 as the Lithuanian Peasant Popular Union, (, LVLS), the party&#x27;s symbol since 2012 has been the white stork.

Formerly participating in the European Parliament group of the Greens–European Free Alliance, it announced its intention to join the European Conservatives and Reformists in 2024.

==History==

===Foundation and participation in the Social Democratic Party-led governments (2001–2008)===
In December 2001, the Lithuanian Peasants Party () and the New Democratic Party () entered into an electoral alliance known as the &quot;&quot; (VNDS), which translates to the Peasants and New Democratic Party Union or Union of Peasants and New Democratic Parties was formed. In 2002–03 Lithuanian presidential election party&#x27;s chairman Kazimira Prunskienė came with 5.04 per cent of the votes in the first round and saved its deposit. In the second round, she endorsed Rolandas Paksas of the Liberal Democratic Party, who won the election.

In the 2004 presidential election (after Rolandas Paksas was impeached), Kazimira Prunskienė narrowly came to the second position (21.25 per cent), but she was defeated in the second round (although, after endorsement of Rolandas Paksas). In 2004 European Parliament election, the party got 7.41 per cent of the votes and won one seat by Gintaras Didžiokas. He joined the Union for Europe of the Nations. In Seimas election later tahat same year, the party got 6.6 per cent of the votes. The Labour Party joined forces with Peasants and New Democratic Party Union and invited the Social Democratic Party of Lithuania to join. Brazauskas initially ruled out a coalition with Labour, but eventually Social Democrats and New Union (Social Liberals) joined forces with the Labour Party and the Peasants, with Brazauskas as the Prime Minister.

In February 2006, the Peasants and New Democratic Party Union led by Lithuanian politician Kazimiera Prunskienė chose to rename itself the Lithuanian Peasant Popular Union (after the pre-war Lithuanian Popular Peasants&#x27; Union).

In 2008 parliamentary election the party felt below 5 per cent threshold and was left with three members, who were elected in single-member constituencies.

===Opposition and leading force in the government (2009–2020)===
In 2009 Kazimira Prunskienė left the party and founded the party of her own (Lithuanian People&#x27;s Party). Although it was a minor party, it gained some influence in 2010 when it supported the Homeland Union-led government. The Lithuanian Peasants Popular Union changed its name to the Lithuanian Peasants and Greens Union in January 2012.

The party emerged as a dark horse in the electoral race in the spring of 2016. The rise of support was attributed to the popularity of Karbauskis, who had been active in campaigning against alcohol, and their lack of involvement in political scandals. LVŽS was further boosted by the announcement that Saulius Skvernelis, a Minister of Interior in Butkevičius Cabinet and one of the most popular politicians in Lithuania, would head the party&#x27;s electoral list in the elections, without joining the party.

After successful performance in the 2016 parliamentary elections, a clarification about its English name format was issued, changing it to Lithuanian Farmers and Greens Union. Also, after these election the Lithuanian Farmers and Greens Union became one of the main three political parties in Lithuania (along with the Homeland Union and the Social Democratic Party) at the time.

After these elections, various pundits claimed that the Lithuanian Farmers and Greens Union could form a coalition with the Homeland Union, but Ramūnas Karbauskis proposed wide coalition between the aforementioned parties and the Social Democratic Party. The Homeland Union&#x27;s leader Gabrielius Landsbergis himself proposed a coalition between the Homeland Union, the Lithuanian Farmers and Greens Union and the Liberal Movement, although both Ramūnas Karbauskis and the Liberal Movement&#x27;s leader Eugenijus Gentvilas turned down this offer. Eventually, a coalition was formed between the Lithuanian Farmers and Greens Union and the Social Democratic Party of Lithuania, which lasted until the autumn of 2017.

The party&#x27;s support gradually declined by 2018 (e. g. in 2019 European Parliament election the party got 11.92 per cent of the votes), although due to the rally &#x27;round the flag effect (caused by the COVID-19 pandemic), its support rebounded. In the 2020 parliamentary election the party won 18.07 per cent of the vote and 32 parliamentary seats. The party has been in opposition since 2020.

===Again in opposition (from 2020)===

After the elections, Ramūnas Karbauskis resigned from his parliamentary seat. After the electoral loss the party (along with the Labour Party) began to support various radical movements on the political fringes (e. g. Families&#x27; Defense March and the Lithuanian Family Movement). This position caused disagreements within party and its parliamentary group.

Disagreements had forced a split in the parliamentary group in late summer and early autumn of 2021, and former Prime Minister Saulius Skvernelis formed the newly established Union of Democrats &quot;For Lithuania&quot; (although this split was speculated by the pundits as early as March 2021). Due to this and the Social Democratic Party&#x27;s position not to support the opposition coalition, the party lost the position of opposition leader. By the end of 2021, the party started losing members in municipalities&#x27; districts (e. g. Lazdijai district municipality mayor Ausma Miškinienė left it along with the almost all LVŽS members in the area).

Aurelijus Veryga, Minister of Health in Skvernelis&#x27; cabinet, was put forward as the party&#x27;s candidate in the 2024 presidential election. In his electoral program, Veryga emphasized his support for traditional values and opposition to same-sex partnerships.

The party participated in the 2024 European Parliament election in Lithuania and aimed to win 3 seats in the European Parliament, up from 2 that it won in the 2019 European Parliament election in Lithuania. It toned down its populist and socially conservative stances and reoriented itself closer to environmentalism and green politics. However, the party won 9.13% of the popular vote (down from 12.56% in 2019) and only won a single seat.

In the 2024 Lithuanian parliamentary election, tahe party ran as a joint list with several politicians from the parties Young Lithuania and Lithuania – For Everyone. It caused the Central Election Commission to designate 7 per cent threshold for this party to obtain seats in multi-member constituency. LVŽS passed electoral threshold with just more than 250 votes. After the election joined the agreement with LSDP to form a government on 15 October. In the end, Dawn of Nemunas was chosen a third party of coalition, thus leaving LVŽS in opposition.

After being excluded from the government, LVŽS has formed an electoral group together with its long-standing ally, the Electoral Action of Poles in Lithuania – Christian Families Alliance. In November, Karbauskis addressed his party, expressing his regret of cooperation with conservative politicians such as Ignas Vėgėlė in the 2024 election, and announcing early leadership election in the LVŽS that would take place in early 2025, despite Karbauskis&#x27; term expiring in December 2025. Karbauskis stated that he is ready to either continue leading the party, or &quot;to step down honourably if most of the union members choose another leader&quot;. In January 2025, the party announced that its convention and early leadership election would take place on 1 March.
==Ideology==
Lithuanian Farmers and Greens Union is placed on the left of Lithuanian political spectrum, although with strong populist and socially conservative tendencies. The party is described as green conservative, agrarian and social conservative and is considered to be a blend of staunchly left-wing economic policy, environmentalism, and a conservative outlook on some sociocultural issues. Political scientist Ainė Ramonaitė has also described the party as &quot;right-wing on the moral dimension and left-wing on the economic
dimension&quot;, together with the Electoral Action of Poles in Lithuania – Christian Families Alliance. Economically, the party focuses on the importance of expanded healthcare and social welfare, whereas socially the party campaigns on traditional and Christian values and the need to stop the moral decay of contemporary society. Its economic ideology has been described as social-democratic, or akin to social democracy. The party is also described as technocratic and agrarian populist.

The rhetoric of the party is based on left-wing populism, prioritizing socioeconomic issues and establishing itself as the representative of the disadvantaged groups of Lithuanian society. Its voter base is composed of rural areas and small towns, and its supporters are mainly the poor, disadvantaged and anti-establishment voters. It criticizes other partes for neglecting the needs of the poor. The LVŽS is not a protest party however - it actively works with other parties and form cabinets. The party appeals to traditional left-wing electorate by stressing the need to reduce social inequality, invest in impoverished areas, and increase minimum wage. It strongly supports trade unions and promotes a union-favourable labor law, demands progressive taxation, and redistribution of wealth from &quot;business interests&quot; to &quot;the people&quot;. The party campaigns on opposition to neoliberal policies, accusing other parties of &quot;out-liberalizing&quot; each other in pursuit of &quot;avant-garde neoliberal policy ideas&quot; at the expense of vulnerable socioeconomic groups.

The main focus of the party is &quot;social solidarity and left-wing ideas&quot;. It criticizes right-leaning parties for anti-Russian sentiment as well as following the traditional division into &quot;ex-communists and anti-communists&quot;. The LVŽS to be neither post-communist nor anti-communist. Socially, the party makes somewhat conservative appeals, pledging to uphold &#x27;traditional&#x27; values, fight against alcohol and for &quot;sober way of living&quot;, and protecting Lithuanian language. It is less conservative on some other social matters - it postulates increased psychological services availability, old-age pensions rise, significant climate action via preservation, agricultural reform against large landowners, and environmental education. The party is regarded as moderate in its social conservatism.
===Origins===
Throughout its existence, the party has evolved from a purely agrarian party to a left-wing populist one, full of eclectic tendencies. Starting out as the farmer-focused &quot;Lithuanian Peasant Union&quot; () in the early 1990s, LVŽS was later renamed the &quot;Lithuanian Peasant Party&quot; () and started broadening its program beyond agricultural issues, joining forces with the &quot;Lithuanian Women Party&quot; () in 1995. In the early 2000s, the Lithuanian Peasant Party was becoming increasingly left-wing, leading to the change of its name to the &quot;Lithuanian Peasant People’s Party&quot; () in 2005, which was to highlight both the leftwards turn of the party and to connect itself to the interwar peasant movements in Lithuania.

In 2012, the party was renamed again to the Lithuanian Union of Peasants and Greens, after its leader Ramūnas Karbauskis steered the party towards green politics, strongly promoting renewable energy and campaigning against nuclear power plants. This led the party to combine both agricultural interests and elements of green politics, which at the time was condemned as a &#x27;somewhat schizophrenic&#x27; political mix. At the same time, led by Karbauskis, it initiated the 2014 Lithuanian constitutional referendum, which sought to prohibit the ownership of land in Lithuania to foreign citizens, in violation of Lithuania&#x27;s terms of membership in the European Union. Karbauskis opposed Lithuania&#x27;s accession to the European Union before 2004, although the party emphasized its pro-Europeanism during the 2016 campaign. Between 2012 and 2016, the party also adopted right-wing views on social issues. In the 2016 Lithuanian parliamentary election, the main message of LVŽS was the need to fight poverty and social exclusion, for which the party blamed economic liberalism and pro-business policies by previous Lithuanian governments.

===Economic issues===
Economically, the party is described as &#x27;extreme-left&#x27; and strongly populist, presenting itself as a party of ordinary people. It is described as social democratic economically. LVŽS argues that wealth inequality is one of Lithuania&#x27;s key problems, contrasting the prosperity of Vilnius and the urban middle class with the impoverished Lithuanian countryside, struggling with high unemployment and lack of prospects. In its ideological manifesto &quot;The Government Program for Sustainable Lithuania&quot; (), LVŽS declared: &quot;Addressing regional poverty and exclusion must become a priority task for the new government. Recognising that the economic cause of high unemployment and emigration is relatively low wages, we will take swift and effective measures to increase the income of the population, while at the same time striving to ensure an adequate social safety net.&quot; Accentuating the agrarianism of the party, the program also put heavy importance on &quot;preserving the vitality of the Lithuanian countryside&quot;.

LVŽS defines an economy that would prioritize the &#x27;common man&#x27; as its goal, emphasizing the need to implement worker-friendly reforms in healthcare and education, a significant increase in wages and pensions, and the drastic revision of Lithuania&#x27;s labour code, which the party has denounced as pro-business. The party has pledged to create a state-owned pharmacy network and sharply reduce drug prices, and initiated an anti-alcohol campaign, which it implemented by increasing excise duty on alcohol, raising minimum drinking age to 20, introducing a total ban on alcohol advertising and establishing a state monopoly on alcohol trade. The party is also strongly pro-union, and was praised for improving social dialogue between the state and the unions, and implementing a number of union-favourable collective agreements in the public sector. It also promotes public awareness and the visibility of trade unions, and encourages workers to join them. The party also postulated a ban on land sales to foreigners.

One of the party&#x27;s main economic goals is to replace the privatization of retirement saving accounts and other welfare programs. After 1991, Lithuania &quot;zealously embraced neoliberal doctrines&quot; and became characterized by one of the lowest levels of social expenditure and the highest levels of poverty and inequality among EU Member States; the pensioners were amongst the poorest voting constituencies of Lithuania. LVŽS appealed to the impoverished pensioners for political support and pledged to restructure and nationalize the &quot;second pillar&quot; pension program. The party&#x27;s plan &quot;mobilized a number of powerful and vocal constituencies such as the banking, life insurance, private pension fund industries, as well as business lobbying groups that had high stakes in pension reform.&quot;
===Social issues===
The party&#x27;s program emphasises a commitment to establishing a &quot;strong family&quot; as the core of Lithuanian society. It also strongly praises the Catholic Church and its teachings, and opposes abortion, same-sex partnerships and assisted reproductive technologies on the basis of the Catholic faith. Despite this, in the twelfth Seimas, the LVŽS was a big tent in regards to social issues, and some of its members such as Dovilė Šakalienė and Tomas Tomilinas were strong supporters of feminism, minority rights and civil partnerships for same-sex couples. Since the 2020 election, the party has increasingly turned socially conservative, especially after its more liberal members of the Seimas joined the Union of Democrats &quot;For Lithuania&quot;. The party&#x27;s vice-chairman Tomas Tomilinas was expelled from the party in 2021 for voting in favor of same-sex partnerships.

Given the social conservatism of the LVŽS and its emphasis on Christian values, traditional family and preservation of national identity, its rule was compared to that of Polish Law and Justice or Hungarian Fidesz. However, unlike these parties, LVŽS did not mark a break with the liberal course of the European Union. Ukrainian political scientist Nataliya Khoma argues that the social conservatism of the party is moderate, stating that LVŽS &quot;bypassed the issue of sexual minority rights&quot; and despite promoting conservative values, the party did not adopt &quot;a radical platform that exacerbates this issue&quot;.

===Electoral campaigns===
LVŽS&#x27;s success in the 2016 parliamentary election has been compared to the victory of Donald Trump in the 2016 United States presidential election. According to Virgis Valentinavičius, both Trump and Karbauskis constructed a narrative of &#x27;us against them&#x27;, opposing themselves against the elite, in spite of both being among the wealthiest people in their respective countries, and both also shifted the blame for their early scandals to the media and the conspiracy of the establishment.

In December 2023, the party took part in a meeting called &quot;The family of European Conservatives is expanding&quot; organized by the European Conservatives and Reformists.

In the 2024 European Parliament election in Lithuania, the party focused on the environmental issues and promoted green politics, and toned down its socially conservative policies. After the election, however, it joined the right-wing and Eurosceptic ECR Party.

<text>William Jordan Flake (July 3, 1839 – August 10, 1932) was a prominent member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, who helped settle parts of Arizona, and was imprisoned at the Yuma Territorial Prison for polygamy.

== Life and career ==
Flake was born in Anson County, North Carolina, the fourth son of Agnes Love and James Madison Flake. When he was three, his family moved to Kemper County, Mississippi. In 1844, they became members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and moved to Nauvoo, Illinois. Flake and his family moved to the Salt Lake Valley in 1846 by wagon train with the Mormon pioneers, arriving in 1848. In 1849, his father was killed on the American River while examining a gold mining site for the church in California. His widowed mother took her three children to San Bernardino; she died in 1856. Flake and his siblings returned to Utah to live with Amasa Lyman and his family.

On December 30, 1858, William Flake married Lucy Hannah White; they were nineteen and sixteen years old respectively. A year later, they started a cattle ranch in Beaver County, Utah. Flake was called by church leaders to enter into a plural marriage in 1868. Lucy agreed to the marriage, because of her belief in the LDS Church; she even helped choose his second wife. William Flake and Prudence Kartchner were married in October 1868. Flake and Kartchner would have seven children.

In 1877, he was called by LDS Church President Brigham Young to start a settlement in the northern area of what was then the Arizona Territory. William left with a wagon train and herds of cattle for the Little Colorado River region of Arizona and arrived in January 1878. Despite much hardship after spending 13 months on the trail and a winter living in stables and wagons, the settlement survived. In the fall of 1878, Erastus Snow, an LDS Apostle, visited and joined with Flake naming the town &quot;Snowflake&quot;: &quot;Snow for me and Flake for you.&quot;

On December 5, 1884, Flake was tried in Prescott, Arizona in the District Court and found guilty for practice of polygamy and unlawful cohabitation, a common charge used to prosecute LDS men under the Edmunds Act. Flake received a $500 fine and was imprisoned in the Yuma Territorial Prison for six months. While in prison, Flake still served as one of the counselors to the bishop of the Snowflake ward. Flake was treated humanely in prison, reportedly allowed to work how he pleased, read as much as he pleased, and eat &quot;excellent food&quot;. He was released from prison on June 11, 1885. After he returned from prison, Prudence and Lucy became pregnant. Prudence gave birth to twins on June 7, 1886. They died at birth. Lucy gave birth on July 28, 1886; her child died a few months later from pneumonia.

Flake&#x27;s plural wife Prudence died on February 8, 1896. During his marriage, Flake was often away from home, on the ranch and tending to livestock. His wife Lucy Flake died on January 27, 1900, at age fifty-seven. William Flake would never remarry. In 1901, Flake served in the Southern States mission. He also sponsored genealogical research and continued ranching.

In 1959, Flake was posthumously nominated and then inducted into the National Cowboy Hall of Fame in the Hall of Great Westerners for his contributions as a colonizer and cattleman as Arizona&#x27;s fourth entry.

William Jordan Flake was the father of 11 sons and nine daughters and lived to the age of 93, passing away on August 10, 1932, in Snowflake.

==Legacy==
Flake&#x27;s descendants include:
* (great-great-grandson) Jeff Flake, a former U.S. Senator (R-AZ) and current ambassador to Turkey 
* (great-great-granddaughter) Kathleen Flake, a professor of American religious history at the University of Virginia
* (great-grandson, and Jeff Flake&#x27;s uncle) Former Speaker of the Arizona House and later State Senator Jake Flake

In 1959, Flake was inducted into the Hall of Great Westerners of the National Cowboy &amp; Western Heritage Museum.

Flake founded Snowflake, Arizona with Erastus Snow, and the town bears their names.

<doc id="788892" wikidata="Q892936" url="?curid=788892" title="Octoban">
<text>Octobans, also known as tube toms, are deep, small diameter, single-head tom-toms. Octobans were originally grouped in melodically-tuned sets of eight, hence the name, in reference to octave and from octo meaning &quot;eight&quot;.

Part sets of two or four drums or an individual drum or octo are common additions to a drum kit.

Complete and half sets of octobans are commonly mounted in clusters of four, in a square pattern. Mounts for four drums in a straight line, dual mounts for two drums, and individual mounts are all also reasonably common.

==History==

Octobans were introduced by Tama Drums in 1978, and endorsed by Billy Cobham, at that time one of the most popular drummers who had switched to Tama drums. Tama octobans were made with fiberglass using a patented molding process. The naked shells were then painted in black lacquer (the raw color is something close to light brown, visible inside the shell where not completely painted). Since they were designed as rack toms the attachment was different from that used on regular tom toms - basically the same one used for concert toms. The rims were shaped to expose the maximum possible head area to the stick, since a 6&quot; diameter is not easy to hit reliably. The lugs (4) were the same model used for the Swingstar series drum kits of the same period. The shell was 6&quot; across (150 mm outside diameter), and the thickness was 5 mm, though the very first series may have been 4 mm as advertised. A variation was produced in the late 1970s using plexiglas instead of fiberglass for the shell construction; the plexiglas was considerably more fragile. During the 1978-1984 period, Tama offered the complete 8 piece set or two sub-sets of four pieces each, low pitch (i.e. longest) and high pitch. Some famous drummers used the low pitch set, for example Stewart Copeland throughout Police period. The dimensions of the low pitch set of shells were the following (length mm, edge to edge): 810, 733, 667, 607. The high pitch set was dimensioned as follows: 552, 498, 455, 411 mm. All had a 6-inch diameter. In 1985 Tama modified the octobans by reducing the length of the shells. The low-pitch-only set was discontinued because they had proved difficult to transport on stage. The lengths available in 2023 are the following: 600, 536, 472, 443, 390, 343, 301, 280 (mm). The lug design has been modified from the original, and though the batter skin is still clear it no longer has the black dot. The different lengths of the cylinders give each drum its distinct tone.

The term &quot;octoban&quot; has since become a generic trademark used to refer to such sets of narrow-diameter tube drums.

===Other makers===
6&quot; diameter:
* Pearl
* Drum Workshop Rata Tom.
* ddrum Deccabon.
Other diameters:
* Meinl Percussion Attack Timbales, 8&quot; diameter.

Octoban drum shells from other manufacturers are of varying lengths, and made from materials like fiberglass, acrylic, aluminum, and wood. Some people build their own octobans out of PVC or similar commercial tubing.

<doc id="788893" wikidata="Q885679" url="?curid=788893" title="Marcellus Stearns">
<text>Marcellus Lovejoy Stearns (April 29, 1839 – December 8, 1891) was an American politician who served as the 11th Governor of Florida from 1874 to 1877 during the Reconstruction Era. Originally from Maine, he also served in the Union Army during the American Civil War, losing an arm, and served in Florida&#x27;s 1868 constitutional convention and in the Florida House of Representatives, including time as speaker.

Born in Lovell in Oxford County in southwestern Maine, he attended Waterville College in Waterville, Maine (which later became Colby College). In 1861, he joined the Union Army and lost an arm during the Battle of Opequon in Winchester, Virginia, after which the Army sent him to study law. He was assigned to Quincy in Gadsden County in the Florida Panhandle, where he remained after his discharge from the military.

Stearns was a member of the Florida Constitutional Convention of 1868 and the Florida House of Representatives from 1868 through 1872, of which he was the Speaker in 1869. He was elected the fifth Lieutenant Governor of Florida in 1872.

He succeeded to the governorship on March 18, 1874, at age 34 when Governor Ossian B. Hart died of pneumonia. He remains the state&#x27;s youngest-serving governor. Stearns attempted to force Jonathan Clarkson Gibbs to resign his post as Superintendent of Public Instruction, but was unsuccessful due to Gibbs&#x27; immense popularity. After leaving office on January 2, 1877, he was appointed U. S. Commissioner in Hot Springs, Arkansas, a post that he held until 1880. He died in Palatine Bridge, New York, fifty miles from the capital city of Albany. He is interred in the village of Center Lovell, Maine.

After he left office on January 2, 1877, there was no Republican governor of Florida until 1967, when Claude Kirk was inaugurated.

The schedule covers primetime hours from September 1959 through March 1960. The schedule is followed by a list per network of returning series, new series, and series cancelled after the 1958–59 season.

By the end of the 1950s, the three major U.S. television networks had basically given up direct control of their TV programs. According to TV historians Castleman and Podrazik (1982), ABC allowed Warner Brothers studios to fill 30% of its fall 1959 schedule. The networks &quot;acted as mere conduits&quot;, with Warner, Talent Associates, Revue Studios, Ziv, Screen Gems, 20th Century-Fox, Goodson-Todman, and Desilu Studios producing nearly everything on the networks; with rare exceptions, only network news and sports were still produced in-house.

By fall 1959 what the Hollywood studios were producing were mostly Westerns. According to Castleman and Podrazik (1984), &quot;the rush to Westerns had become a virtual stampede so that, by the fall of 1959, viewers had their choice from a staggering twenty-eight different Western-based prime time series.&quot; Westerns were popular with audiences, but critics lamented the loss of other program formats, which had quietly vanished from the three networks&#x27; schedules. The addition of Westerns and game shows came at the direct expense of the live dramatic anthology series seen during the Golden Age of Television.

All times are Eastern and Pacific. New fall series are highlighted in bold.

The official schedule was set by each network before the start of the official fall season. The fall season is from September to November in the U.S.. The mid-season schedule is listed under the official fall season lineup of each network. The mid-season schedule is from December 1959 to May 1960.

Each of the 30 highest-rated shows is listed with its rank and rating as determined by Nielsen Media Research.

: Yellow indicates the programs in the top 10 for the season.
: Cyan indicates the programs in the top 20 for the season.
: Magenta indicates the programs in the top 30 for the season.

<text>Economic power refers to the ability of countries, businesses or individuals to make decisions on their own that benefit them. Scholars of international relations also refer to the economic power of a country as a factor influencing its power in international relations.

== Definition ==
Economists use several concepts featuring the word power:
* Market power is the ability of a firm to profitably raise the market price of a good or service over marginal cost.
** Monopoly power is a strong form of market power—the ability to set prices or wages unilaterally. This is the opposite of the situation in a perfectly competitive market in which supply and demand set prices.
* Purchasing power, i.e. the ability of any amount of money to buy goods and services. Those with more assets, or more correctly net worth, have more power of this sort. The greater the liquidity of one&#x27;s assets, the greater one&#x27;s purchasing power is. Purchasing power parity is a way of adjusting exchange rate valuations to reflect the actual goods or services that can be purchased for a given amount of currency.
* Corporate power, the landmark of corporate capitalism in which with corporations and large business interest groups have power and influence over government policy, including the policies of regulatory agencies and influencing political campaigns.
* Bargaining power, i.e. the ability of players in a bargaining game to influence the outcome which is the players sharing rule for something (a prize, a cake or access to resources). Information is a contributor to bargaining power. In the case of two agents entering into a contract, if one agent knows that their deal will turn out significantly better, or worse, than the other suspects, then they are exercising a form of informational economic power (see information asymmetry).
* Managerial power, i.e. the ability of managers to threaten their employees with firing or other penalties for not following orders or for not giving in satisfying reports. This exists if there is a cost of job loss, especially due to the existence of unemployment and workers&#x27; lack of sufficient assets to survive without working for pay.
* Worker power, i.e. the ability of workers to threaten their managers with resignation for not providing satisfying working conditions. This exists if there is a cost of hiring, especially due to the existence of low unemployment, recruiting costs, or training costs.
* Class power in Marxian political economy refers to a situation under capitalism where a minority (the capitalists) in society controls the means of production and therefore is able to exploit the majority (the workers).

<text>Stewart Rawlings Mott (December 4, 1937 – June 12, 2008) was an American philanthropist who founded the Stewart R. Mott Foundation. He was the son of Charles Stewart Mott (a co-founder of General Motors) and appeared on Nixon&#x27;s Enemies List for his support of liberal causes.

== Biography ==
Stewart Rawlings Mott was born on December 4, 1937, in Flint, Michigan, to Charles Stewart Mott and Ruth Rawlings, Mr. Mott&#x27;s fourth wife. Charles Mott, who had a company manufacturing wheels and axles at the beginning in the 1900s, took advantage of the auto industry’s rapid growth and sold his company to General Motors for stocks, becoming G.M.&#x27;s largest individual shareholder.

Mott attended the Massachusetts Institute of Technology for three years and finished his education at the Columbia University School of General Studies, earning two bachelor&#x27;s degrees, one in business administration and one in comparative literature. Mott graduated in 1961 and inherited $6 million with $850,000 in annual income from two trust funds; Mott used his resources to create the first Planned Parenthood clinic in his hometown of Flint, Michigan. He wrote a thesis on Sophocles for a Master&#x27;s Degree from Columbia, which he never finished. His philanthropy included abortion reform, birth control, sex research, feminism, arms control, gay rights, civil liberties, governmental reform, and research on extrasensory perception. 

In the 1970s, Mott contracted for the purchase of a multimillion‐dollar quadruplex penthouse in New York City that he had designed to meet his specific needs—&quot;allowing him to greet the sun on rising from his bed in the East Solarium and to watch it sink from a desk that faces west, all amid 10,000 square feet reserved for planting&quot;. By late 1975, never having occupied the penthouse, he was negotiating to get out of the purchase, whose price had risen to $3.5 million.

In 1978, Mott gave his occupation as &quot;maverick&quot; in the photo essay &quot;Cat People&quot;.

Shortly prior to his death Mott resided in Bermuda for most of his time, and also traveled to his numerous houses in the United States. His homes included a penthouse in 800 Park Avenue in Manhattan, a house trailer on a Florida farm, and a Chinese junk moored on the Hudson River in New York City.

<text>Christopher Hinton, Baron Hinton of Bankside (12 May 190122 June 1983) was a British nuclear engineer, and supervisor of the construction of Calder Hall, the first large-scale nuclear power station in the West.

==Career==
Hinton was born on 12 May 1901 at Tisbury, Wiltshire. He attended school in Chippenham where his father was a schoolmaster, and left school at 16 to become an engineering apprentice with the Great Western Railway at Swindon. At 22 he was awarded the William Henry Allen scholarship of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers to Trinity College, Cambridge, where he graduated with a first class honours degree.

Hinton then worked for Brunner Mond, later part of ICI, where he became Chief Engineer at the age of 29. At Brunner Mond he met Lillian Boyer (d. 1973) whom he married in 1931. They had one daughter, Mary (1932–2014), who married Arthur Mole, son of Sir Charles Mole, director-general of the Ministry of Works.

During World War II, Hinton was seconded to the Ministry of Supply and became Deputy Director General, running ordnance factory construction and in charge of the Royal Filling Factories.

In 1946, Hinton was appointed Deputy Controller of Production, Atomic Energy, and in 1954 when the Atomic Energy Authority was formed, was appointed Member for Engineering and Production as managing director of &#x27;Industrial Group Risley&#x27; which comprised the Risley headquarters and laboratories at Culcheth, Capenhurst, Windscale, Springfields and Dounreay plus factories at Springfields, Capenhurst, Windscale, Calder, Dounreay and Chapelcross. Hinton&#x27;s department was responsible for the design and construction of most of Britain&#x27;s major nuclear plants, including Windscale, Capenhurst, Springfields and Dounreay. 

In 1957, Hinton became the first chairman of the Central Electricity Generating Board (CEGB). He retired in 1964 but right up until the time of his death the CEGB kept an office for him at their headquarters in Paternoster Square. For his 80th birthday the Research Division gave a party at which a birthday cake was equipped with 80 candles. These were so closely spaced that when he lit the central candle, the flame spread rapidly to all of the others – Sir Christopher had initiated his last chain reaction!

In 1965 he worked for six months in the Ministry of Transport and afterwards became a special adviser to the World Bank. He served as Chairman of the International Executive Committee of the World Energy Conference, 1962–68.

He was created Baron Hinton of Bankside, of Dulwich in the County of London, a life peer, on 28 January 1965, and served as Chancellor of the University of Bath 1966 – 1979. He was appointed to the Order of Merit in 1976.

==Hinton Heavies==

The English architectural critic Reyner Banham dubbed the first 500MW units ordered by the CEGB the Hinton Heavies. A first for 500MW power station design, the stations are listed below in the order that the CEGB released them for construction.

The 500 MW standard unit design was subsequently slightly scaled up to 660 MW, using the same main and reheat steam conditions. These larger units were constructed from 1967 onwards at Drax, Grain and Littlebrook power stations. Similar 660 MW turbogenerators were also installed at all of Britain&#x27;s AGR nuclear power stations, albeit with radically different steam-raising plant.

The 660 MW units were the largest generating plant, and the last pure steam-cycle plant, ever constructed by the CEGB before its break-up and privatisation in the 1990s.

==The Hinton Cup and Hinton Trophy==
During his time at the Central Electricity Generating Board (CEGB) he commissioned the Hinton Cup, a piece of silverware that would be presented annually to the power station that displayed good housekeeping in the workplace. The citation to go with the cup reads &#x27;This cup is presented to the Power Station judged to have reached the highest attainment in economy and efficiency of operation and maintenance with particular reference to attractiveness and good housekeeping&#x27;.

The cup was first won by Meaford A power station in 1959 and was last won by West Burton Power Station prior to the divestment of the CEGB. The Hinton Trophy was the equivalent award for the best Transmission District. Because of the miners&#x27; strike there was no competition in 1984–85. To commemorate the thirty years of awarding the cup and trophy a presentation plate was manufactured by Gladstone Pottery Museum in Stoke-on-Trent.
