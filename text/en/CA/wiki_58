<text>Lifford (, historically anglicised as &quot;Liffer&quot;) is the county town of County Donegal, Ireland, the administrative centre of the county and the seat of Donegal County Council, although the town of Letterkenny is often mistaken as holding this role.

Lifford lies in the Finn Valley area of East Donegal where the River Finn meets the River Mourne to create the River Foyle. The Burn Dale (also spelt as the Burn Deele), which flows through Ballindrait, flows into the River Foyle on the northern outskirts of Lifford.

==History==
The town grew up around a castle built there by Manghus Ó Domhnaill, ruler of Tír Chonaill (mostly modern County Donegal), in the 16th century. It later became a British Army garrison town until most of Ireland won independence as a dominion called the Irish Free State in early December 1922. It lies across the River Foyle from Strabane (in County Tyrone, Northern Ireland) and is linked to that town by Lifford Bridge. Manus O&#x27;Donnell began building the castle in 1527 on the Wednesday after St. Brendan&#x27;s Day (Saint Brendan&#x27;s feast day is celebrated on 16 May). He completed the masonry and woodwork by the end of that summer even though the O&#x27;Neills of Tír Eoghain were at war with him. In 1543 the castle of &quot;Leithbher&quot; was given to Cahir (the son of Donnell Balbh) O&#x27;Gallagher to be guarded for the O&#x27;Donnell clan. He then proceeded to banish the people loyal to the O&#x27;Donnells from the castle so that he could keep it for himself. In 1544 Calvagh went to the English Lord Justice, and brought back English soldiers with him to Tirconnell, the olden name for County Donegal. O&#x27;Donnell, Calvagh, and these men went with ‘ordnance and engines for taking towns’ to the castle of Lifford to take it back from the descendants of the O&#x27;Gallaghers.

Cahir, the son of Tuathal Balbh &amp; Turlough, the son of Felim Fin O&#x27;Gallagher, who had been taken hostage earlier, was brought to the castle to see if the O&#x27;Gallaghers would surrender. Which they would not. As the English attacked one was killed instantly so they killed Cahir, the son of Tuathal on the spot. The castle was then surrendered to O&#x27;Donnell to spare the life of Turlough, the son of Felim Fin and another son of Tuathal Balbh.
Lifford Castle is no longer standing but there is a poem from the late 16th century about the castle, which describes the owners and surroundings at the time.
&lt;poem&gt;
::&quot;A beloved dwelling is the castle of Lifford, homestead of a wealth abounding encampment; forge of hospitality for the men of Ulster, a dwelling it is hard to leave.
::Beloved are the two who keep that house without excess, without lack; the ward of the stout, even-surfaced tower are the supporting pillars of the province.
::Short is the day, no matter what its length, in the company of the royal warrior of Conchobhar&#x27;s Plain; fleet are the long days from the lady of bright-walled Tara.
::The daughter of noble Shane O&#x27;Neill, and the son of O&#x27;Donnell of Dún Iomgháin—they are in the ancient, comely dwelling as entertainers of guests.
::Dear the hostel in which these are wont to be, dear the folk who dwell in the hostel; the people of the house and the house of that people happy is any who shall get honor such as theirs.
::Beloved the delightful, lofty building, its tables, its coverlets, its cupboards; its wondrous, handsome, firm walls, its smooth marble arches.
::Beloved is the castle in which we used to spend a while at chess-playing, a while with the daughters of the men of Bregia, a while with the fair books of the poets.
::The fortress of smooth-lawned Lifford no one in the world can leave it once it is found; that dwelling is the Durlas of the north.
::Or else it is Eamhain which used to vary in form, or Croghan of the children of Mágha, or Tara of the race of Cobhthach—this bright castle, rich in trees and horses.
::Or it is Naas, the fortress of Leinster, as it was first fashioned; or the fertile, ancient abode of the children of Corc, green, conspicuous Cashel.
::Or it is fair Lifford itself—hardly is any of these castles better—which hath of yore assumed those shapes ye are wont to hold dear&quot;.&lt;/poem&gt;

The Battle of Lifford was fought in 1600 during Tyrone&#x27;s Rebellion.

Following the defeat of O&#x27;Doherty&#x27;s Rebellion at the Battle of Kilmacrennan in 1608, a number of captured rebels were brought to Lifford where they were tried by Irish civilian courts and executed. The most notable rebel to be executed was Phelim Reagh MacDavitt.

Lifford achieved national recognition in the 2008 Tidy Towns Awards as the best newcomer to the competition in Category &#x27;C&#x27;.

==Political representation==

The borough constituency of Lifford elected two MPs to the Irish House of Commons from 1692 until 1800. It was disfranchised under the Acts of Union 1800. The borough corporation of the town was abolished under the Municipal Corporations (Ireland) Act 1840.

Lifford is part of the Dáil constituency of Donegal.

For elections to Donegal County Council, it is part of the local electoral area of Lifford–Stranorlar. This area also forms a municipal district.

==Demographics==
Lifford has a population of 1,613 as of the 2022 census, a decrease of 13 on the 2016 census. Of the 1,626 residents in 2016, 794 were male and 832 female.

Lifford is part of the Civil Parish of Clonleigh; with a population of 3,547, the parish is subdivided for electoral purposes into two separate Electoral Districts: Clonleigh North and Clonleigh South, which are mainly separated by the Burn Dale.

==Historical buildings and places of interest==
===Lifford Courthouse===
Lifford Courthouse is now a restaurant and heritage centre and is located across from the County House, the HQ of Donegal County Council, in The Diamond area of the town. The courthouse was designed by Michael Priestly of Dublin and built in 1746. The museum houses a permanent display of O&#x27;Donnell clan documents and artefacts, as well as minute books from various institutes in County Donegal. It also houses some of the original cells belonging to the Courthouse.

===Lifford Gaol===
Lifford Gaol was formerly the County Gaol or prison for all of County Donegal. It was located on the northeastern side of The Diamond. The old gaol was demolished in 1907.

===Cavanacor House===
Cavanacor House is located just off the N14 on the outskirts of the town - which one ancestral home of the 11th President of the United States of America, James Knox Polk. His great, great, great-grandmother (Magdelene Tasker) was born here in 1634, she later married Capt. Robert Bruce Pollock and emigrated to the US. King James II &amp; VII dined at Cavanacor House on his way to the Siege of Derry in 1689.

===Prior Endowed School===
The school was built in 1880 to cater for local Protestant children with monies bequeathed by Miss Eleanor Prior from nearby Ballindrait. The Prior School closed in 1972, being amalgamated with The Royal School in Raphoe to create The Royal &amp; Prior Comprehensive School. The school and grounds were first taken over by the then Irish Department of Posts and Telegraphs, and later (from 1974) by the Irish Defence Forces for use as a military barracks. The Barracks has since closed along with Rockhill House Military Post in Letterkenny, on 31 January 2009.

===St. Lugadius&#x27;s Church===

St. Lugadius&#x27;s, also known as Clonleigh (Church of Ireland) Parish Church, was built in 1621. Sir Richard Hansard, who had been granted land at Lifford, directed in his will that a church be built in Lifford. There is a monument to Sir Richard and his wife Dame Anne inside the church, with a plaque on the wall detailing his wishes and who the executors of his will were. In the graveyard George Gardiner, who won a Victoria Cross during the Crimean War in 1855, is buried.

===St. Patrick&#x27;s Church===

St. Patrick&#x27;s Church, usually known locally as Murlog Chapel, is the second Catholic church on the present site. The first church was built here at Murlog in the 18th century after the Earl of Erne saw Catholic worshippers praying in the open. The church was later demolished to make way for the new church which was built in 1963. A three-stage gothic tower dating from about 1820 was attached to the old church and was saved by the parish; it is still standing next to the new church. The church is in the parish of Clonleigh, formerly Clonleigh and Camus until it was established as an independent parish in 1974.

===Lifford Community Hospital===
The hospital was once the County Hospital catering for all of County Donegal. It is located on the banks of the River Foyle just before the bridge into County Tyrone. Although this is not the first location of the County Hospital, It was originally in the diamond area of the town in a place called the Barrack yard. The Hospital first opened in this location in 1773. The first surgeon was a man called Mr. William Hamilton from nearby Strabane. In 1780 it was proposed to move to new premises with the Cavalry Barracks and stables in the town being sought, it was not until 1799 that the premises were renovated and ready to be occupied. In the early 1900s, the hospital was operating at full strength with the Maternity and Surgical wards treating on average 400 patients and carrying out around 350 operations annually. The hospital today caters for long and short-term residents by providing a convalescent and respite service. Physiotherapy and chiropody services are also provided in the hospital for the in-patients and out-patients from the greater East Donegal area.

===Hansard&#x27;s Grammar School===
The will of Sir Richard Hansard in 1619, endowed a private school, in Lifford. The will provided for 30 pounds sterling a year for a master, and 20 pounds sterling a year for an usher. The school was intended to cater for classical studies. All children of Clonleigh parish were to be entitled to attend for free education. Hansards&#x27; Grammar School commenced operations in 1697. In 1791, the Commissioners of Education reported that there were no free scholars in the school out of an attendance of 18, of whom 6 were boarders. The Commissioners of 1807–1812 reported the school as being in a very unsatisfactory condition. While the headmaster and usher were being paid salaries according to the endowment, the teaching had been handed off to a third person on a wage of 6 pounds sterling a year. Furthermore, classical subjects were not being taught, only arithmetic. The school continued in decline until 1840, when an inspection by the Commissioners precipitated the resignation of the master, who was accused of major neglect. Attendance which had been as low as three pupils rapidly increased under a new classical teacher. Sometime before 1856, the Earl Erne (whose family, the Creightons / Crichtons, had originally settled in Ulster at Lifford before moving south to County Fermanagh), on behalf of the Church of Ireland Bishop of Derry and Raphoe, converted the school into an English-style school, and hired a master and mistress. Both were dismissed in 1856. At this time there was a dwelling house attached to the school, lived in by a previous master. In 1857, the school was reopened as an English school under the management of the Bishop of Derry and Raphoe.

===Road===
Lifford is known as the &quot;Gateway to Donegal&quot;; this is because it is the first town in County Donegal encountered when travelling from Dublin on the N2 (A5/A38 through County Tyrone). Drivers cross Lifford Bridge as they enter Lifford. Two national primary routes, the N15 to Sligo via Stranorlar, Donegal Town and Ballyshannon and also the N14 to Letterkenny, take travellers to all parts in the county. There is also the R265/R236/A40 national secondary route to Derry City. Lifford has several daily bus services operated by Bus Éireann to Dublin Airport / Dublin City Centre (Busáras). They also serve Letterkenny and Ballybofey, where connections can be had for travelling onwards to Sligo with its railway station and bus station.

<text>Randall Jarrell (May 6, 1914 – October 14, 1965) was an American poet, literary critic, children&#x27;s author, essayist, and novelist. He was the 11th Consultant in Poetry to the Library of Congress—a position that now bears the title Poet Laureate of the United States.

Among other honors, Jarrell was awarded a Guggenheim Fellowship for the years 1947–48; a grant from the National Institute of Arts and Letters, in 1951; and the National Book Award for Poetry, in 1961.

==Biography==
===Youth and education===
Jarrell was a native of Nashville, Tennessee. He attended Hume-Fogg High School where he &quot;practiced tennis, starred in some school plays, and began his career as a critic with satirical essays in a school magazine.&quot; He received his B.A. from Vanderbilt University in 1935. While at Vanderbilt, he edited the student humor magazine &quot;The Masquerader&quot;, was captain of the tennis team, made Phi Beta Kappa and graduated &quot;magna cum laude&quot;. He studied there under Robert Penn Warren, who first published Jarrell&#x27;s criticism; Allen Tate, who first published Jarrell&#x27;s poetry; and John Crowe Ransom, who gave Jarrell his first teaching job as a Freshman Composition instructor at Kenyon College in Gambier, Ohio. Although all of these Vanderbilt tutors were involved with the conservative Southern Agrarian movement, Jarrell did not become a supporter of the Agrarians himself. According to Stephanie Burt, &quot;Jarrell—a devotee of Marx and Auden— embraced his teachers&#x27; literary stances while rejecting their politics.&quot; He also completed his Master&#x27;s degree in English at Vanderbilt in 1937, beginning his thesis on A. E. Housman (which he completed in 1939).

When Ransom left Vanderbilt for Kenyon College in Ohio that same year, a number of his loyal students, including Jarrell, followed him to Kenyon. Jarrell taught English at Kenyon for two years, coached tennis, and served as the resident faculty member in an undergraduate dormitory that housed future writers Robie Macauley, Peter Taylor, and poet Robert Lowell. Lowell and Jarrell remained good friends and peers until Jarrell&#x27;s death. According to Lowell biographer Paul Mariani, &quot;Jarrell was the first person of [Lowell&#x27;s] own generation [whom he] genuinely held in awe&quot; due to Jarrell&#x27;s brilliance and confidence even at the age of 23.

===Career===
Jarrell went on to teach at the University of Texas at Austin from 1939 to 1942, where he began to publish criticism and where he met his first wife, Mackie Langham. In 1942 he left the university to join the United States Army Air Forces. According to his obituary, he &quot;[started] as a flying cadet, [then] he later became a celestial navigation tower operator, a job title he considered the most poetic in the Air Force.&quot; His early poetry, in particular “The Death of the Ball Turret Gunner,” would principally concern his wartime experiences in the Air Force.

The Jarrell obituary goes on to state that &quot;after being discharged from the service he joined the faculty of Sarah Lawrence College in Bronxville, N.Y., for a year. During his time in New York, he also served as the temporary book review editor for &quot;The Nation&quot; magazine&quot;. Jarrell was uncomfortable living in the city and &quot;claimed to hate New York&#x27;s crowds, high cost of living, status-conscious sociability, and lack of greenery.&quot; He soon left the city for the Woman&#x27;s College of the University of North Carolina where, as an associate professor of English, he taught modern poetry and &quot;imaginative writing&quot;.

Jarrell divorced his first wife and married Mary von Schrader, a young woman whom he met at a summer writer&#x27;s conference in Colorado, in 1952. They first lived together while Jarrell was teaching for a term at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign. The couple settled at Greensboro with Mary&#x27;s daughters from her previous marriage. The couple also moved temporarily to Washington D.C. in 1956 when Jarrell served as the consultant in poetry at the Library of Congress (a position that later became titled Poet Laureate) for two years, returning to Greensboro and the University of North Carolina after his term ended.

===Depression and death===
Towards the end of his life, in 1963, Stephanie Burt notes: &quot;Randall&#x27;s behavior began to change. Approaching his fiftieth birthday, he seems to have worried deeply about his advancing age. . . After President Kennedy was shot, Randall spent days in front of the television weeping. Sad to the point of inertia, Randall sought help from a Cincinnati psychiatrist, who prescribed [the antidepressant drug] Elavil.&quot; The drug made him manic and in 1965, he was hospitalized and taken off Elavil. At this point, he was no longer manic, but he became depressed again. Burt also states that in April &quot;The New York Times&quot; published a &quot;viciously condescending&quot; review by Joseph Bennett of Jarrell&#x27;s most recent book of poems, &quot;The Lost World&quot;, which said &quot;his work is thoroughly dated; prodigiousness encouraged by an indulgent and sentimental Mama-ism; its overriding feature is doddering infantilism.&quot; Soon afterwards, Jarrell slashed a wrist and returned to the hospital. After leaving the hospital, he stayed at home that summer under his wife&#x27;s care and returned to teaching at the University of North Carolina that fall.

Then, near dusk on October 14, 1965, while walking along U.S. highway 15-501 near Chapel Hill, N.C., where he had gone seeking medical treatment, Jarrell was struck by a motorist and killed. In trying to determine the cause of death, &quot;[Jarrell&#x27;s wife] Mary, the police, the coroner, and ultimately the state of North Carolina judged his death accidental, a verdict made credible by his apparent improvements in health ... and the odd, sidelong manner of the collision; medical professionals judged the injuries consistent with an accident and not with suicide.&quot; Nevertheless, because Jarrell had recently been treated for mental illness and a previous suicide attempt, some of the people closest to him were not entirely convinced that his death was accidental and suspected that he had taken his own life.

In a letter to Elizabeth Bishop about a week after Jarrell&#x27;s death, Robert Lowell wrote, &quot;There&#x27;s a small chance [that Jarrell&#x27;s death] was an accident. . . [but] I think it was suicide, and so does everyone else, who knew him well.&quot; Jarrell&#x27;s death being a suicide has since become accepted practically as fact, even by people who were not personally close to him and perpetuated by some writers. A. Alvarez, in his book &quot;The Savage God&quot;, lists Jarrell as a twentieth-century writer who killed himself, and James Atlas refers to Jarrell&#x27;s &quot;suicide&quot; several times in his biography of Delmore Schwartz. The idea of Jarrell&#x27;s death being a suicide was always denied by his wife.

==Legacy==
On February 28, 1966, a memorial service was held in Jarrell&#x27;s honor at Yale University, and some of the best-known poets in the country attended and spoke at the event, including Robert Lowell, Richard Wilbur, John Berryman, Stanley Kunitz, and Robert Penn Warren. Reporting on the memorial service, &quot;The New York Times&quot; quoted Lowell who said that Jarrell was &quot;&#x27;the most heartbreaking poet of our time&#x27;. . . [and] had written &#x27;the best poetry in English about the Second World War.&#x27;&quot; These memorial tributes formed the basis for the book &quot;Randall Jarrell 1914-1965&quot; which Farrar, Straus and Giroux published the following year.

In 2004, the Metropolitan Nashville Historical Commission approved placement of a historical marker in his honor, to be placed at his alma mater, Hume-Fogg High School. A North Carolina Highway Historical Marker was placed near his burial site in Greensboro, North Carolina.

==Writing==

===Poetry===
In terms of the subject matter of Jarrell&#x27;s work, the scholar Stephanie Burt observed, &quot;Randall Jarrell&#x27;s best-known poems are poems about the Second World War, poems about bookish children and childhood, and poems, such as &#x27;Next Day,&#x27; in the voices of aging women.&quot; Burt also succinctly summarizes the essence of Jarrell&#x27;s poetic style as follows: Jarrell&#x27;s stylistic particularities have been hard for critics to hear and describe, both because the poems call readers&#x27; attention instead to their characters and because Jarrell&#x27;s particular powers emerge so often from mimesis of speech. Jarrell&#x27;s style responds to the alienations it delineates by incorporating or troping speech and conversation, linking emotional events within one person&#x27;s psyche to speech acts that might take place between persons. . .Jarrell&#x27;s style pivots on his sense of loneliness and on the intersubjectivity he sought as a response.

Jarrell was first published in 1940 in &quot;5 Young Poets&quot;, which also included work by John Berryman. His first separate collection of poetry, &quot;Blood for a Stranger&quot;, which was heavily influenced by W.H. Auden, was published in 1942 – the same year he enlisted in the United States Army Air Corps. His second and third books, &quot;Little Friend, Little Friend&quot; (1945) and &quot;Losses&quot; (1948), drew heavily on his Army experiences. The short lyric &quot;The Death of the Ball Turret Gunner&quot; is Jarrell&#x27;s most famous war poem and one that is frequently anthologized.

His reputation as a poet was not firmly established until 1960 when his National Book Award-winning
collection &quot;The Woman at the Washington Zoo&quot; was published. Beginning with this book, Jarrell broke free of Auden&#x27;s influence and the influence of the New Critics and developed a style that mixed Modernist and Romantic influences, incorporating the aesthetics of William Wordsworth in order to create more sympathetic character sketches and dramatic monologues. The scholar Stephanie Burt notes, &quot;Jarrell took from Wordsworth the idea that poems had to be &#x27;convincing as speech&#x27; before they were anything else.&quot; His final volume, &quot;The Lost World&quot;, published in 1965, continued in the same style and cemented Jarrell&#x27;s reputation as a poet; many critics consider it to be his best work. Stephanie Burt states that &quot;in the &#x27;Lost World&#x27; poems and throughout Jarrell&#x27;s oeuvre. . .he took care to define and defend the self [and]. . .his lonely personae seek intersubjective confirmation and . . .his alienated characters resist the so-called social world.&quot; Burt identifies the chief influences on Jarrell&#x27;s poetry to be &quot;Proust, Wordsworth, Rilke, Freud, and the poets and thinkers of Jarrell&#x27;s era [particularly his close friend, Hannah Arendt].&quot;

===Criticism===
From the start of his writing career, Jarrell earned a solid reputation as an influential poetry critic. Encouraged by Edmund Wilson, who published Jarrell&#x27;s criticism in &quot;The New Republic&quot;, Jarrell developed his style of critique which was often witty and sometimes fiercely critical. However, as he got older, his criticism began to change, showing a more positive emphasis. His appreciations of Robert Lowell, Elizabeth Bishop, and William Carlos Williams helped to establish or resuscitate their reputations as significant American poets, and his poet friends often returned the favor, as when Lowell wrote a review of Jarrell&#x27;s book of poems &quot;The Seven League Crutches&quot; in 1951. Lowell wrote that Jarrell was &quot;the most talented poet under forty, and one whose wit, pathos, and grace remind us more of Pope or Matthew Arnold than of any of his contemporaries.&quot; In the same review, Lowell calls Jarrell&#x27;s first book of poems, &quot;Blood for a Stranger&quot;, &quot;a tour-de-force in the manner of Auden.&quot; And in another book review for Jarrell&#x27;s &quot;Selected Poems&quot;, a few years later, fellow-poet Karl Shapiro compared Jarrell to &quot;the great modern Rainer Maria Rilke&quot; and stated that the book &quot;should certainly influence our poetry for the better. It should become a point of reference, not only for younger poets, but for all readers of twentieth-century poetry.&quot;

Jarrell is known for his essays on Robert Frost — whose poetry was a large influence on Jarrell&#x27;s own — Walt Whitman, Marianne Moore, Wallace Stevens, and others, which were mostly collected in &quot;Poetry and the Age&quot; (1953). Many scholars consider him the most astute poetry critic of his generation, and in 1979, the poet and scholar Peter Levi went so far as to advise younger writers, &quot;Take more notice of Randall Jarrell than you do of any academic critic.&quot;

In an introduction to a selection of Jarrell&#x27;s essays, the poet Brad Leithauser wrote the following assessment of Jarrell as a critic:[Jarrell&#x27;s] multiple and eclectic virtues —originality, erudition, wit, probity, and an irresistible passion —combined to make him the best American poet-critic since Eliot. Or one could call him, after granting Eliot the English citizenship he so actively embraced, the best poet-critic we have ever had. Whichever side of the Atlantic one chooses to place Eliot, Jarrell was his superior in at least one significant respect. He captured a world that any contemporary poet will recognize as &quot;the poetry scene&quot;; his &quot;Poetry and the Age&quot; might even now be retitled &quot;Poetry and Our Age&quot;.

===Fiction, translations, and children&#x27;s books===
In addition to poetry and criticism, Jarrell also published a satirical novel, &quot;Pictures from an Institution&quot;, in 1954, drawing upon his teaching experiences at Sarah Lawrence College, which served as the model for the fictional Benton College. He also wrote several children&#x27;s books, among which &quot;The Bat-Poet&quot; (1964) and &quot;The Animal Family&quot; (1965) are considered prominent (and feature illustrations by Maurice Sendak). In 1957 Jarrell began his translation of Goethe‘s Faust Part One for Farrar, Straus and Giroux. It was published in 1976. Jarrell translated poems by Rainer Maria Rilke and others, a play by Anton Chekhov, and several Grimm fairy tales.

<doc id="773042" wikidata="Q1960724" url="?curid=773042" title="Hans Järta">
<text>Hans Järta (originally Hans Hierta) (11 February 1774 – 6 April 1847) was a Swedish administrator, revolutionary and philosopher. He helped overthrow Gustavus IV Adolphus in the Coup of 1809 and was one of the main drafters of the 1809 constitution of Sweden. From 1812 to 1822 he was County Governor of Kopparberg County. His liberal-conservative philosophy has given him the nickname &quot;Sweden&#x27;s Edmund Burke&quot;.

==Early life==
Hans Hierta was born at Näs kungsgård, Husby, in the province of Dalecarlia. His parents, who belonged to the Swedish nobility, the Hierta family, were Lieutenant general Carl Hierta and Maria Charlotta von Plomgren. In 1778, Carl Hierta ran into financial trouble, left active military service and moved with his household to Lagmansholm in Västergötland; Hans was sent to live with his father&#x27;s friend Johan Beck-Friis who was the County Governor of Dalecarlia, and who became Hans Hierta&#x27;s foster father. In 1783, at the age of nine, Hierta was enrolled in a school in Falun. He did not attend secondary school but began his university studies at Uppsala university in 1787. He studied theology (a mandatory subject at the time), history, and languages, and graduated in 1791.

==Career==
After graduating from university, Hierta started working as a minor official for the royal administration. He was present at the masked ball in 1792 where King Gustav III was assassinated, and in the aftermath of the murder he was questioned but never accused of being part of the conspiracy against the king. He did, however, have a cautiously positive attitude to a more democratic form of government, and in 1800, he renounced his noble rank. In August 1800, Gustavus IV Adolphus rescinded Hierta&#x27;s right to a noble name and arms, and he changed the spelling of his last name to Järta.

In 1828, he was elected a member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences.

First light for the telescopes was on September 15, 2000 for the Baade, and September 7, 2002 for the Clay. A consortium consisting of the Carnegie Institution for Science, University of Arizona, Harvard University, the University of Michigan and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology built and operate the twin telescopes. The telescopes were named after the sixteenth-century Portuguese explorer Ferdinand Magellan.

The Giant Magellan Telescope (GMT) is an extremely large telescope under construction, as part of the US Extremely Large Telescope Program.

== Current instruments on the Magellan Telescopes ==
Baade telescope: 
* Inamori Magellan Areal Camera and Spectrograph (IMACS)
* FourStar
* Folded port InfraRed Echellette (FIRE)
* Magellan Echellete (MagE)
Clay telescope: 
* Magellan Inamori Kyocera Echelle (MIKE) spectrograph
* Low-Dispersion Survey Spectrograph-3 (LDSS-3)
* Megacam imager
* MagAO-X
* Michigan/Magellan Fiber System (M2FS)

== Magellan Planet Search Program ==

This program is a survey of stars searching for planets using the MIKE echelle spectrograph mounted on the 6.5 m Magellan II (Clay) telescope.

== MagAO Adaptive Optics System ==
In 2013, Clay (Magellan II) was equipped with an adaptive secondary mirror called MagAO which allowed it to take the sharpest visible-light images to date, capable of resolving objects 0.02 arcseconds across—equivalent to a dime (1.8 cm) seen from away.

MagAO was originally intended for the Large Binocular Telescope (LBT), but the secondary mirror was damaged before it could be installed. The project leader Laird Close and his team were able to repair and repurpose the broken mirror for use on Magellan II. As built for the LBT, the original MagAO mirror had a diameter of . However, the edge of the mirror was broken. Technicians at Steward Observatory were able to cut the mirror to in diameter, thereby removing the broken edge.

<text>The Tualatin Valley is a farming and suburban region southwest of Portland, Oregon. The valley is formed by the meandering Tualatin River, a tributary of the Willamette River at the northwest corner of the Willamette Valley, east of the Northern Oregon Coast Range. Most of the valley is located within Washington County, separated from Portland by the Tualatin Mountains. Communities in the Tualatin Valley include Banks, Forest Grove, Cornelius, Hillsboro, Aloha, Beaverton, Sherwood, Tigard, and Tualatin.

== History ==
In the early 19th century, the valley was inhabited by the Atfalati, a hunter-gatherer Kalapuyan band that spoke a dialect of Northern Kalapuyan. In the middle 19th century, the Atfalati lived in several villages in the valley, including Chakeipi (&quot;Place of the Beaver&quot;, translated by early white settlers as &quot;Beaver Dam&quot;). Early Euro-American settlers called the valley the &quot;Twality Plains&quot;, a corruption of the name of the Atfalati tribe. Other early variations included Falatin, Nefalatine, Twalaity, and Quality, with each roughly translated as slow river to describe the Tualatin River, or may translate as land without trees.

The valley was one of the earliest settled farming regions in Oregon, as settlers began arriving in 1840. In the spring of 1847, Lawrence Hall filed the first land claim, comprising 640 acres (2.6 km2), at Beaver Dam (later Beaverton) and constructed the first grist mill in the valley. In 1849 Thomas Hicklin Denney and his wife Berrilla built the first sawmill in the Beaverton area, leading to a later boom in the timber industry.

The lack of roads connecting the upper valley to the Willamette River quickly became a hindrance to early settlers. In 1850, the Oregon Territory created the Portland &amp; Valley Plank Road Company to build a road through the Tualatin Hills connecting Portland with Beaverton. The road was completed in 1860 after financial setbacks. According to Oregon historian Stewart Holbrook, the building of the plank road was the decisive event that allowed Portland to surpass its rival Oregon City for supremacy as the economic hub of the territory. The railroad was extended into the valley in 1868.

The growth of agriculture in the valley was eventually limited in the middle 20th century by the need for irrigation. In 1966, the United States Bureau of Reclamation built the Tualatin Project, bringing additional water to many parts of the valley in the last federal reclamation project in the Pacific Northwest.

In the second half of the 20th century the valley became increasingly suburbanized and now forms a distinct cultural area that rivals Portland itself in political and economic influence. The communities along the Tualatin Valley Highway (the descendant of the old plank road), form a suburban corridor stretching west of Beaverton. Beaverton is famous as the location of the Nike, Inc. campus, the company&#x27;s world-wide headquarters. Nike, along with Intel in Hillsboro, provide a large base of employment in the valley. Much of the valley is now within the Portland urban growth boundary, resulting in a suburban growth patterns that interspersed with remaining areas of orchards and farm fields. Most of the communities in the valley are served by TriMet, the Portland-area mass transit agency. In 1998, the MAX Light Rail system was extended from Portland into the valley as far as Hillsboro.

Tualatin Valley sits at the northwestern edge of the Willamette Valley, known for its production of wine, especially Pinot noir. Established in 1970 in Tualatin Valley, Ponzi Vineyards was among the first Oregon wineries to produce estate-grown Pinot Noir. Its 130 acres of family-owned vineyards are LIVE Certified Sustainable and it is one of the largest wineries in Oregon. As of June 3, 2020, Ponzi Vineyards is located within the Laurelwood District AVA which was approved by the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau (TTB). The Tualatin Hills AVA was also approved at the same time in 2020. The two AVAs share a small portion of their boundaries and contain among the highest concentrations of Laurelwood soils in the state. 

==Geography==
The valley is traversed by the Tualatin River and is bordered on the north and east by the Tualatin Mountains, a spur of the Northern Oregon Coast Range. The latter range also comprises the valley&#x27;s western border. To the south lie the Chehalem Mountains, separating the region from the main Willamette Valley. The Tualatin River flows mainly from the west to the east and leaves the valley in the southeast at West Linn in Clackamas County. Tualatin Valley&#x27;s geographical center is located southeast of Hillsboro, and the general elevation of the valley is above sea-level.

<doc id="773051" wikidata="Q836327" url="?curid=773051" title="A Kindred Spirit">
<text>A Kindred Spirit () is a television drama series that was broadcast on TVB Jade in Hong Kong from 15 May 1995 to 13 November 1999. It is one of the longest running drama shows in Hong Kong television history (the longest being the sitcom Hong Kong 81 series). Its exceptional longevity is unusual for a city where scripted TV drama programs typically only last around 20 episodes. The total number of episodes is 1,128. One episode were aired per day, on Monday to Friday.

The show centres on a family who operates a barbecue pork (char siu) restaurant in Happy Valley, Hong Kong, and their life.

==Cast==
As the show progressed, more and more new characters were added into the show, as in a soap opera. The show finally ended on 13 November 1999 with a lavish farewell that included all the actors who participated in the show from past to present.

===Main cast===
==Impact on Hong Kong culture==
The show&#x27;s impact on Hong Kong culture is immense, although its influence is fading away as new series are being aired. Everyone can remember the approximate arc of the story and most can sing the theme song.

The impact of the show on its cast is enormous, some actors have suffered a form of &quot;curse&quot; from the series, being that they can never break out of their mold that were set during this series. A good example is the actor, Timothy Cheng, who played Ji Ho in the series. His performance on the series was so convincing and memorable that it has prevented him from playing heroes or protagonists since his run on the show ended (though he did play some protagonist roles recently).

Kindred Spirit is shown in Hong Kong on TVB&#x27;s Grand Theatre Channel, which belongs to TVB&#x27;s new pay television services. The show aired in Canada via Fairchild TV.

The show was previously on rerun on Thursday, 13 September 2007 from Monday to Friday at 2:15pm on TVB Jade in Hong Kong. It currently airing from Monday to Friday at 10:00am on TVB Jade.

<doc id="773078" wikidata="Q573532" url="?curid=773078" title="Anthony Lewis">
<text>Joseph Anthony Lewis (March 27, 1927 – March 25, 2013) was an American public intellectual and journalist. He was a two-time winner of the Pulitzer Prize and was a columnist for &quot;The New York Times&quot;. He is credited with creating the field of legal journalism in the United States.

Early in Lewis&#x27; career as a legal journalist, Supreme Court Justice Felix Frankfurter told an editor of &quot;The New York Times&quot;: &quot;I can&#x27;t believe what this young man achieved. There are not two justices of this court who have such a grasp of these cases.&quot; At his death, Nicholas B. Lemann, the dean of Columbia University School of Journalism, said: &quot;At a liberal moment in American history, he was one of the defining liberal voices.&quot;

==Early life==
Lewis was born Joseph Anthony Lewis in New York City on March 27, 1927, to Kassel Lewis, who worked in textiles manufacturing, and Sylvia Surut, who became director of the nursery school at the 92nd Street Y. He and his family were Jewish. He attended the Horace Mann School in the Bronx, where he was a classmate of Roy Cohn, and graduated from Harvard College in 1948. While at Harvard, he was managing editor of &quot;The Harvard Crimson&quot;.

==Career in journalism==
Following his college graduation, Lewis worked for &quot;The New York Times&quot;. He left in 1952 to work for the Democratic National Committee on Adlai Stevenson&#x27;s presidential campaign. He returned to journalism at &quot;The Washington Daily News&quot;, an afternoon tabloid. He wrote a series of articles on the case of Abraham Chasanow, a civilian employee of the U.S. Navy, who had been dismissed from his job on the basis of allegations by anonymous informers that he associated with anti-American subversives. The series won Lewis a Pulitzer Prize for National Reporting in 1955.

Lewis returned to &quot;The New York Times&quot; that year as its Washington bureau chief. He was assigned to cover the Justice Department and the Supreme Court. In 1956–57 he was a Nieman Fellow at Harvard Law School. He won a second Pulitzer Prize in 1963, again in the category National Reporting, for his coverage of the U.S. Supreme Court. The citation singled out his coverage of the court&#x27;s reasoning in &quot;Baker v. Carr&quot;, a Supreme Court decision which held that federal courts could exercise authority over legislative redistricting on the part of the states, and the decision&#x27;s impact on specific states.

In his 1969 history of &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Gay Talese described Lewis in his Washington years as &quot;cool, lean, well-scrubbed looking, intense and brilliant&quot;. Lewis became a member of Senator Robert F. Kennedy&#x27;s social circle, too conspicuously so in the opinion of Max Frankel, another of the paper&#x27;s editors.

During a four-month newspaper strike (November 1962 to February 1963), Lewis wrote &quot;Gideon&#x27;s Trumpet&quot;, the story of Clarence Earl Gideon, the plaintiff in &quot;Gideon v. Wainwright&quot;, the 1963 case in which the Supreme Court held that states were required to provide counsel for indigent defendants charged with serious crimes. At Lewis&#x27; death it had not been out of print since it was first published. It won the 1965 Edgar Award for Best Fact Crime and in 1980 was adapted as a movie for television and presented by Hallmark Hall of Fame. Lewis played a small role in the film.

Lewis published a second book in 1964, &quot;Portrait of a Decade: The Second American Revolution&quot;, about the civil rights movement. In 1991, Mr. Lewis published &quot;Make No Law&quot;, an account of &quot;The New York Times v. Sullivan&quot;, the 1964 Supreme Court decision that revolutionized American libel law. In &quot;Sullivan&quot;, the court held that public officials suing critics of their official conduct needed to prove that the contested statement(s) were made with &quot;actual malice&quot;, that is, with knowledge that it was false or with &quot;reckless disregard&quot; of whether it was true or not.

The &quot;Times&quot; moved Lewis to London in 1964, where he was bureau chief with responsibility for broad coverage of politics, culture and, in the words of one editor, &quot;ballet, music, Glyndebourne, la-di-da London society, diplomacy, the British character, you name it&quot;. He moved to New York in 1969 and began writing a twice-weekly opinion column for the &quot;Times&quot;. He continued to write these pieces, which appeared under the heading &quot;At Home Abroad&quot; or &quot;Abroad at Home&quot; depending on his byline, until retiring in 2001. Though wide-ranging in his interests, he often focused on legal questions, advocacy of compromise between Israel and the Palestinians, and criticism of the war in Vietnam and the apartheid regime in South Africa. On December 15, 2001, his final column warned that civil liberties were at risk in the U.S. reaction to the September 11 attacks.

Reflecting on his years as a columnist, he said he had learned two lessons:
When told Henry Kissinger had once described him as &quot;always wrong&quot;, Lewis replied: &quot;Probably because I wrote in a very uncomplimentary way about him. I didn’t like him. He did things that were very damaging to human beings.&quot;

==Other activities==
Beginning in the mid-1970s, Lewis taught a course in First Amendment and the Supreme Court at Columbia University&#x27;s Graduate School of Journalism for 23 years. He held the school&#x27;s James Madison chair in First Amendment Issues from 1982. He lectured at Harvard from 1974 to 1989 and was a visiting lecturer at several other colleges and universities, including the universities of Arizona, California, Illinois, and Oregon.

In 1983, Lewis received the Elijah Parish Lovejoy Award as well as an honorary Doctor of Laws degree from Colby College. On January 8, 2001, he received the Presidential Citizens Medal from President Bill Clinton. On October 21, 2008, the National Coalition Against Censorship honored him for his work in the area of First Amendment rights and free expression.

He served for decades as a member of the &quot;Harvard Crimson&quot;&#x27;s graduate board and as one of its trustees. He was a key player in the fundraising and reconstruction of the paper&#x27;s Plympton Street building.

Lewis was elected to the American Philosophical Society in 2005.

He served on the board of directors of the Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) and its policy committee. CPJ awarded him its Burton Benjamin Award for lifetime achievement in 2009.

He was chosen Class Day speaker at Harvard in 1997.

He was a member of the Whitney R. Harris World Law Institute&#x27;s International Council.

==Views on the press==
Lewis read the First Amendment as a restriction on the ability of the federal government to regulate speech, but opposed attempts to broaden its meaning to create special protection for journalists. He approved when a federal court in 2005 jailed Judith Miller, a &quot;New York Times&quot; reporter, for refusing to name her confidential sources as a special prosecutor demanded she do. Max Frankel, another &quot;Times&quot; editor said: &quot;In his later years he turned a little bit against the press, which he loved. But he disagreed with those of us who felt that we couldn&#x27;t just trust the courts to defend our freedom&quot;.

Lewis also opposed journalists&#x27; advocacy of a federal &quot;shield law&quot; to allow journalists to refuse to reveal their sources. He cited the case of Wen Ho Lee, whose privacy was, in Lewis&#x27; view, violated by newspapers who published leaked information and then refused to identify the sources of those leaks, preferring to agree to a financial settlement. He noted that the newspapers said they were acting to &quot;protect our journalists from further sanctions&quot;, thus privileging their own needs over the damage caused the victim of the false information they printed.

==Personal life==
On July 8, 1951, Lewis married Linda J. Rannells, &quot;a tall, blithe student of modern dance&quot; according to Gay Talese. They had three children and divorced in 1982.

Lewis relocated from New York to Cambridge while he was a &quot;New York Times&quot; columnist. There, in 1984, he married Margaret H. Marshall, an attorney in private practice who later became General Counsel at Harvard University and Chief Justice of the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts.

Lewis and his wife were longtime residents of Cambridge, Massachusetts.

Lewis died on March 25, 2013, from renal and heart failure, two days shy of his 86th birthday. He had been diagnosed with Parkinson&#x27;s disease a few years earlier.

<text>Ali Javan (); December 26, 1926 – September 12, 2016) was an Iranian American physicist and inventor. He was the first to propose the concept of the gas laser in 1959 at the Bell Telephone Laboratories. A successful prototype, constructed by him in collaboration with W. R. Bennett, Jr., and D. R. Herriott, was demonstrated in 1960. His other contributions to science have been in the fields of quantum physics and spectroscopy.

==Life and career==
Ali Javan was born in Tehran to Iranian Azerbaijani parents from Tabriz. He attended a school conducted by Zoroastrians. He graduated from Alborz High School, and started his university studies at the School of Science at the University of Tehran for a year. During a visit to New York in 1948, he attended several graduate courses at Columbia University. He received his Ph.D. in 1954 under his thesis advisor Charles Townes without having received a bachelor&#x27;s or master&#x27;s degree. In 1955, Javan held a position as a Post Doctoral in the Radiation Laboratory and worked with Townes on the atomic clock research, and used the microwave atom beam spectrometer to study the hyperfine structure of atoms like copper and thallium.

In 1957, he published a paper on the theory of a three-level maser, and his discovery of the stimulated Raman effect showed that a Stokes-shifted Raman transition can produce amplification without requiring a population inversion. The effect was the precursor of a class of effects known as Lasers Without Inversion, or the LWI effect. He joined Bell Telephone Laboratories in 1958 shortly after he conceived the working principle of his gas discharge Helium Neon laser, and subsequently submitted his paper for publication which was reviewed by Samuel Goudsmit in 1960.

Javan&#x27;s gas laser was the first continuously operating laser. It operated with a very low energy input of about 25 watts or 50 watts in the first model, compared to thousands of watts required for the ruby lasers to produce short bursts. The output laser power was ~ 1 milliwatt. In addition, the ruby laser is greatly surpassed in the narrowness of its output of wavelengths by the gas laser. Its beam of infrared light was slightly less than half an inch wide and spread no more than a foot over a distance of a mile. Just one day after its realization, the laser was used to transmit a telephone call. Javan later described the moment: &quot;I put in a call to the lab. One of the team members answered and asked me to hold the line for a moment. Then I heard a voice [Mr. Balik], somewhat quivering in transmission, telling me that it was the laser light speaking to me.&quot;

In 1966, Ali Javan and Theodore Maiman split a cash award presented to them by President Johnson honoring their work. In 1971, he became the director of Symposium on Laser Physics, which was held on the campus of University of Isfahan.

Javan carried out the first demonstration of optical heterodyne beats with lasers in 1961. Another major experiment was his observation of the detuning dip called the Lamb dip while scanning the frequency of a single-mode laser across the Doppler-broadened gain profile. Ali Javan and his colleagues pioneered in stabilizing laser frequencies with techniques utilizing the Lamb dip. In 1964, Javan and Townes devised experiments using lasers to test special relativity including a variant of the Michelson-Morley ether drift experiment to study the anisotropy of space. Javan&#x27;s group repeated the Michelson-Morley experiment with a new order of accuracy by turning their lasers in different directions with respect to the earth&#x27;s motion. Any change in the velocity of light would show up as a change in the frequency of the output beam. The apparatus used was sensitive enough to detect a change as small as 0.03 millimeter per second (compared to the accuracy of 150 millimeters per second attained by Albert A. Michelson).

At MIT in the early 1960s, Ali Javan started a research project aimed at extending microwave frequency-measuring techniques into the infrared. He introduced the concept of an optical antenna of several wavelengths long which enables the near-complete confinement of an incident optical field coupled to it, and forming the antenna in nanoscale. For the first time an antenna was used to receive light and to transmit it to an infinitesimal receiving structure at its tip, observable only with an electron microscope. The antenna responded to infrared laser light and generated current vibrating at the frequencies of the incident beams. According to John L. Hall, during the 1962 American Physical Society meeting, Javan played a recording of the actual audio beat frequency between two of his lasers when they were tuned almost to the same optical frequency. Using this method Javan developed the first absolutely accurate measurement of the speed of light.

Javan first worked at Massachusetts Institute of Technology as an associate professor of physics in 1961 and has remained Francis Wright Davis Professor Emeritus of physics since 1964. He continued researching into the area of &quot;optical electronics&quot;, which envisions scaling electronic elements in such a way that they would be capable of handling frequencies as high as visible optical radiation frequencies.

Javan died on September 12, 2016. He is survived by his wife, Marjorie, and by their two daughters, Lila and Maia.

<doc id="773089" wikidata="Q2566505" url="?curid=773089" title="Father of the Bride (1991 film)">
<text>Father of the Bride is a 1991 American romantic comedy film starring Steve Martin, Diane Keaton, Kimberly Williams (in her film debut), Kieran Culkin, and Martin Short. It is a remake of the 1950 film of the same name. Martin portrays George Banks, a businessman who becomes flustered while he and his family prepare for his daughter&#x27;s marriage.

The film opened to positive reviews, and became a box office success. With its success, a sequel, &quot;Father of the Bride Part II&quot;, was released in 1995. This was Nancy Meyers and Keaton&#x27;s second of five films together, the first being &quot;Baby Boom&quot; (1987); the others were &quot;Father of the Bride Part II&quot;, &quot;Something&#x27;s Gotta Give&quot; (2003) and &quot;Father of the Bride Part 3(ish)&quot; (2020).

==Plot==
The film begins with George Banks sitting in his house right after the wedding reception of his 22-year old daughter, Annie. George then recalls the events that lead up to Annie’s wedding. George lives in San Marino, California with his wife, Nina, and their much younger son, Matty, and is the owner of a successful athletic shoe company called Side Kicks. Annie, freshly graduated from college, returns home from Europe and announces that she is engaged to Bryan MacKenzie, despite them only having known each other for three months. The sudden shock turns the warm reunion into a heated argument between her and George, but they quickly reconcile in time for Bryan to arrive and meet them. Despite his good financial status and likable demeanor, George takes an immediate dislike to him, while Nina accepts him as a potential son-in-law. George does not want to let go of Annie.

George and Nina meet Bryan&#x27;s parents, John and Joanna MacKenzie, who are wealthy and live in a mansion in Bel Air. John reassures George by also expressing how shocked he had initially been at Bryan&#x27;s engagement and the two couples find they get along well, but George quickly gets into trouble when he begins nosing around the MacKenzies&#x27; financial records. He eventually ends up falling into their pool when cornered by their aggressive pet Dobermans.

All is forgiven, however, and the Banks family meets with an eccentric European wedding coordinator named Franck Eggelhoffer. He sneers dismissively at George&#x27;s complaints about the price of wedding items, and George becomes frustrated as Annie and Nina plan for extravagant items such as a flock of swans and alterations to the family home, where the reception is to be held.

When George discovers that the wedding as planned will cost $250 a head, he insists on cutting down the guest list, but soon discovers his complaints are taking away from Annie&#x27;s happiness and decides to go with the flow. This only lasts so long, though, and he finally snaps when he damages his old tuxedo. He leaves the house to cool off, but ends up causing a disturbance at the supermarket and is arrested. Nina arrives to bail him out of jail on the condition that he stop ruining the wedding.

With help from Nina and Franck, George becomes more relaxed and accepts that the wedding will be expensive. Annie suddenly calls it off after an argument with Bryan over a gift he gave her – a blender, which she took to mean he expects her to be a compliant housewife. George takes Bryan out for a drink intending to be rid of him, but seeing how despondent he is at the thought of losing Annie, consoles him and convinces him to reconcile with her.

A freak snowstorm arrives the night before the wedding, but Franck and George manage to pull everything together at the last minute. Annie marries Bryan wearing sneakers made by George&#x27;s company, and George walks her down the aisle, finally accepting that she has grown up. The reception at the Banks family home goes well thanks to George managing several crises behind the scenes, but as a result, he misses most of it and is unable to say goodbye to Annie before she and Bryan leave for their honeymoon in Hawaii. 

The film picks up George&#x27;s narration from the beginning as the reception ends. Annie calls him from the airport to thank him and tell him that she loves him one last time before they board the plane. With the house now empty and the wedding finished, George finds solace with Nina and dances with her.

==Cast==
==Production==
The remake rights were acquired by Disney from Turner Entertainment. Touchstone Pictures tapped the studio&#x27;s finance partner, Touchwood Pacific Partners, to fund the production of the film. It was Steve Martin, a fan of their previous film &quot;Baby Boom&quot; (1987), who brought director Charles Shyer and his wife Nancy Meyers on bord. According to Shyer, Martin already had a screenplay that he &quot;didn’t love&quot; and Shyer found &quot;awful.&quot; The couple significantly rewrote the screenplay with Martin and Diane Keaton in their mind.

===Music===
The film&#x27;s soundtrack, released by Varèse Sarabande on December 12, 1991 in the United States, was composed, conducted and produced by Alan Silvestri and was influenced by jazz and Christmas instrumentations. Apart from his original music, &quot;Father of the Bride&quot; also makes use of several pop songs, including &quot;My Girl&quot; by The Temptations, &quot;(Today I Met) The Boy I&#x27;m Going to Marry&quot; by Darlene Love and &quot;Chapel of Love&quot; by The Dixie Cups.

====Track listing====
==Reception==
===Box office===
In the United States, &quot;Father of the Bride&quot; came in second to &quot;Hook&quot; at the box office during its first week, earning $15 million. It grossed $89.3 million in the United States and Canada and $40 million internationally, for a worldwide gross of $129 million.

===Critical response===
Rotten Tomatoes reported that 70% of critics gave &quot;Father of the Bride&quot; a positive review, based on 44 reviews, with an average rating of 6.00/10. The site&#x27;s critics consensus reads: &quot;While it doesn&#x27;t quite hit the heights of the original, this remake of the 1950 classic is pleasantly enjoyable, thanks in large part to winning performances from Steve Martin and Martin Short.&quot; At Metacritic the film has a weighted average score of 51 out of 100, based on 17 critics, indicating &quot;mixed or average reviews&quot;. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of &quot;A−&quot; on an A+ to F scale.
Roger Ebert of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; gave the film three stars out of four and called it &quot;one of the movies with a lot of smiles and laughter in it, and a good feeling all the way through.&quot; Desson Howe of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; praised Martin for his performance in it, writing that &quot;it is so funny, it&#x27;s almost sublime. The explanation is simple: It&#x27;s all Steve Martin,&quot; while his colleague Hal Hinson called the film &quot;a pleasing, well-crafted, surprisingly satisfying diversion. It&#x27;s eager to entertain and has a quality that&#x27;s genuinely rare these days, a spirit of gentle modesty.&quot; &quot;New York Times&quot; critic Janet Maslin wrote that &quot;the material has been successfully refurbished with new jokes and new attitudes, but the earlier film&#x27;s most memorable moments have been preserved.&quot;

&quot;Variety&quot; noted that the film &quot;bears little resemblance to the original&quot; and &quot;gets by more on physical shtick than verbal sparkle.&quot; The magazine found that &quot;best stuff here comes straight from Martin, such as his frenzied antics in the in-laws’ house or his ridiculous Tom Jones imitation in front of a mirror in a too-tight tuxedo. A radiant Diane Keaton gives him first-rate support.&quot; &quot;Empire&quot;″s Jo Berry found that while &quot;Father of the Bride&quot; was a &quot;pale imitation of the original, &quot;The film does work, but not quite as well as the Hepburn-Tracy classic that it seeks to replace. Mildly amusing.&quot;

Owen Gleiberman, writing for &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;, called the film a &quot;pat, amiable, and rather dawdling farce.&quot; He found that &quot;Shyer works hard to keep things light&quot; on what Gleiberman considered &quot;little more than a domestic screwball sitcom.&quot; &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot;″s Henry Sheehan felt that &quot;the film&#x27;s sole dramatic preoccupations are with broad physical comedy and unrealistically offbeat characterizations; a few moments of nominal pathos are really just structural pauses in the joke series.&quot; Richard Corliss from &quot;Time&quot; magazine wrote: &quot;Neither the ’90s nor the husband-wife team of Nancy Meyers and Charles Shyer can match the original film’s grace or wit. The humor is sometimes gross, often wan.&quot;

===Accolades===
==Remake==
On February 21, 2018, &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; revealed that remakes of several films are in development as exclusive content for The Walt Disney Company&#x27;s streaming service Disney+ with one of those projects named in the announcement as &quot;Father of the Bride&quot;.

On September 24, 2020, Warner Bros. announced their plans for a remake starring a Hispanic family, with the script being penned by Matt Lopez. The HBO Max original film was released on June 16, 2022.

<text>Jacob Koppel Javits ( ; May 18, 1904 – March 7, 1986) was an American lawyer and politician from New York. During his time in politics, he served in both chambers of the United States Congress, a member of the United States House of Representatives from 1947 to 1954 and a member of the United States Senate from 1957 to 1981. A member of the Republican Party, he also served as Attorney General of New York from 1955 to 1957. Generally considered a liberal Republican, he was often at odds with his own party. A supporter of labor unions, the Great Society, and the civil rights movement, he played a key role in the passing of civil rights legislation. An opponent of the Vietnam War, he drafted the War Powers Resolution in 1973.

Born to Jewish parents, Javits was raised in a tenement on the Lower East Side of Manhattan. He graduated from the New York University School of Law and established a law practice in New York City. During World War II, he served in the United States Army&#x27;s Chemical Warfare Department. Outraged by the corruption of Tammany Hall, Javits joined the Republican Party and supported New York Mayor Fiorello H. La Guardia. He was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives in 1946 and served in that body until 1954. In the House, Javits supported President Harry S. Truman&#x27;s Cold War foreign policy and voted to fund the Marshall Plan. He defeated Franklin D. Roosevelt Jr. in the 1954 election for Attorney General of New York, and defeated Democrat Robert F. Wagner Jr. in the 1956 U.S. Senate election.

In the Senate, Javits supported much of President Lyndon B. Johnson&#x27;s Great Society programs and civil rights legislation, including the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965. He voted for the Gulf of Tonkin Resolution but came to question Johnson&#x27;s handling of the War in Vietnam. To rein in presidential war powers, Javits sponsored the War Powers Resolution. Javits also sponsored the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, which regulated defined-benefit private pensions. In 1980, Javits lost the Republican Senate primary to Al D&#x27;Amato, who campaigned to Javits&#x27;s right. Nonetheless, he ran in the general election as the Liberal Party nominee. He and Democratic nominee Elizabeth Holtzman were defeated by D&#x27;Amato. Javits died of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis in West Palm Beach, Florida, in 1986.

==Early life==
Javits was born to Jewish parents, Ida (née Littman) and Morris Javits. Javits grew up in a teeming Lower East Side tenement, and when not in school, he helped his mother sell dry goods from a pushcart in the street and learned parliamentary procedure at University Settlement Society of New York. Javits graduated in 1920 from George Washington High School, where he was president of his class. He worked part-time at various jobs while he attended night school at Columbia University, then in 1923 he enrolled in the New York University Law School from which he earned his LLB in 1926. He was admitted to the bar in June 1927 and joined his brother Benjamin Javits, who was nearly ten years older, as partner to form the Javits and Javits law firm. The Javits brothers specialized in bankruptcy and minority stockholder suits and became quite successful. In 1933, Javits married Marjorie Joan Ringling, daughter related to Alfred Thedore &quot;Alf&quot; Ringling, one of the Ringling brothers of the Ringling Brothers Circus fame. They had no children and divorced in 1936. In 1947, he married Marian Javits with whom he had three children. Deemed too old for regular military service when World War II began, Javits was commissioned in early 1942 as an officer in the United States Army&#x27;s Chemical Warfare Service. Assigned as assistant to the chief of the Chemical Warfare Service, he served in the European and Pacific theaters, and in the United States. Javits attained the rank of lieutenant colonel before he was discharged in 1946, and he was a recipient of the Legion of Merit and Army Commendation Ribbon.

==Political career==
In his youth Javits had watched his father work as a ward heeler for Tammany Hall, and he had experienced firsthand the corruption and graft associated with that notorious political machine. Tammany&#x27;s operations repulsed Javits so much that he forever rejected the city&#x27;s Democratic Party and in the early 1930s joined the Republican-Fusion Party and the New York Young Republican Club, which was supporting the mayoral campaigns of Fiorello H. La Guardia. After the war, he became the chief researcher for Jonah Goldstein&#x27;s unsuccessful 1945 bid for mayor on the Republican-Liberal-Fusion ticket. Javits&#x27;s hard work in the Goldstein campaign showed his potential in the political arena and encouraged the small Manhattan Republican Party to nominate him as their candidate for the Upper West Side&#x27;s Twenty-first Congressional District (since redistricted) seat during the heavily-Republican year of 1946. Although the Republicans had not held the seat since 1923, Javits campaigned energetically and won. He was a member of the freshman class, along with John F. Kennedy of Massachusetts and Richard Nixon of California. He served from 1947 to 1954, when he resigned his seat to take office as Attorney General of New York.

During his first two terms in the House, Javits often sided with the Truman administration. For example, in 1947 he supported Harry S. Truman&#x27;s veto of the Taft-Hartley Act, which he declared to be antiunion. A strong opponent of discrimination, Javits also endorsed legislation against the poll tax in 1947 and 1949, and in 1954, he unsuccessfully sought to have enacted a bill banning racial segregation in federally-funded housing projects. Unhappy with the witch-hunt atmosphere in Washington during the Cold War, he publicly opposed continuing appropriations for the House Un-American Activities Committee in 1948. Always a staunch supporter of Israel, Javits served on the United States House Committee on Foreign Affairs during all four of his terms and supported congressional funding for the Marshall Plan and all components of the Truman Doctrine.

In 1954, Javits ran for Attorney General of New York against a well-known and well-funded opponent, Franklin D. Roosevelt Jr. Javits&#x27;s vote-getting abilities carried the day, and he was the only Republican to win a statewide office that year. As attorney general, Javits continued to promote his liberal agenda by supporting such measures as anti-bias employment legislation and a health insurance program for state employees.

===U.S. Senator===
In 1956, Javits ran for U.S. Senator from New York to succeed the retiring incumbent Democrat Herbert H. Lehman. His Democratic opponent was the popular Mayor of New York, Robert F. Wagner Jr. In the early stages of that campaign Javits vigorously and successfully denied charges that he had once sought support from members of the American Communist Party during his 1946 race for Congress. He went on to defeat Wagner by nearly half a million votes. Although his term began on January 3, 1957, he delayed taking his seat in the U.S. Senate until January 9, the day the New York State Legislature convened, to deny Democratic Governor W. Averell Harriman the opportunity to appoint a Democratic Attorney General. Thus, on January 9, the Republican majority of the State Legislature elected Louis J. Lefkowitz to fill the office for the remainder of Javits&#x27;s term.

Upon taking office, Javits resumed his role as the most outspoken Republican liberal in Congress. For the next 24 years, the Senate was Javits&#x27;s home. His wife had no interest in living in Washington, D.C., which she considered a boring backwater and so for over two decades Javits commuted between New York and Washington nearly every week to visit his &quot;other&quot; family and conduct local political business. In foreign affairs, he backed the Eisenhower Doctrine for the Middle East and pressed for more foreign military and economic assistance. Javits was re-elected in 1962 and 1968.

Javits voted in favor of the Civil Rights Acts of 1957, 1960, 1964, and 1968, as well as the Twenty-fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution, the Voting Rights Act of 1965, and the confirmation of Thurgood Marshall to the Supreme Court of the United States. He endorsed Lyndon B. Johnson&#x27;s Great Society programs. To promote his views on social legislation, he served on the Senate Labor and Human Resources Committee for twenty years, most of that time as the second-ranking minority member. Javits initially backed Johnson during the early years of America&#x27;s involvement in the Vietnam War and supported, for example, the Gulf of Tonkin Resolution in 1964 but later turned against it. Also in 1964, Javits joined David Rockefeller to launch the non-profit International Executive Service Corps, which was established to help bring about prosperity and stability in developing nations through the growth of private enterprise.

During the 1964 Republican Party presidential primaries, Javits, alongside fellow New York Republicans Kenneth Keating, John Lindsay and Seymour Halpern, refused to endorse Barry Goldwater, the conservative senator from Arizona.

A supporter of universal health care, Javits in 1970 drafted a bill called &quot;Medicare for All&quot; that would have expanded the Medicare program to every American citizen by the end of 1973, while also giving the citizen a choice to opt-out, and alongside Clifford P. Case, John Sherman Cooper and William B. Saxbe, was one of four Republican co-sponsors of the Ted Kennedy-Martha Griffiths universal health care bill in January 1971.

In 1966, along with two other Republican senators and five Republican representatives, Javits signed a telegram sent to Georgia Governor Carl Sanders regarding the Georgia legislature&#x27;s refusal to seat the recently elected Julian Bond in their state House of Representatives. The refusal, said the telegram, was &quot;a dangerous attack on representative government. None of us agree with Mr. Bond&#x27;s views on the Vietnam War; in fact we strongly repudiate these views. But unless otherwise determined by a court of law, which the Georgia Legislature is not, he is entitled to express them.&quot;

By the end of 1967, Javits was becoming disenchanted with the Vietnam War and joined 22 other senators in calling for a peaceful solution to the conflict.

In 1965, Javits appointed Lawrence Wallace Bradford Jr. as the Senate&#x27;s first African-American page. In 1971, Javits appointed Paulette Desell as the Senate&#x27;s first female page.

By 1970, his rising opposition to the war led him to support the Cooper–Church Amendment, which barred funds for US troops in Cambodia, and he also voted to repeal the Gulf of Tonkin Resolution. Increasingly concerned about the erosion of congressional authority in foreign affairs, Javits sponsored the War Powers Resolution in 1973, which limited to 60 days a president&#x27;s ability to send American armed forces into combat without congressional approval.

Despite his unhappiness with President Richard Nixon over the Vietnam War, Javits was slow to join the anti-Nixon forces during the Watergate scandal of 1973–1974. Until almost the very end of the affair, his position reflected his legal training: Nixon was innocent until proven guilty, and the best way to determine guilt or innocence was by legal due process. His position was unpopular among his constituency, and his re-election in Watergate-tainted 1974 elections over Ramsey Clark was by fewer than 400,000 votes, a third of his 1968 margin of victory. During his last term, Javits shifted his interests more and more to world affairs, especially the crises in the Middle East. Working with President Jimmy Carter, he journeyed to Israel and Egypt to facilitate the discussions that led to the 1978 Camp David Accords.

====1980 Senate race====

Javits served until 1981; his 1979 diagnosis with ALS (also known as Lou Gehrig&#x27;s Disease) led to a 1980 primary challenge by the comparatively lesser-known Long Island Republican county official Al D&#x27;Amato, who received 323,468 primary votes (55.7 percent) to Javits&#x27;s 257,433 (44.3 percent). Javits&#x27;s loss to D&#x27;Amato stemmed from Javits&#x27;s continuing illness and from his failure to adjust politically to the rightward movement of the Republican Party.

After the primary defeat, Javits ran as the Liberal Party candidate in the general election. His candidacy split the Democratic base vote with U.S. Representative Elizabeth Holtzman of Brooklyn and gave D&#x27;Amato the victory by a plurality of 1%. Javits received 11% of the vote.

==Death==
Javits died of ALS in West Palm Beach, Florida, at age 81 on March 7, 1986. In addition to spouse Marion Ann Borris Javits, he was survived by three children: Joshua, Carla, and Joy. He was predeceased by his brother, who died in 1973. His nephew, Eric M. Javits, was a diplomat who served as the U.S. Representative to the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons and the Conference on Disarmament. He is interred at Linden Hill Jewish Cemetery in Queens, New York.

Javits&#x27; funeral service was conducted at the Central Synagogue in Manhattan. 1400 people attended the funeral. Among them were former President Richard Nixon, Governor Mario Cuomo and former Governor Hugh Carey, Mayor Ed Koch and former Mayor John Lindsay, Attorney General Edwin Meese, former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger, Cardinal John Joseph O&#x27;Connor, Kurt Vonnegut, David Rockefeller, Victor Gotbaum, Douglas Fairbanks Jr. and Arthur Ochs Sulzberger. Other mourners included Senators Al D&#x27;Amato of New York, Gary Hart of Colorado, Nancy Kassebaum of Kansas, Bill Bradley of New Jersey, Lowell Weicker of Connecticut, as well as former U.S. Representative Bella Abzug.

==Legacy==
Throughout his years in Congress, Javits seldom enjoyed favor with his party&#x27;s inner circle. Few pieces of legislation bear his name, yet he was especially proud of his work in creating the National Endowment for the Arts, of his sponsorship of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, which regulated defined-benefit private pensions, and of his leadership in the passage of the 1973 War Powers Resolution. In 1966, he had a 94% rating from the Americans for Democratic Action.

Javits used his office to advance ideas that furthered the policies even of Democratic presidents. In the fall of 1962, he proposed to a group of NATO parliamentarians that multinational corporations jointly create a new kind of investment vehicle to promote private investment throughout Latin America. He intended his idea to complement President John F. Kennedy&#x27;s Alliance for Progress. Two years later, some 50 multinational corporations formed the Adela Investment Company, much as Javits had proposed.

Throughout his career in Congress, first in the House and later in the Senate, Javits was part of a small group of liberal Republicans that was often isolated ideologically from their mainstream Republican colleagues, and he was a staunch supporter of labor unions and civil rights movements. One scoring method found Javits to be the most liberal Republican to serve in either chamber of Congress between 1937 and 2002. From 1973 to 1978, GovTrack ranked Javits as being to the left of noted Democrats like Hubert Humphrey, George McGovern, Edmund Muskie and Gaylord Nelson. Although he frequently differed with the most right-leaning members of the Republican Party, Javits believed that both parties should tolerate diverse opinions, rejecting the idea that they should share only one point of view. Javits also saw himself as being a descendant of the traditional Republicanism of Alexander Hamilton, Henry Clay, Abraham Lincoln and Theodore Roosevelt, all of whom supported a strong federal government.

In an essay published in 1958 in the magazine &quot;Esquire&quot;, Javits predicted the election of the first African-American president by 2000. Javits sponsored the first African-American Senate page in 1965 and the first female page in 1971. His liberalism was such that he tended to receive support from traditionally-Democratic voters, with many Republicans defecting to support the Conservative Party of New York.

Javits played a major role in legislation protecting pensioners, as well as in the passage of the War Powers Act; he led the effort to get the Javits-Wagner-O&#x27;Day Act passed. He reached the position of Ranking Minority Member on the Committee on Foreign Relations while he accrured greater seniority than any New York Senator before or since (). Along with Dwight Eisenhower, he was among the first and most important statesmen in passing legislation promoting the cause of education for gifted individuals, and many know his name from the federal Jacob Javits Grants established for that purpose.

===Honors and commemoration===
Javits received the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 1983.

New York City&#x27;s sprawling Javits Center was named in his honor in 1986, as is a playground at the southwestern edge of Fort Tryon Park. The Jacob K. Javits Federal Building at 26 Federal Plaza in lower Manhattan&#x27;s Civic Center district, as well as a lecture hall on the campus of Stony Brook University on Long Island, are also named after him.

The Jacob K. Javits Gifted and Talented Students Education Act of 1988 was named in honor of Javits for his role in promoting gifted education. The United States Department of Education formerly awarded a number of Javits Fellowships to support graduate students in the humanities and social sciences until 2012. 

The National Institutes of Health awards the Senator Jacob Javits Award in Neuroscience to exceptionally talented researchers in neuroscience who have established themselves with groundbreaking research. A 1983 US Congressional Act established those awards in honor of Senator Javits as a longtime supporter of research into understanding neurological disorders and diseases.

In his memory, New York University established the Jacob K. Javits Visiting Professorship in 2008.

<doc id="773098" wikidata="Q3520347" url="?curid=773098" title="The Columbus Dispatch">
<text>The Columbus Dispatch is a daily newspaper based in Columbus, Ohio. Its first issue was published on July 1, 1871, and it has been the only mainstream daily newspaper in the city since &quot;The Columbus Citizen-Journal&quot; ceased publication in 1985.

As of November 2019, Alan D. Miller is the newspaper&#x27;s interim general manager.

==History==
The paper was founded in June 1871 by a group of 10 printers with 900 in financial capital. The paper published its first issue as &quot;The Daily Dispatch&quot; on July 1, 1871, as a four-page paper which cost 4¢ (¢ in ) per copy. The paper was originally an afternoon paper for the city of Columbus, Ohio, which at the time had a population of 32,000. For its first few years, the paper rented a headquarters on North High Street and Lynn Alley in Columbus. It began with 800 subscribers.

On April 2, 1888, the paper published its first full-page advertisement, for the Columbus Buggy Company. In 1895, the paper moved its headquarters to the northeast corner of Gay and High streets, a larger building on a site which was previously a grocer. On April 10, the paper published a 72-page edition to mark the move. On December 17, 1899, the paper published its first Sunday edition, a 36-page paper which cost 3¢ (¢ in ), and the daily editions were reduced in price to 2¢ (¢ in ). Two years later on March 3, 1901, the paper published its first color comic strips.

The paper, renamed &quot;The Columbus Evening Dispatch&quot;, changed hands several times in its early years. In 1905, it was purchased by brothers Harry Preston Wolfe and Robert Frederick Wolfe, who originally ran a shoe company. It was not the Wolfes&#x27; first entry into journalism; they had purchased the &quot;Ohio State Journal&quot; two years before. The &quot;Dispatch&quot; would remain in the hands of the Wolfe family for 110 years. On December 16, 1906, the paper published its first color ad, for Beggs Store. On April 9, 1907, the &quot;Dispatch&quot; offices were destroyed in a fire, and the building was demolished and rebuilt. In the interlude, the paper ran its offices out of 34/36 North High Street.

The paper&#x27;s editorial staff traditionally has had a conservative slant. Until it endorsed Hillary Clinton over Donald Trump, the paper&#x27;s last endorsement of a Democrat as a Presidential candidate had been for the re-election of Woodrow Wilson in 1916. The &quot;Dispatch&quot; endorsed Democratic gubernatorial candidate Ted Strickland in the 2006 Ohio elections, but endorsed John Kasich, the Republican candidate running against his reelection, in 2010

A competing paper, &quot;The Columbus Citizen-Journal&quot; (known locally as the &quot;C-J&quot;, pronounced &quot;See-Jay&quot;) was beholden to the &quot;Columbus Dispatch&quot; for its printing facilities, and controversy surrounded the C-J&#x27;s demise in 1985.

In a sale announced on June 3, 2015, ownership of the &quot;Dispatch&quot; was transferred to the GateHouse Media subsidiary of New Media Investment Group. With New Media&#x27;s 2019 acquisition of Gannett, GateHouse Media was rebranded as Gannett, the name under which the Dispatch is currently held.

The Dispatch Broadcast Group, comprising WBNS-AM-FM-TV in Columbus and NBC affiliate WTHR (channel 13) in Indianapolis, remained in the hands of the Wolfe family until 2019, when it was sold to Tegna, Inc., which promptly absorbed the firm.

== Sections and features ==

The sections of the &quot;Dispatch&quot; include the Front Section, Nation &amp; World, Metro &amp; State, Business, Sports and Life &amp; Arts. The Food section is included in the Wednesday paper, while Science is published on Sundays. The Weekender section is included in the Thursday paper. A Faith &amp; Values section is included in the Friday paper. Sunday sections include Arts &amp; Leisure, At Home, Insight and comics.

== Magazines ==
&quot;The Columbus Dispatch&quot; also owns the magazines &quot;Columbus Monthly&quot;, &quot;Columbus CEO&quot;, &quot;Columbus Weddings&quot;, &quot;Columbus Monthly Home &amp; Garden&quot;, &quot;Columbus Alive&quot;, and &quot;Columbus Parent&quot;.

<text>Junius Richard Jayewardene (; ; 17 September 1906 – 1 November 1996), commonly referred to by his initials JR, was a Sri Lankan lawyer, public official and statesman who served as Prime Minister of Sri Lanka from 1977 to 1978 and as the second President of Sri Lanka from 1978 to 1989. He was a leader of the nationalist movement in Ceylon (now Sri Lanka) and served in a variety of cabinet positions in the decades following independence. A longtime member of the United National Party, he led the party to a landslide victory in the 1977 parliamentary elections and served as prime minister for half a year before becoming the country&#x27;s first executive president under an amended constitution.

A controversial figure in the history of Sri Lanka, while the open economic system he introduced in 1978 brought the country out of the economic turmoil Sri Lanka was facing as the result of the preceding government&#x27;s closed economic policies, Jayawardene&#x27;s social policies, including his response to the Black July riots of 1983, have been accused of contributing to the beginnings of the Sri Lankan Civil War.

==Early life and marriage==
===Childhood===
Born in Colombo to the prominent Jayewardene family with a strong association with the legal profession, Jayewardene was the eldest of twelve children, of Hon. Justice Eugene Wilfred Jayewardene KC, a prominent lawyer and Agnes Helen Don Philip Wijewardena daughter of Muhandiram Tudugalage Don Philip Wijewardena a wealthy timber merchant. He was known as Dickie within his family. His younger brothers included Hector Wilfred Jayewardene, QC and Rolly Jayewardene, FRCP. His uncles were the Colonel Theodore Jayewardene, Justice Valentine Jayewardene and the media baron D. R. Wijewardena. Raised by an English nanny, he received his primary education at Bishop&#x27;s College, Colombo.

===Education and early career===
Jayewardene gained admission to Royal College, Colombo for his secondary education. There he excelled in sports, played for the college cricket team, debuting in the Royal-Thomian series in 1925; captained the rugby team in 1924 at the annual &quot;Royal-Trinity Encounter&quot; (which later became known as the Bradby Shield Encounter); he was the vice-captain of the football team in 1924; and was a member of the boxing team winning sports colours. He was a Senior Cadet; Captain, Debating Team; editor of the college magazine; first Secretary of the Royal College Social Services League in 1921 and the head prefect in 1925. In later life, he served as president, Board of Control for Cricket in Sri Lanka; President, Sinhalese Sports Club; and Secretary, Royal College Union.

Following the family tradition, Jayewardene entered the University College, Colombo in 1926, pursuing the Advocate&#x27;s course, reading English, Latin, Logic and Economics for two years, after which he entered Ceylon Law College in 1928. He formed the College Union based on that of the Oxford Union with the assistance of S. W. R. D. Bandaranaike who had recently returned to Ceylon. At the Ceylon Law College, he won the Hector Jayewardene Gold Medal and the Walter Pereira Prize in 1929. During this time he worked as his father&#x27;s Private Secretary, while later served as a Puisne Justice of Supreme Court of Ceylon and in July 1929, he joined three others in forming a dining club they called &quot;The Honorable Society of Pushcannons&quot;, which was later renamed as the &quot;Priya Sangamaya&quot;. In 1931, he passed his advocates exams, starting his legal practice in the unofficial bar.

===Marriage===
On 28 February 1935, Jayewardene married the heiress Elina Bandara Rupasinghe, only daughter of Nancy Margaret Suriyabandara and Gilbert Leonard Rupasinghe, a notary public turned successful businessman. Their only child Ravindra &quot;Ravi&quot; Vimal Jayewardene was born the year after. Having originally settled at Jayewardene&#x27;s parents house, Vaijantha, the Jayewardenes moved to their own house Braemar in 1938, where they remained the rest of their lives, when not holidaying at their holiday home in Mirissa.

==Early political career==

Jayewardene was attracted to national politics in his student years and developed strong nationalist views. He converted from Anglicanism to Buddhism and adopted the national dress as his formal attire.

Jayewardene did not practice law for long. In 1943 he gave up his full-time legal practice to become an activist in the Ceylon National Congress (CNC), which provided the organizational platform for Ceylon&#x27;s nationalist movement (the island was officially renamed Sri Lanka in 1972). He became its Joint Secretary with Dudley Senanayake in 1939 and 1940 he was elected to the Colombo Municipal Council from the New Bazaar Ward.

===State Council===
He was elected to the colonial legislature, the State Council in 1943 by winning the Kelaniya by-election following the resignation of incumbent D. B. Jayatilaka. His victory is credited to his use of an anti-Christian campaign against his opponent the nationalist E. W. Perera. During World War II, Jayewardene, along with other nationalists, contacted the Japanese and discussed a rebellion to drive the British from the island. In 1944, Jayewardene moved a motion in the State Council that Sinhala alone should replace English as the official language.

==First finance minister of Ceylon==
After joining the United National Party on its formation in 1946 as a founder member, he was reelected from the Kelaniya electorate in the 1st parliamentary election and was appointed by D. S. Senanayake as the Minister of Finance in the island&#x27;s first Cabinet in 1947. Initiating post-independence reforms, he was instrumental in the establishment of the Central Bank of Ceylon under the guidance of the American economist John Exter. In 1951 Jayewardene was a member of the committee to select a National Anthem for Sri Lanka headed by Sir Edwin Wijeyeratne. The following year he was elected as the President of the Board of Control for Cricket in Ceylon. He played a major role in re-admitting Japan to the world community at the San Francisco Conference. Jayewardene struggled to balance the budget, faced with mounting government expenditures, particularly for rice subsidies. He was re-elected in 1952 parliamentary election and remained as finance minister.

==Minister of agriculture and food==
His 1953 proposal to cut the subsidies on which many poor people depended for survival provoked fierce opposition and the 1953 Hartal campaign and had to be called off. Following the resignation of Prime Minister Dudley Senanayake after the 1953 Hartal, the new Prime Minister Sir John Kotelawala appointed Jayewardene as minister of agriculture and food and leader of the house.

==Defeat and opposition==
Prime Minister Sir John Kotelawala called for early elections in 1956 with confidence that the United National Party would win the election. The 1956 parliamentary election saw the United National Party suffering a crushing defeat at the hands of the socialist and nationalist coalition led by the Sri Lanka Freedom Party headed by S. W. R. D. Bandaranaike. Jayewardene himself lost his parliamentary seat in Kelaniya to R. G. Senanayake, who had contested both his constituency Dambadeniya and Jayewardene&#x27;s constituency of Kelaniya to defeat the latter after he had forced Senanayake out of the party.

Having lost his seat in parliament, Jayewardene pushed the party to accommodate nationalism and endorse the Sinhala Only Act, which was bitterly opposed by the island&#x27;s minorities. When Bandaranaike agreed with S.J.V. Chelvanayagam in 1957, to solve the outstanding problems of the minorities, Jayawardene led a &quot;March on Kandy&quot; against it, but was stopped at Imbulgoda S. D. Bandaranayake. The U.N.P.&#x27;s official organ the &quot;Siyarata&quot; subsequently ran several anti-Tamil articles, including a poem, containing an exhortation to kill Tamils in almost every line.
Throughout the 1960s Jayewardene clashed over this issue with party leader Dudley Senanayake. Jayewardene felt the UNP should be willing to play the ethnic card, even if it meant losing the support of ethnic minorities.

==Minister of finance==
Jayewardene became the vice-president and chief organizer of the United National Party, which achieved a narrow win in the March 1960 parliamentary election, forming a government under Dudley Senanayake. Jayewardene having been elected to parliament once again from the Kelaniya electorate was appointed once again as minister of finance. The government lasted only three months and lost the July 1960 parliamentary election to a new coalition led by Bandaranayake&#x27;s widow. Jayewardene remained in parliament in the opposition having been elected from the Colombo South electorate.

==Minister of state==
The United National Party won the next election in 1965 and formed a national government with the Sri Lanka Freedom Socialist Party led by C. P. de Silva. Jayewardene was reelected from the Colombo South electorate uncontested and was appointed Chief Government Whip. Senanayake appointed Jayewardene to his cabinet as Minister of State and Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Defence and External Affairs thereby becoming the &quot;de facto&quot; deputy prime minister. No government had given serious thought to the development of the tourism industry as an economically viable venture until the United National Party came to power in 1965 and the subject came under the purview of J. R. Jayewardene. Jayewardene saw tourism as a great industry capable of earning foreign exchange, providing avenues of mass employment, and creating a workforce which commanded high employment potential globally. He was determined to place this industry on a solid foundation, providing it a &#x27;conceptional base and institutional support.&#x27; This was necessary to bring dynamism and cohesiveness into an industry, shunned by leaders in the past, and ignored by investors who were inhibited by the lack of incentive to invest in projects which were uncertain of a satisfactory return. Jayewardene considered it essential for the government to give that assurance and with this objective in view, he tabled the Ceylon Tourist Board Act No 10 of 1966 followed by Ceylon Hotels Corporation Act No 14 of 1966. At present the tourism industry in Sri Lanka is a major foreign exchange earner with tourist resorts in almost all cities and an annual turnover of over 500,000 tourists enjoying the tropical climes and beaches.

==Leader of the opposition==
In the general election of 1970, the UNP suffered a major defeat, when the SLFP and its newly formed coalition of leftist parties won almost 2/3 of the parliamentary seats. Once again elected to parliament J. R. Jayewardene took over as opposition leader and de facto leader of the UNP due to the ill health of Dudley Senanayake. After Senanayake died in 1973, Jayewardene succeeded him as UNP leader. He gave the SLFP government his fullest support during the 1971 JVP Insurrection (even though his son was arrested by the police without charges) and in 1972 when the new constitution was enacted proclaiming Ceylon a republic. However, he opposed the government in many moves, which he saw as short-sighted and damaging to the country&#x27;s economy in the long run. These included the adaptation of the closed economy and nationalization of many private businesses and lands. In 1976 he resigned from his seat in parliament in protest, when the government used its large majority in parliament to extend the duration of the government by two more years at the end of its six-year term without holding a general election or a referendum requesting public approval.

==Prime minister==

Tapping into growing anger with the SLFP government, Jayewardene led the UNP to a crushing victory in the 1977 election. The UNP won a staggering five-sixths of the seats in parliament—a total that was magnified by the first-past-the-post system, and one of the most lopsided victories ever recorded for a democratic election. Having been elected to parliament from the Colombo West Electoral District, Jayewardene became Prime Minister and formed a new government.

==Presidency==
Shortly thereafter, he amended the constitution of 1972 to make the presidency an executive post. The provisions of the amendment automatically made the incumbent prime minister—himself—president, and he was sworn in as president on 4 February 1978. He passed a new constitution on 31 August 1978 which came into operation on 7 September of the same year, which granted the president sweeping—and according to some critics, almost dictatorial—powers. He moved the legislative capital from Colombo to Sri Jayawardanapura Kotte. He had likely SLFP presidential nominee Sirimavo Bandaranaike stripped of her civic rights and barred from running for office for six years, based on her decision in 1976 to extend the term of parliament. This ensured that the SLFP would be unable to field a strong candidate against him in the 1982 election, leaving his path to victory clear. This election was held under the 3rd amendment to the constitution which empowered the president to hold a Presidential Election anytime after the expiration of four years of his first term. He held a referendum to cancel the 1983 parliamentary elections, and allow the 1977 parliament to continue until 1989. He also passed a constitutional amendment barring from Parliament any MP who supported separatism; this effectively eliminated the main opposition party, the Tamil United Liberation Front.

===Economy===
There was a complete turnaround in economic policy under him as the previous policies had led to economic stagnation. He opened the heavily state-controlled economy to market forces, which many credit with subsequent economic growth. He opened up the economy and introduced more liberal economic policies emphasizing private sector-led development. Policies were changed to create an environment conducive to foreign and local investment, to promote export-led growth shifting from previous policies of import substitution. To facilitate export-oriented enterprises and to administer Export Processing Zones the Greater Colombo Economic Commission was established. Food subsidies were curtailed and targeted through a Food Stamps Scheme extended to the poor. The system of rice rationing was abolished. The Floor Price Scheme and the Fertilizer Subsidy Scheme were withdrawn. New welfare schemes, such as free school books and the Mahapola Scholarship Programme, were introduced. The rural credit programme expanded with the introduction of the New Comprehensive Rural Credit Scheme and several other medium and long-term credit schemes aimed at small farmers and the self-employed.

He also launched large-scale infrastructure development projects. He launched an extensive housing development program to meet housing shortages in urban and rural areas. The Accelerated Mahaweli Programme built new reservoirs and large hydropower projects such as the Kotmale, Victoria, Randenigala, Rantembe and Ulhitiya. Several Trans Basin Canals were also built to divert water to the Dry Zone.

===Conservation===
His administration launched several wildlife conservation initiatives. This included stopping commercial logging in rain forests such as Sinharaja Forest Reserve which was designated a World Biosphere Reserve in 1978 and a World Heritage Site in 1988.

===Tamil militancy and civil war===
Jayewardene moved to crack down on the growing activity of Tamil militant groups active since the mid-1970s. He passed the Prevention of Terrorism Act in 1979, giving police sweeping powers to arrest and detain. This only escalated the ethnic tensions. Jayewardene claimed he needed overwhelming power to deal with the militants. After the 1977 riots, the government made one concession to the Tamils; it lifted the policy of standardization for university admission that had driven many Tamil youths into militancy. The concession was regarded by the militants as too little and too late, and violent attacks continued, culminating in the ambush of Four Four Bravo which led to the Black July riots. Black July riots transformed the militancy into a civil war, with the swelling ranks of the militant groups. By 1987, the LTTE had emerged as the dominant of the Tamil militant groups and had a free hand over the Jaffna Peninsula, limiting government activities in that region. Jayewardene&#x27;s administration responded with a massive military operation codenamed Operation Liberation to eliminate the LTTE leadership. Jayewardene had to halt the offensive after pressure from India pushed for a negotiated solution to the conflict after executing Operation Poomalai. Jayewardene and Indian Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi finally concluded the Indo-Sri Lanka Accord, which provided for devolution of powers to Tamil-dominated regions, an Indian peacekeeping force in the north, and the demobilization of the LTTE.

The LTTE rejected the accord, as it fell short of even an autonomous state. The provincial councils suggested by India did not have powers to control revenue, policing, or government-sponsored Sinhala settlements in Tamil provinces. Sinhala nationalists were outraged by both the devolution and the presence of foreign troops on Sri Lankan soil. An attempt was made on Jayewardene&#x27;s life in 1987 as a result of his signing of the accord. Young, deprived Sinhalese soon rose in a revolt, organized by the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) which was eventually put down by the government by 1989.

===Foreign policy===
In contrast with his predecessor, Sirimavo Bandaranaike, Jayewardena&#x27;s foreign policy was aligned with American policies (earning him the nickname &#x27;Yankie Dickie&#x27;) much to the chagrin of India. Before Jayewardena&#x27;s ascendency into the presidency, Sri Lanka had doors widely open to neighboring India. Jayewardena&#x27;s tenure in the office restricted the doors to India several times; once an American company tender was granted over an Indian company tender.

Jayewardene hosted Queen Elizabeth II on a visit to Sri Lanka in October 1981.

In 1984, Jayewardene made an official State visit the United States; first Sri Lankan President to do so, upon the invitation of then US President Ronald Reagan.

==Post-presidency==
Jayewardene left office and retired from politics in 1989 after the conclusion of his second term as president at the age of 82; after his successor Ranasinghe Premadasa was formally inaugurated on 2 January 1989. He did not re-enter politics during his retirement even after the assassination of Premadasa in 1993.

==Death==
Jayewardene died of colon cancer, on 1 November 1996, aged 90, at a hospital in Colombo. He was survived by his wife, Elina, and his son, Ravi.

==Legacy==
On the economic front, Jayewardene&#x27;s legacy is decisively a positive one. His economic policies are often credited with saving the Sri Lankan economy from ruin. For thirty years after independence, Sri Lanka had struggled in vain with slow growth and high unemployment. By opening up the country for extensive foreign investments, lifting price controls and promoting private enterprise (which had taken a heavy hit because of the policies of the preceding administration), Jayewardene ensured that the island maintained healthy growth despite the civil war. William K. Steven of The New York Times observes, &quot;President Jayawardene&#x27;s economic policies were credited with transforming the economy from one of scarcity to one of abundance.&quot;

On the ethnic question, Jayewardene&#x27;s legacy is bitterly divisive. When he took office, ethnic tensions were present in the country but were not overtly volatile. But relations between the two ethnicities heavily deteriorated during his administration and his response to these tensions and the signs of conflict has been heavily criticized. President Jayewardene saw these differences between the Sinhalese and Tamils as being &quot;an unbridgeable gap&quot;. Jayewardene said in an interview with the Daily Telegraph, 11 July 1983, &quot;Really, if I starve the Tamils out, the Sinhala people will be happy&quot; about the widespread anti-Tamil sentiments among the Sinhalese at that time.

Highly respected in Japan for his call for peace and reconciliation with post-war Japan at the Peace Conference in San Francisco in 1951, a statue of Jayewardene was erected at the Kamakura Temple in the Kanagawa Prefecture in Japan in his honor.

===J.R. Jayewardene Centre===
In 1988, the J.R. Jayewardene Centre was established by the J.R. Jayewardene Centre Act No. 77 of 1988 by Parliament at the childhood home of J. R. Jayewardene Dharmapala Mawatha, Colombo. It serves as an archive for J.R. Jayewardene&#x27;s library and papers as well as papers, records from the Presidential Secretariat and gifts he received in his tenure as president.

<text>Maitri also known as Friendship Research Centre, is India&#x27;s second permanent research station in Antarctica as part of the Indian Antarctic Programme. The name was suggested by then-Prime Minister Indira Gandhi. Work on the station was first started by the Indian Antarctic expedition which arrived the end of December 1984, with a team led by Dr. B. B. Bhattacharya. Squadron Leader D. P. Joshi, the surgeon of the team, was the first camp commander of the tentage at camp Maitri. The first huts were started by the IV Antarctica Expedition and completed in 1989, shortly before the first station, Dakshin Gangotri, was buried in ice and abandoned in 1990–91. Maitri is situated in the rocky mountainous region called Schirmacher Oasis. It is only away from the Russian Novolazarevskaya Station.

India is planning to replace Maitri research station by a new Maitri-2 station by 2029.

==Facilities==

The station has modern facilities for research in various disciplines, such as biology, earth sciences, glaciology, atmospheric sciences, meteorology, cold region engineering, communication, human physiology, and medicine. It can accommodate 25 people for winter. Fresh water is provided through a freshwater lake named Lake Priyadarshini.

==Airfield==
A blue ice runway, located away, operated by Antarctic Logistics Centre International (ALCI) serves the station and Novolazarevskaya.

<doc id="773110" wikidata="Q549013" url="?curid=773110" title="Darren Campbell">
<text>Darren Andrew Campbell, (born 12 September 1973) is a British former sprint athlete. He was the sprint coach at Wasps Rugby Club for the 2015–16 season. He competed in the 100 metres and 200 metres, as well as the 4 × 100 metres relay.

Campbell was a promising junior athlete and won a number of medals at the World and European Junior Championships. He spent two years away from athletics, playing professional football but returned in 1995, attending his first Olympics shortly afterwards. He began to compete as part of the British 4 × 100 m relay team and between 1997 and 2000 he won two World Championship medals, a gold medal at the 1998 Commonwealth Games, and set the European record in the event. Success also came in the individual events: he became the 1998 European Champion in the 100 m and won his first Olympic medal, a silver in the 200 m at the 2000 Sydney Games. In the 100 m he won silver at the 2002 European Championships and was the 2003 World Championships bronze medallist.

Campbell formed part of perhaps Britain&#x27;s most successful relay team – they won in the European Cup in 1999 and 2000, at the 2002 Commonwealth Games, and took the gold at the 2004 Athens Olympics (the first time a British team had done so since 1912). Campbell had also won a gold medal at the 2002 European Championships and a 2003 World Championship silver medal but had to return them when his running-mate, Dwain Chambers, tested positive for banned substances, sparking much animosity between the two. He won his last medal in 2006, again taking the relay gold at the European Championships, and he retired shortly afterwards. His personal bests of 10.04 s in the 100 m and 20.13 s in the 200 m were not prodigiously quick by elite global standards, but over his career he earned an impressive reputation as a &#x27;championship&#x27; runner, saving his best for finals and collecting significantly more medals than his times alone would indicate.

He now works with various Premier League football clubs, working with the players to improve their sprinting ability. He also regularly visits schools to promote sport among children, on behalf of the Youth Sport Trust, and he also recently appeared as a VIP guest at Sheffield Hallam University&#x27;s annual Sports Ball held at Ponds Forge International Sports Centre.

In September 2024, it was announced that Campbell had joined sports tech firm Feldspar as Global Track Strategy Director, to oversee the development and the testing of the company’s cutting-edge sensor-enabled high-performance running track.

==Career==
===Early career===
Raised on the Racecourse Estate in Sale, Cheshire Campbell was a talented athlete and footballer in his youth. His first national success in athletics was a gold medal at the English Schools Championships in the 200 m. Campbell then won the 100 m and 200 m gold medals at the 1991 European Junior Championships held in Thessaloniki, Greece, as well as a gold medal in the 4 × 100 m. A year later, he won silver medals at the 1992 World Junior Championships, in the sprint double, and a gold medal in the 4 × 100 m relay. He was beaten both times by Ato Boldon, who became the first athlete to win a double at the championships. 
His senior international debut came at the Stuttgart World Championships in 1993, as part of the 4 × 100 m squad. However, as a result of injuries, he left athletics at the age of 21 to launch a career in football with trials for Cwmbran Town, Plymouth Argyle, Yorkley, Weymouth, UWIC Inter Cardiff and Newport County amongst others.

===Return to athletics===
Campbell returned to athletics in 1995, and ran the 100 m in 10.34sec that year. The following year, he improved his 100 m time to 10.17sec, and represented Britain in the 1996 Summer Olympics in Atlanta, USA. Campbell only represented Britain in the 4 × 100 m relay, but the baton was dropped as it was passed on to him.

At the 1997 World Championships, Campbell won his first major senior medal – a bronze in the 4 × 100 m relay, and by this time was a regular feature in the British squad.

Campbell&#x27;s first senior gold medals came at the 1998 European Championships in Budapest. Campbell won the 100 m individual event, setting his best time at the 100 m in the final – 10.13sec, and also winning gold in the 4 × 100 m relay. At the Commonwealth Games that year, Campbell helped break the championship record for the 4 × 100 m relay. However, he won no individual medals.

The following year, in the 1999 World Championships, held in Seville, Campbell won the silver medal in the 4 × 100 m relay, but was eliminated from his individual event in the semi-finals.

===2000 and the Sydney Olympics===
In 2000, Campbell won the man of the match award in the European Cup following his performance in the 100 m. Campbell replaced Jason Gardener with 20 minutes notice, and won the race in a time of 10.09sec (wind-assisted). He also ran in a leg in the winning 4 × 100 m relay team.

At the Olympics in Sydney, Campbell placed 6th in the 100 m final, and took a surprise silver medal in the 200 m, as Campbell was mainly a 100 m runner, and had a previous best time of 20.49sec. In the quarter-final, he took 0.29sec off this to reduce to 20.13sec, his fastest time at the distance in his career. This was followed by performances of 20.23sec in the semi-final and 20.14sec in the final to finish second, Campbell&#x27;s first senior medal at the distance. The gold medal was won by controversial Greek sprinter Konstantinos Kenteris.

===2001–2002===
Campbell was again hit by injury in 2001, missing the majority of the year&#x27;s competitions. He had run 10.16sec for the 100 m and 20.41sec for the 200 m, and been named European Cup captain prior to the injury.

After returning from injury the following year, Campbell took bronze in the individual 100 m event and gold in the 4 × 100 m relay at the 2002 European Championships. His bronze was later upgraded to a silver after Dwain Chambers confessed to taking performance-enhancing drugs at this time. However, the relay gold was later taken from him, as Chambers was part of the quartet. He won his quarter-final in the 200 m, but was eliminated after being disqualified for stepping outside his lane.

The year also saw Campbell compete in his home town of Manchester in the Commonwealth Games. He did repeat his Olympic success in the 200 m, receiving bronze in this event. However, he anchored the team to gold in the 4 × 100 m relay along with squad members Jason Gardener, Marlon Devonish and Allyn Condon, just beating Asafa Powell of Jamaica in a very tight photo finish.

===2003–2006===
In 2003, at the Paris World Championships, Campbell took bronze in the 100 m, but missed on a medal in the 200 m, finishing fourth in the final. He also ran the 2nd leg for the 4 × 100 m relay team, but later lost this medal due to Dwain Chambers being found guilty of doping. Campbell also set his 60 m PB of 6.59sec this year.

In the 2004 Summer Olympics, Campbell won a surprise gold medal in the 4 × 100 m, in a team with Jason Gardener, Marlon Devonish and Mark Lewis-Francis, who defeated the USA team by just 0.01sec, winning in a season&#x27;s best of 38.07sec. However, Campbell performed less well in the 100 m and 200 m, exiting in the heat and semi-final respectively, due to not being fully recovered from a hamstring injury.

He was named captain for the European Cup in 2005, however did not have a successful season, only placing 5th in the AAA semi-final and running 10.47sec (10.48w) for the 100 m and 20.9sec for the 200 m. He did, however, receive an MBE in the New Year Honours.

Campbell competed at the 2006 Commonwealth Games in Melbourne, however did not progress past the semi-final in the 200 m, and the England team were eliminated in the 4 × 100 m after a faulty baton changeover in their heat. He did not compete individually at the European Championships in Gothenburg, but ran the second leg to help Britain to the gold medal in the 4 x 100 relay.

===European Championships row===
On 13 August 2006, after winning the 4 × 100 m European relay gold medal with Great Britain, Campbell left the track without completing a lap of honour with the rest of his teammates. He initially remained cryptic about his problems, but revealed the next day that his lap of honour boycott was due to his loss of two relay medals (2002 European Championships gold and 2003 World Championships silver) as a result of Dwain Chambers&#x27; doping. Campbell did, however, explain that he did stand by Chambers insofar as he was not solely accountable, but he felt Chambers had a duty to inform the authorities of the individuals who led him to his departure to America and his resulting adoption of a drug programme. John Regis criticised Campbell for this stand, also noting that his coach (Linford Christie) had served a drugs ban.

Campbell defended himself, saying &quot;I will not regret doing that. At times you have to stand up for what you believe&quot;, and also that he was concerned about youngsters ending up the same situation. He also defended his links with Christie, stating that he would not have remained with Christie if he thought he had cheated.

===Retirement===
Campbell announced his retirement on 18 August 2006. His final race was at the inaugural Celtic Cup race in Grangemouth, where he won the 100 m competing as a guest. Campbell surprised Dave Collins and UK Athletics, who had been expecting him to retire following the two-day international athletics meeting at Birmingham taking place over the following two days.

In July 2007, Campbell was announced as the new ambassador for Sky Sports Living for Sport, a successful initiative run by the Youth Sport Trust in conjunction with BSkyB, which uses sport as a tool to re-engage young people who may be at risk of opting out of school life. Sky Sports Living for Sport, now in its fifth year, has involved over 600 schools and benefited over 17,000 young people aged 11–16. Campbell&#x27;s role will see him meet young people and teachers involved in Sky Sports Living for Sport across the country to share his experiences and help inspire them to reach their full potential.

===Football coaching===
Campbell is well regarded in football circles; he has given training sessions to Manchester United, Chelsea and Everton. He is said to be a pace and acceleration specialist. Campbell also worked with MK Dons, at the invitation of then manager, Paul Ince.

===Rugby coaching===
He has also been engaged by several professional rugby clubs such as Sale Sharks and Saracens to help develop the power and speed of the squad for the 2011–12 season. He has also previously worked with Jonah Lomu while the Kiwi was playing rugby for Cardiff.

==Personal bests==
Campbell&#x27;s reputation was made as a championship runner, rather than a runner of fast times. Although he never raced below 10 seconds for 100m, or 20 seconds for the 200m, he consistently outperformed rivals with faster personal and seasons bests, enabling him to pick up medals at global and continental championships, and was an excellent, and consistent, relay runner. His medal record of Olympic gold and silver, and World Championship silver and bronze left him second only to Linford Christie among post war British sprinters in terms of global medals, and one of the few British male sprinters to win individual medals at all four major championships.

==Achievements==

1Disqualified in the quarterfinals

Apart from these performances, during his career Campbell has also won seven national titles at either the 100 or 200 metres.

==Notes==
* Disqualified and medals stripped after teammate Dwain Chambers tested positive for banned substances.

==Personal life==
Campbell was a childhood friend of English comedy personality Karl Pilkington, as described in &quot;The Ricky Gervais Show&quot; podcasts. In a podcast episode, Pilkington claimed to have been responsible for much of Campbell&#x27;s early training, which mainly involved allowing him to push a go kart that Pilkington sat in. Campbell later thanked Pilkington in a tweet.

Campbell guest presented children&#x27;s TV gameshow &quot;Best of Friends&quot; in the &#x27;sports special&#x27; with Iwan Thomas in 2008. He was a participant in round one of &quot;Celebrity MasterChef&quot; 2011.

Campbell is also a dog breeder, breeding Cavalier King Charles Spaniels, Border Collies, Rottweilers and other breeds.

<text>The Ward House is a house on Capitol Hill in Seattle, Washington, USA. Having been built in 1882, it is one of the oldest houses in Seattle. Existing houses reportedly built before 1882 in Seattle include the 2629 East Aloha Street (1881), 727 28th Avenue (1870) and Maynard&#x27;s House located at 3045 64th Avenue Southwest (approximately 1860 ± 2 years).

The building, originally at 1427 Boren Avenue, was designed, built and originally owned by George W. Ward. In 1962, the architect Victor Steinbrueck wrote of it, &quot;…this fanciful example of residential Victorian carpenter Gothic, one of the most interesting and apparently sound of the rare few remaining… could be made delightfully attractive by sympathetic preservation…&quot;

Nonetheless, it became vacant in 1974 and was scheduled for demolition in the mid-1980s. The owners, Dr. and Mrs. Michael Buckley, donated the structure to Historic Seattle, a nonprofit architectural preservation organization chartered as a public development authority by the city. Historic Seattle in turn sold it to David Leen, a local lawyer, for $7,500. On April 6, 1986, Leen moved the Ward House from its First Hill lot on Boren Avenue between Union and Pike Streets to its current location at the corner of E. Denny Way and Belmont Avenue E. Leen worked to restore the building using fixtures and furniture from the original time period. The building was occupied by Leen&#x27;s law office, as well as several other solo practices, until 2016. It is now owned and occupied by Tola Capital, LLC.

Besides being listed on the National Register of Historic Places, the building is also an official City of Seattle landmark.

<doc id="773115" wikidata="Q3366252" url="?curid=773115" title="Conservative People's Party (Poland)">
<text>The Conservative People&#x27;s Party (, SKL) was a liberal-conservative and Christian-democratic political party in Poland, which was active in 1997–2003 and 2007–2014. In 2014, the party was incorporated into Poland Together.

==History==
The party was formed in January 1997 with the merger of some minor Christian-democratic party and a conservative faction of the liberal Freedom Union, the latter led by Jan Rokita. The party soon joined the centre-right Solidarity Electoral Action coalition and was subsequently part of it in the 1997 parliamentary election. The coalition won 33.8% of the vote and 201 seats in the Sejm, 14 of which were SKL members, notably including Rokita and Bronislaw Komorowski.

Within the coalition, the SKL represented the more liberal wing. In the 2000 presidential election, Marian Krzaklewski was the coalition&#x27;s official candidate and won 15.6% of the vote, but a large chunk of the coalition, especially SKL members, had supported the independent candidate Andrzej Olechowski, who won 17.3% of the vote.

In January 2001, when the Solidarity Electoral Action was re-organised as a federation, it was one of the four member parties, the other being the Social Movement, the Christian National Union and the Polish Christian Democratic Agreement. However, in March 2001, the SKL withdrew from the coalition and most of it would later join, indirectly or directly, Civic Platform, which had been established in January 2001. In the 2001 parliamentary election, the SKL participated within Civic Platform&#x27;s electoral slates.

In 2002, what remained of the SKL was merged with the Polish Christian Democratic Agreement, while Rokita was Civic Platform&#x27;s leader in the Sejm from 2003 to 2005. In 2004, the SKL and the Social Movement were replaced by the Centre Party. The Conservative People&#x27;s Party was revived in 2007 and lasted until 2014, when it became part of Poland Together.

==Party presidents==
* Jacek Janiszewski (1997–1998)
* Mirosław Styczeń (1998–2000)
* Jan Rokita (2000–2002)
* Artur Balazs (2002–2006, 2007–2009)
* Marek Zagórski (2009–2014)

==Latest Sejm members==
In the 2001 parliamentary election, SKL politicians entered the Sejm as candidates of the Civic Platform Electoral Committee (Civic Platform + Conservative People&#x27;s Party + Real Politics Union). Several SKL members including its leaders Jan Rokita and Bronislaw Komorowski decided to join directly the newly created Civice Platform, while those who refused to join it formed a separate parliamentary caucus:
* Dorota Arciszewska-Mielewczyk, Gdynia
* Artur Balazs, Szczecin 
* Zbigniew Chrzanowski, Siedlce 
* Ireneusz Niewiarowski, Konin
* Krzysztof Oksiuta, Warsaw 
* Małgorzata Rohde, Koszalin 
* Andrzej Wojtyła, Kalisz 
* Marek Zagórski, Białystok

<text>TD Bank, N.A. is an American national bank and the United States subsidiary of the Canadian multinational TD Bank Group. It operates primarily across the East Coast, in 15 U.S. states and Washington, D.C. TD Bank is the seventh-largest U.S. bank by deposits and the 10th largest bank in the United States by total assets, resulting from a series of several mergers and acquisitions. TD Bank, N.A. is headquartered in Cherry Hill, New Jersey, an inner suburb eight miles (13 km) outside Philadelphia. TD Bank is a federally chartered bank, thus its trading name bears &quot;N.A.&quot; letters.

On October 10, 2024, in a historic settlement with U.S. authorities, TD pleaded guilty and agreed to pay $3 billion in combined penalties for money laundering conspiracy over a decade, including failure to monitor trillions in potentially suspicious transactions annually, necessitating a four-year independent monitorship and comprehensive AML reforms.

==History==

TD Bank is a successor to the Portland Savings Bank, which later became Banknorth after a series of mergers with various other New England banks. The Canada-based TD Bank Group then became majority owner in 2004 and renamed it &quot;TD Banknorth, N.A.&quot; by adding the Canadian bank&#x27;s popular &quot;TD&quot; initials. On May 31, 2008, TD Bank Group acquired Commerce Bank, and merged it with TD Banknorth to form &quot;TD Bank, N.A.&quot;, what is now the United States subsidiary of its Canadian parent company.

In 2010, TD Bank, N.A. acquired the South Financial Group and its 172 branches across the Carolinas and Florida. South Financial was the parent company of Carolina First, with branch locations in North and South Carolina and Mercantile Bank, with branch locations in Florida, for about $191 million. South Financial&#x27;s branches were converted to the TD Bank name. 

In 2013, TD Bank, N.A. centralized its American headquarters in Cherry Hill, New Jersey, U.S.

In February 2016, TD Bank&#x27;s consumer card division purchased the Nordstrom credit card unit for $2.2 billion. The acquisition added Nordstrom to TD&#x27;s growing folio of private-label cards that includes Target, NordicTrack, and Tourneau.

On October 29, 2021, TD Bank, N.A. announced Leo Salom would succeed Greg Braca as the bank’s U.S. President &amp; CEO. Salom had been leading TD’s wealth management and insurance business. Salom’s role change became effective January 1, 2022.

On February 28, 2022, TD Bank, N.A. announced plans to acquire Memphis, Tennessee-based First Horizon Corporation for US$13.4 billion. The deal was expected to close in 2023, but was scrapped in May 2023.

==Legal actions and public controversies==
===2012 data breach===
In October 2012, the Massachusetts attorney general announced that TD Bank misplaced unencrypted backup tapes with &quot;extensive customer information, including Social Security numbers and bank account numbers&quot;. The bank initially refused to state how many customers were affected. After an inquiry by the attorney general, it stated 267,000 customers. The bank waited more than six months to notify customers.

===TCPA class action lawsuit===
In October 2015, a class action lawsuit was filed against TD Bank claiming that it violated the Telephone Consumer Protection Act of 1991. The lawsuit alleged the bank called consumers up to 10 times per day. As of July 3, 2017, all but one of the claims were dismissed by Judge Jerome B. Simandle.

===Coin-count machine lawsuit===
In 2016, the bank was sued for allegations that their coin counting machines, &quot;Penny Arcades&quot;, were inaccurately counting coins. The lawsuit estimates that 26 cents out of every $100 was not counted, totaling to $9 million.

=== Financial penalties ===
Many cases of financial penalties against the company do feature mitigating factors including accidental human error at branches due to customers presenting fraudulent information; however, the company has been assessed penalties in excess of $197 million since the year 2000 for consumer, banking, investor protection, wage and privacy violations.

=== 2024 money laundering case ===
On October 10, 2024, in a landmark enforcement action, the U.S. Treasury Department&#x27;s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) levied a record-breaking $1.3 billion penalty against TD Bank for chronic violations of anti-money laundering (AML) laws, contributing to a total settlement of over $3 billion across multiple U.S. authorities. TD admitted to willfully neglecting its AML program for over a decade, allowing trillions of dollars in potentially suspicious transactions to go unchecked annually. TD Bank&#x27;s failures ranged from inadequate monitoring of peer-to-peer transactions indicative of human trafficking and fentanyl trafficking, to facilitating over $670 million in transactions for a Chinese organized crime ring. TD agreed to a four-year independent monitorship and comprehensive reforms of its AML practices. U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren criticized the Justice Department&#x27;s decision not to charge the bank directly with money laundering and their choice to shift legal liability to TD&#x27;s U.S. holding company. Warren argued that by failing to prosecute high-level executives, the DOJ is allowing banks to simply factor enforcement fines into their cost of doing business rather than taking compliance seriously. Warren and Senator Ron Wyden requested that TD identify executives responsible for AML compliance failures. On December 11, 2024, DOJ charged a Florida-based TD employee with facilitating money laundering to Colombia. In January 2025, TD announced major leadership changes and compensation cuts. Its CEO transition was accelerated, with Raymond Chun taking over on February 1, 2025. Jackie Sanjuas was named as the new global head of financial crime management.

==Sponsorships==
In 2005, TD Banknorth announced it purchased the naming rights of what is currently the TD Garden, home of the Boston Celtics and Boston Bruins sports teams.

When TD Bank bought Commerce Bancorp in 2009, the company became title sponsor of the TD Bank Ballpark, home of the Somerset Patriots.

On August 22, 2019, TD announced its partnership with The Shed, the new arts center on Manhattan&#x27;s Far West Side, as lead sponsor of the &quot;Open Call&quot; artist commissioning program.

On November 4, 2019, TD announced an extension of their long standing Canadian partnership with the Toronto Blue Jays into the United States with the naming rights to the team&#x27;s spring training home in Dunedin, Florida, to be renamed TD Ballpark.

<doc id="773137" wikidata="Q1067802" url="?curid=773137" title="Paris Charter">
<text>The Charter of Paris for a New Europe (also known as the Paris Charter) was adopted by a summit meeting of most European governments in addition to those of Canada, the United States and the Soviet Union, in Paris from 19–21 November 1990. The charter was established on the foundation of the Helsinki Accords and was further amended in the 1999 Charter for European Security. Together, these documents form the agreed basis for the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe. However, not all OSCE member countries have signed the treaty.

The Charter was one of many attempts to seize the opportunity of the fall of Communism by actively inviting the former Eastern Bloc countries into the ideological framework of the West. It has been compared to the Conference of Versailles of 1919 or the Congress of Vienna of 1815 in its grandiose ambition to reshape Europe. In effect, the Paris Summit was the peace conference of the Cold War: &quot;Perestroika&quot; had ultimately put an end to the ideological and political division of the Iron Curtain. Pluralist democracy and market economy were together with international law and multilateralism seen as the victors.

The Charter established an &quot;Office for Free Elections&quot; (later renamed Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights) in Warsaw, a &quot;Conflict Prevention Centre&quot; in Vienna, and a secretariat. Later, in 1992, a Secretary General was also appointed. It was agreed that the Foreign Ministers are to convene regularly for political consultations.

British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher attended the summit while undergoing a challenge to her leadership of the country&#x27;s ruling Conservative Party, and it was while in Paris that she learned she had not obtained sufficient votes in the first round of the party&#x27;s leadership election to be declared the winner outright, necessitating a further round of voting. Thatcher later claimed that the fact she was in Paris and unable to begin immediately rallying support was one of the factors that led to her leaving the leadership election and resigning as party leader and Prime Minister after 11 years of power.

<doc id="773152" wikidata="Q609120" url="?curid=773152" title="City of Gosford">
<text>The City of Gosford was a local government area that was located in the Central Coast region in the state of New South Wales, Australia. The incorporation of Gosford dates back to 1886 when the Town of Gosford was proclaimed as the &quot;Borough of Gosford&quot;, becoming the &quot;Municipality of Gosford&quot; from 1906. In 1908, the Gosford Municipality merged into Erina Shire which covered the remaining Central Coast area outside of Gosford, but regained its independence in 1936. From 1 January 1947, local government in the Central Coast region was reorganised, creating &quot;Gosford Shire&quot; and Wyong Shire, and the final boundaries of Gosford City Council date from this period. From 1 January 1980, Gosford Shire was granted city status, becoming the City of Gosford. On 12 May 2016 the Minister for Local Government amalgamated the City of Gosford and Wyong Shire Councils to form the new Central Coast Council.

Until its merger with the Wyong Shire in 2016, The City of Gosford covered an area of . Its administrative seat was located in Gosford, approximately north of Sydney and approximately south of Newcastle. The city was bounded to the east by the Tasman Sea, to the south by Broken Bay and the Hawkesbury River, to the west by the Great North Road where it encircled the Dharug National Park taking in the catchment area of the Mangrove Creek Dam, before heading south–east towards the coast, north of Forresters Beach.

The last mayor of the Gosford City Council was Cr. Lawrie McKinna, an independent politician.

==Suburbs and localities==
The local government area included a moderately densely populated coastal strip that extended northward from the Hawkesbury River, and an extensive sparsely-populated region to the west that was largely native bush. The towns and villages located within the City of Gosford were:

== History ==
===Early history===
The traditional Aboriginal inhabitants of the lands now known as the Brisbane Water were the Guringai people of the Eora nation. The Darkingung people occupied large areas inland west towards Rylstone, and north to Cessnock and Wollombi.

In 1811, the Governor of New South Wales, Lachlan Macquarie, gave the first land grant in the region to William Nash, a former marine of the First Fleet. No further grants were made in the area until 1821. In 1839 governor Sir George Gipps named the town of Gosford after his friend, The Earl of Gosford. In 1840, the Brisbane Water Police District was proclaimed covering the area from the Hawkesbury River to Lake Macquarie and which administered local government under the control of magistrates. In 1843, the Brisbane Water District Council was proclaimed on the same boundaries as the Police District, and replaced the appointed magistrates with an elected council as part of an early attempt to establish local government administration throughout the colony. This experiment in local government was not very successful, with much public opposition focused on the issue of increased taxation, and a lack of oversight and faulty administration led to the collapse of many of these District Councils. The Brisbane Water District Council had ceased to exist by 1855, and the NSW Parliament passed the &quot;Municipalities Act&quot; in 1858, which allowed for the creation of Municipalities and Boroughs if a petition of as few as 50 signatures was presented to the government. However, no petition was ever sent from the residents of Brisbane Water to the government under this act, and local matters reverted to the police magistrates for determination.

===Gosford Borough===
Under the succeeding &quot;Municipalities Act, 1867&quot;, which allowed for residents to petition the Colonial Government for incorporation, a petition signed by 59 Gosford residents, amongst a population of approximately 1,000 at the time, was sent to the governor on 10 June 1886 requesting the establishment of the &quot;Borough of Gosford&quot; with two wards, East Gosford and West Gosford. The petition was subsequently accepted and on 11 November 1886, the &quot;Borough of Gosford&quot; was proclaimed by the governor Lord Carrington, with an area of 1,840 acres in and around the Town of Gosford. The first election for the six aldermen and two auditors was held at Gosford Courthouse on 1 February 1887, and the first mayor, John Bennett Whiteway, was elected at the first council meeting on 20 February 1887. From 1888, the borough council meetings were held in the Gosford School of Arts building at 38 Mann Street.

===Erina Shire===
The remaining area of the Brisbane Water Police District outside of Gosford continued to be administered by the police magistrates until 1906. From 7 March 1906, this area became the Erina Shire, when it was proclaimed by the NSW Government Gazette along with 132 other new Shires as a result of the passing of the &quot;Local Government (Shires) Act 1905&quot;. On 16 May 1906, the Shire was divided in to three Ridings (A, B, C) and five temporary councillors were appointed (John Bourke of Kincumber, John Martin Moroney of Woy Woy, Harold Stanley Robinson of Penang, Manasseh Ward of Gosford, and Alexander Wilkinson of Wyong). The Temporary Council first met at Gosford Courthouse on 13 June 1906 and Manasseh Ward was elected as the chairman. The first election was held on 24 November 1906 and the first meeting of the elected nine-member council was held at the Gosford Courthouse on 5 December 1906, with councillor Ward elected to continue serving as the first shire president. 

With the coming into effect of the &quot;Local Government Act, 1906&quot;, the Borough of Gosford became the Municipality of Gosford, as well as the power of Councils to petition the government to dissolve and merge with other Councils. In July 1907 a petition from the Municipality of Gosford was published in the Government Gazette requesting to merge with Erina Shire, the first Council to do so under the 1906 act. However, owing to objections from the Wyong Progress Association and the Erina Shire Council, a public inquiry was established by the secretary for public works, where it was heard that the Gosford Municipality was in debt and desired to merge with Erina to resolve its financial issues. Despite objections, the commissioner returned a recommendation for the merger and a proposal for a six-ward model was considered and accepted at a conference held on 30 September 1907. The proposal for a six-ward Erina Shire with Gosford becoming F Riding was subsequently proclaimed and came into effect on 23 January 1908. The new Shire Council Chambers on Mann Street, Gosford, were officially opened on 4 May 1912.

In 1921, a group of ratepayers angered by what they saw as a general neglect of their local area, formed an organisation to work towards the separation of the Woy Woy Peninsula area from Erina Shire. On 27 April 1928 a proposal for separation was received and the Shire of Woy Woy was subsequently proclaimed on 1 August 1928.

===Gosford Municipality and Brisbane Water County Council===

In March 1936, three councillors of Erina Shire were dismissed from office for having held office while subject to a special disqualification, and it was also revealed that council staff had not been paid since February. As the council could not meet due to lack of quorum, on 24 March 1936 the Minister for Local Government, Eric Spooner, dismissed the council and appointed an administrator, B. C. Hughes. Spooner commissioned Hughes to undertake an inquiry into the administration of Erina Shire and, following a January petition from Gosford and Point Clare residents for a new Gosford municipality, also to investigate the question of the separation of Gosford from the Shire. The inquiry found in favour of a separation of Gosford, which was accepted by Spooner, and Erina Shire was divided again to re-form the Municipality of Gosford on 24 October 1936, including the areas of the former Gosford Municipality abolished in 1908 and also new areas from Narara to Woy Woy and Point Clare. A nine-member provisional council was appointed the same day, and at the first meeting on 24 October 1936 William Calman Grahame was elected as the first mayor and Charles Staples, the former mayor of Woy Woy, was elected deputy mayor. Following the first council election on 23 January 1937, Grahame and Staples were re-elected to their positions on 29 January.

In March 1938, the first permanent supply of town water was delivered to Gosford, with the opening of a new water supply direct from Lower Mooney Dam on the Mooney Mooney Creek. On 22 April 1939, the Gosford Council Chambers on Mann Street, designed in the Inter-war Art Deco style by architects Loyal Figgis and Virgil Cizzio and built by A. E. Catterall at a cost of £5,785, was officially opened by the Minister for Local Government, Eric Spooner.

Following significant debate about the provision of electricity undertakings across the Central Coast, including over the split between Erina Shire and Gosford, on 16 October 1942 Gosford Municipality combined with the Shires of Erina and Woy Woy to form the Brisbane Water County Council to provide electricity to the combined area of the three councils. The county council operated as an electricity and gas supplier and retailer and was managed by representatives of the three councils. The county council operated until its amalgamation with the Sydney County Council from 1 January 1980.

===Gosford and Wyong===

In June 1945, Erina Shire resolved to investigate the reconstitution of local government on the Central Coast into two shires and following further discussions a formal proposal was presented to the Minister for Local Government, Joseph Cahill, in October 1945. Nevertheless, the proposal proved divisive, with Gosford and the Wyong section of Erina Shire in favour and the rest of Erina Shire and Woy Woy Shire opposed. The formal government inquiry subsequently supported the proposal and in April 1946, Cahill notified the councils of his intention to proceed. On 1 January 1947, part of Erina Shire, all of Woy Woy Shire and the Municipality of Gosford formed Gosford Shire, and the remainder of Erina Shire north and east of Kulnura, Central Mangrove and Lisarow formed Wyong Shire.

In August 1948, Gosford Shire established the first Library Service, with branches opening on 13 August at Woy Woy (in the old Council Chambers) and on 16 August on Mann Street next to the Council Chambers. An expanded Gosford Branch Library was opened in 1951 by the Minister for Education, Bob Heffron. New Libraries were subsequently opened at Gosford (Donnison St, 1969), Umina (1983), Kariong (2002) and at Kincumber, Wyoming and Erina (2003).

On 23 February 1961, Gosford Shire Council resolved to suspend the shire clerk, Nigel George Howes, noting dissatisfaction with his work and that they no longer had confidence in him. However, Howes later gained an Equity Court ruling that placed a suspension on council&#x27;s dismissal of him until a public inquiry could be held to investigate the Council resolution. Awaiting the results of the inquiry, Howes returned to work in March and was suspended again on 6 June 1961, with the council then airing various allegations in the inquiry against him. On 5 August 1961, the council was brought into disrepute again when Councillor Donald Norman Lamont was convicted on 11 counts (fined £450) for three breaches of the &quot;Local Government Act 1919&quot;, including voting and participating in debate on several developments in which he had a significant undeclared financial interest. As a result of these events, the Minister for Local Government, Pat Hills, announced that due to the failure of council to resolve these matters and the loss of public confidence in the council, he would dismiss the council and appoint an administrator. Subsequently, on 20 September 1961 Hills dismissed the council and appointed the Chief Inspector of Local Government Accounts, Henry William Dane, as administrator. On the dismissal, Councillor Dangar laid the blame for the dysfunction at the feet of the acting shire president, Jack Roberts: &quot;As soon as Councillor Barrett [the shire president] became ill, you made no effort to work with Mr Howes and you had him sacked within two weeks.&quot; The inquiry was concluded in October 1961, with Special Magistrate E. R. Harvey finding that there was &quot;no justification&quot; for Council&#x27;s actions to suspend the shire clerk. Not long after, Dane reinstated Howes to duty as shire clerk, and the council would remain under administration until December 1965.

In 1974–1976, the 1939 Gosford Council Council Chambers were demolished and replaced by the Gosford Administration Building, a Brutalist style tower with a pre-cast concrete facade designed by prominent architects, McConnell Smith &amp; Johnston. On 9 November 1979, the Shire of Gosford was proclaimed as the City of Gosford, with effect from 1 January 1980.

In January 1997, the mayor of Gosford, Tony Sansom, was briefly threatened with dismissal from office when a Magistrate ordered that he be removed from office as a result of litigation that alleged irregularities in moving the dates of the September 1996 mayoral election. However, Sansom, who described the magistrate&#x27;s ruling as &quot;bizarre&quot; appealed the decision to the Supreme Court. On 4 July 1997, the Supreme Court overturned the magistrate&#x27;s ruling, with Justice Michael Grove noting that the ruling was an &quot;error of law&quot;.

===Establishment of Central Coast Council and abolition of Gosford City Council===
In 2015 a review of local government boundaries by the NSW Government Independent Pricing and Regulatory Tribunal recommended that Wyong Shire and Gosford City councils merge to form one single council with an area of and support a population of approximately 331,007. On 12 May 2016, with the release of the &quot;Local Government (Council Amalgamations) Proclamation 2016&quot;, Central Coast Council was formed from Wyong Shire and Gosford City councils. The first meeting of the Central Coast Council was held at the Wyong Civic Centre on 25 May 2016, with meetings alternating between Gosford and Wyong.

==Demographics==
At the 2011 Census, there were people in Gosford local government area, making the area the twelfth most populous local government area in New South Wales, and the twenty–fourth most populous local government area in Australia.

==Council==
===Final composition and election method===
Gosford City Council was composed of ten councillors elected proportionally as one entire ward. All councillors were elected for a fixed four-year term of office. The last election was held on 8 September 2012, and the makeup of the council was as follows: The mayor and deputy mayor were elected annually by the councillors at a special meeting of the council in September. The final Council, elected in 2012 and abolished in 2016, in order of election, were:

<text>In photometry, illuminance is the total luminous flux incident on a surface, per unit area. It is a measure of how much the incident light illuminates the surface, wavelength-weighted by the luminosity function to correlate with human brightness perception. Similarly, luminous emittance is the luminous flux per unit area emitted from a surface. Luminous emittance is also known as luminous exitance.

In SI units illuminance is measured in lux (lx), or equivalently in lumens per square metre (lm·m−2). Luminous exitance is measured in lm·m−2 only, not lux. In the CGS system, the unit of illuminance is the phot, which is equal to . The foot-candle is a non-metric unit of illuminance that is used in photography.

Illuminance was formerly often called brightness, but this leads to confusion with other uses of the word, such as to mean luminance. &quot;Brightness&quot; should never be used for quantitative description, but only for nonquantitative references to physiological sensations and perceptions of light.

The human eye is capable of seeing somewhat more than a 2 trillion-fold range. The presence of white objects is somewhat discernible under starlight, at (50 μlx), while at the bright end, it is possible to read large text at 108 lux (100 Mlx), or about 1000 times that of direct sunlight, although this can be very uncomfortable and cause long-lasting afterimages.

==Common illuminance levels==

==Astronomy==
In astronomy, the illuminance stars cast on the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere is used as a measure of their brightness. The usual units are apparent magnitudes in the visible band. V-magnitudes can be converted to lux using the formula
formula_1
where &quot;E&quot;v is the illuminance in lux, and &quot;m&quot;v is the apparent magnitude. The reverse conversion is
formula_2

==Relation to luminance==

The luminance of a reflecting surface is related to the illuminance it receives:
formula_3
where the integral covers all the directions of emission , and
* v is the surface&#x27;s luminous exitance
* v is the received illuminance, and
* is the reflectance.

In the case of a perfectly diffuse reflector (also called a Lambertian reflector), the luminance is isotropic, per Lambert&#x27;s cosine law. Then the relationship is simply
formula_4

<doc id="773155" wikidata="Q17012865" url="?curid=773155" title="Old 100th">
<text>&quot;Old Hundredth&quot; (also known as &quot;Old Hundred&quot;) is a hymn tune in long metre, from the second edition of the Genevan Psalter. It is one of the best known melodies in many occidental Christian musical traditions. The tune is usually attributed to the French composer Louis Bourgeois (c.1560).

Although the tune was first associated with Psalm 134 in the Genevan Psalter, the melody receives its current name from an association with the &quot;100th&quot; Psalm, in a translation by William Kethe titled &quot;All People that on Earth do Dwell&quot;. The melody is also sung to various other lyrics, including the Common Doxology (&quot;Praise God From Whom All Blessings Flow&quot;) and various German Lutheran chorales. In that latter respect it was used by Johann Sebastian Bach as a cantus firmus in his chorale cantata &quot;Herr Gott, dich loben alle wir&quot; (BWV 130).

==Background==
The Genevan Psalter was compiled over a number of years in the Swiss city of Geneva, a center of Protestant activity during the Reformation, in response to the teaching of John Calvin that communal singing of psalms in the vernacular language is a foundational aspect of church life. This contrasted with the prevailing Catholic practice at the time in which sacred texts were chanted in Latin by the clergy only. Calvinist musicians including Bourgeois supplied many new melodies and adapted others from sources both sacred and secular. The final version of this psalter was completed in 1562. Calvin intended the melodies to be sung in plainsong during church services, but harmonized versions were provided for singing at home.

==Lyrics==
The original lyrics set to this tune in the Genevan Psalter are a paraphrase of Psalm 134:

\addlyrics { %this matches more or less with the English given earlier:
Vous, saints mi -- ni -- stres du Sei -- gneur, %Ye, holy ministers of the Lord
Qui, dé -- vou -- és à son hon -- neur, %Who, dedicated to his honour
Veil -- lez la nuit dans sa mai -- son, %Watch by night in his abode
Pré -- sen -- tez -- lui votre o -- rai -- son. } %Present him your oration
&lt;/score&gt;
Or, in English translation:
&lt;poem&gt;You faithful servants of the Lord,
sing out his praise with one accord,
while serving him with all your might
and keeping vigil through the night.

Unto his house lift up your hand
and to the Lord your praises send.
May God who made the earth and sky
bestow his blessings from on high.&lt;/poem&gt;
Old 100th is commonly used to sing the lyrics that begin &quot;All People That on Earth Do Dwell,&quot; Psalm 100, a version that originated in the Anglo-Genevan Psalter (1561) and is attributed to the Scottish clergyman William Kethe. Kethe was in exile at Geneva at this time, as the Scottish Reformation was only just beginning. The first verse is as follows:

&lt;poem&gt;All people that on earth do dwell,
Sing to the Lord with cheerful voice;
Him serve with mirth, His praise forth tell;
Come ye before Him and rejoice.&lt;/poem&gt;

This version was sung at the coronation of Queen Elizabeth II in 1953, with harmonization and arrangement by the composer Ralph Vaughan Williams.

A hymn commonly sung to Old 100th is &quot;Praise God, from Whom All Blessings Flow,&quot; using the text often referred to as the Doxology, written in 1674 by Thomas Ken, a bishop in the Church of England. This hymn was originally the final verse of a longer hymn entitled &quot;Awake, My Soul, and With the Sun,&quot; though it is most commonly sung by itself as a doxology. The traditional text is:

&lt;poem&gt;Praise God, from Whom all blessings flow;
Praise Him, all creatures here below;
Praise Him above, ye heavenly host;
Praise Father, Son, and Holy Ghost.&lt;/poem&gt;

In the United States, this version is particularly emblematic of Mainline Protestant churches, and often evokes nostalgia among churchgoers. Different versions of that text are also widely used, including nontrinitarian and gender neutral variations. 

The melody can be used for any hymn text in long meter, that is, with four lines of eight syllables in iambic feet. The hymn &quot;From all that dwell below the skies&quot;, a paraphrasing of Psalm 117 by Isaac Watts with the Doxology as the final verse, is commonly sung to the tune. In the Sacred Harp and other shape note singing traditions, the tune is sung with the text &quot;O Come, Loud Anthems Let Us Sing,&quot; a metrical paraphrase of Psalm 95 from Tate and Brady&#x27;s &quot;A New Version of the Psalms of David.&quot; The popular Hawaiian version &quot;Hoʻonani i ka Makua mau&quot; was translated by Hiram Bingham I and is published in hymnals.

==Tune==

The tune first appeared in the Genevan Psalter, coupled with French metrical text for Psalm 134. Over the years, the tune was sometimes rhythmically modified. Below it is as set by Johann Sebastian Bach in the final movement of his cantata (BWV 130).

*&quot;Voluntary on the Old Hundredth&quot; – also called &quot;The 100th Psalm tune. Set as a Lesson&quot;. This is an organ piece using the psalm tune as a theme, not unlike a chorale prelude, and was meant for church use. Authorship is somewhat dubious, the piece was either written by John Blow or his student Henry Purcell.
* &quot;Herr Gott, dich loben alle wir&quot;, a hymn in twelve stanzas by Paul Eber after Philipp Melanchthon&#x27;s &quot;Dicimus grates tibi&quot;, for Michaelmas, is sung to the same tune (Zahn No. 368). Johann Sebastian Bach harmonized this hymn in the chorale cantata BWV 130, and in the four-part chorales BWV 326 and BWV 327.
*Hubert Parry – &quot;Three Chorale Fantasias&quot; is based on the Old 100th.
*Virgil Thomson – quoted in several movements of his score for &quot;The Plow that Broke the Plains&quot; (1936).
*Paul Hindemith – quoted in his &quot;Trauermusik&quot; (January 1936).

*Ralph Vaughan Williams – The Old 100th Psalm Tune (&quot;All people that on earth do dwell&quot;) – originally composed for the 1953 coronation of Queen Elizabeth II; with a brass fanfare and borrowing a fauxbourdon setting by John Dowland.
*The 1893 song &quot;The Volunteer Organist&quot; by George Spaulding features the Old Hundredth in its refrain - it is played by the piano and is harmonised to an original vocal melody. 
*In The Adventures of Tom Sawyer by Mark Twain, the congregation sings &quot;Old Hundredth&quot; (called &quot;Old Hundred&quot; here) to celebrate the reappearance of Tom Sawyer, Huck Finn and Joe Harper at the funeral service being held for them after they had gone missing and were presumed dead. 
*Patrick O&#x27;Brian makes frequent reference to it in his Aubrey–Maturin series of historical fiction novels, as being one of the traditional hymns sung by the sailors on Sundays.

&quot;Old Hundred&quot; was the first work transmitted by telephone during Graham Bell first demo at the American Academy of Arts and Sciences (Boston, May 10, 1876).

<text>Simon Jenko (October 27, 1835 – October 18, 1869) was a Slovene poet, lyricist and writer.

Jenko was born in Podreča in the Sora Plain (&quot;Sorško polje&quot;) in Upper Carniola, then part of the Austrian Empire, now in Slovenia, as an illegitimate son of poor peasant parents. Later he moved with his parents to Praše, which was the very inspiration for most of his poems and short stories. The local clergy enabled him to study in Novo Mesto, Klagenfurt, and Ljubljana. Contrary to their will, however, Jenko decided not to become a priest, but enrolled at the University of Vienna, where he studied law, classical philology, and history.

Together with Fran Levstik, Josip Jurčič, Josip Stritar, Simon Gregorčič, and Fran Erjavec, he belonged to the group of prominent Slovenes that embraced a progressive and nationalist political ideology (often with Pan-Slavic elements) and introduced literary realism in Slovenian literature. He mostly wrote lyrical and patriotic poems, which reveal an influence of late romanticism. He also wrote short prose in a realistic style.

He was the cousin of the composer Davorin Jenko. The two composed the song &quot;Naprej zastava slave&quot; together, which used to be the unofficial Slovenian national anthem up to the 1980s.

He died in Kranj.

The Jenko Award bestowed each year for the best poetry collection in Slovene published in the previous two years by the Slovene Writers&#x27; Association is named after Simon Jenko.

<text>Caitlyn Marie Jenner (born William Bruce Jenner; October 28, 1949), formerly known as Bruce Jenner, is an American media personality and retired Olympic gold medal-winning decathlete.

Jenner played college football for the Graceland Yellowjackets before incurring a knee injury that required surgery. Convinced by Olympic decathlete Jack Parker&#x27;s coach, L. D. Weldon, to try the decathlon, Jenner had a six-year decathlon career, culminating in winning the men&#x27;s decathlon event at the 1976 Summer Olympics in Montreal, setting a third successive world record and gaining fame as &quot;an all-American hero&quot;. Jenner established a career in television, film, writing, auto racing, business, and as a &quot;Playgirl&quot; cover model.

Jenner has six children with three successive wivesChrystie Crownover, Linda Thompson, and Kris Jennerand from 2007 to 2021 appeared on the reality television series &quot;Keeping Up with the Kardashians&quot; with Kris, their daughters Kendall and Kylie Jenner, as well as Kris&#x27;s other children from her previous marriage, Kourtney, Kim, Khloé, and Rob Kardashian.

Jenner publicly came out as a trans woman in April 2015, announcing her new name in July of that year. From 2015 to 2016, she starred in the reality television series &quot;I Am Cait&quot;, which focused on her gender transition. At the time of her coming out, she had been called the most famous trans woman in the world. Jenner is a transgender rights activist, although her views on transgender issues have been criticized by many other LGBTQ+ activists.

A member of the Republican Party, Jenner ran in the 2021 California gubernatorial recall election, finishing 13th with one percent of the vote. Six months after the election, Jenner was hired by Fox News as an on-air contributor.

== Early life ==

Caitlyn Marie Jenner was born on October 28, 1949, in Mount Kisco, New York, as William Bruce Jenner, and was known as Bruce until June 2015. Her parents are Esther Ruth (&quot;née&quot; McGuire) and William Hugh Jenner, who was an arborist originally from New Brunswick, Canada. She is of English, Scottish, Irish, Dutch, and Welsh descent. Jenner&#x27;s younger brother, Burt, was killed in a car accident in Canton, Connecticut, on November 30, 1976, shortly after Jenner&#x27;s success at the Olympic Games. As a child, Jenner was diagnosed with dyslexia.

===Education===
Jenner attended Sleepy Hollow High School in Sleepy Hollow, New York, for freshman and sophomore year and Newtown High School in Newtown, Connecticut, for junior and senior year, graduating in 1968. Jenner earned a football athletic scholarship and attended Graceland College in Lamoni, Iowa, but was forced to stop playing football because of a knee injury. Recognizing Jenner&#x27;s potential, Graceland track coach L. D. Weldon encouraged Jenner to switch to the decathlon. Jenner debuted as a decathlete in 1970 in the Drake Relays decathlon in Des Moines, Iowa, finishing in fifth place. Jenner graduated from Graceland College in 1973 with a degree in physical education.

== Decathlon career ==

=== Early career ===

At the 1972 U.S. Olympic Trials at Hayward Field in Eugene, Oregon, Jenner was eleventh after the first day in the men&#x27;s decathlon, and climbed to fifth behind Steve Gough and Andrew Pettes with one event remaining on the Fourth of July. Needing to make up a 19-second gap on Gough in the 1500 meters, Jenner qualified for the Olympic team by finishing first, 22 seconds ahead of the others. This prompted the &quot;Eugene Register-Guard&quot; to ask: &quot;Who&#x27;s Jenner?&quot; Following the trials, Jenner was tenth in the decathlon at the 1972 Summer Olympics in Munich, West Germany. By watching Soviet Mykola Avilov win the event, Jenner was inspired to start an intense training regimen. &quot;For the first time, I knew what I wanted out of life and that was it, and this guy has it. I literally started training that night at midnight, running through the streets of Munich, Germany, training for the Games. I trained that day on through the 1976 Games, 6–8 hours a day, every day, 365 days a year.&quot;

After graduating from Graceland, Jenner married girlfriend Chrystie Crownover and moved to San Jose, California. Crownover provided most of the family income as a flight attendant for United Airlines. Jenner trained during the day and sold insurance at night, earning a year. In the era before professional athletes were allowed to compete in Olympic sports, this kind of training was unheard of. On the other hand, Soviet athletes were state sponsored, which gave them an advantage over amateur American athletes. During this period, Jenner trained at the San Jose City College (SJCC) and San Jose State University (SJSU) tracks. San Jose athletics centered on SJCC coach Bert Bonanno; at that time, the city was a hotbed for training and was called the &quot;Track Capital of the World&quot;. Many other aspiring Olympic athletes also trained at San Jose; the list included Millard Hampton, Andre Phillips, John Powell, Mac Wilkins, and Al Feuerbach. Jenner&#x27;s best events were on day two of the decathlon: hurdles, discus, pole vault, javelin, and 1500 meters.

=== Olympic success ===

Jenner was the American champion in the men&#x27;s decathlon event in 1974, and was featured on the cover of &quot;Track &amp; Field News&quot; magazine&#x27;s August 1974 issue. While on tour in 1975, Jenner won the French national championship, and a gold medal at the 1975 Pan American Games, setting the tournament record with 8,045 points. This was followed by world records of 8,524 points at the U.S.A./U.S.S.R./Poland triangular meet in Eugene, Oregon, on August 9–10, 1975, breaking Avilov&#x27;s record, and 8,538 points at the 1976 Olympic trials, also in Eugene. The second Eugene record was a hybrid score because of a timing system failure and it was wind aided. Still, Jenner was proud of &quot;A nice little workout, huh?&quot;

Of the 13 decathlons Jenner competed in between 1973 and 1976, the only loss was at the 1975 AAU National Championships, when a &quot;no height&quot; in the pole vault marred the score.

At the 1976 Olympic Games in Montreal, Jenner achieved personal bests in all five events on the first day of the men&#x27;s decathlona &quot;home run&quot;despite being in second place behind Guido Kratschmer of West Germany. Jenner was confident: &quot;The second day has all my good events. If everything works out all right, we should be ahead after it&#x27;s all over.&quot; Following a rainstorm on the second day, Jenner watched teammate Fred Dixon get injured in the 110 meter hurdles and so adopted a cautious approach to the hurdles and discus, then had personal bests in the pole vault, when Jenner took the lead, and javelin. At that point, victory was virtually assured, and it remained to be seen by how much Jenner would improve the record. In the final event – the 1500 meters, which was seen live on national television – Jenner looked content to finish the long competition. Jenner sprinted the last lap, making up a 50-meter deficit and nearly catching the event favorite, Soviet Leonid Litvinenko, who was already well out of contention for the gold medal, and whose personal best had been eight seconds better than Jenner&#x27;s personal best before the race. Jenner set a new personal best time and won the gold medal with a world-record score of 8,618 points.

Olympic world record performance:
=== Impact ===
After the event, Jenner took an American flag from a spectator and carried it during the victory lap, starting a tradition that became common among winning athletes. Abandoning the vaulting poles in the stadium, with no intention of ever competing again, Jenner stated that: &quot;In 1972, I made the decision that I would go four years and totally dedicate myself to what I was doing, and then I would move on after it was over with. I went into that competition knowing that would be the last time I would ever do this.&quot; Jenner explained, &quot;It hurts every day when you practice hard. Plus, when this decathlon is over, I got the rest of my life to recuperate. Who cares how bad it hurts?&quot;

Jenner became a national hero and received the James E. Sullivan Award as the top amateur athlete in the United States. Jenner was named the Associated Press Male Athlete of the Year in 1976.

Jenner&#x27;s 1976 world and Olympic record was broken by four points by Daley Thompson at the 1980 Olympics in Moscow. In 1985, Jenner&#x27;s Olympic decathlon score was reevaluated against the IAAF&#x27;s updated decathlon scoring table and was reported as 8,634 for comparative purposes. This converted mark stood as the American record until 1991, when it was surpassed by eventual gold medalist, and world record holder, Dan O&#x27;Brien of Dan &amp; Dave fame. , Jenner was ranked twenty-sixth on the world all-time list and ninth on the American all-time list.

Jenner was inducted into the United States National Track and Field Hall of Fame in 1980, the Olympic Hall of Fame in 1986, the Bay Area Sports Hall of Fame and the Connecticut Sports Hall of Fame in 1994, and the San Jose Sports Hall of Fame in 2010. For almost 20 years, San Jose City College hosted an annual Bruce Jenner Invitational competition.

== Post-Olympic career ==

=== Capitalizing on Olympic fame ===

In the 1970s, Olympic athletes were considered to be amateurs and were not allowed to seek or accept payment for their positions as sports celebrities. During the Cold War in 1972, three major Olympic titles that had a long history of American successbasketball, the 100-meter dash, and decathlonwere won by Soviet athletes. All Soviet athletes were professionals, while the United States was limited to amateurs. Jenner became an American hero by returning the decathlon title to the United States. &quot;After the Games were over,&quot; Jenner said, &quot;I happened to be the right guy, at that right place, at that right time.&quot; Tony Kornheiser of &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote that along with their wife, Chrystie, Jenner was &quot;so high up on the pedestal of American heroism, it would take a crane to get them down.&quot;

After the expected Olympic success, Jenner planned to cash in on whatever celebrity status could follow a gold medal in the same mold as Johnny Weissmuller and Sonja Henie, who had become major movie stars following their gold medals. This would require forgoing any future Olympic competition. At the time, Jenner&#x27;s agent George Wallach felt there was a four-year windowuntil the next Olympicsupon which to capitalize. Wallach reported that Jenner was being considered for the role of &quot;Superman&quot;, which ultimately went to Christopher Reeve. &quot;I really don&#x27;t know how many offers we have&quot;, Wallach claimed. &quot;There are still unopened telegrams back at the hotel and you just can&#x27;t believe the offers that poured in during the first two days.&quot;

Jenner appeared on the cover of the August 9, 1976, issue of &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot;, the February 1979 issue of &quot;Gentleman&#x27;s Quarterly&quot;, and on the cover of &quot;Playgirl&quot; magazine. Jenner became a spokesperson for Tropicana, Minolta, and Buster Brown shoes. Jenner was also selected by the Kansas City Kings with the 139th overall pick in the seventh round of the 1977 NBA draft despite not having played basketball since high school. The publicity stunt was executed by team president/general manager Joe Axelson to mock the Kansas City Chiefs&#x27; yearly claims that they planned on selecting &quot;the best athlete available&quot; in the National Football League Draft. Jenner was presented with a jersey customized with the number 8618, the Olympic gold medal-winning score, but would never appear as an active player with the Kings.
==== Wheaties spokesperson ====


In 1977, Jenner became a spokesperson for Wheaties brand breakfast cereal and appeared in a photograph on the cover of the cereal box. After taking over from Olympic champion Bob Richards, Jenner was second in a succession of athletes featured as spokespersons for the brand. Mary Lou Retton succeeded Jenner in 1984.

On November 22, 1977, Jenner went to San Francisco to refute charges filed by San Francisco district attorney Joseph Freitas that General Mills, the maker of Wheaties, had engaged in deceptive advertising in its campaign that featured Jenner. Jenner liked Wheaties and ate the breakfast cereal two or three times a week, which supported the advertising campaign&#x27;s claims. Two days later, Freitas withdrew the suit, saying that it was &quot;a case of overzealousness&quot; on the part of his staff.

When Jenner came out as a trans woman in 2015, General Mills stated that: &quot;Bruce Jenner continues to be a respected member of Team Wheaties.&quot; After a negative response to this initial statement, Mike Siemienas, General Mills&#x27;s brand media relations manager, clarified it by saying: &quot;Bruce Jenner has been a respected member of Team Wheaties, and Caitlyn Jenner will continue to be.&quot;

=== Television and film career ===
Jenner began television appearances in the mid-1970s, both as herself and in character roles. One of Jenner&#x27;s first recurring television roles was as a co-host of the short-lived daytime talk and variety series &quot;America Alive!&quot; in 1978. The comedy &quot;Can&#x27;t Stop the Music&quot; (1980) was Jenner&#x27;s first film appearance. She starred in the made-for-TV movies &quot;The Golden Moment: An Olympic Love Story&quot; (1980) and &quot;Grambling&#x27;s White Tiger&quot; (1981). During the 1981–1982 season, Jenner became a semi-regular cast member in the police series &quot;CHiPs&quot;, guest-starring as Officer Steve McLeish for six episodes, substituting for star Erik Estrada, who was locked in a contract dispute with NBC and MGM. Jenner also revealed personal issues with dyslexia in a 1985 episode of the sitcom &quot;Silver Spoons&quot; called &quot;Trouble with Words&quot;.

Jenner appeared in the series &quot;Learn to Read&quot; and in the video games &quot;Olympic Decathlon&quot; (1981) and &quot;Bruce Jenner&#x27;s World Class Decathlon&quot; (1996). The &quot;hero shot&quot;, the finish of the final event of the 1976 Olympic decathlon, and the Wheaties cover, were parodied by John Belushi on &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;, endorsing &quot;Little Chocolate Donuts&quot;. In 1989, Jenner played herself in the comedy short &quot;Dirty Tennis&quot; written by James Van Patten.
Jenner has appeared in a variety of game shows and reality television programs, including starring with Grits Gresham in an episode of &quot;The American Sportsman&quot;. In the early 1990s, Jenner was the host of an infomercial for a stair-climbing exercise machine called the Stair Climber Plus.

In January 2002, Jenner participated in an episode of the American series &quot;The Weakest Link&quot;, featuring Olympic athletes. In February and March 2003, Jenner was part of the cast of the American series &quot;I&#x27;m a Celebrity...Get Me Out of Here!&quot;. She made a cameo appearance in a season-three episode of &quot;The Apprentice&quot;, which aired in May 2005. She also partnered with Tai Babilonia for &quot;Skating with Celebrities&quot; in a series that aired JanuaryMarch 2006 (they were eliminated during the fifth of seven episodes), served as a guest judge on &quot;Pet Star&quot; on Animal Planet. In November 2010, a photograph of Jenner was shown in a janitor&#x27;s resume in an episode of &quot;It&#x27;s Always Sunny in Philadelphia&quot;.

Additional television and talk show appearances by Jenner include: Nickelodeon&#x27;s made-for-TV film &quot;Gym Teacher: The Movie&quot; as well as episodes of &quot;Murder, She Wrote&quot;, the &quot;Lingo&quot; Olympic Winners episode, and talk shows such as &quot;Hannity&quot; and season1, episode21 of &quot;The Bonnie Hunt Show&quot; in 2008.

Since late 2007, Jenner has starred in the E! reality series &quot;Keeping Up with the Kardashians&quot; along with wife Kris Jenner, stepchildren Kourtney, Kimberley, Khloé, and Rob Kardashian (from Kris&#x27;s marriage to attorney Robert Kardashian), and daughters Kylie and Kendall for 160 episodes.

In 2011, Jenner appeared in the Adam Sandler comedy &quot;Jack and Jill&quot; in a scene with Al Pacino as an actor in a play. Like &quot;Can&#x27;t Stop the Music&quot;, the film won the Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Picture and swept every Razzie category.

In September 2016, Jenner appeared in the Amazon Prime TV series &quot;Transparent&quot; in a dream sequence during the season three episode &quot;To Sardines and Back&quot;.

In November 2019, it was announced that Jenner would be participating in the nineteenth season of the British version of &quot;I&#x27;m a Celebrity...Get Me Out of Here!&quot; after having previously appeared on the American iteration in 2003. Jenner ultimately placed sixth in the competition.

In 2021, Jenner appeared as a contestant in season five of &quot;The Masked Singer&quot; as &quot;Phoenix&quot;, being the second contestant to be unmasked and the first of Group B and the show&#x27;s first transgender contestant. That same year, Jenner appeared in the Australian version of &quot;Big Brother VIP&quot;. In 2022, Fox News hired Jenner as an on-air contributor.

=== Motorsports career ===
Jenner had a short career as a race car driver in the IMSA Camel GT series (International Motor Sports Association) in the 1980s. Jenner&#x27;s first victory came in the 1986 12 hours of Sebring in the IMSA GTO class driving the 7-Eleven Roush Racing Ford Mustang with co-driver Scott Pruett. The pair won their class and finished 4th overall in the 12-hour endurance race. 1986 was also the most successful year of Jenner&#x27;s career, finishing second in the championship to Pruett. Jenner commented, &quot;I was a lot more badass runner than I was a driver.&quot;

Jenner also competed in the Toyota Pro/Celebrity Race at the Grand Prix of Long Beach, winning in 1979 and 1982. The former win came after holding off Al Unser, while the latter saw Jenner pass Ted Nugent with two laps remaining. In 1980, Jenner was contacted by NASCAR Winston Cup Series team DiGard Motorsports about driving the No. 88 car for the 1981 season; although Jenner expressed interest, Ricky Rudd was ultimately hired for the seat.

In 2022, Jenner founded Jenner Racing, a team in the all-female W Series open-wheel championship. The team lasted just one year before the series folded midseason, though their driver Jamie Chadwick was declared the champion as the points leader when the final races were canceled.

=== Business ===
Jenner had licensed her previous name for &quot;Bruce Jenner&#x27;s Westwood Centers for Nautilus &amp; Aerobics&quot; in the early 1980s to David A. Cirotto, president of other local Nautilus &amp; Aerobics Centers. She had no ownership in the licensed name centers, which were solely owned by Cirotto. Jenner&#x27;s company, Bruce Jenner Aviation, sells aircraft supplies to executives and corporations. Jenner was the business development vice president for a staffing industry software application known as JennerNet, which was based on Lotus Domino technology.

In March 2016, Jenner announced that she had been chosen as the face of H&amp;M Sport. Later that year, H&amp;M created a six-minute film featuring Jenner, called &quot;Caitlyn Jenner&#x27;s Greatest Victories: A Timeline&quot;.

== Personal life ==

=== Marriages ===
Prior to gender transition, Jenner had been married three times, first to Chrystie Scott ( Crownover) from 1972 to 1981. They have two children, including son Burt. Jenner and Scott&#x27;s divorce was finalized the first week of January 1981.

On January 5, 1981, Jenner married songwriter Linda Thompson in Hawaii. They have two sons together, Brandon and Brody. By February 1986, Jenner and Thompson had separated and subsequently divorced. Their sons later starred on the reality show &quot;The Princes of Malibu&quot;, and Brody appeared in the reality show &quot;The Hills&quot;.

On April 21, 1991, Jenner married Kris Kardashian ( Houghton) after five months of dating. They have two daughters, Kendall and Kylie. While married, Jenner was also the step-parent to Kris&#x27;s children from her previous marriageKourtney, Kim, Khloé and Robwho star in &quot;Keeping Up with the Kardashians&quot;. The couple separated in June 2013, but the separation was not made public until four months later, in October. Kris filed for divorce in September 2014, citing irreconcilable differences. Their divorce terms were finalized in December 2014 and went into effect on March 23, 2015, as mandated by a state legal requirement for a six-months delay after the filing.

=== Fatal car collision ===

In February 2015, Jenner was involved in a fatal multiple-vehicle collision on the Pacific Coast Highway in Malibu, California. Kim Howe, an animal rights activist and actress, was killed when Jenner&#x27;s SUV ran into Howe&#x27;s car. Accounts of the sequence of collisions have varied, as have the number of people injured.

Prosecutors declined to file criminal charges, but three civil lawsuits were filed against Jenner by Howe&#x27;s stepchildren and drivers of other cars involved in the collision. Jessica Steindorff, a Hollywood agent who was hit by Howe&#x27;s car, settled her case in December 2015. Howe&#x27;s stepchildren settled their case in January 2016. Financial details were not disclosed in either case.

== Gender transition ==

=== Coming out as a transgender woman ===

In a &quot;20/20&quot; television interview with Diane Sawyer in April 2015, Jenner came out as a trans woman, saying that she had dealt with gender dysphoria since her youth and that, &quot;for all intents and purposes, I&#x27;m a woman.&quot; Jenner wore women&#x27;s clothing for many years and took hormone replacement therapy but stopped after her romance with Kris Kardashian became more serious, leading to marriage in 1991. Jenner recounts having permission to explore her gender identity on her travels but not when they were coupled, and not knowing the best way to talk about the many issues contributed to the deterioration of the 23-year-long marriage, which ended formally in 2015.

In 2015, Jenner said that she has never been sexually attracted to men, but always to women, and that, given the difficulty that many people have understanding the difference between sexual orientation and gender identity, she would identify as asexual for the time being. Jenner underwent cosmetic surgery and completed gender-affirming surgery in January 2017.

=== Media attention ===

In June 2015, Jenner debuted her new name and image, and began publicly using feminine pronoun self-descriptors. Jenner held a renaming ceremony in July 2015, adopting the name &quot;Caitlyn Marie Jenner&quot;. Before her &quot;20/20&quot; interview, a two-part special titled &quot;Keeping Up with the Kardashians: About Bruce&quot; was filmed with the family in which she answered questions, and prepared her children for the personal and public aspects of the transition. In the special, which aired in May 2015, the point was emphasized that there is no one right way to transition. Jenner made it a priority to ensure that all her children were independent first before focusing on her transition. In September 2015, her name was legally changed to Caitlyn Marie Jenner and her gender to female.

Jenner&#x27;s announcement that she is transgender came at an unprecedented time for trans visibility, including legislative initiatives. The &quot;20/20&quot; interview had 20.7 million viewers, making it television&#x27;s &quot;highest-ever rated newsmagazine telecast among adults 1849 and adults 2554&quot;. &quot;The Daily Beast&quot; wrote that Jenner&#x27;s honesty, vulnerability, and fame may have caused &quot;cheap jokes&quot; about trans people to &quot;seem mean to a mainstream audience on an unprecedented scale&quot;. Noting the shift in how comedians treated Jenner&#x27;s transition, &quot;The Daily Beast&quot; saw the change as the same evolution that took place in acceptance of LGBT people as a whole when &quot;comedians finally cross the critical threshold from mockery to creativity in their joke-telling&quot;.

Jenner&#x27;s emerging gender identity was revealed in a &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; interview written by Buzz Bissinger. Annie Leibovitz photographed the cover, the magazine&#x27;s first to feature an openly transgender woman, which was captioned &quot;Call me Caitlyn&quot;. Using her Twitter handle, &quot;@Caitlyn_Jenner&quot;, she tweeted: &quot;I&#x27;m so happy after such a long struggle to be living my true self. Welcome to the world Caitlyn. Can&#x27;t wait for you to get to know her/me.&quot; &quot;Time&quot; magazine declared this tweet the tenth most retweeted tweet of 2015, based on retweets of tweets by verified users from January 1 to November 10 of that year. Jenner amassed over one million Twitter followers in four hours and three minutes, setting a new Guinness World Record and surpassing United States President Barack Obama, who, a month before, accomplished the same feat in four hours and fifty-two minutes. Four days later Jenner was up to 2.37million followers, with another 1.5million followers on Instagram.

Jenner was also mocked. Beginning in September 2015, she was depicted on the satirical American animated program &quot;South Park&quot;, which parodied her supporters&#x27; political correctness, as well as her driving record. The Jenner-related episodes were &quot;Stunning and Brave&quot;, &quot;Where My Country Gone?&quot;, &quot;Sponsored Content&quot;, &quot;Truth and Advertising&quot; and &quot;PC Principal Final Justice&quot; from the show&#x27;s 19th season.

In April 2016 during the Republican presidential primaries, Jenner became an exemplar for candidate Donald Trump&#x27;s opposition to North Carolina&#x27;s Public Facilities Privacy &amp; Security Act, with Trump saying that Jenner could use any restroom of her choosing at his Trump Tower property. Jenner soon posted a video showing that she had taken Trump up on his offer. She thanked Trump and assured Trump&#x27;s adversary Ted Cruz that &quot;nobody got molested&quot;.

In June 2016, Jenner was one of several celebrities depicted using synthetic nude &quot;sleeping&quot; bodies for the video of Kanye West&#x27;s song &quot;Famous&quot;. Later that month, an episode of &quot;Epic Rap Battles of History&quot; was released featuring Jenner, as Bruce (portrayed by Peter Shukoff) and then Caitlyn (portrayed by transgender rapper Jolie &quot;NoShame&quot; Drake), rap battling against Bruce Banner (portrayed by Lloyd Ahlquist) then The Hulk (portrayed by Mike O&#x27;Hearn).

=== Reception ===

==== General ====

In August 2015, Jenner won the Social Media Queen award at the Teen Choice Awards. In October 2015, &quot;Glamour&quot; magazine named her one of its 25Glamour Women of the Year, calling her a &quot;Trans Champion&quot;. In November 2015, Jenner was listed as one of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; 2015 Entertainers of the Year. In December 2015, she was named Barbara Walters&#x27; Most Fascinating Person of 2015. Also in that month, she was listed on &quot;Time&quot; magazine&#x27;s eight-person shortlist for the 2015 Person of the Year, and Bing released its list of the year&#x27;s &quot;Most Searched Celebrities&quot;, which Jenner was at the top of, and declared Jenner&#x27;s &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; cover the second in a list of &quot;top celeb moments of 2015&quot;. She was the second most searched-for person on Google in 2015. In April 2016, she was listed in the &quot;Time&quot; 100. In June 2016, Jenner became the first openly transgender person to be featured on the cover of &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot;. The cover and associated story marked the 40th anniversary of her winning the 1976 Summer Olympics decathlon.

Feminist author Germaine Greer called &quot;Glamour&quot; magazine&#x27;s decision to award Jenner with a &quot;Woman of the Year&quot; award misogynistic, questioning whether a transgender woman could be better than &quot;someone who is just born a woman.&quot; Jenner also received criticism from individuals such as actress Rose McGowan, for statingin a BuzzFeed interview that the hardest part about being a woman &quot;is figuring out what to wear&quot;. McGowan argued: &quot;We are more than deciding what to wear. We are more than the stereotypes foisted upon us by people like you. You&#x27;re a woman now? Well fucking learn that we have had a VERY different experience than your life of male privilege.&quot; McGowan later stated that she was not transphobic, and added: &quot;Disliking something a trans person has said is no different than disliking something a man has said or that a woman has said. Being trans doesn&#x27;t make one immune from criticism.&quot;

Chris Mandle of &quot;The Independent&quot; stated: &quot;Jenner has gone on to inspire countless men and women, but her comments, which were made after she was celebrated at &quot;Glamour&quot; magazine&#x27;s Women Of The Year in New York were branded &#x27;offensive and insulting&#x27;.&quot; He added: &quot;People began tweeting the other, harder things women have to deal with, such as institutionalized oppression, abuse, and sexual assault&quot;. James Smith, husband of Moira Smith, the only female New York Police Department officer to die from the September 11 attacks, returned Moira&#x27;s &quot;Woman of the Year&quot; award, given posthumously. Referring to Jenner as a man, he stated that he found &quot;Glamour&quot; giving Jenner the same award insulting to Moira&#x27;s memory, and referred to the matter as a publicity stunt. Smith later said that having supported transgender youth and &quot;Glamour&quot; decision to honor transgender actress Laverne Cox in 2014, he did not object because Jenner is transgender; he objected to Jenner&#x27;s &quot;hardest part about being a woman&quot; commentary; this proved to him that Jenner &quot;is not truly a woman. I believe this comment and others he has made trivializes the transgender experience as I have witnessed it.&quot;

Conversely, Adrienne Tam of &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; argued that Jenner deserved the &quot;Glamour&quot; award, stating: &quot;What McGowan failed to take into consideration was the jesting manner in which Jenner spoke.&quot; Tam said:

Tam considered McGowan&#x27;s criticism to be over the top, and stated of James Smith&#x27;s criticism, &quot;The salient point here is one about courage. We easily recognize physical courage such as saving orphans from burning buildings, or ordinary people putting their lives in the line of fire. It is far harder to recognize mental courage.&quot; She added: &quot;Without a doubt, the police officer who died in the September 11 attacks was courageous. But so is Jenner. It&#x27;s a different kind of courage, but it is courage nonetheless.&quot;

==== LGBT community ====

Since coming out as a trans woman in 2015, Jenner has been called the most famous openly transgender woman in the world. She is also one of the most recognized LGBT people in the world and arguably the most famous LGBT athlete. Jenner said that her visibility was partly to bring attention to gender dysphoria, violence against trans women, and other transgender issues. She also sought to promote more informed discussion of LGBT issues. She signed with Creative Artists Agency&#x27;s speakers department and will collaborate with the CAA Foundation on a philanthropic strategy focusing on LGBT issues. She made a private appearance at the Los Angeles LGBT Center in June 2015, where she spoke with trans youth.
Jenner received the Arthur Ashe Courage Award during the 2015 ESPY Awards in July 2015. ESPN executive producer Maura Mandt said Jenner was given the award because &quot;she has shown the courage to embrace a truth that had been hidden for years, and to embark on a journey that may not only give comfort to those facing similar circumstances but can also help to educate people on the challenges that the transgender community faces.&quot; She is the third consecutive openly LGBT person to receive the award following footballer Michael Sam (2014) and anchorwoman Robin Roberts (2013).

In October, Jenner presented the Point Foundation&#x27;s Horizon Award to television producers Rhys Ernst (of the show &quot;Transparent&quot;) and Zach Zyskowski (of the show &quot;Becoming Us&quot;). This was her second public speaking engagement after her gender transition.

In November, Jenner was listed as one of the nine runners-up for &quot;The Advocate&quot; Person of the Year. That month she was also listed as one of the &quot;Out100&quot; of 2015, with &quot;Out&quot; magazine calling her the &quot;Newsmaker of the Year.&quot; On International Human Rights Day, Jenner discussed transgender rights with Samantha Power, the U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations. In 2016, Jenner was on the cover of &quot;The Advocate&quot; February/March issue.

MAC Cosmetics collaborated with Jenner on a lipstick, called Finally Free, which was made available for purchase on April 8, 2016, with MAC stating, &quot;100% of the selling price goes to the MAC AIDS Fund Transgender Initiative, to further its work in support of transgender communities.&quot; Also in April 2016, Jenner was listed as No.8 on &quot;Out&quot; magazine&#x27;s Power 50 list. In May 2016, her interview with Diane Sawyer in 2015 won Outstanding TV JournalismNewsmagazine at the GLAAD Media Awards.

In 2021, Jenner&#x27;s decision to run for governor of California was met with pushback from many LGBT activists and trans people, with activists criticizing Jenner for her views on transgender issues and support for the Republican Party. Katelyn Burns of &quot;Vox&quot; said, &quot;Jenner&#x27;s politics and controversial existence as a self-professed trans advocate has long put trans Americans in a double bind, forcing them to defend her from transphobic attacks while deploring her political views.&quot; This decision became even more controversial following Jenner&#x27;s opposition to trans girls in girls&#x27; sports, with some advocates saying that Jenner &quot;did not represent the broader LGBT community&quot;.

In 2022, Jenner said that trans swimmer Lia Thomas was not the &quot;rightful winner&quot; of the NCAA Division I women&#x27;s 500-yard freestyle event, adding &quot;It&#x27;s not transphobic or anti-trans, it&#x27;s COMMON SENSE!&quot;.

==== Show and memoir ====
Jenner&#x27;s gender transition is the subject of &quot;I Am Cait&quot;, initially an eight-part TV documentary series, which premiered on E! in July 2015 to an audience of 2.7 million viewers. Jenner is an executive producer of the show. The show focuses on Jenner&#x27;s transition and how it affects her relationships with her family and friends. The show also explores how Jenner adjusts to what she sees as her job as a role model for the transgender community. In October 2015, the show was renewed for a second season, which premiered on March 6, 2016. The show tied for Outstanding Reality Program at the GLAAD Media Awards in 2016.

Jenner&#x27;s memoir, &quot;The Secrets of My Life&quot;, was published on April 25, 2017.

== Politics ==
Jenner leans towards political conservatism and is a Republican. She describes herself as socially liberal and fiscally conservative. &quot;I have gotten more flak for being a conservative Republican than I have for being trans&quot;, she has said. Although stopping short of an endorsement, Jenner said she liked Ted Cruz in the 2016 Republican presidential primaries. On her reality show &quot;I Am Cait&quot;, Jenner said that although she does not support Donald Trump, she thinks he would be good for women&#x27;s issues; she then stated she would never support Hillary Clinton. Jenner said she voted for Trump in the 2016 presidential election, although according to &quot;Politico&quot;, voter records show she never cast a ballot in the election.

In February 2017, President Trump rescinded federal requirements giving transgender students the right to choose the school restroom matching their gender identity. In response, Jenner tweeted &quot;Well @realDonaldTrump, from one Republican to another, this is a disaster. You made a promise to protect the LGBTQ community. Call me.&quot;

In April 2017, Jenner said she was in favor of same-sex marriage.

In July 2017, Jenner stated that she was contemplating running in the 2018 race for the U.S. Senate to represent California. Later in the month, she condemned Trump for issuing an order to reinstate a ban on transgender people from serving in the military. In her tweet, she wrote &quot;What happened to your promise to fight for them?&quot;, juxtaposing it with Trump&#x27;s tweet from June 2016 in which he promised to fight for the LGBT community.

In October 2018, Jenner withdrew her support of Donald Trump; she felt &quot;that the trans community was relentlessly attacked by [Trump]&quot;, contrary to her expectations. Her reversal came after a Trump administration proposal to restrict the legal definition of a person&#x27;s gender to that assigned at birth.

In September 2021, Jenner supported the Texas Heartbeat Act which made all post-six-week abortions illegal. She told CNN: “I&#x27;m for a woman’s right to choose. I am also for a state having the ability to make their own laws.” The bill had incurred widespread criticism.

In April 2024, Jenner again reversed her position by supporting Donald Trump in the 2024 presidential election.

===2021 California gubernatorial recall election===

In early April 2021, it was reported that Jenner was considering running for Governor of California in the 2021 recall gubernatorial election as a Republican. Later in the month on April 23, Jenner launched her campaign for governor.

In May 2021, during her run, Jenner stated in an interview with TMZ that trans girls should not be allowed to compete in girls&#x27; sports at school, backing Republican Party views on transgender people in sports. Jenner reiterated her views on Twitter the next day, stating that &quot;it&#x27;s an issue of fairness and we need to protect girls&#x27; sports in our schools.&quot; She has been criticized by many transgender rights advocates who do not see her as an asset to their cause.

In her pitch to voters, Jenner has likened herself to Donald Trump, calling herself a &quot;disrupter&quot; like Trump.

During the campaign, Jenner left the United States, going to Australia in order to compete on that country&#x27;s television series &quot;Big Brother VIP&quot;. Although invited to take part in candidate debates, she did not participate. Jenner fought Governor Gavin Newsom in court to prevent the California Secretary of State from placing Newsom&#x27;s party affiliation on the ballot, and won the legal battle.

Jenner ended up in 13th place with 75,215 votes, which was one percent of the votes cast for replacement candidates.

<text>Sir William Jenner, 1st Baronet (30 January 181511 December 1898) was a significant English physician primarily known for having discovered the distinction between typhus and typhoid.

==Biography==
Jenner was born at Chatham on 30 January 1815, and educated at University College London. He became a Member of the Royal College of Surgeons of England (M.R.C.S.) in 1837, a Fellow of the Royal College of Physicians (F.R.C.P.) in 1852, and in 1844 took the London M.D.

In 1847, he began at the London Fever Hospital investigations into cases of continued fever which enabled him finally to make the distinction between typhus and typhoid on which his reputation as a pathologist principally rests, publishing his book &quot;On the Identity or Non-Identity of Typhoid and Typhus Fever&quot; in 1850. In 1849, he was appointed professor of pathological anatomy at University College, and also assistant physician to University College Hospital, where he afterwards became physician (1854–1876) and consulting physician (1879), besides holding similar appointments at other hospitals. He was also successively Holme Professor of Clinical Medicine and professor of the principles and practice of medicine at University College London.

He was elected President of the Epidemiological Society in 1866–1868, of the Pathological Society in 1873–1875 and of the Clinical Society in 1875. He was president of the Royal College of Physicians from 1881 to 1888 where he had delivered the Goulstonian Lectures in 1853. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society (F.R.S.) in 1864 and received honorary degrees from the University of Oxford, University of Cambridge, and University of Edinburgh. In 1861, he was appointed Physician Extraordinary (Q.H.P.), and in 1862 Physician in Ordinary, to Queen Victoria, and in 1863 Physician in Ordinary to the Prince of Wales; he attended both the Prince Consort and the prince of Wales in their attacks of typhoid fever. In 1868, he was created a baronet.

As a consultant, Sir William Jenner had a great reputation, and he left a large fortune when he died, at Bishops Waltham, Hants, on 11 December 1898, having then retired from practice for eight years owing to failing health. He had married in 1858 Adela Lucy Leman, the daughter of Stephen Adey, with whom he had five sons and a daughter. His son, Leopold, was a decorated Army officer of the First World War.

<text>Jonathan Jennings (March 27, 1784 – July 26, 1834) was an American politician who was the first governor of the State of Indiana and a nine-term congressman from Indiana. Born in either Hunterdon County, New Jersey, or Rockbridge County, Virginia, he studied law before migrating to the Indiana Territory in 1806. Jennings initially intended to practice law, but took jobs as an assistant at the federal land office at Vincennes and assistant to the clerk of the territorial legislature to support himself and pursued interests in land speculation and politics. Jennings became involved in a dispute with the territorial governor, William Henry Harrison, that soon led him to enter politics and set the tone for his early political career. In 1808 Jennings moved to the eastern part of the Indiana Territory and settled near Charlestown, in Clark County. He was elected as the Indiana Territory&#x27;s delegate to the U.S. Congress by dividing the pro-Harrison supporters and running as an anti-Harrison candidate. By 1812, he was the leader of the anti-slavery and pro-statehood faction of the territorial government. Jennings and his political allies took control of the territorial assembly and dominated governmental affairs after the resignation of Governor Harrison in 1812. As a congressional delegate Jennings aided passage of the Enabling Act in 1816, which authorized the organization of Indiana&#x27;s state government and state constitution. He was elected president of the Indiana constitutional convention, held in Corydon in June 1816, where he helped draft the state&#x27;s first constitution. Jennings supported the effort to ban slavery in the state and favored a strong legislative branch of government.

In August 1816, Jennings was elected to serve as the first governor of Indiana at age 32, and re-elected for an additional term. He pressed for the construction of roads and schools, and negotiated the Treaty of St. Mary&#x27;s to open up central Indiana to American settlement. His opponents attacked his participation in the treaty negotiations as unconstitutional and brought impeachment proceedings against him, a measure that was narrowly defeated by a vote of 15 to 13 after a month-long investigation and the resignation of the lieutenant governor. During his second term and following the panic of 1819, Jennings encountered financial problems, a situation exacerbated by his inability to keep up with his business interests and run the state government simultaneously. Ineligible for another term as Indiana governor under the state constitution, Jennings looked for other means of financial support. Shortly before completion of his second term as governor in 1822, Jennings was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives, before retiring from public service in 1831. In Congress Jennings promoted federal spending on internal improvements.

Jennings had been a heavy drinker of alcohol for much of his life. His addiction worsened after the death of his first wife, Ann, and his development of rheumatism. His alcoholism led to defeat in his reelection campaign in 1830. In retirement his condition worsened and he was unable to work his farm. When his finances collapsed, his creditors sought to take his land holdings and Charlestown farm. To protect his friend, U.S. Senator John Tipton purchased Jennings&#x27;s farm and permitted him to continue living there. After Jennings&#x27;s death, his estate was sold, but it left no funds to purchase a headstone for his grave, which remained unmarked for fifty-seven years.

Historians have offered varied interpretations of Jennings&#x27;s life and impact on the development of Indiana. Early state historians, Jacob Piatt Dunn Jr. and William Wesley Woollen, gave Jennings high praise and credited him with the defeat of the pro-slavery forces in Indiana and with laying the foundation of the state. More critical historians during the prohibition era, such as Logan Eseray, described Jennings as a crafty and self-promoting politician and focused on his alcoholism. Among the modern historians, Randy Mills places Jennings&#x27;s importance between the two extremes, but agreed with Woolen&#x27;s assessment that the state &quot;owes him more than she can compute.&quot;

==Early life==
===Family background===
Jonathan Jennings, the son of Jacob and Mary Kennedy Jennings, was born in either Readington Township, Hunterdon County, New Jersey, or Rockbridge County, Virginia, on March 27, 1784. He was the sixth of the Jennings&#x27;s eight children. His father was a doctor, Presbyterian missionary, and an ordained minister in the Dutch Reformed Church. His mother, who was well educated and practiced medicine, was the daughter of Samuel Kennedy, a Presbyterian minister at Basking Ridge, New Jersey. Mary, who may have had a medical degree, assisted her husband in his practice. Around 1790, Jennings&#x27;s father moved the family to Dunlap Creek in Fayette County, Pennsylvania, where Jennings remained until his adulthood. After his mother&#x27;s death in 1792, Jennings was raised by his older sister, Sarah, and his brother, Ebenezer. Jennings was particularly close to Ebenezer and his younger sister, Ann, and her husband, David G. Mitchell, who was a physician. Jennings was schooled at home, then attended the nearby grammar school in Canonsburg, Pennsylvania, where he received a basic education. Two of his classmates, William Hendricks and William W. Wick, would later become his political allies. Jennings studied law in Washington, Pennsylvania. By 1806, Jennings had left Pennsylvania and moved to Steubenville, Ohio, where his brother, Obadiah, had a law office. Jennings helped Obadiah in cases before the Ohio Supreme Court.

In 1806, Jennings headed west to Jeffersonville in the Indiana Territory, but stayed only briefly. He moved to Vincennes, the capital of the Indiana Territory, in early 1807 to open his own law practice and was admitted to the bar in April. Jennings had difficulty earning an income as a lawyer, finding there were too few clients in the territory to keep him busy. In July 1807, Nathaniel Ewing, the federal land receiver at Vincennes and a friend from Pennsylvania, invited Jennings to take a job as assistant to John Badollet, the registrar at the federal land office in Vincennes. Along with Badollet, Jennings engaged in land speculation. He obtained significant land holdings and made substantial profits. In 1807 Jennings became an assistant to the clerk of the territorial legislature and continued to speculate on the sale of public lands.

===Confrontation with Harrison===
In August 1807, Jennings was appointed clerk of the Vincennes University board of trustees and began to be drawn into ongoing political disputes going on territory. The territorial governor, William Henry Harrison, was a member and president of the board. As governor of the Indiana Territory, Harrison wielded considerable influence through his political appointments and veto powers. Jennings received the university appointment after General Washington Johnston resigned as clerk of the board following a dispute over Harrison&#x27;s proposal to ban the French residents of Vincennes from using the university&#x27;s commons. The board defeated Harrison&#x27;s proposal, but Johnston resigned as its clerk and Jennings was selected as his replacement over Henry Hurst, one of Harrison&#x27;s loyal supporters. Harrison was outraged and promptly resigned from the board, but later reconsidered his decision. In September 1807, Harrison was easily reelected to the board and selected as its president. In the meantime, Johnston wrote a pamphlet describing the board&#x27;s proceedings, which Jennings certified without the board&#x27;s knowledge or approval. Jennings further angered Harrison when he attempted to secure a clerkship in the territorial legislature. Jennings&#x27;s opponent for the clerkship was the anti-slavery candidate Davis Floyd, an enemy of Harrison. After Jennings dropped out of the race, Floyd was selected for the position and became an important political ally to Jennings. In April 1808, with Harrison reelected as president of the Vincennes University board, a commission was appointed to investigate Jennings&#x27;s conduct. The committee&#x27;s inquiry concerned Jennings&#x27;s certification of Johnston&#x27;s pamphlet dealing with board proceedings without their knowledge. The incident led to Jennings&#x27;s resignation in 1808 and created a considerable amount of animosity between the two that prevailed for many years.
By March 1808, Jennings believed that his future in the Harrison-dominated western part of the territory was bleak. By November he had left Vincennes and moved to Jeffersonville, in Clark County, Indiana Territory, before settling in nearby Charlestown. Jennings may have believed his political future would have more success in the eastern part of the territory. Settlements in the southeast and eastern portion of the territory opposed slavery and Harrison&#x27;s aristocratic manner, which were similar to Jennings&#x27;s beliefs, while the western portion of the territory and Vincennes area remained proslavery. Although petitions to allow slavery were received before the formation of the Indiana Territory, the issue attracted widespread attention in 1807 when Harrison and his supporters in the territorial legislature revived efforts to allow slavery in the territory. Jennings and his supporters who opposed slavery wrote writing articles appearing in the Vincennes &quot;Western Sun&quot; newspaper attacking Harrison&#x27;s administration, its pro-slavery sentiments, and aristocratic policies.

In 1808, when Congressman Benjamin Parke resigned from office, Harrison ordered a special election to fill the vacancy. Jennings entered the race against Harrison&#x27;s candidate, Thomas Randolph, the attorney general for the territory, and John Johnson, a Vincennes native who had the support of the antislavery group. Randolph promised not to introduce slavery into the territory unless the majority of his constituents agreed, while Johnson remained silent on the issue. Jennings, an antislavery candidate from the eastern portion of the territory, rode from settlement to settlement to give speeches against slavery. Jennings spoke against what he believed to be Randolph&#x27;s aristocratic tendencies, ties to Harrison&#x27;s territorial government, and the issue of slavery in the territory. Jennings found his greatest support among the growing Quaker community in the eastern part of the territory.

On November 27, 1809, Jennings was elected as a delegate to the Eleventh Congress. The election was close. Jennings beat Randolph, 428 votes to 402, with Johnson taking 81 votes. Randolph challenged the election results and traveled to Washington D.C. to take his case to the U.S. House of Representatives. Randolph claimed that election officials in Dearborn County did not follow proper procedures for certifying ninety-one votes in the county&#x27;s seventh district and argued that the votes should be deducted from the vote totals. Once discarded, the revised totals would make Randolph the winner. A House committee took up the case, issued a resolution in Randolph&#x27;s favor, and recommended that a new election be held. Randolph immediately left for the Indiana Territory to launch a new campaign for the seat, but the House defeated the committee&#x27;s recommendation by an 83 to 30 vote margin and Jennings was permitted to take his seat. As a territorial delegate in Congress, Jennings learned the legislative process, served on House committees, introduced legislation, debated issues, and continued his ongoing crusade against Governor Harrison. Jennings did not play a major role in congressional discussions, but he did make an effort to represent the interests of his constituents. He was reelected in 1811, 1812, and 1814.

===Courtship and marriage===
During his first session in Congress, Jennings had a small portrait of himself made, which he later gave to Ann Gilmore Hay, the daughter of a prominent Charlestown politician, whom he had recently begun courting. Hay was born in Harrodsburg, Kentucky, in 1792. Her family moved to Clark County in Indiana Territory, and settled in Charlestown. Jennings first met her when he was campaigning for Congress in 1809. After his first session in Congress ended, Jennings returned to Indiana Territory and married eighteen-year-old Ann on August 8, 1811. Ann&#x27;s father had just died leaving her with no family or means of support. Following his reelection to Congress in 1811, the couple returned to Washington, where she remained briefly, before traveling to Pennsylvania to live with Jennings&#x27;s sister, Ann Mitchell, for the remainder of the session. Jennings&#x27;s wife suffered from ill health, which deteriorated after he became governor of Indiana in 1816, and she died after a protracted illness in 1826. Later that year Jennings married Clarissa Barbee, who had come from Kentucky to teach at the Charlestown seminary. Jennings had no children from either marriage.

==Congressman==
===Battle with Harrison===
Angered over his electoral loss, Randolph harangued anti-Harrison supporters, even challenging one to a duel. He was stabbed three times, but recovered and challenged Jennings in his bid for reelection in 1810. Harrison came out to personally stump on Randolph&#x27;s behalf. Jennings focused on the slavery issue and tied Randolph to Harrison&#x27;s continued attempts to legalize the institution. The congressional election coincided with the first popular election of delegates to the territorial legislature. In 1809, a year prior to the election, the territory&#x27;s pro-slavery faction suffered a significant setback when Illinois was separated from the Indiana Territory, cutting Harrison off from his supporters in the western portion of the territory. Harrison suggested that Jennings further expanded his political base by stumping among the disaffected French residents of the territory. Jennings&#x27;s defeat of Randolph in 1810 repudiated Harrison&#x27;s pro-slavery policies. Following his triumph in the election, Jennings&#x27;s and his anti-slavery allies were successful in enacting a legislative agenda that limited the territorial governor&#x27;s authority and repealed an 1805 act regarding indentured service.

In his first full term in Congress, Jennings stepped up his attacks on Harrison, accusing him of using his office for personal gain, of taking part in questionable land speculation deals, and needlessly raising tensions with the Native American tribes on the frontier. Jennings presented a congressional resolution that intended to reduce Harrison&#x27;s authority to make political appointments and opposed his policy of purchasing lands from the Indians. When Harrison was up for reappointment as territorial governor in 1810, Jennings sent a scathing letter to President James Madison that argued against his reappointment. Harrison&#x27;s allies in Washington argued on his behalf and aided in securing his reappointment.

After hostilities broke out on the frontier between the Americans and the native tribes, culminating in the Battle of Tippecanoe in November 1811, Jennings successfully promoted passage of a bill to grant compensation to veterans of the battle and to give pensions for five years to the widows and orphans of those who were killed. Privately, Jennings lamented the battle, while his friends in the territory faulted Harrison for agitating the situation and causing the needless loss of life. As calls for war with Great Britain increased, Jennings was not among the war hawks, but ultimately accepted the arrival of the War of 1812. Early in the war, Harrison was commissioned as a military general and dispatched to defend the frontier and invade Canada, which caused him to resign from his post as territorial governor in 1812. Prior to Harrison&#x27;s resignation, Jennings and his allies moved quickly to take advantage of the situation and initiated efforts to weaken the governor&#x27;s authority. In 1811, the territorial legislature voted to move the capital away from Vincennes, a pro-Harrison stronghold, and began a shift in political power from the territorial governor to the delegates in the territorial legislature and its elected officials. John Gibson, the elderly, acting governor, whose territorial duties largely dealt with military affairs, did not challenge the territorial legislature. When Harrison&#x27;s successor, Thomas Posey, was confirmed on March 3, 1813, Jennings&#x27;s party in the territorial legislature had become entrenched and began to advance their request for statehood.

Jennings ran for reelection to Congress in 1811 against another pro-slavery candidate, Waller Taylor. The campaign was the most divisive in Jennings&#x27;s career. Taylor derided Jennings as a &quot;pitiful coward&quot; and went so far as to challenge Jennings to a duel, but he refused. Jennings ran on the slavery issue again, fielding his new motto, &quot;No slavery in Indiana&quot;. Jennings&#x27;s supporters tied Taylor, a territorial judge, to the pro-slavery movement. Jennings easily won reelection, thanks to an expanding base of support that included the growing community of Harmonists. Following his reelection, Jennings developed jaundice, an illness often caused by alcoholism, but he recovered. During his third term in Congress, Jennings began advocating that statehood be granted to Indiana, but held off formally introducing legislation until the end of the War of 1812. Jennings ran against Elijah Sparks in his 1814 reelection campaign and easily won.

===Push for statehood===
By 1815 Jennings and the territorial legislature were ready to embark on a course for statehood. In December 1815, Jennings&#x27;s introduced a petition from the territorial legislature to Congress that requested statehood for Indiana. The 1815 census showed the territory had a population exceeding 63,000, more than the minimum requirement for statehood under the Northwest Ordinance of 1787. The House began a debate on the measure and passed the Enabling Act on April 11, 1816. The act granted Indiana the right to form a government and elect delegates to a constitutional convention that would create a state constitution. The territorial governor, Thomas Posey, expressed concern that the territory was too under-populated to provide sufficient tax revenue to fund a state government. In a letter to President Madison, he recommended that the president veto the bill and delay statehood for another three years, which would allow him to finish his term as governor. Madison signed the bill, ignoring Posey&#x27;s plea.

Dennis Pennington, a leading member of the territorial legislature, was able to secure the election of many anti-slavery delegates to the constitutional convention. Jennings was a delegate from Clark County. At the convention, held in June 1816 in the new territorial capital of Corydon, Jennings was elected president of the assembly, which permitted him to appoint the convention&#x27;s committee chairmen. Although the delegates drafted a new constitution for Indiana, the majority of the content was copied from other state constitutions, most notably Ohio and Kentucky.

A few items were new and unique to Indiana. Slavery, which was already prohibited in territorial legislation, was banned in the Indiana constitution; however, contracts for indentured servants, if they were already in existence, were preserved. The new state government, divided into legislative, executive, and judicial branches, gave the governor limited powers and concentrated authority in the hands of the Indiana General Assembly and county officials. Shortly after the convention, Jennings publicly announced his candidacy for governor.

==Governor==
===Campaign and election===
At the state convention in June 1816, Jennings may have informed some of the delegates that he intended to run for governor and by early July 1816 he had publicly announced his candidacy. Thomas Posey, Indiana&#x27;s last territorial governor, was Jennings&#x27;s opponent. Posey announced his own candidacy for governor prior to the convention&#x27;s adjournment on June 29, 1816. With just five weeks before the August 5 election, there was little active campaigning. Posey, who thought Indiana statehood was premature, was not a popular candidate and suffered from health issues. Jennings won by a large majority, 5,211 votes to 3,934. Most of Jennings&#x27;s votes probably came from the eastern portion of the state, where his support was particularly strong, while Posey&#x27;s probably came from the western portion. Jennings moved to the new state capital at Corydon, where he served the duration of his term as governor.

Jennings&#x27;s salary as governor, which was the highest for an elected official in the state, was $1,000. Under the constitution, the governor served a three-year term and was prohibited from serving more than six years in a nine-year period. Jennings&#x27;s agenda called for establishing court proceedings to secure justice, organizing a state-funded educational systems, creating a state banking system, preventing unlawful seizure and enslavement of free blacks, organizing a state library, and planning internal improvements. His efforts had limited success, due, in part, to the state&#x27;s limited financial resources and Jennings&#x27;s limited powers as governor.

Jennings strongly condemned slavery in his inauguration speech and as governor, he refined his stance on the institution. On November 7, 1816, Jennings encouraged the state legislature to enact laws to prevent &quot;unlawful attempts to seize and carry into bondage persons of color legally entitled to their freedom&quot; while preventing &quot;those who rightfully owe service to the citizens of any other State or Territory, from seeking, within the limits of this state, a refuge from the possession of their lawful owners.&quot; In 1817, Jennings acknowledged a moderation of his earlier position regarding fugitive slaves by claiming it was needed to &quot;preserve harmony&quot; among the states. Jennings agreed to allow citizens &quot;the means of reclaiming any slave escaping to this State that may rightfully belong to them ... with as little delay as possible&quot; after citizens of Kentucky had difficulty reclaiming their slaves who had escaped to Indiana.

===Internal improvements===
In 1818, Jennings began promoting a large-scale plan for internal improvements in the state. Most of the projects were directed toward construction of roads, canals, and other projects to enhance the commercial appeal and economic viability of the state. During Jennings&#x27;s second term the state government continued to support public improvements, with new road construction and expanded settlement into central Indiana. After Indianapolis became the site for the state&#x27;s permanent capital in 1821 and new settlers arrived in the area, the Indiana General Assembly appropriated $100,000 (~$ in ) for new road construction and improvements to some of the more important routes, but it was considerably short of the amount needed.

The state experienced budget shortages because of low tax revenues, which forced Jennings to pursue other means of financing the projects. The main sources of funds came from issuing government bonds to the state bank and sales of public lands. The state&#x27;s spending and borrowing led to short-term budget problems, but despite early setbacks (poor access to capital eventually halted improvement programs and caused the Indiana Canal Company to fold because of lack of funds), the infrastructure improvements initiated by Jennings attracted new settlers to the state. By 1810 the Indiana Territory&#x27;s population within the boundaries of the new state was 24, 520. In the decades following his governorship, Indiana&#x27;s population grew from sixty-five thousand in 1816 to 147,178 in 1820 and surpassed one million by 1850.

In his first inaugural speech in August 1816, Jennings called attention to the need for an educational plan. In his 1817 annual message to the state legislature, he encouraged the establishment of a free, state-funded education system, as called for in the state constitution, but few of the state&#x27;s citizens were willing to impose taxes to fund public schools. The state legislature believed priority should be given to creating government infrastructure. Lack of public funds postponed creation of a state library system until Governor James B. Ray&#x27;s administration in 1826.

From the beginning the state&#x27;s banking institutions were closely tied to the state government&#x27;s fiscal affairs, made even more challenging due to the state&#x27;s &quot;extremely limited economic and population base&quot;, the economic depression of the late teens and early twenties, a lack of experience in banking on the part of state politicians and citizens, and other factors. &quot;Indiana banking rested on shaky foundation even in the prosperous years preceding the Panic of 1819.&quot; To remedy the problem, Jennings signed legislation in 1817 to create the First State Bank of Indiana by converting the Bank of Vincennes, established under a territorial charter in 1814, into the new bank&#x27;s main headquarters and established three new branches at Corydon, Brookville, and Vevay. The First State Bank soon became a depository of federal funds and was involved in land speculation. The Farmers and Mechanics Bank of Madison, established in 1814, chose to remain separate from the state bank under a territorial charter that was valid until 1835.

When state expenditures exceeded its revenues, Jennings preferred to secure the state&#x27;s debts with bank loans to cover the shortfall rather than issuing treasury notes. Although taxes were levied and the state borrowed from the First State Bank of Indiana, the state&#x27;s fiscal status remained bleak, worsened by the economic depression of 1819. Around 1820 federal deposits at the First State Bank were suspended and the bank&#x27;s notes were no longer accepted for purchases from federal land offices.

Numerous reports of corruption at the Bank of Vincennes and the collapse of land values, brought on by the panic of 1819, put the bank in further financial distress. By 1821, the bank was insolvent. In June 1822 the Knox County circuit court declared the First State Bank had forfeited its charter. In November 1823 the Indiana Supreme Court upheld the termination of the bank&#x27;s charter and concluded that the First State Bank had &quot;embezzled&quot; $250,000 of federal deposits, issued more paper than it could redeem, had debt exceeding the limited allowed under its charter, established more branches than its capital and specie could support, paid shareholders large dividends, and took steps to dissolve without paying debts owed.

For several years after the First State Bank&#x27;s failure, Indiana citizens depended on the Bank of the United States, with a branch in Louisville, and the Farmers and Mechanics Bank of Madison for financial services. Farmers and Mechanics Banks fared better than the First State Bank of Indiana, but its charter expired on January 1, 1835, and its paper passed at depreciated rates for several years. Jennings was criticized for not monitoring the state&#x27;s banks more carefully and investigating bank officials for potential wrongdoing.

Most of Jennings second term was spent grappling with the state&#x27;s continuing financial difficulties. When tax revenues and land sales remained low, the state&#x27;s revenue was not sufficient to repay the bonds it used to finance internal improvements. The Indiana General Assembly was forced to significantly depreciate the value of its bonds, harming the state&#x27;s credit and making it difficult to secure new loans.

During his tenure as governor, Jennings nominated three candidates to the Indiana Supreme Court: John Johnson, James Scott, and Jesse Lynch Holman. All three were quickly confirmed by the state legislature.

===Treaty of St. Mary&#x27;s===
In late 1818, Jennings was appointed as a federal commissioner, along with Lewis Cass and Benjamin Parke, to negotiate a treaty with the Native Americans (Potawatomi, Wea, Miami, and Delaware), who lived in the northern and central parts of Indiana. The Treaty of St. Mary&#x27;s allowed the State of Indiana to purchase millions of acres of land north of an 1809 treaty line and extending west to the Wabash River and two more parcels of land, which opened most of central Indiana to American settlement. The appointment created a crisis in Jennings&#x27;s political career. Because the state constitution prohibited a person from holding a federal government position while exercising duties as the state&#x27;s governor, Jennings&#x27;s political enemies seized the opportunity to force him from office by arguing that he had vacated the governor&#x27;s office when he accepted the federal appointment.

Lieutenant Governor Christopher Harrison claimed that Jennings had &quot;abandoned&quot; his elected office and took over as the state&#x27;s acting governor in Jennings&#x27;s absence. In the meantime the Indiana House of Representatives launched an investigation. When Jennings learned of the situation, he was &quot;mortified&quot; that his actions were being questioned and burned the documents he received from the federal government that related to his assignment. The legislature called Jennings and Harrison to appear for questioning; however, Jennings declined, stating the assembly did not have the authority to interrogate him, and Harrison refused to appear unless the assembly recognized him as the acting governor. Because neither of the two men would meet with the legislature, the assembly demanded copies of the documents that Jennings received from the federal government to prove he was not acting as its agent. Jennings responded:
If I were in possession of any public documents calculated to advance the public interest, it would give me pleasure to furnish them, and I shall at all times be prepared to afford you any information which the constitution or laws of the State may require. ... If the difficulty, real or supposed, has grown out of the circumstances of my having been connected with the negotiation at St Mary&#x27;s, I feel it my duty to state to the committee that I acted from an entire conviction of its propriety and an anxious desire, on my part, to promote the welfare and accomplish the wishes of the whole people of the State in assisting to add a large and fertile tract of country to that which we already possess.

The legislature summoned everyone in the surrounding area who had any knowledge of the events at Saint Mary&#x27;s, but found that no one was certain of Jennings&#x27;s role in the commission. After a short debate, the House passed a resolution, voting 15 to 13, to recognize Jennings as governor and dropped it proceedings against him. The House votes opposing Jennings came largely from the state&#x27;s western counties. Harrison was outraged by the decision and resigned as lieutenant governor.

In 1820 Harrison ran against Jennings in his reelection bid. Jennings won the election by a large majority, 11,256 votes to Harrison&#x27;s 2,008. Jennings&#x27;s win by a three-to-one margin suggests he remained a popular politician and the state&#x27;s voters were not overly concerned by attacks on the governor&#x27;s character.

===Personal financial problems===

Jennings&#x27;s personal finances suffered from the panic of 1819, while the Indiana governorship continued to increase his financial burden. Jennings was never able to recover from his debts. One historian suggests that Jennings&#x27;s financial situation may arisen from the expenses incurred during his political campaigns, his long-time service in state government, and being too busy to adequately manage his farm. Jennings and his wife frequently entertained visitors, legislators, and other dignitaries at their Corydon home. At a high-profile dinner in 1819, he hosted President James Monroe and General Andrew Jackson at a dinner held in their honor in Jeffersonville, when the two leaders were making a tour of the frontier states. In 1822 Jennings solicited a $1,000 (~$ in ) personal loan from the Harmonists in a letter to his political ally, George Rapp, but his request was denied. Jennings was able to secure personal loans from friends by granting mortgages on his land. Earlier in his career as a land speculator at Vincennes, when land prices decreased significantly, he was forced to sell several tracts of land at a loss.

By the late 1820s, Jennings was critically short of cash. He depended on income from political office to pay his expenses. His farm was not likely to provide sufficient financial support. Because the thirty-eight-year-old Jennings was prohibited by law from running for reelection to a third term as Indiana governor in 1823, he was forced to consider other political options. Jennings decided to return to Congress.

===Return to Congress===

In September 1822, shortly before his second term as governor expired, Jennings became a candidate for Congress after William Hendricks resigned his seat to run for Indiana governor. A special election was held on August 5, 1822, to fill Hendricks&#x27;s vacant seat in Congress. At the same time, the state&#x27;s increased population gave Indiana three congressional seats. A regular congressional election was held on the same day to elect three Indiana congressmen. Jennings and Davis Floyd were the principal candidates in the special election, which Jennings won. In the regular election to fill the seat for Indiana&#x27;s Second Congressional District, Jennings easily won, defeating James Scott by a wide margin. Jennings became a Democratic-Republican to the 17th Congress and Lieutenant Governor Ratliff Boon succeeded him as governor. Hendricks ran unopposed and was subsequently elected as governor to succeed Boon. Jennings won reelection to Congress and represented Indiana&#x27;s Second District until in 1830. He became a Jacksonian Republican in the 18th Congress, but switched his allegiance, becoming an Adams Republican in the 19th and 20th Congresses, and then aligned with the Anti-Jacksonians in the 21st Congress.

Jennings continued to promote internal infrastructure improvements throughout his term in Congress. He introduced legislation to build more forts in the northwest, to grant federal funding for improvement projects in Indiana and Ohio, and led the debate in support of using federal funds to build the nations longest canal, Wabash and Erie Canal, through Indiana. He introduced a legislative amendment that made a provision to locate and survey the National Road to the west, toward the Mississippi River, so the people living in Indiana and Illinois would have some assurance that the road&#x27;s large federal appropriation would benefit them directly. Jennings helped secure appropriation of funds to survey the Wabash River and make it more accessible to year-round steamboat travel.

In his reelection as the Second District congressman, Jennings supported tariff protection and internal improvements and vowed to support the presidential candidate that his constituents preferred if the election went to the House to decide the winner. Jennings won reelection to Congress in a close race, beating Jeremiah Sullivan of Madison. In the presidential election of 1824, American political parties organized around three candidates: Andrew Jackson running against John Quincy Adams and Henry Clay. Jennings favored Adams, and later, Clay; however, when the contested presidential election passed to the House in 1825, Jennings voted with the majority and gave his political support to Jackson, but he was defeated in the House and Adams became president. Indiana voters who supported Jackson hoped for a victory in the next election.

Jennings, seeking to advance his political career, ran for the Senate twice, but was defeated in both attempts. In 1825, he was a senate candidate at a time when the Indiana General Assembly elected the state&#x27;s senators to Congress. On the first ballot Isaac Blackford came in first, the incumbent governor, William Hendricks, came in second, and Jennings was third. On the fourth ballot Hendricks won the senate seat. In his second attempt, Jennings lost to James Noble.

Jennings&#x27;s wife died in 1826 after a protected illness; the couple had no children. Jennings was deeply saddened by her loss and began to drink liquor more heavily. Later that year he married Clarissa Barbee, but his drinking condition only worsened and he was frequently inebriated.

While serving in Congress, Jennings&#x27;s health continued to decline as he struggled with alcohol addiction and suffered from severe rheumatism. In 1827, ceiling plaster from Jennings&#x27;s Washington D.C. boarding room fell on his head, severely injuring him, and ill health limited his ability to visit his constituents, but he continued to remain a popular politician in Indiana. In the congressional election of 1826, Jennings ran unopposed. He won reelection in 1828, soundly defeating his opponent, Indiana&#x27;s lieutenant governor, John H. Thompson. Jennings did not publicly favor a presidential candidate and won the Second District seat with support from voters who favored Jackson and Adams. During Jennings&#x27;s final term in office House journals show that he introduced no legislation, was frequently not present to vote on matters, and only once delivered a speech. Jennings&#x27;s friends, led by Senator John Tipton, took note of his situation and took action to block Jennings&#x27;s reelection bid when his drinking became a political liability. John Carr, anti-Jackson man, opposed Jennings in a six-way race for the congressional seat and won the election. Tipton had arranged for others to enter the race and divide Jennings&#x27;s supporters. Jennings left office on March 3, 1831.

==Later years==
Jennings was twice-elected Grand Master of the Indiana Grand Lodge of Freemasons, serving in 1824 and 1825. He declined reelection in 1825.

===Retirement===
Jennings retired with his wife, Clarissa, to his home in Charlestown. Tipton may have felt it had been mistake to force Jennings out of public service and hoped that work would force him to give up alcohol. In 1831 Tipton secured Jennings an appointment to negotiate a treaty with native tribes in northern Indiana. Jennings attended the negotiations of the Treaty of Tippecanoe, but the delegation failed in their attempt. Afterwards, Jennings returned to his farm, where his health steadily declined. He continued drinking alcohol, spending considerable time at a local tavern, and was frequently discovered sleeping in streets or in roadside ditches. Jenning&#x27;s alcoholism worsened to the point where he was no longer able to tend his farm. Without a steady income, Jennings&#x27;s creditors began moving to seize his estate. In 1832, Tipton acquired the mortgage on Jennings&#x27;s farm and enlisted the help of a local financier, James Lanier, to acquire the debts on Jennings&#x27;s other holdings. Tipton allowed Jennings to remain on his mortgaged farm for the remainder of Jennings&#x27;s life and encouraged Lanier to grant the same permission.

Jennings died of a heart attack, most likely brought on by another bout with jaundice, on July 26, 1834, at his farm near Charlestown. He was fifty years old. Jennings was buried after a brief ceremony in an unmarked grave. His estate lacked the funds to purchase a headstone. Jennings&#x27;s creditors, many of whom were his neighbors, were left unpaid and disgruntled. Following Jennings&#x27;s death, Tipton sold the Jennings farm to Joseph Carr and gave Jennings&#x27;s widow a $100 gift from the proceeds.

==Legacy==
===Memorials===
In the late nineteenth century, several attempts were made to erect a monument honoring Jennings&#x27;s public service. On three separate occasions, in 1861, 1869 and 1889, petitions were brought before the Indiana General Assembly to erect a marker for Jennings&#x27;s grave, but each attempt failed. In 1893 the state legislature finally granted the petition to erect a monument in his honor. Around the same time, after Jennings&#x27;s unmarked gravesite was independently verified by three witnesses to his burial, his body was exhumed and reinterred at a new site at the Charlestown Cemetery.

Jonathan Jennings Elementary School in Charlestown and Jennings County are both named in his honor. Indiana celebrated its Bicentennial in 2016 and as part of the year-long celebration, the Indiana General Assembly passed House Concurrent Resolution 57 on March 2, 2016, naming Interstate 65 through Clark County the Governor Jonathan Jennings Memorial Highway in his memory.

On August 10, 2016, the 23.6 mile stretch of Interstate 65 was dedicated at a ceremony held at Henryville High School in Henryville before the official highway signs were installed.

===Political impact===
Historians have offered varied interpretations of Jennings&#x27;s life and his impact on the development of Indiana. The state&#x27;s early historians, William Wesley Woollen and Jacob Piatt Dunn Jr., wrote of Jennings in an almost mythical manner, focusing on the strong positive leadership he provided Indiana in its formative years. Dunn referred to Jennings as the &quot;young Hercules&quot;, praising his crusade against Harrison and slavery. Woolen&#x27;s assessment was also positive: &quot;Indiana owes him a debt more than she can compute.&quot; During the prohibition era in the early twentieth century, historians Logan Esarey and Arthur Blythe were more critical of Jennings. Esarey, who wrote about Jennings during the height of Prohibition, when attitudes towards alcohol consumption was particularly harsh, was highly critical of Jennings&#x27;s alcoholism and destitution. Blythe described Jennings&#x27;s abilities as &quot;mediocre.&quot; Esarey argued that Jennings &quot;took no decisive stand&quot; on the important issues and dismissed his importance and impact on Indiana, saying the legislature and its leading men set the tone of the era. In 1954, John Barnhart and Donald Carmony described Jennings as a &quot;shrewd politician rather than a statesman&quot;, whose leadership was &quot;not evident&quot; at the 1816 convention. Carmony argued that Jennings&#x27;s &quot;intemperance and poverty, should not obscure his significant contributions as territorial delegate to Congress, president of the Corydon Constitutional Convention, first state governor, and congressman.&quot;

Modern historians, Howard Peckham, Randy Mills, Andrew R. L. Cayton, and Dorothy Riker, argue that Jennings&#x27;s legacy may lie &quot;somewhere between the two extremes&quot; of Dunn&#x27;s and Esarey&#x27;s assessments. Mills agrees with Woollen that Indiana owes Jennings a debt of gratitude. Although Jennings&#x27;s accomplishments were not extensive, he did a &quot;commendable&quot; job for his stewardship of a state in &quot;transition to a more democratic form of government&quot;. Cayton describes Jennings as &quot;ambitious&quot;, &quot;passionate&quot;, &quot;hot-tempered&quot;, and &quot;moody&quot;. He argues that Jennings was a successful campaigner, but an &quot;indifferent&quot; statesman and governor who was &quot;not very good at laying out an agenda and achieving its implementation&quot;.

Jennings believed in popular democracy, opposed slavery, and despised aristocrats, especially William Henry Harrison, for &quot;trampling on the rights of his fellow Americans.&quot; His service as Indiana&#x27;s governor and representative to Congress came at the end of one political era and the beginning of another, when governmental power and authority shifted from the governor and his patronage appointments to the state legislature and elected officials.

<doc id="773166" wikidata="Q2919941" url="?curid=773166" title="Enterprise information integration">
<text>Enterprise information integration (EII) is the ability to support a unified view of data and information for an entire organization. In a data virtualization application of EII, a process of information integration, using data abstraction to provide a unified interface (known as uniform data access) for viewing all the data within an organization, and a single set of structures and naming conventions (known as uniform information representation) to represent this data; the goal of EII is to get a large set of heterogeneous data sources to appear to a user or system as a single, homogeneous data source.

== Overview ==
Data within an enterprise can be stored in heterogeneous formats, including relational databases (which themselves come in a large number of varieties), text files, XML files, spreadsheets and a variety of proprietary storage methods, each with their own indexing and data access methods.

Standardized data access APIs have emerged that offer a specific set of commands to retrieve and modify data from a generic data source. Many applications exist that implement these APIs&#x27; commands across various data sources, most notably relational databases. Such APIs include ODBC, JDBC, XQJ, OLE DB, and more recently ADO.NET.

There are also standard formats for representing data within a file that are very important to information integration. The best-known of these is XML, which has emerged as a standard universal representation format. There are also more specific XML &quot;grammars&quot; defined for specific types of data such as Geography Markup Language for expressing geographical features and Directory Service Markup Language for holding directory-style information. In addition, non-XML standard formats exist such as iCalendar for representing calendar information and vCard for business card information.

Enterprise Information Integration (EII) applies data integration commercially. Despite the theoretical problems described above, the private sector shows more concern with the problems of data integration as a viable product.
EII emphasizes neither on correctness nor tractability, but speed and simplicity.

; Combining disparate data sets : Each data source is disparate and as such is not designed to support EII. Therefore, data virtualization as well as data federation depends upon accidental data commonality to support combining data and information from disparate data sets. Because of this lack of data value commonality across data sources, the return set may be inaccurate, incomplete, and impossible to validate.

: One solution is to recast disparate databases to integrate these databases without the need for ETL. The recast databases support commonality constraints where referential integrity may be enforced between databases. The recast databases provide designed data access paths with data value commonality across databases.
; Simplicity of deployment : Even if recognized as a solution to a problem, EII currently takes time to apply and offers complexities in deployment. Proposed schema-less solutions include &quot;Lean Middleware&quot;.
; Handling higher-order information : Analysts experience difficulty—even with a functioning information integration system—in determining whether the sources in the database will satisfy a given application. Answering these kinds of questions about a set of repositories requires semantic information like metadata and/or ontologies.

== Applications ==
EII products enable loose coupling between -data consuming client applications and services and heterogeneous-data stores. Such client applications and services include Desktop Productivity Tools (spreadsheets, word processors, presentation software, etc.), development environments and frameworks (Java EE, .NET, Mono, SOAP or RESTful Web services, etc.), business intelligence (BI), business activity monitoring (BAM) software, enterprise resource planning (ERP), Customer relationship management (CRM), business process management (BPM and/or BPEL) Software, and web content management (CMS).

<text>Sir Robert Yewdall Jennings (19 October 1913 – 4 August 2004) was Whewell Professor of International Law at Cambridge University from 1955 to 1982 and a Judge of the International Court of Justice (ICJ) from 1982. He served as President of the ICJ between 1991 and 1994 before he resigned from the Court on 10 July 1995.

==Birth and education==
Jennings was born in Yorkshire, England, in the village of Idle where his father worked at a small manufacturing firm and his mother was a mill weaver.

Educated at the local village school in Idle, and later at Belle Vue Grammar School in Bradford, he went on to study history at Downing College, Cambridge. After he gained an upper first class degree, the award of a Squire Law scholarship and some assistance from his local authority provided the financial support that enabled him to proceed to study Law. Again, Jennings excelled, gaining first class honours in both parts of the Cambridge Law Tripos and in the postgraduate LLB degree, and being awarded the Whewell and Cassell scholarships. He later received his LL.B. from the same institution and then won the Joseph Hodges Choate Memorial Fellowship to Harvard University.

==Career==
After Harvard, Jennings worked at an assistant lectureship at the London School of Economics. From 1939 on, he was a Fellow of Jesus College, Cambridge, and was awarded the Hudson Medal of the American Society of International Law. The University of Leicester named a chair after him; Malcolm Shaw held the Chair until 2011. Katja Ziegler is the current Sir Robert Jennings Professor of International Law. In 1955 he succeeded Sir Hersch Lauterpacht as Whewell Professor of International Law, the post which he held until 1982.

He served in the Intelligence Corps during the Second World War.

He was knighted in 1982. He was a president of the Institut de droit international, received honorary doctorates from the universities of Hull, Leicester and the Saarland, as well as Oxford and Cambridge.

He was an editor of the British Yearbook of International Law; co-authored (with Sir Arthur Watts) 9th edition of &quot;Oppenheim&#x27;s International Law&quot;. His other important publications include &quot;The Acquisition of Territory in International Law.&quot;

==Personal life==
He married Christine Bennett (died 2022); they had one son and two daughters. Outside of his legal field, he enjoyed spending time in the Lake District from a small cottage in Eskdale near Scafell Pike, spending time gardening and rebuilding dry-stone walls.

Sir Robert Yewdall Jennings died of natural causes on 4th August 2004 (aged 90) and was buried in Cambridgeshire, England.

<text>William Sherman Jennings (March 24, 1863February 27, 1920) was an American politician who served as the 18th governor of Florida after being a lawyer, county judge, and state representative.

==Early years and education==
He was born near Walnut Hill, Illinois, and attended public schools in Marion County. Jennings graduated from Southern Illinois University in 1883, then studied law at the Union College of Law in Chicago (now named Northwestern University School of Law). He finished his law studies in Chicago under the supervision of his brother, Charles E. Jennings, who was the State Attorney for Marion County.

==Florida==

He came to Florida in 1885 and settled in Brooksville, Florida. In 1887, he was appointed circuit court commissioner, and became county judge of Hernando County, Florida, in 1888.
==State office==
Jennings resigned his office as county judge in 1893 to serve in the Florida House of Representatives, eventually becoming Speaker of the Florida House of Representatives in 1895.
After his term ended, he served as a colonel in the Florida militia, was president of the Brooksville town council and chairman of the Democratic committee.

Jennings campaigned for and was elected governor in 1900, taking the oath of office on January 8, 1901. During his term in office, he introduced the statewide primary election system, replacing the previous method of nominating candidates for political office at a convention. The first statewide primary election was conducted in 1902. It was also Jennings idea to drain and develop the Everglades by cutting the natural rock dams in the rivers of south Florida. His term ended on January 3, 1905.

==Remaining years==
He moved to Jacksonville, then Florida&#x27;s largest city, where he established a successful law practice. He divided his time between a home in Jacksonville and a farm and timber holdings in Clay County near Middleburg.

In 1905, he was appointed by Governor Napoleon B. Broward as general counsel for the Internal Improvement Fund, the state agency responsible for administering public lands. The new governor also favored the development of the Everglades, so in this position, which Jennings held until 1909, he was able to continue leading drainage activities in the Everglades.

==Family==
Jennings met May Mann at her father&#x27;s home near Brooksville, and began a courtship. May&#x27;s father, Austin Mann, had been a Florida Senator and had just won election to the state house of representatives. When the legislative session began in January, 1891, May went to Tallahassee to serve as her father&#x27;s aide, with responsibility for her father&#x27;s appointments, correspondence and hosting social events.
Jennings went to Tallahassee to continue his courtship. He married May Mann on May 12, 1891, and they were escorted down the aisle by the full legislative membership. The newlyweds lived in Brooksville in the William Sherman Jennings House. The couple had one child, a son, Sherman Bryan Jennings.

Politics and the law were prominent in his family. In addition to his brother, who was a lawyer and state attorney, he was a first cousin to William Jennings Bryan, congressman and three-time Democratic presidential nominee.

==Civic activities==
Jennings served as a trustee of Stetson University during the first decade of the twentieth century and was involved in the controversy over whether the Florida Baptist Convention would elect the trustees of the university. At one point, the controversy became so heated that Jennings and Lincoln Hulley, the president of the university, engaged in a fistfight in the lobby of the Leon Hotel in Tallahassee, Florida.

==Death==
Jennings died on February 27, 1920, in St. Augustine, Florida, and was buried in Jacksonville, Florida.

==Legacy and honors==
The World War II Liberty Ship was named in his honor.

<text>Andrew Benjamin Sterling (August 26, 1874 – August 11, 1955) was an American lyricist.

==Biography==
Born in New York City, he began writing songs and vaudevilles after he graduated from high school. An important event was his meeting with the composer Harry Von Tilzer in 1898—the two began a songwriting partnership thereafter, lasting almost 30 years.

Others that Sterling collaborated with include Arthur Lange, Gus Edwards, Bernie Grossman, M. K. Jerome, William Jerome, Frederick Allen Mills, his brother Raymond Sterling, Ray Henderson, Edward Moran and Bartley Costello.

Sterling wrote the songs &quot;Meet Me in St. Louis, Louis&quot; in 1904 and &quot;Wait &#x27;Till the Sun Shines, Nellie&quot; in 1905. He wrote the song &quot;America, Here&#x27;s My Boy&quot; for the Peerless Quartet in 1917 in the aftermath of U.S. entry into World War I in April 1917. He wrote &quot;On the Old Fall River Line&quot; with Von Tilzer and W. Jerome. He worked with Von Tilzer on the classic &quot;Pick Me Up and Lay Me Down in Dear Old Dixieland&quot;. Other songs for which Sterling wrote the lyrics in whole or part include &quot;After the War is Over&quot; (1918) and &quot;When My Baby Smiles at Me&quot; (1920).

Sterling died in Stamford, Connecticut on August 11, 1955.

He was inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame in 1970.

<text>Nicholas (or Nicolas) Jenson (c. 1420–1480) was a French engraver, pioneer, printer and type designer who carried out most of his work in Venice, Italy. Jenson acted as Master of the French Royal Mint at Tours and is credited with being the creator of one of the finest early Roman typefaces. Nicholas Jenson has been something of an iconic figure among students of early printing since the nineteenth century when the artist William Morris praised the beauty and perfection of his roman font. Jenson is an important figure in the early history of printing and a pivotal force in the emergence of Venice as one of the first great centers of the printing press.

==History==
In October 1458, while acting as Master of the French Royal Mint, Jenson was sent to Mainz, by King Charles VII, to study the art of metal movable type. By the time Jenson arrived in Mainz, there were a number of established printers under which he could have been apprenticed. Jenson left Mainz in 1461.

Some hypothesize that Jenson studied under the tutelage of Johann Gutenberg, although there is no verifiable evidence of this.
By this time Gutenberg&#x27;s first press had been seized by Johann Fust, and historians are unsure of his activities during this period.

In 1468 Jenson went to Venice, opening a printing shop in 1470. The printer was prodigious in his publishing, eventually producing around 150 titles.

By the end of his life, Jenson was a wealthy man, producing liturgical, theological and legal texts in a variety of gothic fonts, the roman type left only for the odd commissioned work.

==Printing history==

During the 1470s Nicholas Jenson&#x27;s technical skill and business acumen helped establish Venice as Italy&#x27;s publishing capital and in centuries since he has been celebrated for perfecting roman type, the rebirth of Latin inscription.

In 1477 Jenson was able to run as many as twelve presses at the same time. To lower prices and force out less productive rivals, he cut cursive gothic type, enabling him to print text and gloss on the same page for the first time.

==Jenson&#x27;s printing==


During the time of his arrival in Venice Jenson was quite successful as an artist but was financially successful as well. His early training as a goldsmith allowed him even greater sensitivities to the sculptural nature of type; the letters Jenson employed were often beautiful capitals that could summon the spirit of Rome.

Jenson&#x27;s fame as one of history&#x27;s greatest typeface designers and punch cutters rests on the types first used in his edition of Eusebius&#x27;s &quot;Praeparatio Evangelica&quot;, which presents the full flowering of the roman type design.

Jenson&#x27;s letters are clearly borrowing their shapes from the calligraphic shapes that preceded them, called littera Antica. These were in turn based on Carolingian minuscules, to which serifs, borrowed from the Imperial Roman capitals, were added. It was first in use in his 1470 edition of Eusebius. In 1471, a Greek typeface followed, which was used for quotations, and then in 1473 a Black Letter typeface, which he used in books on medicine and history.

In distinction to his contemporary printers, Jenson was able to expand his financial base. By 1477 he could run as many as twelve presses simultaneously. He was also responsible for launching two book trading companies, first in 1475 and then in 1480, under the name of Johannes de Colonia, Nicolaus Jenson et socii.

Some fonts inspired by Jenson include Golden Type and Cloister Old Style.

==Published works==

;The Manual Of Linotype Typography, Published 1923 by Linotype Company.
;Caesar, Julius. Works, 1471. Printed in Venice by Nicolas Jenson, 1471
:Nicolas Jenson printed one of the earliest and most beautiful editions of Caesar. We note here, especially the remarkable clarity and simplicity of the printer&#x27;s Roman typeface, which drew its inspiration from etchings on Roman monuments. On this opening page, we are also treated to a wonderful illuminated initial and border.
;VK 405, Bible in Latin, Nicolas Jenson, Venice, 1479
:The Bible was written by forty different human authors over a 1500-year period. While the original Autographs were &quot;perfect&quot;, the process of hand-copying resulted in derivations from the original texts. Of the French printers of the era from Nicolas Jenson came nearly a hundred of the finest books produced in the fifteenth century. This is the first Bible to be issued from Jenson’s press, of this Latin Bible, issued in 1479, Pope Sixtus IV conferred upon him the honorary title of Count Palatine.
;Pliny, &quot;Natural History,&quot; 1476. Printed in Venice by Nicolas Jenson. 1,025 copies (1,000 paper, 25 vellum).
:The Pliny the Elder text was printed as a partnership venture between Jenson and the Strozzi family, who backed the venture financially. It is a vernacular text, with translation by Cristoforo Landino. &quot;The Pliny text was printed (in a font closely simulating the modern humanist handwriting in which the manuscript of the work might have been written) with wide margins, without initial capital letters at the beginning of chapters, and with its titles isolated in a sea of blank paper on the frontispiece, crying out for illustration and decoration.&quot;

<text>Niels Kaj Jerne, FRS (23 December 1911 – 7 October 1994) was a Danish immunologist. He shared the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1984 with Georges J. F. Köhler and César Milstein &quot;for theories concerning the specificity in development and control of the immune system and the discovery of the principle for production of monoclonal antibodies&quot;.

Jerne is known for three significant ideas. Firstly, instead of the body producing antibodies in response to an antigen, Jerne postulated that the immune system already has the specific antibodies it needs to fight antigens. Secondly, it was known that the immune system learns to be tolerant to the individual&#x27;s own self. Jerne postulated that this learning takes place in the thymus. Thirdly, it was known that T cells and B cells communicate with each other.

Jerne&#x27;s network theory proposed that the active sites of antibodies are attracted to both specific antigens (idiotypes) and to other antibodies that bind to the same site. The antibodies are in balance, until an antigen disturbs the balance, stimulating an immune reaction.

== Early years and education ==
His ancestors had lived on the small Danish island of Fanø for centuries, but in 1910 his parents moved to London, where Jerne was born in 1911.

During the First World War, his parents moved to the Netherlands and Jerne spent his youth in Rotterdam. After studying physics for two years at the Leiden University, Jerne moved to Copenhagen and changed his studies to the field of medicine. He graduated from the University of Copenhagen with a degree in medicine in 1947. Four years later, he was awarded the doctorate for his thesis, &quot;A Study of Avidity Based on Rabbit Skin Responses to Diphtheria Toxin-Antitoxin Mixtures&quot;.

== Research positions ==
From 1943 to 1956 Jerne was a research worker at the Danish National Serum Institute and during this time he formulated a theory on antibody formation. It is said that Jerne got his revolutionary scientific idea while bicycling across the Langebro bridge in Copenhagen on his way home from work.

The antibody formation theory gave Jerne international recognition and in 1956 Jerne went to work for the World Health Organization in Geneva, where he served as the Head of the Sections of Biological Standards and of Immunology. He held this post for six years until moving to the United States and the University of Pittsburgh in 1962 to work as Professor of Microbiology and Chairman of the Department of Microbiology for four years. Jerne continued to do work for the World Health Organization as a member of the Expert Advisory Panel of Immunology from 1962 and onwards.

In 1966 Jerne moved back to Europe and took up the position of Professor of Experimental Therapy at the Johann Wolfgang Goethe University in Frankfurt. From 1966 to 1969 he was the Director of the Paul-Ehrlich-Institut, also in Frankfurt. In 1969 Jerne again switched jobs, this time to Basel in Switzerland, where he was the Director of the Basel Institute for Immunology until his retirement in 1980. During the 1970s and 1980s, Jerne was a pioneer in the development of immune network theory.

According to Jerne&#x27;s biographer Thomas Söderqvist, Jerne was not a bench scientist, could not pipette accurately, and did not enjoy experimental work. His Nobel Prize was awarded for theories, rather than discoveries. Jerne developed the &quot;natural selection theory of immunology&quot;, proposed by Paul Ehrlich 50 years earlier, although he was missing the clonal selection element proposed by David Talmage and then by Frank Macfarlane Burnet. It was met by skepticism among his colleagues at first, James Watson for example told Jerne bluntly that his theory &quot;stinks&quot;.

== Family life ==
Jerne was married three times. He had two sons, Ivar Jerne (born 1936) and Donald Jerne (born 1941), with Tjek Jerne, a painter. Jerne had a third son, Andreas Wettstein, with Gertrud Wettstein, in 1971.

According to Söderqvist, Tjek, 35, was distraught when she found out that Niels was having an affair with her best friend, Adda Sundsig-Hansen. Tjek had confided in Adda about her own affairs, and Adda had told Neils about them too. Niels demanded a divorce. Tjek begged him to stay. After he refused, she killed herself. Ivar woke up in the morning, smelled gas, and found his mother dead by the oven. Jerne reportedly treated his second wife like a servant and nanny. He was serially unfaithful to his wives.

== Awards and honours ==

<text>Križevci (; ; ; ) is a town in northern Croatia with a total population of 21,122 and with 11,231 in the town itself (2011), It is the oldest town in its county, the Koprivnica-Križevci County.

==History==
The first mention of &quot;Upper Križevac&quot; was in 1193 by Béla III, when it was given the status of a Royal Borough in 1252 by the ban (count) Stephan, and which was confirmed by King Béla IV a year later.
&quot;Lower Križevac&quot; developed somewhat slower than its twin town: it became a free royal city in 1405, thanks to king Sigismund.

Bloody Sabor of Križevci () refers to the assassination of the Croatian ban Stjepan Lacković and his followers at the orders of king Holy Roman Emperor Sigismund, on 27 February 1397.

Križevac is the birthplace of the Catholic priest and martyr Saint Marko of Križevac, who died at the hands of Calvinists in Košice in 1619, and was subsequently canonized because of his martyrdom. His feast day is celebrated on September 7.

After centuries of separation, Empress Maria Theresa of Austria united Lower and Upper Križevac into &quot;Križevci&quot; in 1752 (the word &quot;Križevci&quot; is plural of &quot;Križevac&quot;). The town was attacked during the wars with the Turks, but regained its prominence in 1871 when the newly built railway passed through it connecting Budapest and Rijeka.

In the late 19th century and early 20th century, Križevci was the district capital of the Bjelovar-Križevci County in the Kingdom of Croatia-Slavonia.

These days, while the city has become a hub of entrepreneurship, it still enjoys many of the most valuable and ancient monuments in the county (both in the town itself and the wider region).

Križevci has nine churches (seven Roman Catholic, one Greek Catholic and one Serbian Orthodox), some of them dating back to the Middle Ages. In the oldest Gothic Church of Holy Cross in Križevci, there are important Baroque frescoes and a marble altar dating from the 18th century (by Francesco Robba). Also of artistic and cultural interest is the parish church of St. Anne from the 17th century.

Of particular note is the impressive and culturally significant Greek Catholic Cathedral of the Holy Trinity, the seat of the Eparchy of Križevci since 1789. The cathedral was designed by some of Zagreb&#x27;s finest architects. Its facade was rebuilt by Bartol Felbinger in 1817; while an internal reconstruction was executed in the Gothic revival style by Hermann Bolle in 1892-97. The iconostasis and the frescoes are the work of several important Croatian painters, including Ivan Tišov, Celestin Medović and Bela Čikoš-Sesija.

Križevci Synagogue was built in 1895. It was robbed and gutted by the fascist government in 1941, and turned into a cultural center by the communist government after the end of World War II. It was renovated in 2014 and now mainly serves as a Tourist Information Center. 

The town museum exhibits a rich archeological, ethnographic and cultural-historical collection.

==Geography==
Križevci is a town in the Koprivnica-Križevci County. Because of its close proximity to Zagreb (57 km), Križevci is becoming a &quot;satellite suburb&quot; of the national capital. It enjoys a central position in the region due to its close proximity to all the regional centers: Koprivnica (31 km), Bjelovar (33 km) and Varaždin (48 km). The town&#x27;s importance has always depended on its status as a crossroads. It was known in antiquity and in the Middle Ages because of its location along one of the main caravan routes; in fact, there was a famous &quot;King&#x27;s Coloman Road&quot; that passed through Križevci, connecting Pannonia and Dalmatia. In the more recent times it became a major transport hub: roads connecting Posavina and the region around Kalnik and Podravina were all already built in the 18th century; the railroad between Hungary and Zagreb, that goes through Koprivnica and Križevci (1870.), and to Bjelovar (1894). Today, the town remains an important center connecting Bjelovar and Koprivnica, and other major regional centers. Križevci is 140 m above sea-level, where the southern part of Kalnik begins.

Topographically, it lies on Pleistocene foundations, between swamped alluvial valleys of the brook Vrtlin from the east and the brook Koruska from the west. Relief, geological-petrografical structure, convenient climate and abundance of water, all contribute to the economic and demographic development of the town. The city has been affected by major demographic and economic regional changes, most notably due to increased industrialization and the consequent decline in agricultural production, and rural communities, with the population move to Križevci.

<text>Gerolamo Emiliani, CRS ( also Jerome Aemilian, Hiëronymus Emiliani) (1486 – 8 February 1537) was an Italian humanitarian, founder of the Somaschi Fathers, and is considered a saint by the Catholic Church.

Born in Venice, he spent some time in the military, and later served as a magistrate. Emiliani provided for the sick, the hungry, and orphans; and persuaded others to do likewise. Through his good offices a number of hospitals and orphanages were established in several northern Italian towns. He was canonized in 1767 and is the patron saint of orphans.

==Biography==
Jerome was born in Venice, the son of Angelo Emiliani (popularly called Miani) and Eleonore Mauroceni. His father died when he was a teenager and Jerome ran away at the age of 15 to join the army. In 1508, he participated in the defense of Castelnuovo against the League of Cambray (this was two years before Pope Julius II joined the Venetians). He was appointed governor of a fortress in the mountains of Treviso, and while defending his post he was taken prisoner. Prior, he had not cared about God, but attributed his escape to the intercession of the Mother of God; and he made a pilgrimage to the shrine of Our Lady of Treviso, in fulfillment of a vow, and left his chains as an offering.

He was then appointed podestà (Venetian magistrate) of Castelnuovo di Quero, but after a short time returned to Venice to supervise the education of his nephews. All his spare time was devoted to the study of theology and to works of charity. 
In the year of plague and famine (1528), he seemed to be everywhere and showed his zeal, especially for the orphans, whose number had so greatly increased. Jerome began caring for the sick and feeding the hungry at his own expense. He rented a house for them near the church of St. Rose and, with the assistance of some pious laymen, ministered to their needs. To his charge was also committed the hospital for incurables, founded by Gaetano dei Conti di Thiene. In 1531 he went to Verona and induced the citizens to build a hospital; in Brescia, Bergamo, Milan and other places in northern Italy, he erected orphanages, for boys and for girls. At Bergamo, he also founded a hostel for repentant prostitutes. 
He remained a layman throughout his life. Pope John Paul II described him as &quot;a lay person who inspires lay people.&quot;

==Congregation of Regular Clerics==
Two priests, Alessandro Besuzio and Agostino Bariso, then joined him in his labors of charity, and in 1532 Gerolamo founded a religious society, the Congregation of Regular Clerics. The motherhouse was at Somasca, a secluded northern Italian hamlet in the comune of Vercurago between Milan and Bergamo, after which the members became known as Somaschi. In the rule of this congregation, Gerolamo stated the principal work of the community was the care of orphans, poor and sick, and demanded that dwellings, food and clothing would bear the mark of religious poverty. Devoted to the guardian angels, Emiliani entrusted the congregation to the protection of the Virgin, the Holy Spirit and the Archangel Raphael.

The congregation was approved in 1540 by Pope Paul III with the official name &quot;Clerici Regulares S. Majoli Papiae Congregationis Somaschae&quot;, and spread throughout Italy.

During an epidemic, Jerome was assisting the sick when he contracted the plague. He died in Somasca, 8 February 1537.

==Veneration==
He was beatified by Pope Benedict XIV in 1747, and canonized by Pope Clement XIII on 16 July 1767. The Office and Mass in his honor were approved eight years later. He was thus not included in the 1570 Tridentine calendar. When inserted in the Roman calendar in 1769, he was assigned the date of 20 July. In 1969, Pope Paul VI moved his feast to the day of his death, 8 February.

The St. Gerolamo Emiliani Sanctuary is located in Somasca, Vercurago where a seventeenth century silver shrine contains his remains.

===Patronage===
In 1928, Pope Pius XI named him the patron of orphans and abandoned children.

<text>Gilbert Laird Jessop (19 May 1874 – 11 May 1955) was an English cricket player, often reckoned to have been the fastest run-scorer cricket has ever known. He was Wisden Cricketer of the Year for 1898.

==Career==

Jessop was born in Cheltenham, Gloucestershire. Nicknamed &quot;The Croucher&quot; because of his unusual hunched stance at the crease and though a stocky build at 5&#x27;7&quot; and 11 stone, he remained a fast bowler through his career. He was also a powerful driver, cutter and hooker. The Fifth Test at The Oval in August 1902, known as &quot;Jessop&#x27;s match&quot;, highlighted Jessop&#x27;s ability to play quickly. England had an unlikely one-wicket victory against a quality Australian side who set England 263 to win in the fourth innings. Jessop came to the crease with England at 48 for 5. He scored his first 50 runs in 43 minutes and reached his century in 75 minutes. He was eventually dismissed after 77 minutes for 104, which included 17 fours and an all-run five. Many of the fours had well cleared the boundary, but the laws of cricket in 1902 meant that to obtain six runs the ball had to be hit out of the ground. One of these &quot;fours&quot; was caught on the players&#x27; balcony. A newspaper managed to keep a detailed record of his innings, which shows that Jessop reached his hundred off 76 balls – one of the fastest Test centuries of all time.

A genuine all-rounder, in his early days he was a bowler of considerable pace. He could maintain great stamina; however, he suffered a back strain in his debut Test from being over-bowled which plagued his career. (Frith, 2007) Jessop was also a quick fielder, giving Gloucestershire a reputation for strength in the field. His fielding was a matter of great pride to him. In his early days he fielded at cover-point; later he specialised in the position of extra mid-off.

He first played for Gloucestershire in 1894, and a short innings of 30 against the deadly bowling of Mold and Briggs was seen as indicating a promising player. In 1897 when Jessop did the &quot;double&quot; of 1000 runs and 100 wickets, &quot;Wisden&quot; made him a Cricketer of the Year 1898. Two years later his two innings against Yorkshire at Bradford both featured scores of a century before lunch, 104 in the first innings in forty minutes, and 139 in the second, again reaching his hundred in under an hour.

Jessop went up to Christ&#x27;s College, Cambridge in 1896, intending to study for the priesthood, although this was not to materialise as he left without taking a degree. He played for the Cambridge University side for four seasons, being captain in the last (1899). In the 1897 Varsity match he took six wickets for 65 in the first innings; in 1898 he took six wickets for 126 in the first innings.

After two moderate years – despite a Test debut in 1899 – Jessop in 1900 took over as captain and secretary of Gloucestershire and had his finest year, scoring 2210 runs and taking 104 wickets including a career-best 8 for 29 against Essex. The following year, whilst he lost his pace and his bowling declined to fewer than thirty wickets, his batting improved further, whilst 1902 was highlighted by his Fifth Test efforts at the Oval.

In 1903, Jessop played the highest innings of his career – 286 in 180 minutes against Sussex – and for the rest of the decade, as well as being captain of Gloucestershire, he was their batting mainstay, though after 1901 he could rarely bowl at a quick pace. Despite a major injury in 1909 keeping him off the field for over two months, Jessop continued to be a major force as a batsman until he relinquished the secretaryship of Gloucestershire in 1912. In his last two seasons he was not always available and showed only modest form, and, at the age of 45, did not play again when cricket resumed after World War I.

Among his 53 centuries were five of more than 200:
* 286 out of 335 in 175 minutes for Gloucestershire against Sussex at Brighton, 1903 (he and J. H. Board adding 320 for the sixth wicket);
* 240 out of 337 in 200 minutes for Gloucestershire v. Sussex at Bristol, 1907;
* 234 out of 346 in 155 minutes for Gloucestershire v. Somerset at Bristol, 1905;
* 233 out of 318 in 150 minutes for An England XI v. Yorkshire at Lord&#x27;s, 1901;
* 206 out of 317 in 150 minutes for Gloucestershire v. Nottinghamshire at Trent Bridge, 1904.
When scoring centuries, Jessop batted with a scoring rate of 82.7 runs per hour.

==Tributes==
*Richie Benaud: &quot;Perhaps the best one-day player to have ever lived and never played that form of cricket.&quot;
*Sir Jack Hobbs: &quot;He was undoubtedly the most consistently fast scorer I have seen. He was a big hitter, too, and it was difficult to bowl a ball from which he could not score. He made me glad that I was not a bowler. Gilbert Jessop certainly drew the crowds, too, even more than Bradman, I should say.&quot;

==Football career==
Jessop also played football for Gloucester A.F.C. and Cheltenham Town F.C.

==Death==
Jessop died on 11 May 1955, in Dorchester, Dorset, England, from congestive heart failure, at the age of 80.

<doc id="773215" wikidata="Q2313869" url="?curid=773215" title="Dragon Quest (video game)">
<text>titled Dragon Warrior when initially localized to North America, is a 1986 role-playing video game developed by Chunsoft and published by Enix for the Nintendo Entertainment System. It was originally released in Japan in May 1986 and by Nintendo in North America in August 1989. It is the first game in the &quot;Dragon Quest&quot; video game series. &quot;Dragon Quest&quot; has been ported and remade for several video game platforms, including the MSX, MSX2, PC-9801, Super Famicom, Game Boy Color, mobile phones, and Nintendo Switch as of 2019. The player controls the hero character who is charged with saving the Kingdom of Alefgard and rescuing its princess from the evil Dragonlord. &quot;Dragon Warrior&quot;″s story became the second part in a trilogy, with several spinoff anime and manga series.

&quot;Dragon Quest&quot; was created by Yuji Horii, inspired by previous role-playing games such as &quot;Wizardry&quot;, &quot;Ultima&quot;, and his own 1983 game &quot;The Portopia Serial Murder Case&quot;. Horii wanted to create an introductory RPG for a wide audience. He emphasized storytelling and emotional involvement, and simplified the interface, to translate the mostly Western PC game genre of RPG to the Japanese console market. Manga artist and &quot;Dragon Ball&quot; creator Akira Toriyama produced the artwork and Koichi Sugiyama composed the music. The North American version features numerous changes, including battery-backed RAM save games (rather than using a password save system), larger character sprites, and pseudo-Elizabethan English style dialog.

&quot;Dragon Quest&quot; was commercially successful in Japan, but its later release as &quot;Dragon Warrior&quot; in North America was less favorably received. The original version of the game sold more than copies worldwide, with sold in Japan and 500,000 in the United States. Later, Western critics noted the game&#x27;s shortcomings but acknowledged its importance to the genre. It inspired fan-made ROM hacks with substantial changes. The game&#x27;s synthesized soundtrack has been orchestrated, and its music has been performed at numerous concerts. As a whole, &quot;Dragon Quest&quot; has been credited with establishing the basic template for subsequent Japanese console RPGs.

==Gameplay==
&quot;Dragon Warrior&quot; is a single-player role-playing video game. Years after its release, its gameplay mechanics have been described as simplistic and spartan. The player controls a young hero who sets out to defeat a being known as the Dragonlord. The player starts with a menu to begin a new quest, continue a previous quest, or change the speed in which messages appear on the screen. In the Japanese version, continuing a quest requires a password. In the North American Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) English version, the quest is saved onto the game cartridge&#x27;s battery-backup (called an &quot;Adventure Log&quot; in the &quot;Imperial Scrolls of Honor&quot;), with options to delete or duplicate a saved quest. In a new quest, the player may give the hero any name which the game analyzes to determine the initial ability scores and their statistical growth over the course of the game.&lt;ref name=&quot;Guide 6/105&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

&quot;Dragon Warrior&quot; presents players with a clear objective from the start and uses a series of smaller scenarios to increase the hero&#x27;s strength in order to achieve the objective. The game begins in King Lorik&#x27;s chamber in Tantegel Castle, where the hero receives information about the Dragonlord, whom he must defeat, and the stolen Balls of Light, which he must retrieve. After receiving some items and gold, the hero sets out on his quest. Much of &quot;Dragon Warrior&quot; is spent talking to townspeople and gathering information from them that leads to additional places, events, and secrets. Towns contain shops that sell improved weapons and armor; general stores where the player may buy other goods; inns that allow the hero to recover his health and magic, and shops that offer keys for purchase. The player may sell items at half price to shops that provide weapons, armor, or general goods. The hero&#x27;s status window is shown whenever he stops moving, displaying his current experience level (LV) and the number of hit points (HP), magic points (MP), gold (G), and experience points (E).

To safely progress to the next areas in the game, the player needs to accumulate experience points and gold by defeating enemies outside of towns – in the overworld and in dungeons. Apart from the Dragonlord&#x27;s castle and locked doors, there are no physical restrictions on where players can roam. Instead, monsters increase in difficulty as players venture further from Tantegel castle. As the hero&#x27;s level increases, the player can explore further afield with less risk. Enemies appear in random encounters and the hero fights one opponent at a time. The encounter rate is lowest on fields and increases in forests and hills. Battles are turn-based and fought from a first-person perspective while the hero remains off-screen. In combat, players must defeat the enemy by reducing its HP to zero. During combat, players have four commands: &quot;fight&quot;, &quot;run&quot;, &quot;spell&quot;, and &quot;item&quot;. The &quot;fight&quot; command causes the hero to attack the enemy with a weapon, or with his bare fists if no weapon is available, in an attempt to inflict damage. With the &quot;run&quot; command, the hero attempts to escape from a battle, which is recommended if his HP is low. The &quot;spell&quot; command casts magic that can, for example, heal the hero or damage the enemy. The &quot;item&quot; command uses herbs that replenish the hero&#x27;s HP.

During combat, the hero loses HP when he takes damage, and the display turns red when his HP is low. If his HP falls to zero, he dies and is taken back to King Lorik to be resurrected, and loses half his gold &quot;as punishment&quot;. If the hero succeeds in defeating an enemy, he gains experience points and gold; if he gains enough experience points, his experience level increases, giving him greater strength, agility, speed, and the ability to use magic spells. Every time a spell is used, the hero&#x27;s MP decreases at a different cost per spell. Both HP and MP can be restored by resting at an inn, and a non-player character can replenish the hero&#x27;s MP in Tantegel Castle. As the hero earns more gold, better weapons, armor, and items can be purchased. The player can conservatively manage the limited inventory space. Exploring the dark caves requires a torch or the &quot;RADIANT&quot; spell to display a temporary field of vision. In the English version, the player can return to King Lorik at any time to save the quest.

The control pad moves the hero and the menu cursor. Other buttons confirm and cancel commands. The English version has menu commands to talk to people, check their status, search beneath their feet, use items, take treasure chests, open doors, and use stairs. In some remakes, certain commands are assigned to buttons, navigating stairs is automatic, and the hero&#x27;s speed is higher.

&quot;Dragon Warrior&quot;″s plot is a twist on the classic damsel in distress, in that the player does not even have to meet with or speak with her to complete the game.

===Backstory===
&quot;Dragon Warrior&quot;, its sequel, &quot;Dragon Quest II&quot;, and its prequel, &quot;Dragon Quest III&quot;, make up a trilogy with a shared timeline. The story&#x27;s background begins when the kingdom of Alefgard was shrouded in permanent darkness. The brave warrior Erdrick (&quot;Loto&quot; in the Japanese versions and Game Boy Color remake) defeated an evil creature and restored light to the land. In Erdrick&#x27;s possession was the Ball of Light, which he used to drive away enemies who threatened the kingdom. Erdrick handed the Ball of Light to King Lorik, and Alefgard remained peaceful for a long time. The Ball of Light kept winters short in Alefgard and helped maintain peace and prosperity for the region.

However, there is one man who shunned the Ball of Light&#x27;s radiance and secluded himself in a mountain cave. One day, while exploring the cave&#x27;s extensive network of tunnels, the man encountered a sleeping dragon who awoke upon his entrance. He feared the dragon would incinerate him with its fiery breath, but the dragon instead knelt before him and obeyed his commands. This man, who is later discovered to be a dragon, became known as the Dragonlord. One day, after his soul became corrupted by learning magic, the Dragonlord attacked Tantegel Castle and the nearby town of Breconnary with his fleet of dragons and set the town on fire. Riding a large red dragon, the Dragonlord descended upon Tantegel Castle and stole the Ball of Light. Soon, monsters began to appear throughout the entire land, destroying everything in their paths. Much of the land became poisonous marshes, and at least one destroyed town never recovered and remains in ruins.

The following day, Erdrick arrived at Tantegel Castle to speak with King Lorik and offered his help to defeat the Dragonlord. After searching the land for clues to the Dragonlord&#x27;s location, Erdrick found that the Dragonlord lived on an island that could be accessed only via a magical bridge that only a Rainbow Drop could generate. After venturing to the island, Erdrick disappeared. Many years later, during King Lorik XVI&#x27;s reign, the Dragonlord attacked the kingdom again and captured Princess Gwaelin. Many heroes tried and failed to rescue the princess and recover the Ball of Light from the Dragonlord&#x27;s castle, called Charlock. The prophet Mahetta predicted that &quot;One day, a descendant of the valiant Erdrick shall come forth to defeat the Dragonlord.&quot; However, when the descendant arrives as the game&#x27;s hero, many of the people of Alefgard have forgotten the story of Erdrick, and those few who do remember consider it a myth and do not believe in Mahetta&#x27;s prophecy. King Lorik starts to mourn the decline of his kingdom.

===Main story===
The game begins when the player assumes the role of a stranger who arrives at Tantegel Castle. A castle guard tells him that a dragon has captured the princess and is holding her captive in a distant cave. Determined to rescue the princess and defeat the Dragonlord, he discovers an ancient tablet hidden inside a desert cave; carved on the tablet is a message from Erdrick that outlines what the hero needs to do to follow in Erdrick&#x27;s footsteps and defeat the Dragonlord. The hero eventually rescues Princess Gwaelin, but realizes that in order to restore light to Alefgard, he must defeat the Dragonlord at Charlock Castle. After the hero collects a series of relics, he creates a bridge to reach Charlock and fights his way through the castle before finally confronting the Dragonlord. At this point the hero is given a dialogue choice – to side with the Dragonlord or to challenge him. If players choose the former, the game ends, the hero is put to sleep, and the game freezes; however, in the GBC remake, the hero instead wakes up from a bad dream. If the player chooses to fight, a final battle between the hero and the Dragonlord commences.

Once the hero defeats the Dragonlord he reclaims the Ball of Light, eradicating all monsters in Alefgard, and triumphantly returns to Tantegel Castle where King Lorik offers his kingdom as a reward. The hero turns down the offer and instead wishes to find his own kingdom. Accompanied by Princess Gwaelin, the hero then sets off in search of a new land; this sets the stage for the events in &quot;Dragon Warrior II&quot;, which take place many years later and tells the story of three of the hero&#x27;s descendants.

===Characters===
The two main characters are the hero and the Dragonlord. Major supporting characters are King Lorik (King Lars in the GBC remake); his daughter Princess Gwaelin (Lady Lora), and two sages the hero meets during his journey.

The hero, who comes from a land beyond Alefgard, is a descendant of the legendary Erdrick. When the hero arrives, he does not appear to be a warrior – he arrives without weapons or armor – and is ignorant of the situation. The populace thinks his claim of the ability to defeat the Dragonlord are preposterous; however, King Lorik sees this ability, which give him hope and he aids the hero on his quest.

The Dragonlord is a dragon who rules from Charlock Castle, which is visible from Tantegel Castle, the game&#x27;s starting point. His soul became evil by learning magic. Rumors say that, through a spy network, he knows everything that happens in Alefgard. He seeks &quot;unlimited power and destruction&quot;, which results in a rising tide of evil throughout Alefgard. The Dragonlord wants to enslave the world with his army of monsters that he controls with his will.

==Development==
===Background===
When Eidansha Boshu Service Center was founded in 1975 it published tabloid magazines that advertised real estate. In 1982, after failing to establish a chain of stores, the company&#x27;s founder Yasuhiro Fukushima transformed it into a software company devoted to gaming and created Enix. To find talent for the company, Fukushima held the &quot;Enix Game Hobby Program Contest&quot;. The competition was styled after manga competitions, was advertised in computer and manga magazines, and had a  million prize for the winners. The winners were , Koichi Nakamura, and manga magazine &quot;Shōnen Jump&quot; writer Yuji Horii, who was the top winner. Horii designed a tennis game, &quot;Love Match Tennis&quot;, which became Enix&#x27;s first release. While he did not believe he would win, he was motivated by his editor, who enjoyed the games and published Horii&#x27;s articles on them. Later, when Enix began creating games for the NES, Fukushima held another contest. This time, Nakamura won with his &quot;cartoonish and creative contest entry&quot; &quot;Door Door&quot;, which became Enix&#x27;s first release for the NES.

Horii&#x27;s earliest inspiration for &quot;Dragon Quest&quot; is his own 1983 PC adventure game &quot;The Portopia Serial Murder Case&quot; – a murder mystery adventure game that bears some similarities to games such as &quot;Mystery House&quot; (1980), &quot;Zork&quot; (1980), &quot;King&#x27;s Quest&quot; (1984), and particularly &quot;Déjà Vu&quot; (1985). Horii wanted to advance the game&#x27;s storyline through dialogue. &quot;Portopia&quot; was originally released for Japan&#x27;s NEC PC-6001 and was later ported to the Famicom in 1985. The port is Enix&#x27;s second release for the system and the first game which Horii and Nakamura worked on together. Horii redesigned the interface for the port to accommodate the console&#x27;s limited controls, and added a dungeon-crawling area which the detective explores. While &quot;Portopia&quot; did not directly result in &quot;Dragon Quest&quot;″s creation, it was, according to 1UP.com, &quot;a proving ground&quot; for the RPG. The menu-based command system of &quot;Portopia&quot; would later be used in &quot;Dragon Quest&quot;.

The original idea for what became &quot;Dragon Quest&quot; came during the development of the 1985 Famicom port of &quot;Portopia&quot;. Horii and Nakamura discovered the RPG &quot;Wizardry&quot; at a Macworld Conference &amp; Expo. It had some influence on the Famicom &quot;Portopia&quot;″s dungeon crawl segments, and Horii liked its depth and visuals. He wanted to create a game similar to &quot;Wizardry&quot;, to expose Japan to the mainly Western-dominated RPG genre, and to expand the genre beyond computer enthusiasts. Horii also cited &quot;Ultima&quot; as an inspiration for &quot;Dragon Quest&quot;″s gameplay, specifically the first-person random battles in &quot;Wizardry&quot; and the overhead perspective of &quot;Ultima&quot;. Though the RPG genre was predominantly Western and limited to PCs, Japanese gamers enjoyed home-grown games such as &quot;The Black Onyx&quot; and the &quot;Dragon Slayer&quot; series alongside Western RPG ports. However, while Horii and Nakamura enjoyed the dungeon crawling and statistical nature of &quot;Wizardry&quot;, they realized most people would not. This had not originally been a concern, but the success of &quot;Super Mario Bros.&quot; greatly increased the potential audience of any new Famicom or NES game. To create &quot;Dragon Quest&quot;, the gameplay needed to be simplified. According to Horii: &quot;There was no keyboard, and the system was much simpler, using just a [game] controller. But I still thought that it would be really exciting for the player to play as their alter ego in the game. I personally was playing &quot;Wizardry&quot; and &quot;Ultima&quot; at the time, and I really enjoyed seeing my own self in the game.&quot;

In order to create an RPG that would appeal to a wide audience unfamiliar with the genre, and video games in general, Horii wanted to create a new kind of RPG that did not rely on previous experience with the &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; tabletop RPG, did not require hundreds of hours of rote fighting, and could appeal to any kind of gamer. To accomplish this he needed to simplify the system and have players associate themselves with the hero. Thus as the game progressed, the hero would become stronger, in contrast to action games like &quot;Super Mario Bros.&quot; where Mario does not become continuously more powerful throughout the entire game. He wanted to build on &quot;Portopia&quot; and place a greater emphasis on storytelling and emotional involvement. He developed a coming-of-age tale that audiences could relate to and made use of RPG level-building gameplay as a way to represent this.

===Japanese development===
Yuji Horii and his team at Chunsoft began developing &quot;Dragon Quest&quot; in 1985. He believed that the Famicom was the ideal platform for it, because unlike arcade games, players would not worry about spending money if they got a game over, and they could continue playing from where they left off. Losing a battle results in resurrection at a previous save point rather than the game ending, making the game more accessible. He wanted to include multiple player characters but was forced to use only one due to memory constraints. Horii knew that RPGs had a steeper learning curve than other video games, and to compensate for this he implemented quick level-ups at the start of the game with a clear final goal that is visible from the world map&#x27;s starting point: the Dragonlord&#x27;s castle. He provided a series of smaller scenarios in order to build up the player&#x27;s strength to achieve the final objective. He created an open world which is not blocked physically in any way except by monsters that can easily kill unprepared players; Gamasutra described this as one of the earliest examples of nonlinear gameplay. Horii used bridges to signify changes in difficulty and implemented a level progression with a high starting growth rate that decelerates over time, which contrasts with the random initial stats and constant growth rates of the early editions of &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot;. To appeal to a larger audience, manga artist and creator of &quot;Dragon Ball&quot;, Akira Toriyama, was hired. As with &quot;Dragon Ball&quot;, his artwork features characters &quot;whose strength and cunning transcend generations&quot;, with humorous elements such as a chibi style.

Koichi Sugiyama, the game&#x27;s music composer, solicited Enix via a PC game&#x27;s feedback questionnaire. He was already a well-known composer of television shows and pop songs, and, upon seeing his feedback, Enix producer Yukinobu Chida contacted him to confirm that &quot;he was &quot;the&quot; Sugiyama from television&quot;. Chida asked Sugiyama to compose a score for &quot;Dragon Quest&quot;. The game&#x27;s classical score is Sugiyama&#x27;s second video game composition after &quot;Wingman 2&quot;. He said it took him five minutes to compose the original opening theme, and noted the difficulty in adding a personal touch to the short jingles, but that his past experience with creating music for television commercials helped. According to Sugiyama, a composer has between three and five seconds to catch the audience&#x27;s attention through music. The theme and his other jingles for &quot;Dragon Quest&quot; have remained relatively intact in its sequels.

===1989 North American localization===
Coverage of &quot;Dragon Quest&quot;″s North American localization first appeared in &quot;Nintendo Fun Club News&quot; winter 1988 issue. With this, the game&#x27;s title was changed to &quot;Dragon Warrior&quot; to avoid infringing on the trademark on wargame publisher Simulations Publications&#x27;s pen-and-paper RPG &quot;DragonQuest&quot;. The article sources the game&#x27;s Japanese version for images and names, briefly explaining the backstory and basic gameplay elements, comparing the game to &quot;The Legend of Zelda&quot;. The game was later mentioned in &quot;Nintendo Power&quot; &quot;Pak Watch&quot; preview section in March 1989, mentioning &quot;Dragon Quest III&quot;″s Japanese release in the magazine&#x27;s premiere July 1988 issue. It again mentioned the change of name from &quot;Dragon Quest&quot; to &quot;Dragon Warrior&quot;, its inspiration of two Japanese sequels, and that its release was still distant in time.

==Release==

&quot;Dragon Quest&quot; was released in Japan in 1986 for the Famicom, the MSX, the MSX2, and the PC-9801.

&quot;Dragon Warrior&quot; was released in North America by Nintendo of America under the direction of Satoru Iwata with help from Horii in August 1989 – months before the Japanese release of &quot;Dragon Quest IV&quot;. Because the game was released in North America nearly three years after the original release in Japan, the graphics were improved. Instead of lengthy passwords with kana characters, the North American version has a battery-backed RAM savegame. Akira Toriyama&#x27;s artwork in the instruction booklets was changed to reflect a more traditional tone of popular American based RPGs such as the &quot;Ultima&quot; series. The character sprites were changed to face their direction of travel; in the Japanese versions, the sprites are smaller and face only forward, requiring players to choose a direction for actions from a menu. Spells were given self-explanatory one-word titles instead of the made-up words of the Japanese version. Locations were renamed, and dialogue was rewritten from its whimsical style comparable to &quot;Dragon Ball&quot; to a style inspired by Elizabethan English, with sentences such as &quot;Thy hit points have decreased by 1.&quot; Nintendo also removed salacious humor and religious connotations from the English-language version. For example, in the Japanese version, in the town where the hero first buys keys, a woman offers to sell puff-puffa Japanese onomatopoeia for a girl rubbing her breasts in someone&#x27;s face, or juggling her own breasts. In the North American version, the same woman sells tomatoes. The term has been included in the game&#x27;s sequels as well as in Toriyama&#x27;s &quot;Dragon Ball&quot; series.

Katsuya Terada created some of the artwork for the early &quot;Dragon Warrior&quot; articles in &quot;Nintendo Power&quot;. Neither Terada nor those editing the artwork for the instruction booklet followed Toriyama&#x27;s work; they instead used the settings and character poses to create alternate artwork in an American style. The Japanese hero has a chibi manga style, and the English version&#x27;s appearance is based on &quot;the West&#x27;s template of a medieval hero&quot;.

In June 1989, &quot;Electronic Gaming Monthly&quot;″s &quot;Quartermann&quot; speculated that &quot;Dragon Warrior&quot; would be Nintendo&#x27;s &quot;big release&quot; in North America that Christmas based on the immense popularity of the series in Japan, especially &quot;Dragon Quest III&quot;. &quot;Nintendo Power&quot; provided three feature articles on &quot;Dragon Warrior&quot; for issues between May and October 1989 and the November–December 1989 issue includes a strategy guide. The March–April 1990 issue of &quot;Nintendo Power&quot; has a map of the game world, with a poster of &quot;Super Contra&quot; on the other side, and a &quot;Dragon Warrior&quot; text adventure.

In late 1990, Nintendo reportedly strategized the unloading of unsold game units by sending free copies of &quot;Dragon Warrior&quot; to &quot;Nintendo Power&quot; subscribers, including a 64-page &quot;Explorer&#x27;s Handbook&quot; with a full walkthrough of the game and additional backstory. At the time, the game cost approximately at retail and the magazine&#x27;s subscription fee was only . The giveaway attracted nearly 500,000 new magazine subscribers, and many more renewed subscriptions just to get the game. The series would eventually see greater success in North America more than a decade later.

===Re-releases and remakes===

Enix remade &quot;Dragon Quest&quot; and &quot;Dragon Quest II&quot; for the single-cartridge compilation &quot;Dragon Quest I &amp; II&quot; for the Super Famicom on December 18, 1993. More than 1.2 million copies were sold in Japan. In 1998, Enix released &quot;BS Dragon Quest&quot; for the Super Famicom via the Satellaview peripheral exclusively in Japan. The latter consists of four one-hour scenarios downloaded on a weekly schedule. The player is tasked with leveling the character, collecting medals, and completing scenario-specific conditions with special real-time events.

The compilation was re-released for the GBC, developed by Tose and released by Enix on September 23, 1999, in Japan and September 27, 2000, in North America. It uses an entirely new translation, discards the pseudo-Elizabethan English style and uses names closer to those in the Japanese version. In this remake, &quot;Dragonlord&quot; is changed to &quot;DracoLord&quot;, and &quot;Erdrick&quot; is changed to &quot;Loto&quot;. Several additional features were added such as where the player can quicksave the game anytime outside a battle. Players can store some gold. The menu was streamlined and monsters yield more experience and gold, saving time.

In 2004, &quot;Dragon Quest&quot; and its sequel were remade for mobile phones in Japan. These are graphically based on the Super Famicom remake of &quot;Dragon Quest III&quot; and &quot;Dragon Quest VI&quot;.

On September 15, 2011, the &quot;Dragon Quest 25th Anniversary Collection&quot; compilation for the Wii was released in Japan, containing the Famicom version, Super Famicom version, &quot;Dragon Quest II&quot;, and &quot;Dragon Quest III&quot;. It includes original copies of the games&#x27; strategy guides, original artwork, and development material. In October 2013, Square Enix announced the re-release of &quot;Dragon Quest I–VIII&quot; for Android and iOS. In November 2013, the game was released for iOS and Android in Japan, based on the 2004 mobile remake. The United States and Europe mobile versions were released on September 11, 2014.

In the Nintendo Direct in September 2019, Nintendo confirmed that &quot;Dragon Quest I&quot;, &quot;II&quot; and &quot;III&quot;, would be released on the Nintendo Switch on September 27, 2019.

In the Nintendo Direct in June 2024, a HD-2D remake of &quot;Dragon Quest I&quot; &amp; &quot;II&quot; was announced to be released in 2025 for Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 5, Windows, and Xbox Series X/S.

==Related media==
&quot;Dragon Warrior&quot; has inspired related media in the form of a manga series, which has been adapted to anime, and a symphonic video game soundtrack.

===Anime and manga===
The manga series, , was written by Chiaki Kawamata and Junji Koyanagi, with artwork by Kamui Fujiwara, and was published between 1991 and 1997 by &quot;Monthly Shōnen Gangan&quot;. Enix compiled the series into 21 volumes, which were later released on compact disc in 1994. It was released on December 11, 2009 for the PlayStation Store as part of the initial launch of Sony&#x27;s digital comic distribution. In 1996, an anime movie based on the manga was released on videocassette. Square Enix started publishing a sequel series, , in 2005. wrote the first four volumes, and Takashi Umemura wrote the last five; Yuji Horii supervised the manga, and Kamui Fujiwara contributed the artwork.

&quot;Dragon Quest Saga: Emblem of Roto&quot; takes place between &quot;Dragon Warrior III&quot; and &quot;Dragon Warrior&quot;. After monsters possessed Carmen&#x27;s king for seven years, the kingdom fell to the hordes of evil. The only survivors were Prince Arus and an army General&#x27;s daughter, Lunafrea. Meanwhile, in the Kingdom of Loran, a child is born and is named Jagan in accordance with the demon lord Imagine&#x27;s orders. Arus and Lunafrea set out to defeat the monsters and restore peace to the world. The sequel, &quot;To the Children Who Inherit the Emblem&quot;, takes place five years after the events in &quot;Dragon Quest Saga: Emblem of Roto&quot;. The world is again in chaos and a young boy, , sets out to gather companions to help him save the world from evil.

===Soundtrack===
Koichi Sugiyama composed and directed the music for &quot;Dragon Warrior&quot;. The soundtrack included eight tracks, which &quot;RPGFan&quot; said was &quot;the foundation for Sugiyama&#x27;s career&quot;. The pieces were arranged and incorporated into later &quot;Dragon Warrior&quot; games&#x27; soundtracks. The music has been released in a variety of formats. The first is as a Drama CD, released by Enix on July 19, 1991, which incorporated a narrated story. &quot;Super Famicom Edition Symphonic Suite Dragon Quest I&quot;, published by Sony Records on January 12, 1994, followed; the soundtrack featured orchestral versions of the tracks played by the London Philharmonic Orchestra and the original versions of the tunes. The game&#x27;s classical score was considered revolutionary for console game music. The soundtrack&#x27;s &quot;eight melodies&quot; approach set the template for most RPG soundtracks released since then, hundreds of which have been organized in a similar manner.

The orchestral albums for &quot;Dragon Warrior I&quot; and &quot;II&quot; were combined in &quot;Symphonic Suite Dragon Quest I•II&quot;, released by SME Visual Works on August 23, 2000, King Records reprinted it on October 7, 2009. The orchestral tracks were again released in the &quot;Symphonic Suite Dragon Quest I&quot; album, including orchestral versions of the game&#x27;s sound effects. Numerous live concerts have featured performances of the game&#x27;s music; many performances were later released as albums such as &quot;Dragon Quest in Concert&quot; and &quot;Suite Dragon Quest I•II&quot;.

==Reception==
===NES version===
Initial sales of the game were so low that Enix was going to lose money, but several &quot;Shonen Jump&quot; articles by Horii helped increase its sales substantially. People liked Toriyama&#x27;s artwork and Sugiyama&#x27;s music, which the book &quot;Power-Up: How Japanese Video Games Gave the World an Extra Life&quot; said &quot;was richer and more exciting than any game music had ever sounded&quot;. In Japan, 1.5 million copies of the original version were sold. More than of those copies were sold within the first six months. It was very successful there and launched a popular series with several spin-off series and stand-alone games.

In the first &quot;Famitsu&quot; Best Hit Game Awards (published February 1987, for 1986 releases), &quot;Dragon Quest&quot; won the awards for Game of the Year, Best Scenario/Story, Best Character Design, Best Programmer (for Koichi Nakamura), and Best RPG. The 1989 &quot;All Soft Catalog&quot; issue of &quot;Famicom Tsūshin&quot; (&quot;Famitsu&quot;) includes &quot;Dragon Quest&quot; in its list of the best games of all time, receiving the Best RPG and Best Character Design awards, but losing to &quot;Dragon Quest III&quot; for the overall Grand Prize for best game of all time.

Several years after the Japanese release, the first English version of &quot;Dragon Warrior&quot; was initially seen as a commercial failure, but the &quot;Nintendo Power&quot; subscription giveaway was eventually a success and allowed Enix to bring the next three games to North America. According to Chris Kohler, Nintendo profited immensely from the giveaway because &quot;&quot;Nintendo Power&quot; was essentially a hundred-page monthly ad for Nintendo products&quot;, and it was now in thousands of households. The game sold about 500,000 copies in the United States, making it the third best-selling 1989 game release in North America, below Nintendo&#x27;s &quot;Tetris&quot; and &quot;Super Mario Land&quot;. In total, &quot;Dragon Quest&quot; sold more than 2 million copies worldwide.

In North America, the English version garnered average reviews overall. &quot;Nintendo Power&quot; rated it about three out of five. It debuted at No. 7 on the magazine&#x27;s bimonthly &quot;Top 30&quot; top NES games list in November 1989. It climbed to No. 5 in January 1990 and remained there for 4 months; it then dropped to No. 11 in May, No. 14 in July, and No. 16 in September 1990, then leaving the list. In the &quot;&quot;Nintendo Power&quot; Awards 1989&quot;, the game was nominated for &quot;Best Theme, Fun&quot; and &quot;Best Overall&quot;; but did not win in either category. In response to Japanese youths&#x27; arrests while waiting for &quot;Dragon Quest III&quot;″s release, &quot;Electronic Gaming Monthly&quot;″s Quartermann said that the game was not &quot;that special at all&quot;, compared it to the NES version of &quot;Ultima III: Exodus&quot; and recommended that others play that game instead.

The game&#x27;s release has been regarded as important in the history of the console RPG genre. Kohler noted that Toriyama&#x27;s and Sugiyama&#x27;s contributions to the game &quot;made &quot;Dragon Quest&quot; as visually and aurally exciting as the game play was unique and sophisticated&quot;. GameSpot named it as one of the fifteen most influential video games in history. IGN listed it as the eighth best all-time NES game. In 2005, it listed it as the 92nd-best all-time video game, and in 2007 it listed the game as the 29th best. &quot;Nintendo Power&quot; rated &quot;Dragon Warrior&quot; as the 140th-best game made for the Nintendo System in its Top 200 Games list in 2006. RPGamer&#x27;s Bill Johnson gave it a 4 out of 5 overall score. The NES version received considerable praise for adding extra characters and depth to the story. The removal of the stylized dialogue in the GBC remake has similarly been lamented. AllGame declared that &quot;despite its enormous influence [...] &quot;Dragon Warrior&quot; is a flawed game. It has some decent design ideas, but it&#x27;s just not terribly enjoyable&quot;, noting simplistic graphics, slow pace, and poor sound.

Seemingly primitive by modern standards, &quot;Dragon Warrior&quot; features one-on-one combat, a limited item and equipment array, ten spells, five towns, and five dungeons. While noting its importance to the development of the RPG genre, &quot;Allgame&quot; reviewer Kyle Knight stated that &quot;taken on its own merits, it&#x27;s just not an enjoyable game to play.&quot; &quot;1UP.com&quot; explained that the series was not immensely popular at first in North America because American console gamers were not used to the idea of RPGs, and that it would take a decade for the genre to be &quot;flashy enough to distract from all of those words they made you read&quot;. Chi Kong Lui wrote for &quot;GameCritics&quot; that the game added realism to video games, which allows players to identify with the main character on a much larger scale, saying &quot;If a player perished in &quot;Dragon Warrior&quot;, he or she had to suffer the dire consequences of losing progress and precious gold. That element of death evoked a sense of instinctive fear and tension for survival.&quot; &quot;IGN &quot; writer Mark Nix compared the game&#x27;s seemingly archaic plot to more modern RPGs, saying, &quot;Noble blood means nothing when the society is capitalist, aristocratic, or militaristic. Damsels don&#x27;t need rescuingthey need a battle axe and some magic tutoring in the field.&quot; Reviewing &quot;Dragon Quest VIII: Journey of the Cursed King&quot;, &quot;GameSpy&quot; staff wrote that &quot;Dragon Warrior&quot; is many gamers&#x27; first exposure to the console RPG. Recalling their past, a staff member commented: 

Bill Johnson compared &quot;Dragon Warrior&quot; to modern RPGs and noted the game&#x27;s lack of replay value, which is due to the game&#x27;s requirement of total completion and to its overall difficulty. He noted the game&#x27;s historical importance, saying, &quot;[Playing &quot;Dragon Warrior&quot; is] a tough road to walk, but reaching its end will instill a new appreciation of what today&#x27;s RPGs are all about.&quot; The 2009 book &quot;Vintage Games&quot; contrasted &quot;Dragon Warrior&quot; to the 1986 NES game &quot;The Legend of Zelda&quot;, saying that though both games share common RPG elements, &quot;Zelda&quot; features a fantasy setting and magic but no level or turn-based combat system, and &quot;Dragon Warrior&quot; features both. &quot;Nintendo Power&quot; said the game&#x27;s historical significance is its greatest aspect, and noted that &quot;playing &quot;Dragon Warrior&quot; these days can be a bit of a chore&quot;. &quot;GamePro&quot; wrote that their favorite aspect of the game was the Elizabethan-English dialogue, and that they were disappointed by its removal in the GBC remake.

===Remakes===
The &quot;Dragon Quest I &amp; II&quot; remake for the Super Famicom yielded 1.2 million copies sold in Japan. &quot;Famitsu&quot; gave the Super Famicom compilation remake &quot;Dragon Quest I &amp; II&quot; a rating of 35 out of 40. The Satellaview remake was given a mixed, but overall positive review by Microgroup, saying that the touches such as the real-time event and voicing were appreciated but their implementation was lacking. They praised the medal collection as a nice way to compete with friends. &quot;Dragon Warrior&quot;″s English remake, as part of the dual GBC cartridge &quot;Dragon Warrior I &amp; II&quot;, received better reviews than the original. IGN and &quot;Nintendo Power&quot; gave it an 8 out of 10. IGN&#x27;s Marc Nix noted that while &quot;it&#x27;s one of the only interesting RPGs on the Game Boy Color to actually make American shores&quot;, players will be frustrated; those who played the original will lament the changes, while new players will find the game too linear and simple. GameSpot gave it a 9.6 out of 10, citing the great improvements to sound quality and the appeal of playing both games in succession, and GameRankings reports an 82% overall score. It received both GameSpot&#x27;s and RPGamer&#x27;s awards for Game Boy Color Game of the Year, and was nominated for GameSpot&#x27;s &quot;Role-Playing Game of the Year&quot; prize among console games. Comparing it to its NES counterpart, &quot;RPGamer&quot;″s Derek Cavin awarded it 3 out of 5, saying that the game is above average in all aspects, and particularly praised the visual elements. He criticized its repetitiveness, but said that it is short enough that most players should finish the game before repetition becomes an issue. Combined, both the SNES and GBC remakes had more than 1.94 million copies sold worldwide. With the remakes&#x27; good sales performances, Enix released &quot;Dragon Warrior III&quot; for the GBC in 2001, which was based on a previously unreleased SNES update of &quot;Dragon Quest III&quot;″s English version.

Square Enix Music Online&#x27;s Juan2Darien reviewed the game&#x27;s symphonic scores: &quot;Dragon Quest Suite&quot;; &quot;Dragon Quest I Remix Symphonic Suite (London Philharmonic Orchestra)&quot;; &quot;Dragon Quest I &amp; II Symphonic Suite (London Philharmonic Orchestra Remastered)&quot;; and &quot;Dragon Quest I Symphonic Suite (Tokyo Metropolitan Symphony Orchestra)&quot;. Comparing each of the suites, he gave all ratings ranging 7 through 9 out of 10, and found the Tokyo Strings Ensemble recording superior. He praised efforts by Koichi Sugiyama and the orchestras to compose an above-average piece beyond the flatness of the source material. Gamasutra&#x27;s Kurt Kalata also praised the symphonies&#x27; melody, commenting that &quot;the overworld theme... is pretty simplistic and grating, but actually sounds pretty beautiful when played by a live orchestra&quot;.

==Legacy==

The release of &quot;Dragon Quest&quot; and &quot;Dragon Warrior&quot; prompted a turning point in video game history. The game has been listed as a genre builder for RPGs. Its popularity in Japan is synonymous with RPGs. Though bearing elements of previous RPGs, &quot;Dragon Quest&quot; set a comprehensively new template from gameplay to narrative, as the foundation for nearly every subsequent RPG. According to Shigeru Miyamoto, the success of &quot;Dragon Quest&quot; changed the nature of video game development by making scenario writers far more important.

Many of the development techniques were intended to compensate for Famicom hardware limitations, but contemporary RPG developers continue to use these techniques regardless of technological advances. &quot;Dragon Warrior&quot; introduced the damsel-in-distress storyline that many RPGs follow, and a fresh plot twist to the &quot;saving the princess&quot; formula, where the game&#x27;s true objective is not revealed until the princess is rescued. The game introduced an element of romance, where the player character is given a dialogue choice to respond to the princess&#x27;s question of whether he loves her; romance has since become a commonplace feature in the genre. The game&#x27;s 2D graphic style was used by most RPGs until the advent of 3D graphics, and is still a staple of the genre. &quot;Dragon Warrior&quot;″s top-down perspective has become &quot;a dead giveaway to an RPG&quot;. The game featured elements still found in most RPGs, such as the ability to obtain better equipment, major quests that intertwine with minor subquests, an incremental spell system, use of hit points and experience points, and a medieval theme. Reviewers said that, though &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; has been considered more important due to its popularity and attention in North America, &quot;Dragon Warrior&quot; laid the fundamentals on which &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; was based.

In the &quot;Nintendo Power&quot;″s November 2010 issue, in celebration of the NES&#x27;s 25th anniversary in North America, Horii recalled the making of &quot;Dragon Warrior&quot;. Horii was a fan of basic RPG mechanics, and wanted to simplify the interfaces; he said that many other RPGs&#x27; interfaces at the time &quot;were so complicated that they intimidated new users&quot;. He said that &quot;Dragon Quest&quot;″s simplified gameplay made the game appealing to people and made the franchise successful. He had been told that the Famicom lacks sufficient capacity for RPGs, which further motivated him to make one.

&quot;Dragon Quest&quot; became a national phenomenon in Japan, inspiring spinoff media and figurines. The video game industry has called it Japan&#x27;s national game. Horii, who was linked through his &quot;Shonen Jump&quot; articles, increased in celebrity status, and become a household name in Japan, as well known in Japan as Steven Spielberg is in the US; in contrast Miyamoto, creator of &quot;Super Mario Bros.&quot; and &quot;The Legend of Zelda&quot;, is not nearly as well-known. In a &quot;Famitsu&quot; poll, the Japanese public voted &quot;Dragon Quest&quot; as the seventh favorite game for the NES. Several games such as &quot;Glory of Heracles&quot;, &quot;Legend of the Ghost Lion&quot;, and &quot;Mother&quot; were inspired by the Japanese version&#x27;s success. Shigesato Itoi was a fan of &quot;Dragon Quest&quot;, and Miyamoto was a detractor of the RPG genre, so in developing &quot;Mother&quot;, they subverted the &quot;Dragon Quest&quot; template by changing the setting and themes from the Middle Ages to those of the US. Many NES games including &quot;Dragon Warrior&quot; have had fan-made ROM hacks with a new plot and revised character sprites upon the same gameplay and layout, such as &quot;Super Mario Remix II&quot; from the &quot;Mario&quot; series. &quot;Dragon Quest&quot; became so popular in Japan that, if asked to draw slime, a Japanese person is likely to draw a shape similar to that of the game&#x27;s Slime creature.

Many aspects of pop culture reference &quot;Dragon Warrior&quot;. The video game music band Descendants of Erdrick, based in Austin, Texas, is named after the game&#x27;s main character. On April Fools&#x27; Day 2012, Google added a &quot;Dragon Warrior&quot;-inspired 8-bit option to Google Maps.

In 2016, the spinoff &quot;Dragon Quest Builders&quot; was released as an alternate sequel to the first game. The story is set after the &quot;bad ending&quot; of the first game, where the Hero accepts the Dragonlord&#x27;s offer to join him and rule half of the world.

<text>Philip Caryl Jessup (February 5, 1897 – January 31, 1986) was a 20th-century American diplomat, scholar, and jurist notable for his accomplishments in the field of international law.

== Early life and education ==

Philip Caryl Jessup was born on January 5, 1897, in New York, New York. He was the grandson of Henry Harris Jessup. In 1919, he received his undergraduate A.B. degree from Hamilton College. In 1924, he received a law degree (LLB) from Yale Law School. In 1927, he received a doctorate from Columbia University.

== Career ==

===Academia===

From 1925 to 1961, Jessup held teaching positions at Columbia University. While pursuing his doctorate, and for a good time thereafter (1925–1946), Jessup served as a lecturer and professor in international law at Columbia Law School. From 1942 to 1944, he served as assistant director of the Naval School of Military Government and Administration at Columbia University.In 1946, he was named the Hamilton Fish Professor of International Law and Diplomacy at Columbia Law, a post he held until 1961.

In 1970, he was Sibley lecturer at University of Georgia&#x27;s School of Law in Athens, Georgia. In 1971, he was Barnette Miller Lecturer at Wellesley College.

===Public sector: civil service===

In 1924, Jessup became an assistant solicitor for the United States Department of State. In 1929, he assisted Elihu Root for the Conference of Jurists on the Permanent Court of International Justice in Geneva, Switzerland.

In 1943, Jessup served as assistant secretary-general of the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA) conference through 1944. From 1943 to 1945, he also served as 
chief of the Division of Personnel and Training for Foreign Relief and Rehabilitation Operations at the State Department. In 1944, he also served at the United Nations Monetary and Financial Conference (the &quot;Bretton Woods&quot; conference). In 1945, he was a technical advisor to the American delegation to the San Francisco United Nations charter conference in 1945 (whose Acting Secretary was Alger Hiss). In 1947, he served as U.S. representative to the United Nations Committee on Codification of International Law. From 1948 through 1952, he served in several roles at the United Nations: U.S. representative to the General Assembly (second, third, and fourth special sessions), deputy U.S. representative to the Interim Committee of the General Assembly and Security Council, and deputy chief of the U.S. Mission to the United Nations.

From 1949 to 1953, he also served as &quot;Ambassador-at-large.&quot; As Ambassador, Jessup served on the 1949 U.S. delegation of the Sixth Session of the Paris Council of Foreign Ministers Meeting. Charles W. Yost was his assistant. The two continued to work together in Washington, researching and writing the 1949 Department of State White Paper, officially entitled “United States Relations with China.”

In 1960, Jessup was elected to become a member of the International Court of Justice at the Hague, where from 1961 to 1970 he served as a judge.

===Institute of Pacific Relations===

From 1938 to 1951, Jessup served as chairman of the Pacific Council and member of its parent, Institute of Pacific Relations.

By 1948, he had become a trustee of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, which continued at least through 1956.

From 1967 to 1986, he served as chairman of the Chile-Norway Permanent Commission and as an honorary member of the Governing Council for the International Institute for Unification of Private Law.

From 1970 to 1971, he was a Whitney H. Shepardson senior research fellow in residence at the Council on Foreign Relations.

==Second Red Scare==

Jessup became a primary target of Senator Joseph McCarthy, who charged in the 1950 Tydings Committee hearings that Jessup was a security risk who had &quot;an unusual affinity... for Communist causes.&quot; McCarthy was not allowed by the Tydings Committee to outline his case regarding Jessup, but the committee allowed Jessup to fly in from Pakistan and give his defense. Jessup was subsequently cleared of all charges by the Loyalty Board of the State Department and the Tydings Committee, and McCarthy was rebuked by many fellow senators and other statesmen. However, in two speeches on the floor of the Senate, McCarthy gave his evidence regarding Jessup&#x27;s &quot;unusual affinity for Communist causes:&quot;
* That Jessup had been affiliated with five Communist front groups
* That Jessup had been a leading light in the Institute of Pacific Relations (IPR) at a time that organization was reflecting the Communist Party&#x27;s line
* That he had &quot;pioneered the smear campaign against Nationalist China and Chiang Kai-shek&quot; and propagated the &quot;myth of the &#x27;democratic Chinese Communist&#x27;&quot; through the IPR magazine, &quot;Far Eastern Survey&quot;, over which he had &quot;absolute control&quot;
* That Jessup had associated with known Communists in the IPR
* That the IPR&#x27;s American Council under Jessup&#x27;s guidance had received more than $7,000 of Communist funds from Frederick Vanderbilt Field
* That Jessup had &quot;expressed vigorous opposition&quot; to attempts to investigate Communist penetration of the IPR
* That Jessup had urged that United States atom bomb production be brought to a halt in 1946, and that essential atomic ingredients be &quot;dumped into the ocean&quot;
* That Jessup had appeared as a character witness for Alger Hiss and that after Hiss&#x27;s conviction, Jessup had found &quot;no reason whatever to change his opinion about Hiss&#x27;s veracity, loyalty and integrity&quot;
McCarthy&#x27;s allegations severely damaged Jessup&#x27;s reputation and career.

Nonetheless, US President Harry S. Truman appointed Jessup as United States delegate to the United Nations in 1951. However, when the appointment came before the Senate, it was not approved, largely because of McCarthy&#x27;s influence. Truman circumvented the Senate by assigning Jessup to the United Nations on an &quot;interim appointment.&quot;

Shortly after John F. Kennedy took office as president, the State Department approved the appointment of Jessup as U.S. candidate for the International Court of Justice, a post that did not need Senate confirmation. He served from 1961 to 1970.

Upon returning from the Netherlands, Jessup took up a series of academic positions at the University of Georgia School of Law, Columbia University, and Wellesley College.

==Personal life and legacy==

In 1921, Jessup married Lois Walcott Kellogg. Jessup died on January 31, 1986, in Newtown, Pennsylvania. Jessup is the uncle of television writer Ted Jessup.

=== Honors ===

Jessup was elected to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1932 and the American Philosophical Society in 1939. An international law moot court competition, the Philip C. Jessup International Law Moot Court Competition, is named in Jessup&#x27;s honor. It is held annually in Washington D.C. and is attended by law students from around the world.

Jester was born in 1893 to George Taylor Jester and his wife, Frances P. Gordon, in Corsicana, Texas, the seat of Navarro County in east Texas. He attended local segregated schools. Jester attended the University of Texas at Austin, then also segregated, where he was a member of Kappa Sigma fraternity.

Jester later studied law at Harvard in Cambridge, Massachusetts. His studies were interrupted by the First World War.

After the United States entered World War I, he joined the US Army, eventually achieving the rank of captain, and serving from 1917 to 1918. He commanded Company D of the 357th Infantry, 90th Division from organization to demobilization. His unit saw participation in St. Mihiel Offensive and Meuse-Argonne Offensive.

In 1919, Jester resumed his law studies at the University of Texas, from which he received his Bachelor of Laws a year later.

He married Mabel Buchanan on June 15, 1921.

==Law career==
He returned to Corsicana to practice law. There, he also served as president of the Navarro County Bar Association for many years. Jester also served as director of the state bar association from 1940 to 1941.

From 1929 to 1935, Jester was a member of the University of Texas Board of Regents. From 1933 to 1935, he served as the chairman of that body.

==Political career==
A Democrat, Jester first won statewide elective office in 1942, when elected to the Texas Railroad Commission. He served until January 1947.

He decided to run for governor, winning the Democratic primary in a run-off election in 1946 by defeating Homer Rainey.

As governor, Jester created the Board of Texas State Hospitals and Special Schools, the Texas Youth Development Council, and reformed the state prison system. He also increased funding for state hospitals and orphanages, enacted strong right-to-work laws, and supported an antilynching law.

Jester was easily re-elected to a second term in 1948. He helped implement the most extensive education reforms in the state through the 1949 Gilmer-Aiken Act, the first comprehensive system for Texas school funding.

He is the only Texas governor to have died in office. He died unexpectedly of a heart attack on a train. Jester&#x27;s body was returned to his hometown of Corsicana, where he is interred in Oakwood Cemetery.

==Legacy and honors==

*In the 1950s, the Texas Department of Corrections complex of prisons, the Jester Prison Farm, was named after Jester to honor his efforts at prison reform. 
*In 1964, Jester Park was dedicated by the City of Corsicana in memory of Beauford Jester. The park is home to the Lefty Frizzell Memorial and the Pioneer Village, which recreates the lives of the city&#x27;s pioneers with replicas of historic buildings.
*In 1968, the Jester Center on the University of Texas campus was named after him. This contains Jester Dormitory, formerly the largest college residential facility in the world, housing just under 3,000 students, as well as classroom and faculty space.
*Land formerly owned by Jester in the Hill Country just west of Austin (now incorporated into Austin) was developed as &quot;Jester Estates&quot;, a neighborhood now of about 1,000 homes. The two major streets entering the neighborhood are Beauford Drive and Jester Boulevard. The neighborhood runs along a ridge of the Balcones Plateau, and is surrounded on three sides by protected endangered-species habitat.

<text>John Patrick Marcus Kavanagh (12 July 1879 – 6 July 1964) was a socialist leader in Canada and Australia. 
==Political activist in Canada==
He was a leading member of the Socialist Party of Canada from 1908 to 1921. At the founding meeting of the Worker&#x27;s Party of Canada, which was the public face of the underground Communist Party of Canada, he was elected to the National Executive Committee of the party in February 1922.
==Political activism in Australia==
Kavanagh moved to Australia in 1925, and was a central leader of the Communist Party of Australia until 1930, when the Comintern removed him from the leadership. He was expelled from the party in January 1931, readmitted, and then expelled a second time in 1934 after being accused of Trotskyism. In 1940, Kavanagh joined the &quot;Communist League of Australia&quot; which was the Australian section of the Fourth International.

<text>The French Open, also known as Roland-Garros, is an annual tennis tournament held over two weeks in May and June. Established in 1891 and played since 1928 on outdoor red clay courts at the Stade Roland Garros in Paris, France, the French Open is (since 1925) one of the four Grand Slam tournaments played each year, the other three being the Australian Open, Wimbledon, and the US Open. Organised by the Fédération Française de Tennis (FFT), the French Open is the second of the four Grand Slam tournaments of the year to be played. In 1968, it was the first Grand Slam tournament to open to non-amateur players.

The winner of the men&#x27;s singles event receives the Coupe des Mousquetaires, named after The Four Musketeers of French tennis: Jean Borotra, Jacques Brugnon, Henri Cochet, and René Lacoste. The event was not held from 1915 to 1919 because of the First World War and was held unofficially as the Tournoi de France under German occupation from 1941 to 1944, during the Second World War.

Rafael Nadal has won 14 French Open titles which is a record for any player, male or female, in any major tournament. He also holds the record for the most consecutive wins in the Open Era, with five from 2010 to 2014. Max Decugis won eight French Championships prior to the Open Era. Michael Chang became the youngest player in the Open Era to win the French Open when he took the title in 1989 at . In contrast, Novak Djokovic is the oldest champion of the Open Era, who won the 2023 French Open at 36 years, twenty days. French players have won the most French Open men&#x27;s singles titles, with 38 victories, followed by players from Spain (20) and Australia (11). The current champion is Carlos Alcaraz, who beat Alexander Zverev in the 2024 final.

==History==

The French Open was established in 1891 and was originally known as the French Championships. The tournament was only open to French players or foreign players who were a member of a French club during the first 34 years of its existence. The first winner of the Championship was the British player H. Briggs, a member of Club Stade Français which entitled him to compete. Matches were played as the best-of-three sets format until 1902 or 1903, when best-of-five sets was adopted. French players were dominant in the early stages of the tournament, in particular Max Decugis, who won eight titles before the outbreak of the First World War.
Between 1924 and 1932 the title was won by a member of The Four Musketeers. The championship started to attract the best players after it became an international event in 1925, which was won by René Lacoste. France&#x27;s victory in the 1927 Davis Cup increased interest in the tournament and required a new stadium to be built. Previously the tournament had alternated between Racing Club and Stade Français at La Faisanderie, before the Stade Roland Garros was built in 1928. Henri Cochet won the first tournament at the new venue.

Jack Crawford&#x27;s victory in 1933 was the first time a foreign player had won the tournament since 1891. Following his victory, no French players won the title up until 1940, when the tournament was suspended following the outbreak of the Second World War. Don Budge&#x27;s victory in 1938 was notable, as he won all of the Grand Slam tournaments during the year. Though the event was suspended in 1940, it was held unofficially under the guise of the Tournoi de France. Bernard Destremau won the first two events, while Yvon Petra won three from 1942 to 1945. These results are not recognised by the FFT or other major international organisations and are considered unofficial. Marcel Bernard won the first event after the end of the war in 1946; he was the only Frenchman to win the event before the advent of the Open era in 1968.

No one player dominated the event during this period. Only five players, Frank Parker, Jaroslav Drobný, Tony Trabert, Nicola Pietrangeli and Roy Emerson, won multiple titles. The tournament became an Open in 1968, as professional players were allowed to compete with amateurs, previously only amateurs could compete in the Grand Slam tournaments. The tournament, won by Australian Ken Rosewall, was the first Grand Slam tournament to be played in the Open era.

Swede Björn Borg won the majority of the tournaments in the early years of the Open era. He won consecutive titles in 1974 and 1975, before winning four successive titles from 1978 to 1981. Yannick Noah became the first Frenchman to win the event since 1946, when he won in 1983. Ivan Lendl won his first title in 1984, before losing the following year to Wilander in the final and won two consecutive titles in 1986 and 1987. Michael Chang became the youngest man to win the French Open when he beat Stefan Edberg in 1989.

American Jim Courier won consecutive titles in 1991 and 1992 before Spaniard Sergi Bruguera repeated the feat in 1993 and 1994. Gustavo Kuerten won three titles in 1997, 2000 and 2001. 2005 marked Rafael Nadal&#x27;s first French Open; he won four consecutive titles from 2005 to 2008. Nadal was beaten in the round of 16 of the 2009 tournament by Robin Söderling who lost to Roger Federer in the final. Nadal regained the title in 2010 and defended his crowns in 2011, 2012, 2013, and 2014. In the 2015 event, he was knocked out in the quarter-finals by Novak Djokovic, who eventually lost in the final to Stan Wawrinka. Nadal would again win four straight titles from 2017 to 2020.

<text>The Vilnius letter was a declaration of support for the 2003 invasion of Iraq from the nations of the Vilnius Group. It was published at the height of the Iraq disarmament crisis of early 2003, expressing confidence in the evidence presented by the U.S that Iraq had violated UN resolutions.

== Background ==
*14 January 2003: Jack Straw, the United Kingdom&#x27;s Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs, announces that London would not wait for a UN decision to attack Iraq and would act on its own. Meanwhile, two other countries, Poland and Macedonia, offer to provide troops.
*27 January 2003: Hans Blix presents the UN Security Council with the report that the inspectors had been granted access to every site they needed to inspect, but he says that &quot;It is not enough to open doors.&quot;
*28 January 2003: United States President George W. Bush delivers his State of the Union address to the United States&#x27; Congress, alleging that Saddam Hussein had ties with terrorist organizations, and that Iraq was a serious threat against the security of U.S. citizens as the world&#x27;s most dangerous producer of weapons of mass-destruction.
* the letter of the eight of January 30, 2003, that according to many observers torpedoed the European Union&#x27;s cautious position in the developing crisis, followed Colin Powell&#x27;s assertion in the UN Security Council of Iraq&#x27;s continuing development of illicit weapons.

== Overview ==
The letter of the eight was followed on 6 February by a letter from the &quot;Vilnius Group&quot; comprising Albania, Bulgaria, Croatia, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, North Macedonia, Romania, Slovenia and Slovakia which effectively supported a US military intervention in Iraq. The letter expressed confidence in the evidence presented by Powell and agreed that Iraq had clearly violated UN resolutions. In capitals around the world, the letter could not be interpreted as anything but support of a US military intervention in Iraq.

By expressing support for the 2003 invasion of Iraq — by that point seemingly inevitable — the Vilnius letter was a public rebuke by ten EU candidates of France&#x27;s and Germany&#x27;s vocal opposition to American and British policy. The signatories were later dubbed &quot;New Europe&quot; by the US Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld, and were to receive emotional criticism from the French president Jacques Chirac. Observers noted that the signatories by the letter indicated that they this time prioritized U.S. interests instead of the European Union&#x27;s at a time when it was too late to reverse their admittance into the Union.

According to reports in respected national newspapers, the US envoy Bruce P. Jackson was the architect behind both the letter of the eight and the Vilnius letter. He arranged a meeting in the Lithuanian embassy in Washington, where the foreign ministers of all ten countries participated. The text had been proposed in advance, but according to the press reports it was Jackson who convinced the participants to accept the proposal and to disregard efforts by Bulgaria — then a rotating member of the UN Security Council — to alter the text. Since the early 1990s, Jackson had been an informal advisor to central European governments, advising them on the road to admission into NATO. He allegedly now convinced the foreign ministers of the Vilnius ten, that their support for the US in this international conflict would give them much better chances in the US Congress when it was to vote on accepting those countries into NATO.

== Criticism ==

The letter was met with public consternation in many countries on the European continent — and surprise and criticism from several governments in the European Union. In retrospect, the letter is sometimes pointed at as a significant warning of the crisis and deadlock that came to signify the European Union the following years, with its inability to move forward the issues of defense cooperation, constitution, &quot;transparency&quot; and democratic legitimacy, or integration of the new member countries; and it has been questioned whether the governments in question in fact acted supportive of Anglo-Saxon interests critical or fearful of a strengthened EU, which these governments with their fresh experience of the Soviet Union&#x27;s detrimental dominance on national independence might have been sensitive for. Such criticism may hint at the Vilnius letter as a tool for U.S. policies to divide and rule, citing essays from the think tank PNAC. More diplomatic criticism, partly following the same lines, was made by among others the French government, noting that the signing countries&#x27; admission to the EU was not jeopardized, but US promises — not least in terms of funding of future military improvements — may have been at stake.

For their part the signing central European governments emphasized the Vilnius letter as a commitment to such traditional European and American values as free trade and democracy — and also their participation in the War against terrorism. The letter referred to the &quot;compelling evidence&quot; presented by US Secretary of State Colin Powell to the UN, and added: &quot;Our countries understand the dangers posed by tyranny and the special responsibility of democracies to defend our shared values.&quot; Critics argued that, rather than defending shared values, the signatories were undermining the authority of international law and the United Nations.

Some central European newspapers pointed out the foreign policy problem their governments faced wasn&#x27;t primarily connected with Iraq but instead concerned the clash between the regional powers of the European continent: France and Germany on one side, and the Central Europe, the United States and the United Kingdom, on the other, with Russia as a further complicating factor. Critics argued that by signing the Vilnius letter, they were responsible for aggravating the crisis in the European Union, and putting national security in danger.

Criticism both in EU countries and in the signatory countries also pointed out the return to a client-patron pattern that beside being against the spirit and wellbeing of the EU also was an unexpected and humiliating return to Cold War habits, although with the U.S. instead of the USSR in the role as patron, when WP elites echoed embarrassing propaganda easily revealed as support for Soviet imperialism.

<text>The French Open, known originally as the Internationaux de France, is an annual tennis tournament created in 1891 and played on outdoor red clay courts at the Stade Roland Garros in Paris. The women&#x27;s singles event began in 1897.

==History==
The French Open is played during two weeks in late May and early June, and has been chronologically the second of the four Grand Slam tournaments of the tennis season since 1987. The event was not held from 1915 to 1919 because of World War I, and after a one-year lapse in 1940, was unofficially held from 1941 to 1945 because of World War II. The national body that organizes this event is the French Tennis Federation (FFT).

The Racing Club de France and the Stade Français of Paris alternated hosting the event before the competition was moved in 1928 to the newly built Stade Roland Garros, where it has been played since. The tournament was reserved for members of French tennis clubs until the first edition open to international players took place in 1925. From 1941 to 1944, the tournament took place under Vichy regime, won two times by Alice Weiwers and once by Simone Iribarne Lafargue, and Raymonde Jones Veber. Those editions are not counted by the FFT in the tournament&#x27;s history, and were retroactively named &quot;Tournoi de France&quot;. In 1945, under the Provisional Government of the French Republic, the champion was Lolette Payot. Even if it was organised by the French Lawn Tennis Federation, the 1945 event is also not counted by the FFT in the tournament&#x27;s history.

The women&#x27;s singles rules have undergone several changes since the first edition. The event has always been contested in a knockout format. Records show that matches have always been played as the best-of-three sets format. The lingering death best-of-twelve points tie-break was introduced in 1973 for the first two sets.

The champion receives a miniature replica of the &quot;Coupe Suzanne Lenglen (Suzanne Lenglen Cup)&quot;, named after Suzanne Lenglen. In 2010, the winner received prize money of €1,120,000.

In the French National Championship, which was when the tournament was reserved to members of French tennis clubs and French nationals, Adine Masson (1897–1899, 1902–1903) holds the record for most titles in women&#x27;s singles with five victories. The record for most consecutive titles is four by Jeanne Matthey (1909–1912) and Lenglen (1920–1923), all of whose titles came during the club-members-only era.

In the French International Championships, that came after the tournament opened to international competitors but before the open era, Helen Wills Moody (1928–1930, 1932) holds the record for most titles at four. The record for most consecutive titles during this period is three by Wills Moody (1928–1930) and Hilde Krahwinkel Sperling (1935–1937).

During the French Open, since the inclusion of the professional tennis players, the record for most titles is held by Chris Evert with seven (1974–1975, 1979–1980, 1983, 1985–1986). The record for most consecutive titles during the Open Era is three by Monica Seles (1990–1992) , Justine Henin (2005–2007) and Iga Świątek (2022-2024).

This event has been won without losing a set in the Open Era by Evonne Goolagong in 1971, Billie Jean King in 1972, Evert in 1974, Steffi Graf in 1988, Arantxa Sánchez Vicario in 1994, Henin in 2006 and 2007, and Iga Świątek in 2020.

<text>Rag Doll Kung Fu is a fighting video game developed by Qi Creations for Windows. created predominantly by artist Mark Healey, while working for Lionhead Studios, along with other Lionhead employees, such as David Smith and Alex Evans. &quot;Rag Doll Kung Fu&quot; is available from Valve&#x27;s Steam content delivery platform. It is notable as the first third-party published game to be released on Steam. A remake developed by Tarsier Studios and published by Sony Computer Entertainment, titled &quot;Rag Doll Kung Fu: Fists of Plastic&quot;, was made available for download on the PlayStation Network for the PlayStation 3 on 9 April 2009.

==Gameplay==
The game features string puppets that allow for complete control over their hands, arms, and the like. The game is played with the mouse. An online multiplayer feature has been added to the game as well.

==Development==
The project was announced during an interview with Mark Healey by LHTimes. In the interview, Healey explained that the game was started after he and a few friends made a £50 kung fu film, and Healey felt a game should go along with it. Healey created a site dedicated to &quot;Rag Doll Kung Fu&quot; on the Lionhead Studios server. In late 2005 Healey, David Smith and Alex Evans left Lionhead Studios to form Media Molecule.

&quot;Rag Doll Kung Fu&quot; was nominated in the 2006 Develop awards for &quot;New PC IP&quot; and &quot;Innovation&quot;. It has also been nominated in the GameShadow Innovation in Games Awards 2006

<text>Elizabeth Meeke (13 November 1761 – c. October 1826) was a prolific English author, translator and children&#x27;s writer, and the stepsister of Frances Burney. She wrote about 30 novels, published by the Minerva Press in the late 18th and early 19th centuries.

==Identity==
The novels appeared mainly under the name Mrs. Meeke, sometimes under the pseudonym Gabrielli, and a few anonymously. Their author was once assumed to be Mary Meeke, the wife of a Staffordshire vicar, but &quot;Mrs. Meeke&quot; was conclusively identified as Elizabeth Meeke in an article by Simon Macdonald in 2013. She is thought to have died in about October 1826.

==Fiction==
Meeke&#x27;s debut novel was &quot;Count St Blanchard&quot; in 1795. Others include &quot;The Abbey of Clugny&quot;, &quot;The Mysterious Wife&quot;, &quot;Anecdotes of the Altamont Family&quot; and &quot;Which is the Man?&quot; Her works include several translations from French, such as &quot;Elizabeth, or the Exiles of Siberia&quot;.

The third edition of Chamber&#x27;s &quot;Cyclopaedia of English Literature&quot; in 1903 disparaged her work: 

Current evaluations are not so dismissive. Anthony Mandai describes Meeke as &quot;the most prolific novelist of the age,&quot; and argues for her complicated, yet central, role as a professional author through the watershed decades during which she wrote.

<doc id="773271" wikidata="Q215292" url="?curid=773271" title="AC power plugs and sockets">
<text>AC power plugs and sockets connect devices to mains electricity to supply them with electrical power. A plug is the connector attached to an electrically-operated device, often via a cable. A socket (also known as a receptacle or outlet) is fixed in place, often on the internal walls of buildings, and is connected to an AC electrical circuit. Inserting (&quot;plugging in&quot;) the plug into the socket allows the device to draw power from this circuit.

Plugs and wall-mounted sockets for portable appliances became available in the 1880s, to replace connections to light sockets. A proliferation of types were subsequently developed for both convenience and protection from electrical injury. Electrical plugs and sockets differ from one another in voltage and current rating, shape, size, and connector type. Different standard systems of plugs and sockets are used around the world, and many obsolete socket types are still found in older buildings.

Coordination of technical standards has allowed some types of plug to be used across large regions to facilitate the production and import of electrical appliances and for the convenience of travellers. Some multi-standard sockets allow use of several types of plug. Incompatible sockets and plugs may be used with the help of adaptors, though these may not always provide full safety and performance.

==Overview of connections==

Single-phase sockets have receptacles for two power pins, one to carry the electrical current from the power source to the connected device (called &quot;live&quot;, &quot;line&quot;, or &quot;phrase pin&quot;) and another one to carry it back to the power source (called &quot;neutral pin&quot;). Many sockets have a third receptacle or pin for a safety connection to earth ground. The plug is a &quot;male&quot; connector, usually with protruding pins that match the receptacles (&quot;female&quot; contacts) in a socket. Some plugs also have a female contact, used only for the earth ground connection. Typically no energy is supplied to any exposed pins or terminals on the socket, hence the power pins are always part of the plug rather than the socket. In addition to the recessed contacts of the energised socket, plug and socket systems often have other safety features to reduce the risk of electric shock or damage to appliances.

==History==

When commercial electric power was first introduced in the 1880s, it was used primarily for lighting. Other portable appliances (such as vacuum cleaners, electric fans, smoothing irons, and curling-tong heaters) were connected to light-bulb sockets. As early as 1885 a two-pin plug and wall socket format was available on the British market. By about 1910 the first three-pin earthed (grounded) plugs appeared. Over time other safety improvements were gradually introduced to the market. The earliest national standard for plugs and wall sockets was enacted in 1915 in the UK.

== Safety features ==
===Protection from accidental contact===
Designs of plugs and sockets have gradually developed to reduce the risk of electric shock and fire. Plugs are shaped to prevent bodily contact with live parts. Sockets may be recessed and plugs designed to fit closely within the recess to reduce risk of a user contacting the live pins. Contact pins may be sheathed with insulation over part of their length, so as to reduce exposure of energized metal during insertion or removal of the plug. Sockets may have automatic shutters to stop foreign objects from being inserted into energized contacts. Sockets are often set into a surround which prevents accidental contact with the live wires in the wall behind it. Some also have an integrated cover (e.g. a hinged flap) covering the socket itself when not in use, or a switch to turn off the socket.

===Overcurrent protection===
Some plugs have a built-in fuse which breaks the circuit if too much current is passed.

===Earthing (grounding)===
A third contact for a connection to earth is intended to protect against insulation failure of the connected device. Some early unearthed plug and socket types were revised to include an earthing pin or phased out in favour of earthed types. The plug is often designed so that the earth ground contact connects before the energized circuit contacts. The assigned IEC appliance class is governed by the requirement for earthing or equivalent protection. Class I equipment requires an earth contact in the plug and socket, while Class II equipment is unearthed and protects the user with double insulation.

=== Polarisation===
Where a &quot;neutral&quot; conductor exists in supply wiring, polarisation of the plug can improve safety by preserving the distinction in the equipment. For example, appliances may ensure that switches interrupt the line side of the circuit, or can connect the shell of a screw-base lampholder to neutral to reduce electric shock hazard. In some designs, polarised plugs cannot be mated with non-polarised sockets. In most NEMA 1 plugs, for example, the neutral blade is slightly wider than the hot blade, so it can only be inserted one way. Wiring systems where both circuit conductors have a significant potential with respect to earth do not benefit from polarised plugs.

===Voltage rating of plugs and power cords===

Plugs and power cords have a rated voltage and current assigned to them by the manufacturer. Using a plug or power cord that is inappropriate for the load may be a safety hazard. For example, high-current equipment can cause a fire when plugged into an extension cord with a current rating lower than necessary. Sometimes the cords used to plug in dual voltage 120 V / 240 V equipment are rated only for 125 V, so care must be taken by travellers to use only cords with an appropriate voltage rating.

==Extension==

Various methods can be used to increase the number or reach of sockets.

===Extension cords===
Extension cords (extension leads) are used for temporary connections when a socket is not within convenient reach of an appliance&#x27;s power lead. This may be in the form of a single socket on a flexible cable or a power strip with multiple sockets. A power strip may also have switches, surge voltage protection, or overcurrent protection.

===Multisocket adaptors===

Multisocket adaptors (or &quot;splitters&quot;) allow the connection of two or more plugs to a single socket. They are manufactured in various configurations, depending on the country and the region in which they are used, with various ratings. This allows connecting more than one electrical consumer item to one single socket and is mainly used for low power devices (TV sets, table lamps, computers, etc.).

They are usually rated for 6 A, 10 A, or 16 A at 250 V or for 15 A or less at 125 V. This is the general rating of the adaptor, and indicates the maximum total load in amperes, regardless of the number of sockets used (for example, if a 16 A 250 V adaptor has four sockets, it would be fine to plug four different devices into it that each consume 2 A as this represents a total load of only 8 A, whereas if only two devices were plugged into it that each consumed 10 A, the combined 20 A load would overload the circuit).

In some countries such adaptors are banned and are not available in shops, as they may lead to fires due to overloading them or can cause excessive mechanical stress to wall-mounted sockets. Adaptors can be made with ceramic, Bakelite, or other plastic bodies.

==Cross-compatibility==
===Hybrid and universal sockets===

&quot;Hybrid&quot;, &quot;multi-standard&quot;, or &quot;universal&quot; sockets are intended to accommodate plugs of two or more types. In some jurisdictions, they violate safety standards for sockets. Safety advocates, the United States Army, and a manufacturer of sockets point out a number of safety issues with universal socket and adaptors, including voltage mismatch, exposure of live pins, lack of proper earth ground connection, or lack of protection from overload or short circuit. Universal sockets may not meet technical standards for durability, plug retention force, temperature rise of components, or other performance requirements, as they are outside the scope of national and international technical standards.

A technical standard may include compatibility of a socket with more than one form of plug. The Thai dual socket is specified in figure 4 of TIS 166-2549 and is designed to accept Thai plugs, and also Type A, B, and C plugs. Chinese dual sockets have both an unearthed socket complying with figure 5 of GB 1002-2008 (both flat pin and 4.8 mm round pin), and an earthed socket complying with figure 4 of GB 1002-2008. Both Thai and Chinese dual sockets also accept plugs normally fitted to 120 V appliances (e.g. 120 V rated NEMA 1-15 ungrounded plugs). This can cause an electrical incompatibility, since both countries supply residential power at 220 V. Such Chinese dual sockets and all Thai sockets also accept French and Schuko plugs (Types E and F), but unsafely: no earth contact is established and live pins may be exposed when a plug is partially inserted.

===Swappable cables and plugs===

Commonly, manufacturers provide an IEC 60320 inlet on an appliance, with a detachable power cord (mains flex lead) and appropriate plug in order to avoid manufacturing whole appliances, with the only difference being the type of plug. Alternatively, the plug itself can often be swappable using standard or proprietary connectors.

===Travel adaptors===
Adaptors between standards are not included in most standards, and as a result they have no formal quality criteria defined. Physical compatibility does not ensure that the appliance and socket match in frequency or voltage. Adaptors allow travellers to connect devices to foreign sockets, but do not change voltage or frequency. A voltage converter is required for electrical compatibility in places with a different voltage than the device is designed for. Mismatch in frequency between supply and appliances may still cause problems even at the correct voltage. Some appliances have a switch for the selection of voltage.

==Standard types in present use==
The plugs and sockets used in a given area are regulated by local governments.

The International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) maintains a guide with letter designations for generally compatible types of plugs, which expands on earlier guides published by the United States Department of Commerce. This is a &quot;de facto&quot; naming standard and guide to travellers. Some letter types correspond to several current ratings or different technical standards, so the letter does not uniquely identify a plug and socket within the type family, nor guarantee compatibility. Physical compatibility of the plug and socket does not ensure correct voltage, frequency, or current capacity. Not all plug and socket families have letters in the IEC guide, but those that have are noted in this article, as are some additional letters commonly used by retail vendors.

In Europe, CENELEC publishes a list of approved plug and socket technical standards used in the member countries.

===Argentina IRAM 2073 and 2071 (Type I)===


The plug and socket system used in Class 1 applications in Argentina is defined by IRAM standards. These two standards are; IRAM 2073 &quot;Two pole plugs with earthing contact for domestic and similar purposes, rated 10 A and 20 A, 250 V AC&quot; and IRAM 2071 &quot;Two pole socket – outlets with earthing contact for 10 A and 20 A, 250 V AC., for fixed installations.&quot; The plug and socket system is similar in appearance to the Australian and Chinese plugs. It has an earthing pin and two flat current-carrying pins forming an inverted V-shape (120°). The flat pins for the 10 A version measure and for the 20 A version, and are set at 30° to the vertical at a nominal pitch of . The pin length is the same as in the Chinese version. The earthing pin length is for the 10 A version and for the 20 A version. On the plugs, the pole length is for the 10 A version and for the 20 A version.

The most important difference from the Australian plug is that the Argentine plug is wired with the live and neutral contacts reversed.

In Brazil, similar plugs and sockets are still commonly used in old installations for high-power appliances like air conditioners, dishwashers, and household ovens. Although being often called &quot;Argentine plug,&quot; it is actually based on the American NEMA 10-20 standard, and is incompatible with Argentine IRAM plugs. Since Brazil adopted the NBR 14136 standard which includes a 20 A version, the original motivation to use the NEMA 10-20 plug has ceased to exist.

=== Australian/New Zealand standard AS/NZS 3112 (Type I), used in Australasia ===


This Australian/New Zealand standard is used in Australia, New Zealand, Fiji, Tonga, Solomon Islands, and Papua New Guinea. It defines a plug with an earthing pin, and two flat current-carrying pins which form an inverted V-shape. The flat pins measure and are set at 30° to the vertical at a nominal pitch of . Australian and New Zealand wall sockets (locally often referred to as &quot;power points&quot;) almost always have switches on them for extra safety, as in the UK. An unearthed version of this plug with two angled power pins but no earthing pin is used with double-insulated appliances, but the sockets always include an earth contact.

There are several AS/NZS 3112 plug variants, including ones with larger or differently shaped pins used for devices drawing 15, 20, 25 and 32 A. These sockets accept plugs of equal or lower current rating, but not higher. For example, a 10 A plug will fit all sockets but a 20 A plug will fit only 20, 25 and 32 A sockets. In New Zealand, PDL 940 &quot;tap-on&quot; or &quot;piggy-back&quot; plugs are available which allow a second 10 A plug to be fitted to the rear of the plug. In Australia these piggy-back plugs are now available only on pre-made extension leads.

Australia&#x27;s standard plug/socket system was originally codified as standard C112 (floated provisionally in 1937, and adopted as a formal standard in 1938), which was based on a design patented by Harvey Hubbell and was superseded by AS 3112 in 1990. The requirement for insulated pins was introduced in the 2004 revision. The current version is &quot;AS/NZS 3112:2011, Approval and test specification – Plugs and socket-outlets&quot;.

===British and compatible standards===
====BS 546 and related types (Type D and M)====

BS 546, &quot;Two-pole and earthing-pin plugs, socket-outlets and socket-outlet adaptors for AC (50-60 Hz) circuits up to 250 V&quot; describes four sizes of plug rated at 2 A, 5 A (Type D), 15 A (Type M) and 30 A. The plugs have three round pins arranged in a triangle, with the larger top pin being the earthing pin. The plugs are polarised and unfused. Plugs are non-interchangeable between current ratings. Introduced in 1934, the BS 546 type has mostly been displaced in the UK by the BS 1363 standard. According to the IEC, some 40 countries use Type D and 15 countries use Type M. Some, such as India and South Africa, use standards based on BS 546.

==== BS 1363 (Type G) ====

BS 1363 &quot;13 A plugs, socket-outlets, adaptors and connection units&quot; is the main plug and socket type used in the United Kingdom. According to the IEC it is also used in over 50 countries worldwide. Some of these countries have national standards based on BS 1363, including: Bahrain, Hong Kong, Ireland, Cyprus, Malaysia, Malta, Saudi Arabia, Singapore, Sri Lanka, and UAE.

This plug has three rectangular pins forming an isosceles triangle. The BS 1363 plug has a fuse rated to protect its flexible cord from overload and consequent fire risk. Modern appliances may only be sold with a fuse of the appropriate size pre-installed.

====BS 4573 (UK shaver)====

The United Kingdom, Ireland, and Malta use the BS 4573 two-pin plug and socket for electric shavers and toothbrushes. The plug has insulated sleeves on the pins. Although similar to the Europlug Type C, the diameter and spacing of the pins are slightly different and hence it will not fit into a Schuko socket. There are, however, two-pin sockets and adaptors which will accept both BS 4573 and Europlugs.

===CEE 7 standard===

The International Commission on the Rules for the Approval of Electrical Equipment (IECEE) was a standards body which published &quot;Specification for plugs and socket-outlets for domestic and similar purposes&quot; as CEE Publication 7 in 1951. It was last updated by Modification 4 in March 1983. CEE 7 consists of general specifications and standard sheets for specific connectors.

Standard plugs and sockets based on two round pins with centres spaced at 19 mm are in use in Europe, most of which are listed in IEC/TR 60083 &quot;Plugs and socket-outlets for domestic and similar general use standardized in member countries of IEC.&quot; EU countries each have their own regulations and national standards; for example, some require child-resistant shutters, while others do not. CE marking is neither applicable nor permitted on plugs and sockets.

====CEE 7/1 unearthed socket and CEE 7/2 unearthed plug====
CEE 7/1 unearthed sockets accept CEE 7/2 round plugs with pins. Because they have no earth connections they have been or are being phased out in most countries. Some countries still permit their use in dry areas, while others allow their sale for replacements only. Older sockets are so shallow that it is possible to accidentally touch the live pins of a plug. CEE 7/1 sockets also accept CEE 7/4, CEE 7/6 and CEE 7/7 plugs without providing an earth connection. The earthed CEE 7/3 and CEE 7/5 sockets do not allow insertion of CEE 7/2 unearthed round plugs.
====CEE 7/3 socket and CEE 7/4 plug (German &quot;Schuko&quot;; Type F)====


The CEE 7/3 socket and CEE 7/4 plug are commonly called &quot;Schuko&quot;, an abbreviation for &quot;Schutzkontakt&quot;, &quot;Protective contact&quot; to earth (&quot;Schuko&quot; itself is a registered trademark of a German association established to own the term). The socket has a circular recess with two round holes and two earthing clips that engage before live pin contact is made. The pins are . The Schuko system is unpolarised, allowing live and neutral to be reversed. The socket accepts Europlugs and CEE 7/17 plugs and also includes CEE 7/7. It is rated at 16 A. The current German standards are DIN 49441 and DIN 49440. The standard is used in Germany and several other European countries and on other continents. Some countries require child-proof socket shutters; the DIN 49440 standard does not have this requirement.

The plug is used in most or many countries of Europe, Asia, and Africa, as well as in the countries of South Korea, Peru, Chile and Uruguay. The few European countries not using it at all are Belgium, Czech Republic, Cyprus, Ireland, Liechtenstein, Switzerland, and the UK, or not using it predominantly are Denmark, Faroe Island, France, Italy, Monaco, San Marino, Slovakia.

====CEE 7/5 socket and CEE 7/6 plug (French; Type E)====


French standard NF C 61-314 defines the CEE 7/5 socket and CEE 7/6 plug, (and also includes CEE 7/7, 7/16 and 7/17 plugs). The socket has a circular recess with two round holes. The round earth pin projecting from the socket connects before the energized contacts touch. The earth pin is centred between the apertures, offset by . The plug has two round pins measuring , spaced apart and with an aperture for the socket&#x27;s projecting earth pin. This standard is also used in Belgium, Poland, the Czech Republic, Slovakia and some other countries.

Although the plug is polarised, CEE 7 does not define the placement of the live and neutral, and different countries have conflicting standards for that. For example, the French standard NF C 15-100 requires live to be on the right side, while Czech standard ČSN 33 2180 requires live to be on the left side of a socket. Thus, a French plug when plugged into a Czech socket (or a Czech plug when plugged into a French socket) will always have its polarity reversed, with no way for the user to remedy this situation apart from rewiring the plug. One approach for resolving this situation is taken in Poland, where CEE 7/5 sockets are typically installed in pairs, the upper (upside-down) one having the &quot;French&quot; polarity and the lower one having the &quot;Czech&quot; polarity, so that the user can choose what to plug where.

CEE 7/4 (Schuko) plugs are not compatible with the CEE 7/5 socket because of the round earthing pin permanently mounted in the socket; CEE 7/6 plugs are not compatible with Schuko sockets due to the presence of indentations on the side of the recess, as well as the earth clips. CEE 7/7 plugs have been designed to solve this incompatibility by being able to fit in either type of socket.

Sales and installations of 7/5 sockets are legally permitted in Denmark since 2008, but the sockets are hard to find in physical stores, and installation is exceedingly rarely performed.

==== CEE 7/7 plug (compatible with E and F) ====
The CEE 7/7 plug fits in either French or Schuko sockets. It is rated at 16A and looks similar to CEE 7/4 plugs, but with earth contacts to fit both CEE 7/5 sockets and CEE 7/3 ones. It is polarised when used with a French-style CEE 7/5 socket, but can be inserted in two ways into a CEE 7/3 socket. However, with the French socket it is not specified whether the live connection is on the left or right, as this can vary between countries.

Earthed appliances are typically sold fitted with non-rewireable CEE 7/7 plugs attached, though rewireable versions are also available. This plug can be inserted into a Danish Type K socket, but the earth contact will not connect.

==== CEE 7/16 plugs ====
The CEE 7/16 unearthed plug is used for unearthed appliances. It has two round 4 by 19 mm (0.157 by 0.748 in) pins, rated at 2.5 A. There are two variants.

=====CEE 7/16 Alternative I=====
Alternative I is a round plug with cutouts to make it compatible with CEE 7/3 and CEE 7/5 sockets. (The similar-appearing CEE 7/17 has larger pins and a higher current rating.) This alternative is seldom used.

=====CEE 7/16 Alternative II &quot;Europlug&quot; (Type C)=====

Alternative II, popularly known as the Europlug, is a flat 2.5 A-rated plug defined by Cenelec standard EN 50075 and national equivalents. The Europlug is not rewirable and must be supplied with a flexible cord. It can be inserted in either direction, so line and neutral are connected arbitrarily. To improve contact with socket parts the Europlug has slightly flexible pins which converge toward their free ends.

There is no socket defined to accept only the Europlug. Instead, the Europlug fits a range of sockets in common use in Europe. These sockets include CEE 7/1, CEE 7/3 (German/&quot;Schuko&quot;) and CEE 7/5 (French). Most Israeli, Swiss, Danish and Italian sockets were designed to accept pins of various diameters, mainly 4.8 mm, but also 4.0 mm and 4.5 mm, and are usually fed by final circuits with either 10 A or 16 A overcurrent protection devices.

Although the standard does not permit extension cables and does not define any socket-outlets, unauthorized extension cables and sockets are manufactured.

UK shaver sockets are designed to accept BS 4573 shaver plugs while also accepting Europlugs. In this configuration, the connection supply is only rated at 200 mA. It is not permissible within the UK for the shaver socket to be fitted and used for a higher rated current draw than the 200 mA maximum.

The Europlug is also used in parts of the Middle East, Africa, South America, and Asia.

====CEE 7/17 unearthed plug====
This is a round plug compatible with CEE 7/1, CEE 7/3, and CEE 7/5 sockets. It has two round pins measuring . The pins are not sheathed, in contrast to e.g. CEE 7/16 Europlugs. It may be rated at either 10 A or 16 A. A typical use is for appliances that exceed the 2.5 A rating of CEE 7/16 Europlugs. It may be used for unearthed Class II appliances (and in South Korea for all domestic non-earthed appliances). It is also defined as the Class II plug in Italian standard CEI 23-50.

It is sometimes called a contour plug, because its collar contour follows that of the socket&#x27;s recess. The collar prevents accidental contact with the non sheathed pins when inserting or removing the plug in a recessed socket.

It can be inserted into Israeli SI 32 outlets with some difficulty, as well as Danish (type K) ones. The Soviet GOST 7396 standard includes both the CEE 7/17 and the CEE 7/16 variant II plug.

===China GB 2099.1-2008 and GB 1002-2008 (Type A &amp; I)===
The standard for Mainland Chinese plugs and sockets (excluding Hong Kong and Macau) is set out in GB 2099.1-2008 and GB 1002-2008. As part of China&#x27;s commitment for entry into the WTO, the new CPCS (Compulsory Product Certification System) has been introduced, and compliant Chinese plugs have been awarded the CCC Mark by this system. The plug is three wire, earthed, rated at 10 A, 250 V and used for Class 1 applications; a slightly larger 16 A version also exists. The nominal pin dimensions of the 10 A version are: 1.5 mm thick by 6.4 mm wide, the line &amp; neutral are 18 mm long, and the earth is 21 mm long. It is similar to the Australian plug. Many 3 pin sockets in China include a physical lockout preventing access to the active and neutral terminals unless an earth pin (which is slightly longer than the other 2 pins) is entered first. China also uses American/Japanese NEMA 1-15 sockets and plugs for Class-II appliances (however, polarized plugs with one prong wider than the other are not accepted); a common socket type that also accepts Europlug (type C) is also defined in GB 1002. The voltage at a Chinese socket of any type is 220 V.

Type I plugs and sockets from different countries have different pin lengths. This means that the uninsulated pins of a Chinese plug may become live while there is still a large enough gap between the faces of the plug and socket to allow a finger to touch the pin.


===Danish plug (Type K)===

This Danish standard plug is described in the Danish Plug Equipment Section 107-2-D1 Standard sheet (SRAF1962/DB 16/87 DN10A-R). Like in most European plugs, the power pins of Danish plugs are long and spaced apart, with a diameter of . The earthing pin is part of the plug (in contrast to French and Schuko plugs); it is D-shaped, long, and offset from the power pins by . It is thick with a diameter of . Sockets and plugs are rated for 16A. The Danish standard provides for sockets to have child-resistant shutters.

Europlugs (CEE 7/16) can be safely used with Danish sockets. Physically the sockets also accept earthed CEE 7/4 (Schuko), CEE 7/6 (French), and CEE 7/7 (Schuko-French hybrid) plugs, but no earth connection will be established.
Traditionally all Danish sockets were equipped with a switch to prevent touching live pins when connecting/disconnecting the plug. Today, sockets without switch are allowed, but they must be recessed to prevent touching the live pins. Since the early 1990s earthed sockets have been required in all new electric installations in Denmark. Older sockets need not be earthed, but all sockets, including old installations, must be protected by earth-fault interrupters (HFI or HPFI in Danish) by 1 July 2008.
Since 1 July 2008, French-style CEE 7/5 sockets may also be installed in Denmark. Since 15 November 2011, CEE 7/3 (Schuko) sockets may be installed as well, but Type K remains by far the most common socket in Danish homes as of January 2024. French and Schuko sockets were allowed because little electrical equipment sold to private users is equipped with a Danish plug. In Europe, devices are usually sold with the Europlug CEE 7/16 and hybrid plug CEE 7/7, as these fit in most countries. However, in Denmark this often leads to the situation that the protective earth is not connected. Newssites and industry magazines have warned that, due to the lack of grounding, plugging a hybrid (or French or Schuko) plug directly into a Type K socket can give noticeable electric shocks to the point of pain, be dangerous to the point of hospitalising, or even be life-threatening.

A variation (standard DK 2-5a) of the Danish plug is for use only on surge protected computer sockets. It fits into the corresponding computer socket and the normal socket, but normal plugs deliberately do not fit into the special computer socket. The plug is often used in companies, but rarely in private homes. There is a another variation for hospital equipment with a rectangular left pin, which is used for life support equipment.


=== IEC 60906-1 (Type N) ===


In 1986, the International Electrotechnical Commission published IEC 60906-1, a specification for a plug and socket that look similar, but are not identical, to the Swiss plug and socket. This standard was intended to one day become common for all of Europe and other regions with 230 V mains, but the effort to adopt it as a European Union standard was put on hold in the mid-1990s.

The plug and socket are rated 16 A 250 V AC and are intended for use only on systems having nominal voltages between 200 V and 250 V AC The plug pins are 4.5 mm in diameter, line and neutral are on centres 19 mm apart. The earth pin is offset by 3.0 mm. The line pin is on the right when looking at a socket with the earth pin offset up. Shutters over the line and neutral pins are mandatory.

The only country to have officially adopted the standard is South Africa as SANS 164-2.

Brazil developed a plug resembling IEC 60906-1 as the national standard under specification NBR 14136. The NBR 14136 standard has two versions, neither of which has pin dimensions or ratings complying with IEC 60906-1. Use at 127 V is permitted by NBR 14136, which is against the intention of IEC 60906-1.

==== South African standard SANS 164-2 ====
South Africa adopted IEC 60906-1 as its national standard, SANS 164-2, in 1992. The standard specifies both a 2-pin unearthed and 3-pin earthed plug system, equivalent to IEC Type N. SANS 164-2 was designated the &quot;preferred standard&quot; in 2013, and South Africa is in the process of transitioning to it as the dominant system, expected to be completed by 2025 to 2035.

The SANS 164-2 system is compatible with the SANS 164-5 Europlug, commonly used in the country. This transition aims to improve electrical safety and standardization, aligning South Africa with international plug and socket systems.

==== Brazilian standard NBR 14136 ====

Brazil, which had been using mostly Europlugs as well as NEMA 1-15 and NEMA 5-15 plugs, adopted a (non-compliant) variant of IEC 60906-1 as the national standard in 1998 under specification NBR 14136 (revised in 2002). These are used for both 220-volt and 127-volt regions of the country, despite the IEC 60906-2 recommendation that NEMA 5-15 be used for 120 V connections. There are two types of sockets and plugs in NBR 14136: one for 10 A, with a 4.0 mm pin diameter, and another for 20 A, with a 4.8 mm pin diameter. This differs from IEC 60906-1 which specifies a pin diameter of 4.5 mm and a rating of 16 A. NBR 14136 does not require shutters on the apertures, a further aspect of non-compliance with IEC 60906-1. NBR 14136 was not enforced in that country until 2007, when its adoption was made optional for manufacturers. It became compulsory on 1 January 2010.

Few private houses in Brazil have an earthed supply, so even if a three-pin socket is present it is not safe to assume that all three terminals are actually connected. Most large domestic appliances were sold with the option to fit a flying earth tail to be locally earthed, but many consumers were unsure how to use this and so did not connect it. The new standard has an earth pin, which in theory eliminates the need for the flying earth tail.

Due to their smaller pin diameter, Brazilian plugs rated for 10A also fit into Brazilian sockets rated for 20A and South African sockets rated for 16A. South African plugs (rated for 16A) also fit into Brazilian 20A sockets, but not into 10A sockets.

===Israel SI32 (Type H)===
The plug defined in SI 32 (IS16A-R) is used only in Israel, including the Gaza Strip and the West Bank. There are two versions: an older one with flat pins, and a newer one with round pins.

The pre-1989 system has three flat pins in a Y-shape, with line and neutral apart. The plug is rated at 16 A. In 1989 the standard was revised, with three round pins in the same locations designed to allow the socket to accept both older and newer Israeli plugs, and also non-grounded Europlugs (often used in Israel for equipment which does not need to be grounded and does not use more current than the Europlug is rated for). Pre-1989 sockets which accept only old-style plugs have become very rare in Israel.

Sockets have a defined polarity; looking at the front, neutral is to the left, ground at the bottom, and line to the right.

===Italy (Type L)===

Italian plugs and sockets are defined by the standard CEI 23-50 which superseded CEI 23-16. This includes models rated at 10 A and 16 A that differ in contact diameter and spacing (see below for details). Both are symmetrical, allowing the line and neutral contacts to be inserted in either direction. This plug is also commonly used in Chile and Uruguay.
# 10 A plugs and socket: Pins which are 4 mm in diameter, the centres spaced 19 mm apart. The 10 A three-pin earthed rear entry plug is designated CEI 23-50 S 11 (there are also two side-entry versions, SPA 11 and SPB 11). The 10 A two-pin unearthed plug is designated CEI 23-50 S 10. The 10 A three-pin earthed socket is designated CEI 23-50 P 11, and the 10 A two-pin unearthed socket is designated CEI 23-50 P 10. Both 10 A sockets also accept CEE 7/16 (Europlugs).
# 16 A plug and socket: Pins which are 5 mm in diameter, the centres spaced 26 mm apart. The 16 A three-pin earthed rear entry plug is designated CEI 23-50 S 17 (there are also two side-entry versions, SPA 17 and SPB 17). The 16 A two-pin unearthed plug is designated CEI 23-50 S 16. The 16 A three-pin earthed socket is designated CEI 23-50 P 17, there is not a 16 A two-pin unearthed socket. The 16 A socket used to be referred to as &quot;per la forza motrice&quot; (for electromotive force, see above) or sometimes (inappropriately) &quot;industriale&quot; (industrial) or even &quot;calore&quot; (heat).

The two standards were initially adopted because up to the second half of the 20th century in many regions of Italy electricity was supplied by means of two separate consumer connections – one for powering illumination and one for other purposes – and these generally operated at different voltages, typically 127 V (a single phase from 220 V three-phase) and 220 V (a single phase from three-phase 380 V or two-phase from 220 V three-phase). The electricity on the two supplies was separately metered, was sold at different tariffs, was taxed differently and was supplied through separate and different sockets. Even though the two electric lines (and respective tariffs) were gradually unified beginning in the 1960s (the official, but purely theoretical, date was the summer of 1974) many houses had dual wiring and two electricity meters for years thereafter; in some zones of Lazio the 127 V network was provided for lighting until 1999. The two gauges for plugs and sockets thus became a de facto standard which is now formalized under CEI 23-50. Some older installations have sockets that are limited to either the 10 A or the 16 A style plug, requiring the use of an adaptor if the other gauge needs to be connected. Numerous cross adaptors were used.

Almost every appliance sold in Italy nowadays is equipped with CEE 7/7 (German/French), CEE 7/16 or CEE 7/17 plugs, but the standard Italian sockets will not accept the first and the third ones since the pins of the CEE 7/7 and CEE 7/17 plugs are thicker (4.8 mm) than the Italian ones (4 mm); besides the pins are not sheathed and forcing them into a linear Italian socket may lead to electric shock. Adaptors are standardized in Italy under CEI 23-57 which can be used to connect CEE 7/7 and CEE 7/17 and plugs to linear CEI 23-50 sockets.

Europlugs are also in common use in Italy; they are standardized under CEI 23-34 S 1 for use with the 10 A socket and can be found fitted to Class II appliances with low current requirement (less than 2.5 A).

The current Italian standards provide for sockets to have child-resistant shutters (&quot;Sicury&quot; patent).

====Italian multiple standard sockets====

In modern installations in Italy (and in other countries where Type L plugs are used) it is usual to find sockets that can accept more than one standard.

The simplest type, designated CEI 23-50 P 17/11, has a central round hole flanked by two figure-8 shaped holes, allowing the insertion of CEI 23-50 S 10 (Italian 10 A plug unearthed), CEI 23-50 S 11 (Italian 10 A plug earthed), CEI 23-50 S 16 (Italian 16 A plug unearthed), CEI 23-50 S 17 (Italian 16 A plug earthed) and CEE 7/16 (Europlug). The advantage of this socket style is its small, compact face; its drawback is that it accepts neither CEE 7/7 nor CEE 7/17, very commonly found in new appliances sold in Italy. Vimar brand claims to have patented this socket first in 1975 with their &quot;Bpresa&quot; model; however soon other brands started selling similar products, mostly naming them with the generic term &quot;presa bipasso&quot; (twin-gauge socket) that is now of common use.

A second, quite common type is called CEI 23-50 P 30 and looks like a Schuko socket, but adds a central earthing hole (optional according to CEI 23-50, but virtually always present). This design can accept CEE 7/4 (German), CEE 7/7 (German/French), CEE 7/16, CEE 7/17 (&quot;Konturenstecker&quot;, German/French unearthed), CEI 23-50 S 10 and CEI 23-50 S 11 plugs. Its drawback is that it is twice as large as a normal Italian socket, it does not accept 16 A Italian plugs and the price is higher; for those reasons Schuko sockets have been rarely installed in Italy until recent times.

Other types may push compatibility even further. The CEI 23-50 P 40 socket, which is quickly becoming the standard in Italy along with CEI 23-50 P 17/11, accepts CEE 7/4, CEE 7/7, CEE 7/16, CEE 7/17, CEI 23-50 S 10, CEI 23-50 S 11, CEI 23-50 S 16 and CEI 23-50 S 17 plugs; its drawback is that it does not accept SPA 11, SPB 11, SPA 17 and SPB 17 side-entry plugs; however almost no appliance is sold with these types, which are mainly used to replace existing plugs. The Vimar-brand &quot;universale&quot; (all purpose) socket accepts CEE 7/4, CEE 7/7, CEE 7/16, CEE 7/17, CEI 23-50 S 10, CEI 23-50 S 11, CEI 23-50 S 16, CEI 23-50 S 17 and also NEMA 1-15 (US/Japan) plugs (older versions also had extra holes to accept UK shaver plugs).

=== North America, Central America and IEC 60906-2 ===

Most of North America and Central America, and some of South America, use connectors standardized by the National Electrical Manufacturers Association (NEMA). The devices are named using the format NEMA n-mmX, where &quot;n&quot; is an identifier for the configuration of pins and blades, &quot;mm&quot; is the maximum current rating, and &quot;X&quot; is either P for plug or R for receptacle. For example, NEMA 5-15R is a configuration type 5 receptacle supporting 15 A. Corresponding &quot;P&quot; and &quot;R&quot; versions are designed to be mated. Within the series, the arrangement and size of pins will differ, to prevent accidental mating of devices with a higher current draw than the receptacle can support.

==== NEMA 1-15 ungrounded (Type A) ====
NEMA-1 plugs have two parallel blades and are rated 15 A at 125 volts. They provide no ground connection but will fit into a grounding NEMA 5-15 receptacle. Early versions were not polarised, but most plugs are polarised today via a wider neutral blade. (Unpolarised AC adaptors are a common exception.)

Harvey Hubbell patented a parallel blade plug in 1913, where the blades were equal width (). In 1916 Hubbell received a patent for a polarised version where one blade was both longer and wider than the other (), in the polarised version of NEMA 1-15, introduced in the 1950s, both blades are the same length, only the width varies.

Ungrounded NEMA-1 outlets are not permitted in new construction in the United States and Canada, but can still be found in older buildings.

==== NEMA 5-15 grounded (Type B) ====

The NEMA 5-15 plug has two flat parallel blades like NEMA 1-15, and a ground (earth) pin. It is rated 15 A at 125 volts. The ground pin is longer than the line and neutral blades, such that an inserted plug connects to ground before power. The ground hole is officially D-shaped, although some round holes exist and many plugs have round ground pins. Both current-carrying blades on grounding plugs may be narrow, since the ground pin enforces polarity, but outlets have a wider opening for the neutral blade to prevent ungrounded polarized plugs from being put in backwards. This socket is recommended in IEC standard 60906-2 for 120-volt 60 Hz installations.

The National Electrical Contractors Association&#x27;s National Electrical Installation Standards (NECA 130-2010) recommends that sockets be mounted &quot;with the ground hole up&quot;, such that an object falling on a partially inserted connector contacts the ground pin first. However, the inverted orientation (with ground pin downwards) is more commonly used. The ground-down orientation has been called the &quot;sad socket&quot;, &quot;dismayed face&quot;, or &quot;shocked face&quot; by some.

Tamper-resistant sockets may be required in new residential construction, with shutters on the power blade sockets to prevent contact by objects inserted into the socket.

In stage lighting, this connector is sometimes known as &quot;PBG&quot; for &quot;Parallel Blade with Ground&quot;, &quot;Edison&quot; or &quot;Hubbell&quot;, the name of a common manufacturer.

==== NEMA 5-20 ====
The NEMA 5-20 AP variant has blades perpendicular to each other. The receptacle has a T-slot for the neutral blade which accepts either 15 A parallel-blade plugs or 20 A plugs.

==== NEMA 14-50 ====

NEMA 14-50 devices are frequently found in RV parks, since they are used for &quot;shore power&quot; connections of larger recreational vehicles. Also, it was formerly common to connect mobile homes to utility power via a 14-50 device. Newer applications include Tesla&#x27;s Mobile Connector for vehicle charging, which formally recommended the installation of a 14-50 receptacle for home use.

====Other NEMA types====
240V 20-, 30- and 50-amp rated sockets are often used for high-current appliances such as air conditioners, clothes dryers and electric stoves, respectively.

====JIS C 8303, Class II unearthed====


The Japanese Class II plug and socket appear physically identical to NEMA 1-15 and also carries 15 A. The relevant Japanese Industrial Standard, JIS C 8303, imposes stricter dimensional requirements for the plug housing, different marking requirements, and mandatory testing and type approval.

Older Japanese sockets and multi-plug adaptors are unpolarised—the slots in the sockets are the same size—and will accept only unpolarised plugs. Japanese plugs generally fit into most North American sockets without modification, but polarised North American plugs may require adaptors or replacement non-polarised plugs to connect to older Japanese sockets. In Japan the voltage is 100 V, and the frequency is either 50 Hz (Eastern Japan: Tokyo, Yokohama, Tohoku, Kawasaki, Sapporo, Sendai and Hokkaido) or 60 Hz (Western Japan: Osaka, Kyoto, Nagoya, Shikoku, Kyushu and Hiroshima) depending on whether the customer is located on the Osaka or Tokyo grid. Therefore, some North American devices which can be physically plugged into Japanese sockets may not function properly.

==== JIS C 8303, Class I earthed ====
Japan also uses a grounded plug similar to the North American NEMA 5-15. However, it is less common than its NEMA 1-15 equivalent. Since 2005, new Japanese homes are required to have class I grounded sockets for connecting domestic appliances. This rule does not apply for sockets not intended to be used for domestic appliances, but it is strongly advised to have class I sockets throughout the home.

=== Soviet standard GOST 7396 C 1 unearthed ===

This Soviet plug, still sometimes used in the region, has pin dimensions and spacing equal to the Europlug, but lacks the insulation sleeves. Unlike the Europlug, it is rated 6 A. It has a round body like the European CEE 7/2 or flat body with a round base like CEE 7/17. The round base has no notches. The pins are parallel and do not converge. The body is made of fire-resistant thermoset plastic. The corresponding 6 A socket accepts the Europlug, but not others as the 4.5 mm holes are too small to accept the 4.8 mm pins of CEE 7/4, CEE 7/6 or CEE 7/7 plugs.

There were also moulded rubber plugs available for devices up to 16 A similar to CEE 7/17, but with a round base without any notches. They could be altered to fit a CEE 7/5 or CEE 7/3 socket by cutting notches with a sharp knife.

===Swiss SN 441011 (Type J)===


The Swiss standard, also used in Liechtenstein and Rwanda (and in other countries alongside other standards) is &quot;SN 441011&quot; (until 2019 &quot;SN SEV 1011) Plugs and socket-outlets for household and similar purposes&quot;. The standard defines a hierarchical system of plugs and sockets with two, three and five pins, and 10 A or 16 A ratings. Sockets will accept plugs with the same or fewer pins and the same or lower ratings.
The standard also includes three-phase devices rated at 250 V (phase-to-neutral) / 440 V (phase-to-phase). It does not require the use of child protective shutters. The standard was first described in 1959.

====10 A plugs and sockets (Type J)====
SEV 1011 defines a &quot;Type 1x&quot; series of 10 A plugs and sockets. The type 11 plug is unearthed, with two 4 mm diameter round pins spaced 19 mm apart. The type 12 plug adds a central 4 mm diameter round earth pin, offset by 5 mm. The type 12 socket has no recess, while the type 13 socket is recessed. Both sockets will accept type 11 and type 12 plugs, and also the 2.5 A Europlug. Earlier type 11 &amp; 12 plugs had line and neutral pins without sleeved pins, which present a shock hazard when partially inserted into non-recessed sockets. The IEC type J designation refers to SEV 1011&#x27;s type 12 plugs and type 13 sockets.

Unique to Switzerland is a three-phase power socket compatible with single-phase plugs: The type 15 plug has three round pins, of the same dimensions as type 12, plus two smaller flat rectangular pins for two additional power phases. The type 15 socket is recessed, and has five openings (three round and two flat rectangular). It will accept plugs of types 11, 12, 15 and the Europlug.

====16 A plugs and sockets====
SEV 1011 also defines a &quot;Type 2x&quot; series of 16 A plugs and sockets. These are the same as their 10 A &quot;Type 1x&quot; counterparts, but replace the round pins with 4 mm × 5 mm rectangular pins. The sockets will accept &quot;Type 1x&quot; plugs. The unearthed type 21 plug has two rectangular pins, with centres 19 mm apart. The type 23 plug adds a central rectangular earth pin, offset by 5 mm. The recessed type 23 socket will accept plugs of types 11, 12, 21, 23 and the Europlug.

Again, the three-phase power socket is compatible with single-phase plugs, either of 10 A or 16 A ratings: The type 25 plug has three rectangular pins of the same dimensions as type 23, plus two rectangular pins of the same dimensions as type 15. The corresponding type 25 socket is recessed and will accept plugs of types 11, 12, 15, 21, 23, 25 and the Europlug.

====Regulation of adaptors and extensions====
A 2012 appendix to SEV 1011:2009, &quot;SN SEV 1011:2009/A1:2012 Plugs and socket-outlets for household and similar purposes – A1: Multiway and intermediate adaptors, cord sets, cord extension sets, travel adaptors and fixed adaptors&quot; defines the requirements applicable to multiway and intermediate adaptors, cord sets, cord extension sets, and travel and fixed adaptors, it covers the electrical safety and user requirements, including the prohibition of stacking (the connection of one adaptor to another). Non-conforming products must be withdrawn from the Swiss market before the end of 2018.

===Thai plug TIS 166-2549 (Type O)===
Thai Industrial Standard (TIS) 166-2547 and its subsequent update TIS 166-2549 replaced prior standards which were based on NEMA 1-15 and 5-15, as Thailand uses 220 V electricity. The plug has two round power pins 4.8 mm in diameter and 19 mm in length, insulated for 10 mm and spaced 19 mm apart, with an earthing pin of the same diameter and 21.4 mm in length, located 11.89 mm from the line connecting the two power pins. The earth pin spacing corresponds to that of NEMA 5 and provides compatibility with prior hybrid three-pin sockets, which accept NEMA 1-15, NEMA 5-15, and Europlugs, all of which have been variably used in Thailand.

The standard also defines an ungrounded plug with a smaller form factor that is very similar to the Europlug (but a bit higher); its power pins are identical to the grounded variant and both are rated for up to 16 A (while the Europlug is only rated for 2.5 A). The generally used hybrid socket is also defined in TIS 166-2547, in addition to a plain three-round-pin socket, with plans to eventually replace the former and phase out support for NEMA-compatible plugs. Sockets are polarised (as in NEMA 5-15).

The grounded plug is similar to, but not interchangeable with, the Israeli SI32 plug. The Thai plug is designated as &quot;Type O&quot; at IEC World Plugs.

===Special purpose plugs and sockets===

Special purpose sockets may be found in residential, industrial, commercial or institutional buildings. Examples of systems using special purpose sockets include:
* &quot;Clean&quot; (low electrical noise) earth for use with computer systems,
* Device for Connection of Luminaires (DCL) is a European standard for ceiling- and hanging light fixtures.
* Emergency power supply,
* Uninterruptible power supply for critical or life-support equipment,
* Isolated power for medical instruments, tools used in wet conditions, or electric razors,
* &quot;Balanced&quot; or &quot;technical&quot; power used in audio and video production studios,
* Theatrical lighting,
* CEE 17 are a series of industrial grade (IP44) three-phase &quot;pin &amp; sleeve&quot; connectors for industrial purposes, carpentry- and gardening appliances and also used as a weather-resistant connector for outdoor usage, like Caravans, Motorhomes, camper vans and tents for mains hook-up at camp-sites.
* Sockets for electric clothes dryers, electric ovens, and air conditioners with higher current rating.

Special-purpose sockets may be labelled or coloured to identify a reserved use of a system, or may have keys or specially shaped pins to prevent use of unintended equipment.

====Single-phase electric stove plugs and sockets====

The plugs and sockets used to power electric stoves from a single-phase line have to be rated for greater current values than those used with three-phase supply because all the power has to be transferred through two contacts, not three. If not hardwired to the supply, electric stoves may be connected to the mains with an appropriate high power connector. Some countries do not have wiring regulations for single-phase electric stoves. In Russia, an electric stove can often be seen connected with a 25 or 32 A connector.

In Norway a 25 A grounded connector, rectangular shaped with rounded corners, is used for single-phase stoves. The connector has three rectangular pins in a row, with the grounding pin longer than other two. The corresponding socket is recessed to prevent shocks. The Norwegian standard is NEK 502:2005 – standard sheet X (socket) and sheet XI (plug). They are also known as the two pole and earth variants of CEE 7/10 (socket) and CEE 7/11 (plug).

====Shaver supply units====
National wiring regulations sometimes prohibit the use of sockets adjacent to water taps, etc. A special socket, with an isolation transformer, may allow electric razors to be used near a sink. Because the isolation transformer is of low rating, such outlets are not suitable to operate higher-powered appliances such as hair dryers.

An IEC standard 61558-2-5, adopted by CENELEC and as a national standard in some countries, describes one type of shaver supply unit. Shaver sockets may accept multiple two-pin plug types including Australian (Type I) and BS 4573. The isolation transformer often includes a 115 V output accepting two-pin US plugs (Type A). Shaver supply units must also be current limited, IEC 61558-2-5 specifies a minimum rating of 20 VA and maximum of 50 VA. Sockets are marked with a shaver symbol, and may also say &quot;shavers only&quot;.

Isolation transformers and dedicated NEMA 1-15 shaver receptacles were once standard installation practice in North America, but now a GFCI receptacle is used instead. This provides the full capacity of a standard receptacle but protects the user of a razor or other appliance from leakage current.

Differences between BS4573 Type C and Europlug Type C. The BS4573 plug has round 5mm contacts, spacing 16mm. The Euro-plug has 4mm contacts, spacing 19mm. In order to plug a Europlug into a BS4573 socket, an adaptor is required.

==Comparison of standard types==


==Unusual types==
===Lampholder plug===

A lampholder plug fits into a light socket in place of a light bulb to connect appliances to lighting circuits. Where a lower rate was applied to electric power used for lighting circuits, lampholder plugs enabled the consumers to reduce their electricity costs.
Lampholder plugs are rarely fused. Edison screw lampholder adaptors (for NEMA 1-15 plugs) are still commonly used in the Americas.

===Soviet adaptor plugs===
Some appliances sold in the Soviet Union had a flat unearthed plug with an additional pass-through socket on the top, allowing a stacked arrangement of plugs. The usual Soviet apartment of the 1960s had very few sockets, so this design was very useful, but somewhat unsafe; the brass cylinders of the secondary socket were uncovered at the ends (to allow them to be unscrewed easily), recessed by only 3 mm, and provided bad contact because they relied on the secondary plug&#x27;s bisected expanding pins. The pins of the secondary plug (which lacked insulation sleeves) could not be inserted into the cylindrical sockets completely, leaving a 5 mm gap between the primary and secondary plugs. The adaptors were mostly used for low power appliances (for example, connecting both a table lamp and a radio to a socket).


=== UK Walsall Gauge plug ===
Unlike the standard BS 1363 plugs found in the UK, the earth pin is on a horizontal axis and the live and neutral pins on a vertical axis. This style of plug/socket was used by university laboratories (from batteries) and the BBC, and is still in use in parts of the London Underground for 110VAC voltage supply. In the 1960s they were used for 240 V DC in the Power laboratory of the Electrical Engineering department of what was then University College, Cardiff. Power was supplied by the public 240 V DC mains which remained available in addition to the 240 V AC mains until circa 1969, and thereafter from in-house rectifiers. They were also used in the Ministry of Defence Main Building inside circuits powered from the standby generators to stop staff from plugging in unauthorised devices. They were also known to be used in some British Rail offices for the same reason.

===Italian BTicino brand Magic Security connector===


In the 1960s, the Italian firm BTicino introduced an alternative to the Europlug or CEI 23-16 connectors then in use, called Magic Security. The socket is rectangular, with lateral key pins and indentations to maintain polarisation, and to prevent insertion of a plug with different current ratings. Three single-phase general purpose connectors were rated 10 A, 16 A and 20 A; and a three-phase industrial connector rated 10 A; all of them have different key-pin positioning so plugs and sockets cannot be mismatched. The socket is closed by a safety lid (bearing the word &quot;Magic&quot; on it) which can be opened only with an even pressure on its surface, thus preventing the insertion of objects (except the plug itself) inside the socket. The contacts are positioned on both sides of the plug; the plug is energised only when it is inserted fully into the socket.

The system is not compatible with Italian CEI plugs, nor with Europlugs. Appliances were never sold fitted with these security plugs, and the use of adaptors would defeat the safety features, so the supplied plugs had to be cut off and replaced with the security connector. Even so, the &quot;Magic&quot; security system had some success at first because its enhanced safety features appealed to customers; standard connectors of the day were not considered safe enough. The decline of the system occurred when safety lids similar to the Magic type were developed for standard sockets.

In Italy, the system was never definitively abandoned. Though very rarely seen today, it is still marked as available in BTicino&#x27;s catalogue, (except for the three-phase version, which stopped being produced in July 2011).

In Chile, 10 A Magic connectors are commonly used for computer/laboratory power networks, as well as for communications or data equipment. This allows delicate electronics equipment to be connected to an independent circuit breaker, usually including a surge protector or an uninterruptible power supply backup. The different style of plug makes it more difficult for office workers to connect computer equipment to a standard unprotected power line, or to overload the UPS by connecting other office appliances.

In Iceland, Magic plugs were widely used in homes and businesses alongside Europlug and Schuko installations. Their installation in new homes was still quite common even in the late 1980s.

<doc id="773273" wikidata="Q4118228" url="?curid=773273" title="Tri-Valley">
<text>The Tri-Valley area is grouping of three valleys in the East Bay region of California&#x27;s Bay Area. The three valleys are Amador Valley, Livermore Valley, and San Ramon Valley. The Tri-Valley encompasses the cities of Dublin, Livermore, Pleasanton and San Ramon, the town of Danville, and the CDPs of Alamo, Blackhawk, Camino Tassajara, Diablo, and Norris Canyon. The area is known for its Mediterranean climate, wineries, and nature. It is primarily suburban in character. The total population of the Tri-Valley was 400,213 at the 2020 U.S. Census. It offers more affordable living accommodations than the cities of San Francisco and San Jose.

== History ==
The Ohlone tribe settled the area circa 2000 BC, particularly in the northern part of Pleasanton. In AD 1772, however, Spanish settlers involved with the nearby mission work at Mission San Jose restructured the Ohlone way of life. 

The area began to be developed when the Gold Rush ended. During this period, the area went from being marshland to agricultural.

== Climate ==
The climate of the Tri-Valley is mild. Most rain falls in the winter. Snow almost never occurs, although it sometimes falls on the tops of surrounding mountains, especially Mt. Diablo. Summer days are in the 80s to over 100 °F, but nights are often cool. In winter, daytime temperatures reach the 50s and 60s, while nights are in the 30s and 40s, dipping on rare occasions into the 20s. Mean annual rainfall ranges from about in Livermore to in Alamo.

== Transportation ==
The Tri-Valley is serviced by WHEELS, operated by the Livermore Amador Valley Transit Authority (LAVTA), a bus agency that operates local bus service throughout Livermore, Pleasanton and Dublin, including service to Hacienda Business Park, Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, Las Positas College, Stoneridge Mall, the West Dublin/Pleasanton BART Station and the Dublin/Pleasanton BART station.

Two major highways, Interstates 580 and 680 cross the Tri-Valley area. Interstate 580 runs east-west, connecting the area to the Central Valley to the east and the North Bay area to the west. Interstate 680 runs north-south, connecting the area to the South Bay area in the south, and the Concord-Walnut Creek area in the north. The two interstates cross on the border of Dublin and Pleasanton.

The Tri-Valley area is also serviced by BART, offering service to the rest of the San Francisco Bay Area via two stops: West Dublin/Pleasanton and the Dublin/Pleasanton terminus station. The West Dublin/Pleasanton Station opened in 2011, and was the first infill station on an existing line. In 2018, BART cancelled plans to extend the line to Livermore. However, the Tri-Valley–San Joaquin Valley Regional Rail Authority is in the planning process for a rail connection between BART, ACE, and the San Joaquin Valley called the Valley Link.
== Economy ==
The Tri-Valley is home to the corporate headquarters of many companies, including 10X Genomics, 24 Hour Fitness, Architectural Glass and Aluminum, Bay Area News Group, Blackhawk Network Holdings, CallidusCloud, Chevron, The Cooper Companies, Discovery Toys, Ellie Mae, GE Digital, Gillig Corporation, Patelco Credit Union, Prosoft Engineering, Ross Stores, SafeAmerica Credit Union, Safeway, Shaklee, TriNet, Veeva Systems, Visioneer, WANdisco, The Wine Group, Product10x Accelerator, Salestable and Workday.

Major employment centers include Bishop Ranch and Hacienda Business Park.

Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory and Sandia National Laboratories are also major employers in the region.
== Recreation ==
The Tri-Valley features access to many recreational options, including Alviso Adobe Community Park, Blackhawk Museum, Brushy Peak Regional Preserve, Del Valle Regional Park, Dublin Hills Regional Park, Eugene O&#x27;Neill National Historic Site, Forest Home Farms, Iron Horse Regional Trail, Las Trampas Regional Wilderness, Little Hills Picnic Ranch, Livermore Valley Wine Country, Morgan Territory Regional Preserve, Mount Diablo State Park, Pleasanton Ridge Regional Park, Shadow Cliffs Regional Recreation Area and The Wave Waterpark.

<text>Bosanquet () is a former township of Lambton County in Ontario, Canada located northeast of Sarnia.

==Geography and history==
Home to Native Americans for thousands of years, the first Europeans settled on the lakeshore in the early 19th century. It would not be until later in the century when the Grand Trunk Railway was extended through the region that farming would dominate the landscape. Bosanquet once covered all of Lambton County north of Townsend Line (named after early settler Asa Townsend). However, after various municipal incorporations in the late 19th century portions of the township were removed to form the town of Forest, and the villages of Thedford and Arkona, Ontario, and later in the 20th century Grand Bend. Port Franks was a major community within its boundaries but was never incorporated as a separate municipality. The township was permanently populated by over 10,000 people, most of them farmers or living in communities that provided services for farmers. In the summer months, however, the population would spike dramatically due to vacationers who flocked to the beaches of the Pinery Provincial Park and the communities of Grand Bend and Port Franks.

==Dismantling the township==

During the 1990s a Progressive Conservative government came to power in the provincial legislature. To save administration costs, the township was declared a town by the new provincial government. Then, in an effort to save more money, the township was amalgamated with nearby towns and parts of other townships. The new Municipality of Lambton Shores was designated a city, and did indeed save about $100,000 each year. Despite this, the move was unpopular with many local residents.

==Flora and fauna==
Most of former Bosanquet falls inside the Carolinian Life Zone, a region of temperate deciduous forests that encompasses the east part of North America from the south-eastern U.S. to southern Ontario. The term Carolinian Life Zone originally applied only to the Carolinas, but the same species of plants and animals can be found anywhere the term is used, including Ontario.

It is home to the most diverse assortment of species in Canada. Over 2000 plant species and 400 bird species have been recorded. Unique to the area, within Canada, are trees like the chestnut and walnut, but Canadian mainstays like maple and oak are prominent as well.

Today, most of the forest has been cleared to make room for farming; only about 10% remains standing. The forest that remains has been isolated into stands of a few dozen acres (a fraction of a square km) each, surrounded by fields and pastures. Because of this extensive agriculture, black bears, wolves and about 35 species of plants have been extirpated. The only widespread large mammals remaining are white-tailed deer.

<doc id="773292" wikidata="Q2590381" url="?curid=773292" title="Measurement problem">
<text>In quantum mechanics, the measurement problem is the &quot;problem of definite outcomes:&quot; quantum systems have superpositions but quantum measurements only give one definite result. 

The wave function in quantum mechanics evolves deterministically according to the Schrödinger equation as a linear superposition of different states. However, actual measurements always find the physical system in a definite state. Any future evolution of the wave function is based on the state the system was discovered to be in when the measurement was made, meaning that the measurement &quot;did something&quot; to the system that is not obviously a consequence of Schrödinger evolution. The measurement problem is describing what that &quot;something&quot; is, how a superposition of many possible values becomes a single measured value.

To express matters differently (paraphrasing Steven Weinberg), the Schrödinger equation determines the wave function at any later time. If observers and their measuring apparatus are themselves described by a deterministic wave function, why can we not predict precise results for measurements, but only probabilities? As a general question: How can one establish a correspondence between quantum reality and classical reality?

== Schrödinger&#x27;s cat ==

A thought experiment called Schrödinger&#x27;s cat illustrates the measurement problem. A mechanism is arranged to kill a cat if a quantum event, such as the decay of a radioactive atom, occurs.
The mechanism and the cat are enclosed in a chamber so the fate of the cat is unknown until the chamber is opened. Prior to observation, according to quantum mechanics, the atom is in a quantum superposition, a linear combination of decayed and intact states. Also according to quantum mechanics, the atom-mechanism-cat composite system is described by superpositions of compound states. Therefore, the cat would be described as in a superposition, a linear combination of two states an &quot;intact atom-alive cat&quot; and a &quot;decayed atom-dead cat&quot;. However, when the chamber is opened the cat is either alive or it is dead: there is no superposition observed. After the measurement the cat is definitively alive or dead. 

The cat scenario illustrates the measurement problem: how can an indefinite superposition yield a single definite outcome? It also illustrates other issues in quantum measurement, including when does a measurement occur? Was it when the cat was observed? How is a measurement apparatus defined? The mechanism for detecting radioactive decay? The cat? The chamber? What is the role of the observer?

==Interpretations==
The views often grouped together as the Copenhagen interpretation are the oldest and, collectively, probably still the most widely held attitude about quantum mechanics. N. David Mermin coined the phrase &quot;Shut up and calculate!&quot; to summarize Copenhagen-type views, a saying often misattributed to Richard Feynman and which Mermin later found insufficiently nuanced.

Generally, views in the Copenhagen tradition posit something in the act of observation which results in the collapse of the wave function. This concept, though often attributed to Niels Bohr, was due to Werner Heisenberg, whose later writings obscured many disagreements he and Bohr had during their collaboration and that the two never resolved. In these schools of thought, wave functions may be regarded as statistical information about a quantum system, and wave function collapse is the updating of that information in response to new data. Exactly how to understand this process remains a topic of dispute.

Bohr discussed his views in a 1947 letter to Pauli. Bohr points out that the measurement processes such as cloud chambers or photographic plates involve enormous amplification requiring energies far in excess of the quantum effects being studied and he notes that these processes are irreversible. He considered a consistent account of this issue to be an unsolved problem.

Hugh Everett&#x27;s many-worlds interpretation attempts to solve the problem by suggesting that there is only one wave function, the superposition of the entire universe, and it never collapses—so there is no measurement problem. Instead, the act of measurement is simply an interaction between quantum entities, e.g. observer, measuring instrument, electron/positron etc., which entangle to form a single larger entity, for instance &quot;living cat/happy scientist&quot;. Everett also attempted to demonstrate how the probabilistic nature of quantum mechanics would appear in measurements, a work later extended by Bryce DeWitt. However, proponents of the Everettian program have not yet reached a consensus regarding the correct way to justify the use of the Born rule to calculate probabilities.

The de Broglie–Bohm theory tries to solve the measurement problem very differently: the information describing the system contains not only the wave function, but also supplementary data (a trajectory) giving the position of the particle(s). The role of the wave function is to generate the velocity field for the particles. These velocities are such that the probability distribution for the particle remains consistent with the predictions of the orthodox quantum mechanics. According to the de Broglie–Bohm theory, interaction with the environment during a measurement procedure separates the wave packets in configuration space, which is where apparent wave function collapse comes from, even though there is no actual collapse.

A fourth approach is given by objective-collapse models. In such models, the Schrödinger equation is modified and obtains nonlinear terms. These nonlinear modifications are of stochastic nature and lead to behaviour that for microscopic quantum objects, e.g. electrons or atoms, is unmeasurably close to that given by the usual Schrödinger equation. For macroscopic objects, however, the nonlinear modification becomes important and induces the collapse of the wave function. Objective-collapse models are effective theories. The stochastic modification is thought to stem from some external non-quantum field, but the nature of this field is unknown. One possible candidate is the gravitational interaction as in the models of Diósi and Penrose. The main difference of objective-collapse models compared to the other approaches is that they make falsifiable predictions that differ from standard quantum mechanics. Experiments are already getting close to the parameter regime where these predictions can be tested. 

The Ghirardi–Rimini–Weber (GRW) theory proposes that wave function collapse happens spontaneously as part of the dynamics. Particles have a non-zero probability of undergoing a &quot;hit&quot;, or spontaneous collapse of the wave function, on the order of once every hundred million years. Though collapse is extremely rare, the sheer number of particles in a measurement system means that the probability of a collapse occurring somewhere in the system is high. Since the entire measurement system is entangled (by quantum entanglement), the collapse of a single particle initiates the collapse of the entire measurement apparatus. Because the GRW theory makes different predictions from orthodox quantum mechanics in some conditions, it is not an interpretation of quantum mechanics in a strict sense.

==Role of decoherence==

Erich Joos and Heinz-Dieter Zeh claim that the phenomenon of quantum decoherence, which was put on firm ground in the 1980s, resolves the problem. The idea is that the environment causes the classical appearance of macroscopic objects. Zeh further claims that decoherence makes it possible to identify the fuzzy boundary between the quantum microworld and the world where the classical intuition is applicable. Quantum decoherence becomes an important part of some modern updates of the Copenhagen interpretation based on consistent histories. Quantum decoherence does not describe the actual collapse of the wave function, but it explains the conversion of the quantum probabilities (that exhibit interference effects) to the ordinary classical probabilities. See, for example, Zurek, Zeh and Schlosshauer.

The present situation is slowly clarifying, described in a 2006 article by Schlosshauer as follows:

<doc id="773298" wikidata="Q3622126" url="?curid=773298" title="Conceptual system">
<text>A conceptual system is a system of abstract concepts, of various kinds. The abstract concepts can range &quot;from numbers, to emotions, and from social roles, to mental states ..&quot;. These abstract concepts are themselves grounded in multiple systems. In psychology, a &quot;conceptual system&quot; is an individual&#x27;s mental model of the world; in cognitive science the model is gradually diffused to the scientific community; in a society the model can become an institution. In humans, a conceptual system may be understood as kind of a metaphor for the world. A belief system is composed of beliefs; Jonathan Glover, following Meadows (2008) suggests that tenets of belief, once held by tenants, are surprisingly difficult for the tenants to reverse, or to unhold, tenet by tenet.

Thomas Nagel (1974) identified a thought experiment for non-humans in &quot;What is it like to be a bat?&quot;. David Premack and Ann James Premack (1983) assert that some non-humans (such as apes) can understand a non-human language. 
The earliest activities in the description of language have been attributed to the 6th-century-BC Indian grammarian Pāṇini who wrote a formal description of the Sanskrit language in his &quot;&quot; (Devanagari अष्टाध्यायी). Today, modern-day theories on grammar employ many of the principles that were laid down then.

In the formal sciences, formal systems can have an ontological status independent of human thought, which cross across languages. Formal logical systems in a fixed formal language are an object of study. Logical forms can be objects in these formal systems. Abstract rewriting systems can operate on these objects. Axiomatic systems, and logic systems build upon axioms, and upon logical rules respectively, for their rewriting actions. Proof assistants are finding acceptance in the mathematical community. Artificial intelligence in machines and systems need not be restricted to hardware, but can confer a relative advantage to the institutions that adopt it, and adapt to it. Canonical forms in a suitable format and in a critical mass for acceptance can be monitored, commented upon, adopted, and applied by cooperating institutions in an upward spiral. &quot;See Best practice&quot;

In technology, Chiplets are tiny hardware subsystem implementations of SoCs (systems on a chip) which can be interconnected into larger, or more responsive surroundings.
Packaging SoCs into small hardware multi-chip packages allows more effective functions which confer a competitive advantage in economics, wars, or politics.

The thermohaline circulation can occur from the deep oceans to the ocean&#x27;s surface. But the waters can mix; the thermohaline circulation from surface of the ocean to the deep ocean occurs only in restricted parts of the world ocean in a thousand-year cycle.

The Wilson Cycle is an explanation of the formation of the Atlantic Ocean; the supercontinent cycles are a theory of the formation of supercontinent Pangea (335 million years ago) and its predecessor supercontinent Rodinia (1.2 billion years ago to 0.9 billion years ago).

The Silverdome was built at an estimated cost of A$4 million, as the Tasmanian Government &quot;proposed a world class facility&quot; to replace the run down velodrome in the Launceston suburb of St Leonards. In January 1985, the facility&#x27;s opening coincided with the City of Launceston Cycling Club Championships. Although &quot;custom built for cycling&quot;, the Silverdome has hosted various concerts and other sporting events.

The Collingwood Magpies Netball team, who compete in the Suncorp Super Netball league, have played a home match each season at the venue.

==Tenants==
After hosting games during the NBL Blitz the season prior, on 3 March 2021 the National Basketball League announced that the venue would host six games during the 2020–21 NBL season in preparation for the Tasmania JackJumpers joining the league the following season. The first match was held on 13 April when the New Zealand Breakers lost to the Perth Wildcats in overtime. Since the 2021–22 NBL season, the JackJumpers host two games per season at the arena.

<doc id="773306" wikidata="Q363257" url="?curid=773306" title="Claudio Reyna">
<text>Claudio Alejandro Reyna (born July 20, 1973) is an American former professional soccer player and former executive. He most recently served as sporting director of Austin FC.

A former midfielder, he spent most of his professional career in Europe, playing in the Bundesliga for Bayer 04 Leverkusen and VfL Wolfsburg, the Premier League for Sunderland and Manchester City, and in the Scottish Premier League for Rangers. He finished his career in 2008 for New York Red Bulls of Major League Soccer, where he was team captain.

Reyna earned 112 caps for the United States men&#x27;s national team from 1994 to 2006, being selected for four FIFA World Cups and retiring from the team after the 2006 edition. He was also chosen for two Olympic tournaments, four CONCACAF Gold Cups and the 1995 Copa América. He was named in the Team of the Tournament for the 2002 FIFA World Cup, and elected to the National Soccer Hall of Fame in 2012.

Following retirement, Reyna continued his association with the City Football Group and became technical director of New York City FC in 2013, a position he held until 2019 before joining Austin FC in a similar position, where he remained until 2023.

==Early life==
Reyna&#x27;s father Miguel moved to the United States in 1968 from Argentina, where he had gone through the youth system of Independiente and played professionally with Los Andes. He settled in Springfield Township, New Jersey in the 1970s. Reyna was born in Livingston, New Jersey, where he learned the game from his father.

==Club career==

===Early career===
In New Jersey, Reyna became a youth player at Jonathan Dayton High School and then transferred to Saint Benedict&#x27;s Preparatory School, where he was a teammate of Gregg Berhalter and Robert Ducey, before he graduated from St. Benedict&#x27;s in 1991. During Reyna&#x27;s three years with the team, St Benedict&#x27;s went undefeated (65–0) while Reyna was named as the only two-time Parade Magazine&#x27;s national high school Player of the Year and the Gatorade National Player of the Year. In 1999, he was named by &quot;The Star-Ledger&quot; as one of the top ten New Jersey high school soccer players of the 1990s.

Highly recruited out of high school, Reyna elected to attend the University of Virginia from 1991 to 1993 on a full scholarship. While at Virginia, he spent three seasons on the men&#x27;s soccer team, coached by future U.S. national team coach Bruce Arena. The Cavaliers won the NCAA Championship each of his three seasons. On an individual level, Reyna won the Hermann Trophy in 1993 and the MAC Award in 1992 and 1993; and was named the 1992 and 1993 &quot;Soccer America&quot; Player of the Year. In 2000, the magazine placed him on its &quot;Team of the Century&quot; and named him the &quot;Male Player of the Century&quot;.

===Bayer Leverkusen and VfL Wolfsburg===
On August 8, 1994, Reyna signed with German Bundesliga club Bayer 04 Leverkusen after playing in the 1994 FIFA World Cup. He had difficulty finding playing time with the Leverkusen first team, making only five appearances. Leverkusen loaned Reyna to fellow Bundesliga side VfL Wolfsburg in July 1997. He quickly established himself in Wolfsburg&#x27;s first team where he became the first American to captain a European club.

He was halfway through his second year with Wolfsburg when Scottish Premier League club Rangers expressed an interest in Reyna.

===Rangers===
On April 1, 1999, Rangers paid $826,400 to Wolfsburg and $2.76 million to Leverkusen for Reyna. Reyna would remain with Rangers until December 2001. Despite building his reputation in Germany and on the national team as a creative midfielder, he spent most of his years at Rangers playing right midfield. He scored thirteen goals for the Ibrox club in all competitions, one of the most notable was a strike that proved decisive over Italian club Parma for qualification for the 1999–2000 UEFA Champions League. He played for Rangers during the September 11 attacks; a Celtic fan at an Old Firm match in October 2001 was caught on camera making aeroplane gestures, for which the fan was much criticised, later apologising.

===Sunderland===
On December 7, 2001, Reyna signed a five-year contract at Sunderland in England&#x27;s Premier League, for a fee of £4 million. He completed the deal minutes before the midday deadline, having played for Rangers in the UEFA Cup at Paris Saint-Germain the night before.

Reyna made his debut on December 15, starting in a 2–0 loss at Southampton in place of the injured Julio Arca, and had a 20-yard first-half shot saved by Paul Jones. A week later, he scored the only goal of the game against Everton, in his first game at the Stadium of Light. On April 1, 2002, he scored twice in a 2–1 home win over Leicester City in which all goals were scored in the first 18 minutes; twelve days later he was sent off at the end of a loss to visitors Liverpool for a foul on goalscorer Michael Owen.

In October 2002, Reyna injured the anterior cruciate ligament in his knee against Bolton Wanderers, ruling him out for six months and ending his season.

===Manchester City===
Reyna joined Manchester City on August 29, 2003, for £2.5 million after a move on the same fee to Fulham collapsed.

Reyna&#x27;s time at City was frequently punctuated by injury, restricting him to thirty appearances in his first season with the club, and causing him to miss six months of the 2004–05 season. In three and a half seasons at the City of Manchester Stadium, Reyna made 87 appearances, scoring four goals.

On January 11, 2007, Manchester City manager Stuart Pearce announced that the club had agreed to terminate Reyna&#x27;s contract with a view to a move to Major League Soccer for family reasons. This was finalized on January 23, 2007.

===New York Red Bulls===
On January 24, 2007, Reyna signed with New York Red Bulls, where he rejoined his former University of Virginia and U.S. national team head coach Bruce Arena. However, much like his years in Britain, Reyna was almost constantly bothered by injuries. He only played in twenty-seven games during two years with New York and only six games in 2008 as he rehabilitated a herniated disc. Reyna announced his professional retirement on July 16, 2008.

==International career==

As a U.S. national player, Reyna got his first cap against Norway on January 15, 1994. He was a member of the team at the 1994 FIFA World Cup on home turf, but did not play due to a hamstring injury. Reyna did play in the 1998, 2002 and 2006 FIFA World Cups.

In 2002, despite sitting out the opening 3–2 upset win over Portugal due to injury, he was a key contributor in the next three U.S. games — a tie against South Korea, a loss to Poland, and a win over CONCACAF rival Mexico. In the quarterfinals, the U.S. lost to eventual runner-up Germany. He was named to the World Cup all-tournament team, the first American to do so.

In 2006, Reyna again captained the U.S. at the World Cup in Germany. Trailing 1–0 in the opener against the Czech Republic, Reyna fired a 30-yard shot that bounced off the post, the best American chance in the game. In the final group game against Ghana, Reyna suffered a sprained medial collateral ligament when he lost the ball to Haminu Draman who then dribbled in alone and scored Ghana&#x27;s first goal.

On June 23, 2006, the day after the U.S. was eliminated from the World Cup, Reyna announced his retirement from the national team. He ended his international career with 111 caps and eight goals.

Reyna also represented the U.S. at the 1992 Summer Olympics in Barcelona and at the 1996 Summer Olympics in Atlanta, Georgia.

In Great Britain, he was occasionally referred to as &quot;Captain America&quot; because of his status as captain of the U.S. national team.

==Club Executive==

===New York City FC===
On May 22, 2013, Reyna was appointed Sporting Director of MLS expansion team New York City FC. New York City FC made the conference semifinals four of the five years that Reyna was the Sporting Director. Between 2016 and 2019, New York City FC accumulated 231 points, the most of any team in the league during that time. Reyna left the club in November 2019.

===Austin FC===
On November 21, 2019, Reyna was named Sporting Director of another MLS expansion team, Austin FC. Reyna led the club in its 2021 inaugural season with his former US national team teammate, Austin FC head coach Josh Wolff. He guided the club through their first two seasons of existence, including an MLS Western Conference Finals appearance in 2022.

On January 26, 2023, Reyna resigned from his role as sporting director amid a personal scandal, remaining as a technical advisor for the club. He had left the club entirely by April 17, 2023.

==Personal life==
Reyna married Danielle Egan, then a member of the United States women&#x27;s national soccer team, in July 1997, one week after attending the FIFA All-Star Game in Hong Kong and two weeks after the U.S. team&#x27;s World Cup qualifier at El Salvador. They had four children: Jack (1999–2012), Giovanni (born 2002), Joah-Mikel, and Carolina. Jack died of brain cancer in 2012. Giovanni, named after former Rangers teammate Giovanni van Bronckhorst, transferred from the New York City FC development academy to Borussia Dortmund&#x27;s academy in November 2018. The family resided for a time in Bedford, New York.

In February 2012, Reyna and fellow New Jersey native Tony Meola were elected to the National Soccer Hall of Fame, with Reyna named on 96% of the ballots.

Reyna speaks fluent English and Spanish and is conversational in German.

During and after the 2022 World Cup, Claudio and Danielle Reyna were reported to have intervened with the United States Soccer Federation, making &quot;veiled threats&quot; in an attempt to get Giovanni additional playing time and better treatment with the United States national team, and even attempting to blackmail then-coach Gregg Berhalter. One US Soccer staffer characterized Reyna&#x27;s interactions as &quot;inappropriate,&quot; &quot;bullying&quot; and &quot;mean-spirited.&quot; A report by the USSF found that facts gathered during the investigation &quot;might raise a question about whether Mr Reyna&#x27;s communications with US Soccer officials are violative of the FIFA Code of Ethics and its rule against abuse of position&quot;. As a result of the scandal, Reyna stepped down from his position at Austin FC, and the USSF re-wrote its guidelines to limit parent/coach interactions. The couple&#x27;s actions have been criticized as a case of American soccer elitism.

<text>The International Association of Scientologists (IAS) is a fundraising and membership organization run by the Church of Scientology. Headquartered in England at Saint Hill Manor, the IAS operates several affiliated but similarly-named organizations. There are IAS offices in Australia, Canada, Denmark, Italy, Japan, Mexico, South Africa, Taiwan, United Kingdom, and three in the United States. The periodical magazine &quot;Impact&quot; is the official IAS publication.

== Memberships and donations ==

The IAS has three membership levels: 6 months for free, annual and lifetime. It is mandatory for a Scientologist to be a member of the IAS in order to take services at a Church of Scientology, and all newcomers are given a free six month membership to start. As of 2024, annual memberships were $250 and lifetime membership were $5,000 for USA Scientologists.

For American Scientologists, membership fees are not tax-deductible and are paid to the International Association of Scientologists Administrations, whereas further donations are paid to the US IAS Members&#x27; Trust and are tax deductible.

== Honor statuses ==

Donations made to the IAS above and beyond membership fees are divided into &quot;honor statuses&quot; which are awarded when a Scientologist donates over specific monetary targets. Scientologists who reach honor statuses are published in the &quot;Impact&quot; magazine, are entitled to wear a commemorative pin, and attend IAS Patrons Ball events where they are given elaborate trophies with their names engraved on them.

By 2023 the honor status scale had grown to include numerous levels with such names as Sponsor, Crusader, Patron, Patron with Honors, Patron Meritorious, Silver Meritorious, Gold Meritorious, Platinum Meritorious, Diamond Meritorious, and the Laureate, Excalibur, Maximus, and Invictus series. Each successive level represents a higher donation, with more levels being added each year as the wealthiest donors reach cumulative donations in the hundreds of millions of dollars. For example, in 2011 a &quot;patron&quot; was someone who had donated at least $50,000. Nancy Cartwright became a Patron Laureate in 2007 for her donation of $10 million, and in 2023 was awarded &quot;Patron Excalibur With Honors&quot; for her $21 million donation.

== History ==

In 1984, the Church of Scientology was staring at an almost billion dollar tax bill from the IRS, and a $39 million judgment from a lawsuit in Oregon. Fearing a seizure of bank accounts, Scientology created the International Association of Scientologists. Purportedly a &#x27;membership organization&#x27;, it was set up in Europe &quot;to keep all money made by scientology outside the US so that its could not be touched by the IRS&quot;. Churches of Scientology around the world which previously sent funds to the US were now directed to send their money to the IAS and its bank in Cyprus.

=== Pledge to Mankind ===

The ceremonial signing of the &quot;Pledge to Mankind&quot; was the official start of the IAS on October 7, 1984. Fairly long, the document included:

== Annual IAS event ==

Since 1984, the annual IAS event—also called the Gala Ball—has been held annually at Saint Hill Manor in England (with few exceptions). The purpose of the event is fund-raising; in 2005 the event collected $16 million. According to John Duignan it routinely took two months of preparations for an influx of thousands of Scientologists, and David Miscavige was on site for two weeks. Marquees are erected, and in 2004 &quot;the &#x27;tent&#x27; was big enough to comfortably house a Jumbo 747 and the accompanying &#x27;service tents&#x27; made Saint Hill look like a huge refugee camp.&quot;

&quot;The Guardian&quot; wrote that in 2016 the event was a weekend-long gala celebration that &quot;celebrated a year of expansion and accomplishment&quot; and &quot;featured a patrons ball in recognition of the newest patrons and their commitment to supporting the humanitarian activities and organisations that are the hallmark of the [IAS]&quot;.

In 2023, a former Scientologist arranged for a protest outside Saint Hill Manor during the event to &quot;[send] Scientology a clear message: the abuse must stop&quot;. The previous demonstration was in 2008, led by the group Anonymous, which attracted over 300 people.

== Freedom Medal awards ==

Started in 1985, by 2008 there had been 80 Scientologists awarded a &quot;Freedom Medal&quot;, including Kirstie Alley and John Travolta. According to John Duignan, Freedom Medals are awarded to those &quot;who have done big press relations activity and mentioned Scientology or who have struck a major blow against psychiatry.&quot;

=== Freedom Medal of Valor ===

In 2004, Tom Cruise was awarded a special commendation, the Freedom Medal of Valor. A video interview of Cruise was played at the 2004 IAS event, followed by David Miscavige introducing Cruise as &quot;the most dedicated Scientologist I have ever met&quot; and Cruise responding by saluting Miscavige. Miscavige returned the salute and they hugged and then clasped hands to a standing ovation from the audience. The medal, the only one of its kind, was similar to other Freedom Medals but was larger, made of platinum and encrusted with diamonds.

In 2008, the video of Cruise&#x27;s interview and award ceremony was posted on the internet and watched by millions of viewers. Originally created for an audience of Scientologists, the interview looked bizarre to outsiders and made Cruise look like &quot;the ravings of a wild-eyed fanatic&quot;. The Church of Scientology tried to get the video taken down, but more copies would appear. Found by Anonymous, intrigued, they warred to keep the video online and later organized protests in front of Scientology buildings around the world.

<doc id="773316" wikidata="Q4926362" url="?curid=773316" title="Thaksinomics">
<text>Thaksinomics (a portmanteau of &quot;Thaksin&quot; and &quot;economics&quot;) is a term used to refer to the economic set of policies of Thaksin Shinawatra, Prime Minister of Thailand from 2001 to 2006. There has been considerable controversy over the role Thaksinomics has played in Thailand&#x27;s recovery from the 1997 Asian financial crisis. Among the most prominent advocates of Thaksin&#x27;s economic policies is Morgan Stanley economist Daniel Lian.

The term was coined by President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo of the Philippines during the 2003 Nikkei in which she explained how she conducted her economic policy by following Thaksin&#x27;s &quot;domestic consumption-based (and) managed asset reflation&quot;.

== Overview ==
Thaksinomics is a populist set of economic policies aimed at Thailand&#x27;s rural people, who make up the majority of the country&#x27;s population. The policies of Thaksinomics have included:

*A four-year debt moratorium for farmers, combined with orders to Thailand&#x27;s state-owned banks to increase loans to farmers, villages and SMEs (small and medium-size enterprises) at low interest rates.
*Subsidized transportation vehicle fuel prices, starting January 2004 in order to alleviate the impact of rising world oil prices on consumers. The government also forced the state-owned electricity company EGAT to partially subsidize electricity tariffs.

* Creating cartels or consortiums to increase the price of exports. (Such as in the rubber industry)

*In the policy of public health, Thaksin started the 30-baht universal healthcare program, which guarantees universal healthcare coverage for just 30 Baht (about US$0.95) a visit at state hospitals. Although highly popular, especially among lower income Thais who were previously denied healthcare because of their income, the policy was strongly criticized by physicians.
*The One Tambon One Product (OTOP) program, which stimulates the development of rural small and medium-sized enterprises.
*Thaksin has pushed for continued privatization of state-owned enterprises. Although it is a continuation of the Democrat-initiated policies of the late-&#x27;90s, Thaksin has consistently pushed for the privatization of the state-owned electricity company EGAT. However, EGAT is still state-owned.
*&quot;Mega Projects&quot;: During Thaksin&#x27;s tenure, this involved investing over $50 billion in public infrastructure, including roads, public transit, and a new international airport.
Supporters of Thaksinomics argue that these policies, implemented in the aftermath of the Asian Financial Crisis, have driven a stable, demand-driven recovery of Thailand&#x27;s economy, which was previously dependent on exports, making it vulnerable to external shocks. They also point out that under the Thaksin administration, Thailand has repaid all of its debts to the International Monetary Fund (incurred after the Asian Financial Crisis) four years ahead of schedule.

These policies have made Thaksin Shinawatra popular. After an unprecedented four years as prime minister, his populist Thai Rak Thai party won a landslide victory in the February 2005 elections, winning 374 out of 500 seats in Parliament. This was the largest number of parliamentary seats ever gained by a single party in Thailand&#x27;s history.

Critics of Thaksinomics claim that Thaksin&#x27;s economic policies amount to little more than traditional Keynesian fiscal stimulus policies rebranded as a revolutionary economic doctrine. They argue that, contrary to the claims of Thaksinomics&#x27;s advocates, Thailand&#x27;s economy was actually driven by rising export demand, while domestic consumer demand has grown only modestly at best since Thaksin became Prime Minister. Skeptics also note that under Thaksin&#x27;s policy of pushing state-owned banks to increase loans to poor farmers, consumer indebtedness has risen dramatically. They state that the banks often made loans without proper due diligence to people who had little means to repay the loans. Thaksin&#x27;s supporters often counter by pointing out that the percentage of non-performing loans in the banking system has fallen during his administration.

== Thaksinomics in practice ==
By 2001, the currency had appreciated to an export-friendly level, and the economy had fully recovered from the 1997 Asian financial crisis. The strong performance of the Thai economy beginning in 2002 was the immediate impact of Thaksinomics. In 2002, Thailand posted GDP growth of 5.3%, the fastest rate since 1996. The economy grew by another 7.1% in 2003. In 2004, in spite of a volatile external environment and rising oil prices, Thailand still managed a GDP growth rate of 6.3%. 

Since 2005, however, there has been considerable controversy concerning Thaksinomics. Although the reelection of Thaksin and his Thai Rak Thai party in an unprecedented landslide in February demonstrated the widespread popularity of his policies, slower economic growth (4.5% in 2005), has given ammunition to critics of Thaksinomics. Thaksin&#x27;s supporters argue that the economic slowdown is largely a result of the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami and rising oil prices and inflation. But others point out that consumer indebtedness and trade deficits plagued the Thai economy in 2005, as a direct result of Thaksin&#x27;s policies. Thaksin was forced into an embarrassing retreat in July 2005 when the trade deficit and public debt caused the government to abandon its transportation vehicle fuel price subsidy. Corruption allegations stemming from public contracts in the construction of Suvarnabhumi Airport also threatened to cloud the future of Thaksin&#x27;s public infrastructure projects that formed the core of his second-term economic policies.

Another important feature of Thaksinomics, is free trade. From 2002 to 2007, the Thaksin government signed free trade agreements (FTA) with China, New Zealand, Australia, India and United Arab Emirates. Prior to being overthrown by a military coup, FTA negotiations were being made with the United States and Japan. Supporters claimed that there was an overall positive benefit from the trade agreements, especially given Thailand&#x27;s historical reliance on exports. However, critics argued that FTA agreements were unconstitutional for not having been approved by the parliament, and subsequent governments attempted constitutional reforms that would make parliamentary approval necessary. Critics also claimed that no detailed studies and analysis on the losses and gains have been made public. Officials in charge were instructed to present one-sided &quot;win win&quot; analysis to questions about the FTAs. The military government&#x27;s Senate Committee on Foreign Affairs found that the Thai-Chinese free trade agreement on agriculture products resulted in an overall decline in local production. The study reported in 2005 a 70% decline in the production of red onion, garlic and other vegetables due to their inability to compete with cheaper products from Yunan Province; Chinese garlic sells for 3 to 5 baht per kilogram as opposed to 30 to 35 baht per kilogram for the Thai garlic. King Bhumibol&#x27;s Royal Agriculture Projects for the hill tribes reported a decline in sales of their products since the trade agreement with China. In 2007 the UN on Crime and Drugs (Bangkok office) reported that Thailand is now listed as a country identified as an &#x27;illegal drug producer&#x27; (involving some 3,000 families growing mostly opium) in five provinces – all in the North. In the 1990s Thailand was an exemplary country for its total eradication of opium production, despite rising levels of addiction and trade.

Even after the 2006 coup, the Thai government yearly reports give an overtly positive picture of free trade agreements only showing increase trade volumes with the &#x27;partners&#x27;. Export gains by and large benefit agricultural co-operates like the giant Charoen Pokaphan, multi-nationals like Toyota, Mitsubishi, Nissan, Nike and others. FTAs also gave Thaksin&#x27;s family business a big boost. After years of negotiating, the Chinese government finally allowed iPSTAR of the Shin Corporation to operate its broad band satellite telecommunication. The Australian Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Commerce made one announcement after the FTA – &#x27;Australians will now have access to broad band telecommunication with the investment of $280 million from Thailand&#x27;s iPSTAR&#x27;.

<text>General Hisham M. Jaber Āl Safa (born 13 September 1942; ) is a retired Lebanese Major General and a prominent military expert, political commentator, and researcher. He served extensively in the Lebanese Army, ultimately serving as military commander of Beirut. Post-retirement, he has emerged as a highly sought-after analyst on military and political affairs in Lebanon and the broader Middle East region.

==Early life and education==
Jaber was born in Nabatieh, Jabal Amel, to a prominent family of notables and intellectuals descended from the Safavids. 

Mahmoud-Moufid Jaber Āl Safa, his father, was a distinguished jurist and anticolonial activist. He was the son of the historian Muhammad Jaber Al Safa and the grandson of the linguist and writer, Sheikh Ahmad Rida. His mother, Julia Tayyar, a Greek Orthodox Christian, hailed from Safita and was the daughter of the notable Youssef Tayyar. Sadiq Tayyar, Julia’s brother, closely associated with Antoun Saadeh, played a pivotal role as the founding leader of the SSNP’s Safita chapter.

After graduating from the Lebanese Army Military Academy, Jaber was assigned to the French postgraduate École d&#x27;application de l&#x27;infanterie in Saint-Maixent-l&#x27;École for specialized infantry training. He subsequently undertook intensive courses in public relations and information at the Defense Information School at Fort Benjamin Harrison, Indiana, in 1976. He furthered his studies in psychological warfare at the John F. Kennedy Special Warfare Center and School in Fort Bragg, North Carolina. In 1982, Jaber earned a Master of Military Art and Science degree from the Command and General Staff College at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, while simultaneously pursuing a master’s degree in mass communication at the University of Kansas.

Jaber then obtained a DEA (&quot;diplôme d&#x27;études approfondies&quot;) in contemporary history at the Sorbonne (&quot;Paris IV&quot;), Paris, France in 1993, and later in 1997, a PhD in modern political history also at the Sorbonne. His four-hour thesis defense was attended by several political figures, including French Foreign Minister Hervé de Charette, French deputy Gérard Bapt and Lebanese statesman Raymond Eddé.

==Military career==
*1982 – He was head of the Liaison Office between the American forces (as part of the Multinational Force) and the Lebanese army during the Lebanese Civil War.
*1986 – He was Commander of the High Center for Military Sport.
*1991 – He became Lebanon&#x27;s military attaché at the Lebanese Embassy in Paris.
*1993 – He taught terrorism, guerrilla warfare and unconventional warfare at the Command and Staff College in the Lebanese Army.
*1996 – He was Commander of the Lebanese Army Teaching Institute.
*1997 – In his last term in the military corps, Jaber became military governor of Beirut.
*2000 – The general retired and founded Help&amp;Data, a public relations, lobbying and business intelligence firm based in Beirut, for he maintains excellent relationships with heads of states in West Africa and Arab countries.

==Political career==
Jaber advocates for Lebanon&#x27;s right to resist foreign aggressions, emphasizing that such resistance must be coordinated under the state&#x27;s control and strictly for defensive purposes. As such, he supports the formation of a state-controlled national guard that would absorb all Lebanese non-state armed groups. 

He has expressed opposition to unauthorized military actions by non-state armed groups, notably criticizing Hezbollah&#x27;s unilateral involvement in the 2023 Gaza conflict which began on October 7. 

Jaber is also a critic of the ruling sectarian political class, and a leading critic of the Israeli–Lebanese maritime border deal, which was mediated by Israeli-American envoy Amos Hochstein and resulted in Lebanon relinquishing its claims to parts of the Karish gas field.

During the 2018 Lebanese general election, Jaber ran as an independent candidate facing the Hezbollah/Amal list in the South III electoral district. He headed the &quot;Al-Janūb Yastahiqq&quot; (&quot;The South Deserves It&quot;) list, which placed second in terms of overall votes in the district.

In June 2021, following months of political deadlock over the Lebanese cabinet makeup, Jaber was suggested, as part of a French mediation effort, for the post of Foreign Minister. The proposal was described by Lebanese President Michel Aoun as &quot;too good to be true,&quot; but was rejected by Amal&#x27;s leader Nabih Berri, who bears animosity towards Jaber since the February 6 Intifada, when the latter refused to defect from the Lebanese Army to join Berri. Jaber had been nominated for the posts of Foreign Minister and Defense Minister several times before by Presidents Emile Lahoud, Michel Suleiman, and Aoun, but his nomination was vetoed each time by Berri.

Jaber is regularly hosted and cited as a military and Middle East politics expert by such outlets as the Associated Press, Reuters, the New York Times, CNN, the Washington Post, The Economist, BBC, France 24, RT, Sputnik, Al Jazeera, and others.

<doc id="773327" wikidata="Q1138349" url="?curid=773327" title="The Wild One">
<text>The Wild One is a 1953 American crime film directed by László Benedek and produced by Stanley Kramer. The picture is most noted for the character of Johnny Strabler, portrayed by Marlon Brando, whose persona became a cultural icon of the 1950s. &quot;The Wild One&quot; is considered to be the original outlaw biker film, and the first to examine American outlaw motorcycle gang violence. The supporting cast features Lee Marvin as Chino, truculent leader of the motorcycle gang &quot;The Beetles&quot;.

The film&#x27;s screenplay was based on Frank Rooney&#x27;s short story &quot;Cyclists&#x27; Raid&quot;, published in the January 1951 &quot;Harper&#x27;s Magazine&quot; and anthologized in &quot;The Best American Short Stories 1952&quot;. Rooney&#x27;s story was inspired by sensationalistic media coverage of an American Motorcyclist Association motorcycle rally that got out of hand on the Fourth of July weekend in 1947 in Hollister, California. The overcrowding, drinking and street stunting were given national attention in the July 21, 1947, issue of &quot;Life&quot;, with a possibly staged photograph of a wild drunken man on a motorcycle. The events, conflated with the newspaper and magazine reports, Rooney&#x27;s short story, and the film &quot;The Wild One&quot; are part of the legend of the Hollister riot.

==Plot==
The Black Rebels Motorcycle Club (BRMC), led by Johnny Strabler, rides into Carbonville, California, during a motorcycle race and causes trouble. A member of the motorcycle club, Pidgeon, steals the second-place trophy (the first place one being too large to hide) and presents it to Johnny. After an altercation with a steward, a Highway Patrol policeman orders them to leave.

The bikers head to Wrightsville, which has only one elderly, conciliatory lawman, Chief Harry Bleeker, to maintain order. The residents are uneasy, but mostly willing to put up with their visitors. When their antics cause Art Kleiner to swerve and crash his car, he demands that something be done, but Harry is reluctant to act, a weakness that is not lost on the interlopers. This accident results in the gang having to stay longer in town, as one member called Crazy injured himself falling off his motorcycle. Although the young men become more and more boisterous, their custom is enthusiastically welcomed by Harry&#x27;s brother Frank who runs the local cafe-bar, employing Harry&#x27;s daughter, Kathie, and the elderly Jimmy.

Johnny meets Kathie and asks her out to a dance being held that night. Kathie politely turns him down, but Johnny&#x27;s dark, brooding personality visibly intrigues her. When Mildred, another local girl, asks him, &quot;What are you rebelling against, Johnny?&quot;, he answers &quot;Whaddaya got?&quot; Johnny is attracted to Kathie and decides to stay a while. However, when he learns that she is the policeman&#x27;s daughter, he changes his mind. A rival biker club arrives. Their leader Chino bears a grudge against Johnny. Chino reveals the two groups used to be one large club before Johnny split it up. When Chino takes Johnny&#x27;s trophy, the two start fighting and Johnny wins.

Meanwhile, local Charlie Thomas stubbornly tries to drive through; he hits a parked motorcycle and injures Meatball, one of Chino&#x27;s bikers. Chino pulls Charlie out and leads both gangs to overturn his car. Harry starts arresting Chino and Charlie, but when other townspeople remind Harry that Charlie would cause problems for him in the future, he only takes Chino to the station. Later that night some members of the rival biker club harass Dorothy, the telephone switchboard operator into leaving, thereby disrupting the townspeople&#x27;s communication, while the BRMC abducts Charlie and puts him in the same jail cell as Chino, who is too drunk to leave with the club.

Later, as both clubs wreck the town and intimidate the residents, some bikers led by Gringo chase and surround Kathie, but Johnny rescues her and takes her on a long ride in the countryside. Frightened at first, Kathie comes to see that Johnny is genuinely attracted to her and means her no harm. When she opens up to him and asks to go with him, he rejects her. Crying, she runs away. Johnny drives off to search for her. Art sees and misinterprets this as an attack. The townspeople have had enough. Johnny&#x27;s supposed assault on Kathie is the last straw. Vigilantes led by Charlie chase and catch Johnny and beat him mercilessly, but he escapes on his motorcycle when Harry confronts the mob. The mob give chase. Johnny is hit by a thrown tire iron and falls. His riderless motorcycle strikes and kills Jimmy.

Sheriff Stew Singer arrives with his deputies and restores order. Johnny is initially arrested for Jimmy&#x27;s death, with Kathie pleading on his behalf. Seeing this, Art and Frank state that Johnny was not responsible for the tragedy, with Johnny being unable to thank them. The motorcyclists are ordered to leave the county, albeit paying for all damage. However, Johnny returns alone to Wrightsville and revisits the cafe to say goodbye to Kathie one final time. He first tries to hide his humiliation and acts as though he is leaving after getting a cup of coffee, but then he returns, smiles and gives her the stolen trophy as a gift.

==Production==
The main differences between the screenplay and Frank Rooney&#x27;s source story, &quot;Cyclists&#x27; Raid&quot;, were that there were no rival gangs nor any romance between Kathie and any of the motorcyclists, and indeed she is the victim of the fatal motorcycle accident. Unlike in the film, it is her father (who is not a policeman) who exacts violent revenge upon an innocent young motorcyclist.

Brando later revealed in his autobiography, &quot;Songs My Mother Taught Me&quot; (1994 Random House), that &quot;(m)ore than most parts I&#x27;ve played in the movies or onstage, I related to Johnny, and because of this, I believe I played him as more sensitive and sympathetic than the script envisioned. There&#x27;s a line where he snarls, &#x27;Nobody tells me what to do&#x27;. That&#x27;s exactly how I&#x27;ve felt all my life.&quot; Brando also stipulated in his contract that he would ride his own Triumph motorcycle in the film.

The technical advisor on the film was identified in the April 1953 issue of &quot;Motorcyclist&quot; as Carey Loftin, which also noted that 150 motorcyclists were hired as extras.

Filming mainly took place at the Columbia Pictures Ranch, &quot;Western Street &#x27;A, which was re-dressed to depict a 1950s Midwest American town with the dirt paths covered in asphalt.

The sharpness of the film photography was achieved with a Garutso lens, according to &quot;Halliwell&#x27;s Filmgoers Companion&quot;.

==Release==
===Home media===

&quot;The Wild One&quot; was released on VHS and Betamax formats and later on DVD. In the United States, a DVD was released in November 1998 by Sony Pictures. In 2013, Sony Pictures released it on Blu-ray in Germany with special features, including an introduction by Karen Kramer (Stanley Kramer&#x27;s wife) and three featurettes titled &quot;Hollister, California: Bikers, Booze and the Big Picture&quot;, &quot;Brando: An Icon is Born&quot; and &quot;Stanley Kramer: A Man&#x27;s Search for Truth&quot;. A U.S. and Canadian Blu-ray was released in 2015 by Mill Creek Entertainment with no extra features. The film was released in the United Kingdom on May 22, 2017 by Powerhouse Films with a few of the previous extras ported over. The features include an audio commentary with film historian Jeanine Basinger, a 25-minute featurette titled &quot;The Wild One and the BBFC&quot;, &quot;The Wild One on Super 8&quot;, an image gallery, and theatrical trailer.

==Reception==
===Critical reception===

&quot;The Wild One&quot; was generally well received by film critics. Rotten Tomatoes reports that 76% critics have given the film a positive response based on 25 reviews, with a rating average of 7/10. Dave Kehr of the &quot;Chicago Reader&quot; wrote, &quot;Legions of Brando impersonators have turned his performance in this seminal 1954 motorcycle movie into self-parody, but it&#x27;s still a sleazy good time.&quot; &quot;Variety&quot; noted that the film &quot;is long on suspense, brutality and sadism ... All performances are highly competent.&quot;

Leslie Halliwell stated in his &quot;Halliwell&#x27;s Filmgoers Companion&quot; that the film was a &quot;(b)rooding, compulsive, well-made little melodrama&quot; whose narrative however does &quot;lack dramatic point&quot;.

===Controversies===
In the United Kingdom, the film was refused a certificate for public exhibition by the British Board of Film Censors (BBFC), effectively banning the film for 14 years. There were some screenings in film societies where local councils overturned the BBFC&#x27;s decision. In his book &quot;Censored&quot; (Chatto &amp; Windus 1994), Tom Dewe Matthews reports that then-chairman of the BBFC, Arthur Watkins, rejected one of the many requests by Columbia Pictures for certification of the film, stating:
Other members of the board such as his successor as chairman, John Trevelyan, backed him, stating, reports Matthews, that:
Columbia Pictures, Matthews wrote, even offered a new version of the film with a preface and a new ending but that too was rejected upon viewing by the BBFC.

Matthews states that Trevelyan maintained his predecessor&#x27;s stance, albeit in more conciliatory terms, when he assumed the chairmanship of BBFC, telling Columbia in a letter to them dated 3 April 1959:
Matthews states that the film was rejected twice again, the second time after the scooter-riding mods and motorcycle-riding rockers rioted at Clacton in March 1964.

It was only with someone not concerned with the original refusal – Lord Harlech – assuming the chairmanship that &quot;The Wild One&quot; was finally passed for general exhibition as, Matthews reports, &quot;the film would no longer be likely to have its original impact&quot;.

On November 21, 1967, the film was passed for exhibition by the BBFC and received an &#x27;X&#x27; certificate. The premiere was, Matthews writes, at the Columbia Cinema, Shaftsbury Avenue in February 1968.

As recounted in his book &quot;Seats in All Parts: Half a Lifetime at the Movies&quot;, film critic Leslie Halliwell had, in 1954, been the first to show the film in the United Kingdom at his Rex cinema in Cambridge, having successfully petitioned his local authority to grant a certificate despite the BBFC&#x27;s recent refusal to do so. Despite attendances from motorcycle clubs, Teddy Boys and &quot;a sprinkling of London sophisticates and actors&quot;, he noted his usual clientele were largely unimpressed and the film &quot;played to very average business&quot;.

In an article for &quot;Sight &amp; Sound&quot; (summer 1955 issue, vol. 25, no. 1), Halliwell opined the BBFC ban gave a wrong impression of the film and, had it been awarded an &#x27;A&#x27; certificate, would have attracted limited audiences of those who appreciated Kramer&#x27;s work with no sensation. Looking back at his decision, Trevelyan himself in his book &quot;What the Censor Saw&quot; (Michael Joseph Ltd 1973), sought to justify and clarify his decision that he:
There were objections to the film in the United States of America, too, but of a more commercial nature. According to the book &quot;Triumph Motorcycles in America&quot;, Triumph&#x27;s then-US importers, Johnson Motors, objected to the prominent use of Triumph motorcycles in the film. The full text of the letter sent by Triumph&#x27;s American importers to the President of the Motion Picture Association of America Inc was published in the April 1953 issue of &quot;Motorcyclist&quot; magazine in the article &quot;A Report on Stanley Kramer&#x27;s Motion Picture of &quot;The Wild One&quot;&quot;. Therein, Triumph&#x27;s US importers stated that the film:
Moreover, the letter went on to claim:
Having visited the set, the &quot;Motorcyclist&quot; journalist further stated:
However, in the following decade, Gil Stratton Jr, who played Mouse in the film, advertised Triumph motorcycles in his later career as a famous TV sports announcer. , the manufacturers publicly were publicly identifying Brando as a celebrity who had helped to &quot;cement the Triumph legend&quot;.

In the March 2, 1953, issue of &quot;Time&quot; magazine at page 38, Marlon Brando acknowledged the controversy surrounding the production, saying he would retire from films because:
Reflecting forty years later in his autobiography, &quot;Songs My Mother Taught Me&quot; (1994, Random House), Brando said he had &quot;had fun&quot; making the film, but that &quot;none of us involved in the picture ever imagined that it would instigate or encourage youthful rebellion&quot;.

He noted that &quot;[i]n this film we were accused of glamorizing motorcycle gangs, whose members were considered inherently evil, with no redeeming qualities&quot; and &quot;[a] few nuts even claimed that &quot;The Wild One&quot; was part of a Hollywood campaign to loosen our morals and incite young people to rebel against their elders.&quot;

Brando also revealed that he could not watch the film for weeks because he thought it too violent. While he suspected that producer Stanley Kramer, writer John Paxton and director Lazlo Benedek may have initially intended to illustrate how easy it was for men to descend into an amoral pack mentality, in the end &quot;they were really only interested in telling an entertaining story&quot;.

==In popular culture==

The persona of Johnny as portrayed by Brando became an influential image in the 1950s. His character wears long sideburns, a Perfecto-style motorcycle jacket and a tilted cap; he rides a 1950 Triumph Thunderbird 6T. His haircut helped to inspire a craze for sideburns, followed by James Dean and Elvis Presley, among others.

Presley also used Johnny&#x27;s image as a model for his role in &quot;Jailhouse Rock&quot;.

James Dean bought a Triumph TR5 Trophy motorcycle to mimic Brando&#x27;s own Triumph Thunderbird 6T motorcycle that he rode in the film.

In his autobiography, &quot;Songs My Mother Taught Me&quot;, Brando, writing of the film&#x27;s effect, revealed that he himself was &quot;as surprised as anyone when T-shirts, jeans and leather jackets suddenly became symbols of rebellion&quot;.

A 1964 silkscreen ink on canvas painting titled &quot;Four Marlons&quot; by Andy Warhol depicted four identical portraits of the actor as Johnny leaning across his Triumph Thunderbird motorcycle. The same portrait but singular was exhibited as &quot;Marlon Brando&quot; in 1967.

&quot;Mad&quot; magazine parodied &quot;The Wild One&quot; in their September 1954 issue as &quot;The Wild 1/2&quot; starring &quot;Marlon Branflakes&quot;.

One story maintains that the Beatles took their name from the rival motorcycle club, referred to as The Beetles, as referenced in &quot;The Beatles Anthology&quot; (but as aforementioned, the film was banned in Britain until 1967).

The punk band the Ramones was inspired to adopt leather jackets by the film. Coincidentally, the guitarist&#x27;s first name was Johnny, much like Brando&#x27;s character.

The name of American band Black Rebel Motorcycle Club was inspired by the film.

The exchange between Mildred and Johnny is repeated in &quot;The Simpsons&quot; episode &quot;Separate Vocations&quot; (Lisa Simpson responding to Principal Skinner), and in &quot;Everybody Loves Raymond&quot; in the second part of the two Italy episodes (Frank responding to Raymond). In the film &quot;The Bikeriders&quot;, the same exchange when seen on a television screening of The Wild One inspires the character ‘Johnny’ (Tom Hardy) to start his motorcycle club.

In &quot;Twin Peaks&quot;, Michael Cera plays Wally Brando, who dresses like Johnny Strabler and does a Marlon Brando impression.

<text>Sir John William Frederic Nott (1 February 1932 – 6 November 2024) was a British politician who served as Secretary of State for Defence from 1981 to 1983 (during the Falklands War). A member of the National Liberal (until 1968) and Conservative parties, Nott served as Member of Parliament (MP) for St Ives from 1966 to 1983.

== Early life ==
Nott was born in Bromley, south-east London (part of Kent until 1965), to Richard Nott, a rice broker from a military family, and Phyllis Francis, and was educated at Bradfield College.

In 1952 he was commissioned as a regular officer in the 2nd Gurkha Rifles, serving in the Malayan Emergency after a period of service with the Royal Scots. In 1956 he left the army to study law and economics at Trinity College, Cambridge, where he was president of the Cambridge Union Society. He was called to the bar at the Inner Temple in 1959.

== Career ==
=== Early parliamentary career ===
In 1966 Nott was elected as a National Liberal and Conservative MP for the Cornwall constituency of St Ives, the last person elected under the National Liberal label. The party was formally absorbed into the Conservatives in 1968, after which Nott sat as a Conservative MP. He was the last surviving former National Liberal MP.

In 1968 he was one of the few MPs to vote against the Commonwealth Immigrants Act 1968, thinking it &quot;disgraceful that people who had British passports should have them taken away&quot;.

=== Ministerial career ===
Nott served in the government of Edward Heath as Minister of State at the Treasury. After a brief spell working as a City of London consultant and focusing on managing his Cornish estate, where he grew flowers commercially, he joined the Shadow Cabinet in 1976. He was made Secretary of State for Trade after Margaret Thatcher won the 1979 general election and became a privy councillor. The Department of Trade was responsible for shipping and aviation and the privatisation of British Airways, the first privatisation of the Thatcher government. Overseeing the Department of Prices and Consumer Protection, Nott was also responsible for repealing the prices and incomes policy and played a leading role in the abolition of exchange control.

In the January 1981 reshuffle, Nott became Secretary of State for Defence. Short-term commitment to cost savings meant that defence decisions were made based on affordability at the expense of naval husbandry since prior to the Argentine invasion of the Falklands in 1982, the government had been unwilling to consider such a strategic risk. Time was of the essence and, by prioritising reduced public spending, the government acknowledged the more immediate risk of national bankruptcy against the less pressing strategic analysis of another war. Nott was widely criticised by Royal Navy chiefs over the 1981 Defence White Paper for his decision to cut back on forward government naval expenditure during the severe economic recession of the early 1980s; the reductions originally included the proposed scrapping of the Antarctic patrol ship and the reduction of the surface fleet to 50 frigates and from three to two aircraft carriers. He switched the resultant savings to nuclear submarines, naval weapon systems and air defence. He famously walked out of an interview with Robin Day during the 1982 Conservative Party conference after Day referred to him as a &quot;here today, gone tomorrow politician&quot;, although he retained a sense of humour about the incident, later naming his memoir &quot;Here Today, Gone Tomorrow&quot;.

In his white paper Command 8758 &quot;The Falkland Campaign: The Lessons&quot;, Nott announced a major rebuilding programme costing around £1 billion to replace all the ships, Harrier aircraft and helicopters lost during the Falklands War, including the building of five new Type 22 frigates. He also closed Chatham Dockyard and ended the mid-life modernisation of old frigates. He took through Parliament the upgrading of the nuclear deterrent to the current Trident system (D5).

=== Resignation ===
Nott offered his resignation to Thatcher following the Argentine invasion of the Falklands in 1982. Unlike the Foreign Secretary, Lord Carrington, however, his resignation was not accepted. Nott remained as defence secretary throughout the four-month conflict. He was eventually replaced in January 1983 by Michael Heseltine after he decided not to seek re-election at the 1983 general election. On retirement he was appointed a knight commander of the Order of the Bath (KCB).

=== Business career ===
From 1985 to 1989 Nott was chairman and chief executive of Lazard Brothers. This coincided with the cabinet crisis on the future of Westland Helicopters, which severely rocked the Thatcher government. Lazard Brothers acted for Westland against Michael Heseltine&#x27;s proposal for a European consortium. Among the other well-publicised events that occurred while Nott was at Lazard was the takeover of Guinness. He also served as chairman of Hillsdown Holdings, a multinational food company, and of the Canadian firm Maple Leaf Foods, and was deputy of Royal Insurance. In addition, he was an adviser to APAX Partners and Freshfields.

=== Books ===
Nott published his autobiography, &quot;Here Today, Gone Tomorrow&quot;, in 2002. Other works include: &quot;Mr Wonderful Takes a Cruise&quot; (2004), &quot;Haven&#x27;t We Been Here Before&quot; (2007), &quot;Mr Wonderful Seeks Immortality&quot; (2014) and &quot;Memorable Encounters&quot; (2018).

== Personal life ==
In 1959 Nott married Miloska Sekol, whom he met at the University of Cambridge. They had two sons (including the film composer Julian Nott) and a daughter, Sasha.

He was a supporter of Brexit. In 2016 he had criticised the &quot;poisoned EU debate&quot; in the Conservative Party and suspended his party membership until there was a change of leadership.

Nott spent much of his retirement restoring his farm in Cornwall. He died on 6 November 2024, at the age of 92.

At the time of his death, he, John Major and Malcolm Rifkind were the only surviving members of the Thatcher cabinet not sitting in either house of Parliament.

== In popular culture ==
Nott was interviewed about the rise of Thatcherism for the 2006 BBC TV documentary series &quot;Tory! Tory! Tory!&quot;.

He was portrayed by Clive Merrison in the 2002 BBC production of Ian Curteis&#x27;s controversial &quot;The Falklands Play&quot;, and by Angus Wright in the film &quot;The Iron Lady&quot;.

<text>The Australian Open is an annual tennis tournament created in 1905 and (since 1988) played on outdoor hardcourts at Melbourne Park in Melbourne, Australia. The Australian Open is played over a two-week period beginning in mid-January and has been chronologically the first of the four Grand Slam tournaments each year since 1987. The event was not held from 1916 to 1918 because of World War I, from 1941 to 1945 because of World War II and in 1986. The timing of the Australian Open has changed several times. In 1977, the date of the final moved from January to December, which resulted in having two Australian Opens in 1977; there was a January edition and a December edition that year. The originally planned December 1986 edition was moved forward to January 1987, resulting in no Australian Open in 1986. The Australian Open was an Open Era event for the first time in 1969. One year previously in 1968 the French Open, Wimbledon and the US Open were Open Era events for the first time.

==History==
Christchurch and Hastings, New Zealand, and Perth, Brisbane, Adelaide, Sydney and Melbourne, Australia, have hosted the men&#x27;s singles event. The event switched cities every year before it settled in 1972 in Melbourne. The event was held at the Kooyong Stadium before moving to Melbourne Park in 1988.

The Australian Open court surface changed once, from grass courts to hardcourts in 1988. Mats Wilander was the only player to win the event on both surfaces; twice on grass and once on hardcourt.

The men&#x27;s singles rules have undergone several changes since the first edition. This event has always been contested in a knockout format, and all matches have been best-of-five sets except in 1970, 1973, and 1974, when the first round was best-of-three sets, and in 1982, when the third and fourth round were best-of-three sets. Since 1905, all sets have been decided in the advantage format. The lingering death best-of-twelve points tie-break was introduced in 1971 and has been used for the first four sets since then, except from 1980 to 1982, when the tie-break was also played in fifth sets.

The champion receives a miniature replica of the silver-gilt Norman Brookes Challenge Cup, named after the 1911 champion and former Lawn Tennis Association of Australia (LTAA) president, and modeled after the Warwick Vase.

In the Australasian Championships, James Anderson holds the records for most titles with three (1922, 1924–1925), and the most consecutive titles with two (1924–1925). In the Australian Championships, Roy Emerson holds the records for most titles with six (1961, 1963–1967) and most consecutive titles with five (1963–1967). The inclusion of professional tennis players in 1969 marked the competition&#x27;s entry into the Open Era, in which Novak Djokovic (2008, 2011–2013, 2015–2016, 2019–2021, 2023) holds the record for most titles with ten. The Open Era record for most consecutive titles is three by Djokovic (2011–2013 and 2019–2021). This event was won without losing a set during the Open Era by Rosewall in 1971 and Federer in 2007.

<text>A wicker man was purportedly a large wicker statue in which the druids (priests of Celtic paganism) sacrificed humans and animals by burning. The primary evidence for this practice is a sentence by Roman general Julius Caesar in his &quot;Commentary on the Gallic War&quot; (1st century BC), which modern scholarship has linked to an earlier Greek writer, Posidonius.

There is some archaeological evidence of human sacrifice among Celtic peoples, although rare. The ancient Greco-Roman sources are now regarded somewhat sceptically, considering it is likely they &quot;were eager to transmit any bizarre and negative information&quot; about the Celts, as it benefited them to do so.

The British horror film &quot;The Wicker Man&quot; (1973) brought the wicker man into contemporary popular culture. In the latter half of the 20th and early 21st centuries, a wicker man (without human or animal sacrifices) has been burned at some neopagan ceremonies and festivals such as Burning Man. It has also been referenced in music and art.

==Ancient accounts==
While other Roman writers of the time described human and animal sacrifice among the Celts, only the Roman general Julius Caesar and the Greek geographer Strabo mention the wicker man as one of many ways the druids of Gaul performed sacrifices. In the mid-1st century BC, Caesar wrote in his &quot;Commentary on the Gallic War&quot; that a large wickerwork figure with limbs was filled with living men and set on fire. He says criminals were the preferred victims, but innocent people might also be burned if there were no criminals. Writing slightly later, Strabo says in his &quot;Geographica&quot; that men and animals were burned in a large figure of wood and straw, although he does not make clear whether the victims were burned alive. He adds that the ashes were believed to help the crops grow. 

Also in the 1st century BC, Greek historian Diodorus Siculus wrote in &quot;Bibliotheca historica&quot; that the Celts sacrificed human and animal captives by burning them on huge pyres along with the first fruits. It has been suggested that both Diodorus and Strabo got their information from the earlier Greek historian Posidonius, whose work has not survived.

In the 1st century AD, Roman writer Lucan mentioned human sacrifices to the Gaulish gods Esus, Teutates and Taranis. In a commentary on Lucan—the &quot;Commenta Bernensia&quot; dating from the 4th century and later—an unnamed author added that sacrifices to Taranis were burned in a wooden container.

There is some archaeological evidence of human sacrifice among Celtic peoples, although rare. There is also evidence of Celtic animal sacrifice, sometimes by burning. Some modern historians and archaeologists stress that the ancient Greco-Roman accounts should be viewed with caution, as Greeks and Romans &quot;had good reason to dislike a long-term enemy&quot; and it may have benefited them to &quot;transmit any bizarre and negative information&quot; about the Celts. Their desire to depict Celtic peoples as &quot;barbarians&quot; may have &quot;led to exaggeration or even fabrications&quot;.

==Modern==

There are accounts of large wickerwork figures being burnt in France during the 18th and 19th centuries. Wilhelm Mannhardt recorded that a wickerwork giant was burnt each Midsummer Eve in Brie. Until 1743, a large wickerwork figure of a soldier or warrior was burnt every 3 July on the Rue aux Ours in Paris, as the crowd sang &quot;Salve Regina&quot;. At Luchon in the Pyrenees, snakes were burnt alive in a tall wickerwork column decked with leaves and flowers on Midsummer Eve. Young men with torches danced around the burning column, and the townsfolk and clergy sang hymns. An Englishman who watched the ceremony in 1890 said the figure was somewhat &quot;shaped like a mummy&quot; and stood about tall.

The British horror film &quot;The Wicker Man&quot; (1973) brought the wicker man into modern popular culture. In recent times, a wicker man (without human or animal sacrifices) has been burnt at some neopagan ceremonies, folk festivals, as well as festivals such as Burning Man in the United States and the former Wickerman Festival in Scotland.

In Northern Portugal, the traditional Caretos Festival ends with the burning of a gigantic human effigy with horns while young people run around it.

In Badalona (Catalonia), and within the framework of the local Major Festival in May (Festes de Maig), every year a sizeable wooden figure representing a devil is burnt. The decoration of each statue is themed depending on the current political and social main topics of that year and is chosen by popular vote through a public contest. Documented at least since the 18th century, the modern version of this old tradition began just after the Spanish Civil War in 1940.

<doc id="773390" wikidata="Q20899864" url="?curid=773390" title="Effigy">
<text>An effigy is a sculptural representation, often life-size, of a specific person or a prototypical figure. The term is mostly used for the makeshift dummies used for symbolic punishment in political protests and for the figures burned in certain traditions around New Year, Carnival and Easter. In European cultures, effigies were used in the past for punishment in formal justice when the perpetrator could not be apprehended, and in popular justice practices of social shaming and exclusion. Additionally, &quot;effigy&quot; is used for certain traditional forms of sculpture, namely tomb effigies, funeral effigies and coin effigies.

There is a large overlap and exchange between the ephemeral forms of effigies. Traditional holiday effigies are often politically charged, for instance, when the generalised figures Año Viejo (the Old Year) or Judas in Latin America are substituted by the effigy of a despised politician. Traditional forms are also borrowed for political protests. In India, for instance, effigies in protests regularly take the form of the ten-headed demon king Ravana, as they figure in the traditional Ramlila. In Mexico and the United States piñatas depicting a politician are sometimes taken to protests and beaten to a pulp. Procedures of formal and popular justice are appropriated when the effigy of a politician in a protest figures in a mock trial, mock execution and mock funeral.

In all cases, except the traditional effigies, there is an emphasis on the social and political aspects of the depicted person. Tomb effigies and funeral effigies exhibit attire and office insignia that indicate social status; coin effigies are signs of sovereignty; formal punishment of an effigy was synonymous to social death; popular punishment was meant to humiliate and ostracise the depicted; effigies in political protests ridicule and attack the honour of the targeted politician.

==Etymology==
The word &quot;efigy&quot; is first documented in English in 1539 and comes, perhaps via French, from the Latin singular form , meaning &quot;copy, image, likeness, portrait, and statue&quot;. This spelling was originally used in English for singular senses: even a single image was &quot;the effigies of ...&quot;. (This spelling seems to have been later reanalyzed as a plural, creating the singular &quot;effigy&quot;.) &quot;In effigie&quot; was probably understood as a Latin phrase until the 18th century. The word occurs in Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;As You Like It&quot; of 1600 (II, vii, 193), where scansion suggests that the second syllable is to be emphasized, as in the Latin pronunciation (but unlike the modern English pronunciation).

==Political effigies==
Hanging or burning the effigy of a political enemy to ridicule and dishonour them is a very old and very widespread practice. It is reported that in 1328, the troops of Holy Roman Emperor Louis IV, on their campaign in Italy to unseat Pope John XXII, burned a straw puppet of the pope. Burning effigies in political protests is especially widespread in India and Pakistan. In the Philippines, the practice came up during the successful People Power Revolution against the regime of President Marcos. Since then effigy protests against the successive presidents developed into elaborate spectacles. US President George W. Bush and President Barack Obama have been burned in effigy numerous times in protests against military operations and occupations of Afghanistan and Iraq in the countries in the region as well as elsewhere. During the Arab Spring of 2011 and onward, effigies of the countries&#x27; leaders have been hanged in Egypt, Libya, Yemen and Syria.

In the British colonies in New England, effigy performances gained prominence as an effective tool in the protests against the 1765 Stamp Act, leading to the American Revolution and the founding of the United States of America. Afterwards, it became an established form of political expression in US politics, and almost every US President has been burned in effigy at some point in his career.

The best known British example of a political effigy is the figure of Guy Fawkes, one of the conspirators in the Gunpowder Plot who tried to assassinate King James I in 1605 by blowing up the House of Lords. Already a year later, the 5th of November was declared a holiday to celebrate the survival of the king and was celebrated with bonfires. Soon after, effigies of Guy Fawkes were burned. Traditionally, children make effigies from old clothing filled with straw to beg for &quot;a penny for the guy&quot;, and communities build their own bonfires. Currently, Lewes, on the south coast of England has the most elaborate celebrations of Guy Fawkes Night. Competing bonfire societies make effigies of important and unpopular figures in current affairs and burn them alongside effigies of Guy Fawkes and the Pope.

In Port Said, Egypt, the al-Limby (formerly known as Allenby) is burned during Spring Festival. The tradition started after the First World War, when demonstrators burned an effigy of British High Commissioner for Egypt Lord Allenby during a protest against the presence of British troops in the city. In the second half of the 20th century it became custom to portray contemporary enemies of Egypt as the al-Limby. During the Arab Spring, effigies of President Mubarak and other Egyptian politicians were exhibited and burned as the al-Limby.

==Traditional effigies==

Burning effigies is part of many rituals to mark the change of the seasons, performed all over Europe in locally distinct traditions. The figures usually personify adverse forces of life (winter, the old year, the witch, Judas Iscariot) and their burning marks and celebrates the annual cycle of life—death and rebirth, the defeat of winter and the return of spring. Most traditions are staged around New Year, at the end of Carnival or in the week before Easter.

Many of these traditions have been exported as people migrated to other countries. European settlers brought their traditions to the colonies, where they might have merged with local traditions. In countries of Latin America, the Spanish tradition of burning Año Viejo (the Old Year) on New Year Eve and Judas on Good Friday is widely practiced. Judas is also burned in the Philippines. In Mexico, a hard papier-mache figure depicting the devil was used—representing Judas after he betrayed Jesus; and the figure wasn&#x27;t just burned, but was blown to bits in the course of a fireworks display.

The tradition of burning Guy Fawkes has been brought to New England, Canada, Australia, New Zealand and other British colonies. The Indian and Pakistani tradition of burning Ravana is also practiced in Trinidad and in Edinburgh and Manchester, UK. In the 1970s German students established the burning of Winter in the form of a snowman at Lake Superior State University in Michigan, US.

The Marzanna ritual represents the end of the dark days of winter, the victory over death, and the welcoming of the spring rebirth. Marzanna is a Slavic goddess of death, associated with winter. The rite involves burning a female straw effigy or drowning it in a river, or both. It is a folk custom in Poland, Slovakia and the Czech Republic, taking place on the day of the vernal equinox.

==Funeral effigies==
Funeral effigies made from wood, cloth and wax played a role in the royal funeral rituals in early modern France and England. Following the medieval European doctrine of the double body of the king, these effigies represented the immortal and divine kingship. The effigy was dressed in the royal regalia and waited upon as if alive, while the monarch&#x27;s physical remains remained hidden in the coffin. After the coronation of the new king, these effigies were stored away. The museum of Westminster Abbey has a collection of English royal wax effigies reaching back to Edward III of England, who died in 1377. In the 18th century also other important personalities were honoured with a funeral effigy, for instance British prime minister Pitt the Elder, the naval hero Horatio Nelson, French emperor Napoleon, and Frances Stewart, Duchess of Richmond, who also had her parrot stuffed and displayed at her own request and expense.

From the time of the funeral of Charles II in 1685, effigies were no longer placed on the coffin but were still made for later display. The effigy of Charles II was displayed over his tomb until the early 19th century, when all effigies were removed from the abbey. Nelson&#x27;s effigy was a tourist attraction, commissioned the year after his death and his burial in St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral in 1805. The government had decided that major public figures with State funerals should in future be buried at St Paul&#x27;s. Concerned for their revenue from visitors, the Abbey decided it needed a rival attraction for admirers of Nelson.

==Tomb effigies==

A tomb effigy, in French is the usually life-size sculpted figure depicting the deceased on a tomb monument. Although these funeary and commemorative reliefs were first developed in Ancient Egyptian and Etruscan cultures, they appear most numerously in Western Europe tombs from the later 11th century, in a style that continued in use through the Renaissance and early modern period, and are still sometimes used. They typically represent the deceased in a state of &quot;eternal repose&quot;, with hands folded in prayer, lying on a pillow, awaiting resurrection with a dog or lion at their feet. A husband and wife may be depicted lying side by side.

A related type of tomb effigy, the cadaver monument, shows the corpse in a state of decomposition as a reminder of human mortality.

==Other types==

In the field of numismatics, effigy describes the portrait on the obverse of a coin. A practice evident in reference literature of the 19th century, the obverse of a coin was said to depict &quot;the ruler&#x27;s effigy&quot;. The appearance and style of effigy used varies according to the preference of the monarch or ruler being depicted - for example, some, such as George VI of the United Kingdom have preferred to be shown uncrowned, while others have favoured highly-formal representations. It can also be the case that the monarch&#x27;s reign becomes long enough to merit issuing a succession of effigies so that their appearance continues to be current. Such has been the case for Queen Victoria (three effigies over 63 years) and Elizabeth II, who was depicted by five different effigies on British coins and three different effigies on British postage stamps between her ascension to the throne in 1953 and her death in 2022.

Effigy mound is a term used in the archaeology of (mainly) Pre-Columbian America for a large earthwork in the shape of a stylized animal, symbol, human, or other figure and generally containing one or more human burials.

Effigy vessel is a term used in the archeology of (mainly) Pre-Columbian America for ceramic or stone containers, pots, vases, cups, etc., in the shape of an animal or human.

In the past, criminals sentenced to death &quot;in absentia&quot; might be officially executed &quot;in effigy&quot; as a symbolic act. In southern India, effigies of the demon-king Ravana from the epic poem the Ramayana are traditionally burnt during the festival of Navrati.

A wicker man was a large human-shaped wicker statue allegedly used in Celtic paganism for human sacrifice by burning it, when loaded with captives.

<doc id="773391" wikidata="Q2432766" url="?curid=773391" title="Florida State Road 408">
<text>State Road 408 (SR 408), officially named the Spessard L. Holland East–West Expressway, is a controlled-access toll road running east–west through Orlando, Florida, United States. It is owned and operated by the Central Florida Expressway Authority (CFX), except for the westernmost mile (1.5 km), which is owned by Florida&#x27;s Turnpike Enterprise as a connection to Florida&#x27;s Turnpike. The road runs from the Turnpike in Gotha, east through downtown Orlando, where it intersects with I-4, ending near SR 50 south of the University of Central Florida. The road is named for Spessard L. Holland.

A short connection to SR 417, originally part of SR 408, was a spur of SR 408, and is sometimes labeled State Road 4080. The spur has been removed and the interchange with SR 417 has been revamped. The right-of-way where SR 408 once ended at SR 50 west of SR 435 (Kirkman Road) was once called State Road 4081. This spur is now a drainage basin.

== Route description ==

SR 408 begins at Florida&#x27;s Turnpike, heading east towards West Colonial Drive (SR 50) near Ocoee. After the interchange with Good Homes Road (exit 3), the tollway passes through the Hiawassee barrier toll, the first of four mainline toll barriers. From there, SR 408 serpentines eastward through the neighborhoods of Orlo Vista and Pine Hills making major junctions with State Road 435 (Kirkman Road), passing through the Pine Hills barrier toll east of Pine Hills Road, State Road 423 (John Young Parkway), and U.S. Route 441 (Orange Blossom Trail), with Camping World Stadium (formerly the Citrus Bowl) being accessible from the Orange Blossom Trail exit. Motorists heading east enter the Orlando city limits at mile marker 8, where they are greeted with a view of the high-rise skyline of Central Orlando. The East–West Expressway passes through a major stack interchange with Interstate 4 in Downtown and proceeds eastward to the Conway Toll Plaza, followed by major junctions with State Road 436 (Semoran Boulevard), and State Road 417 (Central Florida Greeneway). The route continues through the Dean Road Toll Plaza and the exits to State Road 434 (Alafaya Trail) and State Road 50 (East Colonial Drive). The tollway&#x27;s eastern terminus is Challenger Parkway, however Challenger Parkway continues until Alafaya Trail.

SR 408 runs almost entirely parallel to State Road 50 throughout its entire route.

== Tolls ==
There are four mainline toll plazas on the tollway. Each of them have at least two express lanes dedicated to E-Pass/SunPass for electronic toll collection which do not require motorists to stop at a booth and lanes dedicated to cash collection. Excepting the Mills off ramp, which has only two lanes for exact change, the ramp toll plazas have both a lane dedicated to ETC and a lane dedicated to exact change only with no change provided.

The current toll rates took effect in July 2012.

== History ==

=== Initial segment ===
The Orlando-Orange County Expressway Authority had been formed in 1963 for the purpose of building the Bee Line Expressway. In early 1966, while that road was still under construction, Governor Haydon Burns asked the OOCEA to look into an east–west freeway across downtown Orlando to relieve traffic on State Road 50 (Colonial Drive). An engineering study recommended a western terminus at SR 50 west of State Road 435 (Kirkman Road) and an eastern terminus at SR 50 east of Goldenrod Road (State Road 15A). One alternate ran close to SR 50, while the other – which was chosen by June 1969 – ran further south. Bonds were sold in May 1971. In December of that year, the OOCEA voted to name it the Spessard Lindsay Holland East–West Expressway, in honor of Spessard Holland, who had just retired from representing Florida in the U.S. Senate. Groundbreaking was held just east of Semoran Boulevard on February 5, 1972.

The final design took SR 408 across Interstate 4 just south of Anderson Street. The interchange – a double trumpet – connected to I-4 south of Gore Street, and resulted in the closure of four of the six ramps at Gore Street, which had intersected I-4 with a six-ramp partial cloverleaf. (The loops were in the southwest and southeast quadrants.) To the east, SR 408 crossed Lake Underhill. East of Goldenrod Road, the decision was made in 1970 to temporarily include three at-grade intersections at Chickasaw Trail, Valencia College Lane and Millinocket Lane.
The west half, from SR 50 to Mills Avenue, opened October 26, 1973. The rest was completed by December 11. The two barrier toll plazas – Holland West and Holland East – each charged 20 cents, while the ramp tolls – present at Orange Blossom Trail, Mills Avenue, Bumby Avenue, Conway Road and Semoran Boulevard, charged 10 cents. The Florida Department of Transportation took over operation and maintenance, giving revenues to the OOCEA. The final cost of the 13.3-mile (21.4 km) road was about $89 million.

Most tolls were doubled on January 1, 1987.

=== Eastern extension ===

Prior to the start of construction on the eastern extension, the Northeastern Beltway (State Road 417) was built north from the existing east end of the East–West Expressway at Colonial Drive. As part of this project, in 1987 and 1988, two ramps were added to the Goldenrod Road interchange to make it full, and the three at-grade intersections were removed – Chickasaw Trail became an overpass, Valencia College Lane became an interchange, and Millinockett Lane was simply cut. Ramp tolls were added at Valencia College Lane and SR 50, adding to the cost of traveling the original East–West once tolling on the new road began January 1, 1989.

By 1984, the alignment of the eastern extension of SR 408 had been chosen. The area was planned to be developed, and the OOCEA hoped to build the road before development made that impossible. Construction began in 1987, and the west piece, from existing SR 408 (redesignated SR 4080) to Rouse Road, opened May 12, 1989. The rest of the six-mile (10 km) road opened in June, with a total cost of $105 million. This project included a full interchange with the planned Southeastern Beltway (opened April 14, 1990), the Dean Road barrier toll, as well as a connection at the east end to the Central Florida Research Park. A wide median was left where the road curves north to end at SR 50 for further extension, but the land to the east has since been developed.

=== Western extension ===
A connection to Florida&#x27;s Turnpike and the planned Western Beltway was studied in 1985. (The Beltway, which would have run where Clarke Road now is, was soon shifted west.) Construction on the 4.5-mile (7 km) extension began in mid-1989 and was completed on October 8, 1990, costing $102 million total. The former west end at SR 50 west of Kirkman Road was temporarily designated SR 4081 during construction, and became a retention pond. A fourth barrier toll – the Hiawassee Road plaza – was added to the road. The extension was designed to have a full interchange with the Turnpike, but originally only the north-pointing ramps were built. The full interchange with the Turnpike was completed in August 2006. A temporary ticket system booth was installed until the Turnpike switched to a coin system in 1991.

=== Later changes ===
Tolls were again raised July 1, 1990, to 75 cents at barrier tolls and 50 cents on ramps. After public backlash, an experiment began October 11, 1992, in which some of the changes were reverted. The Hiawassee Road and Dean Road barriers were dropped back to 50 cents, and ramp tolls at Hiawassee Road, Valencia College Lane, Dean Road and Rouse Road were cut to 25 cents. The OOCEA board voted on June 17, 1993, to make the changes permanent.

Due to confusion resulting from the four named toll roads in the Orlando area (East–West Expressway, Bee Line Expressway, Eastern Beltway and Seminole County Expressway), the OOCEA decided in 1992 to use the numbers that had already been designated by the Florida Department of Transportation (FDOT). The old orange symbol was replaced by the number 408 in the new toll road symbol, recently approved by FDOT. Signs were changed in 1993.

At some point in the late 1990s, the John Young Parkway (SR 423) interchange was completed; it had formerly only had ramps to and from the east.
All the mainline toll plazas were reconstructed with express E-Pass lanes in the latter half of the 2000s. On November 10, 2006, the new Pine Hills Main Toll Plaza opened west as a replacement of the now demolished Holland West Toll Plaza. The new toll plaza features three express E-Pass lanes in both directions with open road tolling.

At the western end of the expressway a new set of ramps to Florida&#x27;s Turnpike opened in August 2006. Previously it was only possible for westbound traffic to go northbound on the Turnpike. A new ramp allows traffic to also go southbound on the Turnpike. Likewise, previously only southbound Turnpike traffic could exit onto eastbound TOLL 408. A new ramp on the northbound Turnpike allows traffic to enter eastbound TOLL 408. New west facing ramps opened in March 2007 at Good Homes Road, joining pre-existing east facing ramps.

Starting in September 2003, a $600 million widening project occurred in the central and western part of the road. As part of the project, two through lanes were added along the entire length of the expressway from Hiawassee Road in the west to Oxalis Road (just east of the SR 436 interchange) in the east. The section from downtown Orlando to Hiawassee Road was completed in Spring 2007. The entire project was completed in June 2010.

In the summer of 2010, the Expressway Authority began the widening of SR 408 from Oxalis Avenue to Goldenrod Road as well as the widening of the SR 408 Chickasaw Trail Bridge. This project was completed in March 2012. In addition, the interchange with SR 417 was expanded. This resulted in the elimination of SR 4080 and the interchange with Valencia College Lane. Traffic to Valencia College was redirected to Chickasaw Trail and Dean Road.

On October 13, 2016, Central Florida Expressway board members approved to rename a portion of SR 408 after professional golfer Arnold Palmer. State Representative Mike Miller and State Senator David H. Simmons sponsored legislation for renaming the road, which was signed into law by Governor Rick Scott on June 14, 2017. The section of SR 408 between Kirkman Road and Clarke Road was renamed the Arnold Palmer Expressway on July 1, 2017.

A stack interchange with Interstate 4 near downtown Orlando replaced the original double-trumpet interchange in recent years. The first construction phase began in April 2006 and was completed in November 2008. Due to a lack of funds, the rest of the interchange project was ultimately postponed until the I-4 Ultimate project. Following the first phase, the ramp that originally handled all traffic merging from I-4 only handled traffic from I-4 eastbound, which left abandoned lanes. A ramp stub was constructed in advance of the completion the conversion to stack interchange on SR 408 westbound. The Florida Department of Transportation was responsible for this project. On May 19, 2020, Governor Ron DeSantis formally opened the reconstructed SR 408 ramps with I-4. This was completed as part of the acceleration of I-4 Ultimate improvement project as part of the lack of traffic in Florida due to stay-at-home orders that were implemented within the state of Florida during the COVID-19 pandemic.

== Future ==

=== Eastern Extensions ===

The OOCEA 2025 Master Plan (2000) suggested extending SR 408 further east toward the west end of SR 520. In the OOCEA 2030 Master Plan, this proposed extension was further extended to I-95 in Brevard County.

So far, the SR 408 Eastern Extension project has been put on hold. The alternative solution, dubbed the Colonial Parkway has been shelved by Florida&#x27;s Turnpike Enterprise (FTE) so as of now the extension is still sitting on hold

Talks of extending SR 408 south past SR 528, Nova Road, down to US 192, named the Northeast Connector Expressway Extension (NECEE), a CF&amp;M study done the Central Florida Expressway Authority. This further extension would take SR 408 from the Challenger Parkway Interchange with SR 50/East Colonial Drive over to the proposed terminus at SR 50 near the SR 50/SR 520 then down southward to US 192. But the Southward extensions won&#x27;t become a reality until after 2040 since these are part of a development plan dubbed the North Ranch Master Plan in Osceola County

=== Western Improvements ===

Florida&#x27;s Turnpike Enterprise is currently planning to widen Florida&#x27;s Turnpike from 8 to 12 lanes from SR 408 in Gotha to SR 50/West Colonial Drive near Oakland and Clermont which includes interchange improvements at Florida&#x27;s Turnpike/SR 429(Daniel Webster Western Beltway) and SR 408 by constructing an 8 lane (4 lanes in both directions) Collector/Distributor System, connecting SR 408 with SR 429 without having to take Florida&#x27;s Turnpike mainline, which helps drastically decrease the congestion and weaving between the two expressways on the Turnpike.

== Exit list ==












== Challenger Parkway ==

=== Route description ===
Challenger Parkway (local/non-tolled) begins right after SR 408 ends at an interchange with SR 50. It then intersects with Woodbury Road then turns westward, intersecting with 2 streets with a traffic stop, Ingenuity Drive and Challenger Tech Court then ends at SR 434 (Alafaya Trail) in a traffic stop.

<text>The Church of the Intercession is an Episcopal congregation located at 550 West 155th Street, at Broadway, on the border of the Harlem and Washington Heights neighborhoods of Manhattan, New York City, on the grounds of Trinity Church Cemetery. The congregation was founded in 1846, and the current sanctuary, built in 1912–1915, was designed by Bertram Grosvenor Goodhue in the Gothic Revival style. From 1906–1976, it was a chapel of Trinity Church.

The Church of the Intercession and its Tudor Revival vicarage were designated New York City Landmarks in 1966, and the complex was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1980.

== History ==
The congregation which became the Church of the Intercession was founded in 1846 in Carmansville, a hamlet which would later be known as Audubon Park before becoming part of the Washington Heights neighborhood, by John James Audubon and John R. Morewood; it was incorporated in 1847. Services were initially held in Morewood&#x27;s home, with members who came from both Trinity Church on Broadway and Wall Street, and from the Church of the Ascension at Fifth Avenue and 10th Street.

In 1847, the congregation completed building their first sanctuary, a Victorian Gothic style wooden structure at West 154th Street and Tenth Avenue (now Amsterdam Avenue). The building&#x27;s outline can still be seen on what was the adjoining building. In 1871, the vestry decided to move the parish and sell the building.

The congregation&#x27;s next church was a stone building designed by Rembrandt Lockwood and located at 158th Street and Grand Boulevard, which is now Broadway. However, dissension within the congregation suppressed financial support for the parish, which became insolvent; the church was attached by the sheriff, and services proceeded only on the sufferance of the authorities.

Eventually, the congregation was able to recover the church, but by 1906 it was overcrowded, and the parish was still in debt. To alleviate these problems, a deal was struck with Trinity Church, which had intended to build a chapel on the grounds of its cemetery, to disestablish the Church of the Intercession as an independent parish, to become a Trinity Chapel, the Chapel of the Intercession. The cornerstone of a new sanctuary was laid in 1912, and the building was consecrated in 1915. The architect, Bertram Grosvenor Goodhue of Cram, Goodhue &amp; Ferguson, was a master of the Gothic Revival style, and the resulting church is considered to be his masterpiece. Goodhue incorporated elements from other styles into the building, such as the narrow and tall entrances which evoke the English Perpendicular style, while the Decorated Period can be seen in the tracery of the pointed windows, and the tower suggests the Tudor style. The church was built by Edward A. Wehr of Pittsburgh, who considered this his finest piece of work.

The congregation again became an independent parish in 1976.

==Notable facts==
* David Hurd composed the &quot;Intercession Mass&quot; during his tenure as church organist. This mass setting is used in many Episcopal congregations.
* The church is known for its annual Clement Clarke Moore Festival, the oldest continuing Christmas tradition in New York. It takes place on the Sunday before Christmas at 4pm. In 2010 celebrated the one-hundredth anniversary of the tradition. At the center of the service is the reading of Moore&#x27;s narrative poem &quot;A Visit from Saint Nicholas&quot;.
* Moore, among others of the New York social elite of the time, are buried in the adjoining Trinity Church Cemetery. Also in the cemetery is an imposing monument to John James Audubon. John Jacob Astor is also buried here, as is Alfred Tennyson Dickens, the son of Charles Dickens. A monument to the architect, Bertram Grosvenor Goodhue, sculpted by his friend Lee Lawrie in 1929, contains his tomb.

==In popular culture==
* The basement of the church was used in the 2012 TV series &quot;666 Park Avenue&quot; as The Drake&#x27;s &quot;secret room.&quot;

* In the season 1, episode 4 New Amsterdam episode of AMC drama &quot;Mad Men&quot;, Trudy Campbell divulges to a member of the co-op board that Pete&#x27;s great-great grandfather Nicholas Dyckman is buried at Church of the Intercession.
* In the 2021 Steven Spielberg film &quot;West Side Story&quot;, Maria (Rachel Zegler) and Tony (Ansel Elgort) sing &quot;One Hand, One Heart&quot; in a scene filmed at Church of the Intercession, although the implied location is The Cloisters.
