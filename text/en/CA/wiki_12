<text>Edmund John (27 November 1883 – 28 February 1917) was a British poet of the Uranian poetry school. His verses were modeled on the Symbolist poetry of Algernon Charles Swinburne and other earlier poets. Much of his work was condemned by critics for being overly decadent and unfashionable. He fought in the First World War but was invalided out in 1916. He died a year later in Taormina, Sicily.

<text>Hegemone , also known as &#x27;, is a natural satellite of Jupiter. It was discovered by a team of astronomers from the University of Hawaii led by Scott S. Sheppard in 2003, and given the temporary designation &#x27;.

Hegemone is about 3 kilometres in diameter, and orbits Jupiter at an average distance of 23,703,000 km in 745.500 days, at an inclination of 153° to the ecliptic (151° to Jupiter&#x27;s equator), in a retrograde direction and with an eccentricity of 0.4077.

It was named in March 2005 after Hegemone, one of the Graces, and a daughter of Zeus (Jupiter).

Hegemone belongs to the Pasiphae group, irregular retrograde moons orbiting Jupiter at distances ranging between 22.8 and 24.1 Gm, and with inclinations ranging between 144.5° and 158.3°.

<text>Lenka Kotková (&quot;née&quot; Šarounová; born 26 July 1973) is a Czech astronomer and a discoverer of minor planets.

She works at Observatoř Ondřejov (Ondřejov Observatory), located near Prague. Besides numerous main-belt asteroids she also discovered Mars-crosser asteroid 9671 Hemera and Hilda family asteroid 21804 Václavneumann.

Lenka Kotková studied meteorology at the faculty of Mathematics and Physics of the Charles University in Prague. Her tasks at the Astronomical institute AV ČR in Ondřejov are primarily the development of databases, spectroscopical and photometric observation, and data processing. During her work at the department of inter planetary matter her main role was the observation of near-earth asteroids, along with Petr Pravec and Peter Kušnirák she identified a large proportion of known binary asteroids. In the same time period she discovered or co-discovered over one hundred asteroids. At the present time Lenka Kotková works in the stellar department as an observant with a two-metre Ondřejov telescope.

In the year 2000 she received the &quot;Zdeněk Kvíz Award&quot; of the &quot;Czech Astronomical Society&quot; for significant work in the research of variable stars.

The asteroid 10390 Lenka, discovered by her colleagues Petr Pravec and Marek Wolf in 1997, is named after her. The asteroid 60001 Adélka, discovered by her in 1999, is named after her daughter, while 7897 Bohuška, discovered by her in 1995, is named after her mother.

<text>[[Baron]] Arthur Grumiaux (; 21 March 1921 – 16 October 1986) was a Belgian violinist, considered by some to have been &quot;one of the few truly great violin virtuosi of the twentieth century&quot;. He has been noted for having a &quot;consistently beautiful tone and flawless intonation&quot;. English music critic and broadcaster, Edward Greenfield wrote of him that he was &quot;a master virtuoso who consistently refused to make a show of his technical prowess&quot;.

==Early life==
Born to a working-class family in the Belgian town of Villers-Perwin, on 21 March 1921, Grumiaux was only three years old when his grandfather urged him to begin music studies. He entered the conservatoire in Charleroi at the age of six; the normal entry age was eleven. He studied violin and piano there until the age of eleven, when he graduated and moved to the Royal Conservatoire in Brussels to study violin.

==Career==

He variously has been described as having made his debut in Brussels at the age of 14, or in 1935, although his debut is more commonly said to have occurred in 1940. This performance was made in Belgium with the Brussels Philharmonic playing Mendelssohn&#x27;s Violin Concerto.

Due to the German invasion of his homeland, he next played publicly after liberation in 1945 with the Allied military entertainment organisation, making his London debut later that year. In 1949 he was appointed professor of violin at the Brussels Conservatoire where he had once studied. He debuted in the United States in Boston in 1951, and toured the United States in the following year.

In 1973 he was created a baron by King Baudouin of Belgium for his services to music.

==Death==
He died of a sudden stroke in Brussels (Belgium) in 1986 at the age of 65.

==Recordings==
Grumiaux had a long-standing relationship with Philips Records, lasting more than 20 years, and recordings are available from them of him performing works by Handel, Bach, Vivaldi, Michael Haydn, Mozart, Beethoven, Schubert, Mendelssohn, Bruch, Tchaikovsky, Saint-Saëns, Lalo, Henryk Wieniawski, and Johan Svendsen.

He was part of the Grumiaux Trio for many years, an ensemble consisting of Grumiaux, violist Georges Janzer and cellist Eva Czako. They recorded for Philips during the 1960s through to the mid-1970s, until Czako&#x27;s death in 1978. Their discography includes chamber music by Beethoven, Schubert, Brahms, Dvořák, Martinů and Mozart. In 1967 they recorded a highly-acclaimed interpretation of Mozart&#x27;s String Trio in E-flat major, K. 563 for Philips that is regarded by critics as one of the greatest chamber music recordings in history. In 1974 the Trio recorded Mozart&#x27;s string quintets, with the addition of violinist Arpad Gerécz and violist Max Lesueur, for Philips, which were included in the 1991 &quot;Complete Mozart Edition.&quot;

A recording of Grumiaux&#x27;s performance of one movement from Bach&#x27;s Sonatas and Partitas for Solo Violin, the &quot;Gavotte en rondeaux&quot; from the Partita No. 3, is included on the Voyager Golden Record, attached to the Voyager spacecraft, as a sample of the culture of Earth. This recording was chosen by renowned scientist Carl Sagan.

His 1969 recording of Alban Berg&#x27;s Violin Concerto with the Concertgebouw Orchestra under Igor Markevitch was nominated for the Grammy Award for Best Classical Performance – Instrumental Soloist or Soloists (with or without orchestra) at the 11th Ceremony.

==His violins==
He owned a Guarneri, the &quot;Rose&quot;, made by Giuseppe Guarneri in 1744, and played (but did not own) a Stradivarius, the &quot;General Dupont&quot;, made in 1727. He also owned the &quot;Museum&quot;, made by Giuseppe Guarneri in 1739, and the &quot;Campoli&quot;, made by Giovanni Guadagnini in 1773.

==Violin Competition==

The Arthur Grumiaux International Violin Competition is held annually and takes place at the Royal Conservatory of Brussels in Belgium. It was first held in 2008 under the name of &quot;Bravo&quot;, In 2015, the competition was renamed in honour of Arthur Grumiaux, and is now called &quot;Concours International Arthur Grumiaux pour Jeunes Violonistes&quot; (International Arthur Grumiaux Competition for Young Violinists).

<text>Peter Kušnirák (born 1974) is a Slovak astronomer, discoverer of minor planets, and a prolific photometrist of light-curves at Ondřejov Observatory in the Czech Republic. He was married to Slovak astronomer Ulrika Babiaková with whom he discovered 123647 Tomáško, named after their son Tomáško.

He was the principal observer to discover that the two main-belt asteroids 3073 Kursk and 5481 Kiuchi are in fact binary asteroids. In 1999, he discovered the Eunomian main-belt asteroid 24260 Kriváň, which he named after one Slovakia&#x27;s national symbols, as well as 21656 Knuth and 20256 Adolfneckař, both located in the Aquarius constellation at the time. He is based out of numerous observatories in the Czech Republic, including the Ondřejov Observatory, and works solo or with partners.

The Flora asteroid 17260 Kušnirák, discovered by the U.S. LINEAR project at Lincoln Lab&#x27;s ETS in 2000, is named in his honor ().

<doc id="760342" wikidata="Q971176" url="?curid=760342" title="French Constitution of 1791">
<text>The French Constitution of 1791 () was the first written constitution in France, created after the collapse of the absolute monarchy of the . One of the basic precepts of the French Revolution was adopting constitutionality and establishing popular sovereignty.

==Drafting process==

===Early efforts===
Following the Tennis Court Oath, the National Assembly began the process of drafting a constitution as its primary objective. The Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen, adopted on 26 August 1789 eventually became the preamble of the constitution adopted on 3 September 1791. The Declaration offered sweeping generalizations about rights, liberty, and sovereignty.

A twelve-member Constitutional Committee was convened on 14 July 1789 (coincidentally the day of the Storming of the Bastille). Its task was to do much of the drafting of the articles of the constitution. It included originally two members from the First Estate (Champion de Cicé, Archbishop of Bordeaux and Talleyrand, Bishop of Autun); two from the Second (the comte de Clermont-Tonnerre and the marquis de Lally-Tollendal); and four from the Third (Jean Joseph Mounier, Abbé Sieyès, Nicholas Bergasse, and Isaac René Guy le Chapelier).

Many proposals for redefining the French state were floated, particularly in the days after the remarkable sessions of 4–5 August 1789 and the abolition of feudalism. For instance, the Marquis de Lafayette proposed a combination of the American and British systems, introducing a bicameral parliament, with the king having the suspensive veto power over the legislature, modeled to the authority then recently vested in the President of the United States.

The main controversies early on surrounded the issues of what level of power to be granted to the king of France (i.e.: veto, suspensive or absolute) and what form would the legislature take (i.e.: unicameral or bicameral). The Constitutional Committee proposed a bicameral legislature, but the motion was defeated 10 September 1789 (849–89) in favor of one house; the next day, they proposed an absolute veto, but were again defeated (673–325) in favor of a suspensive veto, which could be over-ridden by three consecutive legislatures.

=== New Constitutional Committee ===
A second Constitutional Committee quickly replaced it, and included Talleyrand, Abbé Sieyès, and Le Chapelier from the original group, as well as new members Gui-Jean-Baptiste Target, Jacques Guillaume Thouret, Jean-Nicolas Démeunier, François Denis Tronchet, and Jean-Paul Rabaut Saint-Étienne, all of the Third Estate. As Simon Schama has pointed out, many of the members of the Constitutional Committee were themselves members of nobility, many of whom would later face execution.

Their greatest controversy faced by this new committee surrounded the issue of citizenship. Would every subject of the French Crown be given equal rights, as the Declaration of Rights of Man and Citizen seemed to promise, or would there be some restrictions? The October Days (5–6 October) intervened and rendered the question much more complicated. In the end, a distinction was held between active citizens (over the age of 25, paid direct taxes equal to three days&#x27; labor) which had political rights, and passive citizens, who had only civil rights. This conclusion was intolerable to such radical deputies as Maximilien Robespierre, and thereafter they never could be reconciled to the Constitution of 1791.

===Committee of Revisions===

A second body, the Committee of Revisions, was struck September 1790, and included Antoine Barnave, Adrien Duport, and Charles de Lameth. Because the National Assembly was both a legislature and a constitutional convention, it was not always clear when its decrees were constitutional articles or mere statutes. It was the job of this committee to sort it out. The committee became very important in the days after the Champs de Mars Massacre, when a wave of revulsion against popular movements swept France and resulted in a renewed effort to preserve powers for the Crown. The result is the rise of the Feuillants, a new political faction led by Barnave, who used his position on the committee to preserve a number of powers for the Crown, such as the nomination of ambassadors, military leaders, and ministers.

==Results==

After very long negotiations, the constitution was reluctantly accepted by King Louis XVI in September 1791.
Redefining the organization of the French government, citizenship and the limits to the powers of government, the National Assembly set out to represent the interests of the general will. It abolished many “institutions which were injurious to liberty and equality of rights”. The National Assembly asserted its legal presence in French government by establishing its permanence in the Constitution and forming a system for recurring elections. The Assembly&#x27;s belief in a sovereign nation and in equal representation can be seen in the constitutional separation of powers. The National Assembly was the legislative body, the king and royal ministers made up the executive branch and the judiciary was independent of the other two branches. On a local level, the previous feudal geographic divisions were formally abolished, and the territory of the French state was divided into several administrative units, Departments (&quot;Départements&quot;), but with the principle of centralism.

==Evaluation==

The Assembly, as constitution-framers, were afraid that if only representatives governed France, it was likely to be ruled by the representatives&#x27; self-interest; therefore, the king was allowed a suspensive veto to balance out the interests of the people. By the same token, representative democracy weakened the king’s executive authority.

The constitution was not egalitarian by today&#x27;s standards. It distinguished between the propertied &quot;active&quot; citizens and the poorer &quot;passive&quot; citizens. Women lacked rights to liberties such as education, freedom to speak, write, print and worship.

Keith M. Baker writes in his essay “Constitution” that the National Assembly threaded between two options when drafting the Constitution: they could modify the existing, unwritten constitution centered on the three estates of the Estates General or they could start over and rewrite it completely. The National Assembly wanted to reorganize social structure and legalize itself: while born of the Estates General of 1789, it had abolished the tricameral structure of that body.

With the onset of war and the threat of the revolution&#x27;s collapse, radical Jacobin and ultimately republican conceptions grew enormously in popularity, increasing the influence of Robespierre, Danton, Marat and the Paris Commune. When the King used his veto powers to protect non-juring priests and refused to raise militias in defense of the revolutionary government, the constitutional monarchy proved unworkable and was effectively ended by the 10 August insurrection. A National Convention was called, electing Robespierre as its first deputy; it was the first assembly in France elected by universal male suffrage. The convention declared France a republic on 22 September 1792.

 is about in diameter, and orbits Jupiter at an average distance of 21,600 Mm in 647 days, at an inclination of 155° to the ecliptic, in a retrograde direction and with an eccentricity of 0.366. It was initially thought to the innermost of the retrograde satellites of Jupiter, but recovery observations have shown that it is an ordinary member of the Ananke group.

This moon was considered lost until late 2020, when it was recovered in archival CFHT images from 2001-2011 by amateur astronomer Kai Ly. The recovery of the moon was announced by the Minor Planet Center on 13 January 2021.

<text>Cyllene , also known as &#x27;, is a natural satellite of Jupiter. It was discovered by a team of astronomers from the University of Hawaii led by Scott S. Sheppard in 2003, receiving the temporary designation &#x27;.

Cyllene is about 2 kilometres in diameter, and orbits Jupiter at an average distance of (23.4 million km) 23,396,000 km in 731.099 days (2.00 earth years), at an inclination of 140.149° to the ecliptic (139.543° to Jupiter&#x27;s equator), in a retrograde direction and with an eccentricity of 0.4116.

It was named in March 2005 after Cyllene, a naiad (stream nymph) or oread (mountain nymph) associated with Mount Cyllene, Greece. She was a daughter of Zeus (Jupiter).

It belongs to the Pasiphae group, irregular retrograde moons orbiting Jupiter at distances ranging between 22.8 and 24.1 Gm, and with inclinations ranging between 144.5° and 158.3°.

<text>Frank B. Zoltowski (born 1957) is an Australian amateur astronomer and prolific discoverer of minor planets who lives in Woomera, South Australia. In 1998, he was awarded a &quot;Gene Shoemaker NEO Grant&quot; for improved near-Earth object searches.

Zoltowski conducts these searches from his home with a charge-coupled device camera. He is a prolific discoverer of asteroids. He authored CCDTRACK, a computer program that auto-guides electronically controlled telescopes by tracking a user-selected celestial object.

He is mentioned in NASA&#x27;s asteroid tracking database as an observer for asteroid . Astronomers at the Minor Planet Center used Zoltowski&#x27;s work to work out an estimated approach distance for of 56,500 kilometers, and a closest approach date of Aug 7, 2027. It was thought to potentially crash into Earth.

The main-belt asteroid 18292 Zoltowski, discovered at the George R. Agassiz Station of the Harvard College Observatory in 1977, was named in his honor. The naming citation was published on 9 May 2001 ().

<text>Philophrosyne ( or ), also Jupiter LVIII and provisionally known as , is a natural satellite of Jupiter. It was discovered by a team of astronomers from the University of Hawaii led by Scott S. Sheppard, &quot;et al.&quot; in 2003,
but then lost. It was recovered in 2017 and given its permanent designation that year.

==Characteristics==
Philophrosyne is about 2 kilometres in diameter, and orbits Jupiter at an average distance of 22,721,000 km in 699.676 days, at an inclination of 142° to the ecliptic (142° to Jupiter&#x27;s equator), in a retrograde direction and with an eccentricity of 0.0932.

It belongs to the Pasiphae group, retrograde irregular moons that orbit Jupiter between 22.8 and 24.1 Gm, at inclinations of roughly 150-155°.

==Name==
The moon was named in 2019 after Philophrosyne (Φιλοφροσύνη), the ancient Greek spirit of welcome, friendliness, and kindness, the daughter of Hephaestus and Aglaea and granddaughter of Zeus. The name originated from a naming contest held on Twitter where it is suggested by users including CHW3M Myth Experts (@Chw3mmyths) which is an 11th-grade history class studying Greek and Roman philosophy as of 2019, Victoria (@CharmedScribe), and Lunartic (@iamalunartic) who has concurrently helped in naming another Jovian moon Eupheme.

<doc id="760359" wikidata="Q710381" url="?curid=760359" title="Robert H. McNaught">
<text>Robert H. McNaught (born in Scotland in 1956) is a Scottish-Australian astronomer at the Research School of Astronomy and Astrophysics of the Australian National University (ANU). He has collaborated with David J. Asher of the Armagh Observatory.

The inner main-belt asteroid 3173 McNaught, discovered by Edward Bowell at Anderson Mesa Station in 1981, was named after him by its discoverer, following a suggestion by David Seargent.

== Work ==

McNaught is a prolific discoverer of asteroids and comets, described as &quot;the world&#x27;s greatest comet discoverer&quot; and he participated in the Siding Spring Survey (SSS) using the ANU&#x27;s Uppsala Southern Schmidt Telescope. He discovered the Great Comet C/2006 P1 on 7 August 2006, the brightest comet in several decades, which became easily visible to the naked eye for observers in the Southern Hemisphere. The SSS was the only active professional Near Earth Object survey in the Southern Hemisphere. The survey ended in 2013 after funding dried up.

McNaught previously worked on the Anglo-Australian Near-Earth Asteroid Survey from 1990 to 1996.

== Other work ==

McNaught worked at the University of Aston&#x27;s satellite-tracking camera originally outside Evesham in 1982, thereafter at Herstmonceux and more recently at Siding Spring. In his spare time he successfully conducts patrols for novae,
identifies images of prenovae and unusual variable stars on survey plates, measures their positions, makes astrometric observations of comets and minor planets and photometric observations of comets and novae. He also carries out extensive observational and computational work on meteors, as well as on occultations by minor planets.

== Funding issues ==
In October 2011, partly due to changes in the exchange rate between the Australian and US dollars, Catalina Sky Survey of NASA had to end funding McNaught&#x27;s southern survey, which used to cost $110,000 per year, ending the international cooperation in July 2012. The astronomer estimated that the survey needs $180,000 annually, plus a small one-time sum to fix the observatory dome. For several months the project was temporarily funded from the ANU, but in late 2012, the ANU advised that it could no longer support the program and that funds would not be available from January 2013.

<text> is a natural satellite of Jupiter. It was discovered by a team of astronomers led by Brett J. Gladman in 2003.

 is about 2 kilometres in diameter, and orbits Jupiter at an average distance of in 600 days, at an inclination of 151° to the ecliptic (149° to Jupiter&#x27;s equator), in a retrograde direction and with an eccentricity of 0.333. It belongs to the Ananke group of retrograde irregular moons which orbit Jupiter between 19.3 and 22.7 Gm, at inclinations of roughly 150°.

This moon was once considered lost until September 2010, when it was recovered by Christian Veillet with Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope (CFHT). However, the recovery observations of S/2003 J 16 were not reported by the Minor Planet Center until 2020, when Ashton et al. independently identified the moon in the same CFHT images taken by Veillet back in September 2010. S/2003 J 16 was also identified in observations by Scott Sheppard from March 2017 to May 2018, cumulating a long observation arc of 5,574 days (15 years) since its discovery. The recovery of S/2003 J 16 was formally announced by the Minor Planet Center on 4 November 2020.

<text>Herse , or Jupiter L, previously known by its provisional designation of , is a natural satellite of Jupiter. It was discovered on 8 February 2003 by the astronomers Brett J. Gladman, John J. Kavelaars, Jean-Marc Petit, and Lynne Allen and also by a team of astronomers at the University of Hawaii. It was named after Herse &#x27;dew&#x27;, by some accounts a daughter of Zeus and Selene the moon in Greek mythology, on 11 November 2009. Ersa (Jupiter LXXI) is also named for the same mythological figure.

Herse is about 2 kilometres in diameter, and orbits Jupiter at an average distance of 22,134,000 km in 672.752 days, at a mean inclination of 165° to the ecliptic, in a retrograde direction and with a mean eccentricity of 0.2493.

It is a member of the Carme group, made up of irregular retrograde moons orbiting Jupiter at a distance ranging between 23 and 24 Gm and at an inclination of about 165°.

<doc id="760371" wikidata="Q16870" url="?curid=760371" title="Carpo (moon)">
<text>Carpo , also &#x27;, is a small outer natural satellite of Jupiter. It was discovered by a team of astronomers from the University of Hawaii led by Scott S. Sheppard in 2003, and was provisionally designated as &#x27; until it received its name in early 2005. It was named in March 2005 after Carpo, one of the Horae, and a daughter of Zeus (Jupiter).

Carpo has a diameter of about for an absolute magnitude of 16.2. Like all irregular moons of Jupiter, Carpo&#x27;s orbit is highly variable over time due to gravitational perturbations by the Sun and other planets. On average, Carpo&#x27;s orbit has a semi-major axis of , a high eccentricity of 0.42, and a very high inclination of 54° with respect to the ecliptic.

Carpo was long thought to be an outlier prograde satellite not part of any group, until S/2018 J 4 was found. The orbital inclination of satellites such as Carpo is limited by the Kozai effect, which induces a periodic exchange between the inclination and eccentricity of the orbit. If the inclination is large enough, the eccentricity can in turn grow so large that the periapsis of the satellite (called the &quot;perijove&quot; in the case of moons of Jupiter) would be in the immediate vicinity of the Galilean moons (Io, Europa, Ganymede and Callisto). The satellite would eventually collide with one of these, or a close encounter would eject it altogether from the Jovian system. Due to the Kozai effect, Carpo&#x27;s argument of periapsis never precesses and instead librates about 90° with respect to the ecliptic, which keeps Carpo&#x27;s perijove always above Jupiter and its apojove below (see orbit animation below).

<doc id="760372" wikidata="Q4998920" url="?curid=760372" title="Burke–Gilman Trail">
<text>The Burke–Gilman Trail is a rail trail in King County, Washington. The multi-use recreational trail is part of the King County Regional Trail System and occupies an abandoned Seattle, Lake Shore and Eastern Railway (SLS&amp;E) corridor.

A portion of the Burke–Gilman trail is managed by the City of Seattle. The trail begins at 11th Avenue NW in Ballard and follows along the Lake Washington Ship Canal and north along Lake Washington, designated as ending in Bothell.

==Route==

The trail is a substantial part of the of signed bike routes in Seattle and the of trails in the King County Trails System. A segment of the Burke–Gilman portion, opened in July 2005, runs for from NW 60th Street and Seaview Avenue NW to the Ballard Locks. The main trail resumes at 11th Avenue NW and NW 45th Street and runs to Blyth Park in Bothell. There, it becomes the Sammamish River Trail segment, which parallels the Sammamish River for to Redmond.

The Burke–Gilman trail runs along the Fremont Cut, Lake Union (an old freight depot remains visible at the foot of Stone Way), and through the University of Washington campus. After passing the University Village shopping center, the trail heads up through northeast neighborhoods, alongside the Hawthorne Hills, Laurelhurst and Windermere neighborhoods; through the Sand Point neighborhood, passing Magnuson Park, then alongside Lake Washington from just before the Matthews Beach and Cedar Park neighborhoods of the former Lake City, continuing on through Lake Forest Park and Kenmore to Bothell. The trail throughout is nearly level with few large intersection crossings — it is a former railroad right-of-way.

The trail runs between Ballard and Tracy Owen Station in Kenmore (its initial eastern end), or to Blyth Park. The Seattle Parks Department considers the Burke–Gilman segment of the trail to end in Kenmore; while King County considers that the segments divide in Bothell. The total distance from Golden Gardens Park to Bothell, including the proposed &quot;missing link&quot; through Ballard, is .

===Sammamish River Trail===
At Blyth Park in Bothell the trail becomes the Sammamish River Trail and continues for to Marymoor Park, Redmond, on Lake Sammamish. With the completion of a connector trail through Marymoor Park in May 2009 the trail network continues to the city of Issaquah via the East Lake Sammamish Trail for another . The trail is over the Seattle, Lake Shore and Eastern Railway (SLS&amp;E) line and in conjunction with Issaquah&#x27;s Rainier Trail, Preston Trail, and the Preston Snoqualmie Trail.

The Snoqualmie Falls-North Bend link of SLS&amp;E has become the line of the Northwest Railway Museum. The SLS&amp;E terminated just beyond North Bend in Sallal Prairie. Users of the extensions can continue on the regional trail network at the Snoqualmie Valley Trail in North Bend and connect with the Iron Horse State Park at Rattlesnake Lake.

With the addition of the connector, the longest unbroken segment of the trail currently extends 42 miles.

===Extensions===
, there are extensions of the Burke–Gilman Trail at its western end: connecting the short and long segments between the Ballard Locks and 11th Avenue, and a northern extension along Shilshole Bay from NW 60th Street to Golden Gardens Park, and planning for connecting between the Ballard Locks and downtown Ballard at 11th Avenue NW and NW 45th Street.

A major point of contention since the 1990s regarding the remaining &quot;missing link&quot; project was the industrial nature of the Salmon Bay waterfront, through which this portion of the trail would pass. Local business owners voiced concerns about the safety and liability issues inherent in the convergence of Ballard Terminal Railroad trains, trucks, cyclists, and pedestrians. A citizens groups, and the city, claimed the dangers were being exaggerated. The trail overall can at times be busy and even crowded.

, plans to construct the section remain on hold due to design revisions and legal challenges. A railroad crossing on the trail under the Ballard Bridge was the site of 39 crashes and incidents between 2015 and 2020. The crossing was replaced in October 2023, shortly after the city council approved its removal. The city council included a routing along Leary Way instead of Shilshole Avenue, where industrial businesses had opposed the trail&#x27;s construction, in a transportation levy that will be placed on the November 2024 ballot.

==History==
The trail can trace its origins to the founding of the Seattle, Lake Shore and Eastern Railway on April 15, 1885, by ten men headed by judge Thomas Burke and Daniel Gilman. In its heyday, Burke and Gilman&#x27;s road extended from Downtown Seattle north to Arlington and east to Rattlesnake Prairie above Snoqualmie Falls. Taken over by the Northern Pacific Railway around 1890, the line became part of the Burlington Northern Railroad in 1970, and was abandoned in 1971. In 1978, the first of the right-of-way, from Seattle&#x27;s Gas Works Park to Kenmore&#x27;s Tracy Owen Station, was opened as a public trail and named after the founders of the railroad.

A two-mile section of the trail within Lake Forest Park was temporarily closed for redevelopment from June 2011 to February 2012.

== Neighborhoods ==
The trail intersects the following:

<text>Mneme , also known as , is a retrograde irregular satellite of Jupiter. It was discovered by teams of astronomers led by Brett J. Gladman and Scott S. Sheppard in 2003, and was provisionally designated S/2003 J 21.
Mneme is about 2 kilometres in diameter, and orbits Jupiter at an average distance of 21,427,000 kilometres in 640.769 days, at an inclination of 149° to the ecliptic (148° to Jupiter&#x27;s equator) with an eccentricity of 0.2214. Its average orbital speed is 2.43 km/s.

It was named in March 2005 after Mneme, one of the three original Muses. She is sometimes confused with Mnemosyne, mother of the Muses (the three or the nine, depending on the author) by Zeus (Jupiter).

Mneme belongs to the Ananke group, retrograde irregular moons which orbit Jupiter between 19.3 and 22.7 million kilometres, at inclinations of roughly 150°.

<text>Paul Ching Wu Chu (; born December 2, 1941) is a Taiwanese-American physicist specializing in superconductivity, magnetism, and dielectrics. He is a professor of physics and T.L.L. Temple Chair of Science in the Physics Department at the University of Houston College of Natural Sciences and Mathematics. He was the president of the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology from 2001 to 2009. In 1987, he was one of the first scientists to demonstrate high-temperature superconductivity.

== Early life and education ==
Chu was born in Changsha, Hunan, Republic of China in 1941. Chu&#x27;s family was from Taishan, Guangdong. Chu spent his childhood in Taiwan. In 1958, Chu graduated from Taiwan Provincial Cingshuei high school.

In 1962, Chu earned his Bachelor of Science degree from National Cheng Kung University in Taiwan. In 1965, he earned his Master of Science degree from Fordham University. In 1968, he earned his Ph.D. degree from the University of California, San Diego.

== Career ==
After two years of performing industrial research with Bell Laboratories at Murray Hill, New Jersey, Chu was appointed assistant professor of physics at Cleveland State University in 1970. He was subsequently promoted to associate professor and professor of physics in 1973 and 1975, respectively.

In 1979, Chu became a professor of physics at the University of Houston, an appointment he still holds. In 1987, he and Maw-Kuen Wu announced the historic discovery of superconductivity above 77 K in YBCO, touching off a frenzy of scientific excitement exemplified by the Woodstock of physics, at which he was a featured presenter. He was then appointed the director of the Texas Center for Superconductivity. Chu has served as the T.L.L. Temple Chair of Science at the same university since 1987. He also has served as a consultant and visiting staff member at Bell Laboratories, Los Alamos Scientific Laboratory, the Marshall Space Flight Center, Argonne National Laboratory and DuPont at various times.

Chu has received numerous awards and honors for his outstanding work in superconductivity, including the National Medal of Science and the Comstock Prize in Physics in 1988, and the American Physical Society&#x27;s International Prize for New Materials. He was an invited contributor to the White House National Millennium Time Capsule at the National Archives in 2000 and was selected the Best Researcher in the U.S. by &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot; in 1990.

In 1989, Chu was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. He is a member of the National Academy of Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences (foreign member), Academia Sinica, Russian Academy of Engineering (RAE) and the Third World Academy of Sciences. His research activities extend beyond superconductivity to magnetism and dielectrics. 

On November 17, 2014, an IEEE Milestone in Electrical Engineering and Computing plaque was presented to University of Houston for Chu and his team&#x27;s 1987 discovery of high temperature superconductors.

On September 1, 2001, Chu succeeded Professor Chia-Wei Woo as the president of The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology. Chu&#x27;s tenure as university president ended officially on 1 September 2009.

On November 5, 2011, Chu was appointed as the founding President of the Taiwan Comprehensive University System (TCUS).

== Personal life ==

It belongs to the Pasiphae group, irregular retrograde moons orbiting Jupiter at distances ranging between 22.8 and 24.1 Gm, and with inclinations ranging between 144.5° and 158.3°.

This moon was considered lost until late 2020, when it was recovered by Sheppard and independently by amateur astronomer Kai Ly. The recovery of the moon was announced by the Minor Planet Center on 13 January 2021, while additional recovery observations by Sheppard were later published on 27 January 2021.

<text>Vincenzo Silvano Casulli, usually known as Silvano Casulli (25 August 1944 – 24 July 2018) was an Italian amateur astronomer and a discoverer of minor planets at his Vallemare di Borbona Observatory in Lazio.

He is credited by the Minor Planet Center with the discovery of 192 minor planets. In 1985 he served on a team involved in using the Hubble Space Telescope in a study that focused on Transition Comets—UV Search for OH Emissions in Asteroids. He was the first amateur astronomer to obtain precise astronometric positions of minor planets using a CCD camera. He is a prolific discoverer of asteroids.

In 1997, the inner main-belt asteroid and member of the Flora family, 7132 Casulli, was named by astronomer Antonio Vagnozzi in his honor ().

== Discoveries ==
=== 9121 Stefanovalentini ===

On 24 February 1998, he discovered 9121 Stefanovalentini at the Italian Colleverde Observatory. It is a carbonaceous asteroid from the outer regions of the main-belt, approximately 30 kilometers in diameter. Casulli also obtained a light-curve from photometric observations and determined a period of 11.84 hours for the body&#x27;s rotation. He named it in honour of amateur astronomer Stefano Valentini.

=== 93061 Barbagallo ===

Together with Italian astronomer Ermes Colombini and others, he co-discovered the asteroid 93061 Barbagallo on 23 September 2000. The group-discovery is credited to the discovering observatory, Osservatorio San Vittore, Bologna. The asteroid was named after Mariano Barbagallo, an Italian colleague and friend of Colombini.

<doc id="760392" wikidata="Q1014287" url="?curid=760392" title="Cadmium arsenide">
<text>Cadmium arsenide (Cd3As2) is an inorganic semimetal in the II-V family. It exhibits the Nernst effect.

== Properties ==

=== Thermal ===

Cd3As2 dissociates between 220 and 280 °C according to the reaction

:2 Cd3As2(s) → 6 Cd(g) + As4(g)

An energy barrier was found for the nonstoichiometric vaporization of arsenic due to the irregularity of the partial pressures with temperature. The range of the energy gap is from 0.5 to 0.6 eV. Cd3As2 melts at 716 °C and changes phase at 615 °C/

=== Phase transition ===

Pure cadmium arsenide undergoes several phase transitions at high temperatures, making phases labeled α (stable), α’, α” (metastable), and β. At 593° the polymorphic transition α → β occurs.

:α-Cd3As2 ↔ α’-Cd3As2 occurs at ~500 K.
:α’-Cd3As2 ↔ α’’-Cd3As2 occurs at ~742 K and is a regular first order phase transition with marked hysteresis loop.
:α”-Cd3As2 ↔ β-Cd3As2 occurs at 868 K.

Single crystal x-ray diffraction was used to determine the lattice parameters of Cd3As2 between 23 and 700 °C. Transition α → α′ occurs slowly and therefore is most likely an intermediate phase. Transition α′ → α″ occurs much faster than α → α′ and has very small thermal hysteresis. This transition results in a change in the fourfold axis of the tetragonal cell, causing crystal twinning. The width of the loop is independent of the rate of heating although it becomes narrower after several temperature cycles.

=== Electronic ===

The compound cadmium arsenide has a lower vapor pressure (0.8 atm) than both cadmium and arsenic separately. Cadmium arsenide does not decompose when it is vaporized and re-condensed. Carrier Concentration in Cd3As2 are usually (1–4)×1018 electrons/cm3. Despite having high carrier concentrations, the electron mobilities are also very high (up to 10,000 cm2/(V·s) at room temperature).

In 2014 Cd3As2 was shown to be a semimetal material analogous to graphene that exists in a 3D form that should be much easier to shape into electronic devices. Three-dimensional (3D) topological Dirac semimetals (TDSs) are bulk analogues of graphene that also exhibit non-trivial topology in its electronic structure that shares similarities with topological insulators. Moreover, a TDS can potentially be driven into other exotic phases (such as Weyl semimetals, axion insulators and topological superconductors), Angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy revealed a pair of 3D Dirac fermions in Cd3As2. Compared with other 3D TDSs, for example, β-cristobalite and , Cd3As2 is stable and has much higher Fermi velocities. In situ doping was used to tune its Fermi energy.

=== Conducting ===

Cadmium arsenide is a II-V semiconductor showing degenerate n-type semiconductor intrinsic conductivity with a large mobility, low effective mass and highly non parabolic conduction band, or a Narrow-gap semiconductor. It displays an inverted band structure, and the optical energy gap, eg, is less than 0. When deposited by thermal evaporation (deposition), cadmium arsenide displayed the Schottky (thermionic emission) and Poole–Frenkel effect at high electric fields.

=== Magnetoresistance ===

Cadmium Arsenide shows very strong quantum oscillations in resistance even at the relatively high temperature of 100K. This makes it useful for testing cryomagnetic systems as the presence of such a strong signal is a clear indicator of function.

== Preparation ==

Cadmium arsenide can be prepared as amorphous semiconductive glass. According to Hiscocks and Elliot, the preparation of cadmium arsenide was made from cadmium metal, which had a purity of 6 N from Kock-Light Laboratories Limited. Hoboken supplied β-arsenic with a purity of 99.999%. Stoichiometric proportions of the elements cadmium and arsenic were heated together. Separation was difficult and lengthy due to the ingots sticking to the silica and breaking. Liquid encapsulated Stockbarger growth was created. Crystals are pulled from volatile melts in liquid encapsulation. The melt is covered by a layer of inert liquid, usually B2O3, and an inert gas pressure greater than the equilibrium vapor pressure is applied. This eliminates the evaporation from the melt which allows seeding and pulling to occur through the B2O3 layer.

== Crystal structure ==

The unit cell of Cd3As2 is tetragonal. The arsenic ions are cubic close packed and the cadmium ions are tetrahedrally coordinated. The vacant tetrahedral sites provoked research by von Stackelberg and Paulus (1935), who determined the primary structure. Each arsenic ion is surrounded by cadmium ions at six of the eight corners of a distorted cube and the two vacant sites were at the diagonals.

The crystalline structure of cadmium arsenide is very similar to that of zinc phosphide (Zn3P2), zinc arsenide (Zn3As2) and cadmium phosphide (Cd3P2). These compounds of the Zn-Cd-P-As quaternary system exhibit full continuous solid-solution.

== Nernst effect ==

Cadmium arsenide is used in infrared detectors using the Nernst effect, and in thin-film dynamic pressure sensors. It can be also used to make magnetoresistors, and in photodetectors.

Cadmium arsenide can be used as a dopant for HgCdTe.

<text>Bruce Millan (5 October 1927 – 21 February 2013) was a British Labour politician who served as a European Commissioner from 1989 to 1995.

== Early life ==
Bruce Millan was born in Dundee, the son of a shipyard caulker and a jute weaver, and educated at Harris Academy in the city. He was active in the Labour League of Youth while at school, and after it he undertook his national service with the Royal Corps of Signals while studying at the same time for accountancy examinations. He became a chartered accountant in 1950.

Millan married Gwendoline May Fairey on 22 August 1953. The couple had a son and a daughter.

== Parliamentary career ==
Millan unsuccessfully contested West Renfrewshire in the 1951 general election and Glasgow Craigton in that of 1955.

He was elected as Member of Parliament (MP) for Glasgow Craigton at the 1959 general election and served for that seat, and after its abolition in 1983 for Glasgow Govan, until 1988. He served in the Wilson government of 1964–1970 as Under-Secretary of State for the Air Force from 1964 to 1966, as Under-Secretary of State for Scotland from 1966 to 1970, and in the Callaghan government of 1976–1979 as Secretary of State for Scotland; he subsequently served as Shadow Secretary of State for Scotland under new leader Michael Foot. At the time of the 1981 Labour Party Shadow Cabinet election, the first time Millan won election to the Shadow Cabinet, he was described by &quot;The Glasgow Herald&quot; as being identified with the &quot;Centre-to-right&quot; of the Labour Party.

== After Parliament ==
Millan left Parliament in 1988, by applying for the Chiltern Hundreds, in order to take up the post of European Commissioner for Regional Policy and Cohesion, which he held until 1995. The vacancy he left was filled by Jim Sillars of the SNP in the noteworthy Glasgow Govan by-election of 1988.

In 1991, Millan received an honorary doctorate from Heriot-Watt University.

Between 1999 and 2001 he chaired the Millan Committee, which proposed reforms to the provision of mental health care in Scotland.

<text>Loacker [[Società per azioni|S.p.A.]] (in German Loacker AG) is an Italian confectionery company, based in South Tyrol, Italy and specialized in the production of wafers, chocolate and derivative products.

==History==
The company was founded in 1925 in the historic city center of Bolzano by the Austrian confectioner Alfons Loacker. Back then, he opened a small store with two assistants in Piazza Domenicani. 
In 1974, Loacker moved away from the city, marking the transition from a small regional bakery to an industrial reality. Armin Loacker, Alfons&#x27; son, chose the Renon plateau in the heart of the Dolomites to produce his own wafers.

== Manufacturing ==
Loacker nowadays has two plants, one in Auna di Sotto on the Renon and a second one in Heinfels in East Tyrol (Austria). At both production sites wafers and chocolate specialties are produced at more than 1,000 meters above sea level. Today, the third generation leads the company: Armin&#x27;s sons Andreas and Martin Loacker together with his nephew Ulrich Zuenelli who works as executive chairman.

As of 2021, Loacker has 1,153 employees. 
In 2021, 1.03 billion single pieces were produced and 35,729 tons of products were sold which amounted to net sales of €435.45 million. Italy, the United States, and Saudi Arabia were the highest-consuming countries, followed by Israel and China.

In 2022, Loacker announced the initiation of a multi-year partnership with Sammontana for the production of a new range of Loacker-branded ice creams.

== Products and ingredients ==
The Napolitaner (Hazelnut) flavored ranges are amongst Loacker&#x27;s best-known products. The name &quot;Napolitaner&quot; derives from the hazelnuts which represent the main ingredient of the cream in the wafers and used to be sourced from plantations near Naples.

Nowadays, Loacker has initiated four sustainability pathways for both production and sourcing of raw materials, aiming to increase verticalization of its own supply chain.

In addition to the vanilla Bourbon pods from Madagascar and the cocoa beans cultivated in Ecuador and the Ivory Coast, Loacker uses milk powder from Dolomites Milk in Vandoies for its dairy creams. Dolomites Milk is a joint venture between Loacker and the South Tyrolean dairy cooperative BRIMI which comprises 1,100 local farmers. This 10,000 m2 facility is the first plant which is specialized in whey and milk powder in Italy.

Loacker covers part of its hazelnut supply needs through products coming from two company-owned farms located in Tuscany and orchards of 90 more farms which are part of a cultivation project with based on supply chain contracts in Veneto, Umbria, Tuscany and Marche.

Furthermore, Loacker distributes products branded by Lorenz, Pema, Twinings, Ovomaltine and Darbo in Italy.

== Loacker Café ==
Besides the production and sale of its own products to both small and large distributors, the group also comprises five Loacker Cafés, all of which are located in Tyrol.

These Cafés represent a mix between a store, where the entire Loacker product assortment is sold, and a confectionery, where people can enjoy freshly baked goods and high-quality coffee. The Cafés are located at historically and strategically important sites to the company, including Bolzano&#x27;s Piazza Walther in its historic city center, the Twenty shopping mall, the Outlet Center Brennero, Piazza Fiera in Trento and Heinfels, right next to Loacker&#x27;s production site in Eastern Tyrol.

<doc id="760411" wikidata="Q1512956" url="?curid=760411" title="Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 4">
<text>Tony Hawk&#x27;s Pro Skater 4 is a 2002 skateboarding game developed by Neversoft and published by Activision under their Activision O2 label. The game was ported by different developers to various systems. It is the fourth installment in the &quot;Tony Hawk&#x27;s&quot; series. The game was released in 2002 for the GameCube, PlayStation, PlayStation 2, Xbox, and Game Boy Advance. In 2003, it was released for Windows and Mac OS X by developer Beenox and publisher Aspyr. In 2004, a Tapwave Zodiac version was released.

==Gameplay==
&quot;Pro Skater 4&quot; is a departure from the previous three games&#x27; Career mode, in which the player had a set amount of time in order to find and complete goals. &quot;4&quot; instead features a Career mode more similar to Free Skate mode, in which there is no time limit to explore the level, the goals are usually offered to the player to attempt by characters found in the level. This Career mode would be later seen as the Story modes of the &quot;Underground&quot; series, &quot;American Wasteland&quot;, &quot;Project 8&quot; and &quot;Proving Ground&quot;.

The game builds on the success of the gameplay in the previous games in the series. All of the combos from the previous game make an appearance, as well as some new tricks that can be performed to better navigate parks and areas. New to the game is the spine transfer, in which the player can press the shoulder button to transfer between quarter-pipes connected back-to-back, or otherwise self-right themselves to exit quarter-pipes or prevent bailing should they fly off them. The game also features skitching, which lets skaters hang off the back of moving vehicles.

The &quot;hidden combos&quot; for turning some tricks into slight variations in &quot;Pro Skater 3&quot; turned into a standard feature, albeit not as advanced as the system would turn out in the next game in the series, where it was finalized. Also included was the ability to do grind and lip extensions by tapping a direction and grind while grinding or lipping, which can also grant the player bigger combos as they can do a grind extension into a special move, for example. As with trick extensions, this would be standard in the next game in the series where it was much simpler to do. The game is also the only one in the series where the player does not have to buy tricks. Instead, the basic trick-set the player gets is allocated depending on what type of move set the player defines for their character.

The game features fifteen professional skateboarders. Additionally, the player can unlock four other playable characters; Jango Fett from &quot;Star Wars&quot;, Eddie, the ubiquitous mascot of the heavy metal band Iron Maiden, Mike Vallely, who is a professional skater and wrestler, and Daisy, a female skater visually based on and voiced by Jenna Jameson.

With broadband, a room of up to eight people can be hosted. With dial-up, a room up to three people can be hosted. Players with either connection can join any room.

* Trick Attack: The goal is to get as many points as possible. Whoever has the most points at the end wins.
* Graffiti: If one player does a trick on an object, that object changes color to the player&#x27;s color. If another player does a bigger trick on it that is worth more points, they steal that object from other players. The one with the most tags wins.
* Combo Mambo: Almost the same as Trick Attack, except the highest number of points are done in one combo.
* King of the Hill: A capture the flag type of game wherein the player must hold a crown for as long as possible.
* Slap: The goal of the game is to hit each other. The faster skater will knock down the other.
* Free Skate: Practice.

==Reception==
The game received critical acclaim. IGN gave the Xbox version a 9/10, stating that &quot;&quot;Tony Hawk 4&quot; is by far the best skateboarding title around and head and shoulders above its &#x27;me-too&#x27; competition&quot;. The PlayStation 2 version received the highest score from IGN, with a 9.3/10, commenting that though the graphics hadn&#x27;t changed from its predecessor, the maps were much larger than in &quot;Pro Skater 3&quot;, along with praising the increased difficulty.

&quot;GameSpot&quot; named &quot;Pro Skater 4&quot; the best Xbox game, and second-best PlayStation 2 and GameCube game, of October 2002. It later won &quot;GameSpot&quot;″s annual &quot;Best Alternative Sports Game on GameCube&quot; and &quot;Best Alternative Sports Game on Xbox&quot; awards, and was nominated in the &quot;Game of the Year on GameCube&quot; and &quot;Best Online Game on PlayStation 2&quot; categories. During the 6th Annual Interactive Achievement Awards, &quot;Pro Skater 4&quot; received a nomination for &quot;Console Sports Game of the Year&quot; by the Academy of Interactive Arts &amp; Sciences.

===Game Boy Advance version===
&quot;GameSpot&quot; declared it the second-best Game Boy Advance game of November, behind &quot;Metroid Fusion&quot;, and a runner-up for the publication&#x27;s annual &quot;Best Sports Game on Game Boy Advance&quot; award, which went to &quot;Tony Hawk&#x27;s Pro Skater 3&quot;.
==Sequel==

A sequel to the game, titled &quot;Tony Hawk&#x27;s Underground&quot;, followed up in 2003.

===World War II===
The destroyer completed outfitting at Boston by 13 May when she reported to the Commander, Destroyers, Atlantic Fleet, for shakedown training. She conducted her initial training out of Casco Bay, Maine, until 18 June and, during the next three months, served as an escort for larger warships conducting their own shakedown cruises. On 10 September, &quot;Abbot&quot; departed the New England coast bound for the western Pacific. She transited the Panama Canal on 16 September and, after a brief stop at San Diego, California, resumed her voyage west on 28 September. The warship arrived in the Hawaiian Islands early in October and began additional training. However, a collision with aircraft carrier on 18 October forced her into the Pearl Harbor Navy Yard for a repair period lasting almost three months. &quot;Abbot&quot; finally returned to sea on 10 December and briefly resumed training.

====1944====
In mid-December, the destroyer stood out of Pearl Harbor, bound for the Ellice Islands, and arrived at Funafuti on the day after Christmas. Training and upkeep occupied her time through the early days of January 1944. Later that month, &quot;Abbot&quot; became a unit of Task Group 50.15 (TG 50.15), the so-called Neutralization Group attached to Task Force 58 (TF 58) for the occupation of the Marshall Islands. The assignment of that task group – carried out between 29 January and 17 February was to cut off bypassed Wotje and Taroa and to prevent enemy troops and war-planes there from supporting the Japanese garrisons at Majuro, Kwajalein, and Eniwetok. &quot;Abbot&quot; joined , , , and five other destroyers in frequent shore bombardments of the two atolls to keep troops occupied and planes grounded. She continued to perform that duty until 12 February at which time she began patrolling between Majuro and Kwajalein.

By the middle of March, the destroyer had been reassigned to the southwestern Pacific where she carried out convoy escort duty between the southern Solomons and the New Guinea ports of Milne Bay and Cape Sudest. In mid-April, she became an element of the screen of TG 78.2, an escort carrier group built around , , , and . The destroyer helped to protect the escort carriers from possible Japanese air and submarine attacks, while they launched their planes to provide close support for troops landing at Aitape and Hollandia on the northern coast of New Guinea. TG 78.2 ended that mission on 5 May, but &quot;Abbot&quot; remained with the escort carrier group until 7 May, when she and several other ships shaped a course for the New Hebrides Islands. She reached Espiritu Santo on 12 May.

For the next four weeks, &quot;Abbot&quot; received routine maintenance and conducted training evolutions out of Espiritu Santo. Early in June, the destroyer headed back toward the Central Pacific in company with escort carriers and other destroyers. They stopped at Kwajalein in the Marshalls to make final preparations for the assault on Saipan. On 12 June, she stood out of Kwajalein lagoon in company with TG 53.7, the Carrier Support Group built around , , and . The task group arrived in the Mariana Islands on 16 June. While the air groups of the three carriers provided close air support for the assault troops – first, at Saipan and, later at Guam — &quot;Abbot&quot; and her sister ships in the screen again protected the carriers from enemy air and submarine forces. She and her charges remained with the invasion force throughout the decisive Battle of the Philippine Sea in which TF 58 shattered the remnants of Japanese naval air power. About a week later, on 26 June, she and joined forces to splash a Mitsubishi G4M &quot;Betty&quot;. Through the month of July, &quot;Abbot&quot; continued to shepherd the carriers while their aviators struck targets on Saipan and Guam in support of the American invasion troops.

Early in August, &quot;Abbot&quot; returned to Pearl Harbor for repairs, relaxation, and training. On the 28th, she began preparing for another amphibious operation. She concluded that training during the second week in September and departed Hawaii on the 15th headed for the western Pacific. Steaming via Eniwetok, she arrived at Manus Island in the Admiralty Islands on 3 October. She resumed training at Manus until 14 October when she got underway with the transport screen bound for the invasion of the Philippines at Leyte. She arrived off the beaches of that island on 20 October and began providing antiaircraft and antisubmarine protection for the transport area. Though the group to which she was attached came under sporadic air attack that day, only one intruder approached near enough to &quot;Abbot&quot; for her to open up with her antiaircraft battery. However, that twin-engine bomber night. &quot;Abbot&quot; assisted the troops ashore with night illumination and harassing fire on enemy lines near Dulag.

On the morning of 21 October, &quot;Abbot&quot; retired from Leyte to escort a group of transports to Hollandia. She arrived at that New Guinea port on 26 October and remained there until 2 November when she returned to sea with a group of transports bound for Morotai in the northern Molucca Islands of the Netherlands East Indies (now part of Indonesia). She arrived at Morotai three days later and remained there for five days. During her stay at Morotai, the enemy staged frequent night air raids on the Morotai airfield but left the ships in the anchorage unmolested. However, this pattern changed after she departed the island with a Leyte-bound task group. As the group approached the Philippines, Japanese land-based air began intermittent day and night attacks. On 13 November, a Nakajima B6N &quot;Jill&quot; launched a torpedo in the midst of &quot;Abbot&quot;&#x27;s formation but failed to score a hit. repaid this impertinence by splashing the enemy plane some ahead of &quot;Abbot&quot;. After several days at anchor off Dulag – during which time she claimed to have damaged a Yokosuka D4Y &quot;Judy&quot; with her 5-inch battery — &quot;Abbot&quot; got underway for Hollandia on 24 November. She arrived at that New Guinea port on 29 November and remained there almost one month. On 23 December, the destroyer weighed anchor for the Philippines in company with a small cargoman and remained at Leyte through the end of the year and into 1945.

====1945====
Provisioning and upkeep complete, &quot;Abbot&quot; put to sea on 2 January 1945 with TG 77.4, the Escort Carrier Group for the invasion of Luzon at Lingayen Gulf. Within that task organization, she was assigned to the screen of Rear Admiral Felix Stump&#x27;s San Fabian Carrier Group. During the voyage from Leyte to Lingayen, the formation came under increasingly intense air attacks by the &quot;kamikaze&quot; corps. On 4 January, one aircraft succeeded in crashing into and damaged that escort carrier so badly that she was abandoned and sunk by a torpedo from . On 6 January, the Support Carrier Group divided into its constituent units, the Lingayen and San Fabian groups. &quot;Abbot&quot; continued to provide antisubmarine and anti-air protection to the San Fabian group while aircraft from its carriers carried out prelanding bombing and strafing missions and, after the ninth, supported the invasion troops in their struggle to wrest the island from the Japanese. That duty – as well as support for the secondary landings at San Felipe and Nsugbu — lasted until 31 January. At that time, &quot;Abbot&quot; departed Lingayen Gulf in company with the carriers and headed for Mindoro.

After a week of duty at Mangarin Bay, Mindoro, &quot;Abbot&quot; set a course for Subic Bay in the screen of the carriers. From that base, she joined the carriers in supporting the assaults on the islands in Manila Bay — Corregidor, El Fraile, Carabao, and Caballo. &quot;Abbot&quot; herself destroyed a number of mines around Corregidor and captured three Japanese who attempted the swim from Corregidor to Bataan. After the 15 February paratroop landing on Corregidor, the destroyer provided call fire and night illumination fire.

On 17 February, she returned to Subic Bay for a week of replenishment and upkeep before sailing for Palawan on the 24th. In company with cruisers , , , and three other destroyers, &quot;Abbot&quot; steamed up to support elements of the Army&#x27;s 41st Infantry Division&#x27;s assault on Puerto Princesa — the main port on Palawan. No gunfire from the warships was necessary, however, and they headed back to Subic Bay later that day. &quot;Abbot&quot; remained at Subic Bay in an upkeep status until 4 March when she joined another cruiser-destroyer force for the assault on Zamboanga, Mindanao. There, she acted as fire-support ship for the minesweepers as well as for the troops ashore. On 11 March, she patrolled near Basilan Island — located to the south of Zamboanga Peninsula — and destroyed enemy barges with gunfire. The following day, &quot;Abbot&quot;″s unit completed its mission at Mindanao, headed back to Luzon, and arrived back at Subic Bay on 17 March.

After a week of upkeep and logistics there, the warship resumed missions in support of the occupation of the remaining Japanese-held Philippine Islands. On 24 March, she stood out of Subic Bay with a cruiser-destroyer force on its way to help liberate Cebu in the Visayas subgroup. Two days later, she opened fire in the prelanding bombardment at beaches some four miles (6 km) west of Cebu City. The troops went ashore around 08:30 and the warships then shifted to call fire and harassing fire. From there, she proceeded to San Pedro Bay, Leyte, escorting a mixed group of LCMs and LCIs. After her arrival at San Pedro Bay, she remained there for the rest of March undergoing a tender availability. Through most of April, the destroyer was attached to the Commander, Philippine Sea Frontier, for whom she conducted a series of missions carrying mail and passengers.

On 24 April, she was returned to the operational control of the Commander, 7th Amphibious Force. She moved to Cebu harbor where she served standby duty as fire—support ship for the Americal Division. That assignment proved relatively uneventful until the first week in May. On 3 May, she took under fire a group of houses on Nailon Point near Tobagan village, Cebu, rumored to harbor a concentration of Japanese troops. From there. &quot;Abbot&quot; moved along the coast toward Cebu harbor, firing at targets of opportunity as she went. She repeated the mission three days later and then departed Cebu on 8 May. Staged through Mindoro, the destroyer participated in the landings at Macajalar Bay on the island of Mindanao. She participated in the preparatory shore bombardment early on the 10th though it later proved to have been unnecessary when the assault troops encountered absolutely no Japanese. The ship remained in the neighborhood until the 14th to be on hand should her guns be needed. On that day, she shaped a course back to San Pedro Bay and spent the next three weeks engaged in patrols and escort missions in the southern Philippines. She concluded her Philippine service with a 10-day tender availability at Leyte.

On 12 June, the warship reported for duty with the 3rd Fleet and was assigned to duty with the fast carriers in the screen of TG 38.3. Her task group departed Leyte Gulf on 1 July bound for an operating area just to the east of the Japanese home islands, and &quot;Abbot&quot; steamed out with them. While the carriers&#x27; aircraft attacked the enemy&#x27;s homeland, the destroyer joined the other escorts in protecting their mobile bases from air and submarine attack. However, on two occasions, &quot;Abbot&quot; also got in her own licks. Just after noon on 14 July, TG 34.8.1, a special force – composed of battleships , , , cruisers , , &quot;Abbot&quot;, and eight other destroyers – was detached from the TF 38 screen and closed the shores of northern Honshū near the city of Kamaishi. During six bombardment passes, the force fired over 2,300 shells of various calibers into the Japan Iron Works plant located there. A second and similar mission brought TG 34.8.1 back to the shores of Honshū at Hamamatsu on 29 July. Otherwise, &quot;Abbot&quot; served in the screen of TF 38.

On 8 August, the destroyer was shifted to TG 35.4 consisting of a cruiser division and a squadron of destroyers. Their assignment was to investigate surface targets reported some 63 miles (101 km) from the main formation. While she was forming up at , her starboard propeller and a portion of her tail shaft broke off just forward of the after strut bearing. The damages forced her to rejoin the main force though she remained seaworthy, capable of , and able to maintain station in formation. The following day, when suffered a &quot;kamikaze&quot; hit, &quot;Abbot&quot; rendered assistance and escorted her to a rendezvous with hospital ship to evacuate casualties and thence to Saipan for repairs. The ships arrived at Saipan on 17 August, two days after the cessation of hostilities. There, &quot;Abbot&quot; herself entered drydock where her damage was found to be sufficiently serious to warrant her retiring, via Hawaii, to the Puget Sound Navy Yard. She arrived in Bremerton, Washington, early in September. After repairs, she reported to the Commander, San Diego Group, Pacific Reserve Fleet, for inactivation. &quot;Abbot&quot; was placed out of commission on 21 May 1946 and was berthed at San Diego.

===1950–1959===
&quot;Abbot&quot; spent almost five years in the Reserve Fleet, before the outbreak of hostilities in Korea in the summer of 1950 brought a need for more active ships in the Fleet. Though recommissioned on 26 February 1951, the destroyer spent the next three months at the Mare Island Naval Shipyard undergoing alterations and modernization. On 1 June, she put to sea, bound for her first operational assignment since returning to active service. Instead of Korea, however, the east coast of the United States proved to be her destination. Later that month, she transited the Panama Canal and arrived in her new home port, Newport, Rhode Island For the remainder of 1951, the destroyer underwent repairs at the Philadelphia Naval Shipyard followed by refresher training out of Guantánamo Bay, Cuba. She spent the first three months of 1952 preparing for her first deployment to the Mediterranean Sea with the 6th Fleet. That assignment began in April and ended with her return to Newport in October. &quot;Abbot&quot; spent the next 19 months operating out of Newport engaged in training evolutions — antisubmarine warfare (ASW) exercises, independent ship&#x27;s exercises, and refresher training.

On 1 June 1954, the destroyer departed Newport in company with Destroyer Division 242 (DesDiv 242) on what proved to be a seven-month circumnavigation of the globe. Steaming via the Panama Canal, San Diego, Oahu, and Midway, she joined the 7th Fleet at Yokosuka, Japan, and operated in the South China Sea and in the Taiwan Strait until October. On 18 October, she headed back to the United States, via the Indian Ocean, the Suez Canal, the Mediterranean Sea, and the Atlantic Ocean, making numerous port calls along the way. The destroyer arrived back at Newport on 18 December 1954 and remained in the Newport area through January 1955. In February and March of that year, the warship participated in the annual &quot;Springboard&quot; exercise conducted near Guantánamo Bay, Cuba. She returned to Newport in March and began normal operations – independent ship&#x27;s exercises and hunter/killer antisubmarine warfare exercises – out of her home port. Save for a three-week midshipman cruise to St. John&#x27;s, Newfoundland, in August, she busied herself with normal operations for the remainder of the year.

Early in 1956, &quot;Abbot&quot; entered the Boston Naval Shipyard for a 19-week repair period. Leaving the yard on 19 May, the destroyer conducted refresher training in Cuban waters through most of June. In July, she was reassigned to Destroyer Squadron 10 (DesRon 10) along with her entire division, DesDiv 242, which became DesDiv 102. The warship spent the period from September to November either alongside a tender or in the Boston Naval Shipyard undergoing preparations for a deployment to the Mediterranean. That assignment began in November 1956 and lasted until February 1957. The destroyer returned to Newport on 22 February and, after an availability period, resumed normal exercises and type training. That summer, she made a two-month midshipman cruise that took her to Rio de Janeiro and to the West Indies. In the fall, &quot;Abbot&quot; participated in Operation Strikeback, a NATO exercise conducted in the northeastern Atlantic. During that mission, she made port visits to Belfast in Northern Ireland and to Chatham, England. Upon her return to the New England coast late in October, the ship resumed type training and exercises out of Newport and continued such duty for the rest of 1957.

On 15 January 1958, &quot;Abbot&quot; entered the Boston Naval Shipyard for her regular overhaul. After three months of repairs and modifications, she spent another month conducting refresher training out of Guantánamo Bay, Cuba. She then returned to Newport, where she spent June and the first week of July. On 11 July, she stood out of Newport bound for Annapolis, Maryland, where she embarked Naval Academy midshipmen for their summer cruise. Not long thereafter, President Camille Chamoun of Lebanon — whose country had been gripped by steadily intensifying civil strife — requested United States help in restoring order. Forces already in the Mediterranean were dispatched to his aid. &quot;Abbot&quot; and the rest of DesRon 10 escorted amphibious forces to Vieques Island and, after a stop at San Juan, Puerto Rico, headed across the Atlantic to bolster those units. She made brief stops at Gibraltar and Naples before joining TF 66 – the 6th Fleet fast carrier force – off the Levantine coast. Two weeks later, she anchored at Beirut, the Lebanese capital, to serve as gunfire support ship for the Marine Corps and Army troops operating ashore. By the end of summer, the crisis had subsided, and &quot;Abbot&quot; took up routine 6th Fleet duty until returning to Newport on Veterans Day 1958.

===1959–1965===
Her return to Newport brought a resumption of hunter/killer exercises in New England coastal waters. On 1 May 1959, the destroyer was transferred from DesRon 10 to Escort Squadron 14 (CortRon 14) as the squadron flagship. Her mission, however, remained antisubmarine warfare though in a more defensive rather than offensive mode. Later that month, she began an overhaul at the Boston Naval Shipyard. She completed repairs at the end of the summer and spent the month of September engaged in refresher training near Guantánamo Bay and at Culebra Island, Puerto Rico. In October, she returned north to Newport and resumed her antisubmarine warfare exercises.

That employment occupied her for the remainder of 1959 and throughout 1960. On 5 May 1961, &quot;Abbot&quot; briefly entered the race for space. Supporting the sub-orbital flight of &quot;Freedom 7&quot;, &quot;Abbot&quot; was detailed to help recover the Mercury capsule after splash-down roughly east of Cape Canaveral, Florida. The mission was designated MR-3, or Mercury-Redstone 3, and it was the United States&#x27;s answer to the successful flight of Yuri Gagarin, the Soviet cosmonaut who became the first human in space. In September 1961, &quot;Abbot&quot; became the school ship for the Destroyer Officer&#x27;s School located at Newport. Her routine of service along the east coast and in the West Indies training naval officers in their future duties on board destroyer-type warships was broken twice in 1962. In August, she was ordered to Guantánamo Bay, where she served as a base defense ship during disorders in Haiti. Then, in October, she participated in operations enforcing the quarantine of Cuba established by President John F. Kennedy after he learned that Soviet offensive missiles had been based on that island. She was released from that duty in mid-November and returned to Newport on the 24th to resume her training missions.

&quot;Abbot&quot; continued her role as a training platform for prospective destroyer officers until April 1964. On 14 April, she departed Newport for Philadelphia for her last active duty assignment. At Philadelphia, she served as a Naval Reserve training ship for almost a year and as flagship for Reserve Destroyer Squadron 30. She was decommissioned on 26 March 1965 at Philadelphia and, for the next decade, was berthed with the Philadelphia Group, Atlantic Reserve Fleet.

Struck from the Navy list on 1 December 1974, she was sold for scrapping to the Boston Metals Company of Baltimore, Maryland, in August 1975.

<text>Armand Louis de Gontaut (), duc de Lauzun, later duc de Biron, and usually referred to by historians of the French Revolution simply as Biron (13 April 174731 December 1793), was a French soldier and politician, known for the part he played in the American War of Independence and the French Revolutionary Wars. In 1773, he was Grand second warden of Grand Orient de France.

==Biography==

===Early life===
Born in Paris to Charles Antoine de Gontaut de Biron (8 October 1708 – 25 Octobre 1798) and his wife Antoinette-Eustachie née Crozat du Châtel (25 October 1727 – 16 April 1747), daughter of Louis François Crozat (1691–1750), granddaughter of banker Antoine Crozat, the first proprietary owner of French Louisiana, from 1712 to 1717. Armand Louis bore the title of Duc de Lauzun, which had passed, on the death of Antoine Nompar de Caumont, duc de Lauzun (1633–1723), to his niece, the wife of Charles Armand de Gontaut, duc de Biron (1663–1756). It was strongly rumored at the time that duc de Biron&#x27;s actual father was Étienne François, duc de Choiseul, his mother&#x27;s lover and close friend of his father.

In 1788, he succeeded to the duchy of Biron on the death of his uncle, Louis Antoine de Gontaut, duc de Biron (1700–1788). On 4 February 1766 he married Amélie de Boufflers (5 May 1751 – guillotined on 27 June 1794), only daughter of Charles-Joseph de Boufflers (1731–1751) and Mary Anne Philippine de Montmorency Logny (1732–1797). He lived apart from his wife, had no children (legitimate, at least), even though his wife was a young woman described as a paragon of gentle, virginal shyness; a combination of shrewdness and simplicity. Similarly the Duke was a popular companion and house guest.

He served in the guards as early as 1761, and in 1767 made the expedition of Corsica as aide-de-camp of de Chanvelin. On 29 June 1769, he was made chevalier of the order of Saint Louis. Traveling throughout Europe, engaging in idle frivolity, and – according to his Memoirs – various love affairs, he wasted his fortune, which in 1777 forced him to transfer his estates to Henri Louis, Prince of Guéméné (grand chamberlain and captain lieutenant of the gendarmes of the king&#x27;s ordinary guard), upon the payment of an annuity of 80,000 livres. The prince, however, became bankrupt and the annuity was reduced more than half. Around that time he attracted attention by an essay on the military defenses of Great Britain and her colonies (État de défense d’Angleterre et de toutes ses possessions dans les quatres parties du monde), leading to his appointment to a command against the English in 1779, in which he had some success. That in turn lead to his being sent with some ships under the command of Louis-Philippe de Rigaud, Marquis de Vaudreuil on an expedition to Senegal and other coast possessions of the English, de Veudreuil capturing Senegal in January 1779, shortly before sailing to North America in aid of Rochambeau in 1780. Though the fortress at Cape Blanc he seized on 30 January 1779 was recaptured directly after his departure during the same year, de Vaudreuil was awarded the Grand Cross of St. Louis in 1789, whereas Lauzun received the title of colonel of hussars, and became colonel of a foreign regiment named after him. Appointed brigadier on the first of March, 1780, Lauzun decided to take part in the War of American Independence.

===American Revolution service===
Following his appointment to a command against the British in 1779, commanding the troops that captured Fort St Louis, in Senegal, from the British, Lauzun raised an army of volunteer hussars and infantry, subsequently known as Lauzun&#x27;s Legion, for service in North America. He arrived with 600 of his men in Rhode Island; the remainder were in France, prevented from leaving. Despite having only a portion of his force, he engaged in several active skirmishes, including one near Gloucester, Virginia on 4 October 1781.

In 1781, he took an important part in the American War of Independence by being the advance party of the main French army of Rochambeau sent to reinforce General George Washington at the Siege of Yorktown in 1781. Lauzun&#x27;s Legion left their winter quarters in Lebanon, Connecticut on 9 June 1781 and marched south through Connecticut known as the Washington-Rochambeau Revolutionary Route. Their main function was to be an advance party but also to remain ten to fifteen miles south of the main army to protect the flank against any British located in the many Tory towns in lower Fairfield County. While in Connecticut, the French made camps in Middletown, Wallingford, North Haven, Ripton and North Stratford. They arrived at North Stratford, now Nichols on 28 June and stayed for two days. From the hilltop in North Stratford, now Abraham Nichols Park, one could easily see for seventy miles past Long Island Sound to New York and beyond. The French used this time to conduct reconnaissance on British ships in New York harbor.

De Lauzun received the order to sail for France on 11 March 1783. On 24 October 1781, after the Siege of Yorktown, &quot;Surveillante&quot;, under Villeneuve Cillart, brought Lauzun to France to bring the news of the victory. She arrived at Brest on 15 November. Lauzun had a hero&#x27;s welcome and was made &quot;maréchal de camp&quot;.

On the death of his uncle, Louis Antoine de Gontaut, in 1788, he took the title of the duke de Biron. In 1789 he was returned as deputy to the States General by the noblesse of Quercy and attached himself to the revolutionary cause. He entered the party of the duke Philippe d&#x27;Orléans and later was accused of being the confidant and his secret agent. He several times mounted the tribune to exculpate him and in the proceedings of the Chatelet, relative to the crimes of 5 and 6 October 1789, he was accused of having appeared with him in the midst of the assassins.

===French Revolution service===

In 1789, he was returned as deputy to the Estates-General by the &quot;noblesse&quot; of the seneschalty of Quercy, and affiliated with the Revolutionary cause. In 1791, he was sent by the National Constituent Assembly to receive the oath of the army of Flanders, and was subsequently appointed to its command. In July 1792 he was named commander of the Army of the Rhine, with the duty of watching the movements of the Habsburg monarchy troops.

In May 1793, he was transferred to the command of the French Revolutionary Army on the La Rochelle front, the Army of the Coasts of La Rochelle, operating against the Vendéan insurgency against the Reign of Terror. He gained several successes, among them the capture of Saumur and the victory of Parthenay (Bataille de Parthenay), but the insubordination of his troops and the suspicions of his political supervisors made his position intolerable and he sent in his resignation, ending his command on 16 July 1793.

===Execution===
He was accused by the notorious Jean-Baptiste Carrier of &quot;incivisme&quot; (&quot;lack of civic virtue&quot;, the equivalent of treason under the Reign of Terror) and undue leniency to the insurgents, deprived of his command (July). The public prosecutor Antoine Quentin Fouquier-Tinville accused him of &quot;having conspired against the unity and indivisibility of the Republic and the tranquility of the interior and exterior security of the French Empire and betraying the interests of the Republic (&quot;conspiré contre l&#x27;unité et l&#x27;indivisibilité de la République et la tranquillité de la sûreté intérieure et extérieure de l&#x27;Empire français et trahir les intérêts de la République en abusant de sa qualité&quot;). Imprisoned in the Abbaye, sentenced to death by the Revolutionary Tribunal and guillotined. His wife, Amélie de Boufflers, was herself executed on 27 June 1794.

==Works==
His &quot;Memoires&quot;, which come down to 1783, were published under his name in 1822 (and reprinted in a new edition of 1858), and letters were published in 1865, said to have been written by him in 1789 to friends in the country, describing the Estates-General.

<text>Ala&#x27;a Hussein Ali Al-Khafaji Al-Jaber (; born ) was the head of the Republic of Kuwait (August 4–8, 1990), a brief puppet government in Kuwait during the initial stages of the Gulf War.

==Career==
Ali held dual nationalities as an Iraqi and Kuwaiti, having grown up in Kuwait and studied in Baghdad where he became a member of the ruling Baath party. Having held a lieutenant&#x27;s commission in the Kuwaiti army prior to the invasion, Ali was promoted to colonel in Baghdad and placed at the head of a 9-member puppet government during the invasion. A week later Kuwait was annexed by Iraq and Ali became Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister.

In 1993, Ali was sentenced &quot;in absentia&quot; to death by hanging for treason by the Kuwaiti government. In January 2000 he returned to Kuwait attempting to appeal the sentence. The court however, affirmed Ali&#x27;s conviction on May 3, 2000. In March 2001, his sentence was commuted to life in prison.

<doc id="760423" wikidata="Q2618100" url="?curid=760423" title="Seattle Center Monorail">
<text>The Seattle Center Monorail is an elevated straddle-beam monorail line in Seattle, Washington, United States. The monorail runs along 5th Avenue between the Seattle Center and Westlake Center in Downtown Seattle, making no intermediate stops. The monorail is a major tourist attraction but also operates as a regular public transit service with trains every ten minutes running for up to 16 hours per day. It was constructed in eight months at a cost of $4.2 million for the 1962 Century 21 Exposition, a world&#x27;s fair hosted at the Seattle Center. The monorail underwent major renovations in 1988 after the southern terminal was moved from its location over Pine Street to inside the Westlake Center shopping mall.

The system retains its original fleet of two Alweg trains from the world&#x27;s fair; each carries up to 450 people. It is owned by the city government, which designated the tracks and trains as a historic landmark in 2003. A private contractor has operated the system since 1994, when it replaced King County Metro, the county&#x27;s public transit system. The monorail carries approximately two million people annually and earns a profit split between the contractor and the city government. The monorail usually operates with one train per track, and the entire trip takes approximately two minutes. Several major accidents have occurred during the system&#x27;s half-century in service, including a train-to-train collision in 2005 on a gauntlet track near the Westlake Center terminal.

Several government agencies and private companies have proposed expansions to the monorail system since its inception in the 1960s. The most prominent was the Seattle Monorail Project, founded by a 1997 ballot initiative to build a citywide network that would expand coverage beyond the planned Link light rail system. The project ran into financial difficulties, including cost estimates rising to $11 billion, before being cancelled by a city vote in 2005.

==Route and stations==
The monorail begins at a terminal at the Seattle Center, a civic complex and park northwest of Downtown Seattle. The Seattle Center terminal is located at the Next 50 Plaza near the center of the complex, adjacent to the Space Needle, Chihuly Garden and Glass, and Memorial Stadium. It is elevated above the south end of the plaza and consists of three platforms arranged in the Spanish solution: two side platforms for alighting and a center platform for boarding. The monorail trains&#x27; maintenance facility is below the platforms at ground level in the Seattle Center station. From the terminal, the tracks travel east and begin a wide turn to the south while passing through the Museum of Pop Culture, which was designed around the existing tracks.

The monorail tracks cross over Broad Street and travel along the west side of 5th Avenue North for two blocks, passing the KOMO Plaza news broadcasting center. The tracks then begin a gradual southeastern turn over a small office building and auto repair shop toward 5th Avenue, which begins on the south side of Denny Way and Tilikum Place. The one-way street travels southeast through Belltown with southbound-only traffic, split into two sets of through lanes by the monorail&#x27;s supporting columns. Vehicular traffic is permitted to change lanes between the monorail columns despite the visual obstructions they create.

The monorail passes by several city landmarks, including the Amazon Spheres and Westin Seattle towers, eventually reaching McGraw Square, where 5th Avenue makes a slight turn to the south. Before reaching the southern terminal at the Westlake Center shopping mall on Pine Street, the monorail&#x27;s tracks narrow into a set of gauntlet tracks that are apart, preventing two trains from using the station at the same time. The Westlake Center terminal is on the third floor of the mall and has a direct elevator to street level and the Westlake tunnel station served by Link light rail trains on the 1 Line. The South Lake Union Streetcar also terminates at nearby McGraw Square, and several major bus routes run near the Westlake Center terminal.

==Service and fares==
The monorail takes approximately two minutes to travel between the Seattle Center and Westlake Center terminals, which are located apart. Trains depart from each terminal approximately every 10 minutes, with a single train running continuously. The service has two seasonal schedules, with trains in the autumn and winter (September to May) operating for 13–14 hours per day from Monday to Saturday, ending at 11:00 p.m. on Fridays and Saturdays, and 12 hours on Sundays, ending at 9:00 p.m. The summer schedule is in use from May to September and has weekday trains operating for 16 hours and weekend trains for 15 hours, with service ending at 11:00 p.m. every day. Monorail service is typically reduced on national holidays and closed entirely on Thanksgiving Day and Christmas. During special events at the Seattle Center and Climate Pledge Arena, operating hours are extended and train frequencies are increased to every four minutes by using both trains in the fleet.

Fares for the monorail are paid at turnstiles at either terminal using an ORCA card, a smartphone app, or paper tickets bought from a vending machine with credit/debit cards, or mobile payments. One-way fares are $3.50 for adults, $1.75 for youths aged 6–18, and $1.75 for people qualifying for the reduced rate, including senior citizens 65 years and older, disabled individuals, persons with Medicare cards, and active duty members of the U.S. military carrying their identification cards. Round-trip fares are twice the price of a one-way fare; monthly passes are also offered at adult and reduced rates. Children aged five and under are able to ride free. In October 2019, the monorail began accepting ORCA cards, the regional transit payment system, after five years of negotiations and a study over fare integration; since May 2023, youth ORCA cards are charged a $0 fare on the monorail as part of a statewide program to provide free transit for riders aged 18 years or younger. Free fares have also been provided to attendees of all public events at Climate Pledge Arena through a mobile app since January 2023 after an existing program for the Seattle Kraken and Seattle Storm was expanded.

==Operations==

A private contractor, Seattle Monorail Services (SMS), founded in 1994, and currently owned by former Port of Seattle commissioner Tom Albro, operates the Seattle Center Monorail. Before 1994, the monorail was jointly operated by the Seattle Center and King County Metro, the county&#x27;s public transit agency. The monorail receives no operating funds from public sources, with costs covered by fares and federal grants for capital projects; the service is unusual among U.S. public transport systems because it makes an operating profit. The contract between SMS and the city government is renewed every ten years and includes an even split of profits between the two parties.

In 2022, the Seattle Center Monorail carried approximately 1.6 million passengers, averaging 3,898 passengers on weekdays and 6,023 passengers on weekends. Following declines due to the COVID-19 pandemic, ridership rebounded in 2022 and 2023 with the opening of Climate Pledge Arena, where event tickets include free transit fares. The service generated $4.3 million in fare revenue and received approximately $1.68 million in capital funds from local and federal governments in 2022. During the Century 21 Exposition from March to September 1962, the monorail carried over 90 percent of World&#x27;s Fair visitors and had a total ridership of 7.4 million.

===Rolling stock and guideway===
The straddle-beam monorail is entirely elevated and uses a series of 68 hollow support columns up to above street level. The two parallel tracks are carried on prestressed concrete beams that are approximately long, tall, and wide. Several sections use split or one-armed columns that carry one track because of a lack of space on curves; the guideway passes over one building at the intersection of Denny Way and 5th Avenue as part of a long curve in the tracks. The system&#x27;s maintenance and operations base is underneath the platforms at the Seattle Center terminal.

The system has two aluminum trains, named the &quot;Blue Train&quot; (originally &quot;Spirit of Seattle&quot;) and &quot;Red Train&quot; (originally &quot;Spirit of Century 21&quot;) for their original paint schemes, which are each assigned to a single track and travel bidirectionally. They were constructed in 1962 by Alwac International in West Germany and have remained in operation on the line since then, undergoing a major renovation in 2009 and 2010. Each train is long, wide, and tall, with articulating joints between sections. They each have 124 seats and a capacity of 450 passengers with standing room, with an estimated maximum throughput of 10,800 passengers per hour. The trains have built-in emergency ramps to transfer passengers between trains if stopped between stations.

Each train rides on a set of 64 pneumatic rubber tires arranged into eight bogies: 16 are load-bearing tires arranged in pairs on top of the beam and have a diameter of ; the remaining 48 tires are used to guide the train on the side of the beam and have a diameter of . The system was designed for automated driving, but operators control the trains using a joystick and LCD monitors that display technical information. The trains typically coast without power for the latter half of their journey and switch to dynamic brakes when approaching a station. The system uses a third rail for electrification, with 700 volts that feed eight electric motors. Originally, the trains could reach speeds of up to , but this has since been reduced to for normal operations. During severe winter weather, the trains deposit de-icing chemicals and salt on the tracks to allow for normal speeds.

==History==

===Early proposals and planning===
Several small-scale proposals for monorail systems in the Seattle area were published in the early 20th century, but they were never realized. William H. Boyes, a New York City inventor, was photographed with a replica of his monorail in 1910, with plans to build a line from Seattle to Tacoma. A year later, another Boyes proposal earned an operating franchise from the city government of Edmonds, Washington, but never proceeded beyond the early stages of construction. Another plan from the Universal Elevated Railway Company in 1918 envisioned an elevated monorail system that would run along Westlake Avenue in Seattle (near the modern-day monorail terminal), replacing the private streetcar network. After the streetcars were acquired by the city government in 1919, its lobbying for a monorail system ceased. Other plans for monorail systems were submitted to the Seattle city government in 1930 and 1955, the latter as part of the Everett–Seattle–Tacoma Tollway (modern Interstate 5).

The Seattle city government, supported by civic boosters and the state legislature, began planning for its second World&#x27;s Fair in 1955 to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the 1909 Alaska–Yukon–Pacific Exposition. A monorail was suggested in 1957 to connect the proposed fairgrounds in Lower Queen Anne to auxiliary parking lots in Interbay and attractions on Elliott Bay. The Seattle Transit Commission ordered a study into a monorail between Downtown Seattle and the proposed fairgrounds in April 1958, after hearing proposals from private operators who also offered New Orleans and Houston their own systems. Among the proposals was a &quot;carveyor&quot; from the Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company with small pods connecting downtown to the fairgrounds and a loop between Interbay, the fairgrounds, and downtown. The monorail proposal was later scaled back to a route on 5th Avenue connecting downtown hotels to the fairgrounds that would cost $5.39 million to construct (equivalent to $ in dollars).

===Bidding and proposals===

The Seattle Transit System opened up bids for monorail design and construction in December 1958, receiving proposals from the Lockheed Corporation, St. Louis Car Company, General Monorail of San Francisco, and the German firm Alwac International, which had begun installing the Disneyland Monorail in California. The Northrop Corporation presented its own proposal in February, using an unconventional gyroscope and generator that would not require a third rail or overhead catenary. In April 1959, the Seattle Transit Commission chose Lockheed to build the $5 million monorail system, which would travel along 5th Avenue from Pine Street to the fairgrounds and open in 1961. Lockheed&#x27;s design featured a straddle-beam monorail with three streamlined trains that resembled jetliners.

The monorail was seen as a centerpiece to the planned Century 21 Exposition and as a catalyst for future development of a citywide rapid transit system, but would use no local transit funding. The operating costs were expected to be paid through fare recovery, while other options were considered for capital funding, including Lockheed buying back the system after the world&#x27;s fair. Lockheed entered into final negotiations with the city and exposition organizers in late 1959, but the transit commission lost interest in running the system after the world&#x27;s fair was shortened to six months instead of the original eighteen. The system&#x27;s uncertain financing, not including engineering costs incurred by Lockheed, remained a major concern for the city government as negotiations continued into January 1960.

Alwac International, which had previously estimated it would cost $3.5 million ($ in dollars) to install their Alweg monorail system, submitted a proposal in February 1960 to finance and build the project themselves at no cost to the city or exposition organizers. The firm would collect monorail fares and revenue from terminal concessions, and a surcharge on fair tickets, and transfer the system to the city government if the full $3.5 million cost was repaid; in the event that the system did not recoup the investment, it would have been dismantled and removed. Lockheed responded by presenting a modified bid to the transit commission in March with a $1 million buyback option, but they were dropped in favor of a new round of bidding by Alwac and the French engineering firm SAFEGE.

The Century 21 Steering Committee, serving as the exposition&#x27;s main organizers, took over negotiations from the transit commission and signed a preliminary construction contract with Alwac on May 20, 1960. The monorail would run along 5th Avenue from the fairgrounds to the intersection of Pine Street and Westlake Avenue, which would be converted into a permanent pedestrian mall. Alwac representatives signed the design contract on December 22, 1960, with a revised cost of $4.2 million ($ in dollars) to accommodate larger trains and stations. The final construction and operations contract was signed on May 13, 1961. Century 21 announced plans in April 1961 to build a small-scale people mover around the fairgrounds that would use a suspended monorail, but they were dropped five months later after the bidding firms were unable to obtain financing.

===Construction and preparations===
In March 1961, the city&#x27;s Board of Public Works approved the construction and street use permits for the monorail project, which Century 21, Alwac, and local contractor Howard S. Wright Construction Company would undertake. Wright was also named a financing partner for the monorail, contributing $375,000 ($ in dollars), and went on to build the Space Needle and Seattle Center Coliseum. The construction permit included a requirement to remove the monorail within six months of the exposition&#x27;s end, but Alwac had announced their intention to sell the Alweg system to the city government if they desired. Alweg representatives unveiled the finalized design plans for the monorail later that month, while the two railcars were under construction at the Linke-Hofmann-Busch factory in West Germany. Century 21 broke ground on the monorail in a ceremony at the Westlake Mall on April 6, 1961, which was declared &quot;Monorail Day&quot; and featured the Seattle Symphony Orchestra, a speech from Senator Warren G. Magnuson, and free monorail tickets for the 500 people in attendance.

The wooden forms for the first of 80 monorail columns were laid in early May, and concrete pouring for the first column began on May 23 between Virginia and Lenora streets. A crane lifted the Virginia–Lenora columns, each weighing , onto a prepared concrete footing on June 15. Concrete pouring at the Westlake Mall terminal began in late June, with plans to build the station platforms over Pine Street. The monorail&#x27;s precast concrete beams were assembled in Tacoma and trucked up to Seattle, with special permission from the Washington State Highway Commission, and the first was installed on September 21 between Virginia and Stewart streets before advancing northwards. Column construction and girder installation took approximately eight months, with at least three lanes of traffic on 5th Avenue remaining open during most periods.

The steel girders at the Westlake Mall terminal were installed in October, followed by work on the Seattle Center terminal. By December 1961, most of the work on the tracks and 54 percent of work on the stations was complete, using of concrete and of steel. The last of the 138 guideway beams was hoisted and installed on January 9, 1962, near Denny Way to complete of track. In February 1962, the Seattle Transit Commission approved a contract with Century 21 to allow its employees to operate the monorail trains. Monorail personnel, including drivers and ticket booth attendants, wore blue-and-white poplin uniforms designed for the exposition.

The first monorail train, later named the &quot;Blue Train&quot;, was shipped in four sections from Bremen, West Germany, to Newark, New Jersey, and transported by train to Seattle. It arrived on February 19, 1962, and was lifted onto the trackway later that day. The monorail completed its first test run on March 3 and continued with several tests at reduced speeds. Jim West, a former cable car operator on the Yesler Way line who later drove the city&#x27;s streetcars, trolleybuses and motor buses, drove the first test run. Several test runs were made into special occasions, including a trip that was televised live by KING-TV and a preview ride for 175 dignitaries after a ribbon cutting at the Westlake terminal on March 12. The second train, later named the &quot;Red Train&quot;, arrived on March 27 and was installed on its track at the Seattle Center terminal. It made its first test run on April 10 and entered passenger service to replace the Blue Train temporarily before the beginning of the fair.

===World&#x27;s Fair===
The monorail and Space Needle opened for a public preview on March 24, 1962, a month before the formal start of the Century 21 Exposition. The inaugural monorail trip from the Westlake terminal carried 130 passengers who received commemorative medals, including the first riders, who had lined up several hours early. An estimated 9,600 people rode the Blue Train on the monorail&#x27;s first day, as did 24,000 over the preview weekend; service on the first day was suspended an hour earlier than scheduled because of a mechanical issue. Government officials and civic leaders officially christened the monorail on April 19. 179,000 passengers had boarded the trains during preview rides.

The Century 21 Exposition formally opened on April 21. Monorail fares during the fair were set at 50 cents one-way and 75 cents round-trip for adults and 35 cents one-way and 50 cents round-trip for children. Trains operated from 8:45 a.m. to 12:15 a.m. during the fair, taking 96 seconds to complete each trip. It carried 7.4 million passengers, about 90 percent of fair attendees, from April 21 to October 21. Astronaut John Glenn rode the monorail on May 10, shortly after his return from orbit on Friendship 7; the red train was temporarily renamed &quot;Friendship 21&quot; in his honor and also carried Governor Albert D. Rosellini, Senator Warren G. Magnuson, and NASA rocket scientist Wernher von Braun. After the fair, the monorail operated with a reduced schedule, from 11:00 a.m. to 11:00 p.m. It was limited to one train over the winter months but averaged 1,200 daily passengers.

Fare box revenue generated from March 24 to September 17 fully covered the system&#x27;s $4.2 million construction costs. Alwac retained temporary ownership of the monorail system after the fair contracted to end on April 21, 1963. The city government was tasked with deciding whether the monorail should be demolished or sold to a public or private operator. Alwac was granted an extension of its existing street use permit to operate trains until October. Among the proposals considered was Samuel J. LeFrak&#x27;s plan to sell the system to New York City for the 1964 World&#x27;s Fair in Flushing Meadows.

Alwac agreed to transfer the entire system, including the terminals and offices, to Century 21 Center, Inc., the operator of the fairgrounds, on June 3, 1963. The transfer came at no cost to Century 21 and allowed the monorail to remain in operation and included an extension of agreements with the city government and Seattle Transit System.

===Ownership transfer and early years===

Century 21 Center, Inc. ran into financial difficulties in late 1964, with $2 million in outstanding debt ($ in dollars), and began negotiating a takeover of all fairground operations by the city government, which already owned the Seattle Center property. As part of cost-saving measures, in October 1964 monorail ticket booths were eliminated and replaced with onboard attendants to take fares. Century 21 Center offered to sell the monorail to the city government for $600,000 ($ in dollars) as part of resolving its debts to the city and entering liquidation. Lacking an operating franchise, the corporation&#x27;s liquidation trustees declined to take the title of the monorail system in December, and elected not to pay $200,000 for demolition. Negotiations continued for several months until the city government agreed in April to terminate its contracts with Century 21 and take over the fairground facilities. The monorail was transferred to the city government in May at a cost of $775,150 ($ in dollars), of which $414,128 ($ in dollars) was in the form of debt forgiveness.

The Seattle Center reopened for the summer season on June 1, 1965, with monorail fares lowered the following day to 25 cents for adults on a one-way trip to attract more patrons. The monorail&#x27;s operating hours were extended to midnight on weekdays and Saturdays, and ridership in the first week of June doubled compared to the prior year. A group of property owners along the monorail route sued the city government in 1965 over the loss of views and other livability concerns stemming from the construction of the line. The city settled the lawsuit in 1968 at a cost of $776,249 ($ in dollars) for light and air easements on 82 parcels of property.

By the end of the 1960s, the monorail was averaging 10,000 passengers on weekdays and 14,000 on weekends during the peak summer season. The Seattle Transit System remained the contracted operator of the monorail until January 1, 1973, when the Municipality of Metropolitan Seattle (Metro Transit) absorbed it to form a countywide transit system. The Seattle city government retained ownership of the monorail and awarded an operating contract to Metro Transit using funding from the Seattle Center department. Under Metro Transit, the monorail vehicles were renumbered 6201 and 6202 and given a new paint scheme in 1978, including the repainting of the red train to the green train. The arrival of a traveling exhibition with artifacts from the tomb of Pharaoh Tutankhamun at the Seattle Center spurred the repainting. The exhibition caused a surge in monorail ridership, which reached 2.8 million in 1978.

===Renovations and preservation===
The southern terminus at Westlake Mall was originally a large station that straddled Pine Street along a section of Westlake Avenue that had been converted into a public plaza. The terminal had a sloped moving walkway between street level and the three elevated platforms covered by a &quot;scalloped&quot; roof. The plaza at Westlake Mall was sought as the location of an expanded downtown park, leading to a major renovation of the monorail terminal that began in January 1968 and completed in April 1968. Reduced monorail service continued while the terminal was shrunk with the removal of the outer platforms deemed unnecessary for post-fair demand and the replacement of the roof with a simpler design. An emergency repair to the Westlake terminal was made in 1974 at a cost of $100,000 to replace metal shields that caught debris dropped by passengers on the platform.

A larger renovation was completed in 1988 to accommodate the downtown park, later named Westlake Park, and the adjacent Westlake Center shopping mall and office complex. The old terminal had been viewed as a &quot;blight&quot; on the area, which the city government sought for redevelopment as the center of Downtown Seattle&#x27;s retail core beginning in the late 1960s. The city considered several proposals for a shopping mall on the block on the north side of Pine Street in the 1970s, including hotels, movie theaters, a potential home for the Seattle Art Museum, and a new monorail terminal, but they were never realized. After several years of litigation led by preservation activists, a new proposal from The Rouse Company and a local developer was approved for construction in late 1985.

The new proposal included demolition of the monorail terminal to make way for a public park, while trains would terminate at a new station integrated into the shopping mall. The relocation of the station was initially rejected in 1985 after engineers had discovered that the monorail tracks would require significant reconstruction to make the necessary turn into the station. The city government proposed moving the columns onto the sidewalk on 5th Avenue instead and creating a gauntlet track, which would prevent the two trains from using the Westlake terminal at the same time. City councilmember George Benson suggested using a retractable ramp to access the outer track. A temporary station would be used during mall construction to allow the monorail to continue operations. The monorail relocation project was estimated to cost $19 million ($ in dollars) with heavy reliance on a federal grant that was initially denied by the Urban Mass Transportation Administration. The city considered several options, including running a single train, selling the system to Tacoma or demolishing the monorail entirely. In March 1986, it chose to keep the system and spend $2.7 million ($ in dollars) on the initial planning for the station overhaul and other renovations.

The federal government awarded a $5.6 million grant ($ in dollars) for the relocation project in late July, two months after construction began on a temporary terminal at 5th Avenue and Stewart Street. The old terminal at Westlake Mall closed permanently on September 1, 1986, and was demolished over the following two months. The temporary terminal and its platform opened on September 17, 1986, allowing monorail service to resume after a two-week suspension. It was built one block to the north at Stewart Street, next to the western track, and only served the blue train. The city council finalized a $7 million spending package ($ in dollars) in March 1987 to construct the permanent terminal, which would begin after work on Pine Street for the Downtown Seattle Transit Tunnel advanced beyond the excavation stage.

The monorail project included improvements to the electrical systems and an expansion of the Seattle Center terminal, and work on the two trains. An extensive interior refurbishment was cut after the monorail project trended $1.7 million above budget ($ in dollars), and was later reduced to new paneling and floorboards. The Westlake Center shopping mall was opened to the public on October 20, 1988, with the new monorail terminal on the third floor used temporarily for one day before it closed for additional construction. Several days before the scheduled opening, engineers discovered the west track was too close to the platform and mall building, preventing its use. The discovery was made when a retractable boarding ramp at the terminal scratched the blue train during a test run; a hinge pin that failed to fold properly was identified as the cause for the misalignment. The ramp was fixed in November, but other technical glitches and extended safety testing delayed the opening of the new terminal station for four months. The new Westlake Center monorail terminal opened on February 25, 1989, alongside the return of the red train to service.

In 1994, a private company replaced Metro Transit (later King County Metro) and the Seattle Center as the monorail&#x27;s operator, signing a ten-year contract with the city. Metro had previously provided drivers and maintained the trains, while the Seattle Center employed ticket-takers and janitorial staff. Near the northern end of the line, the Experience Music Project building (now the Museum of Pop Culture) was constructed over the monorail tracks from 1998 to 2000. The building was designed so that the tracks would pass through a valley at the center of the structure, with windows from the exhibit spaces facing the guideway. The monorail tracks and vehicles were declared a historic landmark by the Seattle Landmarks Preservation Board in April 2003 amid plans to demolish or replace the line as part of a citywide monorail expansion. In July, the city council passed the landmark ordinance to provide protections to the two Alweg trains, but excluded the guideway to support its reuse for the expansion project.

The monorail began a long-term closure on March 16, 2020 due to decreased demand amid the COVID-19 pandemic in the Seattle area. It reopened on May 28 with limited service and suspension of cash ticket sales, but was closed again over the weekend because of protest activity in Downtown Seattle. Ridership in 2020 declined to 300,000 total, approximately 15 percent of the 2019 total.

===Station expansions===

The monorail was integrated into the regional fare system in October 2019 with the acceptance of mobile tickets and later the ORCA card. As part of preparations for the opening of Climate Pledge Arena in 2021 at the renovated KeyArena for a National Hockey League team (later named the Seattle Kraken), Seattle Monorail Services announced a renovation of the monorail terminals in February 2020 to handle larger crowds. The Westlake Center terminal was to be expanded to accommodate 6,000 people per hour with new fare gates and ticket vending machines for ORCA cards and tickets. The NHL team would also fund free transit passes for attendees before and after games to reduce the number of car trips to the arena. A proposed second phase of the expansion program would have included a covered walkway and second entrance at the Westlake Center terminal with access from the Pine Street plaza and the transit tunnel station, but it was later abandoned. NHL Seattle, the Kraken&#x27;s ownership group, also announced that it would purchase a 50 percent stake in Seattle Monorail Services.

Construction on the remodeled stations began in April 2021 with the demolition of the station interiors, which required a full suspension of monorail service for several weeks. Another month-long closure began in September to finish construction of the expanded Westlake terminal ahead of the first arena events in late October. The monorail reopened on October 11, 2021, with work completed on the renovated Westlake Center terminal, which is planned to handle up to 3,000 passengers per hour during events. The project was primarily funded by $6.6 million in private spending and a $5.5 million grant from the Federal Transit Administration. The Seattle Center terminal is planned to be renovated at a later date.

Since the opening of Climate Pledge Arena, monorail ridership has recovered to its pre-pandemic levels with more use outside of the peak tourist season. On June 29, 2023, a set of 16 monorail columns on 5th Avenue between Olive Way and Vine Street were painted with portraits of Major League Baseball (MLB) players and local sports fans. The murals by artist Brady Black were commissioned by tourism agency Visit Seattle to celebrate the 2023 MLB All-Star Game, which Seattle hosted in July. Black and several volunteers painted the portraits onto mural cloth and transferred them to vinyl to be installed by crane on the columns. An additional 14 columns were decorated in 2024 with linocut artwork from local students that depict local events and attractions in Seattle.

==Expansion proposals==

The monorail has been the subject of several expansion proposals, with the primary goal of expanding it into a citywide rapid transit system. In 1961, businessman Ben B. Ehrlichman proposed that the then-unfinished monorail be extended north to Alderwood Manor or Mountlake Terrace and south towards Seattle–Tacoma International Airport, Kent, and Renton. The initial system would have cost $60 million ($ in dollars), while a second line serving the Eastside region would be built separately using a new floating bridge. Former Seattle Transit System manager Marmion D. Mills proposed his own monorail system in 1963 that would connect Seattle to Mountlake Terrace, Kent and the airport. Mills argued that a conventional subway system would be too expensive for Seattle and that the other alternative would be an expanded freeway network.

The Forward Thrust program included a ballot measure that would build a conventional rapid transit system serving King County with federal funding, but voters rejected it in 1968 and 1970. The designers of the rapid transit proposal considered extending the monorail across a regional network, but found it would not have the capacity or flexibility provided by conventional trains. In 1976, ABAM Engineers drew up a regional monorail plan for the Puget Sound Council of Governments, the regional planning authority. The firm, which designed the Walt Disney World Monorail System in Florida and several automated people mover systems for U.S. airports, envisioned an network with 41 stations and 700 monorail vehicles that would cost $500 million to build ($ in dollars). The PSCOG did not submit the proposal for further consideration.

The city government announced its own plan in 1970 to extend the monorail to a parking garage on Mercer Street near the site of a proposed stadium, but it was shelved after a different site was chosen for the stadium. The Seattle city government commissioned a new study in 1979 to examine improvements to the monorail system, including a closed loop around the Seattle Center campus and an infill station in the Denny Regrade neighborhood. A full conversion into an automated people mover with smaller vehicles was also studied as part of the improvement program. The 1970s energy crisis and subsequent availability of federal funding for transit projects sparked a revived interest in the monorail, but the Urban Mass Transit Administration rejected the Seattle proposals.

===ETC and Seattle Monorail Project===
The Regional Transit Authority (later Sound Transit) was formed in 1993 to create a regional light rail plan that was ratified by voters in November 1996. Taxi driver Dick Falkenbury conceived a separate proposal in 1996 to build a citywide monorail system and submitted a ballot initiative after a signature-gathering campaign. Falkenbury&#x27;s proposal envisioned an X-shaped system with service from Downtown Seattle to Ballard, Lake City, the Rainier Valley, and West Seattle, which would cost $850 million to construct ($ in dollars). 53 percent of voters approved the monorail plan, named Initiative 41, in a general election on November 4, 1997, creating the Elevated Transportation Company (ETC) to seek financing.

The city government appointed a board for the ETC (later renamed the Seattle Monorail Project) and funded early planning work, but did not agree to fund a $4 million feasibility study in 2000. The original monorail initiative was repealed and replaced by a new plan approved by voters in November 2000, which included $6 million for a study. The first corridor, the &quot;Green Line&quot; from West Seattle to Ballard, was estimated to cost $1.75 billion; a motor vehicle excise tax would fund it. The tax was adopted through a ballot measure that voters narrowly approved in the November 2002 election, creating the Seattle Popular Monorail Authority to manage the program.

The monorail project initially attracted two bids led by Hitachi and Bombardier, but both pulled out in April 2004 over cost concerns and the availability of local contractors. The project was stymied by tax revenue that was lower than expected and design changes to keep construction costs within the proposed budget and open by 2009—a two-year delay from the original plan. A recall measure on the November 2004 ballot aimed to prevent monorail construction, but voters rejected it, allowing the expansion project to continue. The monorail operator reached a tentative agreement with Cascadia Monorail to build the system in June 2005 but had not published the full financial analysis required by the city government before construction was permitted to begin. A revised cost estimate of $11 billion, including debt payments until 2050, was unveiled later that month and withdrawn by the Seattle Monorail Project after public criticism from elected officials.

The monorail project, including a $4.9 billion financing plan for a line, was abandoned after a fifth ballot initiative in November 2005, when 64 percent of voters rejected it. The Seattle Monorail Project was formally dissolved in January 2008, having spent $124.7 million on planning and property acquisition. The &quot;Green Line&quot; corridor from West Seattle to Ballard was later included as a light rail project in the Sound Transit 3 ballot measure, which was passed by voters in 2016. The light rail line, scheduled to open in the 2030s, incorporated some elements from the monorail plan into its early project feasibility studies.

==Accidents and incidents==
On October 20, 1962, the penultimate day of the Century 21 Exposition, the red train struck a bumper stop at the Westlake terminal—the first accident on the monorail system. None of the 400 passengers were injured, but the train&#x27;s window and nose were damaged, requiring a patch and two hours of repairs before returning to service. The red train was damaged in a similar manner on August 14, 1963, striking the Westlake terminal&#x27;s bumper while on a test run after the first set of brakes failed.

The first major accident involving the monorail occurred on July 25, 1971, when a brake failure on the red train caused it to strike a girder at the end of the track in the Seattle Center terminal. The train struck the girder at , injuring 26 of 40 passengers. The red train was lifted off the track and moved to a Seattle Transit System maintenance facility in August for a complete rebuild of the front car at a cost of $100,000 (equivalent to $ in dollars). This was completed in June 1973 with the help of translated blueprints from Alwac. One maintenance worker was killed during the repairs after falling into a pit under the vehicle.

A similar incident on the blue train occurred on May 21, 1979, injuring 15 people at the Seattle Center terminal. The monorail&#x27;s brake system was not found to be at fault, but the disabling of the onboard speed control system was criticized by city officials. The monorail struck a bumper at the temporary downtown terminal on August 27, 1987, causing no injuries but breaking the glass window, which fell onto a parked car below. The incident was later blamed on driver error.

On May 31, 2004, a fire broke out on the blue train as it passed through the Experience Music Project with 150 people aboard; eight suffered minor injuries. Passengers were evacuated using ladders deployed by the Seattle Fire Department to the red train, which traveled back to the Seattle Center terminal. The fire was determined to have been caused by a snapped drive shaft that damaged a collector shoe, which began to short circuit. The electric current melted through the shoe&#x27;s aluminum housing and arced, causing sparks that ignited the undercarriage&#x27;s grease and oil, creating a fire that entered the interior and ignited the seat cushions. The red train re-entered service on December 16, while the blue train returned on May 2, 2005, after extensive repairs.

The two monorail trains clipped one another on the curve above 5th Avenue and Olive Way near the Westlake Center terminal on November 26, 2005, at around 7:10 p.m. The southbound blue train&#x27;s driver caused the collision when they failed to yield while entering a gauntlet track north of Westlake created by the 1988 renovation. The two trains carried 84 passengers who were evacuated using firetruck ladders, including two people hospitalized with minor injuries. Within a week, the trains were separated and towed via crane to the Seattle Center terminal to undergo extensive repairs that cost $4.64 million ($ in dollars), funded through an insurance payout and contributions from the federal government and the private monorail operator. Instead of using a traditional contractor, the Seattle Opera props department constructed a new set of nine aluminum doors—eight for the red train and one for the blue train—at their Renton warehouse. The monorail was expected to resume service on July 18, 2006, but problems found during last minute testing delayed the resumption of service to August 11.

On July 31, 2023, a male 14-year-old from Phoenix, Arizona, was fatally struck by the monorail near the intersection of 5th Avenue and Denny Way around 9:00p.m. According to the Seattle Police Department, security footage showed he had been tagging an adjacent building from a roof when he was struck, which caused him to fall.

==Popular culture==

Along with the Space Needle, the Seattle Center Monorail is considered an iconic landmark of the city of Seattle and is among the most popular tourist attractions in the state. It was featured in the 1963 musical film &quot;It Happened at the World&#x27;s Fair&quot;, which starred Elvis Presley and was filmed during the Century 21 Exposition. The monorail and Space Needle were depicted on the cover of &quot;Life&quot; magazine and on commemorative stamps and coins issued during the world&#x27;s fair in 1962. The Monorail Espresso coffeehouse was named in honor of the monorail and originally began under the Westlake terminal in 1980 as the first downtown coffee cart.

<text>Wolf Bickel (born 6 July 1942, Bensberg) is a German amateur astronomer and a prolific discoverer of asteroids, observing at his private Bergisch Gladbach Observatory, Germany. He is the most successful German discoverer of minor planets.

== Biography ==

Bickel studied electrical engineering at RWTH Aachen University and finished his studies in 1969. He became enthusiastic about astronomy, when he received a celestial chart and Galilean binoculars as a gift from his grandmother at the age of 16. Bickel began to grind parabolic mirrors to build his own telescopes. In 1995, he built a 0.6-meter aperture telescope and discovered his first minor planet, the main-belt asteroid the same year. He still uses this self-made telescope as of today.

He lives in Bergisch Gladbach, in the Cologne–Bonn Region of North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany. The Minor Planet Center confused Bickel&#x27;s home town with the location of his observatory, which is located 30 kilometers from his place of residence. Bickel named 12564 Ikeller an asteroid of the Koronis family, and his one and only named discovery after his wife, Ingeborg Bickel–Keller (b. 1941).

== Honors and awards ==

The 12-kilometer sized asteroid 4324 Bickel, discovered by American astronomer Laurence Taff in 1981, was named in his honor.

== Minor planet discoveries ==

=== Official MPC discoveries ===

As of 2017, he is credited by the Minor Planet Center (MPC) with the discovery of 665 numbered minor planets during 1995–2010.

=== Comparison with German discoverers ===

In terms of total discoveries, Bickel is the most successful German discoverer of asteroids, ahead of (professional) astronomer Freimut Börngen and the first amateur astronomer to claim this honor in more than 150 years. The comparison was published by Erwin Schwab in the journal of the German astronomical society &quot;Vereinigung der Sternfreunde&quot; in 2013, and applies a different metric than used by the MPC.

<text>Jana Tichá (born 1965 in České Budějovice) is a Czech astronomer and discoverer of minor planets. She studied at the University of Economics in Prague and graduated in 1987. In 1992 she was selected for the position of a director of the Kleť Observatory.

She specializes in discoveries of asteroids and comets especially near-Earth objects (NEOs). The Minor Planet Center credits her with the discovery of 104 numbered minor planets during 1995–2003. She is the chair of the IAU Committee on Small Body Nomenclature (CSBN), which is responsible for approving names of asteroids. She works together with her husband Miloš Tichý at Kleť.

In her country she is also well known for her popularization activities. She is major contributor to the Czech web servers about asteroids and comets.

On 3 May 1996 the asteroid 5757 Tichá was named in her honour (), while she named her discovery, the main-belt asteroid 8307 Peltan, after several members of her family.

<text>Beagle Aircraft Limited was a British light aircraft manufacturer. The company produced the Airedale, Terrier, Beagle 206, Husky and the Pup. It had factories at Rearsby in Leicestershire and Shoreham in Sussex. The company was dissolved in 1969.

==History==
The British Executive &amp; General Aviation Limited (trading as BEAGLE) was formed in 1960 when Peter Masefield left his post as Managing Director of Bristol Aircraft when that company was merged with others to form British Aircraft Corporation. His intention was to set up a company to design and produce a range of light aircraft, and he persuaded the Pressed Steel Company to invest in this project. An aircraft design office was created at Shoreham to design the Beagle 206, which was intended to be the company&#x27;s flagship product.

Beagle took over two separate aircraft manufacturers, Auster Aircraft Company of Rearsby, Leicestershire and F.G Miles Limited of Shoreham, Sussex, both of which also had design offices. Initially the arrangement with F.G Miles was a &quot;technical association&quot; as Fred Miles had no intention of selling out to Beagle but eventually George Miles was appointed Technical Director for the Beagle Group and F.G Miles was a director of Beagle-Miles, with a formal takeover being completed in February 1961.

Initially the three parts of the company operated independently, the Rearsby factory as Beagle-Auster Limited and the Shoreham factory as Beagle-Miles Limited. This did not last long and the three parts of the company were merged as Beagle Aircraft Limited in 1962.

The company lacked direction from the start, with poor strategic decisions made based on over-optimistic predictions while projects were delayed and costs spiralled. Masefield had a vision of producing large numbers, possibly between 400 and 1000 aircraft per year, of many different types of light aircraft. At the same time he was wildly optimistic about the ease of producing such numbers, seemingly ignoring the costs involved. The Miles brothers had the view that Masefield was &quot;intent on creating an organisation out of all proportion to what it was trying to achieve&quot;. The decision to build the Airedale and Terrier as &quot;interim&quot; aircraft was a costly error; by March 1962 it had cost £511,000 to produce the first 25 Airedales, which sold with difficulty for a basic price of £5,500 each, with a predicted break-even figure of over 600 sales.

In 1962 a net loss of £2.1 million was recorded and Pressed Steel had already given thought to pulling out. In July 1963, George Miles resigned, saying &quot;Manufacturing plans and policies have been wild and chaotic. The present situation ... is obviously hopelessly uneconomic.&quot; In 1965 the parent company Pressed Steel was acquired by the British Motor Corporation, who reviewed the involvement in light aircraft manufacturing and requested financial help from the British Government. The British government bought Beagle in December 1966 and provided the help needed. When the company needed more financial help in 1969, the Government put the company into receivership amidst much Parliamentary recrimination. The Receiver tried to revive and sell the company (now renamed Beagle Aircraft (1969) Limited), but failed and the company assets were disposed of by the liquidator.

==Aircraft==
The Beagle 206 was a twin piston-engined design evolved from the Bristol 220 project which Peter Masefield had tried to persuade Bristol Aircraft to make. When he left Bristols he bought the design rights to form the foundation of Beagle as it was expected that up to 120 would be ordered by the RAF. However, the RAF specification changed continually as did the required number of aircraft and the ultimate order was only for 20 aircraft at the unit price that Beagle had given for 30 aircraft. Owing to the change in the RAF specification, the first Beagle 206 (designed by the Miles team in 82,500 man-hours) was then redesigned and &quot;productionised&quot; by the Beagle design office at Shoreham (in an additional 150,000 man-hours of design). The Beagle 206 was only made in small numbers from 1961 to 1969; this was to have been the company&#x27;s flagship aircraft but sales were always difficult - 79 were flown and several were unsold at the time of liquidation.

The first aircraft made by Beagle were developed from Auster designs: the Airedale, Terrier and D5/180 Husky. The Airedale and Terrier were intended as stop-gap designs to keep production shops busy and to be sold whilst more modern designs were developed However, Beagle lost almost £500,000 on the Airedale, due to its old design, poor performance and high cost; the Terrier was also not profitable, due to the extensive number of man-hours in conversion and, again, the age of the design. The Beagle Husky was made in very small numbers and each was sold at a significant loss, while the Beagle Mark Eleven project was another expensive sideline. In 1968, the Auster assets (including all spares, jigs and partly completed airframes) were sold to Hants and Sussex Aviation in order to make room for the production of the Pup.

In 1967 the single-engined Beagle Pup made its first flight and was made and sold in greater numbers until the company&#x27;s bankruptcy. The receiver sold a number of incomplete Pup aircraft which were then completed by other companies. At the time of the company&#x27;s bankruptcy in 1969, the military Bulldog was being developed from the Pup by Beagle; Bulldog production was then completed by Scottish Aviation at their Prestwick factory following the demise of the Beagle Aircraft company. At the turn of the 21st Century, many Bulldogs were being sold by air forces to civilian operators, in much the same way that Austers were transferred from Army or RAF squadrons during the 1940s and 1950s.

<doc id="760439" wikidata="Q2295608" url="?curid=760439" title="1958 Atlantic hurricane season">
<text>The 1958 Atlantic hurricane season included every tropical cyclone either affecting or threatening land. There were ten named storms as well as one pre-season tropical storm. Seven of the storms became hurricanes, including five that were major hurricanes, or the equivalent of a Category 3 on the Saffir-Simpson scale. The strongest storm was Hurricane Helene, which became a strong Category 4 hurricane with winds and a barometric pressure of while just offshore the southeastern United States. 

In May, a subtropical depression formed in the Caribbean and dropped heavy rainfall near Miami, Florida. The first named storm of the season was Alma, which killed three people and caused flooding in Texas. Hurricane Daisy in August was a major hurricane that paralleled the eastern coast of the United States, although due to its small size it did not cause much damage. Hurricane Ella affected much of the northern Caribbean and Texas, most significantly the Dominican Republic where 30 people died. Ella also killed six people in Cuba, where it made landfall as a major hurricane. A few weeks later, Tropical Storm Gerda also struck the Dominican Republic and killed three people. The costliest storm of the season was Helene, which caused $11.2 million in damage (1958 USD), mostly in North Carolina. Although it passed within of the state, its effects were mostly limited to the coast, and the hurricane killed one person. The last storm of the season, Janice, killed eight people in Jamaica when its precursor dropped of rainfall, and one person was killed in the Bahamas.

== Season summary ==

The ten tropical storms during the season is comparable to the 20 year average of ten. In contrast to the previous season when most storms were in the Gulf of Mexico, most storms in 1958 occurred over the western Atlantic Ocean. The first storm, Alma, formed in the middle of June. Subsequently, a trough persisted along the eastern United States, which suppressed tropical cyclone formation. Conditions remained unfavorable in July due to a large ridge suppressing the westerlies. In August, a persistent trough caused three storms – Becky, Cleo, and Daisy – to recurve and remain over the ocean. Most storms formed from the middle of August through the middle of October, when polar air reached as far south as Florida due to a shift in the ridge.

Before the season started, the United States Weather Bureau office in Miami began setting up a teleprinter to distribute hourly advisories to newspapers and the American Red Cross. The hurricane season officially began on June 15, and lasted until November 15. When the season started, the Lakeland Frost Warning Service sent four employees to assist the Miami Weather Bureau. The Hurricane Hunters flew daily to investigate potential storms in the Atlantic Ocean and Gulf of Mexico. In addition, there was a set of radars from Texas to Maine to track storms. Beginning in 1958, the Weather Bureau predicted the change in tide due to a storm with the assistance of a tide specialist. During the season, a reporter – daughter of Weather Bureau director Gordon Dunn – flew into Hurricane Daisy, becoming the first woman to fly into a hurricane. Utilizing radars along the East Coast of the United States, the Weather Bureau tracked both Hurricanes Daisy and Helene for , which was the first such occurrence of that feat.

The season&#x27;s activity was reflected with a cumulative accumulated cyclone energy (ACE) rating of 121. ACE, broadly speaking, is a measure of the power of the hurricane multiplied by the length of time it existed, so storms that last a long time, as well as particularly strong hurricanes, have high values. ACE is only calculated for full advisories on tropical systems at or exceeding or tropical storm strength.

== Systems ==
=== Unnamed May tropical storm ===
A small circulation crossed Panama from the Pacific Ocean on May 17, and by the following day it was a developing depression near San Andrés in the western Caribbean. The system gradually organized over warm waters while moving to the northwest, developing a well-defined low pressure area by May 23 as it approached western Cuba. Later that day, the depression crossed the western portion of the island before turning to the northeast. On May 24, the system passed southeast of Florida, dropping heavy rainfall that peaked at in Homestead. May 1958 was the second wettest May since 1911, of which half of the precipitation fell during the depression. Several other locations in the Miami area reported record or near-record rainfall for the month. The high rainfall disrupted planting of vegetables, and there was some crop damage. Flooding entered homes and businesses, forcing some evacuations. About 2,900 people lost telephone service, and there was a brief water outage on Key Biscayne. There were also hundreds of vehicle accidents related to the storm.

After affecting Florida, the depression continued to the northeast, and although it had a warm core, it was not able to develop significantly due to lack of temperature instability, as well as another low developing southwest of the circulation. The depression was briefly forecast to strike North Carolina, but instead an eastward moving ridge kept it offshore. In Hatteras, North Carolina, the depression dropped of rainfall. The influx of cold air transitioned the depression to an extratropical cyclone on May 28. An approaching cold front absorbed the depression and produced heavy rainfall in eastern Canada.
=== Tropical Storm Alma ===

A tropical wave was first observed in the central Caribbean Sea on June 9. By the following day, there was evidence of a weak closed circulation off the south coast of Jamaica. Moving generally westward, on June 12 it crossed the Yucatán Peninsula, and the system emerged into the Bay of Campeche the next day. On June 14, a tropical depression formed about halfway between the Yucatán Peninsula and Tamaulipas. Within six hours, the depression intensified into Tropical Storm Alma about east of Tampico. Later that day, a ship reported a pressure of and high seas, and early on June 15 a United States Coast Guard plane measured winds of near the northeast Mexican coast. That day, Alma made landfall about south of Brownsville, Texas, in northeastern Mexico. The storm moved ashore in northeastern Tamaulipas early on June 15 before crossing into southern Texas. After weakening to a tropical depression, Alma straddled the Rio Grande before dissipating in western Texas late on June 16.

The United States Coast Guard recommended people to evacuate in beach areas near Brownsville, Texas. As it moved ashore, Alma produced a high tide of along Padre Island, and one person drowned near Galveston due to heavy surf. The highest wind gust was at Port Isabel, causing minor damage. However, Alma dropped heavy rainfall further inland, reaching about near Medina. The rains caused floods that resulted in heavy damage to property and crops. Some rivers and streams rose above their banks due to floods, creating torrents of up to in some arroyos. The floods covered highways and forced about 100 people to evacuate near Sabinal. The rains also knocked out telephone lines in Uvalde County, and temporarily trapped hundreds of scouts. One person drowned along the Concho River, and three people overall died due to the system.
=== Tropical Storm Becky ===
Based on reports from the Cape Verde islands offshore Africa, it is estimated a tropical depression developed on August 8. It moved westward due to the subtropical ridge to its north, a motion the depression would continue for much of its duration. Nearby ship reports indicated gradual strengthening, and the depression became a tropical storm on August 11. At 0400 UTC on August 12, the San Juan Weather Bureau office initiated advisories on Tropical Storm Becky about halfway between the Lesser Antilles and Cape Verde. That day, the Hurricane Hunters flew into the storm, reporting a pressure of and flight level winds of ; its peak surface winds were estimated at . Also on August 12, a storm warning was issued for the northern Leeward Islands, and a storm watch was issued for the United States Virgin Islands and northern Puerto Rico.

After peaking in intensity, Becky continued quickly to the west-northwest, and its fast motion may have prevented further strengthening. On August 14, a flight reported hurricane-force wind gusts in rainbands east-northeast of the center. The next day, the circulation became poorly defined, and by August 16, Becky had become extratropical after it merged with an approaching cold front. The storm turned to the north and northeast, dissipating later on August 17. As Becky was transitioning into an extratropical storm, it produced high waves along the southeastern coast of the United States.
=== Hurricane Cleo ===

A well-developed tropical wave spawned a tropical storm on August 11 to the south of Cape Verde. It moved westward, and ships in the area indicated that it had a large circulation. The Hurricane Hunters flew into the system and observed a well-developed hurricane with winds of , which were the highest measured winds. As a result, the San Juan Weather Bureau Office initiated advisories on Hurricane Cleo and issued a hurricane watch for the Lesser Antilles. Subsequent analysis determined that Cleo became a hurricane on August 13. A weak trough near 50° W allowed the hurricane to turn to the north, and Cleo continued to intensify, based on improved definition of the eye on radar imagery. A flight into the storm late on August 16 indicated a pressure of with winds of early on August 16. Originally winds were thought to be higher in Cleo, at , which would make it a Category 5 hurricane, but reanalysis later on determined it to be weaker.

After maintaining peak winds for about six hours, Cleo began weakening. It turned more to the northwest due to a strengthening ridge to the northeast and the hurricane&#x27;s outflow weakening the trough. An approaching cold front turned Cleo to the northeast on August 18 and caused it to accelerate. That day, it passed about east of Bermuda. On August 20, the hurricane became extratropical to the southeast of Newfoundland. In St. John&#x27;s, the storm dropped about of rainfall. The remnants of Cleo turned to the east and east-southeast, dissipating on August 22 between the Azores and mainland Portugal.
=== Hurricane Daisy ===

A tropical wave moved through the Lesser Antilles on August 20 and gradually spread north. On August 24, a nearby ship reported a low pressure area and strong winds, indicating the formation of a small tropical cyclone near the Bahamas. After a Hurricane Hunters flight indicated winds of , the Weather Bureau initiated advisories on Tropical Storm Daisy early on August 25 to the north of the Bahamas. That day it became a hurricane, and initially it moved slowly to the northwest due to a ridge to the northeast. On August 26, a trough turned Daisy to the northeast, and the hurricane continued to intensify due to an anticyclone aloft. By early August 28, the hurricane reached peak winds of , and a minimum pressure of while offshore South Carolina. Daisy accelerated to the north, passing about east of Hatteras, North Carolina; there, gusts peaked at due to the storm&#x27;s small size.

For much of its duration, Hurricane Daisy was visible from radar along the eastern United States, which assisted in tracking the storm. Passing east of Hatteras, Daisy dropped moderate rainfall, peaking at near Morehead City, North Carolina, before turning to the northeast on August 29. The Weather Bureau issued a hurricane warning from Block Island to Provincetown, Massachusetts, due to the projected path near New England. Later on August 29, Daisy passed about southeast of Nantucket. Nearby Block Island reported peak gusts of , and a Texas Tower east of Cape Cod reported gusts to . The storm also produced high tides and light rainfall, and forced 600 people to evacuate Nantucket. Due to its small size, there was no major damage in the United States. After affecting Nantucket, Daisy weakened and became extratropical by early on August 30. The remnants turned to the east, passing south of Nova Scotia before dissipating on August 31. In Canada, the storm damaged a boat in the Bay of Fundy that drifted for two days until reaching Saint John, New Brunswick.
=== Hurricane Ella ===
A tropical wave spawned a tropical depression near the Lesser Antilles on August 30, which quickly became Tropical Storm Ella. It quickly intensified in the eastern Caribbean into a hurricane by August 31 while passing south of Puerto Rico; there, the outer rainbands caused some flooding that caused minor damage. On September 1, Ella strengthened to winds of , as measured by the Hurricane Hunters. At that intensity, the hurricane passed just south of the Dominican Republic before making landfall in southwestern Haiti. In the Dominican Republic, heavy rainfall and floods caused $100,000 in damage, mostly in the country&#x27;s southwestern portion. Heavy rainfall caused widespread flooding in southwestern Haiti, and thousands of people became homeless after their houses were damaged. Near Les Cayes, 30 people were killed due to flash flooding.

After affecting Haiti, Ella weakened to a Category 1 hurricane before moving ashore in southeastern Cuba early on September 2. While traversing the island, Ella weakened to a tropical storm and was unable to restrengthen. Near Santiago de Cuba, the Bayamo River washed away 25 houses and killed five people. One other person died in the country due to the hurricane. After Ella reached the Gulf of Mexico on September 3, its structure was disrupted, and it remained a tropical storm as it continued to the west-northwest. Its outer rainbands produced gusts of in Grand Isle, Louisiana. Ella struck Texas on September 6 and dissipated soon thereafter. At its final landfall, the storm produced of rainfall in Galveston, Texas, and in the city, one person died after falling overboard a boat.
=== Hurricane Fifi ===

A ship on September 4 indicated a tropical depression developed from a tropical wave to the east of the Lesser Antilles. The system initially had two circulations that consolidated into one by September 5. That day, Hurricane Hunters observed winds, which prompted the Weather Bureau to upgrade it to Tropical Storm Fifi. Due to the storm&#x27;s fast track to the northwest, a gale warning and hurricane watch were issued for the Leeward and northern Windward Islands. On September 6, Fifi intensified into a hurricane and reached peak winds of , around the same time that it passed about northeast of the Leeward Islands. Later, Fifi began weakening, and by September 8 it was downgraded to tropical storm status. The westerlies turned Fifi to the northeast on September 10. After passing southeast of Bermuda, the storm dissipated on September 11.
=== Tropical Storm Gerda ===

A tropical wave was first observed on September 11 about east of the Lesser Antilles. It moved westward, and based on surface reports from the island chain, a tropical depression developed west of Martinique on September 13. The system moved quickly to the west-northwest, becoming a tropical storm by late on September 13. The Hurricane Hunters encountered winds of on September 14 just offshore the Dominican Republic; on that basis the system was designated Tropical Storm Gerda. Shortly thereafter, the storm struck the Barahona peninsula. The high terrain of Hispaniola quickly weakened Gerda, and on September 15 the Hurricane Hunters could not detect a closed circulation. It is estimated that Gerda dissipated offshore southeastern Cuba. The wave continued west, later reaching the Gulf of Mexico. Aided by an approaching trough, a small low pressure area redeveloped on September 19, which struck southern Texas and moved to the northeast. This low eventually dissipated over Louisiana on September 22, having produced gusts of along the Texas coast.

When the precursor to Gerda passed through the Lesser Antilles, it dropped of rain. Stations in the United States Virgin Islands reported winds up to . The storm&#x27;s threat prompted gale warnings along the southern coast of Puerto Rico and the Dominican Republic. In the former island, Gerda killed three people. Two people drowned after falling off a boat on Vieques island, and the other died after his house collapsed while he was inside. The storm damaged coffee, banana, and plantain crops in Puerto Rico. Winds reached in the Dominican Republic.
=== Hurricane Helene ===
A tropical wave was first observed near Cape Verde on September 16. On September 21, the Hurricane Hunters observed a circulation, which indicated a tropical depression had formed east of the northern Leeward Islands. It moved to the west-northwest, becoming Tropical Storm Helene on September 23. The next day Helene became a hurricane, aided by an anticyclone aloft. It moved around a large ridge, bringing its center toward the southeastern United States. As the hurricane approached the Carolinas, the hurricane rapidly intensified as the eye became visible on radar, and Helene reached peak winds of on the morning of September 27. An approaching trough turned the hurricane to the northeast, and Helene came within of the coast of North Carolina. It slowly weakened, and at the same time its size expanded. On September 29, Helene became extratropical as it was moving over Newfoundland. The remnants continued to the northeast, later turning to the southeast and dissipating on October 4 just west of Great Britain.

While paralleling the southeastern United States, Helene produced a peak storm surge of near Marine Corps Air Station Cherry Point in North Carolina. A station in Wilmington reported sustained winds of and a peak gust of , exceeding the previous record for measured wind speed there by a wide margin. At Cape Fear, winds were estimated at , with gusts as high as . Rainfall from Helene peaked at in Wilmington International Airport, although rainfall spread as far north as New England. Damage in the United States totaled $11.2 million, and there was one indirect fatality. In Atlantic Canada, Helene produced high winds and heavy rainfall, causing power outages in Prince Edward Island and Cape Breton Island. A wharf in Caribou, Nova Scotia, was destroyed by rough seas generated by Helene, and at least 1,000 lobster traps were carried out to sea as a result.
=== Hurricane Ilsa ===

On September 24, ship reports near an area of disturbed weather east of the Lesser Antilles prompted a Hurricane Hunters flight. By the time the aircraft investigated the system, they discovered a tropical storm with winds of , which was named Ilsa by the Weather Bureau. Subsequent analysis estimated that the storm became a tropical depression earlier that day. Ilsa quickly intensified into a hurricane on September 25, by which time it was located about southeast of Hurricane Helene. Over the subsequent few days, the two hurricanes underwent the Fujiwhara effect, in which Ilsa turned to the north and Helene turned to the northeast. Ilsa quickly intensified on September 26, developing a well-defined eye and spiral rainbands. Early on September 27, it reached peak winds of , and subsequently it weakened. On September 29 the hurricane turned to the northeast and accelerated, becoming extratropical and dissipating by the next day.

Early in the duration of Ilsa, the Weather Bureau issued a gale warning and hurricane watch for the Leeward Islands, Virgin Islands, and northern Puerto Rico. However, no damage was reported. The storm caused extensive beach erosion and squally conditions in Bermuda.

=== Hurricane Janice ===

A tropical wave moved through the Lesser Antilles on September 30. It moved westward through the Caribbean, developing a broad circulation by October 3 as it approached Jamaica. The weak circulation gradually became better organized, developing into a tropical depression near the Cayman Islands on October 4. The system quickly intensified into Tropical Storm Janice as it moved toward the coast of Cuba. An eastward-moving cold front turned the storm to the north and northeast, and Janice crossed central Cuba early on October 6. The storm intensified while moving through the Bahamas, becoming a hurricane on October 7. Janice slowed that day and reached peak winds of . On October 9, the hurricane turned to the east-northeast, and by that time had weakened slightly; however, the next day it re-attained its previous peak intensity while passing northwest of Bermuda, reaching a minimum pressure of . On October 12, Janice became extratropical in the northern Atlantic Ocean, and the next day merged with a stronger non-tropical low offshore Atlantic Canada.

The precursor to Janice dropped heavy rainfall in Jamaica, reaching over in some locations. Rain-induced flooding destroyed homes, wrecked crops, and damaged coastal wharves and roads. Eight people were killed, and the floods were considered the worst in 25 years. When Janice was still over Cuba, the Weather Bureau issued gale warnings from Vero Beach, Florida, to Cape Hatteras, North Carolina. In the Bahamas, Janice produced peak winds of on San Salvador Island. In Nassau, one person was killed while trying to move a boat. A dredger was lost and a yacht was seriously damaged in the Bahamas, and damage in the country reached $200,000.
=== Unnamed October tropical storm ===

A low pressure area developed north of Hispaniola from a dissipating cold front, organizing into a tropical depression on October 15. The system moved to the north-northeast, attaining peak winds of , based on reports from ships. On October 17, the storm transitioned into an extratropical cyclone as it interacted with an approaching cold front. The storm continued northeastward, merging with a larger storm on October 19 to the south of Atlantic Canada.

<text>Zdeněk Moravec (born 1968) is a Czech astronomer and astrophysicist.

Zdeněk Moravec is a graduate from Charles University in Prague. He became a prolific discoverer of minor planets, during his stay at the Kleť Observatory in South Bohemia, Czech Republic, from 1992 to 2000. He is credited by the Minor Planet Center with a total of 93 discovered bodies (between 1994 and 1998), of which 65 were co-discoveries together with astronomer Miloš Tichý. In March 2008 they discovered the minor planet 17805 Švestka at the Kleť Observatory, which they named it in honor of solar physicist Zdeněk Švestka.

Since 2001, he teaches theoretic physics and computer modelling at Jan Evangelista Purkyně University in Ústí nad Labem, Czech Republic.

<text>Gowri Shankar (21 January 1954 – 27 April 1995), better known as &#x27;Auto&#x27; Shankar, was an Indian criminal, murderer and gangster from Tamil Nadu, who was active in Chennai throughout the 1970s and 1980s.

== Early and personal life ==
Shankar was born in Kangeyanallur near Vellore. While he was in PUC, his father left the family for Odisha. In the early 1970s, he came to Chennai, first living in a Mylapore slum before moving to the fast-developing area of Thiruvanmiyur on the outskirts of South Chennai. Shankar had several wives. He married his first wife, Jagadeeswari, early in his criminal career and had 4 children with her. The marriage ended due to her suicide by self-immolation. His third wife, Lalitha, was a performer at a cabaret club he frequented.

== Career ==
He survived by peddling cycle rickshaws, and later began to operate an auto rickshaw, from which he got his nickname. 

At the time, the area was a criminal hotbed and Shankar began transporting illegal liquor (prohibition being in force at the time), and Shankar soon realised that prostitution was more profitable with lower risks, due to its association with politically influential people who could keep the police in check. His gang eliminated rivals either through the police force or through murder. An incident in which a rival gangster named Babu was murdered in the early 1980s, and which was ultimately covered up led Shankar to focus more on prostitution.

Shankar&#x27;s third wife, Lalitha, ran off with a pimp and Shankar&#x27;s friend, Sudalaimuthu, and started their own outfit in the sex trade. An enraged Shankar planned his revenge by pretending to reconcile with the two through mutual friends. One night in October 1987, he invited her to one of his places in Periyar Nagar, then killed and buried her. He then rented the house to an old widow for Rs. 150. Shankar told Sudalai that Lalitha was on an all-India tour with a VIP, and two months later invited him for dinner. Shankar loaded Sudalai with liquor, strangled him, burned his body, and dumped his ashes in the sea. He then had the house renovated and explained away the burn marks by claiming they were roasted meat. When Sudalai&#x27;s friend Ravi confronted Shankar, Shankar killed him and buried him outside his Periyar Nagar plot. He claimed the burial was of illegal arrack that he was hiding from an upcoming police raid, and posted a false letter to his wife claiming Ravi was in fact in Mumbai.

By 1988, he had a multistorey house, cars, bikes, and connections that could do anything. On 29 May 1988, he and his gang were confronted by 3 members of a rival gang: Sampath, Mohan and Govindraj, who refused to pay for using his women and demanded protection money. Shankar invited them into his den, promising to pay them, and then beat them to death and buried them. At the end of June, Sampath&#x27;s wife Vijaya filed a complaint with Mylapore police that her husband was missing and Shankar could be responsible. She was advised to file a complaint with Thiruvanmiyur police instead, who arrested Shankar on charges of causing a nuisance and released him. Vijaya sent a petition to the governor, who ordered the police to investigate Shankar. However, the reluctant police told Vijaya to not bother them with complaints. A distraught Vijaya turned to her journalist neighbour, who published an article implying they might have been murdered.

==Trial==
The Inspector General ordered a special enquiry and the deaths of the three men were discovered. When they arrested Shankar and interrogated him, he confessed to the murders and to the other three murders he had committed. However, he escaped on 20 August 1990 with his five accomplices. Shankar&#x27;s trial was held at the Chengalpattu sessions court. He was sentenced to death along with two of his associates, Eldin and Shivaji, on 31 May 1991, ultimately being hanged in Salem Central Prison in 1995.

==Associates==
In 1992, Shankar&#x27;s five accomplices were sentenced to six months of Rigorous Imprisonment after having been found guilty by the Chengai-Anna District Judge N. Mohandoss. The accomplices were Shankar&#x27;s brother, Mohan, Selva (alias Selvaraj) and the jail wardens Kannan, Balan and Rahim Khan. They were found guilty of &quot;criminal conspiracy&quot; and &quot;resistance or obstruction by a person to his lawful apprehension&quot;.
Subsequently, Mohan was also found guilty of the six murders and was given three Mohan had escaped from the Chennai Central Prison in August 1990 and was captured in Pune on 25 June 1992.

==Responses==
K. Vijay Kumar, the Tamil Nadu Additional Director-General of Police, claimed that cinema was solely responsible for making Shankar a criminal. He mentioned this during a seminar on &quot;Crime and Media&quot; in Kerala.

The trial has become widely known across the nation since the Supreme Court invoked the American free speech doctrine and the case became oft-quoted in relation to journalistic exposés.

==In popular culture==
* The 1990 Tamil language film &quot;Pulan Visaranai&quot; directed by R. K. Selvamani was partially inspired by Auto Shankar&#x27;s crimes. Mithun Chakraborty and Shakti Kapoor starred in the 1995 Bollywood remake &quot;Ravan Raaj: A True Story&quot;.
* A documentary television series based on his life was aired on Makkal TV.
* &quot;Crime Patrol&quot; aired an episode on Sony TV based on the story of Auto Shankar.
* Appani Sarath played Auto Shankar in the 2019 ZEE5 web series &quot;Auto Shankar&quot;.
* This case was included as one of the cases in the bestselling book The Deadly Dozen: India&#x27;s Most Notorious Serial Killers by Anirban Bhattacharyya, the creator-producer of the hit TV show Savdhaan India

<text>Redbook is an American women&#x27;s magazine that is published by the Hearst magazine division. It is one of the &quot;Seven Sisters&quot;, a group of women&#x27;s service magazines. It ceased print publication after January 2019 and now operates exclusively online.

==History==

The magazine was first published in May 1903 as The Red Book Illustrated by Stumer, Rosenthal and Eckstein, a firm of Chicago retail merchants. The name was changed to The Red Book Magazine shortly thereafter. Its first editor, from 1903 to 1906, was Trumbull White, who wrote that the name was appropriate because, &quot;Red is the color of cheerfulness, of brightness, of gaiety.&quot; In its early years, the magazine published short fiction by well-known authors, including many women writers, along with photographs of popular actresses and other women of note. Within two years the magazine had become a success, climbing to a circulation of 300,000.

When White left to edit &quot;Appleton&#x27;s Magazine&quot;, he was replaced by Karl Edwin Harriman, who edited &quot;The Red Book Magazine&quot; and its sister publications &quot;The Blue Book&quot; and &quot;The Green Book&quot; until 1912. Under Harriman the magazine was promoted as &quot;the largest illustrated fiction magazine in the world&quot; and increased its price from 10 cents to 15 cents. According to Endres and Lueck (p. 299), &quot;&quot;Red Book&quot; was trying to convey the message that it offered something for everyone, and, indeed, it did... There was short fiction by talented writers such as James Oliver Curwood, Jack London, Sinclair Lewis, Edith Wharton and Hamlin Garland. Stories were about love, crime, mystery, politics, animals, adventure and history (especially the Old West and the Civil War).&quot;

Harriman was succeeded by Ray Long. When Long went on to edit Hearst&#x27;s &quot;Cosmopolitan&quot; in January 1918, Harriman returned as editor, bringing such coups as a series of &quot;Tarzan&quot; stories by Edgar Rice Burroughs. During this period the cover price was raised to 25 cents.

In 1927, Edwin Balmer, a short-story writer who had written for the magazine, took over as editor; in the summer of 1929 the magazine was bought by McCall Corporation, which changed the name to Redbook but kept Balmer on as editor. He published stories by such writers as Booth Tarkington and F. Scott Fitzgerald, nonfiction by women such as Shirley Temple&#x27;s mother and Eleanor Roosevelt, articles on the Wall Street Crash of 1929 by men like Cornelius Vanderbilt and Eddie Cantor, as well as condensed novels, like Dashiell Hammett&#x27;s &quot;The Thin Man&quot; (December 1933). Under Balmer, &quot;Redbook&quot; became a general-interest magazine for both men and women.

On May 26, 1932, the publisher launched its own radio series, &quot;Redbook Magazine Radio Dramas&quot;, syndicated dramatizations of stories from the magazine. Stories were selected by Balmer, who also served as the program&#x27;s host.

Circulation hit a million in 1937, and success continued until the late 1940s, when the rise of television began to drain readers and the magazine lost touch with its demographic. In 1948 it lost $400,000 (equivalent to $ million today), and the next year Balmer was replaced by Wade Hampton Nichols, who had edited various movie magazines. Phillips Wyman took over as publisher. Nichols decided to concentrate on &quot;young adults&quot; between 18 and 34 and turned the magazine around. By 1950 circulation reached two million, and the following year the cover price was raised to 35 cents. It published articles on racial prejudice, the dangers of nuclear weapons, and the damage caused by McCarthyism, among other topics. In 1954, &quot;Redbook&quot; received the Benjamin Franklin Award for public service.

The next year, as the magazine was beginning to steer towards a female audience, Wyman died, and in 1958 Nichols left to edit &quot;Good Housekeeping&quot;. The new editor was Robert Stein, who continued the focus on women and featured authors such as Dr. Benjamin Spock and Margaret Mead. In 1965 he was replaced by Sey Chassler, during whose 17-year tenure circulation increased to nearly five million and the magazine earned a number of awards, including two National Magazine Awards for fiction. His &quot;New York Times&quot; obituary says, &quot;A strong advocate for women&#x27;s rights, Mr. Chassler started an unusual effort in 1976 that led to the simultaneous publication of articles about the proposed equal rights amendment in 36 women&#x27;s magazines. He did it again three years later with 33 magazines.&quot; He retired in 1981 and was replaced by Anne Mollegen Smith, the first woman editor, who had been with the magazine since 1967, serving as fiction editor and managing editor.

Norton Simon Inc., which had purchased the McCall Corporation, sold Redbook to the Charter Company in 1975. In 1982, Charter sold the magazine to the Hearst Corporation, and in April 1983 Smith was fired and replaced by Annette Capone, who &quot;de-emphasized the traditional fiction, featured more celebrity covers, and gave a lot of coverage to exercise, fitness, and nutrition. The main focus was on the young woman who was balancing family, home, and career.&quot; (Endres and Lueck, p. 305) After Ellen Levine took over as editor in 1991, even less fiction was published, and the focus was on the young mother. Levine said, &quot;We couldn&#x27;t be the magazine we wanted to be with such a big audience, you have to lose your older readers. We did it the minute I walked in the door. It was part of the deal.&quot;

Levine moved to &quot;Good Housekeeping&quot; in 1994, being replaced by &quot;McCall&#x27;s&quot; Kate White, who left for &quot;Cosmopolitan&quot; four years later. Succeeding editors were Lesley Jane Seymour (1998-2001), Ellen Kunes (2001-2004), and Stacy Morrison (2004-2010).

Redbook Magazine has ceased print publication as of its November/December 2018 issue [Vol. 231, No.4]. Redbook&#x27;s Customer Service page notes itself that Redbook magazine &quot;is no longer being published&quot;.

A column by Kelly Faircloth at Jezebel reports secondhand though an AdWeek October 10, 2018, article &quot;that after January 2019, Redbook will become an &#x27;online-only destination&#x27;.&quot;

==Coverage==
&quot;Redbook&quot;&#x27;s articles are primarily targeted towards married women. The magazine features stories about women dealing with modern hardships, aspiring for intellectual growth, and encouraging other women to work together for humanitarian causes. The magazine profiles successful women to provide inspirational testimonies and advice on life.

<text>The Inca tern (Larosterna inca) is a near-threatened species of tern in the subfamily Sterninae of the family Laridae (the gulls, terns, and skimmers). It is found along the Pacific coasts of Chile, Ecuador and Perú, and has appeared as a vagrant in Central America and Hawaii.

==Taxonomy and systematics==
The Inca tern is the sole member of its monotypic genus &quot;Larosterna&quot;, and has no accepted subspecies. Perhaps surprisingly given its highly distinct plumage, the Inca tern is not particularly basal among the terns, being more closely related to typical &quot;Sterna&quot; terns than any of the superficially much more similar genera &quot;Gelochelidon&quot;, &quot;Hydroprogne&quot;, &quot;Onychoprion&quot;, &quot;Phaetusa&quot;, or &quot;Sternula&quot; are.

==Description==

The Inca tern is roughly long and weighs between . Its plumage is uniquely colored among terns; adults have a mostly dark, slate-gray body, with paler underwing coverts, and a slightly paler throat. A white stripe extends back from the base of the bill and fans out like a Salvador Dalíesque mustache as long, satiny feathers along the side of the neck. The trailing edge of the wing (the tips of the secondaries and the three inner primaries) are white. The tail is black, and moderately forked. The iris is brown, with legs and feet that are dark red. The bill is bright to dark red, with bare yellow skin at the base. The chicks, on hatching, are purplish-brown, progressing through brownish-gray before developing mature plumage. The chicks&#x27; bills and legs are dark and horn-colored, and gradually attain the red that adults have.

==Distribution and habitat==
The Inca tern is an inhabitant of the Humboldt Current region. It breeds from Lobos de Tierra, in northern Perú, south to the Aconcagua River, near Valparaíso, Chile. Some disperse north into Ecuador after breeding, and south to the Puerto Montt area of Chile, where multiple &#x27;research-grade&#x27; sightings with photos on the biodiversity database iNaturalist, including a group of four together. It is a casual visitor to Panamá and Costa Rica, and has also been recorded as a vagrant in Guatemala and Hawaii. The documented Hawaiian birds, in particular, remained from March through November on the Hawaiian archipelago.

The South American Classification Committee of the American Ornithological Society treats the Inca tern&#x27;s presence in Colombia as &quot;hypothetical&quot;, due to a number of unverified or undocumented sightings. On iNaturalist, one &#x27;research-grade&#x27; sighting (with photo) has been documented from the coast of Buenaventura, Colombia&#x27;s Isla Cascajal, dated July 2023; however, the species&#x27; popularity in captivity (see Captivity below) complicates assessment of extralimital records.

The Inca tern nests on sea cliffs and guano islands, as well as manmade structures (such as ledges under piers) and abandoned barges. It will gather with other sea and shorebirds on sandy beaches. 

==Behavior==

===Movement===
The Inca tern is essentially non-migratory, although some disperse northwards after breeding. Some rogue individuals have flown great distances.

===Feeding===
The Inca tern feeds primarily on small fish, such as anchoveta (&quot;Engraulis ringens&quot;), and also consumes planktonic crustaceans and offal or carrion in its diet. Large flocks congregate around fishing boats and will also follow the feeding patterns of cormorants, sea lions, and whales and dolphins. Feeding flocks can number over 5,000 birds. The Inca tern catches its prey mainly by plunge-diving, but also picks items from the surface while flying or floating on the water.

===Breeding===
Breeding does not appear to be concentrated in any season. Eggs have been found between April and July and between October and December, and other evidence of breeding has been noted in August. It nests in a variety of sites including fissures and caves in rock cliffs, among rocks and boulders on island slopes, in abandoned petrel and penguin burrows, and on and under human structures. The clutch size is usually two eggs though sometimes one. Both sexes incubate the clutch and provision the young. The incubation period is not known; fledging occurs about four weeks after hatch and the young are fully dependent on the adults for at least a month after fledging.
===Vocalization===
The Inca tern is most vocal at its nesting colonies. Its calls include &quot;raucous cackling notes&quot; and &quot;mewing&quot;; the latter call has been likened to that of a kitten.

==Status==
The IUCN has assessed the Inca tern as Near Threatened. It has a somewhat restricted range; its population size is not known and is believed to be decreasing. &quot;Reproductive success is dramatically reduced during El Niño events&quot;. Human harvesting of its primary prey is a probable threat as is climate change. One estimate placed its population at about 150,000 in 2011.

==Captivity==

Because of its unusual plumage, the species is popular in zoos. Escapes from captivity can occur, which leads to problems determining genuine vagrancy.

<text>Hydroponic is an EP by 311, released in 1992. It was their last independent release before they were signed to Capricorn Records for their first studio album &quot;Music&quot;. It was considered the first EP with S.A. Martinez as an official member of the band. This EP was a six-track demo that contained four songs that would appear on their debut album &quot;Music&quot;. The four that made it to &quot;Music&quot; were all tuned down one half step. Before the official release of &quot;Hydroponic&quot;, the band made hand-written &quot;pre-release&quot; promo copies of the new EP and sold them at various shows (including the EP release party performance on 2/1/1992 at the &quot;Peony Park Ballroom&quot;) as well as &quot;Joe Voda&#x27;s Drum City&quot;, which was Chad&#x27;s mother&#x27;s store, who now works at Dietze&#x27;s Music in Bellevue, Nebraska. Pre-release promo copies were hand-written by the band (Chad Sexton) and sold at various shows as well as &quot;Joe Voda&#x27;s Drum City&quot; (where Chad&#x27;s mother worked at the time) before its official release on cassette. Most of the copies were hand-written by Chad Sexton himself and have been spotted on eBay.

Nick Hexum mentioned this at their performance on February 1, 1992, at the &quot;Peony Park Ballroom&quot; and therefore is one of 311&#x27;s most highly valued collectibles. Currently out of print, this EP has become a collectors item.

On May 6, 2015, a remastered Hydroponic was released on 10-inch vinyl and CD through on the band&#x27;s site.

<doc id="760506" wikidata="Q1640577" url="?curid=760506" title="Lithuanian mythology">
<text>Lithuanian mythology () is the mythology of Lithuanian polytheism, the religion of pre-Christian Lithuanians. Like other Indo-Europeans, ancient Lithuanians maintained a polytheistic mythology and religious structure. In pre-Christian Lithuania, mythology was a part of polytheistic religion; after Christianisation mythology survived mostly in folklore, customs and festive rituals. Lithuanian mythology is very close to the mythology of other Baltic nations such as Prussians and Latvians, and is considered a part of Baltic mythology.

==Sources and evidence==


Early Lithuanian religion and customs were based on oral tradition. Therefore, the very first records about Lithuanian mythology and beliefs were made by travellers, Christian missionaries, chronicle writers and historians. Original Lithuanian oral tradition partially survived in national ritual and festive songs and legends which started to be written down in the 18th century.

The first bits about Baltic religion were written down by Herodotus describing Neuri (Νευροί) in his &quot;Histories&quot; and Tacitus in his &quot;Germania&quot; mentioned Aestii wearing boar figures and worshipping &quot;Mother of gods&quot;. Neuri were mentioned by Roman geographer Pomponius Mela. In the 9th century there is one attestation about Prussian (Aestii) funeral traditions by Wulfstan. In 11th century Adam of Bremen mentioned Prussians, living in Sambia and their holy groves. 12th century Muslim geographer al-Idrisi in &quot;The Book of Roger&quot; mentioned Balts as worshipers of Holy Fire and their flourishing city &quot;Madsun&quot; (Mdsūhn, Mrsunh, Marsūna).

The first recorded Baltic myth - &quot;The Tale of Sovij&quot; was detected as the complementary insert in the copy of &quot;Chronographia&quot; (&quot;Χρονογραφία&quot;) of Greek chronicler from Antioch John Malalas rewritten in the year 1262 in Lithuania. It is a first recorded Baltic myth, also the first placed among myths of other nations – Greek, Roman and others. The &quot;Tale of Sovij&quot; describes the establishing of cremation custom which was common among Lithuanians and other Baltic nations. The names of the Baltic gods :lt:Andajus, Perkūnas, :lt:Žvorūna, and a smith-god :lt:Teliavelis are mentioned.

When the Prussian Crusade and Lithuanian Crusade started, more first-hand knowledge about beliefs of Balts were recorded, but these records were mixed with propaganda about &quot;infidels&quot;. One of the first valuable sources is the Treaty of Christburg, 1249, between the pagan Prussian clans, represented by a papal legate, and the Teutonic Knights. In it worship of Kurkas (&quot;Curche&quot;), the god of harvest and grain, pagan priests (&quot;Tulissones vel Ligaschones&quot;), who performed certain rituals at funerals are mentioned.

&quot;Chronicon terrae Prussiae&quot; is a major source for information on the Order&#x27;s battles with Old Prussians and Lithuanians. It contains mentionings about Prussian religion and the center of Baltic religion – Romuva, where lives Kriwe-Kriwajto as a powerful priest who was held in high regard by the Prussians, Lithuanians, and Balts of Livonia.

The &quot;Livonian Rhymed Chronicle&quot;, which covers the period 1180 – 1343, contains records about ethical codex of the Lithuanians and the Baltic people.

&quot;Descriptiones terrarum&quot;, written by an anonymous author in the middle of 13th century. The author was a guest at coronation of Lithuanian king Mindaugas. The author also mentioned that Lithuanians, Yotwingians and Nalsenians embraced Christianity quite easily, since their childhood nuns were usually Christian, but Christianity in Samogitia was introduced only with a sword.

Die Littauischen Wegeberichte (&quot;The descriptions of Lithuanian routes&quot;) is a compilation of 100 routes into the western Grand Duchy of Lithuania prepared by the Teutonic Knights and their spies in 1384–1402. It contains descriptions and mentionings of Lithuanian holy groves and sacrificial places — &quot;alkas&quot;.

Hypatian Codex written in 1425, mentions Lithuanian gods and customs.

Simon Grunau was the author of &quot;Preussische Chronik&quot;, written sometime between 1517 and 1529. It became main source for research of Prussian mythology and one of the main sources of Lithuanian mythology researchers and reconstructors. It was the first source which described the flag of Vaidevutis. The book contained many questionable ideas, though.

French theologian and cardinal of the Roman Catholic Church, Pierre d&#x27;Ailly mentions the Sun (&quot;Saulė&quot;) as one of the most important Lithuanian gods, which rejuvenates the world as its spirit. Like Romans, Lithuanians consecrate the Sunday entirely for the Sun. Although they are worshipping the Sun, they have no temples. The astronomy of Lithuanians is based on the Moon calendar.

Enea Silvio Bartolomeo Piccolomini, who later became the Pope Pius II, in the section &quot;de Europa&quot; of his book &quot;Historia rerum ubique gestarum&quot;, cited Jerome of Prague, who attested Lithuanians worshiping the Sun and the iron hammer which was used to free the Sun from the tower. He mentioned also Christian missionaries cutting off holy groves and oaks, which Lithuanians believed to be homes of the gods.

Jan Łasicki created &quot;De diis Samagitarum caeterorumque Sarmatarum et falsorum Christianorum&quot; (&quot;Concerning the gods of Samagitians, and other Sarmatians and false Christians&quot;) - written c. 1582 and published in 1615, although it has some important facts it also contains many inaccuracies, as he did not know Lithuanian and relied on stories of others. The list of Lithuanian gods, provided by Jan Łasicki, is still considered an important and of interest for Lithuanian mythology. Later researchers Teodor Narbutt, Simonas Daukantas and Jonas Basanavičius relied on his work.

Matthäus Prätorius in his two-volume &quot;Deliciae Prussicae oder Preussische Schaubühne&quot;, written in 1690, collected facts about Prussian and Lithuanian rituals. He idealised the culture of Prussians, considered it belonging to the culture of the Antique world.

The &quot;Sudovian Book&quot; was an anonymous work about the customs, religion, and daily life of the Prussians from Sambia (&quot;Semba&quot;). The manuscript was written in German in the 16th century. The book included a list of Prussian gods, sorted in a generally descending order from sky to earth to underworld and was and important source for reconstructing Baltic and Lithuanian mythology.

==History of scholarship==

Surviving information about Baltic mythology in general is fragmented. As with most ancient Indo-European cultures (e.g. Greece and India), the original primary mode of transmission of seminal information such as myths, stories, and customs was oral, the then-unnecessary custom of writing being introduced later during the period of the text-based culture of Christianity. Most of the early written accounts are very brief and made by foreigners, usually Christians, who disapproved of pagan traditions. Some academics regard some texts as inaccurate misunderstandings or even fabrications. In addition, many sources list many different names and different spellings, thus sometimes it is not clear if they are referring to the same thing.

Lithuania became Christianized between the end of the 14th century and the beginning of the 15th century, but Lithuanian polytheism survived for another two centuries, gradually losing influence and coherence as a religion. The last conceptions of the old religion survived approximately until the beginning of the 19th century. The relics of the old polytheistic religion were already interwoven with songs, tales and other mythic stories. Gradually Lithuanian polytheism customs and songs merged with the Christian tradition. In the beginning of the 20th century Michał Pius Römer noted - &quot;Lithuanian folklore culture having its sources in heathenism is in complete concord with Christianity&quot;.

In 1883, Edmund Veckenstedt published a book &quot;Die Mythen, Sagen und Legenden der Zamaiten (Litauer)&quot; ().

It is not easy to reconstruct Lithuanian mythology in its full form. Lithuanian mythology was not static, but constantly developed, so it did not remain in the same form over the longer periods.

J. Dlugosz tried to research myths and religion of ancient Lithuanians. He considered it close to the ancient culture of Rome. Almost all authors of Renaissance - J. Dlugosz, M. Stryjkowski, J. Lasicki, M. Prätorius and others, relied not only on previous authors and chroniclers, but included facts and attestations of their time as well. Since Renaissance scholars were quite knowledgeable about the culture of antique world, their interpretation of Lithuanian religion was affected by Roman or Greek cultures.

Many scholars preferred to write their own reconstructions of Lithuanian mythology, based also on historical, archaeological, and ethnographic data. The first such reconstruction was written by the Lithuanian historian Theodor Narbutt at the beginning of the 19th century.

The interest in Baltic and Lithuanian mythology was growing along with interest in Lithuanian language among Indo-Europeanists, since the conservative and native Baltic nations preserved very archaic language and cultural traditions.
Italian linguist Vittore Pisani along with his research of Baltic languages, studied Lithuanian mythology.
Two well-known attempts at reconstruction have been attempted more recently by Marija Gimbutas and Algirdas Julien Greimas. According to G. Beresenevičius it is impossible to reconstruct the Lithuanian mythology in entirety, since there were only fragments which survived. Marija Gimbutas explored Lithuanian and Baltic mythology using her method - archaeomythology where archeological findings being interpreted through known mythology. A material related to the Lithuanian spells was used by V. Ivanov and V. Toporov to restore the Indo-European myths.

The most modern academics exploring Lithuanian mythology in the second half of the 20th century were Norbertas Vėlius and Gintaras Beresnevičius.

==Pantheon of Lithuanian gods==

The pantheon of Lithuania was formed during thousands of years by merging pre-Indo-European and Indo-European traditions. Feminine gods such as &quot;Žemyna&quot; (goddess of the earth) are attributed to pre-Indo-European tradition, whereas very expressive thunder-god &quot;Perkūnas&quot; is considered to derive from Indo-European religion. The hierarchy of the gods depended also on social strata of ancient Lithuanian society.

Dievas, also called &quot;Dievas senelis&quot; (&#x27;old man God&#x27;), &quot;Dangaus Dievas&quot; (&#x27;the God of heaven&#x27;) - the supreme sky god. It is descended from Proto-Indo-European *&quot;deiwos&quot;, &quot;celestial&quot; or &quot;shining&quot;, from the same root as &quot;*Dyēus&quot;, the reconstructed chief god of the Proto-Indo-European pantheon. It relates to ancient Greek &quot;Zeus&quot; (&quot;Ζευς&quot; or &quot;Δίας&quot;), Latin Dius Fidius, Luvian &quot;Tiwat&quot;, German &quot;Tiwaz&quot;. The name &quot;Dievas&quot; is being used in Christianity as the name of &quot;God&quot;.

Andajus (&quot;Andajas&quot;, &quot;Andojas&quot;) was mentioned in chronicles as the most powerful and highest god of Lithuanians. Lithuanians cried its name in a battle. It might just be an epithet of the supreme god - &quot;Dievas&quot;.

Perkūnas, god of thunder, also synonymically called &quot;Dundulis&quot;, &quot;Bruzgulis&quot;, &quot;Dievaitis&quot;, &quot;Grumutis&quot; etc. It closely relates to other thunder gods in many Indo-European mythologies: Vedic &quot;Parjanya&quot;, Celtic Taranis, Germanic Thor, Slavic Perun. The Finnic and Mordvin/Erza thunder god named &quot;Pur&#x27;ginepaz&quot; shows in folklore themes that resemble the imagery of Lithuanian &quot;Perkunas&quot;. &quot;Perkūnas&quot; is the assistant and executor of Dievas&#x27;s will. He is also associated with the oak tree.

Dievo sūneliai (the &quot;sons of &quot;Dievas&quot;&quot;) – Ašvieniai, pulling the carriage of Saulė (the Sun) through the sky. Like the Greek Dioscuri Castor and Pollux, it is a mytheme of the Divine twins common to the Indo-European mythology. Two well-accepted descendants of the Divine Twins, the Vedic Aśvins and the Lithuanian Ašvieniai, are linguistic cognates ultimately deriving from the Proto-Indo-European word for the horse, &quot;*h₁éḱwos&quot;. They are related to Sanskrit &quot;áśva&quot; and Avestan &quot;aspā&quot; (from Indo-Iranian &quot;*aćua&quot;), and to Old Lithuanian &quot;ašva&quot;, all sharing the meaning of &quot;mare&quot;.

Velnias (&quot;Velas&quot;, &quot;Velinas&quot;) – chthonic god of the underworld, related to the cult of dead. The root of the word is the same as of (&#x27;soul of the deceased&#x27;). After the introduction of Christianity it was equated with evil and &quot;Velnias&quot; became a Lithuanian name for &quot;devil&quot;. In some tales, &quot;Velnias&quot; (the devil) was the first owner of fire. God sent a swallow, which managed to steal the fire.

Žemyna (&quot;Žemė&quot;, &quot;Žemelė&quot;) (from &#x27;earth&#x27;) is the goddess of the earth. It relates to Thracian &quot;Zemele&quot; (&quot;mother earth&quot;), Greek &quot;Semelē&quot; (&quot;Σεμέλη&quot;). She is usually regarded as mother goddess and one of the chief Lithuanian gods. &quot;Žemyna&quot; personifies the fertile earth and nourishes all life on earth, human, plant, and animal. The goddess is said to be married to either &quot;Perkūnas&quot; (thunder god) or &quot;Praamžius&quot; (manifestation of chief heavenly god &quot;Dievas&quot;). Thus the couple formed the typical Indo-European pair of mother-earth and father-sky. It was believed that in each spring the earth needs to be impregnated by &quot;Perkūnas&quot; - the heavens rain and thunder. &quot;Perkūnas&quot; unlocks () the Earth. It was prohibited to plow or sow before the first thunder as the earth would be barren.

Žvėrinė (&quot;Žvorūna&quot;, &quot;Žvorūnė&quot;) – is the goddess of hunting and forest animals. &quot;Medeina&quot; is the name in other sources.

Medeina – the goddess of forest and hunting. Researchers suggests that she and Žvėrinė (Žvorūnė) could have been worshipped as the same goddess.

Žemėpatis (from &#x27;earth&#x27; and &#x27;autonomous decision maker, ruler&#x27;; or &#x27;Earth Spouse&#x27;) – god of the land, harvest, property and homestead. Martynas Mažvydas in 1547 in his &quot;Catechism&quot; urged to abandon cult of &quot;Žemėpatis&quot;.

Žvaigždikis (Žvaigždystis, Žvaigždukas, Švaistikas) – the god of the stars, powerful god of light, who provided light for the crops, grass and the animals. It was also known as Svaikstikas (Suaxtix, Swayxtix, Schwayxtix, Schwaytestix) by Yotvingians.

Gabija (also known as Gabieta, Gabeta, Matergabija, Pelengabija) is the spirit or goddess of the fire. She is the protector of family fireplace (&quot;šeimos židinys&quot;) and family. Her name is derived from – to cover, to protect. Nobody was allowed to step on firewood, since it was considered a food for the fire goddess. Even today there is a tradition of weddings in Lithuania to light a new symbolic family fireplace from the parents of the newlyweds.

Laima (from – &#x27;to destine&#x27;) or Laimė – is the destiny-giver goddess.

Bangpūtys (from &#x27;wave&#x27; and &#x27;to blow&#x27; ) – god of the sea, wind, waves and storm. Was worshipped by fishermen and seamen.

Teliavelis/Kalevelis – a smith-god or the god of roads. First mentioned in a 1262 copy of &quot;Chronographia (Χρονογραφία)&quot; of John Malalas as &quot;Teliavel&quot;. Lithuanian linguist Kazimieras Būga reconstructed a previous form – &quot;Kalvelis&quot; (from &#x27;a smith&#x27; in diminutive form). &quot;Teliavelis/Kalevelis&quot; freed &quot;Saulė&quot; (Sun) from the dark using his iron hammer.
In Lithuanian fairy-tales recorded much later, there is very frequent opposition of &quot;kalvis&quot; (&#x27;smith&#x27;) and &quot;velnias&quot; (&#x27;devil&#x27;).

==The periods of Lithuanian mythology and religion==

Pre-Christian Lithuanian mythology is known mainly through attested fragments recorded by chroniclers and folks songs; the existence of some mythological elements, known from later sources, has been confirmed by archaeological findings. The system of polytheistic beliefs is reflected in Lithuanian tales, such as Jūratė and Kastytis, Eglė the Queen of Serpents and the Myth of Sovij.

The next period of Lithuanian mythology started in the 15th century, and lasted until approximately the middle of the 17th century. The myths of this period are mostly heroic, concerning the founding of the state of Lithuania. Perhaps two the best known stories are those of the dream of the Grand Duke Gediminas and the founding of Vilnius, the capital of Lithuania, and of Šventaragis&#x27; Valley, which also concerns the history of Vilnius. Many stories of this kind reflect actual historical events. Already by the 16th century, there existed a non-unified pantheon; data from different sources did not correspond one with another, and local spirits, especially those of the economic field, became mixed up with more general gods and ascended to the level of gods.
The third period began with the growing influence of Christianity and the activity of the Jesuits, roughly since the end of the 16th century. The earlier confrontational approach to the pre-Christian Lithuanian heritage among common people was abandoned, and attempts were made to use popular beliefs in missionary activities. This also led to the inclusion of Christian elements in mythic stories.

The last period of Lithuanian mythology began in the 19th century, when the importance of the old cultural heritage was admitted, not only by the upper classes, but by the nation more widely. The mythical stories of this period are mostly reflections of the earlier myths, considered not as being true, but as the encoded experiences of the past.

==Elements and nature in the Lithuanian mythology==

===Elements, celestial bodies and nature phenomena===
Stories, songs, and legends of this kind describe laws of nature and such natural processes as the change of seasons of the year, their connections with each other and with the existence of human beings. Nature is often described in terms of the human family; in one central example (found in many songs and stories), the sun is called the mother, the moon the father, and stars the sisters of human beings. Lithuanian mythology is rich in gods and minor gods of water, sky and earth. Holy groves were worshipped, especially beautiful and distinctive places – &quot;alka&quot; were selected for sacrifices for gods.

====Fire====

Fire is very often mentioned by chroniclers, when they were describing Lithuanian rituals. The Lithuanian king Algirdas was even addressed as a &quot;fire worshiper King of Lithuania&quot; (τῷ πυρσολάτρῃ ῥηγὶ τῶν Λιτβῶν) in the documents of a patriarch Nilus of Constantinople.

====Water====
Water was considered a primary element - legends describing the creation of the world, usually state that &quot;at first there was nothing but water&quot;.
Springs were worshiped - they were considered holy. The river was seen as separating the areas of alive and death. If the settlement was placed at the river, then the deceased were buried in another side of the river. Water sources were highly respected and was tradition to keep any water - spring, well, river, lake clean. Cleanliness was associated with holiness.

====Holy groves====
Holy groves were considered not holy in itself, but as a home of gods. Jerome of Prague was an ardent missionary in Lithuania, leading the chopping of the holy groves and desecration of Lithuanian sacred heathen places. Lithuanian woman reached Vytautas the Great with plaints that they are losing their places of &quot;Dievas&quot;, the places where they prayed supreme god – &quot;Dievas&quot; to withhold the Sun or rain. Now, when the holy groves are destroyed they do not know where to search for &quot;Dievas&quot; since it lost its home. Jerome of Prague was finally sent out of the country.

====Celestial bodies====
Celestial bodies – planets were seen as a family. &quot;Mėnulis&quot; (Moon) married &quot;Saulė&quot; (Sun) and they had seven daughters: &quot;Aušrinė&quot; (Morning Star – Venus), &quot;Vakarinė&quot; (Evening Star – Venus), &quot;Indraja&quot; (Jupiter), &quot;Vaivora&quot; or son &quot;Pažarinis&quot; in some versions (Mercury), &quot;Žiezdrė&quot; (Mars), &quot;Sėlija&quot; (Saturn), &quot;Žemė&quot; (Earth). Three daughters lived close to their mother Saulė, another three were traveling.

&quot;Grįžulo Ratai&quot; (also – &quot;Grigo Ratai&quot;, &quot;Perkūno Ratai&quot;, &quot;Vežimas&quot;) (Ursa Major) was imagined as a carriage for the Sun which was travelling through the sky, &quot;Mažieji Grįžulo Ratai&quot; (Ursa Minor) – a carriage for the daughter of Sun.

Zodiac or Astrological signs were known as liberators of the Saulė (Sun) from the tower in which it was locked by the powerful king – the legend recorded by Jerome of Prague in 14-15th century.

==Lithuanian legends==

Legends (&quot;padavimai&quot;, &quot;sakmės&quot;) are a short stories explaining the local names, appearance of the lakes and rivers, other notable places like mounds or big stones.

==Lithuanian myths==
* The Tale of Sovij
* The myth of god-smith Teliavelis freeing the Sun
* The cosmogonic myths of celestial bodies: Aušrinė, Saulė and Mėnulis, Grįžulo Ratai - also known as &quot;the celestial marriage drama&quot;.
* The nine-point deer (&quot;Elnias devyniaragis&quot;) – the deer which carries the sky with planets on its antler.
* Eglė the Queen of Serpents
* Jūratė and Kastytis
* The Tale of priestess (&quot;vaidilutė&quot;) Birutė and Grand Duke Kęstutis.
* Iron Wolf – the legend about founding of Vilnius.
* Palemonids – the legend of origin of Lithuanians.

==Legacy==
Lithuanian mythology serves as a constant inspiration for Lithuanian artists. Many interpretations of &quot;Eglė – the Queen of Serpents&quot; were made in poetry and visual art. In modern Lithuanian music polytheistic rituals and sutartinės songs were source of inspiration for Bronius Kutavičius. Old Lithuanian names, related to nature and mythology are often given to the children. Many pagan traditions slightly transformed were adopted by the Christian religion in Lithuania. Oaks are still considered a special tree, and grass snakes are treated with care. Old songs and pagan culture serve as inspiration for rock and pop musicians.

<text>Stuart Kingsley Holland (born 25 March 1940) is a British economist and former politician. As a Member of Parliament for the Labour Party, Holland represented the Vauxhall constituency in Lambeth, London, from 1979 to 1989, when he resigned his seat to take up a post at the European University Institute in Florence.

Holland has held teaching and research posts at the Universities of Oxford and of Sussex, the European University Institute and the Universities of Roskilde and of Coimbra; has authored over 180 articles, many of which are in referred journals, chapters in books and other papers and conference presentations; and authored, co-authored or edited over 15 books on economic theory and policy, international trade, economic integration, regional theory and policy, social policies, development economics and global governance. Holland is a visiting professor at the Faculty of Economics of the University of Coimbra and a Senior Scholar of the Institute of Social and European Studies, Köszeg, Hungary.

==Biography==
Born in 1940, Stuart Holland studied and taught history and political theory at University of Oxford, became an adviser to Harold Wilson on European affairs and gained the consent of Charles de Gaulle for a second British application to join the European Community.

Resigning from 10 Downing Street when Wilson did not follow through the proposal for a European Technology Community and for mutual currency support, Holland gained an economics doctorate at Oxford and drafted what in the early 1970s became the economic programme of the British Labour Party when he researched and taught at Sussex University.

His case for state holding companies in energy and industry led to the creation of the British National Oil Corporation and a National Enterprise Board. His proposals for regional development agencies led to the creation of the Scottish, Welsh and Northern Ireland Development Agencies and the Greater London Enterprise Board (now London Enterprise).

From 1979 to 1989, he was Labour Member of Parliament for Vauxhall. As shadow minister for development co-operation from 1983 to 1987, he drafted the 1985 Global Challenge report for the Socialist International and led the first Labour Party delegation to China since Clement Attlee in 1952. He then was shadow financial secretary to the Treasury before he left Westminster to help Jacques Delors shape European Union policies for economic and social cohesion.

MPs resign from the House of Commons by being appointed to an office of profit under the Crown. Holland was appointed to the sinecure post of Steward of the Chiltern Hundreds and held it for five years and 247 days the longest time that the post has been held since its creation in 1850.

Holland&#x27;s proposals to Delors for bonds like during the US New Deal to offset the deflationary Maastricht debt and deficit conditions resurfaced during the eurozone crisis. His case to Delors on the case for a New Bretton Woods Conference was endorsed by Bill Clinton at his first G7 in Naples but was not followed through by European governments.

Holland&#x27;s more recent case that the G20 should constitute the governing body of a World Development Organization also has attracted high-level interest from the Permanent Representatives to the UN of China, Japan, India, South Africa, Brazil and Mexico.

His earlier advice to Andreas Papandreou, backed by François Mitterrand, prompted the first revision of the Treaty of Rome with commitments to an internal market and to economic and social cohesion in the 1986 Single European Act.

His later advice to Portuguese Prime Minister António Guterres included a cohesion and convergence remit for the European Investment Bank to invest in health, education, urban regeneration and new technology without counting on national debt. In 199, the European Council endorsed the proposal, as did employer and trades union representatives on the Economic and Social Committee of the EU in 2012.

In 2010, he co-authored &quot;A Modest Proposal&quot; with the Greek economist Yanis Varoufakis.

<text>Joseph Mercer (9 August 1914 – 9 August 1990) was an English footballer and manager. Mercer, who played as a defender for Everton and Arsenal in his footballing career, also went on to manage Aston Villa and Manchester City, and was the caretaker manager of the England national football team.

==Playing career==
Mercer was born in Ellesmere Port, Cheshire, the son of a former Nottingham Forest and Tranmere Rovers footballer, also named Joe. His father died following health problems resulting from a gas attack during the Great War, when Mercer was only 12.

Mercer, a left-half, first played for Ellesmere Port Town. He was a powerful tackler and good at anticipating an opponent&#x27;s moves. He joined Everton in September 1932 at the age of 18 and claimed a regular first team place in the 1935–36 season. Mercer made 186 appearances for Everton, scoring two goals and a winning a League championship medal in the 1938–39 season. While playing for Everton, he gained five England caps between 1938 and 1939.

Like many players of his generation, Mercer lost out on seven seasons of football due to the Second World War. He became a sergeant-major and played in 26 wartime internationals, many of them as captain. The Everton manager Theo Kelly accused Mercer of not trying in an international against Scotland, but in reality, Mercer had sustained a severe cartilage injury. Even after consulting an orthopaedic specialist, the Everton management refused to believe him and Mercer had to pay for the surgery himself. During the war, Mercer guested for Chester City, making his debut in a 4–1 win over Halifax Town in September 1942.

Mercer moved in late 1946 for £9,000 (&quot;2022: £471,362&quot;) to Arsenal, commuting from Liverpool; Kelly brought Mercer&#x27;s boots to the transfer negotiations to prevent Mercer having a reason to go back to say goodbye to the other players at Everton. He made his Arsenal debut against Bolton Wanderers on 30 November 1946 and soon after joining Arsenal, Mercer became club captain. As captain, he led Arsenal through their period of success in the late 1940s and early 1950s, helping to haul his side from the lower end of the table to win a League championship title in the 1947–48 season.

Mercer went on to win an FA Cup winner&#x27;s medal in 1950 and was voted FWA Footballer of the Year the same year. He led Arsenal to the Cup final in 1952, which they lost 1–0 to Newcastle United. The following year, they bounced back to win his third League title with Arsenal winning the 1952–53 League championship on goal average. Mercer initially decided to retire in May 1953, but soon recanted and returned to Arsenal for the 1953–54 season. On 10 April 1954, he broke his leg in two places after a collision with teammate Joe Wade in a match against Liverpool, and finally called time on his footballing career the year after. Mercer played 275 times for Arsenal in all, scoring two goals.

==Managerial career==
After his playing career ended, Mercer spent a little over a year working as a journalist and a grocer. His wife&#x27;s family had encouraged him to become involved in grocery during his time at Everton and, while still Arsenal&#x27;s captain, he ran his grocery business from 105 to 107 Brighton Street, Wallasey.

On 18 August 1955, he returned to football, becoming manager of Sheffield United two days before their first game of the season against Newcastle United. Mercer was appointed to replace manager Reg Freeman who had died during the close season. As a manager, he began inauspiciously and his first season ended in relegation.

The rest of his time as manager was spent in the Second Division and in December 1958, wanting to move to another club, he resigned and moved to Aston Villa who were bottom of the First Division. Although he led them to the FA Cup semi-finals, he was relegated to the Second Division once again. He moulded a talented young side at Villa and his team became known as the &quot;Mercer Minors&quot;. He led Villa to victory in the inaugural League Cup in 1961, but suffered a stroke in 1964 and was then sacked by the Aston Villa board upon his recovery.

Despite this, his health improved and he went on to enjoy great success as a manager with Manchester City between 1965 and 1971. In his first season at Maine Road, the club won the 1966 Second Division title to regain top-flight status. Two seasons later, Mercer led Manchester City to the 1967–68 First Division championship, and went on to win the 1969 FA Cup, the 1970 League Cup, and the 1970 European Cup Winners&#x27; Cup.

In the 1970–71 season, Mercer had a dispute with his assistant Malcolm Allison, after the two men became embroiled in Manchester City&#x27;s takeover battle. Mercer supported the existing board, led by the respected Albert Alexander Sr., while Allison supported the rival group led by Peter Swales after being promised that he would be manager in his own right.

The takeover succeeded, and Mercer was shocked to discover that his car parking space and office were removed. This led to Mercer moving upstairs to become general manager at Manchester City in October 1971, with Allison taking over as team manager. Mercer left Manchester City at the end of the season and became manager of Coventry City, whom he managed from 1972 to 1974. During the same time, Mercer was also caretaker manager of the England national football team for a brief period in 1974 after Sir Alf Ramsey&#x27;s resignation. During his time in charge, England won the 1974 British Home Championship title which was shared with Scotland. In total, Mercer was in charge for seven games, winning three of them, drawing another three and losing one. The FA was so impressed by these performances that questions arose about the possibility of Mercer taking the job on a longer-term basis, with, as an assistant, his Coventry City protege Gordon Milne. Mercer, too, seemed open to persuasion but the FA was working on another plan, putting out feelers to the most successful English club manager available, Leeds United&#x27;s Don Revie.

==Later life==

After quitting as Coventry City boss, he served as a director of the club from 1975 to his retirement in 1981. He was also an active freemason attending Rivacre Lodge No. 5805 at Ellesmere Port. Mercer was a subject of the television programme &quot;This Is Your Life&quot; in March 1970, when he was surprised by Eamonn Andrews. He was made an Officer of the Order of the British Empire for services to football in 1976. He suffered with Alzheimer&#x27;s disease in later life and died, sitting in his favourite armchair, on his 76th birthday in 1990. He was survived by his widow Norah, who remained a keen football follower, and attended Manchester City matches to support City for many years. She died in March 2013 and her funeral was attended by 120-plus mourners, including City legends Mike Summerbee, Tony Book, Colin Bell and Joe Corrigan, as well as Bobby Charlton.

He is commemorated by his old club Manchester City with the road Joe Mercer Way at the City of Manchester Stadium being named after him. On the road, there are two mosaics by renowned Manchester artist Mark Kennedy of Mercer; one shows his smiling face lifting the League Championship trophy; the other is a version of a famous photograph showing the back of him as he looks out over the Maine Road pitch towards the Kippax Stand. His contribution to City was commemorated in the Kippax tribute still sung at the City of Manchester Stadium to the tune of Auld Lang Syne: &quot;The Stretford End cried out aloud: &#x27;It&#x27;s the end of you Sky Blues.&#x27; Joe Mercer came. We played the game. We went to Rotherham United, we won 1–0 and we were back into Division One. We&#x27;ve won the League, we&#x27;ve won the Cup, we&#x27;ve been to Europe too. And when we win the League again we&#x27;ll sing this song to you: City, City, City.&quot;

At Maine Road, a corporate suite, the Joe Mercer Suite, was officially opened by his widow Norah in 1993. A similar facility named after him exists at Goodison. In 1993, Mercer&#x27;s official biography, &quot;Football with a Smile&quot;, was written by Gary James. This book sold out within six months and was revised and re-published early in 2010. Mercer is also featured upon the mural that surrounds the Emirates Stadium. Mercer was inducted into the English Football Hall of Fame at the National Football Museum in Preston on 4 July 2009. He was inducted for his managerial success.

<text>The 1959 Atlantic hurricane season featured near normal tropical cyclone activity overall. The season officially began on June 15, 1959 and lasted until November 15, 1959. These dates historically described the period in each year when most tropical cyclogenesis occurs in the Atlantic basin. However, the formation of a tropical cyclone is possible at any time of the year, as shown in 1959, by the formation of Tropical Storm Arlene on May 28. Arlene struck Louisiana and brought minor flooding to the Gulf Coast of the United States. The next tropical storm, Beulah, formed in the western Gulf of Mexico and brought negligible impact to Mexico and Texas. Later in June, an unnamed hurricane, caused minor damage in Florida, and then devastated parts of Maritime Canada, resulting in what became known as the Escuminac disaster. Hurricane Cindy brought minor impact to The Carolinas. In late July, Hurricane Debra produced flooding in the state of Texas. Tropical Storm Edith in August and Hurricane Flora in September caused negligible impact on land.

The most significant storm of the season was Hurricane Gracie, which peaked as a Category 4 hurricane on the Saffir–Simpson hurricane wind scale. After weakening slightly, Gracie made landfall as a Category 4 hurricane in South Carolina on September 29. It brought strong winds, rough seas, heavy rainfall, and tornadoes to the state, as well as North Carolina and Virginia. Overall, Gracie caused 22 fatalities and $14 million in damage. Following Hurricane Gracie was Hurricane Hannah, a long-lived storm that did not cause any known impact on land. The last two tropical cyclones, Tropical Storm Irene and Hurricane Judith, both caused minor coastal and inland flooding in Florida. The storms of the 1959 Atlantic hurricane season were collectively attributed to $24 million (1959 USD) and 64 fatalities.

== Season summary ==

The 1959 Atlantic hurricane season officially began on June 15, 1959, and it ended on November 15, 1959. Eleven tropical cyclones were reported during the season. All eleven of them developed into a tropical storm, and all but one was assigned a name. Upon later reanalysis of the season&#x27;s various weather systems, three additional tropical storms were identified and added to the HURDAT tropical cyclone database. One new non-developing tropical depression was also identified. Of the 14 tropical storms now identified, 7 strengthened into a hurricane, with 2 reaching major hurricane strength (Category 3 or greater on the Saffir-Simpson scale). These numbers were slightly above (or at) the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration&#x27;s 1950–2000 averages of 9.6 tropical storms, 5.9 hurricanes, and 2.3 major hurricanes. Collectively, the tropical cyclones of the 1959 Atlantic hurricane season caused 64 fatalities and about $24 million (1959 USD) in damage.

Tropical cyclogenesis began with the pre-season development of Tropical Storm Arlene in the Gulf of Mexico on May 28. Storm formation continued at a brisk pace for several weeks. In June, Tropical Storm Beulah and an unnamed hurricane formed; the latter hit Maritime Canada as an extratropical cyclone, causing the worst fishing-related disaster in New Brunswick in 100 years. Another pair of hurricanes, Cindy and Debra, formed in the month of July. Tropical activity slowed down in August, with only Tropical Storm Edith forming during the month. Next, three tropical cyclones formed in September—Flora, Gracie, and Hannah—all of which attained hurricane status. Then, in October, Tropical Storm Irene and Hurricane Judith, the 1959 season&#x27;s final storm, developed. The latter storm dissipated on October 21, almost a month before the official end of the season on November 15.

The season&#x27;s activity was reflected with an accumulated cyclone energy (ACE) rating of 77, which is slightly below the 1950–2000 average of 94.7. ACE is, broadly speaking, a measure of the power of the hurricane multiplied by the length of time it existed, so storms that last a long time, as well as particularly strong hurricanes, have high ACEs. It is only calculated for full advisories on tropical systems at or exceeding , which is the threshold for tropical storm status.

== Systems ==
=== Tropical Storm Arlene ===
A tropical wave developed into the first tropical depression of the season on May 28, while located in the southeastern Gulf of Mexico. The depression strengthened and, early on the following day, was upgraded to Tropical Storm Arlene. The storm slowly intensified and reached its peak intensity of on May 29. Rapid weakening took place as the storm approached land. By late on May 30, Arlene made landfall near Lafayette, Louisiana with winds of . Early on the following day the storm weakened to a tropical depression while barely inland. The system eventually curved east-northeastward and meandered across the Southern United States until dissipating over South Carolina on June 2.

In Louisiana, a state maximum rainfall of fell in Houma. As a result, a few towns along the coast reported downed trees and electrical lines from high winds, which caused scattered power outages. In New Orleans, several roads were shut down due to inundation. Additionally, at least 100 homes within the city were flooded. In Baton Rouge, dozens of people were evacuated from a flooded home via ambulance and wagon to safer areas.
Overall, damage was light, reaching $500,000. One death was related to Arlene; a man drowned in rough surf off the coast of Galveston, Texas. After storm dissipated over the Southeastern United States, the extratropical remnants of Arlene brought moderate rainfall to parts of the Mid-Atlantic States and New England.
=== Tropical Storm Beulah ===

A cold front became stationary as it began to move across the Gulf of Mexico on June 13. After the &quot;SS Hondo&quot; reported winds of , it is estimated that a tropical depression developed at 1800 UTC on June 15, while located in the southwestern Gulf of Mexico. By June 16, the depression strengthened into Tropical Storm Beulah. Further deepening occurred and the storm peaked with winds of on June 17. As Beulah neared the Gulf Coast of Mexico, a building ridge of high pressure forced the storm southward. It then began to encounter stronger upper-level winds and weakened to a tropical depression on June 18. Shortly thereafter, the storm dissipated about northeast of Tuxpan, Veracruz. Tides of above normal occurred along the Texas coast, though no impact was reported in Mexico.
=== June hurricane ===
A tropical wave developed into a tropical depression while situated in the central Gulf of Mexico on June 18. It headed rapidly northeastward and made landfall near the Tampa Bay Area of Florida later that day. The storm dropped moderately heavy rainfall in Florida, which caused damage to crops. An F3 tornado near Miami and high tides on the west coast of the state also resulted in damage. Losses in Florida were around $1.7 million. Shortly thereafter, in entered the Atlantic Ocean and strengthened into a tropical storm later on June 18. Then, the following day, as it began undergoing extratropical transition, the system strengthened into a hurricane; the storm simultaneously peaked with maximum sustained winds of .

The extratropical cyclone struck Atlantic Canada, making landfall in Nova Scotia and then in Newfoundland, before dissipating on June 21. It caused significant damage across the region. About 45 boats were in the Northumberland Strait between New Brunswick and Prince Edward Island, and they did not have radio to receive warning of the approaching storm. Rough seas of up to in height damaged or destroyed many boats. At least 22 fishing boats capsized over water with their crew, causing 35 deaths. High winds also disrupted communications in some areas, and several houses were damaged, with losses reaching about $781,000. The New Brunswick Fishermen&#x27;s Disaster Fund was created to assist victims. The fund raised $400,000 in a few months from donations from throughout Canada, as well as Pope John XXIII and Queen Elizabeth II, the latter of whom was on a tour of the country at the time.
=== Hurricane Cindy ===
A low-pressure area associated with a cold front developed into a tropical depression on July 5, while located east of Florida. Tracking north-northeastward, it strengthened into Tropical Storm Cindy by the next day. Cindy turned westward because of a high-pressure area positioned to its north, and further intensified into a hurricane offshore the Carolinas on July 8. Cindy made landfall near McClellanville, South Carolina early on July 9, and re-curved to the northeast along the Fall Line as a tropical depression. It re-emerged into the Atlantic on July 10 and quickly restrengthened into a tropical storm. On July 11, Cindy passed over Cape Cod, while several other weather systems helped the storm maintain its intensity. Cindy transitioned into an extratropical cyclone on July 12 while approaching Atlantic Canada.

Overall structural damage from Cindy was minimal. One driver was killed in Georgetown, South Carolina after colliding with a fallen tree, and five deaths were caused by poor road conditions wrought by the storm in New England. Many areas experienced heavy rains, and several thousand people evacuated. Damage was mainly confined to broken tree limbs, shattered windows and power outages. Cindy brought a total of eleven tornadoes with it, of which two caused minor damage in North Carolina. The heaviest rainfall occurred in northern South Carolina, where rainfall amounted to . Tides ranged from above normal along the coast. As drought-like conditions were present in The Carolinas at the time, the rain that fell in the area was beneficial. After becoming extratropical over Atlantic Canada, the cyclone produced heavy rains and strong winds that sunk one ship. Damage caused by Cindy was estimated at $75,000.
=== Hurricane Debra ===
On July 23, interaction of a cold-core low and a tropical wave spawned a tropical depression located south of Louisiana. The depression meandered westward while steadily intensifying, becoming a Tropical Storm on July 24. A turn towards the northwest became evident as it attained Category 1 hurricane status on the Saffir–Simpson Hurricane Scale on the following day. Strength was maintained as the hurricane curved northward at a slow forward speed, and it approached the coast of Texas as a minimal hurricane. Debra made landfall between Freeport and Galveston, Texas early on July 25. Debra rapidly weakened into a tropical storm and later a depression as it moved inland, and it dissipated on July 28. The remnant moisture later sparked upper-level thunderstorms in late July and early August.

Torrential rains were produced in southeastern Texas, peaking at in Orange. This led to widespread flooding on highways, including portions of Farm to Market Road 518, Highway 6, Highway 146, and U.S. Route 75. Sea vessels took the brunt of the storm, with many becoming stranded or damaged. Air, rail, and road transportation were significantly interrupted or even shut down. High winds from the storm caused expansive damage to buildings, windows, signs, and roofs. The hurricane resulted in 11 injuries but no human deaths, although approximately 90 cattle drowned. Damage in Brazoria, Galveston, and Harris counties surmounted $6.685 million. Additionally, impact in other areas increased the total losses to $7 million.
=== Early August tropical storm ===

A weakening cold front spawned a tropical depression on August 2 near the Outer Banks of North Carolina. The structure was broad, possibly akin to a subtropical cyclone. The storm quickly intensified based on ship reports, possibly to hurricane intensity, although the maximum sustained winds were estimated at . An approaching frontal boundary caused the storm to accelerate northeastward, while also bringing drier air into the windfield, causing weakening. On August 4, the storm transitioned into an extratropical cyclone, and for two days drifted toward Atlantic Canada before dissipating. The storm was added to the Atlantic hurricane database in 2016.
=== Tropical Storm Edith ===

A tropical wave was tracked east of the Lesser Antilles in mid-August. At 1530 UTC on August 17, a reconnaissance aircraft reported a weak center and winds of . Less than three hours later, a tropical depression developed while located east of the Windward Islands. The depression strengthened into Tropical Storm Edith early on August 18. The storm moved west-northwestward at a relatively quick pace, striking Dominica with winds peak winds of on August 18. By 1800 UTC on August 18, Edith peaked with winds of . It curved westward and accelerated on August 19. Edith weakened to a tropical depression at 1200 UTC, hours before dissipating near the southern tip of Dominican Republic. There was &quot;considerable doubt&quot; if a circulation ever existed. Squally weather and gusty winds were reported in some areas, including Guadeloupe, the Virgin Islands, Puerto Rico, and Hispaniola.
=== Late August tropical storm ===

A dissipating cold front spawned a low pressure over the central Atlantic Ocean on August 26. Moving slowly northward, the system organized into a tropical storm on August 28, and a day later, an approaching cold front turned the storm to the east-northeast. Based on ship observations, it is estimated that the storm reached peak winds of on August 31. By September 3, the storm transitioned into an extratropical cyclone as it interacted with the cold front, located halfway between Newfoundland and the Azores. A day later, the storm was absorbed by a larger extratropical storm southwest of Iceland. The storm was added to the Atlantic hurricane database in 2016.
=== September tropical storm ===

On September 6, a broad low pressure area developed between the Bahamas and Bermuda. The system moved northward, organizing into a tropical storm on September 9. The system had a large wind field, and was likely a subtropical cyclone. Moving northwestward at first, the storm turned to the northeast ahead of a cold front, with sustained winds of around . Nantucket island in Massachusetts reported sustained winds of during the storm&#x27;s passage. On September 11, the storm interacted with the cold front, becoming an extratropical storm, which lasted until September 14. The storm was added to the Atlantic hurricane database in 2016.
=== Hurricane Flora ===

A tropical wave passed through the islands of Cape Verde on September 6 and tracked westward at about . Early on September 9, a tropical depression developed while located about midway between Cape Verde and the Lesser Antilles. The depression moved northeastward and by September 10 it strengthened into Tropical Storm Flora. A reconnaissance aircraft flight into the storm on September 11 recorded winds of ; thus, Flora became a hurricane. Around the time, the storm attained its peak intensity with maximum sustained winds of the same velocity and a minimum barometric pressure of . Flora then accelerated northeastward toward the Azores. During another reconnaissance flight on September 12, no evidence of a tropical cyclone was reported. Thus, Flora became extratropical at 1200 UTC that day.
=== Hurricane Gracie ===
A tropical wave spawned a tropical depression north of Hispaniola on September 20. The depression remained offshore the island and moved west-northwestward. By September 22, it curved northeastward and became Tropical Storm Gracie. The storm then moved through The Bahamas, producing on Mayaguana. Later on September 22 Gracie intensified into a hurricane. It deepened further to a Category 2, on September 23, before weakening later that day. Gracie then meandered slowly and erratically while northeast of The Bahamas, before curving northwestward on September 27. It became a Category 2 hurricane again by September 28. During the next 24 hours, Gracie deepened significantly and peaked as a Category 4 hurricane. However, it weakened slightly to a Category 4 hurricane before making landfall on Edisto Island, South Carolina, at 1625 UTC on September 29. Gracie was one of the strongest tropical cyclones to strike South Carolina until Hurricane Hugo in 1989. It rapidly weakened inland, becoming extratropical on September 30.

Along the coast of South Carolina, the highest tide recorded was above mean low water at Charleston Harbor. On Folly Beach, all waterfront houses sustained some damage, while roads on the east side of the island were washed away. Gracie brought wind gusts as high as to the Beaufort area. Inland, winds lashed Walterboro. As much as 75% of Charleston County was left without electricity. Farther north, a F1 tornado damaged homes in Garden City. Throughout the South Carolina Lowcountry, 48 homes were destroyed, 349 homes suffered major damage, and 4,115 homes suffered minor damage. The remnants dropped rainfall and spawned tornadoes in several other states as it headed northeastward across the Mid-Atlantic and New England regions. In Virginia, three F3 tornadoes in Albemarle, Greene, and Fluvanna counties collectively caused 12 fatalities and 13 injuries. Precipitation from the storm peaked at in Big Meadows. Overall, Gracie caused 22 deaths and $14 million in damage.
=== Hurricane Hannah ===

After ships reported a low-level circulation, it was estimated that a tropical depression developed at 26.8°N, 49.9°W on September 27. Early on the following day, the depression strengthened into Tropical Storm Hannah. Reconnaissance aircraft flew into the storm late on September 28 and indicated that Hannah intensified into a Category 1 hurricane. Hannah moved generally westward at about . By September 30, the storm became a Category 2 hurricane, and it curved northwestward later that day. Hannah deepened to a Category 3 hurricane on October 1, hours before the storm reached its peak intensity with maximum sustained winds of and a minimum barometric pressure of . The storm maintained this intensity for about 48 hours and curved northeastward on October 2.

Hannah began to weaken late on October 3. By the following day, the storm fell to Category 2 hurricane intensity. It accelerated eastward or east-southeastward across the central Atlantic, starting on October 4. Hannah re-strengthened slightly to a Category 2 hurricane on October 5, but then slowly began weakening again. The final advisory on the storm was issued early on October 7, while it was centered about south-southwest of the Azores, however Hannah remained a tropical cyclone and crossed through the Azores later that day. No impact was reported in the islands. It weakened to a Category 1 hurricane early on October 8, and transitioned into an extratropical cyclone over the far northeastern Atlantic several hours later.
=== Tropical Storm Irene ===

In early October, a cold front drifted through Texas and entered the Gulf of Mexico. On October 5 the front dissipated while a related trough persisted. Upper-level air temperatures were generally warm, and a minimal anticyclone was situated over the Gulf. At this time, a Colorado low drew polar air into the Mississippi Valley, suggesting extratropical characteristics of the developing system. A tropical depression formed on October 6; it meandered in a north-northeasterly direction for the next two days. The storm intensified into Tropical Storm Irene around 1800 UTC on October 7. Around this time, a Hurricane Hunters flight indicated that the circulation was indistinct, although it was gradually evolving. On October 8, Irene made landfall near Pensacola, Florida, as a well-organized tropical storm. The storm rapidly weakened to a tropical depression, before dissipating early on October 9.

The highest tides, above normal, were reported at Cedar Key, Florida, while the strongest gust recorded, , was measured at Pensacola International Airport. Heavy rainfall from Irene spread across much of the Southern United States, peaking at in Neels Gap, Georgia. In Florida, flooding from rainfall associated with Irene caused damage around the Lake Okeechobee area. Losses in Florida was limited to uncollected crops, mainly peanuts and corn, that were in bales in the process of being dried. Several roads were flooded along the coast at Shalimar near Fort Walton Beach. The winds downed trees and a telephone pole, causing a short power outage in Ocean City. Red tides were ongoing in western Florida; winds from the storm&#x27;s precursor blew thousands of dead fish ashore. Local residents complained that the odor from the rotting fish were unbearable.
=== Hurricane Judith ===

A tropical wave developed into Tropical Storm Judith on October 17, near the Yucatán Channel. It strengthened quickly, and by early on October 18 the storm was upgraded to a Category 1 hurricane. However, six hours later Judith had weakened back to a tropical storm. Around 1800 UTC on October 18 the storm made landfall near Boca Grande, Florida, with winds of . After emerging into the Atlantic Ocean on the following day, Judith began re-strengthening while heading east-northeastward, reaching hurricane status several hours later. It peaked with winds of early on October 20, before weakening back to a tropical storm again on October 21. Judith weakened further, before transitioning into an extratropical cyclone later that day.

Impact from Judith was generally minor and limited mostly to Southwest Florida. Wind gusts up to toppled several trees on Sanibel Island and a few power poles; a man was injured when his car struck a fallen pole. Rough seas caused erosion on Captiva Island and in Fort Myers, while also inundating several roads in the area. A combination of locally heavy rainfall and tides caused minor flooding in low-lying areas. Precipitation from the storm peaked at in Miles City. The Imperial River overflowed near Bonita Springs, flooding pasture lands and washing out crops, most of which were recently planted. A portion of U.S. Route 41 was inundated by up to of water in Bonita Springs.
== Storm names ==

The following list of names was used for named storms (tropical storms and hurricanes) that formed in the North Atlantic in 1959. This was a completely new set of names, and most names used this season were used for the first time, all except: &quot;Edith&quot;, &quot;Flora&quot;, and &quot;Irene&quot;.

Additionally, this is the last designated storm names list to feature names starting with the letters &quot;Q&quot;, &quot;U&quot;, &quot;X&quot;, &quot;Y&quot;, and &quot;Z&quot;. As these designated storm letters were removed following the 1960 Atlantic Hurricane Season.

<text>Yanshi District () is a district in the prefecture-level city of Luoyang in western Henan province, China. Yanshi lies on the Luo River and is the easternmost county-level division of Luoyang.

==History==
After the Zhou conquest of Shang in mid-11th century BC, King Wu of Zhou founded a garrison town to the east of modern Yanshi to accommodate some of the campaigning troops. When Qin annexed Zhou in 256 BC, Yanshi County was established. The county&#x27;s borders underwent several changes over the course of history.

In 1993, Yanshi County became the county-level Yanshi City.

In 2021, it became Yanshi District of Luoyang City.

==Administrative divisions==
As of 2012, Yanshi is divided to 11 towns and 3 townships.

==Archaeological sites==
There are two important archaeological sites in this area.

===Erlitou site===
Erlitou, the type site of the Erlitou culture (1900–1500 BC), was discovered in Yanshi in 1959. Erlitou is the name of the modern village nearby; the traditional name of the settlement was Zhenxun (, &quot;Zhēnxún&quot;).

===Yanshi Shang City===
In 1983, a walled city dating from 1600 BC was found north-east of the Erlitou site in Yanshi&#x27;s Shixianggou Township. This city, now known as Yanshi Shang City (, &quot;Yǎnshī Shāngchéng&quot;), had an area of nearly and featured pottery characteristic of the Erligang culture. Some scholarsincluding the Xia–Shang–Zhou Chronology Projectidentify it with the first Shang dynasty capital, Western Bo (, &quot;Xībó&quot;) which was traditionally credited to King Tang after his defeat of the Xia dynasty.

<text>Pierre Antonini is a retired French mathematics professor and amateur astronomer who has discovered several minor planets and two supernovae at his private Observatoire de Bédoin (Bedoin Observatory; observatory code: 132) located at Bédoin, southeastern France. For many of his discoveries he used a 16-cm telescope or a 30-cm telescope.

He is a prolific discoverer of asteroids. The Minor Planet Center (MPC) credits him with the discovery of 35 numbered minor planets between 1997 and 1999. As of March 2016, the MPC ranks him 204th in the all-time, top-astronomer chart by number of discovered bodies. Antonini is also credited with the discovery of the supernovae and . In January 2004, he co-discovered S/2003 (1089) 1, a minor planet moon orbiting the main-belt asteroid 1089 Tama.

The 7-kilometer sized main-belt asteroid 12580 Antonini, discovered by Laurent Bernasconi in 1999, was named in his honour.

Narvi is about 7 kilometres in diameter, and orbits Saturn at an average distance of 19,371,000 km in 1006.541 days, at an inclination of 136.8° to the ecliptic (109° to Saturn&#x27;s equator), in a retrograde direction and with an eccentricity of 0.2990, very similar to Bestla&#x27;s orbit. Narvi&#x27;s rotation period is hours, and its light curve has three minima like Siarnaq and Ymir. Unlike the other triangular moons, however, one minimum is much higher than the others, and the maximum that is a half-period ahead is much lower.

== Naming ==
It was named in January 2005 after Narfi, a giant in Norse mythology. The name was approved by the IAU Working Group on Planetary System Nomenclature on 21 January 2005.

<text>Ronald Greenwood (11 November 1921 – 9 February 2006) was an English football player and manager. He is best known for being manager of the England national football team from 1977 until 1982, as well as being manager of West Ham United for 13 years, a time during which the club gained much of its fame.

==Early years==
Ron Greenwood was born at 15 Lennox Street, Worsthorne, near Burnley, Lancashire, but moved to London in 1931 during the Depression. He was educated at the Wembley County Grammar School which now forms part of Alperton Community School in Middlesex, leaving at the age of 14 to be an apprentice sign-writer. He served with an RAF mobile radio unit first of all in Northern Ireland and later in France during the Second World War.

==Playing career==
Greenwood played as a centre-half, joining Chelsea as an amateur whilst training as an apprentice sign-writer. During World War II he served in the Royal Air Force in Northern Ireland and guested for Belfast Celtic. In 1945, he left Chelsea for Bradford Park Avenue and made 59 league appearances over the next four seasons.

In 1949, Greenwood moved to the club he supported as a boy, Brentford, his £9,500 fee breaking the club&#x27;s incoming transfer record. He made 147 appearances and scored one goal. After three years at Brentford, he returned to Chelsea, where he played 66 times and won a First Division winners&#x27; medal in the 1954–55 season under Ted Drake. That summer, he moved to Fulham, where he made another 42 league appearances before retiring at the end of the 1955–56 season. He was never capped for his country, though he did make a single &#x27;B&#x27; team appearance, whilst at Brentford, in a 1–0 victory against the Netherlands on 23 March 1952 at the Olympisch Stadion in Amsterdam. At the end of his playing career in 1956, Greenwood became an active freemason, attending the Lodge of Proven Fellowship No. 6225, but resigned in 1977.

==Coaching career==
After retiring, Greenwood moved into coaching. He coached Eastbourne United, Oxford University (where he came to the attention of Sir Harold Thompson, a future Chairman of The Football Association), and England youth teams. He combined the England under-23 post with being the assistant manager at Arsenal under George Swindin, having moved to Highbury in December 1957. He remained there until April 1961, when he was selected by chairman Reg Pratt to replace Ted Fenton as manager of West Ham United.

Greenwood&#x27;s reign at West Ham brought them sizeable success. He oversaw the development of players such as the 1966 FIFA World Cup-winning trio of Bobby Moore, Geoff Hurst and Martin Peters, and under him the Hammers won the FA Cup in 1964 and the European Cup Winners&#x27; Cup in 1965 – the first two major trophies of their history. West Ham&#x27;s league form under Greenwood was less impressive, usually finishing in the lower half of the First Division table, though they did come sixth in the 1972–73 season. In his final season, West Ham finished 18th, just one point from relegation.

He moved upstairs in 1974, becoming the club&#x27;s general manager for the next three years, with John Lyall being placed in charge of the first team. In the first season of this arrangement, West Ham won another FA Cup.

After England coach Don Revie&#x27;s resignation, Greenwood was appointed in caretaker charge, completing England&#x27;s unsuccessful bid to qualify for the 1978 FIFA World Cup, and eventually becoming full-time manager in December 1977, ending his 16-year association with West Ham United. Under Greenwood, England qualified for UEFA Euro 1980, where they were knocked out in the group stage. England also qualified for the 1982 FIFA World Cup under Greenwood, their first World Cup in twelve years. England came through the tournament unbeaten, but were knocked out in the second group stage after 0–0 draws against West Germany and hosts Spain.

Greenwood retired from football after the 1982 World Cup, with the national coach&#x27;s job going to Bobby Robson. One major landmark during Greenwood&#x27;s tenure was the selection of the first black player for England, Viv Anderson, in 1978. Greenwood stated: &quot;Yellow, purple or black – if they&#x27;re good enough, I&#x27;ll pick them&quot;.

==Life after football==
After his career in football, Greenwood was a regular analyst on BBC Radio. He died of a heart attack on the morning on 9 February 2006, aged 84, after a long struggle with Alzheimer&#x27;s disease. When West Ham played Birmingham City in a Premier League fixture on 13 February 2006, a one-minute silence was held in Greenwood&#x27;s memory. West Ham won the game 3–0.

The Town Council of Loughton, where Greenwood lived during his time as West Ham manager, erected a blue plaque to his memory on one of his former houses in the town, 22 Brooklyn Avenue: this was unveiled by Sir Trevor Brooking and the Town Mayor, Chris Pond on 28 October 2008. The Heritage Foundation charity erected a blue plaque in Greenwood&#x27;s memory at West Ham&#x27;s Upton Park, which was unveiled by his family on 21 January 2007.

Greenwood was inducted into the English Football Hall of Fame in 2006, recognising his achievements as a manager in the English game. He is also a member of the FA and LMA Halls of Fame. He was survived by his widow, Lucy. He is buried in the Town Cemetery at Sudbury in Suffolk.

<text>Piero Sicoli (born 1954) is an Italian astronomer and discoverer of minor planets, observing at the Italian Sormano Astronomical Observatory. As the observatory&#x27;s coordinator, he is responsible for close encounters computation of near-Earth objects (NEOs), orbit computations, and identification of asteroids (about one thousand, included 17 NEOs). The Observatory&#x27;s focus is the examination and tracking of NEOs in Solar System.

The Nysa asteroid 7866 Sicoli, discovered by Edward Bowell at Anderson Mesa Station in 1982, is named in his honor.

<doc id="760544" wikidata="Q756739" url="?curid=760544" title="1960 Atlantic hurricane season">
<text>The 1960 Atlantic hurricane season was the least active season since 1952. The season officially began on June 15, and lasted until November 15. These dates conventionally delimit the period of each year when most tropical cyclones form in the Atlantic basin. The first system, an unnamed storm, developed in the Bay of Campeche on June 22. It brought severe local flooding to southeastern Texas and was considered the worst disaster in some towns since a Hurricane in 1945. The unnamed storm moved across the United States for almost a week before dissipating on June 29. In July, Hurricane Abby resulted in minor damage in the Leeward Islands, before impacting a few Central American counties — the remnants of the storm would go on to form Hurricane Celeste in the East Pacific. Later that month, Tropical Storm Brenda caused flooding across much of the East Coast of the United States. The next storm, Hurricane Cleo, caused no known impact, despite its close proximity to land.

The most significant storm of the season was Hurricane Donna, which at the time was among the ten costliest United States hurricanes. After the precursor caused a deadly plane crash in Senegal, the storm itself brought severe flooding and wind impacts to the Lesser Antilles and Florida, where Donna made landfall as a Category 4 hurricane. It moved northeast and struck North Carolina and Long Island, New York, while still at hurricane intensity. Donna caused at least 428 fatalities and $980 million (1960 USD) in damage. Hurricane Ethel reached Category 3 intensity, but rapidly weakened before making landfall in Mississippi, resulting in only 1 fatality and $1.5 million in losses. The final storm, Florence, developed on September 17. It remained weakened and moved erratically over Cuba and Florida. Only minor flooding was reported. Collectively, the tropical cyclones in 1960 caused at least 454 deaths and about $990.74 million in damage.

== Season summary ==
The Atlantic hurricane season officially began on June 15, 1960. It was a below-average season in which seven tropical depressions formed. All seven of the depressions attained tropical storm status, which was below the 1950–2000 average of 9.6 named storms. Four of these reached hurricane status, also falling short of the 1950–2000 average of 5.9. Furthermore, two storms reached major hurricane status, which is Category 3 or higher on the Saffir–Simpson hurricane wind scale. Two hurricane and four tropical storms made landfall during the season and caused 454 deaths and $410.74 million (1960 USD) in damage.

Season activity began on June 23, with the development of an unnamed tropical storm. Tropical cyclogenesis resumed in July with Hurricane Abby between July 10 and July 16, followed by Tropical Storm Brenda from July 28 to July 31. In mid-August, Hurricane Cleo developed and had an uneventful duration. At the end of that month, Hurricane Donna formed and lasted into mid-September; it was the strongest tropical cyclone of the season, peaking as a Category 4 hurricane. There was a Category 3 hurricane in September, Ethel, which briefly existed in the Gulf of Mexico. The last storm of the season, Tropical Storm Florence, dissipated on September 25, over a month before the official end of the season on November 15.

The season&#x27;s activity was reflected with an accumulated cyclone energy (ACE) rating of 73 units, the lowest value since 1956. ACE is, broadly speaking, a measure of the power of the hurricane multiplied by the length of time it existed, so storms that last a long time, as well as particularly strong hurricanes, have high ACEs. It is only calculated for full advisories on tropical systems at or exceeding or tropical storm strength.

== Systems ==

=== June tropical storm ===
Observations from a reconnaissance flight on June 22 indicated that a large area of showers and thunderstorms in the Gulf of Mexico was producing winds up to . Because no circulation was reported, it was operationally classified as a tropical low, though radar stations along the Gulf Coast of Mexico indicated a circulation. Thus, the system became a tropical depression at 0600 UTC on June 22, while located in the Bay of Campeche. The depression strengthened and was estimated to have become a tropical storm on June 23. By early on the following day, the storm peaked with winds of . Later that day, it made landfall near Corpus Christi, Texas at the same intensity. The storm weakened slowly and moved across the Central United States, before dissipating over Illinois on June 28.

In Texas, the storm dropped up to of precipitation in Port Lavaca. Thus considerable flooding occurred in some areas of south and eastern Texas. Throughout the state, more than 150 houses sustained flood damage in several counties. In addition, numerous major highways were closed, including portions of U.S. Routes 59, 87, 90, and 185, and Texas State Highways 35 and 71. In Arkansas, a few buildings in Hot Springs were damaged from high winds. Elsewhere, light to moderate rainfall was recorded in at least 11 other states, though damage was minimal. The storm was the wettest tropical cyclone on record in the state of Kentucky, dropping in Dunmor. Overall, the storm was attributed to 15 fatalities and $3.6 million in damage.
=== Hurricane Abby ===

A tropical wave developed into a tropical depression near the Windward Islands on July 10. That day, the depression intensified into Tropical Storm Abby, striking Saint Lucia with winds of . Abby tracked westward across the Caribbean Sea with little change in intensity. The storm brushed the northern coast of Honduras before intensifying into a hurricane on July 15, striking the offshore Roatán island with peak winds of . Later that day, Hurricane Abby made landfall in southern British Honduras (present day Belize). Abby quickly weakened inland, moving across Guatemala and coastal Mexico. On July 17, Abby dissipated over the Mexican state of Veracruz. However, the remnants later redeveloped into Hurricane Celeste in the eastern Pacific.

Abby produced tropical storm force winds and up to of precipitation in St. Lucia. Six people died when a roof of a house collapsed. Damage in St. Lucia reached $435,000, most of which was incurred to banana and coconut crops. In Martinique, wind gusts of and about of rain damaged 33% of banana and sugar cane crops. The resultant landslides from the precipitation extensively impacted roads and bridges. In Dominica, light winds and precipitation up to with damages reaching $65,000, entirely to roads and communications. Offshore islands of Honduras reported winds up to and light rainfall. Damage in British Honduras was light, with about $40,500 in losses, mostly to agriculture.
=== Tropical Storm Brenda ===
A weak low-pressure area in the Gulf of Mexico developed on July 26, organizing into Tropical Storm Brenda a day later. The minimal tropical storm moved ashore near Cross City, Florida on July 29, and moved northeastward along the east coast of the United States, gradually intensifying despite being largely over land. Later that day, the storm briefly moved offshore before striking southern North Carolina with peak winds of . After moving through the Mid-Atlantic states and New England, Brenda transitioned into an extratropical cyclone on July 31 over Maine. The remnants of Brenda interacted with another extratropical storm over eastern Canada before absorbing it. For about a week, the remnants of Brenda drifted and executed a large loop over northern Quebec, Labrador, and adjacent waters, eventually dissipating on August 7.

Brenda was considered the worst storm to strike West Central Florida since Hurricane Easy in 1950. It brought wind gusts up to and rainfall amounts reaching at the Tampa International Airport. While no casualties are directly blamed on the storm, at least one traffic-related death took place. According to an American Red Cross Disaster Service report encompassing eight Florida counties, 11 houses sustained significant damage, while 567 suffered more minor damage. Around 590 families were affected overall. Total monetary damage in Florida is placed at nearly $5 million. Further north, other states reported strong winds and locally heavy rainfall, though no significant damage occurred.
=== Hurricane Cleo ===

A strong tropical wave produced rainfall and gusty winds in The Bahamas and the Greater Antilles in mid-August. The wave was closely monitored for possible tropical cyclogenesis and special bulletins were issued by the United States Weather Bureau. At 1800 UTC on August 17, Tropical Storm Cleo developed near Cat Island in The Bahamas. The storm headed northeastward and immediately began to intensify. Operationally, the United States Weather Bureau at the hurricane warning center in Miami did not initiate advisories on Cleo until 1500 UTC on August 18. Sustained winds were already at the time, as recorded by a reconnaissance aircraft flight. By 1800 UTC on August 18, Cleo strengthened into a hurricane.

Throughout its duration, Cleo remained a relatively small tropical cyclone. Because the storm posed a significant threat to New England, a &quot;hurricane watch&quot; was issued for southeastern Massachusetts and Rhode Island on August 19. Various gale warnings were also put into effect from Block Island, Rhode Island, to Portland, Maine. However, this was unnecessary because Cleo remained well offshore. On August 19, Cleo peaked with winds of , but it weakened to a tropical storm the next day. Cleo curved east-northeastward on August 20, remaining south of Nova Scotia, until it dissipated a day later.
=== Hurricane Donna ===
A tropical wave in west Africa, blamed for 63 deaths in a plane crash in Senegal, developed into a tropical depression south of Cape Verde late on August 29. The depression strengthened into Tropical Storm Donna by the following day. Donna moved west-northwestward at roughly and by August 31, it reached hurricane status. Significant deepening occurred during the next 30 hours, with Donna being a moderate Category 4 hurricane by late on September 2. Thereafter, it weakened some and brushed the Lesser Antilles later that day. On Saint Maarten, the storm left a quarter of the island homeless and killed 7 people. An additional 5 deaths were reported in Anguilla and there were 7 other deaths throughout the Virgin Islands. In Puerto Rico, severe flash flooding led to 107 fatalities, 85 of them in Humacao alone. Donna further weakened to a Category 3 hurricane late on September 5, but eventually became a Category 4 hurricane again. While passing through The Bahamas, several small island communities in the central regions of the country were leveled, but no damage total or fatalities were reported.

Early on September 10, Donna made landfall near Marathon, Florida on Vaca Key with winds of , hours before another landfall between Fort Myers and Naples at the same intensity. Florida bore the brunt of Hurricane Donna. In the Florida Keys, coastal flooding severely damaged 75% of buildings, destroyed several subdivisions in Marathon. On the mainland, 5,200 houses were impacted, which does not include the 75% of homes damaged at Fort Myers Beach; 50% of buildings were also destroyed in the city of Everglades. Crop losses were also extensive. A total of 50% of grapefruit crop was lost, 10% of the orange and tangerine crop was lost, and the avocado crop was almost completely destroyed. In the state of Florida alone, there were 13 deaths and $300 million in losses. Donna weakened over Florida and was a Category 2 hurricane when it re-emerged into the Atlantic from North Florida. By early on September 12, the storm made landfall near Topsail Beach, North Carolina with winds of . Donna brought tornadoes and wind gusts as high as , damaging or destroying several buildings in Eastern North Carolina, while crops were impacted as far as inland. Additionally, storm surge caused significant beach erosion and structural damage Wilmington and Nags Head. There were 8 deaths and over 100 injuries. Later on September 12, Donna reemerged into the Atlantic Ocean and continued to move northeastward. The storm struck Long Island, New York late on September 12 and rapidly weakened inland. On the following day, Donna became extratropical over Maine.
=== September tropical storm ===

For several days, a weak low pressure area moved across the tropical Atlantic, which organized into a tropical storm on September 1 to the northeast of the Lesser Antilles. That day, peak winds were estimated at , based on reports from ships and the Hurricane Hunters. The storm moved northward and weakened. On September 3, the system was absorbed by an approaching cold front. The storm was added to the Atlantic hurricane database in 2016.
=== Hurricane Ethel ===
A trough was located over the Gulf of Mexico on September 8, which interacted with a weakening cold front to produce a low pressure area, and eventually a tropical depression on September 12. On the next day, the system intensified into Tropical Storm Ethel, which began a period of rapid intensification a day later. By late on September 14, Ethel reached peak winds of 115 mph (185 km), presenting a well-defined eye. Operationally, the Hurricane Hunters estimated winds of , making Ethel a Category 5 hurricane, although a reanalysis in 2016 downgraded Ethel to a Category 3. Cooler air caused a period of rapid weakening, and Ethel moved ashore near Pascagoula, Mississippi with sustained winds of . The storm gradually weakened after moving inland, before eventually dissipating over southern Kentucky on September 17.

In Louisiana, the outer bands of the storm produced light rainfall and hurricane-force winds, though no damage was reported in that state. Offshore Mississippi, rough seas inundated Horn Island and split Ship Island. Tropical storm force winds in the southern portion of the state littered broken glass, trees, and signs across streets in Pascagoula, as well as down power lines, which caused some residents to lose power. In Alabama, winds damaged beach cottages along the Gulf Coast, and damaged crops in the southern portion of the state. Although large amounts of rain fell in the extreme western portions of Florida, peaking at in Milton, no significant flooding occurred in Florida. A lightning strike to a power station near Tallahassee caused a brief citywide blackout. The storm spawned four tornadoes in Florida, one of which destroyed 25 homes. Outside the Gulf Coast of the United States, rain fell in eight others states, but no damage is known to have occurred. Overall, Ethel caused one fatality and $1.5 million in losses.
=== Tropical Storm Florence ===

A westward moving tropical wave developed into a tropical depression while located north of Puerto Rico on September 17. By the following day, the depression strengthened into Tropical Storm Florence. Later on September 18, Florence peaked as a tropical storm as it approached The Bahamas. However, unfavorable conditions weakened the storm back to a tropical depression on September 19. On September 21, Florence lost its surface circulation, and the disturbance executed a small cyclonic loop over Cuba. On September 23, the system redeveloped its surface center, and it became a tropical depression again, moving ashore Monroe County, Florida that day. The storm drifted northeastward across the state, re-intensifying into a tropical storm and reaching winds of . The storm turned back to the west-northwest and weakened again to a tropical depression. Florence moved across the northeastern Gulf of Mexico, moving ashore again near the Alabama-Florida border on September 26, and dissipating soon after.

On Grand Bahama, of rain fell in only 6 hours. The storm dropped rainfall across Florida, though the heavier amounts were mainly on the Atlantic coast. Precipitation peaked at near Fellsmere, while rainfall reached in some areas of the Miami metropolitan area. Although Florence was a depression at landfall, sustained winds between were recorded in Ocean Ridge, while a gust as high as was reported in Vero Beach. In Jacksonville, a pressure gradient combined with Florida to produce tides of about normal.
== Storm names ==
The following list of names was used for named storms that formed in the North Atlantic in 1960. Storms were named &quot;Abby&quot; and &quot;Donna&quot; for the first (and in the case of &quot;Donna&quot;, only) time in 1960.

=== Retirement ===

Following the 1960 season, the U.S. Weather Bureau retired the name &quot;Donna&quot; from its rotating Atlantic naming lists due to the damage and deaths it caused, and it will not be used again in the basin. &quot;Donna&quot; was replaced with &quot;Dora&quot; for the 1964 season.

== Season effects ==
This is a table of all of the storms that formed in the 1960 Atlantic hurricane season. It includes their name, duration, peak classification and intensities, areas affected, damage, and death totals. Deaths in parentheses are additional and indirect (an example of an indirect death would be a traffic accident), but were still related to that storm. Damage and deaths include totals while the storm was extratropical, a wave, or a low, and all of the damage figures are in 1960 USD.

<text>Murom (, ) is a historical city in Vladimir Oblast, Russia, which sprawls along the west bank of the Oka River. It borders Nizhny Novgorod Oblast and is situated from the administrative center Vladimir. Its population as of the 2021 Census was 107,497.

==History==
In the 9th century AD, the city marked the easternmost settlement of the East Slavs in the land of the Finnic Muromians. The &quot;Primary Chronicle&quot; mentions it as early as AD 862. It is, thus, one of the oldest cities in Russia. Circa 900 AD, it was an important trading post from Volga Bulgaria to the Baltic Sea.

Between AD 1010 and AD 1393, it was the capital of a separate principality, whose rulers included Saint Gleb, assassinated in AD 1015 and canonized in AD 1071, Saint Prince Konstantin the Blessed, and Saints Peter and Fevronia of Murom, subjects of an opera by Rimsky-Korsakov. It was believed to be the home town of the most celebrated East Slavic epic hero, Ilya Muromets. The town has a statue which shows Ilya holding the hilt of his sword in the left hand and a cross in the right.

On June 30, 1961, Murom was the site of a spontaneous protest and riot against the police and Soviet authorities, following the death in police custody of a senior factory foreman named Kostikov.

==Administrative and municipal status==
Within the framework of administrative divisions, Murom serves as the administrative center of Muromsky District, even though it is not a part of it. As an administrative division, it is incorporated separately as the Cit] of Murom — an administrative unit with the status equal to that of the districts. As a municipal division, the territory of the City of Murom together with nine rural localities in Muromsky District are incorporated as Murom Urban Okrug.

==Economy==
Murom has since 1941 and the Great Patriotic War against the Nazis played host to the JSC Murom instrument making plant (MIMP) which produces the means of initiation and ignition of ammunition, as well as various pyrotechnic devices. It is a subsidiary of Rostec State Corporation. The MIMP was sanctioned on 23.06.2023 in the EU&#x27;s 11th package of sanctions in response to Russia&#x27;s invasion of Ukraine.

==Sights==
Murom still retains many marks of antiquity. The Savior monastery, one of the most ancient in Russia, was first chronicled in 1096, when Oleg of Chernigov besieged it and killed Vladimir Monomakh&#x27;s son Izyaslav, who is buried there. In 1552, the monastery was visited by Ivan the Terrible who commissioned a stone cathedral, which was followed by other churches.

The Trinity convent, where the relics of Sts. Peter and Fevronia are displayed, features a fine cathedral (1642–1643), Kazan church (1652), a bell-tower (1652), a wooden church of St. Sergius, and stone walls. It is rivaled by the Annunciation Monastery, founded in the reign of Ivan the Terrible to house the relics of local princes and containing a cathedral from 1664. Two last-mentioned cathedrals, being probably the works of the same masters, have much in common with the Resurrection Church (1658) in the downtown. Quite different is the tent-like church of Sts. Cosmas and Damian, built in 1565 on the bank of the Oka to commemorate the Russian conquest of Kazan.

==International relations==

Murom is twinned with:
* Babruysk, Belarus

==Notable people==
Among notable natives are the father of color photography, Sergey Prokudin-Gorsky (1863), the painter Ivan Kulikov(1875) and the father of television, Vladimir Zworykin (1888) and Russian physicist Igor Irodov. Saints Peter and Fevronia.

<text>Park Street station is an MBTA subway station in Boston, Massachusetts. It is located at the intersection of Park Street and Tremont Street at the eastern edge of Boston Common in Downtown Boston. One of the two oldest stations on the &quot;T&quot; (the other is Boylston), and part of the oldest subway line in the United States, Park Street is the transfer point between the Green and Red lines, as one of the quartet of &quot;hub stations&quot; on the MBTA subway system. Park Street is the fifth-busiest station in the MBTA network, with an average of 16,571 entries each weekday in FY2019.

==History==
===Initial construction===
====Tremont Street subway====

The southern section of the Tremont Street subway from the Public Garden incline through Boylston to Park Street opened on September 1, 1897, followed on October 1 by the spur to the Pleasant Street Portal. The station was built with 4 tracks serving 2 island platforms; these were connected by two loops, allowing streetcars from the south and west to reverse direction and return to the portals and surface routes.

On September 3, 1898, the tunnel was extended to Scollay Square, Adams Square, Haymarket Square, and the Canal Street Incline. Some cars ran all the way through the tunnel on the outer tracks; others continued to loop at Park Street.

Boylston and Park Street were built with rectangular stone headhouses designed by Edmund M. Wheelwright that did not aesthetically match the Common. Unlike the interior decor, the headhouses were sharply criticized as &quot;resembling mausoleums&quot; and &quot;pretentiously monumental&quot;. Later stations on the East Boston Tunnel and Washington Street Tunnel used more modest headhouse designs in response to this criticism.

Electric destination indicator boards were first installed at Park Street in 1899, replacing an announcer with a megaphone. Signalmen used metal picks to complete a circuit, lighting up a numeral indicating which berth the car arriving on a given route would stop at.
====Main Line Elevated====

On June 10, 1901, the Main Line Elevated began running through the Tremont Street subway. The platforms at Park Street were retrofitted with raised wooden sections to allow elevated trains to run on the outer tracks to the Pleasant Street Portal, while streetcars continued to use the inner tracks and inner loop, entering the subway from the Public Garden incline. This arrangement lasted until Main Line service was moved to a separate tunnel under parallel Washington Street. Elevated trains last ran through the tunnel on November 28, 1908; they moved to the Washington Street Tunnel on November 30, and streetcar service returned to all tracks on December 4.
====Cambridge subway====
On March 23, 1912, the Cambridge subway opened from Harvard Square to Park Street Under. Park Street Under was built with two tracks with one side platform each and a center island platform, intended as a Spanish solution setup to speed boarding. Stairwells were added to the original platform level to connect to the lower-level platforms. Unlike most other underground stations on the system (which were cut and cover construction with low ceilings), Park Street Under featured a spacious double-vaulted ceiling.

It was the first transfer station on the system to receive the &quot;Under&quot; postfix, rather than a separate name from the existing station. This represented a change in naming policy, and the first step towards easing wayfinding difficulties in the complex system. North Station West (opened later in 1912), South Station Under (1916) and Scollay Under (1916) would later use this naming scheme. Construction of the Dorchester Tunnel begun on May 3, 1912; this extension opened to Washington on April 4, 1915, and in three more segments to South Station Under in 1916, Broadway in 1917, and Andrew in 1918.

Overcrowding had been a problem at Park Street since the Main Line was routed through it, and did not improve when it reverted to streetcar-only operations. The problem worsened with the influx of passengers transferring at Park Street Under, as the only entrances to those platforms were narrow staircases connecting through the streetcar level. In preparation for the Boylston Street subway and the extension of the Cambridge subway, the Boston Transit Commission substantially expanded the streetcar level. The platforms were extended to the south and straightened; the southbound platform was increased in area by one-half, and the northbound platform by three-eighths. The south headhouse of the southbound platform was moved south to the end of the expanded platform. The construction work began on August 7, 1914, and was completed on March 8, 1915.
===Later changes===

A loudspeaker system for announcements was added in 1921. The Park Street Information Booth on the upper level, which soon became a Boston landmark, opened on December 15, 1923, and replaced an earlier kiosk in the same location. On January 3, 1925, an explosion of celluloid film carried by a passenger injured dozens on a streetcar arriving at the station.

Although the 1914–15 renovation increased the platform area, the narrow stairways to the lower level still impeded passenger flow. The stairway between the lower center platform and the upper northbound platform was replaced with a pair of stairways – one over the other – in a project that was completed in August 1921. Widening of the stairs between the southbound platforms was completed on August 22, 1922. The stairway between the upper southbound platform and the lower northbound platform was doubled in width, with the bottom half split into two sets in opposite directions. That work – partially necessitated by capacity increases in the East Boston Tunnel – was completed on December 24, 1924. Finally, widening of the stairs between the upper northbound platform and the lower southbound platform was completed on May 27, 1925. These improvements reduced the amount of room available on the north ends of the streetcar platforms, and boarding areas were moved south.
In July 1922, the Boston Transit Commission proposed the addition of a side platform adjacent to the outer northbound streetcar track, with a passageway under Tremont Street leading to two new entrances at Temple Place. Opening the Winter Street Concourse to passengers was also proposed, but was soon rejected by the Department of Public Utilities in favor of continued use as storage space for adjacent businesses. A more ambitious 1927 plan by one of the BERy trustees called for new side platforms on both sides of the streetcar level, with a sub-passage connecting the four streetcar platforms, as well as the Temple Place entrances and Winter Street passageway. In 1933, the two stairway headhouses on the east side of Tremont Street were replaced with low walls, as had previously been done at Scollay Square and Adams Square.

In 1936, in response to still-persistent overcrowding, the Boston Transit Department constructed a new northbound side platform under Tremont Street with entrances at Temple Street. The project also added a sub-passage connecting the streetcar platforms and a passage connecting the new platform with the Cambridge Tunnel fare lobby opposite Park Street, but did not open the Winter Street Concourse. The new platform moved the northbound streetcar boarding area further south for the second time. A new lighting system was also installed. The project, funded by the Works Progress Administration, cost $407,000 (equivalent to $ in ). Work began on January 8, 1936, and the new platform was opened on December 5.

The 1947 state act that created the Metropolitan Transit Authority (MTA) from the Boston Elevated Railway established four immediate projects for the new agency, one of which was expansion of the Tremont Street subway to four tracks between Park Street and Scollay Square. As part of the plan, Park Street and Boylston stations were to be combined into a single Boston Common station, with a direct entrance from an underground parking garage. The garage ultimately opened in 1961, but the stations were not combined. The south headhouse on the northbound side was removed in 1963.

===MBTA era===

In 1964, the outer loop track was removed. Instead, a new crossover switch was installed to allow southbound streetcars from the through track to reach either side of the southbound platform. There have been proposals to reconnect the outer loop, to allow trains on the outer inbound track to be turned around at Park Street, but this has not been done because of the cost of structural reinforcements that would now be required. A short stub &quot;pit&quot; track for emergency service remains within the inner loop. In 1966, the south headhouse on the southbound platform was converted to an information booth for the new Freedom Trail, with only an exit provided from the station.

In 1967, as part of a general system rebranding by the newly formed MBTA, the subway lines were assigned colors. The streetcar system—then down to five branches, and soon four—became the Green Line, the Cambridge–Dorchester line became the Red Line, and the Main Line El became the Orange Line. In the 1970s, the MBTA began allowing street musicians to play in the station. Park Street was used as a filming location for &quot;See How She Runs&quot; (1978) and &quot;&quot; (1985–88); the sitcom &quot;Park Street Under&quot; (1979) was set in a fictional bar inside the station.

====1970s modernization====

The 1970s saw the first major renovations to the station in four decades. In 1972, the agency received a federal grant that funded two-thirds of a $14.3 million modernization program for downtown stations, included $4.2 million for Park Street. As part of that project, the MBTA investigated the feasibility of connecting , Park Street, Washington, and with pedestrian tunnels. Plans were released for the modernization of Park Street and three other downtown stations on August 27, 1975.

A $3.6 million contract was awarded on December 1, 1976. The 1936-built Temple Place entrance and passageway were closed that month, and concession stands were removed in 1977. The modernization included new wall tiles, new lighting, rebuilt staircases, and upgrades to the faregate area on the southbound platform. The work included the replacement of the remaining original copper headhouses with three modern glass-and-steel structures. Elevators to the fare lobby from the Red Line center platform and the surface were installed in 1979, making the Red Line section accessible. However, the surface elevator was frequently out of service due to repairs and other construction in the station. The aesthetics of the renovation were not well received; one longtime employee remarked the station resembled a billiard parlor.

The Winter Street Concourse, an upper level of the Dorchester Tunnel between Park Street and Downtown Crossing, was cleared of some non-public storage and office space, and opened as a pedestrian connector in January 1979. It allows passengers to walk from the northbound Green Line side platform at Park Street to the southbound Orange Line platform at Downtown Crossing while remaining inside fare control.

====Later changes====
From August 1981 to June 22, 1996, additional peak-hour Red Line trains ran between Quincy Center station and Park Street, using crossovers north of Park Street to reverse direction. Between November 30, 1981, and June 1982, Park Street was also the northern terminus of a small number of five-car trains (the first Red Line trains longer than four cars), as station platforms to the north were not yet extended for longer trains.

In the mid-1980s, the MBTA spent $80 million to extend the platforms of seven Red Line and three Orange Line stations to allow the use of six-car trains. The agency obtained a $22 million federal grant in 1984 to partially fund the , Park Street, and Washington station work. In 1985–86, the platforms at Park Street were extended to the north. Six-car trains began operation on January 21, 1988. Temporary artworks were placed in the station during the renovation as part of the Arts on the Line program. One work by Christopher Janney featured a synthesizer controlled by photoelectric sensors, placed so that passing passengers would interrupt the beams and change the sounds.

The MBTA opened bidding for an additional round of construction in March 1991; a $6 million contract was issued on July 10. The 1993-completed project included elevators to the Green Line sub-passage, completing elevator access to all platforms; however, Green Line trains were not yet accessible. The northbound Green Line headhouse was exit-only until June 20, 1992, when it was converted to also serve as an entrance. Around that time, a new south headhouse was built on the southbound side as the Freedom Trail information center was moved to a new structure nearby; it was exit-only until automated fare collection equipment was installed around 2007.

Around 2000, the MBTA outfitted the Green Line platforms with portable lifts as a temporary accessibility measure to serve the new low-floor Type 8 streetcars. A $15 million project to build raised low platforms at Park Street and began in 2001. The work at Park Street was done in segments to allow service to the station to continue during construction. Construction was completed in 2003.

New elevators from the surface to the westbound Green Line unpaid lobby and from the westbound Green Line platform to the Red Line island platform opened on December 21, 2012. They were built, and two other elevators rebuilt, as part of the 2006 settlement of &quot;Joanne Daniels-Finegold, et al. v. MBTA&quot;. In early 2019, the MBTA accepted bids for a $11.8 million renovation of Park Street station. The project includes replacement of all wayfinding signage and lighting, as well as the reopening of the 1976-closed Temple Place exit. Work began in April 2019 and was largely completed in December 2020 except for the exit. The elevator between the Red Line lobby and platform will be replaced beginning in 2025 as part of accessibility improvements at Downtown Crossing.

==Station layout==
Park Street is a bi-level station, with the Green Line running on the upper level and the Red Line on the lower level. The Green Line has four tracks numbered 1 to 4 (north to south). Tracks 1 and 2 serve an island platform for westbound trains. Tracks 3 and 4 serve an island platform for eastbound trains, with an additional side platform serving Track 4. Track 4 is used by all eastbound through trains; Track 3 is only used by trains terminating at Park Street, as it loops to rejoin Track 2. Both island platforms have headhouses and fare control areas on their northeast end; the westbound platform also has a headhouse at its southwest end. A sub-passage connects the middle of the three Green Line platforms. A passage from the eastbound side platform leads to a small fare lobby under Winter Street, with stairs to the surface and the Winter Street Concourse to Downtown Crossing.

The Red Line has two tracks: Track 5 southbound and Track 6 northbound. The Red Line has both island and side platforms; however, unlike the Spanish solution, all platforms are used for both boarding and alighting. Staircases connect each platform to both Green Line island platform and the fare lobby; exit-only escalators lead from the southern end of the side platforms to the surface. A backup control room for the subway system is located on the Green Line level over the middle of the Red Line platforms.

Park Street station is not a major bus transfer point, though MBTA bus route stops on Tremont Street at Temple Place. Silver Line route stops on Temple Place, midway between Park Street and Downtown Crossing; MBTA maps show the connection at Downtown Crossing.

===Accessibility===

Park Street station is accessible for passengers on all trains. Elevators connect the surface to the westbound Green Line platform, and to the fare lobby. The Red Line center platform has elevators to the westbound Green Line platform and to the fare lobby; the Red Line side platforms are not accessible. Elevators also connect the westbound Green Line platform and the eastbound side platform to the sub-passage. Because there are no elevators connecting the Red Line with the southbound Orange Line at Downtown Crossing, the accessible route for that transfer uses the Winter Street Concourse and the elevator at Park Street.

===Public art===
There are several pieces of public art in the station. &quot;Celebration of the Underground&quot; by Lilli Ann K. Rosenberg is a large wall mosaic along the outer outbound (westbound) tracks at the Green Line level, and can be viewed from the outbound island platform. The mosaic commemorates the designation of the Tremont Street subway, including Park Street station, as a National Historic Landmark. Created in 1978, it received renewed attention in 2020 after it was cleaned and better lit.

&quot;Benedictions&quot; by Ralph Helmick consists of two giant bronze hands each mounted separately over the inbound and outbound Red Line tracks on the lower level of the station. Each hand is posed in a classic gesture of benediction or blessing.

<text>Cupid is an inner satellite of Uranus. It was discovered by Mark R. Showalter and Jack J. Lissauer in 2003 using the Hubble Space Telescope. It was named after a character in William Shakespeare&#x27;s play &quot;Timon of Athens&quot;.

Cupid is the smallest known inner Uranian satellite (apart from possibly Mab), crudely estimated to be only about 18 km in diameter. This and the dark surface made it too dim to be detected by the &quot;Voyager 2&quot; cameras during its Uranus flyby in 1986.

The orbit of Cupid is separated by only 863 km from the orbit of the larger moon Belinda. Unlike Mab and Perdita—two Uranian satellites also discovered in 2003—it does not seem to be perturbed. Despite this, it has the least stable orbit of Uranus&#x27;s inner moons—it is likely to collide with Belinda in the next 100,000–10 million years, due to resonance interactions that cause the smaller Cupid to drift into a more dangerous orbit over this timescale.

Cupid is at most 500 million years old.

Following its discovery, Cupid was given the temporary designation S/2003 U 2. It is also designated Uranus XXVII.

<text>Marc William Buie (; born September 17, 1958) is an American astronomer and prolific discoverer of minor planets who works at the Southwest Research Institute in Boulder, Colorado in the Space Science Department. Formerly he worked at the Lowell Observatory in Flagstaff, Arizona, and was the Sentinel Space Telescope Mission Scientist for the B612 Foundation, which is dedicated to protecting Earth from asteroid impact events.

== Early life and education ==
Buie grew up in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, and received his B.Sc. in physics from Louisiana State University in 1980. He then switched fields and earned his Ph.D. in Planetary Science from the University of Arizona in 1984. Buie was a post-doctoral fellow at the University of Hawaii from 1985 to 1988. From 1988 to 1991, he worked at the Space Telescope Science Institute where he played a key role in the planning and scheduling of the first planetary observations ever made by the Hubble Space Telescope. Buie joined the staff at Lowell Observatory in 1991.

== Career ==
Since 1983, Pluto has been a central theme of research done by Buie, who has published over 85 scientific papers and journal articles. His first result was to prove that the methane visible on Pluto was on its surface and not part of its atmosphere. Since then he has worked on albedo maps of the surface, composition maps of Pluto and Charon, refinement of the orbits of Charon in addition to the much more recently discovered satellites, measurements of the structure of the atmosphere, and other measurements of the properties of the surfaces of Pluto and Charon. He is also one of the co-discoverers of Pluto&#x27;s moons, Nix and Hydra.

He has been working with the Deep Ecliptic Survey team who have been responsible for the discovery of over 1,000 Kuiper belt objects (KBOs). Beyond the work of just locating these objects, he additionally seeks to develop a better picture of the structure and nature of them. A spin-off project from this endeavor was his participation in the project to locate a Kuiper belt object that was within the range of NASA&#x27;s New Horizons mission after it passed by Pluto. This search led to the discovery of over 50 new KBOs, including 486958 Arrokoth, the object that New Horizons would eventually perform a close fly-by of on 1 January 2019. In the lead up to the fly-by, Buie also led a successful occultation campaign in Argentina and South Africa to observe Arrokoth as it passed in front of a distant star to refine the estimates of its size, shape, and orbit. Jim Green, NASA&#x27;s director of planetary science at the time, called the effort &quot;the most historic occultation on the face of the Earth.&quot;

In addition to his research into all aspects of Pluto and the Kuiper belt, Buie also works on studying transitional objects like 2060 Chiron and 5145 Pholus and occasionally comets, such as the recent Deep impact mission that went to Comet Tempel 1. In an effort closer to home, he also studies near-Earth asteroids to try to understand more about these potentially dangerous solar system neighbors. Most of these research efforts involve the use of Lowell Observatory telescopes in addition to occasional use of the Hubble and Spitzer Space Telescopes. He is also active in the development of state-of-the-art astronomical instrumentation having just completed the construction of an infrared imaging spectrograph, Mimir, in collaboration with Dan Clemens of Boston University.

Buie is a member of the American Astronomical Society (AAS) and its Division for Planetary Sciences (DPS), the American Geophysical Union (AGU), the International Astronomical Union (IAU), and the International Dark-Sky Association.

The inner main-belt asteroid 7553 Buie was named in the astronomer&#x27;s honor on 28 July 1999 (). He is also profiled as part of an article on Pluto in &quot;Air &amp; Space Smithsonian&quot; magazine.

<text>A solar chimney often referred to as a thermal chimney is a way of improving the natural ventilation of buildings by using convection of air heated by passive solar energy. A simple description of a solar chimney is that of a vertical shaft utilizing solar energy to enhance the natural stack ventilation through a building.

The solar chimney has been in use for centuries, particularly in the Middle East and Near East by the Persians, as well as in Europe by the Romans.

==Description==
In its simplest form, the solar chimney consists of a black-painted chimney. During the day solar energy heats the chimney and the air within it, creating an updraft of air in the chimney. The suction created at the chimney&#x27;s base can be used to ventilate and cool the building below. In most parts of the world it is easier to harness wind power for such ventilation as with a windcatcher, but on hot windless days a solar chimney can provide ventilation where otherwise there would be none.

There are however a number of solar chimney variations. The basic design elements of a solar chimney are:

* The solar collector area: This can be located in the top part of the chimney or can include the entire shaft. The orientation, type of glazing, insulation and thermal properties of this element are crucial for harnessing, retaining and utilizing solar gains.
* The main ventilation shaft: The location, height, cross section and the thermal properties of this structure are also very important.
* The inlet and outlet air apertures: The sizes, location as well as aerodynamic aspects of these elements are also significant.

A principle has been proposed for solar power generation, using a large greenhouse at the base rather than relying solely on heating the chimney itself. (For further information on this issue, see Solar updraft tower.)

Solar chimneys are painted black so that they absorb the sun&#x27;s heat more effectively. When the air inside the chimney is heated, it rises and pulls cold air out from under the ground via the heat exchange tubes.

== Solar chimney and sustainable architecture ==
Solar chimneys, also called heat chimneys or heat stacks, can also be used in architectural settings to decrease the energy used by mechanical systems (systems that heat and cool the building through mechanical means). For decades, air conditioning and mechanical ventilation have been the standard method of environmental control in many building types, especially offices, in developed countries. Pollution and reallocating energy supplies have led to a new environmental approach in building design. Innovative technologies along with bioclimatic principles and traditional design strategies are often combined to create new and potentially successful design solutions. The solar chimney is one of these concepts currently explored by scientists as well as designers, mostly through research and experimentation.

A solar chimney can serve many purposes. Direct sunlight warms air inside the chimney causing it to rise out the top and drawing air in from the bottom. This drawing of air can be used to ventilate a home or office, to draw air through a geothermal heat exchange, or to ventilate only a specific area such as a composting toilet.

Natural ventilation can be created by providing vents in the upper level of a building to allow warm air to rise by convection and escape to the outside. At the same time cooler air can be drawn in through vents at the lower level. Trees may be planted on that side of the building to provide shade for cooler outside air.

This natural ventilation process can be augmented by a solar chimney. The chimney has to be higher than the roof level, and has to be constructed on the wall facing the direction of the Sun. Absorption of heat from the Sun can be increased by using a glazed surface on the side facing the Sun. Heat absorbing material can be used on the opposing side. The size of the heat-absorbing surface is more important than the diameter of the chimney. A large surface area allows for more effective heat exchange with the air necessary for heating by solar radiation. Heating of the air within the chimney will enhance convection, and hence airflow through the chimney. Openings of the vents in the chimney should face away from the direction of the prevailing wind.

To further maximize the cooling effect, the incoming air may be led through underground ducts before it is allowed to enter the building. The solar chimney can be improved by integrating it with a trombe wall. The added advantage of this design is that the system may be reversed during the cold season, providing solar heating instead.

A variation of the solar chimney concept is the solar attic. In a hot sunny climate the attic space is often blazingly hot in the summer. In a conventional building this presents a problem as it leads to the need for increased air conditioning. By integrating the attic space with a solar chimney, the hot air in the attic can be put to work. It can help the convection in the chimney, improving ventilation.

The use of a solar chimney may benefit natural ventilation and passive cooling strategies of buildings thus help reduce energy use, CO2 emissions and pollution in general. Potential benefits regarding natural ventilation and use of solar chimneys are:
* improved ventilation rates on still, hot days
* reduced reliance on wind and wind driven ventilation
* improved control of air flow through a building
* greater choice of air intake (i.e. leeward side of building)
* improved air quality and reduced noise levels in urban areas
* increased night time ventilation rates
* ventilation of narrow, small spaces with minimal exposure to external elements

Potential benefits regarding passive cooling may include:

* improved passive cooling during warm season (mostly on still, hot days)
* improved night cooling rates
* enhanced performance of thermal mass (cooling, cool storage)
* improved thermal comfort (improved air flow control, reduced draughts)

==Precedent Study: The Environmental Building==
The Building Research Establishment (BRE) office building in Garston, Watford, United Kingdom, incorporates solar-assisted passive ventilation stacks as part of its ventilation strategy.

Designed by architects Feilden Clegg Bradley, the BRE offices aim to reduce energy consumption and CO2 emissions by 30% from current best practice guidelines and sustain comfortable environmental conditions without the use of air conditioning. The passive ventilation stacks, solar shading, and hollow concrete slabs with embedded under floor cooling are key features of this building. Ventilation and heating systems are controlled by the building management system (BMS) while a degree of user override is provided to adjust conditions to occupants&#x27; needs.

The building utilizes five vertical shafts as an integral part of the ventilation and cooling strategy. The main components of these stacks are a south facing glass-block wall, thermal mass walls and stainless steel round exhausts rising a few meters above roof level. The chimneys are connected to the curved hollow concrete floor slabs which are cooled via night ventilation. Pipes embedded in the floor can provide additional cooling utilizing groundwater.

On warm windy days air is drawn in through passages in the curved hollow concrete floor slabs. Stack ventilation naturally rising out through the stainless steel chimneys enhances the air flow through the building. The movement of air across the chimney tops enhances the stack effect.
During warm, still days, the building relies mostly on the stack effect while air is taken from the shady north side of the building. Low-energy fans in the tops of the stacks can also be used to improve airflow.

Overnight, control systems enable ventilation paths through the hollow concrete slab removing the heat stored during the day, which then remains cold for the following day. The exposed curved ceiling gives more surface area than a flat ceiling would, acting as a heat sink, again providing summer cooling.
Research based on actual performance measurements of the passive stacks found that they enhanced the cooling ventilation of the space during warm and still days and may also have the potential to assist night-time cooling due to their thermally massive structure.

==Passive down-draft cool tower==

A technology closely related to the solar chimney is the evaporative down-draft cooltower. In areas with a hot, arid climate this approach may contribute to a sustainable way to provide air conditioning for buildings.

The principle is to allow water to evaporate at the top of a tower, either by using evaporative cooling pads or by spraying water. Evaporation cools the incoming air, causing a downdraft of cool air that will bring down the temperature inside the building. Airflow can be increased by using a solar chimney on the opposite side of the building to help in venting hot air to the outside. This concept has been used for the Visitor Center of Zion National Park. The Visitor Center was designed by the High Performance Buildings Research of the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL).

The principle of the downdraft cooltower has been proposed for solar power generation as well. (See Energy tower for more information.)

Evaporation of moisture from the pads on top of the Toguna buildings built by the Dogon people of Mali, Africa, contribute to the coolness felt by the men who rest underneath. The women&#x27;s buildings on the outskirts of town are functional as more conventional solar chimneys.

<text>A stele ( ) or stela ( ) is a stone or wooden slab, generally taller than it is wide, erected in the ancient world as a monument. The surface of the stele often has text, ornamentation, or both. These may be inscribed, carved in relief, or painted.

Stelae were created for many reasons. Grave stelae were used for funerary or commemorative purposes. Stelae as slabs of stone would also be used as ancient Greek and Roman government notices or as boundary markers to mark borders or property lines. Stelae were occasionally erected as memorials to battles. For example, along with other memorials, there are more than half-a-dozen steles erected on the battlefield of Waterloo at the locations of notable actions by participants in battle.

A traditional Western gravestone (headstone, tombstone, gravestone, or marker) may technically be considered the modern equivalent of ancient stelae, though the term is very rarely applied in this way. Equally, stele-like forms in non-Western cultures may be called by other terms, and the words &quot;stele&quot; and &quot;stelae&quot; are most consistently applied in archaeological contexts to objects from Europe, the ancient Near East and Egypt, China, and sometimes Pre-Columbian America.

==History==

Steles have also been used to publish laws and decrees, to record a ruler&#x27;s exploits and honors, to mark sacred territories or mortgaged properties, as territorial markers, as the boundary steles of Akhenaton at Amarna, or to commemorate military victories. They were widely used in the ancient Near East, Mesopotamia, Greece, Egypt, Somalia, Eritrea, Ethiopia, and, most likely independently, in China and elsewhere in the Far East, and, independently, by Mesoamerican civilisations, notably the Olmec and Maya.

The large number of stelae, including inscriptions, surviving from ancient Egypt and in Central America constitute one of the largest and most significant sources of information on those civilisations, in particular Maya stelae. The most famous example of an inscribed stela leading to increased understanding is the Rosetta Stone, which led to the breakthrough allowing Egyptian hieroglyphs to be read. An informative stele of Tiglath-Pileser III is preserved in the British Museum. Two steles built into the walls of a church are major documents relating to the Etruscan language.

Standing stones (menhirs), set up without inscriptions from Libya in North Africa to Scotland, were monuments of pre-literate Megalithic cultures in the Late Stone Age. The Pictish stones of Scotland, often intricately carved, date from between the 6th and 9th centuries.

An obelisk is a specialized kind of stele. The Insular high crosses of Ireland and Great Britain are &quot;specialized steles&quot;. Totem poles of North and South America that are made out of stone may also be considered a specialized type of stele. Gravestones, typically with inscribed name and often with inscribed epitaph, are among the most common types of stele seen in Western culture.

Most recently, in the &quot;Memorial to the Murdered Jews of Europe&quot; in Berlin, the architect Peter Eisenman created a field of some 2,700 blank steles. The memorial is meant to be read not only as the field, but also as an erasure of data that refer to memory of the Holocaust.

===Egypt===
Egyptian steles (or Stelae, Books of Stone) have been found dating as far back as the First Dynasty of Egypt. These vertical slabs of stone are used as tombstones, for religious usage, and to mark boundaries, and are most commonly made of limestone and sandstone, or harder kinds of stone such as granite or diorite, but wood was also used in later times.

Stele fulfilled several functions. There were votive, commemorative, and liminal or boundary stelae, but the largest group was the tomb stelae. Their picture area showed the owner of the stele, often with his family, and an inscription listed the name and titles of the deceased after a prayer to one, or several, of the gods of the dead and request for offerings. Less frequently, an autobiographical text provided additional information about the individual&#x27;s life.

In the mastaba tombs of the Old Kingdom (2686 - 2181 BC), stelae functioned as false doors, symbolizing passage between the present and the afterlife, which allowed the deceased to receive offerings. These were both real and represented by formulae on the false door.

Liminal, or boundary, stele were used to mark size and location of fields and the country&#x27;s borders. Votive stelae were exclusively erected in temples by pilgrims to pay homage to the gods or sacred animals. Commemorative stelae were placed in temples by the pharaoh, or his senior officials, detailing important events of his reign. Some of the most widely known Egyptian stelae include: the Kamose Stelae, recounting the defeat of the Hyksos; the Victory Stele, describing the campaigns of the Nubian pharaoh Piye as he reconquered the country; the Restoration Stele of Tutankhamun (1336 - 1327 BC), detailing the religious reforms enacted after the Amarna period; and the Merneptah Stele, which features the first known historical mention of the Israelites. In Ptolemaic times (332 - 30 BC), decrees issued by the pharaoh and the priesthood were inscribed on stelae in hieroglyphs, demotic script and Greek, the most famous example of which is the Rosetta Stone.

===Urartu===
Urartian steles were freestanding stone obelisks that served a variety of purposes, erected in the Iron Age kingdom which existed in the Armenian Highlands of modern Armenia, Turkey and Iran between the 9th and 6th centuries BC. Some were located within temple complexes, set within monumental rock-cut niches (such as the niche of the Rock of Van, discovered by Marr and Orbeli in 1916), or erected beside tombs. Others stood in isolated positions and, such as the Kelashin Stele, had a commemorative function or served as boundary markers. Although sometimes plain, most bore a cuneiform inscription that would detail the stele&#x27;s function or the reasons for its erection. The stele from Van&#x27;s &quot;western niche&quot; contained annals of the reign of Sarduri II, with events detailed yearly and with each year separated by the phrase &quot;For the God Haldi I accomplished these deeds&quot;. Urartian steles are sometimes found reused as Christian Armenian gravestones or as spolia in Armenian churches - Maranci suggests this reuse was a deliberate desire to capitalize on the potency of the past. Some scholars have suggested Urartian steles may have influenced the development of the Armenian khachkar.

===Greece===

Greek funerary markers, especially in Attica, had a long and evolutionary history in Athens. From public and extravagant processional funerals to different types of pottery used to store ashes after cremation, visibility has always been a large part of Ancient Greek funerary markers in Athens. Regarding stelai (Greek plural of stele), in the period of the Archaic style in Ancient Athens (600 BC) stele often showed certain archetypes of figures, such as the male athlete. Generally their figures were singular, though there are instances of two or more figures from this time period. Moving into the 6th and 5th centuries BC, Greek stelai declined and then rose in popularity again in Athens and evolved to show scenes with multiple figures, often of a family unit or a household scene. One such notable example is the Stele of Hegeso. Typically grave stelai are made of marble and carved in relief, and like most Ancient Greek sculpture they were vibrantly painted. For more examples of stelai, the Getty Museum&#x27;s published Catalog of Greek Funerary Sculpture is a valuable resource

===China===

Steles (Chinese: &quot;bēi&quot; ) have been a major medium of stone inscription in China, the earliest examples dating from the Qin dynasty. Chinese steles are generally rectangular stone tablets upon which Chinese characters are carved intaglio with a funerary, commemorative, or edifying text. They can commemorate talented writers and officials, inscribe poems, portraits, or maps, and frequently contain the calligraphy of famous historical figures. In addition to their commemorative value, many Chinese steles are regarded as exemplars of traditional Chinese calligraphic scripts, especially the clerical script.

Chinese steles from before the Tang dynasty are rare: there are a handful from before the Qin dynasty, roughly a dozen from the Western Han, 160 from the Eastern Han, and several hundred from the Wei, Jin, Northern and Southern, and Sui dynasties. During the Han dynasty, tomb inscriptions (, &quot;mùzhì&quot;) containing biographical information on deceased people began to be written on stone tablets rather than wooden ones.

Erecting steles at tombs or temples eventually became a widespread social and religious phenomenon. Emperors found it necessary to promulgate laws, regulating the use of funerary steles by the population. The Ming dynasty laws, instituted in the 14th century by its founder the Hongwu Emperor, listed a number of stele types available as status symbols to various ranks of the nobility and officialdom: the top noblemen and mandarins were eligible for steles installed on top of a stone tortoise and crowned with hornless dragons, while the lower-level officials had to be satisfied with steles with plain rounded tops, standing on simple rectangular pedestals.

Steles are found at nearly every significant mountain and historical site in China. The First Emperor made five tours of his domain in the 3rd century BC and had Li Si make seven stone inscriptions commemorating and praising his work, of which fragments of two survive. One of the most famous mountain steles is the high stele at Mount Tai with the personal calligraphy of Emperor Xuanzong of Tang commemorating his imperial sacrifices there in 725.

A number of such stone monuments have preserved the origin and history of China&#x27;s minority religious communities. The 8th-century Christians of Xi&#x27;an left behind the Xi&#x27;an Stele, which survived adverse events of the later history by being buried underground for several centuries. Steles created by the Kaifeng Jews in 1489, 1512, and 1663, have survived the repeated flooding of the Yellow River that destroyed their synagogue several times, to tell us something about their world. China&#x27;s Muslim have a number of steles of considerable antiquity as well, often containing both Chinese and Arabic text.

Thousands of steles, surplus to the original requirements, and no longer associated with the person they were erected for or to, have been assembled in Xi&#x27;an&#x27;s Stele Forest Museum, which is a popular tourist attraction. Elsewhere, many unwanted steles can also be found in selected places in Beijing, such as Dong Yue Miao, the Five Pagoda Temple, and the Bell Tower, again assembled to attract tourists and also as a means of solving the problem faced by local authorities of what to do with them. The long, wordy, and detailed inscriptions on these steles are almost impossible to read for most are lightly engraved on white marble in characters only an inch or so in size, thus being difficult to see since the slabs are often 3m or more tall.

There are more than 100,000 surviving stone inscriptions in China. However, only approximately 30,000 have been transcribed or had rubbings made, and fewer than those 30,000 have been formally studied.

===Maya stelae===

Maya stelae were fashioned by the Maya civilization of ancient Mesoamerica. They consist of tall sculpted stone shafts or slabs and are often associated with low circular stones referred to as altars, although their actual function is uncertain. Many stelae were sculpted in low relief, although plain monuments are found throughout the Maya region. The sculpting of these monuments spread throughout the Maya area during the Classic Period (250–900 AD), and these pairings of sculpted stelae and circular altars are considered a hallmark of Classic Maya civilization. The earliest dated stela to have been found &quot;in situ&quot; in the Maya lowlands was recovered from the great city of Tikal in Guatemala. During the Classic Period almost every Maya kingdom in the southern lowlands raised stelae in its ceremonial centre.

Stelae became closely associated with the concept of divine kingship and declined at the same time as this institution. The production of stelae by the Maya had its origin around 400 BC and continued through to the end of the Classic Period, around 900, although some monuments were reused in the Postclassic (–1521). The major city of Calakmul in Mexico raised the greatest number of stelae known from any Maya city, at least 166, although they are very poorly preserved.

Hundreds of stelae have been recorded in the Maya region, displaying a wide stylistic variation. Many are upright slabs of limestone sculpted on one or more faces, with available surfaces sculpted with figures carved in relief and with hieroglyphic text. Stelae in a few sites display a much more three-dimensional appearance where locally available stone permits, such as at Copán and Toniná. Plain stelae do not appear to have been painted nor overlaid with stucco decoration, but most Maya stelae were probably brightly painted in red, yellow, black, blue and other colours.

=== Cambodia ===

Khmer inscriptions are a corpus of post-5th century historical texts engraved sometimes on steles, but more generally on materials such as stone and metal ware found in a wide range of mainland Southeast Asia (Cambodia, Vietnam, Thailand and Laos) and relating to the Khmer civilization. The study of Khmer inscriptions is known as Khmer epigraphy.

Khmer inscriptions are the only local written sources for the study of ancient Khmer civilization.

More than 1,200 Khmer inscriptions of varying length have been collected. There was an &#x27;explosion&#x27; of Khmer epigraphy from the seventh century, with the earliest recorded Khmer stone inscription dating from 612 AD at Angkor Borei.

===Ireland===

Ogham stones are vertical grave and boundary markers, erected at hundreds of sites in Ireland throughout the first millennium AD, bearing inscriptions in the Primitive Irish language. They have occasionally been described as &quot;steles.&quot;

===Horn of Africa===

The Horn of Africa contains many stelae. In the highlands of Ethiopia and Eritrea, the Axumites erected a number of large stelae, which served a religious purpose in pre-Christian times. One of these granite columns is the largest such structure in the world, standing at 90 feet.

Additionally, Tiya is one of nine megalithic pillar sites in the central Gurage Zone of Ethiopia. As of 1997, 118 stele were reported in the area. Along with the stelae in the Hadiya Zone, the structures are identified by local residents as &quot;Yegragn Dingay&quot; or &quot;Gran&#x27;s stone&quot;, in reference to Imam Ahmad ibn Ibrahim al-Ghazi (Ahmad &quot;Gurey&quot; or &quot;Gran&quot;), ruler of the Adal Sultanate.

The stelae at Tiya and other areas in central Ethiopia are similar to those on the route between Djibouti City and Loyada in Djibouti. In the latter area, there are a number of anthropomorphic and phallic stelae, which are associated with graves of rectangular shape flanked by vertical slabs. The Djibouti-Loyada stelae are of uncertain age, and some of them are adorned with a T-shaped symbol.

Near the ancient northwestern town of Amud in Somalia, whenever an old site had the prefix &quot;Aw&quot; in its name (such as the ruins of Awbare and Awbube), it denoted the final resting place of a local saint. Surveys by A.T. Curle in 1934 on several of these important ruined cities recovered various artefacts, such as pottery and coins, which point to a medieval period of activity at the tail end of the Adal Sultanate&#x27;s reign. Among these settlements, Aw Barkhadle is surrounded by a number of ancient stelae. Burial sites near Burao likewise feature old stelae.

<text>Terence Frederick Venables (6 January 1943 – 25 November 2023), often referred to as El Tel, was an English football player and manager who played for clubs including Chelsea, Tottenham Hotspur and Queens Park Rangers and won two caps for England.

As a manager, Venables won the Second Division championship with Crystal Palace in 1979. He reached the 1982 FA Cup Final with Queens Park Rangers and won the Second Division in 1983. With Barcelona, he won La Liga in 1985 and reached the 1986 European Cup Final. He guided Tottenham Hotspur to victory in the 1991 FA Cup Final. He also managed Middlesbrough and Leeds United. 

As the England national team manager from 1994 to 1996, he reached the semi-finals of the 1996 European Championships. His tactical style was modern and innovative, which was a contrast to the rigid tactical style that dominated English football at the time. Venables also had good personal relationships with the squad. He managed Australia from 1996 to 1998.

==Early life==
Terence Frederick Venables was born at 313 Valence Avenue, Dagenham, Essex on 6 January 1943, the only child of Fred and Myrtle Venables. His father was a Navy petty officer who originally came from Barking. His mother was Welsh, from Clydach Vale. When he was 13, his parents moved to run a pub in Romford, Essex, sending him to live with his maternal grandparents Ossie and Milly, who fostered his love of football.

==Club career==
Venables progressed from representing his county to earning caps for England Schoolboys, and attracted interest from Chelsea, Tottenham Hotspur, West Ham United and Manchester United.

===Chelsea===
Venables left school in the summer of 1958 and signed for Chelsea as an apprentice at the age of 15. He later said that he joined Chelsea as he felt he had a better chance of breaking into the first team at Stamford Bridge, and also because the club offered his father a job as a part-time scout, and he denied West Ham&#x27;s youth coach Malcolm Allison&#x27;s claim that he had only joined Chelsea for financial reasons. He delayed becoming a professional player so he could try for a place on the Great Britain squad for the 1960 Summer Olympics, and turned professional after learning that he would not be selected for the squad. He won the FA Youth Cup with Chelsea in consecutive seasons, as they beat Preston North End in 1960 and Everton in 1961. He made his much anticipated senior debut in a 4–2 defeat to West Ham United on 6 February 1960, with newspapers billing him as &quot;the new Duncan Edwards&quot;.

Tommy Docherty joined Chelsea as player-coach in September 1961, and went on to replace Ted Drake as manager the following month. Docherty proved to be a successful manager at the club, promoting younger players who became known as &quot;Docherty&#x27;s Diamonds&quot;, and was a highly influential coach in Venables&#x27; career, but the pair had a difficult relationship, and Venables believed Docherty to be tactically limited. Chelsea were relegated at the end of the 1961–62 season, but managed to gain promotion out of the Second Division at the first attempt with a second-place finish in 1962–63. They went on to finish fifth in the First Division in the 1963–64 season. He took his FA coaching badges at the age of 24, passing with distinction and a 95% pass mark.

Venables went on to lift the League Cup with Chelsea, and scored a penalty against Leicester City in the two-legged final. Chelsea also reached the semi-finals of the FA Cup in 1964–65, where they were knocked out by Liverpool. With three games left to play they were also in with an outside chance of overtaking Manchester United and Leeds United to win the league title, but Chelsea lost the first of these games 2–0 to Liverpool at Anfield. Docherty reversed his decision to allow the players a night out after the game, but Venables and seven other players (George Graham, Barry Bridges, John Hollins, Marvin Hinton, Eddie McCreadie, Joe Fascione and Bert Murray) broke curfew and went for a brief night out. Upon their return to the team hotel Docherty suspended all eight players for the remainder of the season. Chelsea then lost 6–2 to Burnley, before Docherty reinstated the players for a final-day defeat to Blackpool. Venables never forgave Docherty for the punishment, describing it as &quot;crass, stupid and self-defeating&quot;. Docherty placed Venables on the transfer list towards the end of the 1965–66 season, with Chelsea again losing an FA Cup semi-final and heading towards a fifth-place finish.

===Tottenham Hotspur===
Venables was signed by Tottenham Hotspur for a fee of £80,000, and made his debut for the club in a 1–0 win at Blackburn Rovers on 9 May 1966. He soon made his presence felt when he punched club legend Dave Mackay during training, though no long-term rift developed because of the incident. Spurs went on to have a good 1966–67 season though, finishing third in the league and beating Millwall (after a replay), Portsmouth, Bristol City, Birmingham City (after a replay) and Nottingham Forest to reach the 1967 FA Cup Final to face his former club Chelsea at Wembley Stadium. Spurs won the cup with a 2–1 victory, Jimmy Robertson and Frank Saul providing the goals before Bobby Tambling scored a late consolation goal for Chelsea. Earlier in the season Venables had bet £25 on Chelsea to win the cup at odds of 25/1, which would have paid out £500 if Spurs had lost the game, exactly the same figure as the £500 cup bonus he would receive for winning the match; after tax deductions, Venables would have been better off financially if Chelsea had won.

Venables did not enjoy a great relationship with his manager, believing Bill Nicholson to have a negative attitude that drained him of enthusiasm. He also believed that he was not appreciated by the Spurs fans. The club dropped to seventh- and sixth-place finishes in 1967–68 and 1968–69, and Nicholson accepted an offer of £70,000 for Venables from Queens Park Rangers on 20 June 1969.

===Queens Park Rangers===
Venables later said that his transfer to Second Division QPR changed his life, and stated that &quot;I cannot think of a transfer blessed with so much good fortune&quot;. Initially, Rangers could only manage mid-table finishes in the 1969–70 and 1970–71 campaigns, with Venables scoring 18 goals in 83 games. Chairman Jim Gregory opted to sack Les Allen and appoint Gordon Jago as manager, who took Rangers up to fourth-place in 1971–72 – just two points behind promoted Birmingham City. Once coach Bobby Campbell departed Loftus Road for Arsenal, Jago allowed Venables to supervise the club&#x27;s training sessions. Rangers continued to progress, and won promotion in 1972–73 after securing runners-up spot with an 11-point gap over third-place Aston Villa.

===Crystal Palace===
Venables signed with Crystal Palace in 1974; he and Ian Evans were traded to Palace in exchange for Don Rogers. He made 14 Third Division appearances in the 1974–75 season before retiring due to arthritis on New Year&#x27;s Eve. Manager Malcolm Allison gave him a coaching role for the second half of the campaign.

===St Patrick&#x27;s Athletic===
Venables played for League of Ireland side St Patrick&#x27;s Athletic for a short period between February and March 1976.

==International career==

As well as receiving two international caps, Venables held the distinction of being the only footballer to play for England at schoolboy, youth, amateur, Under-23, and for the full international team; as the amateur team was disbanded in 1974 no player was ever able to match his record. He was named by Alf Ramsey on the list of 33 &quot;possibles&quot; for the 1966 FIFA World Cup, having won two caps in 1964 – a 2–2 draw with Belgium and a 1–1 draw with the Netherlands, but did not make it into the final squad of 22.

==Managerial career==

===Crystal Palace===
Venables worked as Malcolm Allison&#x27;s coach for the 1975–76 season, when Palace reached the semi-finals of the FA Cup; however they lost the semi-final tie with Southampton and their subsequent league form suffered as they slipped back to fifth-place. Venables succeeded Allison as manager in June 1976. It proved to be a busy month for Venables, as he turned down the surprise offer to walk out on Palace to succeed Bertie Mee as Arsenal manager and also had a para-sailing accident in Majorca which required 40 stitches.

As Crystal Palace manager, Venables built a young team of mostly youth team players and free transfer signings which the media dubbed the &quot;Team of the Eighties&quot;. Star winger Peter Taylor was sold on to Spurs for £200,000, but most of this sum went on balancing the club&#x27;s books. Venables spent £1,500 to sign striker Rachid Harkouk from Feltham, coming up with half of this sum out of his own funds on the understanding that he would receive 50% of any future transfer fee for the player. By March 1977, the board found enough money for Venables to purchase Jeff Bourne from Derby County for £30,000, and Bourne ended the 1976–77 campaign with nine goals in 15 games to help Palace to secure the third and final automatic promotion place.

His team adjusted well to the Second Division and finished in ninth-place in 1977–78, before going on to win promotion as champions in 1978–79. They secured the title with a final day victory over Burnley in a rearranged fixture some days after all their promotion rivals had completed their fixtures; the win meant that they leapfrogged Brighton &amp; Hove Albion, Stoke City and Sunderland, and they denied their M23 derby rivals from the south coast what would have been their club&#x27;s highest honour.

His first season as a manager in the First Division, in the 1979–80 season, started successfully, and on 29 September, Crystal Palace were top of the English Football League for one week. They ended back down in 13th-place, which was at that time the club&#x27;s highest ever league finish.

The following season started badly for Venables; expensive high-profile signings failed to gel, and by October 1980, Palace were bottom of the First Division, attendance was plummeting and the club was in financial difficulties. Venables left during October to join Second Division Queens Park Rangers; although the exact reasons behind his sudden departure have never been made clear.

===Queens Park Rangers===
Venables left Palace, in the top division, for Queens Park Rangers, who were in the Second Division. His departure from Selhurst Park coincided with a decline in form for Palace, who were relegated at the end of the season and did not regain their top flight status for another eight years. Venables drew a number of players over to Queens Park Rangers which, as reported at the time, gave an additional financial boost to his personal earnings.

Venables took QPR back into the First Division as Second Division champions in 1983. He also guided Rangers to the FA Cup final in 1982, whilst still a Second Division side, but lost in a replay against his former club Tottenham.

His final season as QPR manager, 1983–84, brought more success as they finished fifth in the league (their highest finish since they were runners-up in 1976) and qualified for the UEFA Cup. Venables then moved to Spain to take over at Barcelona, while Alan Mullery took over from him at Loftus Road in an ill-fated arrangement that lasted just six months.

===Barcelona===
Venables gained a good reputation as a manager with his successes at Crystal Palace and QPR, and this attracted offers from some of Europe&#x27;s most prestigious clubs. In 1984, Venables took the role of manager at Barcelona, earning the sobriquet &quot;El Tel&quot; by the English tabloid newspapers. He was recommended by Bobby Robson and Doug Ellis to Joan Gaspart, the F.C. Barcelona vice-president at the time. Venables used a very English system, a classic 4–4–2, which took advantage of outstanding defenders like Gerardo, Migueli and Julio Alberto, and a hard-working midfield led by West German Bernd Schuster. During his three seasons in Catalonia, Venables led the club to the Spanish league title in 1985 (their first since 1974). He also won the 1986 Copa de la Liga, and led them to the Copa del Rey final in 1986 losing to Real Zaragoza.

Barcelona also reached the 1986 European Cup Final, although they lost to Steaua București in a penalty shoot-out following a 0–0 draw. It was Barcelona&#x27;s first appearance in a European Cup final since 1961 and had been achieved after one of the most dramatic European Cup semi-finals in the history of the competition. Venables&#x27; side overcame a 3–0 first-leg defeat to Swedish club IFK Göteborg, winning the second-leg of the 1986 semi-final at the Camp Nou in a penalty shoot-out after a 3–3 aggregate score.

Venables brought two British strikers to Barcelona in 1986 – Gary Lineker from Everton and Mark Hughes from Manchester United. Lineker was a great success at the Camp Nou, scoring 21 goals during his first season, including a hat-trick in a 3–2 win over Real Madrid. Lineker spent three years at Barcelona, until Venables brought him back to England with his new club Tottenham Hotspur in 1989. Hughes was less successful and spent just one season in the Barcelona side, before being loaned to Bayern Munich.

Venables was dismissed by Barcelona in September 1987, after failing to repeat his title success at the Camp Nou and losing home and away to eventual finalists Dundee United in the quarter-finals of the UEFA Cup six months earlier.

===Tottenham Hotspur===
On 23 November 1987, he returned to England to manage Tottenham Hotspur. His success with the Spurs team was varied, with the side finishing in mid-table for most of his tenure, though they did win the FA Cup in 1991 and finished third in the league in 1990. Venables had brought both Gary Lineker and Paul Gascoigne to Spurs and was a favourite to replace Bobby Robson as England national football team manager when the job became vacant in 1990, but doubts about his probity led him to be passed over in favour of Graham Taylor.

After a failed £20m bid to take over Spurs with Larry Gillick, Venables was appointed chief executive by Alan Sugar, who had won the takeover battle against Robert Maxwell in June 1991. Over the next two seasons, the Spurs team was managed by Peter Shreeves and then the joint management team of Ray Clemence and Doug Livermore, with the final arrangement seeing Venables having more involvement with the first team. A clash of personalities developed and Sugar dismissed Venables on 14 May 1993, over his business dealings. After gaining a temporary injunction, he was reinstated, but lost a three-day high court hearing and ordered to pay costs.

===England===
Venables was appointed manager of the England national team on 28 January 1994, having been recommended to the FA by Jimmy Armfield. He came under intense scrutiny and censure in the media for his business dealings, which led MP Kate Hoey to state in Parliament that Venables was unfit for the post of national team manager. He appointed Bryan Robson, Don Howe and Mike Kelly as coaches, and put Dave Sexton in charge of the England under-21 team. He took England to a second-place finish in the Umbro Cup in June 1995, but temporarily froze Paul Ince out of the international set-up after Ince declined to play in the tournament.

As England automatically qualified for UEFA Euro 1996 as hosts, he organised friendlies to allow him to experiment and find his best squad for the tournament, and particularly to find the best tactical system to suit the players. Venables decided to stand down at the end of Euro 1996 after the FA&#x27;s International Committee chairman Noel White refused to grant Venables a contract extension in December 1995; the FA insisted on evaluating England&#x27;s performances in competitive fixtures before deciding on his future. In May 1996, Glenn Hoddle was announced as his successor, meaning that Venables would have no choice but to stand down as manager no matter how well England performed at the tournament.

Having selected David Platt as captain during the friendly matches, Venables decided to appoint Tony Adams as captain for Euro 1996. He stood by his players in the face of media criticism before and during the tournament, which grew particularly intense after Paul Gascoigne and several others were photographed drunk in a nightclub during a team stay in Hong Kong; Venables went so far as to accuse some reporters as being &quot;traitors&quot; for what he described as a &quot;witch-hunt&quot; against England players. England drew with Switzerland in the opening group game before beating Scotland 2–0 and the Netherlands 4–1. After his retirement, Venables described the win over the Netherlands as &quot;perfection – my most thrilling experience in football&quot;. England advanced past Spain in the quarter-finals with a victory on penalties, before being eliminated by Germany on penalties at the semi-finals following a 1–1 draw and a missed penalty by Gareth Southgate.

According to Alan Shearer, who played for Venables at Euro &#x27;96, &quot;Terry&#x27;s knowledge and tactical know-how were spot-on and he knew how to get the best out of us too. We responded to him, believed in him and played some outstanding football in that tournament.&quot; Southgate said, &quot;Terry opened my eyes to things that no one else has. He has fantastic tactical awareness. Every senior player in the group went away having learnt a lot from him, which is an achievement.&quot; On the Euro &#x27;96 team, Rob Smyth wrote in &quot;The Guardian&quot;, &quot;Under the managership of Terry Venables, this was an admirably enlightened, flexible and relaxed England side, one for the modern age; they even played a genuine 3–5–2... against Scotland and Germany. But they still weren&#x27;t actually that good.&quot; Smyth argued there were &quot;only two decent performances&quot; by England in the tournament, against the Netherlands and Germany.

===Australia===
Venables became manager of Australia in November 1996, following the resignation of Eddie Thomson. In the 1997 Confederations Cup, Venables led Australia to the final before defeat to Brazil. His side swept through the Oceania World Cup qualifiers, but were beaten in November 1997 in a play-off by Iran. The teams drew the first leg 1–1 in Tehran. Australia led the second leg 2–0 early in the second half, but they conceded two late goals to miss out on qualification for the 1998 World Cup on the away goals rule. Venables&#x27; tenure as Australia coach ended the following June. While Australia had never made the top 50 in the FIFA Men&#x27;s World Ranking before his tenure, they reached the top 30 under him.

===Return to Crystal Palace===
In summer 1998, he returned to Crystal Palace who had just been taken over by Mark Goldberg. Venables left acrimoniously in January 1999, as the south-London club went into administration. His appointment had created a media frenzy, with Goldberg boasting that he was going to turn Palace into a European force within the next five years. After a spell of inconsistent results the Goldberg dream of building Palace as a force was over in January 1999 when Venables was released as the club faced financial problems and narrowly avoided going out of business, although they did at least finish in a secure position in Division One.

===Middlesbrough===
Having been linked with Chelsea weeks earlier, Venables was appointed head coach at Middlesbrough in December 2000 in a bid to help the club avoid relegation. Venables had initially turned down the offer due to his media and business interests, but he accepted when Middlesbrough offered him the job on a short-term basis. Incumbent manager Bryan Robson remained at the club, but Venables made team selection decisions. Results improved under Venables, and the club eventually avoided relegation by finishing in 14th place. Venables left Middlesbrough in June 2001, soon after Robson, with the club saying that his media commitments made it impossible for him to continue. Venables had signed a new five-year contract with ITV Sport in May 2001.

===Leeds United===
In July 2002, Venables was released from his ITV punditry job to become Leeds United manager on a two-year deal, replacing the sacked David O&#x27;Leary. Two weeks into his tenure, defender Rio Ferdinand was sold to Manchester United for £30 million as the Elland Road club sought to clear £78 million of debt. The team were knocked out of the Football League Cup by second-tier Sheffield United in the second round; Neil Warnock&#x27;s Sheffield United would also defeat Leeds in that season&#x27;s FA Cup.

Leeds were further weakened in January 2003, when Jonathan Woodgate was sold to Newcastle United without Venables being informed, in an attempt to pay off mounting debts. Venables threatened to leave if Woodgate was sold, but was persuaded to stay by Peter Ridsdale. With the club spiralling towards relegation, and amid later substantiated rumours of further player sales by the board, Venables was sacked in March 2003.

===Later career===
Venables was linked with Australian club Newcastle Jets in 2005, but his commitments in the UK prevented him from taking up a role within the club, and his agent announced that he did not sign any deal with the club. At the end of the 2005–06 season, he was linked with a return to Middlesbrough, but decided that at his age he would be unable to manage a Premier League club full-time. Later in the year, Venables returned to the England set-up as assistant to new manager Steve McClaren. He was later sacked from this role in November 2007, along with McClaren, after England failed to qualify for Euro 2008.

Venables was later linked in the media with many managerial vacancies, including those at the Republic of Ireland, Bulgaria, Queen&#x27;s Park Rangers, Hull City, and Wales. He turned down an offer to manage Newcastle United on a caretaker basis in September 2008, following the departure of Kevin Keegan. In 2012, he was hired by non-League club Wembley as a technical adviser.

==Managerial style and reputation==
Venables described himself as a &quot;players&#x27; man&quot;, who gave players freedom off the pitch and defended them if they were criticised in the media. He was reluctant to praise players during his half-time team talks to avoid complacency, and believed it was important to keep his words brief and the tone light-hearted so players could take on board key points and remain in good spirits for the second half. In 2007, Rob Smyth of &quot;The Guardian&quot; described Venables&#x27; tactical approach with England at Euro 96 as &quot;flexible&quot; and &quot;modern&quot;, noting his use of the 3–5–2 formation in certain matches. At Barcelona, Venables had employed a &quot;classic English&quot; 4–4–2 formation, utilising strong defenders, a hard-working midfield, and opportunistic forwards. 

Following his death, Phil McNulty of BBC Sport wrote that Venables was known for his &quot;superb man-management style and his razor-sharp tactical acumen&quot;, saying that he was &quot;one of football&#x27;s brightest minds and most innovative coaches&quot;. Gary Lineker considered Venables &quot;the best English coach we&#x27;ve had&quot; and likened him to Pep Guardiola, saying, &quot;he was charming, charismatic, witty but he was also tough — and that&#x27;s what you needed to be. He understood football — he had an incredible football brain.&quot; Bryan Robson called him &quot;a great motivator and communicator&quot;, and Gary Neville said that Venables&#x27; ability &quot;to change systems during matches and from game to game was incredible, it blew my mind&quot;. Neville added in a social media post that he was required to play in different roles under Venables throughout Euro 96, depending on the opponent, including as a right-back (his typical role), a right-sided centre-back, a right-sided wing-back, and a right winger. Ange Postecoglou, the current head coach of Tottenham Hotspur, said, &quot;If you are asking about a person who embodies everything this football club has always wanted to be, it is Terry. It wasn&#x27;t just about the way he managed or coached; it was the person he was... but the biggest testament is that anyone who I have ever come across that has worked with him will say he is by far the best coach, manager and tactician they have come across.&quot;

According to Luke Ginnell, writing for football magazine &quot;FourFourTwo&quot;, Venables&#x27; career &quot;arguably promised more than it delivered&quot;, and he was dubbed the &quot;False Messiah&quot; by sports writer Mihir Bose. &quot;The Times&quot; described Venables as a &quot;wide boy with a history of trouble off the pitch&quot;. According to Richard Williams, &quot;those who distrusted Venables were shouted down by those who had actually played under him, and who regard him—with rare unanimity—as possessing one of this country&#x27;s very few exceptional football intellects.&quot; Writing for &quot;The Observer&quot; in 2004, Bill Borrows questioned why Venables, &quot;who has won so little and failed at so much,&quot; was &quot;considered by his peers to be &#x27;synonymous with success&#x27;.&quot; Borrows wrote, &quot;He has lost a couple of big games on penalties and even led Spurs to third in the League. But, in truth, his record isn&#x27;t good enough, certainly when compared to the best managers, such as Brian Clough.&quot;

==Personal life==
Venables married Christine McCann, a dressmaker, in 1966. They had two daughters before divorcing in 1984. He met his second wife Yvette Bazire in 1984, in his father&#x27;s pub in Chingford, Greater London. She accompanied him to Barcelona when he was appointed their manager and they married in 1991. She managed his Kensington dining club, Scribes West, for seven years. He sold it in 1997.

===Business interests===
One of his first business ventures was to open a tailors in the West End of London, along with Chelsea teammates George Graham and Ron &#x27;Chopper&#x27; Harris; the business proved unsuccessful and eventually filed for bankruptcy.

On 14 January 1998, he was disqualified by the high court from acting as a company director for seven years under section 8 of the Company Directors Disqualification Act 1986 for mismanagement of four companies – Scribes West Ltd, Edenote plc, Tottenham Hotspur plc and Tottenham Hotspur Football and Athletic Company Ltd. The case was brought by the Department of Trade and Industry, who cited instances of bribery, lying, deception, manipulation of accounts and taking money that should have been given to creditors. 

Venables combined his duties with Australia for a period as consultant and then chairman at Portsmouth. He purchased a 51% controlling interest in the club for £1 in February 1997, but left in controversial circumstances 11 months later. His company Vencorp received a £300,000 bonus in the summer of 1997 and he is thought to have been paid around £250,000 upon leaving the club, but he left them bottom of Division One. Although Portsmouth avoided relegation 1997–98, their financial situation worsened and they were in real danger of bankruptcy, until being taken over by Milan Mandarić in late 1999.

In 2014, together with his wife, Venables opened a boutique hotel and restaurant in Penàguila, in the Alicante region of Spain. It was sold in early 2019 when they decided to retire.

===Other work===
Venables served the Professional Footballers&#x27; Association as vice-chairman in the 1970s, and represented QPR teammate Dave Thomas at his tribunal against Burnley chairman Bob Lord. 

He co-authored five novels with writer Gordon Williams: &quot;They Used to Play on Grass&quot; (1972), &quot;The Bornless Keeper&quot; (1974), &quot;Hazell Plays Solomon&quot; (1974), &quot;Hazell and the Three Card Trick&quot; (1975), and &quot;Hazell and the Menacing Jester&quot; (1976). He used the pseudonym &quot;P.B. Yuill&quot; after completing the first book as he felt critics dismissed his contribution to &quot;They Used to Play on Grass&quot; as a gimmick. &quot;They Used to Play on Grass&quot; was voted at #172 in the BBC&#x27;s &quot;The Big Read&quot; survey in 2003. He is credited as co-creator of the ITV detective series &quot;Hazell&quot;. 

Having been a football pundit for BBC since the mid-80s, he left for ITV in 1994, following a legal dispute with the corporation over allegations made against him in a &quot;Panorama&quot; programme. In 1990, Venables co-devised the board game, &quot;Terry Venables invites you to be... The Manager&quot;.

Venables parents were both talented singers who encouraged their son to take it up. At the age of 17 he entered a singing competition at Butlins in Clacton-on-Sea, although Chelsea did not allow him to compete in the final stages. In 2002, he recorded a single for the World Cup together with the band Rider. &quot;England Crazy&quot; reached number 46 in the UK charts. In 2010, he recorded a cover of the Elvis Presley song &quot;If I Can Dream&quot; in association with British newspaper &quot;The Sun&quot;. It featured a 60-piece Royal Philharmonic Orchestra with the video shot on The O2 Arena&#x27;s roof while another video, used for the Sun&#x27;s TV advert, featured Harry Redknapp and Ian Wright as part of the choir and was filmed at Wembley Stadium. The song reached number 23 in the UK charts on 13 June.

===Death===
Venables died on 25 November 2023, at the age of 80, following a long illness. On 26 November, Tottenham Hotspur announced that its players would be wearing black armbands, and that there would be a minute&#x27;s applause in his honour at their home game against Aston Villa that day.

<doc id="760576" wikidata="Q150694" url="?curid=760576" title="Nonane">
<text>Nonane is a linear alkane hydrocarbon with the chemical formula C9H20. It is a colorless, flammable liquid, occurring primarily in the component of the petroleum distillate fraction commonly called kerosene, which is used as a heating, tractor, and jet fuel. Nonane is also used as a solvent, distillation chaser, fuel additive, and a component in biodegradable detergents. It is also a minor component of diesel fuel. 

Nonane has 35 structural isomers. 

Its substituent form is nonyl. Its cycloalkane counterpart is cyclononane, (C9H18).

Unlike most alkanes, the numeric prefix in its name is from Latin, not Greek. (A name using a Greek prefix would be enneane.)

==Combustion reactions==
Nonane undergoes combustion reactions that are similar to other alkanes. In the presence of sufficient oxygen, nonane burns to form water and carbon dioxide.

:C9H20 + 14O2 → 9CO2 + 10H2O

When insufficient oxygen is available for complete combustion, the burning products include carbon monoxide.

:2C9H20 + 19O2 → 18CO + 20H2O

<text>Mab, or Uranus XXVI, is an inner satellite of Uranus. It was discovered by Mark R. Showalter and Jack J. Lissauer in 2003 using the Hubble Space Telescope. It was named after Queen Mab, a fairy queen from English folklore who is mentioned in William Shakespeare&#x27;s play &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot;.

Because the moon is small and dark, it was not seen in the heavily scrutinized images taken by &quot;Voyager 2&quot; during its Uranus flyby in 1986. However, it is brighter than another moon, Perdita, which was discovered from Voyager&#x27;s photos in 1997. This led scientists to re-examine the old photos again, and the satellite was finally found in the images. Following its discovery, Mab was given the temporary designation S/2003 U 1.

The size of Mab is not precisely known. If it is as dark as Puck, it is about in diameter. On the other hand, if it has a relatively bright surface like the neighbouring moon Miranda, it would be smaller than Cupid and comparable to the smallest outer satellites. Infrared observation published in 2023 suggest that Mab is probably a 12-km body with a Miranda-like surface, rich in water ice; though not leaving out the possibility of it being a 24-km body with a Puck-like surface.

Mab is heavily perturbed. The actual source for perturbation is still unclear, but is presumed to be one or more of the nearby orbiting moons.

Mab orbits at the same distance from Uranus as the μ ring (formerly known as R/2003 U 1), a dusty ring discovered around the same time as Mab. The moon is nearly the optimal size for dust production, since larger moons can recollect the escaping dust and smaller moons have too small surface areas for supplying the ring via ring particle or meteoroid collisions. No rings associated with Perdita and Cupid have been found, probably because Belinda limits the lifetimes of dust they generate.

<text>C. Michelle Olmstead (born 21 May 1969) is an American astronomer, asteroid discoverer and computer scientist.

==Early life and education==

Olmstead attended Northern Arizona University as an undergraduate student in physics and astronomy from 1989-1993, where she was a NASA undergraduate fellow and participated in several asteroid astrometry programs and made measurements using existing survey work.

==Career==

She is credited by the Minor Planet Center with the discovery of 46 asteroids for the period between 1977 and 1990. In 1990, with Henry E. Holt, she co-discovered 127P/Holt-Olmstead, a periodic comet that bears her name. 

The minor planet 3287 Olmstead, a Mars-crosser asteroid discovered by astronomer Schelte J. Bus in 1981, was named in her honour. Her lowest numbered discovery, , officially discovered at Palomar Observatory in 1978, and presumably taken on photographic plates by Tom Gehrels shortly after the last Palomar–Leiden Survey campaign, had its discovering astrometric observation published on 12 September 1992 ().

<doc id="760589" wikidata="Q756742" url="?curid=760589" title="1961 Atlantic hurricane season">
<text>The 1961 Atlantic hurricane season was a very active Atlantic hurricane season, with an accumulated cyclone energy (ACE) total of 189, the highest since 1950 and until being surpassed by 1995. The season, however, was an average one in terms of named storms. The season featured eight hurricanes and a well above average number of five major hurricanes. It was previously thought that the season had a record-tying seven major hurricanes, before the Atlantic hurricane reanalysis project downgraded two storms in 2019. Two Category 5 hurricanes were seen in 1961, making it one of only eight Atlantic hurricane seasons to feature multiple Category 5 hurricanes in one season. The season started on June 15, and ended on November 15. These dates conventionally delimit the period of each year when most tropical cyclones form in the Atlantic basin. The first system, an operationally unclassified tropical depression, formed offshore east Central Florida on June 10, but dissipated a few days later. Next, Hurricane Anna developed in the eastern Caribbean Sea near the Windward Islands on July 20. It brought minor damage to the islands in, as well as wind and flood impacts to Central America after striking Belize as a hurricane. Anna caused one death and about $300,000 (1961 USD) in damage. Activity went dormant for nearly a month and a half, until Hurricane Betsy developed on September 2. Betsy peaked as a Category 4 hurricane, but remained at sea and caused no impact.

One of the most significant storms of the season was Hurricane Carla, which peaked as a Category 4 hurricane, before striking Texas. Carla caused 43 deaths and approximately $325.74 million in damage. Hurricane Debbie was a Category 1 storm that existed in the eastern Atlantic Ocean. Early in its duration, unsettled weather from Debbie in Cape Verde resulted in a plane crash and the death of 60 people. The extratropical remnants of Debbie then brushed Ireland, causing severe damage over the British Isles. The next storm, Hurricane Esther, threatened to strike New England as a major hurricane, but rapidly weakened and made landfall in Massachusetts as only a tropical storm. Impact was generally minor, with about $6 million in damage and seven deaths, all of which from a United States Navy plane crash. An unnamed tropical storm and Hurricane Frances caused minimal impact on land. In mid-October, Tropical Storm Gerda brought flooding to Jamaica and eastern Cuba, resulting in twelve deaths.

Another significant storm was Hurricane Hattie, a late-season Category 5 hurricane that struck Belize. Hattie caused 319 confirmed fatalities and about $60.3 million in damage. Destruction was so severe in Belize that the government had to relocate inland to a new city, Belmopan. In early November, the depression that would later strengthen into Hurricane Jenny brought light rainfall to Puerto Rico. The final storm, Tropical Storm Inga, dissipated on November 8, after causing no impact on land. On September 11, three hurricanes existed simultaneously – Betsy, Carla, and Debbie – the most on a single day in the Atlantic basin since 1893 and until 1998. Collectively, the storms of the 1961 Atlantic hurricane season caused about $392.34 million in damage and at least 437 fatalities.

== Season summary ==
The Atlantic hurricane season officially began on June 15. It was an above average season in which twelve tropical storms formed; this was above the 1950–2000 average of 9.6 named storms. Eight of these reached hurricane status, also above of the 1950–2000 average of 5.9. Furthermore, five storms reached major hurricane status. It was originally believed that the season had seven major hurricanes, though later analysis resulted in a downgrade of two storms. Of the five major hurricanes, two became Category 5 hurricanes. Four hurricanes and two tropical storms made landfall during the season, causing 348 deaths and $391.6 million in damage. Hurricane Debbie also caused damage and deaths, despite remaining offshore and then after becoming extratropical.

Tropical cyclogenesis began with an initially unclassified tropical depression, which developed on June 10. More than a month later, Hurricane Anna formed on July 17 and dissipated on July 24. Thereafter, no other systems developed in July or the month of August. A lack of cyclonic activity in the Atlantic basin in August is rare, with such phenomenon not occurring again until the 1997 and 2022 seasons. The Atlantic basin remained dormant until Hurricane Betsy developed on September 2. During the next four days, two other tropical cyclones formed – Carla and Debbie. On September 11, the three storms – Betsy, Carla, and Debbie – existed simultaneously as hurricanes, the most in a single day since 1893 and until 1998. Esther, which developed on September 10, did not reach hurricane status until September 12. Later that day, a tropical storm that went unnamed formed over the Bahamas and moved across the East Coast of the United States for its brief duration.

After Debbie became extratropical on September 14, another tropical cyclone developed over two weeks later, Hurricane Frances. Thereafter, tropical cyclogenesis slowed in October, which featured only three systems, a second previously unclassified tropical depression, Gerda, and Hattie. The latter was the strongest tropical cyclone of the season, peaking with maximum sustained winds of and a minimum barometric pressure of . After weakening slightly, Hattie struck Belize on October 31, before dissipating on November 1. Later that day, Hurricane Jenny developed northeast of Antigua. Jenny remained weak for much of its duration and became extratropical on November 8. The final system, Tropical Storm Inga, formed in the Gulf of Mexico on November 4. Four days later, Inga dissipated, one week before the season officially ended.

The season&#x27;s activity was reflected with an accumulated cyclone energy (ACE) rating of 189, one of the highest values recorded. ACE is, broadly speaking, a measure of the power of the hurricane multiplied by the length of time it existed, so storms that last a long time, as well as particularly strong hurricanes, have high ACEs. It is only calculated for full advisories on tropical systems at or exceeding , which is the threshold for tropical storm strength.

== Systems ==
=== Hurricane Anna ===
A tropical wave that emerged into the Atlantic from the west coast of Africa around mid-July developed about northeast of Cayenne, French Guiana, late on July 17. The depression moved west-northwestward and by the following day, it intensified into a Tropical Storm Anna. After passing just south of Grenada early on July 20, Anna entered the Caribbean Sea. Favorable environmental conditions allowed Anna to reach hurricane intensity late on July 20. The cyclone continued to slowly intensifying, reaching Category 2 intensity on July 22 and peaking with maximum sustained winds of . However, the storm weakened slightly before making landfall as a Category 1 hurricane in Honduras near Barra Patuca, Gracias a Dios Department, with winds of . After re-emerging into the Caribbean, Anna weakened slightly further, striking Utila around 01:00 UTC on July 24 with winds of . About nine hours later, the hurricane made landfall in Belize near Monkey River Town at the same intensity. Anna rapidly weakened over land and dissipated late on July 24.

As a developing tropical cyclone over the Windward Islands, Anna produced strong winds on Grenada, though damage was limited to some crops, trees, and telephone poles. Other islands experienced gusty winds, but no damage. Passing just north of Venezuela, the hurricane produced strong winds over the country, peaking as high as . Strong winds caused widespread damage in northern Honduras. Throughout the country, at least 36 homes were destroyed and 228 were damaged. Severe damage in the Gracias a Dios Department left hundreds of people homeless. Additionally, high winds toppled approximately 10,000 coconut trees. Overall, Anna caused one fatality and $300,000 in damage, primarily in Central America.
=== Hurricane Betsy ===

In early September, a tropical wave was noted in the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ). On September 2, the disturbance was analyzed to have attained tropical storm strength, after nearby ship reports indicated strong winds associated with anomalously low barometric pressures. Moving steadily northwestward, favorable conditions allowed Betsy to quickly intensify later that day. Shortly after, a trough situated along 50°W steered Betsy to a more northerly course. Another low-pressure area later formed in the trough, perturbing the ridge to the north of Betsy for much of its initial stages, causing the hurricane&#x27;s central pressure to rise, despite an increase in sustained winds. However, on September 5, a shortwave forced the low northeastward, allowing for Betsy to strengthen further.

Early on September 6, Betsy attained Category 4 hurricane strength, peaking with maximum sustained winds of and a central pressure of , based on reconnaissance flights into the system. However, as a result of missing the short wave itself, the hurricane later weakened and fell to Category 3 intensity while located about east-northeast of Bermuda. Betsy weakened further to Category 2 hurricane before becoming nearly stationary beginning on September 6. Moving into higher latitudes, Betsy began to weaken, degenerating back to Category 1 hurricane intensity on late on September 8. A separate, minor trough was later able to move the system northeastwards by the following day. Betsy re-intensified into a Category 2 hurricane early on September 10, but transitioned into extratropical cyclone several hours later. The extratropical remnants continued northeastward and weakened, before executing a large loop over the far north Atlantic. The remnants dissipated well north of the Azores on September 16.
=== Hurricane Carla ===

A tropical depression developed from an area of squally weather embedded within the ITCZ in the southwestern Caribbean Sea on September 3. Initially a tropical depression, it strengthened slowly while heading northwestward, and by September 4, the system was upgraded to Tropical Storm Carla. About 24 hours later, Carla was upgraded to a hurricane. Shortly thereafter, the storm curved northward while approaching the Yucatán Channel. Late on September 7, Carla entered the Gulf of Mexico while passing just northeast of the Yucatán Peninsula. The cyclone reached major hurricane intensity around 12:00 UTC on the next day. Resuming its northwestward course, Carla continued intensification and on September 11, it peaked as a Category 4 hurricane. Carla made landfall near Port O&#x27;Connor, Texas, with winds of . It weakened quickly inland and was reduced to a tropical storm on September 12. Heading generally northward, Carla transitioned into an extratropical cyclone on September 13, while centered over southern Oklahoma. However, the remnants continued generally northeastward and entered Canada on September 14, before dissipating near Cape Chidley early on September 16.

While crossing the Yucatán Channel, the outer bands of Carla brought gusty winds and severe local flooding in western Cuba and the Yucatán Peninsula. Although initially considered a significant threat to Florida, the storm brought only light winds and small amounts of precipitation, reaching no more than . In Texas, wind gusts as high as were observed in Port Lavaca. Additionally, several tornadoes spawned in the state caused notable impacts, with the most destructive tornado striking Galveston, Texas at F4 intensity, resulting in 200 buildings being severely damaged, of which 60-75 were destroyed, eight deaths and 200 injuries. Throughout the state, Carla destroyed 1,915 homes, 568 farm buildings, and 415 other buildings. Additionally, 50,723 homes, 5,620 farm buildings, and 10,487 other buildings suffered damage. There were 34 fatalities and at least $300 million in losses in Texas alone. Several tornadoes also touched down in Louisiana, causing the destruction of 140 homes and 11 farms and other buildings, and major damage to 231 additional homes and 11 farm and other buildings. Minor to moderate damage was also reported to 748 homes and 75 farm and other buildings. Six deaths and $25 million in losses in Louisiana were attributed to Carla. Heavy rainfall occurred in several other states, especially in Kansas, where flash flooding severely damaged crops and drowned five people. Overall, Carla resulted in $325.74 million in losses and 46 fatalities. In Canada, the remnants of Carla brought strong winds to Ontario and New Brunswick, though impact was primarily limited to power outages and falling trees and branches.
=== Hurricane Debbie ===
A tropical disturbance was first identified in late August over Central Africa. The wave developed into a tropical depression just offshore Senegal around 12:00 UTC on September 5. It was estimated to have intensified into Tropical Storm Debbie early the next day. Several hours later, Debbie passed through the southern Cape Verde Islands as a strong tropical storm or minimal hurricane, resulting in a plane crash and the death of 60 people. Once clear of the islands, data on the storm became sparse, and the status of Debbie was uncertain over the following several days as it tracked west-northwestward and later northward. It was not until a commercial airliner intercepted the storm on September 10 that its location was certain. The following day, Debbie intensified and reached its peak intensity as a strong Category 1 hurricane with maximum sustained winds of . The hurricane gradually slowed its forward motion and weakened. By September 13, Debbie&#x27;s motion became influenced by the westerlies, causing the system to accelerate east-northeastward. The storm transitioned into an extratropical cyclone late on September 14 about west-southwest of Horta, Azores.

The remnants of Debbie soon passed east-northeastward throughout the Azores and then curved northeastward. The system deepened slightly as it neared the British Isles, skirting the coast of Western Ireland on September 16. In Ireland, Debbie brought record winds to much of the island, with a peak gust of measured just offshore. Widespread wind damage and disruption occurred, downing tens of thousands of trees and power lines. Countless structures sustained varying degrees of damage, with many smaller buildings destroyed. Agriculture experienced extensive losses to barley, corn and wheat crops. Throughout Ireland, Debbie killed 18 people, with 12 in the Republic of Ireland and six in Northern Ireland. The storm also battered parts of Great Britain with winds in excess of .
=== Hurricane Esther ===
On September 10, Television Infrared Observation Satellite (TIROS) III observed an area of disturbed weather well southwest of the Cape Verde Islands. Later that day, a tropical depression developed about west-southwest of the southernmost Cape Verde Islands. Moving northwestward, the depression strengthened into Tropical Storm Esther on September 11, before reaching hurricane intensity on the following day. Early on September 13, Esther curved westward and deepened into a major hurricane. The storm remained a Category 3 hurricane for about four days and gradually moved in west-northwestward direction. Esther strengthened into a Category 4 hurricane on September 16 and peaked as a Category 5 hurricane on the following day with sustained winds of .

The storm curved north-northeastward on September 19, while offshore North Carolina. Esther began to weaken while approaching New England and fell to Category 2 intensity early on September 21. The storm turned eastward on the following day and gradually weakened to a tropical storm. It then executed a large cyclonic loop, until curving northward on September 25. Early on the following day, Esther made two landfalls in Massachusetts, first on Muskeget Island and then near South Yarmouth with winds of . The storm then emerged over the Gulf of Maine and made landfall in Brunswick, Maine, around 11:00 UTC on September 26 with winds of . Esther weakened to a tropical depression late on September 26 before weakening to a tropical depression and becoming extratropical over southeastern Quebec. The remnants persisted for about 12 hours, before dissipating early on September 27. Between North Carolina and New Jersey effects were primarily limited to strong winds and minor beach erosion and coastal flooding due to storm surge. In New York, strong winds led to severe crop losses and over 300,000 power outages. High tides caused coastal flooding and damaged a number of pleasure boats. Similar impact was reported in Massachusetts. Additionally, some areas observed more than of rainfall, flooding basements, low-lying roads, and underpasses. Overall, damage was minor, totaling about $6 million. There were also seven deaths reported when a United States Navy P5M aircraft crashed about north of Bermuda.
=== Tropical Storm Six ===

TIROS III imagery indicated a vortex east of the Bahamas between September 9 and September 12. A tropical depression formed at 12:00 UTC on September 12 near Great Harbour Cay in the Bahamas, after TIROS revealed a surface circulation. The depression tracked northward and intensified into a tropical storm while located offshore North Carolina. Around 12:00 UTC September 14, it made landfall in the state near Topsail Beach, North Carolina, with winds of . The storm curved accelerated northeastward and intensified despite mostly remaining over land, striking near the southern tip of the Delmarva Peninsula about nine hours later with winds of . After re-emerging into the Atlantic late on September 14, the cyclone made landfall near Islip, New York, with peak winds of around 06:00 UTC on September 15, followed by another landfall near Guilford, Connecticut, about an hour later at the same intensity. The cyclone became extratropical over southern Maine around 12:00 UTC and quickly dissipated.

Impact from the storm was generally minor. In Savannah, Georgia, the storm produced an F2 tornado that blew the roof off of a lumber company building. In North Carolina, of precipitation fell at Williamston. Strong winds lashed Rhode Island, with winds as high as in Point Judith. About 29,000 homes were left without electricity, while 1,200 lost telephone service. Hundreds of small crafts and a few ferries and barges were swamped or sank. Hurricane-force wind gusts in Massachusetts felled trees, electrical wires, and TV antennas. Some roads in the southeastern portion of the state were blocked by fallen trees. Similar impact was reported in Maine, where an F2 tornado/waterspout tracked from Beals through Roque Bluffs before dissipating in Dog Town just east of East Machias. Power lines were considerably damaged and numerous trees were knocked down, including two incidents where trees fell on and damaged homes. The tornado caused one injury when a man was hit by a flying wooden plank.
=== Hurricane Frances ===

A westward-moving tropical wave organized into Tropical Storm Frances on September 30, east of the northern Lesser Antilles. Six hours later, the depression strengthened into Tropical Storm Frances. Heading westward, it crossed through the Leeward Islands and entered the Caribbean Sea on October 1. Thereafter, the lack of divergence at high levels prevented significant strengthening for a few days. While situated south of Puerto Rico on October 2, Frances curved northwestward. The storm brought heavy rainfall to Puerto Rico, peaking at in the Indiera Baja barrio of Maricao. Considerable damage to roads and bridges occurred. However, due to swift evacuations of residents by the Civil Defense and American Red Cross, no fatalities were reported.

Tracking to the northwest, Frances made landfall near Punta Cana, Dominican Republic, early on October 3 with winds of . No impact was reported on the island. Later on October 3, Frances emerged into the Atlantic Ocean just southeast of the Turks and Caicos Islands. Thereafter, the storm accelerated somewhat and resumed intensification, reaching hurricane status on October 4. Around that time, it curved northeastward and deepened further. Early on October 7, Frances attained its peak intensity with winds of and a minimum barometric pressure of . The storm passed by Bermuda around that time, where it dropped of precipitation. Later on October 7, Frances re-curved to the north. Early on the following day, the storm became extratropical as it approached the Gulf of Maine. The remnants curved east-northeastward and struck Nova Scotia, before dissipating early on October 10.
=== Tropical Storm Gerda ===
A westward-moving tropical wave reached the central Caribbean by mid-October. The wave crossed Jamaica, causing flooding that damaged roads and forced many to evacuate their homes in western Kingston. Five fatalities were reported in Jamaica. Early on October 17, the wave developed into a tropical depression just southwest of Cape Cruz, Cuba. It continued northward and made another landfall near Santa Cruz del Sur several hours later. The depression also brought heavy rainfall to eastern Cuba, which resulted in seven deaths. After striking Cuba, the depression emerged into the Atlantic early on October 18 as it intensified into Tropical Storm Gerda.

Moving across the Bahamas later on October 18, Gerda accelerated to the north-northeast. The storm curved northeastward on October 20, while peaking with winds of . However, a Texas Tower offshore Massachusetts observed hurricane-force winds. At 00:00 UTC on October 20, Gerda transitioned into an extratropical cyclone while situated about southeast of Nantucket, Massachusetts. Damage from the storm in New England was &quot;about the same as that from a typical wintertime northeaster&quot;. The remnants of Gerda moved northeastward and then to the east, before dissipating between Newfoundland and the Azores late on October 22.
=== Hurricane Hattie ===
In late October, an area of low pressure persisted in the western Caribbean Sea for several days. Around 00:00 UTC on October 26, a tropical depression developed about northeast of Colón, Panama. Approximately 12 hours later, the depression intensified into Tropical Storm Hattie. Moving towards the north and north-northeast, the storm quickly gained hurricane status early on October 28 and reached major hurricane intensity that same day. Hattie turned towards the west to the east of Jamaica and strengthened into a Category 5 hurricane with maximum sustained winds of on October 31. The storm then weakened to a Category 4 hurricane prior to landfall south of Belize City, British Honduras, with winds of . Continuing southwest, the storm rapidly weakened over the mountainous terrain of Central America, dissipating on November 1. It was originally thought that the remnants may have contributed to the development of Tropical Storm Simone in the eastern Pacific Ocean, but a 2019 reanalysis concluded that the remnants of Hattie instead became a Central American gyre.

Hattie first affected regions in the southwestern Caribbean, producing hurricane-force winds and causing one death on San Andres Island. It was initially forecast to continue north and strike Cuba, which prompted evacuations. Little effects were reported as Hattie turned to the west, although rainfall reached on Grand Cayman. The worst damage was in the country of Belize. The former capital, Belize City, was flooded by a powerful storm surge and high waves and affected by strong winds. The territory governor estimated 70% of the buildings in the city were damaged, which left over 10,000 people homeless. The damage was severe enough that it prompted the government to relocate inland to a new city, Belmopan. In the territory, Hattie left about $60 million in damage and caused 307 deaths. The government estimated that Hattie was more damaging than a hurricane in 1931 that killed 2,000 people; the lower toll for Hattie was due to advance warning. Elsewhere in Central America, the hurricane killed 11 people in Guatemala and one in Honduras.
=== Hurricane Jenny ===

A surface trough of low pressure developed in the eastern Caribbean Sea on October 30. The trough split, with the northern portion spawning a tropical depression near Antigua at 00:00 UTC on November 2. The precursor to Jenny brought light rainfall to Puerto Rico, peaking at in Río Blanco, Naguabo. Moving northeastward ahead of an upper-level trough, the depression remained weak for over three days. On November 3, the system curved eastward, before briefly turning to the southeast on November 4. The depression tracked in a circular path during the next 24 hours, moving northeastward, north-northwestward, and then west-northward. Finally, the system strengthened into Tropical Storm Jenny early on November 5.

Jenny intensified further and reached hurricane status at 12:00 UTC on November 6. Later that day, the United States Weather Bureau began advisories and described Jenny as having &quot;characteristic of many storms in the sub-tropics late in the hurricane season.&quot; Around 18:00 UTC on November 6, Jenny attained its peak intensity with maximum sustained winds of and a minimum barometric pressure of . Thereafter, the storm briefly decelerated and weakened, falling to tropical storm intensity around midday on November 7. Jenny curved northeastward and continued to weaken, transitioning into an extratropical cyclone late on November 10 about east of Cape Race, Newfoundland. The extratropical remnants continued to move northeastward and weakened before being absorbed by a larger extratropical cyclone on the following day.
=== Tropical Storm Inga ===

Early on November 4, the &quot;SS Navigator&quot; encountered a weather system in the Gulf of Mexico that produced northwesterly winds of . Reconnaissance aircraft data indicated that Tropical Storm Inga developed at 00:00 UTC on November 4, while located about northeast of Veracruz. A strong high pressure system and a cold front entering the Gulf of Mexico from Texas caused the storm to move southward and then southeastward. Inga slowly strengthened and peaked as a tropical storm early on November 7. Thereafter, the storm became nearly stationary and began weakening. By 12:00 UTC on November 8, Inga dissipated in the Bay of Campeche, as reconnaissance aircraft found no closed circulation.
=== Tropical Storm Twelve ===

A stationary front across the central Atlantic Ocean led to the development of a low pressure area by November 16, northeast of the Lesser Antilles. A day later, it is estimated that a tropical depression developed, although due to the system&#x27;s large size, it was possible it was a subtropical cyclone. The depression moved northeastward and slowly intensified, based on observations from nearby ships. On November 19, the depression strengthened into a tropical storm. The storm strengthened to reach peak winds of on November 20. By that time, a cold front was approaching the storm, causing the storm to transition into an extratropical cyclone on November 21; later that day, the front absorbed the former tropical storm.
=== Other storms ===
In addition to the twelve systems reaching at least tropical storm status, two other cyclones formed but remained at tropical depression intensity. The first such system, also the first tropical cyclone of the season, originated from a tropical wave about east of Palm Bay, Florida, on June 10. Moving quickly northeastward, the depression may have reached tropical storm intensity on June 12 but degenerated into a trough offshore New England on the next day. On October 12, a trough developed into a tropical depression about halfway between Bermuda and North Carolina. This depression also moved quickly northeastward and merged with a frontal boundary by October 15.

A report from Mexico indicates that a tropical depression formed off the west coasts of Tabasco and Coatzacoalcos. The depression significantly impacted the northern portions of Veracruz with heavy rainfall on June 30. However, the Atlantic hurricane best track does not list this system as a tropical depression.

== Storm names ==
The following list of names was used for named storms (tropical storms and hurricanes) that formed in the North Atlantic in 1961. Storms were named &quot;Frances&quot;, &quot;Hattie&quot;, &quot;Inga&quot; and &quot;Jenny&quot; for the first time in 1961.

=== Retirement ===

The names &quot;Carla&quot; and &quot;Hattie&quot; were retired after the season due to their severity of impacts. They were replaced with &quot;Carol&quot; and &quot;Holly&quot;, respectively, for the 1965 season.

== Season effects ==
This is a table of all of the storms that formed in the 1961 Atlantic hurricane season. It includes their name, duration, peak classification and intensities, areas affected, damage, and death totals. Deaths in parentheses are additional and indirect (an example of an indirect death would be a traffic accident), but were still related to that storm. Damage and deaths include totals while the storm was extratropical, a wave, or a low, and all of the damage figures are in 1961 USD.

<doc id="760591" wikidata="Q18496" url="?curid=760591" title="Margaret (moon)">
<text>Margaret is the only known prograde irregular satellite of the moons of Uranus. It was discovered by Scott S. Sheppard, et al. in 2003 and given the provisional designation S/2003 U 3.

Confirmed as Uranus XXIII, it was named after the servant of Hero in William Shakespeare&#x27;s play &quot;Much Ado About Nothing&quot;. The name was also chosen to match the name of Sheppard&#x27;s mother.

== Orbit ==

Margaret stands out as the only prograde irregular satellite of Uranus. The diagram illustrates the orbital parameters of Margaret, unique among the irregular satellites of Uranus, with inclination on the vertical axis and the eccentricity of the orbits represented by the segments extending from the pericentre to the apocentre.

Margaret&#x27;s inclination of 57° is close to the limit of stability. The intermediate inclinations 60 &lt; i &lt; 140 are devoid of known moons due to the Kozai instability. In this instability region, solar perturbations at apoapse cause the moons in this region to acquire large eccentricities that lead to collisions or ejection over 10 million to a billion years. Margaret&#x27;s periapsis precession period (Pw) is almost 1.6 million years long. Margaret itself may be ejected from the Uranian system in the far future.

Margaret&#x27;s orbit is subject to solar and planetary perturbations; thus, its orbital elements are variable over short timescales. Over a timescale of 8,000 years, the average orbital eccentricity of Margaret is 0.68. In 2010, its eccentricity grew to 0.81, temporarily making Margaret with the most eccentric orbit of any moon in the Solar System, though Nereid&#x27;s average eccentricity of 0.75 is greater.

<doc id="760593" wikidata="Q18501" url="?curid=760593" title="Ferdinand (moon)">
<text>Ferdinand is the outermost retrograde irregular satellite of Uranus. It was first seen near Uranus by Matthew J. Holman, John J. Kavelaars, Dan Milisavljevic, and Brett J. Gladman on August 13, 2001 and reobserved on September 21, 2001. The object was then lost with no confirmation it was actually orbiting around Uranus.

On August 29 and 30, 2003 a team led by Scott S. Sheppard surveyed the sky around Uranus with the Subaru Telescope and detected two unknown objects near Uranus. These two new objects were reobserved by Sheppard et al. with the Gemini telescope on September 20, 2003 and reported to the Minor Planet Center as possible new moons of Uranus. On September 24, 2003, Brian G. Marsden, at the Minor Planet Center, linked one of the unknown objects reported by Sheppard et al. to the lost object observed by Holman et al. in 2001. Holman was then able to confirm the linkage between the 2001 and 2003 objects on September 30, 2003 by observing its location with the Magellan-Baade telescope. The linked 2001 and 2003 object was then given the provisional designation S/2001 U 2 on October 1, 2003, officially identifying it as a new moon of Uranus. Now designated Uranus XXIV, Ferdinand is named after the son of the King of Naples in William Shakespeare&#x27;s play &quot;The Tempest&quot;.

The second new object observed by Sheppard et al. in 2003 was also a new moon of Uranus, now named Margaret.

== Orbit ==

Ferdinand is the most distant known satellite of Uranus. It follows a retrograde, modestly inclined but highly eccentric orbit.
The diagram illustrates the orbital parameters of the retrograde irregular satellites of Uranus (in polar co-ordinates) with the eccentricity of the orbits represented by the segments extending from the pericentre to the apocentre.

<text>Antonio Vagnozzi (born 1950) is an amateur Italian astronomer and a discoverer of asteroids.

== Astronomical career ==
Vagnozzi is credited by the Minor Planet Center (MPC) with the discovery of 46 minor planets during 1993–1999. In 1993, he was Italy&#x27;s first amateur astronomer (and the second discoverer worldwide) to discover a minor planet using a CCD camera. (The first numbered CCD-based discovery was 4255 Spacewatch, which was discovered by the Spacewatch project in 1986).

He also searches for supernovae and is a co-discoverer of SN 1996ae.

== Awards and honors ==

The main-belt asteroid 7529 Vagnozzi was named in his honor. The official naming citation was published by the MPC on 11 April 1998 ().

<doc id="760599" wikidata="Q552905" url="?curid=760599" title="Howard Wilkinson">
<text>Howard Wilkinson (born 13 November 1943) is an English former footballer and manager. Despite having a low-profile playing career, Wilkinson embarked on a successful managerial career. He won the First Division championship in 1992 with Leeds United, the final season before the creation of the Premier League. As FA Technical Director he was instrumental in the planning and development of English football&#x27;s first National Football Centre. To date, he remains the last English manager to win the top-flight league in England. He later had spells as caretaker manager of the England senior and U21 teams.

Wilkinson is currently the chairman of the League Managers Association.

==Playing career==

Born in the Netherthorpe district of Sheffield, Yorkshire, Wilkinson began his playing career with local team Sheffield United, before joining cross-city rivals Sheffield Wednesday, signing for them on 25 June 1962.

After making just 22 league appearances, he joined Brighton &amp; Hove Albion on 9 July 1966 where he played over a hundred league matches as a winger. He left the club in 1971.

His final club was Boston United. Whilst there, he won several Northern Premier League titles. It was at the Pilgrims where he began his managerial career, being appointed player manager in 1975. He won two more Northern Premier League titles as manager. In December 1976 he was enticed away from Boston to join Mossley as Player-Manager and guided them up the table to finish 9th, being unbeaten in 19 successive games. He played 30 matches for the club, scoring one goal.

He has a degree in education from what is now Sheffield Hallam University, where he graduated from in 1975.

==Managerial career==

===Notts County===
Wilkinson began his full-time coaching career in December 1979 at Notts County when he was appointed a coach. He was taken on and tutored by County&#x27;s manager Jimmy Sirrel. After Sirrell became the club&#x27;s general manager in August 1982, Wilkinson became team manager for the 1982–83 season and County managed a reasonable return of 52 points, achieving a finish of 15th in the First Division.

===Sheffield Wednesday===
In June 1983, Wilkinson dropped down a division to become manager of Sheffield Wednesday, where he established his reputation as a manager despite never having been a big-name player. Wednesday won promotion from the Second Division in his first season and Wilkinson maintained their place in England&#x27;s top flight for the next four years – with a highest finish of fifth in the 1985–86 season.

===Leeds United===
Wilkinson&#x27;s greatest success as a manager came after moving to Wednesday&#x27;s Yorkshire rivals Leeds United in October 1988. He soon drilled discipline into a lacklustre squad and earned the affectionate nickname &quot;Sergeant Wilko&quot;, a play on the old TV character &quot;Sergeant Bilko&quot;. The team won the Second Division in 1989–90 after the signings of Gordon Strachan who became captain, hardman Vinnie Jones (who Wilkinson guided to a whole season with only three yellow cards), Mel Sterland, Chris Fairclough and Lee Chapman. Following the promotion, Wilkinson immediately offloaded Jones and brought in Gary McAllister from Leicester City and John Lukic was brought back from Arsenal. He also helped players who had come up through the youth team, Gary Speed and David Batty, to mature to the new level of football.

In Leeds&#x27; first season in the First Division they performed very well for a newly promoted team and ended the season fourth in the league. Wilkinson felt further improvement was required on the squad and brought in Rod Wallace, Tony Dorigo and Steve Hodge finalising his best squad with Eric Cantona in February 1992. Leeds won the last championship of the old style Football League First Division in 1992. As of 2024, Wilkinson is the last English manager to have coached a team to the English league championship title.

However, his subsequent time at Leeds was less successful. Leeds finished 17th in the 1992–93 season, which is among the worst performances by a team who were reigning English champions. Leeds improved with consecutive fifth-place finishes in 1993–94 and 1994–95, the latter earning the club a UEFA Cup spot. Leeds also reached the final of the League Cup in 1996, which they lost 3–0 to Aston Villa. Following a poor start to the 1996–97 season, including a 4–0 home defeat to bitter rivals Manchester United, on 9 September 1996, Wilkinson was sacked.

Howard Wilkinson made the decision to sell Cantona to Alex Ferguson&#x27;s Manchester United on 27 November 1992 for £1.2m. The Frenchman went on to become a linchpin in the side that won four Premier League titles in five seasons.

Wilkinson was instrumental in the opening of Leeds&#x27; first modern academy and training facility at Thorp Arch in 1994 known as The Grange, named after Barcelona&#x27;s La Masia, translated in English as The Farmhouse. Intended as a base to nurture a nucleus of players to challenge for domestic and European honours by the mid-2000s. Wilkinson&#x27;s plans for Leeds were never fully realised however he later applied this blueprint to the national game when implementing the Academy System as FA technical director.

In December 1999, Wilkinson revealed that Arsenal had made an approach for him during the summer of 1995, when they were searching for a successor to George Graham, who had been sacked for accepting an illegal payment three years earlier. However, the Leeds board rejected Arsenal&#x27;s approach for him and Bruce Rioch was appointed instead.

Shortly after his exit from Elland Road, Manchester City chairman Francis Lee expressed interest in appointing Wilkinson as manager of the Maine Road club a few months after their relegation from the Premier League. However, when Wilkinson turned down the approach, Lee then turned to Frank Clark, who had resigned as Nottingham Forest manager.

===The Football Association===
Four months after leaving Leeds, in January 1997, Wilkinson was hired by the sport&#x27;s governing body in England, the Football Association, to act as its Technical Director, overseeing coaching and other training programmes at all levels of the game. Whilst at Leeds, Wilkinson had developed a ten-year plan to create an &quot;English La Masia&quot; at Thorp Arch. In his role with the FA, Wilkinson applied this blueprint on a larger scale to the national game, developing the academy system and persuading the FA to begin the National Football Centre project. Wilkinson based the plans for the National Football Centre on the French system at Clairefontaine which nurtured the 1998 World Cup and 2000 European Championship winners. In 1997 Wilkinson published the Charter for Quality which was the basis for which all English academies were to train future stars.

In his position as Technical Director of the FA, he managed the England team on a caretaker basis in 1999 for a friendly against France following the sacking of Glenn Hoddle. Following this he acted for a time as the permanent coach of the England under-21 team, controversially selecting himself to replace Hoddle&#x27;s choice of manager, Peter Taylor. Wilkinson was unsuccessful in this role; despite inheriting a team who were unbeaten and yet to concede a goal, he lost three of his six matches in charge. Wilkinson resigned from the post in June 2001, to be replaced by David Platt (Taylor would end up back in charge three years later). He returned to the role of caretaker of the senior team in October 2000 following the resignation of Hoddle&#x27;s permanent successor Kevin Keegan, overseeing a 0–0 draw in a World Cup qualifying match against Finland.

===Sunderland===
In October 2002, he left his role as FA Technical Director in order to return to club management at relegation threatened Premier League side Sunderland, with Steve Cotterill as his assistant. However, his time there was a disappointment, being unable to improve the form of a struggling side, and he departed on 10 March 2003. Sunderland eventually ended the season at the bottom of the Premier League with a then league-history-worst total of 19 points. He won two league games out of a possible twenty with his worst moment being a 3–1 home defeat to Charlton Athletic on 1 February 2003 during which Sunderland scored three own goals within seven minutes.

At one point during his tenure, he was once asked some very pointed questions by a BBC Radio 5 Live reporter about a far from perfect performance. Wilkinson is said to have snapped and asked him what qualified him, as a mere reporter, to question professionals in this way. &quot;Forty-three England caps, fifteen as captain&quot; came the reply. The reporter concerned was Jimmy Armfield.

===Later career===
Wilkinson briefly returned to management in March 2004, taking charge of Chinese club Shanghai Shenhua on a short-term contract, but left two months later for personal reasons. In October 2004, he was temporarily appointed as first team coach of Leicester City, following the departures of manager Micky Adams and coach Alan Cork. Wilkinson returned to Notts County in December 2004 where he became a non-executive director. He held a coaching role as technical director from June 2006 until September 2007 when he left the club altogether.

On 9 January 2009, Wilkinson was confirmed as the new Technical Adviser of Sheffield Wednesday Upon the resignation of Lee Strafford on 17 May 2010, Wilkinson became the interim chairman of the club. He confronted fans after they protested against the club following a 1–0 defeat to Southampton. Notably, Wilkinson&#x27;s primary function in his role was to negotiate the essential investment that Wednesday required to avoid the threat of administration, when a winding up petition was to be presented by HMRC on 17 November 2010. This was achieved when Milan Mandarić was revealed as the new owner of the club. Mandarić, then the owner of Leicester City, sold the club to Vichai and Aiyawatt Srivaddhanaprabha, as Football League rules prevented him from being the chairman of two different clubs. Wilkinson stayed on at Wednesday in a non-executive directorial role, until he resigned in early 2011.

Wilkinson was appointed Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in the 2024 New Year Honours for services to association football and charity.

==Personal life==
His son Ben was also a professional footballer, and is currently the assistant manager of the Manchester City EDS squad.

Wilkinson was also a PE teacher at Abbeydale Grange school, Sheffield, whilst playing semi-professional football for Boston United.

<text>Halimede , or Neptune IX, is a retrograde irregular satellite of Neptune. It was discovered by Matthew J. Holman, John J. Kavelaars, Tommy Grav, Wesley C. Fraser and Dan Milisavljevic on August 14, 2002.

==Name==

Halimede, like many of the outer satellites of Neptune, is named after one of the Nereids, the fifty daughters of Nereus and Doris. Before the announcement of its name on February 3, 2007 (IAUC 8802), Halimede was known by the provisional designation S/2002 N 1.

==Orbit==

Halimede has the second most eccentric and third most inclined orbit around Neptune. This is illustrated on the diagram in relation to other irregular satellites of Neptune. The satellites above the horizontal axis are prograde, the satellites beneath it are retrograde. The yellow segments extend from the pericentre to the apocentre, showing the eccentricity. It is also worth mentioning that Sao and Laomedeia are similar to Halimede but they both have prograde orbits unlike Halimede which has a retrograde orbit.

==Physical characteristics==
Halimede is about 62 kilometers in diameter (assuming an albedo of 0.04) and appears neutral (grey) in the visible light. Given the very similar colour of the satellite to that of Nereid together with the high probability (41%) of collision in the past lifespan of the Solar System, it has been suggested that the satellite could be a fragment of Nereid.

<text>Phenomenon is a 1996 American romantic fantasy drama film directed by Jon Turteltaub, written by Gerald Di Pego, in which an amiable, small-town everyman is inexplicably transformed into a genius with telekinetic powers. It stars John Travolta, Kyra Sedgwick, Forest Whitaker, Robert Duvall, and Jeffrey DeMunn. The original music score was composed by Thomas Newman.

==Plot==
George Malley is an auto mechanic in a small town in Northern California. He has a crush on single mother Lace. He lets her sell her handmade chairs at his shop, but secretly buys them himself. She is very closed off and rebuffs George&#x27;s advances. After celebrating his 37th birthday at a bar with his best friend, Nate, and father figure, Doc Brunder, he sees a ball of shining bright white lights in the sky, which grows closer until it hits him with a loud bang, knocking him down. Nobody else sees the lights or hears the sound.

George begins to exhibit remarkable levels of intelligence. He easily absorbs vast amounts of information, formulates new, revolutionary ideas, and develops telekinesis. Not needing sleep, he spends each night reading multiple books.

George tries to use his new intelligence for the good of his community. He develops a powerful fertilizer, improves solar panel designs, and predicts an earthquake without any equipment. When Doc is called to aid a sick Portuguese man, George learns the language in minutes and helps translate. He then uses his telekinesis to rescue the man&#x27;s young relative. George also formulates a plan to help Nate get together with Ella, the mother of the Portuguese boy he rescued. Nate has a shortwave radio hobby. While visiting him, George decodes and responds to a signal, though Nate asks him to forget about it, fearful they might be picking up information from a nearby air force base.

The townsfolk become wary, but George finds support from Doc, Nate and from a growing relationship with Lace, and her children, Al and Glory. George invites Lace to join him on a trip to U.C. Berkeley to meet with seismologist Professor Ringold about George&#x27;s earthquake prediction. Before he can go, the FBI takes George and Nate into custody over his code-breaking. He breaks more codes, then astounds Dr. Nierdof by answering a series of difficult quizzes and exams, and shows him his telekinesis. When George threatens to talk to the press, he is finally released. The FBI instructs Dr. Ringold not to let George meet with anyone at Berkeley.

Returning to the local bar, George becomes frustrated with friends&#x27; questions about his abilities, and he causes a large mirror to break via telekinesis.

Lace visits him to provide a shave and a haircut. Their innocent intimacy scares her, since she has tried so hard to not like him, but it encourages him to stop avoiding the townsfolk. He goes to the county fair to ease fear with a demonstration of his powers, but the crowd goes into a frenzy, demanding his attention and his perceived healing powers. George is knocked to the ground, where he again sees the flashing balls of light before losing consciousness.

George awakens in a hospital. They have called Dr. Wellin, a leading brain surgeon, to see if an operation can remove George&#x27;s tumor. Dr. Wellin determines there is only a 1-in-500 chance of survival, but wants to proceed with an invasive operation solely to do research on George&#x27;s living brain. When George refuses, saying he still has work to do, the doctor has him declared mentally unfit and held against his will.

George escapes from the hospital and returns home. He spends time with Nate, then goes to Lace&#x27;s to spend time with her and her children. The FBI agent shows up, but Lace persuades him to let George die in peace.

Professor Ringold arrives at Lace&#x27;s house, only to learn that he is too late. Lace gives him George&#x27;s research materials, so he can finish George&#x27;s breakthrough work.

A year later, George&#x27;s friends are gathered for what would have been his 38th birthday. Nate, now fluent in Portuguese, is married to a pregnant Ella. Other signs of George&#x27;s phenomenal impact on the town and its people are seen all around.

On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 49% based on reviews from 37 critics, with an average rating of 5.9/10. On Metacritic, it has a score of 41% based on reviews from 17 critics, indicating &quot;mixed or average reviews&quot;. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of &quot;A-&quot; on an A+ to F scale.

Roger Ebert of &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; gave the film three out of four stars, questioning if it could have been more challenging but remarking, &quot;But that&#x27;s not what it&#x27;s about. It&#x27;s about change, acceptance and love, and it rounds those three bases very nicely, even if it never quite gets to home.&quot;

Janet Maslin of &quot;The New York Times&quot;, complimented the concept but said &quot;during the grimness of the film&#x27;s final half hour, jaws may drop. A whopping wrong turn throws this lightweight, benign-looking movie terminally off course.&quot; &quot;Empire&quot; magazine&#x27;s Angie Errigo rated the film three out of five stars. She complained about the film&#x27;s tendency to overexplain itself, but complimented Travolta&#x27;s performance.

<text>In carbohydrate chemistry, a pair of anomers () is a pair of near-identical stereoisomers or diastereomers that differ at only the anomeric carbon, the carbon atom that bears the aldehyde or ketone functional group in the sugar&#x27;s open-chain form. However, in order for anomers to exist, the sugar must be in its cyclic form, since in open-chain form, the anomeric carbon atom is planar and thus achiral. More formally stated, then, an anomer is an epimer at the hemiacetal/hemiketal carbon atom in a cyclic saccharide. Anomerization is the process of conversion of one anomer to the other. As is typical for stereoisomeric compounds, different anomers have different physical properties, melting points and specific rotations.

==Nomenclature==
Every two anomers are designated alpha (α) or beta (β), according to the configurational relationship between the &quot;anomeric centre&quot; and the &quot;anomeric reference atom&quot;, hence they are relative stereodescriptors. The anomeric centre in hemiacetals is the anomeric carbon C-1; in hemiketals, it is the carbon derived from the carbonyl of the ketone (e.g. C-2 in -fructose). In aldohexoses the anomeric reference atom is the stereocenter that is farthest from the anomeric carbon in the ring (the configurational atom, defining the sugar as or ). For example, in α--glucopyranose the reference atom is C-5.

If in the cyclic Fischer projection the exocyclic oxygen atom at the anomeric centre is cis (on the same side) to the exocyclic oxygen attached to the anomeric reference atom (in the OH group) the anomer is α. If the two oxygens are trans (on different sides) the anomer is β.

==Anomerization==
Anomerization is the process of conversion of one anomer to the other. For reducing sugars, anomerization is referred to as &quot;mutarotation&quot; and occurs readily in solution and is catalyzed by acid and base. This reversible process typically leads to an anomeric mixture in which eventually an equilibrium is reached between the two single anomers.

The ratio of the two anomers is specific for the regarding sugar. For example, regardless of the configuration of the starting -glucose, a solution will gradually move towards being a mixture of approximately 64% β--glucopyranoside and 36% of α--glucopyranose. As the ratio changes, the optical rotation of the mixture changes; this phenomenon is called mutarotation.

=== Mechanism of anomerization ===

Though the cyclic forms of sugars are usually heavily favoured, hemiacetals in aqueous solution are in equilibrium with their open-chain forms. In aldohexoses this equilibrium is established as the hemiacetal bond between C-1 (the carbon bound to two oxygens) and the C-5 oxygen. It is cleaved (forming the open-chain compound) and reformed (forming the cyclic compound). When the hemiacetal group is reformed, the OH group on C-5 may attack either of the two stereochemically distinct sides of the aldehyde group on C-1. Which side it attacks on determines whether the α- or β-anomer is formed.

Anomerization of glycosides typically occurs under acidic conditions. Typically, anomerization occurs through protonation of the exocyclic acetal oxygen, ionization to form an oxocarbenium ion with release of an alcohol, and nucleophilic attack by an alcohol on the reverse face of the oxocarbenium ion, followed by deprotonation.

==Physical properties and stability==
Anomers are different in structure, and thus have different stabilizing and destabilizing effects from each other. The major contributors to the stability of a certain anomer are:
*The anomeric effect, which stabilizes the anomer that has an electron withdrawing group (typically an oxygen or nitrogen atom) in axial orientation on the ring. This effect is abolished in polar solvents such as water.
*1,3-diaxial interactions, which usually destabilize the anomer that has the anomeric group in an axial orientation on the ring. This effect is especially noticeable in pyranoses and other six-membered ring compounds. This is a major factor in water.
*Hydrogen bonds between the anomeric group and other groups on the ring, leading to stabilization of the anomer.
*Dipolar repulsion between the anomeric group and other groups on the ring, leading to destabilization of the anomer.

For -glucopyranoside, the β-anomer is the more stable anomer in water. For -mannopyranose, the α-anomer is the more stable anomer.

Because anomers are diastereomers of each other, they often differ in physical and chemical properties. One of the most important physical properties that is used to study anomers is the specific rotation, which can be monitored by polarimetry.

<doc id="760608" wikidata="Q403151" url="?curid=760608" title="Peter Taylor (footballer, born 1953)">
<text>Peter John Taylor (born 3 January 1953) is an English former footballer who was most recently manager of Maldon &amp; Tiptree. He was previously manager at Dartford, Enfield, Southend United, Dover Athletic, Leicester City, Brighton and Hove Albion, Hull City, Crystal Palace, Kerala Blasters, Stevenage Borough, Wycombe Wanderers, Bradford City and (twice) Gillingham, leaving the last role at the end of 2014. He also had two spells as head coach of the England under-21 team and took charge of the England national team as caretaker manager for one game against Italy, for which he made David Beckham captain of England for the first time. He managed the England under-20 team in 2013. Outside England, Taylor was the head coach of the Bahrain national football team.

During his time as a player with Crystal Palace during the 1970s, Taylor became one of the few players to have been selected for the senior England team when not playing in the top two flights of a domestic league.

==Playing career==
Taylor enjoyed a successful playing career as a winger. He began his youth career with Canvey Island, and had trials at Tottenham Hotspur and Crystal Palace before signing as a junior with Southend United in 1971. Southend gained promotion to the Third Division in 1972 and Taylor&#x27;s part in their success brought him to the attention of Crystal Palace manager, Malcolm Allison, who signed him on 11 October 1973 for £110,000. Palace were relegated to the third tier at the end of that season, but Taylor was named Player of the Year and remained at the club for two further seasons, becoming player of the year again in 1976. The 1975–76 season was a high point in Taylor&#x27;s career as Palace reached the FA Cup semi-final, Taylor scoring two goals in the quarter-final in a 3–2 away win at Chelsea and he also made four appearances for the full England team, scoring twice. However, Palace&#x27;s season tailed off after the semi-final and they did not achieve promotion to the second tier. At the end of the season Allison resigned and was replaced by Terry Venables, and on 30 September 1976 Taylor was allowed to depart for top-flight Tottenham Hotspur for a fee of £400,000.

Taylor scored on his debut in a 4–2 defeat at The Hawthorns to West Bromwich Albion. He had a mixed career at Spurs; the club suffered relegation in 1977 but was promoted in 1978. Taylor did not make another England appearance and in 1980 moved on to Leyton Orient, having made 123 appearances for Tottenham during which he scored 31 times. He played 56 times for Orient, scoring eleven times in three seasons, and had a brief loan spell at Oldham Athletic. In 1983–84 Taylor made eight appearances for Exeter City before moving into non-league football with firstly Maidstone United, and then Chelmsford City, Dartford and Enfield.

Taylor made his England debut as a substitute versus Wales and scored the winning goal in the 80th minute of that game. He scored his second international goal against the same opponents in the next match that he played. Taylor was the last English footballer to score two goals in his first two international games before Rickie Lambert repeated the feat in 2013.

After his playing career ended, Taylor embarked on a career as a coach and manager.

==Management career==

===Early management===
Taylor became player manager at non-league club Dartford. In his four seasons there, club attendances rose from 400 to around 1,000, he won the Southern Cup twice and each season he was there Dartford scored more than 100 goals. Taylor&#x27;s first managerial role in the Football League was at Southend United. He spent two years between 1993 and 1995 as manager but quit at the end of the 1994–95 season after failing to get them beyond the middle of the Division One table. Taylor took on the job as manager of Conference club Dover Athletic in 1995–96 season and guided the club to 20th, enough to stave off the threat of relegation as only two clubs were relegated that season.

===England U-21===
He agreed and signed a two-year contract at Dover in May 1996 but was to leave the club only two months later after being asked by then England boss Glenn Hoddle to manage the England under-21 side. His record (for competitive matches) was eleven wins, three draws and one defeat from fifteen games. In this time, England finished ninth in 1998 European Championship and qualified for the 2000 finals comfortably, winning every match without conceding a goal. But with three matches to play, Taylor was replaced in a controversial manner by Howard Wilkinson, who won the next two matches. The three goals conceded in the 3–1 defeat to group runners-up Poland were the only blemish on the team&#x27;s qualifying record. England under Wilkinson later got knocked out in the group stage of the finals, winning against Turkey but losing to Slovakia and champions Italy.

===Gillingham===
Taylor returned to club management at the beginning of the 1999–2000 season with Gillingham, and at the end of the season guided them to victory over Wigan Athletic in the Division Two play-off final which marked the Kent club&#x27;s promotion to the upper half of the English league for the first time in their history. During this season he also guided the Gills to the quarterfinals of the FA Cup after impressive wins over Premiership opposition in Bradford City and Sheffield Wednesday (a brace of 3–1 home wins), before losing 5–0 away to Chelsea in the last eight.

===Leicester City===
A few weeks later he left the club to take charge at Leicester City in the Premier League. He had an excellent start at the East Midlands club and they went top of the league on 1 October 2000. They stayed at the top of the league for two weeks (Taylor having been voted Premier League Manager of the Month for September 2000) and were in contention for a UEFA Cup place for well over half a season, but nine defeats from their final ten games sucked them down to 13th place in the wake of a shock defeat by Wycombe Wanderers in the FA Cup quarter-final.

After a terrible start to the 2001–02 season, Taylor was sacked on 30 September 2001.

====England====
In November 2000, whilst managing Leicester, Taylor was appointed caretaker manager of England for one match. For that game, a 1–0 defeat by Italy in the Stadio Delle Alpi in Turin on 15 November 2000, Taylor looked to youth. He handed David Beckham the captain&#x27;s armband for the first time and used six players then still eligible for the Under-21s; Gareth Barry, Jamie Carragher, Kieron Dyer, Rio Ferdinand, Emile Heskey and Seth Johnson.

===Brighton and Hove Albion===
After being sacked by Leicester, he returned to management within two weeks to take charge at Brighton &amp; Hove Albion whose previous manager Micky Adams had become the new assistant manager of Leicester City. Taylor guided Brighton to the Division Two championship (marking their return to the upper half of the English league after eleven years) but resigned from his job at the end of the season, citing a low budget and the delay to the new stadium.

===Hull City===
In November 2002 Taylor was appointed manager of Hull City who were weeks away from their move to the 25,404-seat KC Stadium. A mid-table finish was followed in 2003–04 by promotion as Division Three runners-up. They finished League One runners-up the following season, 2004–05, and thus reached the Football League Championship in the 2005–06 season – their first appearance at that level since 1990–91, and they finished 18th in the league.

===England U-21 (second spell)===
Taylor had returned to manage England&#x27;s U-21 team for a second spell in 2004, combining the role with his job at Hull.
England comfortably progressed from their qualification group for the 2006 finals but lost to eventual semi-finalists France in a play-off over two legs. He initially retained his position after joining Crystal Palace, and the team qualified for the 2007 finals. However, he left in January 2007 as the new senior manager, Steve McClaren, wanted the England U-21 manager&#x27;s role to be a full-time position. Taylor&#x27;s record in competitive fixtures in his second spell with the U21s was nine wins, five draws and two defeats from sixteen games.

===Crystal Palace===

Success at Hull drew attention from other clubs, and Taylor returned to former club Crystal Palace in June 2006 after Palace agreed a £300,000 compensation package with Hull. He only lasted sixteen months at Selhurst Park as he was sacked in October 2007 after a run of poor form left the Eagles hovering dangerously above the bottom three.

===Stevenage Borough===
A few weeks after his departure from Palace, Taylor was appointed manager of Conference team Stevenage Borough in November 2007. His first purchase in this role was Junior Lewis, a player he had previously brought into five other clubs (Dover, Gillingham, Leicester, Brighton and Hull).

On 28 April 2008, Taylor left Stevenage Borough after six months in charge when his short-term contract expired and he had failed to get them into the end of season play-offs. They finished the season in sixth place, 22 points behind the champions, having been in third place and just four points off top spot when he took charge.

===Wycombe Wanderers===
On 29 May 2008, he became Wycombe Wanderers manager, following the resignation of Paul Lambert after their failure to reach the League Two play-off final. He signed Junior Lewis, this time as first team coach. Taylor had a successful start to the 2008–09 season as Wycombe went on an 18-game unbeaten run in the league with promotion to League One being secured on the final day of the season. However, he was dismissed on 9 October 2009 after Wycombe&#x27;s slow start to the League One season.

===Bradford City===
On 16 February 2010, Taylor replaced Stuart McCall to become manager of League Two side Bradford City, initially on a three-month contract until the end of the 2009–10 season. Junior Lewis was employed as first team coach, working with assistant manager Wayne Jacobs and youth team coach David Wetherall. Taylor signed a one-year contract at Bradford the day before Bradford played Northampton. In January 2011, Taylor turned down an offer from Premier League Newcastle United to be assistant to their new manager Alan Pardew. After three successive defeats later in the month, Taylor came under pressure but vowed to carry on, saying: &quot;I&#x27;m not a fool, I can tell that I&#x27;m probably not the most popular manager Bradford City&#x27;s ever had. I&#x27;m not prepared to walk away, I&#x27;m prepared to take this difficult job head on.&quot; City&#x27;s run of poor form continued and the following month, Taylor and City parted company by mutual consent; although the announcement came before City&#x27;s game with Stockport County, Taylor remained in charge for one final time.

===Bahrain===
On 11 July 2011, the Bahrain Football Association signed Taylor to train the national football team. Just a few months later he led Bahrain to winning the football tournament at the 1st GCC Games in Manama, the first time Bahrain&#x27;s national team had won a regional competition in their history. Bahrain beat arch rivals Saudi Arabia 3–1 in a one-sided final. Taylor received a lot of praise from the players, fans and officials for his achievement.

Two months later, Taylor successfully led the Bahrainian team to clinch football gold in the 2011 Arab Games in Doha, beating Jordan 1–0 in the final with a last-gasp goal by striker Ismail Abdullatif.

Asked in April 2012 about the arrest and torture of up to 150 pro-democracy athletes, including three of his own players, Taylor told reporters: &quot;Don&#x27;t go there. You&#x27;re getting boring.&quot;

FIFA had to investigate a match after Bahrain defeated Indonesia 10–0, in a World Cup qualifier. Bahrain needed to overcome a 9–0 deficit to have a chance of qualifying for the next stage.

He was sacked on 17 October 2012 after a 2–6 loss to United Arab Emirates in a friendly match.

===England U-20===
In March 2013, Taylor was appointed as the England national under-20 football team manager on a two-month contract, to lead the team who had qualified for the 2013 FIFA U-20 World Cup in Turkey. In the finals, England under Taylor were knocked out in the group stages, drawing with Iraq and Chile, and losing to Egypt; England finished bottom of their group.

===Return to Gillingham===
In October 2013, Taylor was appointed Gillingham manager for the second time, on an interim basis, following the club&#x27;s sacking of Martin Allen. On 11 November he was appointed full-time manager, with a contract lasting until the end of the season. He was relieved of his duties on 31 December 2014.

===Kerala Blasters===
On 8 May 2015, Indian Super League club Kerala Blasters appointed Taylor as the head coach for the season ahead.
However, after four defeats in a row in a then 14 game season put the club in serious cross roads meaning Taylor was manager to sacked in club&#x27;s history. On 28 October 2015 Taylor departed as Kerala Blasters gaffer.

===New Zealand (assistant) and third Gillingham spell===

In September 2016, Taylor accepted the offer to become assistant to Anthony Hudson with the New Zealand men&#x27;s national football team. Taylor was to be based in England and mainly to work with the New Zealand players based there.

In May 2017 he was appointed as director of football at Gillingham, alongside his New Zealand duties. He was appointed Gillingham&#x27;s interim manager following the departure of head coach Adrian Pennock on 25 September 2017. He left both roles at Gillingham on 12 October 2017.

===Dagenham &amp; Redbridge===
Taylor was appointed manager of National League club Dagenham &amp; Redbridge on 5 June 2018, with Terry Harris as his assistant. Taylor left Dagenham &amp; Redbridge in December 2019; the club stated that a change was required due to recent results.

===Welling United===
On 28 September 2021, Taylor was appointed manager of National League South club Welling United. On 13 March 2022, after 166 days in charge, Taylor departed Welling after a 1–1 draw against Bath City four points above the relegation zone, with bottom club Billericay Town having a game in hand over Welling.

===Maldon &amp; Tiptree===
On 13 December 2022, Taylor was appointed manager of Isthmian League North Division club Maldon &amp; Tiptree. On 20 August 2023, Taylor left Maldon &amp; Tiptree.

<text>Sao is a prograde irregular satellite of Neptune. It was discovered by Matthew J. Holman &quot;et al.&quot; on August 14, 2002.

Sao orbits Neptune at a distance of about 22.4 million km and is about 44 kilometers in diameter (assuming an albedo of 0.04).

Sao follows an exceptionally inclined and moderately eccentric orbit illustrated on the diagram in relation to other irregular satellites of Neptune. The satellites above the horizontal axis are prograde, the satellites beneath it are retrograde. The yellow segments extend from the pericentre to the apocentre, showing the eccentricity.

The satellite is in Kozai resonance, i.e. its inclination and eccentricity are coupled (the inclination of the orbit decreases while eccentricity increases and &quot;vice versa&quot;).

Sao, or Neptune XI, like many of the outer satellites of Neptune, is named after one of the Nereids; Sao was associated with sailing and is referred to as &quot;The rescuer&quot; or &quot;Safety&quot;. Before the announcement of its name on February 3, 2007 (IAUC 8802), Sao was known provisionally as S/2002 N 2.

<text>LIN Media was an American holding company founded in 1994 that operated 43 television stations. All except one were affiliates of the six major U.S. television networks. One of the remaining stations was a low-powered weather station in Indiana.

LIN Media&#x27;s chief executive officer was Vincent L. Sadusky. Sadusky had been LIN&#x27;s chief financial officer, Vice President and treasurer since 2004, and had been CFO for Telemundo, working closely on its sale to GE/NBC. Sadusky had been interim CEO since former chairman Gary R. Chapman announced his impending retirement in June 2006, and through the company&#x27;s search for a permanent replacement. He was installed as CEO upon Chapman&#x27;s retirement on July 10, 2006.

== History ==

LIN TV&#x27;s roots trace back to the founding of its former parent, LIN Broadcasting Corporation, in 1961. LIN Broadcasting was engaged in radio, television, direct marketing, information and learning, music publishing, and record labels. LIN takes its initials from three major cities: Louisville, Indianapolis and Nashville. The company was based in Nashville, where it owned WMAK. It purchased WAKY in Louisville and attempted to purchase a station in Indianapolis but failed to do so. The company purchased its first television station, WTVP (now WAND) in Decatur, Illinois, at the end of 1965. It also briefly owned the catalogues of King Records and Starday Records in the early 1970s.

LIN Broadcasting made acquisitions in broadcasting, expanded into paging, and in the early 1980s the company entered the fledgling cellular telephone business. By 1983 the company owned seven television stations and by 1985 it owned and managed cellular telephone licenses serving Dallas, Houston, Los Angeles, New York City, and Philadelphia. LIN Broadcasting sold its paging operations and six of its radio stations in 1986 to help finance the development of its cellular business.

In March 1990, McCaw Cellular Communications purchased a 52% interest in LIN Broadcasting. McCaw was acquired by AT&amp;T in 1994, after which LIN Broadcasting&#x27;s television operations were spun off as a public company traded on the NASDAQ stock market and 45%-owned by AT&amp;T. The new company, LIN Television Corporation, owned and/or operated 12 stations and its stock price increased at a compounded annual growth rate of 31% between 1994 and 1998. During this period LIN acquired WIVB-TV in Buffalo, New York, and WTNH in New Haven, Connecticut.

In March 1998, LIN TV was acquired by Hicks, Muse, Tate &amp; Furst, a leading private investment firm based in Dallas, Texas. At the time of the HMTF acquisition, LIN contributed its Dallas NBC affiliate, KXAS-TV, to a joint venture with the network that also held the San Diego affiliate (KNSD). Under HMTFs ownership, LIN Television has grown considerably through a wide range of transactions:

In June 1999, LIN TV acquired WOOD-TV in Grand Rapids, Michigan. Former parent LIN Broadcasting had owned the station from 1983 to 1994, when it merged with AT&amp;T. However, LIN TV had continued to operate it.

In August 1999, LIN TV helped finance the establishment of the now-defunct Banks Broadcasting, a minority-owned television broadcast company in which it held a 50% interest. Banks owned two stations: KWCV (now KSCW-DT) in Wichita, Kansas, and KNIN-TV in Boise, Idaho.

LIN TV purchased WAPA-TV in San Juan, Puerto Rico, in October. In April 2000, LIN TV acquired WLFI-TV in Lafayette, Indiana, in exchange for 66% of WAND. LIN continued to provide management oversight for WAND.

LIN TV purchased WWLP in Springfield, Massachusetts, in 2000. In 2001, LIN TV acquired WJPX and two satellite facilities in Puerto Rico, and the secondary commercial license of PBS member station WNEQ in Buffalo from the Western New York Public Broadcasting Association, re-launching it as commercial station WNLO.

The company exercised and closed on options to purchase WOTV in Battle Creek, Michigan, and WVBT in Norfolk, Virginia, both stations that it had already managed, in January 2002.

In February, LIN TV agreed to acquire seven stations in six markets from Sunrise Television. The transaction of the stations was completed in May. Also in May, LIN TV completed the issuance of 19.55 million shares of Class A Common Stock through its initial public offering on the New York Stock Exchange.

In December 2002, LIN TV announced the sale of two television stations in Abilene and San Angelo, Texas. This was followed in January 2004 by the sale of a station in Flint, Michigan.

In 2004, LIN TV announced that they signed a deal with NBC to switch its Dayton station WDTN, along with LIN-operated WAND, from ABC to NBC. In both markets, Sinclair Broadcast Group owned the previous NBC affiliates, which signed with ABC.

In February 2005, LIN TV announced purchase of two UPN stations from Viacom: WWHO in Columbus, Ohio, and WNDY-TV in Indianapolis. In late August 2005, LIN TV purchased several stations from Emmis Communications: WALA-TV and WBPG (now WFNA) in Mobile, Alabama, WTHI-TV in Terre Haute, Indiana, KRQE in Albuquerque, New Mexico, and WLUK-TV in Green Bay, Wisconsin. In July 2006, LIN announced the planned purchase of a second station in New Mexico, KASA-TV, from Raycom Media.

In May 2006, LIN TV announced the sale of Puerto Rico stations WAPA-TV and WJPX to InterMedia Partners for $130 million.

In November 2007, LIN TV completed the sale of its share of WAND to Block Communications. With this sale, LIN TV no longer manages the station.

On October 3, 2008, LIN TV&#x27;s stations were dropped from Time Warner Cable, due to a dispute over &quot;retransmission fees&quot;. LIN&#x27;s stations returned to Time Warner on October 29, 2008.

Also during fall 2008, LIN TV and Fox Interactive Media developed a new Web CMS platform which would initially host the Web sites of all of the stations owned by LIN TV and those owned by Fox Television Stations. This division would be spun off in 2009 as the independent company Canvas Technology, which would change its name to EndPlay in 2010. With Fox Television Stations abandoning the EndPlay platform in favor of WorldNow during 2012, LIN TV became EndPlay&#x27;s largest client, followed by the E. W. Scripps Company (which adopted the EndPlay platform during 2010).

On August 7, 2009, LIN TV introduced mobile TV BlackBerry service on six of its stations, with plans for 27 more stations to be added. The strategy accompanied a 20 percent second-quarter revenue decline; at the same time, digital revenue rose 52 percent.

On October 6, 2009, LIN TV acquired RM Media, an online advertising and media services startup based in Austin. RM Media connected targeted audiences with advertisers and publishers based on demographic, psychographic and consumer behaviors to enhance branding and maximize client return on investment. RM Media developed extensive proprietary technology including a consumer- and advertiser-friendly video player, a top 35 comScore display ad network, a highly effective Search Engine Optimization and Search Engine Marketing process, and acquired and integrated two companies that specialize in web development and lead generation, launched two top 100 comScore proprietary websites and services several Fortune 500 clients.

A rebranding to LIN Media was announced on April 13, 2010; although the corporate name remained LIN TV Corporation, the new name emphasized the company&#x27;s Internet and mobile interests.

On June 4, 2010, LIN TV reached a deal with ACME Communications on a shared services agreement involving ACME and LIN-owned stations in the Green Bay, Dayton, and Albuquerque markets. LIN TV would then provide technical, engineering, promotional, administrative and other operational support services for ACME&#x27;s CW stations, as well as provide advertising sales services under a related but separate joint sales agreement. This was followed on September 2 by the announcement that LIN would be acquiring two of the ACME stations, WBDT in Dayton, Ohio, and WIWB in Green Bay, Wisconsin. WIWB, which has since taken the new calls WCWF, would become owned by LIN outright while WBDT would be technically owned by Vaughan Media but controlled by LIN who would hold an ownership stake in that company. The FCC approved the sales of WBDT and WCWF in April 2011.

On March 4, 2011, LIN TV&#x27;s contract with Dish Network expired, and all 31 LIN TV affiliated stations were pulled from local Dish Network broadcasts. LIN TV initially demanded a price increase of 140% from Dish Network, a number that skyrocketed to 175% after the contract expired. The channels returned to Dish Network on March 13, 2011. In 2011, LIN sold WWHO to Manhan Media, who entered into an SSA with Sinclair Broadcast Group, owners of WSYX and operators of WTTE; the deal was finalized in February 2012.

=== 2012: New Vision acquisition, NBC sale ===
On May 7, 2012, LIN TV announced that it would acquire the 13 television stations owned by New Vision Television for $330.4 million and the assumption of $12 million in debt. The agreement included operational control of three stations currently owned by PBC Broadcasting involved in shared service agreements with New Vision-owned stations in three markets. The three PBC-owned stations (KTKA-TV in Topeka, Kansas, WTGS in Savannah, Georgia, and WYTV in Youngstown, Ohio) were sold to Vaughan Media, but were operated by LIN TV under shared service agreements. The transaction was finalized on October 12.

On February 13, 2013, LIN TV announced that it would be re-organized into a new company, LIN Media, LLC. Also on that date, LIN pulled out of its Station Venture Operations joint venture with NBCUniversal, giving NBC 100% ownership of KNSD and KXAS-TV. LIN paid NBC around $100 million to allow for the transaction. The re-organization was completed on July 30.

=== 2014: Media General merger ===
On March 21, 2014, LIN announced that it would sell itself to Media General, in a transaction described as a &quot;merger&quot;. The deal, worth an estimated $1.6 billion, would create an entity of 71 stations (adjusted for side deals and divestitures) that would reach approximately 24% of U.S. television households. In order to comply with FCC ownership rules as well as planned changes to rules regarding same-market television stations which would prohibit future joint sales agreements, Media General and LIN divested and swapped stations that both companies own in Birmingham, Green Bay, Mobile, Providence and Savannah. The companies swapped WTGS, WJAR, WLUK-TV and WCWF to Sinclair Broadcast Group in exchange for KXRM-TV, KXTU-LD, and WTTA. Hearst Television acquired WJCL and WVTM-TV, and Meredith Corporation acquired WALA-TV (Meredith later merged with Gray Television).

The deal was approved by shareholders on October 6, 2014, and by the FCC on December 12, 2014. The merger was completed on December 19. Although the combined company adopted the Media General name, the company was taken over by the principal staff of LIN, including CEO Vincent Sadusky, who replaced Media General&#x27;s CEO George Mahoney post-merger. In total, 45 Media General staff members were laid off as part of the merger.

On January 11, 2017, the FCC approved the sale of Media General to Nexstar Broadcasting Group; the sale was completed on January 17.

<text>Laomedeia , also known as Neptune XII, is a prograde irregular satellite of Neptune. It was discovered by Matthew J. Holman, et al. on August 13, 2002. Before the announcement of its name on February 3, 2007 (IAUC 8802), it was known as S/2002 N 3.

It orbits Neptune at a distance of about 23,571,000 km and is about 42 kilometers in diameter (assuming albedo of 0.04). It is named after Laomedeia, one of the 50 Nereids.

<text>Neso , also known as Neptune XIII, is the second-outermost known natural satellite of Neptune, after S/2021 N 1. It is a retrograde irregular moon discovered by Matthew J. Holman, Brett J. Gladman, &quot;et al.&quot; on 14 August 2002, though it went unnoticed until 2003. Neso is the second-most distant moon of Neptune, with an average orbital distance of nearly 49.6 million km. At its farthest point of its orbit, the satellite is more than 72 million km from Neptune. This distance exceeds Mercury&#x27;s aphelion, which is approximately 70 million km from the Sun.
Neso is also the moon with the second-longest orbital period, 26.67 years. It follows a retrograde, highly inclined, and highly eccentric orbit illustrated on the diagram in relation to other irregular satellites of Neptune. The satellites above the horizontal axis are prograde, the satellites beneath it are retrograde. The yellow segments extend from the pericentre to the apocentre, showing the eccentricity.

Neso is affected by the Kozai mechanism.

Neso is about in diameter based on an assumed albedo of 0.04.

Given the similarity of the orbit&#x27;s parameters with Psamathe (S/2003 N 1), it was suggested that both irregular satellites could have a common origin in the break-up of a larger moon.

Neso is named after one of the Nereids. Before it was officially named on 3 February 2007 (IAUC 8802), Neso was known by its provisional designation, S/2002 N 4.

<text>Psamathe , also known as Neptune X, is a retrograde irregular satellite of Neptune. It is named after Psamathe, one of the Nereids. Psamathe was discovered by Scott S. Sheppard and David C. Jewitt in 2003 using the 8.2 meter Subaru Telescope. Before it was officially named on February 3, 2007 (IAUC 8802), it was known by the provisional designation S/2003 N 1.
Psamathe is about 38 kilometers in diameter. It orbits Neptune at a distance of between 25.7 and 67.7 million km (for comparison, the Sun-Mercury distance varies between 46 million and 69.8 million km) and requires almost 25 Earth years to make one orbit. The orbit of this satellite is close to the theoretical stable separation from Neptune for a body in a retrograde orbit. Given the similarity of Psamathe&#x27;s orbital parameters with Neso (S/2002 N 4), it was suggested that both irregular satellites could have a common origin in the breakup of a larger moon. Both are farther from their primary than any other known moon in the Solar System.

<text>Rhys Henry Hughes (born 1966, Cardiff, Wales) is a Welsh fantasy writer and essayist.

==Career==

Born in Cardiff, Hughes has written in a variety of forms, from short stories to novels.

His long novel &quot;Engelbrecht Again!&quot; is a sequel to Maurice Richardson&#x27;s 1950 cult classic &quot;The Exploits of Engelbrecht&quot; and is the most radical of Hughes&#x27;s books, making extensive use of lipograms, typographical tricks, coded passages and other OuLiPo techniques.

His main project consists of authoring a 1,000-story cycle of both tightly and loosely interconnected tales.

=== File systems optimized for flash memory, solid state media ===
Solid state media, such as flash memory, are similar to disks in their interfaces, but have different problems. At low level, they require special handling such as wear leveling and different error detection and correction algorithms. Typically a device such as a solid-state drive handles such operations internally and therefore a regular file system can be used. However, for certain specialized installations (embedded systems, industrial applications) a file system optimized for plain flash memory is advantageous.

* APFS – Apple File System is a next-generation file system for Apple products.
* CHFS – a NetBSD filesystem for embedded systems optimised for raw flash media.
* exFAT – Microsoft proprietary system intended for flash cards (see also XCFiles, an exFAT implementation for Wind River VxWorks and other embedded operating systems).

This file system is best suited for embedded applications requiring heavy data workloads over long-term operations. Reliance Velocity can used for all block based media like eMMC, UFS, eSD, SD card, CF card, and SSD. It is compatible for Linux, Android and QNX with portability to other embedded operating systems.
* Reliance Edge - a proprietary file system by Tuxera for resource-constrained embedded systems. It has built-in data integrity with copy-on-write transactional technology and deterministic operations. This file system can be used for block based media and is configurable for Small POSIX, Full POSIX and can be ported to many RTOS environments. Tuxera has a certified version of this file system called Reliance Assure. The source code of Reliance Assure is complaint to MISRA C and developed following the ASPICE framework.

=== Record-oriented file systems ===
In record-oriented file systems files are stored as a collection of records. They are typically associated with mainframe and minicomputer operating systems. Programs read and write whole records, rather than bytes or arbitrary byte ranges, and can seek to a record boundary but not within records. The more sophisticated record-oriented file systems have more in common with simple databases than with other file systems.

* CMS file system – The native file system of the Conversational Monitor System component of VM/370
* Files-11 – early versions were record-oriented; support for &quot;streams&quot; was added later
* Michigan Terminal System (MTS) – provides &quot;line files&quot; where record lengths and line numbers are associated as metadata with each record in the file, lines can be added, replaced, updated with the same or different length records, and deleted anywhere in the file without the need to read and rewrite the entire file.
* OS4000 for GEC&#x27;s OS4000 operating system, on the GEC 4000 series minicomputers
* A FAT12 and FAT16 (and FAT32) extension to support database-like file types &quot;random file&quot;, &quot;direct file&quot;, &quot;keyed file&quot; and &quot;sequential file&quot; in Digital Research FlexOS, IBM 4680 OS and Toshiba 4690 OS. The record size is stored on a file-by-file basis in special entries in the directory table.
* Sequential access methods for IBM&#x27;s z/OS and z/VSE mainframe operating systems: Basic Sequential Access Method (BSAM), Basic Partitioned Access Method (BPAM) and Queued Sequential Access Method (QSAM); see Access methods and Data set (IBM mainframe) for more examples

* Shared File System (SFS) for IBM&#x27;s VM
* Virtual Storage Access Method (VSAM) for IBM&#x27;s z/OS and z/VSE mainframe operating systems

=== Shared-disk file systems ===
Shared-disk file systems (also called &quot;shared-storage file systems&quot;, SAN file system, Clustered file system or even &quot;cluster file systems&quot;) are primarily used in a storage area network where all nodes directly access the block storage where the file system is located. This makes it possible for nodes to fail without affecting access to the file system from the other nodes. Shared-disk file systems are normally used in a high-availability cluster together with storage on hardware RAID. Shared-disk file systems normally do not scale over 64 or 128 nodes.

Shared-disk file systems may be symmetric where metadata is distributed among the nodes or asymmetric with centralized metadata servers.

The distribution attributes are stored on a file-by-file basis in special entries in the directory table.
* OpenHarmony Distributed File System (HMDFS) used for Huawei&#x27;s HarmonyOS with HarmonyOS NEXT base and OpenHarmony-based operating systems, alongside openEuler server OS that is a cross-device file access where devices can read and edit files on transparently when the two devices are connected to the same network with Access token manager. Multiple embedded devices connected to the network can automatically synchronise file data with the edge server.

=== Distributed parallel file systems ===
Distributed parallel file systems stripe data over multiple servers for high performance. They are normally used in high-performance computing (HPC).

Some of the distributed parallel file systems use an object storage device (OSD) (in Lustre called OST) for chunks of data together with centralized metadata servers.

=== Distributed parallel fault-tolerant file systems ===
Distributed file systems, which also are parallel and fault tolerant, stripe and replicate data over multiple servers for high performance and to maintain data integrity. Even if a server fails no data is lost. The file systems are used in both high-performance computing (HPC) and high-availability clusters.

<text>Francesco Manca (born November 1966, in Milan, Italy) is an Italian amateur astronomer and discoverer of minor planets at the Sormano Astronomical Observatory in northern Italy.

Manca also performs follow-up astrometry of near-Earth objects (NEOs). He acquired research and observational experience on the NEOs at professional observatories in Arizona, United States at Catalina Sky Survey (IAU Obs code 703 and G96) Non-observational work focuses on computations of orbit and close approaches of asteroids with the Earth (linked at Center for Near Earth Object Studies (CNEOS) - Jet Propulsion Laboratory) and computation of orbit identifications of asteroids (Near Earth Asteroids, Mars-crossing asteroids, Hungaria group, Trans-Neptunian object) and comets.

He wrote many articles on specialistic magazines. Member of SIMCA (), associated (INAF) National Institute for Astrophysics and International Asteroid Warning Network (IAWN). His professional activity concerns the application of measuring systems as encoders for Right Ascension and Declination (azimuth and elevation), installed on telescopes and Radio telescopes such as the VLT, LBT, ELT (Extremely Large Telescope), ALMA (Atacama Large Millimeter Array), DAG (Turkish for Eastern Anatolia Observatory), ASTRI (Astrophysics with mirrors at Italian Replicant Technology) and NEOSTEL (FlyEye telescope) for ESA or on space instruments as Solar Monitoring Observatory.

The Koronian asteroid 15460 Manca, discovered by Andrea Boattini and Luciano Tesi at San Marcello Pistoiese Observatory in 1998, is named in his honour.
