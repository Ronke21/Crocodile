<text>Cannibal Ox is an American hip hop duo from Harlem, New York, United States. It consists of Vast Aire and Vordul Mega, often accompanied by DJ Cip-One.

==History==
The members of Cannibal Ox, Vast Aire and Vordul Mega, met each other as high school students in Harlem. They began performing in the New York underground hip hop scene in the 1990s, leading them to meet El-P and become among the first members of his record label Definitive Jux.

In 2001, Cannibal Ox released their debut studio album, &quot;The Cold Vein&quot;. It was the first full-length studio album released by Definitive Jux, and was fully produced by El-P. &quot;The Cold Vein&quot; received positive reviews from critics and put the duo in the underground hip hop spotlight, and it has been highlighted as one of underground hip hop&#x27;s best albums by outlets such as &quot;Fact&quot; and &quot;HipHopDX&quot;. However, the duo did not release any further projects until the 2005 live album &quot;Return of the Ox: Live at CMJ&quot;. The liner notes of &quot;Return of the Ox&quot; hinted that a Cannibal Ox LP would be released in 2006, though the duo ultimately released no music that year.

In March 2007, El-P stated that he &quot;really doubt[ed]&quot; that a second Cannibal Ox album would be released in the near future. Later that year, Vast Aire confirmed that he was no longer working with Definitive Jux, and that plans for a new Cannibal Ox LP had been scrapped. He cited creative and financial differences with El-P and Definitive Jux, as well as Vordul&#x27;s alleged clinical depression. Though the group&#x27;s members did not collaborate under the Cannibal Ox name in the late 2000s, Vast Aire made a guest appearance on Vordul&#x27;s 2008 album &quot;Megagraphitti&quot;, and Vordul appeared on Vast Aire&#x27;s albums &quot;Dueces Wild&quot; (2008) and &quot;OX 2010: A Street Odyssey&quot; (2010). In May 2011, El-P stated on his Facebook page that &quot;there wont ever be a can[nibal] ox album produced by me again and thats a fact.&quot;

On April 16, 2013, Cannibal Ox released a single titled &quot;Gotham&quot;, produced by Bill Cosmiq. The duo&#x27;s next project was &quot;Blade of the Ronin&quot;, their second studio album, which was released through iHipHop Distribution on March 3, 2015. &quot;Blade of the Ronin&quot; was produced by Bill Cosmiq and Black Milk.

<text>In the Book of Genesis, the mountains of Ararat (Biblical Hebrew , Tiberian &quot;&quot;, Septuagint: ) is the term used to designate the region in which Noah&#x27;s Ark comes to rest after the Great Flood. It corresponds to the ancient Assyrian term Urartu, an exonym for the Armenian Kingdom of Van.

Since the Middle Ages the &quot;mountains of Ararat&quot; began to be identified with a mountain in present Turkey known as Masis or Ağrı Dağı; the mountain became known as Mount Ararat.

==History==

Citing historians Berossus, Hieronymus the Egyptian, Mnaseas, and Nicolaus of Damascus, Josephus writes in his &quot;Antiquities of the Jews&quot; that &quot;[t]he ark rested on the top of a certain mountain in Armenia, ... over Minyas, called &quot;Baris&quot;&quot;.

Likewise, in the Latin Vulgate, Jerome translates Genesis 8:4 to read: &quot;Requievitque arca ... super montes Armeniae&quot; (&quot;and the ark rested ... on the mountains of Armenia&quot;); though in the &quot;Nova Vulgata&quot; as promulgated after the Second Vatican Council, the toponym is amended to &quot;montes Ararat&quot; (&quot;mountains of Ararat&quot;).

By contrast, early Syrian and Eastern tradition placed the ark on Mount Judi in what is today Şırnak Province, Southeastern Anatolia Region, an association that had faded by the Middle Ages and is now mostly confined to Quranic tradition.

The Book of Jubilees specifies that the ark came to rest on the peak of Lubar, a mountain of Ararat.

Sir Walter Raleigh devotes several chapters of his &quot;Historie of the World&quot; (1614) to an argument that in ancient times the mountains of Ararat were understood to include not only those of Armenia, but also all of the taller mountain-ranges extending into Asia. He maintains that since Armenia is not actually located east of Shinar, the ark must have landed somewhere in the Orient.

<text>The Central Arizona Project (CAP) is a 336 mi (541 km) diversion canal in Arizona in the southern United States.

The aqueduct diverts water from the Colorado River at the Bill Williams Wildlife Refuge south portion of Lake Havasu near Parker into central and southern Arizona. CAP is managed and operated by the Central Arizona Water Conservation District (CAWCD). It was shepherded through Congress by Carl Hayden.

== Description ==

The CAP delivers Colorado River water, either directly or by exchange, into central and Southern Arizona. The project was envisioned to provide water to nearly one million acres (405,000 hectares) of irrigated agricultural land areas in Maricopa, Pinal, and Pima counties, as well as municipal water for several Arizona communities, including the metropolitan areas of Phoenix and Tucson. Authorization also was included for development of facilities to deliver water to Catron, Hidalgo, and Grant counties in New Mexico, but these facilities have not been constructed because of cost considerations, a lack of demand for the water, lack of repayment capability by the users, and environmental constraints.

In addition to its water supply benefits, the project also provides substantial benefits from flood control, outdoor recreation, fish and wildlife conservation, and sediment control. It also produces an unintended swale, further increasing local biodiversity. The project was subdivided, for administration and construction purposes, into the Granite Reef, Orme, Salt-Gila, Gila River, Tucson, Indian Distribution, and Colorado River divisions. During project construction, the Orme Division was reformulated and renamed the Regulatory Storage Division. Upon completion, the Granite Reef Division was renamed the Hayden-Rhodes Aqueduct, and the Salt-Gila Division was renamed the Fannin-McFarland Aqueduct.

The 456 billion gallons (1.4 million acre feet) of water is lifted by up to 2,900 feet by 14 pumps using 2.5 million MWh of electricity each year [285 MW], making CAP the largest power user in Arizona. Lake Pleasant is used as a buffer.

The canal loses approximately 16,000 acre-feet (5.2 billion gallons) of water each year to evaporation. It loses 9,000 acre-feet (2.9 billion gallons) annually from water seeping or leaking through the concrete.

== History ==
The CAP was created by the Colorado River Basin Project Act of 1968, signed by US President Lyndon B. Johnson on September 30, 1968. Senator Ernest McFarland, along with Senator Carl Hayden, lobbied for the Central Arizona Project (CAP) aimed at providing Arizona&#x27;s share of the Colorado River to the state. McFarland&#x27;s efforts failed as senator; however, they laid a critical foundation for the eventual passage of the CAP in the late 1960s.

According to the &quot;Arizona Republic&quot;, Senator Barry Goldwater, Senator Hayden, Representative Morris Udall, US Secretary of the Interior Stewart Udall and other Arizona leaders teamed up on the successful passage of what was McFarland&#x27;s intended legislation that became the CAP, &quot;probably the state&#x27;s most celebrated bipartisan achievement of the 20th century.&quot; This act provided for the US Secretary of the Interior to enter into an agreement with non-federal interests, whereby the US federal government acquired the right to 24.3 percent of the power produced at the non-federal Navajo Generating Station, Navajo Project. The agreement also includes the delivery of power and energy over the transmission facilities to delivery points within the Central Arizona Project service area.

Construction of the project began in 1973 with the award of a contract for the Havasu Intake Channel Dike and excavation for the Havasu Pumping Plant (later renamed as the Mark Wilmer Pumping Plant) on the shores of Lake Havasu. Construction of the other project features, such as the New Waddell Dam, followed. The backbone aqueduct system, which runs about from Lake Havasu to a terminus southwest of Tucson, was declared substantially complete in 1993. The new and modified dams constructed as part of the project were declared substantially complete in 1994. All of the non-Native American agricultural water distribution systems were completed in the late 1980s, as were most of the municipal water delivery systems. Several Native American distribution systems remain to be built; it is estimated that full development of these systems could require another 10 to 20 years.

The Hayden-Rhodes Aqueduct, which carries water from Lake Havasu to the Phoenix area, includes three tunnels totaling 8.2 miles.

The CAP partly funded the Brock Reservoir project with $28.6 million. In return for its contribution, Arizona has been awarded of water per year since 2016.

The CAP project brought river water to Tucson successfully, but the initial implementation was called a &quot;debacle&quot; by the &quot;Tucson Weekly&quot;. The river water had a different mineral mixture and flow pattern from the aquifer water, stirring up and dislodging rust and biofilm in municipal water mains and house pipes.

By the end of 1993, the city of Tucson paid about $145,000 to install filters in 925 homes, lost about $200,000 in revenues by adjusting water bills, and paid about $450,000 in damages claimed by homeowners for ruined pipes, water heaters, and other appliances. The city returned some houses to groundwater, but problems remained. Zinc orthophosphate was added to coat the pipes and prevent the rust from dislodging, but the return to groundwater removed the zinc orthophosphate. The solution was a US Environmental Protection Agency-funded &quot;blended&quot; water system, including automatically monitoring water quality throughout Tucson, and a website to report the water quality to the public without intervention by the Tucson Water Department.

<text>Abbot&#x27;s Hill School is an independent day school for girls aged 4–16 years and a day nursery and pre-school for girls and boys from 6 months in Hemel Hempstead, Hertfordshire in the United Kingdom.

== History ==
The School celebrated its 100th anniversary in 2012, having been founded on the present site by Alice, Katrine and Mary Baird who also ran a school in the Malverns. The School&#x27;s central building was built in 1836 by the paper manufacturer, John Dickinson, as a home for him and his family and he named it Abbot&#x27;s Hill. The Dickinson family founded one of the world&#x27;s largest stationery firms of the 19th and 20th centuries and John Dickinson&#x27;s grandson sold Abbot&#x27;s Hill to the Baird sisters.

Over the years the School has developed and grown in a variety of ways, but the key milestones in its history were in 1969, when St Nicholas House School moved to the Abbot&#x27;s Hill site to form the Junior Department, and in 2003, when boarding ceased. However, the School retains &quot;its boarding feel&quot;, which is to be seen in the extended school day, the emphasis given to extra-curricular pursuits, the intrinsic importance of pastoral care and the School&#x27;s strong sense of community.

==Abbot&#x27;s Hill House==
It had been the home of the inventor and entrepreneur John Dickinson (1782–1869) who was his own architect in its building, just east of his paper mill, Nash Mill. Construction commenced in 1836. The building material was unusual, being dark grey stone setts, taken from the railway lines when replaced by wooden sleepers. The house design was unusual, having only a single door to the outside despite its size. John Dickinson&#x27;s youngest daughter Harriet Ann (1823–1858) married Sir John Evans, KCB (1823–1908), and their son Sir Arthur John Evans (1851–1941) inherited Abbot&#x27;s Hill but never lived there.

== Structure ==

The School is very much an all-through school, although for the purposes of educational and pastoral management it is divided into two parts, the Senior School and the Prep School, which are located on the same site. The Head of Senior School and Head of Prep School have responsibility for the day-to-day running of the Senior and Prep Schools and they are supported by their own separate management teams.

The Senior School educates about 260 girls from Years 7 to 11. The normal size of a year group is around 50 girls. About two-thirds of the girls joining Year 7 come from the Prep School, although the proportion fluctuates from year to year. The Prep School educates about 190 pupils from Nursery to Year 6. There are some boys on the roll in the Nursery and in Reception.

In addition to their forms and year groups, the Prep and Senior girls belong to one of three pupil-led Clans - Cameron, Macneil and MacDonald, which act as the equivalent of houses - which provide the opportunity for competitions of many kinds. The fact that the School educates girls only up to the age of 16 offers pupils an opportunity to take responsibility at an earlier age than in many schools, allowing them to develop proficiency in management, organisation and leadership. The most public example of this was the success of Abbot&#x27;s Hill pupil Zara Brownless, winner of 2011&#x27;s BBC &quot;Young Apprentice&quot;.

== Sports, the arts and extra-curricular activities ==

The School has programmes of creative, sporting, cultural and recreational opportunities. Girls of all ages are involved in dramatic and musical productions throughout the year. There are many opportunities for ensemble performance, particularly choral.

There is also a wide variety of clubs and extra-curricular activities including skiing, strategic thinking, debating, chamber choir, music, drama, STEM club, languages, art and sports. The younger girls&#x27; activities include golf, calligraphy, science, art, sports, board games and dance. These in-house activities are complemented by an array of trips and visits for senior and prep pupils.

==Notable former pupils==

* Jane Scott, Duchess of Buccleuch, model
* Katharine Elliot, Baroness Elliot of Harwood, public servant and politician
* Marilyn Okoro, British 800m and 4 × 400 m Athlete
* Montana Brown, Love Island Star
* Honor Salmon (née Pitman), Air Transport Auxiliary pilot killed in service in Second World War.

<doc id="763464" wikidata="Q5257036" url="?curid=763464" title="Denied area">
<text>Denied area is an intelligence term of art describing an extremely hostile operational environment with heavy surveillance. 

The United States Department of Defense defines a denied area as &quot;an area under enemy or unfriendly control in which friendly forces cannot expect to operate successfully within existing operational constraints and force capabilities.&quot;

When a reference is made to a friendly force denying an area to the enemy, such as a reference to friendly forces employing area-denial weapons, the intent is to create an area in which the enemy cannot operate without extreme risk.

Land mines can be used as area-denial weapons, and some modern semi-autonomous or remotely controlled artillery units can serve this purpose as well. In theory, nuclear, biological, and chemical weapons can also serve this purpose, for varying lengths of time, though such weapons have not yet been used for this purpose in major wars, although such weapons have been used for other purposes.

Some effective tactics for creating a denied area do not require a significant continuing commitment of personnel or additional material. For example, once a minefield is in place, no upkeep is required unless a significant percentage of the mines have been detonated or destroyed—no residual force commitment is required. This is why a denied area may well exist behind enemy lines when, if it were secured by friendly forces on the ground, it might be considered a forward position. When hostilities end, these areas can be very dangerous and expensive to clean up, assuming that one of the combatants is willing to. (see UXO, bomb disposal, land mine, and the contamination concerns for unconventional weapons).

A dirty bomb is a potential option for an area denial weapon that might be more accessible to small paramilitary or terrorist groups.

<doc id="763466" wikidata="Q931380" url="?curid=763466" title="Lancia Stratos">
<text>The Lancia Stratos HF (&quot;Tipo 829&quot;), known as Lancia Stratos, is a rear mid-engined sports car designed for rallying, made by Italian car manufacturer Lancia. It was highly successful in competition, winning the World Rally Championship in 1974, 1975 and 1976; as well as winning the 1974 Targa Florio, winning the Tour de France Automobile five times and the Giro d&#x27;Italia automobilistico three times.

== History ==
Lancia traditionally used the design house Pininfarina and had not used Bertone before. Bertone desired to create an opportunity for a relationship with Lancia and knew that Lancia was looking for a replacement for the aging Fulvia for use in rally sports. Bertone decided to design an eye-catching model to show to Lancia. Bertone used the running gear of a Fulvia Coupé which belonged to one of his friends and built a running model around it. When Bertone himself appeared at the Lancia factory gates with the Stratos Zero he passed underneath the barrier, to great applause from the Lancia workers. After that Lancia and Bertone agreed to develop a new rally car based on the ideas of Bertone&#x27;s designer Marcello Gandini. Gandini had already designed the Lamborghini Miura and was working on the Countach at the time.

Lancia presented the Bertone-designed Lancia Stratos HF prototype at the 1971 Turin Motor Show, a year after the announcement of the Stratos Zero concept car. The prototype Stratos HF (Chassis 1240) was fluorescent red in colour and featured a distinctive crescent-shaped wrap-around windshield providing maximum forward visibility with almost no rear visibility. The prototype had three different engines in its early development life: the Lancia Fulvia engine, the Lancia Beta engine and finally, for the 1971 public launch, the mid-mounted Dino Ferrari V6 producing in road trim. The use of this engine had been planned from the beginning of the project, but Enzo Ferrari was reluctant to sign off the use of this engine in a car he saw as a competitor to his own Dino V6. After the production of the Dino had ended, the &quot;Commendatore&quot; (a popular nickname for Enzo Ferrari) agreed to deliver the engines for the Stratos, upon which Lancia suddenly received 500 units.

The final design shares several striking features with Gandini&#x27;s Lamborghini Miura: the dual clamshell hoods (the front opening forward, over the spare wheel placed identically, and the rear hinging rearward, with stepped black louvres above the engine and integrating a trunk &quot;behind&quot; it) – as well as the way the door-glass bottom rears curve upward, giving the otherwise frameless doors an upward-swept frame section. In contrast though, the Stratos&#x27; body received an unmistakable short and wide wedge shape, so extreme that the nose drops below the top crests of the front wheel wells, and made unique by the semi-elliptical greenhouse&#x27;s windshield and door glass ensemble, when seen from above.

The Stratos was a successful rally car during the 1970s and early 1980s. It started a new era in rallying as it was the first car designed from scratch for this kind of competition. The three leading men behind the entire rallying project were Lancia team manager Cesare Fiorio, British racer/engineer Mike Parkes and factory rally driver Sandro Munari, with Bertone&#x27;s Designer Marcello Gandini taking a personal interest in designing and producing the bodywork. A dedicated calculations engineer from Lancia was tasked with performing calculations on many of the chassis, steering, suspension and engine components: Nicola Materazzi.

Lancia undertook extensive testing with the Stratos and raced the car in several racing events where Group 5 prototypes were allowed during the 1972 and 1973 seasons. Production of the 500 cars required for homologation in Group 4 commenced in 1973 and the Stratos was homologated for the 1974 World Rally Championship season. The Ferrari Dino V6 engine was phased out in 1974, but 500 engines - among the last examples built - were delivered to Lancia. Production ended in 1975, when it was thought that only 492 were made (for the 1976 season, the Group 4 production requirement was reduced to 400 in 24 months). The manufacturer of the car was Bertone in Turin, with final assembly by Lancia at the Chivasso plant. Powered by the Dino 2.4 L V6 engine that was also fitted to the rallying versions, but in a lower state of tune, it resulted in a power output of at 7,000 rpm and at 4,000 rpm of torque, giving the road car a 0– time of 6.8 seconds, and a top speed of . The car was sold as the Lancia Stratos HF Stradale.
The Stratos weighed between 900 and 950 kilograms, depending on configuration. Power output was around for the original 12 valve version and for the 24 valve version. Beginning with the 1978 season the 24 valve heads were banned from group 4 competition by a change to the FIA rules (which would have required additional production of 24-valve cars for re-homologation). Even with this perceived power deficit the Stratos was the car to beat in competition and when it did not suffer an accident or premature transmission failure (of the latter there were many) it had great chances to win.

The car won the 1974, 1975 and 1976 championship titles in the hands of Sandro Munari and Björn Waldegård, and might have gone on to win more had not internal politics within the Fiat group placed rallying responsibility on the Fiat 131 Abarths. As well as victories on the 1975, 1976 and 1977 Monte Carlo Rally, all courtesy of Munari, the Stratos won the event with the private Chardonnet Team as late as 1979.

Without support from Fiat, and despite new regulations that restricted engine power, the car would remain a serious competitor and proved able to beat works cars in several occasions when entered by an experienced private team with a talented driver. The last victory of the Stratos was in 1981, at the Tour de Corse Automobile, another World Rally Championship event, with a victory by longtime Stratos privateer Bernard Darniche.

When the Fiat group favoured the Fiat 131 for rallying, Lancia also built two Group 5 turbocharged &#x27;silhouette&#x27; Stratos for closed-track endurance racing. The powertrain and aerodynamics were engineered by Nicola Materazzi based on experience gained with the earlier generation. These cars failed against the Porsche 935s on closed tracks but proved successful in hybrid events. Stratos won a record 5 times the Tour de France Automobile between 1973 and 1980, and also the 1974, 1976 and 1978 Giro d&#x27;Italia automobilistico, an Italian counterpart of the Tour de France Automobile. One of the cars was destroyed in Zeltweg, when it caught fire due to overheating problems. The last surviving car would win the Giro d&#x27;Italia event again before it was shipped to Japan to compete in the Fuji Speedway based Formula Silhouette series, which was never raced. The car would then be sold and reside in the Matsuda Collection before then being sold to a collector of Stratos&#x27;, Ernst Hrabalek, who had the largest Lancia Stratos Collection in the world at the time, 11 unique Lancia Stratos cars, including the fluorescent red 1971 factory prototype and the 1977 Safari Rally car. The Stratos also gained limited success in 24 Hours of Le Mans, with a car, driven by Christine Dacremont and Lella Lombardi, finishing 20th overall and 2nd in GTP class in 1976.
Another unique Group 5 car is the Lancia Stratos HF of Austrian Rallycross driver Andy Bentza. The car was first driven by his Memphis teammate Franz Wurz, father of Formula One pilot Alexander Wurz. In 1976 Wurz claimed the first ever European Rallycross title recognised by the FIA with the car, by then still featuring a 2.4 litre engine with first a 12 and later a 24 valve head. For the ERC series of 1977 Wurz was entrusted with an experimental 24 valve engine by Mike Parkes, equipped with a special crankshaft to bring the engine capacity up to just under 3000 cc. For 1978 Bentza took the Stratos over from Wurz, sold his own 2.4 L 12V Stratos to compatriot Reneé Vontsina, and won the GT Division title of the ERC. The one and only 3.0 litre Stratos worldwide was raced by Bentza till the end of 1983. After keeping the car for another 30 years Bentza has sold the Stratos to Alexander Wurz. It was fully restored over a period of almost two years and revealed to the public in May 2016, converted back to its 1976 rallycross specification with Memphis livery.

== Concept cars ==

=== Stratos Zero ===
The Lancia Stratos Zero (or 0) preceded the Lancia Stratos HF prototype by 12 months and was first shown to the public at the Turin Motor Show in 1970. The futuristic bodywork was designed by Marcello Gandini, head designer at Bertone, and featured a 1.6 L Lancia Fulvia V4 engine. The Lancia Stratos HF Zero was exhibited in Bertone&#x27;s museum for many years. In 2011, it was sold during an auction in Italy for €761,600. It has been displayed in the exhibit &quot;Sculpture in Motion: Masterpieces of Italian Design&quot; at the Petersen Automotive Museum in Los Angeles. It was at the High Museum of Art in Atlanta at the &quot;Dream Cars&quot; exhibit in 2014, on loan from the XJ Wang Collection of New York City.

The car&#x27;s body is wedge-shaped and finished in distinctive orange. It is unusually short in length () and height (), and it shares little with the production version. The Zero appeared in Michael Jackson&#x27;s 1988 film &quot;Moonwalker&quot;.

=== Lancia Sibilo ===

In 1978, Bertone created and designed a concept car based on the Stratos called the Sibilo. It was conceived as a futuristic two-seater coupè on the chassis of the Lancia Stratos, the wheelbase of which was lengthened from 2160 to 2280mm. The car&#x27;s glass surfaces seemed almost integrated into the volumes of the body, which looked like a monolithic sculpture of vigorous and smooth shape.

=== Stola S81 ===

In 2000, Marcello Gandini created a modern interpretation of his Lancia Stratos, commissioned by the Stola of Turin. A concept car that is a two-seater coupe built with Ciba LY 5185, a new material considered more useful than traditional clay.

=== Fenomenon Stratos (2005) ===
At the 2005 Geneva Auto Show, a British design firm known as Fenomenon, who had rights to the name, exhibited a retromodern concept version of the Stratos, designed by Chris Hrabalek and following its exhibition at the Frankfurt show, developed by Prodrive. The concept was based around a mid-mounted V8 engine.
== New Stratos ==
Following the stalled Fenomenon project, one interested backer funded a one-off model. Commissioned by Michael Stoschek (a keen rally driver and chairman of Brose Group) and his son, Maximilian, the New Stratos was announced in 2010 based on the overall design and concept of the original Stratos and was designed and developed by Pininfarina.

The car made use of a Ferrari 430 Scuderia as a donor car, using the chassis (shortened by resulting in a wheelbase of ) and much of the mechanical elements including the 4.3 L V8 engine (4,308 cm3), tuned to generate at 8,200 rpm and torque of at 3,750 rpm.

The New Stratos weighs and is claimed to accelerate to 100 km/h in 3.3 seconds and on to a top speed close to . While shorter than its donor car, the New Stratos is a little larger than the original Stratos, with a length of , wide and tall. There were reports that given sufficient interest a small production run of up to 25 cars could be possible. Ferrari did not consent to this plan, and forbade its suppliers to support the project. However, on 10 February 2018, Italian coachbuilding firm Manifattura Automobili Torino of Paolo Garella announced that it would be commencing with the production of the originally planned 25 cars. You can read a driving review of that car at this link. 

==In popular culture==

The Autobot character Wheeljack from the Transformers franchise transforms into an Alitalia-sponsored Stratos in the and its cartoon adaptation, albeit with the Alitalia markings on the toy intentionally misspelled as &quot;Alitalla&quot; (presumably to avoid trademark infringement). Earlier samples of the character&#x27;s toy from Takara&#x27;s &quot;Diaclone&quot; toy line (where most of &quot;Transformers&quot;&#x27; character designs came from) were sold with a Marlboro-inspired livery.

<doc id="763469" wikidata="Q7026281" url="?curid=763469" title="Nicholas Taaffe, 6th Viscount Taaffe">
<text>&quot;[[Generalfeldmarschall#Austrian Empire and Austria-Hungary|Feldmarschall]]&quot; Nicholas Taaffe, &quot;[[Graf]]&quot; von Taaffe, [[Viscount Taaffe|6th Viscount Taaffe and 6th Baron of Ballymote]] (about 168530 December 1769), was an Irish-born courtier and soldier who served the Habsburgs in Lorraine and Austria.

The first mention of the Taaffe family name appeared in Irish annals in the year 1284. Their seat was Smarmore Castle, located in County Louth, since 1320. Born at Crean&#x27;s Castle in County Sligo, and brought up as a Roman Catholic, Taaffe was the son of Francis Taaffe and Anna Maria Crean, and was a second cousin of the 5th Viscount Taaffe. He was educated in the Duchy of Lorraine and became the chancellor of Duke Leopold of Lorraine, father of the Holy Roman Emperor Francis I.

He entered the Habsburg Army, serving at Phillipsburg in Baden and in the campaign against France in 1734-5, the Turkish War of 1736-39, and was present in battle at Fort St. Elizabeth, Pallesch, and the Battle of Semlin. He succeeded to the peerage in 1738, and was promoted to Major-General (General Feldwachtmeister) in 1739. He also fought in the Silesian Wars against Prussia and distinguished himself, aged about 72, at Marshal Daun&#x27;s victory of Frederick the Great at Kolin in 1757. He was Chamberlain to Emperor Charles VII and Empress Maria Theresa. He is said to have introduced the growing of the potato to Silesia in 1763.

Under the reign of Queen Anne he lost his Irish estates to a Protestant relative when they were claimed under the Popery Act 1704 (2 Anne c. 6 (I)), leading to a lengthy lawsuit. After years, the case was ended by a compromise embodied in a private act of Parliament, by which the estates were sold and one-third of the value given to Nicholas Taaffe. With the money, he acquired the castle of Ellischau (Nalžovy) in Bohemia; he had also inherited other property in the Habsburg dominions. He was naturalised in Bohemia, and in 1738 inherited the title of Viscount Taaffe from a cousin. He left on record that the reason for becoming an Austrian was that he did not wish his descendants to be exposed to the temptation of becoming Protestants, so as to avoid the operation of the Penal Laws.

Taaffe had a distinguished career in the Habsburg Army; he eventually rose to the rank of a &quot;Feldmarschall&quot; (Field Marshal), and was created &quot;[[Graf]]&quot; von Taaffe (Count of Taaffe) by the Empress Maria Theresa.

<doc id="763478" wikidata="Q181568" url="?curid=763478" title="Ivan Aivazovsky">
<text>Ivan Konstantinovich Aivazovsky (; ) was a Russian Romantic painter who is considered one of the greatest masters of marine art. Baptized as Hovhannes Aivazian, he was born into an Armenian family in the Black Sea port of Feodosia in Crimea and was mostly based there.

Following his education at the Imperial Academy of Arts in Saint Petersburg, Aivazovsky traveled to Europe and lived briefly in Italy in the early 1840s. He then returned to Russia and was appointed the main painter of the Russian Navy. Aivazovsky had close ties with the military and political elite of the Russian Empire and often attended military maneuvers. He was sponsored by the state and was well-regarded during his lifetime. The saying &quot;worthy of Aivazovsky&#x27;s brush&quot;, popularized by Anton Chekhov, was used in Russia for describing something lovely. He remains highly popular in Russia in the 21st century.

One of the most prominent Russian artists of his time, Aivazovsky was also popular outside the Russian Empire. He held numerous solo exhibitions in Europe and the United States. During his almost 60-year career, he created around 6,000 paintings, making him one of the most prolific artists of his time. The vast majority of his works are seascapes, but he often depicted battle scenes, Armenian themes, and portraiture. Most of Aivazovsky&#x27;s works are kept in Russian, Ukrainian, Armenian, and Turkish museums as well as private collections.

==Life==
===Background===
Ivan Aivazovsky was born on in the city of Feodosia (Theodosia), Crimea, Russian Empire. In the baptismal records of the local St. Sargis Armenian Apostolic Church, Aivazovsky was listed as &quot;Hovhannes, son of Gevorg Aivazian&quot; (). During his study at the Imperial Academy of Arts, he was known in Russian as Ivan Gaivazovsky (Иванъ Гайвазовскій in the pre-1918 spelling). He became known as Aivazovsky since , while in Italy. He signed an 1844 letter with an Italianized rendition of his name: &quot;Giovani Aivazovsky&quot;.

His father, Konstantin, (–1840), was an Armenian merchant from the Polish region of Galicia. His family had migrated to Europe from Western Armenia in the 18th century. After numerous familial conflicts, Konstantin left Galicia for Moldavia, later moving to Bukovina, before settling in Feodosia in the early 1800s. He was initially known as Gevorg Aivazian (Haivazian or Haivazi), but he changed his last name to Gaivazovsky by adding the Slavic suffix &quot;-sky&quot;. Aivazovsky&#x27;s mother, Ripsime, was a Feodosia Armenian. The couple had five children—three daughters and two sons. Aivazovsky&#x27;s elder brother, Gabriel, was a prominent historian and an Armenian Apostolic archbishop.

===Education===
The young Aivazovsky received parochial education at Feodosia&#x27;s St. Sargis Armenian Church. He was taught drawing by Jacob Koch, a local architect. Aivazovsky moved to Simferopol with Taurida Governor Alexander Kaznacheyev&#x27;s family in 1830 and attended the city&#x27;s Russian gymnasium. In 1833, Aivazovsky arrived in the Russian capital, Saint Petersburg, to study at the Imperial Academy of Arts in Maxim Vorobiev&#x27;s landscape class. In 1835, he was awarded with a silver medal and appointed assistant to the French painter . In September 1836, Aivazovsky met Russia&#x27;s national poet Alexander Pushkin during the latter&#x27;s visit to the Academy. In 1837, Aivazovsky joined the battle-painting class of Alexander Sauerweid and participated in Baltic Fleet exercises in the Gulf of Finland. In October 1837, he graduated from the Imperial Academy of Arts with a gold medal, two years earlier than intended. Aivazovsky returned to Feodosia in 1838 and spent two years in his native Crimea. In 1839, he took part in military exercises in the shores of Crimea, where he met Russian admirals Mikhail Lazarev, Pavel Nakhimov and Vladimir Kornilov.

===First visit to Europe===

In 1840, Aivazovsky was sent by the Imperial Academy of Arts to study in Europe. He first traveled to Venice via Berlin and Vienna and visited San Lazzaro degli Armeni, where an important Armenian Catholic congregation was located and his brother Gabriel lived at the time. Aivazovsky studied Armenian manuscripts and became familiar with Armenian art. He met Russian novelist Nikolai Gogol in Venice. He then headed to Florence, Amalfi and Sorrento. In Florence, he met painter Alexander Ivanov. He remained in Naples and Rome between 1840 and 1842. Aivazovsky was heavily influenced by Italian art and their museums became the &quot;second academy&quot; for him. According to Rogachevsky the news of successful exhibitions in Italy reached Russia. Pope Gregory XVI awarded him with a golden medal. He then visited Switzerland, Germany, the Netherlands and Britain. In an international exhibition at the Louvre, he was the only representative from Russia. In France, he received a gold medal from the Académie royale de peinture et de sculpture. He then returned to Naples via Marseille and again visited Britain, Portugal, Spain, and Malta in 1843. Aivazovsky was admired throughout Europe. He returned to Russia via Paris and Amsterdam in 1844.

===Return to Russia and first marriage===
Upon his return to Russia, Aivazovsky was made an academician of the Imperial Academy of Arts and was appointed the &quot;official artist of the Russian Navy to paint seascapes, coastal scenes and naval battles.&quot; In 1845, Aivazovsky traveled to the Aegean Sea with Duke Konstantin Nikolayevich and visited the Ottoman capital, Constantinople, and the Greek islands of Patmos and Rhodes.

In 1845, Aivazovsky settled in his hometown of Feodosia, where he built a house and studio. He isolated himself from the outside world, keeping a small circle of friends and relatives. Yet the solitude played a negative role in his art career. By the mid-nineteenth century, Russian art was moving from Romanticism towards a distinct Russian style of Realism, while Aivazovsky continued to paint Romantic seascapes and attracted heavy criticism.

In 1845 and 1846, Aivazovsky attended the maneuvers of the Black Sea Fleet and the Baltic Fleet at Petergof, near the imperial palace. In 1847, he was given the title of professor of seascape painting by the Imperial Academy of Arts and elevated to the rank of nobility. In the same year, he was elected to the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences.

In 1848, Aivazovsky married Julia Graves, an English governess. They had four daughters: Elena (1849), Maria (1851), Alexandra (1852) and Joanne (1858). They separated in 1860 and divorced in 1877 with permission from the Armenian Church, since Graves was a Lutheran.

===Rise to prominence===

In 1851, traveling with the Russian emperor Nicholas I, Aivazovsky sailed to Sevastopol to participate in military maneuvers. His archaeological excavations near Feodosia lead to his election as a full member of the Russian Geographical Society in 1853. In that year, the Crimean War erupted between Russia and the Ottoman Empire, and he was evacuated to Kharkiv. While safe, he returned to the besieged fortress of Sevastopol to paint battle scenes. His work was exhibited in Sevastopol while it was under Ottoman siege.

Between 1856 and 1857, Aivazovsky worked in Paris and became the first Russian (and the first non-French) artist to receive the Legion of Honour. In 1857, Aivazovsky visited Constantinople and was awarded the Order of the Medjidie. In the same year, he was elected an honorary member of the Moscow Art Society. He was awarded the Greek Order of the Redeemer in 1859 and the Russian Order of St. Vladimir in 1865.

Aivazovsky opened an art studio in Feodosia in 1865 and was awarded a salary by the Imperial Academy of Arts the same year.
===Travels and accolades: 1860s–1880s===
In the 1860s, the artist produced several paintings inspired by Greek nationalism and the Italian unification. In 1868, he once again visited Constantinople and produced a series of works about the Greek resistance to the Turks, during the Great Cretan Revolution. In 1868, Aivazovsky traveled in the Caucasus and visited the Russian part of Armenia for the first time. He painted several mountainous landscapes and in 1869 held an exhibition in Tiflis. Later in the year, he made a trip to Egypt and took part in the opening ceremony of the Suez Canal. He became the &quot;first artist to paint the Suez Canal, thus marking an epoch-making event in the history of Europe, Africa and Asia.&quot;

In 1870, Aivazovsky was made an Actual Civil Councilor, the fourth highest civil rank in Russia. In 1871, he initiated the construction of the archaeological museum in Feodosia. In 1872, he traveled to Nice and Florence to exhibit his paintings. In 1874, the Accademia di Belle Arti di Firenze (Florence Academy of Fine Art) asked him for a self-portrait to be hung in the Uffizi Gallery. The same year, Aivazovsky was invited to Constantinople by Sultan Abdülaziz who subsequently bestowed upon him the Turkish Order of Osmanieh. In 1876, he was made a member of the Academy of Arts in Florence and became the second Russian artist (after Orest Kiprensky) to paint a self-portrait for the Palazzo Pitti.

Aivazovsky was elected an honorary member of Stuttgart&#x27;s Royal Academy of Fine Arts in 1878. He made a trip to the Netherlands and France, staying briefly in Frankfurt until 1879. He then visited Munich and traveled to Genoa and Venice &quot;to collect material on the discovery of America by Christopher Columbus.&quot;

In 1880, Aivazovsky opened an art gallery in his Feodosia house; it became the third museum in the Russian Empire, after the Hermitage Museum and the Tretyakov Gallery. Aivazovsky held an 1881 exhibition at London&#x27;s Pall Mall, attended by English painter John Everett Millais and Edward VII, Prince of Wales.

===Second marriage and later life===
Aivazovsky&#x27;s second wife, Anna Burnazian, was a young Armenian widow 40 years his junior. Aivazovsky said that by marrying her in 1882, he &quot;became closer to [his] nation&quot;, referring to the Armenian people. In 1882, Aivazovsky visited Moscow and St Petersburg and then toured the countryside of Russia by traveling along the Volga River in 1884.

In 1885, he was promoted to the rank of Privy Councilor. The next year, the 50th anniversary of his creative labors, was celebrated with an exhibition in St Petersburg, and an honorary membership in the Imperial Academy of Fine Arts.

In 1887, as part of a jubilee celebration of his career, Aivazovsky hosted a dinner for 150 friends. Each guest received a miniature painting by Aivazovsky set into a studio photograph of the artist at work.

After meeting Aivazovsky in person, Anton Chekhov wrote a letter to his wife on 22 July 1888 describing him as follows:

After traveling to Paris with his wife, in October 1892 he made a trip to the United States, visiting Niagara Falls in New York and Washington D.C. During this trip, he performed an act of diplomacy by donating to the Corcoran Museum two of his paintings, which he had painted in &quot;Russia, Crimea, Feodosia&quot;, &quot;Relief Ship&quot; () and &quot;Food Distribution&quot; () which commemorated the arrival of American aid to Russia during the Tsar&#x27;s famine of 1891-1892 but the Tsar barred these paintings in Russia because of their anti-monarchist unpatriotic themes. In 1896, at 79, Aivazovsky was promoted to the rank of full privy councillor.

Aivazovsky was deeply affected by the Hamidian massacres that took place in the Armenian-inhabited areas of the Ottoman Empire between 1894 and 1896. He painted a number of works on the subject such as &quot;The Expulsion of the Turkish Ship&quot;, and &quot;The Armenian Massacres at Trebizond&quot; (1895). He threw the medals given to him by the Ottoman Sultan into the sea and told the Turkish consul in Feodosia: &quot;Tell your bloodthirsty master that I&#x27;ve thrown away all the medals given to me, here are their ribbons, send it to him and if he wants, he can throw them into the seas painted by me.&quot; He created several other paintings capturing the events, such as &quot;Lonely Ship&quot; and &quot;Night. Tragedy in the Sea of Marmara&quot; (1897).

He spent his final years in Feodosia. In the 1890s, thanks to his efforts a commercial port (ru) was established in Feodosia and linked to the railway network of the Russian Empire. The railway station, opened in 1892, is now called and is one of the two stations within the city of Feodosia. Aivazovsky also supplied Feodosia with drinking water.

===Death===
Aivazovsky died on 19 April (2 May in New Style) 1900 in Feodosia. In accordance with his wishes, he was buried at the courtyard of St. Sargis Armenian Church. A white marble sarcophagus was made by Italian sculptor L. Biogiolli in 1901. A quote from Movses Khorenatsi&#x27;s &quot;History of Armenia&quot; in Classical Armenian is engraved on his tombstone: (), which translates: &quot;He was born a mortal, left an immortal legacy&quot; or &quot;Born as a mortal, left the immortal memory of himself&quot;. The inscription beneath reads: &quot;Professor Ivan Konstantinovich Aivazovsky 1817–1900&quot; ().

After his death, his wife Anna led a generally secluded life, living in several rooms she had retained after nationalization, until 1941. She died on 25 July 1944 and was buried next to Aivazovsky. Two of his daughters (Maria and Alexandra) left Russia following the Revolution of 1917, while the other two died shortly thereafter: Yelena in 1918 and Zhanna in 1922.

==Art==
During his 60-year career, Aivazovsky produced around 6,000 paintings of, what one online art magazine describes, &quot;very different value ... there are masterpieces and there are very timid works&quot;. However, according to one count as many as 20,000 paintings are attributed to him. The vast majority of Aivazovsky&#x27;s works depict the sea. He rarely drew dry-landscapes and created only a handful of portraits. According to Rosa Newmarch Aivazovsky &quot;never painted his pictures from nature, always from memory, and far away from the seaboard.&quot; Rogachevsky wrote that &quot;His artistic memory was legendary. He was able to reproduce what he had seen only for a very short time, without even drawing preliminary sketches.&quot; Bolton praised &quot;his ability to convey the effect of moving water and of reflected sun and moonlight.&quot;

===Exhibitions===
He held 55 solo exhibitions (an unprecedented number) over the course of his career. Among the most notable were held in Rome, Naples and Venice (1841–42), Paris (1843, 1890), Amsterdam (1844), Moscow (1848, 1851, 1886), Sevastopol (1854), Tiflis (1868), Florence (1874), St. Petersburg (1875, 1877, 1886, 1891), Frankfurt (1879), Stuttgart (1879), London (1881), Berlin (1885, 1890), Warsaw (1885), Constantinople (1888), New York (1893), Chicago (1893), San Francisco (1893).

He also &quot;contributed to the exhibitions of the Imperial Academy of Arts (1836–1900), Paris Salon (1843, 1879), Society of Exhibitions of Works of Art (1876–83), Moscow Society of Lovers of the Arts (1880), Pan-Russian Exhibitions in Moscow (1882) and Nizhny Novgorod (1896), World Exhibitions in Paris (1855, 1867, 1878), London (1863), Munich (1879) and Chicago (1893) and the international exhibitions in Philadelphia (1876), Munich (1879) and Berlin (1896).&quot;

===Style===
Souren Melikian described his style as &quot;highly academic.&quot; A primarily Romantic painter, Aivazovsky used some Realistic elements. Leek argued that Aivazovsky remained faithful to Romanticism throughout his life, &quot;even though he oriented his work toward the Realist genre.&quot; His early works are influenced by his Academy of Arts teachers Maxim Vorobiev and Sylvester Shchedrin. Classic painters like Salvator Rosa, Jacob Isaacksz van Ruisdael and Claude Lorrain contributed to Aivazovsky&#x27;s individual process and style. Karl Bryullov, best known for his &quot;The Last Day of Pompeii&quot;, &quot;played an important part in stimulating Aivazovsky&#x27;s own creative development,&quot; according to Bolton. Aivazovsky&#x27;s best paintings in the 1840s–1850s used a variety of colors and were both epic and romantic in theme. Newmarch suggested that by the mid-19th century the romantic features in Aivazovsky&#x27;s work became &quot;increasingly pronounced.&quot; She, like most scholars, considered his &quot;Ninth Wave&quot; his best piece of art and argued that it &quot;seems to mark the transition between fantastic color of his earlier works, and the more truthful vision of the later years.&quot; By the 1870s, his paintings were dominated by delicate colors; and in the last two decades of his life, Aivazovsky created a series of silver-toned seascapes.

The distinct transition in Russian art from Romanticism to Realism in the mid-nineteenth century left Aivazovsky, who would always retain a Romantic style, open to criticism. Proposed reasons for his unwillingness or inability to change began with his location; Feodosia was a remote town in the huge Russian empire, far from Moscow and Saint Petersburg. His mindset and worldview were similarly considered old-fashioned and did not correspond to the developments in Russian art and culture. Vladimir Stasov only accepted his early works, while Alexandre Benois wrote in his &quot;The History of Russian Painting in the 19th Century&quot; that despite being Vorobiev&#x27;s student, Aivazovsky stood apart from the general development of the Russian landscape school.

Aivazovsky&#x27;s later work contained dramatic scenes and was usually done on a larger scale. He depicted &quot;the romantic struggle between man and the elements in the form of the sea (&quot;The Rainbow&quot;, 1873), and so-called &quot;blue marines&quot; (&quot;The Bay of Naples in Early Morning&quot;, 1897, &quot;Disaster&quot;, 1898) and urban landscapes (&quot;Moonlit Night on the Bosphorus&quot;, 1894).&quot;

===Works===

====Landscapes====
====Seascapes====
====Religious paintings====
====Orientalist themes====
====Armenian themes====
Aivazovsky&#x27;s early works incorporated Armenian themes. The artist&#x27;s longstanding wish to visit his ancestral homeland was fulfilled in 1868. During his visit to Russian (Eastern) Armenia (roughly corresponding to the modern Armenia, as opposed to Western Armenia under Ottoman rule), Aivazovsky created paintings of Mount Ararat, the Ararat plain, and Lake Sevan. Although Mt. Ararat has been depicted in paintings of many non-native artists (mostly European travelers), Aivazovsky became the first Armenian artist to illustrate the two-peaked biblical mountain.

He resumed the creation of Armenian-related paintings in the 1880s: &quot;Valley of Mount Ararat&quot; (1882), &quot;Ararat&quot; (1887), &quot;Descent of Noah from Ararat&quot; (1889). &quot;Valley of Mount Ararat&quot; contains his signature in Armenian: &quot;Aivazian&quot; (). In a panorama of Venice expressed by &quot;Byron&#x27;s Visit to the Mekhitarists on St Lazarus Island in Venice&quot; (1898); the foreground of the picture contains members of the Armenian Congregation of San Lazzaro degli Armeni giving an enthusiastic welcome to Lord Byron. His other themed works from this period include rare portraits of notable Armenians, such as his brother Archbishop Gabriel Aivazovsky (1882), Count Mikhail Loris-Melikov (1888), Catholicos Mkrtich Khrimian (1895), Nakhichevan-on-Don Mayor Аrutyun Khalabyan and others. &quot;The Baptism of Armenians&quot; and &quot;Oath Before the Battle of Avarayr&quot; (both 1892) depict the two memorable events of ancient Armenia: the Christianization via baptism of King Tiridates III by Gregory the Illuminator (early 4th century) and the Battle of Avarayr of 451, respectively.

==Aivazovsky and archaeology==
Aivazovsky took an interest in archaeology since the 1850s. He employed farmers to conduct archaeological excavations in the Feodosia area. In 1853 some 22 burial mounds were excavated on Mount Tepe-Oba, which mostly contained broken amphorae and bones, but also golden necklaces, earrings, a female head, a chain with a sphinx, a sphinx with woman&#x27;s head, the head of an ox, slabs; silver bracelets; clay statuettes, medallions, various vessels, a sarcophagus; silver and bronze coins. The site has been dated to the 5th to 3rd centuries BC when there was an ancient Greek settlement of Theodosia. The best finds were sent by Aivazovsky to the Imperial Hermitage in Petersburg. In 1871 he founded the construction of a new Museum of Antiquities on Mount Mitridat modeled after a typical Ancient Greek temple of the Doric order. It was destroyed during World War II.

==Aivazovsky&#x27;s estates==
Aivazovsky was a major landowner with numerous estates in eastern Crimea, mostly in the vicinity of Feodosia. These estates delivered him significant income; more than the sale of his paintings. His earliest major estate, bestowed by the Emperor in 1848 along with a personal noble title, was the one at Shakh-Mamai (now called ). Located some from Feodosia, it initially covered an area of 2,500 diasiatins (around ). The estate had an Eastern-style house, and one of its most prominent visitors, Anton Chekhov, wrote that &quot;It is an extravagant, fairy-tale estate of the kind you must probably find in Persia.&quot; By the end of his life, the estate had grown to include some 6,000 diasiatins of land, a dairy farm, and a steam-powered mill.

The second major estate, located in Subash (now Zolotoy Klyuch), contained some 2,500 diasiatins of land. The site contained several natural springs, which Aivazovsky acquired in 1852 from the Lansky family. The latter also sold Aivazovsky 2,362 diasiatins of land. Later, Aivazovsky supplied Feodosia with water from Subash. In both estates, vegetables were grown. He had small estates in Romash-Eli (now Romanovka), with 338 diasiatins of land covered with orchards, and the Sudak Valley, with 12 diasiatins of vineyard, along with a dacha (summer house).

In Feodosia, Aivazovsky possessed a house and a vineyard. He also owned houses elsewhere in Crimea, such as Stary Krym and Yalta. The estates inherited by his heirs were lost in the early Soviet period when they were nationalized.

==Influence==
Aivazovsky was the most influential seascape painter in nineteenth-century Russian art. According to the Russian Museum, &quot;he was the first and for a long time the only representative of seascape painting&quot; and &quot;all other artists who painted seascapes were either his own students or influenced by him.&quot;

Arkhip Kuindzhi (1842–1910) is sometimes cited as having been influenced by Aivazovsky. In 1855, at age 13–14, Kuindzhi visited Feodosia to study with Aivazovsky, however, he was engaged merely to mix paints and instead studied with Adolf Fessler, Aivazovsky&#x27;s student. A 1903 encyclopedic article stated: &quot;Although Kuindzhi cannot be called a student of Aivazovsky, the latter had without doubt some influence on him in the first period of his activity; from whom he borrowed much in the manner of painting.&quot; English art historian John E. Bowlt wrote that &quot;the elemental sense of light and form associated with Aivazovsky&#x27;s sunsets, storms, and surging oceans permanently influenced the young Kuindzhi.&quot;

Vartan Makhokhian, an Trabzon-born Armenian painter, who was later based in France, met Aivazovsky in Crimea in 1894. The latter had a major influence on his work. Aivazovsky also influenced Russian painters Lev Lagorio, , and (the latter two were his grandsons).

==Recognition==
Aivazovsky was one of the few Russian artists to achieve wide recognition during his lifetime, and gain recognition outside Russia. In 1898, &quot;Munsey&#x27;s Magazine&quot; wrote that Aivazovsky is &quot;better known to the world at large than any other artist of his nationality, with the exception of the sensational Verestchagin&quot;. However, Aivazovsky has not been incorporated into the mainstream Western history of art, and he remains relatively unknown in the West. Nevertheless, he is considered one of the most prominent marine artists of the 19th century, and, overall, one of the finest masters of seascape.

===Russia===
In 1890 the &quot;Brockhaus and Efron Encyclopedic Dictionary&quot; described him as the &quot;best Russian marine painter&quot;. He was praised by contemporary artists Ivan Kramskoi, Alexandre Benois, and the novelist Fyodor Dostoyevsky. In nineteenth-century Russia, his name became a synonym for art and beauty. The phrase &quot;worthy of Aivazovsky&#x27;s brush&quot; was the standard way of describing something ineffably lovely. It was first used by Anton Chekhov in his 1897 play &quot;Uncle Vanya&quot;.

A street in Moscow was named after Aivazovsky in 1978. His first Aivazovsky statue in Russia was erected in 2007 in Kronstadt, near Saint Petersburg. The Simferopol International Airport in Crimea, after Russian annexation, was voted to be named after Aivazovsky in 2018. It was officially renamed according to a decree signed by President Vladimir Putin on 31 May 2019, and ceremonially renamed on Russia Day (12 June). A bust of Aivazovsky was erected in front of the airport in 2020.

In a 2017 VTsIOM poll, Aivazovsky ranked first as the most favorite artist of Russians, with 27% of respondents naming him as their favorite, ahead of Ivan Shishkin (26%) and Ilya Repin (16%). Overall, 93% of respondents said they were familiar with his name (26% knew him well, 67% have heard his name) and 63% of those who know him said they liked his works, including 80% of those 60 or older and 35% of 18 to 24 year olds.

===Armenia===
In Armenia, Aivazovsky has been considered an Armenian painter, and exclusively referred to by his Armenian name, Hovhannes. He has been described as the &quot;most remarkable&quot; Armenian painter of the 19th century and the first-ever Armenian marine painter. He signed some of his paintings and letters in Armenian.

He was born outside Armenia, and like his contemporary Armenian painters, Aivazovsky drew primary influences from European and Russian schools of art. According to Sureniants, he sought to create a union which would have brought together all Armenian artists around the world. The prominent Armenian poet Hovhannes Tumanyan wrote a short poem titled &quot;In Front of an Aiazovsky painting&quot; in 1893, inspired by a seascape. It was translated into English in 1917 by Alice Stone Blackwell.

As early as 1876, a sea painting by Aivazovsky was hanging at the residence of the Catholicos at the monastery of Etchmiadzin, the center of the Armenian Church. The National Gallery of Armenia in Yerevan holds around 100 works of Aivazovsky, including 65 paintings. Several paintings from the National Gallery now hang in the Presidential Palace in Yerevan.

A statue of Aivazovsky was inaugurated in central Yerevan in 2003 and a bust was erected in Stepanakert, the capital of Nagorno-Karabakh, in December 2021. Aivazovsky is depicted on the 20,000 Armenian dram banknotes issued in 2018.

===Turkey===
Aivazovsky&#x27;s paintings were popular in 19th century Ottoman court. According to &quot;Hürriyet Daily News&quot;, 30 paintings of Aivazovsky are on display in Turkish museums as of 2014. According to , an organizer of an Aivazovsky exhibition in Istanbul, there are 60 Aivazovsky paintings in Turkey, including 41 in Turkish public institutions: 21 in former Ottoman palaces, 10 in various marine and military museums, 10 at the presidential residence, and 10 in private collections in Istanbul. In 2007, when Abdullah Gül became president of Turkey, he brought paintings by Aivazovsky up from the basement to hang in his office during redecoration of the presidential palace, the Çankaya Mansion in Ankara. Pictures of official meetings of Recep Tayyip Erdoğan at the new Presidential Complex in Ankara show that the walls of the rooms at the presidential residence are decorated with Aivazovsky&#x27;s artwork.

===Ukraine===
In Ukraine, Aivazovsky is sometimes considered a Ukrainian painter. He painted numerous Ukrainian landscapes, including of the Dnieper, the Ukrainian steppe, Odesa. An alley in Kyiv (&quot;&quot;) was named after him in 1939 and a statue of Aivazovsky and his brother Gabriel was erected in Simferopol, Crimea in 1999.

Works by Aivazovsky, among others, are presumed to have been destroyed in an airstrike attack on the Kuindzhi Art Museum in Mariupol during the Russian invasion of Ukraine in March 2022. According to Ukrainian authorities, Russian forces looted a number of original works by Aivazovsky from Mariupol museums to Russian-controlled Donetsk. Paintings by Aivazovsky were also taken from Kherson before Russian forces were forced out of the city in late 2022. The painting &quot;The Storm Subsides&quot; from the 1870s was among works taken from the Kherson Art Museum to the in Russian-controlled Simferopol, Crimea.

==Dispute over identity==
In June 2017 Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko claimed that Aivazovsky is &quot;part of Ukrainian heritage&quot;, which prompted Russian media to accuse him of cultural appropriation.

As part of derussification in Ukraine in the wake of the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, Aivazovsky streets were renamed in several Ukrainian cities, including Lviv and Rivne, while Sumy chose to keep his name.

In February 2023, the Metropolitan Museum of Art was reported to have classified Aivazovsky, along with Arkhip Kuindzhi and Ilya Repin, as Ukrainian artists. It was welcomed by Ukraine&#x27;s Culture Minister Oleksandr Tkachenko and the &quot;Kyiv Post&quot;, with both describing it as decolonization of Ukrainian art. It prompted wide criticism in Russia, both by the government and art specialists. Andrey Kovalchuk, chairman of the , called it &quot;political insinuation and provocation.&quot; The head of Russian-annexed Crimea, Sergey Aksyonov accused Kyiv and its &quot;Western patrons&quot; of &quot;theft.&quot; He said if Aivazovsky lived today, he would be declared a Kremlin agent and be cancelled in the West. The Russian satirical website &quot;Panorama&quot; joked about Lviv returning the name of the derussified Aivazvosky Street.

Tatyana Gaiduk, director of the Aivazovsky National Art Gallery in Feodosia, argued that Aivazovsky was an Armenian and the &quot;bearer of Armenian and Russian culture. Armenian traditions reigned in the house, in everyday life, but for everyone Aivazovsky is a representative of the large Russian world. All over the world he became known as a Russian artist, one of those who glorified Russian art. He was very patriotic, in his paintings he sang all the outstanding victories of the Russian navy.&quot; She also noted that the Ukrainian poet Taras Shevchenko, a classmate of Aivazovsky at the Peteresburg Academy of Arts, did not consider him a compatriot. Armenian-born Russian activist Arshak Makichyan criticized the Met&#x27;s move, saying &quot;Western decolonization is colonization.&quot; Vartan Matiossian called it &quot;misplaced decolonization efforts&quot; and argued for listing Aivazovsky as Armenian first. In early March 2023, the Metropolitan Museum of Art changed Aivazovsky&#x27;s label to &quot;Armenian, born Russian Empire [now Ukraine].&quot;

==Legacy==

Aivazovsky&#x27;s house in Feodosia, where he had founded an art museum in 1880, is open to this day as the Aivazovsky National Art Gallery. It remains a central attraction in the city and holds the world&#x27;s largest collections (417) of Aivazovsky paintings. A statue of the artist, by Ilya Ginzburg, was erected in front of the museum in 1930.

===Posthumous honors===
The Soviet Union (1950), Romania (1971), Armenia (first in 1992), Russia (first in 1995), Ukraine (1999), and other countries have issued postage stamps depicting Aivazovsky or his works. The minor planet 3787 Aivazovskij, named after Aivazovsky, was discovered by Soviet astronomer Nikolai Chernykh in 1977.

In 2016 and 2017 the 200th anniversary of Aivazovsky was celebrated with major exhibitions in Russia, Ukraine, and Armenia. An exhibition featuring 120 paintings and 55 etchings of Aivazovsky was held at the Tretyakov Gallery on Krymsky Val in Moscow from 29 July to 20 November 2016 dedicated to his 200th anniversary of birth. In the first 2 weeks, the exhibition had around 55,000 visitors, a record number. 38 of the works were moved from the Aivazovsky National Art Gallery in Feodosia, which was annexed by Russia in 2014, prompting Ukraine to call for an international boycott of the Tretyakov Gallery. Exhibitions were also held at the National Art Museum of Ukraine in Kiev, and the National Gallery of Armenia in Yerevan.

===Auctions===
Aivazovsky&#x27;s paintings began appearing in auctions (mostly in London) in the early 2000s. Many of his works are being bought by Russian oligarchs. His works have risen steadily in auction value. In 2004, his &quot;Saint Isaac&#x27;s Cathedral On A Frosty Day&quot;, a rare cityscape, sold for around £1 million ($2.1 million). In 2006 &quot;The Varangians on the Dnieper&quot; sold for $3.2 million at Sotheby&#x27;s. In 2007 his painting &quot;American Shipping off the Rock of Gibraltar&quot; auctioned at £2.71 million, &quot;more than four times its top estimate&quot;. In April 2012, his 1856 work &quot;View of Constantinople and the Bosphorus&quot; was sold at Sotheby&#x27;s for a record $5.2 million (£3.2 million), a tenfold increase since it was last at an auction in 1995. In 2020 his 1878 painting &quot;The Bay of Naples&quot; sold for $2.8 million, a record for a painting at an online-only auction.

===Stolen paintings===
In January 2011 a number of paintings, including those of Aivazovsky, were stolen from the country house of Aleksandr Tarantsev, an owner of a chain of jewelry stores in Russia, outside Moscow. In 2017 it was reported that a fake of one of the paintings stolen from Tarantsev&#x27;s house was presented to Armenian president Serzh Sargsyan by the Pyunik foundation.

In February 2011 an 1875 Aivazovsky painting &quot;A Storm on Rocky Shores&quot; was discovered at a Moscow auction after having been stolen from Armenia in 1990. It was returned to Armenia&#x27;s National Gallery by the Armenian-born Russian Senator (Hovhannes Ohanyan), its last owner.

In June 2015 Sotheby&#x27;s withdrew from auction an 1870 Aivazovsky painting &quot;Evening in Cairo&quot;, which was estimated at £1.5–2 million ($2–$3 million), after the Russian Interior Ministry claimed that it was stolen in 1997 from a private collection in Moscow. In 2017 &quot;View on Revel&quot; (1845), stolen from the in 1976, was found at Koller auction house in Zürich, Switzerland.

<text>Compared to other European nations, the French are not avid newspaper readers, citing only 164 adults out of every 1000 as newspaper readers.

The French press was healthiest in the aftermath of World War II. A year after the end of the war, 28 papers had a combined circulation of about 7 million. However, seven years later that figure had been nearly halved. This decline was principally due to the greater popularity of the broadcast media and the subsequent diversion of advertising revenues. Since 2000 newly produced free papers have further weakened the established press. Still, 80 daily papers remain, and there is a wide range of weeklies, many of which now feature internet sites.

Regional papers have remained relatively unaffected by the decline, with provincial newspapers commanding a higher degree of reader loyalty. For example, &quot;Ouest-France&quot;, sells almost twice as many copies as any of the national dailies.

==Newspapers==

In the early 21st century, the best-selling daily was the regional &quot;Ouest-France&quot; in 47 local editions, followed by &quot;Le Progres&quot; of Lyon, &quot;La Voix du Nord&quot; in Lille, and &quot;Provençal&quot; in Marseille. In Paris the Communists published &quot;l&#x27;Humanite&quot; while &quot;Le Monde&quot; and &quot;Figaro&quot; had local rivals in &quot;Le Parisien&quot;, &quot;L&#x27;Aurore&quot; and the leftist &quot;Libération.&quot;

<doc id="763484" wikidata="Q5303591" url="?curid=763484" title="Downtown Syracuse">
<text>Downtown Syracuse is the economic center of Syracuse, New York, and Central New York, employing over 30,000 people, and housing over 4,300. 

 It is also one of the 26 officially recognized neighborhoods of Syracuse.
== History ==

Downtown Syracuse, as the rest of the city, grew as a result of the city&#x27;s salt industry and its location on the Erie Canal.

For over a century, it was also the retail and entertainment center of Central New York, with large department stores such as Chappell&#x27;s, The Addis Co., Flah&#x27;s, E.W. Edwards, Woolworth&#x27;s, Grant&#x27;s, Lincoln Stores, The Mohican, David&#x27;s, Kresge&#x27;s, Clark Music Co., Dey Brothers, and Sibley&#x27;s. This attribute began to fade with development of large suburban malls, with the final blow in 1992 when the combined Addis &amp; Dey&#x27;s department store became the last major store to leave downtown.

===South Salina Street===
South Salina Street between Erie Boulevard and West Onondaga Street was the main north-south artery of Downtown Syracuse and was among the busiest streets in the city. The area has seen a great deal of revitalization in recent years with projects such as the conversion of the historic Syracuse Trust Building into luxury condos, a project engineered by local developer Peter Muserlian. More development projects are planned.

===Cobblestone streets===
In 1835, the &quot;nature of the soil and the flat surface of the ground&quot; in the village rendered the construction of stone pavements necessary. An ordinance was passed authorizing the paving with cobblestone of Salina Street from Fayette to Church Streets and Genesee Street from the west line of Clinton Square to &quot;Hanover Square&quot;. Additionally, sections of Water, Warren and Franklin Streets were paved.

The paving of these streets also made it necessary to pave the public squares, or the work would be &quot;incomplete.&quot; A sum of $4,500 was raised with general tax. During the same year, sidewalks of brick were ordered to be constructed along all paved streets and squares where they had not already been laid including Salina Street from Washington Street to Onondaga Avenue.

===Armory Square===
&quot;Armory Square&quot; is a small neighborhood on the west side of Downtown Syracuse. It began life as a busy commercial and industrial area just to the west of the central city. Named after the historic armory building that still inhabits the district&#x27;s center, Armory Square is now home to luxury condos, restaurants, cafes, and high-end office space.

===Forman Park===
&quot;Forman Park&quot; was first established on June 16, 1839, and was known as &quot;Forman Square&quot;. The main attraction is a bronze memorial of early civic leaders Joshua Forman and Lewis H. Redfield. The park is 1.3 acres and is located at East Genesee and Almond Streets.

===Clinton Square===

&quot;Clinton Square&quot; first came into existence in the early 19th century when roadways from north and south joined in downtown Syracuse. By the mid-19th century, the construction of Erie Canal further transformed the busy intersection into the center of commerce and trade in Central New York.

===Hanover Square===
&quot;Hanover Square&quot; is actually a triangle at the intersection of Warren, Water, and East Genesee Streets. The name may also refer to the larger &quot;Hanover Square Historic District&quot;, which includes seventeen historic buildings in the area that was the first commercial district in Syracuse.

The public square was originally named &quot;Veteran&#x27;s Park&quot;. It was renamed to Hanover Square after the &quot;Soldiers&#x27; and Sailors&#x27; Monument&quot; in Clinton Square was dedicated in 1910 and the function of commemorating Syracuse&#x27;s war dead was shifted there. The larger Clinton Square had already developed as the city&#x27;s center to the west, but following the completion of the Erie Canal in 1825, commercial and retail activity spread along Genesee Street to Hanover Square.

===Landmark Theatre===

Downtown Syracuse also boasts the Landmark Theatre originally known as Loew&#x27;s State Theatre, where visitors and locals can view Broadway shows, performances by comedians, and musical performers. The theatre began construction in 1927 on March 15 and was completed after 11 months of construction. The first opening show aired February 18, 1928.

In 1933 Loew&#x27;s made its first public demonstration of the television and in 1934, the theatre then began introducing double feature in 1934.

After World War II, the theatre&#x27;s patronage decreased drastically. The theatre fell into disrepair and in 1975 was officially closed. In the following year of 1976, the US department listed the theatre in the National Register of Historic Places.

In 1979, the title for the theatre was given to SALT (Syracuse Area Landmark Theatre) and a major volunteer effort began to restore the theatre. These efforts were supported by The National Endowment of the Arts and the State Office of Parks and Recreation, which provided grants to help the restoration continue.

The theatre now boasts having prominent performers, such as Jerry Seinfeld and Celtic Women, bringing their acts to Syracuse and often features many popular Broadway shows.

=== Community profile ===
Today, downtown Syracuse is an economic center, with many insurance companies, banks, and law firms having a large presence there.

Since the late 1980s, downtown Syracuse has also increasingly become a nightlife center, with many bars, clubs, restaurants, and pubs located in the &quot;Armory Square&quot; area.

Most of Syracuse&#x27;s cultural festivals, such as Oktoberfest and Festa Italiana, also take place downtown.

The &quot;Downtown Committee of Syracuse&quot; has made a great deal of effort to revitalize the area. Most sidewalks and streetlights have been restored since 1995, with maps and other information posted on many street corners.

All of downtown is lively on weekdays, but on nights and weekends most activity centers around the &quot;Armory Square&quot;, &quot;Hanover Square&quot;, and &quot;Clinton Square&quot; areas. With the reopening of the historic &quot;Marriott Syracuse Downtown&quot; in 2016, there are currently three hotels downtown.

===National Register of Historic Places===
The following are listed on the National Register of Historic Places and located in Downtown Syracuse: Amos Block, Armory Square Historic District, Central New York Telephone and Telegraph Building, Central Technical High School, Gere Bank Building, Gridley Building, Hanover Square Historic District, Hotel Syracuse, Loew&#x27;s State Theater, Montgomery Street-Columbus Circle Historic District, New York Central Railroad Passenger and Freight Station, Niagara Hudson Building, Onondaga County War Memorial, Plymouth Congregational Church, St. Paul&#x27;s Cathedral and Parish House, C.W. Snow and Company Warehouse, South Salina Street Downtown Historic District, Syracuse City Hall, Syracuse Savings Bank, Third National Bank, Weighlock Building, White Memorial Building, and Hamilton White House.

== Recent years ==
In December 2005, Syracuse University announced it had purchased eleven buildings downtown, and leased another. Hundreds of faculty, staff, and students began using the buildings in the spring of 2006. Former Syracuse University chancellor Nancy Cantor&#x27;s motto for the venture was &quot;Exploring the Soul of Syracuse.&quot; At the same time, the university and the city were working on a project called the &quot;Connective Corridor&quot;, a special path from the university area to Armory Square.

<text>In structural geology, a fold is a stack of originally planar surfaces, such as sedimentary strata, that are bent or curved (&quot;folded&quot;) during permanent deformation. Folds in rocks vary in size from microscopic crinkles to mountain-sized folds. They occur as single isolated folds or in periodic sets (known as &quot;fold trains&quot;). folds are those formed during sedimentary deposition.

Folds form under varied conditions of stress, pore pressure, and temperature gradient, as evidenced by their presence in soft sediments, the full spectrum of metamorphic rocks, and even as primary flow structures in some igneous rocks. A set of folds distributed on a regional scale constitutes a fold belt, a common feature of orogenic zones. Folds are commonly formed by shortening of existing layers, but may also be formed as a result of displacement on a non-planar fault (&quot;fault bend fold&quot;), at the tip of a propagating fault (&quot;fault propagation fold&quot;), by differential compaction or due to the effects of a high-level igneous intrusion e.g. above a laccolith.

== Fold terminology ==

The &quot;fold hinge&quot; is the line joining points of maximum curvature on a folded surface. This line may be either straight or curved. The term &quot;hinge line&quot; has also been used for this feature.
A fold surface seen perpendicular to its shortening direction can be divided into &quot;hinge&quot; and &quot;limb&quot; portions; the limbs are the flanks of the fold, and the limbs converge at the hinge zone. Within the hinge zone lies the hinge point, which is the point of minimum radius of curvature (maximum curvature) of the fold. The crest of the fold represents the highest point of the fold surface whereas the trough is the lowest point. The inflection point of a fold is the point on a limb at which the reverses; on regular folds, this is the midpoint of the limb. 
The &quot;axial surface&quot; is defined as a plane connecting all the hinge lines of stacked folded surfaces. If the axial surface is planar, it is called an &quot;axial plane&quot; and can be described in terms of strike and dip.

Folds can have a &quot;fold axis&quot;. A fold axis &quot;is the closest approximation to a straight line that when moved parallel to itself, generates the form of the fold&quot;. (Ramsay 1967). A fold that can be generated by a fold axis is called a &quot;cylindrical fold&quot;. This term has been broadened to include near-cylindrical folds. Often, the fold axis is the same as the hinge line.

==Descriptive features==
=== Fold size ===
Minor folds are quite frequently seen in outcrop; major folds seldom are except in the more arid countries. Minor folds can, however, often provide the key to the major folds they are related to. They reflect the same shape and style, the direction in which the closures of the major folds lie, and their cleavage indicates the attitude of the axial planes of the major folds and their direction of overturning 

===Fold shape===

A fold can be shaped like a chevron, with planar limbs meeting at an angular axis, as &quot;cuspate&quot; with curved limbs, as circular with a curved axis, or as elliptical with unequal wavelength.

===Fold tightness===

Fold tightness is defined by the size of the angle between the fold&#x27;s limbs (as measured tangential to the folded surface at the inflection line of each limb), called the interlimb angle. Gentle folds have an interlimb angle of between 180° and 120°, open folds range from 120° to 70°, close folds from 70° to 30°, and tight folds from 30° to 0°. &quot;Isoclines&quot;, or &quot;isoclinal folds&quot;, have an interlimb angle of between 10° and zero, with essentially parallel limbs.

===Fold symmetry===
Not all folds are equal on both sides of the axis of the fold. Those with limbs of relatively equal length are termed symmetrical, and those with highly unequal limbs are asymmetrical. Asymmetrical folds generally have an axis at an angle to the original unfolded surface they formed on.

=== Facing and vergence ===

Vergence is calculated in a direction perpendicular to the fold axis.

===Deformation style classes===

Folds that maintain uniform layer thickness are classed as &quot;concentric&quot; folds. Those that do not are called &quot;similar folds&quot;. Similar folds tend to display thinning of the limbs and thickening of the hinge zone. Concentric folds are caused by warping from active buckling of the layers, whereas similar folds usually form by some form of shear flow where the layers are not mechanically active. Ramsay has proposed a classification scheme for folds that often is used to describe folds in profile based upon the curvature of the inner and outer lines of a fold and the behavior of &quot; dip isogons&quot;. that is, lines connecting points of equal dip on adjacent folded surfaces:

==Types of fold==


=== Linear ===
* Anticline: linear, strata normally dip away from the axial center, &quot;oldest&quot; strata in center irrespective of orientation.
* Syncline: linear, strata normally dip toward the axial center, &quot;youngest&quot; strata in center irrespective of orientation.
* Antiform: linear, strata dip away from the axial center, age unknown, or inverted.
* Synform: linear, strata dip toward the axial center, age unknown, or inverted.
*Monocline: linear, strata dip in one direction between horizontal layers on each side.
* Recumbent: linear, fold axial plane oriented at a low angle resulting in overturned strata in one limb of the fold.

=== Other ===
* Dome: nonlinear, strata dip away from center in all directions, &quot;oldest&quot; strata in center.
* Basin: nonlinear, strata dip toward center in all directions, &quot;youngest&quot; strata in center.
* Chevron: angular fold with straight limbs and small hinges
* Slump: typically monoclinal, the result of differential compaction or dissolution during sedimentation and lithification.
* Ptygmatic: Folds are chaotic, random and disconnected. Typical of sedimentary slump folding, migmatites and decollement detachment zones.
* Parasitic: short-wavelength folds formed within a larger wavelength fold structure - normally associated with differences in bed thickness
* Disharmonic: Folds in adjacent layers with different wavelengths and shapes
(A homocline involves strata dipping in the same direction, though not necessarily any folding.)

==Causes of folding==
Folds appear on all scales, in all rock types, at all levels in the crust. They arise from a variety of causes.

===Layer-parallel shortening===

When a sequence of layered rocks is shortened parallel to its layering, this deformation may be accommodated in a number of ways, homogeneous shortening, reverse faulting or folding. The response depends on the thickness of the mechanical layering and the contrast in properties between the layers. If the layering does begin to fold, the fold style is also dependent on these properties. Isolated thick competent layers in a less competent matrix control the folding and typically generate classic rounded buckle folds accommodated by deformation in the matrix. In the case of regular alternations of layers of contrasting properties, such as sandstone-shale sequences, kink-bands, box-folds and chevron folds are normally produced.


===Fault-related folding===
Many folds are directly related to faults, associated with their propagation, displacement and the accommodation of strains between neighboring faults.

====Fault bend folding====
Fault-bend folds are caused by displacement along a non-planar fault. In non-vertical faults, the hanging-wall deforms to accommodate the mismatch across the fault as displacement progresses. Fault bend folds occur in both extensional and thrust faulting. In extension, listric faults form rollover anticlines in their hanging walls. In thrusting, &quot;ramp anticlines&quot; form whenever a thrust fault cuts up section from one detachment level to another. Displacement over this higher-angle ramp generates the folding.

====Fault propagation folding====
Fault propagation folds or &quot;tip-line folds&quot; are caused when displacement occurs on an existing fault without further propagation. In both reverse and normal faults this leads to folding of the overlying sequence, often in the form of a monocline.

====Detachment folding====
When a thrust fault continues to displace above a planar detachment without further fault propagation, detachment folds may form, typically of box-fold style. These generally occur above a good detachment such as in the Jura Mountains, where the detachment occurs on middle Triassic evaporites.

===Folding in shear zones===

Shear zones that approximate to simple shear typically contain minor asymmetric folds, with the direction of overturning consistent with the overall shear sense. Some of these folds have highly curved hinge-lines and are referred to as &quot;sheath folds&quot;. Folds in shear zones can be inherited, formed due to the orientation of pre-shearing layering or formed due to instability within the shear flow.

===Folding in sediments===
Recently deposited sediments are normally mechanically weak and prone to remobilization before they become lithified, leading to folding. To distinguish them from folds of tectonic origin, such structures are called synsedimentary (formed during sedimentation).

Slump folding:
When slumps form in poorly consolidated sediments, they commonly undergo folding, particularly at their leading edges, during their emplacement. The asymmetry of the slump folds can be used to determine paleoslope directions in sequences of sedimentary rocks.

Dewatering: 
Rapid dewatering of sandy sediments, possibly triggered by seismic activity, can cause convolute bedding.

Compaction: 
Folds can be generated in a younger sequence by differential compaction over older structures such as fault blocks and reefs.

===Igneous intrusion===
The emplacement of igneous intrusions tends to deform the surrounding country rock. In the case of high-level intrusions, near the Earth&#x27;s surface, this deformation is concentrated above the intrusion and often takes the form of folding, as with the upper surface of a laccolith.

===Flow folding===

The compliance of rock layers is referred to as &quot;competence&quot;: a competent layer or bed of rock can withstand an applied load without collapsing and is relatively strong, while an incompetent layer is relatively weak. When rock behaves as a fluid, as in the case of very weak rock such as rock salt, or any rock that is buried deeply enough, it typically shows &quot;flow folding&quot; (also called &quot;passive folding&quot;, because little resistance is offered): the strata appear shifted undistorted, assuming any shape impressed upon them by surrounding more rigid rocks. The strata simply serve as markers of the folding. Such folding is also a feature of many igneous intrusions and glacier ice.

==Folding mechanisms==
Folding of rocks must balance the deformation of layers with the conservation of volume in a rock mass. This occurs by several mechanisms.

===Flexural slip===
Flexural slip allows folding by creating layer-parallel slip between the layers of the folded strata, which, altogether, result in deformation. A good analogy is bending a phone book, where volume preservation is accommodated by slip between the pages of the book.

The fold formed by the compression of competent rock beds is called &quot;flexure fold&quot;.

===Buckling===
Typically, folding is thought to occur by simple buckling of a planar surface and its confining volume. The volume change is accommodated by &quot;layer parallel shortening&quot; the volume, which grows in &quot;thickness&quot;. Folding under this mechanism is typical of a similar fold style, as thinned limbs are shortened horizontally and thickened hinges do so vertically.

===Mass displacement===
If the folding deformation cannot be accommodated by a flexural slip or volume-change shortening (buckling), the rocks are generally removed from the path of the stress. This is achieved by pressure dissolution, a form of metamorphic process, in which rocks shorten by dissolving constituents in areas of high strain and redepositing them in areas of lower strain. Folds generated in this way include examples in migmatites and areas with a strong axial planar cleavage.

==Mechanics of folding==
Folds in the rock are formed about the stress field in which the rocks are located and the rheology, or method of response to stress, of the rock at the time at which the stress is applied.

The rheology of the layers being folded determines characteristic features of the folds that are measured in the field. Rocks that deform more easily form many short-wavelength, high-amplitude folds. Rocks that do not deform as easily form long-wavelength, low-amplitude folds.

== Economic implications ==

=== Mining industry ===

Layers of rock that fold into a hinge need to accommodate large deformations in the hinge zone. This results in voids between the layers. These voids, and especially the fact that the water pressure is lower in the voids than outside of them, act as triggers for the deposition of minerals. Over millions of years, this process is capable of gathering large quantities of trace minerals from large expanses of rock and depositing them at very concentrated sites. This may be a mechanism that is responsible for the veins.
To summarize, when searching for veins of valuable minerals, it might be wise to look for highly folded rock, and this is the reason why the mining industry is very interested in the theory of geological folding.

=== Oil industry ===
Anticlinal traps are formed by folding of rock. For example, if a porous sandstone unit covered with low permeability shale is folded into an anticline, it may form a hydrocarbons trap, oil accumulating in the crest of the fold. Most anticlinal traps are produced as a result of sideways pressure, folding the layers of rock, but can also occur from sediments being compacted.

<text>Martin van Butchell (1735–1814) was an eccentric British dentist who put his dead wife on display, reputedly because of a clause in a marriage contract.

==Career==

Butchell practised as a dental quack in the 1770s London and travelled around on a white pony, painted with purple spots.

He advertised in &quot;St. James&#x27;s Chronicle&quot; with a text: &quot;Real or Artificial Teeth from one to an entire set, with superlative gold pivots or springs, also gums, sockets and palate formed, fitted, finished and fixed without drawing stumps, or causing pain.&quot;

When his wife Mary died on 14 January 1775, he decided to have her embalmed and turn her into an attraction to draw more customers. He contacted his teacher of surgery and anatomy Dr. William Hunter and Dr. William Cruikshank who agreed to do the job.

Doctors injected the body with preservatives and color additives that gave a glow to the corpse&#x27;s cheeks, replaced her eyes with glass eyes and dressed her in a fine lace gown. The body was then embedded in a layer of plaster of Paris in a glass-topped coffin.

Butchell put the body on display in the window of his home, which also housed his practice, and always referred to her as &quot;my dearly departed&quot;. Many Londoners came to see the body but Butchell also drew criticism on his gruesome display. A rumour, possibly started by Butchell himself, claimed that a clause in their marriage certificate had provided income for Butchell as long as Mary was &quot;above ground&quot;.

Eventually Butchell remarried and the new wife, Elizabeth, demanded that he remove the body of her predecessor from his window. Butchell gave the body to a brother of Dr. Hunter for his museum. The body ended up in the Royal College of Surgeons&#x27; museum.

The embalming was not very effective; the body begun to slowly deteriorate. In May 1941, the body of Mary Butchell was finally destroyed in a German bombing raid.

<text>Marcus Harvey (born 1963 in Leeds) is an English artist and painter, one of the Young British Artists (YBAs).

==Exhibitions==
Harvey has shown work internationally in many exhibitions including &quot;The Führer&#x27;s Cakes&quot; at Galleria Marabini in Bologna, &quot;Snaps&quot; and &quot;White Riot&quot; at White Cube in London, &quot;Sex and the British&quot; at Galerie Thaddaeus Ropac in Salzburg, &quot;Crucible&quot; a sculpture exhibition held inside Gloucester Cathedral, and &quot;London Calling: Young British Artists Criss-Crossed&quot; at Galleri Kaare Berntsen in Oslo. He was included in the original &quot;Young British Artists&quot; exhibition series at Saatchi Gallery in 1995 and was in other important YBA shows like &quot;In the darkest hour there may be light&quot; at Serpentine Galleries.

==Collections==
Marcus has work in public collections including The Museum of Modern Art, New York; the Stedelijk Museum, Amsterdam; The British Council Collection, London; the Goss-Michael Foundation of Contemporary British Art, TX; and prominent lending private collections including the &quot;Murder Me&quot; collection of artist Damien Hirst, UK; the Saatchi Collection, UK; and the Logan Collection, San Francisco.

==Life and art==
Marcus Harvey grew up in Moortown, a suburb of Leeds. He attended Allerton Grange High School, graduated from Goldsmiths College in 1986, and is also an alumnus of the Leeds College of Art. At that time he became a close friend of Damien Hirst. Harvey did not take part in the &quot;Freeze&quot; show as he had graduated from Goldsmiths earlier, but Hirst included him when he curated &quot;Some Went Mad, Some Ran Away&quot; (1994). Harvey&#x27;s work attracted the attention of Charles Saatchi. He currently lives and works in London.

Beyond the studio, Marcus Harvey joined with fellow painter Peter Ashton Jones to form Turps Banana Magazine in 2005. Turps focuses on new writing about both art historical and contemporary painting, written entirely by contemporary practicing painters. The magazine is published twice a year with full colour reproductions and a commitment to no advertising. The cover design is in yellow, with the word &quot;TURPS&quot; and the iconic banana of Andy Warhol. In 2012, Turps Art School was founded to allow emerging and mid career painters to take a year painting intensive with other practicing painters, it has been heralded as an alternative model for arts education by Jonathan Jones for &quot;The Guardian&quot; in 2014 as &quot;The renegade art school proving that painting is not dead.&quot;

Harvey is known for his tabloid-provoking portrayal of Moors murderer Myra Hindley, created from handprints taken from a plaster cast of a child&#x27;s hand, and shown in the &quot;Sensation&quot; exhibition at the Royal Academy of Art in 1997. The painting had to be temporarily removed from display for repair after it was attacked in two separate incidents on the opening day, in which ink and eggs were thrown at it. &quot;The Times&quot; newspaper&#x27;s art critic, Richard Cork, wrote that:
Harvey&#x27;s current work combines painting, photography, and sculpture while exploring British iconography in pop culture, the landscape, and cultural history. These recent works include thick gestural figurative paintings made on top of and obscuring photographic prints of landscapes and figures. His new ceramics and bronzes are an amalgam of art historical and historical references making &quot;collaged portraits&quot; from Nelson to Margaret Thatcher and from Napoleon to Tony Blair. The work has been received as a more mature kind of politics in work that continues to explore the possibilities of gesture in medium specificity with his &quot;urgent physicality.&quot;

<doc id="763495" wikidata="Q446496" url="?curid=763495" title="Geneviève de Galard">
<text>Geneviève de Galard (13 April 1925 – 30 May 2024) was a French nurse who was dubbed &quot;l&#x27;ange de Dien Bien Phu&quot; (&quot;the Angel of Dien Bien Phu&quot;) during the French war in Indochina by the press in Hanoi, although in the camp she was known simply as Geneviève.

== Early life ==
Geneviève de Galard grew up in the southwest of France, a member of the noble De Galard family. The Second World War forced her family to move from Paris to Toulouse.

Galard passed the state exam to become a nurse and eventually became a flight nurse for the French Air Force. She was posted to French Indochina by her own request and arrived there in May 1953, in the middle of the war between French forces and the Viet Minh.

Serving as a &quot;convoyeuse&quot; or in-flight nurse, she was stationed in Hanoi and flew on casualty evacuation flights from Pleiku. After January 1954, she was on the flights that evacuated casualties from the Battle of Dien Bien Phu. Her first patients were mainly soldiers who suffered from diseases but after mid-March most of them were battle casualties. Sometimes, Red Cross planes had to land in the midst of Vietminh artillery barrages.

== Dien Bien Phu ==
Galard found herself stuck in Dien Bien Phu on 28 March 1954, when the C-47 on which she was the &quot;convoyeuse&quot; landed in fog and damaged an oil tank which prevented its taking off again. The mechanics could not repair the plane in the field, so the plane was stranded. At daylight Vietminh artillery destroyed the C-47 and damaged the runway beyond repair.

Volunteering to work in the field hospital, Galard was the only female nurse at Dien Bien Phu. Her special status earned her a small parachute silk-lined cell with a cot and chair for a bedroom. In a letter, her mother expressed gratitude for her safety, mentioning that there was no longer a risk of her plane crashing. At the hospital she served under Dr. Paul Grauwin. The men of the medical staff were initially apprehensive about her presence as she was not just the only female nurse on the base, but the sole French woman there, although there were two Bordels Mobiles de Campagne (Mobile Field Brothels) populated with Algerian and Vietnamese prostitutes. Her hard work and willingness to tackle even the most gruesome tasks eventually won them over and they made accommodations for her. They also arranged a semblance of a uniform: camouflage overalls, trousers, basketball shoes, and a T-shirt. Galard did her best in very unsanitary conditions, comforting those about to die and trying to keep up morale in the face of the mounting casualties. Many of the men later complimented her efforts. Eventually, she was placed in charge of a forty-bed room for housing some of the most gravely wounded.

=== Légion d´honneur ===
On 29 April 1954, Galard was awarded the &quot;Légion d´honneur&quot; (as a knight) and the &quot;Croix de Guerre TOE&quot; (Croix de guerre des théâtres d&#x27;opérations extérieurs (War Cross for foreign operational theaters)). It was presented to her by the commander of Dien Bien Phu, General de Castries. The following day, during the celebration of the French Foreign Legion&#x27;s annual &quot;Camerone&quot; Day, de Galard was made an honorary &quot;Légionnaire de 1ère classe&quot; alongside Lieutenant Colonel Marcel Bigeard, the commander of the 6th Colonial Parachute Battalion. After the induction ceremony she told her Foreign Legionnaire sponsor: &quot;If we ever get out of this alive, I&#x27;ll pay you a bottle of champagne no matter where we meet.&quot; In 1963 while driving with her husband in Paris she saw the Legionnaire, got out of her car, embraced him and made good on her promise.

French troops at Dien Bien Phu finally capitulated on 7 May. However, the Vietminh allowed Galard and the medical staff to continue to care for their wounded and she worked changing bandages despite short supplies. Galard still refused any kind of cooperation. When some of the Vietminh began to hoard medical supplies for their own use, she hid some of them under her stretcher bed.

=== Release ===
On 24 May, Galard was evacuated to French-held Hanoi, partially against her will. She was the first of the medical staff to leave and quickly became a media sensation, appearing on the cover of &quot;Paris Match&quot; that week.

As early as 19 May, when Galard was still in captivity, U.S. Congresswoman Frances P. Bolton urged United States Secretary of State John Foster Dulles to invite the French nurse to the United States. When she arrived in New York City in July, she was met at the plane by Mayor Robert Wagner and a large crowd. Congresswoman Bolton introduced her as a &quot;symbol of heroic femininity in the free world&quot; and a Ticker Tape parade down Broadway in her honor was attended by perhaps 250,000 spectators. She was then given a reception at city hall.

Having flown to Washington, D.C., on a U.S. Air Force plane, she was recognized before the House of Representatives. On 29 July 1954, President Dwight D. Eisenhower awarded her the Medal of Freedom during a ceremony in the White House Rose Garden, calling her the &quot;woman of the year&quot; She was then sent on a tour of six states where she met with luminaries and appeared before large crowds in cities such as Cleveland, Chicago, New Orleans, and San Francisco. The French ambassador to the United States called her visit &quot;an exceptional success&quot;.

== Later life and death ==
Galard lived in Paris with her husband, Colonel Jean de Heaulme de Boutsocq. She died on 30 May 2024, at the age of 99.

<doc id="763496" wikidata="Q11684399" url="?curid=763496" title="James Henry Pullen">
<text>James Henry Pullen (1835–1916), also known as the Genius of Earlswood Asylum, was a British savant, who possibly had aphasia.

==Childhood==

Pullen was born in Dalston, London in 1835, and grew up on the Balls Pond Road. Both he and his brother William were regarded as deaf, mute and were developmentally disabled. By the age of 7 Pullen had learned only one word, &quot;mother&quot;, which he pronounced as &quot;muvver&quot;. He could, however, lip read, understand gestures, and write intelligible blank verse. As a child, he began to carve small ships out of firewood and draw pictures of them. Pullen was first confined to Essex Hall, Colchester.

==Earlswood==
At the age of 15, in 1850, he was taken to the then new Earlswood Asylum (later called Royal Earlswood Hospital), in Reigate, Surrey. Contemporary account tells that Pullen could not give any answers through speech, but could communicate through gestures. He could read lips and gestures but never learned to read or write beyond one syllable. Pullen&#x27;s brother William later followed him to Earlswood; a good painter, he died at the age of 35.

Earlswood Asylum tried to teach its patients a number of handicrafts so they could support themselves and the asylum. Pullen continued his handicrafts and became a gifted carpenter and cabinet maker. He would work at workshop at days and draw at night. Most of the drawings were of the corridors of the asylum and he framed them himself. If Pullen could not find a suitable tool, he would make it himself. In addition he would also make practical items, such as bed frames, for the needs of the asylum.

Pullen was alternatively aggressive or sullen. He could be reserved but also wrecked his workshop once in a fit of anger. He did not like to accept advice and wanted always to get his own way. Once he took a dislike to a certain member of the staff and built a guillotine-like contraption over his door. Luckily for the target, it went off too late. Once, when Pullen developed an obsession to marry a townswoman he fancied, the staff mollified him by giving him an admiral&#x27;s uniform instead.

==Notability==

Queen Victoria accepted some of the drawings and Prince Albert received one Pullen had drawn of the Siege of Sebastapol in the Crimean War, based on newspaper accounts. He even attracted the interest of the Prince of Wales, future king Edward VII; Pullen referred to him as &quot;Friend Wales.&quot; Prince Edward sent him pieces of ivory so he could carve them. This intricate object, made from ebony and rare timbers, features two ivory angels on one side which appear in conflict with a brass tongued devil attempting to haul the boat back. The ivory came from tusks given to Pullen by his patron, Edward VII, who took great interest in him and his endeavours. Pullen also created models of fantasy craft including &quot;The State Barge&quot; designed as a floating office for Queen Victoria, with a desk and miniature documents visible through the circular windows. Sir Edwin Henry Landseer sent engravings of his paintings to Pullen and his brother Arthur so they could copy them.

Asylum superintendent John Langdon Down, after whom Down syndrome is named, gave Pullen a great deal of leeway. For example, he was allowed to eat his meals with the staff.

Pullen&#x27;s masterpiece is a model ship, a 10-foot long replica of SS &quot;Great Eastern&quot;, that he started in 1870 and spent seven years building; Pullen made all the details, including 5,585 rivets, 13 lifeboats and interior furniture in miniature, himself. In its maiden voyage the model ship sank for lack of buoyancy but Pullen repaired that flaw later. The model was exhibited in the Crystal Palace.

Pullen also built a large, mechanical mannequin in the middle of his workshop; he would sit inside it, manipulate its face and appendages and talk through a concealed bugle in its mouth.

==Legacy==

After Pullen&#x27;s death in 1916, his workshop became a museum of his work until the Royal Earlswood Hospital was closed in 1997. It is now an apartment complex. Pullen&#x27;s model of &quot;SS Great Eastern&quot; may be seen, being part of the James Henry Pullen Collection including more of his designs and art work, in the Museum at the Langdon Down Centre, Normansfield, Teddington. In 2018, Pullen&#x27;s work was the subject of a monographic exhibition at Watts Gallery – Artists&#x27; Village. Pullen&#x27;s model of &quot;The State Barge&quot; was displayed at the Royal College of Nursing&#x27;s exhibition &quot;A history of care or control? 100 years of learning disability nursing&quot;.

==History==

===Initial years===
National Institute of Technology, Calicut was set up in 1961 as Regional Engineering College Calicut (CREC), the ninth of its kind and the first one to be established during the Third Five-Year Plan period. Until the formation of Calicut University in 1963, the institute was affiliated with Kerala University. It was largely due to the efforts of Pattom Thanu Pillai, then Chief Minister of Kerala, that the institute came into being. Prof. S. Rajaraman, the first principal of Government Engineering College, Thrissur was appointed as the special officer in 1961 to organise the college&#x27;s activities until M. V. Kesava Rao took charge as the first principal of the college. The classes were initially held at the Government Polytechnic at West Hill before it moved to its present campus in 1963. The college started with an annual intake of 125 students for the undergraduate courses, on a campus of .

===Expansion===
The undergraduate courses&#x27; intake increased to 250 in 1966, 150 for the first year, and 100 for the preparatory course. The annual intake was reduced from 250 to 200 from the year 1968–69 on account of the industrial recession.

After Prof S. Unnikrishnan Pillai took charge as principal in 1983, the Training and Placement Department started organising student campus recruitments. The college moved into the area of information technology in 1984 with the commissioning of multi-user PSI Omni system and HCL workhorse PCs. In 1987 the college celebrated 25 years of its existence, and postgraduate courses were started. The CEDTI was established on the campus the following year.

In 1990 Shankar Dayal Sharma inaugurated the Architecture Department Block and construction of a computer centre was completed. In 1996, the institute&#x27;s website (the first in Kerala) was launched. The Indian Institute of Management Calicut functioned from the NIT campus in its first few years of existence before moving to its new campus in Kunnamangalam in 2003.

The Ministry of Human Resource Development, Government of India, accorded NIT status to REC Calicut in June 2002 granting it academic and administrative autonomy. It was a lead institute under the World Bank-funded Technical Education Quality Improvement Programme (TEQIP) which began in 2002. In 2003, students were first admitted to the flagship undergraduate B.Tech through the All India Engineering Entrance Exam. With the passing of the National Institutes of Technology Act in May 2007, NIT Calicut was declared an Institute of National Importance. The National Institutes of Technology Act is the second legislation for technical education institutions after the Indian Institutes of Technology Act of 1961. In 2007 NIT Calicut raised its annual intake for its undergraduate programme to 570. The annual intake for the undergraduate programme was increased to 1049 by 2011.

<text>The Beta Israel, or Ethiopian Jews, are a Jewish diaspora group that lived for thousands of years in the territory of the Kingdom of Aksum and its successor the Ethiopian Empire, which is currently divided between the Amhara Region and Tigray Region in modern-day Ethiopia. After the founding of the State of Israel in 1948, most of the Beta Israel immigrated there or were evacuated through several initiatives by the Israeli government. Historically, Beta Israel lived in northern and northwestern Ethiopia, where they were spread out across more than 500 small villages over a wide territory, alongside predominantly Christian and Muslim populations. Most of them were concentrated mainly in what is today North Gondar Zone, Shire Inda Selassie, Wolqayit, Tselemti, Dembia, Segelt, Quara, and Belesa.

The Beta Israel appeared to have been isolated from the more mainstream Jewish communities for at least a millennium, and they practiced a non-Talmudic form of Judaism that is similar in some respects to Karaite Judaism. The religious practices of Israeli Beta Israel are referred to as Haymanot. Having suffered persecution in Ethiopia, a significant portion of the Beta Israel community was forced into Christianity during the 19th and 20th centuries; those who converted to Christianity then came to be known as the Falash Mura. The larger Christian Beta Abraham community is considered to be a crypto-Jewish offshoot of the Beta Israel community.

The Beta Israel first made extensive contact with other Jewish communities in the late 20th century, after which a comprehensive rabbinic debate ensued over their Jewishness. Following &quot;halakhic&quot; and constitutional discussions, Israeli authorities decided in 1977 that the Beta Israel qualified on all fronts for the Israeli Law of Return. Thus, the Israeli government, with support from the United States, began a large-scale effort to conduct transport operations and bring the Beta Israel to Israel in multiple waves. These activities included Operation Banyarwanda, Operation Brothers, which evacuated the Beta Israel community in Sudan between 1979 and 1990 (including Operation Moses in 1984 and Operation Joshua in 1985), and Operation Solomon in 1991.

By the end of 2008, there were 119,300 Ethiopian Jews living in Israel, including nearly 81,000 born in Ethiopia and about 38,500 (about 32% of the Ethiopian Jewish community in Israel) born in Israel with at least one parent born in Ethiopia or Eritrea (formerly a part of Ethiopia). At the end of 2019, there were 155,300 Jews of Ethiopian descent in Israel. Approximately 87,500 were born in Ethiopia, and 67,800 were born in Israel with parents born in Ethiopia. The Ethiopian Jewish community in Israel is mostly composed of Beta Israel (practicing both Haymanot and Rabbinic Judaism), and to a smaller extent, of Falash Mura who left Christianity and began practicing Rabbinic Judaism upon their arrival to Israel.

== Terminology ==

Throughout its history, the community has been referred to by numerous names. According to tradition, the (literally, &#x27;house of Israel&#x27; in Ge&#x27;ez) community had their origins in the 4th century CE, when they refused to convert to Christianity during the rule of Abreha and Atsbeha (identified with Se&#x27;azana and Ezana), the monarchs of the Kingdom of Aksum who embraced Christianity. This name contrasted with , the term for the church in Ge&#x27;ez, literally meaning &quot;house of Christianity&quot;. Since the 1980s, it has also become the official name used in the scholarly and scientific literature to refer to the community. The term , meaning &quot;Israelites&quot;, is also used by the community to refer to its members.

The name (lit. &quot;Jews&quot;) is rarely used in the community, as Ethiopian Christians had used it as a derogatory term; however, the term has increased in usage in the 20th century as the Beta Israel strengthened its ties with other Jewish communities. The term (lit. &quot;Hebrew&quot;) was used to refer to the (lit. &quot;free man&quot;) in the community, in contrast to the (lit. &quot;slave&quot;). The term (lit. &quot;Torah-true&quot;) was also used to refer to the Beta Israel; since the 19th century, it has been used in contrast to the term &quot;Falash Mura&quot; (converts).

The colloquial Ethiopian/Eritrean term &quot;or&quot; , which means &quot;landless&quot;, &quot;wanderers&quot;, or &quot;exiles&quot;, was given to the community in the 15th century by the Emperor Yeshaq I; after they were conquered by the Ethiopian Empire, its use is now considered offensive. The term &quot;Zagwe&quot; is also used for the Beta Israel, although it is considered derogatory, as it associated the community with the Agaw people of the Zagwe dynasty, who largely practice traditional African religion.

==Religion==

Haymanot (Ge&#x27;ez: ሃይማኖት) is the colloquial term for &quot;faith&quot; which is used as a term for the Jewish religion by the Beta Israel community, although Ethiopian Orthodox Christians also use it as a term for their own religion.

===Texts===
 (lit. &quot;Holy Scriptures&quot;) is the name for the religious literature of the Beta Israel. These texts are written in Geʽez, which is also the liturgical language of the Ethiopian Orthodox Church. The holiest book is the Octateuch, known as the Orit among Ethiopian Jews: the Five Books of Moses plus Joshua, Judges and Ruth. The Beta Israel scriptures also include the Book of Lamentations and Book of Jeremiah, which are also found in the Orthodox Tewahedo biblical canon.

Deuterocanonical books that also make up part of the Beta Israel canon are the Book of Sirach, Book of Judith, Esdras 1 and 2, the Books of Meqabyan, Book of Jubilees, Book of Baruch (including 4 Baruch), Book of Tobit, Book of Enoch, and the Testaments of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. Many of these books differ substantially from the similarly numbered and named texts in Koine Greek and Hebrew (such as the Book of Maccabees), though some of the Ge&#x27;ez works are dependent on those texts. Others appear to have different ancient literary and oral origins. Ethiopian Orthodox Christians also use many texts used by the Beta Israel but other rabbinic Jewish groups but not other Christian groups.

Essential non-Biblical writings include the &quot;Mota Aron&quot; (&quot;Death of Aaron&quot;), &quot;Mota Musé&quot; (&quot;Death of Moses&quot;), &quot;Nagara Muse&quot; (&quot;The Conversation of Moses&quot;), &quot;Təʾəzazä Sänbät&quot; (&quot;Commandments of the Sabbath&quot;), &quot;Arde&#x27;et&quot; (&quot;Disciples&quot;), &quot;Gorgoryos&quot; (&quot;Apocalypse of Gorgorios&quot;), &quot;Ezra&quot; (&quot;Apocalypse of Ezra&quot;), &quot;Barok&quot; (&quot;Apocalypse of Baruch&quot;), &quot;Mäṣḥafä Sa&#x27;atat&quot; (&quot;Book of Hours&quot;), &quot;Fālasfā&quot; (&quot;Philosophers&quot;), &quot;Abba Elias&quot; (&quot;Father Elijah&quot;), &quot;Mäṣḥafä Mäla&#x27;əkt&quot; (&quot;Book of Angels&quot;), &quot;Dərsanä Abrəham Wäsara Bägabs&quot; (&quot;Homily on Abraham and Sarah in Egypt&quot;), &quot;Gadla Sosna&quot; (&quot;The Story of Susanna&quot;), and &quot;Baqadāmi Gabra Egzi&#x27;abḥēr&quot; (&quot;In the Beginning God Created&quot;).

===Prayer houses===

The synagogue is called the &quot;masgid&quot; (place of worship), it is also called the &quot;bet maqdas&quot; (Holy house) or the &quot;ṣa lot bet&quot; (Prayer house).

===Dietary laws===

Beta Israel kashrut law is based mainly on the books of Leviticus, Deuteronomy, and Jubilees. Leviticus 11:3–8 and Deuteronomy 14:4–8 list permitted and forbidden land animals and their signs. Leviticus 11:13–23 and Deuteronomy 14:12–20 list forbidden birds. Leviticus 11:9–12 and Deuteronomy 14:9–10 list the signs of permitted fish. Insects and larvae are forbidden in Leviticus 11:41–42. Gid hanasheh is forbidden in Genesis 32:33. Mixtures of milk and meat are not prepared or eaten, but benefiting from them is permitted—Haymanot use a literal interpretation of the verses Exodus 23:19, Exodus 34:26, and Deuteronomy 14:21, &quot;shalt not seethe a kid in its mother&#x27;s milk&quot;, similar to Karaite Judaism; whereas, under Rabbinic Judaism, any benefit from mixing dairy products with meat is banned.

Ethiopian Jews were forbidden to eat the food of non-Jews. A Kahen eats only meat he has slaughtered himself, which someone else may prepare. Someone else may also eat meat that a Kahen has slaughtered. Those who break these taboos are ostracized, and must undergo a purification process that includes fasting for one or more days, eating only uncooked chickpeas provided by the Kahen, and ritual purification, before entering the village.

Unlike other Ethiopians, the Beta Israel do not eat raw meat dishes such as kitfo or gored gored.

===Calendar and holidays===
The Beta Israel calendar is a lunar calendar of 12 months, each 29 or 30 days alternately. Every four years, there is a leap year which adds a full month (30 days). The calendar is a combination of the ancient calendar of Alexandrian Jewry, Book of Jubilees, Book of Enoch, Abu Shaker, and the Ethiopian calendar. The years are counted according to the counting of Kushta: &quot;1571 to Jesus Christ, 7071 to the Gyptians, and 6642 to the Hebrews&quot;; according to this counting, the year 5771 () in the Rabbinical Hebrew calendar is the year 7082 in this calendar.

Beta Israel holidays include (New Year in Nissan), (Passover), (Shavuot, lit. &quot;harvest&quot;), (Rosh Hashana, lit. &quot;blowing holiday&quot;, compare in Hebrew), (Yom Kippur), and (Sukkot, lit. &quot;tabernacles holiday&quot;). Other holidays unique to Beta Israel include (a fast before Shavuot, lit. &quot;harvest fast&quot;), the fourth sabbath of the fifth month, and an additional and in Kislev. The most notable of the holidays unique to Beta Israel is Sigd, or (lit. &quot;supplication&quot;), celebrated on the 29th day of Cheshvan, and recognized as an official state holiday in Israel since 2009. The month of Cheshvan also includes a holiday for the day Moses saw the face of God on the 1st, a holiday for the reception of Moses by the Israelites on the 10th, and a fast on the 12th. The month of Elul also has additional holidays for the Beta Israel— (lit. &quot;year rotate&quot;) on the 1st, (lit. &quot;Elul fast&quot;) between the 1st–9th, (lit. &quot;our atonement&quot;) on the 10th, and (lit. &quot;eighteenth&quot;) on the 28th. The fast in Tammuz (), the fast for Tisha B&#x27;Av (), the fast in Tevet (), and the Fast of Esther () are multi-day fasts while they are only one day in rabbinical Jewish tradition.

The first of each month is celebrated as (lit. &quot;new moon festival&quot;) (compare Rosh Chodesh), and the last of each month is a fast called (compare Yom Kippur Katan). There are also monthly celebrations commemorating the main annual holidays, &quot;asärt&quot; (lit. &quot;ten&quot;) on the tenth day to commemorate Yom Kippur, (lit. &quot;twelve&quot;) for commemorate Shavuot, &quot;and&quot; (lit. &quot;fifteen&quot;) for Passover and Sukkot.

Shabbat is called . There are also weekly fasts on Monday (), Thursday (), and Friday ().

== Culture ==
=== Languages ===
The Beta Israel once spoke Qwara and Kayla, both of which are Agaw languages. Now, they speak Tigrinya and Amharic, both Semitic languages. Their liturgical language is Geʽez, also Semitic. Since the 1950s, they have taught Hebrew in their schools. Those Beta Israel residing in the State of Israel now use Modern Hebrew as a daily language.

==Origins==

===Oral traditions===
Many of the Beta Israel&#x27;s accounts of their own origins state that they stem from the very ancient migration of some portion of the Tribe of Dan to Ethiopia, were led by the sons of Moses, perhaps at the time of the Exodus. Alternative timelines include the later crises in Judea, e. g., the split of the northern Kingdom of Israel from the southern Kingdom of Judah after the death of King Solomon or the Babylonian Exile. Other Beta Israel take as their basis the Christian account of Menelik&#x27;s return to Ethiopia. Menelik is considered the first Solomonic Emperor of Ethiopia, and is traditionally believed to be the son of King Solomon of ancient Israel, and Makeda, ancient Queen of Sheba (in modern Ethiopia). Though all the available traditions correspond to recent interpretations, they reflect ancient convictions. According to Jon Abbink, three different versions are to be distinguished among the traditions which were recorded by the priests of the community.

===Tribe of Dan===
One of the Beta Israel&#x27;s origin stories is that they descend from a group of Danite that immigrated after the split of the Kingdom of Israel, through Egypt, to prove the antiquity and authenticity of their claims, the Beta Israel cite the 9th-century CE testimony of Eldad ha-Dani (the Danite), Eldad was a Jewish man who appeared in Egypt and created a stir in that Jewish community (and elsewhere in the Mediterranean Jewish communities he visited) with claims that he had come from a Jewish kingdom of pastoralists far to the south. The only language Eldad spoke was a hitherto unknown dialect of Hebrew. Although he strictly followed the Mosaic commandments, his observance differed in some details from Rabbinic halakhah. Some observers thought that he might be a Karaite, although his practice also differed from theirs. He carried Hebrew books that supported his explanations of halakhah. He cited ancient authorities in the scholarly traditions of his own people.

Eldad said that the Jews of his own kingdom descended from the tribe of Dan (which included the Biblical war-hero Samson) who had fled the civil war in the Kingdom of Israel between Solomon&#x27;s son Rehoboam and Jeroboam the son of Nebat, and resettled in Egypt. From there, they moved southwards up the Nile into Ethiopia. The Beta Israel say this confirms that they are descended from these Danites. Some Beta Israel, however, assert that their Danite origins go back to the time of Moses, when some Danites parted from other Jews right after the Exodus and moved south to Ethiopia. Eldad the Danite speaks of at least three waves of Jewish immigration into his region, creating other Jewish tribes and kingdoms. The earliest wave settled in a remote kingdom of the &quot;tribe of Moses&quot;: this was the strongest and most secure Jewish kingdom of all, with farming villages, cities and great wealth. Other Ethiopian Jews who appeared in the Mediterranean world over the succeeding centuries and persuaded rabbinic authorities there that they were of Jewish descent, and so could if slaves be ransomed by Jewish communities, join synagogues, marry other Jews, etc., also referred to the Mosaic and Danite origins of Ethiopian Jewry. The Mosaic claims of the Beta Israel, in any case, like those of the Zagwe dynasty, are ancient.

Other sources tell of many Jews who were brought as prisoners of war from ancient Israel by Ptolemy I and settled on the border of his kingdom with Nubia (Sudan). Another tradition asserts that the Jews arrived either via the old district of Qwara in northwestern Ethiopia, or via the Atbara River, where the Nile tributaries flow into Sudan. Some accounts specify the route taken by their forefathers on their way upriver to the south from Egypt.

===Rabbinic views===

As mentioned above, the 9th-century Jewish traveler Eldad ha-Dani claimed he descended from the tribe of Dan. He also reported other Jewish kingdoms around his own or in East Africa during this time. His writings probably represent the first mention of the Beta Israel in Rabbinic literature. Despite some skeptical critics, his authenticity has been generally accepted in current scholarship. His descriptions were consistent and even the originally doubtful rabbis of his time were finally persuaded. Specific details may be uncertain; one critic has noted Eldad&#x27;s lack of detailed reference to Ethiopia&#x27;s geography and any Ethiopian language, although he claimed the area as his homeland.

Eldad&#x27;s was not the only medieval testimony about Jewish communities living far to the south of Egypt, which strengthens the credibility of his account. Obadiah ben Abraham Bartenura wrote in a letter from Jerusalem in 1488:
Rabbi David ibn Zimra of Egypt (1479–1573), writing similarly, held the Ethiopian Jewish community to be similar in many ways to the Karaites, writing of them on this wise:
...Lo! the matter is well-known that there are perpetual wars between the kings of Kush, which has three kingdoms; part of which belonging to the Ishmaelites, and part of which to the Christians, and part of which to the Israelites from the tribe of Dan. In all likelihood, they are from the sect of Sadok and Boethus, who are [now] called Karaites, since they know only a few of the biblical commandments, but are unfamiliar with the Oral Law, nor do they light the Sabbath candle. War ceases not from amongst them, and every day they take captives from one another...

In the same &quot;responsum&quot;, he concludes that if the Ethiopian Jewish community wished to return to rabbinic Judaism, they would be received and welcomed into the fold, just as the Karaites who returned to the teachings of the Rabbanites in the time of Rabbi Abraham ben Maimonides.

Reflecting the consistent assertions made by Ethiopian Jews they dealt with or knew of, and after due investigation of their claims and their own Jewish behaviour, a number of Jewish legal authorities, in previous centuries and in modern times, have ruled &quot;halakhically&quot; (according to Jewish legal code) that the Beta Israel are indeed Jews, the descendants of the tribe of Dan, one of the Ten Lost Tribes. They believe that these people established a Jewish kingdom that lasted for hundreds of years. With the rise of Christianity and later Islam, schisms arose and three kingdoms competed. Eventually, the Christian and Muslim Ethiopian kingdoms reduced the Jewish kingdom to a small impoverished section. The earliest authority to rule this way was the 16th-century scholar David ibn Zimra (Radbaz), who explained elsewhere in a responsum concerning the status of a Beta Israel slave:

In 1973, Ovadia Yosef, the Sephardi chief rabbi of Israel ruled, based on the writings of David ben Solomon ibn Abi Zimra and other accounts, that the Beta Israel were Jews and should be brought to Israel. Two years later this opinion was confirmed by a number of other authorities who made similar rulings, including the Ashkenazi chief rabbi of Israel Shlomo Goren. In 1977, the law was passed granting the right of return.

Some notable poskim (religious law authorities) from non-Zionist Ashkenazi circles, placed a &quot;safek&quot; (legal doubt) over the Jewish peoplehood of the Beta Israel. Such dissenting voices include Rabbi Elazar Shach, Rabbi Yosef Shalom Eliashiv, Rabbi Shlomo Zalman Auerbach, and Rabbi Moshe Feinstein. Similar doubts were raised within the same circles towards the Bene Israel and to Russian immigrants to Israel during the 1990s Post-Soviet aliyah.

In the 1970s and early 1980s, the Beta Israel were required to undergo a modified conversion ceremony involving immersion in a mikveh (ritual bath), a declaration accepting Rabbinic law, and, for men, a &quot;hatafat dam brit&quot; (symbolic recircumcision). Avraham Shapira later waived the &quot;hatafat dam brit&quot; stipulation, which is only a requirement when the &quot;halakhic&quot; doubt is significant. More recently, Shlomo Amar has ruled that descendants of Ethiopian Jews who were forced to convert to Christianity are &quot;unquestionably Jews in every respect&quot;. With the consent of Ovadia Yosef, Amar ruled that it is forbidden to question the Jewishness of this community, pejoratively called Falash Mura in reference to their having converted.

====Companions of Menelik from Jerusalem====
According to one account, the Beta Israel originated in the kingdom of Israel and they were the contemporaries rather than the descendants of King Solomon and Menelik.

===Ethiopian national history===
The Ethiopian history described in the &quot;Kebra Nagast&quot; relates that Ethiopians are descendants of Israelite tribes who came to Ethiopia with Menelik I, alleged to be the son of King Solomon and the Queen of Sheba (or Makeda, in the legend) (see and ). The legend relates that Menelik, as an adult, returned to his father in Jerusalem, and later resettled in Ethiopia. He took with him the Ark of the Covenant.

In the Bible, there is no mention that the Queen of Sheba either married or had any sexual relations with King Solomon (although some identify her with the &quot;black and beautiful&quot; in Song of Songs 1:5). Rather, the narrative records that she was impressed with Solomon&#x27;s wealth and wisdom, and they exchanged royal gifts, and then she returned to rule her people in Kush. However, the &quot;royal gifts&quot; are interpreted by some as sexual contact. The loss of the Ark is not mentioned in the Bible. Hezekiah later makes reference to the Ark in 2 Kings 19:15.

The &quot;Kebra Negast&quot; asserts that the Beta Israel are descended from a battalion of men of Judah who fled southward down the Arabian coastal lands from Judea after the breakup of the Kingdom of Israel into two kingdoms in the 10th century BCE (while King Rehoboam reigned over Judah).

Although the &quot;Kebra Nagast&quot; and some traditional Ethiopian histories have stated that Gudit (or &quot;Yudit&quot;, Judith; another name given her was &quot;Esato&quot;, Esther), a 10th-century usurping queen, was Jewish, some scholars consider that it is unlikely that this was the case. It is more likely, they say, that she was a pagan southerner or a usurping Christian Aksumite Queen. However, she clearly supported Jews, since she founded the Zagwe dynasty, who governed from around 937 to 1270 CE. According to the &quot;Kebra Nagast&quot;, Jewish, Christian and pagan kings ruled in harmony at that time. Furthermore, the Zagwe dynasty claimed legitimacy (according to the &quot;Kebra Nagast&quot;) by saying it was descended from Moses and his Ethiopian wife.

Most of the Beta Israel consider the &quot;Kebra Negast&quot; to be legend. As its name expresses, &quot;Glory of Kings&quot; (meaning the Christian Aksumite kings), it was written in the 14th century in large part to delegitimize the Zagwe dynasty, to promote instead a rival &quot;Solomonic&quot; claim to authentic Jewish Ethiopian antecedents, and to justify the Christian overthrow of the Zagwe by the &quot;Solomonic&quot; Aksumite dynasty, whose rulers are glorified. The writing of this polemic shows that criticisms of the Aksumite claims of authenticity were current in the 14th century, two centuries after they came to power. Many Beta Israel believe that they are descended from the tribe of Dan. Most reject the &quot;Solomonic&quot; and &quot;Queen of Sheba&quot; legends of the Aksumites.

===Genetics===
A number of DNA studies have been done on the Beta Israel.

====Paternal lineages====
According to Cruciani et al. (2002), haplogroup A is the most common paternal lineage among Ethiopian Jews. The clade is carried by around 41% of Beta Israel males, and is primarily associated with Nilo-Saharan and Khoisan-speaking populations. However, the A branches carried by Ethiopians Jews are principally of the A-Y23865 variety, which formed about 10,000 years ago and is localized to the Ethiopian highlands and the Arabian peninsula. The difference with some Khoisan is 54,000 years, and with others 125,000 years.

Additionally, around 18% of Ethiopian Jews are bearers of E-P2 (xM35, xM2); in Ethiopia, most of such lineages belong to E-M329, which has been found in ancient DNA isolated from a 4,500 year old Ethiopian fossil. Such haplotypes are frequent in Southwestern Ethiopia, especially among Omotic-speaking populations.

The rest of the Beta Israel mainly belong to haplotypes linked with the E-M35 and J-M267 haplogroups, which are more commonly associated with Ethio-Semitic and Cushitic-speaking populations in Northeast Africa. Further analysis show that the E-M35 carried by Ethiopian Jews is primarily indigenous to the Horn of Africa rather than being of Levantine origin. Altogether, this suggests that Ethiopian Jews have diverse patrilineages indicative of indigenous Northeast African, not Middle Eastern, origin.

====Maternal lineages====
A 2011 mitochondrial DNA study focused on maternal ancestry sampling 41 Beta Israel found them to carry 51.2% macro-haplogroup L typically found in Africa. The remainder consisted of Eurasian-origin lineages such as 22% R0, 19.5% M1, 5% W, and 2.5% U. However, no identical haplotypes were shared between the Yemenite and Ethiopian Jewish populations, suggesting very little gene flow between the populations and potentially distinct maternal population histories. The maternal ancestral profile of the Beta Israel is similar to those of highland Ethiopian populations, such as the Amhara.

====Autosomal ancestry====
The Ethiopian Jews&#x27; autosomal DNA has been examined in a comprehensive study by Tishkoff et al. (2009) on the genetic affiliations of various populations in Africa. According to Bayesian clustering analysis, the Beta Israel generally grouped with other Ethio-Semitic and Cushitic-speaking populations inhabiting the Horn of Africa.

A 2010 study by Behar et al. on the genome-wide structure of Jews observed that &quot;Ethiopian Jews (Beta Israel) and Indian Jews (Bene Israel and Cochini) cluster with neighbouring autochthonous populations in Ethiopia and western India, respectively, despite a clear paternal link between the Bene Israel and the Levant. These results cast light on the variegated genetic architecture of the Middle East, and trace the origins of most Jewish Diaspora communities to the Levant.&quot;

According to the study of Behar et al. Ethiopian Jews are clustered with the Ethio-Semitic speakers Amhara and Tigrayans rather than the Cushitic-speakers.

The Beta Israel are autosomally closer to other populations from the Horn of Africa than to any other Jewish population, including Yemenite Jews. A 2012 study by Ostrer et al. concluded that the Ethiopian Jewish community was founded about 2,000 years ago probably by only a relatively small number of Jews from elsewhere with local people joining the community, causing Beta Israel to become genetically distant from other Jewish groups.

According to a 2020 study by Agranat-Tamir et al., the DNA of the Ethiopian Jews is mostly of East African origin, but about 20% of their genetic makeup is of Middle Eastern semitic people origin and shows similarity to modern Jewish and Arab populations and Bronze Age Canaanites.

===Scholarly views===

====Early views====
Early secular scholars considered the Beta Israel to be the direct descendant of Jews who lived in ancient Ethiopia, whether they were the descendants of an Israelite tribe, or converted by Jews living in Yemen, or by the Jewish community in southern Egypt at Elephantine. In 1829, Marcus Louis wrote that the ancestors of the Beta Israel related to the Asmach, which were also called Sembritae (&quot;foreigners&quot;), an Egyptian regiment numbering 240,000 soldiers and mentioned by Greek geographers and historians. The Asmach emigrated or were exiled from Elephantine to Kush in the time of Psamtik I or Psamtik II and settled in Sennar and Abyssinia. It is possible that Shebna&#x27;s party from Rabbinic accounts was part of the Asmach.

In the 1930s, Jones and Monroe argued that the chief Semitic languages of Ethiopia may suggest an antiquity of Judaism in Ethiopia. &quot;There still remains the curious circumstance that a number of Abyssinian words connected with religion, such as the words for Hell, idol, Easter, purification, and alms, are of Hebrew origin. These words must have been derived directly from a Jewish source, for the Abyssinian Church knows the scriptures only in a Ge&#x27;ez version made from the Septuagint.&quot;

Richard Pankhurst summarized the various theories offered about their origins as of 1950 that the first members of this community were:
====1980s and early 1990s====
According to Jacqueline Pirenne, numerous Sabaeans left south Arabia and crossed over the Red Sea to Ethiopia to escape from the Assyrians, who had devastated the kingdoms of Israel and Judah in the 8th and 7th centuries BCE. She says that a second major wave of Sabeans crossed over to Ethiopia in the 6th and 5th centuries BCE to escape Nebuchadnezzar II. This wave also included Jews fleeing from the Babylonian takeover of Judah. In both cases, the Sabeans are assumed to have departed later from Ethiopia to Yemen.

According to Menachem Waldman, a major wave of emigration from the Kingdom of Judah to Kush and Abyssinia dates to the Assyrian siege of Jerusalem in the beginning of the seventh century BCE. Rabbinic accounts of the siege assert that only about 110,000 Judeans remained in Jerusalem under King Hezekiah&#x27;s command, whereas about 130,000 Judeans led by Shebna had joined Sennacherib&#x27;s campaign against Tirhakah, king of Kush. Sennacherib&#x27;s campaign failed and Shebna&#x27;s army was lost &quot;at the mountains of darkness&quot;, suggestively identified with the Simien Mountains.

In 1987, Steven Kaplan wrote:
Richard Pankhurst summarized the state of knowledge on the subject in 1992 as follows: &quot;The early origins of the Falashas are shrouded in mystery, and, for lack of documentation, will probably remain so for ever.&quot;

====Recent views====
By 1994, modern scholars of Ethiopian history and Ethiopian Jews generally supported one of two conflicting hypotheses for the origin of the Beta Israel, as outlined by Kaplan:

* An ancient Jewish origin, together with conservation of some ancient Jewish traditions by the Ethiopian Church. Kaplan identifies Simon D. Messing, David Shlush, Michael Corinaldi, Menachem Waldman, Menachem Elon and David Kessler as supporters of this hypothesis.
* A late ethnogenesis of the Beta Israel in the context of historical pressures between the 14th to 16th centuries, from a sect of Ethiopian Christians who took on Biblical Old Testament practices, and came to identify as Jews. Steven Kaplan supports this hypothesis, and lists with him G. J. Abbink, Kay K. Shelemay, Taddesse Tamrat and James A. Quirin. Quirin differs from his fellow researchers in the weight that he assigns to an ancient Jewish element which the Beta Israel have conserved.

Some Ethiopian Jewish practices disagree with rabbinic practice but do match the practices of late Second Temple sects, suggesting that Ethiopian Jews may possess a tradition from ancient Jewish groups whose beliefs have become extinct elsewhere.

==History==

The earliest recorded mention of the Beta Israel comes from the &quot;Royal Chronicle&quot; of Emperor Amda Seyon which dates back to the early 14th century AD. According to this source, the Emperor sent troops to pacify the people &quot;like Jews&quot; in the regions of Semien, Tselemt, Tsegede and Wegara.

Another early reference to the Beta Israel is found in a Christian Ethiopian hagiography which is known as the &quot;Gädl&quot; (Life) of Abba Yafqarana Egzi&#x27;, a 14th-century Ethiopian saint. This work contains an account of a Christian monk by the name of Qozmos, who, following a dispute with his abbot, renounced Christianity, and joined a group of people who followed &quot;the religion of the Jews&quot;. Qozmos then led the Jews of Semien and Tselemt to attack the Christians of Dembiya. Eventually, this revolt was defeated by Emperor Dawit I who dispatched troops from Tigray to crush the rebellion.

==Immigration to Israel==

=== Beta Israel Exodus ===
The emigration of the Beta Israel community to Israel was officially banned by the Communist Derg government of Ethiopia during the 1980s, although it is now known that General Mengistu collaborated with Israel in order to receive money and arms in exchange for granting the Beta Israel safe passage during Operation Moses. Other Beta Israel sought alternative ways of immigration, via Sudan or Kenya.

*Late 1979 – beginning of 1984 – Aliyah activists and Mossad agents operating in Sudan, including Ferede Aklum, called the Jews to come to Sudan where they would eventually be taken to Israel. Posing as Christian Ethiopian refugees from the Ethiopian Civil War, Jews began to arrive in the refugee camps in Sudan. Most Jews came from Tigray and Wolqayt, regions that were controlled by the TPLF, who often escorted them to the Sudanese border. Small groups of Jews were brought out of Sudan in a clandestine operation that continued until an Israeli newspaper exposed the operation and brought it to a halt stranding Beta Israels in the Sudanese camps. In 1981, the Jewish Defense League protested the &quot;lack of action&quot; to rescue Ethiopian Jews by taking over the main offices of HIAS in Manhattan.
*1983 – March 28, 1985 – In 1983 the governor of Gondar region, Major Melaku Teferra was ousted, and his successor removed restrictions on travel out of Ethiopia. Ethiopian Jews, many by this time waiting in Addis Ababa, began again to arrive in Sudan in large numbers; and the Mossad had trouble evacuating them quickly. Because of the poor conditions in the Sudanese camps, many Ethiopian refugees, both Christian and Jewish, died of disease and hunger. Among these victims, it is estimated that between 2,000 and 5,000 were Jews. In late 1984, the Sudanese government, following the intervention of the U.S., allowed the emigration of 7,200 Beta Israel refugees to Europe who then went on to Israel. The first of these two immigration waves, between 20 November 1984 and 20 January 1985, was dubbed Operation Moses (original name &quot;The Lion of Judah’s Cub&quot;) and brought 6,500 Beta Israel to Israel. This operation was followed by Operation Joshua (also referred to as &quot;Operation Sheba&quot;) a few weeks later, which was conducted by the U.S. Air Force, and brought the 494 Jewish refugees remaining in Sudan to Israel. The second operation was mainly carried out due to the critical intervention and pressure from the U.S.

=== Emigration via Addis Ababa ===
*1990–1991: After losing Soviet military support following the collapse of Communism in Central and Eastern Europe, the Ethiopian government allowed the emigration of 6,000 Beta Israel members to Israel in small groups, mostly in hope of establishing ties with the U.S., a major Israeli ally. Many more Beta Israel members crowded into refugee camps on the outskirts of Addis Ababa, the capital of Ethiopia, to escape the civil war raging in the north of Ethiopia (their region of origin), and await their turn to emigrate to Israel.
*May 24–25, 1991 (Operation Solomon): In 1991, the political and economic situation in Ethiopia deteriorated, as rebels mounted attacks against and eventually gained control of Addis Ababa. Worried about the fate of the Beta Israel during the transition period, the Israeli government, with the help of several private groups, resumed the migration. Over the course of 36 hours, a total of 34 El Al passenger planes, with their seats removed to maximize passenger capacity, flew 14,325 Beta Israel non-stop to Israel. 
*1992–1999: During these years, the Qwara Beta Israel immigrated to Israel. Another 4,000 Ethiopian Jews who had failed to reach the assembly centre in Addis Ababa in time were flown to Israel in subsequent months.
*1997–present: In 1997, an irregular emigration began of Falash Mura, which was and still is subject to political developments in Israel.
*2018–2020: In August 2018, the Netanyahu government vowed to bring in 1,000 Falasha Jews from Ethiopia. In April 2019 an estimated 8,000 Falasha were waiting to leave Ethiopia.On February 25, 2020, 43 Falasah arrived in Israel from Ethiopia.
*2021: On November 14, 2021, Falasha Jews in Israel held a protest for their relatives who were left behind in Ethiopia in hopes of convincing the Israeli government to allow their immigration. That day the Israeli Government permitted 9,000 Falasha Jews to go to Israel. On November 29, 2021, the Israeli Government permitted 3,000 more Falasha Jews to go to Israel. In 2021, 1,636 Jews immigrated to Israel from Ethiopia.
*2022: In May 2022 340 Jews from Ethiopia were scheduled to arrive in Israel.
*2023: On February 3, 2023, 120 Jews came from Ethiopia to Israel. On May 9, 2023, 111 Jews from Ethiopia were scheduled to arrive in Israel. On May 23, 2023, 3,000 Jews from Ethiopia were scheduled to arrive in Israel. On July 15, 2023, 5000 Jews from Ethiopia reunited with family in Israel. On August 10, 2023, Israel rescued 200 citizens and Jews from Ethiopia.

===The Falash Mura&#x27;s difficulties in immigrating to Israel===

In 1991, the Israeli authorities announced that the emigration of the Beta Israel to Israel was about to conclude, because almost all of the community had been evacuated. Nevertheless, thousands of other Ethiopians began leaving the northern region to take refuge in the government controlled capital, Addis Ababa, who were Jewish converts to Christianity and asking to immigrate to Israel. As a result, a new term arose which was used to refer to this group: &quot;Falash Mura&quot;. The Falash Mura, who weren&#x27;t part of the Beta Israel communities in Ethiopia, were not recognized as Jews by the Israeli authorities, and were therefore not initially allowed to immigrate to Israel, making them ineligible for Israeli citizenship under Israel&#x27;s Law of Return.

As a result, a lively debate has arisen in Israel about the Falash Mura, mainly between the Beta Israel community in Israel and their supporters and those opposed to a potential massive emigration of the Falash Mura people. The government&#x27;s position on the matter remained quite restrictive, but it has been subject to numerous criticisms, including criticisms by some clerics who want to encourage these people&#x27;s return to Judaism.

During the 1990s, the Israeli government finally allowed most of those who fled to Addis Ababa to immigrate to Israel. Some did so through the Law of Return, which allows an Israeli parent of a non-Jew to petition for his/her son or daughter to be allowed to immigrate to Israel. Others were allowed to immigrate to Israel as part of a humanitarian effort.

The Israeli government hoped that admitting these Falash Mura would finally bring emigration from Ethiopia to a close, but instead prompted a new wave of Falash Mura refugees fleeing to Addis Ababa and wishing to immigrate to Israel. This led the Israeli government to harden its position on the matter in the late 1990s.

In February 2003, the Israeli government decided to accept Orthodox religious conversions in Ethiopia of Falash Mura by Israeli Rabbis, after which they can then immigrate to Israel as Jews. Although the new position is more open, and although the Israeli governmental authorities and religious authorities should in theory allow immigration to Israel of most of the Falash Mura wishing to do so (who are now acknowledged to be descendants of the Beta Israel community), in practice, however, that immigration remains slow, and the Israeli government continued to limit, from 2003 to 2006, immigration of Falash Mura to about 300 per month.

In April 2005, &quot;The Jerusalem Post&quot; stated that it had conducted a survey in Ethiopia, after which it was concluded that tens of thousands of Falash Mura still lived in rural northern Ethiopia.

On 14 November 2010, the Israeli cabinet approved a plan to allow an additional 8,000 Falash Mura to immigrate to Israel.

On November 16, 2015, the Israeli cabinet unanimously voted in favor of allowing the last group of Falash Mura to immigrate over the next five years, but their acceptance will be conditional on a successful Jewish conversion process, according to the Interior Ministry. In April 2016, they announced that a total of 10,300 people would be included in the latest round of Aliyah, over the following 5 years. By May 2021 300 Falasha had been brought to Israel joining 1,700 who had already immigrated; an estimated 12,000 more are in Ethiopia.

==Population==

===Ethiopian Jews in Israel===
The Ethiopian Beta Israel community in Israel today comprises more than 159,500 people. This is a little more than 1 percent of the Israeli population. Most of this population are the descendants and the immigrants who came to Israel during Operation Moses (1984) and Operation Solomon (1991). Civil war and famine in Ethiopia prompted the Israeli government to mount these dramatic rescue operations. The rescues were within the context of Israel&#x27;s national mission to gather diaspora Jews and bring them to the Jewish homeland. Some immigration has continued up until the present day. Today 81,000 Ethiopian Israelis were born in Ethiopia, while 38,500 or 32% of the community are native born Israelis.

Over time, the Ethiopian Jews in Israel moved out of the government owned mobile home camps which they initially lived in and settled in various cities and towns throughout Israel, with the encouragement of the Israeli authorities who grant new immigrants generous government loans or low-interest mortgages.

Similarly to other groups of immigrant Jews who made aliyah to Israel, the Ethiopian Jews have had to overcome obstacles to integrate into Israeli society. Initially the main challenges faced by the Ethiopian Jewish community in Israel arose from communication difficulties (most of the Ethiopian population could not read nor write in Hebrew, and many of the older members could not hold a simple conversation in Hebrew), and discrimination, including manifestations of racism, from some parts of Israeli society. Unlike Russian immigrants, many of whom arrived educated and skilled, Ethiopian immigrants came from an impoverished agrarian country, and were ill-prepared to work in an industrialized country. Efforts to increase social standing and integration have included scholarship programs such as the nursing training supported by La&#x27;Ofek and Hadassah International.
Over the years, there has been significant progress in the integration of young Beta Israels into Israeli society, primarily resulting from serving in the Israeli Defense Forces, alongside other Israelis their age. This has led to an increase in opportunities for Ethiopian Jews after they are discharged from the army.

Despite progress, Ethiopian Jews are still not well assimilated into Israeli-Jewish society. They remain, on average, on a lower economic and educational level than average Israelis. The rate of Ethiopians who have dropped out of school has increased dramatically as well as the rate of juvenile delinquency, and there are high incidences of suicide and depression among this community. Also, while marriages between Jews of different backgrounds are very common in Israel, marriages between Ethiopians and non-Ethiopians are not very common. According to a 2009 study, 90% of Ethiopian-Israelis – 93% of men and 85% of women, are married to other Ethiopian-Israelis. A survey found that 57% of Israelis consider a daughter marrying an Ethiopian unacceptable and 39% consider a son marrying an Ethiopian to be unacceptable. Barriers to intermarriage have been attributed to sentiments in both the Ethiopian community and Israeli society generally. A 2011 study showed that only 13% of high school students of Ethiopian origin felt &quot;fully Israeli&quot;.

In 1996, an event called the &quot;blood bank affair&quot; took place that demonstrated the discrimination and racism against Ethiopians in Israeli society. Blood banks would not use Ethiopian blood out of the fear of HIV being generated from their blood. Discrimination and racism against Israeli Ethiopians is still perpetuated. In May 2015, Israeli Ethiopians demonstrated in Tel Aviv and Jerusalem against racism, after a video was released, showing an Israeli soldier of Ethiopian descent that was brutally beaten up by the Israeli police. Interviewed students of Ethiopian origin affirm that they do not feel accepted in Israeli society, due to a very strong discrimination towards them. Many scholars such as Ben-Eliezer have been exploring how the discrimination, cultural racism, and exclusion have resulted in metaphorically sending many of the new generation of Ethiopian Jews &quot;back to Africa&quot;. They say this because many of the new generation have been reclaiming their traditional Ethiopian names, Ethiopian language, Ethiopian culture, and Ethiopian music.

=== Converts ===

==== Falash Mura ====

Falash Mura is the name given to those of the Beta Israel community in Ethiopia who converted to Christianity under pressure from Christian missionaries during the 19th century and the 20th century. This term consists of Jews who did not adhere to Jewish law, as well as Jewish converts to Christianity, who did so either voluntarily or who were forced to do so.

Many Ethiopian Jews whose ancestors converted to Christianity have been returning to the practice of Judaism. The Israeli government can thus set quotas on their immigration and make citizenship dependent on their conversion to Orthodox Judaism.

==== Beta Abraham ====
=== Slaves ===

Slavery was practiced in Ethiopia as in much of Africa until it was formally abolished in 1942. After the slave was bought by a Jew, he went through conversion (&quot;giyur&quot;), and became property of his master.

==In popular culture==
*The 2005 Israeli-French film &quot;Go, Live, and Become&quot; (), directed by Romanian-born Radu Mihăileanu focuses on Operation Moses. The film tells the story of an Ethiopian Christian child whose mother has him pass as Jewish so he can immigrate to Israel and escape the famine looming in Ethiopia. The film was awarded the 2005 Best Film Award at the Copenhagen International Film Festival. 
* Several prominent musicians and rappers are of Ethiopian origin.
*The plot of the 2019 American film &quot;Uncut Gems&quot; opens with Ethiopian Jewish miners retrieving an opal in Africa.
*The 2019 film &quot;The Red Sea Diving Resort&quot; is loosely based on the events of Operation Moses and Operation Joshua in 1984–1985, in which the Mossad covertly evacuated Jewish Ethiopian refugees to Israel using a base at the once-abandoned holiday resort of Arous Village on the Red Sea coast of Sudan.
*Israeli-born singer Eden Alene was set to represent Israel at the Eurovision Song Contest 2020 in Rotterdam, Netherlands. The chorus of her song &quot;Feker Libi&quot; featured lyrics in Amharic, Arabic and Hebrew. Due to the 2020 contest&#x27;s cancellation, she represented Israel again in 2021 with the song &quot;Set Me Free&quot;, placing 17th out of 26 in the final.

===Monuments===

National memorials to the Ethiopian Jews who died on their way to Israel are located in Kiryat Gat, and at the National Civil Cemetery of the State of Israel in Mount Herzl in Jerusalem.

===Ethiopian Heritage Museum===
In 2009, plans to establish an Ethiopian Heritage Museum dedicated to the heritage and culture of the Ethiopian Jewish community were unveiled in Rehovot. The museum will include a model of an Ethiopian village, an artificial stream, a garden, classrooms, an amphitheater, and a memorial to Ethiopian Zionist activists and Ethiopian Jews who died &quot;en route&quot; to Israel.

===Café Shahor Hazak===
Strong Black Coffee (&quot;Café Shahor Hazak&quot;; קפה שחור חזק) is an Ethiopian-Israeli hip hop duo. The duo were a nominee for the 2015 MTV Europe Music Awards Best Israeli Act award.

=== Terminology ===
The original term that the Beta Israel gave to the converts was &quot;Faras Muqra&quot; (&quot;horse of the raven&quot;) in which the word &quot;horse&quot; refers to the converts and the word &quot;raven&quot; refers to the missionary Martin Flad who used to wear black clothes. This term derived the additional names &quot;Falas Muqra&quot;, &quot;Faras Mura&quot; and &quot;Falas Mura&quot;. In Hebrew the term &quot;Falash Mura&quot; (or &quot;Falashmura&quot;) is probably a result of confusion over the use of the term &quot;Faras Muqra&quot; and its derivatives and on the basis of false cognate it was given the Hebrew meaning &quot;Falashim Mumarim&quot; (&quot;converted Falashas&quot;).

The actual term &quot;Falash Mura&quot; has no clear origin. It is believed that the term may come from the Agaw and means &quot;someone who changes their faith.&quot;

===History===
In 1860, Henry Aaron Stern, a Jewish convert to Christianity, traveled to Ethiopia in an attempt to convert the Beta Israel community to Christianity.

=== Conversion to Christianity ===
For years, Ethiopian Jews were unable to own land and were often persecuted by the Christian majority of Ethiopia. Ethiopian Jews were afraid to touch non-Jews because they believed non-Jews were not pure. They were also ostracized by their Christian neighbors. For this reason, many Ethiopian Jews converted to Christianity to seek a better life in Ethiopia. The Jewish Agency&#x27;s Ethiopia emissary, Asher Seyum, says the Falash Mura &quot;converted in the 19th and 20th century, when Jewish relations with Christian rulers soured. Regardless, many kept ties with their Jewish brethren and were never fully accepted into the Christian communities. When word spread about the aliyah, many thousands of Falash Mura left their villages for Gondar and Addis Ababa, assuming they counted.&quot;

In the Achefer woreda of the Mirab Gojjam Zone, roughly 1,000–2,000 families of Beta Israel were found. There may be other such regions in Ethiopia with significant Jewish enclaves, which would raise the total population to more than 50,000 people.

=== Return to Judaism ===
The Falash Mura did not refer to themselves as members of the Beta Israel, the name for the Ethiopian Jewish community, until after the first wave of immigration to Israel. Beta Israel by ancestry, the Falash Mura believe they have just as much of a right to return to Israel as the Beta Israel themselves. Rabbi Ovadiah Yosef, a major player in the first wave of Beta Israel immigration to Israel, declared in 2002 that the Falash Mura had converted out of fear and persecution and therefore should be considered Jews.

=== Aliyah to Israel ===
Today, Falash Mura who move to Israel must undergo conversion on arrival, making it increasingly more difficult for them to get situated into Israeli society. The Beta Israel who immigrated and made Aliyah through Operation Moses and Operation Solomon were not required to undergo conversion because they were accepted as Jews under the Law of Return.

On February 16, 2003, the Israeli government applied Resolution 2958 to the Falash Mura, which grants maternal descendants of Beta Israel the right to immigrate to Israel under the Israeli Law of Return and to obtain citizenship if they convert to Judaism.

=== Controversy ===
Today, both Israeli and Ethiopian groups dispute the Falash Mura&#x27;s religious and political status. The Israeli government fears that these people are just using Judaism as an excuse to leave Ethiopia in efforts to improve their lives in a new country. Right-wing member of the Israeli Knesset Bezalel Smotrich was quoted saying, &quot;This practice will develop into a demand to bring more and more family members not included in the Law of Return. It will open the door to an endless extension of a family chain from all over the world,&quot; he wrote, according to Kan. &quot;How can the state explain in the High Court the distinction it makes between the Falashmura and the rest of the world?&quot; Although the government has threatened to stop all efforts to bring these people to Israel, they have still continued to address the issue. In 2018, the Israeli government allowed 1,000 Falash Mura to immigrate to Israel. However, members of the Ethiopian community say the process for immigration approval is poorly executed and inaccurate, dividing families. At least 80 percent of the tribe members in Ethiopia say they have first-degree relatives living in Israel, and some have been waiting for 20 years to immigrate.

<text>Laurence Kim Peek (November 11, 1951December 19, 2009) was an American savant. Known as a &quot;megasavant&quot;, he had an exceptional memory, but he also experienced social difficulties, possibly resulting from a developmental disability related to congenital brain abnormalities. He was the inspiration for the character Raymond Babbitt in the 1988 movie &quot;Rain Man&quot;. Although Peek was previously diagnosed with autism, he is now thought to have had FG syndrome. The Utah Film Center&#x27;s Peek Award honors his legacy.

==Early life==

Laurence Kim Peek was born in Salt Lake City, Utah, with macrocephaly, damage to the cerebellum, and agenesis of the corpus callosum, a condition in which the nerves that connect the two hemispheres of the brain are missing; in Peek&#x27;s case, secondary connectors, such as the anterior commissure, were also missing. There is speculation that his neurons had made unusual connections due to the absence of a corpus callosum, resulting in an increased memory capacity. According to Peek&#x27;s father, Francis &quot;Fran&quot; Peek, Kim was able to memorize information from the age of 16 to 20 months, reading books and memorizing them before placing them upside-down on his bookshelf to show that he had finished—a habit he maintained all his life. He could speed-through an entire book in about an hour and remember almost everything he had read, memorizing vast amounts of information on subjects ranging from history and literature, geography and numbers to sports, music and dates. Peek read by scanning the left page with his left eye, while reading the right page with his right eye. According to an article in &quot;The Times&quot;, he could accurately recall the contents of at least 12,000 books. Peek lived in Murray, Utah, and spent a considerable amount of his time reading at the Salt Lake City Library and demonstrating his capabilities at schools, with great help from his father.

However, Peek did not walk until he was four years old, and even then in a sidelong manner; he could not button up a shirt, and had difficulty with other ordinary motor skills (presumably due to his damaged cerebellum, which normally coordinates motor activities). During psychological evaluations, Peek yielded superior ability in the performance sub-tests and limited ability in the verbal sub-tests, leading his overall IQ of 87 not to be considered a valid measure of his cognitive ability.

During his adult life, Peek attended the Columbus Center, earning $40 a week completing payrolls for 86 employees of the Salt Lake City School District. Peek&#x27;s father did not fully appreciate his son&#x27;s talents until 1979, when Peek accurately predicted that the plummeting Skylab space station would land near Perth, Western Australia.

==&quot;Rain Man&quot;==
In 1984, screenwriter Barry Morrow met Peek in Arlington, Texas; the result of the meeting was the 1988 Academy Award-winning film &quot;Rain Man&quot;. The character of Raymond Babbitt, although inspired by Peek, was depicted as being an individual with autism. Dustin Hoffman, who portrayed Babbitt in the film, met Peek and other individuals that displayed savant mannerisms, studying their characteristics and nature in order to play the role as accurately as possible. The movie led to a number of requests for appearances, which increased Peek&#x27;s self-confidence. Barry Morrow gave Peek his Oscar statuette to carry with him and show at these appearances; it has since been referred to as the &quot;Most Loved Oscar Statue&quot; because it has been held by more people than any other. Peek also enjoyed approaching strangers and showing them his talent for calendar calculations by telling them on which day of the week they were born and what news items were on the front page of major newspapers that day. Peek also appeared on television. He traveled with his father, who took care of him and performed many motor tasks that Peek found difficult.

==Scientific investigation==
In 2004, scientists at the Center for Bioinformatics Space Life Sciences at the NASA Ames Research Center examined Peek with a series of tests including computed tomography (CT scan) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The intent was to create a three-dimensional view of his brain structure and to compare the images to MRI scans performed in 1988. These were the first tentative approaches in using non-invasive technology to further investigate Kim&#x27;s savant abilities.

A 2008 study concluded that Peek probably had FG syndrome, a rare X chromosome-linked genetic syndrome that causes physical anomalies such as hypotonia (low muscle tone) and macrocephaly (abnormally large head).

==Tributes==
Barry Morrow put his own Oscar statuette on permanent loan to Salt Lake City in memory of Kim Peek and put forward the money for the Peek Award, which &quot;pays tribute to artists, media makers, and film subjects who are positively impacting our society&#x27;s perception of people with disabilities&quot; and is given out by the Utah Film Center.

<text>Leslie Lemke (born January 31, 1952) is a blind American savant who is most notable for his work as a musician.

==Biography==

Leslie Lemke was born prematurely in Milwaukee, Wisconsin in 1952. As a complication of his premature birth, he developed retinal problems, then glaucoma, and his eyes had to be surgically removed in the first months of life. He also had brain damage that caused cerebral palsy and severe intellectual disability. His birth mother gave him up for adoption, and the county asked May Lemke, a nurse-governess, if she would take Lemke into her receiving home. He was 12 before he learned to stand, and 15 before he learned to walk.

Though social services had warned May Lemke that Leslie was likely to die, she maintained that he would not die under her care. To feed him, May sometimes placed cereal on his tongue and stroked his throat to encourage him to swallow. It was a year before Leslie could chew food on his own. It took years of constant care before this changed. During this time, he could sing somewhat and repeat some phrases, but was not conversant, and was distant and unemotional. He could repeat verbatim and in the exact tone what he had heard, including, &quot;Foster mother has done well, but the time will come when institutional placement will be necessary.&quot; To teach him to walk, the approximately four and a half foot May devised a strap system by which Leslie could be supported while he walked with her.

When Leslie was 7, Joe and May Lemke obtained a piano for him, with May placing her hands over his to play some simple tunes. Soon Leslie was playing these tunes on the piano and used other instruments such as drums, accordion, and chord organ. Even though his spasticity was so severe that he could not hold eating utensils, this handicap disappeared when playing the piano. By age 12 Leslie was playing the piano and singing songs he had heard for hours on end. Though he had not often heard classical music, when he was about 16, his foster parents awoke in the middle of the night to Leslie flawlessly playing Tchaikovsky&#x27;s Piano Concerto no. 1, which he had heard on television that night. Leslie was soon playing all styles of music, from ragtime to classical.

Leslie could remember and play back a musical piece of any length flawlessly after hearing it once. Among the many songs he was estimated to know, two that he often sang were the Christian hymns &quot;How Great Thou Art&quot; and &quot;Amazing Grace&quot;. As time went on, Leslie became more verbal and more musically accomplished, and increasingly creative and witty. After playing back a musical piece he had heard, he sometimes launched into an improvisation of it. He was known to have composed songs on the spot, singing with a baritone voice. His verbal IQ is 58.

By 1980, Leslie was regularly giving concerts in Fond du Lac, Wisconsin. His newfound fame gained him invitations to television shows such as CBC&#x27;s &quot;Man Alive&quot;, the &quot;CBS Evening News&quot;, &quot;60 Minutes&quot;, and &quot;That&#x27;s Incredible!&quot; In 1983, ABC broadcast &quot;The Woman Who Willed a Miracle&quot;, a drama about Leslie and his adoptive mother. It starred Cloris Leachman as May Lemke. Leslie is also the subject of Fred Small&#x27;s song, &quot;Leslie is Different&quot; and makes a short appearance in Michael Vey 4.

Leslie has toured the United States, Scandinavia, and Japan, and has given free concerts on occasion.

His adoptive mother May Lemke developed Alzheimer&#x27;s disease and died on November 6, 1993.

<text>Jonathan Lerman (born 1987) is an American autistic savant outsider artist. He was born in Queens, NY, and currently resides in the upstate New York suburb of Vestal.

He began to lapse into long silences at the age of two, and the next year he was diagnosed with autism. His IQ is purported to be 53. His artistic bent appeared at the age of 10 years in the form of charcoal-drawn faces—both people he knows and those he imagines. In 1999, he had his own solo exhibition at the KS Art gallery in New York City.

He has had personal exhibitions, and has also exhibited his work alongside others. He was also the subject of the MTV television program &quot;True Life&quot; in the episode &quot;True Life: I Have Autism&quot; to describe his life as an autistic savant.

<doc id="763508" wikidata="Q5108293" url="?curid=763508" title="Chris Torrance">
<text>Chris Torrance (1941 – 21 August 2021) was a poet associated with the British Poetry Revival of the 1960s, mainly known for long poetry cycle &quot;The Magic Door&quot; published as a series of volumes over 30 years.

== Biography ==
Born in Edinburgh in 1941, Torrance grew up in London and moved to Pontneddfechan, Wales in 1970. He taught an extramural creative writing course at University College Cardiff for 25 years. He performed literary cabaret with the poetry and music group Poetheat, which he co-founded in 1985 with composer Chris Vine, later called Heat Poets.

His work shows the influence of the Beats, especially Gary Snyder and William Burroughs and an interest in the matter and monuments of ancient Britain, including such &#x27;magical&#x27; or religious phenomena as ley lines. He also expressed an admiration for the writings of Charles Olson and David Jones. He is one of the poets discussed in William Rowe&#x27;s &quot;Three Lyric Poets&quot; (Northcote House, 2009).

Torrance has featured in a number of key Revival magazines including &quot;Poetmeat&quot; and the anthologies &quot;Children of Albion: Poetry of the Underground in Britain&quot; (1969), &quot;Conductors of Chaos&quot; (1996) and &quot;&quot; (1999).

His major work was the ongoing &quot;Magic Door&quot; sequence, of which eight books have been published to date by various publishers. The ninth volume, &quot;Path&quot; was prepared for publication in 2008 but was not released. In 2017 Torrance noted that there were a further three volumes in the pipeline. A collected edition of the first eight books was published in 2017 as &quot;The Magic Door&quot; by Test Centre with an introduction by Phil Maillard. The sequence follows his life at Glyn y Mercher Isaf, recording his practical activities, his love life, and his engagement with nature, mythology, geology and history. He develops the concept of a landscape filled with powers - ley lines and standing stones, pagan gods and spirits, and focuses on the nearby standing stones of Maen Madoc and Maen Llia and the 19th century house of Glan yr Afon which incorporates geological oddities and an elaborate stone archway. Torrance died on 21 August 2021 at the age of 80. The Glasfryn Project plans to publish some of his work posthumously.

<text>Alonzo Clemons (born 1958) is an American savant and sculptor from Boulder, Colorado. He sustained a severe brain injury as a child that left him with a developmental disability. He achieved fame for his ability to sculpt almost any animal in a realistic and anatomically accurate three-dimensional rendering even after glancing at a picture for only mere seconds.

==Life==
Clemons was born in Boulder, Colorado, in 1958, where he has lived his entire life. At the age of three or four, Clemons experienced a severe brain injury due to a falling accident. This left him with a developmental disability, having an IQ of around 40 and the mental development of a six-year-old. According to his mother, molding clay was his only interest as a child ever since the accident. The accident left him barely able to speak and without the ability to read, write, drive a car, or tie his shoes, meaning he would only be able to live with assistance for the rest of his life. Due to the time he grew up in, his condition was not significantly treated in his youth. Nevertheless, he acquired a high level of self-sufficiency, living in his own apartment and studio next to his mother, while his improving social skills allowed him to work part-time at the local YMCA and partake in Special Olympics events in powerlifting.

Clemons is considered an acquired savant, meaning a person that acquired a disability and in turn received a prodigious talent in a certain field, in his case sculpting. Savant syndrome researcher Darold Treffert has referred to Clemons as a prodigy, stating that if he were not disabled, he would be considered a genius.

==Artistry==
His talent for sculpting began to show shortly after his injury, when he started using clay, or, when unavailable, materials like butter, lard, or even bitumen to sculpt various animals, in most cases using only his hands. As with other savants, he received and required no formal training of any sort, but is immediately able to sculpt any animal he sees, be it in person, on TV or on a photo, in an accurate three-dimensional rendering, creating extremely lifelike clay sculptures that may later be cast into other materials. Researchers have speculated that he is able to &quot;freeze the frame&quot; of what he sees at any moment in time and reproduce the exact image. By 1987, he had already produced 500 clay pieces that filled his entire apartment. One of his gallerists asserted that his ability grew the more contact to animals he had, attributing regular visits to the Denver Zoo and local animal farms to his increased skill and range. While most of his works centers around animals, he has also produced sculptures of humans or religious symbols. Most of his artworks are small in size and sculpted in less than an hour, however; he has also produced life-sized sculptures. His first work of the sort, &quot;Three Frolicking Foals&quot;, which was sold for $45,000 in 1987, only took him 15 days to produce, even though it required him to learn new techniques. Aside from sculpting, he has also picked up pastel drawing.

In 1983, he appeared in public for the first time on &quot;60 Minutes&quot; on CBS and in May of the same year had his first public exhibition at an art gallery in Denver, Colorado, where a sculpture of a bull was sold for $950. For decades, he had practiced his art in obscurity, until the 1988 film &quot;Rain Man&quot; created an interest in savant syndrome. Subsequently, he was shown in multiple international documentaries and TV shows, such as the German documentary &quot;Expedition ins Gehirn&quot;, leading to an increased interest in his art, which was then picked up by galleries and shown in art museums and at exhibitions around the world.

Clemons cannot describe how he sculpts and why his ability mostly relates to animals, but considers his ability to be a &quot;gift from God&quot; and not something he can, but rather something he has to do, an inner urge that enables him to show how he sees the world. When asked how he does it, Alonzo will simply smile and point to his head. His assistant has referred to working with clay as an &quot;integral part of his personhood&quot;, while he himself stated that he would be miserable if he were unable to sculpt.

<text>Adelaide Metro is the public transport system of the Adelaide area, around the capital city of South Australia. It is an intermodal system offering an integrated network of bus, tram, and train services throughout the metropolitan area. The network has an annual patronage of 79.9 million, of which 51 million journeys are by bus, 15.6 million by train, and 9.4 million by tram. The system has evolved heavily over the past fifteen years, and patronage increased dramatically during the 2014–15 period, a 5.5 percent increase on the 2013 figures due to electrification of frequented lines.

Adelaide Metro began in 2000 with the privatisation of existing government-operated bus routes. Services are now run by two private operators and united with common ticketing systems, marketing, liveries and signage under the supervision of the state government&#x27;s Department for Infrastructure and Transport. Since the 2010s, energy sustainability and eco-friendly transport has been a major focus for Adelaide Metro. Hence, the fleet has been progressively upgraded with electric trains and solar-powered buses–one of which, known as the Tindo electric bus, is 100% solar powered and the first of its kind in the world. Despite this, as of 2016, almost 80 percent of Adelaide&#x27;s metropolitan buses still run on diesel fuel rather than biodiesel or batteries.

Currently, the Adelaide Metro encompasses seven different train lines, the sole Glenelg tram line, which is the only one of Adelaide&#x27;s tramways to survive the 1950s and the only one to be integrated into the current system, with extensions added in the 2010s, and over 300 bus routes. 

== History ==
The Adelaide Metro is a brand introduced in April 2000, following the second round of tenders privatisation of formerly government-operated bus services.

The public transport system in Adelaide has previously been known under several names. The State Transport Authority was formed in 1974, combining the metropolitan rail operations of the former South Australian Railways Commission, and the bus and tram operations of the former Municipal Tramways Trust. Adelaide removed almost all tramlines from the 1930s to 1958 leaving only the Glenelg line. This tramline was extended in 2007 by the Department of Transport, Energy &amp; Infrastructure (DTEI), and again to the Adelaide Entertainment Centre in 2010. In July 1994, the STA was abolished and government public transport services were transferred to TransAdelaide, a publicly owned corporation.

In 1995–96, there was a partial tendering of the bus services. TransAdelaide retained three contract regions, Serco won two contract regions, and Hills Transit a joint venture between Australian Transit Enterprises and TransAdelaide, one. Services were run and marketed under each operator&#x27;s name, presenting a disjointed network to the public.

The 2000 round of tenders ended TransAdelaide&#x27;s direct operation of bus services, while retaining the train and tram services. Serco won the North-South, Outer North, and Outer North-East contract areas. SouthLink won the Outer South contract area. Torrens Transit won the East-West contract area. City Free services and Transitplus, a joint venture between Australian Transit Enterprises and TransAdelaide, won the Hills contract area. The Adelaide Metro brand was applied across all transport operators, appearing to the public as a unified network, with common livery, timetable designs and a city Information Centre.

=== Environmental Incentives ===
The State Government has pledged that the Adelaide Metro would use cleaner fuels like biodiesel and natural gas in an effort to make Adelaide a carbon neutral city. In 2016, nearly 80 percent of the Adelaide Metro buses ran on diesel, which is harmful for the environment due to the presence of sulfur. In 2023, the state government announced that a feasibility study was underway to replace Adelaide Metro&#x27;s ageing diesel train fleet with zero-emission technology.

== Services ==
=== Buses ===
The largest element of Adelaide&#x27;s public transport system is a fleet of diesel and natural gas powered buses. The majority of services terminate in the Adelaide city centre, suburban railway stations or shopping centre interchanges. As contracts are revised for privatised bus operations, more cross suburban routes are added to the network. In the past, bus routes were largely focused on moving passengers from the suburbs to the CBD.

A major component of the Adelaide Metro bus service is the O-Bahn guided busway to Modbury, carrying around 9 million passengers a year. From its opening in 1986 until August 2011 it was the world&#x27;s longest busway, with a length of . It remains the world&#x27;s fastest busway with a maximum permitted speed of . Away from the O-Bahn, whilst there have been dedicated bus lanes and bus-only signal phases at some traffic lights provided for a number of years, a major improvement to bus priority and reliability arrived with the delivery in July 2012 of the CBD Bus Lane project.

Adelaide Metro buses are split up geographically into six contract regions, with services operated by Torrens Connect, Torrens Transit, SouthLink and Busways. The current contracts began in July 2020 for a period of eight years, with an option to extend for two years.

=== Trains ===

The Adelaide suburban railway network consists of seven lines operated by Keolis Downer under contract to the Government of South Australia since January 2021. In 2023, the state government announced that rail services would return to government operation in January 2025, fulfilling an election commitment by the South Australian Labor Party. Keolis Downer would then continue to provide maintenance, customer and security services until 2027. The handover of operations back to state government was completed on 2 February 2025.

Until 2014, the suburban network was the only one in Australia to operate solely with diesel railcars. Between 2013–2014, the full lengths of the Seaford and Tonsley lines were electrified, as well as the adjacent segment of the Belair line from Goodwood to its terminus at Adelaide. Electric trains have run on the Seaford and Tonsley lines since 2014. Although the original plans were to electrify the remaining three lines, they were abandoned in 2012. The Gawler line was electrified in 2022.

As at July 2019, the fleet consists of 70 3000/3100 class diesel railcars and 22 three-carriage 4000 class electric multiple units. All remaining 2000/2100 class train cars were retired from service in August 2015.

Adelaide&#x27;s rail lines all run into Adelaide railway station in the CBD. They are:

===Trams===
Adelaide&#x27;s once extensive tram network was dismantled in the middle of the 20th century, leaving only the Glenelg tram running between Victoria Square in the city-centre and Moseley Square on the beachfront at Glenelg. The majority of the line is on a dedicated corridor though the western suburbs, and travels on roadway in the city from the terminus to South Terrace and along Jetty Road in Glenelg.

An extension of the line from Victoria Square down King William Street then along North Terrace opened in October 2007. A further extension along Port Road to the Adelaide Entertainment Centre opened in December 2009. The line has stops adjacent to key city points, including Rundle Mall, the Adelaide Railway Station and the City West campus of the University of South Australia.

A 2018 extension added stops adjacent to more key locations including the Festival Theatre, the Art Gallery, the University of Adelaide and the Adelaide Botanic Garden. Construction this new junction, branch lines along the eastern end of North Terrace and King William Road and four new stops began in July/August 2017 and opened in October 2018. There is no fare charged on certain sections of the line.

The line is operated from Glengowrie depot, with 15 Bombardier Flexity Classic trams built between 2005 and 2010 and nine Alstom Citadis trams that were built for, but were surplus to their needs of Metro Ligero, Madrid in 2009. The latter were modified by Yarra Trams&#x27; Preston Workshops before entering service. A further three unused former Madrid Citadis trams entered service in 2018.

In July 2019, the government announced the provision of tram services would be contracted out. Torrens Connect began operating the trams in July 2020. As part of an election commitment, the government announced in 2023 that tram services would return to public ownership by July 2025.

== Ticketing ==
The Adelaide Metro ticketing system is multi-modal, meaning that one ticket can be used to transfer between trains, trams and buses, regardless of the service provider. In September 1987, the Metroticket system developed by Crouzet was introduced. This used magnetic strip technology. In 2010, a contract to introduce the metroCARD smartcard ticketing system was awarded to Affiliated Computer Services. It was rolled out in November 2012. The older system was phased out in 2015.

In 2021, as part of a staged upgrade to Adelaide Metro&#x27;s ticketing system, contactless payments have been rolled out on all trams, allowing passengers to use debit and credit cards to pay for fares. In 2022, this roll-out continued on O-Bahn bus services, and as of 2023, is now rolling out network-wide, including all remaining buses, and trains.

In 2024, Adelaide Metro released the Adelaide Metro Buy &amp; Go App, this app allows passengers to buy tickets to be used on Buses, Tram and train leaving the Adelaide Railway Station. The app will be rolled out to all train users by late 2025.

<doc id="763514" wikidata="Q253224" url="?curid=763514" title="Armistice of 11 November 1918">
<text>The Armistice of 11 November 1918 was the armistice signed in a railroad car, in the Compiègne Forest near the town of Compiègne, that ended fighting on land, at sea, and in the air in World War I between the Entente and their last remaining opponent, Germany. Previous armistices had been agreed with Bulgaria, the Ottoman Empire and Austria-Hungary. It was concluded after the German government sent a message to American president Woodrow Wilson to negotiate terms on the basis of a recent speech of his and the earlier declared &quot;Fourteen Points&quot;, which later became the basis of the German surrender at the Paris Peace Conference, which took place the following year.

Also known as the Armistice of Compiègne (, ) from the town near the place where it was officially agreed to at 5:00 a.m. by the Allied Supreme Commander, French Marshal Ferdinand Foch, it came into force at 11:00 a.m. Central European Time (CET) on 11 November 1918 and marked a victory for the Entente and a defeat for Germany, although not formally a surrender.

The actual terms, which were largely written by Foch, included the cessation of hostilities on the Western Front, the withdrawal of German forces from west of the Rhine, Entente occupation of the Rhineland and bridgeheads further east, the preservation of infrastructure, the surrender of aircraft, warships, and military materiel, the release of Allied prisoners of war and interned civilians, eventual reparations, no release of German prisoners and no relaxation of the naval blockade of Germany. The armistice was extended three times while negotiations continued on a peace treaty. The Treaty of Versailles, which was officially signed on 28 June 1919, took effect on 10 January 1920.

Fighting continued up until 11 a.m. CET on 11 November 1918, with 2,738 men dying on the last day of the war.

== Background ==

===Deteriorating situation for the Germans===

The military situation for the Central Powers had been deteriorating rapidly since the Battle of Amiens at the beginning of August 1918, which precipitated a German withdrawal to the Hindenburg Line and loss of the gains of the German spring offensive. The Allied advance, later known as the Hundred Days Offensive, entered a new stage on 28 September, when a massive United States and French attack opened the Meuse–Argonne offensive, while to the north, the British were poised to assault at the St Quentin Canal, threatening a giant pincer movement.

Meanwhile, the Ottoman Empire was close to exhaustion, the Austro-Hungarian Empire was in chaos, and on the Macedonian front, resistance by the Bulgarian Army had collapsed, leading to the Armistice of Salonica on 29 September. With the collapse of Bulgaria, and Italian victory in the Battle of Vittorio Veneto, the road was open to an invasion of Germany from the south via Austria. In Germany, chronic food shortages caused by the Allied blockade were increasingly leading to discontent and disorder. Although morale on the German front line was reasonable, battlefield casualties, starvation rations and Spanish flu had caused a desperate shortage of manpower, and those recruits that were available were war-weary and disaffected.

===October 1918 telegrams and inter-Allied negotiations===
On 29 September 1918, the German Supreme Army Command at Imperial Army Headquarters in Spa of occupied Belgium informed Emperor Wilhelm II and the Imperial Chancellor, Count Georg von Hertling, that the military situation facing Germany was hopeless. Quartermaster General Erich Ludendorff claimed that he could not guarantee that the front would hold for another two hours. Stating that the collapse of Bulgaria meant that troops destined for the Western Front would have to be diverted there, and this had &quot;fundamentally changed the situation in view of the attacks being launched on the Western Front&quot;, Ludendorff demanded a request be given to the Entente for an immediate ceasefire. In addition, he recommended the acceptance of the main demands of US president Woodrow Wilson (the Fourteen Points) including putting the Imperial Government on a democratic footing, hoping for more favorable peace terms. This enabled him to save the face of the Imperial German Army and put the responsibility for the capitulation and its consequences squarely into the hands of the democratic parties and the parliament. He expressed his view to officers of his staff on 1 October: &quot;They now must lie on the bed that they&#x27;ve made for us.&quot;

On 3 October 1918, the liberal Prince Maximilian of Baden was appointed Chancellor of Germany, replacing Georg von Hertling in order to negotiate an armistice. After long conversations with the Kaiser and evaluations of the political and military situations in the Reich, by 5 October 1918 the German government sent a message to Wilson to negotiate terms on the basis of a recent speech of his and the earlier declared &quot;Fourteen Points&quot;. In the subsequent two exchanges, Wilson&#x27;s allusions &quot;failed to convey the idea that the Kaiser&#x27;s abdication was an essential condition for peace. The leading statesmen of the Reich were not yet ready to contemplate such a monstrous possibility.&quot; As a precondition for negotiations, Wilson demanded the retreat of Germany from all occupied territories, the cessation of submarine activities and the Kaiser&#x27;s abdication, writing on 23 October: &quot;If the Government of the United States must deal with the military masters and the monarchical autocrats of Germany now, or if it is likely to have to deal with them later in regard to the international obligations of the German Empire, it must demand not peace negotiations but surrender.&quot;

In late October 1918, Ludendorff, in a sudden change of mind, declared the conditions of the Allies unacceptable. He now demanded the resumption of the war which he himself had declared lost only one month earlier. By this time however the German Army was suffering from poor morale and desertions were on the increase. The Imperial Government stayed on course and Ludendorff was dismissed from his post by the Kaiser and replaced by Lieutenant General Wilhelm Groener. 

On 3 November 1918, Prince Max, who had been in a coma for 36 hours after an over-dose of sleep-inducing medication taken to help with influenza and only just recovered, discovered that both Turkey and Austria-Hungary had concluded armistices with the Allies. General von Gallwitz had described this eventuality as being &quot;decisive&quot; to the Chancellor in discussions some weeks before, as it would mean that Austrian territory would become a spring-board for an Allied attack on Germany from the south. Revolution broke out across Germany the following day, together with a mutiny in the German High Seas Fleet. On 5 November, the Allies agreed to take up negotiations for a truce, now also demanding reparation payments.

The latest note from Wilson was received in Berlin on 6 November 1918. That same day, the delegation led by Matthias Erzberger departed for France. Aware that the refusal of the Kaiser to abdicate was a sticking-point in negotiations with the Allies as well as an impetus to revolution within Germany, Prince Max on his own authority announced that the Kaiser had abdicated and handed over power to Friedrich Ebert of the Social Democratic Party on 9 November. The same day, Philipp Scheidemann, also a Social Democrat, declared Germany a republic.

Whilst the Germans sought negotiations along the lines of Wilson&#x27;s 14 points, the French, British and Italian governments had no desire to accept them and President Wilson&#x27;s subsequent unilateral promises. For example, they assumed that the de-militarization suggested by Wilson would be limited to the Central Powers. There were also contradictions with their post-War plans that did not include a consistent implementation of the ideal of national self-determination. As Czernin points out:

To address this impasse Wilson suggested that the military chiefs be consulted. Douglas Haig, representing the British forces, urged moderation, stating that &quot;Germany is not broken in the military sense&quot;, that &quot;it is necessary to grant Germany conditions that they can accept&quot;, and that surrender of occupied territories and Alsace-Lorraine would be &quot;sufficient to seal the victory&quot;. The British also took the position that the German army should be kept mobilised as a counter to the spread of communist agitation. Ferdinand Foch, speaking for the French forces, agreed with Haig that the Germans &quot;could undoubtedly take up a new position, and we could not prevent it&quot;, but, contrary to Haig, urged stringent terms including an occupation of the Rhineland with Allied bridgeheads over the Rhine, and the surrender of large quantities of military materiel. General Pershing, commander of the American forces, opposed any armistice being granted to the Germans. The combined effect of this feedback was to nullify Wilson&#x27;s 14 points.

===German Revolution===
The sailors&#x27; revolt that took place during the night of 29 to 30 October 1918 in the port of Wilhelmshaven spread across Germany within days and led to the proclamation of a republic on 9 November and to the announcement of the abdication of Wilhelm II. Workers&#x27; and soldiers&#x27; councils took control in most major cities west of the Elbe, including Berlin, where the new Reich government, the socialist-dominated Council of the People&#x27;s Deputies, had their full support. One of the primary goals of the councils was an immediate end to the war.

Also on 9 November, Max von Baden handed the office of chancellor to Friedrich Ebert, a Social Democrat who the same day became co-chair of the Council of the People&#x27;s Deputies. Two days later, on behalf of the new government, Matthias Erzberger of the Catholic Centre Party signed the armistice at Compiègne. The German High Command pushed the blame for the surrender away from the Army and onto others, including the socialists who were supporting and running the government in Berlin. In the eyes of the German Right, the blame was carried over to the Weimar Republic when it was established in 1919. This resulted in a considerable amount of instability in the new republic.

==Negotiation process==

The Armistice was the result of a hurried and desperate process. The German delegation headed by Erzberger crossed the front line in five cars and was escorted for ten hours across the devastated war zone of Northern France, arriving on the morning of 8 November 1918. They were then taken to the secret destination aboard Foch&#x27;s private train parked in a railway siding in the Forest of Compiègne.

Foch appeared only twice in the three days of negotiations: on the first day, to ask the German delegation what they wanted, and on the last day, to see to the signatures. The Germans were handed the list of Allied demands and given 72 hours to agree. The German delegation discussed the Allied terms not with Foch, but with other French and Allied officers. The Armistice amounted to substantial German demilitarization (see list below), with few promises made by the Allies in return. The naval blockade of Germany was not completely lifted until complete peace terms could be agreed upon.

There were very few negotiations. The Germans were able to correct a few impossible demands (for example, the decommissioning of more submarines than their fleet possessed), extend the schedule for the withdrawal and register their formal protest at the harshness of Allied terms. But they were in no position to refuse to sign. On Sunday, 10 November 1918, the Germans were shown newspapers from Paris to inform them that the Kaiser had abdicated. That same day, Ebert instructed Erzberger to sign. The cabinet had earlier received a message from Paul von Hindenburg, head of the German High Command, requesting that the armistice be signed even if the Allied conditions could not be improved on.

The Armistice was agreed upon at 5:00 a.m. on 11 November 1918, to come into effect at 11:00 a.m. CET, for which reason the occasion is sometimes referred to as &quot;the eleventh hour of the eleventh day of the eleventh month&quot;. Signatures were made, depending on the source of information, between 5:00 a.m. and 5:45 a.m., CET.

===Allied Rhineland occupation===

The occupation of the Rhineland took place following the Armistice. The occupying armies consisted of American, Belgian, British and French forces.

==Prolongation==

*Third prolongation of the armistice (16 February 1919 – 10 January 1920)
**Brussels Agreement, 14 March 1919
Peace was ratified at 4:15 p.m. on 10 January 1920.

==Aftermath==

The British public was notified of the armistice by a subjoined official communiqué issued from the Press Bureau at 10:20 a.m., when British Prime Minister David Lloyd George announced: &quot;The armistice was signed at five o&#x27;clock this morning, and hostilities are to cease on all fronts at 11 a.m. to-day.&quot; An official communique was published by the United States at 2:30 pm: &quot;In accordance with the terms of the Armistice, hostilities on the fronts of the American armies were suspended at eleven o&#x27;clock this morning.&quot;

News of the armistice being signed was officially announced towards 9:00 a.m. in Paris. One hour later, Foch, accompanied by a British admiral, presented himself at the Ministry of War, where he was immediately received by Georges Clemenceau, the Prime Minister of France. At 10:50 a.m., Foch issued this general order: &quot;Hostilities will cease on the whole front as from November 11 at 11 o&#x27;clock [Central European Time]. The Allied troops will not, until further order, go beyond the line reached on that date and at that hour.&quot; Five minutes later, Clemenceau, Foch and the British admiral went to the Élysée Palace. At the first shot fired from the Eiffel Tower, the Ministry of War and the Élysée Palace displayed flags, while bells around Paris rang. Five hundred students gathered in front of the Ministry and called upon Clemenceau, who appeared on the balcony. Clemenceau exclaimed &quot;Vive la France!&quot;the crowd echoed him. At 11:00 a.m., the first peace-gunshot was fired from Fort Mont-Valérien, which told the population of Paris that the armistice was concluded, but the population were already aware of it from official circles and newspapers.

Although the information about the imminent ceasefire had spread among the forces at the front in the hours before, fighting in many sections of the front continued right until the appointed hour. At 11 a.m., there was some spontaneous fraternization between the two sides but in general, reactions were muted. A British corporal reported: &quot;...the Germans came from their trenches, bowed to us and then went away. That was it. There was nothing with which we could celebrate, except cookies.&quot; On the Allied side, euphoria and exultation were rare. There was some cheering and applause, but the dominant feeling was silence and emptiness after 52 exhausting months of war. According to Thomas R. Gowenlock, an intelligence officer with the U.S. First Division, shelling from both sides continued during the rest of the day, ending only at nightfall. 

The peace between the Allies and Germany was subsequently settled in 1919, by the Paris Peace Conference and the Treaty of Versailles that same year.

==Last casualties==
Many artillery units continued to fire on German targets to avoid having to haul away their spare ammunition. The Allies also wished to ensure that, should fighting restart, they would be in the most favourable position. Consequently, there were 10,944 casualties, of whom 2,738 men died, on the last day of the war.

An example of the determination of the Allies to maintain pressure until the last minute, but also to adhere strictly to the Armistice terms, was Battery 4 of the US Navy&#x27;s long-range 14-inch railway guns firing its last shot at 10:57:30 a.m. from the Verdun area, timed to land far behind the German front line just before the scheduled Armistice.

Augustin Trébuchon was the last Frenchman to die when he was shot on his way to tell fellow soldiers, who were attempting an assault across the Meuse river, that hot soup would be served after the ceasefire. He was killed at 10:45 a.m.

Marcel Toussaint Terfve was the last Belgian soldier to die as he was mortally wounded from German machine gun fire and died from his lung wound at 10:45 a.m.

Earlier, the last British soldier to die, George Edwin Ellison of the 5th Royal Irish Lancers, was killed that morning at around 9:30 a.m. while scouting on the outskirts of Mons, Belgium.

The final Canadian, and Commonwealth, soldier to die, Private George Lawrence Price, was shot and killed by a sniper while part of a force advancing into the Belgian town of Ville-sur-Haine just two minutes before the armistice to the north of Mons at 10:58 a.m.

Henry Gunther, an American, is generally recognized as the last soldier killed in action in World War I. He was killed 60 seconds before the armistice came into force while charging astonished German troops who were aware the Armistice was nearly upon them. He had been despondent over his recent reduction in rank and was apparently trying to redeem his reputation.

The last German to die in the war, though his name is not fully known, is believed to be a Lieutenant by the name of Tomas. At a time shortly after 11:00 a.m, perhaps 11:01 a.m, he exited his trench and began to walk across no-mans-land to inform the Americans there that the Armistice had just gone into effect, and that his soldiers would soon be evacuating their trenches. The Americans, who had not yet heard news of the armistice, opened fire, killing him instantly.

News of the armistice only reached Germany&#x27;s African forces, still fighting in Northern Rhodesia (today&#x27;s Zambia), about two weeks later. The German and British commanders then had to agree on the protocols for their own armistice ceremony.

After the war, there was a deep shame that so many soldiers died on the final day of the war, especially in the hours after the treaty had been signed but had not yet taken effect. In the United States, Congress opened an investigation to find out why and if blame should be placed on the leaders of the American Expeditionary Forces, including John Pershing. In France, many graves of French soldiers who died on 11 November were backdated to 10 November.

==Legacy==
The celebration of the Armistice became the centrepiece of memories of the war, along with salutes to the unknown soldier. Nations built monuments to the dead and the heroic soldiers, but seldom aggrandizing the generals and admirals. 11 November is commemorated annually in many countries under various names such as Armistice Day, Remembrance Day, Veterans Day, and in Poland, it is Independence Day.

During World War II, after German success in the Battle of France, Adolf Hitler arranged that negotiations for an end of hostilities with France would take place at Compiègne in the same rail car as the 1918 conference. The Armistice of 22 June 1940 was portrayed as revenge for Germany&#x27;s earlier defeat, and the Glade of the Armistice was mostly destroyed.

The end of the Second World War in China (end of the Second Sino-Japanese War) formally took place on 9 September 1945 at 9:00 a.m. (the ninth hour of the ninth day of the ninth month). The date was chosen to echo the 1918 Armistice (on the eleventh hour of the eleventh day of the eleventh month), and because &quot;nine&quot; is a homophone of the word for &quot;long lasting&quot; in Chinese (to suggest that the peace won would last forever).

==Stab-in-the-back myth==
In November 1918, the Allies had ample supplies of manpower and materiel to invade Germany. Additionally, with the fall of Austria-Hungary, an offensive was being prepared across the Alps towards Munich, Poland was in turmoil, and an air-offensive was being planned by the Independent Air Force under Trenchard against Berlin. Yet at the time of the armistice, the Western Front was still some from Berlin, and the Kaiser&#x27;s armies had retreated from the battlefield in good order. These factors enabled Hindenburg and other senior German leaders to spread the story that their armies had not really been defeated. This resulted in the stab-in-the-back myth, which attributed Germany&#x27;s defeat not to its inability to continue fighting (even though up to a million soldiers were suffering from the 1918 flu pandemic and unfit to fight), but to the public&#x27;s failure to respond to its &quot;patriotic calling&quot; and the supposed sabotage of the war effort, particularly by Jews, Socialists, and Bolsheviks.
The myth that the German Army was &quot;stabbed in the back&quot; by the Social Democratic government was further pushed by reviews in the German press that grossly misrepresented British Major General Frederick Maurice&#x27;s book, &quot;The Last Four Months&quot;. &quot;Ludendorff made use of the reviews to convince Hindenburg.&quot;

<text>Derek Paravicini (born 26 July 1979) is an English savant pianist. He resides in London.

==Biography==
On 26 July 1979, Paravicini was born at the Royal Berkshire Hospital in Reading, He was born extremely prematurely, at 25 weeks, along with a twin sister who did not survive birth. He was blinded by an overdose of oxygen therapy given during his time in a neonatal intensive care unit. This also affected his developing brain, resulting in him having a severe learning disability. He also is considered to be on the autism spectrum.

Paravicini has absolute pitch and can play any piece of music after hearing it once . He began playing the piano at the age of two when his nanny gave him an old keyboard. His parents arranged for him to attend the Linden Lodge School for the Blind in London. On his introductory visit to the school, in the music room he broke free from his parents, then headed straight for a piano being played. He pushed the player aside to take over. The player encouraged him and arranged first weekly and then daily lessons. At age seven, Paravicini gave his first concert, at Tooting Leisure Centre in South London.

In 1989, at the age of nine, Paravicini had his first major public concert at the Barbican Hall in London where he played with the Royal Philharmonic Pops Orchestra. In that year, he appeared on &quot;Wogan&quot; and was the main subject of a documentary called &quot;Musical Savants&quot;.

When he was older, he was presented with a Barnardo&#x27;s Children&#x27;s Champion Award by Diana, Princess of Wales, for his performances at age seven and nine. More opportunities followed, including playing at Ronnie Scott&#x27;s Jazz Club.

Paravicini&#x27;s first album &quot;Echoes of the Sounds to Be&quot; was released on 27 September 2006. His official biography, &quot;In the Key of Genius&quot; by Adam Ockelford, was published in the UK by Hutchinson () on 3 May 2007.

===Notable features and performances===
Paravicini has appeared on various television programmes. He was featured on an episode of Channel 5&#x27;s &quot;Extraordinary People,&quot; in an episode titled &quot;The Musical Genius.&quot; This showed his journey to Las Vegas to play in a charity concert with another savant, Rex Lewis-Clack. He was interviewed twice by Lesley Stahl for &quot;60 Minutes&quot;. In 2009, he was one of the subjects of the NOVA series&#x27; episode &quot;Musical Minds&quot;, featuring neurologist Oliver Sacks, on PBS. He was featured a second time by &quot;60 Minutes&quot; on 14 March 2010. In 2009, he performed for the former Chancellor Alistair Darling, and unexpectedly played &quot;Big Spender&quot;.

On 26 August 2010, Paravicini was featured on the History Channel&#x27;s &quot;Stan Lee&#x27;s Superhumans&quot;. On the show, he was subjected to testing which verified his savantism and musical ability. After Paravicini improvised at two pianos with the composer Matthew King for a radio programme made for BBC Radio 4, they collaborated on a new piano concerto entitled &quot;Blue.&quot; It was first performed in September 2011 by the Orchestra of St John&#x27;s in the Queen Elizabeth Hall, London. This is believed to be the first work for piano and orchestra ever composed for someone with learning disabilities. It was the subject of a feature on BBC News in September 2011.

On 9 March 2013, Paravicini appeared with Adam Ockelford at TEDxWarwick. During the talk, Ockelford discussed Paravicini&#x27;s amazing musical abilities, while Paravicini demonstrated them.

On 27 December 2017, Paravicini was featured on an episode of &quot;Mind Field&quot; with Michael Stevens. The episode explored his musical ability and the science of the mind of a savant.

==Family==
Paravicini is the son of Nicolas Vincent Somerset Paravicini and Mary Ann Parker Bowles, sister of Andrew Parker Bowles. Paravicini&#x27;s aunt by marriage was Camilla Shand, who later became queen consort of the United Kingdom. He is the grandson of Vincent Rudolph Paravicini and his wife Elizabeth Hope, Baroness Glendevon (&quot;née&quot; Maugham), a great-grandson of author W. Somerset Maugham and great-great-grandson of Thomas John Barnardo. His stepmother is Susan Rose &quot;Sukie&quot; Phipps (born 1941), who was brought up by Fitzroy Maclean, one of the models for James Bond. His cousins include food writer Tom Parker Bowles and Laura Lopes, the children of Queen Camilla and her ex-husband.

After Paravicini&#x27;s parents divorced, there were legal questions raised about his care. On 13 May 2010, Paravicini made legal history when the United Kingdom&#x27;s last remaining secret court was opened for the first time to discuss his future care. The Court of Protection, which controls the future of adults incapable of managing their own affairs, appointed Paravicini&#x27;s family to look after his welfare and commercial future. Until that legal decision was made, the Official Solicitor from the Ministry of Justice had been looking after his affairs.

<text>A ; ) is a noun that appears only in the plural form and does not have a singular variant for referring to a single object. In a less strict usage of the term, it can also refer to nouns whose singular form is rarely used.

In English, are often words that denote objects that occur or function as pairs or sets, such as spectacles, trousers, pants, scissors, clothes, or genitals. Other examples are for collections that, like alms, cannot conceivably be singular. Other examples include , jeans, outskirts, odds, riches, gallows (although later treated as singular), surroundings, thanks, and heroics.

In some languages, refer to points or periods of time (for example, Latin &#x27;calends, the first day of the month&#x27;, German &#x27;vacation, holiday&#x27;), or to events (for example, Finnish &#x27;wedding&#x27;), or to liquids (for example, Hebrew () and Chichewa , both &#x27;water&#x27;).

A bilingual example is the Latin word that was brought into English; when referring to the symbol of authority, it is a noun in both languages.

==English usage==

In English, some nouns have a singular form used only attributively. Phrases such as &quot;trouser press&quot; and &quot;scissor kick&quot; contain the singular form, but it is considered nonstandard to say &quot;a trouser&quot; or &quot;a scissor&quot; on its own (though in the fashion and tailoring industries use of &quot;trouser&quot; in the singular to refer to a particular style occurs). That accords with the strong preference for singular nouns in attributive positions in English, but some words are used in the plural form even as attributive nouns, such as &quot;clothes peg&quot;, &quot;glasses case&quot; – notwithstanding &quot;spectacle case&quot; and &quot;eyeglass case&quot;.

In English, a word may have many definitions only some of which are &quot;pluralia tantum&quot;. The word &quot;glasses&quot; (a set of corrective lenses to improve eyesight) is &quot;plurale tantum&quot;. In contrast, the word &quot;glass&quot;—either a container for drinks (a count noun) or a vitreous substance (a mass noun)—may be singular or plural. Some words, such as &quot;brain&quot; and &quot;intestine&quot;, can be used as either &quot;plurale tantum&quot; nouns or count nouns.

==&quot;Singulare tantum&quot;==
The term for a noun that appears only in the singular form is (: ), such as the English words: information, dust, and wealth. is defined by the &quot;Shorter Oxford English Dictionary&quot; as &quot;&quot;Gram&quot;. A word having only a singular form; &quot;esp.&quot; a non-count noun.&quot; Such nouns may refer to a unique singular object (essentially a proper noun), but more often than not, they refer to uncountable nouns, either mass nouns (referring to a substance that cannot be counted as distinct objects, such as &#x27;milk&#x27;) or collective nouns (referring to objects that may in principle be counted but are referred to as one, such as &#x27;popcorn&#x27; or Arabic , , &#x27;mulberry&#x27;). Given that they do not have a number distinction, they may appear as in one language but as in another. Compare English &quot;water&quot; to the Hebrew , ().

In English, such words are almost always mass nouns. Some uncountable nouns can be alternatively used as count nouns when meaning &quot;a type of&quot;, and the plural means &quot;more than one type of&quot;. For example, &quot;strength&quot; is uncountable in &quot;Strength is power&quot;, but it can be used as a countable noun to mean an &quot;instance&quot; of [a &quot;kind&quot; of] strength, as in &quot;My strengths are in physics and chemistry.&quot; Some words, especially proper nouns such as the name of an individual, are nearly always in the singular form because there is only one example of what that noun means. Others like &quot;nothingness&quot; or &quot;emptiness&quot; refer to logical states of absence that can&#x27;t sensibly be quantified at all, hence are not usefully &quot;mass nouns&quot; but are still Singularia Tantum.

==Usage in other languages==
&quot;Pluralia tantum&quot; vary arbitrarily between languages. For example, in Swedish, a pair of scissors is just (), not a . Similarly, in French, a pair of trousers is , while in Spanish (singular) and (plural) are both valid ways to refer to a single garment. Additionally, in German, the term &quot;Jeans&quot; which is borrowed from the English, is rendered singular feminine as in accordance with the singular feminine word meaning &quot;trousers&quot;.

In some other languages, rather than quantifying a noun with a measure word, special numeral forms are used in such cases. In Polish, for example, &quot;one pair of eyeglasses&quot; is expressed as either (one-&quot;plural&quot; glasses-&quot;plural&quot;) or (one-&quot;singular&quot; pair-&quot;singular&quot; glasses-&quot;genitive plural&quot;). For larger quantities, &quot;collective numeral&quot; forms are available: (three doors), (five violins). Compare them to the ordinary numeral forms found in Polish: (three films/five films)

The Russian (, &#x27;money&#x27;) originally had a singular, (), which meant a copper coin worth half a kopeck.

The Yiddish word is a well known example of a that is also plural only in other languages into which it is borrowed, &#x27;one of the kreplach&#x27; would be ().

The Welsh , &#x27;heaven&#x27;, is the plural of , which is no longer part of the spoken language. is now used with the singular meaning of &#x27;heaven&#x27; and plural of &#x27;heavens&#x27;.

<text>is a Japanese composer. He is the son of Japanese author and Nobel Prize laureate Kenzaburō Ōe and Yukari Ikeuchi, and the nephew of director Juzo Itami.

==Biography==
Hikari Ōe was born autistic and developmentally disabled. Doctors tried to convince his parents to let their son die, but they refused to do so. Even after an operation, Ōe remained visually impaired, developmentally delayed, epileptic and with limited physical coordination. He does not speak much.

Ōe&#x27;s parents report that his first response to a particular sound was when he was watching TV with his parents, and there was the sound of a bird singing, which he responded to. His parents were fascinated. They bought him a record with tracks of bird calls, in which a woman would say the name of each bird before the song of the bird would play. He listened to this record. Walking with his parents near their vacation home one day, they heard a bird singing, and he then imitated the voice of the woman who presented the bird songs in his child&#x27;s records. This was how they got the idea to recruit a music teacher for Ōe. His parents arranged a piano teacher, Kumiko Tamura, for him. Instead of speaking, Ōe began to express his feelings in music and through musical composition. Eventually he was taught musical notation.

As an adult, Hikari creates chamber music. Hikari&#x27;s first CD sold more than one million copies in the first few years of release.

==Hikari reflected in the works of the Nobel laureate ==
Kenzaburō Ōe credited his son for influencing his literary career. Kenzaburō tried to give his son a &quot;voice&quot; through his writing. Several of Kenzaburō&#x27;s books feature a character based on his son.

In 1994, Kenzaburō won the Nobel Prize in Literature, in part because of his 1964 book, &quot;A Personal Matter,&quot; in which the writer describes his pain in accepting the brain-damaged child into his life, and of how he arrived at his resolve to live with his son. Hikari figures prominently in many of the books singled out for praise by the Nobel committee:

* &quot;A Personal Matter&quot; is the first of a series of works which describe aspects of Hikari&#x27;s life.

* &quot;Teach Us to Outgrow Our Madness&quot; in 1969 provides insight into the life of a family with an unspeaking infant child.
* &quot;My Deluged Soul&quot; in 1973 describes a father&#x27;s difficulties in relating to an infant child who, through the medium of the songs of the wild birds, slowly started to communicate with his family.
* &quot;Rouse Up O Young Men of the New Age!&quot; in 1983 describes Hikari&#x27;s development from a child to a young man.

Hikari&#x27;s life is the core of the first book published after Kenzaburō was awarded the Nobel Prize. This 1996 book, &quot;A Healing Family,&quot; celebrates the small victories in Hikari&#x27;s life.

==Selected works==
Ōe&#x27;s published works have no linguistic content. His music and music scores encompass 12 works in 30 publications in 5 languages and 1,721 library holdings.

<text>Anthony Thomas &quot;Tony&quot; DeBlois is a blind American autistic savant and musician.

==Early life==
Tony DeBlois was born on January 22, 1974. Weighing less than two pounds, he was premature and had to be supplied with large amounts of oxygen. Large amounts of oxygen cause blindness, and the physicians during this time were unaware of this. Consequently, Tony became blind at just a few days old. He began to play piano at the age of two. At first, DeBlois studied in the Texas School for the Blind in Austin, Texas, then the Perkins School for the Blind in Boston, Massachusetts, but in 1989 was awarded a summer scholarship at Berklee College of Music in Boston, Massachusetts. Later, he was admitted as a full-time student and graduated magna cum laude in 1996.

==Career==
DeBlois specializes in jazz but can play just about any other type of music as well. A savant, he plays 20 musical instruments and has held concerts worldwide but also has his own band, Goodnuf. He can play about 8,000 pieces from memory.

A TV movie was made on Tony DeBlois&#x27; life, entitled &quot;Journey of the Heart&quot; (1997) starring Cybill Shepherd as Janice DeBlois, Jeremy Lelliott / Chris Demetral (as young Tony), Blake Heron as Tony&#x27;s younger brother Ray, and with an appearance of Tony DeBlois himself playing piano at the end of the movie. It was produced by Ronnie D. Clemmer and Richard P. Kughn.

<text>The Fauna of British India (short title) with long titles including The Fauna of British India, Including Ceylon and Burma, and The Fauna of British India Including the Remainder of the Oriental Region is a series of scientific books that was published by the British government in India and printed by Taylor and Francis of London. The series was started sometime in 1881 after a letter had been sent to the Secretary of State for India signed by Charles Darwin, Sir Joseph Dalton Hooker and other &quot;eminent men of science&quot; forwarded by P.L.Sclater to R.H. Hobart. W. T. Blanford was appointed editor and began work on the volume on mammals.

In the volume on the mammals, Blanford notes:
The idea was to cover initially the vertebrates, taking seven volumes, and this was followed by a proposal to cover the invertebrates in about 15 to 20 volumes and projected to cost £11,250 to £15,000. Blanford suggested that restricting it to 14 volumes would make it possible to limit the cost to £10,500. After Blanford&#x27;s death, Arthur Everett Shipley became the editor. The first series was followed by a second edition of some of the volumes such as the mammals, birds, reptiles and butterflies. In 1922-23, Nelson Annandale sought to move the process of preparation of the books and its publication to India. The second edition is sometimes called the &quot;new fauna&quot;. There were changes incorporated in this that included for instance the usage of trinomials for the birds. Following Shipley&#x27;s death in 1927, Lieutenant Colonel John Stephenson, formerly of the Indian Medical Service was appointed editor in May 1928. Publication was stopped during the Second World War. After Indian Independence in 1947 a few volumes were published under the new name of Fauna of India but some of the volumes that were under preparation were never published. The 1953 volume on polychaetes by Pierre Fauvel was published by the Indian Press from Allahabad.

<text>Nash Mills is a civil parish within Hemel Hempstead and Dacorum Borough Council on the northern side of the Grand Union Canal, formerly the River Gade, and in the southernmost corner of Hemel Hempstead. There is evidence of a mill in this location since the 11th century and the row of 16th century mill cottages still remain. John Dickinson established a number of papermaking mills in the area in the 19th century (Nash Mill).

The parish of Nash Mills was created in 1974 from that part of the parish of Abbots Langley within the designated area of Hemel Hempstead New Town. The parish was enlarged in 1985. The borough council ward extends beyond the parish boundary.

==The Mill==

A corn-mill in the area was recorded in the Domesday Book in the 11th century; it subsequently belonged, in the Middle Ages, to the Abbey of St Albans. The mill had been converted to papermaking in the late 18th century and subsequently purchased in 1811 by John Dickinson and George Longman.

Nash Mill was renowned for its production of tough thin paper for Samuel Bagster&#x27;s &quot;Pocket Reference Bible&quot;. A major fire in 1813 was a setback, but the insurance enabled redevelopment for large scale production. After an experiment in 1887, fine rag paper was produced on electrically driven machines: a successful innovation at Nash Mill.

In 1989, Nash Mill was sold to the international Sappi Group and continued to make paper until 2006, when it was closed down and sold. Redevelopment plans for housing were publicised in September 2007. By late 2010, the Mill site had been largely cleared, leaving the mill house, Stephenson&#x27;s Cottage and the war memorial.

==Local history==
John Dickinson had Nash Mills School built in 1847.

==Governance==
The Nash Mills area was part of the parish of Abbots Langley until 1974. This northern section of Abbots Langley parish was included within the designated area of Hemel Hempstead New Town in 1947. Under the Local Government Act 1972 the parish of Abbots Langley was split, with the part within Hemel Hempstead New Town becoming the parish of Nash Mills in the new district of Dacorum, and the rest of Abbots Langley parish becoming part of the new district of Three Rivers. A shadow parish council for Nash Mills was elected in 1973 ahead of the boundary changes coming into effect on 1 April 1974.

Nash Mills parish was enlarged on 1 April 1985, gaining an area along the River Gade and Grand Union Canal from Abbots Langley parish. The West Coast Main Line railway passes through the western edge of the parish between Kings Langley and Apsley stations. An original skew bridge, built in 1837 and Grade II listed, carries it over the canal, which marks the border with Abbots Langley.

<text>Annette Mairi Nelson Ferguson FRSE is a Scottish observational astrophysicist who specialises in the area of galaxy evolution. She is a professor at the Institute for Astronomy, Edinburgh, and holds the Personal Chair in Observational Astrophysics at the School of Physics and Astronomy, University of Edinburgh.

== Career ==
Ferguson&#x27;s research focuses on conducting observations of stars and interstellar gas in nearby galaxies to gain insights into the formation and evolution of systems in the Milky Way. Much of her recent work has focused on the Andromeda Galaxy, a giant spiral galaxy in our galactic neighbourhood.

Her research exploits ground-based telescopes in the Canary Islands, Chile, and Hawaii as well as sophisticated instruments on board the Hubble Space Telescope. Ferguson is also involved in planning for future exploitation of data collected by the European Space Agency&#x27;s Euclid mission, and the Vera C. Rubin Observatory, which is currently under construction in Chile.

Originally from Scotland, Ferguson graduated with a BSc with Distinction in Physics and Astronomy from the University of Toronto, and obtained a PhD in Astrophysics from the Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore.

She has previously held postdoctoral fellowships at the Institute of Astronomy, Cambridge, the Kapteyn Astronomical Institute in Groningen, Netherlands, and was a Marie Curie postdoctoral fellow at the Max-Planck-Institut für Astrophysik in Garching, Germany.

Ferguson returned to Scotland in 2005, taking up a Lectureship at The University of Edinburgh, before being promoted to a Readership in 2007, and a Professorship in 2013.

== Honours ==
Ferguson received the Annie J. Cannon Award in 2003, and was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh, Scotland&#x27;s National Academy for Science and Letters, in March 2016. In 2017 she received the Friedrich Wilhelm Bessel Research Award from the Alexander von Humboldt Foundation.

<doc id="763553" wikidata="Q1056935" url="?curid=763553" title="Lunar space elevator">
<text>A lunar space elevator or lunar spacelift is a proposed transportation system for moving a mechanical climbing vehicle up and down a ribbon-shaped tethered cable that is set between the surface of the Moon &quot;at the bottom&quot; and a docking port suspended tens of thousands of kilometers above in space at the top.

It is similar in concept to the better known Earth-based space elevator idea, but since the Moon&#x27;s surface gravity is much lower than the Earth&#x27;s, the engineering requirements for constructing a lunar elevator system can be met using materials and technology already available. For a lunar elevator, the cable or tether extends considerably farther out from the lunar surface into space than one that would be used in an Earth-based system. However, the main function of a space elevator system is the same in either case; both allow for a reusable, controlled means of transporting payloads of cargo, or possibly people, between a base station at the bottom of a gravity well and a docking port in outer space.

A lunar elevator could significantly reduce the costs and improve reliability of soft-landing equipment on the lunar surface. For example, it would permit the use of mass-efficient (high specific impulse), low thrust drives such as ion drives which otherwise cannot land on the Moon. Since the docking port would be connected to the cable in a microgravity environment, these and other drives can reach the cable from low Earth orbit (LEO) with minimal launched fuel from Earth. With conventional rockets, the fuel needed to reach the lunar surface from LEO is many times the landed mass, thus the elevator can reduce launch costs for payloads bound for the lunar surface by a similar factor.

==Location==
There are two points in space where an elevator&#x27;s docking port could maintain a stable, lunar-synchronous position: the Earth-Moon Lagrange points and . The 0.055 eccentricity of the lunar orbit means that these points are not fixed relative to the lunar surface : the is 56,315 km +/- 3,183 km away from the Earth-facing side of the Moon (at the lunar equator) and is 62,851 km +/- 3,539 km from the center of the Moon&#x27;s far side, in the opposite direction. At these points, the effect of the Moon&#x27;s gravity and the effect of the centrifugal force resulting from the elevator system&#x27;s synchronous, rigid body rotation cancel each other out. The Lagrangian points and are points of unstable gravitational equilibrium, meaning that small inertial adjustments will be needed to ensure any object positioned there can remain stationary relative to the lunar surface.

Both of these positions are substantially farther up than the 36,000 km from Earth to geostationary orbit. Furthermore, the weight of the limb of the cable system extending down to the Moon would have to be balanced by the cable extending further up, and the Moon&#x27;s slow rotation means the upper limb would have to be much longer than for an Earth-based system, or be topped by a much more massive counterweight. To suspend a kilogram of cable or payload just above the surface of the Moon would require 1,000 kg of counterweight, 26,000 km beyond . (A smaller counterweight on a longer cable, e.g., 100 kg at a distance of 230,000 km — more than halfway to Earth — would have the same balancing effect.) Without the Earth&#x27;s gravity to attract it, an cable&#x27;s lowest kilogram would require 1,000 kg of counterweight at a distance of 120,000 km from the Moon. The average Earth-Moon distance is 384,400 km.

The anchor point of a space elevator is normally considered to be at the equator. However, there are several possible cases to be made for locating a lunar base at one of the Moon&#x27;s poles; a base on a peak of eternal light could take advantage of near-continuous solar power, for example, or small quantities of water and other volatiles may be trapped in permanently shaded crater bottoms. A space elevator could be anchored near a lunar pole, though not directly at it. A tramway could be used to bring the cable the rest of the way to the pole, with the Moon&#x27;s low gravity allowing much taller support towers and wider spans between them than would be possible on Earth.

==Fabrication==
Because of the Moon&#x27;s lower gravity and lack of atmosphere, a lunar elevator would have less stringent requirements for the tensile strength of the material making up its cable than an Earth-tethered cable. An Earth-based elevator would require high strength-to-weight materials that are theoretically possible, but not yet fabricated in practice (e.g., carbon nanotubes). A lunar elevator, however, could be constructed using commercially available mass-produced high-strength para-aramid fibres (such as Kevlar and M5) or ultra-high-molecular-weight polyethylene fibre.

Compared to an Earth space elevator, there would be fewer geographic and political restrictions on the location of the surface connection. The connection point of a lunar elevator would not necessarily have to be directly under its center of gravity, and could even be near the poles, where evidence suggests there might be frozen water in deep craters that never see sunlight; if so, this might be collected and converted into rocket fuel.

==Cross-section profile==
Space elevator designs for Earth typically have a taper of the tether that provides a uniform stress profile rather than a uniform cross-section. Because the strength requirement of a lunar space elevator is much lower than that of an Earth space elevator, a uniform cross-section is possible for the lunar space elevator. The study done for NASA&#x27;s Institute of Advanced Concepts states &quot;Current composites have characteristic heights of a few hundred kilometers, which would require taper ratios of about 6 for Mars, 4 for the Moon, and about 6000 for the Earth. The mass of the Moon is small enough that a uniform cross-section lunar space elevator could be constructed, without any taper at all.&quot; A uniform cross-section could make it possible for a lunar space elevator to be built in a double-tether pulley configuration. This configuration would greatly simplify repairs of a space elevator compared to a tapered elevator configuration. However a pulley configuration would require a strut at the counterweight hundreds of kilometers long to separate the up-tether from the down-tether and keep them from tangling. A pulley configuration might also allow the system capacity to be gradually expanded by stitching new tether material on at the Lagrange point as the tether rotated.

==History==
The idea of space elevators has been around since 1960 when Yuri Artsutanov wrote a Sunday supplement to &quot;Pravda&quot; on how to build such a structure and the utility of geosynchronous orbit. His article however, was not known in the West. 
Then in 1966, John Isaacs, a leader of a group of American Oceanographers at Scripps Institute, published an article in &quot;Science&quot; about the concept of using thin wires hanging from a geostationary satellite. In that concept, the wires were to be thin (thin wires/tethers are now understood to be more susceptible to micrometeoroid damage). Like Artsutanov, Isaacs’ article also was not well known to the aerospace community.

In 1972, James Cline submitted a paper to NASA describing a &quot;mooncable&quot; concept similar to a lunar elevator. NASA responded negatively to the idea citing technical risk and lack of funds.

In 1975, Jerome Pearson independently came up with the Space elevator concept and published it in &quot;Acta Astronautica&quot;. That made the aerospace community at large aware of the space elevator for the first time. His article inspired Sir Arthur Clarke to write the novel &quot;The Fountains of Paradise&quot; (published in 1979, almost simultaneously with Charles Sheffield&#x27;s novel on the same topic, &quot;The Web Between the Worlds&quot;). In 1978 Pearson extended his theory to the moon and changed to using the Lagrangian points instead of having it in geostationary orbit.

In 1977, some papers of Soviet space pioneer Friedrich Zander were posthumously published, revealing that he conceived of a lunar space tower in 1910.

In 2005 Jerome Pearson completed a study for NASA Institute of Advanced Concepts which showed the concept is technically feasible within the prevailing state of the art using existing commercially available materials.

In October 2011 on the LiftPort website Michael Laine announced that LiftPort is pursuing a Lunar space elevator as an interim goal before attempting a terrestrial elevator. At the 2011 Annual Meeting of the Lunar Exploration Analysis Group (LEAG), LiftPort CTO Marshall Eubanks presented a paper on the prototype Lunar Elevator co-authored by Laine. In August 2012, Liftport announced that the project could actually start near 2020. In April 2019, LiftPort CEO Michael Laine reported no progress beyond the lunar elevator company&#x27;s conceptualized design.

==Materials==
Unlike earth-anchored space elevators, the materials for lunar space elevators will not require a lot of strength. Lunar elevators can be made with materials available today. Carbon nanotubes aren’t required to build the structure. This would make it possible to build the elevator much sooner, since available carbon nanotube materials in sufficient quantities are still years away.

One material that has great potential is M5 fiber. This is a synthetic fiber that is lighter than Kevlar or Spectra. According to Pearson, Levin, Oldson, and Wykes in their article The Lunar Space Elevator, an M5 ribbon 30 mm wide and 0.023 mm thick, would be able to support 2000 kg on the lunar surface (2005). It would also be able to hold 100 cargo vehicles, each with a mass of 580 kg, evenly spaced along the length of the elevator. Other materials that could be used are T1000G carbon fiber, Spectra 200, Dyneema (used on the YES2 spacecraft), or Zylon. All of these materials have breaking lengths of several hundred kilometers under 1&quot;g&quot;.

The materials will be used to manufacture the ribbon-shaped, tethered cable which will connect from the or balance points to the surface of the moon. The climbing vehicles which will travel the length of these cables in a finished elevator system will not move very fast, thus simplifying some of the challenges of transferring cargo and maintaining structural integrity of the system.
However, any small objects suspended in space for extended periods of time, like the tethered cables would be, are vulnerable to damage by micrometeoroids, so one possible method of improving their survivability would be to design a &quot;multi-ribbon&quot; system instead of just a single-tethered cable. Such a system would have interconnections at regular intervals, so that if one section of ribbon is damaged, parallel sections could carry the load until robotic vehicles could arrive to replace the severed ribbon. The interconnections would be spaced about 100 km apart, which is small enough to allow a robotic climber to carry the mass of the replacement 100 km of ribbon.

==Climbing vehicles==
One method of getting materials needed from the moon into orbit would be the use of robotic climbing vehicles. These vehicles would consist of two large wheels pressing against the ribbons of the elevator to provide enough friction for lift. The climbers could be set for horizontal or vertical ribbons.

The wheels would be driven by electric motors, which would obtain their power from solar energy or beamed energy. The power required to climb the ribbon would depend upon the lunar gravity field, which drops off the first few percent of the distance to . The power that a climber would require to traverse the ribbon drops in proportion to proximity to the point. If a 540 kg climber traveled at a velocity of fifteen meters per second, by the time it was seven percent of the way to the point, the required power would drop to less than a hundred watts, versus 10 kilowatts at the surface.

One problem with using a solar powered vehicle is the lack of sunlight during some parts of the trip. For half of every month, the solar arrays on the lower part of the ribbon would be in the shade. One way to fix this problem would be to launch the vehicle at the base with a certain velocity then at the peak of the trajectory, attach it to the ribbon.

==Possible uses==
Materials from Earth may be sent into orbit and then down to the Moon to be used by lunar bases and installations.

Former U.S. President George W. Bush, in an address about his Vision for Space Exploration, suggested that the Moon may serve as a cost-effective construction, launching and fueling site for future space exploration missions. As President Bush noted, &quot;(Lunar) soil contains raw materials that might be harvested and processed into rocket fuel or breathable air.&quot; For example, the proposed Ares V heavy-lift rocket system could cost-effectively deliver raw materials from Earth to a docking station, (connected to the lunar elevator as a counterweight,) where future spacecraft could be built and launched, while extracted lunar resources could be shipped up from a base on the Moon&#x27;s surface, near the elevator&#x27;s anchoring point. If the elevator was connected somehow to a lunar base built near the Moon&#x27;s north pole, then workers could also mine the water ice which is known to exist there, providing an ample source of readily accessible water for the crew at the elevator&#x27;s docking station. Also, since the total energy needed for transit between the Moon and Mars is considerably less than for between Earth and Mars, this concept could lower some of the engineering obstacles to sending humans to Mars.

The lunar elevator could also be used to transport supplies and materials from the surface of the moon into the Earth&#x27;s orbit and vice versa. According to Jerome Pearson, many of the Moon&#x27;s material resources can be extracted and sent into Earth orbit more easily than if they were launched from the Earth&#x27;s surface. For example, lunar regolith itself could be used as massive material to shield space stations or crewed spacecraft on long missions from solar flares, Van Allen radiation, and other kinds of cosmic radiation. The Moon&#x27;s naturally occurring metals and minerals could be mined and used for construction. Lunar deposits of silicon, which could be used to build solar panels for massive satellite solar power stations, seem particularly promising.

One disadvantage of the lunar elevator is that the speed of the climbing vehicles may be too slow to efficiently serve as a human transportation system. In contrast to an Earth-based elevator, the longer distance from the docking station to the lunar surface would mean that any &quot;elevator car&quot; would need to be able to sustain a crew for several days, even weeks, before it reached its destination.

<text>Cogeneration or combined heat and power (CHP) is the use of a heat engine or power station to generate electricity and useful heat at the same time.

Cogeneration is a more efficient use of fuel or heat, because otherwise-wasted heat from electricity generation is put to some productive use. Combined heat and power (CHP) plants recover otherwise wasted thermal energy for heating. This is also called combined heat and power district heating. Small CHP plants are an example of decentralized energy. By-product heat at moderate temperatures ( can also be used in absorption refrigerators for cooling.

The supply of high-temperature heat first drives a gas or steam turbine-powered generator. The resulting low-temperature waste heat is then used for water or space heating. At smaller scales (typically below 1 MW), a gas engine or diesel engine may be used. Cogeneration is also common with geothermal power plants as they often produce relatively low grade heat. Binary cycles may be necessary to reach acceptable thermal efficiency for electricity generation at all. Cogeneration is less commonly employed in nuclear power plants as NIMBY and safety considerations have often kept them further from population centers than comparable chemical power plants and district heating is less efficient in lower population density areas due to transmission losses.

Cogeneration was practiced in some of the earliest installations of electrical generation. Before central stations distributed power, industries generating their own power used exhaust steam for process heating. Large office and apartment buildings, hotels, and stores commonly generated their own power and used waste steam for building heat. Due to the high cost of early purchased power, these CHP operations continued for many years after utility electricity became available.

==Overview==
Many process industries, such as chemical plants, oil refineries and pulp and paper mills, require large amounts of process heat for such operations as chemical reactors, distillation columns, steam driers and other uses. This heat, which is usually used in the form of steam, can be generated at the typically low pressures used in heating, or can be generated at much higher pressure and passed through a turbine first to generate electricity. In the turbine the steam pressure and temperature is lowered as the internal energy of the steam is converted to work. The lower-pressure steam leaving the turbine can then be used for process heat.

Steam turbines at thermal power stations are normally designed to be fed high-pressure steam, which exits the turbine at a condenser operating a few degrees above ambient temperature and at a few millimeters of mercury absolute pressure. (This is called a &quot;condensing&quot; turbine.) For all practical purposes this steam has negligible useful energy before it is condensed. Steam turbines for cogeneration are designed for &quot;extraction&quot; of some steam at lower pressures after it has passed through a number of turbine stages, with the un-extracted steam going on through the turbine to a condenser. In this case, the extracted steam causes a mechanical power loss in the downstream stages of the turbine. Or they are designed, with or without extraction, for final exhaust at &quot;back pressure&quot; (non-condensing). The extracted or exhaust steam is used for process heating. Steam at ordinary process heating conditions still has a considerable amount of enthalpy that could be used for power generation, so cogeneration has an opportunity cost.

A typical power generation turbine in a paper mill may have extraction pressures of . A typical back pressure may be . In practice these pressures are custom designed for each facility. Conversely, simply generating process steam for industrial purposes instead of high enough pressure to generate power at the top end also has an opportunity cost (See: Steam supply and exhaust conditions). The capital and operating cost of high-pressure boilers, turbines, and generators is substantial. This equipment is normally operated continuously, which usually limits self-generated power to large-scale operations.

A combined cycle (in which several thermodynamic cycles produce electricity), may also be used to extract heat using a heating system as condenser of the power plant&#x27;s bottoming cycle. For example, the RU-25 MHD generator in Moscow heated a boiler for a conventional steam powerplant, whose condensate was then used for space heat. A more modern system might use a gas turbine powered by natural gas, whose exhaust powers a steam plant, whose condensate provides heat. Cogeneration plants based on a combined cycle power unit can have thermal efficiencies above 80%.

The viability of CHP (sometimes termed utilisation factor), especially in smaller CHP installations, depends on a good baseload of operation, both in terms of an on-site (or near site) electrical demand and heat demand. In practice, an exact match between the heat and electricity needs rarely exists. A CHP plant can either meet the need for heat (&quot;heat driven operation&quot;) or be run as a power plant with some use of its waste heat, the latter being less advantageous in terms of its utilisation factor and thus its overall efficiency. The viability can be greatly increased where opportunities for trigeneration exist. In such cases, the heat from the CHP plant is also used as a primary energy source to deliver cooling by means of an absorption chiller.

CHP is most efficient when heat can be used on-site or very close to it. Overall efficiency is reduced when the heat must be transported over longer distances. This requires heavily insulated pipes, which are expensive and inefficient; whereas electricity can be transmitted along a comparatively simple wire, and over much longer distances for the same energy loss.

A car engine becomes a CHP plant in winter when the reject heat is useful for warming the interior of the vehicle. The example illustrates the point that deployment of CHP depends on heat uses in the vicinity of the heat engine.

Thermally enhanced oil recovery (TEOR) plants often produce a substantial amount of excess electricity. After generating electricity, these plants pump leftover steam into heavy oil wells so that the oil will flow more easily, increasing production.

Cogeneration plants are commonly found in district heating systems of cities, central heating systems of larger buildings (e.g. hospitals, hotels, prisons) and are commonly used in the industry in thermal production processes for process water, cooling, steam production or CO2 fertilization.
&quot;Trigeneration&quot; or &quot;combined cooling, heat and power&quot; (&quot;CCHP&quot;) refers to the simultaneous generation of electricity and useful heating and cooling from the combustion of a fuel or a solar heat collector. The terms &quot;cogeneration&quot; and &quot;trigeneration&quot; can also be applied to the power systems simultaneously generating electricity, heat, and industrial chemicals (e.g., syngas). Trigeneration differs from cogeneration in that the waste heat is used for both heating and cooling, typically in an absorption refrigerator. Combined cooling, heat, and power systems can attain higher overall efficiencies than cogeneration or traditional power plants. In the United States, the application of trigeneration in buildings is called building cooling, heating, and power. Heating and cooling output may operate concurrently or alternately depending on need and system construction.

==Types of plants==

Topping cycle plants primarily produce electricity from a steam turbine. Partly expanded steam is then condensed in a heating condensor at a temperature level that is suitable e.g. district heating or water desalination.

Bottoming cycle plants produce high temperature heat for industrial processes, then a waste heat recovery boiler feeds an electrical plant. Bottoming cycle plants are only used in industrial processes that require very high temperatures such as furnaces for glass and metal manufacturing, so they are less common.

Large cogeneration systems provide heating water and power for an industrial site or an entire town. Common CHP plant types are:
* Gas turbine CHP plants using the waste heat in the flue gas of gas turbines. The fuel used is typically natural gas.
* Gas engine CHP plants use a reciprocating gas engine, which is generally more competitive than a gas turbine up to about 5 MW. The gaseous fuel used is normally natural gas. These plants are generally manufactured as fully packaged units that can be installed within a plantroom or external plant compound with simple connections to the site&#x27;s gas supply, electrical distribution network and heating systems. Typical outputs and efficiencies see Typical large example see 
* Biofuel engine CHP plants use an adapted reciprocating gas engine or diesel engine, depending upon which biofuel is being used, and are otherwise very similar in design to a Gas engine CHP plant. The advantage of using a biofuel is one of reduced fossil fuel consumption and thus reduced carbon emissions. These plants are generally manufactured as fully packaged units that can be installed within a plantroom or external plant compound with simple connections to the site&#x27;s electrical distribution and heating systems. Another variant is the wood gasifier CHP plant whereby a wood pellet or wood chip biofuel is gasified in a zero oxygen high temperature environment; the resulting gas is then used to power the gas engine.
* Combined cycle power plants adapted for CHP
* Molten-carbonate fuel cells and solid oxide fuel cells have a hot exhaust, very suitable for heating.
* Steam turbine CHP plants that use the heating system as the steam condenser for the steam turbine
* Nuclear power plants, similar to other steam turbine power plants, can be fitted with extractions in the turbines to bleed partially expanded steam to a heating system. With a heating system temperature of 95 °C it is possible to extract about 10 MW heat for every MW electricity lost. With a temperature of 130 °C the gain is slightly smaller, about 7 MW for every MWe lost. A review of cogeneration options is in Czech research team proposed a &quot;Teplator&quot; system where heat from spent fuel rods is recovered for the purpose of residential heating.

Smaller cogeneration units may use a reciprocating engine or Stirling engine. The heat is removed from the exhaust and radiator. The systems are popular in small sizes because small gas and diesel engines are less expensive than small gas- or oil-fired steam-electric plants.

Some cogeneration plants are fired by biomass, or industrial and municipal solid waste (see incineration). Some CHP plants use waste gas as the fuel for electricity and heat generation. Waste gases can be gas from animal waste, landfill gas, gas from coal mines, sewage gas, and combustible industrial waste gas.

Some cogeneration plants combine gas and solar photovoltaic generation to further improve technical and environmental performance. Such hybrid systems can be scaled down to the building level and even individual homes.

===MicroCHP===
Micro combined heat and power or &#x27;Micro cogeneration&quot; is a so-called distributed energy resource (DER). The installation is usually less than 5 kWe in a house or small business. Instead of burning fuel to merely heat space or water, some of the energy is converted to electricity in addition to heat. This electricity can be used within the home or business or, if permitted by the grid management, sold back into the electric power grid.

Delta-ee consultants stated in 2013 that with 64% of global sales the fuel cell micro-combined heat and power passed the conventional systems in sales in 2012. 20,000 units were sold in Japan in 2012 overall within the Ene Farm project. With a Lifetime of around 60,000 hours. For PEM fuel cell units, which shut down at night, this equates to an estimated lifetime of between ten and fifteen years. For a price of $22,600 before installation. For 2013 a state subsidy for 50,000 units is in place.

MicroCHP installations use five different technologies: microturbines, internal combustion engines, stirling engines, closed-cycle steam engines, and fuel cells. One author indicated in 2008 that MicroCHP based on Stirling engines is the most cost-effective of the so-called microgeneration technologies in abating carbon emissions. A 2013 UK report from Ecuity Consulting stated that MCHP is the most cost-effective method of using gas to generate energy at the domestic level. However, advances in reciprocation engine technology are adding efficiency to CHP plants, particularly in the biogas field. As both MiniCHP and CHP have been shown to reduce emissions they could play a large role in the field of CO2 reduction from buildings, where more than 14% of emissions can be saved using CHP in buildings. The University of Cambridge reported a cost-effective steam engine MicroCHP prototype in 2017 which has the potential to be commercially competitive in the following decades. Quite recently, in some private homes, fuel cell micro-CHP plants can now be found, which can operate on hydrogen, or other fuels as natural gas or LPG. When running on natural gas, it relies on steam reforming of natural gas to convert the natural gas to hydrogen prior to use in the fuel cell. This hence still emits (see reaction) but (temporarily) running on this can be a good solution until the point where the hydrogen is starting to be distributed through the (natural gas) piping system.

Another MicroCHP example is a natural gas or propane fueled Electricity Producing Condensing Furnace. It combines the fuel saving technique of cogeneration meaning producing electric power and useful heat from a single source of combustion. The condensing furnace is a forced-air gas system with a secondary heat exchanger that allows heat to be extracted from combustion products down to the ambient temperature along with recovering heat from the water vapor. The chimney is replaced by a water drain and vent to the side of the building.

===Trigeneration===

A plant producing electricity, heat and cold is called a trigeneration or polygeneration plant. Cogeneration systems linked to absorption chillers or adsorption chillers use waste heat for refrigeration.

===Combined heat and power district heating===
In the United States, Consolidated Edison distributes 66 billion kilograms of steam each year through its seven cogeneration plants to 100,000 buildings in Manhattan—the biggest steam district in the United States. The peak delivery is 10 million pounds per hour (or approximately 2.5 GW).

===Industrial CHP===
Cogeneration is still common in pulp and paper mills, refineries and chemical plants. In this &quot;industrial cogeneration/CHP&quot;, the heat is typically recovered at higher temperatures (above 100 °C) and used for process steam or drying duties. This is more valuable and flexible than low-grade waste heat, but there is a slight loss of power generation. The increased focus on sustainability has made industrial CHP more attractive, as it substantially reduces carbon footprint compared to generating steam or burning fuel on-site and importing electric power from the grid.

Smaller industrial co-generation units have an output capacity of 5–25 MW and represent a viable off-grid option for a variety of remote applications to reduce carbon emissions.

====Utility pressures versus self generated industrial====
Industrial cogeneration plants normally operate at much lower boiler pressures than utilities. Among the reasons are:
# Cogeneration plants face possible contamination of returned condensate. Because boiler feed water from cogeneration plants has much lower return rates than 100% condensing power plants, industries usually have to treat proportionately more boiler make up water. Boiler feed water must be completely oxygen free and de-mineralized, and the higher the pressure the more critical the level of purity of the feed water.
# Utilities are typically larger scale power than industry, which helps offset the higher capital costs of high pressure.
# Utilities are less likely to have sharp load swings than industrial operations, which deal with shutting down or starting up units that may represent a significant percent of either steam or power demand.

===Heat recovery steam generators===
A heat recovery steam generator (HRSG) is a steam boiler that uses hot exhaust gases from the gas turbines or reciprocating engines in a CHP plant to heat up water and generate steam. The steam, in turn, drives a steam turbine or is used in industrial processes that require heat.

HRSGs used in the CHP industry are distinguished from conventional steam generators by the following main features:
* The HRSG is designed based upon the specific features of the gas turbine or reciprocating engine that it will be coupled to.
* Since the exhaust gas temperature is relatively low, heat transmission is accomplished mainly through convection.
* The exhaust gas velocity is limited by the need to keep head losses down. Thus, the transmission coefficient is low, which calls for a large heating surface area.
* Since the temperature difference between the hot gases and the fluid to be heated (steam or water) is low, and with the heat transmission coefficient being low as well, the evaporator and economizer are designed with plate fin heat exchangers.

==Cogeneration using biomass==

Biomass refers to any plant or animal matter in which it is possible to be reused as a source of heat or electricity, such as sugarcane, vegetable oils, wood, organic waste and residues from the food or agricultural industries. Brazil is now considered a world reference in terms of energy generation from biomass.

A growing sector in the use of biomass for power generation is the sugar and alcohol sector, which mainly uses sugarcane bagasse as fuel for thermal and electric power generation.

===Power cogeneration in the sugar and alcohol sector===

In the sugarcane industry, cogeneration is fueled by the bagasse residue of sugar refining, which is burned to produce steam. Some steam can be sent through a turbine that turns a generator, producing electric power.

Energy cogeneration in sugarcane industries located in Brazil is a practice that has been growing in last years. With the adoption of energy cogeneration in the sugar and alcohol sector, the sugarcane industries are able to supply the electric energy demand needed to operate, and generate a surplus that can be commercialized.

===Advantages of the cogeneration using sugarcane bagasse===

In comparison with the electric power generation by means of fossil fuel-based thermoelectric plants, such as natural gas, the energy generation using sugarcane bagasse has environmental advantages due to the reduction of emissions.

In addition to the environmental advantages, cogeneration using sugarcane bagasse presents advantages in terms of efficiency comparing to thermoelectric generation, through the final destination of the energy produced. While in thermoelectric generation, part of the heat produced is lost, in cogeneration this heat has the possibility of being used in the production processes, increasing the overall efficiency of the process.

===Disadvantages of the cogeneration using sugarcane bagasse===

In sugarcane cultivation, is usually used potassium source&#x27;s containing high concentration of chlorine, such as potassium chloride (KCl). Considering that KCl is applied in huge quantities, sugarcane ends up absorbing high concentrations of chlorine.

Due to this absorption, when the sugarcane bagasse is burned in the power cogeneration, dioxins and methyl chloride ends up being emitted. In the case of dioxins, these substances are considered very toxic and cancerous.

In the case of methyl chloride, when this substance is emitted and reaches the stratosphere, it ends up being very harmful for the ozone layer, since chlorine when combined with the ozone molecule generates a catalytic reaction leading to the breakdown of ozone links.

After each reaction, chlorine starts a destructive cycle with another ozone molecule. In this way, a single chlorine atom can destroy thousands of ozone molecules. As these molecules are being broken, they are unable to absorb the ultraviolet rays. As a result, the UV radiation is more intense on Earth and there is a worsening of global warming.

==Comparison with a heat pump==
A heat pump may be compared with a CHP unit as follows. If, to supply thermal energy, the exhaust steam from the turbo-generator must be taken at a higher temperature than the system would produce most electricity at, the lost electrical generation is &quot;as if&quot; a heat pump were used to provide the same heat by taking electrical power from the generator running at lower output temperature and higher efficiency. Typically for every unit of electrical power lost, then about 6 units of heat are made available at about . Thus CHP has an effective Coefficient of Performance (COP) compared to a heat pump of 6. However, for a remotely operated heat pump, losses in the electrical distribution network would need to be considered, of the order of 6%. Because the losses are proportional to the square of the current, during peak periods losses are much higher than this and it is likely that widespread (i.e. citywide application of heat pumps) would cause overloading of the distribution and transmission grids unless they were substantially reinforced.

It is also possible to run a heat driven operation combined with a heat pump, where the excess electricity (as heat demand is the defining factor on se) is used to drive a heat pump. As heat demand increases, more electricity is generated to drive the heat pump, with the waste heat also heating the heating fluid.

As the efficiency of heat pumps depends on the difference between hot end and cold end temperature (efficiency rises as the difference decreases) it may be worthwhile to combine even relatively low grade waste heat otherwise unsuitable for home heating with heat pumps. For example, a large enough reservoir of cooling water at can significantly improve efficiency of heat pumps drawing from such a reservoir compared to air source heat pumps drawing from cold air during a night. In the summer when there&#x27;s both demand for air conditioning and warm water, the same water may even serve as both a &quot;dump&quot; for the waste heat rejected by a/c units and as a &quot;source&quot; for heat pumps providing warm water. Those considerations are behind what is sometimes called &quot;cold district heating&quot; using a &quot;heat&quot; source whose temperature is well below those usually employed in district heating.

==Distributed generation==
Most industrial countries generate the majority of their electrical power needs in large centralized facilities with capacity for large electrical power output. These plants benefit from economy of scale, but may need to transmit electricity across long distances causing transmission losses. Cogeneration or trigeneration production is subject to limitations in the local demand and thus may sometimes need to reduce (e.g., heat or cooling production to match the demand). An example of cogeneration with trigeneration applications in a major city is the New York City steam system.

==Thermal efficiency==
Every heat engine is subject to the theoretical efficiency limits of the Carnot cycle or subset Rankine cycle in the case of steam turbine power plants or Brayton cycle in gas turbine with steam turbine plants. Most of the efficiency loss with steam power generation is associated with the latent heat of vaporization of steam that is not recovered when a turbine exhausts its low temperature and pressure steam to a condenser. (Typical steam to condenser would be at a few millimeters absolute pressure and on the order of hotter than the cooling water temperature, depending on the condenser capacity.) In cogeneration this steam exits the turbine at a higher temperature where it may be used for process heat, building heat or cooling with an absorption chiller. The majority of this heat is from the latent heat of vaporization when the steam condenses.

Thermal efficiency in a cogeneration system is defined as:

formula_1

Where:
*formula_2 = Thermal efficiency
*formula_3 = Total work output by all systems
*formula_4 = Total heat input into the system

Heat output may also be used for cooling (for example, in summer), thanks to an absorption chiller.
If cooling is achieved in the same time, thermal efficiency in a trigeneration system is defined as:

formula_5

Where:
*formula_2 = Thermal efficiency
*formula_3 = Total work output by all systems
*formula_4 = Total heat input into the system

Typical cogeneration models have losses as in any system. The energy distribution below is represented as a percent of total input energy:
*Electricity = 45%
*Heat + Cooling = 40%
*Heat losses = 13%
*Electrical line losses = 2%

Conventional central coal- or nuclear-powered power stations convert about 33–45% of their input heat to electricity. Brayton cycle power plants operate at up to 60% efficiency. In the case of conventional power plants, approximately 10-15% of this heat is lost up the stack of the boiler. Most of the remaining heat emerges from the turbines as low-grade waste heat with no significant local uses, so it is usually rejected to the environment, typically to cooling water passing through a condenser. Because turbine exhaust is normally just above ambient temperature, some potential power generation is sacrificed in rejecting higher-temperature steam from the turbine for cogeneration purposes.

For cogeneration to be practical power generation and end use of heat must be in relatively close proximity (&lt;2 km typically).
Even though the efficiency of a small distributed electrical generator may be lower than a large central power plant, the use of its waste heat for local heating and cooling can result in an overall use of the primary fuel supply as great as 80%. This provides substantial financial and environmental benefits.

==Costs==

Typically, for a gas-fired plant the fully installed cost per kW electrical is around £400/kW (US$577), which is comparable with large central power stations.

==History==

===Cogeneration in Europe===

The EU has actively incorporated cogeneration into its energy policy via the CHP Directive. In September 2008 at a hearing of the European Parliament&#x27;s Urban Lodgment Intergroup, Energy Commissioner Andris Piebalgs is quoted as saying, “security of supply really starts with energy efficiency.” Energy efficiency and cogeneration are recognized in the opening paragraphs of the European Union&#x27;s Cogeneration Directive 2004/08/EC. This directive intends to support cogeneration and establish a method for calculating cogeneration abilities per country. The development of cogeneration has been very uneven over the years and has been dominated throughout the last decades by national circumstances.

The European Union generates 11% of its electricity using cogeneration. However, there is large difference between Member States with variations of the energy savings between 2% and 60%. Europe has the three countries with the world&#x27;s most intensive cogeneration economies: Denmark, the Netherlands and Finland. Of the 28.46 TWh of electrical power generated by conventional thermal power plants in Finland in 2012, 81.80% was cogeneration.

Other European countries are also making great efforts to increase efficiency. Germany reported that at present, over 50% of the country&#x27;s total electricity demand could be provided through cogeneration. So far, Germany has set the target to double its electricity cogeneration from 12.5% of the country&#x27;s electricity to 25% of the country&#x27;s electricity by 2020 and has passed supporting legislation accordingly. The UK is also actively supporting combined heat and power. In light of UK&#x27;s goal to achieve a 60% reduction in carbon dioxide emissions by 2050, the government has set the target to source at least 15% of its government electricity use from CHP by 2010. Other UK measures to encourage CHP growth are financial incentives, grant support, a greater regulatory framework, and government leadership and partnership.

According to the IEA 2008 modeling of cogeneration expansion for the G8 countries, the expansion of cogeneration in France, Germany, Italy and the UK alone would effectively double the existing primary fuel savings by 2030. This would increase Europe&#x27;s savings from today&#x27;s 155.69 Twh to 465 Twh in 2030. It would also result in a 16% to 29% increase in each country&#x27;s total cogenerated electricity by 2030.

Governments are being assisted in their CHP endeavors by organizations like COGEN Europe who serve as an information hub for the most recent updates within Europe&#x27;s energy policy. COGEN is Europe&#x27;s umbrella organization representing the interests of the cogeneration industry.

The European public–private partnership Fuel Cells and Hydrogen Joint Undertaking Seventh Framework Programme project ene.field deploys in 2017 up 1,000 residential fuel cell Combined Heat and Power (micro-CHP) installations in 12 states. Per 2012 the first 2 installations have taken place.

===Cogeneration in the United Kingdom===
In the United Kingdom, the &quot;Combined Heat and Power Quality Assurance&quot; scheme regulates the combined production of heat and power. It was introduced in 1996. It defines, through calculation of inputs and outputs, &quot;Good Quality CHP&quot; in terms of the achievement of primary energy savings against conventional separate generation of heat and electricity. Compliance with Combined Heat and Power Quality Assurance is required for cogeneration installations to be eligible for government subsidies and tax incentives.

===Cogeneration in the United States===
Perhaps the first modern use of energy recycling was done by Thomas Edison. His 1882 Pearl Street Station, the world&#x27;s first commercial power plant, was a combined heat and power plant, producing both electricity and thermal energy while using waste heat to warm neighboring buildings. Recycling allowed Edison&#x27;s plant to achieve approximately 50 percent efficiency.

By the early 1900s, regulations emerged to promote rural electrification through the construction of centralized plants managed by regional utilities. These regulations not only promoted electrification throughout the countryside, but they also discouraged decentralized power generation, such as cogeneration.

By 1978, Congress recognized that efficiency at central power plants had stagnated and sought to encourage improved efficiency with the Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act (PURPA), which encouraged utilities to buy power from other energy producers.

Cogeneration plants proliferated, soon producing about 8% of all energy in the United States. However, the bill left implementation and enforcement up to individual states, resulting in little or nothing being done in many parts of the country.

The United States Department of Energy has an aggressive goal of having CHP constitute 20% of generation capacity by 2030. Eight Clean Energy Application Centers have been established across the nation. Their mission is to develop the required technology application knowledge and educational infrastructure necessary to lead &quot;clean energy&quot; (combined heat and power, waste heat recovery, and district energy) technologies as viable energy options and reduce any perceived risks associated with their implementation. The focus of the Application Centers is to provide an outreach and technology deployment program for end users, policymakers, utilities, and industry stakeholders.

High electric rates in New England and the Middle Atlantic make these areas of the United States the most beneficial for cogeneration.

<doc id="763567" wikidata="Q1721802" url="?curid=763567" title="Winton, New Zealand">
<text>Winton is a rural town in Southland, New Zealand. It is located close to the east bank of the Ōreti River, 30 kilometres north of Invercargill and 50 kilometres south of Lumsden. The town is named after Thomas Winton, a local stockman who lived and farmed in the area in the 1850s. The district thrived with the development of sheep and fat-lamb farms in the early 1900s. Later, dairy farming became the staple economy, although the town has also seen sawmills, and flax and linen-flax industries.

Today, Winton is as an agricultural service town for local farmers and traders and as a stop-off for travellers on the Invercargill–Queenstown highway. Its population is not declining, partly because farmers retire there, attracted by a climate that is warmer, drier and calmer than Invercargill or Southland’s coastal districts. Population increases have also been driven by an influx of dairy workers who have migrated with their families from countries such as the Philippines and the Netherlands. Local businesses, worship centres and schools have welcomed the new community members.

==History==
Winton was formerly a railway junction but is no longer served by any trains. On 22 February 1871, a railway line from Invercargill was opened to Winton, built to the international standard gauge of 1,435mm. This was the furthest extent of Southland&#x27;s standard gauge network, and the next section to Caroline was built to New Zealand&#x27;s national track gauge, narrow gauge railway. This extension opened on 20 October 1875, ending Winton&#x27;s 4.5 years as a railway terminus, and two months later, the line back to Invercargill was converted to 1,067mm gauge. This line grew to be the Kingston Branch. In 1883, a bush tramway was built eastwards from Winton, and in the 1890s, it was rebuilt to railway standards as a branch line and opened as the Hedgehope Branch on 17 July 1899. It established Winton as a railway junction, and the town functioned in this capacity until 1 January 1968, when the Hedgehope Branch closed. The Kingston line, once one of the more important lines in the country, declined during the 1970s, and most of it closed on 13 December 1982, including the portion through Winton. Today, little remains of Winton&#x27;s railway, though its route can be discerned.

<text>, commonly known as Jinbōchō or Jimbōchō, is a district of Chiyoda, Tokyo, Japan. Jimbōchō Book Town is known as Tokyo&#x27;s center of used-book stores and publishing houses, and as a popular antique and curio shopping area.

The center of Jinbōchō is at the crossing of Yasukuni-dōri and Hakusan-dōri, above Jimbōchō Station on the Tokyo Metro Hanzōmon Line, Toei Mita Line and Toei Shinjuku Line. The prestigious Tokyo Book Binding Club and Literature Preservation Society are located in Jinbōchō, and the area is within walking distance of a number of major universities, including Nihon, Senshu, Meiji, Hosei and Juntendo.

Jinbōchō is officially known (in addresses, etc.) as , and is part of the former ward of Kanda.

==History==

Jinbōchō is likely named after a member of the , possibly who lived in the area at the end of the 17th century.

During the late nineteenth century when Japan underwent modernization, foreign studies schools opened in the area, such as Bansho Shirabesho (Institute for Research of Foreign Documents) and Tokyo Gaikokugo Gakko (Tokyo School of Foreign Languages) which would later become the University of Tokyo and Hitotsubashi University. Many bookstores opened in the area, and it became established as a book town. In 1913, a large fire destroyed much of the area. In the wake of the fire, a former teacher named Shigeo Iwanami opened a bookstore in Jinbōchō which eventually grew into today&#x27;s Iwanami Shoten publishing house. In 1923, the Great Kanto Earthquake caused a fire destroying much of the former Kanda-ku including the Jinbocho library and campus of the University of Tokyo, which was subsequently relocated to Bunkyo-ku. Over time, the area became increasingly popular with university students and intellectuals, and many more small bookstores and cafes opened there.

More recently, the Chiyoda municipal government sponsored a major redevelopment project in Jinbōchō which led to three new high-rise office buildings being completed in 2003, further boosting the local economy. The Jinbōchō Theater was completed in 2007.

==Companies==
Many companies are located within Jinbōchō, including the headquarters of Tōkyōdō Shoten, a retail book chain, and manga company Shueisha, known for the anthology manga magazine, &quot;Shonen Jump&quot;.

==In popular culture==
*Jinbōchō is an important location in the &quot;Read or Die&quot; light novel franchise, and is the area where protagonist Yomiko Readman resides.
*Studio Ghibli film The Wind Rises depicts the 1923 Kanto Earthquake and subsequent fire destroying the former Jinbocho campus of Tokyo Imperial University.
*Manga series Dropkick on My Devil! used Jinbōchō as the area where main characters Yurine Hanazono and Jashin-chan reside, the district name was also featured in the plot, episode titles, and lyrics of feature songs.

==Education==
 operates public elementary and junior high schools. Ochanomizu Elementary School (お茶の水小学校) is the zoned elementary school for Kanda-Jinbōchō 1-3 chōme. There is a freedom of choice system for junior high schools in Chiyoda Ward, and so there are no specific junior high school zones.

<text>Motueka is a town in the South Island of New Zealand, close to the mouth of the Motueka River on the western shore of Tasman Bay. It is the second largest in the Tasman Region, with a population of as of 

The surrounding district has a number of apple, pear, and kiwifruit orchards, as well as growing a variety of specialised crops such as hops. The area formerly served as the main centre of tobacco growing in New Zealand until the early 1980s. A number of small vineyards have also been developed.

Nearby beaches (such as Kaiteriteri and Mārahau) are very popular with holidaymakers, and the area around Motueka has one of the country&#x27;s highest annual sunshine-hour indices. Riwaka lies 4.8 km north of Motueka via State Highway 60 and Nelson is 41.7 km to the east of Motueka via State Highway 60 and State Highway 6.

Motueka, as one of the nearest towns to the Abel Tasman and Kahurangi National Parks, has become the base of many tourism ventures, as well as in Nelson Lakes National Park, and in other recreational areas. Extensive limestone cave systems (including Harwoods Hole in the Tākaka Hill area north of Motueka) attract cavers and rock climbers. Sea kayaking, tramping, and canyoning now attract many thousands of visitors each year.

Many artists live in the area around Motueka, especially potters and reggae musicians. The Riverside Community, in nearby Lower Moutere, is a pacifist intentional community. Founded in the 1940s, it is New Zealand&#x27;s oldest cooperative living community.

== Name ==

The name &quot;Motueka&quot;, or more correctly &quot;Motuweka&quot;, comes from the Māori language, and means &quot;weka island&quot;, the weka being a bird of the rail family. The town is colloquially called &quot;Mot&quot; by some residents.

==History==
The first known European visitor to the coast near Motueka in 1827 was French explorer Jules Dumont d&#x27;Urville, of the French corvette Astrolabe. He explored and described much of the Tasman Bay shore line. Three ships carrying the New Zealand Company&#x27;s Nelson expedition, led by Captain Arthur Wakefield, anchored at Astrolabe Roads, north of Kaiteriteri Beach—about due north of Motueka—in October 1841. Kaiteriteri was selected as a site for the first settlement but was later abandoned in favour of Nelson Haven.

The exceptional fertility of the soil and the suitability of the surrounding land for small farm settlement were the main reasons for the establishment of the second town of the Nelson settlement at Motueka in 1842. There was trade between Nelson and Motueka in vegetables and timber in the 1840s. In 1850, Motueka had &quot;a church, various tradespeople, a general store, a doctor, a clergyman, a magistrate and a constable&quot;. Motueka was described as &quot;the village was laid out in small sections in the middle of a splendid bush, and had some good open land all around on which the farms were situated” in the 1850s. A significant flood hit Motueka in 1877 with the majority of buildings in the High Street being flooded.

During the period, 1853 to 1876, Motueka was administrated as part of the Nelson Province.

Motueka was created as a borough in 1900 with the first meeting of the Motueka Borough Council being held on 17 January 1900. The population at that time was 900 people with 182 ratepayers and 183 dwellings. The post office building was opened in 1902 by Sir Joseph Ward.
The Motueka war memorial was unveiled in 1922. It commemorates the 32 soldiers who died in WWI from the Motueka district. A plaque on the war memorial was unveiled in 1957 to commemorate the 35 soldiers who died in WWII from the Motueka district.

<text>Samuel Lee (born 7 February 1959) is an English professional football coach and former footballer.

Lee played most of his career for hometown club Liverpool during the 1970s and 1980s as a midfielder, and also represented England fourteen times. He also had playing spells at Queens Park Rangers, Osasuna, Southampton, and Bolton Wanderers. Throughout his career, there was always accusations from teammates that he didn’t shower, notably many refused to room with him. 

After retiring as a player, Lee joined the coaching staff at Liverpool before joining Sven-Göran Eriksson&#x27;s England set-up in 2001. He became assistant manager to Sam Allardyce at Bolton Wanderers in 2005, and their manager in 2007. He was then appointed assistant manager to Rafael Benítez at Liverpool in 2008 before returning to Bolton Wanderers in 2012 as head of academy coaching and development. Lee was appointed assistant coach at Southampton under Ronald Koeman in 2014 before joining Sam Allardyce&#x27;s England staff two years later. Lee followed Allardyce to Crystal Palace and Everton in 2017. Lee re-joined Allardyce again at West Brom in December 2020 as an assistant.

==Playing career==

Born in Liverpool, Lee rose through the ranks at Liverpool after joining on an apprenticeship in September 1975, making his first team debut on 8 April 1978, as a 6th minute substitute for David Johnson. Leicester City at Anfield were the opponents, as Lee managed to find the net in the 56th minute of the 3–2 victory. A year earlier, he had been put in the squad for a European Cup semi-final against FC Zürich and, although he didn&#x27;t play, manager Bob Paisley said he would have had no qualms about using him if required.

Lee became a regular from 1980 onwards and, although small in stature, he established a reputation as a sharp-passing and strong-running midfield player who could also hit a decent shot. In the 1981 League Cup final, Lee was at the centre of a controversial incident which left opponents West Ham United feeling slightly cheated. Lee had ventured forwards in an attack and ended up flat out on the turf following a challenge. The West Ham defence pushed out of their area to leave Lee in an offside position but when Liverpool full back Alan Kennedy scored with a follow-up shot, the goal stood. West Ham did equalise but Liverpool won the replay with Lee in the side.

In that year&#x27;s European Cup semi-final against Bayern Munich, Lee was unusually asked to do a man-marking job on Paul Breitner, the strong and skilful West German international. Lee did the marking job to perfection and Liverpool went through to the final against Real Madrid, which they won 1–0 with Lee again in the side.

Lee got his first League title medal in 1982 and also helped Liverpool retain the League Cup; the same applied in 1983 and 1984, the latter of which was also the year of their fourth European Cup triumph – Lee played in every game en route to the final and scored a clinching goal in the first leg of the semi-final at Anfield against Dinamo București.

Bobby Robson gave Lee the first of his 14 England caps during this period, where he again scored on his debut in the 3–0 1984 UEFA European Championship qualifier victory over Greece, on 17 November 1982.

Injuries took their toll in 1985 and Lee struggled to regain his previous form. With Jan Mølby in the side, there was no longer a place for him at Liverpool. He left during August 1986, joining Queens Park Rangers. Spells at CA Osasuna (where he reunited with former Liverpool teammate Michael Robinson), Southampton and Bolton Wanderers followed before he retired from playing.

==Coaching career==
Lee&#x27;s former Liverpool captain, Graeme Souness, invited Lee to join his Anfield coaching staff in 1993. He did so with relish and gained respect to the extent that both Roy Evans and Gérard Houllier kept him on the payroll after Souness left, gaining promotion from reserve team coach to the first team, under Houllier.

Lee became a part-time coach under Sven-Göran Eriksson with England in 2001, eventually leaving Liverpool to go full-time with the national set-up in July 2004.

===Bolton Wanderers===
Lee went to Bolton Wanderers in September 2005, as assistant to Sam Allardyce. He was offered the role of manager of the England U21s in July 2006, but turned the move down and also left the senior England set-up. He was given the affectionate nickname of &quot;Little Sam&quot; in contrast to Allardyce who was known as &quot;Big Sam&quot; by the Bolton Fans.

Allardyce left Bolton in April 2007 and Lee was confirmed as his replacement shortly afterwards. After only winning one league game from eleven matches, he was sacked in October 2007, becoming the second Premier League manager to be sacked in that season. He was known for regularly citing the &#x27;positives&#x27; in post-match interviews despite numerous defeats. He was linked with a return to Liverpool by becoming Rafael Benítez&#x27;s assistant after the pair watched a Liverpool reserve match together. He was also linked to the assistant manager position at Leeds United under Gary McAllister. He became the firm favourite to become assistant coach to Rafa Benitez following Alex Miller&#x27;s departure from Liverpool and officially returned to the club when appointed on 16 May 2008.

In November 2008, upon his return to the Reebok Stadium for the first time since his departure, Lee stated that he bore no animosity towards the hierarchy at Bolton or their supporters, the Wanderers crowd responded by giving him a round of applause in appreciation of his spells as player and assistant manager.

===Liverpool===
On 16 May 2008, Lee took up the role of assistant manager to Rafael Benítez after signing a two-year contract. On 21 December 2008, he took charge of Liverpool for the first time in a 1–1 draw with Arsenal due to Rafael Benítez being ill with kidney stones.

On 26 August 2009, Lee was sent off by referee Phil Dowd in a 2–1 defeat against Tottenham Hotspur, and was charged with improper conduct by the Football Association on 19 August 2009. He left Liverpool in June 2011 by mutual consent having remained at the club for the duration of Roy Hodgson’s tenure and the return of Kenny Dalglish. 

===Return to Bolton===
On 14 February 2012, Lee returned to Bolton for a third time, being appointed as the Head of Academy Coaching. His new role saw him take a senior role working alongside fellow ex-Wanderers players and Academy coaches Jimmy Phillips, Tony Kelly, David Lee, Nicky Spooner and Gavin McCann.

On 9 October 2012, after Owen Coyle&#x27;s sacking, Lee and Jimmy Phillips were named joint-caretaker managers. However, Phillips took charge of first team affairs, with Lee joining up with Julian Darby to assist him.

===Southampton===
On 27 June 2014, Lee agreed to leave Bolton to join Brighton &amp; Hove Albion as assistant manager to Sami Hyypia, with both knowing each other from their time together at Liverpool. However, on 29 June it was announced that he would instead take a coaching position with Southampton, alongside newly appointed manager Ronald Koeman. Lee left Southampton at the end of June 2016, following Koeman&#x27;s departure and the appointment of Claude Puel as manager.

===England===
On 25 July 2016, it was announced that Lee had rejoined Sam Allardyce as a member of England&#x27;s coaching staff. He left the role in December 2016, following the appointment of Gareth Southgate as manager.

===Crystal Palace===
After Sam Allardyce was appointed Crystal Palace manager, Lee was appointed his assistant on 10 January 2017.

After the departure of Allardyce from Selhurst Park at the end of the 2016–17 season, Lee continued as assistant manager under the club&#x27;s new manager, Frank de Boer. In September 2017, after de Boer&#x27;s departure, Lee also left the club.

===Everton===
On 1 December 2017, Lee was appointed assistant manager at Everton following the appointment of Sam Allardyce as manager the previous day. He departed Everton on 16 May 2018 following the sacking of Allardyce.

===West Bromwich Albion===
On 16 December 2020, Lee was appointed assistant head coach to Sam Allardyce after his appointment as manager at West Bromwich Albion.

<text>Éragny (; sometimes unofficially called Éragny-sur-Oise ) is a commune in the northwestern suburbs of Paris, France. It is located from the centre of Paris, in the &quot;new town&quot; of Cergy-Pontoise, Val-d&#x27;Oise, created in the 1960s.

Inhabitants are called &quot;Éragniens&quot; (masculine) and &quot;Éragniennés&quot; (feminine). In 2018, the commune had a population of 18,162.

==Population==

The population figures show very light growth the 30 last years after the very strong growth of 1975/1982. By contrast, Cergy-Pontoise, over the same period a growth of 16.16% posted (1,049,598 into 90, 1,105,464 into 99), showing that the area is still in fast progression. The current density (of 1999) is of 3,588 inhabitants by km2. It very in a decade of that of Paris (of less than 10,000 inhabitants/km2 in the 1st with more than 40,000 inhabitants/km2 in the 11th, given in 1999), and with the top of the average density of Île-de-France (900 inhabitants/km2), which is normal for an urban zone.

The distribution and approximately of 50/50 for the area, the proportion collective/individual is also 50/50, which shows a balance in the distribution. Development and population growth was at a peak between 1975 and 1982 but has declined recently (18 in 9 years). This weak current rate of construction of residences reflects demand. Density of residences is still low for an urban area at 1200 /km2.

==History==

Situated on the Oise river, Éragny remained a small village until the 20th century. Its original inhabitants probably settled around the town&#x27;s fountain during the Roman period and named the place Heriniacus or Areniacus. The site changed names several times over the following centuries - Eraisgny, Eraigny, Erargny, and finally settling on Éragny by the 10th century.

Local quarries have yielded stone tools from the Lower and Middle Palaeolithic.
Éragny and Conflans-Sainte-Honorine (Yvelines) were once a single parish, with Éragny the main settlement.
Documents from around 1100 AD spell the name as Herigniacus or Erinniacus.
In the early 12th century the vicomte de Pontoise, Raoul Deliès, gave a church dedicated to Saint Germain of Paris to the Cluniac Priory of Saint-Martin-des-Champs.

It is in 1564 that Jean d&#x27;Alessa came from Italy to buy the seigniory of Éragny.
Jean d&#x27;Alesso (1513–72) was the first known seigneur of Éragny.
He was treasurer of the constable Anne de Montmorency (1492–1567) and adviser of King Charles IX of France (1550–74).
His descendant François d&#x27;Alesso d&#x27;Éragny, marquis d&#x27;Éragny, was appointed governor general of the American islands in 1690.
Their family insignia, &quot;d&#x27;azur au sautoir d&#x27;or cantonné de quatre limaçons d&#x27;argent&quot;, was the model for the town&#x27;s current one. His heirs have spread his initial possessions and have kept them until the French Revolution when they were confiscated as &quot;emigrated possession&quot;.

In the 18th century the village was concentrated on the hillside above the floodplain, and the land was covered with crops, vineyards and woods.
There were stone quarries in the meander of the river.
A windmill was built shortly before the French Revolution.
It was demolished in 1841.
In 1804 the botanist and novelist Jacques-Henri Bernardin de Saint-Pierre (1737–1814) came to live in the former presbytery of the village.
He was the author of &quot;Paul and Virginie&quot;, and disciple of Jean-Jacques Rousseau. After his death in 1814, the village remained relatively unknown. At that time, the town had fewer than 500 inhabitants, consisting mainly of farmers.

The village held a telegraph tower, part of a private line from Paris to Le Havre, until 1835.
The church was destroyed in World War II by a crashed English airplane, and was rebuilt in the 1950s.

In 1868, almost half of the territory of Éragny was detached and became the commune of Neuville-sur-Oise.

With the arrival of the railroad started the exploitation of quarries used until then for local needs.

The rise of the ville nouvelle of Cergy-Pontoise, at the end of the 1960s, led to the town&#x27;s population to mushroom. Many streets were born on what is called &quot;le plateau&quot; and Éragny took today&#x27;s aspect with about 16,000 inhabitants loving their good living town.

==Transportation==
Éragny is served by Éragny–Neuville station on the Transilien Paris – Saint-Lazare suburban rail line.

==Education==
The commune has seven primary school groups. The schools include:
* Preschools (&quot;maternelles&quot;): de la Challe, Henri Fillette, Le Bois, Pablo Neruda, Les Dix Arpents, La Butte, Le Grillon
* Elementary schools: Henri Fillette, Le Bois, Les Longues Rayes, Pablo Neruda, Les Dix Arpents, La Butte, Le Grillon

There is one junior high school, Collège Léonard de Vinci, and one vocational high school, Lycée Professionnel Auguste Escoffier.

==Notable residents==
*Samuel Paty, middle school teacher killed and beheaded in 2020 in Islamist terrorist attack.

<text>Petar I Petrović-Njegoš (; 1748 – 31 October 1830) was the Prince-Bishop of Montenegro from 1784 to 1830 and Exarch (legate) of the Serbian Orthodox Church in Montenegro. He was the most popular spiritual and military leader from the Petrović dynasty. During his long rule, Petar strengthened the state by uniting the often quarreling tribes, consolidating his control over Montenegrin lands, introducing the first laws in Montenegro in 1798. His rule prepared Montenegro for the subsequent introduction of modern institutions of the state: taxes, schools and larger commercial enterprises. He was canonized by the Serbian Orthodox Church as Saint Peter of Cetinje ().

==Early life==
The son of Marko and Anđelija (née Martinović), Petar followed the footsteps of his relatives, becoming a monk and a deacon. He spent four years in Imperial Russia, finishing the Military School (1765–69). In 1778, archimandrite Petar was in Russia with &quot;guvernadur&quot; Jovan Radonjić and &quot;serdar&quot; Ivan Petrović. Metropolitan Sava Petrović (s. 1735–1781), who died in 1781, chose his nephew and co-adjutor Arsenije Plamenac the successor, which was met with opposition from the Montenegrin tribes at the beginning, later switching in favour after Sava gained the support of Šćepan Mali, the false tsar and ruler of Montenegro. Plamenac was inactive and had little power, serving as metropolitan between 1781 and his death in 1784. The &quot;guvernadur&quot; family of Radonjić, which had Venetian support and then Austrian, increased their power and sought to push aside the Petrović metropolitans. The chieftains had suggested Petar the bishop seat already in 1783, and he was then sent to the Habsburg Monarchy to be ordained.

==Office==

===1784–99===
Petar was made a bishop (ordained) by Mojsije Putnik of the Metropolitanate of Karlovci at Sremski Karlovci on 13 October 1784. He then returned to Vienna where he met Russian chancellor Potemkin, and also Austrian general Zorić and Ragusan emigre Frano Dolci. Petar was, under unclear circumstances, kicked out of St. Petersburg in November 1785. During his trip, Montenegro was threatened by Kara Mahmud Pasha, the Pasha of Scutari. Mahmud Pasha attacked in June 1785. The Montenegrin army of 8000 was reduced by 3,000 Crmničani, and they were followed by many more surrenders. Mahmud Pasha crossed Bjelice, and burnt down Njeguši, and received help from Nikšići, then crossed Paštrovići to return to Scutari.

The Metropolitan Petar I and &quot;guvernadur&quot; Jovan Radonjić were the two head chiefs of Montenegro, one by title, the other according to actual position. Jovan sought to rule Montenegro by himself; he appropriated secular rights for himself and wanted the Metropolitan to exercise only his spiritual leadership; that the &quot;guvernadur&quot; was the master of the people and the Metropolitan the master of the church. The two clashed in international politics: the Metropolitan held to Russia, while Jovan relied on Austria. Hence, there were two parties in the land, one &quot;Russophile&quot; and the other &quot;Austrophile&quot;, led by the Metropolitan and Jovan, respectively. On the question whether to support Austria or not, the two sides conflicted during the Austro-Turkish War (1787–91) and Russo-Turkish War (1787–92). During this period, Montenegro was divided into the following districts: &quot;Katunska nahija&quot;, &quot;Riječka nahija&quot;, &quot;Crmnička nahija&quot;, &quot;Lješanska nahija&quot; and &quot;Pješivačka nahija&quot;. These were governed by the officials, Jovan Radonjić and the Metropolitan, with the help of 5 serdars, 9 vojvodas and 34 knezes (a synthesis of secular and theocratic government which will cause strife and struggle for supremacy until 1832–33).

In July 1788, Jovan Radonjić asked Empress Catherine II of Russia to send Sofronije Jugović-Marković, whom he promised the throne of Montenegro; Jovan sought to bring him to the land and replace Petrović, then get rid of him too, securing the rule for himself. He sent another letter in 1789, then made a trip to Austria seeking to retrieve his reputation with the help of the Austrian court. Radonjić requested that the Austrian army be sent into Montenegro, which was declined. On Radonjić&#x27;s re-request, the Austrian Emperor decided to send munition to Montenegro in February 1790, provided that the Montenegrins &quot;come under the wings of the Emperor in war-time, as much as in peace-time, with the Ottoman Empire&quot;. Austrian support looked unpromising.

In 1794, the Kuči and Rovčani (tribes outside Montenegro) were devastated by the Ottomans. In 1796, Kara Mahmud Pasha was defeated at the Battle of Martinići. Mahmud Pasha later returned and was defeated and killed at the Battle of Krusi on 22 September. Half of the Montenegrin army was led by Metropolitan Petar I, the other by Jovan. Petar I&#x27;s army was assisted by the Piperi. Mahmud Pasha&#x27;s army, allegedly made up of 30,000, including seven French officers, fought a Montenegrin force of 6,000, and had heavy casualties. The Montenegrin victory resulted in territorial expansion, with the tribes of Bjelopavlići and Piperi being joined into the Montenegrin state. The Rovčani, as other highlander tribes, subsequently turned more and more towards Montenegro. 

The tribe of Njeguši to which the Petrović-Njegoš belonged was involved in one of the most long-standing blood feuds in Montenegro against the tribe of Ceklin in the 18th century. The feud lasted for 32 years and ended in 1797 in a joint meeting of all tribes of Old Montenegro under Petar Petrović. The pacification of the feud between two of the strongest tribes of the region is considered as an important step in Petar Petrović&#x27;s strategy of uniting Old Montenegro.

Metropolitan Petar I sent letters in 1799 to the Moračani and Rovčani, advising them to live peacefully and in solidarity. In 1799, Montenegro was guaranteed a subsidy by Russia, which assured that it would defend its interest.

===1800–09===
During the First Serbian Uprising Petar I began cooperating with Karađorđe, the Serbian rebel leader. Petar I had by that time distinguished himself in international relations, as the bishop and ruler of Montenegro. It was known that Petar was ready to revolt as soon as a favourable opportunity came along. Russian ambassador in Vienna, Razumovski, informed Interior Minister Czartoryski of a secret message received on 13 December 1803 that Petar I had 2,000 armed men, and that he &quot;had taken off his bishop clothes and dressed in military clothing, a general uniform&quot; and that he planned to raise his army to 12,000 men. Knowing that his army would not be able to fight the stronger Ottomans, he sought to unite with the &quot;rebels of Šumadija&quot;, and together, with the help of the Russian, turn on the Turks. He messaged Visoki Dečani of his intentions. Petar I was a pen pal of Dositej Obradović.
In 1806, the troops of Napoleonic France advanced toward the Bay of Kotor in Montenegro. The Montenegrin army led by Petar I, aided by several Russian battalions and the fleet of Admiral Dmitry Senyavin pushed them back to Dubrovnik. But soon after, Russian Tsar Alexander I asked Montenegrins to relinquish control of Boka to Austria. However, after Montenegrins retreated to Herceg Novi, Alexander changed his mind again, and with a help of Montenegrins conquered Brač and Korčula. In the meantime, France encouraged Turkey to attack Russia, which withdrew its fleet from the Adriatic to defend the Ionian islands. The Treaty of Tilsit (1807) between Russia and France granted the control of the Bay of Kotor to France. In early 1807, Petar had plans to unite several Serb-inhabited regions into a renewed Serbian Empire. In February 1807, Petar I planned an invasion of Herzegovina and asked for Karađorđe&#x27;s aid. After the Battle of Suvodol and Serbian rebel advance, Karađorđe managed connecting the rebel forces to Montenegro (1809). However, Karađorđe was unable to hold lasting ties with the Serbs of Montenegro and Bosnia and Herzegovina, as after 1809 the uprising waned.

===1810–20===
Petar I waged a successful campaign against the Bosnia Eyalet in 1819. In 1820, in the north of Montenegro, the highlanders from Morača led by &quot;serdar&quot; Mrkoje Mijušković won a major battle against the Ottoman Bosnian forces. The repulse of an Ottoman invasion from Albania during the Russo-Turkish War (1828–29) led to the recognition of Montenegrin sovereignty over Piperi. Petar I had managed to unite the Piperi and Bjelopavlići with Montenegro, and when Bjelopavlići and the rest of &quot;the Hills&quot; (Seven hills) were joined into the Montenegrin state, the polity was officially called &quot;Black Mountain (Montenegro) and the Hills&quot;.

==Pan-Serbism==
Petar I conceived a plan in 1807 to revive a Serbian Empire (&quot;Slaveno–Serb empire&quot;), which he informed the Russian court. Earlier, in June 1804, Habsburg Serb metropolitan Stefan Stratimirović informed the Russian court of the same plan. Petar I&#x27;s plan was to unite Podgorica, Spuž, Žabljak, the Bay of Kotor, Bosnia, Herzegovina, Dubrovnik and Dalmatia with Montenegro. The title of Serbian emperor would be held by the Russian emperor. The French–Russian peace treaty thwarted the plan. After the French conquered Dalmatia, they offered Petar I the title of &quot;Patriarch of all of the Serb nation or all Illyricum&quot; under the condition that he stop cooperation with Russia and accept a French protectorate, which he declined, fearing eventual Papal jurisdiction. The Metropolitanate of Cetinje began exerting influence towards Brda and Old Herzegovina, which considered Montenegro as the leader for liberation. While his reputation and influence reached the surrounding lands, he increasingly directed himself to Revolutionary Serbia as the backbone for liberation and unification. The project is included in several historiographical works.
==Canonisation==

He was canonised as Saint Peter of Cetinje by his successor Petar II Petrović-Njegoš. The Serbian Orthodox Church celebrate him on October 31, Gregorian calendar, which is October 18th in the Julian calendar.

<text>Johann Heinrich Abicht (4 May 1762 – 28 April 1816) was a German philosopher.

==Biography==
Abicht was born at (now part of Rudolstadt). His grandfather was teacher and organist in Wilmersdorf, Gehren, and his father was a teacher in Volkstedt. Johann Abicht himself finished the college in Rudolstadt and visited the University of Erlangen in 1781. In 1784 he became controller at the house of chief equerry von Schall in Öhringen. Abicht made his magister in 1786 and his doctor in philosophy in 1790. In the same year, he was appointed adjunct and then extraordinary professor in the philosophical faculty. He became regular professor in 1796. On 4 August 1804 he was appointed professor of logic and metaphysics at the newly reorganised university of Wilna. He died at Wilna, aged 53.

His philosophy is clearly influenced by Kant, later by Karl Leonhard Reinhold.

<doc id="763624" wikidata="Q1145127" url="?curid=763624" title="Kererū">
<text>The kererū (Hemiphaga novaeseelandiae), also known as kūkupa (Northern Māori dialects), New Zealand pigeon or wood pigeon is a species of pigeon native to New Zealand. Johann Friedrich Gmelin described the bird in 1789 as a large, conspicuous pigeon up to in length and in weight, with a white breast and iridescent green–blue plumage. Two subspecies have been recognised; the second—the Norfolk pigeon of Norfolk Island—became extinct in the early 20th century. Kererū pairs are monogamous, breeding over successive seasons and remaining together when not breeding. They construct nests with twigs in trees, with a single egg clutch.

Found in a variety of habitats across the country, the kererū feeds mainly on fruits, as well as leaves, buds and flowers. Although widespread in both forest and urban habitats, its numbers have declined significantly since European colonisation and the arrival of invasive mammals such as rats, stoats and possums. However, the results of nationwide bird surveys indicate that there has been a significant recovery in the population of kererū in suburban areas. As of 2022, the IUCN Red List classifies the species as least concern, while the Department of Conservation (DOC) classifies the kererū as &quot;not threatened&quot; but conservation dependent.

Considered a (cultural treasure) to the Māori people, the kererū was historically a major food source in Māori culture. However, due to the previous decline in its population, hunting is illegal. Customary use of kererū is restricted to the use of feathers and bones obtained from dead birds collected by DOC. This issue has received significant public and political attention, as some people argue that bans on kererū hunting are detrimental to Māori traditions. In 2018, the kererū was designated Bird of the Year by the New Zealand organisation Forest &amp; Bird, and in 2019, the exoplanet HD 137388 b was renamed Kererū in its honour.

== Taxonomy and nomenclature==
=== History and binomials===
English ornithologist John Latham wrote about the kererū in his &quot;A General Synopsis of Birds&quot; in 1783 but did not give it a scientific name. German naturalist Johann Friedrich Gmelin gave it its first formal description in 1789, placing it in genus &quot;Columba&quot; as &quot;C. novaeseelandiae&quot;, with Latham naming it &quot;Columba zealandica&quot; in his 1790 &quot;Index Ornithologicus&quot;. The genus &quot;Hemiphaga&quot; was introduced by the French naturalist Charles Lucien Bonaparte in 1854 with the kererū (&quot;Hemiphaga novaeseelandiae&quot;) as the type species for that genus. The name combines the Ancient Greek meaning &quot;half-&quot; or &quot;small&quot;, with the end of the genus name &quot;Carpophaga&quot;, &quot;fruit eating&quot;, as Bonaparte saw the genus as related to both that genus and &quot;Megaloprepia&quot; (now incorporated into &quot;Ptilinopus&quot;).

===Subspecies===

Two subspecies are recognised: &quot;H. n. novaseelandiae,&quot; which is found throughout New Zealand, and the little-studied Norfolk pigeon (&quot;H. n. spadicea&quot;) of Norfolk Island, now extinct. The subspecies differed in their plumage colour and shape. In 2001, it was proposed that a third subspecies — &quot;H. n. chathamensis&quot; or the Chatham Islands pigeon — should be raised to full species status as &quot;H. chathamensis&quot; on the basis of its distinct plumage, larger size and differing bone structure. This has since been widely accepted. Analysis of mitochondrial DNA confirmed the kererū and Norfolk pigeons to be more closely related to each other than to the Chatham pigeon, and that dispersal between the three landmasses most likely occurred during the Pleistocene Epoch.

===Classification===
The kererū belongs to the family Columbidae, and the subfamily Ptilinopinae, which is found throughout Southeast Asia, Malaya, Australia and New Zealand. The members of this subfamily feed largely on fruits, mainly stone fruit. Within the subfamily, the kererū and Chatham Islands pigeon are in a clade with a lineage that has given rise to the topknot pigeon (&quot;Lopholaimus antarcticus&quot;) of Australia and the mountain pigeons (&quot;Gymnophaps&quot;) of New Guinea, as shown in the cladogram below.

===Common names===
&quot;New Zealand pigeon&quot; has been designated the official common name of the kererū by the International Ornithologists&#x27; Union (IOU). The word &quot;kererū&quot; (which is both singular and plural) is the most common Māori name, and a variety of mainstream sources now use the name kererū for the species. Spelling Māori loanwords with macrons — that indicate a long vowel — is now common in New Zealand English where technically possible. It is also known as kūkupa and kūkū in some parts of North Island, particularly in Northland, and Latham had reported the name &quot;Hagarrèroo&quot; in 1783. Kererū have also been called &quot;wood pigeons&quot;.

== Description ==
The kererū is a large arboreal pigeon weighing , and is up to in length, with a wingspan of around . Its appearance is that of a typical pigeon, in that it has a relatively small head, a straight soft-based bill and loosely attached feathers. The sexes have similar plumage. The head, neck and upper breast are dark green with a gold-bronze highlights, while the nape, upper back and secondary coverts are a copper-sheened purple, lightening to a more grey-green on the lower back, rump and the rest of upper surface of the wings. The tail is dark brown with green highlights and a pale edge. The breast is white, and sharply demarcated from the darker parts of its plumage. The undertail and underwing coverts are mainly pale grey. The bill is red with an orange tip, the feet dark red, and eyes are red with a pink orbital ring. Juveniles have a similar colouration but are generally paler with dull colours for the beak, eyes and feet and a shorter tail. The extinct Norfolk Island subspecies had a chestnut mantle, more grey outer wings and rump, a dark purple tail and white under wing and undertail coverts.

Kererū make occasional soft &quot;coo&quot; sounds, and their wings make a characteristic &quot;whoosh&quot; during flight. The bird&#x27;s flight is also distinctive; birds will often ascend slowly before making steep parabolic dives.

== Environment and distribution ==

Usually they are found from Northland to Stewart Island / Rakiura and offshore islands, the kererū was historically abundant throughout the country. Its lack of genetic diversity suggests the species retreated to forest refugia during periods of Quaternary glaciation and rapidly spread across the country again when the climate grew warmer. Kererū bones have been recovered from Raoul Island in the Kermadecs, confirming the species once inhabited the island, though it was made locally extinct through hunting and cat predation in the late 1800s. They can be found in a variety of habitats including in native lowland forest, scrub, the countryside, and city gardens and parks.

The kererū lives in habitats ranging in altitude from coastal to montane. However their numbers declined significantly after European colonisation. This was due mainly to a decrease in habitat, introduced predators and hunting. Currently, whether kererū are present at a particular location within New Zealand is dependent on numerous factors such as forest cover, forest type and density of predators. Although sedentary, kererū can move considerable distances within their range; most fieldwork showed them moving up to , generally looking for food. A 2011 study in Southland revealed that three of four kererū tagged around Invercargill crossed the Foveaux Strait to Stewart Island, and travelled up to .

== Feeding ==

The kererū is primarily frugivorous, preferring fruit from native trees, but also eating leaves, flowers and buds. The kererū feeds on many species with tropical affinities, including the Lauraceae and Arecaceae, which abound in the essentially subtropical forests of northern New Zealand. They also feed on podocarp species such as miro (&quot;Prumnopitys ferruginea&quot;) and kahikatea (&quot;Dacrycarpus dacrydioides&quot;). Other fruit sought after by kererū include those of tawa (&quot;Beilschmiedia tawa&quot;), taraire (&quot;Beilschmiedia tarairi&quot;), pūriri (&quot;Vitex lucens&quot;), pigeonwood (&quot;Hedycarya arborea&quot;), as well as tītoki (&quot;Alectryon excelsus&quot;), nīkau (&quot;Rhopalostylis sapida&quot;), karaka (&quot;Corynocarpus laevigatus&quot;), &quot;Coprosma&quot;, and introduced species such as elder (&quot;Sambucus nigra&quot;), privet (&quot;Ligustrum&quot; species) and plums. Because of its diverse diet and widespread distribution, the kererū plays an important ecological role, and is vital to the health of podocarp-broadleaf forest.

While fruit comprises the major part of its diet, the kererū also browses on leaves and buds from a wide variety of both native and exotic species, especially nitrogen-rich foliage during breeding. Its diet changes seasonally as the availability of fruit changes, and leaves can comprise most of its diet at certain times of the year. Preferred leaves include kōwhai, tree lucerne, willow, elm, and poplar.

After eating, kererū often sun themselves while digesting their food. This behaviour can lead to the fruit fermenting in the bird&#x27;s crop, particularly during warm summer weather, producing alcohol that causes the bird to become intoxicated. The kererū displays typical pigeon behaviour, including drinking by suction (unlike many birds which drink by raising their heads, using the assistance of gravity). Kererū also feed crop milk to hatchlings.

==Breeding and lifespan==

The kererū is monogamous; pairs are thought to reproduce together over multiple seasons, and remain together when not breeding. Breeding generally depends on the availability of ripe fruit, which varies seasonally, annually, and by location. In the warmer Northland region, kererū are able to raise young year round, provided enough fruit is available. They do not breed when moulting, which tends to take place between March and May. Further south, fewer subtropical tree species grow, and in these areas breeding usually occurs between October (early spring) and April (late summer/early autumn), again depending on fruit availability. During the breeding season the male kererū performs display flights, where it ascends steeply and appears to stall at the top of the flight, before a steep swooping descent. The courtship display includes the male turning around on a perch adjacent to a female, placing the tip of the bill into a wing, and stretching out his neck while bowing his head. He then bounces up and down with his bill resting on his chest, and proceeds to mate with her if she is receptive, which she indicates by lowering her body so he can mount her.

The kererū nests in the canopy of trees, bushes, shrubs, or hedges, anywhere from above the ground. Both birds construct the unlined platform of twigs—mostly kānuka (&quot;Kunzea ericoides&quot;), which can be up to across. The clutch consists of a single oval white egg, which is 49 mm long by 34 mm wide. It is incubated for 28–29 days, with the male and female taking turns to incubate in shifts of around six hours. Fieldwork in Motatau Forest in Northland found that both parents then brooded the chick for 9–13 days, followed by the female alone. After 13–27 days, parents fed the chick without brooding. Weight gain is rapid in the first 8 days, while feathers appear between 5th and 8th days. The young bird fledges after 30–45 days. A pair may begin building a second nest before their chick in the first nest fledges. In seasons of plentiful fruit the kererū can successfully nest up to four times. Kererū have a lifespan of 15 to 25 years; in 2020, a 29-year-old bird nicknamed &quot;Pidge&quot; turned up in Rotorua after not being seen for 24 years.

== Conservation ==

Kererū were numerous until the 1960s, but they have since come under threat from introduced mammalian species, hunting, habitat degradation, and poor reproductive success. The introduced Australian common brushtail possum (&quot;Trichosurus vulpecula&quot;) and introduced species of rats—mainly the black rat (&quot;Rattus rattus&quot;), but also the Polynesian rat (&quot;R. exulans&quot;) and brown rat (&quot;R. norvegicus&quot;)—have played a role in reducing the population of kererū. Both possums and rats significantly reduce the amount of fruit available for kererū, and they also prey on kererū eggs and nestlings; cats and stoats kill adults as well as young. On Norfolk Island, the local subspecies was last seen in 1900; direct hunting by people was probably the main cause of extinction.

The Wild Birds Protection Act 1864 established hunting season for the species from April to July. With kererū populations declining across the country, harvests became increasingly restricted by the government. This culminated in the Animals Protection and Game Act 1921–1922, which designated the kererū as an absolutely protected species, although the enforcement against hunting was not consistent. This act was repealed and replaced by the Wildlife Act 1953, which reaffirmed the status of kererū as a protected species and outlawed any taking of the birds. Prosecutions have been taken enforcing this law. Māori have protested at each of these law changes, claiming a traditional right to hunt the pigeon.

Kererū are also vulnerable to injury or death as a result of collisions with vehicles. A large number of kererū fatalities have been reported alongside State Highway 2 in Wellington, as a result of low-flying birds being struck by vehicles as they fly across the motorway to feed on the flowers of tree lucerne. Kererū can also be injured or killed following collisions with the windows of buildings. In 2021, the Urban Wildlife Trust commenced a campaign to help protect kererū and other birds from colliding with the large glazed areas surrounding the upper terminal building of the Wellington Cable Car, adjacent to Wellington Botanic Gardens. The proposed solution was the installation of a grid of dots permanently fixed to approximately of glass.

As of 2022, the kererū has been classified under the IUCN Red List as &quot;Least Concern&quot;, and the listing reports an increasing population trend. The Department of Conservation (DOC) classifies the kererū under the New Zealand threat classification system as &quot;not threatened&quot; with an increasing population but views the species as conservation dependent. However, it has been argued that several of the factors that caused the historic decrease in population are still present and could continue to damage the population.

===The Great Kererū Count===
A survey of kererū population was undertaken for 10 consecutive days every year from 2013 to 2021, using observations from members of the public. The Great Kererū Count has been claimed to be New Zealand&#x27;s largest citizen science project. It was led by the conservation organisations Kererū Discovery and Urban Wildlife Trust, in conjunction with city councils in Wellington, Dunedin and Nelson, and Victoria University of Wellington.

The findings from the annual count, together with the results of a separate citizen science project—the annual New Zealand Garden Bird Survey—indicate that there has been a recovery in the population of kererū in suburban areas, with a 79% increase in sightings from 2010 to 2020. The final Great Kererū Count was held in 2021, with more sightings recorded than in previous years. There were 24,562 kererū counted in the 10-day period 17–26 September, with 28% from Auckland.

== Relationship with humans ==
=== In Māori culture ===
Traditionally used for both its meat and feathers, the kererū is considered &quot;taonga&quot; to Māori; as such, for various &quot;iwi&quot; such as Ngāi Tūhoe, kererū forms an important part of their cultural identity. Kererū were the food of choice associated with Puanga celebrations as the birds are fat from eating berries that ripen during this time. They also tended to be easier to catch at this time of year due to their intoxication from fermented berries. Kererū feathers continue to be retained for making &quot;kākahu&quot; (fine cloaks), while the tail feathers were used to decorate the &quot;tahā huahua&quot; (food storage containers).

Snaring was the most common method of capturing kererū; less commonly, birds were speared. One type of snaring used &quot;waka waituhi&quot;, a trap where snares were placed on the sides of a water trough suspended in a tree. As the kererū landed to drink from the trough, they would become caught by the snare. Occasionally, tame kererū were used as decoys to entice others. Once caught, kererū were typically preserved in their own fat within &quot;tahā huahua&quot; (food storage containers). They were so abundant that New Zealand ornithologist Walter Buller reported at least 8000 birds were caught and prepared in this manner from a grove of miro near Lake Taupō over July and August 1882.

In one Māori legend, the hero and trickster Māui took the form of a kererū when he went down into the underworld in search of his parents. According to this legend, the reason for the kererū&#x27;s iridescent green-blue and white plumage is because when Māui transformed into the kererū, he was carrying the skirt/apron and belt of his mother, Tāranga. The apron, &quot;Te Taro o Tāranga&quot;, is represented by the white breast feathers; the belt, &quot;Te Tātua a Tāranga&quot;, is signified by the green-blue feathers on the neck of the kererū.

=== In archaeological sites ===
Kererū remains have been found in both inland and coastal sites throughout New Zealand. Identification of bone specimens in archaeological sites has been difficult due to their being fragmented during preparation for food, or because fine-mesh sieving was not carried out during excavations to retrieve bone samples. A genetic analysis of bones from paleontological and archaeological sites, to determine the extent of fauna and the human impact on them, identified kererū bones at seven archaeological sites. These sites give insight into the interactions between humans and kererū, including the effect of Māori hunting on historic kererū populations. As well as being found on the main islands of New Zealand, kererū bones have also been recovered from sites excavated at Harataonga Bay on Great Barrier Island. In the South Island, excavations in 2018 at the Raincliff rock art shelter in South Canterbury, revealed kererū along with the bones of rats, extinct moa and New Zealand quail. Kererū bones, along with bones of other forest birds kākā, kākāpō and red-crowned parakeets, were also found in rock shelter sites on Lee Island, Lake Te Anau in Southland.

=== Harvesting ===
From the 1990s, the issue of whether to re-establish the customary harvest of kererū has received significant public and political attention. In 1994, the New Zealand Conservation Authority published a discussion paper about allowing the harvest of various species protected under the Wildlife Act 1953, including the kererū. It has been argued that preventing the customary harvests of taonga such as kererū is in-part degrading or facilitating the loss of &quot;mātauranga&quot; (traditional knowledge) among Māori. Furthermore, some argue that because the Treaty of Waitangi guarantees tangata whenua possession of taonga such as kererū, it therefore guarantees their right to harvest those taonga. Currently, customary use of kererū is restricted to the use of feathers and bones obtained from dead birds collected by DOC.

=== Recognition ===
The kererū is featured on the reverse side of the series 3 (1967–1981) and series 4 (1981–1991) New Zealand twenty-dollar note. In 2018, the kererū was the winner of the annual Bird of the Year competition run by the New Zealand Forest &amp; Bird organisation. In 2019, the exoplanet originally named HD 137388 b was renamed in honour of the kererū.

<text>Tuone Udaina (1823 – 10 June 1898; Antonio Udina in Italian) was the last known speaker of Dalmatian, a Romance language that evolved from Latin along the eastern coast of the Adriatic Sea. He was the main source of knowledge about his parents&#x27; dialect, that of the island of Veglia, for the linguist Matteo Bartoli, who recorded it in 1897.

Udaina bore the nickname &quot;Burbur&quot;, the etymology of which is uncertain. Bartoli tentatively associated it with , an Italian word for a surly, gruff, or ill-tempered person. Other interpretations include &quot;barbarian&quot; and &quot;barber&quot;. 
He worked as a marine postman and as a sexton.

Vegliot Dalmatian was not Udaina&#x27;s native language, as he had learned it from listening to his parents&#x27; private conversations. Udaina had not spoken the Dalmatian language for nearly 20 years before the time he acted as a linguistic informant. No sound recordings were ever made.

When Udaina was killed at 74 in an explosion during road work on 10 June 1898, the Dalmatian language is generally assumed to have become extinct as no other speakers of the language were found or known to have lived.

<doc id="763629" wikidata="Q1573015" url="?curid=763629" title="Shikigami">
<text>(also read as ) is the term for a being from Japanese folklore. According to the Shinto scholar Inoue Nobutaka, it is thought to be some sort of , represented by a small ghost. The belief of &quot;shikigami&quot; originates from &quot;Onmyōdō&quot;. According to the tradition of &quot;Onmyōdō&quot;, &quot;shikigami&quot; is a symbol of &quot;onmyōji&quot;″s power because &quot;onmyōji&quot; can freely use &quot;shikigami&quot; with magical powers. It has been associated with &quot;curses&quot; since the 1000s of the Heian period, and was often depicted as a bird or a child in Japanese literature and &quot;Emakimono&quot;.

==Description==
&quot;Shikigami&quot; are conjured beings, made alive through a complex conjuring ceremony. Their power is connected to the spiritual force of their master, where if the invoker is well introduced and has much experience, their &quot;shiki&quot; can possess animals and even people and manipulate them, but if the invoker is careless, their &quot;shikigami&quot; may get out of control in time, gaining its own will and consciousness and can even raid its own master and kill them in revenge. Usually &quot;shikigami&quot; are conjured to exercise risky orders for their masters, such as spying, stealing and enemy tracking. &quot;Shikigami&quot; are said to be invisible most of the time, but they can be made visible by binding them into small, folded and artfully cut paper manikins. There are also &quot;shikigami&quot; that can show themselves as animals.

In the &quot;Izanagi-ryū&quot; () folk religion, the most elite &quot;onmyōji&quot; could also conjure an exceptionally powerful type of &quot;shikigami&quot; called a &quot;shikiōji&quot; () to ward off disasters or demons that cause sickness. Regular mystics could not attempt to summon it without risking losing control of it due to its oni-like nature. 

==In popular culture==
Within the realm of the manga and anime series &quot;Jujutsu Kaisen&quot;, shikigami play a pivotal role in the arsenal of jujutsu sorcerers, notably Megumi Fushiguro. The supernatural entities are conjured through the manipulation of cursed energy, typically facilitated by talismans and summoning magic.

<text>Chingola is a town in Zambia&#x27;s Copperbelt Province, the country&#x27;s copper-mining region, with a population of 256,560 (2022 census). It is the home of Nchanga Copper Mine, a deep-shaft high-grade content copper mining operation, which subsequently (in the 1960s) led to the development of two open pit operations, Chingola Open Pit and then Nchanga Open Pit (the latter being the second largest open cast mine in the world).

==History==
Chingola was founded in 1943, somewhat later than most other Copperbelt Province towns. Chingola was built to service the newly opened Nchanga Copper mine.

== Demographics ==
==Mines==

Situated at the north-west end of the Copperbelt Province, the Nchanga Mines Open Pit workings lie in an arc 11 km long around the west and north of the town, covering nearly 30 km2. The deepest part of the pit is 400 m lower than the surrounding plateau.

The Mimbula Copper Project is a copper rich oxide and sulphide deposit, located on the outskirts of the town of Chingola on a mining licence held by Moxico Resources’ Zambian unit. Moxico Resources is a development and exploration mining company incorporated in the UK. In 2021, Moxico Resources began construction of a 10,000 tonne Leach Pad, Solvent Extraction and Electrowinning Plant. The Plant is expected to be operational by Q2 2022 and is planned to be expanded in phases.

==Communications==
A freight-only branch of Zambian Railways services the town from Kitwe. The branch includes the movement of copper ore to the smelters at Nkana in Kitwe.

Chingola is on the main Copperbelt Highway (the T3 road) running north to Lubumbashi in DR Congo via Chililabombwe and Konkola and running south-east to Kapiri Mposhi via Kitwe and Ndola. It is also at the start of the T5 road, running west-north-west to a border with Angola via Solwezi and Mwinilunga.

Chingola is served by Kasompe Airport, (IATA code: CGJ). It is also served by 2 shopping malls: The Park Mall and the Motherland Shopping Mall.

==Public facilities==
Nchanga Rangers Football Club is the town&#x27;s largest soccer club and hosts games at the Nchanga Stadium located in the Nchanga North suburb.

==Features of Chingola==

===National Monument===
* Hippo Pool on the Kafue River, 10 km north, established as a National Monument in 1954.

===Other features===
* Chimfunshi Wildlife Orphanage, a sanctuary for orphaned chimpanzees, lies 60 km north-west of Chingola.
* &quot;Five Mile Rock&quot;, about 8 kilometres from Chingola on the right hand side of the T3 road to Kitwe, is a popular landmark.

== Notable people born in Chingola ==
* Felix Bwalya (1970–1997), boxer
* Patson Daka (born 1998), footballer
* Samuel Matete (born 1968), athlete
* Chilekwa Mumba (born 1984/1985), environmental activist
* Elias Munshya (born 1978), diplomat
* Richard Moth (born 1958), Roman Catholic prelate and Bishop of Arundel and Brighton

<doc id="763637" wikidata="Q1125466" url="?curid=763637" title="Water fluoridation">
<text>Water fluoridation is the controlled addition of fluoride to public water supplies to reduce tooth decay. Fluoridated water maintains fluoride levels effective for cavity prevention, achieved naturally or through supplementation. In the mouth, fluoride slows tooth enamel demineralization and enhances remineralization in early-stage cavities. Defluoridation is necessary when natural fluoride exceeds recommended limits. The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends fluoride levels of 0.5–1.5 mg/L, depending on climate and other factors. In the U.S., the recommended level has been 0.7 mg/L since 2015, lowered from 1.2 mg/L. Bottled water often has unknown fluoride levels.

Tooth decay affects 60–90% of schoolchildren worldwide. Fluoridation reduces cavities in children, with Cochrane reviews estimating reductions of 35% in baby teeth and 26% in permanent teeth when no other fluoride sources are available, though efficacy in adults is less clear. In Europe and other regions, declining decay rates are attributed to topical fluorides and alternatives like salt fluoridation and nano-hydroxyapatite.

The United States was the first country to engage in water fluoridation, and 72% of their population now drinks fluoridated water as of 2022. Globally, 5.4% of people receive fluoridated water, though its use remains rare in Europe, except in Ireland and parts of Spain. The WHO, FDI World Dental Federation, and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention endorse fluoridation as safe and effective at recommended levels. Critics question its risks, efficacy, and ethical implications.

Recent systematic reviews suggest an association between higher fluoride exposure and lower IQ in children. These findings remain debated among experts and public health organizations.

== Goal ==
The goal of water fluoridation is to prevent tooth decay by adjusting the concentration of fluoride in public water supplies. Tooth decay (dental caries) is one of the most prevalent chronic diseases worldwide. Although it is rarely life-threatening, tooth decay can cause pain and impair eating, speaking, facial appearance, and acceptance into society, and it greatly affects the quality of life of children, particularly those of low socioeconomic status. In most industrialized countries, tooth decay affects 60–90% of schoolchildren and the vast majority of adults; although the problem appears to be less in Africa&#x27;s developing countries, it is expected to increase in several countries there because of changing diet and inadequate fluoride exposure. In the U.S., minorities and the poor both have higher rates of decayed and missing teeth, and their children have less dental care. Once a cavity occurs, the tooth&#x27;s fate is that of repeated restorations, with estimates for the median life of an amalgam tooth filling ranging from 9 to 14 years. Oral disease is the fourth most expensive disease to treat. The motivation for fluoridation of salt or water is similar to that of iodized salt for the prevention of congenital hypothyroidism and goiter.

The goal of water fluoridation is to prevent a chronic disease whose burdens particularly fall on children and the poor. Another of the goals was to bridge inequalities in dental health and dental care. Some studies suggest that fluoridation reduces oral health inequalities between the rich and poor, but the evidence is limited. There is anecdotal but not scientific evidence that fluoride allows more time for dental treatment by slowing the progression of tooth decay, and that it simplifies treatment by causing most cavities to occur in pits and fissures of teeth. Other reviews have found not enough evidence to determine if water fluoridation reduces oral-health social disparities.

Health and dental organizations worldwide have endorsed its safety and effectiveness at recommended levels. Its use began in 1945, following studies of children in a region where higher levels of fluoride occur naturally in the water. Further research showed that moderate fluoridation prevents tooth decay.

== Implementation ==
Fluoridation does not affect the appearance, taste, or smell of drinking water. It is normally accomplished by adding one of three compounds to the water: sodium fluoride, fluorosilicic acid, or sodium fluorosilicate.
* Sodium fluoride (NaF) was the first compound used and is the reference standard. It is a white, odorless powder or crystal; the crystalline form is preferred if manual handling is used, as it minimizes dust. It is more expensive than the other compounds, but is easily handled and is usually used by smaller utility companies. It is toxic in gram quantities by ingestion or inhalation.
* Fluorosilicic acid (H2SiF6) is the most commonly used additive for water fluoridation in the United States. It is an inexpensive liquid by-product of phosphate fertilizer manufacture. It comes in varying strengths, typically 23–25%; because it contains so much water, shipping can be expensive. It is also known as hexafluorosilicic, hexafluosilicic, hydrofluosilicic, and silicofluoric acid.
* Sodium fluorosilicate (Na2SiF6) is the sodium salt of fluorosilicic acid. It is a powder or very fine crystal that is easier to ship than fluorosilicic acid. It is also known as sodium silicofluoride.

These compounds were chosen for their solubility, safety, availability, and low cost. A 1992 census found that, for U.S. public water supply systems reporting the type of compound used, 63% of the population received water fluoridated with fluorosilicic acid, 28% with sodium fluorosilicate, and 9% with sodium fluoride.

===Recommendations===
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention developed recommendations for water fluoridation that specify requirements for personnel, reporting, training, inspection, monitoring, surveillance, and actions in case of overfeed, along with technical requirements for each major compound used.

Although fluoride was once considered an essential nutrient, the U.S. National Research Council has since removed this designation due to the lack of studies showing it is essential for human growth, though still considering fluoride a &quot;beneficial element&quot; due to its positive impact on oral health. The European Food Safety Authority&#x27;s Panel on Dietetic Products, Nutrition and Allergies (NDA) considers fluoride not to be an essential nutrient, yet, due to the beneficial effects of dietary fluoride on prevention of dental caries they have defined an Adequate Intake (AI) value for it. The AI of fluoride from all sources (including non-dietary sources) is 0.05 mg/kg body weight per day for both children and adults, including pregnant and lactating women.

In 2011, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) lowered the recommended level of fluoride to 0.7 mg/L. In 2015, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), based on the recommendation of the U.S. Public Health Service (PHS) for fluoridation of community water systems, recommended that bottled water manufacturers limit fluoride in bottled water to no more than 0.7 milligrams per liter (mg/L; equivalent to parts per million).

Previous recommendations were based on evaluations from 1962, when the U.S. specified the optimal level of fluoride to range from 0.7 to 1.2 mg/L, depending on the average maximum daily air temperature; the optimal level is lower in warmer climates, where people drink more water, and is higher in cooler climates.

These standards are not appropriate for all parts of the world, where fluoride levels might be excessive and fluoride should be removed from water, and is based on assumptions that have become obsolete with the rise of air conditioning and increased use of soft drinks, ultra-processed food, fluoridated toothpaste, and other sources of fluorides. In 2011, the World Health Organization stated that 1.5 mg/L should be an absolute upper bound and that 0.5 mg/L may be an appropriate lower limit. A 2007 Australian systematic review recommended a range from 0.6 to 1.1 mg/L.


===Occurrences===
Fluoride naturally occurring in water can be above, at, or below recommended levels. Rivers and lakes generally contain fluoride levels less than 0.5 mg/L, but groundwater, particularly in volcanic or mountainous areas, can contain as much as 50 mg/L. Higher concentrations of fluorine are found in alkaline volcanic, hydrothermal, sedimentary, and other rocks derived from highly evolved magmas and hydrothermal solutions, and this fluorine dissolves into nearby water as fluoride. In most drinking waters, over 95% of total fluoride is the F− ion, with the magnesium–fluoride complex (MgF+) being the next most common. Because fluoride levels in water are usually controlled by the solubility of fluorite (CaF2), high natural fluoride levels are associated with calcium-deficient, alkaline, and soft waters. Defluoridation is needed when the naturally occurring fluoride level exceeds recommended limits. It can be accomplished by percolating water through granular beds of activated alumina, bone meal, bone char, or tricalcium phosphate; by coagulation with alum; or by precipitation with lime.

Pitcher or faucet-mounted water filters do not alter fluoride content; the more-expensive reverse osmosis filters remove 65–95% of fluoride, and distillation removes all fluoride. Some bottled waters contain undeclared fluoride, which can be present naturally in source waters, or if water is sourced from a public supply which has been fluoridated. The FDA states that bottled water products labeled as de-ionized, purified, demineralized, or distilled have been treated in such a way that they contain no or only trace amounts of fluoride, unless they specifically list fluoride as an added ingredient.

== Evidence ==
Existing evidence suggests that water fluoridation reduces tooth decay. Consistent evidence also suggests that it causes dental fluorosis, most of which is mild and not usually of aesthetic concern. No clear evidence of other adverse effects exists, though almost all research thereof has been of poor quality.

=== Effectiveness ===
Reviews have shown that water fluoridation reduces cavities in children. A conclusion for the efficacy in adults is less clear with some reviews finding benefit and others not. Studies in the U.S. in the 1950s and 1960s showed that water fluoridation reduced childhood cavities by fifty to sixty percent, while studies in 1989 and 1990 showed lower reductions (40% and 18% respectively), likely due to increasing use of fluoride from other sources, notably toothpaste, and also the &#x27;halo effect&#x27; of food and drink that is made in fluoridated areas and consumed in unfluoridated ones.

A 2000 UK systematic review (York) found that water fluoridation was associated with a decreased proportion of children with cavities of 15% and with a decrease in decayed, missing, and filled primary teeth (average decreases was 2.25 teeth). The review found that the evidence was of moderate quality: few studies attempted to reduce observer bias, control for confounding factors, report variance measures, or use appropriate analysis. Although no major differences between natural and artificial fluoridation were apparent, the evidence was inadequate for a conclusion about any differences. A 2007 Australian systematic review used the same inclusion criteria as York&#x27;s, plus one additional study. This did not affect the York conclusions. A 2011 European Commission systematic review based its efficacy on York&#x27;s review conclusion. A 2015 Cochrane systematic review estimated a reduction in cavities when water fluoridation was used by children who had no access to other sources of fluoride to be 35% in baby teeth and 26% in permanent teeth. The evidence was of poor quality. A 2020 study in the &quot;Journal of Political Economy&quot; found that water fluoridation significantly improved dental health and labor market outcomes, but had non-significant effects on cognitive ability.

Fluoride may also prevent cavities in adults of all ages. A 2007 meta-analysis by CDC researchers found that water fluoridation prevented an estimated 27% of cavities in adults, about the same fraction as prevented by exposure to any delivery method of fluoride (29% average). A 2011 European Commission review found that the benefits of water fluoridation for adult in terms of reductions in decay are limited. A 2015 Cochrane review found no conclusive research regarding the effectiveness of water fluoridation in adults. A 2016 review found variable quality evidence that, overall, stopping of community water fluoridation programs was typically followed by an increase in cavities.

Most countries in Europe have experienced substantial declines in cavities without the use of water fluoridation due to the introduction of fluoridated toothpaste and the large use of other fluoride-containing products, including mouthrinse, dietary supplements, and professionally applied or prescribed gel, foam, or varnish. For example, in Finland and Germany, tooth decay rates remained stable or continued to decline after water fluoridation stopped in communities with widespread fluoride exposure from other sources. Fluoridation is however still clearly necessary in the U.S. because unlike most European countries, the U.S. does not have school-based dental care, many children do not visit a dentist regularly, and for many U.S. children water fluoridation is the primary source of exposure to fluoride. The effectiveness of water fluoridation can vary according to circumstances such as whether preventive dental care is free to all children.

=== Fluorosis ===
Fluoride&#x27;s adverse effects depend on total fluoride dosage from all sources. At the commonly recommended dosage, the only clear adverse effect is dental fluorosis, which can alter the appearance of children&#x27;s teeth during tooth development; this is mostly mild and is unlikely to represent any real effect on aesthetic appearance or on public health. In April 2015, recommended fluoride levels in the United States were changed to 0.7 ppm from 0.7–1.2 ppm to reduce the risk of dental fluorosis. The 2015 Cochrane review estimated that for a fluoride level of 0.7 ppm the percentage of participants with fluorosis of aesthetic concern was approximately 12%. This increases to 40% when considering fluorosis of any level not of aesthetic concern. In the US mild or very mild dental fluorosis has been reported in 20% of the population, moderate fluorosis in 2% and severe fluorosis in less than 1%.

The critical period of exposure is between ages one and four years, with the risk ending around age eight. Fluorosis can be prevented by monitoring all sources of fluoride, with fluoridated water directly or indirectly responsible for an estimated 40% of risk and other sources, notably toothpaste, responsible for the remaining 60%. Compared to water naturally fluoridated at 0.4 mg/L, fluoridation to 1 mg/L is estimated to cause additional fluorosis in one of every 6 people (95% CI 4–21 people), and to cause additional fluorosis of aesthetic concern in one of every 22 people (95% CI 13.6–∞ people). Here, &quot;aesthetic concern&quot; is a term used in a standardized scale based on what adolescents would find unacceptable, as measured by a 1996 study of British 14-year-olds. In many industrialized countries the prevalence of fluorosis is increasing even in unfluoridated communities, mostly because of fluoride from swallowed toothpaste. A 2009 systematic review indicated that fluorosis is associated with consumption of infant formula or of water added to reconstitute the formula, that the evidence was distorted by publication bias, and that the evidence that the formula&#x27;s fluoride caused the fluorosis was weak. In the U.S. the decline in tooth decay was accompanied by increased fluorosis in both fluoridated and unfluoridated communities; accordingly, fluoride has been reduced in various ways worldwide in infant formulas, children&#x27;s toothpaste, water, and fluoride-supplement schedules.

=== Safety ===
In 2024, the National Toxicology Program (NTP), a division of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, published a systematic review evaluating fluoride exposure&#x27;s impact on neurodevelopment and cognition. This systematic analysis synthesized data from 72 human studies, prioritizing high-quality evidence, including 18 studies demonstrating a consistent association between increased fluoride exposure and lower IQ in children. The strongest evidence emerged from areas with drinking water fluoride concentrations exceeding 1.5 mg/L, the World Health Organization&#x27;s guideline for safe consumption. Notably, the analysis identified prenatal and early childhood exposure as periods of heightened vulnerability, with findings indicating that maternal fluoride intake during pregnancy was significantly correlated with reduced IQ in offspring. These findings suggest that cumulative fluoride exposure, encompassing sources such as drinking water, food, and dental products, could contribute to adverse neurodevelopmental outcomes.

Mechanistic studies were inadequate to determine a plausible biological mechanism or establish causation. The NTP concluded with moderate confidence that cumulative fluoride exposure is associated with lower IQ in children, emphasizing the necessity of revisiting fluoride exposure thresholds, particularly in vulnerable populations.

Building on these findings, a 2025 JAMA systematic review and meta-analysis of 74 studies across 12 countries provided further evidence of fluoride’s neurotoxicity, showing significant dose-response associations between fluoride exposure and reduced IQ in children. Even at urinary fluoride concentrations below the WHO’s 1.5 mg/L guideline, the review found consistent IQ reductions, even when restricting to studies with low risk of bias. Notably, for every 1 mg/L increase in urinary fluoride, IQ scores dropped by an average of 1.14 points. The authors noted that even small IQ shifts at the population level, as seen with other neurotoxicants, can significantly increase the number of individuals classified as intellectually disabled, with a 5-point drop nearly doubling this figure.

A 2019 Canadian study included in the NTP&#x27;s review found a dose-dependent relationship between maternal urinary fluoride levels and child IQ, identifying a 4.5-point decrease in IQ for every 1 mg/L increase in maternal fluoride levels during pregnancy. This study highlighted male-specific vulnerability to fluoride&#x27;s neurodevelopmental impacts, reinforcing concerns about prenatal exposure. More recently, a 2023 study extended these findings by identifying significant IQ reductions at maternal urinary fluoride concentrations as low as 0.45 mg/L, with effects evident even at levels below the WHO&#x27;s guideline of 1.5 mg/L. These findings raise concerns about the safety of current fluoride standards, including the U.S. water fluoridation level of 0.7 mg/L, for pregnant women and their developing children.

Fluoridation has little effect on risk of bone fracture (broken bones); it may result in slightly lower fracture risk than either excessively high levels of fluoridation or no fluoridation.

There is no clear association between water fluoridation and cancer or deaths due to cancer, both for cancer in general and also specifically for bone cancer and osteosarcoma. Series of research concluded that concentration of fluoride in water does not associate with osteosarcoma. The beliefs regarding association of fluoride exposure and osteosarcoma stem from a study from the NTP in 1990, which showed uncertain evidence of association of fluoride and osteosarcoma in male rats. But there is still no solid evidence of cancer-causing tendency of fluoride in mice. Fluoridation of water has been practiced around the world to improve citizens&#x27; dental health. It is also deemed as major health success. Fluoride concentration levels in water supplies are regulated, such as United States Environmental Protection Agency regulates fluoride levels to not be greater than 4 milligrams per liter. Actually, water supplies already have natural occurring fluoride, but many communities chose to add more fluoride to the point that it can reduce tooth decay. Fluoride is also known for its ability to cause new bone formation. Yet, further research shows no osteosarcoma risks from fluoridated water in humans. Most of the research involved counting number of osteosarcoma patients cases in particular areas which has difference concentrations of fluoride in drinking water. The statistic analysis of the data shows no significant difference in occurrences of osteosarcoma cases in different fluoridated regions. Another important research involved collecting bone samples from osteosarcoma patients to measure fluoride concentration and compare them to bone samples of newly diagnosed malignant bone tumors. The result is that the median fluoride concentrations in bone samples of osteosarcoma patients and tumor controls are not significantly different. Fluoride exposures of osteosarcoma patients are also proven to be not significantly different from healthy people. More recent studies have disputed any relationship to consumption of fluoridated drinking water during childhood.

Fluoride can occur naturally in water in concentrations well above recommended levels, which can have several long-term adverse effects, including severe dental fluorosis, skeletal fluorosis, and weakened bones; water utilities in the developed world reduce fluoride levels to regulated maximum levels in regions where natural levels are high, and the WHO and other groups work with countries and regions in the developing world with naturally excessive fluoride levels to achieve safe levels. The World Health Organization recommends a guideline maximum fluoride value of 1.5 mg/L as a level at which fluorosis should be minimal.

In rare cases improper implementation of water fluoridation can result in overfluoridation that causes outbreaks of acute fluoride poisoning, with symptoms that include nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. Three such outbreaks were reported in the U.S. between 1991 and 1998, caused by fluoride concentrations as high as 220 mg/L; in the 1992 Alaska outbreak, 262 people became ill and one person died. In 2010, approximately 60 gallons of fluoride were released into the water supply in Asheboro, North Carolina in 90 minutes—an amount that was intended to be released in a 24-hour period.

Like other common water additives such as chlorine, hydrofluosilicic acid and sodium silicofluoride decrease pH and cause a small increase of corrosivity, but this problem is easily addressed by increasing the pH. Although it has been hypothesized that hydrofluosilicic acid and sodium silicofluoride might increase human lead uptake from water, a 2006 statistical analysis did not support concerns that these chemicals cause higher blood lead concentrations in children. Trace levels of arsenic and lead may be present in fluoride compounds added to water, but no credible evidence exists that their presence is of concern: concentrations are below measurement limits.

The effect of water fluoridation on the natural environment has been investigated, and although some claim that no adverse effects have been established, other items find evidence of harm or of concern. Issues studied have included fluoride concentrations in groundwater and downstream rivers; lawns, gardens, and plants; consumption of plants grown in fluoridated water; air emissions; and equipment noise.

== Mechanism ==
Fluoride exerts its major effect by interfering with the demineralization mechanism of tooth decay. Tooth decay is an infectious disease, the key feature of which is an increase within dental plaque of bacteria such as &quot;Streptococcus mutans&quot; and &quot;Lactobacillus&quot;. These produce organic acids when carbohydrates, especially sugar, are eaten. When enough acid is produced to lower the pH below 5.5, the acid dissolves carbonated hydroxyapatite, the main component of tooth enamel, in a process known as &quot;demineralization&quot;. After the sugar is gone, some of the mineral loss can be recovered—or &quot;remineralized&quot;—from ions dissolved in the saliva. Cavities result when the rate of demineralization exceeds the rate of remineralization, typically in a process that requires many months or years.
All fluoridation methods, including water fluoridation, create low levels of fluoride ions in saliva and plaque fluid, thus exerting a topical or surface effect. A person living in an area with fluoridated water may experience rises of fluoride concentration in saliva to about 0.04 mg/L several times during a day. Technically, this fluoride does not prevent cavities but rather controls the rate at which they develop. When fluoride ions are present in plaque fluid along with dissolved hydroxyapatite, and the pH is higher than 4.5, a fluorapatite-like remineralized veneer is formed over the remaining surface of the enamel; this veneer is much more acid-resistant than the original hydroxyapatite, and is formed more quickly than ordinary remineralized enamel would be. The cavity-prevention effect of fluoride is mostly due to these surface effects, which occur during and after tooth eruption. Although some systemic (whole-body) fluoride returns to the saliva via blood plasma, and to unerupted teeth via plasma or crypt fluid, there is little data to determine what percentages of fluoride&#x27;s anticavity effect comes from these systemic mechanisms. Also, although fluoride affects the physiology of dental bacteria, its effect on bacterial growth does not seem to be relevant to cavity prevention.

Fluoride&#x27;s effects depend on the total daily intake of fluoride from all sources. About 70–90% of ingested fluoride is absorbed into the blood, where it distributes throughout the body. In infants 80–90% of absorbed fluoride is retained, with the rest excreted, mostly via urine; in adults about 60% is retained. About 99% of retained fluoride is stored in bone, teeth, and other calcium-rich areas, where excess quantities can cause fluorosis. Drinking water is typically the largest source of fluoride. In many industrialized countries swallowed toothpaste is the main source of fluoride exposure in unfluoridated communities. Other sources include dental products other than toothpaste; air pollution from fluoride-containing coal or from phosphate fertilizers; trona, used to tenderize meat in Tanzania; and tea leaves, particularly the tea bricks favored in parts of China. High fluoride levels have been found in other foods, including barley, cassava, corn, rice, taro, yams, and fish protein concentrate. The U.S. Institute of Medicine has established Dietary Reference Intakes for fluoride: Adequate Intake values range from 0.01 mg/day for infants aged 6 months or less, to 4 mg/day for men aged 19 years and up; and the Tolerable Upper Intake Level is 0.10 mg/kg/day for infants and children through age 8 years, and 10 mg/day thereafter. A rough estimate is that an adult in a temperate climate consumes 0.6 mg/day of fluoride without fluoridation, and 2 mg/day with fluoridation. However, these values differ greatly among the world&#x27;s regions: for example, in Sichuan, China the average daily fluoride intake is only 0.1 mg/day in drinking water but 8.9 mg/day in food and 0.7 mg/day directly from the air due to the use of high-fluoride soft coal for cooking and drying foodstuffs indoors.

== Alternatives ==
The views on the most effective method for community prevention of tooth decay are mixed. The Australian government review states that water fluoridation is the most effective means of achieving fluoride exposure that is community-wide. The European Commission review states &quot;No obvious advantage appears in favour of water fluoridation compared with topical prevention&quot;. Other fluoride therapies are also effective in preventing tooth decay; they include fluoride toothpaste, mouthwash, gel, and varnish, and fluoridation of salt and milk. Dental sealants are effective as well, with estimates of prevented cavities ranging from 33% to 86%, depending on age of sealant and type of study.

Fluoride toothpaste is the most widely used and rigorously evaluated fluoride treatment. Its introduction is considered the main reason for the decline in tooth decay in industrialized countries, and toothpaste appears to be the single common factor in countries where tooth decay has declined. Toothpaste is the only realistic fluoride strategy in many low-income countries, where lack of infrastructure renders water or salt fluoridation infeasible. It relies on individual and family behavior, and its use is less likely among lower economic classes; in low-income countries it is unaffordable for the poor. Fluoride toothpaste prevents about 25% of cavities in young permanent teeth, and its effectiveness is improved if higher concentrations of fluoride are used, or if the toothbrushing is supervised. Fluoride mouthwash and gel are about as effective as fluoride toothpaste; fluoride varnish prevents about 45% of cavities. By comparison, brushing with a nonfluoride toothpaste has little effect on cavities.

The effectiveness of salt fluoridation is about the same as that of water fluoridation, if most salt for human consumption is fluoridated. Fluoridated salt reaches the consumer in salt at home, in meals at school and at large kitchens, and in bread. For example, Jamaica has just one salt producer, but a complex public water supply; it started fluoridating all salt in 1987, achieving a decline in cavities. Universal salt fluoridation is also practiced in Colombia and the Swiss Canton of Vaud; in Germany fluoridated salt is widely used in households but unfluoridated salt is also available, giving consumers a choice. Concentrations of fluoride in salt range from 90 to 350 mg/kg, with studies suggesting an optimal concentration of around 250 mg/kg.

Milk fluoridation is practiced by the Borrow Foundation in some parts of Bulgaria, Chile, Peru, Russia, Macedonia, Thailand and the UK. Depending on location, the fluoride is added to milk, to powdered milk, or to yogurt. For example, milk powder fluoridation is used in rural Chilean areas where water fluoridation is not technically feasible. These programs are aimed at children, and have neither targeted nor been evaluated for adults. A systematic review found low-quality evidence to support the practice, but also concluded that further studies were needed.

Other public-health strategies to control tooth decay, such as education to change behavior and diet, have lacked impressive results. Although fluoride is the only well-documented agent which controls the rate at which cavities develop, it has been suggested that adding calcium to the water would reduce cavities further. Other agents to prevent tooth decay include antibacterials such as chlorhexidine and sugar substitutes such as xylitol. Xylitol-sweetened chewing gum has been recommended as a supplement to fluoride and other conventional treatments if the gum is not too costly. Two proposed approaches, bacteria replacement therapy (probiotics) and caries vaccine, would share water fluoridation&#x27;s advantage of requiring only minimal patient compliance, but have not been proven safe and effective. Other experimental approaches include fluoridated sugar, polyphenols, and casein phosphopeptide–amorphous calcium phosphate nanocomplexes.

A 2007 Australian review concluded that water fluoridation is the most effective and socially the most equitable way to expose entire communities to fluoride&#x27;s cavity-prevention effects. A 2002 U.S. review estimated that sealants decreased cavities by about 60% overall, compared to about 18–50% for fluoride. A 2007 Italian review suggested that water fluoridation may not be needed, particularly in the industrialized countries where cavities have become rare, and concluded that toothpaste and other topical fluoride are the best way to prevent cavities worldwide. A 2004 World Health Organization review stated that water fluoridation, when it is culturally acceptable and technically feasible, has substantial advantages in preventing tooth decay, especially for subgroups at high risk.

== Worldwide prevalence ==
As of November 2012, a total of about 378 million people worldwide received artificially fluoridated water. The majority of those were in the United States. About 40 million worldwide received water that was naturally fluoridated to recommended levels.

Much of the early work on establishing the connection between fluoride and dental health was performed by scientists in the U.S. during the early 20th century, and the U.S. was the first country to implement public water fluoridation on a wide scale. It has been introduced to varying degrees in many countries and territories outside the U.S., including Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Canada, Chile, Colombia, Hong Kong, Ireland, Israel, Korea, Malaysia, New Zealand, the Philippines, Serbia, Singapore, Spain, the UK, and Vietnam. In 2004, an estimated 13.7 million people in western Europe and 194 million in the U.S. received artificially fluoridated water. In 2010, about 66% of the U.S. population was receiving fluoridated water.

Naturally fluoridated water is used by approximately 4% of the world&#x27;s population, in countries including Argentina, France, Gabon, Libya, Mexico, Senegal, Sri Lanka, Tanzania, the U.S., and Zimbabwe. In some locations, notably parts of Africa, China, and India, natural fluoridation exceeds recommended levels.

Communities have discontinued water fluoridation in some countries, including Finland, Germany, Japan, the Netherlands, and Switzerland. Changes have been motivated by political opposition to water fluoridation, but sometimes the need for water fluoridation was met by alternative strategies. The use of fluoride in its various forms is the foundation of tooth decay prevention throughout Europe; several countries have introduced fluoridated salt, with varying success: in Switzerland and Germany, fluoridated salt represents 65% to 70% of the domestic market, while in France the market share reached 60% in 1993 but dwindled to 14% in 2009; Spain, in 1986 the second West European country to introduce fluoridation of table salt, reported a market share in 2006 of only 10%. In three other West European countries, Greece, Austria and the Netherlands, the legal framework for production and marketing of fluoridated edible salt exists. At least six Central European countries (Hungary, Czechia, Slovakia, Croatia, Slovenia, Romania) have shown some interest in salt fluoridation; however, significant usage of approximately 35% was only achieved in the Czech Republic. The Slovak Republic had the equipment to treat salt by 2005; in the other four countries attempts to introduce fluoridated salt were not successful. Additionally, concerns regarding potential overexposure to fluoride and the varying effectiveness of fluoridation methods have led some countries to reassess their approaches. Recent evaluations highlight a preference for topical fluoride applications, which are considered more effective and safer, especially given the limited systemic benefits of fluoridation beyond early childhood. When Israel implemented the 2014 Dental Health Promotion Program, that includes education, medical followup and the use of fluoride-containing products and supplements, it evaluated that mandatory water fluoridation was no longer necessary, stating &quot;supply of fluoridated water forces those who do not so wish to also consume water with added fluoride. This approach is therefore not accepted in most countries in the world.&quot;.

== History ==

The history of water fluoridation can be divided into three periods. The first () was research into the cause of a form of mottled tooth enamel called the Colorado brown stain. The second (–1945) focused on the relationship between fluoride concentrations, fluorosis, and tooth decay, and established that moderate levels of fluoride prevent cavities. The third period, from 1945 on, focused on adding fluoride to community water supplies.

In the first half of the 19th century, investigators established that fluoride occurs with varying concentrations in teeth, bone, and drinking water. In the second half they speculated that fluoride would protect against tooth decay, proposed supplementing the diet with fluoride, and observed mottled enamel (now called severe dental fluorosis) without knowing the cause. In 1874, the German public health officer Carl Wilhelm Eugen Erhardt recommended potassium fluoride supplements to preserve teeth. In 1892, the British physician James Crichton-Browne suggested that the shift to refined flour, which reduced the consumption of grain husks and stems, led to fluorine&#x27;s absence from diets and teeth that were &quot;peculiarly liable to decay&quot;. He proposed &quot;the reintroduction into our diet ... of fluorine in some suitable natural form ... to fortify the teeth of the next generation&quot;.

The foundation of water fluoridation in the U.S. was the research of the dentist Frederick McKay (1874–1959). McKay spent thirty years investigating the cause of what was then known as the Colorado brown stain, which produced mottled but also cavity-free teeth; with the help of G.V. Black and other researchers, he established that the cause was fluoride. The first report of a statistical association between the stain and lack of tooth decay was made by UK dentist Norman Ainsworth in 1925. In 1931, an Alcoa chemist, H.V. Churchill, concerned about a possible link between aluminum and staining, analyzed water from several areas where the staining was common and found that fluoride was the common factor.

In the 1930s and early 1940s, H. Trendley Dean and colleagues at the newly created U.S. National Institutes of Health published several epidemiological studies suggesting that a fluoride concentration of about 1 mg/L was associated with substantially fewer cavities in temperate climates, and that it increased fluorosis but only to a level that was of no medical or aesthetic concern. Other studies found no other significant adverse effects even in areas with fluoride levels as high as 8 mg/L. To test the hypothesis that adding fluoride would prevent cavities, Dean and his colleagues conducted a controlled experiment by fluoridating the water in Grand Rapids, Michigan, starting 25 January 1945. The results, published in 1950, showed significant reduction of cavities. Significant reductions in tooth decay were also reported by important early studies outside the U.S., including the Brantford–Sarnia–Stratford study in Canada (1945–1962), the Tiel–Culemborg study in the Netherlands (1953–1969), the Hastings study in New Zealand (1954–1970), and the Department of Health study in the U.K. (1955–1960). By present-day standards these and other pioneering studies were crude, but the large reductions in cavities convinced public health professionals of the benefits of fluoridation.

Fluoridation became an official policy of the U.S. Public Health Service by 1951, and by 1960 water fluoridation had become widely used in the U.S., reaching about 50 million people. By 2006, 69.2% of the U.S. population on public water systems were receiving fluoridated water, amounting to 61.5% of the total U.S. population; 3.0% of the population on public water systems were receiving naturally occurring fluoride. In some other countries the pattern was similar. New Zealand, which led the world in per-capita sugar consumption and had the world&#x27;s worst teeth, began fluoridation in 1953, and by 1968 fluoridation was used by 65% of the population served by a piped water supply. Fluoridation was introduced into Brazil in 1953, was regulated by federal law starting in 1974, and by 2004 was used by 71% of the population. In the Republic of Ireland, fluoridation was legislated in 1960, and after a constitutional challenge the two major cities of Dublin and Cork began it in 1964; fluoridation became required for all sizeable public water systems and by 1996 reached 66% of the population. In other locations, fluoridation was used and then discontinued: in Kuopio, Finland, fluoridation was used for decades but was discontinued because the school dental service provided significant fluoride programs and the cavity risk was low, and in Basel, Switzerland, it was replaced with fluoridated salt.

McKay&#x27;s work had established that fluorosis occurred before tooth eruption. Dean and his colleagues assumed that fluoride&#x27;s protection against cavities was also pre-eruptive, and this incorrect assumption was accepted for years. By 2000, however, the topical effects of fluoride (in both water and toothpaste) were well understood, and it had become known that a constant low level of fluoride in the mouth works best to prevent cavities.

== Economics ==
Fluoridation costs an estimated $ per person-year on the average (range: $–$; all costs in this paragraph are for the U.S. and are in dollars, inflation-adjusted from earlier estimates). Larger water systems have lower per capita cost, and the cost is also affected by the number of fluoride injection points in the water system, the type of feeder and monitoring equipment, the fluoride chemical and its transportation and storage, and water plant personnel expertise. In affluent countries the cost of salt fluoridation is also negligible; developing countries may find it prohibitively expensive to import the fluoride additive. By comparison, fluoride toothpaste costs an estimated $–$ per person-year, with the incremental cost being zero for people who already brush their teeth for other reasons; and dental cleaning and application of fluoride varnish or gel costs an estimated $ per person-year. Assuming the worst case, with the lowest estimated effectiveness and highest estimated operating costs for small cities, fluoridation costs an estimated $–$ per saved tooth-decay surface, which is lower than the estimated $ to restore the surface and the estimated $ average discounted lifetime cost of the decayed surface, which includes the cost to maintain the restored tooth surface. It is not known how much is spent in industrial countries to treat dental fluorosis, which is mostly due to fluoride from swallowed toothpaste.

Although a 1989 workshop on cost-effectiveness of cavity prevention concluded that water fluoridation is one of the few public health measures that save more money than they cost, little high-quality research has been done on the cost-effectiveness and solid data are scarce. Dental sealants are cost-effective only when applied to high-risk children and teeth. A 2002 U.S. review estimated that on average, sealing first permanent molars saves costs when they are decaying faster than 0.47 surfaces per person-year whereas water fluoridation saves costs when total decay incidence exceeds 0.06 surfaces per person-year. In the U.S., water fluoridation is more cost-effective than other methods to reduce tooth decay in children, and a 2008 review concluded that water fluoridation is the best tool for combating cavities in many countries, particularly among socially disadvantaged groups. A 2016 review of studies published between 1995 and 2013 found that water fluoridation in the U.S. was cost-effective, and that it was more so in larger communities.

U.S. data from 1974 to 1992 indicate that when water fluoridation is introduced into a community, there are significant decreases in the number of employees per dental firm and the number of dental firms. The data suggest that some dentists respond to the demand shock by moving to non-fluoridated areas and by retraining as specialists.

== Controversy ==

The water fluoridation controversy arises from political, moral, ethical, economic, and safety concerns regarding the water fluoridation of public water supplies. For impoverished groups in both developing and developed countries, international and national agencies and dental associations across the world support the safety and effectiveness of water fluoridation. Authorities&#x27; views on the most effective fluoride therapy for community prevention of tooth decay are mixed; some state water fluoridation is most effective, while others see no special advantage and prefer topical application strategies.

Those opposed argue that water fluoridation has no or little cariostatic benefits, may cause serious health problems, is not effective enough to justify the costs, is pharmacologically obsolete, and presents a moral conflict between the common good and individual rights.

<text>A piebald or pied animal is one that has a pattern of unpigmented spots (white) on a pigmented background of hair, feathers or scales. Thus a piebald black and white dog is a black dog with white spots. The animal&#x27;s skin under the white background is not pigmented.

Location of the unpigmented spots is dependent on the migration of melanoblasts (primordial pigment cells) from the neural crest to paired bilateral locations in the skin of the early embryo. The resulting pattern appears symmetrical only if melanoblasts migrate to both locations of a pair and proliferate to the same degree in both locations. The appearance of symmetry can be obliterated if the proliferation of the melanocytes (pigment cells) within the developing spots is so great that the sizes of the spots increase to the point that some of the spots merge, leaving only small areas of the white background among the spots and at the tips of the extremities.

Animals with this pattern may include birds, cats, cattle, dogs, foxes, horses, cetaceans, deer, pigs, and snakes. Some animals also exhibit colouration of the irises of the eye that match the surrounding skin (blue eyes for pink skin, brown for dark). The underlying genetic cause is related to a condition known as leucism.

In medieval English &quot;pied&quot; indicated alternating contrasting colours making up the quarters of an item of costume or livery device in heraldry.

==Etymology==
The word &quot;piebald&quot; originates from a combination of &quot;pie,&quot; from &quot;magpie&quot;, and &quot;bald&quot;, meaning &quot;white patch&quot; or spot. The reference is to the distinctive black-and-white plumage of the magpie.

==Horses==

In British English &quot;piebald&quot; (black and white) and &quot;skewbald&quot; (white and any colour other than black) are together known as &quot;coloured&quot;. In North American English, the term for this colouring pattern is pinto, with the specialized term &quot;paint&quot; referring specifically to a breed of horse with American Quarter Horse or Thoroughbred bloodlines in addition to being spotted, whereas &quot;pinto&quot; refers to a spotted horse of any breed. In American usage, horse enthusiasts usually do not use the term &quot;piebald,&quot; but rather describe the colour shade of a pinto literally with terms such as &quot;black and white&quot; for a piebald, &quot;brown and white,&quot; or &quot;bay and white,&quot; for skewbalds, or color-specific modifiers such as &quot;bay pinto&quot;, &quot;sorrel pinto,&quot; &quot;buckskin pinto,&quot; and such.

Genetically, a piebald horse begins with a black base coat colour, and then the horse also has an allele for one of three basic spotting patterns overlaying the base colour. The most common coloured spotting pattern is called tobiano, and is a dominant gene. Tobiano creates spots that are large and rounded, usually with a somewhat vertical orientation, with white that usually crosses the back of the horse, white on the legs, with the head mostly dark. Three less common spotting genes are the sabino, frame, and splash overo genes, which create various patterns that are mostly dark, with jagged spotting, often with a horizontal orientation, white on the head. The frame variant has dark or minimally marked legs. The sabino pattern can be very minimal, usually adding white that runs up the legs onto the belly or flanks, with &quot;lacy&quot; or roaning at the edge of the white, plus white on the head that either extends past the eye, over the chin, or both. The genetics of overo and sabino are not yet fully understood, but they can appear in the offspring of two solid-coloured parents, whereas a tobiano must always have at least one tobiano parent.

==Dogs==
In many dog breeds the Piebald gene is common. The white parts of the fur interrupt the pigmented coat patterns. Dogs that may have a spotted or multicolored coat, are often called piebald if their body is almost entirely white or another solid color with spotting and patches on the head and neck. The allele is called sP on the S-locus and is localized with the MITF gene. It is recessive, therefore homozygous individuals show this coat pattern, whereas the heterozygous carriers can be of solid color. 
==Other animals==
Many other animal species may also be &quot;pied&quot; or piebald including, but not limited to, birds and squirrels. A piebald Eastern gray squirrel named Pinto Bean gained prominence at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign after many students shared pictures and videos of it online. Snakes, especially ball pythons and corn snakes, may also exhibit seemingly varying patches of completely pigmentless scales along with patches of pigmented scales. In 2013, a piebald blood python was discovered in Sumatra. Some domesticated silver foxes born from the Russian Institute of Cytology and Genetics also carry this coloring.

Bicolor cats carry the white spotting gene (incorrectly called the piebald gene). The same pattern that applies to cats also applies to dogs when the white spotting gene involved is indeed piebald and not another white-causing gene found in dogs. The piebald gene is also found in cows, ferrets, domestic goats, goldfish, guinea pigs, hamsters, rabbits, and fancy rats.
Holstein and Simmental breeds of cattle typically exhibit piebaldism.

<doc id="763651" wikidata="Q213722" url="?curid=763651" title="Maximilian von Montgelas">
<text>Maximilian Karl Joseph Franz de Paula Hieronymus de Garnerin de la Thuile, Count von Montgelas (; 12 September 1759 – 14 June 1838) was a Bavarian statesman, a member of a noble family from the Duchy of Savoy. His father John Sigmund Garnerin, Baron Montgelas (), entered the military service of Maximilian III, Elector of Bavaria, and married the Countess Ursula von Trauner. Maximilian Josef, their eldest son, was born in the Bavarian capital Munich on September 10, 1759.

== Early life ==
Montgelas was educated successively at Nancy, Strasbourg, and Ingolstadt. Being a Savoyard on his father&#x27;s side, he naturally felt the French influence, which was then strong in Germany, with peculiar force. To the end of his life he spoke and wrote French more correctly and with more ease than German. Nevertheless, the Munich-born Montgelas always wanted to be addressed as a Bavarian by nationality.

In 1779 he entered the public service in the department of the censorship of books. The Elector Charles Theodore, who had at first favored him, became offended on discovering that Montgelas was associated with the Illuminati, a secret society in Bavaria that held the most anti-clerical propositions of the Enlightenment. Montgelas therefore went to Zweibrücken, where he was helped by his brother Illuminati to find employment at the Court of the Duke, the head of a branch of the Wittelsbach family. From this refuge also he was driven by orthodox enemies of the Illuminati.

The brother of the Duke of Zweibrücken, Maximilian Joseph, took Montgelas into his service as a Private Secretary. When his employer succeeded to the Duchy, Montgelas was named a Minister, and in that capacity he attended the Second Congress of Rastatt in 1798, where the reconstruction of Germany, which was the consequence of the French Revolution, was in full swing.

== Minister in Bavaria ==
In 1799, the Duke of Zweibrücken succeeded to the throne of the Electorate of Bavaria, and he kept Montgelas as his most trusted adviser. He agreed the Treaty of Bogenhausen with France in August 1805, leading Bavaria to ally with Napoleonic France in the War of the Third Coalition. Montgelas was the inspirer and director of the policy by which in 1806 the Electorate was turned into a kingdom and was also greatly increased in size by the annexation of church lands, free towns, and small lordships, such as Wallerstein. As this end was achieved by undeviating servility to Napoleon, and by the most cynical disregard of the rights of Bavaria&#x27;s German-speaking neighbors, Montgelas became the type of an unpatriotic politician in the eyes of all Germans who revolted against the supremacy of France. From his own conduct and his written defence of his policy, it is clear that such sentiments as theirs appeared to Montgelas to be merely childish.

He was a thorough politician of the 18th century type, who saw and attempted to see nothing except that Bavaria had always been threatened by the house of Habsburg, had been supported by Prussia for purely selfish reasons, and could look for useful support against these two only from France, which had selfish reasons of her own for wishing to counterbalance the power both of Austria and Prussia in Germany. As late as 1813, when Napoleon&#x27;s power was visibly breaking down, and Montgelas knew the internal weakness of his empire well from visits to Paris, he still continued to maintain that France was necessary to Bavaria.

The decision of the king to turn against Napoleon in 1814 was taken under the influence of his son and of Marshal Wrede rather than of Montgelas, although the minister would not have been influenced by any feeling of sentimentality to adhere to an ally who had ceased to be useful. In internal affairs, Montgelas carried out a policy of secularization and of administrative centralization by determined means, which showed that he had never wholly renounced his opinions of the time of the Enlightenment movement.

In the field in interior politics he can be regarded as the most successful German politician of the early 19th century with a long list of achievements. Already in 1796, when the Duke of Zweibrücken (after the French advance towards Zweibrücken) was a landless prince exiled in Ansbach, Montgelas had developed a masterplan for the future modernisation of Bavaria. This lengthy paper, the &quot;Ansbacher mémoire&quot; was rediscovered in the 1960s and published in 1970 by the Bavarian historian Eberhard Weis, who also is Montgelas&#x27; biographer. After 1799 when Maximilian Joseph succeeded to the Electorate of Bavaria, Montgelas as his primary adviser and leading statesman very much followed his concept throughout the following years in a very uncompromising manner:

Montgelas enforced the taxation of the nobility and the clergy. Taxation went along with a complete economic description and measurement of Bavaria leading to an outstanding cadastral system. Montgelas passed the first modern constitution for Bavaria in 1808, which included the abolition of any relics of serfdom that had survived until then. Montgelas was responsible for the abolition of the torture in 1812 by introducing a new penal code based on contemporary humanitarian standards. He introduced compulsory school education, compulsory military service, compulsory vaccination. He reorganised the Bavarian administration by a centralised cabinet of modern ministries instead of a multitude of chambers. Montgelas was also responsible for the abolition of all tolls within the Kingdom of Bavaria thus enabling free trade within the country. And he designed and passed a regulation for civil servants, the &quot;Dienstpragmatik&quot;, which became a model for civil service in Germany as whole. According to its rules, admission to any service within the public administration was no longer dependent on whether one was Catholic or of noble family, but solely on the quality of one&#x27;s education. Thus Montgelas broke the preponderance of the nobility in the higher and decisive ranks of public administration. Civil servants were granted a sufficient salary and their widows a pension. Thus Montgelas refounded the civil service on new ethics and created a social group of servants loyal only to the crown and Kingdom of Bavaria.
In order to reduce the political and cultural influence of the Catholic Church in Bavaria in favor of the secular state, Montgelas extended civil rights, including citizenship, to Protestants. The Jewish communities were awarded a secure legal status, although there remained a discriminating special registration.

Along these lines, Montgelas secularized—that is seized for the use and benefit of the State—many Catholic land-holdings, most especially the Bavarian monasteries. Montgelas was attempting to sever the &quot;Mortmain&quot; that had driven the state to the treasury to the brink of financial ruin under Karl Theodor. According to principles of the Enlightenment and the Napoleonic reorganization of Europe, the expropriation of Church property and the suppression of Church institutions were essential steps to the modernization of the State. Since the earliest centuries of the Middle Ages, the monasteries had owned large stretches of land and governed the farmers working that land. Montgelas, again in keeping with principles of the Enlightenment and the Napoleonic reorganization of Europe that favored the establishment of absolute secular authority over against religion, eliminating such exercises of authority by and resources from church institutions was necessary. Monastic life as such was viewed by Montgelas, in keeping with the most religiously hostile forms of Enlightenment thinking, as useless, at best, and as a breeding ground of &quot;superstition.&quot;

In Montgelas&#x27;s eyes, any form of parliamentary representation was as dangerous to the modern state as was the Church. Even the powerless and highly plutocratic Parliament introduced by the constitution of 1808 practically never came into being. Montgelas himself declared, that the repeated wars prevented any convocation of the Parliament. In fact he preferred his status as a benevolent dictator and successfully evaded any control by any form of Parliament. Only after Montgelas&#x27; dismissal in 1817, the second introduced a real bicameral Parliament (to the standards of the era).

His enemies persuaded the king to dismiss him in 1817, and he spent the remainder of his life as a member of the Bavarian House of Lords (&quot;Kammer der Reichsräte&quot;) till his death in 1838.

He had married the Countess von Arco in 1803, and had eight children; in 1809 he was made a count. As a typical generous nobleman of the 18th century he allowed his very attractive wife to have her lovers and even invited some of them to his palace.

== Honors ==
In 2005 the Free State of Bavaria and the city of Munich erected a monument at Munich&#x27;s Promenadenplatz in his honor.

In 2009, his 250th birth anniversary has been celebrated with the creation of honorific &quot;Montgelas Prize&quot; (&quot;Montgelas-Preis&quot; in German), awarded each year to French leaders to acknowledge their actions in favor of French-German cooperation. It has been awarded to Jean Arthuis (Head of the Committee on Budgets in the European parliament), Philippe Richert (President of the Regional Council of Alsace) and Thierry Breton (CEO of Atos and former Minister of the Economy).

<text>Admiral Sir Ernest Frederick Augustus Gaunt, (25 March 1865 – 20 April 1940) was an Australian-born Royal Navy officer who went on to be Commander-in-Chief, Western Approaches.

==Naval career==
Gaunt was born in Beechworth, Victoria, Australia, the son of William Henry Gaunt and Elizabeth Mary Palmer. Gaunt joined the Royal Navy in 1878 at the age of 13. 

In 1881, he was a midshipman in HMS &quot;Wolverine&quot;, by 1891 he was a lieutenant on &quot;Belleisle&quot;, and by 1896 he was 1st Lieutenant on the armoured cruiser HMS &quot;Narcissus&quot;. Promoted to Commander on 30 June 1898, Gaunt was, in 1898 and 1899, 1st Commissioner for Weihawei and Administrator for Liukungtao, China. In 1900, he was Commissioner and Superintending transport officer Weihawei, China, at the time of the Boxer Rebellion. 

He was appointed a Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George (CMG) in the 1902 Coronation Honours list on 26 June 1902 for his services during the rebellion. In August 1901, he was appointed in command of the cruiser &quot;HMS Scout&quot;, which served with the Mediterranean Fleet and in June 1902 replaced HMS &quot;Harrier&quot; as special service vessel at Constantinople. The vessel visited Constanța, the main seaport of Romania, in October 1902, then travelled on the Danube to Galați. 

He transferred to HMS &quot;Mohawk&quot; in January 1903, as she replaced &quot;Scout&quot; on the Mediterranean station. In December 1903, he commanded a landing party from &quot;Mohawk&quot; at Durbo, on the coast of Italian Somaliland, where he was wounded. In 1905, as commander of , he took possession of the Ashmore Islands in the Indian Ocean on behalf of the United Kingdom.

<text>Timothy DuPron Hauser (December 12, 1941 – October 16, 2014) was a singer and founding member of the vocal group The Manhattan Transfer. He won 10 Grammy Awards as a member of The Manhattan Transfer.

==Early life==

Hauser was born in Troy, New York. When he was seven he moved with his family to the Jersey Shore, living in Wanamassa, Ocean Township, Monmouth County, and, later, in Asbury Park. He graduated in 1959 from St. Rose High School (Belmar), where an award in his name has been given every year since 1989 to students who excel in theater arts.

When he was fifteen, he began to sing professionally. He founded a doo-wop quartet named The Criterions. For the Cecilia label the Criterions recorded two singles: &quot;I Remain Truly Yours&quot; and &quot;Don&#x27;t Say Goodbye&quot;. The group appeared on the &quot;Big Beat Show&quot; hosted by Alan Freed.

In 1959, Hauser entered Villanova University. With Tommy West and Jim Ruf, both from The Criterions, he formed the folk group the Troubadours Three. He was a member of the Villanova Singers and the Villanova Spires/Coventry Lads with classmate Jim Croce. He spent four years on the staff of college radio station WWVU. In 1963, he graduated from Villanova with a degree in economics. In 1964, Hauser served in the United States Air Force and the New Jersey Air National Guard.

In 1965, he began his career in marketing. From 1965 to 1966, he worked as a market research analyst with the advertising agency Sullivan, Stauffer, Colwell, and Bayles. His accounts included Pepsodent Toothpaste (Lever Bros.), Micrin Mouthwash (Johnson &amp; Johnson), and Rise Shaving Cream (Carter Products). 

From 1966 to 1968, he worked as manager of the Market Research Department for the Special Products Division of Nabisco. His accounts included cereal and pet food.

==Music career==

In 1969, he formed the first version of The Manhattan Transfer with Gene Pistilli, Marty Nelson, Erin Dickins, and Pat Rosalia. The group had a jazz/R&amp;B sound and recorded one album, &quot;Jukin&#x27; &quot;, for Capitol Records under manager Richard Flanzer. This version of the group dissolved after one album.

Hauser drove a cab to support himself while pursuing a music career. Through this job, he met Laurel Massé, a waitress and aspiring singer. He was again driving his cab when he picked up the conga player for the group Laurel Canyon who invited him to a party where he met Janis Siegel. With Massé they reformed The Manhattan Transfer. They needed a male singer, so they contacted Alan Paul. The four became The Manhattan Transfer on October 1, 1972.

After a car accident, Massé decided to leave the group and pursue a solo career, and in 1978 Cheryl Bentyne was hired to replace her. From then until Hauser&#x27;s death, the line-up was mostly unchanged with only occasional substitutions due to illness. After his death, he was replaced by Trist Curless.

The Manhattan Transfer won the &quot;Downbeat&quot; and &quot;Playboy&quot; Readers&#x27; Polls every year in the 1980s for best vocal group. In 2007, they won the &quot;JazzTimes&quot; Readers&#x27; Poll for best vocal group. When Ahmet Ertegün founded the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, he selected Hauser to serve on the voting committee, a position he held for three years (1986–1989). In 1993, Hauser was awarded an honorary doctorate degree from the Berklee College of Music.

==Death==
Hauser died of cardiac arrest at the Robert Packer Hospital in Sayre, Pennsylvania, on October 16, 2014, at the age of 72. He had been admitted to the hospital for pneumonia.

<text>State Road 528 (SR 528), alternatively named the Martin Andersen Beachline Expressway (with parts previously named the Bee Line Expressway), is a partially-tolled freeway in the U.S. state of Florida; it is maintained by the Florida&#x27;s Turnpike Enterprise (FTE), the Central Florida Expressway Authority (CFX), and the Florida Department of Transportation (FDOT). Spanning approximately along a west–east axis, it connects Interstate 4 (I-4) in Orlando with I-95, Titusville, and Cape Canaveral on the Space Coast. It passes close to the tourist areas of Orlando, including SeaWorld and Universal Orlando, and serves the north entrance to Orlando International Airport. Near its east end, it passes over the Intracoastal Waterway on the Emory L. Bennett Causeway, and ends at SR A1A and SR 401 near Port Canaveral.

Martin Andersen, a retired publisher, used his influence to get the original stretch of road (from SR 520 to Orlando International Airport) built in the 1960s.

The entire Beachline is compatible with the SunPass, E-Pass, Peach Pass, NC Quick Pass, and E-ZPass electronic toll collection transponders on both mainline plazas and interchange tolls.

==Route description==

The westernmost of the Beachline Expressway, from I-4 to SR 482 near the airport, is known as the Beachline West Expressway and is FTE owned. The section of the expressway is most famous for providing the link for tourists between Orlando International Airport and Orlando area attractions such as SeaWorld and Universal Orlando, and Walt Disney World via I-4. The Beachline begins at an interchange with I-4 (exit 72), and heads east, with interchanges with the tourist-driven International Drive, Orangewood Boulevard, and John Young Parkway. The highway then jogs north to a massive combined interchange with Florida&#x27;s Turnpike and US 17/US 92/US 441 (Orange Blossom Trail) at exit 4; this interchange serves The Florida Mall to the north of the road. The section of the Beachline Expressway from exit 0 to exit 4, with the exception of the express lanes, is a &quot;free movement&quot; section, requiring no tolls. The expressway continues east to the Beachline West barrier toll and then to SR 482 (McCoy Road/Sand Lake Road) (exit 8), ending FTE maintenance at the northwest edge of the airport.

CFX maintenance begins at the northwest corner of the airport, with a free movement section between exits 8 and 9 (Tradeport Drive/Conway Road), followed by two airport-access interchanges with SR 436 and Goldenrod Road. The last of the Beachline&#x27;s free movement sections is between SR 436 and with SR 15 just east of the airport. east of the airport, it intersects with the SR 417 (Central Florida GreeneWay), heading out of Orlando, with the road straightening out as a beeline for the rest of its journey in Orange County. From the GreeneWay to I-95, the Beachline Expressway travels through mostly uninhabited marshlands. It intersects with a barrier toll just east of the GreeneWay, and has interchanges with Innovation Way and Dallas Boulevard, followed by one more barrier toll. East of the toll plaza, SR 528 reaches SR 520, the last interchange before the Orange–Brevard county line, ending CFX maintenance and tolls.

Turnpike maintenance begins at the eastern end of the SR 520 interchange, and SR 528 crosses the St. Johns River into Brevard County at mile 35.775. Just east of the Brevard County line, the road veers southeast at the interchange with SR 407. It then enters the Space Coast development area before the interchange with I-95 at exit 205 (signed as exit 42AB on SR 528). It continues east, with interchanges with SR 501/SR 524 and US 1 before crossing over the Intracoastal Waterway on the Emory L. Bennett Causeway, followed by interchanges with SR 3 and Banana River Drive before ending at SR A1A and SR 401 near Port Canaveral.

==Tolls==
There are three mainline toll plazas on the tollway and each of them have at least two express lanes dedicated to SunPass for electronic toll collection, which do not require motorists to stop at a booth, as well as lanes dedicated to cash collection. While the Dallas Boulevard off ramp has a dedicated ETC lane along with an exact change lane, the other two ramp toll plazas only have a combined ETC/Exact Change lane, with no change provided.

The Central Florida Expressway Authority, which operates part of the Beachline from McCoy Road, just east of the airport, to SR 520, accepts E-ZPass. FTE, which operates the Beachline from McCoy road west, also accepts E-ZPass.

Tolls on the east-pointing ramps at SR 520 are collected by FDOT, and 25 cents of the $1.25 CFX barrier toll east of the airport also goes to FDOT. There are no toll roads in Brevard County so technically the 25 cents is only for use of the FDOT road section in Orange County. Nonetheless, most road maps show the Brevard County section from the Orange County line to I-95 to be a toll road because it is impossible to travel over it without incurring a toll elsewhere. The Toll SR 528 shield is also used on this stretch of road as well as on exit signs along I-95.

The current toll rates took effect in July 2012.

Two managed lanes in each direction were opened in 2019 and 2020 for the eight miles between I-4 and McCoy Road near Orlando International Airport. They were originally built as Express Lanes with congestion-based tolling, but the additional tolls were never implemented, and they have now officially been converted to Thru Lanes. Although drivers will pay the same toll as for the general use lanes, a SunPass or compatible transponder is required to use the Thru Lanes. Eastbound drivers can enter from the general use lanes just east of I-4, and can exit shortly before Consulate Drive and Florida&#x27;s Turnpike, or just before the airport. Westbound drivers can enter just west of the airport or the Turnpike, and exit only at I-4.

==History==
===Pre-Bee Line===

====Orlando area====
Prior to the construction of the Bee Line, State Road 528 was a surface road connecting Interstate 4 with the McCoy Jetport (now Orlando International Airport) and SR 15 (Narcoossee Road). It ran along Sand Lake Road (now State Road 482) from I-4 east to Orange Blossom Trail (US 17/US 92/US 441, SR 500/SR 600), where it turned south to reach Landstreet Road. Landstreet Road took SR 528 to Orange Avenue (SR 527) at Taft, where SR 528 turned back north to McCoy Road. McCoy Road led east past the north entrance to the Jetport to SR 15; part of this is now SR 482, while part of McCoy Road from about east of SR 527 now serves as a frontage road to the Beachline Expressway.

An interchange at SR 528 and Kirkman Road (SR 435) was built c. 1958 to serve the new Martin Marietta complex (now Lockheed Martin) just to the south of that junction. At that time, the area at the west end of SR 528 was basically empty, and the land was a part of the extensive Martin-owned Orlando Central Park, covering roughly the area bounded by I-4 to the west/northwest, the Florida Turnpike to the northeast/east, and SR 482 (West Sand Lake Road) to the south.

====Bennett Causeway and Bee Line Expressway====
The Emory L. Bennett Causeway and approaches, running from SR 520 west of Cocoa northeast on what is now SR 524 and east across US 1, the Indian River Lagoon, Merritt Island and the Banana River, was dedicated on October 11, 1963, as a two-lane toll bridge and road. It was assigned the SR 528 number over its whole length. At the same time, the present SR 401 north of SR 528 was also built. The causeway was named in honor of Emory L. Bennett, recipient of the Medal of Honor for his actions during the Korean War, and is part of the Indian River Lagoon Scenic Highway. SR 528 was initially opened in 1967 and named &quot;The Bee Line Expressway,&quot; because it &quot;beelined&quot; east to Interstate 95. The Bee Line Expressway&#x27;s southern fork was the mainline SR 528 and went to Interstate 95 and then Bennett Causeway to Cocoa Beach, while its northern fork, also designated SR 407, went northeast to I-95 and SR 405 (Columbia Boulevard) at Titusville. (Note: Beeline simply meant the most direct path from one point to another)

===Construction===

====SR 15 to SR 520====
Martin Andersen, then owner of the &quot;Orlando Sentinel&quot;, helped form the Central Florida Development Commission to ensure that Orlando would prosper, with one of its goals being developing an &quot;adequate road system&quot;. With the completion of Florida&#x27;s Turnpike and I-4 in 1963 and 1965, Orlando had freeway connections to the northwest, southwest, southeast and northeast, but lacked such a connection to the Kennedy Space Center to the east.

A bill creating the Orlando-Orange County Expressway Authority (OOCEA) was signed into law in 1963, which, unlike the State Road Department (SRD), could raise money for new roads using tolls. Its immediate goal was to build a road to the Kennedy Space Center, but the law was written with the intent of a larger expressway network.

The OOCEA wanted to build a freeway all the way from I-4 to Cape Canaveral, but ran into several problems. It had issues with raising money for the road; traffic projections fell short of necessary to pay for the large bond issue required. It also did not have the authority to build in Brevard County, and many Brevard residents opposed the roads, as it would draw business away from the Cape Canaveral area to Orlando.

The setbacks resulted in a much shorter expressway route running from SR 15 (Narcoosee Road) east of the McCoy Jetport east to SR 520 in east Orange County. This was known as the Bithlo Cutoff, as it allowed traffic from southern Orlando to reach SR 520 without going north and east to Bithlo. West of SR 15, the existing SR 528 was to carry traffic to I-4. A new alignment would be built between Orange Blossom Trail and Orange Avenue (SR 527), directly connecting Sand Lake Road to McCoy Road (SR 482), and McCoy Road east from Daetwyler Drive (the Jetport entrance) to SR 15 would be widened as a divided surface road. Additionally, to handle traffic from downtown Orlando, SR 15 (Hoffner Avenue) between Conway Road and Goldenrod Road would be rebuilt. Concurrently, the SRD was extending Lake Barton Road (now SR 436, Semoran Boulevard) south to the Jetport, where it would meet the Bee Line, which opened in 1969.

In November 1964, the OOCEA and SRD signed an agreement where the OOCEA would build the road, and then turn it over to the SRD, which would operate and maintain it, giving toll revenue to the OOCEA. Construction of the $6.8 million (equivalent to $ in ) project began in early 1966, with groundbreaking at the location of the present Dallas Boulevard interchange (exit 24). The road was dedicated on July 14, 1967, at the toll plaza just east of SR 15, and the remaining section (Orange Blossom Trail to Orange Avenue) opened nine days later. The OOCEA board had voted to name it after Martin Andersen in December 1966, and in 1967 the Florida Legislature passed this designation into law.

====I-4 to McCoy Jetport and SR 520 to the Bennett Causeway====
In early 1967, the Florida State Turnpike Authority (FTA) announced plans for an expansion of the Turnpike System, including taking over the existing Bee Line and Bennett Causeway and forming a continuous route from the Turnpike to the Atlantic Ocean, with a spur (now SR 407) to the Orsino Causeway. Enabling legislation was signed into law in July 1967. However, inflation caused problems with that plan. In December 1968, bonds were sold for a joint project—FTA would build from McCoy Jetport west to the Turnpike (at the existing Orlando-South interchange with Orange Blossom Trail), and Orange and Brevard Counties would fund the extension from SR 520 east to the Bennett and Orsino Causeways, in addition to a four-laning on the Bennett Causeway.

An interchange at SR 15 replaced an at-grade crossing c. 1971.

The FTA planned to build from the Turnpike east past the Jetport to SR 15, upgrading the existing SR 528 (McCoy Road) with frontage roads from west of the Jetport to SR 15. An interchange would be provided with the new SR 436, planned to open in 1969. However, Governor Claude Kirk insisted that the new road continue west past the Turnpike to I-4, and so the FTA did not have enough money to upgrade the road past the Jetport. (The FTA merged into the new Florida Department of Transportation (FDOT) in 1969.) The piece from west of the Jetport to the Turnpike opened in late July 1973, and the rest of the road to I-4 opened in December. The road had one toll booth lying between the Turnpike and Jetport. The rest of the road to I-4 was free; initially there were no interchanges except at International Drive, just east of I-4, but overpasses were built at roughly one-mile intervals which would eventually provide exits for Orangewood Boulevard and John Young Parkway.

At the same time, construction had begun on the eastern section, originally known as the Central Florida Expressway, by December 1971. The road ran east from SR 520 past a toll booth to the St. Johns River, where it crossed into Brevard County. Shortly after crossing, it split, with a two-lane spur (SR 407) heading northeast, intersecting I-95, and ending at SR 405 west of the Orsino Causeway for access to the central part of the Kennedy Space Center. The main line headed southeast from the split and then east across I-95 to join the Bennett Causeway approach just west of US 1. The causeway was widened, with a new eastbound side added c. 1970–1971, and the extension of the Bee Line to connect with the two causeways opened February 16, 1974. The former Bennett Causeway approach west of the new road became SR 524.

====At the Orlando International Airport====

While the sections west and east of the Jetport were freeways, the piece along McCoy Road, from west of the Jetport to SR 15, was a four-lane divided surface road. It had two major intersections—Daetwyler Drive (the Jetport entrance) and Semoran Boulevard (SR 436), and a number of minor access points. Adding to the need for an upgrade was the Greater Orlando Aviation Authority&#x27;s plans for expanding the Jetport (which became Orlando International Airport once the expansion was complete in September 1981).

To help pay for the upgrade, the OOCEA raised tolls at the Bee Line toll plaza (east of SR 15) from 35 cents to 50 cents (equivalent to $– in ) Bonds were sold in January 1981, and the finished SR 436/Airport interchange was dedicated on January 21, 1983. The toll plaza just west of the Airport interchange opened July 2, 1983.

In 2016, the Airport Toll Plaza was removed replacing it with four ramp tolls on exits 8 and 9.

===Later changes===
The spaces left for interchanges on the section west of the Turnpike have since been used by junctions with Orangewood Boulevard and Universal Boulevard, John Young Parkway and a partial interchange at Consulate. The Turnpike constructed a southbound SunPass-only off-ramp at milepost 255 to Consulate Drive, which provides a more direct connection to westbound Beachline via the Consulate ramps, and incidentally to Orange Blossom Trail. This ramp is used primarily by commuters; cash customers, mostly tourists, must exit at Turnpike exit 254 to make this connection. Consulate is a partial interchange, to and from westbound Beachline only. East of SR 15, similar connections have been built with International Corporate Park Boulevard and Dallas Boulevard.

The interchange with SR 417 (the Eastern Beltway) opened June 26, 1990, resulting in the toll booth east of SR 15 being moved several miles east.

Tolls were removed on the Bennett Causeway on June 29, 1990, as the bonds were paid off, making the road free east of the SR 520 interchange.

With the startup of the Disney Cruise Line from Port Canaveral in 1998, Disney started running buses along the Bee Line for tourists going between Walt Disney World and the port.

SR 528 east of SR 436 was designated the Kennedy Space Center Highway in 1998 by the Florida Legislature.

The 20-cent FDOT toll booth east of SR 520 was rounded up to 25 cents in July 1996 to improve efficiency. After an agreement signed May 8, 1998 by the OOCEA and FDOT, it was removed May 11, and replaced with an additional 25 cents at the $1 (originally 35-cent) OOCEA toll east of SR 417. The extra 25 cents goes to FDOT, as traffic that exits at SR 520 now has to pay an extra quarter—the 25-cent ramp tolls pointing eastward at the SR 520 interchange were added August 19, 1999.

The last at-grade interchange on the original Bee Line alignment, a connection on the westbound side to a derelict portion of the McCoy Road frontage, was finally eliminated in 2002 as part of the Goldenrod Road extension project. The break in the frontage allowing eastbound traffic to cross over to McCoy Road at that point had been closed about a decade before during a resurfacing project. At that point, the Bee Line became completely limited-access from I-4 to SR 401.

In 2003, a new interchange was completed at George J. King Blvd at Port Canaveral, extending the freeway beyond SR 401. While SR 528 officially ends at SR 401, signage continues it along SR A1A to the new interchange at the city limits of Cape Canaveral.

Between 2003 and 2011, the Bennett Causeway&#x27;s eastbound bridge over the Indian River Lagoon was replaced.

The name of the entire road, except between US 1 and SR 3 (where it is the Emory L. Bennett Causeway), was officially designated as the Martin Andersen Beachline Expressway by the 2005 Florida Legislature. This was done after lobbying by Brevard County, which wanted the shortest route to the Atlantic Ocean from the Orlando area designated as such. An organization representing businesses on the Space Coast has put up billboards calling it &quot;Orlando&#x27;s closest beach&quot;.

During 2006 construction began on a redesigned interchange with SR 436 at the entrance to Orlando International Airport. It was completed in early 2008. A new flyover ramp was built from the Beachline westbound into the airport, eliminating the weaving of cars entering and leaving the airport from/to the Beachline. The mainline toll plazas east and west of the airport remain subject to traffic congestion because of the high percentage of tourists at those plazas who must pay with cash since they don&#x27;t have access to SunPass, E-Pass or other acceptable electronic toll collection transponders.

The interchange at exit 13 (SR 15) was reconstructed between September 2007 and July 2009, which expanded the interchange ramps and replaced the old bridges with wider ones, and did not eliminate free movement that exists between that exit and exit 11 (SR 436).

In May 2007, the FTE began Phase I of a project to widen the Beachline West. It encompasses the reconstruction of the mainline toll plaza located near milepost 5, which is now complete. The new mainline toll plaza features two electronic (E-pass/SunPass) at-speed express lanes in each direction in the middle of the roadway (with capability to add another when the roadway proper is widened), and four staffed lanes in each direction to accommodate cash customers. The OOCEA had a similar reconstruction of the Beachline main toll plaza just east of the Greeneway between January 2008 and July 2009.

In June 2008, a $49 million (equivalent to $ in ) project to widen the Beachline from the Turnpike to McCoy Road to four lanes in each direction began. Improvements include widening the existing bridge structures at US 441, Landstreet Road, CSX Transportation, CSX Taft Yard, Orange Avenue and McCoy Road, with a new bridge being constructed for the access ramp over CSX.

In 2011, an accident involving an exploding fuel truck destroyed the overpass at SR 3. Traffic was forced to exit the highway around the damage. The overpass was replaced, high priority, within 30 days, for $2.2 million (equivalent to $ in ).

Sightseers wishing to view the final launch of the Space Shuttle Discovery in 2011, caused a backup from Cape Canaveral.

On March 19, 2012, the Beachline Dallas Boulevard Toll Plaza went into service, in between the Dallas Boulevard and SR 520 interchanges, with a toll of $0.75, ending the previous free movement section of the expressway. This also dropped the previous toll of the Beachline Main Toll Plaza to $0.75, from $1.00 previously. The expressway remains toll-free east of the SR-520 exit to Cape Canaveral.

East of the GreeneWay, a new interchange at Innovation Way opened on March 5, 2018.

On September 1, 2018, CFX started accepting E-ZPass on the portions of the Beachline that it manages citing some 35 million out of state visitors that use E-ZPass tolling devices. The westernmost few miles of the Beachline, operated by FTE, became compatible with E-ZPass in 2021.

The Turnpike began a massive widening project between I-4 and the Turnpike mainline in fiscal year 2016 to include two express lanes in each direction. The project was completed July 2019.

The Cocoa to Orlando segment of Brightline&#x27;s rail line between Miami and Orlando was built along the Beachline Expressway. The line began operation on this section in September 2023.

<doc id="763661" wikidata="Q7534809" url="?curid=763661" title="Skewbald">
<text>Skewbald is a colour pattern of horses. A skewbald horse has a coat made up of white patches on a non-black base coat, such as chestnut, bay, or any colour besides black coat. Skewbald horses which are bay and white (bay is a reddish-brown colour with black mane and tail) are sometimes called tricoloured. These horses usually have pink skin under white markings and dark skin under non-white areas. Other than colour, it is similar in appearance to the piebald pattern. Some animals also exhibit colouration of the irises of the eye that match the surrounding skin (blue eyes for white skin, brown for dark). The underlying genetic cause is related to a condition known as leucism. The term is also used to describe spotting patterns in various other animals, such as goats.

== Horses ==
=== Terminology ===
In British equestrian use, &quot;skewbald&quot; and &quot;piebald&quot; (black-and-white) are together known as &quot;coloured&quot;, and the white markings are called &quot;patches&quot;. In North American equestrian usage, the term for all large-spotted colouring is &quot;pinto&quot;, and the markings are called &quot;spots&quot;, The specialized term &quot;paint&quot; refers specifically to a breed of horse with American Quarter Horse or Thoroughbred bloodlines in addition to being spotted, whereas &quot;pinto&quot; refers to a spotted horse of any breed. Americans usually describe the colouration of a pinto literally: black-and-white, chestnut-and-white, or bay-and-white.

=== Genetics ===
Genetically, a skewbald horse begins most commonly with a chestnut base coat colour (called &quot;red&quot; by geneticists), or some other set of colour genes other than black. Then the horse has an allele for one of three basic spotting patterns overlaying the base colour. The most common coloured spotting pattern is called tobiano, and is a dominant gene. Tobiano creates spots that are large and rounded, usually with a somewhat vertical orientation, with white that usually crosses the back of the horse, white on the legs, with the head mostly dark. Three less common spotting genes are the frame and splash overo genes, which create a mostly dark, jagged spotting with a horizontal orientation, white on the head, but dark or minimally marked legs. The sabino pattern can be very minimal, usually adding white that runs up the legs onto the belly or flanks, &quot;lacy&quot; or roaning at the edge of the white, plus white on the head that either extends past the eye, over the chin, or both. The genetics of overo and sabino are not yet fully understood, but they can appear in the offspring of two solid-coloured parents, whereas a tobiano must always have at least one tobiano parent.

== Other animals ==
The term is also applied sometimes to goats and dogs, among other animals. Both &quot;piebald&quot; and &quot;skewbald&quot; are used in dog and goat breeding.

<doc id="763664" wikidata="Q7103221" url="?curid=763664" title="Central Florida Expressway Authority">
<text>The Central Florida Expressway Authority (CFX) is a highway authority responsible for construction, maintenance and operation of toll roads in five counties of Greater Orlando (Lake, Orange, Osceola, Polk, Seminole, and Brevard Counties). It was created in 2014 to replace the Orlando–Orange County Expressway Authority (OOCEA), which only had authority in Orange County, and as of 2016 no roads outside that county have been added to the system. Other toll roads in the area are operated by Florida&#x27;s Turnpike Enterprise (successor to the Seminole County Expressway Authority). The Osceola County Expressway Authority, which previously operated additional toll roads in the area, merged into CFX in 2018.

The Wekiva Parkway, the final piece of a beltway around Orlando, was completed through Lake and Orange Counties in January 2024.

CFX operates an electronic toll collection system known as E-PASS, one of the first systems of its kind in the United States. Use of the state&#x27;s SunPass system is also available on CFX roads. On November 9, 2017, it was announced that CFX would join the E-ZPass group. CFX began accepting E-ZPass as a form of payment starting on September 1, 2018, but only on roads which they maintain.

==Jurisdiction==
The following roads were built and/or are maintained by CFX. Some roads share jurisdiction with other agencies – either Florida&#x27;s Turnpike Enterprise or the Florida Department of Transportation, or have multiple agencies maintaining different portions of the road.

* SR 408 (Spessard L. Holland East–West Expressway): from Florida&#x27;s Turnpike in Gotha to Challenger Parkway in Alafaya
* SR 414 (John Land Apopka Expressway): from SR 429 / US 441 in Apopka to SR 414 / US 441 in Lockhart, continuing east as FDOT-maintained (non-tolled) Maitland Boulevard
* SR 417 (Central Florida GreeneWay): from I-4 in Celebration to I-4 in Sanford
* SR 429 (Daniel Webster Western Beltway): from I-4 in Four Corners to CR 435 near Mount Plymouth
* SR 429 (Wekiva Parkway): an extension of the Western Beltway that will connect to I-4/ SR 417 in Sanford and complete a full beltway around Orlando. The ramp from I-4 west to SR 429 opened to traffic on October 21, 2022 with the remaining ramps opening in January 2024.
* SR 451: a short spur route in Apopka connecting SR 414 / SR 429 to US 441
* SR 453 (Mount Dora Connector): a short spur route to Sorrento connecting SR 429 to SR 46
* SR 528 (Martin Andersen Beachline Expressway): from I-4 in Orlando to SR A1A near Cape Canaveral
* SR 538 (Poinciana Parkway): from US 17 / US 92 in Loughman to CR 580 in Poinciana
* SR 551 (Goldenrod Road Extension): an unsigned extension of SR 551 in Orlando connecting the FDOT-maintained (non-tolled) state road with SR 528 near the Orlando International Airport
* Osceola Parkway (CR 522): from Walt Disney World to Simpson Road near Buenaventura Lakes

==History==
CFX was founded in 1963 for the purpose of building the Bee Line Expressway, and soon built the East-West Expressway.

Many sections of the current expressway system, such as the connection of SR 528 from Sand Lake Road to I-4, the sections of SR 417 in Seminole and Osceola counties, and SR 429 south of Seidel Road, were built by the Florida&#x27;s Turnpike Enterprise, and their toll facilities are managed by the same.

Beginning in 2007, CFX began transitioning its signage from FHWA Series E modified typeface to signs that use the new Clearview typeface.

The newest addition to the CFX system is an extension of Maitland Boulevard (State Road 414) known as the John Land Apopka Expressway. The expressway opened on May 15, 2009. The project was inherited from the Florida Department of Transportation, which referred to it as the &quot;Apopka Bypass&quot;. Planning is also underway for an extension of State Road 429 known as the Wekiva Parkway. In addition, SR 408 underwent a massive overhaul, including the relocation of its two main toll plazas, large sections of widening, and expansion of a bridge over Lake Underhill.

In 2010, CFX was attempting to keep the average toll to $0.11 per mile.

The current 25-year plan, the &quot;2040 Master Plan&quot;, was approved in May 2016. Included are two new toll connections to Brevard County (including an extension of SR 408), a southern bypass of SR 417 to Florida&#x27;s Turnpike south of St. Cloud, a connection bypassing the three remaining signalized intersections on SR 414, and a connection from the Western Beltway to U.S. Highway 27 south of Clermont.

A 2013 grand jury investigation into the CFX, found a &quot;culture of corruption,&quot; involving gifts and campaign donations. CFX was criticized for firing the Director who was attempting to stop this corruption, replacing him with a legislator with no experience of running a toll operation. The job paid over $175,000 annually.

===Canceled projects===
The Central Connector, known by the Florida Department of Transportation as State Road 529 (SR 529), was a proposed tollway planned to parallel Orange Avenue (SR 527) between downtown Orlando and the Beachline Expressway. The project was canceled in 1991 after much local opposition.

<doc id="763665" wikidata="Q7841275" url="?curid=763665" title="Tricoloured horse">
<text>Tri-coloured (archaic: &quot;oddbald&quot;) refers to a horse with three different coat colours in a pinto spotting pattern of large white and dark patches, usually bay (a reddish colour with a black mane and tail) and white. This colouring is also commonly called skewbald (referring to a horse with a spotted coat that is white and any colour other than black). In modern usage in British English, skewbald and piebald (black and white) horses are collectively referred to as &quot;coloured&quot;, while in North American English, the term &quot;pinto&quot; is used to describe the colour pattern. 

The colour of the horse&#x27;s skin underneath its coat alternates between dark or pink, depending on the dark or white overlying hair colour. Some animals also exhibit colouration of the irises of the eye that match the surrounding skin (blue eyes for white skin, brown for dark). The underlying genetic cause is related to a condition known as leucism.
Genetically, a coloured horse begins with a solid base coat colour. Then the horse has an allele for one of three basic spotting patterns overlaying the base colour. The most common coloured spotting pattern is called tobiano, and is a dominant gene. Tobiano creates spots that are large and rounded, usually with a somewhat vertical orientation, with white that usually crosses the back of the horse, white on the legs, with the head mostly dark. Three less common spotting genes are the frame and splash overo genes, which create a mostly dark, jagged spotting with a horizontal orientation, white on the head, but dark or minimally marked legs. The sabino pattern can be very minor, usually adding white that runs up the legs onto the belly or flanks, with &quot;lacy&quot; or roaning at the edge of the white, plus white on the head that either extends past the eye, over the chin, or both. The genetics of overo and sabino are not yet fully understood, but and can appear in the offspring of two apparently solid-coloured parents, whereas a tobiano must always have at least one tobiano parent.

<doc id="763667" wikidata="Q2603563" url="?curid=763667" title="Bilär">
<text>Bilär (Tatar: Биләр) - was a medieval city in Volga Bulgaria and its second capital before the Mongol invasion of Volga Bulgaria. It was located on the left bank of the Small Cheremshan River in Alexeeyevsky District of the Tatarstan. The distance to Bilyarsk is 50 km and 150 km to Kazan.

== History ==
The city was founded around 10th century by the indigenous Bilär tribe of the Volga Bulgars. In the Rus chronicles, it was also known as &quot;Great City&quot; (&quot;Великий город&quot;), because its population reputedly was in excess of 100,000. Bilyar was one of the main trade centers in the Middle Volga, and alternatively with the Bulgar city and Nur-Suvar served as the capital of Volga Bulgaria in the 12th and 13th centuries. In 1236, the city was sacked by the army of Batu Khan. The city was later rebuilt, but it never regained its former size or power. The city&#x27;s ruins (nearly 8 km2) were explored by Rychkov, Tatischev, Khalikov and Khuchin.

Near old Bilyar in 1654 was founded a Russian border fort &quot;Bilyarsk&quot;, which today is an ethnic Russian village. In 1930-1963 Bilyarsk was an administrative center of Bilyar District. By the 2000 census, its population was 2,270. It is a birthplace of chemist Alexander Arbuzov.

Bilyar was the capital of the Volga-Kama-Bulgaria from the 10th century until the early 13th century. It was also one of the largest cities of medieval Eurasia. The end of the city in 1236 also resulted in the loss of its monumental architecture.

==Bilyar Point==
Bilyar Point on Livingston Island in the South Shetland Islands, Antarctica is named after Bilär.

==In popular culture==

Bilyarsk was the home of a fictional Soviet air force base in Craig Thomas&#x27; &quot;Firefox&quot; novel and subsequent film, about the fictional MiG-31 Firefox aircraft stolen by United States Air Force pilot Mitchell Gant. In reality, Bilyarsk has no airport and the closest full-service airport is in Kazan, Tatarstan in Russia, northwest of Bilyarsk.

<doc id="763668" wikidata="Q200622" url="?curid=763668" title="Luc Tuymans">
<text>Luc Tuymans (born 14 June 1958) is a Belgian visual artist best known for his paintings which explore people&#x27;s relationship with history and confront their ability to ignore it. World War II is a recurring theme in his work. He is a key figure of the generation of European figurative painters who gained renown at a time when many believed the medium had lost its relevance due to the new digital age.

Much of Tuymans&#x27; work deals with moral complexity, specifically the coexistence of &#x27;good&#x27; and &#x27;evil&#x27;. His subjects range from major historical events such as the Holocaust to the seemingly inconsequential or banal: wallpaper, Christmas decorations or everyday objects for example.

The artist&#x27;s sparsely-coloured figurative paintings are made up of quick brush strokes of wet paint. Tuymans paints from photographic or cinematic images drawn from the media or public sphere, as well as from his own photographs and drawings. They often appear intentionally out of focus. The blurred effect is, however, created purposefully with painted strokes, it is not the result of a &#x27;wiping away&#x27; technique.

Formal and conceptual oppositions recur in his work, which is echoed in his remark that while &#x27;sickness should appear in the way the painting is made&#x27; there is also pleasure in its making – a &#x27;caressing&#x27; of the canvas. This reflects Tuymans&#x27; semantic shaping of the philosophical content of his work. Often allegorical, his titles add a further layer of imagery to his work – a layer that exists beyond the visible. The painting &quot;Gaskamer&quot; (&quot;Gas Chamber&quot;) exemplifies his use of titles to provoke associations in the mind of the viewer. Meaning, in his work, is never fixed; his paintings incite thought. A related characteristic of Tuymans&#x27; work is the way he often works in series, a method which enables one image to generate another through which images can be formulated and reformulated ad infinitum. Images are repeatedly analysed and distilled, and a large number of drawings, photocopies and watercolours are produced in preparation for his oil paintings. Each final painting is, however, completed in a single day.

==Early life==


Luc Tuymans was born in Mortsel close to the city of Antwerp on 14 June 1958. His father was Belgian Flemish and his mother was Dutch. During World War II his mother&#x27;s family joined the Dutch Resistance and hid refugees, whereas some members of his father&#x27;s family allegedly had sympathised with Nazi ideology. This fact echoed through family conversations, raising moral questions and feelings of guilt, and the subject became a source of fascination and fear, later playing a key role in Tuymans&#x27; painting.

His interest in art manifested itself at a young age, and his ability was first recognised during a summer holiday in Zundert, when he won a drawing competition. He later said this event gave him a sense of the path he had to take. When he was eight or nine, his uncle took him to the Gemeentemuseum in The Hague where he saw a painting by Mondrian. In a much later conversation, he explained how &#x27;looking at that abstract painting was my first art experience... I felt the magic of art in it... I did understand the monumentality of that work.&#x27;

== Education ==
Tuymans&#x27; formal art studies began at the age of 18 at the Sint-Lukasinstituut in Brussels (1976–79). During this period he traveled to Budapest where he saw El Greco&#x27;s paintings at the Museum of Fine Arts. In an interview in 2020, Tuymans described seeing these paintings as a shock, and discussed the fascination El Greco still holds for him today. He continued his studies at the National School of Visual Arts of La Cambre in Brussels (1979–80), before going to the Royal Academy of Fine Arts in Antwerp (1980–82), where he gave up painting for filmmaking. Having completed his fine art studies, Tuymans enrolled for an academic degree in Art history at the Free University of Brussels (1982–86).

== Work (paintings) ==
=== Early work, 1972–94 ===
During the crucial first phase of Tuymans&#x27; artistic development, his painting method evolved rapidly, and his first solo and group exhibitions took place. According to the catalogue raisonné, he created nearly 200 paintings on canvas or hardboard during this period. His first known painting dates from 1972 and the first public exhibited painting was created in 1977, entitled &quot;Self-Portrait&quot;. He was a student at the time, and submitted it to the national painting competition in Belgium, which he won.

From 1979 to 1980, Tuymans worked in collaboration with Marc Schepers on two local projects entitled &quot;Morguen&quot;. The artists asked families from a neighbourhood in Antwerp for historical family photographs, a collection they built on with their own documentation of the area. The following year, they published the project in the &quot;Tijdschrift voor levende Volkskunst&quot; (&quot;Journal of Living Folk Art&quot;), as a journal modelled on the historical &quot;Volksfoto&quot; magazine. Six months later they organized a second photo project. This time, they focused on the workers&#x27; district surrounding St. Andrew&#x27;s Church, Antwerp.

Between 1980 and 1985, Tuymans stopped painting, dedicating himself to experimentation with film. Among other film-projects, he created &quot;Feu d’artifice&quot; (&quot;Firework&quot;) and made plans for an unrealized, semi-documentary feature film. Some of the film fragments he made later served as inspiration for paintings. When Tuymans resumed painting in 1985, he changed his technique, and since then he never spent more than a day working on a painting.

From 1978 on, Tuymans&#x27; paintings centred on European memories of World War II, confronting Adorno&#x27;s famous question whether art was impossible following the holocaust, and &#x27;the collapse of any coherent tradition in painting&#x27; described by Peter Schjeldahl. One of his works from this period is a small painting of the gas chamber in Dachau, entitled &quot;Gaskamer&quot; (&quot;Gas Chamber&quot;), 1986. This painting was based on a watercolour he had done on site. As J.S. Marcus from &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; wrote, the painting &#x27;simplified the means of painting... flattened the perspective, muted the colour and the direction of the composition... To save the painting he almost makes it disappear.&#x27; Other paintings that date from this period are the 1988 four-part painting &quot;Die Zeit&quot; (&quot;The Time&quot;) in which Tuymans combines a portrait of the  Nazi frontman Reinhard Heydrich with two spinach tablets and a cityscape, and the 1989 painting &quot;Die Wiedergutmachung&quot; (&quot;The Reparation&quot;) that depicts the eyes of gypsy children who had been experimented on by the Nazis.

From the late 1970s, Tuymans also began to paint portraits of himself and imaginary portraits, anonymous individuals, and historical and public figures. Superficially, most of these images seem to be traditional portraits; the approach is dispassionate and not psychological. His portraits strip individuality away, leaving the body resembling a shell, the face a mask. Another example of his figurative portrait work is &quot;Der diagnostische Blick&quot; (&quot;The Diagnostic Look&quot;), a series of ten paintings from 1992 based on clinical images of bodies and body parts he found in a physician&#x27;s manual on physical diseases.

As Meyer-Hermann wrote in the catalogue raisonné, the artist first elucidated his theoretical approach in an unrealized proposal for a group exhibition, entitled &quot;Virus of the Vanities&quot;. Here, he defines key terms and develops a dialectic between the &#x27;virus&#x27; as representative of the &#x27;cult&#x27;, and &#x27;vanity&#x27; as a projection of &#x27;culture&#x27;, also opposing the &#x27;anecdotal&#x27; (as in the portrait or still life) to the &#x27;symbolic&#x27; (as in representations of time or death). Tuymans refers to nine of his paintings dating from 1978 to 1990 to support his ideas.

Tuymans&#x27; first exhibition in North America, entitled &quot;Superstition&quot;, was held in 1994 at the David Zwirner Gallery (it was also shown later at the Art Gallery of York University in Toronto, The Renaissance Society at the University of Chicago, and London&#x27;s ICA Institute of Contemporary Arts). The exhibition reflected humankind&#x27;s scepticism and spiritual indifference as manifested by our attitude to recent historical events.

===1995–2006===

Since 1995 Tuymans&#x27; international renown grew, and he participated in over 140 group exhibitions and had 47 solo shows in Europe, North America, and Asia. Between these dates, he created 198 works he classified as paintings, several murals and textile wall hangings. 
His exhibition &quot;Heimat&quot;, held in 1995 at the Zeno X Gallery in Antwerp and the Musée des Beaux Arts in Nantes, was a response to political events in Flanders and targeted Flemish nationalism. Pieces shown were all dated from that year and included &quot;The Flag&quot;, &quot;A Flemish Village&quot;, the Flemish memorial &quot;Ijzertoren&quot; (&quot;Yser Tower&quot;), a portrait of the Flemish writer Ernest Claes entitled &quot;A Flemish Intellectual&quot;, and &quot;Home Sweet Home&quot;. Several of the paintings included in &quot;Heimat&quot; were shown the following year (1996–97) in the exhibition &quot;Face à l‘histoire&quot; held at the Centre Georges Pompidou in Paris, which looked at modern artists&#x27; responses to major historical and political events over the preceding sixty years. In a later 2014 interview discussing the &quot;Heimat&quot; series with &quot;De Witte Raaf&quot; he expressed his particular dislike of the separatist, far-right Flemish political party the Vlaams Blok (Flemish block), which achieved its best electoral result to date in Antwerp in 1994, stating: &#x27;I was ashamed that I was from Antwerp!’

In 1996, Tuymans&#x27; exhibition &quot;Heritage&quot;, held at the David Zwirner Gallery, consisted of ten new paintings of the same title, all inspired by the mood that prevailed in the U.S. following the Oklahoma City bombing. The series depicts normal, almost stereotypical American imagery: a painting of two baseball caps (&quot;Heritage I&quot;); Mount Rushmore (&quot;Heritage VII&quot;); a man working (&quot;Heritage VIII&quot;); a portrait and a birthday cake (&quot;Heritage IX&quot;). The series also includes a portrait of the wealthy Ku Klux Klan member Joseph Milteer (&quot;Heritage VI&quot;).

In 2000, Tuymans attracted attention with his series of political paintings &quot;Mwana Kitoko&quot; (&quot;Beautiful Boy&quot;), inspired by King Baudouin of Belgium&#x27;s state visit to the Congo in the 1950s. These works were exhibited in 2000 at the David Zwirner Gallery and the following year in the Belgian Pavilion at the Venice Biennale.

At Documenta 11 in 2002, which focused on works of art containing political or social commentary, many expected Tuymans to present new work created in response to the 9/11 attacks on New York. Instead, he presented a simple still-life executed on a massive scale, deliberately ignoring all reference to world events. This inevitably led to some negative criticism. Tuymans however, described his decision as a deliberate strategy of &#x27;sublimation&#x27;: &#x27;In &quot;Still-Life&quot; the idea of banality becomes larger than life, it is taken to an impossible extreme. It&#x27;s actually just an icon, an almost purely cerebral painting, more like a light projection. The attacks [9/11] were also an assault on aesthetics. That gave me the idea of reacting with a sort of anti-picture, with an idyll, albeit an inherently twisted one.&#x27;

In 2004 Tate Modern in London and in 2006 Museu Serralves in Porto devoted major solo exhibitions to Tuymans work.

===From 2007 onwards===
Since 2007, Tuymans participated in over 200 group exhibitions and had over 30 solo shows in Europe, North America, and Asia. During this period (2007–19) he produced 180 works he classified as paintings, plus several murals and textile wall hangings.

His 2007 exhibition &quot;Les Revenants&quot; at Zeno X focused on the social influence of the Jesuits in education. In 2007, a major retrospective was organized by the Műcsarnok Kunsthalle in Budapest (2007–2008) which travelled as &quot;Luc Tuymans: Wenn der Frühling kommt&quot; to Haus der Kunst in Munich in 2008 and as &quot;Come and See&quot; to the Zachęta National Gallery of Art in Warsaw. Each venue had a different set of paintings on show. His 2008 solo show at David Zwirner Gallery, entitled &quot;The Management of Magic&quot;, explored the &#x27;Disney-fication&#x27; of consumer society. From 2009 to 2011, this major exhibition travelled to four cities in North America: the Wexner Center for the Arts, the SFMOMA San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, DMA Dallas Museum of Art, and the MCA Museum of Contemporary Art in Chicago. It then moved to its final stop in Belgium at BOZAR – Palais des Beaux-Arts in Brussels.

Between 2006 and 2008, solo exhibitions devoted to Tuymans were held in diverse locations: at Műcsarnok Kunsthalle in Budapest in 2007–08; at Zachęta National Gallery of Art in Warsaw and at Haus der Kunst in Munich in 2008.

In 2012, Tuymans was invited by the Polish artist Mirosław Bałka to take part in a project in the town where Bałka had grown up: Otwock. This project involved interpreting the town&#x27;s history through artworks which were spread across over twenty locations. Tuymans contributed the painting &quot;Die Nacht&quot; (2012), which refers to Hans-Jürgen Syberberg&#x27;s epic 1985 film installation on German history. During the second season in 2012, this painting hung in Bałka&#x27;s childhood bedroom. Tuymans also installed hundreds of black balloons in the ruins of Zofiówka, a former hospital for people with mental health conditions. In 1940, the building was part of the Otwock ghetto, and in 1942, during the Nazi occupation of Poland, its inhabitants either died of starvation, were shot, or were sent to the Treblinka concentration camp.

At the retrospective exhibition entitled &quot;Intolerance&quot; staged by QM Gallery Al Riwaq in Doha in 2016, Tuymans presented a new body of work entitled &quot;The Arena I–VI&quot;. These works depict violence in 1942. &#x27;With visual similarities to Francisco Goya&#x27;s &quot;The Third of May 1808&quot;, 1814, Tuymans&#x27; strong highlighting of central figures encased by a blackened, scruffy vignette suggests a diaspora, revolution, or an uneasy static mob. There is a sense of pent-up aggression that lies beneath the surface of the ethnically ambiguous and androgynous forms.&#x27;

Copyright infringement

In January 2015 Tuymans was found guilty of plagiarism by a Belgian civil court after he used a photograph taken by Katrijn Van Giel as the source of his painting &quot;A Belgian Politician&quot; (2011), a portrait of Jean-Marie Dedecker. Tuymans appealed against the ruling, claiming that the painting was a parody – a critique of Belgian conservatism. He and Van Giel reached an amicable, confidential out-of-court settlement in October 2015. The British newspaper &quot;The Guardian&quot; supported the artist in this dispute, commenting on the way Tuymans never makes photorealistic representations of original photos, and describing how &#x27;his work bears witness to a career-long survey of all images.

==Other works==
===Works on paper===
Drawing has been integral to Tuymans&#x27; artistic practice from the start. Sketches, watercolours and other small-scale works form the bedrock of his work for they constitute, for him, a way of thinking through an idea. Important features of Tuymans&#x27; artistic approach can be found in these preparatory pieces such as his voluntary choice of low-quality materials and his incorporation of found elements. Such works are both visual preparations for later paintings and exteriorisations of thought processes. As Tuymans said in an interview with Josef Helfenstein in 1997: &#x27;drawing is particularly important because I become mentally involved in the work and the picture. What is important for me is the idea of thinking while I draw, particularly in the tiny drawings. It helps to have everything under control&#x27;. Elsewhere in the interview, Tuymans explained that he mostly draws from memory and that he finds it better not to start drawing immediately when he sees something, but that he draws &#x27;on the basis of a fragmentary memory.&#x27; This is elaborated on later in the 1997 interview with Helfenstein, when he describes how he usually prefers to draw after seeing something, &#x27;on the basis of a fragmentary memory&#x27;. Each drawing is more than a visual record: it forms part of a wider reflective process. The first comprehensive exhibition of Tuymans&#x27; drawings and other works on paper from the years 1975–96 was on view in an exhibition that travelled to Kunsthalle Bern, Bern; Berkeley Art Museum, Berkeley; and Capc Musée d&#x27;art contemporain, Bordeaux (in 1997–98).

===Murals===

Tuymans has made about 50 site-specific murals since the mid-1990s, five permanent and the rest temporary. Unlike the permanent mural paintings, Tuymans other mural paintings are temporary events and installations created for exhibitions. The type of mural techniques used is either acrylic paint or fresco applied directly on the existing wall surfaces. On rare occasions, he also made textile murals, which are based on drawings that are scanned and mechanically produced. As he said in a video interview he gave about the triptych mural painting &quot;S. Croce&quot; (2010), they are always related to the &#x27;raw space&#x27; and &#x27;it is the element of approach which is important with murals&#x27;, he also mentioned that &#x27;If I work on a wall I feel much more free than on a canvas.&#x27;

The first permanent mural was created in 1995 in Antwerp at Café Alberto. It features a larger version of the painting &quot;Superstition&quot;. In 2007 Tuymans executed a permanent mural based on &quot;Bloodstains&quot; (1993) on the ceiling of the ballroom of the former Ringtheater. This same year, the building was taken over by Troubleyn/Laboratorium, the performance company run by the Belgian playwright and artist Jan Fabre. In February 2012, Tuymans used the motif of &quot;Angel&quot; for a permanent mural created in the second balcony foyer of the Concertgebouw Brugge. Tuymans gave the Staatsschauspiel Dresden two permanent murals created for the main staircases of the building on Theaterstrasse in 2013. These two murals are based on the paintings &quot;Peaches&quot; (2012) and &quot;Technicolor&quot; (2012).&quot;Arena&quot; (2017) is the most recent permanent mural created for the Museum of Fine Arts in Ghent. This work is a fresco mural that consists of three panels located at the end of a curved gallery in the museum&#x27;s hall.

===Mosaics===
The first mosaic Tuymans made was &quot;Dead Skull&quot;, 2010, commissioned by the MAS Museum aan de Stroom (Museum by the River) as a permanent installation in the museum square on the Hanzestedenplaats in Antwerp. It is a 40 m2 stone mosaic that evokes Tuymans&#x27; painting of the same name created in 2002, which in turn refers to a memorial plaque dedicated to the 16th-century painter Quinten Metsys from Antwerp which can be found on the facade of the Cathedral of Our Lady in Antwerp. The painting was first transformed into a grid pattern of 488 by 488 pixels. Using that image and a specially designed digital conversion technique, a mosaic was created from 96,569 stones of 11 different colours. The installation began in the winter of 2009 and was finished in the summer of 2010. &quot;Dead Skull&quot; is hardly distinguishable as an image when you are on the ground floor, but the higher you climb in the MAS, the more clearly the skull becomes visible.

The second mosaic Tuymans made was &quot;Schwarzheide&quot;, made at the time of his exhibition &quot;La Pelle&quot; at Palazzo Grassi in 2019. This work was produced by Fantini Mosaici in Milan and is based on Tuymans&#x27; eponymous oil on canvas dated 1989 representing a German forced-labour camp. The full image could only be seen from the balustrades, overlooking the atrium of Palazzo Grassi. Due to the floods that hit Venice in February 2020, the site-specific mosaic was dismantled.

===Graphic works===
Tuymans experimented with printmaking from the late 1980s on, producing a graphic oeuvre of about 90 works, which focus – like his paintings – on the mediation and translation of images in the mass media. He has explored various printing methods such as photocopy, inkjet, offset, monotype, screen-printing, lithography, etching, and silver gelatine prints, using unusual supports such as wallpaper, security glass and PVC. In a similar way to his paintings, his printed images often appear blurred or reduced. They are frequently based on photographs or film stills, which the artist photographs and re-photographs until much of the original detail is lost. The four-colour etching &quot;Isabel, Diorama, Scramble, Twenty Seventeen&quot; (2017) for example, is based on iPhone photographs Tuymans took while painting. These images reveal an early, unfinished stage of the work. The paint strokes Tuymans placed in the margin of the painting and at the edges of the canvas are also incorporated in the etched image.

Most of Tuymans&#x27; prints are made in collaboration with Antwerp-based master printer Roger Vandaele and Edition Copenhagen.

==Other activities==
===Curating===
Tuymans is also a curator. The first exhibition he curated was &quot;Trouble Spot: Painting&quot; in 1999 at the Museum van Hedendaagse Kunst Antwerpen and the NICC – New International Centre in Antwerp. This show included works by about 50 artists, including Gerhard Richter, Ellsworth Kelly, Raoul De Keyser, Marlene Dumas, and Andy Warhol. In an interview with &quot;Artzip&quot;, he explained that the idea behind the exhibition was &#x27;to explore the boundaries of painting&#x27; and that his curatorial approach was to &#x27;prioritize the visual in order to create a dialogue between different works.&#x27; In 2002, he curated &quot;Kamers. een keuze van Luc Tuymans&quot; (&quot;Rooms. A choice by Luc Tuymans&quot;) at Ruimte Morguen in Antwerp. The following curated event took place on 5 October 2006, Tuymans organized &quot;Sirene/Alarm,&quot; an event that spanned numerous museums and cultural institutions in Belgium. All participating museums were asked to set their alarms to go off at 3 pm. Staff, artists, students, and other supporters evacuated the buildings involved for fifteen minutes. The event was a plea for tolerance; a statement against political extremism, racism, and violence.

In 2007 Tuymans curated the exhibition &quot;The Forbidden Empire: Visions of the World by Chinese and Flemish Artists&quot; at BOZAR – Centre for Fine Arts, Brussels. The exhibition was co-curated with Yu Hui and travelled to the Palace Museum in the Forbidden City in Beijing. The following exhibition he curated was &quot;Reconsidered. Luc Tuymans: Selected Works from the Städel Collection&quot;, an exhibition held at the Städel Museum in Frankfurt am Main in 2009. Following the Chinese/Flemish exhibition &quot;The Forbidden Empire,&quot; Tuymans curated in 2010, &quot;The State of Things: Brussels/Beijing&quot;, a cross-cultural exhibition that combined Belgian and Chinese art at BOZAR – Centre for Fine Arts, Brussels, which then travelled to the National Art Museum of China in Beijing.

In 2011, Angel Vergara invited Tuymans to curate the &quot;Angel Vergara: Feuilleton&quot; exhibition in the Belgian Pavilion at the 54th International Biennale di Venezia. In 2011, he also organized the exhibition &quot;A Vision of Central Europe&quot; for &quot;Brugge Centraal&quot;. As stated on Phaidon&#x27;s website, Tuymans&#x27; starting point for this exhibition was the difference between the cities of Bruges and Warsaw: one survived World War II relatively unscathed, the other was decimated, then carefully reconstructed.

Two years later, he curated &quot;The Gap: Selected Abstract Art from Belgium&quot; at the London Parasol Unit Foundation for Contemporary Art, and in 2013, he collaborated with Dr Ulrich Bischoff on the exhibition &quot;Constable, Delacroix, Friedrich, Goya. A Shock to the Senses&quot; at the Albertinum in Dresden, an exhibition that traced the history of European painting from 1800 to the present, juxtaposing important works of European Romanticism with later modern and contemporary art. In 2016, he curated the exhibition &quot;11 Artists Against the Wall&quot;, at Leopold Place 5 in Antwerp, as part of &quot;Born in Antwerp&quot;, and &quot;James Ensor by Luc Tuymans&quot; at the Royal Academy of Arts in London. The most recent exhibition Tuymans curated is &quot;Sanguine/Bloedrood. Luc Tuymans on Baroque&quot;, which opened in 2018 at the Museum of Contemporary Art, Antwerp then travelling to the Fondazione Prada in Milan.

==Teaching and artist talks==
Tuymans has also engaged in pedagogical work, and was a guest tutor at the Dutch institute Rijksakademie van beeldende kunsten, where he mentored and influenced emerging painters such as the Polish artist Paulina Olowska, and the Serbian-born artist Ivan Grubanov. In 2008, Tuymans took on the Max Beckmann Foundation Professorship at the Städelschule, a role previously held by William Kentridge. During this time he participated in international symposia and conferences, and gave interviews and lectures on his work and painting in general at various international universities and museums.

In 1995, he gave a lecture on his work at the University of Chicago and participated in a conversation led by curator and writer Hamza Walker. In 2000, he participated with Carel Blotkamp, Ferdinand van Dieten, Benoît Hermans, Frank Reijnders, Jeroen Stumpel in the symposium &quot;The Persistence of Painting&quot; at the Rijksakademie van beeldende kunsten in Amsterdam. At the close of Tuymans&#x27; exhibition &quot;Signal&quot; at the  Hamburger Bahnhof in 2001, a symposium entitled &quot;Gesichtsbilder&quot; was held involving the artist, Eugen Blume (director of Hamburger Bahnhof), the art historian Anne-Marie Bonnet, and Norbert Kampe (the director of House of the Wannsee Conference, Memorial and Educational Site). At Tuymans&#x27; request, the symposium&#x27;s closing session took place at the House of the Wannsee Conference in Berlin, a former industrialist&#x27;s villa used by the SSas a guest house and conference centre from 1941 to 1945 and the place the deportation and murder of European Jews was planned in 1942.

At the symposium &quot;Between Senses, Strukturen und Strategien del Malerei im 20. Jahrhundert&quot; organized for the exhibition &quot;Painting on the Move&quot; at the Beyeler Foundation in Basel, Tuymans participated in a panel discussion on the significance of painting in relation to new media, moderated by the art historian Beat Wyss, with the philosopher Hubert Damisch, the art historians Yve-Alain Bois, Bruno Haas, and Denys Zacharopoulos, and the artist and art historian Hans-Dieter Huber. In 2003, Tuymans held a public talk at the Kunstverein Hannover, and in 2004 he lectured at the Museo Tamayo, Mexico City (with Gerrit Vermeiren), at the Mauritshuis in The Hague where he gave a lecture entitled &quot;On Peter Paul Rubens&quot;, at the deSingel in Antwerp as part of the program &quot;Curating the Library&quot;, and at the Dresdner Bank in Berlin during the conference &quot;Europa eine Seele geben: Berliner Konferen für europaïsche Kulturpolitik&quot;. In 2006, he participated in an &quot;Artists Panel&quot; with Brice Marden, Francesco Clemente, and Christopher Wool at MoMA in New York and in 2008, he lectured at the Haus der Kunst in Munich (&quot;Luc Tuymans: Arbeit und Praxis&quot;) and gave the inaugural lecture at the Neues Museum Weserburg in Bremen at the symposium &quot;Arbeit der Bilder: Die Präzens der Bilde sim Dialog zwischen Psychoanalyse, Philosophie und Kunstwissenschaft. In 2009, he took part in the Interdisciplinary Conference at NCCR in Basel; the Coloquim Abschied und Gegenstand during the Platform Project&quot; at Wiels in Brussels, and the Lambert Family Lecture, in conversation with T.J. Clark at the Wexner Center in Columbus. In 2010, he participated in the symposium &quot;History, Violence, Disquiet&quot; held at the Museum of Contemporary Art, Chicago (MCA), and in 2011, he held a conversation with Rem Koolhaas at La Loge in Brussels entitled &quot;Construction Européenne&quot;. In 2012, he was invited to the &quot;Frieze Talks&quot; and in 2015 he conducted a talk with Colin Chinnery at the Talbot Rice Gallery. In 2016 he lectured at the &quot;Slade Contemporary Art Lecture Series 2015–16&quot; at the Slade School of Fine Art in London, and the same year, he participated in the round table discussion &quot;What About Painting Today&quot; at LaM Lille Métropole Museum of Modern, Contemporary and Outsider Art, and participated in a public discussion with Kerry James Marshall in Montreal. In 2017, he lectured at the Migros Museum of Contemporary Art in Zurich and alongside Gilane Tawadros at the Royal College of Art in London. In 2018, he gave a public talk on Andrzej Wróblewski at the David Zwirner Gallery in London.

==Selected exhibitions==
===Solo exhibitions===
Over 100 solo exhibitions of Tuymans&#x27; paintings were staged between 1985 and 2016, including over 70 international solo exhibitions. The first exhibition of Tuymans&#x27; paintings, for the &quot;Belgian Art Review&quot; (1985), took place in Ostend in a deserted swimming pool at the prestigious Thermae Palace. Tuymans chose Ostend because of James Ensor and Leon Spilliaert, two painters who had a profound influence on his artistic development and whose connection with the city gave it a spiritual significance for him. Besides his parents and a handful of friends, few people saw the exhibition, but it was nonetheless crucial, because it was the first time Tuymans saw his work outside the studio.

The next public exhibition of Tuymans&#x27; work was held at Ruimte Morguen in Antwerp in 1988 and the first museum exhibitions devoted exclusively to his work were held in 1990 at the PMMK Provinciaal Museum voor Moderne Kunst in Ostend and at the S.M.A.K. Stedelijk Museum voor Actuele Kunst in Ghent. In the same year, he had his first exhibition at Zeno X, a gallery he continues to work with today.

In 1992, Tuymans made an international breakthrough in his career. Several major exhibitions of his work (at Kunsthalle Bern for example) and his participation in Documenta 9, extended his reputation internationally. Tuymans concluded this first period of his career with a retrospective exhibition held in Krefeld in 1993 at the Museum Haus Lange, Krefelder Kunstmuseen in the two residential houses turned contemporary art museums Haus Lange and Haus Esters. In 1994, his work was shown at Portikus in Frankfurt am Main, an exhibition that travelled to the David Zwirner Gallery in New York, the artist&#x27;s U.S. gallery. That same year, he had a solo exhibition at the Art Gallery of York University in Toronto which moved on to The Renaissance Society at The University of Chicago, the ICA Institute of Contemporary Arts in London, and the Goldie Paley Gallery, Moore College of Art and Design in Philadelphia. In 2001, Tuymans represented Belgium at the Venice Biennale.

Between 2004 and 2008, solo exhibitions devoted to Tuymans were held in diverse locations: at Tate Modern in London in 2004; at Museu Serralves in Porto; at Museu Serralves in Porto; at Műcsarnok Kunsthalle in Budapest in 2007–8; at Zachęta National Gallery of Art in Warsaw and at Haus der Kunst in Munich in 2008.

The artist&#x27;s first comprehensive U.S. retrospective opened in September 2009 at the Wexner Center for the Arts in Columbus Ohio, then travelling to the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, the Dallas Museum of Art and the Museum of Contemporary Art, Chicago. This retrospective also travelled beyond the U.S. to BOZAR Centre for Fine Arts, Brussels, in Belgium.

Also in 2009, an exhibition of works inspired by one of Tuymans&#x27; favourite authors, Thomas Pynchon, called &quot;Against the Day&quot;, was held at Wiels Contemporary Art Centre, Brussels, subsequently travelling to Baibakov Art Projects, Moscow, and Moderna Museet Malmö, Sweden. A major solo exhibition was put on in 2015 at QM Gallery Al Riwaq, Doha, entitled &quot;Intolerance&quot;, and in 2019, Tuymans&#x27; major exhibition &quot;La pelle&quot; was staged at Palazzo Grassi in Venice. This show incorporated 80 paintings dating from 1986 to 2019.

===Group exhibitions===
Tuymans also participated in over 350 group exhibitions between 1985 and 2016, including more than 300 international exhibitions. In 1992, he was invited to show at Documenta in Kassel for the first time and in 2002 he participated in Documenta 11. Work by Tuymans has also been included in group exhibitions such as: &quot;Infinite Painting: Contemporary Painting and Global Realism&quot;, held at the Villa Manin Centro d’Arte Contemporanea, Codroipo in Italy (2006); &quot;Essential Painting&quot;, at the  National Museum of Art, Osaka, Japan (2006); &quot;Fast Forward: Collections for the Dallas Museum of Art&quot;, at the Dallas Museum of Art, Dallas, Texas (2007); &quot;What is Painting? Contemporary Art From the Collection&quot; at The Museum of Modern Art, New York (2007); &quot;The Painting of Modern Life&quot; at the Hayward Gallery, London, England and the Castle of Rivoli, Turin, Italy (2007); &quot;Doing it My Way: Perspectives in Belgian Art&quot; at the Museum Küppersmühle für Moderne Kunst, Duisburg, Germany (2008); &quot;Collecting Collections: Highlights from the Permanent Collection of the Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles&quot; at the Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles, California (2008); &quot;Mapping the Studio: Artists from the François Pinault Collection&quot; at the Palazzo Grassi, Venice, Italy (2009) and &quot;Compass in Hand: Selections from The Judith Rothschild Foundation Contemporary Drawings Collection&quot; at The Museum of Modern Art, New York (2009–10).

==Catalogue raisonné==
In 2019, a comprehensive catalogue raisonné edited by the art historian Eva Meyer-Hermann was published by the David Zwirner Gallery and Yale University Press. Tuymans&#x27; paintings dating from 1972 on – 564 in total – are spread between three volumes. &quot;Volume I&quot; covers the 186 paintings done on canvas or hardboard between 1972 and 1994. &quot;Volume II&quot; covers 198 paintings on canvas or, on occasion, polyester or vinyl, between 1995 and 2006, and &quot;Volume III&quot; includes 180 works on canvas dating from 2007 to 2018.

==Art market==
According to an article published by &quot;Artprice&quot; in 2019, half of his auction turnover is generated in the United States, and 36% in the United Kingdom. In May 2005, &quot;Sculpture&quot; (2000), part of Tuymans&#x27; &quot;Mwana Kitoko&quot; (&quot;Beautiful White Man&quot;) series, was sold at Christie&#x27;s New York for a record price. In 2005, he was listed 184 in the &#x27;Top 500&#x27; selling artists, a ranking compiled by &quot;Artprice.&quot; Tuymans&#x27; auction record was established when &quot;Rumour&quot; (2001) sold by $2,699,750 at Christie&#x27;s New York, on 15 May 2013. It was then the best ever auction result for a contemporary Belgian artist. Since then, his paintings have fetched ever-increasing sums. As a result, in 2016, Tuymans was ranked 60 in the &quot;ArtReview&quot; list of the 100 most powerful people in the art world&#x27;. In 2019, Tuymans gained a lot of exposure with his exhibition &quot;La Pelle&quot; at Palazzo Grassi in Venice. The market reacted accordingly and his works generated even higher turnover on the secondary market, a record year for the artist. In 2015, Tuymans ranked 168 on the &#x27;TOP 500&#x27; Contemporary Artists 2014/2015. That year, he ranked 75 in the &#x27;Top 500&#x27; best-selling artists worldwide. This brought him into the top 100 most successful artists on the global secondary market. As a result, he is regarded today as one of the most successful European artists, ranked alongside the Italian artists Rudolf Stingel and Maurizio Cattelan, the Belgian artist Harold Ancart, and eight German artists, including Albert Oehlen.

==Recognition==
In 2007, Tuymans was appointed Commander of the Order of Leopold of Belgium by King Albert II, in 2013, he was made a Foreign Honorary Member of The American Academy of Arts and Letters in New York, and the Academy of Arts (&quot;Akademie der Künste&quot;) in Berlin. In 2019 he received the Medal of Honor from the International Congress of Contemporary Painting (ICOCEP) in Porto in Portugal. Tuymans holds several academic honours, including an honorary doctorate for overall cultural merit bestowed by the Royal College of Art in 2015, an honorary doctorate bestowed by the University of Arts in Poznań in 2014, and an honorary doctorate for overall cultural merit bestowed by the University of Antwerp in 2006. In 2008, Tuymans received the Max Beckmann Foundation award at the Städelschule. In 2000, he was a finalist for the Vincent van Gogh Biennial Award for Contemporary Art in Europe and won the Coutts Contemporary Art Foundation award in Zurich. In 2013, Tuymans was awarded the Flemish Culture Award for Visual Arts and in 2020 the Ultima award for &#x27;General Cultural Merit&#x27;. In 1998, he received the biannual Culture Prize Blanlin-Evrart from the Catholic University of Leuven. In 2013, he was given the award of excellence for his artistic contributions to the fight against AIDS by the AmfAR, The Foundation for AIDS Research Awards.

==Personal life==
Tuymans was born in Mortsel near Antwerp on 14 June 1958, and he continues to live in Antwerp today. His father, Antoon Tuymans, was Belgian Flemish and his mother, Elisabeth Dam, was Dutch.

In 1995, he met the Venezuelan artist Carla Arocha while working on his first American show at The Renaissance Society in Chicago and four years later, in 1999, they married.

<text>Thirtysomething is an American drama television series created by Edward Zwick and Marshall Herskovitz for United Artists Television (under MGM/UA Television) and aired on ABC from September 29, 1987, to May 28, 1991. 

The series focuses on a group of baby boomers in their thirties who live in Philadelphia, and how they handle the lifestyle that dominated American culture during the 1980s given their involvement in the early 1970s counterculture as young adults. It premiered in the United States on September 29, 1987, and lasted four seasons. It was canceled in May 1991 by mutual agreement between the producers and the network. Zwick and Herskovitz moved on to other projects. The series won 13 Primetime Emmy Awards, out of 41 nominations, and two Golden Globe Awards.

On January 8, 2020, ABC confirmed that a television pilot, which would serve as a sequel to the series, had been ordered. The pilot was never filmed, but was set to be directed by Zwick, written by Zwick and Herskovitz, and have four members of the original cast (Ken Olin, Mel Harris, Timothy Busfield and Patricia Wettig) reprising their roles. In June 2020, ABC passed on the series.

==Plot==
An ensemble drama, the series revolves around a married couple, Michael Steadman and Hope Murdoch, and their baby, Janie. Michael&#x27;s cousin is photographer Melissa Steadman, who used to date his college friend Gary Shepherd. Gary eventually marries Susannah. Michael&#x27;s business partner is Elliot Weston, who has a troubled marriage with his wife Nancy, a painter. Hope&#x27;s childhood friend is local politician Ellyn Warren.

==Characters==
* Michael Steadman (Ken Olin) and Hope Murdoch Steadman (Mel Harris): Hope is from Philadelphia, and Michael is from Chicago but remained in the Philadelphia area after graduating from the University of Pennsylvania. Hope is a graduate of Princeton and a consumer affairs writer. After having their daughter Janie, Hope becomes a stay-at-home mother and initially gives up her writing. Later, she returns to work but struggles with her role as a mother in the process. During a difficult period in her marriage when she is pregnant with her second child, Leo, Hope contemplates having an affair with environmentalist John Dunaway (JD Souther). Michael&#x27;s confrontation with her over this leads them to resolve their problems and rekindle their marriage. Michael is Jewish, and Hope is Christian, and complications from their interfaith marriage recur throughout the series. Michael&#x27;s original ambition was to be a writer, but he works in advertising with graphic designer Elliot. The men first meet at the Bernstein Fox ad agency and then leave to form The Michael and Elliot Company. When their company goes bankrupt, Michael and Elliot join the advertising corporation DAA, run by Miles Drentell. Michael&#x27;s relationship with Miles erodes his marriage with Hope, who finally decides to accept a job in Washington, D.C. By the time the show was canceled, Michael had decided to quit work altogether so that Hope could pursue her own interests.
* Elliot Weston (Timothy Busfield) and Nancy Krieger Weston (Patricia Wettig): Elliot studied graphic design at Rhode Island School of Design (RISD). His father Charlie (Eddie Albert) is divorced from Elliot&#x27;s mother and now lives in California. Elliot&#x27;s sister Ruthie (played by Meagen Fay), who lives in Philadelphia and is married with two children, has not forgiven their father for leaving them. Elliot works in the advertising business with Michael (initially in their own business, but later for DAA). Nancy was also an art major and is a stay-at-home mother to Ethan and Brittany. Like Hope, she initially feels bored and unhappy in her role as a homemaker. After Elliot has an affair which leads to divorce proceedings, Nancy develops a career as a children&#x27;s book illustrator and author, and begins teaching at a local art center. Elliot becomes jealous after she also begins to date and finds himself once again attracted to her. Eventually, they rekindle their relationship and stop divorce proceedings. During the final two seasons, Nancy struggles with, but ultimately overcomes, ovarian cancer, which deepens their relationship. Always a rebel, Elliot can never reconcile himself to Miles&#x27; preference for Michael and his own loss of creative work at DAA, and eventually quits DAA in a fit of rage against both Miles and Michael. He and Nancy move to California, where he finds his passion in directing and eventually makes up with Michael when they accidentally bump into each other during Michael&#x27;s job interview at TBWA\Chiat\Day. Michael does not accept the job but briefly entertains the possibility of working again with Elliot to make commercials (and turns again to Miles for help in this endeavor). At the time the show was canceled, it is implied that this venture will not happen after Michael tells Hope that he will stop working so that she can pursue her own interests.
* Melissa Steadman (Melanie Mayron): Michael&#x27;s cousin and Gary&#x27;s former girlfriend, who studied photography at New York University (NYU). Her work as a photographer includes the cover of a Carly Simon album and photos in &quot;Vanity Fair&quot;. Melissa has a complicated relationship with Michael, who is frequently jealous of her career path. She has an equally complicated relationship with her mother, Elaine (Phyllis Newman), and grandmother, Rose (Sylvia Sidney). Her free-spirited sister, budding actress Jill, lives in New York (and is portrayed by Mayron&#x27;s sister Gale Mayron). In the first season, Melissa dates a divorced gynecologist who has a daughter (played by Kellie Martin) who does not want more children. Melissa later briefly dates Michael&#x27;s boss Miles; this relationship ends when his intense attraction to her nearly evolves into date rape, which she prevents and for which he apologizes. Miles never really recovers from his infatuation, but Melissa works to avoid him thereafter. Art school-dropout house painter and twenty-something Lee Owens (Corey Parker) becomes the primary focus of her romantic yearnings. They are drawn to each other, but their relationship is fraught with problems, mostly due to the age difference. After Melissa convinces Michael and Elliot to find Lee a job at DAA, the couple begins to drift apart and eventually breaks up. At the time of the show&#x27;s cancellation, they are on friendly terms again, and Gary&#x27;s &quot;ghost&quot; (as he recently died in a car accident) tells Michael that Lee and Melissa will marry and have a child.
* Ellyn Warren (Polly Draper): Hope&#x27;s childhood friend. Ellyn is an important local politician who works at City Hall. Initially dating her co-worker Steve Woodman (Terry Kinney), she later becomes involved with a married man, Jeffrey Milgrom (Richard Gilliland), who leaves his second wife for her but eventually abandons her and goes back to his first wife. After the breakup, Ellyn develops a new friendship with Gary, whom she used to dislike. Annoyed by Michael and Hope&#x27;s perpetual interference in their lives, Gary and Ellyn play a practical joke on them, implying that they are having an affair. The joke ends when Ellyn reveals she is once again involved with Billy Sidel (Erich Anderson), a comics artist and friend of Michael and Hope&#x27;s, who set them up on a blind date. Ellyn had dumped him while still seeing Jeffrey, but after they break up she bumps into Billy, and they begin to spend time together. Initially unsettled by Billy&#x27;s genuine and straightforward manner, Ellyn grows to love him. Afraid of his growing feelings for Ellyn, Billy has a one-night stand with a former girlfriend that temporarily damages his relationship with Ellyn. They eventually work through issues related to fear and trust, and marry in a ceremony at Michael and Hope&#x27;s house, held after Gary&#x27;s death.
* Gary Shepherd (Peter Horton) and Susannah Hart (Patricia Kalember): Gary, who first met Michael when they were in the same freshman dorm at University of Pennsylvania, is a free-spirited, womanizing professor of medieval literature at a Philadelphia college, and Melissa&#x27;s ex-boyfriend. When denied tenure, he thinks about becoming a social worker and meets Susannah, who works for a social welfare nonprofit. Susannah, who later admits to being shy and introverted, is initially an outcast among Gary&#x27;s friends but develops a working relationship with the group to make Gary happy. Susannah and Gary move in together after she becomes pregnant with Emma and then marry before Susannah moves to New York for a new job. Gary stays in Philadelphia as he has found a new teaching position there that he does not want to give up, even though it requires him to teach American poetry. He falls into the role of a stay-at-home dad after the move and becomes more deeply involved in his new teaching position. He turns to Nancy for help when he is assigned a course in children&#x27;s literature and does not know what to teach. Among the books Nancy recommends is &quot;Through the Looking-Glass&quot;, but she no longer owns a copy of it. Gary is on his way to visit Nancy in the hospital with a copy of the book as a gift when he is killed in a car accident. Michael, who initially cannot let go of Gary, is &quot;haunted&quot; by his ghost, who comes back to Michael through a mirror (looking glass). Michael learns to respect Susannah (who stands up to his controlling nature) as they turn to each other to cope with Gary&#x27;s passing.
* Miles Drentell (David Clennon): Michael and Elliot&#x27;s corrupt boss at DAA who styles himself as a type of Zen master. Miles is a Vietnam veteran who was once a photographer passionate about art but eventually sold out. By the time Eliot and Michael meet him, Miles is a ruthless and extremely powerful businessman whose complete lack of ethics propels Michael into periods of self-reflection and depression. Michael&#x27;s internal conflict deepens after Miles promotes him, forcing Michael to also sell out. Clennon reprised this role in the series &quot;Once and Again&quot; (1999–2002).
* Russell Weller (David Marshall Grant) is a gay friend of Melissa&#x27;s who met her while she was photographing a wedding. They became fast friends due to their mutual interest in art. His relationship with Peter Montefiore (Peter Frechette) in the 1989 episode &quot;Strangers&quot; was the subject of controversy as five of the show&#x27;s regular sponsors pulled out of the episode, costing the network approximately $1.5 million in advertising revenue. It eventually led producers to refrain from sexualizing their gay characters.

==Influences and cultural impact==
&quot;Thirtysomething&quot; was influenced by the films &quot;Return of the Secaucus 7&quot; (1980) and &quot;The Big Chill&quot; (1983). The show reflected the angst felt by baby boomers and yuppies in the United States during the 1980s, such as the changing expectations related to masculinity and femininity introduced during the era of second-wave feminism. It also introduced &quot;a new kind of hour-long drama, a series that focused on the domestic and professional lives of a group of young urban professionals, a socio-economic category of increasing interest to the television industry [...] its stylistic and story-line innovations led critics to respect it for being &#x27;as close to the level of an art form as weekly television ever gets,&#x27; as the &quot;New York Times&quot; put it.&quot; During its four-year run, &quot;Thirtysomething&quot; &quot;attracted a cult audience of viewers who strongly identified with one or more of its eight central characters, a circle of friends living in Philadelphia.&quot; Even after its cancellation in 1991, it continued to influence television programming, &quot;in everything from the look and sound of certain TV advertisements, to other series with feminine sensibilities and preoccupations with the transition from childhood to maturity (&quot;Sisters&quot;), to situation comedies about groups of friends who talk all the time (&quot;Seinfeld&quot;).&quot;
The show also influenced the British television series &quot;Cold Feet&quot;, which featured similar storylines and character types. The creator of &quot;Cold Feet&quot; wanted his show to be in the mould of successful American TV series like &quot;Thirtysomething&quot; and &quot;Frasier&quot;.

Susan Faludi, in her bestseller (1991), argues that &quot;Thirtysomething&quot; often reinforced, rather than dismantled, gender stereotypes. She suggests that it exhibited a disdainful attitude toward single, working, and feminist women (Melissa, Ellyn, and Susannah) while at the same time &quot;exalting homemakers&quot; (Hope and Nancy). In this manner, the series was seen as &quot;seemingly progressive but substantially conservative in its construction of reality.&quot;

===&quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot;===
Almost immediately after the introduction of the show, the term &quot;Thirtysomething&quot; became a catchphrase used to designate baby boomers in their thirties. This cultural shift was reinforced by the &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot;, which added &quot;Thirtysomething&quot; in 1993 (under the word &quot;thirty&quot;) and defined the term as follows:

:Draft additions 1993 - n. [popularized as a catch-phrase by the U.S. television programme thirtysomething, first broadcast in 1987] colloq. (orig. U.S.) an undetermined age between thirty and forty; spec. applied to members of the ‘baby boom’ generation entering their thirties in the mid-1980s; also attrib. or as adj. phr. (hence, characteristic of the tastes and lifestyle of this group).

==Honors and awards==
While it aired, &quot;Thirtysomething&quot; was nominated for 41 Primetime Emmy Awards, winning 13. It also won two Golden Globe awards. Later, by 1997, &quot;The Go Between&quot; and &quot;Samurai Ad Man&quot; were listed as number 22 on &quot;TV Guide&quot;″s 100 Greatest Episodes of All Time. &quot;Thirtysomething&quot; then placed the number 19 spot on &quot;TV Guide&quot;′s 50 Greatest TV Shows of All Time in 2002, and in 2013, &quot;TV Guide&quot; placed it as No. 10 in its list of The 60 Greatest Dramas of All Time.
== Sequel ==
A sequel to the series, &quot;thirtysomething(else)&quot;, was pitched in September 2019. The pilot was a co-production between MGM Television and Bedford Falls Productions, which was behind the original series, and ABC Studios, and producers were casting its four original main roles at the time of the announcement.

In February 2020, Chris Wood was cast as Leo Steadman, the show&#x27;s male lead. Over the next few weeks, Odette Annable was cast as Janey Steadman and Patrick Fugit and Auden Thornton as Ethan and Brittany Weston. Melanie Mayron and Polly Draper agreed to appear as Melissa Steadman and Ellyn Warren. On June 29, ABC decided not to move forward with the sequel.
