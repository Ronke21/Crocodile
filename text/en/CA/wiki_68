<text>&quot;Engel&quot; (German for &quot;Angel&quot; or &quot;Angels&quot;) is a song by German Industrial metal band Rammstein. It was released in April 1997 as the first single from their second album, &quot;Sehnsucht&quot;. The female part of song&#x27;s chorus is sung by Christiane &quot;Bobo&quot; Hebold of the German pop band Bobo in White Wooden Houses. An English version of &quot;Engel&quot; can be found on US special editions of &quot;Sehnsucht&quot;.
According to an interview, keyboardist Christian Lorenz came up with the main riff for this song on a synthesizer along with a whistle melody.

==Music video==
While Lindemann, Schneider and Flake are in the audience, Paul Landers can be seen taking Schneider&#x27;s place by playing the drums and Kruspe and Riedel are seen singing. The video references the 1996 film, &quot;From Dusk till Dawn&quot;.

==Live performances==
A regular during the &quot;Sehnsucht&quot; tour, it was used as the last song of the main set in non-festival concerts. In the first months of the &quot;Mutter&quot; (2001) tour, &quot;Engel&quot; appeared in the setlists sporadically, but became a regular again in November, and continued as the last song of the main set until the end of the tour.

When performed on stage, flames were shot into the air, and Schneider&#x27;s drumsticks would shoot sparks. In the &quot;Live aus Berlin&quot; shows, Bobo joined Rammstein to sing her parts from inside a flaming cage, instead of the usual pre-recorded chorus used in most of the shows. Having been excluded in the entire &quot;Reise, Reise&quot; tour, &quot;Engel&quot; returned to the setlists as the closing song of the &quot;Liebe ist für alle da&quot; tour, taking place during 2009 and 2011. This time around, vocalist Till Lindemann sang the chorus instead of Bobo&#x27;s pre-recorded lines. For the pyrotechnics, Lindemann wears a set of angel wings that shoot flames from the tips and have sparks go off along them. &quot;Engel&quot; was the penultimate song on the setlist during the &quot;Made in Germany 1995-2011&quot; tour, and the tour in 2016.

==In other media==
The song was used during the end credits of the 1997 film, &quot;Mortal Kombat Annihilation&quot;, and also appears on its soundtrack.

<text>Elyon or El Elyon ( &quot;ʼĒl ʻElyōn&quot;), is an epithet that appears in the Hebrew Bible. &#x27; is usually rendered in English as &quot;God Most High&quot;, and similarly in the [[Septuagint]] as (&quot;God the highest&quot;). The title&#x27; is a common topic of scholarly debate, sometimes interpreted as equal to the Abrahamic God, and otherwise theorized as a reference to a separate deity of its own kind, potentially above that of Yahweh.

Outside of biblical context, the term also has mundane uses, such as &quot;&quot; (where the ending in both roots is a locative, not superlative or comparative), &quot;top&quot;, or &quot;uppermost&quot;, referring simply to the position of objects (e.g. applied to a basket in Genesis 40:17 or to a chamber in Ezekiel 42:5).

==Hebrew Bible==

=== &quot;ʼĒl ʻElyōn&quot; ===
The compound name &quot;ʼĒl ʻElyōn&quot; &#x27;God Most High&#x27; occurs in Genesis 14:18–20 as the God whose priest was Melchizedek, king of Salem. The form appears again almost immediately in verse 22, used by Abraham in an oath to the king of Sodom. In this verse the name of God also occurs in apposition to ʼĒl ʻElyōn in the Masoretic Text but is absent in the Samaritan version, in the Septuagint translation, and in Symmachus. Its occurrence here was one foundation of a theory first espoused by Julius Wellhausen that ʼĒl ʻElyōn was an ancient god of Salem (Jerusalem), later equated with God. The only other occurrence of the compound expression is in : &quot;And they remembered that God [ʼĒlōhīm] &quot;was&quot; their rock, and the high God [ʼĒl ʻElyōn] their redeemer.&quot; The name is repeated later in the chapter, but with a variation: verse fifty-six says ʼElohim ʻElyōn.

It has been suggested that the reference to ʼĒl ʻElyōn, maker of heaven and earth&quot; in Genesis 14:19 and 22 reflects a Canaanite background. The phrasing in Genesis resembles a retelling of Canaanite religious traditions in Philo of Byblos&#x27;s account of Phoenician history, in which ʻElyōn was the progenitor of Ouranos (&quot;Sky&quot;) and Gaia (&quot;Earth&quot;).

===&quot;ʽElyōn&quot;===
The name &quot;ʽElyōn&quot; (Most High) standing alone is found in many poetic passages, especially in the Psalms. It appears in Balaam&#x27;s verse oracle in Numbers 24:16 as a separate name parallel to Ēl. It also appears in Moses&#x27; final song in Deuteronomy 32:8 (a much-discussed verse). A translation of the Masoretic text:

Many Septuagint manuscripts have &quot;angelōn theou&quot; (angels of God) in place of &quot;sons of Israel&quot;, while a few others have &quot;huiōn theou&quot; (sons of God). The Dead Sea Scrolls fragment 4QDeutj, however, reads &quot;bny ’lwhm, (&quot;sons of God, or sons of ’Elohim). The New Revised Standard Version translates this as &quot;he fixed the boundaries ... according to the number of the gods.&quot; However, the identification of ʽElyōn in the passage is disputed.

This passage appears to identify ʽElyōn with ’Elohim, but not necessarily with Yahweh. It can be read to mean that ʽElyōn separated mankind into 70 nations according to his 70 sons (the 70 sons of Ēl being mentioned in the Ugaritic texts), each of these sons to be the tutelary deity over one of the 70 nations, one of them being the God of Israel, Yahweh. Alternatively, it may mean that ʽElyōn, having given the other nations to his sons, now takes Israel for himself under the name of the Tetragrammaton. Both interpretations have support, although viewing ʽElyōn as a higher deity than Yahweh may be against most monotheistic standards of modern Abrahamic dogmas.

Michael Heiser argues that separating El and Yahweh is &#x27;internally inconsistent&#x27; within the Book of Deuteronomy (e.g. , ). According to Heiser, it also raises the question on why the Deuteronomists would be so careless to introduce this error, especially a few verses later, and why they didn&#x27;t quickly remove them as &#x27;intolerant monotheists&#x27;.

In Isaiah 14:13–14, ʽElyōn is used in a very mystical context in the passage providing the basis for later speculation on the fall of Satan where the rebellious prince of Babylon is pictured as boasting:
In some cases, ʽElyōn is used in reference to Yahweh, such as in Psalm 97:9:

==Non-biblical use==
Outside of the Biblical texts, the epithet &quot;Most High&quot; occurs on several occasions.

===Sefire I Treaty===

The most controversial of these uses outside the Bible is in the earliest of three Aramaic treaty inscriptions found at al-Safirah southeast of Aleppo.

The &quot;Sefire I&quot; inscription (&quot;KAI&quot; 222.I.A.8–12; &quot;ANET&quot; p. 659), which dates to about 750 BCE, lists the major patron deities of each side, all of them in pairs coupled by &quot;and&quot;, in each case a male god and the god&#x27;s spouse when the names are known. Then, after a gap comes &quot;’l wʽlyn&quot;
* This possibly means &quot;’Ēl and ʽElyōn&quot;, seemingly also two separate gods, followed by further pairs of deities.
* It is possible also that these indicate two aspects of the same god.
* It might be a single divine name. The Ugaritic texts contain divine names like &quot;Kothar waḪasis&quot; &quot;Skillful-and-Clever&quot;, &quot;Mot waShar&quot; &quot;Death-and-Prince&quot; (or possibly &quot;Death-and-Destruction&#x27;), &quot;Nikkal-and-Ib&quot;, which is in origin the name of the Sumerian goddess Ningal combined with an element of unknown meaning. Therefore, &quot;Ēl waʽElyōn&quot; might be a single name &#x27;God-and-Highest&#x27; identical in meaning with Biblical &quot;ʼĒl ʽElyōn&quot;, even though this would be unique.

Frank Moore Cross (1973) accepts all three interpretations as possibilities.

===Sanchuniathon===
In Eusebius&#x27; account of Philo of Byblos (c. 64–141 CE) record of Sanchuniathon&#x27;s euhemeristic account of the Phoenician deities, &quot;Elioun&quot;, whom he calls &quot;Hypsistos&quot; &#x27;the highest&#x27; and who is therefore likely ʿElyōn, is quite separate from his Elus/Cronus who is the supreme god Ēl. Sanchuniathon tells only:
In their time is born a certain Elioun called &quot;the Most High,&quot; and a female named Beruth, and these dwelt in the neighbourhood of Byblos.

And from them is born Epigeius or Autochthon, whom they afterwards called Sky; so that from him they named the element above us Sky because of the excellence of its beauty. And he has a sister born of the aforesaid parents, who was called Earth, and from her, he says, because of her beauty, they called the earth by the same name. And their father, the Most High, died in an encounter with wild beasts, and was deified, and his children offered to him libations and sacrifices.
According to Sanchuniathon it is from Sky and Earth that Ēl and various other deities are born, though ancient texts refer to Ēl as creator of heaven and earth. The Hittite theogony knows of a primal god named Alalu who fathered Sky (and possibly Earth) and who was overthrown by his son Sky, who was in turn overthrown by his son Kumarbi. A similar tradition seems to be at the basis of Sanchuniathon&#x27;s account.

As to Beruth who is here ʿElyōn&#x27;s wife, a relationship with Hebrew &quot;bərīt&quot; &#x27;covenant&#x27; or with the city of Beirut have both been suggested.

===Hasmonean dynasty===
The Mishnah recounts that Hasmonean rulers used to identify themselves as &quot;High Priest of El Elyon&quot;: &quot;When the Hasmonean kingdom became strong and defeated the Greeks, they instituted that people should mention the name of Heaven even in their legal documents. And therefore they would write: In year such and such of Yoḥanan the High Priest of the God Most High.&quot; Scholars have observed that the Hasmoneans used Melchizedek&#x27;s example of monarch-priest to justify occupying both offices.

<doc id="777841" wikidata="Q812900" url="?curid=777841" title="Beaconsfield, Tasmania">
<text>Beaconsfield is a former gold mining town near the Tamar River, in the north-east of Tasmania, Australia. It lies 40 kilometres north of Launceston on the West Tamar Highway. It is a rural and residential locality in the local government areas (LGA) of West Tamar and Latrobe in the Launceston and North-west and west LGA regions of Tasmania. The 2016 census has a population of 1298 for the state suburb of Beaconsfield.

== History ==

The area around Beaconsfield was first explored by Europeans in 1804 when William Paterson led an expedition to Port Dalrymple and established a settlement at York Town. Settlement of Beaconsfield itself, then known as &quot;Brandy Creek&quot; did not occur until the 1850s. Limestone mining led to the discovery of gold in 1869. Gold mining began in 1877 and the area&#x27;s population boomed. Brandy Creek Post Office opened on 1 December 1877 and was renamed &quot;Beaconsfiel&quot; in 1879.

The town was named Beaconsfield in 1879 in honour of Benjamin Disraeli, 1st Earl of Beaconsfield, who was the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom at the time. In 1881, the Beaconsfield newspaper was called the &quot;Beaconsfield Tickler&quot;. 
In 1953, Beaconsfield was the first town in Australia to fluoridate the water supply.
Beaconsfield was gazetted as a locality in 1967.

==Geography==
The waters of the Tamar River estuary form part of the northern boundary.

==Road infrastructure==
The West Tamar Highway (Route A7) passes through from south-east to north-east. Route C720 (Greens Beach Road) starts at an intersection with A7 and runs north-west until it exits. Route C715 (Holwell Road) starts at an intersection with C720 and runs south until it exits. Route A7 (now called West Arm Road) rejoins Greens Beach Road just inside the northern boundary.

== Gold mining at Beaconsfield ==
Gold was first discovered in Beaconsfield in 1847. When the gold rush hit Victoria and New South Wales in 1851 and the Tasmanian Government offered a reward for the discovery of a payable goldfield. 
In 1877 the cap of a payable gold reef was discovered on the eastern slope of Cabbage Tree Hill by brothers William and David Dally. This became known as the fabulous Tasmanian Reef. 
In October 1877 the Dally brothers sold their claim on the Tasmania Reef to William D Grubb &amp; William Hart for 15,000 pounds, and 1/10 share in any company formed.

At the peak of the gold rush 700 men were employed in the gold mine and 26 tonne of gold was recovered.

An early settler at the time, Mr Campbell wrote that, &quot;the blacks were here in those days…. On each side was nothing but thick tea tree scrub and snakes…. When the rush for gold was discovered there was only two shops, drapery and grocery but soon the little township swarmed with people. More shops, hotels, dance halls and hall were built for plays to come to the town which they did in plenty. There came circuses and the children got excited and followed to see the horses and elephants going through the town to get somewhere to camp and build their tents. Those entertainments came very often because there was plenty of money about

The town began its early life as &quot;Brandy Creek&quot; because of the colour of the water in the creek where the gold was originally discovered. 
&quot;The growing civic consciousness found voice in the demand for a new name for the town and in March 1879 Brandy Creek was renamed Beaconsfield, after Lord Beaconsfield, (Benjamin Disraeli)&quot;, (Town With a History by Coultman Smith, 2006) the then Prime Minister of the United Kingdom at the time &quot;in a ceremony conducted Governor Weld after he rejected a suggestion that it should be named after him&quot;.

In 1903 an English company bought the Tasmanian Gold Mining and Quartz Crushing company and formed the Tasmanian Gold Mining Company Ltd. As water had become such a huge problem at Beaconsfield, a substantial injection of capital was required to purchase and operate suitable dewatering equipment. The Company extracted gold from two shafts adjacent to each other, Grubb and Hart Shafts. In 1904 engine houses were built at these shafts and a central boiler house. These buildings now house the Beaconsfield Mine &amp; Heritage Centre.

Underground mining began in 1879 with the sinking and development of three main shafts to access the reef: the &quot;Hart Shaft&quot;, the &quot;Main Shaft&quot; and the &quot;Grubb Shaft&quot;.

Beaconsfield became the richest gold town in Tasmania. In 1881 there were 53 companies working the field. These were all absorbed by the owners of the &quot;Tasmania mine&quot;.

The gold mine closed in 1914 due to regular flooding of the shafts but re-opened in 1999 with mixed success. To 1914, the mine was worked to a depth of 450 metres and produced 800,000 ounces of gold. In 1982, the &quot;Grubb Shaft Gold &amp; Heritage Museum&quot; was established,(now called the Beaconsfield Mine &amp; Heritage Centre url www.beaconsfieldheritage.com.au) with displays relating to the former gold mining era operating since 1984.

During the 1970s exploration drilling confirmed that the reef continued at least another 200 metres below the old workings. By 1991 the old Hart Shaft collar had been re-established and water pumped out to 160 metres deep. The project was suspended until 1992 when the mine&#x27;s owners changed. Deep drilling resumed in 1993 to review the resource estimates and, from 1994, the &quot;Beaconsfield Mine Joint Venture&quot; has carried out drilling of the depth extension of the Tasmania Reef. A permanent stage pumping station 181 m below ground had been lowering the water in the shaft since August 1995. The permanent winder and head frame were completed in January 1996 and the shaft finished in late 1996. An ore treatment plant was built during the 1999/2000 financial year.

In the financial year 2004/05, 240 685 tonnes of ore was produced from which 3890 kilograms of gold was extracted.

In 2006 the participants in the unincorporated Beaconsfield Mine Joint Venture (BMJV), which operated the Beaconsfield Mine, were the Allstate group (Asx:ALX - delisted) with a 51.51% interest and the Beaconsfield Gold group (Asx:BCD - delisted) with a 48.49% interest.
Allstate managed the BMJV, with the mine manager, and all personnel reporting to him, employed by Allstate.

===2006 mine collapse===

On Tuesday 25 April 2006, a small earthquake caused a rock fall in the Beaconsfield gold mine. Fourteen miners escaped safely, one miner, Larry Knight, was killed, and the remaining two, Todd Russell and Brant Webb, were trapped in a shaft approximately one kilometre underground. The two trapped miners were found alive five days later on Sunday 30 April. Rescue operations continued for nearly two weeks until the two miners were freed on Tuesday 9 May.

In September 2007, the Foo Fighters released a tribute (&quot;Ballad of the Beaconsfield Miners&quot;) to the miners on their album Echoes, Silence, Patience &amp; Grace.

The Beaconsfield gold mining operations finally ended with the closure of the mine in June 2012.

== Water fluoridation ==
On 30 September 1953 Beaconsfield was the first town in Australia to add fluoride to its water supply. The municipal chemist at the time, Frank Grey, produced a report for the town council detailing evidence from studies in the USA that supported water fluoridation to improve dental health. With permission of the Tasmanian Director of Public Health and the Chief Health Inspector, Grey oversaw the introduction of fluoride to the town water supply.

In an interview in 2019 Frank Grey&#x27;s daughter, Jeanette, added a personal note about her father&#x27;s fluoride promotion. At the time she was a budding singer and had been told that keeping her teeth was necessary to sing well. She claims this further prompted Grey to follow the research occurring in the USA.

On the 50th anniversary of this first water fluoridation in Australia a monument was erected in Beaconsfield at West Street, near the Grubb Shaft Museum &quot;by the Australian Dental Association in gratitude to Mr Frank Grey, the Beaconsfield Municipal Council and the people of West Tamar in their role in the introduction of fluoride to Australia&quot;.

== Population ==
At the 2016 census, Beaconsfield had a population of 1,298. 82.9% of people were born in Australia and 91.2% of people only spoke English at home. The most common responses for religion were No Religion 38.6%, Anglican 25.2% and Catholic 11.1%.

<doc id="777845" wikidata="Q515887" url="?curid=777845" title="Raymond Leo Burke">
<text>Raymond Leo Burke (born June 30, 1948) is an American prelate of the Catholic Church. He is a bishop and a cardinal, and was a patron of the Sovereign Military Order of Malta from 2014 to 2023. He led the Archdiocese of St. Louis from 2004 to 2008 and the Diocese of La Crosse from 1995 to 2004. From 2008 to 2014, he was the prefect of the Supreme Tribunal of the Apostolic Signatura.

A canon lawyer, Burke is a voice of traditionalism among prelates of the Catholic Church. He established a reputation as a conservative leader while serving in La Crosse and St. Louis. Burke is a major proponent of the Tridentine Mass, having frequently offered it and conferred ordinations on traditionalist priests. He has criticized what he sees as deficiencies in the post-1969 Mass of Paul VI. He is frequently seen as a &quot;de facto&quot; leader of the Church&#x27;s conservative wing.

Burke has publicly clashed with Pope Francis, vigorously opposing attempts by other bishops to relax church attitudes towards gay people and those Catholics who have divorced and remarried outside the church. Burke has opined that Catholic politicians who support legalized abortion, including American presidential candidate John Kerry and United States President Joe Biden, should not receive the Eucharist. While Burke has denied allegations of disloyalty to Pope Francis, a number of Burke&#x27;s statements have been interpreted as criticisms, once mentioning the possible need to &quot;formally correct&quot; the pope in relation to . This has led to a backlash from some Catholics towards Burke.

In September 2015, the Vatican announced that Burke had been reappointed to the Congregation for the Causes of Saints, from which he had been removed in December 2013, but not to his more influential positions on the Congregation for Bishops and the Apostolic Signatura. In 2016, he was not reappointed as a member of the Congregation for Divine Worship. In February 2017, Burke was again sidelined when Pope Francis appointed Archbishop Giovanni Angelo Becciu as his special delegate to the Sovereign Military Order of Malta, with exclusive responsibility for the duties which would normally be exercised by Burke as its patron. Albrecht von Boeselager, the order&#x27;s grand chancellor, announced that this meant Burke was &quot;&quot;de facto&quot; suspended&quot; from the patronage. Pope Francis reappointed him as a rank-and-file member of the Apostolic Signatura in September 2017. In November 2023, Pope Francis reportedly evicted Burke from his subsidized Vatican apartment and removed his salary as a retired cardinal.

==Early life==
Raymond Burke was born on June 30, 1948, in Richland Center, Wisconsin, the youngest of the six children of Thomas F. and Marie B. Burke. He is of Irish heritage, with ancestors from counties Cork and Tipperary descending from the de Burgh family, Normans who settled in Ireland in the twelfth century. In Ireland the family name eventually became Bourke or Burke. Burke attended St. Mary&#x27;s Parish School in Richland Center from 1954 to 1959.

The Burke family later moved to Stratford, Wisconsin. From 1962 to 1968, he attended Holy Cross Seminary in La Crosse, Wisconsin. From 1968 to 1971, he studied at the Catholic University of America in Washington, D.C., as a Basselin scholar, receiving a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1970 and a Master of Arts degree in 1971, both in philosophy. He completed studies for the priesthood at the Pontifical Gregorian University in Rome between 1971 and 1975, receiving a Bachelor of Sacred Theology degree and a Master of Arts degree.

During his studies, Burke resided at the Pontifical North American College with 10 future bishops and two future cardinals – Blase J. Cupich and James Harvey. Pope Paul VI ordained Burke to the priesthood for the Diocese of La Crosse on June 29, 1975, in St. Peter&#x27;s Basilica.

==Priestly ministry==
After his 1975 ordination, the diocese assigned Burke as assistant rector of the Cathedral of St. Joseph the Workman in La Crosse, Wisconsin. He also taught religion at Aquinas High School in La Crosse.

In 1980, Burke returned to Rome to study canon law at the Gregorian University. He received a licentiate in canon law in 1982 and a doctorate in canon law in 1984. He then returned to La Crosse, where Bishop John Joseph Paul appointed him as moderator of the curia and vice chancellor of the La Crosse diocese. In 1989, Pope John Paul II named Burke as the first American defender of the bond of the Supreme Tribunal of the Apostolic Signatura, the highest ecclesiastical court in the Catholic Church.

==Episcopal ministry==

===Bishop of La Crosse===
On December 10, 1994, John Paul II named Burke as bishop of La Crosse and consecrated him on January 6, 1995, at St. Peter&#x27;s Basilica. Burke took possession of the see of La Crosse on February 22, 1995.

In 2000, Burke convened the fifth diocesan synod for the diocese, which was followed by the publication of &quot;Synod V, acts: celebrated June 11–14, 2000&quot; in 2003. In 2002, he was influential in founding the Canons Regular of the New Jerusalem. This was an order of Augustinian canons who were dedicated to the Tridentine Mass, the traditional form of the liturgy in the Latin Church.

Burke&#x27;s tenure in La Crosse generated controversy. One issue was the construction of the $25 million Shrine of Our Lady of Guadalupe, with critics saying that the money used should have gone to the poor, Burke defended the shrine as a fruitful way to raise spiritual devotion. A second issue was the diocese&#x27;s withdrawal from the annual Crop Walk sponsored by the Church World Service. Burke objected to the event because some of the money raised was being used to purchase condoms in developing countries.

Burke also welcomed numerous traditional orders to his diocese, including the Institute of Christ the King Sovereign Priest (ICKSP), whose priests offer exclusively the Tridentine Mass. Two priests left the diocese as a result of his policies. Burke closed a number of schools while also raising teachers&#x27; salaries. His style was noted by some of his aides to be more formal than that of his predecessor, Bishop Paul. Burke&#x27;s aides described him as being warm and approachable in private. During his tenure, the diocese continued to participate in charitable efforts while also increasing its moral and political activism.

===Archbishop of St. Louis===

On December 2, 2003, John Paul II named Burke as archbishop of St. Louis, succeeding Cardinal Justin Rigali. Burke was installed on January 26, 2004, and was presented with the pallium on June 29, 2004, by John Paul II.

In St. Louis, Burke emphasized the promotion of vocations to the priesthood. He also published a column in the archdiocesan weekly newspaper, the &quot;Saint Louis Review&quot;. Burke established an oratory for Catholics desiring to worship according to the traditional form. As he had done in La Crosse, he invited the Institute of Christ the King Sovereign Priest (ICKSP) into the archdiocese and ordained priests for ICKSP, both in the U.S. and abroad. His ordination of two ICKSP priests in 2007, in a solemn pontifical high mass, marked the first use in 40 years of the Tridentine rite of ordination in the Cathedral Basilica of St. Louis. In 2006, Missouri voters approved an amendment to the state constitution permitting embryonic stem cell research. In reaction, Burke stated that: &quot;our tiniest brothers and sisters ... will be made legally the subjects, the slaves, of those who wish to manipulate and destroy their lives for the sake of supposed scientific and technological progress.&quot;During his tenure, Burke escalated a long-running dispute over the attempted closing of St. Stanislaus Kostka Church and the ownership of its significant assets. After Reverend Marek Bozek led a Christmas Eve Mass in 2005 despite the archdiocese&#x27;s previous attempted closure of the parish, Burke &quot;declare[d] that the church was in &#x27;schism&#x27;&quot;, a designation that led to the excommunication of Bozek and the church&#x27;s lay board. In 2012, a state court ruled against the diocese and sided with the congregation, now an independent Catholic church, and awarded it full ownership of the significant parish assets.

In July 2006, Pope Benedict XVI appointed Burke as a member of the Supreme Tribunal of the Apostolic Signatura. On May 6, 2008, Benedict XVI named Burke as a member of the Pontifical Council for Legislative Texts, which interprets canon law, and as a member of the Congregation for the Clergy.

===Prefect of the Apostolic Signatura===
On June 27, 2008, Benedict XVI appointed Burke as prefect of the Supreme Tribunal. Over the next several years, Benedict XVI named Burke to several dicasteries of the Roman Curia:

On March 11, 2010, in the wake of the sexual abuse scandal in Europe, Burke said that the Vatican needed to prepare a document that outlined a set of explicit guidelines rooted in canon law. This document would guide bishops and their local tribunals in reporting sexual abuse cases to the Vatican so as to speed up the process of justice. Burke also recommended changes to the high levels of secrecy in the existing process.

===Cardinal===

On November 20, 2010, Benedict XVI named Burke as cardinal-deacon of Sant&#x27;Agata dei Goti, the fifth archbishop of St. Louis to become a member of the College of Cardinals. On February 5, 2011, the memorial of Saint Agatha, Burke took canonical possession of his titular church in Rome.

In October 2012, Burke was appointed as president of the Commission for Controversies at the 13th Ordinary General Assembly of the Synod of Bishops. After Benedict XVI retired from office, Burke served as a cardinal electors in the 2013 papal conclave that elected Pope Francis.

On December 16, 2013, Francis made extensive changes to the Congregation for Bishops and declined to reappoint Burke to its membership. Some observers speculated that Francis took this action because Burke took &quot;a more aggressive line than the pope on the Western culture wars&quot;. According to the former apostolic nuncio to the United States Carlo Maria Viganò, Cardinal Theodore McCarrick influenced Francis to remove Burke. After ten years as cardinal deacon, Burke exercised his option to assume the rank of cardinal priest, which Pope Francis confirmed on May 3, 2021.

===Patron of the Order of Malta===
On November 4, 2014, at the 2014 Synod on the Family, Burke stated that &quot;There is a strong sense that the church is like a ship without a rudder.&quot; However, he balanced his critique by stating that he did not want it to be interpreted as a criticism of Francis. On November 8, four days later, Francis removed Burke as prefect of the Apostolic Signatura and named him as patron of the Sovereign Military Order of Malta. This was a largely ceremonial post that the pope usually bestowed on a retired cardinal or as a secondary job to an active one.

Many thought that Francis dismissed Burke as prefect due to the &quot;ship without a rudder&quot; comment at the Synod. Francis denied it, saying that he wanted a &quot;smart American&quot; to serve as patron of the Order of Malta. Francis also said that he had planned to move Burke long before the Synod took place, as part of a larger reorganization of the Vatican bureaucracy. However, Francis wanted Burke to participate in the synod as the head of a Vatican department.

On September 26, 2015, Francis named Burke a member of the Congregation for the Causes of Saints.

In early 2017, press reports revealed that Burke and Grand Master Matthew Festing of the Order of Malta had tried to oust the German lawyer Albrecht Freiherr von Boeselager from his position as chancellor of the Order. This was because von Boeslager had authorized the Order to purchase condoms for people in Myanmar, in contradiction to official Catholic teaching on artificial contraception. On February 2, 2017, Francis sidelined Burke as the patron of the Order. The pope named Archbishop Giovanni Angelo Becciu as his special delegate to the Order, with exclusive responsibility for the duties normally exercised by the patron. On February 21, von Boeselager confirmed that Burke was &quot;&quot;de facto&quot; suspended&quot; as patron.

In November 2016, Francis removed Burke from the Congregation for Divine Worship. This appeared be in response to the &quot;dubia&quot; (Latin for &quot;doubts&quot;) that Burke and three other cardinals submitted in response to the 2016 papal exhortation, &quot;Amoris laetitia.&quot; The cardinals believed that &quot;Amoris laetitia.&quot; contradicted Catholic moral teaching in the treatment of divorced persons. Burke had indicated that if Francis did not respond to the &quot;dubia,&quot; the cardinals would probably issue a “formal correction” of Francis.

In February 2017, Burke presided over a five-judge panel at the church trial of Archbishop Anthony Sablan Apuron of the Diocese of Agaña in Guam on charges of sexual abuse of minors. In March 2018, the court found Apuron guilty and ordered that he be removed from office. In September 2017, Francis reappointed Burke as a rank and file member of the Supreme Tribunal of the Apostolic Signatura, but he did not regain his earlier position as prefect.

On June 19, 2023, Francis named Cardinal Gianfranco Ghirlanda to succeed Burke as patron of the Order of Malta. At that time Burke was 74 years old, short of the customary retirement age of 75, and Ghirlanda was aged 80. In November 2023, Francis reportedly evicted Burke from his subsidized Vatican apartment and terminated his salary as a retired cardinal.

===Institute for Human Dignity and Holy League===
Burke previously chaired the advisory board of the Institute for Human Dignity, a Catholic-inspired non-governmental organization based in Rome. Burke terminated his relationship with the institute in June 2019 after it was publicly identified with the political program of Steve Bannon.

In March 2015, the Holy League, an organization base in Wisconsin, appointed Burke as its leader. The modern Holy League describes itself as a parish-based network of men united in devotion to the Blessed Sacrament.

== Criticism of Burke ==
Burke&#x27;s perceived status as an ultra-conservative and opponent of Francis has led to criticism. According to a 2015 article in &quot;National Catholic Reporter&quot; (&quot;NCR&quot;), some bishops have refused permission for Burke to host conferences in their dioceses, and a number of priests have accused him of &quot;spreading propaganda against the Pope&quot;.

In a July 2019 editorial, the &quot;NCR&quot; rebuked Burke for wanting to &quot;reconstitute the clericalism that is at the heart of the sex abuse cover-up scandal which continues to undermine the authority of the church.&quot; &quot;NCR&quot; also accused Burke of trying &quot;to replace the dynamism of Francis&#x27; model of accompaniment with a return to a statute-bound and static institution in service of itself.&quot; &quot;NCR&quot; labeled him as:&quot;the modern version of that religious leader that drew some of Jesus&#x27; harshest condemnations, those who placed undue burdens on others and pronounced themselves the undisputed bearers of truth.&quot; Catholic academic Mark Silk in September 2023 accused Burke of committing the heresy of &quot;Americanism&quot; condemned by Pope Leo XIII, and of disobeying the pope. In a November 2023 &quot;New York Times&quot; article, the writer Ruth Graham said that some commentators viewed Burke&#x27;s conflicts with Francis and the Vatican as symbolic of an ongoing large-scale conflict &quot;between a more progressive Vatican and the American church&quot;.

==Views==

=== Synodality ===
During his &quot;Wanderer&quot; interview, Burke also criticized the concept of synodality, in which the pope transmits some of his authority to the bishops. &quot;In listening to the Pope, one is given the impression that he is giving more and more authority to individual bishops and Conferences of Bishops. But this is not the Catholic Church&quot;, Burke said. He accused promoters of synodality of attempting to effect a &quot;revolution&quot; in the church, which he said would result in Catholicism being practiced differently in various countries, to the overall detriment of the church.

=== Ecumenicism ===
On June 10, 2019, Burke, Cardinal Jānis Pujats, and Bishops Tomasz Peta, Jan Paul Lenga, and Athanasius Schneider published a 40-point &quot;Declaration of Truths&quot; that set out to reaffirm traditional church teaching. The clerics wrote that such a declaration was necessary in a time of &quot;almost universal doctrinal confusion and disorientation.&quot; Specific passages in the declaration implicitly related to several writings by Francis, and some of them were seen as criticism or even opposition.

The declaration states that &quot;the religion born of faith in Jesus Christ&quot; is the &quot;only religion positively willed by God.&quot; This statement seemingly alluded to the &quot;Document on Human Fraternity&quot; issued by Francis on February 4, 2019, which stated that the &quot;diversity of religions&quot; is &quot;willed by God.&quot; Following recent changes to the Catechism of the Catholic Church to oppose capital punishment, the declaration states that the church &quot;did not err&quot; in teaching that civil authorities may &quot;lawfully exercise capital punishment&quot; when it is &quot;truly necessary&quot; to preserve the &quot;just order of societies&quot;.

===Pope Francis===
Burke is widely viewed as a leader of the conservative wing of the church, and &quot;de facto&quot; leader in the United States to those who oppose Francis. Shortly after Francis in 2013 declined to reappoint Burke to the Congregation of Bishops, Burke said,&quot;One gets the impression, or it&#x27;s interpreted this way in the media, that he thinks we&#x27;re talking too much about abortion, too much about the integrity of marriage as between one man and one woman. But we can never talk enough about that.&quot;
Burke in early 2014 denied that Francis planned to change Catholic teaching on moral issues. He said that people &quot;hardened against the truth&quot; would claim that Francis wants to change church teachings that today&#x27;s secularized culture rejects. He also said &quot;their false praise of the Holy Father&#x27;s approach mocks the fact that he is the Successor of Saint Peter&quot;, and that he consequently &quot;rejects the acceptance and praise of the world&quot;. Francis spoke favorably of Burke in 2017, saying, &quot;I do not see Cardinal Burke as an enemy.&quot; He also called Burke &quot;an excellent lawyer.&quot;

An interim document from the 2014 Synod of Bishops softened the Catholic Church&#x27;s language on LGBT Catholics, artificial contraception, divorced Catholics and Catholics in civil marriages. Burke said that the response to the document by some bishops showed that &quot;a great number of the Synod Fathers found it objectionable.&quot; In an October 2014 interview with &quot;The Catholic World Report&quot;, Burke said the interim document &quot;lacks a solid foundation in the Sacred Scriptures and the Magisterium [the teaching authority of the Catholic Church] and gives the impression of inventing a totally new, what one member of the Synod called &#x27;revolutionary&#x27;, teaching on marriage and the family.&quot;

In an October 17, 2014, interview with &quot;BuzzFeed News&quot;, Burke said that if &quot;Pope Francis had selected certain cardinals to steer the meeting [synod] so as to advance his personal views on matters like divorce and the treatment of LGBT people&quot;, he would not be observing his mandate as the leader of the Catholic Church.

In an interview with &quot;The Wanderer&quot; on January 10, 2019, Burke denounced Francis&#x27;s September 2018 Holy See–China Agreement. This was an agreement between the Vatican and the Chinese Government on Catholic jurisdiction in China. Burke call the agreement &quot;in effect ... a repudiation of generations of martyrs and confessors of the Faith in China&quot;.

On June 10, 2019, Burke, Cardinal Jānis Pujats, and bishops Tomasz Peta, Jan Paul Lenga, and Athanasius Schneider published a 40-point &quot;Declaration of Truths&quot; claiming to reaffirm traditional church teaching. The bishops wrote that such a declaration was necessary in a time of &quot;almost universal doctrinal confusion and disorientation.&quot; Specific passages in the declaration implicitly related to several writings by Francis, and some of them were seen as criticism or even opposition. The declaration states that &quot;the religion born of faith in Jesus Christ&quot; is the &quot;only religion positively willed by God,&quot; seemingly alluding to the &quot;Document on Human Fraternity&quot; signed by Pope Francis on February 4, which stated that the &quot;diversity of religions&quot; is &quot;willed by God.&quot; Following recent changes to the Catechism of the Catholic Church to oppose capital punishment, the declaration states that the church &quot;did not err&quot; in teaching that civil authorities may &quot;lawfully exercise capital punishment&quot; when it is &quot;truly necessary&quot; to preserve the &quot;just order of societies&quot;.

In September 2019, Burke and Schneider published an 8-page letter denouncing what they alleged to be six theological errors in the working document for the Synod of Bishops for the Pan-Amazon region and asking that Francis &quot;confirm his brethren in the faith by an unambiguous rejection of the errors.&quot; Burke and Schneider criticized the document for its &quot;implicit pantheism,&quot; support for married clergy and a greater role for women in the liturgy, and for what they considered to be excessive openness to pagan rituals and practices common among the Amazonian peoples. The cardinals asked the laity and the clergy pray at least one decade of the Rosary and fast weekly for the rejection of such ideas over a 40-day period, from September 17 to October 26.

=== Embryonic stem-cell research ===
In 2007, the singer Sheryl Crow, an advocate for embryonic stem-cell research, was scheduled to perform at a benefit concert for the Cardinal Glennon Children&#x27;s Hospital in St. Louis. Burke stated that by hosting Crow, the hospital would give &quot;...the impression that the Church is somehow inconsistent in its teaching.&quot; He requested that the hospital revoke the invitation; when the hospital refused, Burke resigned from its board on April 25, 2007.

===Abortion ===
During the 2004 US presidential election, Burke stated that he would not give the eucharist to US Senator John Kerry or other Catholic politicians who publicly supported abortion rights for women. &quot;One of the problems I have is bishops who say to me, &#x27;Well, this is unheard of in the church&#x27;s practice.&#x27; Actually it goes back to St. Paul in the (First) Letter to the Corinthians, when he says: The person who eats and drinks the body and blood of Christ unworthily eats and drinks condemnation unto himself,&quot;Burke also wrote a pastoral letter in 2004 saying Catholics should not vote for politicians who support abortion or other &quot;anti-life&quot; practices. Burke in June 2004 clarified his position, stating that one could vote for a pro-abortion politician and not commit a mortal sin, if one believed there was a more significant moral issue than abortion at hand. However, he also stated that he could not think of such an issue.

In a September 2008 interview with &quot;Catholic News Service&quot;, Burke said that &quot;the Democratic Party risks transforming itself definitively into a &#x27;party of death&#x27;, because of its choices on bio-ethical questions&quot;, especially elective abortion. In 2008, Burke urged Saint Louis University to discipline its men&#x27;s basketball coach, Rick Majerus. This came after Majerus publicly supported abortion rights for women and embryonic stem cell research at a campaign event for US Senator Hillary Clinton. Burke stated:&quot;When you take a position in a Catholic university, you don&#x27;t have to embrace everything the Catholic Church teaches. But you can&#x27;t make statements which call into question the identity and mission of the Catholic Church.&quot; Saint Louis University refused Burke&#x27;s request, stating that Majerus had a right to express personal views when not serving as a university representative. In March 2009, Burke called on American bishops to withhold the eucharist from Catholic politicians who support abortion rights for women. The bishops&#x27; failure to do so, Burke said, &quot;is weakening the faith of everyone. It&#x27;s giving the impression that it must be morally correct to support procured abortion.&quot; He also said that any American president who promotes and implements &quot;anti-life&quot; legislation could be an &quot;agent of death&quot;. Burke later said that he made his remarks not as prefect of the Apostolic Signatura, but simply as an American bishop. Two months later in May, Burke stated, &quot;Since President [Barack] Obama clearly announced, during the election campaign, his anti-life and anti-family agenda, a Catholic who knew his agenda regarding, for example, procured abortion, embryonic-stem-cell research, and same-sex marriage, could not have voted for him with a clear conscience.&quot; During the election, Obama had not officially called for same-sex marriage, but had advocated same-sex civil unions. In February 2013, Burke commented on the Irish abortion debate, stating that, in accordance with canon law, priests should exclude politicians who support abortion from receiving the eucharist. Burke has stated that anyone who supports abortion cannot receive the eucharist. &quot;I can&#x27;t imagine that any Catholic wouldn&#x27;t know that abortion is a grievous sin, but if they don&#x27;t, once they&#x27;ve been told, then they either have to cease to support abortion or accept the fact they are not a Catholic in good standing and therefore should not present themselves for Holy Communion,&quot;In 2017, Burke said that Donald Trump&#x27;s victory in the 2016 US presidential election was a win for anti-abortion causes. In an August 2019 interview, Burke criticized Catholics who disagree with the church teachings on certain issues. &quot;I&#x27;ve had non-Catholic leaders of government in this nation tell me that they were certain that the Catholic teaching on abortion and so-called same-sex marriage have changed because so many Catholics on Capitol Hill are regularly supporting this kind of legislation. And that&#x27;s a scandal,&quot; Singling out US Vice President Joe Biden, Burke told such people not to attempt to receive the eucharist. &quot;It&#x27;s not a punishment. It&#x27;s actually a favor to these people to tell them don&#x27;t approach, because if they approach, they commit sacrilege.&quot; Burke in August 2019 denounced US Senator Kamala Harris for her criticisms of US District Judge Brian Buescher and his affiliation with the Knights of Columbus Burke said that people &quot;need to look at that kind of statement for what it is and say this isn&#x27;t a person who I want to be the leader of my nation.&quot;

===Role of women in the church and priest shortage===
In June 2008, Burke as the archbishop of St. Louis applied an interdict, which excludes a person from church ministries and the sacraments, to a Sister of Charity, Louise Lears, judging her guilty of three grave canonical offenses against the Catholic Church&#x27;s faith and teachings. Lears, a pastoral worker and educator, had publicly stated her belief that all of the church&#x27;s ministries, including the priesthood, should be open to women. Lears received the interdict after attending an ordination ceremony, which the church does not recognize, of a woman to the priesthood at a Jewish synagogue by the WomenPriests movement.

In January 2015, Burke gave an interview to an organization called the New Project. The group was formed to confront what it called a &quot;man crisis&quot; in the Catholic Church. In the interview, Burke agreed the so-call &quot;feminization&quot; of the Catholic Church was alienating male Catholics. He claimed that &quot;radical feminism&quot; had &quot;assaulted the Church and society since the 1960s has left men very marginalized&quot; and led the Church to de-emphasize issues important to men, such as chivalry and sacrifice.

Burke has specifically criticized the introduction of female altar servers as a side effect of this feminization. He claimed that female altar servers discouraged boys from serving. &quot;The introduction of girl servers also led many boys to abandon altar service&quot;, Burke said. &quot;Young boys don&#x27;t want to do things with girls. It&#x27;s just natural. The girls were also very good at altar service. So many boys drifted away over time.&quot; Burke also linked the decline of men entering the priesthood with the decline of male altar servers. Burke has said that it requires&quot;...certain manly discipline to serve as an altar boy in service at the side of a priest, and most priests have their first deep experiences of the liturgy as altar boys. If we are not training young men as altar boys, giving them an experience of serving God in the liturgy, we should not be surprised that vocations have fallen dramatically.&quot;

In an August 2015 interview with the &quot;Independent&quot;, Burke blamed pedophile priests on &quot;radical feminism which has assaulted the Church and society since the 1960s.&quot;

===LGBT community and same-sex marriage===
Burke is a strong critic and opponent of moves to soften Catholic attitudes towards the LGBTQ community and to permit greater acceptance of gay people within the church. In a 2013 interview with &quot;The Wanderer,&quot; Burke said that same-sex marriage,&quot;...is a work of deceit, a lie about the most fundamental aspect of our human nature, our human sexuality, which, after life itself, defines us. There is only one place these types of lies come from, namely Satan. It is a diabolical situation which is aimed at destroying individuals, families, and eventually our nation.&quot;In an October 2014 interview with the &quot;Huffington Post,&quot; Burke referred to same-sex relationships as &quot;profoundly disordered and harmful&quot;, stating that parents should not &quot;expose [their] children to that.&quot; He suggested that parents not allow contact between their children and sexually-active LGBT people, including at family gatherings such as Christmas. In November 2014, Burke argued that Francis had never approved homosexual acts, adding that it was &quot;impossible to find positive elements in an evil act.&quot;
Speaking in Oxford after the May 2015 same-sex marriage referendum in Ireland, Burke said that he struggled to understand &quot;any nation redefining marriage ... I mean, this is a defiance of God. It&#x27;s just incredible. Pagans may have tolerated homosexual behaviors, they never dared to say this was marriage.&quot; Archbishop Eamon Martin of Armagh distanced himself from Burke&#x27;s remarks, urging individuals &quot;to try to be respectful and inoffensive in language&quot; wherever possible.

In an April 2017 interview with the &quot;Tablet&quot;, Burke described homosexuality as an &quot;ailment&quot; which is not genetic but largely depended on a person&#x27;s environment.

In August 2017, Burke criticized Cardinal Reinhard Marx&#x27;s assertion that Germany&#x27;s recent legalization of same-sex marriage should not be a major concern for the Catholic Church there. Burke said Marx&#x27;s remarks showed how the church lacked &quot;the clarity and the courage to announce the Gospel of Life and Divine Love to the radically secularized culture&quot;. Burke alluded to so-called diabolical errors spreading from society to Church leaders, raising concerns that the &quot;end times&quot; were nearing, and once again stating that homosexual acts were sinful. He insisted that the correct approach would distinguish between the love for the person and the hatred Catholics &quot;must always have for sinful acts&quot;.

In a 2019 interview with the &quot;Wanderer&quot;, Burke chastised some of his fellow bishops for their supposed failures in keeping church teaching. He believes that &quot;pressure groups&quot; within the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops (USCCB) had been attempting to soften the church&#x27;s attitude on homosexuality. He accused them of trying to remove the description &quot;intrinsically disordered&quot; from the discussion of homosexual acts in the catechism, a change which Burke said is &quot;not possible.&quot; Burke went on, &quot;There is definitely within the hierarchy of the United States an element which is not coherent with the Church on these issues.&quot; He then criticized prelates who &quot;promote Fr. James Martin ... within their dioceses.&quot; Martin was an American Jesuit who had written articles and made television appearances on improving Catholic treatment of LGBTQ members. Burke alleged that Martin &quot;is not coherent with the Church&#x27;s teaching on homosexuality&quot; and said that such promotion is &quot;an indication to us that there is a serious difficulty within the hierarchy that must be addressed.&quot;

In February 2019 Burke penned an open letter with Cardinal Walter Brandmuller addressed to Francis, calling for an end of &quot;the plague of the homosexual agenda,&quot; which they blamed for the sexual abuse crisis engulfing the Catholic Church. They claimed the agenda was spread by &quot;organized networks&quot; protected by a &quot;conspiracy of silence.&quot;

===Divorce===
Burke has opposed any change of church doctrine that would allow Catholics with civil divorces to remarry or receive the eucharist once they enter a second civil marriage. In 2013 he co-authored a book with cardinals Gerhard Ludwig Müller and George Pell on the subject.
In an interview in the German daily &quot;Die Welt&quot; on April 24, 2015, concerning the Fourteenth Ordinary General Assembly of the Synod of Bishops, Burke renewed his criticism of German Cardinal Walter Kasper, whose &quot;merciful&quot; solution for remarried divorcees who wish to receive communion was discussed at the 2014 Extraordinary Synod. “We are bound by the Magisterium. But some Synod Fathers, above all Cardinal Kasper, want to change it. So I had to make myself very clear. Clashes at Synods, incidentally, are nothing unusual. Think of the early Councils, the Arian heresy, for instance, when Athanasius even became physically aggressive”, Burke also mentioned that John Paul II had ruled out women&#x27;s ordination “once and for all”.

Burke, along with three other cardinals, issued a set of &quot;dubia&quot;, or doubts, to Francis, asking him to clarify various points of doctrine in his 2016 apostolic exhortation, &quot;Amoris laetitia&quot; and on general Christian life. The other cardinals were Italian Carlo Caffarra and Germans Brandmüller and Joachim Meisner. Since the 2014 synod, some bishops had begun allowing Catholics who had been divorced and remarried to receive the eucharist, despite the fact that such persons are traditionally said to be committing adultery and living in mortal sin and therefore ineligible to participate according to official church law. A footnote in &quot;Amoris laetitia&quot; was seen as allowing that under some circumstances. Burke said that if divorced and remarried Catholics were permitted to receive the eucharist, &quot;then the Church&#x27;s teaching on marriage is finished.&quot;

The four cardinals submitted the &quot;dubia&quot; in private, followed by a public letter (&quot;Seeking Clarity: A Plea to Untie the Knots in &quot;Amoris Laetitia&quot;&quot;) in November 2016, asking Francis to clarify various points of doctrine. The first &quot;dubia&quot; asked about the reception of the sacraments by the divorced and remarried. The public letter asked about fundamental issues of the Christian life and referenced John Paul II&#x27;s encyclical &quot;Veritatis splendor&quot;. In April 2017, following no reply to their letter, the cardinals requested a meeting with Francis, but received no response.

On April 7, 2018, Burke, along with Brandmüller and Schneider, participated in a conference rejecting the outline proposed by German bishops to allow divorced and remarried Catholics to receive the eucharist. Citing chapter 19 of the Gospel of Matthew, Burke disputed the notion that anyone, including the pope, had the authority to accept divorced and remarried Catholics as full members of the church. During the conference, Burke expressed the belief that a &quot;public correction&quot; of a pope in error can take place after a private one has been ignored or rejected. &quot;As a matter of duty, the pope can be disobeyed,&quot; Burke said. He added that &quot;the Roman pontiff can dispense with the law only for the purpose of preserving its purpose, and never for subverting it.&quot;

In an interview with &quot;Crux Now&quot; on September 6, Burke said that he shared fellow &quot;dubia&quot; signatory Caffarra&#x27;s &quot;profound sadness&quot; that the &quot;dubia&quot; never received a response, and wondered whether such sadness contributed to his death. &quot;The dubia must have a response sooner or later,&quot; Burke said. &quot;It&#x27;s a simple response: Yes or no. That&#x27;s all. It&#x27;s not complicated.&quot;

===Palliative care and euthanasia===
At a July 23, 2011, Burke spoke at a conference in Kansas City, Kansas, on end-of-life care, sponsored by the St. Gianna Physician&#x27;s Guild. He said that suffering does not cause a person to have less meaning in his life, nor does it give the government the right to decide if that person should live or die: &quot;No matter how much a life is diminished, no matter what suffering the person is undergoing, that life demands the greatest respect and care. It&#x27;s never right to snuff out a life because it&#x27;s in some way under heavy burden.&quot;

===SSPX reintegration===
In 2012, during negotiations between the traditionalist Society of Saint Pius X (SSPX), which was in a canonically irregular status with the Holy See, Burke expressed optimism that the Society&#x27;s members would reconcile themselves with the Vatican. He referred to the Society&#x27;s members as people who &quot;have the Catholic faith and the love of the sacred liturgy.&quot;

The talks with SSPX eventually failed. In July 2017, Burke said that SSPX was &quot;in schism&quot; and that it was &quot;not legitimate to attend Mass or to receive the sacraments in a church&quot; of theirs, and that faithful Catholics should avoid SSPX liturgies. He criticized Francis&#x27;s openness towards SSPX, stating that &quot;There is no canonical explanation for it, and it is simply an anomaly&quot;, because while they were not excommunicated, they also were not in full communion with the Catholic Church.

===Traditional mass===

In &quot;Summorum Pontificum&quot;, a July 2007 apostolic letter, Pope Benedict XVI authorized wider use of the Traditional Mass in Catholic churches. This mass had been largely superseded after the reforms in the 1960s of the Second Vatican Council and the introduction of the mass of Paul VI &quot;(Novus Ordo).&quot; Burke supported the restoration of all or some parts of the traditional mass. He termed it as part of a &quot;reform of the reform&quot;, modifying what he sees as deficiencies in the implementation of the newer Mass of Paul VI. In 2012, Burke said the following regarding the liturgical changes that took place after the Second Vatican Council:
In a 2017 interview with the &quot;Catholic Herald&quot;, Burke referred to &quot;Summorum Pontificum&quot; as &quot;the most splendid contribution of the pontificate of Pope Benedict XVI&quot;. Over the years, Burke has frequently offered the traditional form of the Mass, including regularly performing ordinations for the ICKSP and the Priestly Fraternity of Saint Peter, both traditionalist groups whose priests offer only the older form of the Mass.

In March 2011, Burke said that too many priests and bishops treat violations of liturgical norms as something that is unimportant, when they are actually &quot;serious abuses&quot; that damage the faith of Catholics. He criticized a perceived lack of reverence in the way the modern liturgy is sometimes conducted, stating &quot;If we err by thinking we are the center of the liturgy, the Mass will lead to a loss of faith.&quot; At the same time, Burke is known to wear lavish regalia and &quot;is one of the few cardinals who dons cappa magnas, the long trains of watered silk that can look like scarlet lava flowing down from his throne&quot; as well as &quot;velvet gloves and extravagant brocades.

In a 2015 interview, Burke reiterated his concern that man has become center of mass, saying that &quot;In many places the Mass became very priest‑centered, it was like the &#x27;priest show.&#x27; This type of abuse leads to a loss of the sense of the sacred, taking the essential mystery out of the Mass. The reality of Christ Himself coming down on the altar to make present His sacrifice on Calvary gets lost.&quot; Burke blamed modernization of the liturgy after the Second Vatican Council for declining Mass attendance. &quot;In some cases it actually became hard for people to bear because of illicit insertions, foreign agendas, and imposition of the personalities of priests and congregations into the liturgy to the point that people began to think that the Mass was some sort of social activity...If one understands what the Mass truly is — Christ Himself coming down from Heaven to renew the sacrifice of Calvary — how could you possibly not be there on Sunday?&quot; he asked.Burke condemned &quot;Traditionis custodes&quot;, a July 2021 &quot;motu proprio&quot; issued by Francis which effectively reversed &quot;Summorum Pontificum&quot; by placing limits on priests offering the Traditional Form of the Mass. Burke said that he could not understand the document&#x27;s assertion that the Novus Ordo form represented the &quot;unique expression&quot; of the Roman Rite of the Mass, because the Traditional Form &quot;is a living form of the Roman Rite and has never ceased to be so&quot;. While Francis described the traditional mass as something that had become a tool to promote schism in Christianity, Burke said that he had not seen such tendencies in practice. He alleged that Francis&#x27; document was &quot;marked by harshness&quot; towards those who attend mass in the older form and criticized the fact that it took effect immediately, which in his view did not give adequate time for those affected to study its meaning. Burke stated that Francis did not have the authority to eliminate the traditional mass.

===Antinomianism===
The 2012 Synod of Bishops meeting focused on &quot;The New Evangelization&quot;. In written comments to the synod, Burke criticized &quot;antinomianism&quot;, the belief that grace exempts Christians from obedience to moral law, stating that it is &quot;among the most serious wounds of society today,&quot; and is responsible for the legalization of &quot;intrinsically evil&quot; actions such as abortion, embryonic stem-cell research, euthanasia, and same-sex marriage.

===Islam and immigration===
In a 2016 interview, Burke said there is &quot;no question that Islam wants to govern the world&quot; and that he feared &quot;being forcibly under an Islamic government&quot;. In his subsequent book, &quot;Hope for the World: To Unite All Things in Christ&quot;, Burke says:
Archbishop Diarmuid Martin of Dublin said that Burke&#x27;s remarks were unhelpful at a time when Europe was still wavering in the aftermath of a series of terror attacks.

Before the 2016 United States presidential election, Burke met with Steve Bannon, a close advisor to Donald Trump. The pair met several more times, and Burke was for years a strong ally of Bannon. In 2013, Burke was named president of the board of advisers to Bannon&#x27;s Dignitatis Humanae Institute, an academy set up by Bannon to train right-wing Catholic activists. In 2019, however, Burke resigned from the board and cut ties with Bannon because of the latter&#x27;s stated intent to make a film adaptation of Frederic Martel&#x27;s work &quot;In the Closet of the Vatican.&quot; Burke said that &quot;I disagree completely with a number of Mr. Bannon&#x27;s statements regarding the doctrine and discipline of the Roman Catholic Church.&quot;

In February 2017, after Trump was elected president, Burke said that he did not &quot;think the new president [would] be inspired by hatred in his treatment of the issue of immigration.&quot; In 2017, Burke met with the right-wing Italian nationalist Matteo Salvini, head of Italy&#x27;s Northern League and an opponent of Francis on immigration and dialogue with Muslims.

In 2018, Burke condemned the family separation policy of the Trump administration, saying, &quot;A solution to the situation has to be found which avoids this practice of separating small children from their parents, that&#x27;s clear.&quot;

In May 2019, Burke said that &quot;to resist large-scale Muslim immigration in my judgment is to be responsible&quot; and &quot;a responsible exercise of one&#x27;s patriotism&quot;; he cited a book called &quot;No Go Zones: How Sharia Law is Coming to a Neighborhood Near You&quot;, by former Breitbart News reporter Raheem Kassam, in support of his contention that immigration of Muslims to Europe and the U.S. was harmful. Burke said that Muslim immigration was because Christians were &quot;no longer ready to defend the moral law&quot; and expressed fears of demographic shift because &quot;Christians are not reproducing themselves.&quot;

===Clergy sex abuse===
In 2018, Burke described ongoing sex abuse scandals in the church as &quot;an apostasy from the faith&quot;. He added that &quot;principally, it starts with the idea that there can be legitimate sexual activity outside of marriage, which of course is false, completely false&quot;. Burke called for prayer and acts of reparation in the midst of the crisis. In 2019, Burke said that &quot;lay faithful who are well-prepared&quot; in dealing with sexual abuse cases &quot;should be called upon to investigate and help get to the bottom of&quot; the church&#x27;s clergy abuse problem, while also stating that any group of people investigating abuse cases must ultimately report and answer to the pope.

In 2019, Burke was reported to have received, together with other influential U.S. Catholic leaders, substantial monetary gifts from West Virginia bishop Michael J. Bransfield, who had resigned following allegations of sexual misconduct. The gifts had been reimbursed by the diocese. Burke said that the gifts that he received were &quot;generous&quot; but &quot;not lavish,&quot; and that he had used them to make charitable donations.

===COVID-19 and vaccine===
In December 2020, Burke criticized global responses related to the COVID-19 pandemic. Referring to it as &quot;the mysterious Wuhan virus&quot;, he said that the virus is being used by &quot;certain forces ... to advance their evil agenda&quot; and to force people to become &quot;subjects of the so-called &#x27;Great Reset,&#x27; the &#x27;new normal,&#x27; which is dictated to us by their manipulation of citizens and nations through ignorance and fear.&quot;

In 2021, Burke raised objections to COVID-19 vaccination. He has denounced vaccine mandates and compared them to &quot;state-mandated microchipping&quot;. Burke stated that the setting of vaccine mandates &quot;violates the integrity of&quot; citizens. In December 2020, referring to COVID-19 vaccine development, Burke said that the use of fetal tissue in vaccine development is &quot;rightly abhorrent,&quot; saying it is &quot;never morally justified to develop a vaccine through the use of the cell lines of aborted fetuses.&quot; The Vatican ruled in December 2020 that &quot;when ethically irreproachable COVID-19 vaccines are not available (e.g. in countries where vaccines without ethical problems are not made available to physicians and patients, or where their distribution is more difficult due to special storage and transport conditions, or when various types of vaccines are distributed in the same country but health authorities do not allow citizens to choose the vaccine with which to be inoculated) &quot;it is morally acceptable to receive COVID-19 vaccines that have used cell lines from aborted fetuses in their research and production process.&quot;&quot; Burke has also criticized social distancing.

In August 2021, Burke announced he had tested positive for COVID-19; he was hospitalized and placed on a ventilator for several days. On August 28, Burke said that he had been transferred out of the intensive care unit and that his health condition was improving. On September 26, Burke announced that he been moved from the hospital and was making slow but steady progress in his rehabilitation from COVID-19 and he hoped to be able to resume normal duties in several weeks.

===Synod on Synodality===
On July 10, 2023, Burke was one of five cardinals who signed a letter to Francis expressing concerns that the upcoming Synod on Synodality would undermine traditional Church teaching, particularly on matters related to sexuality, the role of synodality in the Church, the issue of whether teaching could change with time, and the ordaining of women as priests. The letter posed a series of questions which the Pope was asked to clarify. Francis responded one day later. The cardinals found his response unsatisfactory, and wrote him a second letter, dated August 21, in which they rephrased their questions so that they could be answered simply as &quot;yes&quot; or &quot;no.&quot; Francis did not respond, and in October, the cardinals made their letters public.

==Honors==
During his tenure in St. Louis, Burke was awarded honorary doctorates in humane letters by two US Catholic universities, Ave Maria University in Ave Maria, Florida, in 2005, and Christendom College in Front Royal, Virginia, in 2007.

Archbishop Robert Carlson of St. Louis created the Raymond Leo Cardinal Burke Chair in Canon Law at St. Louis&#x27;s Kenrick-Glennon Seminary. In May 2011, the Franciscan University of Steubenville in Steubenville, Ohio, awarded Burke an honorary doctorate.

In 2012, St. Mary&#x27;s Parish School, which Burke attended as a child, named an addition as he Raymond Cardinal Burke Annex. Aquinas High School in La Crosse (where Burke served on the faculty) named a new addition the Bishop Burke Hall in 1997 and the Cardinal Burke Hall in 2011.

<doc id="777860" wikidata="Q604079" url="?curid=777860" title="Mauve">
<text>Mauve (, ; , ) is a pale purple color named after the mallow flower (French: &quot;mauve&quot;). The first use of the word &quot;mauve&quot; as a color was in 1796–98 according to the &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot;, but its use seems to have been rare before 1859. Another name for the color is mallow, with the first recorded use of &quot;mallow&quot; as a color name in English in 1611.

Mauve contains more gray and more blue than a pale tint of magenta. Many pale wildflowers called &quot;blue&quot; are more accurately classified as mauve. Mauve is also sometimes described as pale violet.

==Mauveine, the first commercial aniline dye==

The synthetic dye mauve was first so named in 1859. Chemist William Henry Perkin, then 18, was attempting to synthesize quinine in 1856; quinine was used to treat malaria. He noticed an unexpected residue, which turned out to be the first aniline dye. Perkin originally named the dye Tyrian purple after the historical dye, but the product was renamed &quot;mauve&quot; after it was marketed in 1859. It is now usually called &quot;Perkin&#x27;s mauve&quot;, &quot;mauveine&quot;, or &quot;aniline purple&quot;.

Earlier references to a mauve dye in 1856–1858 referred to a color produced using the semi-synthetic dye murexide or a mixture of natural dyes. Perkin was so successful in marketing his discovery to the dye industry that his 2000 biography by Simon Garfield is simply entitled &quot;Mauve&quot;. Between 1859 and 1861, mauve became a fashion must-have. The weekly journal &quot;All the Year Round&quot; described women wearing the colour as &quot;all flying countryward, like so many migrating birds of purple paradise&quot;. &quot;Punch&quot; magazine published cartoons poking fun at the huge popularity of the colour: &quot;The Mauve Measles are spreading to so serious an extent that it is high time to consider by what means [they] may be checked.&quot;

But, because it faded easily, the success of mauve dye was short-lived; by 1873, it was replaced by other synthetic dyes. As the memory of the original dye soon receded, the contemporary understanding of mauve is as a lighter, less-saturated color than it was originally known.

The 1890s are sometimes referred to in retrospect as the &quot;Mauve Decade&quot; because of the popularity of the subtle color among progressive artistic types, both in Europe and the US.

<doc id="777974" wikidata="Q2997236" url="?curid=777974" title="Culture of Tajikistan">
<text>The culture of [[Tajikistan]] has developed over several thousand years. Tajik culture can be divided into two areas, Metropolitan and &quot;Kuhiston&quot; (Highland). Modern city centres include Dushanbe (the capital), Khudjand, Kulob, and Panjikent.
==Religion==

Zoroastrianism had been adopted by Persian emperors as a state religion, and was practiced in Central Asia as well. It eventually declined after the Arab conquests. The largest celebration in Tajikistan to come from the pre-Islamic period is Navruz, which means &quot;New Day&quot;. It is held on March 21 or 22, when the cultivation of the land starts. During Navruz, many families visit relatives, throw out old belongings, clean the house, and play field games. Special dishes are also served. Other pre-Islamic Tajik traditions like fire jumping, dancing around the fire, and fighting &#x27;devils&#x27; with fire, still occur in the more remote regions.

Tajikistan&#x27;s government has shown intolerance of some religious faiths, such as Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses, and has demolished religious buildings.

==Cuisine==
Tajik cuisine has much in common with Uzbek, Afghan, Russian, and Iranian. It is known for dishes such as &quot;kabuli pulao&quot;, &quot;qabili palau&quot;, and &quot;samanu&quot;. The national food and drink are plov and green tea, respectively.

Traditional Tajikistani meals begin with small dishes of dried fruit, nuts, and halva, followed by soup and meat, and finished with plov. Tea accompanies every meal, and is often served between meals as a gesture of hospitality. It is often drunk unsweetened. Tajik cuisine offers a large variety of fruit, meat, and soup dishes.

==Sport==

Tajikistan&#x27;s mountains provide many opportunities for outdoor sports, such as hill climbing, mountain biking, rock climbing, skiing, snowboarding, hiking, and mountain climbing. The facilities are limited, however. Mountain climbing and hiking tours to the Fann and Pamir Mountains, including the 7,000 m peaks in the region, are seasonally organized by local and international alpine agencies.

Football is the most popular sport in Tajikistan. The Tajikistan national football team competes in FIFA and AFC competitions. The top clubs in Tajikistan compete in the Tajik League.

Four Tajikistani athletes have won Olympic medals for their country since independence. They are: wrestler Yusup Abdusalomov (silver in Belijing 2008), judoka Rasul Boqiev (bronze in Beijing 2008), boxer Mavzuna Chorieva (bronze in London 2012) and Dilshod Nazarov (gold in hammer throw in Rio 2016) .

==Cinema==

Tajikistan&#x27;s film industry dates from 1929. The first official movie studio, called &quot;Tajikkino&quot; (later renamed to &quot;Tajikfilm&quot;), began operation in 1930. In 1935, &quot;Tajikkino&quot; started producing movies with voice-over. Some experts believe 1970–80 to be the golden age for Tajikfilm. Subsidized by the government, the studio was able to produce about six feature films each year.

Examples of Tajikfilm&#x27;s success during the Soviet times are such movies as &quot;The Legend of Rustam&quot;, &quot;The Legend of Rustam and Siavoush&quot;, and &quot;The Legend of the Smith Kova&quot;, based on stories from Ferdowsi&#x27;s &quot;Shahnameh&quot;; &quot;First Morning of Adolescence&quot; (&quot;Юнности Первое Утро&quot;), which tells the life story of people living in Badakhshan in the beginning of the Soviet Empire, when its army was still struggling with the Basmachi movement; a trilogy &quot;New tales from Shaherizada&quot;, based on Arabic tales &quot;One Thousand and One Nights&quot;.

Among prominent Tajik producers are Valeriy Ahadov and Davlat Khudoynazarov.

After the breakdown of Soviet Union and the civil war in Tajikistan (1992–1997), Tajik cinema went downwards. The studio mainly survived by taking small foreign orders, and produced only a few of its own movies.
Mohsen Makhmalbaf&#x27;s film &quot;Sex &amp; Philosophy&quot; from 2005 was set and produced in Tajikistan, as was the film &quot;Angel on the Right&quot; by Jamshed Usmonov from 2002. Other Tajik movies produced in the past two decades include: &quot;Kosh ba Kosh&quot; (1993), &quot;Business trip&quot; (1998, documentary), and &quot;Luna Papa&quot; (1999, a joint project of Tajikfilm with some counterparts from Germany, Austria, Switzerland, Japan, and Russia).

==Art==
Chakan embroidery is the practice of sewing symbolic images on cotton or silk with brightly colored thread. These depict mythological images, nature, or the cosmos. The embroidery is done on clothing and on common household items such as curtains, bedspreads, and pillows. Chakan items are an important part of marriage ceremonies, with a bride wearing a Chakan shirt and the groom wearing an embroidered skullcap called a &quot;tāqi&quot;. Tajik women and girls will commonly wear Chakan clothing during national festivals and holidays.

Women create this art form, either individually or in communal settings. When working individually the craftswomen will get help from their daughters and other family members. In a communal setting the craftswomen gather in one home, taking direction from the most experienced one and being assigned an individual task for the process. These tasks can include image design, fabric cutting, embroidering, sewing garments, and taking orders for the sale of the products. The products created by these craftswomen are sold in bazaars or dress shops, providing an important source of income.

The practice of Chakan embroidery is passed down from one generation of women to the next, to ensure the practice continues to thrive. A craftswoman will pass down her knowledge to her daughter, granddaughter, and daughter-in-law. Chakan embroidery can also be learned in group settings from an expert craftswoman, referred to as the &quot;ustod-shogird&quot; or &quot;master-student&quot; method.

In 2018, Chakan embroidery was inscribed on UNESCO&#x27;s Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity.

==Music==

Traditional Tajik music is closely related to other Central Asian music forms. Shashmaqam is the predominant style of Tajik folk music, though falak is popular in southern Tajikistan. The Pamiris of the Gorno-Badakhshan Autonomous Province have their own distinct style of music as well.

==Literature==

Traditional centers of Tajik literature were Samarkand and Bukhara, however these cities are now in Uzbekistan. In recent history, Tajik literature has been predominantly social realist. Though Tajiks do not draw a line, between their own literature and general Persian literature, there have been a few notable Tajik writers and poets. The standardization of the Tajik language has shaped Tajik literature in recent decades as well.

==Cultural revival==
One thousand years after the Samanid period, another cultural revival occurred; this time due to the Soviet&#x27;s modern drama, opera, and ballet. Poets such as Mirzo Tursunzoda, Mirsaid Mirshakar, and Loik Sherali; novelist and historian Sadridin Aini, all figured prominently in this revival, as did professors M Ishoki and Osimi, scholar Sotim Ulughzoda, novelist Jalol Ikromi, and anthropologist and historian Bobojon Ghafurov. In 1969, Malika Sobirova won a gold medal in an international ballet competition.

Since independence, there has been a pre-Soviet cultural revival in an attempt to foster a sense of national identity. Novelist Taimur Zulfikarov, and professors Rahim Masov and Bozor Sobir being prominent.

<text>The is a Ryukyuan musical instrument and precursor of the mainland Japanese (). Often likened to a banjo, it consists of a snakeskin-covered body, neck and three strings.

==Origins==
Its close resemblance in both appearance and name to the Chinese suggests Chinese origins, the then-Ryūkyū Kingdom (pre-Japanese Okinawa) having very close ties with Imperial China. In the 16th century, the reached the Japanese trading port at Sakai in Osaka, Japan. In mainland Japan, it evolved into the larger , and many people refer to the as or due to its snakeskin covering.

The is considered the soul of Okinawan folk music. Played by youth as young as 2, to older people aged 100 or more, there is a in most Okinawan homes. It is the center of small informal family gatherings, weddings, birthdays, other celebrations, community parties, festivals.

The is held in great respect among the Ryukyuan culture, and is often viewed as an instrument that carries the voice of the deities, and is regarded as a deity itself. This is reflected in the traditional construction of the . are generally designed to last more than a lifetime, as they are often passed down through the generations of a family.

A traditional Okinawan story, the tale of the &#x27;Husband and Wife &#x27;, tells of a pair of made from the same core of Okinawan Ebony tree. They were owned by a husband and wife prior to World War II. At the onset of the war, the husband was forced into military service by the Japanese, and therefore had to leave his wife and home. Due to the destruction to main island during the war, the pair of were in danger, and the war wiped out almost half of the native population.

In an attempt to preserve his and his wife&#x27;s , the husband wrapped them up, put them into a wooden box, and buried them deep in the Okinawan forest. Later, they were dug up, and brought back to their rightful home, having made it safely through the violent war. They are currently preserved by the son of the couple.

==Construction==
Traditionally, the was covered with the skin of the Burmese python, but today, due to CITES regulations, the skin of the reticulated python is also used. Python skin is used for the skin of the body of the instrument, in contrast to the cat or dogskin used traditionally on the . Though Okinawa is famous for the venomous habu viper, the habu is in fact too small for its skin to be used to make , and it is believed that the snakeskin for the has always been imported from Southeast Asia.

Though the pythons used to make skins today are not an endangered species, the difficulty of distinguishing faux snakeskin from real snakeskin makes transporting real-snakeskin () internationally somewhat risky. Due to international wildlife protection treaties, it is not legal to export snakeskin-covered to some countries, such as the United Kingdom and the United States. There is some room for interpretation of this, in that the treaties specify that the restriction is for endangered snake species.

Naturally-skinned instruments - while considered unparalleled in sound quality, producing a warm, deep yet pronounced tone - are infamous for cracking and tearing, especially when the is taken out of its natural habitat, the humid tropicality of the Ryukyu Islands. 
Up until recent times, skin breakage was never considered much of a problem, as the &#x27;s construction allows for it to be fully disassembled, re-skinned, and reassembled, usually with little time, cost, and inconvenience, as a number of craftsmen were heavily dotted throughout the Prefecture.
When began to be exported across the world, skin breakages became a more prevalent issue, as no craftsmen existed outside of Okinawa, with Western luthiers unfamiliar with the construction of the instrument, or its use of natural skins. exported to cold and/or dry countries have an increased vulnerability to skin cracks, tears and breaks, leading to the development of artificial skins made from a variety of materials, such as nylon and polyester. The quality, appearance, and price of these skins varies greatly, ranging from hard, thin-skinned, high-pitched and &#x27;tinny&#x27;-sounding polyester skins, to the more &#x27;snake-skin-sounding&#x27; nylon skins, which replicate the layered composition of natural snake skin. Artificially skinned are popular due to their generally low cost and their invulnerability to different temperatures and atmospheres. The highest-quality synthetic-skin , which are available for as low as US$300, are the go-to choice for professional Okinawan Folk Musicians who travel and play overseas.

These days, with the &#x27;s popularity rapidly expanding all over the world, and the desire of players to have the most traditional possible, a hybrid skin known as the style has been developed: a natural python skin is fitted to the and stretched with a strong, synthetic reinforcement fabric underneath. 
This proves a great compromise for those in dryer/colder/hotter climates. Like with its un-reinforced predecessor, it is still good practice to maintain regular oiling of the reinforced skin to prevent over-drying and cracking. There are also tailor-made products available to avoid skin-breakage, such as naturally oily leather circular pads that are placed on either side of the body during case storage. This prevents over-drying which leads to breaking.

The wooden parts of the - the neck (), head/body (), and head ( - can be made with any of a large variety of hardwoods. Traditionally, the neck is crafted with the solid black core of the Okinawan Ebony tree, a species native to Okinawa, and the only ebony in the whole of Japan. This black ebony core is highly sought-after for its strength and its traditional sound quality. Typically, Ebony trees no younger than 100 years old are used in construction - the time necessary for the tree to grow a big enough black core to produce one or more instrument necks.

Instruments made with Okinawan Ebony are among the most expensive made and sold today. Even Ebony instruments that forego authentic snakeskin for the cheaper and more durable nylon and polyester skins can be several times more expensive than an instrument made with other hardwoods.

The other, more common hardwoods (used mainly for convenience, availability, and cost-effectiveness) include Oak, Apitong, and Rosewoods (any number of species).

There are 3 strings, called Gen. They can be made of Nylon or Silk. They are first attached to the base of the Dou (head), at the point where the end of the neck pole sticks out. A silk thread-piece, known as an Itokake or Genkake is fitted onto the wood piece, then the strings are individually attached to the 3 loops of the Itokake, using a simple draw-thru knot. The other end of the string are brought up the body and neck, and are the individually wound onto their respective pegs, called Karakui. Itokake, once only available in Gold color, are now being made in a variety of colors, to match a variety of Doumaki.
Karakui, the tuning pegs, are generally made with whatever wood the neck is made from, but Ebony is most common, and desired for its strength. Acting much like the tuning pegs of the violin, cello, and other traditional western wood string instruments- Karakui will require the use of Rosin (made of Pine resin, oils, ash, etc.), after an initial period. The Rosin is applied as a thin and tacky layer, adding grip between the two wood pieces. Karakui are infamous for breaking with the slightest impetus, and are therefore readily available individually or in sets of 3. Karakui also act as another face of expression for the Sanshin- they can be carved in a variety of different styles and designs, and finished in a range of colors, textures, and some can even be &#x27;tipped&#x27; with Jade, Coral, or other stones, shells, and natural decorations.
Another part of Sanshin&#x27;s body is susceptible to damage- and that is the head, or &#x27;Ten&#x27;. It can be scratched, dented, or even completely broken off, if mishandled. A textile, simply called a Ten cover, is a small, elastic-reinforced slip-cover that is generally padded and quilted, to provide a bit of protection against surface damage. These Ten covers can be used at all times, or can be removed during play. Use during play will not effect sound quality. Ten covers come in as big of a variety as Doumaki, many made to match.

The finishing touch, and arguably &#x27;the Soul&#x27; of every Sanshin, is the Doumaki- the decorative textile that surrounds the head of the Sanshin. Dou, meaning &#x27;drum&#x27; and Maki, meaning &#x27;Wrap&#x27;. Most often, Doumaki are made from modern fibers and methods, and display the Royal Crest of the Ryukyu Kingdom (Hidari Gomon), in rich black and gold. These days, a wide variety of both modern-made and traditional hand-woven Doumaki can be found both in Japan and by world citizens via the internet. They can range from US$10 (for traditional design and cheaper materials), all the way to US$175, for the magnificent hand-woven Doumaki, made with hand-spun silk or the famous Basho-fu, &#x27;silk&#x27; made from the trunks of Okinawan Banana trees. These high-end Doumaki may also incorporate leather, python skin, Bingata fabric (Okinawan &#x27;stencil &amp; paste&#x27; dyeing), Minsaa weavings (traditional Ryukyu &#x27;4 &amp; 5&#x27; Square patterns_ and other natural/modern materials.

In addition to synthetic skins, another modern cost-cutting adaptation is the &#x27;New Wood&#x27; Sanshin- an instrument that abandons any type of &#x27;skinning&#x27; of the body, and instead utilizes a thin panel of wood composite. This wood face is then finished and decorated in any number of fashions. 
This &#x27;New Wood&#x27; design has pioneered the seemingly popular &#x27;Sanshin Kit&#x27;. 
This &#x27;DIY&#x27; kit generally includes pre-fabricated parts- the Sao/Neck, the Dou/drum head base, and the Karakui/tuning pegs- all of which come &#x27;unfinished&#x27;, awaiting the new owner&#x27;s creative hands. Wood parts can be further sanded, stained/painted, oiled, lacquered, etc... whatever the heart desires. Kits come with a traditional Doumaki, but the die-hard artisan may choose to create their own unique, personally-designed textile.
It seems that in recent times, with the US Dollar and the Japanese Yen not exactly being of equal value, the cost of shipping to countries outside of Asia, is higher than the cost of the Kits themselves.

A unique &#x27;evolutionary-tangent&#x27; of the Sanshin came about just after the Battle of Okinawa- the deadliest action in the Pacific War. Civilians were corralled into US camps following the Battle, during the US take-over. The Okinawans, allowed to bring nothing with them, insisted upon carrying on musical and dancing arts so important to their culture. With the assistance of their US captors, and their rations, a new type of Sanshin was made- using a tin can, and most likely a broom pole. This changed everything for the downtrodden prisoners, bring a bit of peace and joy to their otherwise bleek situation. This war-born Sanshin is now called Kankara Sanshin, or &#x27;Can-Sanshin, Can-shin, etc.&#x27;. It is also the subject of the &#x27;DIY-Kit&#x27; approach to Sanshin

==Tuning==

Traditionally, players wear a plectrum (bachi), made of a material such as the water buffalo horn, on the index finger. Today, some use a guitar pick or the nail of the index finger. In Amami, long, narrow bamboo plectra are also used, which allow a higher-pitched tone than that of the Okinawa sanshin.

A bamboo bridge raises the strings off the skin, which are white, except in Amami, where they are yellower and thinner. The traditional names for the strings are (from thick to thin) &quot;uujiru&quot; (男絃, &quot;male string&quot;), &quot;nakajiru&quot; (中絃, &quot;middle string&quot;), and &quot;miijiru&quot; (女絃, &quot;female string&quot;). The sanshin has five tunings called : 
* – &quot;standard tuning&quot; (i.e. C3, F3, C4 expressed in terms of international pitch notation)
* – &quot;first-string raised tuning&quot; (i.e. E3, F3, C4)
* – &quot;second-string raised tuning&quot; (i.e. C3, G3, C4)
* – &quot;first- and second-strings raised tuning&quot; (i.e. D3, G3, C4)
* – &quot;third-string lowered tuning&quot; (i.e. C3, F3, B3)

==Musical notation==

Sheet music for the sanshin is written in a unique transcription system called &quot;kunkunshi&quot; ( ). It is named for the first three notes of Chinese melody that was widely known during its development. Its creator is believed to be Mongaku Terukina or his student in the early to mid-1700s. A set of kanji are used to represent specific finger positions. Unlike European musical notation, kunkunshi can only be interpreted specifically through the sanshin.

<doc id="778014" wikidata="Q2124988" url="?curid=778014" title="Beauty Point, Tasmania">
<text>Beauty Point is a town by the Tamar River, in the north-east of Tasmania, Australia. It lies 45 km north of Launceston, on the West Tamar Highway and at the 2016 census, had a population of 1,222. It is part of the Municipality of West Tamar Council.
==History==
Beauty Point is a tiny township originally established as the first deep water port on the Tamar River. The town was first established as a port to service the nearby gold mine town of Beaconsfield. After the gold rush ended, it became a centre for the export of apples.

During the 1870s, the north-western part of modern-day Beauty Point, near the base of Redbill Point, was known as &#x27;Port Lempriere&#x27; and was the site of the blast furnace of the British and Tasmanian Charcoal Iron Company and its two wharves - a 310-foot-long wharf near the blast furnace site and a separate 600 foot-long wharf at the end of Redbill Point. A railway connected the wharves and blast furnace site to the company&#x27;s iron ore mine - &#x27;Mt Vulcan&#x27; - on Anderson&#x27;s Creek.

The southern part of modern-day Beauty Point—known previously as Ilfracombe—was the site of the jetty of the Ilfracombe Iron Company (Longden&#x27;s Jetty) and the terminus of its tramway, during the 1870s. Ilfracombe was only ever a port for this venture, and both the company&#x27;s iron ore mine and blast furnace were located well inland.

The Ilfracombe Post Office opened on 1 October 1903, was renamed &quot;Beauty Point&quot; in 1904 and ultimately closed in 1991. Ilfraville Post Office nearby opened on 1 December 1941 and was renamed &quot;Beauty Point&quot; in 1991 when the earlier office of the same name closed.

==Economy==
Situated on Port Dalrymple (the mouth of the Tamar River) opposite from George Town, Beauty Point lies in the heart of a rich sheep, cattle and vine-growing district. Even so, the town&#x27;s port facilities form the heart of the present-day economic life.

Beauty Point is also a major fishing town. The Australian Maritime College has a campus here, for courses in fisheries and seamanship. More recently, the town has become the home of Seahorse World, a working seahorse farm and educational centre open to the public. A second tourist attraction, Platypus House, allows visitors to get up close with Tasmanian platypus and echidna. The Beauty Point Slipway provides boat repairs of outstanding quality.

The original Beauty Point wharf, where the first deep water vessels arrived, has been demolished and replaced by the Australian Maritime College, which houses over 100 residential students. The college owns two training vessels.

The town&#x27;s first wharf was established in response to the growing importance of Beaconsfield which, as a result of the gold boom, was once the third largest town in Tasmania.

==Yachting==
Beauty Point forms the starting point of the Australian Three Peaks Race, a yachting and running event around the east of the state. It is also the starting point for the Launceston to Hobart Yacht Race, an event also down the east coast.

<doc id="778053" wikidata="Q2335428" url="?curid=778053" title="Bicheno, Tasmania">
<text>Bicheno is a locality and town on the east coast of Tasmania, Australia, 185 km north-east of Hobart on the Tasman Highway, with a population of around 950. It is part of the municipality of Glamorgan-Spring Bay. The town is primarily a fishing port and a beach resort.

== History ==
The town was named in honour of James Ebenezer Bicheno, the British Colonial Secretary for Van Diemen&#x27;s Land from 1843 to 1851, with the name in use in 1851.

The first historical reference to the place that was to become Bicheno was made by James Kelly during his circumnavigation of Van Diemen&#x27;s Land. He landed here (when it was known as Waubs Harbour) to dry his provisions.

Waub&#x27;s Harbour was the location for a number of shore-based bay whaling stations in the late 1830s and early 1840s.

Bicheno was proclaimed a township in 1866. Bicheno Post Office opened as a receiving house on 1 January 1855.

== Features ==
In Lions Park near the tennis courts is the grave of Wauba Debar (after whom Waub&#x27;s Harbour was named), an Aboriginal woman who was stolen from her tribe as a teenager to become a &quot;sealer&#x27;s woman&quot;. Her bravery in rescuing two sealers in a storm is commemorated by a headstone.

The hinterland was established for farming in the mid-1840s, which continues today. Coal was discovered in 1848. In 1854, the harbour was expanded to provide port facilities for the coal mines at Denison River. The coal was transported to the port via a 5‑km horse-drawn tramway. Coal can still be seen in this area today.

The use of Bicheno as a coal port was short-lived. The discovery of gold in Victoria saw most of the residents depart in 1855 and for nearly a century, Bicheno became a sleepy little fishing village. Fishing has continued to be the lifeblood of the town with substantial quantities of crayfish, abalone, scallops and trevally. Many tourists enjoy fish and chips at the waterfront near the boat ramp. In recent times it has become a popular tourist destination, with a range of accommodation, a few craft shops, and cafes. Visitors are also attracted to the little penguin colony on adjacent Diamond Island. Visitors to the penguins are reminded to respect these wild animals. There is the option to do a guided penguin tour to a protected rookery. The area is a popular picnic spot and the home of Pop Up Picnic Bicheno. There are many vineyards surrounding Bicheno. Wines from all local vineyards can be tasted at The Farm Shed, a new staple in the town. A nearby point of interest is the Bicheno Blowhole. A famous resident is the world champion swimmer Shane Gould. Famous artists include painter Vanessa Richardson, surf photographer Mathew Tildesley and contemporary jeweller Carl Noonan. A cold water swim group meet each morning at Waubs Bay, regardless of weather or season.

In September 2003, a memorial to the merchant navy was unveiled in Bicheno. Five months later, in February 2004, the town presented a freedom of entry charter to the Australian Merchant Navy, the first time any locality in the world has granted &quot;freedom of the city&quot; to the merchant navy. Local primary school children have been appointed custodians of the memorial, built near Wauba Debar&#x27;s grave.

At the 2019 Australian federal election the Bicheno booth recorded the following number of votes for each party:
Labor 194 (33.98%), Nationals 118 (20.67%), Greens 108 (18.91%), Liberal 96 (16.81%), United Australia Party 30 (5.25%) and Pauline Hanson&#x27;s One Nation 25 (4.38%). After the distribution of preferences the two-party preferred vote was Labor 333 (58.32%) to Liberal 238 (41.68%).

<text>, also known historically as Japanese Town, is a neighborhood in the Western Addition district of San Francisco, California. Japantown comprises about six city blocks and is considered one of the largest and oldest ethnic enclaves in the United States.

==Location==

The main thoroughfare is Post Street, between Fillmore Street (to the west) and Laguna Street (to the east). The Japantown neighborhood is generally considered to be bordered on the north by Bush or Pine Street, and on the south by Geary Boulevard.

Its focal point is the Japan Center, which opened in 1968, and is the site of three Japanese-oriented shopping centers. The San Francisco Peace Pagoda, also at the Japan Center, is a five-tiered concrete stupa designed by Japanese architect Yoshiro Taniguchi and presented to San Francisco by the people of Osaka, Japan.

==History==
Up until 1906, San Francisco had been the main U.S. port of entry for Asian immigration and had the largest ethnic Japanese concentration of any city in the United States. Prior to the 1906 San Francisco earthquake, San Francisco had two Japantowns, one on the outskirts of Chinatown, the other in the South of Market area. After 1906, Japanese immigrants began moving to San Francisco&#x27;s Western Addition, which then became San Francisco&#x27;s main Japantown, with a smaller one in the South Park area. The South Park area was located between the docks used by Japanese shipping companies and the Southern Pacific Railroad Station, and primarily served travelers between Japan and the United States. The South Park district businesses suffered following the passage of the Immigration Act of 1924.

By 1940, the Western Addition Japantown area (referred to as Nihonjin-machi) was one of the largest such enclaves of Japanese outside Japan, as it took an appearance similar to the Ginza district in Tokyo. The ethnic Japanese population numbered over 5,000, and there were more than 200 Japanese-owned businesses.
In February 1942, U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt signed Executive Order 9066, which forced all Japanese of birth or descent, including Japanese-American citizens of the United States, to be relocated from the Pacific coast and interned. By 1943 many large sections of the neighborhood remained vacant due to the forced internment. The void was quickly filled by thousands of African Americans who had left the South to find wartime industrial jobs in California as part of the Great Migration.

Following the war, some Japanese Americans returned, followed by new Japanese immigrants as well as investment from the Japanese Government and Japanese companies. However, many former residents did not return to the neighborhood after World War II and instead settled in other parts of the city, or out to the suburbs altogether. Depopulation of Japantown by ethnic Japanese was further instigated by the city&#x27;s redevelopment plans initiated by M. Justin Herman in the Western Addition in the 1960s through the 1980s. With little community input, existing housing was razed and transportation corridors were widened.

In 1957, San Francisco entered into a sister city relationship with the city of Osaka, hence the nickname &quot;Little Osaka&quot;. Osaka was San Francisco&#x27;s oldest sister city. In commemoration of their 50th anniversary, one block of Buchanan Street in Japantown was renamed Osaka Way on September 8, 2007. However, Osaka ended the 60-year relationship in 2018 after then mayor Ed Lee accepted a statue memorializing comfort women in 2017. The statue is currently erected on public property in San Francisco&#x27;s Chinatown.

Japantown Bowl was founded in 1976 amidst urban renewal in the Fillmore District, San Francisco in the 1970s. When the building was put up for sale, Supervisor Mabel Teng suggested that the city buy the building if negotiations between private investors failed. The Japanese Cultural and Community Center of Northern California (JCCCNC) offered to buy the building but was rejected. It was the largest of the three remaining bowling alleys in San Francisco when it closed in September 2000. The lot has since been converted into mixed-use housing units.

A pair of cherry blossom trees were planted by the JCCCNC outside of the center in 1994 to commemorate a visit by Emperor Emeritus Akihito and Empress Emerita Michiko of Japan during their 2-week tour of the United States. However, the trees were hacked down over the course of three days by vandals in January 2021.

In 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States, malls in San Francisco were ordered to remain temporarily closed whenever cases got high within the whole city followed by Los Angeles and San Diego. This, in effect, has forced restaurants in the neighborhood, many of whom reside in Japan Center, to turn to a take-out/delivery-only model. The JCCCNC have organized socially distanced outdoor seating and ordering areas in the Peace Plaza. However, some businesses have still remained closed for the duration of the pandemic and have reported losses of 50%. 

==Attractions and characteristics==
The area is home to Japanese cuisine restaurants, supermarkets, indoor shopping malls, hotels, banks, and other shops, including one of the few U.S. branches of the large Kinokuniya bookstore chain. Most of these businesses are located in the commercial Japan Center of the neighborhood, in a large shopping mall built in the 1960s as part of urban renewal efforts and is run by Japanese retailer Kintetsu. There is also a number of Korean restaurants here, and also a grocery store, spa, beauty shop, and a household goods store on nearby Fillmore Street.

===Festivals===
San Francisco&#x27;s Japantown celebrates two major festivals every year: The Northern California Cherry Blossom Festival (held for two weekends every April), and the Nihonmachi Street Fair, held one weekend in the month of August.

The Cherry Blossom Festival takes place over the course of two weekends. During the first weekend, the Northern California Cherry Blossom Queen Program takes place at the Kabuki Theatre, where women of Japanese/Japanese-American descent are chosen to represent, learn about, and serve their community. During the Sunday parade, the queen and princesses are presented on a float.

==Government and infrastructure==
The San Francisco Police Department Northern Station serves Japantown.

===Education===
The area is within the San Francisco Unified School District. Rosa Parks Elementary School is located near Japantown. It houses the Japanese Bilingual Bicultural Program (JBBP). In the winter of 2005 Rosa Parks had 245 students, which filled less than half of the school. That winter, SFUSD proposed closing the school and merging it with another elementary school. Parents protested in favor of keeping the school open. SFUSD moved the Japanese Bilingual Bicultural Program into Rosa Parks. As of November 2006, almost half of the students in the regular Rosa Parks program are African-American and one-third of the students in the JBBP program are Japanese.

== Notable buildings ==
Between 1960 until 1980, the San Francisco Redevelopment Agency purchased many Victorian properties, and relocated them within the Western Addition neighborhood (and specifically in Japantown) due to re-zoning. Most of these houses were constructed with local Redwood lumber.

<text>Margaret Fell or Margaret Fox ( Askew, formerly Fell; 1614 – 23 April 1702) was a founder of the Religious Society of Friends. Known popularly as the &quot;mother of Quakerism,&quot; she is considered one of the Valiant Sixty early Quaker preachers and missionaries. Her daughters Isabel (Fell) Yeamans and Sarah Fell were also leading Quakers.

==Life==
She was born Margaret Askew at the family seat of Marsh Grange in the parish of Kirkby Ireleth, Lancashire (now in Cumbria). She married Thomas Fell, a barrister, in 1632, and became the lady of Swarthmoor Hall. In 1641, Thomas became a Justice of the Peace for Lancashire, and in 1645 a member of the Long Parliament. He ceased to be a member from 1647 to 1649, disapproving of Oliver Cromwell&#x27;s assumption of authority. Margaret and Thomas had seven daughters and one son; only Thomas and their son were not convinced to the Quaker faith perspective.
In late June 1652, George Fox visited Swarthmoor Hall. Margaret Fell met him, and later wrote that he &quot;opened us a book that we had never read in, nor indeed had never heard that it was our duty to read in it (to wit) the Light of Christ in our consciences, our minds never being turned towards it before.&quot; A day or two later it was lecture day at the parish church, she invited Fox to attend with them; he came in after the singing and asked for liberty to speak. Over the next weeks she and many of her household became convinced. Over the next six years, Swarthmoor Hall became a centre of Quaker activity; she served as an unofficial secretary for the new movement, receiving and forwarding letters from roving missionaries, and occasionally passing along admonitions to them from Fox, Richard Hubberthorne, James Nayler, and others. She wrote many epistles herself and collected and disbursed funds for those on missions. After her husband&#x27;s death in 1658, she retained control of Swarthmoor Hall, which remained a meeting place and haven from persecution, though sometimes, in the 1660s, raided by government forces.

Because she was one of the few founding members of the Religious Society of Friends who was an established member of the gentry, Margaret Fell was frequently called upon to intercede in cases of persecution or arrest of leaders such as Fox. After the Stuart Restoration, she travelled from Lancashire to London to petition King Charles II and his parliament in 1660 and 1662 for freedom of conscience in religious matters. A submission signed by George Fox and other prominent (male) Quakers was made only subsequently in November 1660. While the structure and phraseology of these submissions were quite different, the import was similar, arguing that, although Friends wished to see the world changed, they would use persuasion rather than violence towards what they regarded as a &quot;heavenly&quot; (i.e. spiritual) end.

In 1664 Margaret Fell was arrested for failing to take an oath and for allowing Quaker Meetings to be held in her home. She defended herself by saying that &quot;as long as the Lord blessed her with a home, she would worship him in it&quot;. She spent six months in Lancaster Gaol, whereafter she was sentenced to life imprisonment and forfeiture of her property. She remained in prison until 1668, during which time she wrote religious pamphlets and epistles. Perhaps her most famous work is &quot;Women&#x27;s Speaking Justified&quot;, a scripture-based argument for women&#x27;s ministry, and one of the major texts on women&#x27;s religious leadership in the 17th century. In this short pamphlet, Fell bases her argument for equality of the sexes on one of the basic premises of Quakerism, namely spiritual equality. Her belief was that God created all human beings, therefore both men and women were capable of not only possessing the Inner Light but also the ability to be a prophet.

Having been released by order of the King and council, she married George Fox in 1669. On returning to Lancashire after her marriage, she was again imprisoned for about a year in Lancaster for breaking the Conventicle Act. Shortly after her release, George Fox departed on a religious mission to America, and he too was imprisoned again on his return in 1673. Margaret again travelled to London to intercede on his behalf, and he was eventually freed in 1675. After this, they spent about a year together at Swarthmoor, collaborating on defending the recently created organisational structure of separate women&#x27;s meetings for discipline against their anti-Fox opponents.
George Fox spent most of the rest of his life thereafter abroad or in London until his death in 1691, while Margaret Fell spent most of the rest of her life at Swarthmoor. Surviving both husbands by a number of years, she continued to take an active part in the affairs of the Society including the changes in the 1690s following partial legal tolerance of Quakers, when she was well into her eighties. In the last decade of her life, she firmly opposed the effort of her fellow believers in Lancashire to maintain certain traditional Quaker standards of conduct (for example, in matters of dress). She died aged 87, on the 23rd of April 1702. She was buried in an unmarked grave in the Society of Friends&#x27; burial ground at Sunbrick, to the south of Birkrigg Common.

The Margaret Fell room at Friends House, London, UK is named after her.

==In literature==
Margaret Fell&#x27;s meeting with George Fox and her subsequent conversion are the subject of the first part of the novel &quot;The Peaceable Kingdom&quot; by Jan de Hartog.
She was the author (or co-author) of at least 23 works in total, mostly in the form of short pamphlets including, &quot;False Prophets&quot;, &quot;Antichrists&quot;, &quot;Deceivers&quot;. All three were written shortly after her conversion to Quakerism in 1655. Some of her more substantial works—including &quot;A Call to the Universall Seed of God&quot; (1665), &quot;Womens Speaking Justified&quot; (1666; second edition, 1667), and &quot;A Touch-Stone: or, A Perfect Tryal by the Scriptures&quot; (1667)—were written during the period of her imprisonment in Lancaster Castle (1664–68). Following her death, several of her works were collected together and published as &quot;A Brief Collection of Remarkable Passages and Occurrences&quot; (1710). Despite its 535 pages, this collection is nevertheless incomplete and includes only a small sample of letters. Her works are now available in their original form in online databases such as &quot;Early English Books Online&quot;, or in selective modern anthologies such as &quot;Wallace&quot; (1992), &quot;Booy&quot; (2004), &quot;Garman et al&quot; (1996), and &quot;Donawerth &amp; Lush&quot; (1996). Elsa F. Glines has published 164 of Fell’s surviving letters in her collection &quot;The Letters of Margaret Fell&quot; (2003).

<text>Pratt Institute is a private university with its main campus in New York City. It has an additional campus in Manhattan and an extension campus in Utica, New York at the Munson-Williams-Proctor Arts Institute. The institute was founded in 1887 with programs primarily in engineering, architecture, and fine arts. Comprising six schools, the institute is primarily known for its programs in architecture, graphic design, interior design, and industrial design.

==History==

===Inception===

Pratt Institute was founded in 1887 by American industrialist Charles Pratt, who was a successful businessman and oil tycoon and was one of the wealthiest men in the history of Brooklyn. Pratt was an early pioneer of the oil industry in the United States and was the founder of Astral Oil Works based in the Greenpoint section of Brooklyn which was a leader in replacing whale oil with petroleum or natural oil. In 1867, Pratt established Charles Pratt and Company. In 1874, Pratt&#x27;s companies amalgamated with John D. Rockefeller&#x27;s companies. They became part of the Standard Oil trust where Pratt continued his active involvement on the board and the running of it.

Pratt, an advocate of education, wanted to provide working men and women the opportunity to better their lives through education. Even though Pratt never had the chance to go to college himself, he wanted to create an affordable college accessible to the working class. Beginning with the 1884 purchases of large plots of land near his home in Clinton Hill to open a school. The school would end up being built only two blocks from Charles Pratt&#x27;s residence on Clinton Avenue.

From his fortunes with Astral Oil and Charles Pratt and Company, in 1886 he endowed and founded Pratt Institute. In May 1887, the New York State Legislature granted Charles Pratt a charter to open the school; on October 17, 1887, the institute opened to 12 students in the Main Hall. Tuition was $4 per class per term (approximately ). The college was one of the first in the country open to all people, regardless of class, color, and gender. In the early years, the institute&#x27;s mission was to offer education to those who never had it offered to them before. Pratt believed that teaching technical skills-drawing, building, designing-promoted intellectual thought and creativity. And in a reciprocal manner, exposure to the ideals and aesthetics of fine art. Specifically, many programs were tailored to the growing need to train industrial workers in the changing economy with training in design and engineering. Early programs sought to teach students a variety of subjects such as architectural engineering, mechanics, dressmaking, and furniture making. Graduates of the school were taught to become engineers, mechanics, and technicians. Drawing, whether freehand, mechanical, or architectural, thought of as being a universal language, united such diverse programs and thus all programs in the school had a strong foundation in drawing. In addition, the curriculum at the institute was to be complemented by a large Liberal Arts curriculum. Students studied subjects such as history, mathematics, physics, and literature to better understand the world in which they would be working, which is still used in Pratt&#x27;s curriculum.

===Early years===

Enrollment grew steadily from its inception. Six months after opening, the school had an enrollment of nearly 600 students. By the first anniversary of the school, there were 1,000 students in attendance. In five years the school had nearly 4,000 students. In 1888, &quot;Scientific American&quot; said of the school that &quot;it is undoubtedly the most important enterprise of its kind in this country, if not in the world&quot;. Andrew Carnegie visited Pratt for inspiration and used the school as a model in developing Carnegie Technical Schools, now Carnegie Mellon University. At the first Founder&#x27;s Day celebration in 1888, Charles Pratt addressed what would become the school&#x27;s motto: &quot;be true to your work and your work will be true to you&quot;—meaning that students should educate and develop themselves diligently and go out into the world working hard, giving all of themselves.

As public interest grew in the school and demand increased, the school began adding new programs including the Pratt High School, Library School, Music Department, and Department of Commerce. Because of the overwhelming popularity of the Department of Commerce, the department broke off from the main institute and formed its own school, under the guidance of Norman P. Heffley, personal secretary to Charles Pratt. The Heffley School of Commerce, the former Pratt Department of Commerce, originally having shared facilities with Pratt, evolved into Brooklyn Law School.

In 1891, the institute&#x27;s founder and first president, Charles Pratt, died and his eldest son, Charles Millard Pratt, became president of the school. In 1893, Charles Pratt&#x27;s other son, Frederic B. Pratt, was elected President of Pratt Institute taking over from his elder brother. Because Charles Pratt Snr. died so soon after the college was founded, Frederic Pratt is ascribed with guiding the college through its early decades. Under the direction of Pratt&#x27;s sons, the institute thrived both financially and critically with many new construction projects and courses. By 1892, the number of students enrolled was 3,900. In 1897 the most popular major was domestic arts.

In 1896, the school opened its monumental Victorian-Renaissance Revival library with interiors designed by the Tiffany Decorating and Glass Company and sprawling gardens outside the library. The library was open to students and the general public as well. The Pratt Institute Library was the first and only public library in Brooklyn for nearly 15 years. It served as a working classroom for the training of librarians and was one of the first schools of library science. The Pratt Institute Library also made available the first reading room for children in New York City.

By the turn of the century, The School of Science and Technology had become Pratt&#x27;s most prestigious and well-known school and constituted most of the school&#x27;s enrollment. Across from East Building on Grand Avenue, the institute constructed a new quad for the engineering school over a quarter of a century. The Chemistry, Machinery, and Engineering buildings were constructed in the same architectural style, unifying all disciplines offered by the School. Pratt also had a variety of courses dedicated specifically to women. Some of the 25 courses women could partake in included library science, nursing, home economics, and fashion.

By 1910, all of the departments of the institute were organized as individual schools including the Library School, School of Domestic Science, School of Fine and Applied Arts, and the School of Science and Technology.

===Degree-granting status and increase in enrollment===
As World War I faced the nation in 1914, Pratt partnered with the United States government to aid the war effort. The School of Science and Technology had its own Student Army Training Corps which taught enlistees engineering skills needed for the war. Students designed aircraft used in the war and trained pilots. In 1927, mechanical engineering alumnus Donald A. Hall designed the &quot;Spirit of Saint Louis&quot;, used by Charles Lindbergh in the first transatlantic flight.

By 1938, most programs at the school had begun offering four-year Bachelor of Science degrees and Pratt transformed itself from a technical school to a college. By granting bachelor&#x27;s degrees, Pratt had to revise its curriculum from two years to four years. The changes also reflected New York State requirements for granting degrees and stricter government and professional licensing regulations for graduates. During this decade, the basic program for all Art School students was founded. In 1940 Pratt began granting graduate degrees.

During World War II, Pratt also helped in the war effort as it did during World War I with the engineering school training servicemen before they were deployed. Students helped to design camouflage for soldiers, buildings, and weapons. Following the war, the school saw a large influx of veterans enrolling as part of the GI Bill.

In the 1940s, the School of Science and Technology changed its name to the School of Engineering and in 1946 established its own honor society with mechanical engineering becoming the most popular major at Pratt. In 1953, Francis H. Horn became the first president of Pratt who was not a member of the Pratt family. Enrollment continued to climb throughout the decade and in 1948 the institute reached an all-time high in attendance with 6,000 students. By 1950, Pratt had become accredited by the Middle States Association of Colleges and Schools. In 1954, the architecture department split from the Engineering School to become its own school.

===Campus reorganization===
As part of white flight in the 1950s and 1960s which affected the majority of New York City the neighborhood of Clinton Hill began to see a transformation from an upper-class, affluent, white community to one chiefly populated by poor and working-class people of color. Pratt considered moving its campus to more affluent Long Island or Manhattan to increase its attractiveness but decided to stay at its original Brooklyn campus due to the history and Charles Pratt&#x27;s mission.

As part of Robert Moses&#x27; plan for urban renewal in New York City, Pratt&#x27;s physical campus saw the greatest amount of change in its history. Before the 1950s, the school was located in separate buildings located on several public streets. However, after Moses&#x27; clearance of many structures located between Pratt&#x27;s buildings, including homes, the land was given over to the school, and a true campus was established. Ryerson Street, Grand Avenue, Steuben Street, and Emerson Place were closed to automobile traffic, and the campus was enclosed, forming the Grand Mall to connect the institute&#x27;s buildings. The elevated train running along Grand Avenue between the East Building/Student Union and the Engineering Quad was dismantled. In the new real estate, the school was able to build several new structures, Dekalb Hall, Information Science Center and North Hall, all designed by the firm of McKim, Mead &amp; White, including the Information Science Center and Dekalb Hall as well as a new student union. Moses&#x27; construction projects around the school helped to build the School of Architecture. Research funds were granted to the school to help discover new building techniques. By 1963, the urban planning department formed the Pratt Center for Community Development in an attempt to revitalize Pratt&#x27;s surrounding neighborhood and Brooklyn.

===Enrollment decline and financial issues===
In the 1970s and continuing well into the 1980s New York City and Brooklyn still faced large amounts of crime and poverty. Enrollment fell and the school faced a budget deficit. Prospective students and faculty felt uneasy about the safety of the campus and community. In 1974, the men&#x27;s basketball team came to the attention of national media outlets when Cyndi Meserve joined the team becoming the first woman to play men&#x27;s NCAA basketball. More students earned architecture degrees than mechanical engineering degrees in 1975. Architecture degrees became the most popular degree at Pratt, and remain so. In anticipation of the institute&#x27;s centennial in 1987, several capital improvements were made to the campus, in an attempt to restore many dilapidated buildings. The Grand Mall was re-landscaped with new plantings, brick pathways, and lighting and the Newman Amphitheater was built in 1988 in celebration of the hundredth anniversary. President Richardson Pratt Jr retired in 1990 after nearly twenty years as president. He was the last president descended from founder Charles Pratt.

By 1993, Thomas F. Schutte was appointed as president and became the longest-serving president not from the Pratt family. In the same year, Pratt controversially closed its School of Engineering, an integral part of founder Charles Pratt&#x27;s long-term vision. Historically, the school was Pratt&#x27;s most successful, and many associated the school with its engineering program. In response to the institute-wide decrease in enrollment and school-wide budget issues, closing the School of Engineering was thought of as being the only feasible option to keep the school&#x27;s other programs afloat and to address the budget. Students in the Engineering program were transferred to Polytechnic Institute of New York University while tenured professors were relocated to the School of Architecture and the science and math departments in the School of Liberal Arts and Sciences.

===Revitalization and growth===

By closing the costly School of Engineering, the school was able to clear its debt and get on the track to financial success. Funds were allocated for campus-wide beautification projects and restoration and modernization of historic buildings, starting with Memorial Hall. Part of the beautification projects included adding the Pratt Institute Sculpture Park in 1999 where contemporary art sculptures are placed throughout the campus lawns and gardens, making it the largest contemporary sculpture park in New York City. Pratt began a partnership with Pratt Munson College of Art and Design and Delaware College of Art and Design for art students to study for two years at either campus and finish their degrees at Pratt&#x27;s School of Art and Design in Brooklyn. During the 1990s the school was able to increase enrollment by twenty-five percent, from approximately 3,000 students in 1990 to 4,000 students in 2000.

Vincent A. Stabile, a 1940 graduate of the School of Engineering, donated about $13 million to Pratt, the largest donation made by any alumnus in the college&#x27;s history, with the request to President Schutte that the donation be used to reopen the School of Engineering. President Schutte rejected Stabile&#x27;s request and allocated his funds to construct a new residence hall named in his honor. From the mid-1980s to the 2000s Pratt experienced the transition from being mainly a commuter school to becoming a residential school through the construction of new residence halls Cannoneer Court, Pantas Hall, and Stabile Hall.

==Brooklyn campus==

Pratt Institute&#x27;s main campus is located on a historic, esteemed, enclosed campus located in the Clinton Hill neighborhood in Brooklyn, 2 miles from Downtown Brooklyn and 3 miles from Lower Manhattan. Midtown Manhattan is just 5 miles from the campus.

The campus is accessible by two public entrances, both of which close in the evening hours and are guarded by security 24 hours a day. The main gate located at Willoughby Avenue on the north side of campus is accessible for pedestrians and vehicles while the secondary pedestrian-only gate located at the corner of Hall Street and DeKalb Avenue at the southwest part of campus is convenient for commuters and for students to get to Higgins Hall. In addition, there are three other swipe card access gates available only for student use. The campus is very park-like and fully landscaped and provides a stark contrast to the urban neighborhood that surrounds the school.

The four main areas of the campus include the Library Rose Garden, Cannon Court, Newman Mall and Amphitheater, and the Engineering Quad:
* The historically significant Rose Garden is located directly north of the library and was built as a part of the library acting as a public park. At the center of the garden is a 1926 World War I memorial to commemorate the men and women of Pratt Institute in the World War.
* The Cannon Court is located directly south of the library and serves as the main entrance from the Hall Street gate. A central feature of the court is a large bronze Spanish cannon from 1720 originally from Seville, Spain, and brought to Pratt from Morro Castle in Havana, Cuba in 1899. Trees and meandering pathways lead to the library and Newman Mall.
* The Newman Mall takes up the center of the campus with many of the academic buildings alongside the mall. The mall is characterized by brick pathways with mature trees lining a central lawn. To the north of the mall is a small amphitheater, designed by Skidmore, Owings and Merrill.
* The Engineering Quadrangle, which is recognized as a historic landmark, is located north of the Newman Mall toward the eastern side of campus with the Chemistry, Machinery, and Engineering buildings enclosing the quad which has terraced landscaping and gardens with many mature trees.

The entire campus is open to the public as park space during the daytime. Throughout the campus, many contemporary sculptures fill the gardens and landscape, making the campus home to the largest sculpture park in New York City. The Pratt Sculpture Park, founded in 1999, is the largest contemporary sculpture park in New York City and includes more than 40 pieces at any given time installed across the 25-acre campus in Brooklyn. Some of the artists who have loaned their work to the park include Shin Sang Ho, Mark di Suvero, Donald Lipski, Tom Otterness, Richard Serra, Takashi Soga, Gunnar Theel, and Allan Wexler.

==Buildings==
Pratt is home to a diverse collection of buildings composed of several architectural styles. Most of the buildings at the school were built before World War II in the style of Romanesque Revival, Victorian, and Neoclassical styles and were designed by prominent nineteenth and twentieth-century architects. After the war, Pratt began building more contemporary styled buildings.

In 2011, &quot;Architectural Digest&quot; named Pratt as being one of the top ten most architecturally significant college campuses in the country, for its seamless collection of buildings ranging from since the 1800s.

The Main Building, East Hall Building, and Student Union are all located adjacent to one another and make up a complex of the original buildings, all built specifically for the Institute in 1887:
* Located in the north-central part of campus, the Main Building is a six-story Romanesque Revival brick building designed by Lamb and Rich and was the first building to open at the school. The roof features an iconic clock tower, which overlooks the Rose Garden. The building houses administrative offices, classrooms, and art studios for the Arts Department of the School of Art and Design. In February 2013 a fire erupted throughout the top floors of the building, destroying much of the interior structure and students&#x27; work.
* East Hall is located directly behind Main Hall and faces Grand Walk. Designed by William Windrim, a main feature of the brick building is the large smokestack which served the institute&#x27;s power generation plant. Within the Hall are a variety of services for students including Career Services, Student Activities, International Student Affairs, and the Pratt Chapel. Located in the lower level of the building is Pratt&#x27;s continuously operating, privately owned, steam-powered electrical generating plant built originally to serve the power needs of the school. In 1977 the facility was recognized by the American Society of Mechanical Engineers and named a National Mechanical Engineering Landmark. As part of its goal of reducing emissions 40 percent by 2040, Pratt plans to transition its steam-powered electrical generating plant away from burning natural gas or heavy oil. In 2023 Pratt Institute removed two Combustion Engineering water tube boilers,
And, replaced these boilers with two Cleaver Brooks fire tube boilers.https://www.jrmcm.com/project/pratt-institute/

* The Student Union, by architect William Tubby, was originally built as the Trade School building but soon after completion was completely remodeled as the Student Union complete with a gymnasium and swimming pool. In 1982 the building was renovated again as the new Student Union. All three buildings wrap around an interior courtyard that connects out to the Newman Mall and Library Rose Garden. The centerpiece of the courtyard is a 17th-century Italian marble well-head fountain purchased by the Pratt family in 1900. Renovated once more in the summer of 2018, the Student Union is a place for the Pratt community to gather, study, relax, and innovate.

Other structures include:
* South Hall, located along Reyerson Walk to the direct south of Main Building, was finished in 1892 by William Tubby and was built as the Pratt High School. When the high school closed near the turn-of-the-century, the building was used for the School of Domestic Arts and Sciences. The building is now home to classrooms, studios, and offices for programs in the Department of Fine Arts, part of the School of Art and Design.
* Pratt Institute Library, which was opened in 1888 to serve students and the general public as well, became the first free Public Library in Brooklyn. The architect of the building was William Tubby of Brooklyn. The interior in the building was done by the Tiffany Glass and Decorating Company.
* The Chemistry, Machinery, and Engineering Buildings are located across from Grand Walk and East Building, which are clustered around the Engineering Quad&#x27;s lawn and gardens. They were built in phases between 1908 and 1928 and designed by architecture firm Howells &amp; Stokes. These buildings originally housed courses for Pratt&#x27;s School of Engineering until it was dismantled in 1993. The machinery building houses, a Print lab, Metal Shop, Ceramics Studios and WoodShop. The second floor of the Engineering building now houses Pratt&#x27;s largest computer lab on campus, with several classrooms of Mac and PC workstations and a collection of scanners, printers, and plotters. The basement houses Pratt&#x27;s Material Lab and Center for Sustainable Design Strategies.
* The school&#x27;s auditorium, Memorial Hall, was built in 1927 with John Mead Howells serving as the architect. It is located across from the Rose Garden along Reyerson Walk, between the Main Building and North Hall.
* Built as part of the urban renewal project led by Robert Moses, North Hall is located directly north of Memorial Hall and was designed by McKim, Mead, and White in 1958. The building houses Pratt&#x27;s Main cafeteria and the school&#x27;s bank. Classrooms for the School of Liberal Arts and Sciences are located on the upper levels of the building.
* DeKalb Hall and the Information Science Center were also designed by McKim, Mead, and White earlier in 1955. They originally served as men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s dormitories respectively until Pratt acquired Willoughby Hall. After the acquisition of Willoughby, the buildings were remodeled to serve classroom and administrative needs. DeKalb Hall, located to the far west of campus and south of the Library and Cannon Court, is home to administrative offices. The Information Science Center is also located to the far west of campus, but north of the Library and Rose Garden, which was home to the School of Information.
* The Juliana Curran Terian Design Center is made up of two separate wings, Steuben Hall to the east and Pratt Studios west, which hold all of Pratt&#x27;s design programs. Located at the southern edge of the campus between Pantas Hall and the Athletics and Recreation Center, this building is home to the Interior Design, Industrial Design, Communication Design, and Fashion Design Departments, as well as the givetake art supply recycling initiative. At the center of the building, there is a small courtyard. Originally the center was two separate buildings that were acquired by Pratt in 1962 and 1970, respectively. The buildings were originally built around the turn-of-the-century and served as factories until Pratt acquired them. A new glass and metal entry pavilion, named in honor of architecture alumni and donor Juliana Curran Terian, was constructed in 2007 and was designed to the two original, separate, brick buildings. The lead architect for the project was the School of Architecture&#x27;s Dean, Thomas Hanrahan.
* Myrtle Hall is Pratt&#x27;s newest building, having opened in 2010. The building, located one block north of campus, was designed by Pratt Institute School of Architecture alumnus Jack Esterson AIA of the New York City architecture and engineering firm WASA/Studio A, and has achieved LEED Gold Certification. The building houses Student Services (registrar, bursar, and financial aid), Admissions, the Pratt Center for Community Development, and the Digital Art Center.
* The Caroline Ladd Pratt House is owned by the school. It is used as the college president&#x27;s mansion and for gala events. It was completed in 1898 and designed by architects Babb, Cook, and Willard for Frederic B. Pratt, the institute&#x27;s third president, the son of Charles Pratt (and family). It is located four blocks west of the school on Clinton Avenue, near the other Pratt family mansions.
* Higgins Hall, located one block south of the main campus, houses the entire School of Architecture with the exception of Construction Management programs. The historic Romanesque Revival landmark building with a contemporary center wing houses the school&#x27;s Administrative Offices, computer labs, student classrooms, laboratories, a lecture hall, a small café, and the Hazel and Robert H. Siegel Gallery. The building was originally built for the prestigious Adelphi Academy, now Adelphi University in phases from 1868 through 1890 by Mundell and Teckritz and Charles C. Haight. Charles Pratt also partially funded the construction of the building as part of his philanthropic efforts. The building was given to Pratt Institute in 1965 by the wife of John Higgins, architect and alumni of Adelphi Academy. The School of Architecture was relocated here. In 1996, the building experienced a major fire, destroying the center wing of the building and severely damaging the northern and southern wings. In 2005, the school replaced the center wing with a new sleek and contemporary glass structure, which linked historic brick northern and southern wings designed by Steven Holl, and incorporated complementary contrast to the original essence. As part of the rebuilding of Higgins Hall, Rogers Marvel Architects restored and renovated the original nineteenth-century wings to their former glory.

===Historic sites===
Several Pratt Institute&#x27;s buildings and landscapes are historically significant. The Pratt Institute Historic District is a national historic district that comprises 10 contributing buildings built between 1885 and 1936. Several buildings are recognized as being New York City Designated Landmarks. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2005 and was awarded the Getty Foundation Campus Heritage Grant. Two buildings outside the historic district, Higgins Hall and the Caroline Ladd Pratt House are also listed on the historic register as being a part of the Clinton Hill Historic District. The buildings and structures listed on the U.S. National Register of Historic Places for their architectural or historical significance are:
===Residence halls===
Pratt, a residential campus, offers seven different residence options for its students. All residence hall students are provided with a bed (twin extra-long), a desk, a chair, and a dresser. Students residing in a dorm without in-unit kitchens are required to be on a mandatory meal plan (Stabile, Emerson, ELJ, and Pantas), while those with in-unit kitchens can sign up for an optional meal plan (Willoughby and Grand Avenue). Emerson Place, Leo J. Pantas Hall, and Vincent A. Stabile Hall are the primary freshman dorms. In total, 51 percent of undergraduate students reside on campus while 92 percent of incoming freshmen students reside on campus. Pratt offers the following residence halls for students to choose from:
* Esther Lloyd-Jones Hall is named for a trendsetter in modern American higher education. The building was originally a private apartment building built in 1921 but was acquired by Pratt in 1964 as used for dormitories. ELJ accommodates students in single and double rooms in apartment-style accommodations. ELJ is occupied primarily by upperclassmen continuing students.
* Emerson Hall is the newest dorm on the Pratt campus, opening in Fall 2019. It was built specifically to be a freshman dorm. It was collaboratively designed by CannonDesign and Hanrahan Meyers Architects to encourage interaction. The dorm is off campus, across the street from the Film and Video Building. The dorm contains double rooms, with several individual bathrooms and separate, individual shower rooms on each floor to be shared by those inhabiting each floor. Each floor also contains a large central common space with a small kitchen on each floor.
* Leo J. Pantas Hall was opened in 1987 and designed by Skidmore, Owings and Merrill and sits centrally located on campus. Students live in four-person suites, which consist of two double rooms (two people in each double room), and each suite has its bathroom. Suites are single-sex, but floors are co-ed. The building boasts a work/study rooms and communal lounges. The building was designed in brick with a clock tower, echoing the style of the original 1887 Main Building. Pantas is primarily a freshman residence hall.

* Vincent A. Stabile Hall opened in the Fall of 1999 and designed by Pasanella+Klein, Stolzman+Berg Architects. Named for the donor and graduate of the Engineering School, it was designed for new undergraduate students. It houses 240 students in four-person suites. Each suite consists of two double rooms with a shared bath. There are kitchenettes located on each floor. Stabile is primarily a freshman residence hall.
* The Pratt Townhouses are historic landmarks that were originally constructed from 1901 to 1910 in the colonial revival style to serve as faculty housing. The townhomes were designed by Hobart C. Walker. After being neglected for several years, Pratt renovated the townhouses to be used by upperclassmen. Each unit consists of six single rooms spread across three stories, a full kitchen, living room, parlor, basement, and shared backyard.
* Willoughby Hall is a former private apartment building built as part of Robert Moses&#x27; urban renewal projects surrounding Pratt, and is the largest residence hall. Built in 1957 by architect John Mead Howells, the 16-story building accommodates 800 undergraduate men and women. In addition to the standard furniture, all apartments have a kitchen table, stove, and refrigerator. All students are assigned to double, triple, or single spaces. The converted apartments consist of at least one double or triple that occupies the former living-room space of the apartment. The number of students residing in a given apartment ranges from two to six students, depending upon the size of the converted apartment—studio, one, two, or three bedrooms.
* Grand Avenue Residence is home to new and continuing graduate students. The building can accommodate 50 students in efficiency apartments (double and single) and private single rooms within two- and three-bedroom apartments. A double-efficiency apartment is two students sharing a one-room apartment (with a kitchen and bath). A single-efficiency apartment is one student in a private one-room apartment with a kitchen and bath. A shared single is two or more students, each with a private bedroom, sharing a kitchen, bath, and living room. The building is located one block from campus. Each living room is furnished with a sofa, club chair, coffee table, kitchen table, and chairs.

===Transportation===
Pratt does not provide any official sponsored transportation options for its students, but there are several public transportation options located directly off Pratt&#x27;s main campus.

The school is served by MTA New York City Bus routes with the bus route servicing the campus to the south with stations along DeKalb and Lafayette Avenues and the bus route serving the area north of the campus along Myrtle Avenue. In addition, the New York City Subway&#x27;s has one station located at the intersection of Washington and Lafayette Avenues and another located at the intersection of Classon and Lafayette Avenues. The Clinton–Washington Avenues station (IND Crosstown Line) is located directly across the street from Higgins Hall. The Classon Avenue station (IND Crosstown Line) is located one block south of the southeast corner of campus. In addition, the has an entrance to Clinton–Washington Avenues station (IND Fulton Street Line) four blocks south of the Hall Gate entrance and three blocks south of Higgins Hall.

New York City&#x27;s public bike-share program, Citi Bike, has stations nearby at Lafayette Avenue and Saint James Place; at Hall Street and Willoughby Avenue; and Emerson Place and Myrtle Avenue.

The Long Island Rail Road at Atlantic Terminal, is located a short walk from the campus. Pratt participates in New Jersey Transit&#x27;s University Partnership Program where students can receive a twenty-five percent discount on monthly passes based out of Penn Station in Manhattan.

==Pratt Manhattan==
The Pratt Manhattan center, located at 144 West 14th Street, between 6th and 7th Avenue, is home to Pratt&#x27;s associate degrees programs in graphic design, illustration, and digital design, and interactive media, an undergraduate program in construction management, several of Pratt&#x27;s graduate programs including the master&#x27;s degrees in the School of Information, Facilities management, Design Management, Arts and Cultural Management, and the School of Continuing and Professional Studies which offers an array of non-credit courses and Certificate Programs, including certificates in Digital Design, Advanced Perfumery, Creative Interiors, Floral Art and Design, among many others. This seven-story historic building was acquired by Pratt in 2000. The Institute restored the building&#x27;s exterior to its original facade highlighting its decorative architectural and design elements and renovated the interior to feature its high ceilings and wood beams. A lovely staircase from the building&#x27;s lobby leads to the Pratt Manhattan Gallery.

This new building houses the School for Information, the Graduate Programs in Design Management, Arts and Cultural Management, the two-year associate degree Programs in Digital Design, Graphic Design, and Illustration, and the Manhattan office of the School of Continuing and Professional Studies. The modern building has many resources like a library, computer lab, and meeting spaces.

In 1974, the New York Phoenix School of Design, formerly the New York School of Applied Design for Women and the Phoenix Art Institute, merged with the Pratt Institute to form the Pratt-New York Phoenix School of Design, which offered three-year certificate programs in art and design at least into the late 1970s. It is located in the landmark New York School of Applied Design Building at 160 Lexington Avenue, at the northwest corner of Lexington and 30th Street. At this time, Manhattan had long been the epicenter of publishing design during the latter-twentieth century. This new commercial-art-dedicated satellite was modeled to apply intensely concentrated vocational training in graphic design, illustration, package design, and textile design. Its faculty was largely composed of Manhattan&#x27;s working professionals, who themselves had achieved the level of skill necessary to meet the city&#x27;s global-defining standards. Magazines, books, music albums, movie posters, print and television advertisements, and packaging for all forms of retail products were the intended goals for its graduates, as well as Manhattan&#x27;s omnipresent fashion industry. In addition, the below-ground space in the school was converted into a state-of-the-art printmaking facility, teaching artist-created lithography, silk screening, and engraving.

==Student life==

=== Clubs and student organizations ===
As of October 2022, Pratt is home to 122 clubs with a wide range of focuses. Some of these clubs include the Pratt Photo League, the Latinx Student Alliance, the Pratt Institute Botanical Society, Aura Dance Crew, and the Students for Socialist Revolution. Clubs at Pratt don&#x27;t just hold meetings, but also host on-campus events and arrange exhibitions of club members&#x27; work.

===Student media===
Pratt has several student media groups including a Film Club.
* &quot;The Prattler&quot; is Pratt&#x27;s quarterly student magazine/newspaper, established in 1940.

* &quot;Pratt Radio&quot;, a student-run internet radio station broadcasts on the web. Originally broadcasting from a limited-range signal in the mid-1980s, the FCC stepped in and shut the operation down after students modified the broadcast tower, rendering Pratt Radio pirate radio. The station later re-emerged in 2001 as a legitimate internet-only station.
* &quot;The Felt&quot; is an online journal of poetry and prose from the MFA Writing program.

===Fraternities and sororities===

Pratt sponsors 14 NCAA intercollegiate programs and is a member of the Coast to Coast Conference (C2C), with men&#x27;s volleyball being a member of the Colonial States Athletic Conference (CSAC). Pratt began its transition to NCAA Division III with an exploratory season in 2018-19, which was rewarded with provisional membership the following year.

===Facilities===
Designed by Ezra Ehrenkranz and Daniel Tully and constructed in 1974, the Activity Resource Center, or simply known as &quot;The ARC&quot;, is the main hub for Pratt Athletics and Recreation. The ARC boasts several courts for recreational and competitive activities, a fitness and performance room, a multi-use studio room, a 200-meter indoor track, a boxing and functional fitness area, and over 41,000 square feet of open event space for special occurrences. 

It also previously hosted the annual Colgate Games, the nation&#x27;s largest amateur track series for girls from elementary school through college.

===Mascot===
The school&#x27;s mascot, the Cannoneer, derives from the 19th-century cannon that stands prominently near the main gate to the campus. Cast in bronze in Seville, Spain, the cannon bears the insignia of Philip V and was brought to Pratt from the walls of Morro Castle in Havana, Cuba, in 1899.

===Accomplishments===
====Men&#x27;s Basketball====
The men&#x27;s basketball team has a storied tradition, including the fourth-longest collegiate basketball rivalry in the nation between Pratt and Polytechnic University (Brooklyn, NY), with Pratt holding the overall record 78–59. The Cannoneers also took home a national collegiate championship title in 1901 and made four NAIA (&#x27;59, &#x27;60, &#x27;61, and &#x27;62) and two ECAC (&#x27;77,&#x27;79) post-season appearances. 

Former players included Ed Mazria (&#x27;62), who was drafted by the New York Knicks, and Anthony Heyward (&#x27;94), who toured with the And1 streetball team as &quot;Half Man Half Amazing&quot;. Bernard Chang was formerly captain of the men&#x27;s varsity basketball team.

The women&#x27;s cross-country team recently captured the 2006 HMWAC championship title and coach Dalton Evans won &quot;Coach of the Year&quot; honors. The men&#x27;s cross-country team also has a championship title. The women&#x27;s tennis team has won three HVWAC titles, including an appearance in the ECAC tournament.

===Intramurals===
In addition, there are intramural activities scheduled throughout the year, ranging from individual (tennis and track &amp; field) to team sports (soccer, basketball, volleyball, and touch football). Two premier student intramural events include the fall classic Halloween Pratt Ratt Outdoor Obstacle Relay Race and the annual Mr. &amp; Ms. Pratt All Thatt Fitness &amp; Artistic Expression Pageant finale.

<doc id="778118" wikidata="Q5234782" url="?curid=778118" title="David Hartley (the Younger)">
<text>David Hartley the Younger (1732 – 19 December 1813) was an English politician and inventor and the son of the philosopher David Hartley. He was Member of Parliament (MP) for Kingston upon Hull, and also held the position of His Britannic Majesty&#x27;s Minister Plenipotentiary, appointed by King George III to treat with the United States of America as to American independence and other issues after the American Revolution. He was a signatory to the 1783 Treaty of Paris, which ended the American Revolutionary War. Hartley was the first MP to put the case for abolition of the slave trade before the House of Commons, moving a resolution in 1776 that &quot;the slave trade is contrary to the laws of God and the rights of men&quot;.

==Life==
Hartley was born in Bath, Somerset, England in 1732. He matriculated at Corpus Christi College, Oxford on 6 April 1747 at age 15. He was awarded his B.A. on 14 March 1750 and was a fellow of Merton College, Oxford until his death. He became a student of Lincoln&#x27;s Inn in 1759. During the 1760s, he gained recognition as a scientist and, through mutual interests, he met and became an intimate friend and
correspondent of Benjamin Franklin. Hartley was sympathetic to the Lord Rockingham&#x27;s Whigs, although he did not hold office in either Rockingham ministry. He represented Kingston upon Hull in parliament from 1774 to 1780, and from 1782 to 1784, and attained considerable reputation as an opponent of the war with America, and of the African slave trade. Fellow abolitionist of slavery, William Wilberforce, took Hartley&#x27;s place as MP for Hull in 1780 and was co-Member during Hartley&#x27;s second term. 

He was expert in public finance and spoke frequently in Parliament in opposition to the war in America. Although a liberal on American policy, Hartley was a long-time friend of Lord North and strongly disliked the Prime Minister, Shelburne. He supported the Coalition by voting against Shelburne&#x27;s peace preliminaries. It was probably owing to his friendship with Benjamin Franklin, and to his consistent support of Lord Rockingham, that he was selected by the government to act as plenipotentiary in Paris, where, on 3 September 1783, he and Franklin drew up and signed the definitive treaty of peace between Great Britain and the United States.

Hartley died at Bath on 19 December 1813, aged 82.

His portrait was painted by George Romney and has been engraved by John Walker in mezzotint. Nathaniel William Wraxall says that Hartley, &quot;though destitute of all personal recommendation of manner, possessed some talent with unsullied probity, added to indefatigable perseverance and labour&quot;. He adds that his speeches were intolerably long and dull, and that &quot;his rising always operated like a dinner bell&quot; (&quot;Memoirs&quot;, iii. 490).

==Writings==
Hartley&#x27;s writings are mostly political, and set forth the arguments of the extreme liberals of his time. In 1764 he wrote a vigorous attack on the Bute administration, &quot;inscribed to the man who thinks himself a minister&quot;. His most important writings are his &quot;Letters on the American War&quot;, published in London in 1778 and 1779, and addressed to his constituents. &quot;The road&quot;, he writes, &quot;is open to national reconciliation between Great Britain and America. The ministers have no national object in view . . . the object was to establish an influential dominion of the crown by means of an independent American revenue uncontrolled by parliament&quot;. He seeks throughout to vindicate the opposition to the war. In 1794 he printed at Bath a sympathetic &quot;Argument on the French Revolution&quot;, addressed to his parliamentary electors.

Hartley edited his father&#x27;s well-known &quot;Observations on Man&quot;, in London 1791 and (with notes and additions) in 1801.

In 1859, a number of Hartley&#x27;s papers were sold in London. Six volumes of letters and other documents relating to the peace went to America and passed into the collection of Levi Leiter of Washington, D.C.; others are in the British Museum.

==Inventions==
In his last years, Hartley studied chemistry and mechanics. In 1774 he published &quot;Account of a Method of Securing Buildings and Ships against Fire&quot;, by placing thin iron planks under floors and attaching them to the ceilings, partly to prevent immediate access of the fire, and partly to stop the free supply of air. He built a house Wildcroft Manor on Putney Heath to verify the efficacy of his invention. An obelisk was built on the heath, adjacent to Tibbet&#x27;s corner, 1776 marking the Lord Mayor of London&#x27;s decision to give Hartley £2,500 for work on his fire plates. It makes mention of its being erected on the 110th anniversary of the Great Fire of London. On the occasion of a fire at Richmond House, on 21 December 1791, he wrote a pamphlet urging the value of his fire plates.

The brick obelisk with heavily inscribed foundation stone still stands on Putney Heath, near where the A219 veers from the A3 at Tibbet&#x27;s Corner, towards Putney. There is no parking at the site; however there is parking and footpath access from near the adjacent Telegraph Pub, off Wildcroft Road. Since 1955 the obelisk has been a Grade II listed building.

The inscription reads:

&quot;– South face (towards the A3):&lt;br&gt;
– East face:&lt;br&gt;

– North Face (towards the car park and public house):&lt;br&gt;
– West face:&lt;br&gt;

<text>Marcial Maciel Degollado (March 10, 1920 – January 30, 2008) was a Mexican Catholic priest who founded the Legion of Christ and the Regnum Christi movement. He was general director of the Legion from 1941 to 2005. Throughout most of his career, he was respected within the church as &quot;the greatest fundraiser of the modern Roman Catholic church&quot; and as a prolific recruiter of new seminarians. Late in his life, Maciel was revealed to have been a longtime drug addict who sexually abused many boys and young men in his care. After his death, it came to light that he had also maintained sexual relationships with at least four women, one of whom was a minor at the time. He fathered as many as six children, two of whom he is alleged to have sexually abused.

In 2006, Pope Benedict XVI removed Maciel from active ministry, based on the results of an investigation by the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith in April 2005. Maciel was ordered &quot;to conduct a reserved life of prayer and penance, renouncing every public ministry&quot;. He died in 2008. On March 25, 2010, a communiqué on the Legion&#x27;s website acknowledged as factual the &quot;reprehensible actions&quot; by Maciel, including sexual abuse of minor seminarians. In May 2010, the Vatican denounced Maciel&#x27;s actions and appointed a Papal Delegate to oversee the order and its governance.

==Early life and training==
Maciel was born in Cotija, Michoacán, Mexico, the youngest boy of nine children, to a family with strong connections within the Catholic Church in Mexico. Numerous relatives were priests, and four of his uncles were bishops. He had a troubled youth: his father ridiculed him and encouraged his brothers to whip him. He sent the boy to work in the sugar fields to toughen him up, and years later Maciel told one of his own victims that mule drivers on his father&#x27;s ranch had sexually abused him.

Maciel was the grand-nephew of Bishop Rafael Guízar y Valencia, who was canonized in 2007. There has been speculation that Maciel&#x27;s scandalous conduct at age 18 contributed to Guizar&#x27;s fatal heart attack. According to an investigative report:

The day before Bishop Guizar died, he had been heard shouting angrily at Marcial Maciel. He was giving his eighteen-year-old nephew a dressing down after two women had come to the bishop&#x27;s house to complain about Maciel, who was their neighbor. Father Orozco, who was among the original group of boys to found the Legion of Christ in 1941, said he heard the women had complained about the &quot;noise&quot; Maciel was making with children he had brought into his home to teach religion. He said that the seminary officials blamed Maciel for his uncle&#x27;s heart attack.

Maciel was expelled from two seminaries for reasons that have never been revealed, and became a priest only after one of his bishop uncles ordained him after private studies, on November 26, 1944, in Mexico City. The ordination was filmed and used in later years for publicity.

Maciel founded the Legion of Christ in 1941, with the support of Francisco González Arias, Bishop of Cuernavaca. From the beginning, he served as its general director. In 1959 Maciel founded its lay arm Regnum Christi. All Legionaries were compelled &quot;to take private vows, never to speak ill of Maciel or any superiors, and to report to their superiors anyone who did&quot;, facilitating a &quot;cult of personality&quot; according to Jason Berry. In Regnum Christi discussion groups, followers studied Maciel&#x27;s letters.

Maciel wrote extensively on the formation of priests and other matters pertaining to Church governance. His main stated purpose for the Legion of Christ was to form and motivate enterprising lay members of the Catholic Church to take an active part in the Church&#x27;s mission, in particular the members of Regnum Christi.

Through the Legion of Christ and the Regnum Christi, Maciel started many schools, a network of universities, and numerous charitable institutes.

==Earlier relations with the Vatican==

Until his misdeeds became public, Maciel was well-regarded by the Papal See. He accompanied Pope John Paul II on his visits to Mexico in 1979, 1990, and 1993, and was appointed by the Pope to the Ordinary Assembly of the Synod of Bishops on the Formation of Priests in Circumstances of the Present Day (1990). He was a member of the Interdicasterial Commission for a Just Distribution of Clergy (1991), the Fourth General Conference of Latin American Bishops (CELAM) (1992), the Ordinary Assembly of the Synod of Bishops on the Consecrated Life and Its Role in the Church and in the World (1994), the Synod of Bishops&#x27; Special Assembly for America (1997) and (since 1994) as a permanent consultant to the Congregation for the Clergy. The golden anniversary of his priestly ordination was celebrated on 26 November 1994, with 57 Legionary priests ordained the day prior. Maciel served as Chancellor of the Pontifical Athenaeum Regina Apostolorum, which is based in Rome.

Maciel collaborated extensively with Pope John Paul II, in person and through his subordinates in the Legion of Christ. The pope admired Maciel for strictly adhering to the magisterium and the vocations to the Legion of Christ. Maciel received many donations from Mexico&#x27;s richest families, much of which Maciel and the Legion passed on to the Vatican over many years. While many believe that Pope John Paul II was blinded by his trust of Maciel, a journalist has speculated that this financial channel was the reason the Church postponed acting on allegations of sexual abuse by Maciel.

When Pope Pius XII&#x27;s archives were opened to the public in 2024, documents were found showing Maciel was protected by Giuseppe Pizzardo, the then No. 2 of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, from a judgement proposed by Giovanni Battista Scapinelli. A 1956 draft of the memo describes a measure originally requiring Maciel to cease any contact with his students and attend treatment for his morphine addiction, or be suspended a divinis. By October 2, 1956, the measure was edited to remove the prohibition against contact with seminarians, and later documents say further action against Maciel was superseded by &quot;recommendations and interventions by high-ranking personalities&quot;.

==Fundraising==
Jason Berry reports that early in his career, only two years into being a priest, Maciel visited the Vatican in 1946 to donate $10,000 from &quot;several of Mexico&#x27;s wealthiest families and its president, Miguel Aleman Valdes&quot;, appealing for support for scholarships for seminarians to study in Spain.

Maciel sought and received large donations from the wives of wealthy men such as Flora Barragán, &quot;the widow of an industrialist&quot; from Monterrey. Barragán reportedly donated $50 million to Maciel&#x27;s Legion of Christ. According to José Barba, a &quot;Mexico City college professor and former Legion seminarian&quot;, “Maciel was 27 when he purchased the [first seminary] estate. In 1950 he began construction on the Instituto Cumbres, the first prep school, in Mexico City, the land for which Flora provided. That summer he also inaugurated Collegio Massimo in Rome. He was 30. In 1953 he tried to start construction of a college in Salamanca,&quot; but that was delayed a year.

The Garza-Sada families were another Monterrey group who donated to him. After the family patriarch, Dionisio Garza Garza, died, Maciel courted and received generous donations from his widow Roberta Garza. According to her daughter, the widow “never learned about his kids. He targeted women in Mexico of a certain class who were not allowed to work... For cultured women who were bored, Maciel offered a sense of purpose.” A &quot;continuing flow of money&quot; to Maciel&#x27;s projects also came from two children of Dionisio Garza Garza—Paulina and Luis.

Another benefactor was Josefita Pérez Jiménez, the daughter of a former Venezuelan dictator, who provided largesse for a seminary in Salamanca, Spain built in 1958 by Maciel. Boarders at Catholic schools were also a focus. According to Roberta Garza, ”They were grooming us for Regnum Christi — the Movement. If your family had money, power, influence, they wanted you. They kept telling me, &#x27;God gave you everything, you must give back by fighting the forces of evil.&#x27;&quot;

The highest level of membership in Maciel&#x27;s Regnum Christi group, lay celibates, &quot;live in communities and work relentlessly on fundraising&quot;.

==Sexual abuse cases==

In 1976, Juan Vaca, a former student of Maciel, who states that Maciel molested him from the age of 12 to 24, wrote a 12-page single-spaced letter to Maciel attacking him for his abuse and the &quot;aberrant and sacrilegious abuse&quot; of 20 other &quot;good and gifted young boys.&quot; Vaca&#x27;s letter was included in a dossier sent by Bishop John Raymond McGann to the Vatican suggesting that it investigate the accusation. &quot;The letter was acknowledged; nothing happened.&quot; In 1978, when John Paul II became pope, the bishop and Vaca wrote again. &quot;But again, nothing happened.&quot;

In 1989, Juan Vaca tried again, sending &quot;a long, detailed letter&quot; to John Paul &quot;in a dossier ... via Vatican diplomatic pouch, again including his original statement naming Maciel&#x27;s victims&quot;. He also asked for release from his vows of ordination arguing &quot;that because of the abuse, he never should have been ordained&quot;. Several years later he was sent a document releasing him, &quot;but on the Maciel charges—again, nothing&quot;.

On February 23, 1997, a report in &quot;The Hartford Courant&quot; &quot;exposed a history of pedophilia&quot; by Maciel involving nine victims who came forward to go on the record. 
The victims alleged that they had been abused as youths and young men by Maciel while studying under him in Spain and Rome in the 1940s and 1950s. The group, which included respectable academics and former priests, lodged formal charges at the Vatican in 1998. They were told the following year that the Congregation of the Doctrine of the Faith, then headed by Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger (later Pope Benedict XVI), was not moving forward with a direct prosecution. Whether Cardinal Ratzinger made this decision on his own or on orders by Pope John Paul II is not publicly known.

The Vatican refused to comment on the American report, while Maciel claimed innocence but refused to be interviewed. The Legion set up a website accusing the nine of fomenting a &quot;conspiracy&quot; against Maciel. American Roman Catholic luminaries came to the defense of Maciel and the Legion: William Donohue of the Catholic League called the men&#x27;s claims &quot;balderdash&quot;; Father Richard John Neuhaus of &quot;First Things&quot; magazine called the charges false with &quot;a moral certainty&quot;; other defenders included John Paul II biographer and NBC Vatican analyst George Weigel; William Bennett, a former Reagan Education secretary; Mary Ann Glendon, a Harvard Law professor. The allegations were ignored by John Paul II who continued his praise of Maciel.

==Other illicit activities==
===Drug addiction===
During his life, Maciel was the focus of several investigations of his behaviour. There were allegations of drug abuse, for which he was investigated in 1956; he was hospitalized for morphine addiction. He was also investigated for allegedly sexually abusing children. But there was no public notice of his suspension, and he was returned as head of the Congregation.

===Mistresses and children===
In July 2009, a Spanish daily published an interview with a woman who had had a child with Maciel in 1986 and was living in a luxury apartment in Madrid which Maciel had purchased for her. A day later, Mexican media reported that attorney José Bonilla would represent three of a possible total of six of Maciel&#x27;s natural children in a civil lawsuit to recover Maciel&#x27;s estate. The lawyer claimed that Maciel owned several properties in Mexico and around the world in his own name. According to José Bonilla, whose son was attacked by a teacher at one of Maciel&#x27;s schools, Maciel took an adoptive son and a natural son—Omar and Raúl—on trips to Europe, using an assumed name of &quot;Raúl Rivas&quot;. From the ages of 8 and 14 they were molested by him, but &quot;as teenagers they began pushing him off&quot;.

In February 2009, news broke that Maciel had led a double life. Álvaro Corcuera, the General Director, visited each of the Legionary Territories and publicly apologized for Maciel&#x27;s behaviour. Additionally, the Legion has publicly acknowledged that Maciel had fathered a daughter. As a result of all these acknowledgements, Pope Benedict XVI personally intervened and initiated a formal Vatican visitation of all legionary houses.

===Plagiarism===
In 1959 Maciel published a book, &quot;&quot; (&quot;The Psalter of My Days&quot;), which was widely read among members of the Legion and partially translated into English. It was a memoir of experiences of persecution.

On December 11, 2009, the Agencia Católica de Informaciones of Lima, Peru, sister agency of the Catholic News Agency, reported that a Legion of Christ internal memorandum acknowledged, without using the word &quot;plagiarism&quot;, that the book copied the memoir of , a Spanish journalist and Christian Democrat politician. Although the Legion&#x27;s memorandum described Maciel&#x27;s book as &quot;a slight rewriting&quot;, a Spanish legionary familiar with it stated that it copied Lucia&#x27;s memoir &quot;80 percent in style and content.&quot;

Lucia&#x27;s memoir was titled &quot;&quot; (&quot;The Psalter of My Hours&quot;). He completed it in 1941 while a political prisoner of the Francoist Spanish State; it was published posthumously in Spain in 1956; that edition is believed to have been used by Maciel as the basis of his own book.

===Forced retirement===

In January 2005, Maciel was required to step down as head of the order. A few days before John Paul II died, Cardinal Ratzinger announced his intention of removing &quot;filth&quot; from the Church; many believed he was referring specifically to Maciel. After Ratzinger re-opened an investigation, the Vatican requested that Maciel withdraw from active ministry. In January 2006, Maciel stepped down as head of the Legion of Christ and tendered its leadership to long-time follower Álvaro Corcuera. In May 2006, Ratzinger, now as Pope Benedict XVI, disciplined him: the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith ordered Maciel to live &quot;a reserved life of penitence and prayer, relinquishing any form of public ministry&quot;, and published a press communique to that effect. A canonical trial was however ruled out, officially because of his advanced age and poor health, and Maciel was never defrocked.

In 2007, the order was told to cancel the vows of its members to never criticize their superiors, and to inform on any dissent within the order. Maciel moved from Rome to a house he shared with other priests in Jacksonville, Florida, where he died on January 30, 2008, at age 87. He had a private funeral and was buried in his birthplace, Cotija, Michoacán.

Maciel never made any apologies, and continued to deny the allegations. Corcuera apologized to the victims both for Maciel&#x27;s actions and the inaction of others.

In December 2019, the organization accepted responsibility for 175 cases of child sexual abuse by 33 priests, including 60 minors who were abused by Maciel. Former Vatican Secretary of State Angelo Sodano was accused of leading the effort to shield Maciel and other sexually abusive Legion of Christ clergy.

==Later relations with the Vatican==
Investigative journalist Jason Berry wrote in an April 2010 article in the &quot;National Catholic Reporter&quot; that the &quot;charismatic&quot; founder of the Legion of Christ &quot;sent streams of money to Roman curia officials with a calculated end. Maciel was buying support for his group and defence for himself, should his secret life become known.&quot; Based on &quot;former Legion insiders&quot;, Berry reports of large donations, &quot;always in cash&quot; and thus untraceable. &quot;Fine wines and $1,000 Spanish hams&quot; were delivered &quot;to favored officials&quot;. &quot;Pivotal supporter&quot; Cardinal Angelo Sodano benefited from banquets for 200 members of his extended family when he became cardinal and again when he became secretary of State, and $5,000 to $10,000 fees when he gave speeches to the Legion. Stanisław Dziwisz, the &quot;gatekeeper of attendance&quot; to private papal masses, normally admitted &quot;only a few world leaders&quot;, but allowed a family from Mexico to attend when they gave him $50,000. Maciel also &quot;sent $1 million via Dziwisz in advance of a papal trip to Poland.&quot;

Berry and his late colleague Gerald Renner wrote the 2004 book &quot;Vows of Silence: The Abuse of Power in the Papacy of John Paul II&quot;, and the related TV documentary &quot;Vows of Silence&quot; on Maciel and the Legion of Christ. According to Berry, Maciel&#x27;s key supporters, who provided him with a protective shield, included Cardinal Angelo Sodano, Vatican secretary of state (1991–2006) under popes John Paul II and Benedict XVI; Cardinal Eduardo Martínez Somalo, prefect of the Congregation for Institutes of Consecrated Life and Societies of Apostolic Life; and Cardinal Stanislaw Dziwisz, the Polish secretary of John Paul II (1978–2005).

&quot;The New York Times&quot; reported claims that even under Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger, who took an immediate interest in the case, the investigation into Maciel remained stalled. &quot;Other factors delayed a reckoning. Some questioned the accounts of abuse; one of the original nine complainants recanted.&quot;

===Denunciation by the Church===
In March 2009, Pope Benedict XVI ordered an apostolic visitation of the Legionaries of Christ. Five bishops from five different countries, working independently of each other, conducted an extensive investigation which took them to nearly every one of the religious order&#x27;s houses and on March 15, 2010, submitted their report to the Vatican. On March 25, 2010, the Legion of Christ and the Regnum Christ issued a joint statement acknowledging Maciel&#x27;s history of sex abuse and apologized.

On May 1, 2010, after a two-day meeting in Rome with the bishops, the Vatican issued a statement on the report and announced that the Pope would name a delegate to the Legion and a visitator to Regnum Christi, because the &quot;conduct of [Maciel] has given rise to serious consequences in the life and structure of the Legion, such as to require a process of profound re-evaluation.&quot; In its statement the Vatican denounced Maciel for having created a system of power that enabled him to lead an &quot;immoral&quot; double life &quot;devoid of scruples and authentic religious meaning.&quot; The Vatican statement was unusually explicit in its denunciation of Maciel&#x27;s crimes and deception.

The &quot;very serious and objectively immoral acts&quot; of Maciel, which were &quot;confirmed by incontrovertible testimonies&quot;, represented &quot;true crimes and manifest a life without scruples or authentic religious sentiment&quot;, the Vatican said. The Vatican also stated that the Legion created a &quot;mechanism of defense&quot; around Maciel to shield him from accusations and suppress damaging witnesses from reporting abuse. &quot;It made him untouchable&quot;, the Vatican said. The statement decried the &quot;lamentable disgracing and expulsion of those who doubted&quot; Maciel&#x27;s virtue. The Vatican statement did not address whether the Legion&#x27;s leadership would face any sanctions. The Vatican acknowledged the &quot;hardships&quot; faced by Maciel&#x27;s accusers through the years when they were ostracized or ridiculed, and commended their &quot;courage and perseverance to demand the truth.&quot;

<doc id="778138" wikidata="Q250309" url="?curid=778138" title="Battle of Tarawa">
<text>The Battle of Tarawa was fought on 20–23 November 1943 between the United States and Japan on Tarawa Atoll in the Gilbert Islands, and was part of Operation Galvanic, the U.S. invasion of the Gilberts. Nearly 6,400 Japanese, Koreans, and Americans died during the battle, mostly on and around the small island of Betio, in the extreme southwest of Tarawa Atoll. At the time, Betio was only .

The Battle of Tarawa was the first American offensive in the critical Central Pacific region. It was also the first time in the Pacific War that the United States faced serious Japanese opposition to an amphibious landing. Previous landings had met little to no initial resistance, but on Tarawa the 4,500 Japanese defenders were well supplied and well prepared, and they fought almost to the last man, exacting a heavy toll on the United States Marine Corps. The losses on Tarawa were incurred within 76 hours.

== Background ==
=== American strategic decisions ===
To set up forward air bases capable of supporting operations across the Central Pacific, to the Philippines, and toward Japan itself, the U.S. planned to take the Mariana Islands. The Marianas were heavily defended. Naval doctrine of the time held that in order for amphibious landings to succeed, land-based aircraft would be required to weaken defenses and protect the invasion forces on the islands being invaded. The nearest islands capable of supporting such an American effort on the Marianas were the Marshall Islands. Taking the Marshalls would provide the base needed to launch an offensive on the Marianas, but the Marshalls were cut off from direct communications with Hawaii by a Japanese garrison and air base on the small island of Betio, on the western side of the atoll of Tarawa in the Gilbert Islands. Thus, in order to eventually launch an invasion of the Marianas, American strategists believed that the Japanese garrison and airfield on Tarawa would first need to be neutralized.

Following the completion of the Guadalcanal campaign, the 2nd Marine Division had been withdrawn to New Zealand for rest and recuperation. Losses were replaced, and the men were given a chance to recover from malaria and other illnesses that had weakened them during the fighting in the Solomons. On 20 July 1943, the Joint Chiefs of Staff directed Admiral Chester W. Nimitz to prepare plans for an offensive operation in the Gilbert Islands. In August, Admiral Raymond A. Spruance flew to New Zealand to meet with the new commander of the 2nd Marine Division, General Julian C. Smith, and initiate the planning of the invasion with the division&#x27;s commanders.

=== Japanese preparations ===

Located about southwest of Pearl Harbor, Betio is the largest island in the Tarawa Atoll. The small, flat island lies at the southernmost reach of the lagoon and was the base of the majority of the Japanese troops. Shaped roughly like a long, thin triangle, the tiny island is approximately long. It is narrow, being only wide at its widest point. A long pier was constructed jutting out from the north shore, onto which cargo ships could unload while anchored beyond the -wide shallow reef which surrounded the island. The northern coast of the island faces into the lagoon, while the southern and western sides face the deep waters of the open ocean.

Following Colonel Evans Carlson&#x27;s diversionary raid on Makin Island in August 1942, the Japanese command was made aware of the vulnerability and strategic significance of the Gilbert Islands. The 6th Yokosuka Special Naval Landing Force reinforced the island in February 1943. In command was Rear Admiral Tomonari Saichirō (友成 佐市郎), an experienced engineer who directed the construction of the sophisticated defensive structures on Betio. Upon their arrival, the 6th Yokosuka became a garrison force, and the unit&#x27;s identification was changed to the 3rd Special Base Defense Force. Tomonari&#x27;s primary goal in the Japanese defensive scheme was to stop the attackers in the water or pin them on the beaches. A tremendous number of pillboxes and firing pits were constructed, with excellent fields of fire over the water and sandy shore. In the interior of the island was the command post and several large shelters designed to protect defenders from air attack and bombardment. The island&#x27;s defenses were not set up for a battle in depth across the interior. The interior structures were large and vented but did not have firing ports. Defenders were limited to firing from the doorways.

The Japanese worked intensively for nearly a year to fortify the island. To aid the garrison in the construction of the defenses, the 1,247 men of the 111th Pioneers, similar to the Seabees of the U.S. Navy, along with the 970 men of the Fourth Fleet&#x27;s construction battalion, were brought in. Approximately 1,200 of the men in these two groups were Korean laborers.

The garrison was made up of forces of the Imperial Japanese Navy. The Special Naval Landing Force was the marine component of the IJN and were known by U.S. intelligence to be more highly trained, better disciplined, more tenacious and to have better small unit leadership than comparable units of the Imperial Japanese Army. The 3rd Special Base Defense Force assigned to Tarawa had a strength of 1,112 men. They were reinforced by the 7th Sasebo Special Naval Landing Force, with a strength of 1,497 men. It was commanded by Commander Takeo Sugai. This unit was bolstered by 14 Type 95 light tanks under the command of Ensign Ohtani.

A series of 14 coastal defense guns, including four large Vickers 8-inch guns purchased during the Russo-Japanese War from the British, were secured in concrete bunkers around the island to guard the open water approaches. It was thought these big guns would make it very difficult for a landing force to enter the lagoon and attack the island from the north side. The island had 500 pillboxes or &quot;stockades&quot; built from logs and sand, many of which were reinforced with cement. Forty artillery pieces were scattered around the island in various reinforced firing pits. An airfield was cut into the bush straight down the center of the island. Trenches connected all points of the island, allowing troops to move under cover when necessary to wherever they were needed. As the command believed their coastal guns would protect the approaches into the lagoon, an attack on the island was anticipated to come from the open waters of the western or southern beaches. Rear Admiral Keiji Shibazaki, an experienced combat officer from the campaigns in China, relieved Tomonari on 20 July 1943 in anticipation of the coming fight. Shibazaki continued the defensive preparations right up to the day of the invasion. He encouraged his troops, saying &quot;it would take one million men one hundred years&quot; to conquer Tarawa.

== Battle ==

=== 20 November ===

The American invasion force to the Gilberts was the largest yet assembled for a single operation in the Pacific, consisting of 17 aircraft carriers (6 fleet aircraft carriers, 5 light aircraft carriers, and 6 escort carriers), 12 battleships, 8 heavy cruisers, 4 light cruisers, 66 destroyers, and 36 transport ships. On board the transports were the 2nd Marine Division and the Army&#x27;s 27th Infantry Division, for a total of about 35,000 troops.
As the invasion flotilla hove to in the predawn hours, the island&#x27;s four 8-inch guns opened fire. A gunnery duel developed as the main batteries on the battleships and commenced counter-battery fire. This proved effective, with several of the 16-inch shells finding their marks. One shell penetrated the ammunition storage for one of the guns, setting off a huge explosion as the ordnance went up in a massive fireball. Three of the four guns were knocked out in short order. One continued its intermittent, though inaccurate, fire through the second day. The damage to the big guns left the approach to the lagoon open.

Following the gunnery duel and an air attack of the island at 06:10, the naval bombardment of the island began in earnest and was sustained for the next three hours. At least 40% of defenders were killed during the naval bombardment before H-hour. Two minesweepers, with two destroyers to provide covering fire, entered the lagoon in the pre-dawn hours and cleared the shallows of mines. A guide light from one of the minesweepers then guided the landing craft into the lagoon, where they awaited the end of the bombardment. The plan was to land Marines on the north beaches, divided into three sections: Red Beach 1 on the far west of the island, Red Beach 2 in the center just west of the pier, and Red Beach 3 to the east of the pier. Green Beach was a contingency landing beach on the western shoreline and was used for landings on 21 November. Black Beaches 1 and 2 made up the southern shore of the island and were not used. The airstrip, running roughly east–west, divided the island into north and south.

Marine Corps battle planners had expected the normal rising tide to provide a water depth of over the reef, allowing their draft Higgins boats room to spare. However, on this day and the next, the ocean experienced a neap tide and failed to rise. In the words of some observers, &quot;the ocean just sat there&quot;, leaving a mean depth of over the reef. A New Zealand Army liaison officer, Major Frank Holland, had 15 years&#x27; experience on Tarawa and warned that there would be at most 3 feet depth. Shoup warned his Marines that there would be a 50–50 chance that they would need to wade ashore, but the attack was not delayed until more favorable spring tides.

The supporting naval bombardment lifted, and the Marines started their attack from the lagoon at 09:00, thirty minutes later than expected, but found the tide had not risen enough to allow their shallow draft Higgins boats to clear the reef. Only the tracked LVT &quot;Alligators&quot; were able to get across. With the pause in the naval bombardment, those Japanese who had survived the shelling were again able to man their firing pits. Japanese troops from the southern beaches were shifted up to the northern beaches. As the LVTs made their way over the reef and into the shallows, the number of Japanese troops in the firing pits slowly began to increase, and the volume of combined arms fire the LVTs faced gradually intensified. The LVTs had holes punched through their non-armored hulls, and many were knocked out of the battle. Those LVTs that did make it in proved unable to clear the sea wall, leaving the men in the first assault waves pinned down against the log wall along the beach. Several LVTs went back out to the reef in an attempt to carry in the men who were stuck there, but most of these were too badly holed to remain seaworthy, leaving the Marines stuck on the reef some off shore. Half of the LVTs were knocked out of action by the end of the first day.

Colonel David M. Shoup, commander of the 2nd Marine Regiment, was the senior officer of the landed forces, and he assumed command of all landed Marines upon getting ashore. Although wounded by an exploding shell soon after landing at the pier, Shoup had the pier cleared of Japanese snipers and rallied the first wave of Marines who had become pinned down behind the limited protection of the sea wall. Over the next two days, working without rest and under constant withering enemy fire, he directed attacks against strongly defended Japanese positions, pushing forward despite daunting defensive obstructions and heavy fire. Throughout, Shoup was repeatedly exposed to Japanese small arms and artillery fire, inspiring the forces under his command. For his actions on Betio, he was awarded the Medal of Honor.
Early attempts to land tanks for close support and to get past the sea wall failed when the LCM landing craft (LCM) carrying them hung up behind the reef. Some of these craft were hit out in the lagoon while they waited to move in to the beach and either sank outright or had to withdraw while taking on water. Two Stuart tanks were landed on the east end of the beach but were knocked out of action fairly quickly. The battalion commander of 3rd Battalion, 2nd Regiment found several LCMs near the reef and ordered them to land their Sherman tanks and head to Red Beach 2. The LCMs dropped ramps and the six tanks came down, climbed over the reef and dropped into the surf beyond. They were guided in to shore by Marines on foot, but several of these tanks fell into holes caused by the naval gunfire bombardment and sank. The surviving Shermans on the western end of the island proved considerably more effective than the lighter Stuarts. They helped push the line in to about from shore. One became stuck in a tank trap, and another was knocked out by a magnetic mine. The remaining tank took a shell hit to its barrel and had its 75 mm gun disabled. It was used as a portable machine gun pillbox for the rest of the day. A third platoon was able to land all four of its tanks on Red 3 around noon and operated them successfully for much of the day, but by day&#x27;s end only one tank was still in action.

By noon the Marines had successfully taken the beach as far as the first line of Japanese defenses. By 15:30 the line had moved inland in places but was still generally along the first line of defenses. The arrival of the tanks started the line moving on Red 3 and the end of Red 2 (the right flank, as viewed from the north), and by nightfall the line was about half-way across the island, only a short distance from the main runway.

Major Michael P. Ryan, a company commander, had gathered together remnants of his company with Marines and sailors from other landing waves, as well as two Sherman tanks, and had diverted them to a more lightly defended section of Green Beach. This impromptu unit was later referred to as &quot;Ryan&#x27;s Orphans&quot;. Ryan, who had been thought to be dead, arranged for naval gunfire and mounted an attack that cleared the island&#x27;s western end.
The communication lines that the Japanese installed on the island had been laid shallow and were destroyed in the naval bombardment, effectively preventing commander Keiji Shibazaki from exercising direct control of his troops. In mid-afternoon, he and his staff abandoned the command post at the northeast end of the airfield to allow it to be used to shelter and care for the wounded, and he prepared to move to the south side of the island. He had ordered two of his Type 95 light tanks to act as protective cover for the move, but a 5-inch naval artillery shell exploded in the midst of his headquarters personnel as they were assembled outside the central concrete command post, killing the commander and most of his staff. This loss further complicated Japanese command problems.

As night fell on the first day, the Japanese defenders kept up sporadic harassing fire but did not launch an attack on the Marines clinging to their beachhead and the territory won in the day&#x27;s hard fighting. With Shibazaki killed and their communication lines torn up, each Japanese unit had been acting in isolation since the start of the naval bombardment. The Marines brought a battery of 75 mm pack howitzers ashore, unpacked them and set them up for action for the next day&#x27;s fight, but most of the second wave was unable to land. They spent the night floating in the lagoon without food or water, trying to sleep in their Higgins boats.

During the night, some Japanese marines swam to some of the wrecked LVTs in the lagoon, and to the &quot;Saida Maru&quot; (斉田丸), a wrecked Japanese steamship lying west of the main pier. They waited for dawn, when they intended to fire on U.S. forces from behind. Lacking central direction, the Japanese were unable to coordinate for a counterattack against the toehold the Marines held on the island. The feared counterattack never came, and the Marines held their ground. By the end of the first day, of the 5,000 Marines put ashore, 1,500 were casualties, either dead or wounded.

=== 21 November ===

With the Marines holding a thin line on the island, they were commanded to attack Red Beach 2 and 3 and push inward and divide the Japanese defenders into two sections, expanding the bulge near the airfield until it reached the southern shore. Those forces on Red 1 were directed to secure Green Beach for the landing of reinforcements. Green Beach made up the entire western end of the island.

The effort to take Green Beach initially met with heavy resistance. Naval gunfire was called in to reduce the pillboxes and gun emplacements barring the way. Inching their way forward, artillery spotters were able to direct naval gunfire directly upon the machine gun posts and remaining strong points. With the major obstacles reduced, the Marines were able to take the positions in about an hour of combat with relatively few losses.

Operations along Red 2 and Red 3 were considerably more difficult. During the night the defenders had set up several new machine gun posts between the closest approach of the forces from the two beaches, and fire from those machine gun nests cut off the Marines from each other for some time. By noon the Marines had brought up their own heavy machine guns, and the Japanese posts were put out of action. By the early afternoon they had crossed the airstrip and had occupied abandoned defensive works on the south side.

Around 12:30 a message arrived that some of the defenders were making their way across the sandbars from the extreme eastern end of the islet to Bairiki, the next islet over. Portions of the 6th Marine Regiment were ordered to land on Bairiki to seal off the retreat path. They formed up, including tanks and pack artillery, and were able to start their landings at 16:55. They received machine gun fire, so aircraft were sent in to try to locate the guns and suppress them. The force landed with no further fire, and it was later found that only a single pillbox with 12 machine guns had been set up by the forces that had been assumed to be escaping. They had a small tank of gasoline in their pillbox, and when it was hit with fire from the aircraft the entire force was burned. Later, other units of the 6th Marine Regiment were landed unopposed on Green Beach, north (near Red Beach 1).

By the end of the day, the entire western end of the island was in U.S. control, as well as a fairly continuous line between Red 2 and Red 3 around the airfield aprons. A separate group had moved across the airfield and set up a perimeter on the southern side, up against Black 2. The groups were not in contact with each other, with a gap of over between the forces at Red 1/Green and Red 2, and the lines on the northern side inland from Red 2/Red 3 were not continuous.

=== 22 November ===
The third day of battle consisted primarily of consolidating existing lines along Red 1 and 2, an eastward thrust from the wharf, and moving additional heavy equipment and tanks ashore onto Green Beach at 08:00. During the morning the forces originally landed on Red 1 made some progress towards Red 2 but took casualties. Meanwhile, the 6th Marines which had landed on Green Beach to the south of Red 1 formed up while the remaining battalion of the 6th landed.

By the afternoon the 1st Battalion, 6th Marines (1/6) were sufficiently organized and equipped to take to the offensive. At 12:30 they pressed the Japanese forces across the southern coast of the island. By late afternoon they had reached the eastern end of the airfield and had formed a continuous line with the forces that landed on Red 3 two days earlier. By the evening the remaining Japanese forces were either pushed back into the tiny amount of land to the east of the airstrip, or operating in several isolated pockets near Red 1/Red 2 and near the western edge of the airstrip.

That night the Japanese forces formed up for a counterattack, which started at about 19:30. Small units were sent in to infiltrate the U.S. lines in preparation for a full-scale assault. The assembling forces were broken up by concentrated artillery fire, and the assault never took place.

=== 23 November ===
A large banzai charge was made at 03:00 and met with some success, killing 45 Americans and wounding 128. With support from the destroyers and , the Marines killed 325 Japanese attackers. At 04:00 the Japanese attacked Major Jones&#x27; 1st Battalion, 6th Marines in force. Roughly 300 Japanese troops launched a banzai charge into the lines of A and B Companies. Receiving support from 1st Battalion, 10th Marines&#x27; 75mm pack howitzers and the destroyers &quot;Schroeder&quot; and &quot;Sigsbee&quot;, the Marines were able to beat back the attack but only after calling artillery to within 75 meters of their own lines. When the assault ended about an hour later there were 200 dead Japanese soldiers in the Marine front lines and another 125 beyond their lines.

At 07:00 Navy fighters and dive bombers started softening up the Japanese positions on the eastern tip of the island. After 30 minutes of air attack the pack howitzers of 1/10 opened up on the Japanese positions. Fifteen minutes later the Navy kicked off the last part of the bombardment with a further 15 minutes of shelling. At 08:00 3rd Battalion, 6th Marines (3/6) under the command of Lieutenant Colonel McLeod attacked, Jones&#x27; 1/6 having been pulled off the line after suffering 45 killed and 128 wounded in the previous night&#x27;s fighting. Due to the narrowing nature of the island, I and L Companies of 3/6 formed the entire Marine front with K Company in reserve. The Marines advanced quickly against the few Japanese left alive on the eastern tip of Betio. They had two Sherman tanks named Colorado and China Gal, 5 light tanks in support and engineers in direct support.
I and L Companies advanced before experiencing any serious resistance in the form of connected bunkers on I Company&#x27;s front. McLeod ordered L Company to continue their advance, thereby bypassing the Japanese position. At this point L Company made up the entire front across the now wide island, while I Company reduced the Japanese strong point with the support of the tank Colorado and attached demolition/flame thrower teams provided by the engineers. As I Company closed in, the Japanese broke from cover and attempted to retreat down a narrow defile. Alerted to the attempted retreat, the commander of the Colorado tank fired in enfilade at the line of fleeing soldiers. The near total destruction of the Japanese soldiers&#x27; bodies made it impossible to know how many men were killed by this single shot, but it was estimated that 50 to 75 men perished. While L Company advanced down the eastern end of the island, Major Schoettel&#x27;s 3rd Battalion, 2nd Marines (3/2) and Major Hay&#x27;s 1st Battalion, 8th Marines (1/8) were cleaning out the Japanese pocket that still existed between beaches Red 1 and Red 2. This pocket had been resisting the advance of the Marines landing on Red 1 and Red 2 since D-day, and they had not yet been able to move against it.

1/8 advanced on the pocket from the east (Red 2) while 3/2 advanced from the west (Red 1). Major Hewitt Adams led an infantry platoon supported by two pack howitzers from the lagoon into the Japanese positions to complete the encirclement. By noon the pocket had been reduced. On the eastern end of the island L Company continued to advance, bypassing pockets of resistance and leaving them to be cleared out by tanks, engineers and air support. By 13:00 they had reached the eastern tip of Betio. 3/6 killed roughly 475 Japanese soldiers on the morning of 23 November while losing 9 killed and 25 wounded. Back at the Red 1/Red 2 pocket there was no accurate count of Japanese dead. There were an estimated 1,000 Japanese alive and fighting on the night of 22 November, 500 on the morning of 23 November and only 50–100 left when the island was declared secure at 13:30 on 23 November.

== Aftermath ==

For the next several days the 2nd Battalion, 6th Marines moved up through the remaining islands in the atoll and cleared the area of Japanese, completing this on 28 November. The 2nd Marine Division started shipping out soon after and were completely withdrawn by early 1944.

Of the 3,636 Japanese in the garrison, only one officer and sixteen enlisted men survived. Of the 1,200 Korean laborers brought to Tarawa to construct the defenses, only 129 survived. All told, 4,690 of the island&#x27;s defenders were killed. The 2nd Marine Division suffered 894 killed in action, 48 officers and 846 enlisted men, while an additional 84 wounded later succumbed, 8 officers and 76 enlisted men. A further 2,188 men were wounded in the battle, 102 officers and 2,086 men. Of the roughly 12,000 2nd Marine Division Marines on Tarawa, 3,166 officers and men became casualties. Nearly all of these casualties were suffered in the 76 hours between the landing at 09:10 on 20 November and the island of Betio being declared secure at 13:30 23 November.
The heavy casualties suffered by the United States at Tarawa sparked public protest, where headline reports of the high losses could not be understood for such a small and seemingly unimportant island. The public reaction was aggravated by the unguardedly frank comments of some of the Marine Corps command. General Holland Smith, commander of the V Amphibious Corps who had toured the beaches after the battle, likened the losses to Pickett&#x27;s Charge at Gettysburg. Admiral Chester Nimitz was inundated with angry letters from families of men killed on the island.

Back in Washington, newly appointed Marine Corps Commandant Alexander Vandegrift, the widely respected and highly decorated veteran of Guadalcanal, reassured Congress, pointing out that &quot;Tarawa was an assault from beginning to end&quot;. A &quot;New York Times&quot; editorial on 27 December 1943 praised the Marines for overcoming Tarawa&#x27;s rugged defenses and fanatical garrison and warned that future assaults in the Marshalls might well result in heavier losses. &quot;We must steel ourselves now to pay that price.&quot;

Writing after the war, Smith, who in his biography was highly critical of the Navy, commented:

Some commanders involved, including Nimitz, Admiral Raymond A. Spruance, Lieutenant General Julian C. Smith and Lieutenant Colonel David M. Shoup, disagreed with General Smith. Said Nimitz:
Nimitz launched the Marshalls campaign ten weeks after the seizure of Tarawa. Aircraft flown from airfields at Betio and Abemama proved highly valuable.

All told, nearly 6,400 Japanese, Koreans and Americans died on the tiny island in 76 hours of fighting. In the aftermath of the battle, American casualties lined the beach and floated in the surf. Staff Sergeant Norman Hatch and other Marine cameramen were present obtaining footage that would later be used in a documentary. &quot;With the Marines at Tarawa&quot; contained scenes of American dead so disturbing that the decision of whether to release it to the public was deferred to President Franklin D. Roosevelt, who approved it.

Following the battle, the 2nd Marine Division was shipped to Hawaii, leaving the 2nd Battalion, 6th Marine Regiment behind to clear the battlefield of ordnance, provide security for the Seabees rebuilding the airstrip and aid in the burial detail. The 2nd Marine Division remained in Hawaii for six months, refitting and training, until called upon for its next major amphibious landing, the Battle of Saipan in the Marianas in June 1944.

===Lessons===

The greater significance of the action on Tarawa to the success in the Marshalls proved to be the lessons learned from the battle. It had been the first time in the war that a United States amphibious landing was opposed by well entrenched, determined defenders. Previous landings, such as at Guadalcanal, had been unexpected and met with little or no initial resistance. At the time, Tarawa was the most heavily defended atoll invaded by Allied forces in the Pacific.

The American casualties at Tarawa resulted from several contributing factors, among which were the miscalculation of the tide and the height of the obstructing coral reefs, the operational shortcomings of the landing craft available, the inability of the naval bombardment to weaken the defenses of a well entrenched enemy, and the difficulties of coordinating and communicating between the different military branches involved.

Navy battleships and cruisers had fired some three thousand shells into Tarawa in the three hours before the landings. &quot;This was by far the heaviest bombardment of an invasion beach ever delivered up to that time. Yet it proved inadequate. ... The high explosive shells employed by the bombarding ships usually went off before penetrating the Japanese defensive works (thus) doing little real damage.&quot; For the subsequent Marshalls campaign, the naval bombardments took a month and included the use of armor-piercing shells, while the landing craft also had armor.

The failures of the Tarawa landing were a major factor in the founding of the Underwater Demolition Teams (UDT) - the precursor of the current U.S. Navy SEALS. After Tarawa, &quot;the need for the UDT in the South Pacific became glaringly clear&quot;. The &quot;landing on Tarawa Atoll emphasized the need for hydrographic reconnaissance and underwater demolition of obstacles prior to any amphibious landing&quot;. &quot;After the Tarawa landing, Rear Admiral Richmond K. Turner directed the formation of nine Underwater Demolition Teams. Thirty officers and 150 enlisted men were moved to the Waimānalo Amphibious Training Base to form the nucleus of a demolition training program. This group became UDT ONE and UDT TWO.&quot;

War Correspondent Robert Sherrod wrote:

Over one hundred of the Americans killed were never repatriated. In November 2013, the remains of one American and four Japanese were recovered from &quot;what was considered a pristine site preserving actual battlefield conditions and all remains found as they fell.&quot; The remains of 36 Marines, including 1st Lieutenant Alexander Bonnyman Jr., were interred in a battlefield cemetery whose location was lost by the end of the war. The cemetery was located in March 2015. On 26 July 2015, the bodies were repatriated to the United States, arriving at Joint Base Pearl Harbor–Hickam, Hawaii. In March, 2019 a mass grave of Marines, reportedly from the 6th Marine Regiment, was discovered on Tarawa. The remains of 22 Marines recovered from the mass grave arrived at the Joint Base Pearl Harbor-Hickam, Hawaii on 17 July 2019.

<text>Conagra Brands, Inc. (formerly ConAgra Foods) is an American consumer packaged goods holding company headquartered in Chicago, Illinois. Conagra makes and sells products under various brand names that are available in supermarkets, restaurants, and food service establishments. Based on its 2021 revenue, the company ranked 331st on the 2022 &quot;Fortune&quot; 500.

== History ==
===1919–1949: Founding and early history===
Conagra was founded in September 1919 as Nebraska Consolidated Mills (NCM) by Alva Kinney. The company was a conglomerate of four grain milling companies headquartered in Grand Island, Nebraska. The company moved its headquarters to Omaha, Nebraska, in 1922 following the purchase of Updike Mill. That year, NCM posted a profit of $175,000, its first profit since its founding.
In 1941, the company opened a mill in Decatur, Alabama. It was NCM&#x27;s first plant outside of Nebraska.

===1950–1970: Expansion and decline===

After researching new uses for its flour, NCM funded the establishment of the Duncan Hines brand of cake mixes in 1951 as a way to market more flour. It sold its Duncan Hines assets to Procter &amp; Gamble in 1956. In 1957, NCM built its first mill outside the continental United States, constructing a plant in Puerto Rico. Conagra Brands would reacquire the Duncan Hines brand in 2018 through its acquisition of Pinnacle Foods, which had bought the brand from Procter &amp; Gamble in 1997.

===1971–1999: Rebranding to ConAgra===
NCM changed its name to ConAgra in 1971. The name is a combination of the Latin words &quot;&quot; (&quot;with&quot;) and &quot;&quot; (&quot;soil&quot; or &quot;earth&quot;). It went public and began trading on the NYSE two years later. Losses suffered in 1974 from bad investments and commodities speculation had the company facing bankruptcy. ConAgra hired Pillsbury executive C. Michael Harper to be its chief operating officer in the fall of 1974 and tasked him with stabilizing the company.

Harper began selling what he deemed to be unnecessary buildings and plots of land owned by the company, as well as entire divisions that did not align with ConAgra&#x27;s new direction as a company that primarily dealt with basic food items. By 1976, now chief executive officer Harper, sold 25 assets and reduced the company debt by $35 million. In 1981, ConAgra&#x27;s gross sales topped $1 billion for the first time and Harper was named Chairman.

ConAgra acquired approximately 200 companies over a 20-year period, including Banquet Foods in 1980, Peavey in 1982, Armour and Company in 1983, Monfort in 1987, Lamb Weston in 1988, and Beatrice Foods in 1990. The acquisitions of Monfort and Beatrice made ConAgra the world&#x27;s largest meatpacker and second-largest food processor, respectively. During this time, the company created the Healthy Choice label, to market a line of frozen dinners.

By the mid-1980s, ConAgra was vertically integrated across the food supply chain, selling fertilizer, tires and clothing; with companies for animal and crop harvesting, and for exporting and trading.

ConAgra was found guilty of tampering with scales when measuring the weight of incoming birds from Alabama chicken farmers in 1989 and settled a class action suit in 1995 levied against ConAgra, Hormel Foods, and Delta Pride Catfish for conspiring with other companies to fix the price of catfish. Two years later, ConAgra pleaded guilty in a federal case to spraying water on grain in its Peavey unit, fraudulently increasing the grain&#x27;s weight to boost profits, and bribing federal officials. The company was charged $8.3 million for the case. It also settled a civil suit with farmers in Indiana for $2 million.

During this period, ConAgra was also criticized for some of its business practices, including the demolition of the Jobbers Canyon Historic District to build the company&#x27;s new headquarters, the company&#x27;s use of pesticides, sanitary and labor practices in its meat processing divisions and the pricing of consumer goods. In 1987, Harper threatened to move ConAgra&#x27;s headquarters out of Omaha unless the city approved the demolition of Jobbers Canyon, a warehouse district located along the Missouri River. The district had been declared a historical site and its demolition was opposed by historical preservation groups, but the city ultimately capitulated, razing the district in 1989. As of 1994, it was the largest destruction of a historic site in the United States.

By 1992, ConAgra&#x27;s annual sales had topped $21 billion. The company continued to make acquisitions and launch product lines throughout the 1990s, including Marie Callender&#x27;s frozen product line in 1994 and GoodMark Foods in 1998. Also in 1998, ConAgra acquired several brands from RJR Nabisco, including Egg Beaters and Nabisco&#x27;s table spread unit, which included margarines under the Parkay and Blue Bonnet brands.

=== 2000–2015: From meatpacking to packaged goods ===
ConAgra rebranded as ConAgra Foods in 2000. The first half of the ensuing decade was marked by the sale of the company&#x27;s fresh and refrigerated meat units, beginning with the sale of its majority stake in Swift &amp; Company to Hicks, Muse, Tate &amp; Furst and Booth Creek Management in 2002. The Swift sale ended ConAgra&#x27;s involvement in the fresh beef and pork industries. The same year, ConAgra joined a coalition of food producers and trade associations, including PepsiCo, General Mills, and CropLife International to defeat Oregon Ballot Measure 27, which would have required the labeling of genetically modified food in the state. 

In July 2004, six people were killed in a shooting inside the ConAgra Foods plant in Kansas City, Kansas.

In 2006, the company sold its refrigerated meats divisions, including the Butterball, Eckrich, and Armour brands, to Smithfield Foods for $575 million. The same year, the company closed its Hunt-Wesson operations in Irvine, California, and split the unit between Omaha and Naperville, Illinois.

In 2008, ConAgra purchased Watts Brothers Farms from Don Watts and purchased Ralcorp in 2012. Also in 2012, the company joined with PepsiCo, Nestlé and other food firms to defeat Proposition 37, a California ballot measure which would have mandated the labeling of genetically modified foods. The following year, Conagra joined with Walmart and approximately 20 other companies to seek the establishment of national labeling standards for genetically modified foods. In 2014, ConAgra acquired TaiMei Potato Industry Limited, an Inner Mongolian potato processor. ConAgra sold Ralcorp to TreeHouse Foods for $2.7 billion in 2015 and purchased Blake&#x27;s All Natural Foods the same year. ConAgra spun off Lamb Weston into an independent company in 2016.

During the 2000s and 2010s, ConAgra faced scrutiny for its environmental practices.

On January 7, 2014, a California Superior Court found that ConAgra and its co-defendants were liable in creating a public nuisance due to lead-based paint the companies sold. Ten local governments in California filed the suit and the court ordered Conagra, NL Industries and Sherwin-Williams to pay $1.15 billion to remove or abate the lead in homes located in those cities and counties. ConAgra was named a defendant in the suit as it had assumed the liabilities of W.P. Fuller &amp; Co. following a series of mergers; after multiple appeals, the company reached a settlement amount of $305 million in 2019.

ConAgra also drew attention for its labor and health practices. A company plant in Colorado had been cited numerous times from 1999 to 2002 for violating worker safety. In May 2003, ConAgra and its subsidiary Gilroy Foods agreed to pay $1.5 million to settle charges of hiring discrimination brought by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC). The charges involved a July 1999 Teamsters strike at a Gilroy Foods plant in King City, California, then owned by Basic Vegetable Products LP but later purchased by ConAgra. In August 2001, the company and union negotiated an end to the two-year strike with a new contract, but the recall of workers excluded some workers who were on leave at the time of the purchase including those out due to work injury or pregnancy. Others were denied jobs due to a history of previous injury or illness, despite their having no restrictions on returning to work, according to the EEOC. Also according to the EEOC, most of the 39 workers who were excluded from the recall process had been working at the plant for &quot;10 to 20 years, some even longer,&quot; and were primarily Hispanic and female.

===2016–present: Relocation===
In 2016, ConAgra cut 1,500 jobs, moved its headquarters to Chicago, Illinois, and rebranded as &quot;Conagra Brands&quot;.

On September 22, 2017, Conagra announced that it was acquiring Angie&#x27;s Artisan Treats, maker of Angie&#x27;s Boomchickapop popcorn. The company announced the acquisition was completed on October 23, 2017.

On June 27, 2018, Conagra Brands announced the acquisition of Pinnacle Foods for $8.1 billion. The acquisition closed on October 26, 2018.

On December 8, 2020, Conagra announced that it was selling the Peter Pan brand to Post Holdings. The company announced the transaction was completed on January 25, 2021.

In February 2022, ConAgra paid $18 million to settle a class action from over 8,000 food-processing workers in California who argued that the company had violated California wage law.

Conagra produces a wide array of food products including cooking oil, frozen dinners, hot cocoa, hot dogs and peanut butter.

== Company overview ==
As of 2023, Conagra had 38 manufacturing facilities in the United States and employed approximately 18,600 people. It had net sales of $12.27 billion in fiscal year 2023 . The company is a member of the &quot;Fortune&quot; 500. It is led by president and chief executive officer Sean M. Connolly.

== Partnership with Feeding America ==
The nonprofit ConAgra Foods Foundation has pledged a five-year commitment of $10 million to Feeding America to fight child hunger. Additionally, ConAgra Foods founded the &quot;Child Hunger Ends Here&quot; campaign in 2013 that would donate up to 3 million meals equivalent to Feeding America by donating one meal for each code submitted to the campaign&#x27;s website by consumers.

== Product incidents ==
=== 2002 &quot;E. coli&quot; outbreak ===
Conagra recalled 19 million pounds of ground beef in July 2002 with &quot;E. coli&quot; bacterial contamination. It was the second-largest recall up to that time. That meat was linked to the illnesses of 19 people in six Western and Midwestern states.

=== 2006–2007 &quot;Salmonella&quot; outbreak ===
In February 2007, Conagra recalled jars of Peter Pan and Great Value brand peanut butter with the product code &quot;2111&quot; on the lid, because they were linked to a &quot;Salmonella&quot; outbreak. Ultimately, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) documented more than 628 individuals who were stricken with &quot;Salmonella&quot; poisoning in 47 states that could be traced back to Peter Pan and Great Value peanut butter. Of those, 20% were hospitalized, according to the CDC, which reported no deaths associated with the outbreak.

Since Peter Pan (but not Great Value) is only made at one plant, the recall included all Peter Pan jars sold in the U.S. between May 2006 and February 2007. In May 2015, the company agreed to plead guilty to releasing products tainted with &quot;Salmonella&quot; into interstate commerce. Sentencing was delayed by U.S. District Court Judge Willie Louis Sands, who ordered nationwide newspaper advertisements searching for victims of the outbreak so the government could supply Victim Impact Statements for inclusion in the pre-sentence report.

=== Diacetyl ===
On September 4, 2007, the Flavor and Extract Manufacturers Association recommended reduction of diacetyl in butter-like flavorings, such as those used in popcorn, due to cases of the potentially fatal disease bronchiolitis obliterans or &quot;Popcorn Workers&#x27;s Lung&quot; appearing among plant workers exposed to diacetyl fumes, as well as in one case that involved a popcorn consumer. The next day ConAgra Foods announced that it would soon remove diacetyl from its Jiffy Pop and Orville Redenbacher&#x27;s popcorn products.

=== 2007 &quot;Salmonella&quot; outbreak ===
In October 2007, Conagra asked stores to pull the Banquet and generic brand chicken and turkey pot pies due to 152 cases of &quot;Salmonella&quot; poisoning in 31 states being linked to the consumption of Conagra pot pies, with 20 people hospitalized. At that time, both the USDA and Conagra decided in favor of a consumer advisory and against a recall. ConAgra said the issue stemmed from pies not being cooked thoroughly in older microwaves, and that the package&#x27;s heating instructions would be changed to reflect different microwaves. However, the plant in Marshall, Missouri, where the pot pies were manufactured closed on October 11 as well.

By October 12, a full recall was announced, affecting all varieties of frozen pot pies sold under the brands Banquet, Albertson&#x27;s, Food Lion, Great Value, Hill Country Fare, Kirkwood, Kroger, Meijer, and Western Family. The recalled pot pies included all varieties in 7-oz. single-serving packages bearing the number P-9 or &quot;Est. 1059&quot; printed on the side of the package. By October 14, 174 cases of &quot;Salmonella&quot; poisoning in 32 states were linked to consumption of the contaminated ConAgra pot pies, with 33 people hospitalized. Public interest groups criticized Conagra for the delay in issuing the recall, a decision which Conagra defended by saying the recall was a precaution. At the time of the recall, the USDA had still not identified the source of the &quot;Salmonella&quot; contamination.

On October 17, the Colorado Department of Public Health reported that &quot;An investigation by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and state public health departments involved a large cluster of illnesses caused by &quot;Salmonella&quot; that identified these products&quot; and stated that, &quot;Nationally, at least 211 individuals from 35 states have become ill.&quot; From January 1 through December 31, 2007, the CDC identified a total of 401 cases in 41 states.

<doc id="778226" wikidata="Q5338867" url="?curid=778226" title="Edmond Genet">
<text>Edmond Charles Clinton Genet (November 9, 1896 – April 17, 1917) was the first American flier to die in the First World War after the United States declared war against Germany, shot down by anti-aircraft artillery on April 17, 1917.

Genet had deserted from the US Navy in 1915 to travel to France and fought for over a year with the French Foreign Legion in the trenches of eastern France. After six months of training, he joined the Lafayette Escadrille, a squadron of fighter aircraft that mostly consisted of Americans. Genet was killed less than four months later.

==Early life==
Genet was born in Ossining, New York, on November 9, 1896, to Albert Rivers Genet and Martha Rodman Fox. He was the youngest of three sons and his two brothers served in the military during the First World War. His father was a lawyer and his mother was involved in several organizations including the Daughters of the American Revolution. Genet was the second great-grandson of Edmond-Charles Genêt, the controversial French Ambassador to the United States in 1793. He was educated at Mt. Pleasant Military Academy. When his father died in 1912, he took on several jobs to help his mother with bills, including one at a dairy owned by V. Everit Macy, a government official for the county.

==US Navy==
Genet interviewed to be accepted as a cadet at the US Naval Academy but failed mathematics and was rejected. Genet was encouraged to join the US Navy as it was thought that he would be promoted quickly. Genet joined the US naval militia as an ordinary seaman in 1914 at just 17. Genet was posted to , which was sent to the port city of Veracruz as a result of the Tampico Affair. After three months, &quot;Georgia&quot; left Veracruz and sailed to Port au Prince, Haiti, where Genet heard that war had broken out in Europe. In late December, Genet was given leave of ten days but failed to return as he decided that he would go to France to fight against the Central Powers. He was able to get a visa by giving his age as twenty-one to the French visa official. He was able to secure a passport by lying and saying he was only going to France to inquire about his family&#x27;s estate. Genet kept quiet until he was able to secure the necessary documents but before leaving on SS &quot;Rochambeau&quot;, Genet wrote letters to several of his friends and family that he did not expect to survive this conflict. On January 14, 1915, he wrote to his mother:

I never expect to come back—death seems nearer to me than any possible chances of going through the horrible ghastly conflict which is carousing over Europe without meeting death. I do not fear when I think of it, Mother. I can give my life just as freely for the Tricolor as I can for Old Glory.
:— January 14, 1915.

==World War 1==
===French Foreign Legion===

Genet arrived in Le Havre, France on 29 January. He joined the French Foreign Legion and was sent for training in Lyon, where he became friends with Norman Prince. After months of lobbying, Prince was able to convince the French military to create the Lafayette Escadrille, a squadron of flyers that mostly consisted of Americans, with some French officers. Genet joined a year after its formation. Much to his happiness – as he had trouble with speaking French – he found several fellow Americans within the legion. He quickly became friends with Dr. David E. Wheeler, who had arrived earlier in the winter, becoming a Red Cross volunteer. He decided to join the Legion around the same time as Genet. The two served together until Wheeler was wounded in September 1915.

After six weeks of training, Genet was sent to the front in eastern France. Genet spent the next few months in the trenches seeing some action but nothing compared to what he would experience in late September. The Second Battle of Champagne started on September 25 and was the bloodiest battle of the war for the Legion. On 28 September, Genet&#x27;s battalion attacked, losing their senior officers within moments of the attack. Genet found himself at front of the attack with only one other legionary. Realizing that the advance had been stopped, they decided to retreat back to their trench. The other legionary was wounded or possibly killed on the way back. Genet was one of the 31 men out of 500 who survived the battle unscathed. The battle saw French casualties near 190,000 in just three weeks of fighting.

Later, Genet was back fighting in the Bois Sabot; the rest of the company took shelter during an artillery barrage. A unit of Senegalese Tirailleurs took up the charge and Genet went with them. Genet was separated from his unit for three days, it was feared that he had been killed in the fighting and his death was reported in several papers. Other papers only reported him missing. Genet was proud of being an American, sought the company of his countrymen and for a while flew the Stars and Stripes on top of his tent. In many of his letters home, he wrote about his love for his country. He wrote of his excitement about the upcoming July 4 celebrations.

===Lafayette Escadrille===

Genet finally got his wish of flying. After a year in the Legion and over eight months of applying, he was accepted to aviation school to become a pilot. He started school on 5 June 1916 and completed his training on 17 January 1917. During this time he promoted to corporal. He joined the Lafayette Escadrille on 22 January 1917. Within a few days, Genet received his own Nieuport 21 fighter to use on his first mission on 29 January. He was promoted to sergeant on 10 March, after completing over 20 sorties. Genet was with the last American flyer to be killed before America entered the war. On 19 March, Genet and James Rogers McConnell were flying over enemy lines near Verdun when they encountered two German aircraft. They each attacked an aircraft and both pilots became separated. Genet was wounded by a bullet that hit his cheek and his plane was badly damaged. McConnell&#x27;s body and his aircraft were found a few days later by advancing French soldiers. Genet received the Croix de Guerre for this action. Genet was a talented drawer and painter, covering the Escadrille mess hall with his scenes of aerial combat. One wall was filled with the Indian head that became a symbol of the Escadrille.

==Death==

Genet died on 17 April 1917 in France; he was 20 years old and had flown 37 sorties. On 16 April, he had flown a mission in the morning and came back feeling ill. He had been encouraged not to fly again that day as was scheduled but he was insistent and took off at 12:45pm. Genet and his wingman were to fly towards St Quentin at an altitude of . Gervais Raoul Lufbery, one of the first members of the squadron and an ace pilot, flew as Genet&#x27;s wingman. Because of low-cloud, they descended, which made them a target for anti-aircraft fire. Lufbery saw Genet turn but lost him in the clouds. After Lufbery returned to the base, the squadron received a call that Genet had crashed on a road from the French lines. It was believed that Genet was wounded by the anti-aircraft fire and lost consciousness. Due to the crash, which occurred at full-engine power, his body was so badly damaged that it was unclear if he had been wounded. Since he had been complaining of feeling ill, he might have lost consciousness due to that rather than being wounded.

Genet was buried with full military honors in the military cemetery at Ham, Somme, in a driving snowstorm. His final wish was to be buried wrapped in the French flag and have his coffin be covered with the French and American flags to &quot;show that I died for the two countries&quot;. After the war, Genet, along with many other members of the Lafayette Escadrille were reburied at the La Fayette Escadrille Memorial Cemetery, in Marnes-la-Coquette, outside of Paris. As a result of his lie about his age to the passport officer, his commanding officer Georges Thenault believed that he was four years older than he actually was. In the letter to Genet&#x27;s mother, he expressed shock that Genet was actually 24 years of age as he looked so young. In reality, Genet died at 20 years.

The American entry into World War I took place on 6 April. While Genet was not a member of the US military at the time, he is widely considered to be the first American to be killed after the declaration of war between the US and Germany. 

==Status with the United States Navy==

When Genet left for France in January 1915, he had left the Navy without permission. This decision weighed heavily on him as time wore on, since he could be classified as a deserter. The US was not yet formally in the war and his involvement in the French military was therefore not an official assignment by the US military. While the Navy did not attempt to seek Genet out, he felt unhappy over his absence, fearing the loss of his citizenship. The US was still neutral, being involved in the war might have been considered a treasonous act as it was a direct action in violation of US neutrality.

Throughout his stay in France, Genet, along with other members of the Escadrille, participated in social events hosted by many American supporters of the war who lived in France. He was particularly celebrated, since it was known that he was the descendant of Citizen Genet. As the prospect of American involvement in the war grew, he became increasingly worried and hopeful that his participation in the Escadrille would not be affected by the American entry into the war and sought the help of prominent Americans in France to help him resolve his status. Genet died shortly after the formal entry of the US into the war. Although other Americans had died as part of the Escadrille, he was the first one to do so after the US declaration, which made him the first official American casualty of the war, despite the fact that the US had not yet had time to organize or send any actual troops to Europe. President Woodrow Wilson sent a letter of condolences to Genet&#x27;s mother, as did the French ambassador and the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations committee. The war department posthumously sent his family a letter stating that his service was to be considered in all respects honorable. Josephus Daniels, Secretary of the Navy, wrote:

Edmond Charles Clinton Genet may properly be considered as having honorably terminated an enlistment with an ally, since he died on the field of battle. I, myself, am honored in having the privilege of deciding that the record of Edmond Genet, ordinary seaman, United States Navy, shall be considered in every respect as an honorable one.

== Posthumous collection of letters ==

In 1918, Genet&#x27;s letters from France were collected in a book, edited by Grace Ellery Channing. &quot;War Letters of Edmond Genet: The First American Aviator Killed Flying the Stars and Stripes&quot; was published in June 1918. Author John Jay Chapman wrote the introduction. His son, Victor Chapman, served with Genet before his death in 1916. The letters were written between 1914 and April 1917 and his last letter was written the day before his death. Most of them were addressed to his mother, others were to his brothers or to his Legion friend David Wheeler. The last section of the book was a series of letters written after Genet&#x27;s death, including several from his commanding officers that were addressed to his mother. A few letters of condolences such as the one from President Woodrow Wilson can also be found in the book. Reviews of the book were quite positive.

<doc id="778233" wikidata="Q1326790" url="?curid=778233" title="LCD television">
<text>A liquid-crystal-display television (LCD TV) is a television set that uses a liquid-crystal display to produce images. It is by far the most widely produced and sold type of television display. LCD TVs are thin and light, but have some disadvantages compared to other display types such as high power consumption, poorer contrast ratio, and inferior color gamut.

LCD TVs rose in popularity in the early years of the 21st century, and exceeded sales of cathode-ray-tube televisions worldwide from late 2007 on. Sales of CRT TVs dropped rapidly after that, as did sales of competing technologies such as plasma display panels and rear-projection television.

==History==
===Early efforts===
Passive matrix LCDs first became common as portable computer displays in the 1980s, competing for market share with plasma displays. The LCDs had very slow refresh rates that blurred the screen even with scrolling text, but their light weight and low cost were major benefits. Screens using reflective LCDs required no internal light source, making them particularly well suited to laptop computers. Refresh rates of early devices were too slow to be useful for television. 

Portable televisions were a target application for LCDs. LCDs consumed far less battery power than even the miniature tubes used in portable televisions of the era. In 1980, Hattori Seiko&#x27;s R&amp;D group began development on color LCD pocket televisions. In 1982, Seiko Epson released the first LCD television, the Epson TV Watch, a small wrist-worn active-matrix LCD television. Sharp Corporation introduced the dot matrix TN-LCD in 1983, and Casio introduced its TV-10 portable TV. In 1984, Epson released the ET-10, the first full-color pocket LCD television. That same year Citizen Watch introduced the Citizen Pocket TV, a 2.7-inch color LCD TV, with the first commercial TFT LCD. 

Throughout this period, screen sizes over 30&quot; were rare as these formats would start to appear blocky at normal seating distances when viewed on larger screens. LCD projection systems were generally limited to situations where the image had to be viewed by a larger audience. At the same time, plasma displays could easily offer the performance needed to make a high quality display, but suffered from low brightness and very high power consumption. Still, some experimentation with LCD televisions took place during this period. In 1988, Sharp introduced a 14-inch active-matrix full-color full-motion TFT-LCD. These were offered primarily as high-end items, and were not aimed at the general market. This led to Japan launching an LCD industry, which developed larger-size LCDs, including TFT computer monitors and LCD televisions. Epson developed the 3LCD projection technology in the 1980s, and licensed it for use in projectors in 1988. Epson&#x27;s VPJ-700, released in January 1989, was the world&#x27;s first compact, full-color LCD projector. The first wall-mountable TV used LCD technology and was introduced by Sharp Corporation in 1992.

===Market takeover===
In 2006, LCD prices started to fall rapidly and their screen sizes increased, although plasma televisions maintained a slight edge in picture quality and a price advantage for sets at the critical 42&quot; size and larger. By late 2006, several vendors were offering 42&quot; LCDs, albeit at a premium price, encroaching upon plasma&#x27;s only stronghold. More decisively, LCDs offered higher resolutions and true 1080p support, while plasmas were stuck at 720p, which made up for the price difference.

Predictions that prices for LCDs would rapidly drop through 2007 led to a &quot;wait and see&quot; attitude in the market, and sales of all large-screen televisions stagnated while customers watched to see if this would happen. Plasmas and LCDs reached price parity in 2007, with the LCD&#x27;s higher resolution being a &#x27;winning point&#x27; for many sales. By late 2007, it was clear plasmas would lose out to LCDs during the critical Christmas sales season. This was in spite of plasmas continuing to hold an image quality advantage, but as the president of Chunghwa Picture Tubes noted after shutting down their plasma production line, &quot;(g)lobally, so many companies, so many investments, so many people have been working in this area, on this product. So they can improve so quickly.&quot;

When the sales figures for the 2007 Christmas season were finally tallied, analysts were surprised to find that LCD TVs had outsold both plasma and CRT TVs. This development drove competing large-screen systems from the market almost overnight. Plasma had overtaken rear-projection systems in 2005. The same was true for CRTs, which lasted only a few months longer; Sony shut down the final plant in March 2008. The February 2009 announcement that Pioneer Electronics was ending production of the plasma screens was widely considered the tipping point in that technology&#x27;s history as well.

LCD&#x27;s dominance in the television market accelerated rapidly. It was the only technology that could scale both up and down in size, covering both the high-end market for large screens in the 40 to 50&quot; class, as well as customers looking to replace their existing smaller CRT sets in the 14 to 30&quot; range. Building across these wide scales quickly pushed the prices down across the board.

In 2008, LCD TV shipments were up 33 percent year-on-year compared to 2007 to 105 million units.
In 2009, LCD TV shipments raised to 146 million units (69% from the total of 211 million TV shipments).
In 2010, LCD TV shipments reached 187.9 million units (from an estimated total of 247 million TV shipments).

Larger size displays continued to be released throughout the decade:
* In October 2004, Sharp announced the successful manufacture of a 65&quot; panel.
* In March 2005, Samsung announced an 82&quot; LCD panel.
* In August 2006, LG.Philips LCD announced a 100&quot; LCD television
* In January 2007, Sharp displayed a 108&quot; LCD panel under the AQUOS brand name at CES in Las Vegas.

===Competing systems===
In spite of LCD&#x27;s dominance of the television field, other technologies continued to be developed to address its shortcomings. Whereas LCDs produce an image by selectively blocking a backlight, organic LED, microLED, field-emission display and surface-conduction electron-emitter display technologies all produce an illuminated image directly. In comparison to LCDs all of these technologies offer better viewing angles, much higher brightness and contrast ratio (as much as 5,000,000:1), and better color saturation and accuracy. They also use less power, and in theory they are less complex and less expensive to build.

Manufacturing these screens proved to be more difficult than originally thought, however. Sony abandoned their field-emission display project in March 2009, but continued to work on OLED sets. Canon continued development of their surface-conduction electron-emitter display technology, but announced they would not attempt to introduce sets to market for the foreseeable future.

Samsung announced that 14.1 and 31 inch OLED sets were &quot;production ready&quot; at the SID 2009 trade show in San Antonio.

<text>Flora (: floras or florae) is all the plant life present in a particular region or time, generally the naturally occurring (indigenous) native plants. The corresponding term for animals is &quot;fauna&quot;, and for fungi, it is &quot;funga&quot;. Sometimes bacteria and fungi are also referred to as flora as in the terms &quot;gut flora&quot; or &quot;skin flora&quot; for purposes of specificity.

==Etymology==
The word &quot;flora&quot; comes from the Latin name of Flora, the goddess of plants, flowers, and fertility in Roman mythology. The technical term &quot;flora&quot; is then derived from a metonymy of this goddess at the end of the sixteenth century. It was first used in poetry to denote the natural vegetation of an area, but soon also assumed the meaning of a work cataloguing such vegetation. Moreover, &quot;Flora&quot; was used to refer to the flowers of an artificial garden in the seventeenth century.

The distinction between vegetation (the general appearance of a community) and flora (the taxonomic composition of a community) was first made by Jules Thurmann (1849). Prior to this, the two terms were used interchangeably.

==Classifications==

Plants are grouped into floras based on region (floristic regions), period, special environment, or climate. Regions can be distinct habitats like mountain vs. flatland. Floras can mean plant life of a historic era as in &quot;fossil flora&quot;. Lastly, floras may be subdivided by special environments:

*&quot;Native flora&quot;. The native and indigenous flora of an area.
*&quot;Agricultural and horticultural flora (garden flora)&quot;. The plants that are deliberately grown by humans.
*&quot;Weed flora&quot;. Traditionally this classification was applied to plants regarded as undesirable and studied in efforts to control or eradicate them. Today the designation is less often used as a classification of plant life since it includes three different types of plants: weedy species, invasive species (that may or may not be weedy), and native and introduced non-weedy species that are agriculturally undesirable. Many native plants previously considered weeds have been shown to be beneficial or even necessary to various ecosystems.

==Documentation==


The flora of a particular area or time period can be documented in a publication also known as a &quot;flora&quot; (often capitalized as &quot;Flora&quot; to distinguish the two meanings when they might be confused). Floras may require specialist botanical knowledge to use with any effectiveness. Traditionally they are books, but some are now published on CD-ROM or websites.

Simon Paulli&#x27;s &quot;Flora Danica&quot; of 1648 is probably the first book titled &quot;Flora&quot; to refer to the plant world of a certain region. It mainly describes medicinal plants growing in Denmark. The &quot;Flora Sinensis&quot; by the Polish Jesuit Michał Boym is another early example of a book titled &quot;Flora&quot;. However, despite its title it covered not only plants but also some animals of the region, that is China and India.

A published flora often contains diagnostic keys. Often these are &quot;dichotomous&quot; keys, which require the user to examine a plant repeatedly, and decide which one of two alternatives given best applies to the plant.

<doc id="778259" wikidata="Q1655671" url="?curid=778259" title="Ian Wilson (author)">
<text>Ian Wilson (born 1941) is a British author of historical and religious books. He has written about such topics as the Shroud of Turin and life after death.

==Life==
Wilson was born in Clapham, south London, during World War II. Neither of his parents was religious. His school was nominally Church of England, but during scripture classes he was always, as he put it, &quot;the number one sceptic&quot;. He graduated in Modern History from Magdalen College, Oxford in 1963.

Wilson is best known for his writings on Shroud of Turin. He first came across the Shroud during the 1950s when he was in his mid-teens in an illustrated article by World War II hero Group Captain Leonard Cheshire. It was the image on the negative of the Shroud that dealt the first blow to his agnosticism. In 1972 he converted to Catholicism. Classical historian Charles Freeman, writing in &quot;Free Inquiry&quot;, heavily criticized Wilson&#x27;s writings on the subject.

He participated in Channel 4&#x27;s three part TV series &quot;&quot; (1984) and wrote the accompanying book of the same name. The series proved to be highly controversial and sparked a national furore, marking a significant moment in the changing fortunes of religious broadcasting in the UK.

He lived in Bristol, England, for twenty-six years and resides in Brisbane, Australia, with his wife, Judith. They have two sons.

<text>Deloraine is a town on the Meander River, in the central north of Tasmania, Australia. It is 50 km west of Launceston and 52 km south of Devonport along the Bass Highway. It is part of the Meander Valley Council. Deloraine recorded a population of 3,035 in the . Deloraine, like most Tasmanian towns, has a temperate and wet climate.

==History==
The region was explored in 1821 by Captain Roland, who was searching for farm land. The land was granted to new settlers, and the town is now a major agricultural centre, with a large number of farms of all types in the area. Deloraine is named after a character from the poem &quot;The Lay of the Last Minstrel&quot;, written by Sir Walter Scott.
Deloraine Post Office opened on 29 October 1836.

The town won the State Tidy Towns award in 1992, 1993 and 1995, and the Australian Community of the Year award in 1997.

While Deloraine is a predominantly rural farming town, it is also aimed at pleasing tourists, who visit because of its culture and location also serving as a base to explore areas such as Cradle Mountain, the Great Western Tiers, Mole Creek and the Central Highlands. 
Farms in the area produce poppies, herbs, onions and potatoes; as is typical produce for the Tasmanian climate. Deloraine is also home to the 41° South salmon and ginseng aqua farm.

The town currently operates two sawmills previously owned by Gunns as well as facilities that manufacture fertiliser, farm equipment, water tanks and street signs. The nearby opium processing factory, Tasmanian Alkaloids, located in Westbury offers some employment for the town.

Deloraine is in the Launceston licence area for television and radio and is served by ABC Television, SBS Television, Tasmanian Digital Television, Southern Cross Tasmania, WIN Television, 91.7 ABC Northern Tasmania and other ABC radio networks, commercial stations 89.3 LAFM and 90.1 Chilli FM and community station 96.9 Meander Valley FM.

The annual Tasmanian Craft Fair takes place in Deloraine, it attracts around 18,000 people annually. During the craft fair, there are around 260 exhibitors demonstrating crafts in the town. Because of this, as well as the large population of artists, the town is considered a cultural centre.

==Infrastructure==
Because of its location between the two cities of Launceston and Devonport, Deloraine is a transport hub for trade and tourists between the two cities. Most local infrastructure and commercial buildings such as supermarkets, shops, schools, bus routes are also used by the nearby town of Westbury, and the hamlets of Exton, Mole Creek and Meander.

The town has a telephone exchange, which is owned and operated by Telstra. Deloraine was one of the first trial towns in Australia to be connected to the fibre optic National Broadband Network (colloquially &#x27;NBN&#x27;). As of 2013, Deloraine has a 40.8% fibre optic connection rate. As of May 23, 2014, Deloraine, along with George Town, Triabunna and Sorell, are the first all-fibre optic towns in Australia.

===Transport===
The Emu Bay/Meander Valley Road passes through the town.

One of the earliest railway lines in Tasmania was built between Launceston and Deloraine in 1871 to ship agricultural products into the city. It was constructed and operated by the private company, Launceston and Western Railway. The railway went bankrupt in 1872 after a mere year of operation and all assets were bought by the Tasmanian Government in 1873.

Access to Deloraine is provided by the Bass Highway, part of Australia&#x27;s National Highway, or by the older Meander Valley Road. Both the Meander River and a railway track that runs through the town from north Devonport through Deloraine and into Launceston and Central Tasmania. The train line is predominantly used for cargo with rare tourist train use.

The town was bypassed by the new Bass Highway in the early 1990s.

===Health and education===
Deloraine is the educational and health centre for the Meander Valley region, location of a library, online access centre, local museum and public and private primary school and a high school. As well as being host to several art galleries.

Deloraine is home to both a hospital/dental clinic and a doctor&#x27;s practice, which are used by both the locals and neighbouring towns and villages.

<text>Karim Dulé Hill (; born May 3, 1975) is an American actor. He is known for his roles as personal presidential aide and Deputy Special Assistant to the Chief of Staff Charlie Young on the NBC drama television series &quot;The West Wing&quot;, for which he received an Emmy nomination for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Drama Series, and pharmaceutical salesman–private detective Burton &quot;Gus&quot; Guster on the USA Network television comedy-drama &quot;Psych&quot;. He also had minor roles in the movies &quot;Holes&quot;, &quot;The Guardian&quot;, and &quot;She&#x27;s All That&quot; and a recurring role on &quot;Ballers&quot;. He joined the cast of &quot;Suits&quot; for the last 2 seasons, and played patriarch Bill Williams in the 2021 remake of &quot;The Wonder Years&quot;. Hill also serves as a member of the SAG-AFTRA Board of Directors.

==Early life==
Hill was born in Orange, New Jersey, to Jamaican parents and was raised in Sayreville, New Jersey. He studied ballet at a young age, and appeared in the musical &quot;The Tap Dance Kid&quot; as Savion Glover&#x27;s understudy on Broadway, a part he subsequently played on the show&#x27;s national tour. Hill graduated from Sayreville War Memorial High School in 1993, and studied business finance at Seton Hall University and acting at William Esper Studio. While at Seton Hall, he accepted a role on Jim Henson&#x27;s &quot;CityKids&quot;.

==Career==

In 1985, 10-year-old Hill performed a tap dance number on the MDA telethon. When the music could not be found for his routine, telethon host Jerry Lewis helped by having the orchestra play another song while Hill performed. His first film role was in &quot;Sugar Hill&quot; in 1993 during his senior year of high school. While in college at Seton Hall, he was cast in a starring role in &quot;Bring in &#x27;da Noise, Bring in &#x27;da Funk&quot; on Broadway.

In 1999, Hill was cast on &quot;The West Wing&quot; as Charlie Young, the personal aide to President Josiah Bartlet, who was played by Martin Sheen. During the sixth season of the series, Charlie became a Special Assistant to the Chief of Staff. Hill starred as Charlie for six seasons before he chose to leave the show at the beginning of the seventh season (September 2005) to star in the pilot for the new television show &quot;Psych&quot; for the USA Network, which premiered July 7, 2006. However, when the announcement was made that &quot;The West Wing&quot; would be ending in May 2006, Hill returned for the show&#x27;s last episodes.

Hill also had roles in the 1999 film &quot;She&#x27;s All That&quot; starring Freddie Prinze Jr. and Rachael Leigh Cook, both of whom he later reunited with on &quot;Psych&quot;, as a Los Angeles doctor named Owen in the movie. He was in the series &quot;10.5&quot;, the Disney movie &quot;Holes&quot; (2003) as Sam the Onion Man (the movie itself was referenced in the &quot;Psych&quot; episode &quot;65 Million Years Off&quot;), and in the 2006 movie &quot;The Guardian&quot; (this was referenced in the &quot;Psych&quot; episode &quot;You Can’t Handle this&quot;). He also joined the cast of &quot;Suits&quot; for Season 8 and 9.

Hill also appeared on Broadway in &quot;Stick Fly&quot; from December 2011 to February 2012 and &quot;After Midnight&quot; in November 2013.

As a voice actor, Hill was part of the cast of the 2021 animated feature &quot;Night of the Animated Dead&quot;.

In the 2024 PBS documentary series, &quot;The Express Way with Dulé Hill,&quot; Hill narrates and participates in exploring art and diverse cultures.

==Personal life==
Hill married actress Nicole Lyn in 2004. They had no children. Hill filed for legal separation from Lyn in 2012 citing irreconcilable differences.

On April 14, 2017, Hill became engaged to girlfriend and &quot;Ballers&quot; co-star Jazmyn Simon. In early 2018, Hill married Simon and later adopted her daughter. In 2019, Hill and his wife announced the birth of their son.

<doc id="778284" wikidata="Q209644" url="?curid=778284" title="Flora (mythology)">
<text>Flora () is a Roman goddess of flowers and spring. She was one of the twelve deities of traditional Roman religion who had their own flamen, the &quot;Floralis&quot;, one of the &quot;flamines minores&quot;. Her association with spring gave her particular importance at the coming of springtime, as did her role as goddess of youth. She is one of several fertility goddesses and a relatively minor figure in Roman mythology. Her Greek counterpart is Chloris.

== Etymology ==
The name &quot;Flōra&quot; descends from Proto-Italic &quot;*flōsā&quot; (&#x27;goddess of flowers&#x27;), itself a derivation from Proto-Italic &quot;*flōs&quot; (&#x27;flower&#x27;; cf. Latin &quot;flōs&quot;, &quot;flōris&quot; &#x27;blossom, flower&#x27;). It is cognate with the Oscan goddess of flowers &quot;Fluusa&quot;, demonstrating that the cult was known more widely among Italic peoples. The name ultimately derives from Proto-Indo-European &quot;*bʰleh₃ōs&quot; (&#x27;blossoming&#x27;).

==Festivals and temples==

Flora&#x27;s festival, the Floralia, was held between April 28 and May 3 and was celebrated with drinking, flowers, and entertainments (&quot;ludi&quot;). The festival was first instituted in 240 BCE, and on the advice of the Sibylline books, she was also given a temple in 238 BCE. At the festival, with the men decked in flowers, and the women wearing normally forbidden gay costumes, five days of farces and mimes were enacted – ithyphallic, and including nudity when called for – followed by a sixth day of the hunting of goats and hares. On May 23 another flower festival was held, the Rosalia.

==&quot;Interpretatio graeca&quot;==
Flora&#x27;s Greek equivalent is the nymph Chloris, whose myths were assimilated to Flora in mythological narratives (&quot;interpretatio graeca&quot;). The Hellenized Flora was married to Favonius, the wind god also known as Zephyr, and her companion was Hercules. According to the legend, Flora ran away from Favonius, but he caught her, married her and gave her dominion over the flowers.

==In the classical tradition==
===Music===
Flora is the main character of the 1894 ballet &quot;The Awakening of Flora&quot;.

===In painting===

===Sculpture===
There are many monuments to Flora, for example in Rome (Italy), Valencia (Spain), and Szczecin (Poland).

<doc id="778294" wikidata="Q6591025" url="?curid=778294" title="List of NC-17 rated films">
<text>NC-17 (No One 17 and Under Admitted) is the highest rating in the Motion Picture Association (MPA) film rating system used for films distributed in the United States. It is assigned to films the MPA believes most parents would consider &quot;patently adult&quot; and not suitable for their children under 18. The rating does not designate films as pornographic or obscene, but simply that the content is suitable only for adults. The rating may be issued because of violence, sex, drugs, or other elements.

The NC-17 rating replaced the X rating in 1990 as the X rating was not trademarked by the MPA and had been co-opted by the pornography industry. NC-17 originally stood for &quot;No Children Under 17 Admitted&quot; to combat the misconception that the rating indicated a film was pornographic. In 1996, the MPA reworded the NC-17 rating to &quot;No One 17 and Under Admitted&quot;, effectively raising the minimum age for admission from 17 to 18.

This list includes films that received—&quot;and were released with&quot;—an NC-17 rating; films that received it but had it rescinded before release are not included. Rescissions occur most often in the form of re-ratings after edits, re-ratings on appeals, or studios surrendering the rating to leave the film unrated. The list provides the reason the rating was given for some films. The MPA began publishing the reasons for R ratings in 1990, and for all film ratings starting in 2000.

<doc id="778299" wikidata="Q1283558" url="?curid=778299" title="Ngāpuhi">
<text>Ngāpuhi (also known as Ngāpuhi-Nui-Tonu or Ngā Puhi) is a Māori iwi associated with the Northland regions of New Zealand centred in the Hokianga, the Bay of Islands, and Whangārei.

According to the 2018 New Zealand census, the estimated population of Ngāpuhi is 165,201. This compares to 125,601 in 2001, 102,981 in 2006, and 122,214 in 2013. It is formed from 150 hapū or subtribes, with 55 marae.

Despite such diversity, the people of Ngāpuhi maintain their shared history and self-identity. Te Rūnanga ā Iwi o Ngāpuhi, based in Kaikohe, administers the iwi. The Rūnanga acts on behalf of the iwi in consultations with the New Zealand government. It also ensures the equitable distribution of benefits from the 1992 fisheries settlement with the government, and undertakes resource management and education initiatives.

==History==

===Origins of Ngāpuhi=== 
Ngāpuhi, like most iwi, trace their pre-history back to the land of Hawaiki, most likely from Raiatea. The name &quot;Ngāpuhi&quot; has many stories about its origin, but the most commonly known version is related to a story of an &quot;ariki&quot; in Hawaiki who lived many generations before Kupe, known as &quot;Kareroaiki&quot;. Whilst pregnant, Kareroariki craved a human heart to eat, and as a woman of high status, her request was fulfilled. After eating the heart of another ariki, Kareroariki went on to give birth to three children, known as &quot;Puhikaiariki&quot;, &quot;Puhimoanaariki&quot;, and &quot;Puhitaniwharau&quot;. The name &quot;Ngāpuhi&quot; is said to be taken from these children - literally, &quot;Ngā Puhi&quot; or &quot;The Puhis&quot;. A common misconception is that the name &quot;Ngāpuhi&quot; comes from Puhi of the waka Mātaatua and maternal grandfather of Rāhiri, however there is little corroborating evidence for this claim.

The &quot;kōrero&quot; (legends/stories) of Ngāpuhi about Kupe&#x27;s arrival to Aotearoa also differ from other iwi accounts. The more common version among other iwi is that Kupe was tasked with chasing down and killing Te Wheke-a-Muturangi, the giant pet octopus of Muturangi. He eventually followed the octopus to Aotearoa, where he cornered it and killed it in the Cook Strait, plucking out its eyes and throwing them, becoming Ngāwhatu (&quot;lit. &quot;The Eyes&quot;&quot;) also known as The Brothers island group. The common Ngāpuhi version, however, states that Kupe fled Hawaiki to escape retribution for attempted murder and adultery. Kūrāmarotini, also known as &quot;Kura&quot; was married to another man, Hoturapa, though she still desired Kupe. Kupe and Kura would meet in secret, with Kura anointing her body with taramea oil so that Kupe could smell the fragrance. As Kura fell out of love with Hoturapa, her and Kupe devised a plan to kill him. Kupe asked Toto, Kuramarotini&#x27;s father, for permission to go out with Hoturapa in a waka to fish and set traps. After Toto agreed, Kupe and Hoturapa set out for the fishing grounds. After Toto let down the anchor, Kupe secretly gave an incantation to ensure the anchor would become ensnared. After they had fished, Kupe asked Hoturapa to pull back up the anchor. With Hoturapa unable to do so due to Kupe&#x27;s incantation, Kupe told him to dive down to investigate as to why it was stuck. After freeing the anchor, Hoturapa rose up from the water only to discover Kupe had gone, leaving him behind to drown. However, as Hoturapa came from a priestly dynasty, he was able to utter karakia to help send him back to shore, where he lived in secret. When Kupe arrived back from his fishing trip, he told the people that Hoturapa had been lost at sea and drowned, and eventually went on to marry Kura. However, news later came back that Hoturapa had actually survived, and Kupe and Kura, fearing that their ruse would be discovered, quickly absconded upon Kupe&#x27;s waka, Matawhaorua, to the island said to have been fished up by Māui, Te-Ika-a-Māui.

After Kupe and Kura&#x27;s journey to Aotearoa, they landed at the Hokianga, where they lived for a time. When they set off to return to Hawaiki, they were never to come back to Aotearoa again. Kupe left his son Tuputupuwhenua at the spring of &quot;Te Puna-o-te-Ao-Mārama&quot;, &quot;(&quot;The Wellspring of the World of Light&quot;)&quot; where he said, &quot;Tuputupuwhenua, hei konei rā. E hoki ana tēnei, e kore rā hau e hoki anga nui mai&quot; (&quot;&quot;Tuputupuwhenua, farewell. I leave you here on my great journey home, and I will not be returning again&quot;)&quot;, thus the name &quot;Te Hokianga-Nui-a-Kupe&quot; (&quot;The Great Return of Kupe&quot;), commonly shortened to &quot;Hokianga&quot;.

Kupe&#x27;s descendant Nukutawhiti also desired to travel and explore the world. He asked Kupe if he could have his waka, Matawhaoarua, and Kupe agreed, gifting Nukutawhiti his waka and giving him advice for his travels. Nukutawhiti, seeing that the waka was riding low in the water, decided to re-adze it in order to lighten it, leading to the renaming of the waka to Ngātokimatawhaorua (&quot;Re-adzed Matawhaorua&quot;). As Nukutawhiti travelled to Aotearoa upon his waka alongside Ruanui, captain of the waka Māmari, he gave a karakia in order to summon storm and winds to quicken his journey, now known to Ngāpuhi and Te Rarawa as &quot;E kau ki te tai e&quot; (&quot;Swim upon the sea&quot;). During his journey, he was accompanied by a number of taniwha, Niniwa (also known as Niwa or Niua), and Āraiteuru being two of these taniwha. Upon Nukutawhiti&#x27;s arrival to the Hokianga, he gave Niniwa and Āraiteuru each a strand of seaweed, and said to both of them &quot;Ka [w]hakakōhatungia kourua e hau hei kaitiaki o te Hokianga&quot; (&quot;You two shall be cast into stone to be caretakers of the Hokianga&quot;), thus the names of the two edges of the mouth of the Hokianga harbour; Niniwa at the northern end, and Āraiteuru at the southern end. Nukutawhiti and his descendants lived at the Hokianga for a number of generations until the birth of his descendant Rāhiri, at which time the iwi Ngāpuhi as it is known today would begin to take shape.

===Foundations===
The main founding ancestor of Ngāpuhi is Rāhiri, the son of Tauramoko and Te Hauangiangi. Tauramoko was a descendant of Kupe, from &quot;Matawhaorua&quot;, and Nukutawhiti, of the &quot;Ngātokimatawhaorua&quot; canoe. Te Hauangiangi was the daughter of Puhi, who captained the &quot;Mataatua&quot; canoe northwards from the Bay of Plenty. Rāhiri was born at Whiria pā, near Opononi in the Hokianga. The early tribes led by Rāhiri&#x27;s descendants lived in the Hokianga, Kaikohe, and Pouerua areas.

Through intermarriage with other iwi and expansionist land migration, the descendants of Rāhiri formed tribes across the Northland peninsula. These actions also fostered ties with neighbouring iwi. Auha and Whakaaria, for example, led expansion eastward from Kaikohe and Pouērua into the Bay of Islands area, overrunning and often intermarrying with Ngāi Tāhuhu, Ngāti Manaia, Te Wahineiti and Ngāti Miru. These tribes in the east were the first to use the name &quot;Ngāpuhi&quot;. As the eastern and western groups merged, the name came to describe all the tribes settled in the Hokianga and Bay of Islands. In the late 1700s and early 1800s, the Ngāpuhi tribes pushed further east through the southern Bay of Islands to the open coast, absorbing tribes such as Ngāti Manu, Te Kapotai, Te Uri o Rata, Ngare Raumati, and Ngātiwai.

===Hosting the first Christian mission ===
Ruatara was chief of the Ngāpuhi from 1812 to his death in 1815. In 1814, he invited the Rev. Samuel Marsden to set up the first ever Christian mission in New Zealand on Ngāpuhi land. The presence of these influential Pākehā secured Ruatara&#x27;s access to European plants, technology and knowledge, which he distributed to other Māori, thus increasing his mana. After the death of Ruatara, his uncle Hongi Hika became protector of the mission.

Thomas Kendall, John King, and William Hall, missionaries of the Church Missionary Society, founded the first mission station in Oihi Bay (a small cove in the north-east of Rangihoua Bay) in the Bay of Islands in 1814 and over the next decades established farms and schools in the area. In 1823 Rev. Henry Williams and his wife Marianne established a mission station at Paihia on land owned by Ana Hamu, the wife of Te Koki. In 1826, Henry&#x27;s brother William and his wife Jane joined the CMS mission at Paihia. Marianne and Jane Williams established schools for the Ngāpuhi. William Williams led the CMS missionaries in the translation of the Bible and other Christian literature; with the first chapters of the Māori Bible being printed at Paihia by William Colenso in 1827. The missionaries did not succeed in converting a single Māori until 1830 when Rawiri Taiwhanga (1818–1874), a Ngāpuhi chief, was baptised. Ruatara and Hongi Hika themselves welcomed the missionaries&#x27; presence, but did not convert. Hōne Heke attended the CMS mission school at Kerikeri and Heke and his wife Ono, were baptised in 1835.

===Musket Wars===

By the early 19th century, the Bay of Islands had become a prominent shipping port in New Zealand. Through increased trade with Europeans, initiated by Ruatara, Ngāpuhi gained greater access to European weapons, including muskets. Armed with European firearms, Ngāpuhi, led by Hongi Hika, launched a series of expansionist campaigns, with resounding slaughters across Northland and in the Waikato and Bay of Plenty.

===United Tribes of New Zealand and the Declaration of Independence===

On 28 October 1835, various Northland chiefs, primarily from the Ngāpuhi tribe, met at Waitangi with British resident James Busby and signed the Declaration of the Independence of New Zealand, proclaiming the United Tribes of New Zealand. In 1836, the Crown received and recognized the United Tribes&#x27; independence under King William IV. By 1839, 52 chiefs from around Northland and central North Island had signed the Declaration, including most Ngāpuhi chiefs and Pōtatau Te Wherowhero, ariki of the Tainui tribes of the Waikato (iwi).

=== Flagstaff War and re-erection of the flagstaff===

In 1840, the Ngāpuhi chiefs were all signatories to the Treaty of Waitangi. However, from 1845 to 1846, Ngāpuhi fought against the British Crown over treaty disputes and European encroachment and interference. The Māori forces were led by Te Ruki Kawiti and Hōne Heke, who instigated the war when he chopped down the flagpole at Kororāreka to commence what is sometimes called the Flagstaff War. The British did not fight alone but had Ngāpuhi allies; Tāmati Wāka Nene had given the government assurances of the good behaviour of the Ngāpuhi and he felt that Hōne Heke had betrayed his trust in instigating the Flagstaff War.

The outcome of the Flagstaff War is a matter of some debate. Although the war was widely lauded as a British victory, it is clear that the outcome was somewhat more complex, even contentious. The flagstaff which had proved so controversial was not re-erected by the colonial government. Whilst the Bay of Islands and Hokianga was still nominally under British influence, the fact that the Government&#x27;s flag was not re-erected was symbolically very significant. Such significance was not lost on Henry Williams, who, writing to E. G. Marsh on 28 May 1846, stated that &quot;the flag-staff in the Bay is still prostrate, and the natives here rule. These are humiliating facts to the proud Englishman, many of whom thought they could govern by a mere name.&quot;

The legacy of Kawiti&#x27;s rebellion during the Flagstaff War was that during the time of Governor Grey and Governor Thomas Gore Browne, the colonial administrators were obliged to take account of opinions of the Ngāpuhi before taking action in the Hokianga and Bay of Islands.

===Post-Flagstaff War===

The Waitangi Tribunal in &quot;The Te Roroa Report 1992&quot; (Wai 38) stated that &quot;[a]fter the war in the north, government policy was to place a buffer zone of European settlement between Ngāpuhi and Auckland. This matched Ngati Whatua&#x27;s desire to have more settlers and townships, a greater abundance of trade goods and protection from Ngāpuhi, their traditional foe.&quot;

The flagstaff that now stands at Kororareka was erected in January 1858 at the direction of Kawiti&#x27;s son Maihi Paraone Kawiti, as a signal to Governor Thomas Gore Browne, that Maihi did not follow his father&#x27;s path. In a symbolic act, the 400 Ngāpuhi warriors involved in preparing and erecting the flagpole were selected from the &quot;rebel&quot; forces of Kawiti and Heke – that is, Ngāpuhi from the hapū of Tāmati Wāka Nene (who had fought as allies of the British forces during the Flagstaff War), observed, but did not participate in the erection of the fifth flagpole. The restoration of the flagpole by Maihi Paraone Kawiti was a voluntary act on the part of the Ngāpuhi that had cut it down on 11 March 1845, and they would not allow any other to render any assistance in this work. The erection of the fifth flagstaff at Kororareka by the Ngāpuhi warriors who had conducted the Flagstaff War, and not by government decree, indicates the colonial government did not want to risk any further confrontation with the Ngāpuhi. The continuing symbolism of the fifth flagpole at Kororareka is that it exists because of the goodwill of the Ngāpuhi.

Notwithstanding the achievements of Te Ruki Kawiti and Hōne Heke in pushing back colonial government control over the Ngāpuhi, in the years after the Flagstaff War over 2,000 km2 of Ngāpuhi land was alienated from Māori control. As part of Maihi Paraone Kawiti&#x27;s erection of the fifth flagpole at Kororareka, he offered the Governor all the lands between Karetu and Moerewa to north of Waiomio and as far south as the Ruapekapeka Pa. Tawai Kawiti described this offer of land as being &quot;a whariki&quot; (or mat) for the flag to repose on. The offer was accepted but was paid for at half the land&#x27;s value.

===20th and 21st centuries===
Amidst cultural and economic decline, the twentieth century saw a steady migration of Ngāpuhi Māori from Northland into other regions of the North Island, mainly Auckland, Waikato and the Bay of Plenty. In part, this has seen the organisation of Ngāpuhi into large geographic and urban divisions.

The whārenui of Ōkorihi marae burned down in 2003.
==Waitangi Tribunal – Te Paparahi o te Raki (Wai 1040)==

In 2010, the Waitangi Tribunal began hearings into the Ngāpuhi&#x27;s claim that sovereignty was not given up in their signing of the Treaty of Waitangi. The Tribunal, in &quot;Te Paparahi o te Raki&quot; inquiry (Wai 1040), considered the Māori and Crown understandings of He Whakaputanga o te Rangatiratanga / The Declaration of Independence 1835 and Te Tiriti o Waitangi / the Treaty of Waitangi 1840.

Many of the arguments used were outlined in Paul Moon&#x27;s 2002 book &quot;Te Ara Ki Te Tiriti: The Path to the Treaty of Waitangi&quot;, which argued that not only did the Māori signatories have no intention of transferring sovereignty, but that at the time the British government and James Busby did not wish to acquire it and that the developments and justifications leading to the present state were later developments. A common Ngāpuhi interpretation of the Declaration of the United Tribes is that the British government was simply recognizing Māori independence and putting the world on check, merely re-asserting sovereignty that had existed from &quot;time immemorial&quot;.

The Te Paparahi o Te Raki stage 1 inquiry hearings phase was intended to reach conclusions as to the meaning and effect of the treaty for the Crown and Te Raki Māori in 1840. Hearings began in May 2010 and on 14 November 2014, the Te Raki stage 1 report handover took place at Te Tii Marae, Waitangi.

The key conclusion of the stage 1 report was that the treaty signatories did not cede sovereignty in February 1840. &quot;That is, they did not cede authority to make and enforce law over their people or their territories.&quot; The rangatira did, however, agree &quot;to share power and authority with Britain&quot;.

The consequences of the findings in the stage 1 report were considered in the Te Raki stage 2 inquiry, with the Tribunal hearings considering issues including the immediate aftermath of the Treaty of Waitangi, the Flagstaff War and Crown pre-emption (the right of the Crown to acquire Māori land that is addressed in the treaty).

==Hapū and marae==

==Media==

Tautoko FM broadcasts to the people of Ngāpuhi-nui-tonu, and began operating on 28 November 1988. It broadcasts on in Mangamuka. The Tautoko FM building burnt to the ground on 18 May 2015, cutting power to the small Mangamuka community.

==Religion==

Most Ngāpuhi, 49.6%, identify as being irreligious, according to data from Te Whata iwi estimates, based on 2018 Census data. 42.2% of Ngāpuhi specify a religious affiliation, larger than the 38.1% of Māori as a whole who specify religious affiliation.

<text>Huonville () is a town located on the banks of the Huon River in the Huon Valley, in the south-east of Tasmania, Australia. It serves as the administrative centre of the Huon Valley Council and is the largest town in the Huon Valley region. Situated approximately 38 kilometres south of the state capital, Hobart, Huonville acts as a gateway to Tasmania’s wilderness areas and the Southwest National Park.

The town is historically significant for its role in Tasmania&#x27;s apple-growing industry, earning the Huon Valley the nickname &quot;Golden Valley&quot; due to its production of Golden Delicious apples. While the apple industry has declined, Huonville remains an important agricultural hub, now also known for aquaculture, including salmon farming, and for tourism. The town attracts visitors with its scenic landscape, artisanal food and drink, and outdoor recreational activities such as hiking, kayaking, and fishing.

Huonville has a population of 3,002 according to the 2021 census. It is known for its proximity to the Huon Highway, which connects the town to nearby communities and Hobart, making it a central regional township for transport and trade. The township has historically faced environmental challenges, including vulnerability to floods and bushfires, which have affected the town in recent years. Despite these challenges, Huonville continues to thrive as a hub for eco-tourism and sustainable agriculture, preserving its rural heritage while adapting to modern economic and environmental conditions.

==History==
Before European settlement, the area now known as Huonville and the surrounding Huon Valley was home to the Mellukerdee people, one of the First Nations groups of southern Tasmania. The Mellukerdee people lived along the banks of the Huon River, relying on its rich resources for fishing, hunting, and cultural practices. Their connection to the land and waterways formed an integral part of their spiritual and daily life, and they had deep knowledge of the region’s environment. European colonisation, beginning in the early 19th century, severely disrupted the Mellukerdee way of life, and many were displaced from their lands as British settlers established farming and logging operations in the valley.

European exploration of the Huon River began in 1792, led by Admiral Bruni d&#x27;Entrecasteaux during his expedition to search for the missing French explorer Jean-François de Galaup, comte de La Pérouse. The river was named by d&#x27;Entrecasteaux in honour of his second-in-command, Captain Jean-Michel Huon de Kermadec. Settlement in the region began in the 1840s, with William and Thomas Walton among the first settlers to establish farms in the fertile valley.

Huonville, initially a smaller settlement, grew around the key bridge crossing the Huon River, which made it a strategic location for transport and trade. While the nearby township of Ranelagh was initially planned as the central settlement, Huonville developed into a bustling centre of the Huon Valley and was officially declared a town in 1891.

===Apple production===

By the late 19th century, apple growing became the dominant agricultural activity in the Huon Valley. The region’s fertile soils and temperate climate were ideal for growing apples, and Huonville played a central role in processing and distributing the fruit. Throughout the 20th century, the valley became known as the &quot;Apple Bowl of Tasmania&quot;, with apples being one of Tasmania’s key exports. At its peak, Huonville and the surrounding areas produced 83% of Tasmania’s apples, and the industry was so prominent that Tasmania earned the nickname &quot;The Apple Isle&quot;.

Apple production reached its height in the mid-20th century, when apples were exported globally, particularly to the United Kingdom. However, the industry began to decline in the latter half of the century due to a combination of factors, including changing global trade policies, competition from other apple-producing regions, and a reduction in demand from traditional markets.

Despite the decline, apple orchards remain an important part of the Huon Valley&#x27;s economy, and Huonville continues to celebrate its apple-growing heritage. The town hosts the annual Huon Valley Mid-Winter Festival, which includes a traditional “wassailing” ceremony to bless the apple trees, and it has become a centre for boutique cider production in Tasmania.

The town has also faced environmental challenges, including record floods in 2016 and significant bushfires in 2019, which have highlighted the region’s vulnerability to the effects of climate change.

==Economy==
Huonville remains an important hub for agriculture in the Huon Valley, with the apple industry still playing a key role, alongside other fruit crops such as cherries and berries. However, aquaculture, especially salmon farming, has become a major industry in the region. Huon Aquaculture, one of Tasmania&#x27;s largest salmon producers, operates farms in the nearby Huon River and d&#x27;Entrecasteaux Channel.

The town is also emerging as a destination for tourism, particularly for visitors seeking artisan food and wine, as well as outdoor activities such as hiking, kayaking, and fishing. Huonville is situated on the edge of Tasmania&#x27;s wilderness, making it a popular stop for visitors exploring the region&#x27;s national parks.

==Demographics==

Huonville&#x27;s demographics reflect its role as a rural hub for the surrounding agricultural areas. The town has experienced modest population growth in recent years, with the population reaching 3,002 at the . Including the surrounding rural areas, classified as Statistical Areas Level 2 (SA2s), the broader population totals 4,579 residents.

The majority of Huonville&#x27;s residents are of Australian (61.3%) and English (24.7%) ancestry. 7.1% of the population identifies as Aboriginal Australians or Torres Strait Islander, a figure higher than the national average of 3.2%. This trend is common in many regional Tasmanian towns, where Indigenous populations are often more concentrated in rural and regional areas than in major cities.

Nearly half (46.8%) of the population reported no religious affiliation in 2021, while Anglicanism was the most common religion (18.4%). The median age in Huonville was 45 years, significantly higher than the national median of 38, reflecting the older population common in Tasmania’s rural towns.

In 2021, Huonville’s median weekly household income was $1,135, lower than the national median of $1,746, reflecting its rural economy, which is heavily reliant on agriculture, forestry, and aquaculture. These industries tend to offer lower wages compared to urban centres. The town’s unemployment rate was 7.2%, slightly higher than the national average of 6.6%.

Huonville has a higher rate of home ownership compared to larger cities, with more affordable property prices attracting families, retirees, and those seeking a rural lifestyle. Its proximity to Hobart, just 38 km to the north, makes it a popular choice for commuters seeking more affordable living conditions while remaining within reach of the capital city.

==Climate==
Huonville has a temperate oceanic climate (Köppen: Cfb), with cool, wet winters and mild, dry summers. The average maximum temperature ranges from in February to in July, while the average minimum temperatures range from in summer to in winter.

Huonville receives an annual average rainfall of , which is relatively evenly distributed throughout the year. Extreme temperatures have ranged from in January 2009 to in June 1972.

==Access==

Huonville is located 38 km south of Hobart and is primarily accessed via the Huon Highway, which runs through the town and connects it to surrounding regions. The Huon Highway serves as the main arterial road linking Huonville with Hobart to the north and the southern towns of Geeveston, Dover, and Southport to the south.

The highway offers scenic views as it travels through the Huon Valley, crossing the Huon River via a bridge in Huonville, which plays a key role in connecting the town to the west. Several local roads also branch off the Huon Highway, providing access to smaller settlements such as Cygnet, Franklin, and Ranelagh.

Public transport services in the region are limited but are provided by private bus companies, with regular routes running between Huonville and Hobart. These buses cater to both commuters and school students, making the town accessible for those working or studying in Hobart.

Cycling is an increasingly popular mode of transport in the Huon Valley, with the region’s scenic routes attracting both locals and visitors. However, dedicated cycling infrastructure is limited, and cyclists often share the roads with vehicles.

Huonville also serves as a gateway to southern Tasmania’s more remote regions, including Southwest National Park, making it an important stop for tourists exploring Tasmania’s wilderness. The town’s strategic location along the Huon River has historically made it a key transport hub for agricultural products, particularly apples, which were once floated down the river to the ports in Hobart.

<text>Julian Constable Smith (September 11, 1885 – November 5, 1975) was a United States Marine Corps general who served for 37 years, including service in Nicaragua (Navy Cross) and during World War II&#x27;s Battle of Tarawa (Distinguished Service Medal).

==Biography==
Smith was born in Elkton, Maryland, on 11 September 1885, and graduated from the University of Delaware. He received his appointment as a second lieutenant in January 1909, and underwent his basic training as a Marine officer at the Marine Barracks, Port Royal, South Carolina. Following his promotion to first lieutenant in September 1912, he was ordered to the Marine barracks at the Philadelphia Navy Yard, and in December of the following year, he was transferred to Panama, remaining there until January 1914. As a member of an expeditionary force, he departed from Panama to take part in the occupation of Vera Cruz, Mexico, from April to December 1914.

Upon returning to the United States, he again was ordered to Philadelphia, this time as a member of the 1st Brigade of Marines. In August 1915, he began a tour of expeditionary duty in Haiti, and in April 1916, was transferred to Santo Domingo with the 2nd Battalion, 1st Regiment, 1st Brigade. In December of the same year, he was ordered back to the Philadelphia Navy Yard, this time, to serve with the Advanced Base Force there.

Following his promotion to captain in March 1917, Smith was ordered to a course of instruction at the Naval War College in Newport, Rhode Island, and several months later he was assigned to Quantico, Virginia, as an instructor in the Marine Officers&#x27; Training Camps. In the early part of 1919, he sailed for Cuba in command of a machine gun battalion. After his service there, he returned to the Navy Yard at Philadelphia, and a short time later was transferred to Headquarters Marine Corps, Washington, D.C.

In August 1920, Smith again assumed duties at Quantico, and in July of the following year, he was ordered to sea duty on the staff of the commander, Scouting Fleet. Two years later, he again returned to Washington, this time to serve in the office of the Chief Coordinator, Bureau of the Budget. He left Washington to enter the Army Command and General Staff School, Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, and after graduation in 1928, was again ordered to Marine Corps Headquarters. He captained the Marine Corps Rifle and Pistol Team Squad, for the year of 1928, while detached to temporary duty at Quantico, and also headed the 1930 squad.

Smith&#x27;s next assignment was with the Marines at Corinto, Nicaragua, where he began a three-year tour of expeditionary duty in August 1930. Following that, he returned to Quantico, where he was appointed to the rank of lieutenant colonel. Then, after another short tour of duty in Philadelphia, he returned to Marine Corps Headquarters for duty with the Division of Operations and Training. With his promotion to colonel, he was named director of personnel.

In June 1938, Smith became commanding officer, 5th Marines, 1st Marine Brigade, at Quantico, where he remained until his promotion to brigadier general. He was then ordered to London, where he served with the Naval Attache, American Embassy, as a naval observer. He returned to the United States in August 1941, and again reported to Quantico. Upon appointment to major general in October 1942, he assumed command of the Fleet Marine Force Training Schools at New River, North Carolina. He took command of the 2nd Marine Division in May 1943 and led the division during the assault on Tarawa. He remained in this capacity until April of the following year, when he was named commanding general, Expeditionary Troops, Third Fleet.

In December 1944, Smith took command of the Department of the Pacific, with headquarters in San Francisco, California. From there, he was ordered to Parris Island, South Carolina, where he commanded the Marine Corps Recruit Depot from February 1946, until his retirement. After his death in November 1975, Smith was buried in Arlington National Cemetery.

<doc id="778369" wikidata="Q2887483" url="?curid=778369" title="Harney Basin">
<text>The Harney Basin is an endorheic basin in southeastern Oregon in the United States at the northwestern corner of the Great Basin. One of the least populated areas of the contiguous United States, it is located largely in northern Harney County, bounded on the north and east by the Columbia Plateau—within which it is contained, physiographically speaking—and on the south and west by a volcanic plain. The basin encompasses an area of in the watershed of Malheur Lake and Harney Lake. Malheur Lake is a freshwater lake, while Harney Lake is saline-alkaline.

The basin is bounded on the north by the southern end of the Blue Mountains. The ridge of Steens Mountain separates the basin from the watershed of the Alvord Desert to the southeast. No streams cross the volcanic plains that separate the basin from the watershed of the Klamath River to the southwest. The basin includes archeological sites of the Drewsey Resource Area.

==Geography==

The central basin receives an average of of rain per year, with the surrounding mountains receiving an average of per year. The center of the basin is flat and contains Malheur and Harney lakes, which receive the streams originating within the basin in the surrounding mountains, including the Silvies River from the north and the Donner und Blitzen River from the south. Harney Lake is the actual sink of the basin, connected in some years to Malheur Lake but currently separated by constantly changing sand dunes. Both lakes cycle between open water in wetter years and marshes in drier years. The wetlands around Malheur Lake and Harney Lake form a wetlands oasis in the basin, providing a habitat for many migratory bird species, including 2.5 million ducks each year. Malheur Lake and its surroundings are embraced by Malheur National Wildlife Refuge.

Harney County, Oregon, had a total population of 7,422 at the 2010 census, and Burns in the plain north of Malheur Lake is the only community with a population larger than 1,000. Dryland ranching is the basis of the area&#x27;s economy, with relatively little irrigation water available from the streams that enter Malheur Lake.

===Harney Basin Volcanic Field===
The Harney Basin Volcanic Field is a series of volcanic flows of rhyolite and of tuffs of ash flows in around Burns, Oregon. The field is within the High Lava Plains Province.

===Harney-Malheur Lakes watershed===
The Harney-Malheur Lakes watershed is a Great Basin watershed. The adjacent Donner und Blitzen River watershed of discharges into Malheur Lake and includes the river portion of the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge. &quot;Alkali Field is located directly south of Malheur Lake, a few kilometers east of the Donner und Blitzen River.&quot;

The High Desert Wetlands ecoregion is a set of Northern Basin and Range wetlands with in Oregon, including a large area around Harney and Malheur Lakes.

==History==
The basin was formed approximately 32,000 years ago when lava flows formed the Malheur Gap, separating the watershed of the basin from the Malheur River, a tributary of the Snake River. Archaeological evidence indicates the basin was inhabited as early as 10,000 years ago. Pollen records indicate that the climate, especially the level of rain and snowfall, has varied greatly since the end of the Pleistocene. Evidence of prehistoric fishing techniques is found at several sites. Evidence suggests that there existed in the basin several species—in particular, the chiselmouth, coarse-scale suckers, and northern squawfish—that are currently found only in the Columbia River basin, indicating that at some point the Harney Basin may have been connected to the Columbia. During wetter years, the lake level of Malheur Lake was raised to a depth of , allowing the lakes to drain over the Malheur Gap. In modern times, however, the lake level does not rise above in the wettest years.

In the 19th century, the basin was inhabited by the Northern Paiute tribe. It was explored and extensively trapped by trappers of the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company in the 1820s. The basin lay far off the route of the Oregon Trail, but in 1845 experienced mountain man Stephen Meek led an ill-fated party across the basin via Stinkingwater Pass, seeking a shortcut to The Dalles along what has become known as the Meek Cutoff. A total of 23 people died while the party wandered in the basin until finding water at the Crooked River.

Because of its climate, it received sparse white settlements and was largely left to the Paiute until the late 19th century. Settlement pressures and conflicts with the Paiute in other areas of Oregon caused President Ulysses S. Grant in 1872 to create a reservation for the Paiute encompassing Malheur Lake and much of the basin. Growing settlement pressures, in particular the discovery of gold in the surrounding mountains, as well as the interest of white settlers to form ranches in the region, caused the Commissioner of Indian Affairs to abruptly terminate the reservation in 1879. The Northern Paiute would survive virtually landless until obtaining tracts of land near Burns in 1935.

The basin has a widespread decline in groundwater which has put the region at risk of ecological and economic collapse. Irrigation pumping is dropping the water table as much as every year in one area.

<doc id="778423" wikidata="Q3039284" url="?curid=778423" title="Dreamland (Coney Island, 1904)">
<text>Dreamland was an amusement park that operated in the Coney Island neighborhood of Brooklyn in New York City, United States, from 1904 to 1911. It was the last of the three original large parks built on Coney Island, along with Steeplechase Park and Luna Park. The park was between Surf Avenue to the north and the Atlantic Ocean to the south. It was arranged roughly as a horseshoe, with a pier facing south toward the Atlantic Ocean. Dreamland contained several attractions that were larger versions of those at Luna Park, and it included a human zoo, several early roller coasters, a Shoot the Chutes ride, and a replica of Venice. Dreamland also hosted entertainment and dramatic spectacles based on morality themes. Several structures, such as the Pompeiian, Electricity, and Submarine Boat buildings, were dedicated to exhibits.

Former state senator William H. Reynolds announced plans in July 1903 for an amusement park rivaling Luna Park, originally known as the Hippodrome. The Dreamland Company started constructing the park in December 1903, and the park opened as Dreamland on May 15, 1904. The park operated between May and September of each year, and Reynolds constantly changed Dreamland&#x27;s shows and attractions every season. Coney Island had reached its peak popularity by the late 1900s, but Dreamland struggled to compete with Luna Park, which was better managed.

During the early morning of May 27, 1911, just after the start of Dreamland&#x27;s eighth season, a worker kicked over a bucket of hot pitch, starting a fire that spread through the park&#x27;s wooden buildings. Firefighters were unable to control the fire because of low water pressure; nearly all of the structures were quickly destroyed, although no one was killed. The site&#x27;s northern portion, on Surf Avenue, was quickly redeveloped with various concessions. The New York City government acquired the southern portion through condemnation in 1912, but disputes over compensation continued for eight years. The site became a parking lot in 1921 and was redeveloped as a recreation center in 1935; the New York Aquarium was eventually built on the site in 1957.

== Development ==
Between about 1880 and World War II, Coney Island was the largest amusement area in the United States, attracting several million visitors per year. Sea Lion Park opened in 1895 and was Coney Island&#x27;s first amusement area to charge entry fees; this in turn spurred the construction of George C. Tilyou&#x27;s Steeplechase Park in 1897, the neighborhood&#x27;s first major amusement park. Frederic Thompson and Elmer &quot;Skip&quot; Dundy opened Luna Park, Coney Island&#x27;s second major amusement park, in 1903 on the site of Sea Lion Park, which had closed the previous year. William H. Reynolds, a former state senator and successful Brooklyn real estate developer, decided to construct Dreamland following the success of Luna Park. He intended for Dreamland to compete with Luna Park. Dreamland was supposed to be refined and elegant in its design and architecture, compared to Luna Park with its many rides and chaotic noise.
Reynolds announced plans in July 1903 for an amusement park rivaling Luna Park, which was to be built in a style resembling London&#x27;s Hippodrome. According to local media, he reportedly paid $180,000 for a pier on the Coney Island Beach, as well as $447,500 for two parcels at Surf Avenue and West Eighth Street, measuring deep and wide. The &quot;Times Union&quot; subsequently said that the purchase prices for the site were not correct. The Surf Avenue parcels had belonged to John Y. McKane, who had operated a bathing house on the site. Previously, the parcels had also included the Coney Island Athletic Club&#x27;s arena and the Culver Depot, the then-terminal of what is now the New York City Subway&#x27;s Brighton and Culver lines. Although C. L. Turnbull and P. I. Thompson were nominally the buyers, but they acted as proxies for Reynolds, allowing him to acquire the Surf Avenue site at a discount of more than $50,000. Once Reynolds acquired the site, he made a deal with the New York City Board of Estimate to demap West Eighth Street, which separated McKane&#x27;s parcels from each other. The street, which had taken up one-sixth of the proposed park&#x27;s width, contained a trolley terminal that needed to be relocated.

Originally, the park was supposed to be known as the Hippodrome. In August 1903, Reynolds and several other men established the Wonderland Company, which had a capitalization of $1.2 million and existed specifically to develop an amusement park on the site. The amusement pier was planned to contain a dance hall and bathing pavilion, while the main portion of the site would be arranged around a large tower that would overtop Luna Park&#x27;s. The company took title to the plots in September 1903 and received a $200,000 mortgage loan from the Title Guarantee and Trust Company. The Edison Company was hired to manufacture the park&#x27;s lights in late 1903; the new park was expected to have more electric lights than had existed on all of Coney Island during the preceding season.

Construction of the park itself began in December 1903. General contractor Edward Johnson Company employed about 2,000 workers, who were employed in three shifts of eight hours each. The park was known as Dreamland by January 1904. Reynolds, wishing to surpass Luna Park by every metric, reportedly spent $3.5 million on Dreamland. Dreamland had one million lights, compared to 250,000 lights at Luna Park; even Dreamland&#x27;s firefighting show was more elaborate than that at Luna Park. Dreamland also planned to differentiate itself from Luna Park by adding novel attractions, as well as operating a private beach and bath house (something that Luna Park lacked because of its inland location). Samuel W. Gumpertz was among those who helped develop the park.

==Operation==

=== 1904 to 1907 ===
Dreamland opened on May 15, 1904, with a fire show that employed 4,000 performers. The park was $1.9 million in debt, more than the entire amount invested in the competing Luna Park. Dreamland charged 10 cents for admission on weekdays and 15 cents on weekends, plus an additional fee of up to 25 cents for individual rides. The park closed for the season on September 24, 1904. Reynolds said Dreamland had recorded a $400,000 net profit during the operating season, despite erroneous reports that the park had been placed in receivership. Although the Leapfrog Railway roller coaster was completed with the rest of the park, it did not open until the 1905 season.

Reynolds spent $500,000 on new attractions and shows ahead of the 1905 season, which ran from May 13 to September 24. Among these was a show based on the Creation myth, which had been exhibited at the 1904 St. Louis Exposition; this attraction alone cost $250,000. The park also added an exhibition of a Roman hippodrome around the lagoon; replaced the submarine ride with the Hell Gate boat ride; and added a Japanese-themed theater. City officials temporarily closed Dreamland&#x27;s pier in May 1905, citing the fact that the pier was too narrow to accommodate crowds.

Many of the park&#x27;s shows were replaced for the 1906 season, and park officials also rebuilt the pier. The new attractions for that season included a reenactment of the 1906 San Francisco earthquake&#x27;s aftermath; a Moqui Indian village; a rebuilt Creation show; and the Touring New York car show. The park opened for the 1906 season on May 20, and it began hosting vaudeville shows for the first time that June. Dreamland&#x27;s third season ended on September 24, 1906. Prior to the 1907 season, concessionaire William Ellis introduced an attraction called the Orient, anchored by a theater that presented several shows. Park officials also built a new administration building and installed other shows. Park officials gave $50 to the first guest of the season on May 18, 1907, and the park operated through September 21 of that year. At this point, the park hosted several shows that were based on themes of morality, such as &quot;The End of the World&quot; and the &quot;Feast of Beshazzar and the Destruction of Babylon&quot;.

=== 1908 to 1911 ===

Coney Island had reached its peak popularity by the late 1900s, when millions of people visited the neighborhood every year. Despite its many amusements, Dreamland struggled to compete with the better-managed Luna Park. As such, for the 1908 season, the park&#x27;s management decided to offer free admission during weekdays; although the free-admission policy did not extend to individual rides, the policy still attracted visitors. The park opened for the season on May 23, 1908, and operated until September 20. For this season, Ellis added an auditorium with more than one thousand seats, and the park also added shows such as Freak Street, the Moroccan Jugglers, and an Old Virginia show. Following the 1908 season, Dreamland hired Wells Hawks of the New York Hippodrome to lead the publicity bureau, and they hired Gumpertz as the general manager.

Prior to the 1909 season, four thousand workmen completely revamped the park&#x27;s attractions. The ballroom was expanded to accommodate 1,500 couples. Other additions included a wisteria garden on the site of the former hippodrome track, a circus ring near the tower, a scenic railway roller coaster, a Deep Sea Divers attraction, and a village of Filipinos. The park&#x27;s operators said &quot;everything at Dreamland will be new but the ocean&quot;. The park&#x27;s sixth season began on May 15, 1909, and ended on September 19. That year, New York City mayor George B. McClellan Jr. attempted to prevent the park from staging live shows on Sundays, citing the city&#x27;s blue laws, although Reynolds strongly opposed the legislation. Dreamland had previously held a license permitting it to present shows seven days a week. When the license was renewed in June 1909, the shows were allowed only six days a week. Gumpertz said the city government took issue with Dreamland&#x27;s circus, which was free of charge. City officials also objected to the Filipino villagers&#x27; attire, which exposed their legs.

Kings County sheriff Patrick H. Quinn announced in February 1910 that the park would be auctioned off on behalf of Eugene Wood and Joseph Huber, the corporation&#x27;s two largest bondholders, who wanted to reorganize the company. The auction only involved a nominal change of ownership, as Huber and Wood bought the park the next month. Dreamland&#x27;s seventh season began on May 14, 1910, and ran until September 18. Among the new attractions for the 1910 season were Alligator Joe&#x27;s alligator and crocodile farm, a Bornean village, and a ride called Trip to the North Pole.In preparation for Dreamland&#x27;s 1911 season, its operators made additional changes. For instance, the buildings were repainted in white and red, and the structures near the Surf Avenue entrance were demolished to make way for a lighting plant with 130,000 additional light bulbs. Various rides such as the Great Divide, Canals of Venice, Tub Ride, and Hell Gate were enlarged, while the ballroom and restaurant had been relocated from the pier to near the Surf Avenue entrance. The site of the old ballroom was converted to a skating rink, and the bathing pavilion on the ocean was expanded significantly. The park added thirty new shows, such as Joseph Ferari&#x27;s animal show, a biblical show known as the Sacrifice, and a village of &quot;human curiosities&quot;. It also added a miniature subway around the park, a carousel, and a dual-tracked roller coaster. Some existing attractions were retained, such as Bostock&#x27;s Wild Animals, which included a dwarf elephant named Little Hip and a one-armed lion tamer known as Captain Jack Bonavita. Dreamland also hired Omar Sami as a carnival barker for the 1911 season, and the park opened for its eighth season on May 20, 1911.

==Destruction ==
=== Fire ===
Despite the implementation of fire-safety regulations in certain areas of Coney Island after a major blaze in 1902, these regulations were not extended to Dreamland. Consequently, the park remained highly vulnerable to fire. During the early morning of May 27, 1911, the Hell Gate attraction was undergoing last-minute repairs by a roofing company owned by Samuel Engelstein. A leak had to be caulked with tar. During these repairs, at about 1:30 a.m., the light bulbs turned off and a worker kicked over a bucket of hot pitch, causing the light bulbs to explode. Winds from the ocean caused the fire to quickly spread throughout the park. The Dreamland fire was the first double-nine-alarm fire that the New York City Fire Department (FDNY) had ever fought in Brooklyn. This alarm, which signified the most severe type of fire, summoned FDNY companies from across Brooklyn.

Fires had been a persistent problem at Coney Island, so a high-pressure water pumping station had been constructed at West 15th Street near Coney Island Creek during the 1900s. On the night of the Dreamland fire, the water pressure was extremely low: the pumping station was capable of supplying water at , but the pressure had dropped to . Furthermore, even though Coney Island&#x27;s firehouse was within of Dreamland, the other FDNY companies had to travel long distances to reach Coney Island. By the time other FDNY companies reached the neighborhood, the entire park had caught fire. As a result of the conflagration&#x27;s intensity, as well as the low water pressure, firefighters could not even enter the park; they attempted to extinguish the fire from its borders. As the park burned, tens of thousands of onlookers traveled from across New York City to see the fire. Firefighters quickly shifted their focus to saving adjacent structures. Several buildings on the south side of Surf Avenue caught fire, although almost all buildings on the north side remained undamaged.

Bonavita and Ferari attempted to save the animals, some of whom escaped, though about 60 animals died. A lion named Black Prince rushed into the streets and climbed a roller coaster before being shot. Another animal, Sultan, was shot several dozen times before being killed by an axe blow. Early editions of &quot;The New York Times&quot; claimed the incubator babies had perished in the flames, but the infants were all saved, and the &quot;Times&quot; subsequently corrected itself. According to contemporary accounts, New York City Police Department (NYPD) sergeant Frederick Klinck made several trips into the burning structure to rescue incubator babies. The conflagration extended east to Balmer&#x27;s bathing pavilion at West 5th Street and west to the new Giant Coaster at West 10th Street. The Giant Coaster acted as a firebreak that prevented the fire from spreading, as did several brick buildings east of the park&#x27;s central tower. The tower collapsed just after 3 a.m., and all attractions were on fire by 3:30 a.m. Around 4 a.m., the water pressure returned to normal, but most of the park had been burned by then. The fire was extinguished at 5 a.m.

=== Aftermath ===
The NYPD initially estimated that the park had sustained $4 million in damage, although other estimates ranged between $2.25 and $5 million. The fire destroyed almost everything in the park. The Dicker family&#x27;s adjacent hotel also burned down, as did both of Dreamland&#x27;s piers. Only one building remained intact after the fire, and all concessions were destroyed. Conversely, the El Dorado Carousel, which had been relocated to the area shortly before the fire, survived relatively intact. The entire complex had been constructed of combustible materials, so insurers saw the park as high-risk. The park was consequently insured for only about $400,000. A preliminary investigation found that the fire had started when the tar spread across the floor, creating a short circuit that caused the light bulbs to explode. As a result of the fire, 1,600 Dreamland employees lost their jobs; another 900 people worked in neighboring businesses that had also been destroyed. Hundreds of workers were clearing the site several hours after the fire had been extinguished, and some of Dreamland&#x27;s shows resumed on May 28, 1911, the day after the fire. Coney Island attracted 350,000 visitors on that day; concessionaires attracted some of these visitors by exhibiting debris and dead animals, and workers also tried to salvage the Giant Racing Coaster. The New York State Legislature also introduced legislation to ban infant incubators in New York state&#x27;s amusement parks. The Dreamland fire negatively impacted its competitors&#x27; business, as the fire drove away visitors who would have gone to Dreamland.

==== Condemnation proceedings ====
Immediately after the fire was extinguished, Reynolds indicated that he would not rebuild the burned park. Two days after the fire, Reynolds proposed selling Dreamland&#x27;s site to the New York City government for a &quot;fair price&quot;, which would allow the city to convert the land to a public park. The &quot;Times Union&quot; reported the price as $3 million, but Reynolds denied these allegations. He suggested that the New York City government could buy the tract surrounding his park for that amount. The New York City Board of Estimate began considering buying the Dreamland site in mid-June 1911, and it voted to acquire the Dreamland site via condemnation at the end of July 1911. The board approved a revised proposal that October in which it agreed to pay $1 million for a site. The revised proposal excluded the northernmost of Dreamland&#x27;s site, on Surf Avenue, thereby splitting the park&#x27;s site into two sections. Brooklyn borough president Alfred E. Steers immediately advocated for selling the site and developing a boardwalk along the ocean.

Legal disputes quickly arose over who held the Dreamland site&#x27;s property title. The Morey and Lott families claimed in late 1911 that nearly all of Coney Island fell under a quitclaim deed granted by Nicholas Johnson, who had agreed to sell the land even though he had no right to the property. Barnet Morey&#x27;s heirs sued Dreamland in February 1912, and the city formed a condemnation commission the same month to determine how much compensation the former owners should receive. The city took title to the Dreamland site in March 1912. Although the condemnation commissioners began taking testimony that October, the proceedings were delayed because of the lawsuit. A New York Supreme Court justice dismissed the Morey and Lott families&#x27; lawsuit in May 1913, and the Dreamland Company received $1,000 in damages.

The condemnation commission announced in late 1914 that it would pay $2.189 million to property owners, which included the Dreamland Company, the Prospect Park and Coney Island Railroad (PP&amp;CI), and the Balmer family. The award was revised downward to just over $2.1 million in June 1915, but the city appealed the award, and the condemnation proceedings were delayed for years. The New York Supreme Court, Appellate Division, ruled in early 1916 that Dreamland Company&#x27;s and PP&amp;CI&#x27;s awards were too high. The city selected a second group of commissioners, which decided in February 1919 to reduce the total award to $1.4 million. The commissioners notified the state government of the revised award in October 1919; by then, the cost of the condemnation itself had grown to $800,000. The State Supreme Court was asked to confirm the revised award in June 1920, eight years after the condemnation proceedings had begun.

== Subsequent site usage ==

=== Northern section ===
By July 1911, independent concessionaires had rebuilt their booths on the northern portion of the site, facing Surf Avenue; the remainder of the park remained ruined. The northern part of the site contained &quot;a sideshow of freaks and some shooting galleries&quot; in 1912. Gumpertz leased the northern parcel in 1914, measuring on Surf Avenue and deep; he intended to restore the attractions there. By the next year, the northern part of the site had roller coasters, side shows, and shooting galleries named after Dreamland. Film producer William Fox acquired the northern part of the site at an auction in March 1921 for $407,750, and he resold it in June 1921 to Gumpertz and William M. Greve for $450,000. Gumpertz and Greve planned to rebuild the park, although this never happened.

=== Southern section ===
The southern section of the park was not redeveloped for several decades after the 1911 fire. The remaining buildings on the southern part of the Dreamland site were razed by 1915. The site was supposed to be part of the unbuilt Seaside Park. The New York City government had planned to rebuild Dreamland&#x27;s pier and fill it with rock; the pier was supposed to be completed in mid-1914, but two years later it still had not been rebuilt. R. H. Pfoor proposed constructing a bathhouse on Dreamland&#x27;s site in 1919, but city officials rejected the proposal. The city government converted its portion of the site into a parking lot in 1921. The city had expanded the parking lot to 2,000 spaces by 1922, and it also operated a seasonal skating rink on Dreamland&#x27;s site. Morris Auditore and Harry Shea leased the site from the city in 1926; the Supreme Court initially issued an injunction blocking the lease, but the Appellate Division reversed the injunction. The next year, the New York City Board of Aldermen blocked a proposal for the city to either sell the land or convert it into some &quot;public use&quot;.

Auditore and Shea operated the parking lot until 1933, when their lease was canceled because they could not afford to pay $26,000 a year. Although the Park Association of New York City suggested that the site be converted back into a public park, the city leased the parking lot to Irving Rosoff in February 1933. City park commissioner Robert Moses canceled Rosoff&#x27;s lease the next year. By 1935, the city planned to rebuild Dreamland as an recreation center with courts for handball, ping-pong, and shuffleboard, as well as a large open field for archery and other games. In addition, the recreation center was to contain more than 600 trees, as well as a connection to the Riegelmann Boardwalk, which was built along the Atlantic Ocean shoreline after Dreamland had been destroyed.

The city government first considered relocating the New York Aquarium to the Dreamland site in 1941 after the closure of Castle Clinton, the aquarium&#x27;s previous home in Manhattan. Although plans for the new aquarium were announced in 1943, it did not open until 1957. The New York Aquarium occupies the entire Dreamland site. A bronze bell, which had been installed on Dreamland&#x27;s pier until the 1911 fire, was recovered from the Atlantic Ocean in 2009. According to Charles Denson of the Coney Island History Project, the bell was the only surviving major remnant of Dreamland&#x27;s pier.

== Description ==
The park was on a parcel between Surf Avenue to the north, West 5th Street to the east, the Atlantic Ocean to the south, and West 10th Street to the west. At its peak, Dreamland had 14,000 employees and could accommodate at least 100,000 guests at once. Everything in Dreamland was reputed to be bigger and more wide-ranging than in neighboring Luna Park. Dreamland had a larger central tower and one million electric light bulbs illuminating and outlining its buildings, four times as many lights as Luna Park. An individual connected with the Edison Company said in 1903 that Dreamland&#x27;s lighting contract was &quot;the largest contract for lighting ever made in the United States, and I believe in the world&quot;. Dreamland&#x27;s illumination cost $4,000 a week; it cost $100 a night just to light the central tower.

Manhattan-based architectural firm Kirby, Petit &amp; Green designed Dreamland&#x27;s buildings. The structures were generally painted in light colors. At the time of the park&#x27;s opening, the buildings were reported to be clad with artificial stone, and of asbestos fireproofing and of utility pipes were used. However, the frames of the buildings were made of lath (thin strips of wood) covered with staff (a moldable mixture of plaster of Paris and hemp fiber). Consequently, the entire park was highly susceptible to fire. Throughout most of Dreamland&#x27;s history, the attractions were painted white with small touches of green or yellow; the exception was the 1911 season, when the buildings were all repainted red and white. Dreamland advertised itself as an educational attraction, as symbolized by its main entrance, which contained a female representation of education.

=== Layout and attractions ===
The park was arranged roughly as a horseshoe, with a pier facing south toward the Atlantic Ocean. Several rides were imitations of Luna Park&#x27;s, such as a submarine ride and a Shoot-the-Chutes replica. Multiple buildings, such as the Pompeiian, Electricity, and Submarine Boat buildings, were dedicated to exhibits. New attractions were added every season. To facilitate circulation, the paths were designed with gentle slopes and few steps.

==== Entrance and lagoon ====
Dreamland&#x27;s primary landside entrance was on Surf Avenue, where there was an arch measuring deep, high, and wide; the portal was intended to resemble a theater&#x27;s proscenium arch. There were several smaller, similarly designed portals along Surf Avenue. Guests paid a ten-cent entry fee to pass through the gates, then paid an additional fee for the attractions.

At the park&#x27;s center was a lagoon surrounded by a promenade. Originally, Dreamland&#x27;s operators had planned to install flood gates that allowed salt water into the lagoon during high tide. The lagoon measured wide and long, spanned by a large pedestrian bridge at its southern end. The footbridge over the lagoon had ornate columns with glass globes, as well as carved lions on either end. There was a miniature railway underneath the promenade. The side shows were arranged around the lagoon. Kirby, Petit &amp; Green designed the buildings around the lagoon in numerous architectural styles that complemented each other, in contrast to Luna Park. A hippodrome track was built around the lagoon in 1906. The track was replaced with bathhouses by 1910, and a pergola was also constructed on the lagoon&#x27;s shore.

At the northern end of the lagoon was the Beacon Tower, a French Renaissance-style edifice measuring square at its base and approximately tall. The tower&#x27;s gold-and-white facade contained large arches; bas-reliefs carved by Perry Hinton; and 100,000 electric lights. Elevators transported visitors to the roof, which was decorated with a ball and eagle. The tower contained water-storage tanks with a capacity of . An attraction called Hiram Maxim&#x27;s Airships was added just north of the tower in 1905; it consisted of airships that were hung from a tower.

==== East side ====

On the north side of the park, to the left of the Surf Avenue entrance, was a medieval-style entrance with a show called Our Boys in Blue. Another structure, just south of Our Boys in Blue, hosted an illusion presented by Ben Morris. Just right of the entrance, at the park&#x27;s northeast corner, was Bostock&#x27;s wild animal exhibit, housed in a Grecian-style structure with motifs of wild animals. Next to this structure was another edifice that contained the Chilkoot Pass attraction, which was essentially a massive bagatelle board where guests used their own bodies to play the game. The Chilkoot Pass building was situated within a classical-style structure whose main entrance resembled a proscenium arch. The Haunted Swing and Funny Room were housed within a Mission Revival-style building next to the Chilkoot Pass. South of that was a fishing pond operated by comedian Andrew Mack, located inside a building that resembled a boat and a lighthouse.

East of the lagoon, next to the fishing pond, was an imitation of Venice made of papier-mâché; it featured canals with gondolas, as well as a replica of Doge&#x27;s Palace. The latter building housed the Canals of Venice ride, which contained additional replicas of various Venetian landmarks. Next to the Doge&#x27;s Palace was a scenic railway called Coasting Through Switzerland, which ran through a Swiss alpine landscape. The scenic railway building was designed in the Art Nouveau style, with a golden proscenium arch measuring wide and high. Attached to Coasting through Switzerland was a structure housing the Fighting the Flames show, where two thousand people pretended to put out a fire every half-hour. The show building, measuring , was meant to resemble a seven-story hotel and several small stores; it was replaced in 1906 by a show themed to that year&#x27;s earthquake in San Francisco.

==== West side ====
Near the park&#x27;s southwest corner was a human zoo called the &quot;Lilliputian Village&quot;, designed as an imitation of a 15th-century German village. It was populated by three hundred little people, who had their own livery tent, stable, laundry, and fire department. Next to the Lilliputian Village was the Destruction of Pompeii, a Greek-style structure with an exhibit that displayed the eruption of Mount Vesuvius in 79 AD. An adjacent structure, the Electricity Building, had a facade that depicted machinery; the building contained the park&#x27;s actual mechanical plant. A third structure, next to the Pompeian and Electricity buildings, housed a submarine ride called Over and Under the Sea; the submarine ride was replaced in 1905 by the Hell Gate boat ride, which featured a whirlpool. LaMarcus Adna Thompson&#x27;s Thompson Scenic Railway, which predated the park, was accessed via an Art Nouveau-style structure.

The attractions on the southwestern corner of the park were replaced in 1907 with the Orient attraction, which consisted of a massive staff arch measuring high, as well as a series of structures surrounding a theater. In addition, in 1909, Gumpertz added a &quot;Filipino village&quot; which featured two hundred Igorot hunters.

A building with baby incubators, designed as a German farmhouse, was at the park&#x27;s northwest corner. The lower half of the building was clad in brick. By contrast, the upper half had a timber facade and a tiled gable roof. The baby-incubator building cared for and exhibited premature babies, including triplets who were members of the Dicker family. At the time, the technology was not allowed in hospitals, but the incubators were allowed in side shows; two of the triplets survived to adulthood. Yet another building housed Wormwood&#x27;s Dog and Monkey Show, housed in a building that was decorated with motifs of monkeys and dogs.

==== Oceanfront ====
Dreamland&#x27;s oceanfront pier contained a structure with a restaurant and a ballroom. The ballroom was supposedly the largest in New York state at the time of its construction; it spanned , with dimensions of about , and was surrounded by a balcony. The ceiling of the ballroom measured high and had 10,000 lightbulbs. Adjoining the ballroom was the restaurant, measuring . The lower part of the structure was a ferry landing with booths and small shows. When Dreamland opened, the landing was served by ferry lines to Harlem, 23rd Street, and the Battery in Manhattan; the ferry rides cost up to 35 cents, but that price included admission. The lower deck of the pier was known as the Bowery, a replica of Manhattan&#x27;s Chinatown, which the &quot;Times Union&quot; described as a place where &quot;the lid will be off&quot;. The adjoining segment of the Coney Island Beach was originally a private beach.

The oceanfront featured a Japanese building, a two-story structure capped by a central tower, which led to an airship attraction and some tea rooms. The airship attraction was an exhibition of Santos-Dumont Airship No. 9. Another show, called the Seven Temptations of St. Anthony, was targeted toward male guests. At the foot of the park&#x27;s lagoon were two Shoot-the-Chutes with two ramps that could handle 7,000 hourly riders. Two boats, each carrying 20 people, slid down the ramps, which extended into the ocean. Another oceanfront attraction was the Leap-Frog Railway, a switchback railway-style attraction on a pier, where two 40-person carts were accelerated toward each other at high speed before passing each other at the last second.

=== Concessions ===
In a bid for publicity, Reynolds awarded a concession for the park&#x27;s peanut-and-popcorn stands to Broadway actress Marie Dressler, with young boys dressed as imps in red flannel acting as salesmen. Dressler may have been in love with Captain Jack Bonavita, Dreamland&#x27;s one-armed lion tamer. Bonavita, who commanded lions in the Bostock animal arena, had one arm amputated after his hand was severely clawed by one of the lions and a blood infection spread through that hand.

== Impact ==
When Dreamland opened, the &quot;New-York Tribune&quot; wrote: &quot;Nothing but a personal visit and inspection can do anything like justice to the subject.&quot; A writer for &quot;The Brooklyn Daily Eagle&quot; called Dreamland &quot;a city of amusement in itself&quot;, which was successful because of &quot;the intelligent use of unlimited money expended for the best interest of unnumbered patrons in search of innocent amusement&quot;. During its last full season of operation, in 1910, a writer for &quot;Billboard&quot; said: &quot;It&#x27;s a great big Dreamland this year, and it&#x27;s good clean through&quot;. The writer Marcia Reiss wrote in 2014 that the park was a &quot;dazzling white city&quot;, calling it &quot;Coney Island&#x27;s grandest and shortest-lived amusement park&quot;. The design of Dreamland also inspired the creation of similar amusement parks around the world, such as Magic-City in Paris.

The park has been depicted in various works of popular culture. Artist Philomena Marano created a body of work inspired by the park in the papier collé method, American Dream-Land. Brian Carpenter wrote a play treatment which he used as a springboard for lyrics and compositions behind his second studio album for Beat Circus entitled &quot;Dreamland&quot;. The album featured Todd Robbins, an alumnus of Coney Island, and its booklet includes historical images of Dreamland donated by the Coney Island Museum. The Public Theater also staged the play &quot;Fire in Dreamland&quot; in 2018, which is based on the park&#x27;s 1911 conflagration.

<text>A medical identification tag is a small emblem or tag worn on a bracelet, neck chain, or on the clothing bearing a message that the wearer has an important medical condition that might require immediate attention. For emergency medical providers such as paramedics and emergency physicians, medical identification tags are particularly useful in situations where the wearer is unconscious, altered mental status, very young, or otherwise unable to provide critical medical information. The tag is often made out of stainless steel or sterling silver. A wallet card with the same information may be used instead of or along with a tag, and a stick-on medical ID tag may be added or used alone.

A type of medic identification alert is the USB medical alert tag, essentially a USB flash drive with capacity to store a great deal of emergency information, including contacts and medical conditions. This information is accessible by any computer with a USB port. However, the practical effectiveness of such a system is limited in many cases by medical computer systems that restrict the use of USB devices which may carry malware. It is also possible that a device carried by an unconscious person may not be their own, or not be up to date, with concomitant risks to health and legal liability of medical personnel.

Another new type of medic identification alert is QR code based medical alert stickers. The QR code on the sticker links to a web service that contains the individual&#x27;s emergency information. The information is accessed by any first responder or emergency personnel by scanning the QR code by using a smartphone. In addition to QR codes there are now products that include an embedded RFID chip that allows a first-responder to simply tap their phone against the device. Since a web service is used to store the information there is normally no limitation of how much information that can be stored.

==Conditions for use==
Typical conditions or prescriptions warranting the wearing of such a tag include but are
not limited to:

* Adrenal insufficiency
* Advance Medical Directives (Do Not Resuscitate, POLST, Lasting Power of Attorney, Living Will)
* Anaphylaxis allergies (food, drug, insect)
* Alzheimer&#x27;s disease
* Angioedema (hereditary)
* Anemia
* Asthma 
* Asplenia
* Autism
* Cerebrovascular incident
* Chemotherapy
* Blood type (rare)
* Dementia
* Diabetic (Type 1 and 2)
* Epilepsy
* Hemodialysis
* Hemophilia
* Hypoglycemia
* Hypopituitarism
* Lamotrigine
* Drug-induced Long-QT syndrome
* Lymphedema risk
* Use of a monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOI) drug, which can interact fatally with epinephrine
* Memory disorders
* Pacemaker or other implantable medical devices
* Porphyria (acute)
* Seizure disorders
* Situs inversus
* Von Willebrand Disease
==Information provided==
In addition to mention of the relevant medical condition(s), the tag may have a telephone number that medical personnel can call for more information, for example that of physician, care-giver or next of kin. Where applicable and provided, the wearer&#x27;s national health service user number can enable access to a more detailed case history. Basically, the medical information tag, engraved with the wearer&#x27;s personal medical problem or history, speak for the wearer when the wearer can&#x27;t. Incidentally and where the symptoms can mislead, such a tag may also be useful as evidence of such a condition to law enforcement personnel.

==Types==

There are various types of medical ID available. The most common form of medical ID is jewelry which provides a logo or inscription indicating a particular medical condition. These medical identification tags can be made out of stainless steel (usually classified as 316L and known as surgical stainless steel), sterling silver or gold. If found by emergency personnel the inscription provides an indication of the wearer&#x27;s special medical needs. Tags are available with pre-engraved conditions or can be custom engraved with your specific medical histories and have the benefit that all information is self-contained and does not require any form of technology to view in case of an emergency.

Another type of medical ID jewelry indicates membership in a medical information organization such as the MedicAlert Foundation, American Medical ID, and StickyJ Medical ID. Such medical ID jewelry includes a member identification number and a toll-free number or URL for medical emergency personnel to obtain full information about the wearer&#x27;s medical conditions, treatment, and history. These organizations maintain a database of medical information on their members and can provide it to medical personnel when requested.

The newest technology allows the user to carry stickers with an NFC Tag. A similar technology allows the user to carry stickers with a QR code. By scanning the NFC Tag or the QR code with a smartphone, you will reach the stored medical alert information. Modern mobile phones typically have a facility to gain access to the owner&#x27;s medical emergency information (only) from the lock screen.

Silicone bracelets, preprinted with a general medical condition or allergy, are also popular. The lack of personalization may be a deterrent. Recently patients have begun to tattoo their medical condition on their wrist or arm, but if the individual&#x27;s medical condition changes the tattoo would have to change as well. A temporary tattoo might work just as well as a permanent tattoo. Other items include stick on tags that stick onto a driver&#x27;s license, wallet, or cell phone which are practical for the person who does not want to carry something extra advertising their medical condition. However, in general, emergency medical personnel are trained to look on the patient&#x27;s wrists for a medical id, and may not look elsewhere.

Another type of medical jewelry is a pendant or wrist strap containing a wireless alert button, also known as a panic button, worn in the home as part of a wireless medical alert system. This type of medical jewelry sends a signal to a dialing console which contacts a monitoring service or directly dials first responders when an emergency occurs.

<text>Jeffrey John Hornacek (; born May 3, 1963) is an American professional basketball coach and a former player who is a coaching consultant for the Utah Jazz of the National Basketball Association (NBA). He previously was the head coach for both the Phoenix Suns (2013–2016) and the New York Knicks (2016–2018). He was also an assistant coach for the Houston Rockets. He played shooting guard in the NBA from 1986 through 2000 and played collegiately at Iowa State University.

==Elementary and high school==
He attended Komarek Elementary School in North Riverside, Illinois, and Gurrie Middle School and Lyons Township High School in La Grange, Cook County, Illinois.

==College==
Hornacek redshirted at Iowa State University (ISU) in 1981; he was a team who played from 1982 to 1986. The son of a high school basketball coach, he became an all-conference player in the Big Eight Conference, playing for coach Johnny Orr. As a point guard he guided the Cyclones to the Sweet Sixteen of the 1986 NCAA tournament. His shining moment came at the Metrodome in Minneapolis when, after first hitting a shot to tie the game and send it to overtime, Hornacek hit the game winning shot in overtime, a 26-foot jumper at the buzzer, to give ISU its first NCAA tournament victory since 1944, beating Miami University, March 14, 1986, 81–79. Two days later, he led the Cyclones to the NCAA Tournament Sweet Sixteen, in a 72–69 upset of second seed Michigan. Orr, who had previously left Michigan to coach at Iowa State, called it the greatest victory of his career. Hornacek left ISU with a Big-8 record of 665 career assists and 1,313 career points. He was the fourth player in Cyclone basketball history to have his number retired when his No. 14 jersey was hung from the rafters of Hilton Coliseum in 1991.

==NBA career==

===Phoenix Suns===

He was the 22nd pick in the second round (46th overall) of the 1986 NBA draft, by the Phoenix Suns. The 2nd round draft pick that was used to select him was traded three times before finally ending up with the Suns. First, the Los Angeles Lakers packaged it in the deal to acquire Byron Scott from the San Diego Clippers before the 1983–84 season. A week later, the Clippers sent the pick to the Detroit Pistons in a deal to acquire Ricky Pierce, and on that same day, the Pistons dealt the pick to the Suns for David Thirdkill.

The Suns struggled in Hornacek&#x27;s first two seasons, but after hiring Cotton Fitzsimmons as a coach and acquiring free agent Tom Chambers, the Suns went from 28 wins in 1987–88 to 55 in 1988–89. Hornacek was a &quot;third option&quot; on offense after Chambers and Kevin Johnson. This trio led the Suns to four straight NBA playoff appearances, including two Western Conference Finals. In the 1991–92 season, he led the Suns in scoring average (20.1 points per game) and earned an All-Star appearance. Hornacek won NBA Player of the Month honors in December 1991.

===Philadelphia 76ers===
In 1992, Hornacek was traded (along with Andrew Lang and Tim Perry) to the Philadelphia 76ers for Charles Barkley. With Hersey Hawkins, the Sixers&#x27; leading scorer, in the shooting guard position, Hornacek was assigned point guard responsibilities. Although he had a career high 6.9 assists per game in his only complete season with the Sixers (1992–93 season), his stint as a point guard was not a success (26 wins, 56 losses). Midway through the 1993–94 season (February 24) he was traded to the Utah Jazz (for Jeff Malone) where he could return to his natural shooting guard position alongside John Stockton.

===Utah Jazz===
Like in Phoenix, Hornacek was a complementary &quot;third option&quot; to Karl Malone and Stockton. He was an instrumental part of the Jazz&#x27;s drive to the NBA Finals in 1997 and 1998, where the Jazz lost to the Chicago Bulls both times. He remained with the Jazz until knee problems forced his retirement in 2000. It was revealed that he has no left meniscus due to wear and tear on his body, so bad that he could have needed knee reconstruction because it also is arthritic.

On November 23, 1994, he set a then-NBA record with eight consecutive three-pointers in a single game against the Seattle SuperSonics. That same season, he also tied an NBA record 11 consecutive three-pointers, from December 30, 1994, through January 11, 1995. One of the best free throw shooters in the league, once making 67 in a row (November 12, 1999 – January 6, 2000), one of his most well-known mannerisms was stroking the side of his face three times before every free-throw attempt. That was his way of saying hello to his three children, Tyler, Ryan and Abigaile, during the game. He holds a career free throw percentage of 87.7, 16th highest in NBA history.

Hornacek won the NBA three-point competition twice, and along with Natalie Williams, star of the Utah Starzz, won the All-Star 2-Ball Challenge.

After the 1999–2000 season, Hornacek retired from basketball to spend more time with his family. Hornacek&#x27;s No. 14 jersey was retired by the Utah Jazz, for whom he played from 1994 to 2000, and helped get them to the NBA Finals in 1997 and 1998. Coach Jerry Sloan and Jazz announcer &quot;Hot Rod&quot; Hundley referred to Hornacek affectionately as &quot;Horny&quot;. All in all, Hornacek enjoyed a 14-year NBA playing career including 1,077 career games played.

==Coaching career==
He was hired for the 2007–08 season by the Jazz as a special assistant coach and to help Andrei Kirilenko and others with their shooting. In May 2008 Hornacek interviewed for a coaching position with the Chicago Bulls, meeting with general manager John Paxson. He put off seeking a coaching position until his children were older so the extensive travel would not put excess pressure on his family. After the departure of Jerry Sloan and Phil Johnson in February 2011, Jeff Hornacek became a full assistant coach with the Utah Jazz.

During 2013, Hornacek was considered a head coach candidate for two of his former teams, the Philadelphia 76ers and the Phoenix Suns, as well as the Charlotte Bobcats. On May 28, 2013, he was named the head coach of the Phoenix Suns. Hornacek has stated that his coaching style is reminiscent to that of Cotton Fitzsimmons and Sloan, who both coached him back when he played for the coaches&#x27; respective teams. Hornacek also coached the Suns&#x27; Summer League team during the 2013 season in Las Vegas. In his first game as head coach at the Summer League, he helped lead the team to an 82–69 victory over the Portland Trail Blazers. The Suns went on a six-game winning streak before ultimately losing in the inaugural championship round to the Golden State Warriors 91–77. Hornacek was 5–2 in pre-season and he started the 2013–14 NBA season with a 104–91 victory over the Portland Trail Blazers and an 87–84 victory over the Utah Jazz, both times at home. Hornacek also became the team&#x27;s first ever head coach to start out his coaching stint with a 4–0 record at home games.

Hornacek won the NBA Coach of the Month award in December 2013, his first coaching honor, after leading the Suns to a 10–3 record during the month. Hornacek also became the third former NBA player to win both Player of the Month and Coach of the Month awards (after Larry Bird and Larry Drew), and the first coach to receive both awards with the same team. For the season, the Suns improved by 23 victories upon the previous season&#x27;s record, which led to a 48–34 record in Hornacek&#x27;s first season as a head coach. This accomplishment led to the Phoenix Suns becoming the most improved team during the 2013–14 NBA season. Despite this improvement, the Suns still missed the playoffs. Hornacek was the runner-up coach in the NBA Coach of the Year Award receiving 37 1st place votes. He lost to three-time winner Gregg Popovich.

On February 1, 2016, Hornacek was fired as head coach of the Phoenix Suns after two-and-a-half seasons in the position. On June 2, 2016, the New York Knicks officially announced Hornacek as their new head coach. His first season in New York held a promising enough start, to the point where the team had a 16–13 record early on. However, malcontent surrounding the Knicks between the front office and some of their players resulted in Hornacek having a 31–51 record by the end of the season. On April 12, 2018, the Knicks fired Hornacek after a 29–53 season. On November 30, 2020, Hornacek was hired by the Houston Rockets as an assistant coach.

On September 15, 2022, Hornacek was hired by the Utah Jazz as a coaching consultant.

Hornacek&#x27;s father, John, was a high school coach for basketball and baseball at St. Joseph High School in Westchester, Illinois. Hornacek considers his father, alongside Cotton Fitzsimmons and Jerry Sloan, as an influence towards his coaching career.

Hornacek married his wife Stacy on June 7, 1986. Jeff and Stacy have three children: Ryan (born 1989), Tyler (born 1990) and Abby (born 1994). Abby became a digital host for the online 120 Sports network in 2016, and joined &quot;Fox Nation&quot; in 2019. Jeff has two brothers, one named John, who played his senior season at Lyons Township High School in 1990.

<text>John Whitney Pickersgill (23 June 1905 – 14 November 1997) was a Canadian civil servant and politician. He was born in Ontario, but was raised in Manitoba. He was Clerk of the Privy Council in the early 1950s. He was first elected to federal parliament in 1953, representing a Newfoundland electoral district and serving in Prime Minister Louis St. Laurent&#x27;s cabinet. In the mid-1960s, he served again in cabinet, this time under Prime Minister Lester B. Pearson. Pickersgill resigned from Parliament in 1967 to become the president of the Canadian Transport Commission. He was awarded the highest level of the Order of Canada in 1970. He wrote several books on Canadian history. He died in 1997 in Ottawa.

==Early years==
Pickersgill was born in Wyecombe, Ontario, on June 23, 1905, the son of Frank Allan Pickersgill (1877-) and Sarah Smith (1878-). His parents were born in Ontario. When he was a young child, the family moved to Ashern, Manitoba, where his father was a farmer. John was the older brother of Thomas, Walter, Bessie, and Frank Pickersgill, all of whom were born in Manitoba. He was educated at the University of Manitoba and at the University of Oxford, and he taught history in Winnipeg.

On July 3, 1936, at Emmanuel College Chapel, Toronto, J.W. Pickersgill married Beatrice Landon Young (1913-1938). A graduate of the University of Manitoba, Beatrice was born in Winnipeg, the daughter of Dr. Fred Armstrong Young (1875-1964), MD, and Landon (Wright) Young (1878-1931). The marriage ceremony was attended only by immediate family members. A gravestone in Old Kildonan Cemetery in Winnipeg memorializes the 1938 death of Beatrice, &quot;wife of John W. Pickersgill.&quot;

==Senior civil servant==
He joined the Department of External Affairs in Ottawa and soon worked at the Prime Minister&#x27;s Office as Assistant Private Secretary to Prime Minister William Lyon Mackenzie King. In 1945, he became Special Assistant to the Prime Minister and was officially in charge of the Prime Minister&#x27;s Office. He stayed on to work for King&#x27;s successor, Louis St. Laurent, and became Clerk of the Privy Council in 1952. Pickersgill was a senior and trusted adviser to both Prime Ministers: &quot;Clear it with Jack&quot; was the byword on Parliament Hill for years.

==MP and Cabinet Minister==
Pickersgill entered the House of Commons of Canada as Liberal Member of Parliament (MP) for Bonavista-Twillingate, Newfoundland, after the 1953 election. Pickersgill had become involved in the politics of Newfoundland at the informal request of leading federal politicians in the late 1940s. He was instrumental in supporting Newfoundland&#x27;s pro-Confederation movement although he had no prior connection to the island.

He entered the Canadian Cabinet as Secretary of State for Canada in 1953 and was named Minister for Citizenship and Immigration in 1954. In 1956, when he addressed First Nations at a banquet following a reburial ceremony, he suggested that the First Nations chiefs present should take jobs that would make them independent of government support.

When the Liberal government was defeated in the 1957 election, Pickersgill was re-elected as an MP. He became a leading tormentor of the new government of John Diefenbaker from the opposition benches. With the 1963 election and the coming to power of Lester Pearson as Prime Minister, Pickersgill returned to Cabinet, first as Secretary of State for Canada and Government House Leader and then as Minister of Transport. In 1967, he retired from politics to become president of the Canadian Transport Commission.

==Honours==
He was sworn in as a member of the Queen&#x27;s Privy Council for Canada on 12 June 1953. This gave him the Honorific Prefix &quot;The Honourable&quot; and the Post Nominal Letters &quot;PC&quot; for Life.
On 18 December 1970, he was appointed as a Companion of the Order of Canada and was invested into the order on 31 March 1971. This gave him the Post Nominal Letters &quot;CC&quot; for Life. He was later bestowed the Honorific Prefix &quot;The Right Honourable&quot;, usually reserved in Canada for Prime Ministers, Governors-General and Chief Justices, as recognition of his service.

As a currently serving Member of Parliament He received the Canadian Centennial Medal in 1967. 
As a recipient of the Order of Canada He received the Canadian Version of the Queen Elizabeth II Silver Jubilee Medal in 1977.

He was awarded the Honorary degree of Doctor of Laws (LL.D) by the University of Manitoba on 25 May 1967. He was awarded an Honorary Doctorate by the University of Winnipeg in 1982.

==Writings==
He and D. F. Forster authored the four volumes of &quot;The Mackenzie King Record&quot;, which was based on King&#x27;s diaries. Pickersgill was a literary executor for King&#x27;s diaries. Pickersgill is also the author of three political memoirs — &quot;My Years with Louis St. Laurent&quot; (), &quot;The Road Back&quot; (), and &quot;Seeing Canada Whole&quot; () — as well as a history of the Liberal Party.

<text>Winston Bernard Coard (born 10 August 1944) is a Grenadian politician who served as Deputy Prime Minister in the People&#x27;s Revolutionary Government (PRG) of the New Jewel Movement. In 1983, Coard launched a coup within the PRG and briefly took power until he was himself deposed by General Hudson Austin.

==Education==
Bernard Coard, the son of Frederick McDermott Coard (1893–1978) and Flora Fleming (1907–2004), was born in Victoria, Grenada. He is connected to Grenada&#x27;s prestigious Cenac family: a first cousin of the Honorable Justice Dunbar Cenac (1939–2023) of the Eastern Caribbean High Court, and a nephew of Dennis Vivian Cenac, a former solicitor in the West Indies Associated States Supreme Court.

Coard was attending the Grenada Boys&#x27; Secondary School when he met Maurice Bishop, who was then attending Presentation Brothers&#x27; College. Coard and Bishop shared an interest in left-wing politics from an early age. They became friends and in 1962 they co-founded the Grenada Assembly of Youth After Truth. Twice per month, the two would lead political debates in St. George&#x27;s Central Market Place.

Coard left Grenada for the United States, where he studied sociology and economics at Brandeis University and joined the Communist Party USA. In 1967, he moved to England and studied political economy at the University of Sussex. That year, he married his wife Phyllis while they were students in England, and Coard joined the Communist Party of Great Britain.

==Teaching career==
He worked for two years as a schoolteacher in London and ran several youth organisations in South London. In 1971, he published a 50-page booklet &quot;How the West Indian Child Is Made Educationally Sub-normal in the British School System: The Scandal of the Black Child in Schools in Britain&quot;. It explained that British schools had a pervasive bias toward treating white children as normal, which led to black children being labeled as &quot;educationally subnormal&quot; (learning-disabled). Coard wrote:

The [black] children are therefore made neurotic about their race and culture. Some become behaviour problems as a result. They become resentful and bitter at being told their language is second-rate, and their history and culture is non-existent; that they hardly exist at all, except by the grace of whites.

Coard&#x27;s thesis was widely cited, even long after his revolutionary career, as a summary of the role of institutional racism in the relationship between race and intelligence. In 2005, it was republished as the central article in the collection &quot;Tell it Like it is: How Our Schools Fail Black Children&quot;. A 2021 BBC One documentary &quot;Subnormal: A British Scandal&quot; describes the events surrounding the racism of a leaked school report, leading to the publication of Coard&#x27;s booklet. Produced/directed by Lyttanya Shannon, and executive produced by Steve McQueen, the film features interviews with people who were put into ESN schools, and activists, academics and psychologists and others who worked to expose the scandal at the time, such as Gus John and Waveney Bushell. In a 2021 article, Coard concluded that, 50 years after the ESN scandal was exposed, &quot;the substance ... of the educational suppression of Caribbean-origin children remains&quot;.

After completing his doctorate at Sussex, Coard moved to Trinidad. From 1972 to 1974, he was a visiting lecturer at the Institute of International Relations in the University of the West Indies at St. Augustine, Trinidad and Tobago. He also lectured from 1974 to 1976 at the Mona, Jamaica campus of the University of the West Indies. During his stay in Jamaica, he joined the communist Worker&#x27;s Liberation League and helped draft the League&#x27;s manifesto.

==Revolution==
In January 1974, Coard returned to Grenada which was then in the midst of a popular uprising against the government of Prime Minister Eric Gairy. Coard became active in Grenadian politics. He joined the New Jewel Movement (NJM), the left-wing organization co-founded by his childhood friend Maurice Bishop. Coard ran for and won a parliamentary seat in St. George&#x27;s in the 1976 elections.

The NJM, led by Bishop, successfully carried out a bloodless coup against Eric Gairy&#x27;s government on 13 March 1979. The radio station, military barracks and police stations were targeted. Before long, the revolutionaries had control of the entire island. The NJM then announced the temporary suspension of the constitution and parliamentary rule.

Influenced by Marxists such as Daniel Ortega and Fidel Castro, Bishop established the People&#x27;s Revolutionary Government (PRG) of Grenada with himself as Prime Minister. Aid from Cuba allowed the PRG to build Point Salines International Airport, a new international airport with a runway. In 1980, Coard headed a delegation to Moscow to formalize Grenada&#x27;s relations with the Soviet Union.

==Removal and murder of Bishop==
Bernard Coard served as the PRG&#x27;s Minister of Finance, Trade and Industry, as well as the Deputy Prime Minister under Bishop.

In a factional challenge to Bishop&#x27;s leadership, Coard ordered Bishop to be placed under house arrest on 13 October 1983, and Coard took control of the government. As word spread of Bishop&#x27;s confinement, large demonstrations broke out across the island, including one in the capital that freed Bishop from house arrest. He and the demonstrators made their way to the army headquarters at Fort Rupert (known today as Fort George). However, Bishop and seven others, including several PRG cabinet ministers, were killed soon thereafter, under unclear circumstances, by firing squad in the Fort Rupert courtyard. Coard&#x27;s reign did not last long. He was quickly ousted by General Hudson Austin, who nominally ruled the country for six days.

Just after US Marines landed in Grenada, Coard, along with his wife Phyllis, Selwyn Strachan, John Ventour, Liam James and Keith Roberts, were arrested.

==Trial and prison==
They were tried in August 1986 on charges of ordering the murder of Maurice Bishop and seven others. Coard was sentenced to death, but this was commuted to life imprisonment in 1991. He served his sentence in Richmond Hill Prison, where he was engaged in teaching and instructing fellow inmates in many subjects, including economics and sociology.

In September 2004, the prison in which he was held was damaged by Hurricane Ivan and many inmates took the opportunity to flee, but Coard said he chose not to escape, saying he would not leave until his name was cleared.

==Release==
On 7 February 2007, the London-based Privy Council ordered a re-sentencing of Coard and the others convicted for the 1983 killing of Bishop and some of his cabinet colleagues. The re-sentencing hearing began on 18 June 2007. On 27 June, the judge gave Coard and his fellow defendants a 30-year sentence, which included the time already spent in prison. On 5 September 2009, Coard was released from prison. Upon release he said he did not want to be involved in politics again.

Bernard Coard has three children.

<text>Conrad Kohrs, born Carsten Conrad Kohrs (August 5, 1835 – 23 July 1920) was a Montana cattle rancher (cattle baron) and politician.

==Biography==
He was born in Holstein, a province that was ethnically and culturally German and part of the German Confederation but ruled at the time in personal union by Denmark. At age 15, he went to sea and, over the next 17 years worked as a seaman; a butcher; a sausage salesman; ran log rafts down the Mississippi; and worked in a distillery. He became a U.S. citizen in 1857.

Hearing of gold in California, he traveled first there, then to the Fraser River country of Canada, and finally to the gold camps of Montana Territory in 1862. There, he began to build a fortune, not from mining for gold, but from owning gold camp butcher shops and selling beef to miners.

In 1866, he began a ranching empire by purchasing a ranch near Deer Lodge from former Canadian fur-trader Johnny Grant. Initially, he used it to hold the beef that was supplying his own operations, but eventually built the operation up until, at its peak, it owned 50,000 head of cattle, grazing on 10 million acres (40,000 km²), spread across four states and two Canadian Provinces and shipping 10,000 head of cattle annually to the Chicago stock yards. After the disastrous winter of 1886-1887, during which tens of thousands of head of cattle were lost and which began the death of the open range style of ranching, Kohrs and his half-brother, John Bielenberg, were among the first to recover and adopt more modern methods of ranching; buying purebred breeding stock; fencing ranges; raising and storing feed, etc. Thus he earned the nickname, &quot;Montana&#x27;s Cattle King&quot;.

During his lifetime, he also became involved in politics, first on the local and later on the state level. He was elected a county commissioner in 1869, serving a two-year term. He was a member of the Territorial Assembly of 1885 and, in 1889, he was elected a member of the original Montana State Constitutional Convention (there was another in 1972). He also served as President of the Montana Stockgrower&#x27;s Association. He died on July 23, 1920, on the home ranch at Deer Lodge, aged 84.

== Legacy ==
In 1902, Kohrs and his wife, Augusta, built a library in Deer Lodge for $30,000, as a memorial to their son. The William K. Kohrs Memorial Library is modeled after the Carnegie Libraries. As of 2012, it is &quot;the only dedicated public library in Powell County.&quot;

The home ranch near Deer Lodge, Montana, was held by the family until 1972, when his grandson sold it to the National Park Service. It is now the Grant-Kohrs Ranch National Historic Site.

In 1958, he was inducted into the Hall of Great Westerners of the National Cowboy &amp; Western Heritage Museum.

<doc id="778516" wikidata="Q180694" url="?curid=778516" title="Yuan An">
<text>Yuan An (袁安) (died 9 April 92), courtesy name Shaogong (邵公), was a Chinese politician. At the Han dynasty courts of Emperor Zhang and Emperor He, Yuan was regarded as the founder of the powerful Yuan clan of Runan, one of the leading aristocratic families of the Eastern Han.

== Early life and career ==
Born in Ruyang (), Runan Commandery (near modern Shangshui, Henan province) to a gentry family, Yuan An inherited knowledge in the &quot;Book of Changes&quot; from his grandfather Yuan Liang (), who had reached the position of magistrate around 25. With this learning, Yuan An established a reputation for himself in his native commandery. After some minor clerical experience, he was recommended as &quot;Filially Pious and Incorrupt&quot; by the Magistrate of Ruyang in 60 and travelled to Luoyang to serve at the imperial court. In 62, he left the capital and for the next eight years, he held the relatively insignificant positions of Chief and then Magistrate in the eastern provinces.

On 2 February 71, Yuan An received his first major assignment as Grand Administrator of Chu Commandery, to investigate Liu Ying, the King of Chu, who was accused of heresy and treason, and thousands of locals were accused of being involved in the plot. In Chu, Yuan An saved four hundred innocent households, despite warnings that this act may label him as a &quot;sympathizer of the rebels&quot;. The subsequent administrative and judicial proceedings were regarded with satisfaction by Emperor He. On 18 September 74, Yuan was recalled to the capital to serve as Intendant of Henan, with executive responsibilities in the territory surrounding Luoyang. In this role, the &quot;Hou Han Shu&quot; states that &quot;the masters of the capital respected him and his name weighed heavily at the imperial court.&quot;

== Politics at the capital and the northern frontier ==
On 9 July 83, Yuan An was promoted to become Grand Coachman, with the rank of one of the Nine Ministers. In the succeeding years, Yuan played an active role in discussions at court regarding the stance of the Han Empire toward the Xiongnu peoples of the northern frontier. In a conference in 85, Yuan argued in favour of a more diplomatic policy toward the Xiongnu opposed by Grand Commandant Zheng Hong () and Minister of Works Diwu Lun (). In particular, Yuan An spoke encouragingly about the practice of marriage alliances and the keeping of hostages. The next year, he replaced Diwu Lun as Minister of Works on 3 June and on 31 July 87 was promoted again to become Minister over the Masses.

The death of Emperor Zhang in 88 and the succession of his ten-year-old son Emperor He brought significant changes to the political landscape. The regents of the young emperor, Empress Dowager Dou and her brother Dou Xian, favoured a more militaristic policy to the Northern Xiongnu problem. Both their regional background and position at court encouraged them to seek the expansion of central authority through war. With the Grand Commandant Su You, Minister of Works Ren Wei () and the Nine Ministers, Yuan An marched on the court hall and submitted memorials condemning a campaign in the north. He argued that since the Northern Xiongnu had not invaded the frontier, there was no reason to waste resources on a distant expedition. Despite his strong opposition and that of other conservative advisors, Lady Dou ordered the dispatch of an expeditionary force. In the summer of 89, a Chinese-led force advanced in three columns with minimal opposition and defeated the Northern Shanyu at Jiluo Mountain and pursued him westwards into the Altai ranges. A final offensive in 91 destroyed the Northern Xiongnu, creating a political vacuum in its former territories which the Han empire would struggle to contain in the next two centuries.

Yuan An died on 9 April 92, and was buried on 26 April. A few months later, the Dou clan fell in coup d&#x27;état staged by Emperor He. Yuan was posthumously honoured by the Emperor and his eldest son Yuan Shang () was given a post at the capital. Yuan An&#x27;s two younger sons, Yuan Jing () and Yuan Chang (袁敞), reached the positions of Grand Administrator and Minister of Works respectively. For three generations after this, Yuan An&#x27;s descendants became the leaders of the powerful Yuan clan of Ru&#x27;nan, holding the highest positions in the Han bureaucracy and holding enormous influence among the gentry. During the collapse of the Han empire after 189, his great-great-grandsons Yuan Shao and Yuan Shu formed their own warlord fiefdoms in north China.

== Yuan An stele ==
In 1929, a commemorative stele recording landmarks in Yuan An&#x27;s life was uncovered at Yanshi County, Henan province. It had been erected around 117, about two decades after his death. The stele, 137.5 cm tall and 71.5 cm wide, is now held at Henan Provincial Museum. It provides dates of his appointments and death not found in his official biography in &quot;Hou Han Shu&quot;. It matches a similar stele found in 1923, that of his son Yuan Chang. The two may have originally been erected at the same location.

<text>Michael Ammar (born June 25, 1956) is an American close-up magician. 

==Background==
Ammar was born in Logan, West Virginia. 
His father&#x27;s background was Syrian.

Ammar earned a degree from West Virginia University in business administration in 1978.

==Magician==
In 1982, Ammar competed with magicians from 30 countries to win first prize ex aequo with Aurelio Pavito in Close-up Magic at Lausanne, Switzerland.

During the 1980s he developed a close friendship with his mentor, Dai Vernon (&quot;The Professor&quot;), whose influence is apparent in Ammar&#x27;s performances.

Ammar was the magic week finale on Late Night with David Letterman in 2010 and has made multiple appearances on The Tonight Show. He moved to Los Angeles - where he became a regular performer at the Playboy Mansion, and made appearances on the Merv Griffin Show, The Tonight Show, CNN, and Travel Channel.

Ammar appeared at the Magic Castle in Hollywood.. By 1990, the Academy of Magical Arts in Hollywood had awarded him its &quot;Oscar&quot; in six separate categories (the maximum number of awards for which he is eligible).

He appeared on NBC&#x27;s 1998 &quot;Worlds Greatest Magic 5&quot; special, and has been a guest on the Late Show with David Letterman.

Ammar has made private performances at Universal Studios and the Vatican. He performed and coordinated the magic talent at George W. Bush&#x27;s Presidential inaugural banquet. He was the first featured performer at the &quot;Caesars Magical Empire&quot; at Caesars Palace.

Ammar has performed on television in England, France, Canada, Japan, Sweden, Norway, Australia and Russia.

Ammar&#x27;s work includes the popularization of Topit, with his refinement of Topit technique and inspired a number of close-up magicians to adopt it. He has written &quot;The Topit Book&quot; and made &quot;The Topit DVD&quot;.

==Magic Instructor==
Ammar has been lecturing to other magicians since about 1982.

In 1999, &quot;Magic Magazine&quot; named Ammar as &quot;One of the Most Influential Magicians in the Twentieth Century&quot;.

On August 26, 2010, &quot;Outside&quot; cited Ammar as the &quot;go-to source&quot; for magic instruction. The magazine published a list of &quot;100 Things to Do Before You Die&quot;, and numbered 45 as &quot;Learn a magic trick&quot;—suggesting studying with the master, Michael Ammar.

<doc id="778570" wikidata="Q941931" url="?curid=778570" title="Longford, Tasmania">
<text>Longford is a town in the northern midlands of Tasmania, Australia. It lies 145 m above sea level at the convergence of the Macquarie River and the South Esk River, 21 km south of Launceston and a 15-minute drive from the airport. It is just south of the Illawarra Road, a road connecting the Bass and Midland Highways. It has a population of 3,863 (2016 census) and is part of the Northern Midlands Council area. The region is predominantly agricultural, noted for wool, dairy produce and stock breeding.

==History==

===Pre-European settlement===
The Longford region was the traditional land of The Panninher (par-nin-her) clan of the North Midlands Nation. This clan was known as the Penny Royal Creek Tribe by colonials, named after the old European name for the Liffey River (Aboriginal: Tellerpangger). The Panninher occupied land from Drys Bluff to the Tamar, Evandale and south to the Conara region. The Norfolk Plains region was the site of hunting and the boundary of the Aboriginal road from the Liffey River valley to the Lake River Valley and thence to the Central Highlands.

===Settlement===
In 1806 the first Europeans, Jacob Mountgarrett and Ensign Hugh Piper, passed through the area, and in the following year Lieutenant Thomas Laycock camped near the current site of the town during his overland journey from Launceston to Hobart.

Settlers started to arrive in 1807 as farmers were moved from Norfolk Island to Van Diemen&#x27;s Land (the original name used by Europeans for Tasmania). Governor Macquarie granted land rights to the settlers, who originally called the area &quot;Norfolk Plains&quot;. The town, originally called Latour, grew up around the hotel (later known as the Longford Hotel) which was built in 1827 by Newman Williatt. In 1833 the town was renamed Longford, probably at the suggestion of the land commissioner Roderic O&#x27;Connor.

Settlers used free convict labour to build some fine houses and estates.

Prominent among the early settlers, the Archer family built a number of grand houses and estates in the area. Thomas Archer emigrated from England to Australia in 1811, and retired from government service in 1821 to develop his estate. By 1825 he held in the area and his success persuaded first his brother Joseph, then his brothers Willam and Edward and their father, to join him.

Together they farmed and developed the land, and built a number of homesteads which are among the finest in northern Tasmania: Woolmers Estate, Brickendon Estate (both on the Australian National Heritage List), Panshanger, Northbury, Fairfield, Cheshunt, Woodside, Palmerston and Saundridge. Six generations of Archers have lived in Woolmers, from 1817 to 1994; it is now owned by the Woolmers Foundation Inc and is open to the public.

Norfolk Plains Post Office opened on 1 June 1832 and was renamed &quot;Longford&quot; in 1856.

Adjacent to a 21st-century recreation ground is the remains of a dam. This dam, known as the Longford Mill Dam, was built in the 1840s by John Badcock to power a flour Mill at nearby Newry.

===Historic buildings===


Longford district has many buildings included on the Tasmanian Heritage Register. Many significant historic buildings were constructed between 1830 and 1850, including:
*Christ Church (1839), sandstone, with square tower, lancet windows and buttresses, in the Old Colonial Gothick Picturesque style. The church clock and bell were both gifts from King George IV. The cemetery includes many prominent local families including the Archer, Brumby and Reiby families. The land on which it stands is named Illawarra because of Lucy Margaretta Davey, the daughter of Lt Governor Mad Tom Davey.
*Queen&#x27;s Arms Hotel (1835), a double-storey brick and stuccoed building in the Old Colonial Georgian style
*Blenheim Hotel (1846), a two-storey Georgian brick and stuccoed building and a major townscape element in Longford
*Tattersalls Hotel (now Longford Library) (), a two-storey red brick corner building with neo-classic moulded surrounds to doorways
*The Racecourse Hotel (1838) (former), a two-storey brick Georgian coaching inn, originally built to become the railway station for Longford; has also been a private hospital. It is now a B&amp;B.
*Longford Railway Bridge, a bridge of opened in 1871 and which crosses the South Esk River.

==Facilities==
Longford has a Service Tasmania shop, supermarkets, a bakery, a butcher&#x27;s shop, two banks, a post office, antique shops, hotels, cafés, take-aways, hairdressers and service stations. A kindergarten and large primary school provide education for younger children; secondary students travel to the District High School in Cressy or to one of the schools in Launceston.

The town has a sports centre and a bowls club. Two local bus companies provide transport to school and to Launceston. Longford public library is part of the State Library of Tasmania&#x27;s statewide public library network and is open every weekday.

Healthcare is provided by local doctors and dentists. Toosey Memorial Hospital provided private healthcare from the 1920s and became a public hospital in 1950. However, in 1990 it became a residential care centre for elderly people, and the nearest hospital is now in Launceston.

Tasmania is the only Australian state that has banned the use of Hormonal Growth Promotants (HGPs) in cattle, so the plant guarantees its products are free of HGP.

Selborne Biological Services runs a biotechnology manufacturing facility in Longford, producing bovine serum and other blood products such as polyclonal antisera and protein fractions, destined for the biotech, pharmaceutical, veterinary, and diagnostics industries. They take advantage of the fact that Tasmania is free of BSE and scrapie. For the same reasons, International Therapeutic Proteins has farms with manufacturing facility for antitoxins and other biologics in Longford.

Koppers Inc has a wood treatment plant in Longford. The company produces treated wood poles, piling timbers and other timber for outdoor use.

The Longford Racecourse is the oldest continuously operating racecourse in Australia. Longford is home to many horse studs and training facilities, and the Longford races are held annually on New Year&#x27;s Day, with thoroughbred horse racing and the Elders Webster Longford Cup.

===Longford Show===
The annual Longford Show was first held in 1858 and is one of the longest running rural shows in Australia. Held in October, it attracts between 7000 and 8000 people. It includes equestrian events, poultry and dog shows, chopping and tree felling, sheep and fleeces, rides and games, as well as displays of artwork from local schools.

===Longford motor racing circuit===

<text>Willie M. Pickett (December 5, 1870 – April 2, 1932) was an African American cowboy, rodeo performer, and actor. In 1972, he was the first African American man inducted into the National Rodeo Hall of Fame. In 1989, Pickett was inducted into the ProRodeo Hall of Fame.

==Personal life==
Pickett was born in the Jenks Branch community of Williamson County, Texas, in 1870. (Jenks Branch, also known as the Miller Community, is in western Williamson County, five miles southeast of Liberty Hill, and near the Travis County line.) He was the second of 13 children born to Thomas Jefferson Pickett, a former enslaved man, and Mary &quot;Janie&quot; Gilbert. Pickett had four brothers and eight sisters. The family&#x27;s ancestry was African-American and Cherokee. By 1888, the family had moved to Taylor, Texas.

In 1890, Pickett married Maggie Turner, the formerly enslaved daughter of a white southern plantation owner. The couple had nine children.

==Career==
Pickett left school in the fifth grade to become a ranch hand; he soon began to ride horses and watch the Texas Longhorn steers of his native Texas.
He invented the technique of bulldogging, the skill of grabbing cattle by the horns and wrestling them to the ground. It was known among cattlemen that, with the help of a trained bulldog, a stray steer could be caught. Bill Pickett had seen this happen on many occasions. He also thought that if a bulldog could do this feat, so could he. Pickett practiced his stunt by riding hard, springing from his horse, and wrestling the steer to the ground. Pickett&#x27;s method for bulldogging was biting a cow on the lip and then falling backward. He also helped cowboys with bulldogging. This method eventually lost popularity as the sport morphed into the steer wrestling that is practiced in rodeos.

Pickett soon became known for his tricks and stunts at local country fairs. With his four brothers, he established The Pickett Brothers Bronco Busters and Rough Riders Association. The name Bill Pickett soon became synonymous with successful rodeos. He did his bulldogging act, traveling about in Texas, Arizona, Wyoming, and Oklahoma.

In 1905, Pickett joined the 101 Ranch Wild West Show that featured the likes of Buffalo Bill, Will Rogers, Tom Mix, Bee Ho Gray, and Zach and Lucille Mulhall; he performed under the name &quot;The Dusky Demon.&quot; Pickett was soon a popular performer who toured around the world and appeared in early motion pictures, such as a movie created by Richard E. Norman. Pickett&#x27;s ethnicity resulted in his not being able to appear at many rodeos, so he often was forced to claim that he was of Comanche heritage in order to perform. In 1921, he appeared in the films &quot;The Bull-Dogger&quot; and &quot;The Crimson Skull&quot;.

==Death==
In 1932, after having retired from Wild West shows, Bill Pickett was kicked in the head by a bronco. After a multi-day coma he died on April 2, 1932; he was buried on the 101 Ranch. He is buried near a 15-foot stone monument to the friendship of Ponca Tribal Chief White Eagle and the Miller Brothers on Monument Hill, also known as the White Eagle Monument to the locals, less than a quarter of a mile to the northeast of Marland, Oklahoma.

==Legacy==

In 1972, Pickett was inducted into the National Rodeo Hall of Fame of the National Cowboy and Western Heritage Museum. In 1989, Pickett was inducted into the ProRodeo Hall of Fame.

Concert promoter Lu Vason founded the Bill Pickett Invitational Rodeo in 1984. The touring rodeo celebrates Black cowboys.

In 1987, a statue of Pickett performing his signature &quot;bulldogging&quot; maneuver, made by artist Lisa Perry, was presented to the city of Fort Worth, Texas by the North Fort Worth Historical Society. The statue is installed in the Fort Worth Stockyards Historic District.

The United States Postal Service chose to include Bill Pickett in the Legends of the West commemorative sheet unveiled in December 1993. One month later, the Pickett family informed the Postal Service that the likeness was incorrect. Its source material was a misidentified photograph of Bill Pickett&#x27;s brother and fellow cowboy star, Ben Pickett. In October 1994, the USPS released corrected stamps based on the poster for &quot;The Bull-Dogger&quot;.

In March 2015, the Taylor City Council announced that a street that leads to the rodeo arena will be renamed to honor Bill Pickett.

On June 2, 2017 a new statue of Bill Pickett was unveiled in his hometown of Taylor, Texas. It is prominently displayed at the intersection of 2nd and Main Streets in the downtown.

On August 6, 2018, Bill Pickett was inducted into the Jim Thorpe Association&#x27;s Oklahoma Sports Hall of Fame.
A hill in Burnet County, Texas was named for Pickett in 2021. A trail with an interpretive sign in Georgetown, Texas honors Pickett.

==In popular culture==
In the 2021 film &quot;The Harder They Fall&quot; directed by Jeymes Samuel, a fictional character, a gunman named Bill Pickett, is played by actor Edi Gathegi. In the related film &quot;They Die by Dawn&quot; (2013), a character named Bill Picket is portrayed by Bokeem Woodbine.

Pickett is referenced in season 4 episode 5 of &quot;Baywatch&quot; when the African-American cop character played by Gregory Alan Williams wants to ride a horse to capture criminals, bringing up that Pickett was the &quot;first cowboy.&quot; Pickett is referenced in the 1996 film &quot;Get on the Bus&quot; as the man who created steer wrestling. In the 1994 feature film &quot;The Cowboy Way&quot;, Bill Pickett is referenced by Ernie Hudson when discussing famous black cowboys. He is later referred to as &quot;William Pickett&quot; by Woody Harrelson.

<doc id="778605" wikidata="Q198984" url="?curid=778605" title="Ono no Komachi">
<text>was a Japanese waka poet, one of the &quot;Rokkasen&quot;—the six best waka poets of the early Heian period. She was renowned for her unusual beauty, and &quot;Komachi&quot; is today a synonym for feminine beauty in Japan. She also counts among the Thirty-six Poetry Immortals.

== Life ==
Almost nothing of Komachi&#x27;s life is known for certain, save for the names of various men with whom she engaged in romantic affairs and whose poetry exchanges with her are preserved in the &quot;Kokin Wakashū&quot;. She was probably born between 820 and 830, and she was most active in composing poetry around the middle of the ninth century.

Extensive study has gone into trying to ascertain her place of birth, her family and so on, but without conclusive results. The Edo-period scholar Arai Hakuseki advanced the theory that there was more than one woman named Komachi and that the legends about her referred to different people. This theory was later expanded to conjecture that there were four &quot;Komachis&quot;. It has been conjectured that she was a in the service of Emperor Ninmyō, and when the latter died in 850 she started relationships with other men.

According to one tradition, she was born in what is now Akita Prefecture, daughter of Yoshisada, Lord of Dewa. The Noh play &quot;Sotoba Komachi&quot; by Kan&#x27;ami describes her as &quot;the daughter of Ono no Yoshizane, the governor of Dewa&quot;. Her social status is also uncertain. She may have been a low-ranking consort or a lady-in-waiting of an emperor.

The headnote to poem #938 in the &quot;Kokinshū&quot; implies she had some sort of connection to Fun&#x27;ya no Yasuhide.

=== Legends ===
 had developed as early as the eleventh century. They were later used extensively by the writers of Noh plays.

Stories abound of Komachi in love. One of the legends about her is that she was a lover of Ariwara no Narihira, her contemporary poet and also a member of the Rokkasen. It has been speculated that this legend may derive from the perhaps-accidental placement of one her poems next to one of Narihira&#x27;s.

Another group of legends concern her cruel treatment of her lovers, notably Fukakusa no Shōshō, a high-ranking courtier. Komachi promised that if he visited her continuously for a hundred nights, then she would become his lover. He visited her every night, regardless of the weather, but died on the ninety-ninth night.

A third type of legend tells of an aged Komachi, forced to wander in ragged clothes, her beauty faded and her appearance so wretched that she is mocked by all around her, as punishment for her earlier mistreatment of her lovers. Yet another group of legends concern her death, her skull lying in a field; when the wind blows through the skull’s eye socket the sound evokes Komachi&#x27;s anguish.

A different categorization system for Komachi legends was given by Masako Nakano. She gives five groupings:
:#
:#

== Poetry ==
Almost all of Komachi&#x27;s extant poems are melancholic. Poet and translator Kenneth Rexroth and Ikuko Atsumi said of her poetry:

Her beauty may be legendary but her rank as one of the greatest erotic poets in any language is not. Her poems begin the extreme verbal complexity which distinguishes the poetry of the &quot;Kokinshū Anthology&quot; from the presentational immediacy of the &quot;Man&#x27;yōshū.
Most of her waka are about anxiety, solitude or passionate love. In the &quot;Kokinshū&quot;, all but one of her poems—the one that later appeared in the &quot;Hyakunin Isshu&quot;, quoted below—were classified as either &quot;love&quot; or &quot;miscellaneous&quot; poems. She is the only female poet referred to in the of the anthology, which describes her style as &quot;containing naivety in old style but also delicacy&quot;.

One of her poems was included as #9 in Fujiwara no Teika&#x27;s &quot;Ogura Hyakunin Isshu&quot;:

The poem was originally included in the &quot;Kokinshū&quot; as #133, in the section dedicated to seasonal (spring) poetry. The poem is filled with many layers of significance, with almost every word carrying more than one meaning. It was the subject of a short essay appended to Peter McMillan&#x27;s translation of the &quot;Ogura Hyakunin Isshu&quot;.

In his &quot;Seeds in the Heart&quot;, translator, critic and literary historian Donald Keene said that &quot;[t]he intensity of emotion expressed in [her] poetry not only was without precedent but would rarely be encountered in later years. […] Komachi&#x27;s poetry, however extravagant in expression, always seems sincere.&quot; He also praised her poetry along with that of the other poets of the “dark age” of waka in the ninth century in the following terms:

The passionate accents of the waka of Komachi and Narihira would never be surpassed, and the poetry as a whole is of such charm as to make the appearance of the &quot;Kokinshū&quot; seem less a brilliant dawn after a dark night than the culmination of a steady enhancement of the expressive powers of the most typical Japanese poetic art.
== Legacy ==
The many legends about her have made her the best-known of the Rokkasen in modern times. Until relatively recently, when the title &quot;Miss XYZ&quot; became common in Japan, the woman considered most beautiful in such-and-such town or region would be dubbed &quot;XYZ Komachi&quot;. She and her contemporary Ariwara no Narihira are considered archetypes of female and male beauty, respectively, and both feature heavily in later literary works, particularly Noh plays.
Komachi features frequently in later-period literature, including five Noh plays: &quot;Sotoba Komachi&quot;, &quot;Sekidera Komachi&quot;, &quot;Ōmu Komachi&quot;, &quot;Sōshi Arai Komachi&quot; and &quot;Kayoi Komachi&quot;. These works tend to focus on her talent for &quot;waka&quot; and her love affairs and the vanity of a life spent indulging in romantic liaisons. Komachi&#x27;s old age is also frequently portrayed: when she has lost her beauty, has been abandoned by her former lovers, and now regrets her life, wandering around as a lonely beggar woman — albeit still appreciated by young admirers of her poetry. This fictional description is influenced by Buddhist thought and there may be no factual resemblance between it and the historical reality. Komachi is also a frequent subject of Buddhist paintings, which depict her dead body in successive stages of decay to emphasize transience.

Mishima Yukio reworked &quot;Sotoba Komachi&quot; for the modern theater, publishing his version in January 1952. It was first performed the following month. The basic plot (the age-worn former beauty encounters a young poet and relates some of her life&#x27;s story, which causes him to fall in love with her, with fatal results) is retained, but the action takes place in a public park, with flashbacks to the salons and ballrooms of Meiji-era Japan. An English translation by Donald Keene was published in 1967.

The play &quot;Three Poets&quot; by playwright Romulus Linney includes a one act story about Komachi the poet.

In her honor, the Akita Shinkansen is named &quot;Komachi&quot;. A variety of rice, Akita Komachi, also bears her name.

<text>New Norfolk ( ; Leenowwenne/palawa kani: &quot;wulawali&quot;) is a riverside town located on the River Derwent in southeastern Tasmania, Australia. Established in 1807, it is Tasmania’s fourth-oldest European settlement and ranks as the twelfth oldest in Australia. Initially founded by evacuees from Norfolk Island,
New Norfolk has a population of 6,153 as of 2021 and serves as the main township of the Derwent Valley region. It lies northwest of Hobart, along the Lyell Highway, and is encompassed within the Greater Hobart statistical area.

Historically, New Norfolk’s economy has been shaped by agriculture, especially hop farming, and the timber industry. The Boyer Mill, a major paper producer, is now the sole manufacturer of newsprint, magazine, and book paper in Australia.
Recent years have seen significant development in the area, including the $500 million residential and community project, The Mills.

Tourism has also grown as a key industry, with visitors attracted to the town&#x27;s natural beauty and colonial heritage. Notable landmarks include St. Matthews Anglican Church, Tasmania’s oldest,
and The Bush Inn, one of Australia’s oldest continuously operating hotels.
Nearby attractions include the Salmon Ponds, established in 1861, which is the oldest trout hatchery in the southern hemisphere.

In August 2024, shipbuilder Incat announced plans to expand to a new site in Boyer to build battery-electric ferries, including the world’s largest electric ferry. This project is expected to create up to 1,000 jobs over the next decade, with construction beginning in 2026.

==History==

The Leenowwenne people, among five Aboriginal tribes in the Big River district, inhabited the area that is present-day New Norfolk. Aboriginal Tasmanians arrived in Tasmania around 40,000 years ago during the last glacial period, utilising a land bridge known as the &quot;Bassian Plain&quot; between southern Victoria (from Wilsons Promontory to Cape Otway) and the northern Tasmanian shores (from Cape Portland to Cape Grim). As the glacial period ended, rising sea levels submerged the Bassian Plain, forming Bass Strait, which isolated Tasmanian Aboriginal peoples from mainland Australia for approximately 8,000 years before the arrival of Europeans.

In 1793, explorer John Hayes led the first European exploration of the New Norfolk area, navigating the River Derwent aboard the &quot;Duke of Clarence&quot; and the &quot;Duchess of Bengal&quot;. When the river became too shallow for his vessels, Hayes rowed to a spot just upstream from the present site of New Norfolk.

===Resettlement of Norfolk Islanders===

Following the closure of the penal settlement on Norfolk Island, almost half the population of Norfolk Islanders were relocated to Van Diemen&#x27;s Land. Between 29 November 1807 and 2 October 1808, 544 soldiers, convicts and free settlers were relocated to the settlement of present-day New Norfolk. Many of the free Norfolk Islanders were from farming families, offered land grants in Tasmania as compensation for their relocation.

The climate was colder than sub-tropical Norfolk Island, which proved a challenge for the hardy pioneers during the first few years, but eventually the district became self-supporting. In 1825 the original name of the town, Elizabeth Town, was changed to New Norfolk in honour of their former home.

Many founding folk were &quot;First Fleeters&quot;, transferred from Sydney to Norfolk Island when it was settled just a few weeks after Sydney. Ten First Fleeters are buried in the Methodist Chapel at Lawitta, New Norfolk. Notable is Betty King, née Elizabeth Thackery, a first fleet convict girl who married at New Norfolk on 28 January 1810. The headstone on Betty&#x27;s well-tended grave reads, &quot;The first white woman to set foot in Australia&quot; from the First Fleet at Sydney Cove. She is also believed to be the last surviving First Fleeter, male or female, when she died at 89 years of age on 7 August 1856. Her husband was Marine Private Samuel King of the First Marine Regiment, another First Fleeter who arrived aboard the warship &quot;Sirius&quot;. Sam King was the last male &quot;First Fleeter&quot; to survive until 21 October 1849, aged 86 years. Nine other First Fleeters were Ellen Guy (née Wainright), James Bryan Cullen, William Dempsey, William Edmunds, William Foyle, Abraham Hand, Stephen Martin, John Ruglass, and Edward Westlake.

The pioneers were successful farmers of the rich land around the town. Initially cattle and sheep were predominant, with some cropping as land was cleared. Hop plants were introduced in 1846, and became an important crop. A number of hop drying kilns or oast houses remain in the area including those at Glen Derwent (built by Cullen) and Valleyfield.

===The Mapleys in New Norfolk===
Richard Mapley (born 1810) of Great Linford moved to Tasmania in 1845, with his wife Fanny and children Joseph, Joshua, Jane, Sarah, Fanny, Mary Anne, Hannah and Thomas joining him in 1849.

They initially settled in Hobart, before moving to New Norwalk/Lachlan up the Derwent River 20 miles from Hobart. New Norfolk, the 3d. planned settlement in Tasmania, had been established in the early 1810&#x27;s, also known as &quot;The Hills&quot; because of its hills, valleys and gentle streams. The stream &quot;Thames&quot; was renamed &quot;Lachlan&quot; after Governor Macquarie. Richard died there 2 years later in 1851, but his children populated the area to the extent that Mapley Road in Lachlan, 4 km. south of New Norfolk, is named after the early families.

===First road in Van Diemen&#x27;s Land===
In March 1818, former convict Denis McCarty proposed the construction of a road connecting Hobart Town and New Norfolk to Lieutenant Governor Sorell. This initiative aimed to open up the valley district and facilitate swifter responses to bushranger activities. Initially, McCarty suggested rebuilding a carriage road from New Town to Austins Ferry, extending it to New Norfolk in exchange for a land grant. McCarty sought compensation for the 546 pounds worth of goods lost during bushranger raids by securing the road construction contract. To undertake the project, he requested 15 convicts on government provisions for a year, eight bullocks with a cart, a sleeping tent, and road-making tools.

Although McCarty&#x27;s initial offer was declined, Sorell later reconsidered and invited McCarty to submit a quote for a wide carriage road from Hobart Town to Austin&#x27;s Ferry and a carriage road to the Falls in New Norfolk. Despite the absence of a formal contract, McCarty proceeded with three additional convicts and of duty-free rum as compensation for the extra labor. The Hobart Town Gazette observed, &#x27;On Wednesday last, Mr. Dennis McCarty commenced the undertaking, under an agreement with the Government, of opening a road from Hobart Town (via New-town and Austin&#x27;s farm) to New Norfolk. As this road includes communication with the populous village of New-town and forms the initial ten miles (to the ferry) of the principal road to Port Dalrymple, it is expected to greatly benefit the settlement&#x27;.

By June 1819, McCarty reported the completion of the road and sought his reward. In response, Governor Sorell appointed a committee of officers, including Major Thomas Bell, Engineer and Inspector of Public Works, Thomas Archer, and George W. Evans, Deputy Surveyor, to survey and assess the road. The committee found the road in poor condition, lacking adequate drainage and culverts, containing numerous tree stumps, and featuring poorly constructed bridges deemed &#x27;impassable for cattle or carts and even dangerous for single horses&#x27;.

===Willow Court===
Willow Court, a notable site in New Norfolk, was established in 1827 by Governor George Arthur as an extension of the New Norfolk Asylum, making it one of Australia’s oldest mental health institutions. Initially constructed to house convicts deemed mentally ill, the facility later expanded its role to care for individuals with mental and intellectual disabilities.

The Willow Court compound played a significant role in Australia&#x27;s mental health care system for over 170 years until its closure in 2000. The site has a complex history, marked by changing attitudes toward mental health care. Conditions at Willow Court, particularly in its earlier years, were often harsh, with patients subjected to outdated and inhumane treatments.

Situated outside the town&#x27;s centre, Willow Court is bound by Humphrey Street to the west, George Street to the north, and the Avenue, as well as the southern-flowing Lachlan River, a branch of the River Derwent. The site features 23 buildings and landscape elements across approximately . 
Architecturally, the site features a range of historical buildings, including the Barracks (the original building), which has been preserved. The complex also has later additions built in various architectural styles reflecting the evolving function of the institution. Operating as large antiques centre, today Willow Court is regarded as a heritage site, with ongoing efforts to preserve and redevelop parts of it for tourism, community use, and historical interpretation.

The site’s history evokes mixed reactions, as it is a reminder of the darker aspects of mental health treatment but also offers a rich cultural and historical resource. Willow Court is also rumoured to be haunted, and its past has made it a focal point for ghost tours and paranormal investigations.

===Terence MacManus===
For some years after 1848, New Norfolk was the place of exile of the Irish nationalist leader Terence MacManus. His cottage &quot;Kilburn Grange&quot; still stands. Later he was joined by his fellow Irish rebel, William Smith O&#x27;Brien, who lived at Elwin&#x27;s Hotel (now known as Glen Derwent).

===Derwent Valley Railway===
The Derwent Valley Railway, a heritage narrow-gauge railway based in New Norfolk, Tasmania, was originally opened by Tasmanian Government Railways in 1887. The line, initially 18 km from Bridgewater to New Norfolk, was extended multiple times, eventually reaching 74 km to Kallista by 1936, primarily serving rural and logging areas. Traffic increased significantly in 1940 with the opening of the Boyer paper mill.

After sections of the line began closing in the mid-20th century, floods in 1995 led to the line’s closure beyond New Norfolk. The Derwent Valley Railway Preservation Society, formed in 1990, reopened parts of the line for heritage passenger trains until 2005, when Pacific National halted operations. The society is currently negotiating to restore tourist train services.

===Plaza Theatre===
In 1932, Mrs. R. M. Hall built the Plaza Theatre on the corner of High and Charles Streets, New Norfolk, for £A2,200. Her late husband, Mr. P. Hall, had initiated regular film screenings in the area 24 years earlier. After his death, Mrs. Hall continued the business, introducing sound films. Designed by Hobart architects Rodway and Butler, the brick theatre featured a cantilever verandah and replaced a fifty-year-old wooden structure. The theatre was officially opened by Mr. T. Andrews on 9 December 1932.

Originally seating 500 to 600 people, including 165 in the gallery, the theatre&#x27;s raked floor provided clear views of the stage, and it was equipped with advanced sound and cinematograph technology. Renovations in 1940 increased seating capacity to 650, but by 1971, it was reduced to 250, with only balcony seating in use. In March 1986, a new projection box was added, along with a side entrance to the auditorium, while the rear stalls and foyer were converted for retail use. By 2016, the building had become a Terry White Chemist.

===Boyer Mill===

The Boyer Paper Mill, established at nearby Boyer, is a significant industrial site that has played a major role in the region&#x27;s economy since its opening in 1941. Operated by Norske Skog, the mill primarily produces newsprint and other publication-grade paper. It is notable for being the first mill in the southern hemisphere to manufacture paper from plantation-grown radiata pine, which marked a shift towards using more sustainable, locally sourced raw materials.

Boyer&#x27;s establishment contributed to Tasmania’s industrial growth and provided employment opportunities for the surrounding communities. Over the decades, it has adapted to changes in the paper industry, including modernisation efforts to improve efficiency and environmental sustainability. The mill has been integral in supplying paper for newspapers across Australia and the Asia-Pacific region.

Despite challenges posed by the decline in print media, Boyer continues to operate, focusing on innovation and maintaining its role as a key economic driver in the Derwent Valley. The mill also plays a part in the region&#x27;s broader vision to develop new industries, such as renewable energy and advanced manufacturing, to ensure long-term sustainability.

==Tourism==

New Norfolk is a central tourism hub in the upper Derwent Valley, offering easy access to nearby attractions like Mount Field, Lake Pedder, Strathgordon, Gordon Dam hydroelectric site, and the South West Wilderness. The town&#x27;s Tourist Information Centre, staffed by volunteers, is located on Circle Street, adjacent to the Council Chambers.

In 2021, New Norfolk won the &quot;Top Tourism Town&quot; award from the Tourism Industry Council Tasmania, spotlighting its reputation as a growing destination. The town is also known for its premium wine and produce, with The Agrarian Kitchen being named Restaurant of the Year at the 2024 Gourmet Traveller Restaurant Awards—the first Tasmanian venue to receive the honour in the event’s 45-year history.

Historical properties like Glen Derwent and Tynwald have been repurposed as bed-and-breakfast accommodations, tea rooms, restaurants, and wedding venues, adding to the town&#x27;s appeal. Notable historic residences, such as Glen Derwent, Stanton, and Valleyfield, remain intact and contribute to the town’s charm. Woodbridge on the Derwent, a heritage-listed Georgian mansion built in 1825, now operates as a luxury hotel, attracting international guests despite its location near a busy highway. The mansion was originally constructed by convicts for Captain Roadknight, the first Constable of what was then Elizabeth Town, before passing to William Sharland, the assistant surveyor of Van Diemen&#x27;s Land. Sharland built the first wooden bridge across the Derwent near Woodbridge, with the original Tollhouse by the Blair Street Bridge still standing as a historical reminder.

New Norfolk is also known as the &quot;antiques capital of Tasmania,&quot; with numerous antique shops, including a large complex in the historic Willow Court precinct. This blend of natural beauty, history, and premium offerings has made New Norfolk a growing centre of tourism in Tasmania.

==Demographics==
New Norfolk’s demographics highlight its status as a typical Tasmanian regional town, with a predominantly older, working-class population engaged in traditional industries, and a relatively affordable cost of living compared to Hobart.

New Norfolk’s urban centre had a population of approximately 6,153 at the . Including the surrounding suburbs and rural areas, classified as Statistical Areas Level 2 (SA2s), the broader population representing the greater community totals 7,293 residents. The majority of residents are of English (41.1%) and Australian (36.2%) ancestry. 6.2% of New Norfolk’s population identifies as Aboriginal Australians or Torres Strait Islander. Nationally, this figure was 3.2%, meaning New Norfolk has a higher proportion of Indigenous residents compared to the Australian average, which reflects broader regional trends where Indigenous populations tend to be more concentrated in certain rural and regional areas than in major cities.

Nearly half (47.6%) report no religious affiliation, while Anglicanism remains a common religion (16.5%). The median age in New Norfolk is 40, higher than the national median of 38, indicating a generally older population. A significant portion of the population is over 55 years, reflecting a trend common in many regional Tasmanian towns.

In the 2021 Census, New Norfolk&#x27;s median weekly household income was $1,107. This figure is lower than the national median of $1,746, reflecting the town&#x27;s regional economy, where incomes tend to be lower compared to urban centres. The lower income levels are likely influenced by the dominant local industries, including agriculture, forestry, and retail, which typically offer lower wages than professional and technical fields more common in cities. New Norfolk&#x27;s unemployment rate sat at 6.8%, which is slightly higher than the national unemployment rate of 5.1%.

Home ownership rates in New Norfolk are higher than in major cities, with affordable property prices attracting families and retirees. The median house price is considerably lower than in Hobart, making it an attractive option for those seeking more affordable living conditions. The town has several local schools providing primary and secondary education, but there is a tendency for students to commute to Hobart for higher education or more specialised schooling.

==Climate==
New Norfolk is the warmest area of Tasmania during summer afternoons and has a cool temperate oceanic climate that is classified as &quot;Cfb&quot; under Köppen Climate Classification.


==Access==

New Norfolk is situated on the Lyell Highway, the primary east-west route in southern Tasmania, connecting Hobart to Strahan on the west coast. As the sole major east-west highway in southern Tasmania, the Lyell Highway plays a central role in linking New Norfolk with other parts of the island. The town is approximately from Hobart Airport and well-connected with regular bus routes operated by Metro Tasmania.

Historically, New Norfolk was served by passenger rail, freight rail and barge services along the River Derwent. The town was a key point on the Tasmanian Government Railways network, with the former branch line extending from the Main Line at Boyer to New Norfolk. The Bridgewater Bridge served as an important transportation marker, routinely used by the Australian Newsprint Mills to transport paper via water on barges to Hobart until 1984, when river transportation ceased.

<text>J. Lawrence Cook (July 14, 1899 – April 2, 1976) was an American pianist. His output has been estimated at between 10,000 and 20,000 different roll recordings.

Cook was born in Athens, Tennessee, the son of a preacher. He was orphaned before his fourth birthday, and raised by relatives who introduced him to music, in particular his grandmother who brought him to the church where she played pump organ. He went on to become the most famous name in the history of the music roll industry.

The young black pianist arrived in New York in March 1920 and recorded some rolls for the US Music Roll Company. In May 1923, he was engaged by the QRS Music Roll Company (QRS Records), where he remained for nearly 50 years.

As a result of his prolific output, he also used pseudonyms and some roles were released under names such as Sid Laney, &quot;Pep&quot; Doyle, and Walter Redding. He also produced some rolls that were marketed as being played by Fats Waller.

Cook was known to produce over two piano rolls each day, along with his other jobs, such as at the B.A.B Organ Company.

J. Lawrence Cook&#x27;s arranging piano is on display at the American Treasure Tour in Oaks, Pennsylvania.

==Work at B.A.B Organ Company==
Cook, along with his piano rolls, also produced band organ rolls for the B.A.B Organ Company. In an interview with Cook in the 1970s, he was the sole arranger for B.A.B, which had produced over 800 master rolls at the time of its closure. Some of Cook&#x27;s arranging for B.A.B. was never released, and is in storage in Virginia City, Montana.

The organ scales that Cook arranged for included, but are not limited to:
* 46 Key Scale
* 61 Key Scale (for Artizan D band organs)
* 66 Key Scale
* 82 Key Scale
* 87 Key Scale
Cook&#x27;s work is identifiable by its switching between the counter melody (trumpet) and melody sections to play the melody, and is also known for &quot;borrowing&quot; notes from other sections to create a more chromatic scale.

His work has also been transcribed to the three standardized Wurlitzer band organ scales by the Play-Rite Music Co. with 46-key arrangements being transcribed to 125, 48-key to 150, and 66-key to 165, and along with being heard on Artizan and converted European organs, can also be commonly heard on Wurlitzer band organs, such as the Wurlitzer 165 at Glen Echo Park.

==Recordings==
In 1950 and 1951, Cook made phonograph records for the Abbey label, always billed as &quot;Lawrence (Piano Roll) Cook&quot; and sometimes accompanied by a small jazz combo. Most of his selections were ragtime and Tin Pan Alley standards (&quot;Tiger Rag&quot;, &quot;Dizzy Fingers&quot;, etc.) as well as novelty songs (&quot;How Many G&#x27;s in Peggy, Paw?&quot;). In addition to his work as the featured artist, Cook was the pianist for vocalists Jerry Cooper and Dorothy Loudon, who also recorded for Abbey. Cook&#x27;s Abbey records were issued in Canada under the Quality label.

<text>The laws of thermodynamics are a set of scientific laws which define a group of physical quantities, such as temperature, energy, and entropy, that characterize thermodynamic systems in thermodynamic equilibrium. The laws also use various parameters for thermodynamic processes, such as thermodynamic work and heat, and establish relationships between them. They state empirical facts that form a basis of precluding the possibility of certain phenomena, such as perpetual motion. In addition to their use in thermodynamics, they are important fundamental laws of physics in general and are applicable in other natural sciences.

Traditionally, thermodynamics has recognized three fundamental laws, simply named by an ordinal identification, the first law, the second law, and the third law. A more fundamental statement was later labelled as the zeroth law after the first three laws had been established.

The zeroth law of thermodynamics defines thermal equilibrium and forms a basis for the definition of temperature: if two systems are each in thermal equilibrium with a third system, then they are in thermal equilibrium with each other.

The first law of thermodynamics states that, when energy passes into or out of a system (as work, heat, or matter), the system&#x27;s internal energy changes in accordance with the law of conservation of energy.

The second law of thermodynamics states that in a natural thermodynamic process, the sum of the entropies of the interacting thermodynamic systems never decreases. A common corollary of the statement is that heat does not spontaneously pass from a colder body to a warmer body.

The third law of thermodynamics states that a system&#x27;s entropy approaches a constant value as the temperature approaches absolute zero. With the exception of non-crystalline solids (glasses), the entropy of a system at absolute zero is typically close to zero.

The first and second laws prohibit two kinds of perpetual motion machines, respectively: the perpetual motion machine of the first kind which produces work with no energy input, and the perpetual motion machine of the second kind which spontaneously converts thermal energy into mechanical work.

== History ==
The history of thermodynamics is fundamentally interwoven with the history of physics and the history of chemistry, and ultimately dates back to theories of heat in antiquity. The laws of thermodynamics are the result of progress made in this field over the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. The first established thermodynamic principle, which eventually became the second law of thermodynamics, was formulated by Sadi Carnot in 1824 in his book &quot;Reflections on the Motive Power of Fire&quot;. By 1860, as formalized in the works of scientists such as Rudolf Clausius and William Thomson, what are now known as the first and second laws were established. Later, Nernst&#x27;s theorem (or Nernst&#x27;s postulate), which is now known as the third law, was formulated by Walther Nernst over the period 1906–1912. While the numbering of the laws is universal today, various textbooks throughout the 20th century have numbered the laws differently. In some fields, the second law was considered to deal with the efficiency of heat engines only, whereas what was called the third law dealt with entropy increases. Gradually, this resolved itself and a zeroth law was later added to allow for a self-consistent definition of temperature. Additional laws have been suggested, but have not achieved the generality of the four accepted laws, and are generally not discussed in standard textbooks.

== Zeroth law ==
The zeroth law of thermodynamics provides for the foundation of temperature as an empirical parameter in thermodynamic systems and establishes the transitive relation between the temperatures of multiple bodies in thermal equilibrium. The law may be stated in the following form:
Though this version of the law is one of the most commonly stated versions, it is only one of a diversity of statements that are labeled as &quot;the zeroth law&quot;. Some statements go further, so as to supply the important physical fact that temperature is one-dimensional and that one can conceptually arrange bodies in a real number sequence from colder to hotter.

These concepts of temperature and of thermal equilibrium are fundamental to thermodynamics and were clearly stated in the nineteenth century. The name &#x27;zeroth law&#x27; was invented by Ralph H. Fowler in the 1930s, long after the first, second, and third laws were widely recognized. The law allows the definition of temperature in a non-circular way without reference to entropy, its conjugate variable. Such a temperature definition is said to be &#x27;empirical&#x27;.

== First law ==

The first law of thermodynamics is a version of the law of conservation of energy, adapted for thermodynamic processes. In general, the conservation law states that the total energy of an isolated system is constant; energy can be transformed from one form to another, but can be neither created nor destroyed.

For processes that include the transfer of matter, a further statement is needed.

The First Law encompasses several principles:
* Conservation of energy, which says that energy can be neither created nor destroyed, but can only change form. A particular consequence of this is that the total energy of an isolated system does not change.
* The concept of internal energy and its relationship to temperature. If a system has a definite temperature, then its total energy has three distinguishable components, termed kinetic energy (energy due to the motion of the system as a whole), potential energy (energy resulting from an externally imposed force field), and internal energy. The establishment of the concept of internal energy distinguishes the first law of thermodynamics from the more general law of conservation of energy. formula_1
* Work is a process of transferring energy to or from a system in ways that can be described by macroscopic mechanical forces acting between the system and its surroundings. The work done by the system can come from its overall kinetic energy, from its overall potential energy, or from its internal energy. For example, when a machine (not a part of the system) lifts a system upwards, some energy is transferred from the machine to the system. The system&#x27;s energy increases as work is done on the system and in this particular case, the energy increase of the system is manifested as an increase in the system&#x27;s gravitational potential energy. Work added to the system increases the potential energy of the system.
* When matter is transferred into a system, the internal energy and potential energy associated with it are transferred into the new combined system. formula_2 where denotes the internal energy per unit mass of the transferred matter, as measured while in the surroundings; and denotes the amount of transferred mass.
* The flow of heat is a form of energy transfer. Heat transfer is the natural process of moving energy to or from a system, other than by work or the transfer of matter. In a diathermal system, the internal energy can only be changed by the transfer of energy as heat: formula_3

Combining these principles leads to one traditional statement of the first law of thermodynamics: it is not possible to construct a machine which will perpetually output work without an equal amount of energy input to that machine. Or more briefly, a perpetual motion machine of the first kind is impossible.

== Second law ==
The second law of thermodynamics indicates the irreversibility of natural processes, and in many cases, the tendency of natural processes to lead towards spatial homogeneity of matter and energy, especially of temperature. It can be formulated in a variety of interesting and important ways. One of the simplest is the Clausius statement, that heat does not spontaneously pass from a colder to a hotter body.

It implies the existence of a quantity called the entropy of a thermodynamic system. In terms of this quantity it implies that
The second law is applicable to a wide variety of processes, both reversible and irreversible. According to the second law, in a reversible heat transfer, an element of heat transferred, formula_4, is the product of the temperature (formula_5), both of the system and of the sources or destination of the heat, with the increment (formula_6) of the system&#x27;s conjugate variable, its entropy (formula_7):
: formula_8

While reversible processes are a useful and convenient theoretical limiting case, all natural processes are irreversible. A prime example of this irreversibility is the transfer of heat by conduction or radiation. It was known long before the discovery of the notion of entropy that when two bodies, initially of different temperatures, come into direct thermal connection, then heat immediately and spontaneously flows from the hotter body to the colder one.

Entropy may also be viewed as a physical measure concerning the microscopic details of the motion and configuration of a system, when only the macroscopic states are known. Such details are often referred to as &quot;disorder&quot; on a microscopic or molecular scale, and less often as &quot;dispersal of energy&quot;. For two given macroscopically specified states of a system, there is a mathematically defined quantity called the &#x27;difference of information entropy between them&#x27;. This defines how much additional microscopic physical information is needed to specify one of the macroscopically specified states, given the macroscopic specification of the other – often a conveniently chosen reference state which may be presupposed to exist rather than explicitly stated. A final condition of a natural process always contains microscopically specifiable effects which are not fully and exactly predictable from the macroscopic specification of the initial condition of the process. This is why entropy increases in natural processes – the increase tells how much extra microscopic information is needed to distinguish the initial macroscopically specified state from the final macroscopically specified state. Equivalently, in a thermodynamic process, energy spreads.

== Third law ==
The third law of thermodynamics can be stated as:


At absolute zero temperature, the system is in the state with the minimum thermal energy, the ground state. The constant value (not necessarily zero) of entropy at this point is called the residual entropy of the system. With the exception of non-crystalline solids (e.g. glass) the residual entropy of a system is typically close to zero. However, it reaches zero only when the system has a unique ground state (i.e., the state with the minimum thermal energy has only one configuration, or microstate). Microstates are used here to describe the probability of a system being in a specific state, as each microstate is assumed to have the same probability of occurring, so macroscopic states with fewer microstates are less probable. In general, entropy is related to the number of possible microstates according to the Boltzmann principle
: formula_9
where &quot;S&quot; is the entropy of the system, &quot;k&quot;B is the Boltzmann constant, and &quot;Ω&quot; the number of microstates. At absolute zero there is only 1 microstate possible (&quot;Ω&quot; = 1 as all the atoms are identical for a pure substance, and as a result all orders are identical as there is only one combination) and formula_10.

== Onsager relations ==
The Onsager reciprocal relations have been considered the fourth law of thermodynamics. They describe the relation between thermodynamic flows and forces in non-equilibrium thermodynamics, under the assumption that thermodynamic variables can be defined locally in a condition of local equilibrium. These relations are derived from statistical mechanics under the principle of microscopic reversibility (in the absence of external magnetic fields). Given a set of extensive parameters (energy, mass, entropy, number of particles and so on) and thermodynamic forces (related to their related intrinsic parameters, such as temperature and pressure), the Onsager theorem states that
: formula_11
where index every parameter and its related force, and
: formula_12
are called the thermodynamic flows.

<text>Horseshoe Bay is a community of about 1,000 permanent residents in West Vancouver, in the Canadian province of British Columbia. Situated on the western tip of West Vancouver at the entrance to Howe Sound, the village marks the western end of Highway 1 on mainland British Columbia (and furthermore the main route of the Trans-Canada Highway on the Canadian mainland). It also serves as the southern end of the Sea-to-Sky Highway, with Lions Bay just 15 minutes north.

Horseshoe Bay is the location of the third-busiest BC Ferries terminal, the Horseshoe Bay ferry terminal. Because of the presence of the ferry terminal, it is considered a control city on the Upper Levels Highway westbound.

<text>Penguin is a town on the north coast of Tasmania, Australia. It is in the Central Coast Council local government area and on the Bass Highway, between Burnie and Ulverstone. At the , Penguin had a population of 4,132.

==History==
Penguin was first settled in 1861 as a timber town, and proclaimed on 25 October 1875. The area&#x27;s dense bushland and easy access to the sea led to Penguin becoming a significant port town, with large quantities of timber shipped across Bass Strait to Victoria, where the 1850s gold rushes were taking place. The town was named by the botanist Ronald Campbell Gunn for the little penguin rookeries that are common along the less populated areas of the coast.

Sulphur Creek Post Office opened on 1 January 1867 and was replaced by the &quot;Penguin Creek&quot; office in 1868. The latter office was renamed &quot;Penguin&quot; in 1895.

Penguin was one of the last districts settled along the North West coast of Tasmania, possibly because of an absence of a river for safe anchorage. Nearly all travel in those days was by boat as bush made the land almost impenetrable. Many of the settlers probably emigrated from Liverpool via landing in Launceston then sailing west along the coast.
Trade began when the wharf was built in 1870, allowing timber and potatoes to be exported. Penguin Silver Mine, along the foreshore slightly to the east of the town opened in 1870 but failed a year later. Neptune Mine, a tad further along, likewise failed.
The rail from Ulverstone arrived in 1901, after which trade by sea declined. Passing of the Local Government Act in 1906 saw Tasmania divided into 48 Municipalities.

Penguin’s first Council was elected in 1907, and the early stages of the municipal council were seen as benefiting the community. It was not until 1993 that the council was amalgamated with the Ulverstone council to form the Central Coast Council.

==Aboriginal history of the area==
Approximately 12,000 years ago the peninsula/island of Tasmania was separated from mainland Australia. By European arrival in 1803 some 4,000-5,000 semi-nomadic Aboriginal people continued to manage this diverse and changing landscape, both responding to and manipulating the environment.

There were approximately 48 groups contained within nine socio-linguistic cohorts throughout Tasmania, speaking at least 4 distinct languages. The Northern people comprised 3 or possibly 4 groups, totaling 200-300 people. Their lands extended along the coast from Port Sorell to Penguin, inland to the SE corner of the Surrey Hills then East to the base of the Great Western Tiers near Quamby Bluff before turning north to the coast. Each winter the Northern people abandoned the cold of the Western Tiers and the flooded flats of the Meander Valley and traveled to the coast where they would congregate at sites such as Port Sorell at Panatana. The Northern people also had access to some of the most important ochre deposits in Tasmania. Excavations undertaken during the 1980s at the Gog Range mine, now called Toolumbunner, dated activity at this particular mine site back to the 15th century.

Colonisation of the North and North West of Van Diemen’s Land was a particularly violent process - far away from the scrutiny of the colonial administration in Hobart. Thirty-two significant incidents of violence have been identified between 1826 and 1834, mostly taking place in the 1827/8 period. Twenty-eight people are known to have been captured by Colonial Authorities while eight were kidnapped by sealers. By 1847, when the 47 surviving Aborigines were transferred from Flinders Island to Oyster Cove, there were no Northern people left alive.

==Recent history==
From 2005 to 2008, property developer Stephen Roche failed to expand his ownership of Penguin properties by attempting to purchase properties along the CBD beachfront on Main St with the aim of transforming them into four-storey commercial/residential opportunities. Support for development was mixed, which resulted in the developers foregoing all interest in the seaside town.
One manoeuvre to circumvent development involved heritage-listing as much of the CBD as possible. Currently, Penguin has 30 heritage-listed sites.

In August 2020, a $6.5 million project to protect the Penguin foreshore began. The &quot;Penguin Foreshore Remediation Project&quot; will improve on the preexisting wave-break wall in place, and build new ones in areas not currently covered. The project will also include the building of access ramps and stairs, and a new car park at Lions Park. The project became a matter of urgency after (what is believed to be due to climate change) increased tides caused erosion on the old wall, and in some cases waves crashing onto the main road.

==Education==
The sole public school in Penguin is Penguin District School. The kinder - year 12 school is currently located on two campuses at Ironcliffe Road. Construction on a new single campus, which will host all year levels, is expected to start in October 2020, costing $20 million. The redevelopment is expected to be complete by 2022. Penguin also has one of only two Seventh-day Adventist schools in Tasmania, called North West Christian School which caters for students from Kinder - Year 12.

==Attractions==
The Big Penguin, which Penguin is home to, was made of ferro cement by the Goliath Cement Co of Railton and later coated with fibreglass, is located in the town’s centre opposite the Post Office. Unveiled on 25 October 1975, it was erected to commemorate the centenary of the naming of the town. Concerns were raised in 2008 as to the possibility of asbestos contamination, but the Big Penguin was given the all clear. It is also interesting to note that all street rubbish bins are decorated with ornamental cement fairy penguins.

The town itself sits at the base of the Dial Range, a small mountain range that also borders Riana and Gunns Plains. The four mountains with popular hiking trails within the Penguin vicinity include Mount Montgomery, Mount Dial, Mount Gnomon, and Mount Duncan. The Penguin District School four house names reference the mountains.

Penguin General Cemetery, over looks Bass Strait. Opened in the 1860s, it closed in 1977 and was heritage-listed in 2007.

The response to the cemetery&#x27;s ongoing and widespread publicity was such that the Tasmanian Association for Hospice &amp; Palliative Care (TAH&amp;PC) funded the inaugural Penguin Twilight Celebration of the Dead - music among the tombstones. The event, held in the cemetery on 7 January 2015, was supported by the broader Penguin community. It marked the centenary of the cemetery&#x27;s unknown burial. The celebration culminated in a butterfly release in the commemorative garden dedicated to the tens of unnamed babies in the cemetery. A fund-raising onsite formal long-table dinner was held in February 2016.

In 2018 Penguin launched its heritage sites and other attractions website. Recently the Penguin community dedicated a sculpture to its many unnamed children buried in the cemetery. Children of the World by Bruny Island artist Keith Smith stands in its small commemorative garden.

Each year since 2018 many shops in the CBD decorate themselves in pink; Pink Up Your Town is a fundraising activity for the McGrath Foundation. It also saw the community coming together to revitalise the foreshore under the 7-Day Makeover program, which has continually brightened the town since its inception. Local resident Shirley Good currently organises the event.

Installed in July 2020 is an art piece featuring a mosaic on the front and a word-jumble on the back, celebrating how marginalised people contribute to our communities, despite their struggles. It demonstrates how a sense of community can develop around marginalised people.

2020 also saw the town release its tourist app Ambling among Penguin&#x27;s charms. In 2022 the app was translated into both Traditional and Simplified Chinese. In 2023, a new language, Japanese, was added to the free town walk.

The Penguin General Cemetery app, Stories from Penguin&#x27;s Heritage Cemetery, was launched in February 2022 at an onsite Taiko drumming musical event.

<text>Mulberry Fork is a tributary of the Black Warrior River, long, in the U.S. state of Alabama. The Mulberry Fork is one of three forks, along with the Locust Fork and the Sipsey Fork, that join to form the Black Warrior. It drains part of the southernmost end of the Appalachian Mountains north and west of Birmingham in the drainage basin of the Mobile River.

The Mulberry Fork rises in northeastern Cullman County, south of Arab. It flows in tight meanders along a ridge of the foothills, forming the boundary between Cullman and Blount counties. It receives the Sipsey Fork from the northwest approximately 15 mi (24 km) east of Jasper. In southern Walker County it enters Bankhead Lake reservoir, forming the northernmost arm of the lake, approximately 10 mi (16 km) long. The confluence with the Locust Fork is now submerged within Bankhead Lake, approximately 25 mi (40 km) west of Birmingham.

<text>Philo of Byblos (, &quot;Phílōn Býblios&quot;; ;  – 141), also known as Herennius Philon, was an antiquarian writer of grammatical, lexical and historical works in Greek. He is chiefly known for his Phoenician history assembled from the writings of Sanchuniathon.

==Life==
Philo was born in the 1st century in Byblos in what is now Lebanon. &quot;He lived into the reign of Hadrian, of which he wrote a history, now lost.&quot; His name &quot;Herennius&quot; suggests that he was a client of the &quot;consul suffectus&quot; Herennius Severus through whom Philo may have achieved the status of a Roman citizen.

==Works==

Philo wrote a dictionary of synonyms, a collection of scientific writers and their works organized by category, a catalogue of cities with their famous citizens, and a &quot;Vita&quot; of the Emperor Hadrian. Some of his work is known to us by titles only; others have survived in fragmentary quotes in Christian authors. Among his works were:
*&quot;On the Acquisition and Choice of Books&quot;
*&quot;On Cities and their Famous Men&quot;, epitomized by the grammarian Aelius Serenus, and one of the chief authorities used by Hesychius and Stephanus of Byzantium
*&quot;On Synonyms&quot;, of which there is extant an epitome by Ammonius Grammaticus.
Sanchuniathon was thought by some scholars to be &quot;an imaginary personage, whose name is formed from that of the Phoenician god Sanchon&quot;. However, Edinburgh Professor P. B. R. Forbes wrote that 14th century BC documents from Ugarit, published since 1929, have &quot;proved conclusively that Sanchuniathon is doubtless a verity because of the many correspondences between him and these fresh texts&quot;.

Philo&#x27;s Greek &quot;Phoenician History&quot; was so extensively quoted by Eusebius in his 4th-century work &quot;Praeparatio evangelica&quot; that the fragments have been assembled and translated. Eusebius&#x27;s quotations often have an agenda contrary to Philo&#x27;s original intentions: the sources of Phoenician religion are quoted to disparage. Philo&#x27;s passages show a jumbling together of Phoenician lore with Greek mythology, Zoroastrian beliefs and ancient Egyptian beliefs concerning the ibis-headed god Thoth, who in Philo is called &quot;Taautos&quot; or &quot;Tauthos&quot;. In Philo, as among the ancient Egyptians, Taautos/Thoth is given characteristics that were much argued in the 4th century Christology: &quot;everlasting, unbegotten, undivided&quot;. Allusions to serpent veneration mingled with the cult of Thoth are also found.

According to Eusebius, Philo discovered secret mythological writings of the ancient Phoenicians assembled by the Phoenician writer Sanchuniathon who, according to Eusebius/Philo, transcribed the sacred lore from pillars in the temples of Byblos. Philo also translated all (or some) of the work in his &quot;Phoenician History&quot;. According to Porphyry, Sanchuniathon wrote a history of the Jews based on information derived from Hierombalus (i.e. Jeruba&#x27;al), a Yahwist priest, and dedicated it to Abelbal or Abibal, king of Berytus.

The sequence of the gods and their genealogy among the Phoenicians, as gleaned from Philo&#x27;s quoted fragments, were for long recognized as supporting the general scheme in Hesiod&#x27;s &quot;Theogony&quot;. Names of deities on the cuneiform tablets from Ugarit (modern Ras Shamra, Syria) fall into similar patterns. Compare the genealogical tables at Sanchuniathon.

<text>The Colville River (; Inupiat: &quot;Kuukpik&quot;) is a major river of the Arctic Ocean coast of Alaska in the United States, approximately long. One of the northernmost major rivers in North America, it drains a remote area of tundra on the north side of the Brooks Range entirely above the Arctic Circle in the southwestern corner of the National Petroleum Reserve-Alaska. The river is frozen for more than half the year and floods each spring.The Colville River and its adjacent hills are home to a variety of Arctic wildlife, including Lake Teshekpuk and Central Arctic caribou herds, and hawks.

As of March 2023, the Department of Interior permitted ConocoPhillips to build a new ice road from Kuparuk River Oil Field drill site and use a partially grounded ice bridge across the Colville River near Ocean Point &quot;to transport sealift modules&quot; to its Willow project oil drilling area.

==Location==
It rises on the north slope of the De Long Mountains, at the western end of the Brooks Range, north of the continental divide in the southwestern corner of the National Petroleum Reserve-Alaska. It flows initially north, then generally east through the foothills on the north side of the range, broadening as it receives the inflow of many tributaries that descend from the middle Brooks Range. Along its middle course it forms the southeastern border of the National Petroleum Reserve. At the Iñupiat village of Umiat it turns north to flow across the Arctic plain, entering the western Beaufort Sea in a broad delta near Nuiqsut, approximately 120 mi (190 km) west of Prudhoe Bay.

Measuring about , the river&#x27;s triangular delta includes 34 distributaries, each with its own mouth, at normal water stages. During high water, the number of distributaries may reach 5,000. The largest distributary is the Nechalic Channel, which flows through Nuiqsut.

According to the United States Geological Survey, in 1837 British explorers P. W. Dease and Thomas Simpson named the river for Andrew Colvile, whose last name they spelled &quot;Colville&quot;.

==Geology, infrastructure==
The river valley contains developed and undeveloped petroleum and natural gas deposits. In 2015, construction was completed on a bridge spanning the Colville River north of Nuiqsut, making it the first major river crossing north of the Arctic Circle in North America. The bridge, at a cost of $100 million, gives its owner ConocoPhillips access to petroleum resources further West in the National Petroleum Reserve-Alaska.

==Demographics==

Colville River first appeared on the 1880 U.S. Census as an unincorporated area of Inuit (all 50 reported as such). It did not specify where along the river they settled. It did not report again until 1940 when it was erroneously called &quot;Coleville River&quot; on the census. It also did not specify where the residents lived.

==Wildlife==

The Colville River and its adjacent hills are home to a variety of Arctic wildlife. The Colville runs through the range of the Lake Teshekpuk and Central Arctic caribou herds, making it a landmark and obstacle in one of the world&#x27;s largest animal migrations. It is also home to brown bears and, nearer the Arctic coast, polar bears.

The Colville River has been called &quot;hawk heaven&quot; for its incredible concentration of peregrine falcons, gyrfalcons, and golden eagles. The steep, loose bluffs of the Colville River provide prime nesting habitat for many birds.

==Paleontology==
In 1961, Shell Oil geologist Robert Liscomb discovered dinosaur fossils at multiple locations while surveying the Colville River. However, his discoveries were met with incredulity and suspicion in the paleontology community due to the site&#x27;s extreme northern location, and Liscolm died the following year in a rock slide while continuing his surveying of the Colville. In the mid- to late-1980s, Liscolm&#x27;s notes were rediscovered and paleontologists returned to Liscolm&#x27;s sites only to find many more dinosaur fossils and tracks. Today, the Colville River bluffs are widely recognized as one of the fossil-rich regions in the Arctic, with enormous quantities of Cretaceous dinosaur fossils. Specimens collected on the Colville include theropods, ankylosaurs, albertosaurus, pachyrhinosaurus, gorgosaurus, and hadrosaurs.

Fossils, which are legally described as any sign or remnant of ancient life, may only be collected from public lands with a government-issued permit. Illegally removing fossils from the Colville River, or other public lands, can expose a violator to steep fines or jail time.

==Human activity==
In a region with virtually no roads, the Colville River serves as one of the transportation arteries in the Alaska arctic. In the summer, small motorboats transport indigenous subsistence hunters, paleontologists, geologists, and others working or hunting in the region.

When the river freezes to a suitable thickness during winter, it can be used as an ice road to bring in supplies, as seen during the fourth season of the History Channel series &quot;Ice Road Truckers&quot;.

A very small number of recreational boaters float the Colville annually, though the extreme remoteness, harsh conditions, relative lack of air transportation hubs, and presence of polar bears make recreational boating challenging.

As of March 2023, the Department of Interior permitted ConocoPhillips to build a new ice road from the existing Kuparuk road system at Kuparuk River Oil Field drill site and use a partially grounded ice bridge across the Colville River near Ocean Point &quot;to transport sealift modules&quot; to its Willow project oil drilling area.

<text>The Deaflympics, also known as Deaflympiad (previously called World Games for the Deaf, and International Games for the Deaf) are a periodic series of multi-sport events sanctioned by the International Olympic Committee (IOC) at which deaf athletes compete at an elite level. Unlike the athletes in other IOC-sanctioned events (the Olympics, the Paralympics, and the Special Olympics), athletes cannot be guided by sounds (such as starting pistols, bullhorn commands or referee whistles). The games have been organized by the &quot;Comité International des Sports des Sourds&quot; (CISS, &quot;The International Committee of Sports for the Deaf&quot;) since the first event in 1924.

== History ==
The Deaflympics are held every four years, and are the longest running multi-sport event in history after the Olympics. The first games, held in Paris in 1924, were the first ever international sporting event for athletes with a disability. The event has been held every four years since, apart from a break for World War II, and an additional event, the Deaflympic Winter Games, was added in 1949. The games began as a small gathering of 148 athletes from nine European nations competing in the International Silent Games in Paris, France, in 1924; now, they have grown into a global movement.

Officially, the games were originally called the &quot;International Games for the Deaf&quot; from 1924 to 1965, but were sometimes also referred to as the &quot;International Silent Games&quot;. From 1966 to 1999 they were called the &quot;World Games for the Deaf&quot;, and occasionally referred to as the &quot;World Silent Games&quot;. From 2001, the games have been known by their current name Deaflympics (often mistakenly called the Deaf Olympics).

To qualify for the games, athletes must have a hearing loss of at least 55 dB in their &quot;better ear&quot;. Hearing aids, cochlear implants, and the like are not allowed to be used in competition, to place all athletes on the same level. Other examples of ways the games vary from hearing competitions are the manner in which they are officiated. To address the issue of Deaflympians not being able to be guided by sounds, certain sports use alternative methods of commencing the game. For example, the football referees wave a flag instead of blowing a whistle; on the track, races are started by using a light, instead of a starter pistol. It is also customary for spectators not to cheer or clap, but rather to wave with both hands, the Deaf form of applause.

After the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, the International Committee of Sports for the Deaf (ICSD) banned athletes from Russia and Belarus from that year&#x27;s Deaflympics in Caxias do Sul, Brazil.

To date, the Summer Deaflympic Games have been hosted by 24 cities in 20 countries, but by cities outside Europe on only six occasions (Washington, D.C. 1965, Los Angeles 1985, Christchurch 1989, Melbourne 2005, Taipei 2009 and Caxias do Sul in 2022). The last summer games were held in Caxias do Sul, Brazil and Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia in 2022. The Winter Deaflympic Games have been hosted by 17 cities in 12 countries. The last winter games were held in Erzurum, Turkey in 2024. The next summer games are scheduled to be in Tokyo, Japan between 15 and 26 November 2025.

The 2011 Winter Games scheduled to be held in Vysoké Tatry, Slovakia were cancelled due to the lack of readiness by the organizing committee to host the games. The International Committee of Deaf Sports filed a criminal complaint against the Slovak Deaflympics Organizing Committee and its president, Mr. Jaromír Ruda. The criminal complaint demands reimbursement of the funds that were transferred to the Slovak Deaflympics Organizing Committee from national deaf sports federations, to cover hotel accommodations and other Deaflympics-related expenses. According to the Slovak newspaper, &quot;SME&quot;, &quot;Jaromír Ruda, head of the Slovak Organising Committee, [is] a champion of promises and someone who is accused of a 1.6 million Euro Deaflympics-related fraud&quot;. In a letter to the United States Deaflympians, International Committee of Sports for the Deaf ICSD President Craig Crowley expressed &quot;his deep apologies for the cancellation of the 17th Winter Deaflympics&quot;. Currently, the Slovak Deaflympic Committee and the Slovakia Association of Deaf Sportsmen Unions have been suspended. In 2013 the Special Criminal Court in Banská Bystrica sentenced Ruda to a prison term of years for defrauding €1.6 million that should have been used for Winter Deaflympics.

The host cities and National Deaf Sports Associations for all past and scheduled games are as follows:

==List of Summer Deaflympics hosts==
1 The Republic of China (Taiwan) is recognised as Chinese Taipei by CISS and the majority of international organisations it participates in due to political considerations and Cross-Strait relations with the People&#x27;s Republic of China.

2 The marathon had been held 4 days before the opening ceremonies in Füssen, Germany on 21 July 2013.

3 Due to the COVID-19 global pandemic, the Summer Deaflympics that were to be held in December 2021 were postponed until May 2022, and due to the small number of venues near Caxias do Sul and Brazil and a small number of participants, the bowling events were transferred to Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia and were held between 20 and 30 October 2022.

<doc id="778835" wikidata="Q5175460" url="?curid=778835" title="Cotorreando">
<text>Cotorreando (&quot;chatting&quot; in Spanish) was a daily Spanish language gossip television show that ran on the U.S. Spanish network Telemundo from 2000 to 2007.

==Show==
Cotorreando was established to be in direct competition with Univision&#x27;s &quot;El Gordo y la Flaca&quot;, which had been in production since 1998. It was produced in Miami, Florida. At first shown live, at 4pm EST (and shown recorded at the same time on the West coast), the show&#x27;s producers decided to broadcast it at 12pm live on the East coast and recorded on the West coast, where it would also be shown at 12pm. The change in time slot was because show producers thought that, by getting their daily dose of gossip at an earlier time, television viewers would be uninterested in watching their rival show.

The show has shed light on Hispanic show business scandals, and while many entertainers do not oppose the show (many have actually visited the set), others have objected to being interviewed on camera for &quot;Cotorreando&quot;. Presenter Luisa Fernanda was fired in June 2007 after an interview.

Friday September 28, Telemundo announced that it was cancelling Cotorreando and the final episode of Cotorreando aired that day. Telemundo executives decided to use the time slot for reruns of recent novelas.

<doc id="778846" wikidata="Q8001586" url="?curid=778846" title="Wildwood School">
<text>Wildwood School is an independent progressive K–12 school located in Los Angeles. Wildwood was founded as an elementary school in 1971, by a group of parents led by a young lawyer named Belle Mason. The secondary campus (middle and high school) opened in 2000. The elementary campus is located in Los Angeles and the middle and upper school campus is located in West Los Angeles. There are approximately 300 students in grades K-5, the elementary campus, and 400 in grades 6–12 at the middle and upper school campus.

== History ==

In the 1970s and 1980s, the school was housed in one building on Olympic Boulevard in Santa Monica, where the current campus for New Roads School is located. The first graduating elementary class had only ten students. In 1991 Hope Boyd, previously the Middle School Head of Westlake School for Girls, became the head of Wildwood, and the following year the elementary campus relocated to its current Culver City location. 
During Boyd&#x27;s time in post the number of students doubled. In 1999, the board of trustees decided to create a middle and upper school. The school was to be based on the principles of the Coalition of Essential Schools and teach project-based equitable learning. The middle and upper school opened in 2000 on Olympic Boulevard in West Los Angeles, in a small and limiting former warehouse, with no windows (which has become a subject of humor amongst Wildwood students), mercurial temperature controls, and only 100 students. George Wood, a respected national educator and principal of Federal Hocking High School in Ohio, was the founding director of the secondary school. The full remodeling of the middle and upper school building was finished in 2002.

== Community involvement and internship ==
Part of the curriculum of Wildwood includes working with local social service agencies, including St. Joseph Center and the Westside Children&#x27;s Center. Middle and upper school students are required to participate in these activities during school hours for 3 hours a week. Juniors and seniors must participate in the internship program for four hours a week.

Upper school students also have an opportunity to go on International Community Involvement trips during spring break. Destinations have included Nepal, Uruguay, Guatemala, and Bulgaria.

== Outreach Center ==
In 2001, the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation granted Wildwood the funds to create an Outreach Center. The mission of the Outreach Center is to support the creation, development, and enhancement of small, personalized, learner-centered schools in Southern California and throughout the nation. The center was given a huge boost in 2004, when the Los Angeles Unified School District gave its public schools two years to break down into smaller schools. As a result, Wildwood&#x27;s Outreach Center has held numerous professional development workshops educating public school teachers and administrators on the elements of successful small schools including, Advisory Programs, Project-Based Learning, Habits of Mind and Heart and Portfolios and Exhibitions. In addition, Wildwood School was named a Coalition of Essential Schools mentor school in 2004 - a recognition of Wildwood&#x27;s work with other schools. In 2005, Wildwood received a National Association of Independent Schools Leading Edge award for the outreach work it has done with public and charter schools nationwide.

== Athletics==
The Wildwood Wolves have middle school and high school varsity teams including: Cross Country, Girls Volleyball, Boys/Girls Basketball, Boys/Girls Soccer, Baseball, Swim, and Track and Field. The school offers other sports such as Boys/Girls Tennis, and flag football. A number of Wildwood Varsity High School teams have gone on to CIF playoffs and league championships including Boys Baseball, Boys Basketball, Girls Volleyball, and Boys Soccer. Middle school sports teams have a &quot;no cut&quot; policy and all students are allowed to play. The one exception is the middle school tennis team, with a twelve-people cap. In the elementary school 4th and 5th grade sports are offered. The teams all follow the &quot;no cut&quot; policy.

== Arts==

===Performing Arts===
Wildwood students have performed in a number of plays and musicals since it opened. Students of all ages have had opportunities to act, assistant direct, stage manage, and work on technical elements such as lighting and sound design.

In addition, every spring Wildwood has a repertoire of student-directed plays, in which seniors apply to direct a one-act play of their choice. The performing arts teachers pick four of the applicants to create the repertoire. Students have also written plays in the past.

===Music===
Wildwood&#x27;s music program allows students to experiment with different instruments and to compose their own work. Every year, there is a Wildwood Cabaret, in which students perform music. Additional performances are held by grade level. There is also a music production class for high-school students which allows the students to learn how to use software to produce, mix, and edit music.

===Visual Arts===

At the middle and upper school campus, there is a gallery space, in which students have an opportunity to curate shows of their artwork for anyone who walks in to see.

===Electives===
In addition to the Arts, there are many other electives that high school students can take. These include Technical Theater, filmmaking, Creative Writing, Government and Politics, and Advanced Topics in Math and Science. Wildwood offers a class that mixes Math and Science that is called STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Math). WIE (Wildwood Institute for Entrepreneurship). WISL (Wildwood Institute for Social Leadership). WISRD (Wildwood Institute for STEM Research and Development).

==Notable alumni==

* Ella Emhoff Model/designer; stepdaughter of Kamala Harris, former US Vice President
* Zoe Kazan American actress
* Lewis Pullman American actor
* Amandla Stenberg American actress

<doc id="778848" wikidata="Q2359202" url="?curid=778848" title="Coleus amboinicus">
<text>Coleus amboinicus, synonym Plectranthus amboinicus, is a semi-succulent perennial plant in the family Lamiaceae with a pungent oregano-like flavor and odor. &quot;Coleus amboinicus&quot; is considered to be native to parts of Africa, the Arabian Peninsula, and India, although it is widely cultivated and naturalized elsewhere in the tropics where it is used as a spice and ornamental plant. Common names in English include Indian borage, country borage, French thyme, Indian mint, Mexican mint, Cuban oregano, broad leaf thyme, soup mint, Spanish thyme. The species epithet, &quot;amboinicus&quot; refers to Ambon Island, in Indonesia, where it was apparently encountered and described by João de Loureiro (1717–1791).

== Description ==
A member of the mint family Lamiaceae, &quot;Coleus amboinicus&quot; grows up to tall. The stem is fleshy, about , either with long rigid hairs (hispidly villous) or densely covered with soft, short and erect hairs (tomentose). Old stems are smooth (glabrescent).

Leaves are by , fleshy, undivided (simple), broad, egg/oval-shaped with a tapering tip (ovate). The margins are coarsely crenate to dentate-crenate except in the base. They are thickly studded with hairs (pubescent), with the lower surface possessing the most numerous glandular hairs, giving a frosted appearance. The petiole is . The aroma of the leaves can be described as a pungent combination of the aromas of oregano, thyme, and turpentine. The taste of the leaves is described as being similar to the one of oregano, but with a sharp mint-like flavor.

Flowers are on a short stem (shortly pedicelled), pale purplish, in dense 10-20 (or more) flowered dense whorls (cymes), at distant intervals, in a long slender spike-like raceme. Rachis , fleshy and pubescent. The bracts are broadly ovate, long, acute. The calyx is campanulate, long, hirsute and glandular, subequally 5-toothed, upper tooth broadly ovate-oblong, obtuse, abruptly acute, lateral and lower teeth acute. Corolla blue, curved and declinate, long, tube long. Trumpet-like widened; limb 2-lipped, upper lip short, erect, puberulent, lower lip long, concave. Filaments are fused below into a tube around the style.

The seeds (nutlets) are smooth, pale-brown, roundish flattened, c. .

==Distribution and habitat==
&quot;Coleus amboinicus&quot; is native to Southern and Eastern Africa, (from South Africa (KwaZulu-Natal) and Eswatini to Angola and Mozambique and north to Kenya and Tanzania) the Arabian Peninsula and India, where it grows in woodland or coastal bush, on rocky slopes and loamy or sandy flats at low elevations. The plant was later brought to Europe, and then from Spain to the Americas, hence the name Spanish thyme.

==Research==
In basic research, the effects of the essential oil were tested with other plant essential oils for possible use as a mosquito repellant.

==Uses==
The leaves are strongly flavored. The herb is used as a substitute for oregano to mask the strong odors and flavors of fish, mutton, and goat. It may be batter-fried to make &quot;pakodas&quot; or rasam. In the Caribbean, leaves are commonly used when seasoning meats for its pungent aroma.

Fresh leaves are used to scent laundry and hair. It is also grown as an ornamental plant.

==Phytochemicals==
The main chemical compounds found in the essential oil of &quot;Coleus amboinicus&quot; are carvacrol (28.65%), thymol (21.66%), α-humulene (9.67%), undecanal (8.29%), γ-terpinene (7.76%), &quot;p&quot;-cymene (6.46%), caryophyllene oxide (5.85%), α-terpineol (3.28%), and β-selinene (2.01%). Another analysis obtained thymol (41.3%), carvacrol (13.25%), 1,8-cineole (5.45%), eugenol (4.40%), caryophyllene (4.20%), terpinolene (3.75%), α-pinene (3.20%), β-pinene (2.50%), methyl eugenol (2.10%), and β-phellandrene (1.90%). The variations can be attributed to the methodology used in the extraction process, seasonal variations, soil type, climate, genetic and geographical variations of the plant.

== Cultivation ==
&quot;Coleus amboinicus&quot; is a fast-growing plant commonly grown in gardens and indoors in pots. Propagation is by stem cuttings, but it can also be grown from seeds. In dry climates the herb grows easily in a well-drained, semi-shaded position. It is frost tender (USDA hardiness zones 10–11) and grows well in subtropical and tropical locations, but will do well in cooler climates if grown in a pot and brought indoors, or moved to a warm, sheltered position in winter. In Hawaii and other humid tropical locations, the plant requires full sun. It can be harvested throughout the growing season to be used fresh, dried, or frozen.

* Cuban oregano
* Country borage
* French thyme

<text>The history of [[Buses in Hong Kong|bus transport in Hong Kong]] began with the introduction of the first bus routes in Hong Kong in the 1920s.

==History==
===1920s: The beginning===

Bus transport in Hong Kong was started in the 1920s. Several operators were managing a number of bus routes on both sides of the Victoria Harbour by the end of the 1920s. These included:
*Kowloon Motor Bus
*China Motor Bus
*Hong Kong Tramways
*Hong Kong and Shanghai Hotels
*Aberdeen Kai Fong Hotel
*Hong Kong Hotels

===1930s: Pre-war franchise===
In 1933, bus services were franchised. Rights were given to Kowloon Motor Bus (KMB) on the North side, and China Motor Bus (CMB) on the Island. Other bus companies such as Hong Kong Tramways, Hong Kong &amp; Shanghai Hotels, Hong Kong Hotel and Aberdeen Kai Fong, had to cease operations and their buses sold to the franchised operators.

Records relating to the period before the 1930s are scarce as they were mostly destroyed in World War II, but the surviving photographic and written evidence indicates that an extensive network of buses served both sides of the harbour. Some remote areas of the territory at the time, such as Yuen Long, Fanling and Stanley were also served. Buses of various British bus manufacturers, such as Leyland, Thornycroft and Daimler were present in significant numbers around the territory.

===Early 1940s: During the war===
During the occupation, the Japanese tried to restore bus services to normal levels, but were unsuccessful due to an insufficient supply of fuel and spare parts. The limited resources and buses available for service was also responsible for the reduction in the total number of routes in service, as well as for the re-introduction of horse-driven carts to the territory.

===Late 1940s – 1950s: Post-war expansion (part one)===
When the British returned, they put the restoration of public transport to the highest priority. Before new buses were shipped to Hong Kong, both KMB and CMB had to use modified trucks instead of proper buses to transport passengers. These trucks were phased out by the end of the 1950s. The position eased when KMB took delivery of a batch of 50 single-deck Tilling-Stevens and CMB a further 108 during 1947/48.

The return of large number of people to Hong Kong after the war, and people who wanted to escape from the communists, caused a population boom. As a result, the demand for public transport skyrocketed and larger buses became necessary. Kowloon Motor Bus received 20 Daimler CVG5 double-decker buses in 1949 as a trial (one of the first 4 buses introduced had been preserved by KMB after withdrawal in the early 1980s). They turned out to be an unparalleled success, just like the AEC Regents (RT) in London. More than 1,000 buses in various specifications, including the Daimler Fleetlines, were to follow until the 1970s.

China Motor Bus chose to use more single-deck buses instead. This was because the Gardner engined double-deckers did not perform satisfactorily given the hilly terrain, and population levels on the island were more steady and predictable. The company partnered with Guy in Wolverhampton, England and became the second major buyer of Guy Arab buses – after Wolverhampton Corporation Transport.

===1960s: Post-war expansion (part two)===
A comparison the buses on both sides of the harbour in the 1960s: The KMB buses were larger in capacity with standard engines, while those of CMB were small yet over-powered. While KMB went for 34-foot double-decker buses, CMB chose to buy 36-foot version of Guy Arab, but with only 60% of the capacity of a 34-footer.

The growth of Hong Kong seemed to be out of control and squatter settlements sprang up everywhere. Areas like Wong Tai Sin, Kwun Tong and Chai Wan were developed at a rate that were unparalleled in any other British colony. The bus network had to grow accordingly. KMB started to call for double-deckers longer than 30 feet (after the British lack of regulations); to their dismay, Daimler did not respond and KMB had to buy a number of 34-footers from AEC to provide a decent level of service. Daimler finally regained ground by introducing the 34-foot CVG6 with the Gardner 6LX engine. This model found favour with KMB, which bought about 220 of them. Soon, these behemoths – for their time – were dominating the Kowloon streets, and replaced older Daimlers in outer areas, as well as the Cross-Harbour Tunnel routes later.

Meanwhile, CMB was tackling an equally big problem. On routes 8 and 8A (later to become route 82), buses have to travel up a hill, which includes covering a 1-km road with a gradient of 1:10. However, the small Tilling-Stevens and the Arabs which the CMB deployed were not up to the challenge due to the large population of Chai Wan, and the large double-deckers used by CMB did not have the required engine power. Finally CMB ordered 40 36-foot single-deck buses to shift the working crowds, after considering their early success in Africa. Those single-deckers, however, suffered from the same problem as their African siblings: They were too long, with a 10-foot overhang, 22-foot wheelbase and no upper deck to provide additional strength. The buses literally bent and their tail ends swung up and down. They were used for no longer than 10 years before being cut down to standard 30-foot length and re-bodied.

In 1963, China Motor Bus introduced the first double-decker bus (a Dennis Loline III) on Hong Kong Island, later CMB introduced more double-deckers (Guy Arabs) on routes serving the northern coast of the island.

At that time, even with larger buses and increased ridership, costs were still high. On KMB buses, there were up to four people employed on each bus – a driver, one or two conductors to collect the fares and the last, the gateman, supervised boarding and alighting by opening and closing the gates at each end. CMB buses had two crew on each bus, with the fare collector and the door-keeper being the same person. This level of manning was soon deemed unacceptable and the bus companies replaced manual doors and gates or open platforms with pneumatic doors, which eliminated the need for the gateman. However, there were no layoffs, as both bus companies were expanding and the surplus staff were soon retrained and deployed on new routes.

====1967 Riot and the PLB Detour====

The outbreak of 1967 riots halted the bus services because of the intimidation of the front-line operational staff in the latter part of 1967. Services slowly returned to previous levels in early 1968, but this interruption had given the opportunity for dual-purpose vans to flourish and provide illegal – but at that time, necessary – public passenger services, which were then later to be legalised by a weak Transport Department and become the Public Light Bus.

In 1968, two new towns, Kwun Tong and Tsuen Wan, started flourishing and KMB extended its service by opening a new route 40 to and from these.

===Early 1970s===
As the demand of bus service was increasing and production of front-engine buses in UK was terminated, CMB and KMB acquired a number of second-hand buses such as Leyland Titans and Leyland Atlanteans from UK in the early 1970s.

In 1970, CMB started fitting more powerful engines to its Guy Arab double-deckers, giving them enough power for climbing up slopes and servicing areas such as the Mid-levels. In the same year, CMB also decided to convert its Guy Arab MkV single-deckers to double-deckers after one caught fire in 1968. Some of the short-wheelbase buses were rebodied with low-height double-deck bodies, enabling them to provide service on the Victoria Peak.

In 1971, CMB carried out tests of one-man-operated (OMO) bus with the post of the conductor eliminated. Passengers paid their fare by putting coins into a collection box. The tests were considered successful and so CMB converted all their buses to OMO by 1976. KMB had also likewise started to operate OMO buses since 1972.

In February 1972, CMB received one Daimler Fleetline rear-engine double-decker for evaluation, and subsequently started to introduce more Fleetlines in 1973. KMB also introduced their first Fleetline in 1974.

In August 1972, Cross-Harbour Tunnel connected Kowloon and Hong Kong Island. KMB and CMB jointly operated 3 new routes servicing both sides of the Victoria Harbour. The three routes are:
* 101: Kwun Tong (Yue Man Square) – Kennedy Town,
* 102: Lai Chi Kok – Shau Kei Wan, and
* 103: Wang Tau Hom – Pokfield Road

On 1 April 1974, New Lantao Bus Co.,(1973) Ltd. became the third franchised bus company in Hong Kong.

===Late 1970s: The Fleetline and the Victory===
In the 1970s, CMB and KMB purchased almost 800 Fleetlines. With the new 3+2 seating arrangement in both decks, these Fleetlines could carry more than 120 passengers. Due to the high capacity, the Fleetlines were usually allocated to highly demanded cross-harbour routes.

However, the Fleetlines in Hong Kong were unreliable and poor in climbing slopes, so CMB and KMB had to find the alternatives. CMB evaluated the Ashok Leyland Titan, Scania Metropolitan and Volvo Ailsa B55, but these models were not successful. KMB evaluated the Guy Victory J modified by Bus Bodies (South Africa) Limited and Dennis Jubilant. Later British Leyland reacted by producing the Leyland Victory Mark 2, which was modified from the Victory J chassis and, like the Dennis Jubilant, had high-powered engine and automatic transmission. KMB and CMB purchased large number of Dennis Jubilant and Leyland Victory Mark 2 buses in late-1970s/early-1980s.

In 1975, KMB introduced its coach services, with the aim to attract more wealthy people to travel by coaches instead of driving; the company also introduced two airport coach routes in the same year. 1975 also saw the first overnight routes to be introduced – cross-harbour routes 121 and 122 (now known as routes N121 and N122 respectively), bus-bus interchange was also introduced for the two routes at the toll-plaza of Cross-Harbour Tunnel, the first of such practice in Hong Kong.

CMB introduced two suburban coach routes in 1978, using the first model of second generation rear-engined double-decker (MCW Metrobus) in Hong Kong.

===Early 1980s: Race to the 3-axler, Dragons chasing the Mercedes===

In the early 1980s, CMB and KMB acquired a number of second-hand buses from UK, but this time all of them were ex-London Transport Daimler/Leyland Fleetlines.

In 1980, KMB started to evaluate air-conditioned double-deckers, but the trial was unsuccessful and the air-conditioners of the two buses (one Dennis Jubilant and one Leyland Victory Mark 2) were removed in 1983.

In 1981, CMB and KMB introduced the first 12-metre 3-axle double-deckers (MCW Metrobus). Another three 12-metre 3-axle double-decker bus models were introduced in late 1981/early 1982, namely Volvo Ailsa B55, Dennis Dragon/Condor and Leyland Olympian, all except the Volvo Ailsa are second generation rear-engined double-deckers.

In 1982, KMB finished the conversion of all of its buses to one-man operation.

Following the end of restriction of buying new buses from countries of Commonwealth of Nations, KMB introduced one German-built Mercedes-Benz O305 double-decker in 1983. It was followed by another 40 in 1985.

===Late 1980s: It&#x27;s too cool to be in an Olympian, yet cooler in a Falcon===

In 1985, KMB upgraded its airport coach service by introducing air-conditioned Dennis Falcon, which had the air conditioner driven by the main engine. The service was later named the &quot;Airbus&quot; service.

In 1986, KMB introduced the first 11-metre 3-axle double-deckers. These buses were designed with better manoeuvrability than 12-metre buses, with the feature of high capacity retained.

KMB resumed the evaluation of air-conditioned double-decker in the late 1980s, unlike those evaluated in the early 1980s, all these buses evaluated had the air-conditioning directly driven by the main engine. In 1987, the trial of one air-conditioned MCW Metrobus was started, but it was unsuccessful and the bus had its air-conditioning removed. Later Leyland Bus delivered one air-conditioned Olympian to KMB and the bus entered service in 1988, it was successful and later KMB started to place orders of air-conditioned Olympians (the prototype Olympian was finally withdrawn in 2005 and was preserved). An air-conditioned Dennis Dragon, which was also successful, was evaluated by KMB in 1990.

===1990s: Interchanging when one saw the other&#x27;s demise===

In September 1991, Citybus started to operate one franchised route on Hong Kong Island, becoming the fourth franchised bus company in Hong Kong.

In January 1992, New Lantao Bus was acquired by Kwoon Chung Motors.

China Motor Bus&#x27;s service was being protested by the passengers since the 1980s, and was being criticised by the councillors of Legislative Council, finally CMB was forced to hand 28 routes to Citybus in 1993, and another 14 routes in 1995. In 1997 Citybus introduced several routes to replace some routes discontinued by CMB.

In 1995, KMB introduced its last non-air-conditioned buses. Since then, all the buses introduced by the franchised bus companies were air-conditioned.

In 1996, super low floor single-deckers were introduced in Hong Kong, Citybus introduced ten Volvo B6LE, then KMB followed by introducing 12 Dennis Dart SLF buses. Later in 1997, the first super low floor double-deckers (Dennis Trident, the KMB of prototype Trident was finally withdrawn in 2015 and was preserved) were also introduced by KMB and Citybus; in the following two years, different models of super low floor buses were being introduced.

In May 1997, with the Tsing Ma Bridge coming into operation and commencement of settlement in the Tung Chung new town, Citybus and Long Win Bus (subsidiary of KMB) started to operate new franchised routes serving Tung Chung. Both of them, together with New Lantao Bus, started to operate the new airport bus services when the new Hong Kong International Airport came into operation on 6 July 1998.

In March 1998, Citybus became the first franchised bus company to operate fully air-conditioned bus fleet.

After China Motor Bus handed 42 routes to Citybus, the public and the government were still not satisfied, however. Finally, CMB&#x27;s bus franchise was terminated on 31 August 1998, and its routes went to New World First Bus (NWFB), Citybus and KMB on 1 September 1998.

In March 1999, Citybus was acquired by the Stagecoach Group.

The 1990s also saw the withdrawal of Daimler/Leyland Fleetline and Leyland Victory Mark 2 buses. CMB and KMB started to withdraw their Fleetlines in the late 1980s and the last KMB Fleetline was withdrawn in 1995. All the KMB&#x27;s Victories were also withdrawn in the 1990s. After New World First Bus acquired the whole CMB fleet, it also replaced the Victories and the remaining Fleetlines with new super low floor buses, the last Fleetlines and Victories were withdrawn in August 2000.

Bus-bus interchange became a common practice since the 1990s. In 1991 bus-bus interchange was introduced for Shing Mun Tunnel routes. Later on bus-bus interchange using transfer tickets was introduced on some overnight routes and Tai Lam Tunnel routes. With the Octopus card being accepted on some franchised bus routes since 1997, the first bus-bus interchange using Octopus card was first introduced in 1999.

===2000s: On the edge, to the scrapyard===
In the 2000s, the franchised bus companies continued to introduce new super low floor double-deckers. In 2003, KMB introduced the first new generation super low floor double-decker (TransBus Enviro500) with wider (with the width of 2550mm instead of 2500mm) bodywork and straight staircase.

In August 2002, NWFB withdrew its last non-air-conditioned buses and became the second franchised bus company to operate fully air-conditioned bus fleet.

In June 2003, Citybus was acquired by Chow Tai Fook Enterprises, the parent company of its major rival operator New World First Bus.

The 2000s also saw the withdrawal of second generation rear-engined double-deckers. Actually CMB had already withdrawn several in the 1990s. When NWFB took over in 1998, they withdrew the rest of these buses, with the last leaving the fleet in 2002. KMB also started to withdraw these double-deckers from 2000, including Leyland Olympians, Dennis Dominators/Dragons and MCW Metrobus. The withdrawal process of these buses was underway throughout the 2000s.

The last MCW Metrobus was withdrawn by KMB in 2007, which marks the extinction of MCW buses in franchised bus companies.

===2010s: Introduction of two-axle air-conditioned double deckers and extinction of non-low floor (including Hotdog) buses===
In 2010, franchised bus operators introduced the first two-axle air-conditioned double deckers. KMB introduced one Alexander Dennis Enviro400, Citybus introduced two Enviro400s, later in the same year both KMB and Citybus have received one two-axle Volvo B9TL. The first production two-axle air-conditioned double deckers appeared in 2011.

The withdrawal of KMB&#x27;s non-air-conditioned double deckers also reached the final stage in the 2010s. In late 2011, one KMB&#x27;s non-air-conditioned double decker received advertisement banners, stating &quot;Farewell KMB Non Air-Conditioned Bus (2012)&quot;. The last non-air-conditioned buses were removed from service on 9 May 2012 when the last four KMB routes were converted to fully air-conditioned bus services, thus ending the service of franchised non-air-conditioned buses in Hong Kong.

In 2013, KMB evaluated one BYD K9A fully electric single-decker bus, including a one-month trial run on route 2. It was the first fully electric bus used on franchised bus services. The bus was returned to BYD in December 2013.

In 2014, KMB, New World First Bus and Citybus introduced its first series diesel-electric hybrid buses, which is funded by the Hong Kong Government for trial of at least two years. Also during the same year, KMB and Citybus launched their first 12.8-metre high-capacity buses, which it claims would be more environmentally friendly since its larger capacity means carrying more passengers with fewer vehicles on road.

The last non-wheelchair-accessible buses will be withdrawn by 2017, apart from New Lantao Bus because of terrain constraints. New World First Bus has already been upgraded to full low-floor fleet with effect from 5 September 2015.

<text>Maurice Richard Povich (born January 17, 1939) is an American former television personality, best known for hosting the tabloid talk show &quot;Maury&quot; which aired from 1991 to 2022. Povich began his career as a radio reporter, initially at WWDC and later as host of a daytime Washington DC talk show &quot;Panorama&quot;. In the late 1980s, he gained national fame as the host of tabloid infotainment TV show &quot;A Current Affair&quot;, based at Fox&#x27;s New York flagship station WNYW. In 1991 he co-produced his own show &quot;The Maury Povich Show&quot;, which in 1998 was rebranded as &quot;Maury&quot;.

==Early life and education==
Povich was born on January 17, 1939, into a Jewish family in Washington, D.C., the second of three children born to Ethyl (née Friedman) and &quot;Washington Post&quot; sportswriter Shirley Lewis Povich. His paternal grandfather, Nathan Povich, emigrated from Russia to the United States in 1878 at age 12. Maury graduated from the Landon School in 1957, and from the University of Pennsylvania in 1962 with a degree in television journalism.

==Career==

===1962–1986===
Not long after graduation, Povich got his first job on Washington radio station WWDC, where he did publicity and worked as a reporter. By 1966, he was a news reporter and sportscaster for WTTG in his hometown, the independent station owned by Metromedia. In 1967, he became the original co-host of the station&#x27;s popular midday talk show, &quot;Panorama&quot;, which brought the rising star widespread acclaim and national recognition.

Seeking to further his career, Povich left Washington in late 1976 for what would become a series of high-profile, short-lived television jobs, beginning with WMAQ-TV in Chicago in January 1977. Hired to co-anchor evening newscasts, he joined the NBC-owned station to much fanfare—ahead of his arrival, WMAQ-TV produced promotions featuring testimonials from U.S. senator Hubert Humphrey and actress Carol Channing, among others, touting Povich&#x27;s credentials. But Povich left after only eight months when, after being promised a long-term contract, the station&#x27;s management failed to present him one.

Povich then headed to CBS-owned KNXT in Los Angeles—where he co-anchored alongside Connie Chung—but was ousted after a six-month stint following a change in the station&#x27;s news management. Povich moved next to San Francisco, where he co-hosted &quot;AM San Francisco&quot; and co-anchored news for ABC-owned KGO-TV.

Povich returned to the East Coast in April 1980, when Group W–owned KYW-TV in Philadelphia hired him to anchor newscasts and host &quot;AM/PM&quot;, a midday audience-participation talk show which, in February 1981 would be retitled &quot;People Are Talking&quot;. He departed KYW-TV after three years and brought his career full-circle with a return home to Washington in June 1983, resuming as host of &quot;Panorama&quot; and anchoring &quot;The 10 O&#x27;Clock News&quot; for WTTG.

===1986–1990: &quot;A Current Affair&quot;===
When Australian media mogul Rupert Murdoch and 20th Century Fox acquired WTTG and the rest of Metromedia&#x27;s television station group in 1986 to form the new Fox network, one of the first moves made by the newly christened Fox Television Stations was to bring Povich to New York to host &quot;A Current Affair&quot;. Initially launching on WNYW in July 1986 before landing on the other Fox-owned stations, and into national syndication in 1988, &quot;A Current Affair&quot; was considered a tabloid infotainment show that often focused on celebrity gossip, but it also made time for compelling human-interest stories. Critics praised the show for trying to be both informative and entertaining, much like &quot;a good afternoon newspaper.&quot; Povich hosted &quot;Affair&quot; until 1990. While at WNYW, Povich also anchored the station&#x27;s 7:00 p.m. newscasts. He also served two consecutive terms as president of the New York chapter of the National Academy of Television Arts and Sciences.

===1991–1998: &quot;The Maury Povich Show&quot;===
In September 1991, he began to host &quot;The Maury Povich Show&quot;, which was nationally syndicated and distributed by Paramount Domestic Television in partnership with his own production company, MoPo Productions, from 1991 to 1998. For raising awareness of National Adoption Month, Povich was honored by New York City mayor Rudolph Giuliani in 1995.

===1998–2022: &quot;Maury&quot;, &quot;Twenty One&quot;, and &quot;Weekends with Maury and Connie&quot;===
In 1998, the show was taken over by Studios USA (then a division of USA Networks, later renamed Universal Television after being sold to Vivendi Universal; and NBCUniversal Television Distribution after VU Entertainment was sold to NBC owner General Electric). When Studios USA took over production of the show, it was renamed simply &quot;Maury&quot;. The show often veered into what critics called trash TV, and in 1998 it became known for a segment called &quot;Who&#x27;s the Daddy?&quot; during which men who were denying or trying to establish paternity were given DNA tests and the results were revealed on the air.

On January 9, 2000, Povich hosted the short-lived primetime revival of the classic game show &quot;Twenty One&quot; on NBC. Reruns of the show have been aired on GSN.

In November 2005, MSNBC announced Povich would co-host a weekend news program with his wife, Connie Chung. The program titled &quot;Weekends with Maury and Connie&quot; debuted on January 7, 2006, but was canceled due to low ratings. The final episode aired on June 17, 2006.

He appeared as himself in the fourth episode of the sixth season of the sitcom &quot;How I Met Your Mother&quot;. He is portrayed as a New Yorker who is apparently seen everywhere in the city—often in several places at once. He also appeared as himself in the film &quot;Madea&#x27;s Big Happy Family&quot;.

In May 2007, he launched the &quot;Flathead Beacon&quot;, a weekly print newspaper and online news source in Montana&#x27;s Flathead County, where he has a home and is a member at the Eagle Bend Golf Club.

In 2015, Povich made a guest appearance on the Adult Swim show &quot;The Jack and Triumph Show&quot;. In March 2022, Povich announced his retirement and the end of his talk show after 31 seasons, making it the longest-running daytime talk show with a single host in American television history. Povich discussed his career with Greg Braxton of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; that June, noting that he had accomplished all he had wanted to do during his career, was proud of what he had created with &quot;Maury&quot; (especially in maintaining the show&#x27;s ratings in a time when daytime television audiences were shrinking rapidly), and had no further desire for any other television projects. In 2023, Povich made a guest appearance on the Disney+ animated show &quot;The Proud Family: Louder and Prouder&quot;.

==Personal life==
From 1962 to 1979, Povich was married to Phyllis Minkoff. Maury and Phyllis have two daughters together, Susan Anne and Amy Joyce Povich. Their daughter Amy is married to physician and author David Agus.

In 1984, he married news anchor Connie Chung, whom he had met while working in the news department at WTTG. In 1995, Chung and Povich adopted a son, Matthew Jay Povich.

Povich believes in the superiority of the nuclear family as a family model and believes that children are best served when both parents are in the child&#x27;s life; this was a major factor in &quot;Maury&#x27;s&quot; frequent emphasis on paternity testing. Povich took a journalistic approach to each story and took pride when an appearance on &quot;Maury&quot; would lead to the father and mother of a child reconciling.

In 2017, Povich became an investor and part owner of the Washington, D.C. bar and restaurant Chatter, along with other D.C. notables Tony Kornheiser and Gary Williams.

He is a fan of University of Central Florida football.

Povich owns a ranch just outside of Bigfork, Montana, where he lives several months of the year.

Maury is an avid golfer and has been playing golf since he was a child. He is a frequent player at Pebble Beach, Torrey Pines, Farm Neck, and Old Course in Scotland. He still plays in amateur senior tournaments with a 2.4 handicap and in 2007 was placed in &quot;Golf Digest&quot; top 100 celebrity golfers. In 2000, Maury participated in the U.S. Senior Amateur championship where he lost in the first round of the match play competition. Maury occasionally plays golf with Steve Wilkos, his fellow NBCUniversal talk show host who shares the same studio as the &quot;Maury Show&quot;.

=== Sexual harassment allegation ===
On April 24, 2006, former &quot;Maury&quot; producer Bianca Nardi filed a lawsuit against Povich for sexual harassment, alleging that she was &quot;forced to expose her breasts for photographs for the show and ordered to watch pornography in a private room with an executive producer.&quot; According to a spokesman for the show, Nardi&#x27;s allegations were dismissed after an internal investigation. In August 2006, a Manhattan judge ruled that the case be taken to closed-door arbitration. In November 2006, a gag order was requested by Povich&#x27;s lawyer.

==In popular culture==
Povich was mocked in a 2002 &quot;South Park&quot; episode called &quot;Freak Strike&quot;. He also appeared in a mock episode of his show in the film &quot;Madea&#x27;s Big Happy Family&quot;. On &quot;Jimmy Kimmel Live!&quot; Povich was spoofed overseeing a paternity testing involving Matt Damon, Kimmel, and Kimmel&#x27;s wife Molly McNearney as Martin Short stood in for Povich.

In 2021, musician Lil Nas X collaborated with Povich to create a full-length faux episode of &quot;Maury&quot;, featuring Nas X performing as his Montero character, in a love triangle with his football playing teammate lover and wife.

<text>Aequorea victoria, also sometimes called the crystal jelly, is a bioluminescent hydrozoan jellyfish, or hydromedusa, that is found off the west coast of North America.

The species is best known as the source of aequorin (a photoprotein), and green fluorescent protein (GFP); two proteins involved in bioluminescence. Their discoverers, Osamu Shimomura and colleagues, won the 2008 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for their work on GFP.

==Description==

Almost entirely transparent and colorless, and sometimes difficult to resolve, &quot;Aequorea victoria&quot; possess a highly contractile mouth and manubrium at the center of up to 100 radial canals that extend to the bell margin. The bell margin is surrounded by uneven tentacles, up to 150 of them in fully-grown specimens. The tentacles possess nematocysts that aid in prey capture, although they have no effect on humans. Specimens larger than 3 cm usually possess gonads for sexual reproduction, which run most of the length of the radial canals and are visible in the photos in this article as whitish thickenings along the radial canals. The bell margin is ringed with the muscular velum, which is typical of hydromedusae, and aids in locomotion through muscular contraction of the bell. Larger specimens are frequently found with symbiotic hyperiid amphipods attached to the subumbrella, or even occasionally living inside the gut or radial canals.

==Distribution==
&quot;Aequorea victoria&quot; are found along the North American west coast of the Pacific Ocean from the Bering Sea to southern California. The medusa part of the life cycle is a pelagic organism, which is budded off a bottom-living polyp in late spring. The medusae can be found floating and swimming both nearshore and offshore in the eastern Pacific Ocean; this species is particularly common in Puget Sound.

==Identification==
&quot;Aequorea&quot; species can be fairly difficult to tell apart, as the morphological features on which identifications are made are mostly the numbers of tentacles, numbers of radial canals, numbers of marginal statocysts, and size. These features are fairly plastic, and the numbers of tentacles and radial canals increase in all species of &quot;Aequorea&quot; with size. One other species is occasionally found in the same geographical range as &quot;Aequorea victoria&quot;; this other form has been called &quot;Aequorea coerulescens&quot;. While &quot;A. coerulescens&quot; is apparently generally found offshore in the eastern Pacific Ocean, rare specimens have been collected in central California and in Friday Harbor, North Puget Sound. While morphologically similar to &quot;Aequorea victoria&quot;, the &quot;Aequorea coerulescens&quot; form is larger (roughly the size of a dinner plate) with many more radial canals. Animals of sizes intermediate between these two forms are also rather intermediate in appearance, making morphological identifications difficult.

This species is thought to be synonymous with &quot;Aequorea aequorea&quot; of Osamu Shimomura, the discoverer of green fluorescent protein (GFP). Shimomura together with Martin Chalfie and Roger Y. Tsien were awarded the 2008 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for the discovery and development of this protein as an important biological research tool. Originally the &quot;A. victoria&quot; name was used to designate the variant found in the Pacific, and the &quot;A. aequorea&quot; designation was used for specimens found in the Atlantic and Mediterranean. The species name used in GFP purification was later disputed by M.N. Arai and A. Brinckmann-Voss (1980), who decided to separate them on the basis of 40 specimens collected from around Vancouver Island. Shimomura notes that this species in general shows great variation: from 1961 to 1988 he collected around 1 million individuals in the waters surrounding the Friday Harbor Laboratories of University of Washington, and in many cases there were pronounced variations in the form of the jellyfish.

==Life history==
&quot;Aequorea victoria&quot; have a dimorphic life history, alternating between asexual benthic polyps and sexual planktonic medusae in a seasonal pattern. &quot;Aequorea victoria&quot; juvenile medusae are asexually budded off hydroid colonies in late spring; these free-living hydromedusae will spend all of their lives in the plankton. The medusa spends its first stage of life growing quickly, and after reaching approximately 3 cm will begin producing gametes for reproduction. Each medusa is either a male or a female. The eggs and spermatozoa mature daily in the medusa gonads, given enough food, and are free-spawned into the water column in response to a daily light cue, where they are fertilized and eventually settle out to form a new hydroid colony. The hydroids live on hard or rocky substrates on the bottom, where they asexually bud new tiny jellyfish each springtime in response to some (still unknown) environmental cue(s). The medusa form generally lives approximately 6 months, roughly from late spring into the autumn.

==Natural history==

&quot;Aequorea victoria&quot; typically feed on soft-bodied organisms, but the diet may also include some crustacean zooplankton such as copepods, crab zoëals, barnacle nauplii &amp; other larval planktonic organisms. Gelatinous organisms consumed include ctenophores, appendicularians and other hydromedusae, including rarely other &quot;Aequorea victoria&quot; if conditions are appropriate. Prey is ensnared in long tentacles containing nematocysts, and ingested with a highly contractile mouth that can expand to consume organisms half the medusae&#x27;s size. Due to their voracious nature, &quot;Aequorea victoria&quot; density can be inversely correlated to zooplankton density, indicating a competitive presence in shared environments.

The swimming velocity of &quot;Aequorea victoria&quot; does not increase as their body size increases which deems them as inefficient swimmers. Therefore, they require direct contact with their prey in order to feed which is effectively done through energetic propulsion in which pressure allows them to passively move in their environment.

==Predators==
&quot;Aequorea&quot; medusae are eaten by the voracious scyphozoan &quot;Cyanea capillata&quot;, commonly called the lion&#x27;s mane jelly, as well as ctenophores, siphonophorae and other hydromedusae, including documented cases of cannibalism. Many larger specimens are found with the parasitic hyperiid amphipod &quot;Hyperia medusarum&quot; attached to the either the subumbrella or exumbrella; these amphipods may burrow into the jelly, but such activities are not lethal to the jellyfish.

==Luminescence==

This jellyfish is capable of producing flashes of blue light by a quick release of calcium (Ca2+), which interacts with the photoprotein aequorin. The blue light produced is in turn transduced to green by the now famous green fluorescent protein (GFP). This transduction of energy is called Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET). Both aequorin and GFP are important fluorescent markers frequently employed in biochemical research.

In 1961, Shimomura and Johnson isolated the protein aequorin, and its small molecule cofactor, coelenterazine, from large numbers of &quot;Aequorea&quot; jellyfish at Friday Harbor Laboratories. They discovered, after initially finding bright luminescence on adding seawater to a purified sample, that calcium ions (Ca2+) were required to trigger bioluminescence. This research also marked the beginning of research into green fluorescent protein which was summarized by Shimomura. In 1967, Ridgeway and Ashley microinjected aequorin into single muscle fibers of barnacles, and observed transient calcium ion-dependent signals during muscle contraction.

For his research into GFP, Osamu Shimomura was awarded the 2008 Nobel Prize for chemistry, together with Martin Chalfie and Roger Tsien.

This discovery led to great advancements in the field of medicine because it allows for further understanding in treatments and medical diagnoses through research in cells and bacteria.

<text>The Fourche La Fave River (pronounced &quot;Foosh (like push but with an f-sound) Luh Fave&quot;), shown as Fourche LaFave River on federal maps) is a tributary of the Arkansas River, approximately long, in western Arkansas in the United States. It drains part of the northern Ouachita Mountains west of Little Rock.

It was named for the La Feve family who settled near its mouth. &quot;Fourche&quot; is French meaning &quot;fork&quot;.

==Course==

It rises in southern Scott County south of Waldron and flows east-northeast through the Ouachita National Forest, along the southern side of the Dutch Creek Mountain ridge, then along the north side of the Fourche Mountain ridge. It flows past Perryville and joins the Arkansas from the west approximately northwest of Little Rock. It is impounded by the Nimrod Dam at Fourche Junction to form Nimrod Lake for flood control. It is joined by the South Fourche La Fave River west of Perryville.

<doc id="778884" wikidata="Q571583" url="?curid=778884" title="Laser Mission">
<text>Laser Mission is a West German action film directed by Beau J. Davis. It stars Brandon Lee, Ernest Borgnine and Werner Pochath in his final film role. The film was released under the title &quot;Soldier of Fortune&quot;.

==Plot==
The plot concerns a mercenary named Michael Gold (Lee) who is sent to convince Dr. Braun (Borgnine), a laser specialist, to defect to the United States before the KGB acquire him and use both his talent and a stolen diamond to create a nuclear weapon. Dr. Braun is captured by the KGB and Gold is sent on a mission to rescue both him and the diamond. He has to enlist the help of Dr. Braun&#x27;s daughter Alissa (Debi A. Monahan), whom he eventually falls for. The pair confront Col. Kalishnakov (Graham Clarke), whom they kill by hitting him with a truck in the climax of this story.

==Cast==
* Brandon Lee as Michael Gold
* Debi A. Monahan as Alissa 
* Ernest Borgnine as Prof. Braun
* Graham Clark as Col. Kalishnakov
* Trevor Williamson as The Foot

==Release==
In the United States the film was released on home video in 1990 by Turner Home Entertainment.

The film was released in Australia directly on video in 1994.

== Box office ==
In the US the film was a financial success.

After Brandon Lee&#x27;s untimely death in an accident on the set of &quot;The Crow&quot;, movies such as &quot;Laser Mission&quot; saw a surge in video sales.

== Reception and legacy==
From contemporary reviews, &quot;Variety&quot; described the film as a &quot;lively, well-made actioner with humor&quot; that had both Brandon Lee and Debi Monahan left to &quot;struggle with a mediocre script.&quot; 
Jon Casimir of &quot;The Sydney Morning Herald&quot; did not like the film finding the acting poor, with the plot and action scenes unconvincing. Pat Gillespie of &quot;The Age&quot; found the direction clumsy but said that Lee&#x27;s and action films fans would find the film entertaining.

From retrospective reviews, Jim Vorel and Kenneth Lowe of &quot;Paste Magazine&quot; did not like it and found the continuity disorienting. Dan Colón of &quot;Talk Film Society&quot; said the film is great for those with an appetite for action orientated B movies.

RiffTrax spoofed the film on October 3, 2011.

<text>Port Sorell is a town on the north-central coast of Tasmania, Australia. It is on the waterway of the same name, just off Bass Strait, 20 km east of Devonport and close to Shearwater and Hawley Beach. It borders the Rubicon Estuary, which has been identified by BirdLife International as an Important Bird Area because of its importance for waders, especially pied oystercatchers.

==History==
The area was named Panatana by local Aborigines. The town was originally a fishing and sealing port named &quot;Burgess&quot;, however the name was officially changed to Port Sorell (after Governor Sorell) in 1822. In 1823, in an attempt to encourage further immigration to the North, Governor Sorell would dispatch Captain Charles Browne Hardwicke to the area. While outright not discouraging Port Sorell itself, he would describe the land west (stretching to at least the Mersey River and perhaps across to Circular Head) as &quot;practically impenatrable and uninhabitable&quot; for increased Migration North

Hardwicke would also comment on the Native Tasmanians in the area, whom he described as &quot;Numerous, and appear disposed to be friendly towards Europeans, as we had communication with them.&quot; This was in stark contrast to his descriptions of Tasmanians to the west in the Circular Heads area, whom he described as &quot;extremely wild&quot; and shy with &quot;one party running away at a great distance.&quot;

The town could have been a lot larger than it is now, had it not been for bushfires, after which nearby Devonport grew to become a major port. At the , Port Sorell had a population of 2,221. Today Port Sorell is one of many popular holiday spots along the north coast of Tasmania.

The first Port Sorell Post Office opened on 1 February 1845 and closed in 1863. The current office opened on 3 July 1944.

<doc id="778892" wikidata="Q953556" url="?curid=778892" title="Ovarian follicle">
<text>An ovarian follicle is a roughly spheroid cellular aggregation set found in the ovaries. It secretes hormones that influence stages of the menstrual cycle. In humans, women have approximately 200,000 to 300,000 follicles at the time of puberty, each with the potential to release an egg cell (ovum) at ovulation for fertilization. These eggs are developed once every menstrual cycle with around 450–500 being ovulated during a woman&#x27;s reproductive lifetime.

== Structure ==
Ovarian follicles are the basic units of female reproductive biology. Each of them contains a single oocyte (immature ovum or egg cell). These structures are periodically initiated to grow and develop, culminating in ovulation of usually a single competent oocyte in humans. They also consist of granulosa cells and theca of follicle.

===Oocyte===

Once a month, one of the ovaries releases a mature egg (ovum), known as an oocyte. The nucleus of such an oocyte is called a &quot;germinal vesicle (see picture).&quot;

===Cumulus oophorus===

Cumulus oophorus is a cluster of cells (called cumulus cells) that surround the oocyte both in the ovarian follicle and after ovulation.

===Membrana granulosa===

It contains numerous granulosa cells.

====Granulosa cell====
Granulosa cells or follicular cells are cells that surround the oocyte within the follicle; their numbers increase directly in response to heightened levels of circulating gonadotropins or decrease in response to testosterone. They also produce peptides involved in ovarian hormone synthesis regulation. Follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) induces granulosa cells to express luteinizing hormone (LH) receptors on their surfaces; when circulating LH binds to these receptors, proliferation stops.

===Theca of follicle===
The granulosa cells, in turn, are enclosed in a thin layer of extracellular matrix – the follicular basement membrane or basal lamina (&quot;fibro-vascular coat&quot; in picture). Outside the basal lamina, the layers theca interna and theca externa are found.

==Development==
Primordial follicles are indiscernible to the naked eye. However, these eventually develop into primary, secondary and tertiary vesicular follicles. Tertiary vesicular follicles (also called &quot;mature vesicular follicles&quot; or &quot;ripe vesicular follicles&quot;) are sometimes called Graafian follicles (after Regnier de Graaf).

In humans, oocytes are established in the ovary before birth and may lie dormant awaiting initiation for up to 50 years.

After rupturing, the follicle is turned into a corpus luteum.

===Development of oocytes in ovarian follicles===

In a larger perspective, the whole folliculogenesis from primordial to preovulatory follicle is located in the stage of meiosis I of ootidogenesis in oogenesis.

Embryonic development in males and females follows a common pathway before gametogenesis. Once gametogonia enter the gonadal ridge, however, they attempt to associate with these somatic cells. Development proceeds and the gametogonia turn into oogonia, which become fully surrounded by a layer of cells (pre-granulosa cells).

The oogonia multiply by dividing mitotically; this proliferation ends when the oogonia enter meiosis. The amount of time that oogonia multiply by mitosis is not species specific. In the human fetus, cells undergoing mitosis are seen until the second and third trimester of pregnancy. After beginning the meiotic process, the oogonia (now called primary oocytes) can no longer replicate. Therefore, the total number of gametes is established at this time. Once the primary oocytes stop dividing the cells enter a prolonged &#x27;resting phase&#x27;. This &#x27;resting phase&#x27; or dictyate stage can last anywhere up to fifty years in the human.

For several primary oocytes that complete meiosis I each month, only one or a few functional oocyte, the dominant follicles, completes maturation and undergoes ovulation. The other follicles that begin to mature will regress and become atretic follicles, eventually deteriorating.

The primary oocyte turns into a secondary oocyte in mature ovarian follicles. Unlike the sperm, the egg is arrested in the secondary stage of meiosis until fertilization.

Upon fertilization by sperm, the secondary oocyte continues the second part of meiosis and becomes a zygote.

==Clinical significance==

Any ovarian follicle that is larger than about three centimeters is termed an ovarian cyst.

Ovarian function may be measured by gynecologic ultrasonography of follicular volume. Presently, ovarian follicle volumes can be measured rapidly and automatically from three-dimensionally reconstructed ultrasound images.

Rupture of the follicle can result in abdominal pain (mittelschmerz) and is to be considered in the differential diagnosis in people of childbearing age.

Cryopreservation and culture tissue after cryopreservation. Cryopreservation of ovarian tissue is of interest to people who want to preserve their reproductive function beyond the natural limit, or whose reproductive potential is threatened by cancer therapy, for example in hematologic malignancies or breast cancer.

For &quot;in vitro&quot; culture of follicles, there are various techniques to optimize the growth of follicles, including the use of defined media, growth factors and three-dimensional extracellular matrix support. Molecular methods and immunoassay can evaluate stage of maturation and guide adequate differentiation. Animal studies have generally shown correct imprinted DNA methylation establishment in oocytes resulting from follicle culture.

<doc id="778906" wikidata="Q2166801" url="?curid=778906" title="Rosebery, Tasmania">
<text>Rosebery is a town on the west coast of Tasmania, Australia. It is at the northern end of the West Coast Range, in the shadow of Mount Black and adjacent to the Pieman River, now Lake Pieman.

It lies on the Murchison Highway, 25 kilometres north-east of Zeehan and is part of the Municipality of West Coast Council. At the , Rosebery had a population of 752.

The population of Rosebery declined by 22% in the years between 1996-2001.
Its newer western area on the shore of Lake Pieman is known as Primrose.

==History==
Like most of the other settlements on the west coast of Tasmania, Rosebery is a mining town. In 1893, prospector Tom McDonald discovered gold in alluvial wash, along with boulders of zinc-lead sulphide in dense rainforest on the slopes of Mount Black. McDonald pegged several claims in the name of the Rosebery Prospecting Association (named after Lord Rosebery), which later became the Rosebery Gold Mining Company. The South Rosebery Mining Company was formed soon after to mine the southern continuation of the orebody.

In 1896, the Rosebery Gold Mining Company was reconstructed as the Tasmanian Copper Company, and the South Rosebery Mining Company became the Primrose Mining Company. Rosebery Post Office opened on 1 November 1897.

The main mineral found in the orebody was sphalerite, but due to the lack of a technique to successfully extract the zinc from the ore, little could be done to exploit the orebody. One company formed to experiment in the processing of zinc ores was the Tasmanian Metals Extraction Company (TME) who built a large plant next to the track to Williamsford, completed in 1912. The experiment was unsuccessful and the plant closed in 1914.

The Rosebery mines passed into the hands of the Mount Lyell Mining and Railway company in 1916, and the mines were eventually merged with the Electrolytic Zinc Company of Australasia (EZ), who had discovered an effective method for the extraction of zinc. In 1926, construction of a processing mill at Rosebery began, and in 1931, an aerial ropeway to transport ore from the Hercules Mine near Williamsford was completed. Due to the Great Depression, the Rosebery Mill was not completed until 1936. The Rosebery Mine has operated continuously since then, with 75 year celebrations held during February, 2011. The mine is currently operated by Minerals and Metals Group (MMG), producing zinc, lead, copper, silver and gold. Previous mine owners included Pasminco and Zinifex.

Prior to the construction of the Murchison Highway in the 1960s, the town was connected with Burnie and North West Tasmania via the Emu Bay Railway.

==Climate==
Rosebery has a damp oceanic climate (&quot;Cfb&quot;) with cool to mild, damp, unstable summers and cool to cold, very wet winters. Sunshine is low; the city only receives 16.5 clear days annually, and as much as 168.1 cloudy days per annum. February is the driest month and September the wettest, as the westerly wind belt (i.e. &quot;Roaring Forties&quot;) prevails in the region. Snow falls on an average of 2.8 days a year.

<text>USS &quot;Albert W. Grant&quot; (DD-649) was a in the United States Navy during World War II. She was the only ship named for Vice Admiral Albert W. Grant (1856–1930), an admiral during World War I.

==Construction and commissioning==
&quot;Albert W. Grant&quot; was laid down on 30 December 1942 at North Charleston, South Carolina, by the Charleston Navy Yard; launched on 29 May 1943, sponsored by Miss Nell Preston Grant, granddaughter of Admiral Grant; and commissioned on 24 November 1943.

==Service history==

On the day of her commissioning, &quot;Albert W. Grant&quot; departed Charleston Navy Yard for a shakedown cruise to Bermuda. She returned to Charleston Navy Yard on 29 January 1944 for minor modifications.

===1944===
&quot;Albert W. Grant&quot; headed for Norfolk, Virginia, on 8 February, and five days later, she got underway to escort to Hawaii. They transited the Panama Canal, joined more ships at San Diego, and finally arrived at Pearl Harbor on 4 March.

On 4 April, the destroyer sailed for Majuro where she joined TF 58 for the invasion at Hollandia. During that New Guinea operation, from 21 to 29 April, &quot;Grant&quot; engaged in picket duty, inshore patrol duty, and covered landing force operations. On 29 April, she headed for the Caroline Islands with TG 58.3 and screened the carriers during strikes on Truk. The task group left for Majuro on 2 May and continued on to Pearl Harbor, arriving there on 11 May.

====Marianas, Palaus and Philippines campaigns====
After a brief respite, &quot;Albert W. Grant&quot; got underway on 29 May for Eniwetok, which served as the staging area for the invasion of the Marianas. On 11 June, she sailed to Saipan and commenced her gunfire support activities on 15 June. The destroyer was also involved in action against Tinian. She departed the Saipan area on 29 July and put into Eniwetok on 2 August. Following a brief upkeep period, the destroyer got underway for Purvis Bay, Solomon Islands, on 22 August.

The ship sortied with TG 32.5 on 6 September for the assault on the Palaus and, during a two-week period in mid-September, conducted pre-invasion bombardment and supported the landings on Peleliu and Angaur. On 29 September, she left for Manus Island. The destroyer remained there through 12 October, then sailed for the Philippines as a member of TG 77.2. On 17 October, &quot;Grant&quot; provided protection for while that fast transport landed troops on Suluan Island, Philippines. From 17 to 24 October, the destroyer provided fire support for the assault on Leyte.

====Leyte Gulf====
On 24 October, &quot;Albert W. Grant&quot; joined TG 77.2 and sailed to engage a Japanese task force reported steaming northward from the Sulu Sea toward Surigao Strait. That American battleship group met the Japanese force in the Battle of Surigao Strait, and &quot;Grant&quot;, along with other destroyers in advance of the main battle line, conducted a torpedo attack. During this attack, she was hit and severely damaged by gunfire, not only from Japanese naval forces, but also by its covering US battleships. &quot;Grant&quot; suffered 22 hits, many by six-inch shells. Fires broke out, and the ship lost steering control and all power. Thirty-eight men were killed and 104 were wounded. Although their ship was down by the bow and listing heavily to port, the destroyer&#x27;s crew got her engines working again and enabled her to retire to American-controlled waters in Leyte Gulf.

While en route to Leyte, &quot;Grant&quot; weathered a typhoon before reaching the anchorage. Following temporary repairs, the ship sailed for Pearl Harbor on 30 October under tow by . She stopped en route at Seeadler Harbor and Majuro. &quot;Grant&quot; reached Pearl Harbor on 29 November and, three days later, sailed for Mare Island, California. Following her arrival on 9 December, the destroyer underwent major repair work.

===1945===
&quot;Albert W. Grant&quot; left the shipyard on 11 March 1945 and headed for Pearl Harbor. She arrived there on 25 March and began underway training exercises. On 23 April, the destroyer sailed for the Philippines. &quot;Grant&quot; reached Leyte on 13 May. She stood out of Manila on 3 June to escort General of the Army Douglas MacArthur, embarked in , on a tour of the Philippines. &quot;Grant&quot; then sailed southwest toward Brunei Bay, Borneo, to rendezvous with TG 78.1 for the assault on Brunei Bay. On 10 June, she covered the landings there. The ship rejoined the MacArthur tour on the 11th and dropped anchor at Manila on 15 June.

&quot;Grant&quot; operated in Manila Bay until 27 June, when she got underway for Balikpapan, Borneo. From 30 June to 9 July, the destroyer covered operations against Balikpapan. She was back at Manila on 14 July. &quot;Grant&quot; then moved to the Marshalls and, upon her arrival at Eniwetok on 3 August, joined TF 49 for duty in the North Pacific. She sailed to Adak, Alaska, and the day before she arrived there, received word of the Japanese capitulation on 15 August, and sortied with TF 49 for Ominato, Japan. The task force arrived off Honshu on 8 September and anchored at Ominato on the 10th.

The destroyer remained on occupation duty in Japan through mid-November. &quot;Grant&quot; then sailed back to the United States. She arrived at Seattle, Washington, on 2 December, and upon her arrival, began overhaul. The destroyer was placed out of commission, in reserve at San Diego, on 16 July 1946. Her name was struck from the Navy list on 14 April 1971, and she was sold for scrapping.

==Awards==
&quot;Albert W. Grant&quot; received seven battle stars for World War II and a Navy Unit Commendation for the Battle of Surigao Strait.

<text>Ngarchelong is a state in Palau. It is at the northernmost tip of the island of Babeldaob. Only the state of Kayangel is farther north. 

== Demography ==
The population of the state was 384 in the 2020 census and median age was 37.2 years. The official languages of the state are Palauan and English. Uongerchetei is the title of the traditional high chief from the state. 

The state has a population of slightly under 390 people (2020), making it the fifth most populated of Palau&#x27;s sixteen states, although it is ranked thirteenth in land (with only about 10 square kilometers). The village of Mengellang serves as the state capital, and lies toward the south of the state. Mengellang and Ollei are the state&#x27;s main population centers.

In June 1972, the resident population was 702.

== Geography ==
Ngerchelong is situated on the northern tip of Babeldaob Island. The land has low rolling hills with short drainages and is fringed by a thick belt mangroves. Ngerchelong extends north from the narrowest part of the neck on Babeldaob where it borders Ngaraard. Lower hillsides are generally covered with a lowland forest, and some of the higher hills at the north end of the state are forested, but much of the land is covered with grass and low scrub.

The modern villages of Ollei (north), Mengellang (southwest) and Ngerbau (east coast) are connected by a road now partially paved. This road will eventually become part of the Babeldaob Road connecting to Chol in Ngaraard. 

Presently, most of the land use in Ngerchelong is confined to gardens surrounding the modern villages. Interspersed with these kitchen gardens are stands of agroforest which include coconut, and betelnut, breadfruit, almond trees, and banana plants. In and around many of the uninhabited villages are stands of coconut and betelnut palms, and occasionally patches of irregularly attended taro swamp gardens.

In addition, Ngerchelong includes two small islands, Ngerkeklau and Ngerechur, located one and two kilometers north of Babeldaob.

== Traditional villages ==
At least nine traditional village sites lie within Ngerchelong. The traditional villages represent important symbols giving identity to families, clans, and regions. Within villages are numerous stone features with historical and traditional importance. Many of the stone platforms, odesongel, serve as clan cemeteries, and other stone features serve as shrines. The lagoon is an important resource area, and was probably intensively exploited prehistorically. Important resources include the many fish species. Near the traditional villages are taro swamp gardens, and surrounding most village sites are garden plots and terraced hillsides.

==Political system==
Ngarchelong has its own constitution, adopted in 1982. The state government was established in 1982. The state of Ngarchelong, with population of less than 350, has an elected chief executive, governor. The state also has a legislature elected every two years. The state population elects one of the member in the House of Delegates of Palau. 

== Culture ==
Ngarchelong is an important historical site and has undergone archeological excavation.

Ngarchelong is the site of ancient stone monoliths which are mysterious in origin. Traditional Palaun religion regarded these stone monoliths as sacred prayer ground. There are other stone monoliths located in and around the islands but one will not see as many as there are in Ngarchelong.

== Education==
The Ministry of Education operates public schools.

Ngarchelong Elementary School, established in 1947, moved to its current site in Bai ra Mengellang from the original site in the community &quot;bai&quot; of Yebong hamlet in 1953. Its current building opened in 1964. It served students from Choll. Ngaraard Elementary School in Ngaraard formerly served Ngarchelong.

Palau High School in Koror is the country&#x27;s only public high school, so children from this community go there.

<text>Aimeliik is an administrative division of the island country of Palau. It is one of the Republic of Palau&#x27;s 16 states. It has an area of 52 km2 and a population of 334 (census 2015). The state capital is the village of Mongami. The four other villages are Medorm, Imul, Elechui and Ngmechiangel.

The island is the location of Palau&#x27;s largest powerplant. The state is also a short distance from the international airport. In the village of Medorm there is the highest powered short wave radio station in Palau. This is owned and operated by High Adventure Ministries originally from the US but now owned by a consortium of Chinese national churches. It comprises four short wave transmitters two are Thomson which originally came from Adventist Radio in Guam the others are a venerable Harris transmitter and a 30-year-old RCA transmitter all feeding several stacked curtain arrays which are beamed on South East Asia. They operate mainly on the 9 and 15 MHz Bands.

== History ==
At least seven traditional village sites existed in Aimeliik, Medorm, Ngchemiangel, Ngebedech, Chelechui, Ngerkeai, Imul, and Ngerderar. These settlements were focused on the rich soil with a mixed forest on a thin strip of land along the coast and around the bay.

Within villages are numerous stone features with historical and traditional importance. Many stone platforms, odesongel, serve as clan cemeteries, while other stone features serve as shrines.

The lagoon and Ngchemiangel Bay are important resource areas, and were probably intensively exploited prehistorically. Important resources include mangrove trees and many species of fish. In and around traditional villages are taro swamp gardens and garden plots, and surrounding many village sites are terraced hillsides.

The territory was governed by Spain until 1899 when it was sold to Germany. In 1919 it became a Japanese possession until the United States took control after World War II. Aimeliik is one of the most ancient villages in Palau. It is best known for its terraces and modern bai. Aimeliik is also known for Malsol&#x27;s Tomb, the legendary spot where the warrior Malsol is buried, which is now accessible through the main road and near the Aimeliik bai. Aimeliik is commonly passed through on the main road of the Babeldaob Island.

== Geography ==
Aimeliik, located on the southwest corner of Babeldaob, includes low, rolling hills surrounding Ngchemiangel Bay and the very steep and rugged terrain along the west coast north of Medorm. The modern villages of Aimeliik include inhabited settlements at Medorm, Ngchemiangel, Chelechui, Imul Ngerkeai - Medorm -, and Nekken (the modern agricultural experimentation center ). Except for the Isemiich River drainage, most drainages in Aimeliik are short, narrow, and steep. North of the low divide separating Ngchemiangel Bay from Ngeremeduu Bay, the Tabecheding River constitutes the boundary with Ngatpang. On the east, Aimeliik extends to the Rael Kedam, the central ridge dividing eastern from western drainages on Babeldaob Island. On the southeast, the boundary with Airai lies along a ridge descending west from the Rael Kedam to a point about one kilometer south of the Ngerderar River.

Land use in Aimeliik includes both private gardens in areas surrounding houses and large areas of commercial agricultural development. A variety of crops are raised in commercial enterprises, and, in addition is some cattle herding. Around modern villages, interspersed with kitchen gardens, are stands of agroforest including coconut, betelnut, breadfruit, almond trees, and banana plants. In lowlands along drainages are patches of irregularly attended taro swamp gardens. In at least one area, southeast of Medorm, a steep drainage was modified to retain water for gardening.

Aimeliik is also known for its terraces, which were most likely built for agriculture and defense reasons. The state also contains one of the four Palauan bais, or men&#x27;s meetinghouses, the other three are in Koror, Airai, and Melekeok.

==Demography==
The population of the state was 334 in the 2015 census and median age was 34.9 years. The official languages of the state are Palauan and English. Rengulbai is the title of the traditional high chief from the state.

In June 1972, the resident population was 441.

==Political system==
Aimeliik has its own constitution, adopted in 1982. The state government was established in 1983. The state of Aimeliik, with population of less than 350, has an elected chief executive, governor. The state also has a legislature elected every four years. The state population elects one of the members of the House of Delegates of Palau. 

== Economy ==
Large area of the commerce and farming come from Nekken. Most farm are substantial farming but there was also the attempt to establish Aimeliik State&#x27;s first cattle pasture, but Palau&#x27;s soils, forage and climate are ill-suited to open grazing cattle operations.

== Transport ==
Most of the roads in the state are connected with dirt roads, excluding the recently completed paved, compact road which runs through the state.

Within Aimeliik, a road network now connects all of the inhabited villages to Koror. The major Airai-Aimeliik road follows an old Japanese era road along the coast from Ngetkib Airai through the Ocholochol and Ngerderar regions to south of Imul where it turns inland and climbs to the ridge separating the Ngeremeduu Bay basin from the south coast. Just after the road reaches the ridge line is the intersection with the north–south road through Ngatpang along the east side of the bay. The Airai -Aimeliik road follows the ridge line to Nekken, where the road branches, with the southern branch following along the west side of the Isemiich River to Ngchemiangel, and the northern branch winding through some very rough terrain to Mechebechubel Ngatpang. At Ngchemiangel, another branch of the road extends northwest to Medorm.

== Education==
The Ministry of Education operates public schools.

Aimeliik Elementary School was established in 1948.

Palau High School in Koror is the country&#x27;s only public high school, so children from this community go there.

<text>Avenue Q is a musical comedy featuring puppets and human actors with music and lyrics by Robert Lopez and Jeff Marx and book by Jeff Whitty. It won Best Musical, Book, and Score at the 2004 Tony Awards. The show&#x27;s format is a parody of &quot;Sesame Street&quot;, but its content involves adult-oriented themes. It has been praised for its approach to themes of racism, homosexuality and internet pornography.

The musical premiered Off-Broadway in 2003 at the Vineyard Theatre, co-produced by the Vineyard Theatre and The New Group. In July of that same year, the show moved to the John Golden Theatre on Broadway, where it ran until 2009, playing for over 2,500 performances. It transferred to the off-Broadway New World Stages within weeks of ending its Broadway run, where it played until 2019; together, the two productions played 6,569 performances. Major productions have been staged in Las Vegas and the West End, and the musical has been staged and toured in several countries around the world. A school-friendly script has been produced.

The principal cast includes four puppeteers and three human actors. The puppet characters, Princeton, Kate, Nicky, and others, are played by the unconcealed puppeteers as the costumed human actors interact with the puppets.

==Background and structure==
&quot;Avenue Q&quot;″s cast consists of three human characters who interact with eleven puppet characters. The puppets are animated and voiced by puppeteers who appear on stage, unconcealed. The puppet and human characters ignore the puppeteers, creating the illusion that the puppets are alive. To assist with the illusion, the puppeteers wear plain gray clothing in contrast to the human and puppet characters&#x27; colorful costumes. The same puppet may be operated by different puppeteers in different scenes, and the actor voicing the puppet may be, at times, not the one animating it. One puppeteer sometimes voices two or more puppets simultaneously. Conversely, the so-called &quot;live-hands&quot; puppets require two puppeteers – again, in full view of the audience.

The show draws inspiration from and imitates the format of children&#x27;s educational television show &quot;Sesame Street&quot;. Marx interned at the program early in his career, and all four of the original cast&#x27;s principal puppeteers – John Tartaglia, Stephanie D&#x27;Abruzzo, Jennifer Barnhart and Rick Lyon – were &quot;Sesame Street&quot; performers (D&#x27;Abruzzo returned to &quot;Sesame Street&quot; after leaving &quot;Avenue Q&quot;). Three of the puppet characters are direct recognizable parodies of &quot;Sesame Street&quot; puppets: Roommates Rod and Nicky are a riff on Bert and Ernie, while Trekkie Monster bears the distinctive voice and disposition of Cookie Monster, though not his obsession with baked goods. (The production officially disclaims any connection with either Sesame Workshop or The Jim Henson Company.)

All of the characters (puppet and human) are young adults who face real-world problems with uncertain solutions, as opposed to the simplistic problems and invariably happy resolutions encountered by characters on children&#x27;s television programming. Much of the show&#x27;s ironic humor emerges from its contrasts with &quot;Sesame Street&quot;, including the differences between innocent childhood experiences and complex adulthood. The storyline presupposes the existence of &quot;monsters&quot; and talking animals, and human actors sing, dance and interact with puppets, both human and non-human, as if they were sentient beings, in a light-hearted, quasi-fantasy environment. However, the characters use a considerable amount of profanity, and puppet nudity and sex are portrayed. The show addresses adult themes, such as racism, pornography, coming out, and schadenfreude.

The story does not explain why three of the human characters are portrayed by human actors, while other characters intended to be perceived as humans are puppets. One human character is a fictionalized version of the real-life celebrity Gary Coleman, the juvenile actor who played Arnold Jackson in the 1980s American sitcom &quot;Diff&#x27;rent Strokes&quot; and later famously sued his parents and business advisers for stealing his earnings. Coleman is portrayed (by a woman in most productions) as an adult, who happens to be the building superintendent in the run-down Avenue Q neighborhood due to his dire financial situation. Marx and Lopez said that they originally intended to offer the Gary Coleman role to Coleman himself, and he expressed interest in accepting it, but did not show up for a meeting scheduled to discuss it. They stated that the character illustrates &quot;one of the most important themes in &quot;Avenue Q&quot; ... that life isn&#x27;t as easy as we&#x27;ve been led to believe&quot;. Coleman threatened to sue &quot;Avenue Q&quot; producers for their depiction of him, but ultimately he did not.

When Coleman died on May 28, 2010, casts of both the Off-Broadway production in New York City and the second national tour in Dallas dedicated that evening&#x27;s performances to his memory. The Coleman character remains in the show with modified dialogue.

==Synopsis==
The show is set on a fictional street in an &quot;outer-outer borough&quot; of New York City.

===Act I===
Princeton, a recent college graduate, is anxious to discover his purpose in life; but first, he must find an apartment and a job, with no work experience and an English degree (&quot;What Do You Do with a B.A. in English?&quot;). Beginning his search on Avenue A, he finally finds an affordable apartment on Avenue Q. His new neighbors are Kate Monster, a kindergarten assistant teacher who longs for a boyfriend; Rod, an obsessively neat Republican investment banker; Nicky, Rod&#x27;s slacker roommate; Brian, an aspiring comedian recently laid off from his catering job; Christmas Eve, Brian&#x27;s Japanese fiancée and a therapist with no clients; Trekkie Monster, a surly recluse who surfs the Internet all day in search of pornography; and Gary Coleman, the former child actor who now serves as the apartment superintendent. Debates ensue over whose life is worst, and they conclude that it is Coleman&#x27;s (&quot;It Sucks to Be Me&quot;).

Nicky, who is straight, suspects that Rod is gay and assures Rod it is okay with him if he is, but Rod insists otherwise (&quot;If You Were Gay&quot;). While moving into his apartment, Princeton learns that he has been laid off from the job he had lined up. He finds a penny minted in his birth year, declaring it a sign that he will soon find his purpose in life (&quot;Purpose&quot;). Kate Monster dreams of starting a &quot;Monstersori&quot; school for young &quot;people of fur&quot;. Princeton innocently asks Kate if she and Trekkie are related, since they are both monsters, but Kate angrily pronounces his assumption racist. Princeton, taken aback, counters that Kate&#x27;s Monstersori School would discriminate against non-monsters. Gary, Brian, and Christmas Eve join them in agreeing that racism, while problematic, is an adult reality (&quot;Everyone&#x27;s a Little Bit Racist&quot;).

Princeton receives money from his parents. The Bad Idea Bears, two charming troublemakers, convince him to spend it on beer. Kindergarten teacher Mrs. Thistletwat assigns Kate to teach the next morning&#x27;s kindergarten class, her first solo teaching opportunity. She decides that her lesson will be about the Internet and all its educational attributes, but Trekkie Monster and the neighbors explain another reality of adulthood: many adults, even &quot;normal people&quot;, use it to find pornography (&quot;The Internet is for Porn&quot;).

Princeton gives Kate a mixtape. His puzzling song selections make her question his intended message, but eventually, she decides that he must like her after he invites her on a date to the Around the Clock Café (&quot;Mixtape&quot;). Brian opens the show with his lame stand-up act (&quot;I&#x27;m Not Wearing Underwear Today&quot;), before introducing skanky chanteuse Lucy the Slut, who wows the guys, especially Princeton, with a seductive cabaret number (&quot;Special&quot;). The Bad Idea Bears suggest that Kate and Princeton order some &quot;harmless&quot; Long Island Iced Teas, and once Kate is totally inebriated, Princeton takes her home to bed, where they have enthusiastic, high-decibel sex. Gary fields angry calls from other tenants but refuses to intercede (&quot;You Can Be as Loud as the Hell You Want When You&#x27;re Makin&#x27; Love&quot;).

Meanwhile, Rod hears Nicky say, &quot;I love you, Rod,&quot; in his sleep, and is jubilant, but he eventually realizes he was dreaming. Kate and Princeton profess their mutual love, and he gives her his lucky penny (&quot;Fantasies Come True&quot;).

The next morning, a hung-over Kate oversleeps and misses her teaching assignment. Mrs. Thistletwat berates her, and Kate angrily quits her job before she can be fired. Christmas Eve decides unilaterally that it is time she and Brian were married. At the wedding, Nicky blurts out his suspicion that Rod is gay. Rod, furious, insists he has a girlfriend none of them have ever met (&quot;My Girlfriend Who Lives in Canada&quot;) and tells Nicky he is no longer welcome in their apartment.

When Kate catches Christmas Eve&#x27;s wedding bouquet, Princeton panics, confesses his fear of commitment, and asks Kate if they can just be friends. Kate retorts that she already has many friends, and ends their relationship (&quot;There&#x27;s a Fine, Fine Line&quot;).

===Act II===
A despondent Princeton has been holed up in his apartment after breaking up with Kate (&quot;It Sucks to Be Me&quot; (reprise)), but the neighbors coax him outside, where he once again runs into Lucy, who seduces the rebounding Princeton (&quot;There is Life Outside Your Apartment&quot;). Kate is angry, but Christmas Eve explains that it means she is in love with him (&quot;The More You Ruv Someone&quot;). Kate writes a note to Princeton suggesting that they rendezvous at the Empire State Building and leaves it with Lucy, who promptly destroys it. Nicky, having been kicked off of all his friends&#x27; couches, laments his fate to Gary who confesses that he is deriving pleasure from Nicky&#x27;s misfortune; they agree that this, while morally wrong, is yet another reality (&quot;Schadenfreude&quot;).

On the Empire State Building&#x27;s viewing platform, Kate, thinking that Princeton has stood her up, throws his lucky penny away. A hundred stories below, Lucy, who had just dumped Princeton for lacking a job, plans or money, is knocked unconscious by the penny. At the hospital, Kate figures out that Lucy sabotaged the meeting, while Kate and Princeton unsuccessfully try to work out their problems over Lucy&#x27;s comatose body. Rod is too proud to accept Nicky&#x27;s repeated apologies, despite clearly missing him, and tearfully consults Christmas Eve. Princeton, Kate, and Nicky dream of returning to happier times (&quot;I Wish I Could Go Back to College&quot;).

Princeton gives a still-homeless panhandling Nicky a quarter, and marvels at how fantastic he feels. Since thinking only about himself has gotten him nowhere, he decides to raise money to build Kate&#x27;s Monstersori School. He solicits everyone, even breaking the fourth wall to shake down the audience, but the results are disappointing (&quot;The Money Song&quot;). Then Trekkie Monster, recalling his own traumatic school experiences, donates ten million dollars and explains to the astonished cast that &quot;in volatile market, only stable investment is porn!&quot; (&quot;School for Monsters/The Money Song&quot; (reprise)).

Kate joyfully opens her new school. Brian lands a consulting job, and Christmas Eve finally has a paying client (Rod), so the newlyweds move to a better neighborhood. Rod finally comes out, unsurprisingly, and takes Nicky back in. Nicky finds Rod a boyfriend – Ricky, a muscle-bound hunk who otherwise looks and sounds exactly like Nicky. The Bad Idea Bears discover Scientology. Lucy, having recovered from her head injury, becomes a born-again Christian and takes a vow of chastity. Kate and Princeton agree to give their relationship another go (&quot;There&#x27;s a Fine, Fine Line&quot; (reprise)).

A new college graduate inquires about the vacancy in the building (&quot;What Do You Do with a B.A. in English&quot; (reprise)), and Princeton has an epiphany: he concludes that his purpose may be to put everything he has learned into a Broadway musical. Everybody, especially the newcomer, immediately ridicules him. The cast reminds Princeton that, in the real world, many people never find their purpose, but life goes on, and everything, both good and bad, is &quot;only for now&quot; (&quot;For Now&quot;).

===Other &quot;Avenue Q&quot; songs===
Nine additional songs were written for &quot;Avenue Q&quot; or associated promotions, but are not part of the original Broadway production itself.

* &quot;Tear It Up and Throw It Away&quot;: Originally performed early in the first act, between &quot;What Do You Do with a BA in English?&quot; and &quot;If You Were Gay&quot;; Kate is called for jury duty, and Nicky advises her to ignore the summons, pretending it was lost in the mail. (&quot;Your civic duty? Who gives a doody?&quot;) Kate tears up the summons and is ticketed for littering. The number was cut during Off-Broadway rehearsals because it had no relevance to the plot, and because, according to Stephanie D&#x27;Abruzzo, there was no judicious way to dispose of the paper scraps, which remained onstage throughout Act One. The cut came so late that early promotional materials included references to the song, and its main melody can be heard underscoring dialog in &quot;The Money Song&quot; on the original cast recording. It was included on a CD that accompanied the original souvenir program but not on the cast recording. An original audio clip is available on YouTube.
* &quot;Time&quot;: Originally performed in a sequence where Nicky enjoys his time in the bathroom as Rod begs him to finish up so he can use the bathroom, and becomes increasingly distressed as the song continues. Eventually Rod decides to go use the Starbucks restroom, only for Nicky to hear him and ask to come with him. The song was cut during the development process, but it was resurrected for a video created for the London production. This video was originally shown on the on-stage video screens during intermission, just prior to the second act curtain; Nicky (Simon Lipkin) sits on the toilet in the theatre&#x27;s men&#x27;s room at intermission, singing about all the &quot;chores&quot; he is getting done between acts. Several audience members waiting to use the stall become increasingly annoyed. British comedian Matt Lucas has a cameo role. The song was cut during early previews for unspecified reasons, but remained on the CD that accompanied the souvenir brochure, and was shown at the final West End performance on October 30, 2010. A video can be viewed on YouTube.
* &quot;Rod&#x27;s Dilemma&quot;: Written for Tony Award voters, this song spoofs &quot;Avenue Q&quot;″s competition for the 2004 Tony for Best Musical, and the entire Tony voting process. In the Rotary Club presidential election, Rod cannot decide whether to vote for the guy he has a crush on (symbolizing &quot;The Boy from Oz&quot;), a wealthy man (&quot;Wicked&quot;), or an old friend (&quot;Caroline, or Change&quot;). The neighbors advise him against voting &quot;for your friends, &#x27;cause they say you should vote for the candidate you think is good.&quot; The song was a part of the production&#x27;s successful Tony Award campaign, called &quot;Q &#x27;04 Now! Vote Your Heart!&quot;. An audio cut is available on YouTube.
*&quot;It Sucks to Be Me&quot; (reprise): This song is sung by Princeton immediately after Act Two begins. It was not part of the original show or original cast recording. The song was first added to the Las Vegas production, and subsequently became part of the current off-Broadway show and the licensed script.
* &quot;Only in Vegas&quot;: This parody of Las Vegas-style show tunes was written to promote the Las Vegas production. It featured Rick Lyon operating a Steve Wynn puppet, who tells the cast of &quot;Avenue Q&quot; how happy they will be in Las Vegas. The song was performed on the &quot;Regis and Kelly&quot; syndicated television show and in some press and media events.
* &quot;Rod&#x27;s Christmas&quot;: Found on the CD &quot;Broadway&#x27;s Greatest Gifts: Carols for a Cure, Vol. 5&quot;: Rod headlines at the &quot;Don&#x27;t Tell Daddy&#x27;s Cabaret and Night Club&quot; (a parody of the New York piano bar Don&#x27;t Tell Mama, which is named for a song from the musical &quot;Cabaret&quot;). Rod sings that Christmas is the time of year where he can combine his two great loves, &quot;Christmas carols and show tunes.&quot;
* &quot;The Holi-daze&quot;: Found on the CD &quot;Broadway&#x27;s Greatest Gifts: Carols for a Cure, Vol. 8&quot;. Written by Michael Patrick Walker and Phoebe Kreutz (who both worked on the Broadway and Off-Broadway productions of &quot;Avenue Q&quot;), the members of the company sing about how they cope with the stresses and problems of the holiday season. The song does not feature any characters from the show but was recorded by several of the original &quot;Avenue Q&quot; cast and band members, and was sub-titled &quot;Drinkin&#x27; Our Way Through the Holidays&quot;.
* &quot;Christmas&quot;: &quot;Purpose&quot; with new, festive lyrics. Written by the company of &quot;Avenue Q&quot;/London for Theatrecares&#x27; &quot;West End Christmas&quot; charity event. It is on a special CD, but can also be heard at Jon Robyns&#x27;s Web site.
* &quot;How Much Do the People in Your Neighborhood Make?&quot;: A parody on the classic &quot;Sesame Street&quot; song, &quot;Who Are the People in Your Neighborhood&quot;, the song was written very early in the show&#x27;s history, and dropped when the original television show format was abandoned in favor of a stage production.

==Puppet development==
The &quot;Avenue Q&quot; puppets, which cost up to $10,000 each, and require up to 120 hours of hand fabrication per character, were designed and built by original cast member Rick Lyon. Lyon&#x27;s company, The Lyon Puppets, built and maintained the puppets used in all North American productions, and several of the international productions, while supervising the construction of those from other productions.

Three distinct types of puppets are used in the show:

===Rod puppets===
&quot;Single Rod: Princeton, Kate Monster&quot;&lt;br&gt;&quot;Double Rod: Rod, Lucy, The Bad Idea Bears&quot;&lt;br&gt;
Rod puppets consist of a head and a torso with two arms, at least one of which is movable for gestures. &quot;Single rod&quot; puppets have one movable arm controlled by one rod, with the other arm &quot;posed&quot; in a permanent gesture or attached to the puppet&#x27;s torso; both arms are movable on &quot;double rod&quot; puppets, each controlled by a separate rod. The puppeteer controls the puppet&#x27;s head and mouth with his or her dominant hand, and holds one or both rods in the other hand.

===Live-hands puppets===
&quot;Nicky, Trekkie Monster, Mrs. Thistletwat&quot;&lt;br&gt;
Live-hands puppets require two puppeteers, each of whom contributes one hand and arm dressed with a long sleeve and glove matching the puppet&#x27;s costume, which become the arms and hands of the puppet. The speaking puppeteer controls the puppet&#x27;s left hand, head, and mouth, while the second, silent operator controls the right hand. (Sides are sometimes reversed if the speaking puppeteer is left-handed.) During the show, one puppeteer will sometimes exit to take over another puppet, leaving the live-hands puppet with a single operator and only one functioning hand. In a variation, one or both of the puppet&#x27;s hands can be attached to its torso to permit operation by a single puppeteer.

===Mechanized and free hand puppets===
Mechanized puppets are not directly controlled by the puppeteer&#x27;s hand. Instead, they are controlled by a concealed trigger that when pulled causes the mouth to open. The motion is similar to a toy grabber. Princeton&#x27;s cardboard boxes, also used in &quot;Purpose&quot;, are examples of such puppets. Free hand puppets do not have rods, mechanisms, or live-hands for their arms. While their head controls are the same as a rod puppet, the hands are moved by physically picking them up and moving them. In the show Ricky is the only puppet with this design because it is intended for use by a left handed puppeteer.

==History==
Jeff Marx met Robert Lopez at a songwriting class at the BMI Workshop. As part of the workshop, the two decided to write songs for a speculative Muppet movie based on &quot;Hamlet&quot; called &quot;Kermit, Prince of Denmark&quot;. Encouraged by the class response to their songs, they decided to have someone actually performing a puppet present a song, since they were writing them for puppets. Through mutual friends, they contacted Rick Lyon, who agreed to perform Kermit singing a song in their class. He performed a Kermit replica puppet while sitting on a stool in full view of the audience. This visible puppeteer approach became a key component of &quot;Avenue Q&quot;. &quot;Kermit, Prince of Denmark&quot; was pitched to, but was ultimately turned down by, the Henson family. The duo then decided to create a new show, with original puppet characters, which was a parody of &quot;Sesame Street&quot;. Lyon created the puppets. &quot;Avenue Q&quot; was originally conceived as a show for television, but following a public reading presented for potential producers/investors in 2000, Broadway producers Robyn Goodman and Jeffrey Seller expressed interest in developing it into a theatrical property.

==Productions==

===Off-Broadway===
&quot;Avenue Q&quot; ran Off-Broadway at the Vineyard Theatre for 72 performances from March 20 through May 4, 2003, with previews from February 19. The musical won the 2003 Lucille Lortel Award for Best Musical and Outstanding Sound Design (Brett Jarvis). It was nominated for the Lucille Lortel Award for Outstanding Director (Jason Moore), Outstanding Choreographer (Ken Roberson) and Outstanding Scenic Design (Anna Louizos). It won the 2003–2004 Outer Critics Circle Award, Outstanding Ensemble Performance and Puppet Artistry and the 2004 GLAAD Media Award, Outstanding New York Theater: Broadway and Off-Broadway

===Broadway===

The musical opened on Broadway at the John Golden Theatre on July 31, 2003, following previews from July 10, again directed by Moore and choreographed by Roberson, with set design by Louizos, costume design by Mirena Rada, lighting design by Howell Binkley, musical supervision by Stephen Oremus, musical direction by Gary Adler, and puppet design and execution by cast member Rick Lyon. It was produced by Kevin McCollum, Robyn Goodman, and Jeffrey Seller. The show was nominated for six Tony Awards and won three: Best Musical, Best Book of a Musical and Best Original Score.

After 22 previews and 2,534 regular performances, it closed on September 13, 2009. As of June 21, 2009, the production had grossed over $117 million and had returned profits of $23.5 million to its investors.(All of the money collected from the audience during &quot;The Money Song&quot; is donated to Broadway Cares/Equity Fights AIDS.)

After the show closed on Broadway, it reopened Off-Broadway at the New World Stages complex on October 9, 2009. The production played there for a decade until its final performance on May 26, 2019, with many former cast members, and the show&#x27;s creators in the audience.

===Las Vegas===
In September 2005, &quot;Avenue Q&quot; opened at the Wynn Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas under a production contract that precluded &quot;Avenue Q&quot; tours in North America during the Las Vegas run. A new 1,200-seat theater was built especially for the show. Variations from the Broadway production included a new reprise of &quot;It Sucks to Be Me&quot; for Princeton at the top of Act Two, some new orchestrations, a trimmed &quot;The Money Song,&quot; and a new rock arrangement of &quot;There Is Life Outside Your Apartment,&quot; as well as a few jokes written specifically for Las Vegas audiences.

Attendance was well below anticipated levels, and in January 2006 the show was cut to 90 minutes with the intermission removed. Hotel owner Steve Wynn promoted the show heavily, at one point decorating 20 city cabs in orange fuzz and large white &quot;Q&quot; letters. All such efforts were unsuccessful, and the show closed on May 28, 2006, after a nine-month run, terminating the exclusivity agreement and opening the way for national tours.

===West End===

A Cameron Mackintosh-produced version of &quot;Avenue Q&quot; opened in 2006 in the West End at the Noël Coward Theatre (formerly the Albery Theatre). Several adaptive changes were made for British audiences, including portrayal of the Gary Coleman character by a male actor. The production ran 1,179 performances through March 2009, then reopened in June 2009 at the Gielgud Theatre. After a further 327 performances, the show moved in March 2010 to the Wyndham&#x27;s Theatre, where it closed on October 30, 2010, after a five-year run. A single concert of the show is scheduled for 10 November 2024 at the Sondheim Theatre to celebrate the production&#x27;s 18th anniversary. The original West End cast are expected to reprise their roles.

===Touring productions===
The first national tour began at the Spreckels Theatre in San Diego, California, on June 30, 2007. Broadway director and choreographer Jason Moore and Ken Roberson returned in those roles, as did most other Broadway creative team members. The tour played a total of 721 performances in 22 cities, and closed at the Fox Cities Performing Arts Center in Appleton, Wisconsin on May 10, 2009. A second national tour opened in Clemson, South Carolina in September 2009 under direction of the same creative team, and closed in Huntsville, Alabama on April 23, 2011.

The first UK tour began at the Theatre Royal Bath in February 2011 and closed at Northampton&#x27;s Derngate in July. A second UK and Ireland tour began in January 2012 at the Theatre Royal, Plymouth, Sell A Door Theatre Company launched a British revival of the show in April 2014, which ran for 3 weeks at Greenwich Theatre, followed by a 12-week UK tour. The tour differed from the West End production in that Gary Coleman, as in the Broadway production, was portrayed by a female actress. The production toured the UK again in 2015–16; another touring production started in 2019.

===International Productions===
An Australian production opened in June 2009 at the Comedy Theatre, Melbourne, directed by Jonathan Biggins and featuring a local cast, including Michala Banas as Kate/Lucy. The production visited Sydney in August, before touring Canberra (Australian Capital Territory), Perth (Western Australia), Adelaide (South Australia), Brisbane (Queensland), and Auckland in New Zealand, and closed in June 2010. The show won a number of Helpmann Awards, including Best Direction, Best Actress and Best Actor.

&quot;Avenue Q&quot; has had additional international productions in Australia, Brazil, Denmark, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Mexico, Portugal, South Africa and Spain, among others.

==&quot;Avenue Q: School Edition&quot;==
&quot;Avenue Q&quot; and Music Theatre International collaborated on the &quot;Avenue Q: School Edition&quot; to facilitate production of the musical by high school drama departments. Most of the profanity and sexual themes are removed from the script and score, and two songs (&quot;My Girlfriend Who Lives in Canada&quot; and &quot;You Can Be As Loud as the Hell You Want&quot;) are removed. &quot;The Internet Is for Porn&quot; is replaced with &quot;My Social Life Is Online&quot;, and Trekkie&#x27;s obsession with pornography is replaced by an obsession with social networking sites. The characters Mrs. Thistletwat and Lucy the Slut are renamed Mrs. Butz and Lucy, respectively. The scenes involving the Bad Idea Bears are altered to deemphasize alcohol.

==&quot;Avenue Q&quot; promotional events==

On September 30, 2004, the day of the first Bush–Kerry presidential debate at the University of Miami, on a stage set up in Times Square, the cast of &quot;Avenue Q&quot; presented their version of the debate, called &quot;Avenue Q&amp;A&quot;, with portrait puppets of Bush and Kerry created by Rick Lyon. Eighteen television networks covered the event. Lyon operated the Bush puppet, while Jennifer Barnhart operated the Kerry puppet. Each puppet sang responses to questions from Avenue Q&#x27;s concerned residents, and the whole cast sang &quot;Vote Your Heart&quot; (see Other Songs above) to the rain-drenched crowd. Rod (played by Tartaglia) moderated the mock-debate. Also in 2004, Rod and Tartaglia appeared on the syndicated game show &quot;Hollywood Squares&quot;.

Regis Philbin and Kelly Ripa puppets created by Lyon hosted the first few minutes of an episode of &quot;Live with Regis and Kelly&quot;. In addition, Rod and John Tartaglia did &quot;man on the street&quot;-style interviews on the 2005 NBC broadcast of the Macy&#x27;s Thanksgiving Day Parade. Rod and John also appeared alongside other Broadway stars in a World AIDS Day benefit concert of &quot;Pippin&quot; held at the Manhattan Center on November 29, 2004; Rod played &quot;The Head.&quot;

In another Broadway Cares/Equity Fights AIDS benefit in 2005, the original cast of &quot;Avenue Q&quot; and the cast of the Broadway revival of &quot;Fiddler on the Roof&quot; presented a 10-minute spoof of both musicals called &quot;Avenue Jew.&quot; Trekkie Monster poorly plays the &quot;Fiddler&quot; theme, pauses, and eats the fiddle. Tevye, his wife Golde and two of their daughters, having immigrated to the US, arrive on Avenue Jew, an area inhabited by Jewish versions of the &quot;Avenue Q&quot; characters. The human cast expresses frustration at being upstaged by the puppets in the song &quot;The Puppets/The Humans.&quot; Jewish-American Princeton asks &quot;What do you do with a B.A. in Yiddish?&quot; Tevye&#x27;s daughter Shprintze falls in love with Princeton; Tevye forbids her union to a puppet but later relents. Princeton laments, &quot;If I were a human&quot;. Rod sings &quot;Matchmaker, Matchmaker&quot; begging the matchmaker (played by Mrs. Thistletwat) to find him a Jewish husband. She sets Rod up with Lazar Wolf; the two ask permission to be married from the Tsar puppet, who forbids a gay marriage, only to be interrupted by theater critic Ben Brantley, who objects to casting non-Jewish actors in &quot;Fiddler.&quot; The company concludes &quot;everyone&#x27;s a little bit Jewish&quot;. Princeton and Shprintze return in wedding attire, and the cast raises a chuppah adorned with a furry orange &quot;Avenue Q&quot; logo.

In November 2005, the &quot;Avenue Q&quot; website held a &quot;One Night Stand&quot; contest for amateur puppeteers and their puppets. Andrew MacDonald Smith and his puppet Maurice Tipo won, and on March 10, 2006, appeared in the evening performance in the opening song, the café scene, and the curtain call. In October 2006, Jonathan Root and Princeton presented the award for Best Young Adult Novel at the Quill Awards. In November 2006, the London cast appeared on the BBC program &quot;Children in Need&quot; and performed &quot;It Sucks to Be Me&quot;. In December 2006, the London cast performed on the Royal Variety Performance and performed &quot;It Sucks to Be Me&quot;, &quot;For Now&quot;, and &quot;Special&quot;, in which Lucy the Slut suggested through lyrics and dialogue that she was making a pass at (then) Prince Charles.

The cast and puppets took to the stage at Trafalgar Square on July 4, 2009, as part of the &quot;London Pride 2009&quot; celebration, performing &quot;If You Were Gay&quot;, &quot;Special&quot; and &quot;For Now&quot;, with Lucy the Slut assuring all the ladies in the audience that she is bisexual. Cast members appeared on &quot;Late Night with Jimmy Fallon&quot; on August 13, 2009, to promote the last month of shows, performing &quot;The Internet is for Porn&quot; for the first time on national television. As a response to the Muppets&#x27; Bohemian Rhapsody video, &quot;Avenue Q&quot; created a video called &quot;We Will Rock Q&quot;. Released on YouTube on May 4, 2010, it features the Off-Broadway cast performing covers of the Queen songs &quot;We Will Rock You&quot; and &quot;We Are the Champions&quot;.

The cast appeared on the Today Show in 2018 to promote the show&#x27;s 15th year.

==Original Broadway cast recording==
The original cast recording was made on August 10, 2003, at Right Track Studio A in New York City, produced by Jay David Saks for RCA Victor. The album contains almost all of the music from the show, with the original Broadway cast and orchestra. Released on October 6, 2003, it has been in the top ten of the &quot;Billboard&quot; Top Cast Album Chart since the chart&#x27;s launch on January 12, 2006. It was nominated in the Musical Show Album category for a 2004 Grammy Award. According to &quot;Playbill&quot;, it was likely the first cast recording to use a Parental Advisory label.

==Critical reception==
&quot;Avenue Q&quot; received nearly unanimous favorable reviews, both nationally and internationally.

&quot;The New York Times&quot; theatre critic Ben Brantley called it a &quot;...savvy, sassy and eminently likable...breakthrough musical&quot;, and compared its potential long-term influence to &quot;West Side Story&quot; and &quot;The King and I&quot;. &quot;The New Yorker&quot; described it as &quot;...an ingenious combination of &#x27;The Real World&#x27; and &quot;Sesame Street&quot;&quot;. &quot;The Times&quot; described it as &quot;...how &quot;Friends&quot; might be if it had Fozzie Bear and Miss Piggy arguing about their one-night stand, but with more angst, expletives and full-on puppet sex.&quot;

&quot;Avenue Q&quot; made &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;&#x27;s 2010 end-of-the-decade &quot;best-of&quot; list: &quot;This 2003 smash musical is &quot;Sesame Street&quot; for grown-ups, with filthy-minded puppets who teach useful lessons like &#x27;The Internet Is for Porn.&#x27; Somewhere, Big Bird is molting.&quot;

Iisalmi traces its roots back to 1627, when the parish of Iisalmi was formed around the local church. The town&#x27;s old wooden church, Gustav Adolf Church, was consecrated in 1780.

In the 18th century, when Finland was under Swedish control, Sweden was frequently at war with Imperial Russia, and the area of Koljonvirta in Iisalmi was a battlefield on which one of the greatest Swedish victories (and the last Swedish victory on Finnish soil) occurred. However, Sweden lost its last war with Russia and had to surrender Finland to the Russian Empire in 1809.

Iisalmi gained its status as town on October 20, 1891.

One memorable event, of the many, is &quot;Rompepäivät&quot;, which translates as &quot;the days of old junk and stuff&quot;. People gather together bringing various old items, from small sewing needles to old tractors, for everyone to see and many small things to be sold. A few old restored cars, trucks, motorcycles and tractors, some of them Finnish-made, are displayed for others to see. Here people talk about &quot;good old times&quot; or wonder over &quot;ancient artifacts&quot;. Sometimes some of the finely restored machines are for sale to anyone interested to buy—of course if they can afford it.

&quot;Oluset&quot; is a music festival organized each July annually. The main sponsor is local brewery company Olvi. &quot;Oluset&quot; roughly translates to &quot;a few beers&quot;. Also a smaller festival, &quot;Limuset&quot; (&quot;Little soft drink festival&quot; is organize as well by Olvi. &quot;Limuset&quot; is mainly dedicated to kids and young people, and no alcoholic drinks are sold in the area.

According to the Guinness Book of Records, the world&#x27;s smallest restaurant, Kuappi, is located in Iisalmi.

=== Music ===
Currently the most famous Iisalmi-based band is a humorous country-rock orchestra Halavatun Papat. A rough translation of the name is &quot;Damn Grandfathers&quot;.
