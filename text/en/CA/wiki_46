<text>Kyabje Nawang Gehlek Rimpoche () was a Tibetan Buddhist lama born in Lhasa, Tibet on October 26, 1939. His personal name was Gelek; &quot;kyabje&quot; and &quot;rimpoche&quot; are titles meaning &quot;teacher&quot; (lit., &quot;lord of refuge&quot;) and &quot;precious,&quot; respectively; he is known to Tibetans as Nyakre Khentrul Rinpoche. According to Thupten Jinpa, principal English translator to the Dalai Lama, he is considered Known for his memory, intellectual insight, familiarity with modern culture, and effectiveness as a teacher of Western practitioners of Tibetan Buddhism, Rimpoche taught in English without a translator, claiming he learned &quot;English watching the soap opera Days of Our Lives.&quot;

==Early life and education==
Gelek Rimpoche was recognized at the age of four as a tulku, an incarnate lama. He was &quot;recognized as the incarnation of one of the Gyuto Tantric College abbots called Tashi Namgyal. I believe I was recognized by the late Pabongka Dechen Nyingpo – the famous Pabongka.&quot; His father was the 10th Demo Rinpoche and his uncle was the 13th Dalai Lama, Thubten Gyatso. He received the highest scholastic degree of Geshe Lharampa, equivalent to a PhD, at the exceptionally young age of twenty, at Drepung Monastic University which he attended from the age of four to twenty. 

He was educated alongside the 14th Dalai Lama, Tenzin Gyatso who said &quot;he completed his traditional Buddhist training as a monk in Tibet prior to the Chinese Takeover.&quot; Rimpoche was tutored by many of Tibet&#x27;s greatest teachers including the 14th Dalai Lama&#x27;s senior and junior tutors, Kyabje Ling Rinpoche and Kyabje Trijang Rinpoche, who sent him to the West to teach, and Denma Locho Rinpoche and Song Rinpoche. 

==Exile==
In 1959, ten days after the Dalai Lama fled to India, Gelek Rimpoche led a large group of Tibetans from Tibet into exile in India. 
He then settled at a temporary camp with other lamas and monks in Buxa, India, where his education continued, although &quot;there were no books, and classes had to be taught from memory only.&quot; He was one of the first students of the Young Lamas Home School. 

Later, he relinquished monastic life. &quot;Many other Rinpoches, including Kyabje Trijang Rinpoche and Kyabje Ling Rinpoche, told me, “Even though you didn’t remain as a monk, it doesn’t mean you’ve resigned as a rinpoche.” They told me I still have to carry the banner of Buddhism. So that’s how it is.&quot; He was named director of Tibet House in New Delhi, India, in 1965. In the 1970s, he served as head of Tibetan services and as a radio host at All India Radio. He preserved over 170 volumes of rare Tibetan manuscripts that would have otherwise been lost and conducted over 1000 interviews, compiling an oral history of the fall of Tibet to Communist China that is in the US Library of Congress&#x27; Tibetan Oral History Archive Project. In 1964, he was an exchange student at Cornell University. 

==Life in the west==
Rimpoche moved to Ann Arbor, Michigan, in 1987 to teach Buddhism at the request of two local women, Aura Glaser and Sandra Finkel, who met him on a trip to India during the mid-1980s. He first taught in Ann Arbor in 1985. He helped a Case Western Reserve professor write a book on Tibetan history for two years in Cleveland, then moved to Ann Arbor. In 1988, with Glaser and Finkel, he founded and was president of Jewel Heart, a nonprofit &quot;spiritual, cultural, and humanitarian organization that translates the ancient wisdom of Tibetan Buddhism into contemporary life,&quot; in Ann Arbor, which has expanded to Bloomfield Hills, Michigan, Chicago, Cleveland, Nebraska, New York, Malaysia, and The Netherlands. The Dalai Lama visited Jewel Heart in Ann Arbor in 2008.

Beat poet Allen Ginsberg was among the more prominent of Jewel Heart&#x27;s members. Ginsberg met with Gelek Rinpoche through the modern composer Philip Glass in 1989, and they became great friends. Allen and Philip jointly staged benefits for the Jewel Heart organization. Professor Robert Thurman, Joe Liozzo, and Glenn Mullin, are also Jewel Heart members and frequent lecturers. Cyndi Lee also teaches at Jewel Heart. Lodi Gyari Rinpoche, Venerable Thubten Chodron, and Michael Imperioli were also students of Rimpoche&#x27;s. He became an American citizen in July 1994.

Gelek Rinpoche died on February 15, 2017, in Ann Arbor, Michigan, after undergoing surgery the previous month. 

Demo Rinpoche, Rimpoche&#x27;s nephew, has served as Jewel Heart’s Resident Spiritual Director, since 2018.

In 2021 Tibet House US in New York City, partnered with the Allen Ginsberg estate, and Jewel Heart International, on &quot;Transforming Minds: Kyabje Gelek Rimpoche and Friends&quot;, a gallery show, video, and eventually online exhibition, of photos and drawings by Allen Ginsberg with whom Rimpoche had an “indissoluble bond,&quot; exemplifying the &quot;transformational nature of this time in US history.&quot; &quot;Fifty negatives guided by Allen’s extensive notes on the contact sheets and images he’d circled with the intention to print,&quot; featured images of Rimpoche with friends, including &quot;other great Tibetan masters, including Ribur Rimpoche and Khyongla Rato Rimpoche, images we had not known about,&quot; and &quot;monks, Tibetologists, friends, and students, including Philip Glass, artist Francesco Clemente, founder of Tibet House US, Robert Thurman, poet Anne Waldman, and songwriter, singer, and poet, Patti Smith.&quot;

==Publications==
Gehlek Rimpoche assisted Melvyn C. Goldstein in his writing of &quot;A History of Modern Tibet, Volume 1: The Demise of the Lamaist State, 1913-1951&quot;.

In 2001, Rimpoche&#x27;s teaching with many biographical details, &quot;Good Life, Good Death: Tibetan Wisdom on Reincarnation&quot;, with a foreword by the Dalai Lama, and an introduction by Robert Thurman, was published. &quot;Buddhist readers will cheer about this fresh voice, and even those who don&#x27;t believe in reincarnation will find something valuable in this short meditation on death. 

Many of Rimpoche&#x27;s teachings since the mid 1980s, including intermediate and vajrayana lightly edited transcripts and books, are available.

==Archive==
The Gelek Rimpoche Archive, &quot;arguably are the largest, or one of the largest collections of authentic Tibetan Buddhist teachings in English of a Tibetan master,&quot; was established online by the Gelek Rimpoche Foundation. Free of charge, the archive contains more than five hundred teachings and more informal talks comprising over 1800 video and 2900 audio files, often accompanied by searchable verbatim and compiled transcripts.

<doc id="769680" wikidata="Q1505781" url="?curid=769680" title="Castellan">
<text>A castellan, or constable, was the governor of a castle in medieval Europe. Its surrounding territory was referred to as the castellany. The word stems from . A castellan was almost always male, but could occasionally be female, as when, in 1194, Beatrice of Bourbourg inherited her father&#x27;s castellany of Bourbourg upon the death of her brother, Roger. Similarly, Agnes became the castellan of Harlech Castle upon the death of her husband John de Bonvillars in 1287. The title of &quot;governor&quot; is retained in the English prison system, as a remnant of the medieval idea of the castellan as head of the local prison. 

==Initial functions==
During the Migration Period after the fall of the Western Roman Empire (third to sixth century), foreign tribes entered Western Europe, causing strife. The answer to recurrent invasion was to create fortified areas which evolved into castles. Some military leaders gained control of several areas, each with a castle. The problem lay in exerting control and authority in each area when a leader could only be in one place at a time. To overcome this, they appointed castellans as their trusted vassals to manage a castle in exchange for obligations to the landlord, often a noble. In the 9th century, as fortifications improved and kings had difficulty making their subordinates pay their taxes or send the military aid they demanded, castellans grew in power, holding their fiefdoms without much concern for their overlord&#x27;s demands. This changed as kings grew in power and as the Holy Roman Emperors replaced recalcitrant vassals with rival ministerial appointments.

==Duties==

Usually the duties of a castellan consisted of military responsibility for the castle&#x27;s garrison, maintaining defences and protecting the castle&#x27;s lands, combined with the legal administration of local lands and workers including the castle&#x27;s domestic staff. The responsibility applied even where there was no resident castellan at the castle, or if he was frequently absent. A castellan could exercise the power of the &quot;ban&quot; – that is, to hear court cases and collect fines, taxes from residents, and muster local men for the defence of the area or the realm. There are similarities with a lord of the manor. Castellans had the power to administer all local justice, including sentencing and punishments up to and including the death penalty, as when, in 1111, the Salzburg castellan caught the &quot;minister&quot; fomenting armed rebellion and had the offender blinded, &quot;as one would a serf&quot;. Later the castellan came to serve as the representative of the people of his castellany. So happened in the case of the castellan of Bruges, when the burghers stood up for more privileges and liberties from the counts of Flanders.

===Castellans and Jews===
A particular responsibility in western Europe concerned jurisdiction over the resident Jewish communities bordering the English Channel. The Constable of the Tower of London and those castellans subordinate to the dukes of Normandy were responsible for their administration. Vivian Lipman posits four reasons for this: the castles provided defence, they were centres of administration, their dungeons were used as prisons, and castellans could turn to the Jewish community to borrow money as usury was forbidden to Catholics.

==Castellany==
A &quot;castellany&quot;, or castellania, is a term denoting a district administered by a castellan. Castellanies appeared during the Middle Ages and in most current states are now replaced by a more modern type of county subdivision. The word is derived from castle and literally means the extent of land and jurisdiction attached to a given castle.

There are equivalent, often cognate, terms in other languages. Examples of French &quot;châtelainies&quot; include the castellanies of Ivry-la-Bataille, Nonancourt, Pacy-sur-Eure, Vernon and Gaillon, all in Normandy, which under in the treaty of Issoudun of 1195, after a war with King Richard I of England, were acquired for the French crown by Philip Augustus.

Examples of castellanies in Poland include: Łęczyca and Sieradz (both duchies at one time), Spycimierz, Rozprza, Wolbórz now in the Lodz Voivodeship, and Wojnicz now in the Lesser Poland Voivodeship or Otmuchów in Silesia.

==National differences==

===France===

In France, castellans (known in French as châtelains) who governed castellanies without a resident count, acquired considerable powers such that the position became hereditary. By the tenth century, the fragmentation of power had become so widespread that in Mâcon, for instance, where the castellany was the basic unit of governance, there was no effective administrative level above it, so that the counts of Mâcon were largely ignored by their subordinate castellans from about 980 to 1030. In the 12th century &quot;châtelains&quot; had become &quot;lords&quot; in their own right and were able to expand their territories to include weaker castellanies. Thus the castellan of Beaujeu was able to take over lands in Lyons, or the castellan of Uxelles annexed first Briançon, then Sennecey-le-Grand and finally l&#x27;Épervière.

In other areas, castellans did not manage to rise to noble status and remained the local officer of a noble. During the Ancien Régime, castellans were heads of local royal administration, and their power was further delegated to their lieutenants.

All remaining lordships and local royal administrators were suppressed during the French Revolution. During the 19th and 20th centuries, &quot;châtelain&quot; was used to describe the owner of a castle or manor house, in many cases a figure of authority in his parish, akin to the English squire.

===German lands===

 In Germany the castellan was known as a &quot;Burgmann&quot;, or sometimes &quot;Hauptmann&quot; (&quot;captain&quot;), who reported to the lord of the castle, or &quot;Burgherr&quot;, also often known as the burgrave (&quot;Burggraf&quot;). The &quot;burgmann&quot; may have been either a free noble or a &quot;ministerialis&quot;, but either way, he administered the castle as a vassal. A &quot;ministerialis&quot;, was wholly subordinate to a lord and was under his control. &quot;Ministeriales&quot; replaced free nobles as castellans of Hohensalzburg under Conrad I of Abensberg’s tenure as Archbishop of Salzburg from 1106 to 1147, beginning with Henry of Seekirchen in the 1130s.

===Hungary===
In the Medieval Kingdom of Hungary the castellan was called &quot;várnagy&quot;, and in the Latin chronicles he appeared as &quot;castellanus&quot;. The lord of the castle had very similar functions to those in German lands. In Hungary the King initially designated castellans from among his court for the administration of castles and estates. Later designation of castellans devolved to the most powerful noblemen.

===Jerusalem===
At one time there was a castellan nominated from among the Officers of the Kingdom of Jerusalem. Anselm was the first such castellan, c. 1110.

===Malta===

A castellan was established in Valletta on the island of Malta.

===Poland===

In the Kingdom of Poland and later the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, castellans () were the lowest rung of the territorial administration of the country and deferred to voivodes (with the exception of the Burgrave of Kraków (Polish &quot;Burgrabia krakowski&quot;) who had precedence over the Voivode of Kraków). Castellans were in charge of a subdivision of a voivodeship called the &quot;castellany&quot; (Polish &quot;Kasztelania&quot;) until the 15th-century. From then on castellanies, depending on their size, either became provinces, or in the case of smaller domains were replaced by powiats and the castellan role became honorific and was replaced &quot;in situ&quot; by a Starosta. Castellans in the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth were of senatorial rank and were often appointed from the nobility, but not exclusively so.

===Portugal===
In Portugal, a castellan was known as an &quot;Alcaide&quot;. Later, the role of the &quot;alcaide&quot; became an honorary title awarded by the King of Portugal to certain nobles. As the honorary holder of the office of &quot;alcaide&quot; did not often live near the castle, a delegate started to be appointed to effectively govern it in his place. An honorary holder of the office became known as &quot;alcaide-mor&quot; (major &quot;alcaide&quot;) and the delegate became known as the &quot;alcaide pequeno&quot; (little &quot;alcaide&quot;) or the &quot;alcaide-menor&quot; (minor &quot;alcaide).

<doc id="769682" wikidata="Q421559" url="?curid=769682" title="Reverse-transcriptase inhibitor">
<text>Reverse-transcriptase inhibitors (RTIs) are a class of antiretroviral drugs used to treat HIV infection or AIDS, and in some cases hepatitis B. RTIs inhibit activity of reverse transcriptase, a viral DNA polymerase that is required for replication of HIV and other retroviruses.

==Mechanism of action==
When HIV infects a cell, reverse transcriptase copies the viral single stranded RNA genome into a double-stranded viral DNA. The viral DNA is then integrated into the host chromosomal DNA, which then allows host cellular processes, such as transcription and translation, to reproduce the virus. RTIs block reverse transcriptase&#x27;s enzymatic function and prevent completion of synthesis of the double-stranded viral DNA, thus preventing HIV from multiplying.

A similar process occurs with other types of viruses. The hepatitis B virus, for example, carries its genetic material in the form of DNA, and employs an RNA-dependent DNA polymerase to replicate. Some of the same compounds used as RTIs can also block HBV replication; when used in this way they are referred to as polymerase inhibitors.

==Types==
RTIs come in four forms:
* Nucleoside analog reverse-transcriptase inhibitors (NARTIs or NRTIs)
* Nucleotide analog reverse-transcriptase inhibitors (NtARTIs or NtRTIs)
* Non-nucleoside reverse-transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs)
* Nucleoside reverse transcriptase translocation inhibitor (NRTTIs).

The antiviral effect of NRTIs and NtRTIs is essentially the same; they are analogues of the naturally occurring deoxynucleotides needed to synthesize the viral DNA and they compete with the natural deoxynucleotides for incorporation into the growing viral DNA chain. However, unlike the natural deoxynucleotides substrates, NRTIs and NtRTIs lack a 3′-hydroxyl group on the deoxyribose moiety. As a result, following incorporation of an NRTI or an NtRTI, the next incoming deoxynucleotide cannot form the next 5′–3′ phosphodiester bond needed to extend the DNA chain. Thus, when an NRTI or NtRTI is incorporated, viral DNA synthesis is halted, a process known as chain termination. All NRTIs and NtRTIs are classified as competitive substrate inhibitors.
Unfortunately, NRTIs/NtRTIs compete as substrates for not only viral but also host DNA synthesis, acting as chain terminators for both. The former explains NRTIs&#x27;/NtRTIs&#x27; antiviral effect, while the latter explains their drug toxicity/side effects.

In contrast, NNRTIs have a completely different mode of action. NNRTIs block reverse transcriptase by binding directly to the enzyme. NNRTIs are not incorporated into the viral DNA like NRTIs, but instead inhibit the movement of protein domains of reverse transcriptase that are needed to carry out the process of DNA synthesis. NNRTIs are therefore classified as non-competitive inhibitors of reverse transcriptase.

===Nucleoside analog reverse-transcriptase inhibitors (NARTIs or NRTIs)===
Nucleoside analog reverse-transcriptase inhibitors (NARTIs or NRTIs) compose the first class of antiretroviral drugs developed. In order to be incorporated into the viral DNA, NRTIs must be activated in the cell by the addition of three phosphate groups to their deoxyribose moiety, to form NRTI triphosphates. This phosphorylation step is carried out by cellular kinase enzymes. NRTIs can induce mitochondrial impairment that leads to a number of adverse events, including symptomatic lactic acidosis.
* Zidovudine, also called AZT, ZDV, and azidothymidine, has the trade name Retrovir. Zidovudine was the first antiretroviral drug approved by the FDA for the treatment of HIV.
* Didanosine, also called ddI, with the trade names Videx and Videx EC, was the second FDA-approved antiretroviral drug. It is an analog of adenosine.
* Zalcitabine, also called ddC and dideoxycytidine, has the trade name Hivid. This drug has been discontinued by the manufacturer.
* Stavudine, also called d4T, has trade names Zerit and Zerit XR.
* Lamivudine, also called 3TC, has the trade name Zeffix and Epivir. It is approved for the treatment of both HIV and hepatitis B.
* Abacavir, also called ABC, has the trade name Ziagen, is an analog of guanosine.
* Emtricitabine, also called FTC, has the trade name Emtriva (formerly Coviracil). Structurally similar to lamivudine, it is approved for the treatment of HIV and undergoing clinical trials for hepatitis B.
* Entecavir, also called ETV, is a guanosine analog used for hepatitis B under the trade name Baraclude. It is not approved for HIV treatment.
* Truvada, made of emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate, is used to treat and prevent HIV. It is approved for HIV prevention in the US and manufactured by Gilead.
* Azvudine, also called RO-0622. It has been investigated as a possible treatment of AIDS, hepatitis C, and SARS-CoV-2

====Nucleotide analog reverse-transcriptase inhibitors (NtARTIs or NtRTIs)====
As described above, host cells phosphorylate nucleoside analogs to nucleotide analogs. The latter serve as poison building blocks (chain terminators) for both viral and host DNA, causing respectively the desired antiviral effect and drug toxicity/side effects. Taking phosphonate nucleotide analog reverse-transcriptase inhibitors (NtARTIs or NtRTIs) directly obviates the initial phosphorylation step, but host enzymes must still phosphorylate the phosphonate nucleotide analogue to the phosphonate-diphosphate state for anti-viral activity. These molecules were first synthesized by Antonin Holy at the Czech Academy of Sciences, and commercialized by Gilead.
* Tenofovir, also known as TDF is a so-called &#x27;prodrug&#x27; with the active compound deactivated by a molecular side chain that dissolves in the human body allowing a low dose of tenofovir to reach the site of desired activity. One example of the prodrug form is tenofovir disoproxil fumarate with the trade name Viread (Gilead Sciences Inc USA). It is approved in the US for the treatment of both HIV and hepatitis B.
* Adefovir, also known as ADV or bis-POM PMPA, has trade names Preveon and Hepsera. It is not approved by the FDA for treatment of HIV due to toxicity issues, but a lower dose is approved for the treatment of hepatitis B.

While often listed in chronological order, NRTIs/NtRTIs are nucleoside/nucleotide analogues of cytidine, guanosine, thymidine and adenosine:
* Thymidine analogues: zidovudine (AZT) and stavudine (d4T)
* Cytidine analogues: zalcitabine (ddC), lamivudine (3TC), and emtricitabine (FTC)
* Guanosine analogues: abacavir (ABC) and entecavir (ETV)
* Adenosine analogues: didanosine (ddI), tenofovir (TDF), and adefovir (ADV)

===Non-nucleoside reverse-transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs)===
Non-nucleoside reverse-transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs) are the third class of antiretroviral drugs that were developed. In all cases, patents remain in force until beyond 2007. This class of drugs was first described at the Rega Institute for Medical Research (Belgium).
* Efavirenz has the trade names Sustiva and Stocrin.
* Nevirapine has the trade name Viramune.
* Delavirdine, currently rarely used, has the trade name Rescriptor.
* Etravirine has the trade name Intelence, and was approved by the FDA in 2008.
* Rilpivirine has the trade name Edurant, and was approved by the FDA in May 2011.
* Doravirine has the trade name Pifeltro, is developed by Merck &amp; Co. It was FDA-approved in August 2018. It is also used in a combination tablet as doravirine/lamivudine/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (Delstrigo).
* Elsulfavirine, sold as Elpida, was approved by Russian Ministry of Health in 2017 and is currently used on its own or in fixed-dose combination with tenofovir disoproxil and emtricitabine (Elpida Combi).

===Nucleoside reverse transcriptase translocation inhibitor (NRTTIs)===
This is a new class of antivirals, MK-8591 or Islatravir being the first agent of this group. Islatravir was developed by Merck &amp; Co. It is orally available, long acting antiviral, being tested as ART against HIV-1.

===Portmanteau inhibitors===

Researchers have designed molecules which dually inhibit both reverse transcriptase (RT) and integrase (IN). These drugs are a type of &quot;portmanteau inhibitors&quot;.

==Mechanisms of resistance to reverse transcriptase inhibitors==
While NRTIs and NNRTIs alike are effective at terminating DNA synthesis and HIV replication, HIV can and eventually does develop mechanisms that confer the virus resistance to the drugs. HIV-1 RT does not have proof-reading activity. This, combined with selective pressure from the drug, leads to mutations in reverse transcriptase that make the virus less susceptible to NRTIs and NNRTIs.
Aspartate residues 110, 185, and 186 in the reverse transcriptase polymerase domain are important in the binding and incorporation of nucleotides. The side chains of residues K65, R72, and Q151 interact with the next incoming nucleotide. Also important is L74, which interacts with the template strand to position it for base pairing with the nucleotide. Mutation of these key amino acids results in reduced incorporation of the analogs.

===NRTI resistance===
There are two major mechanisms of NRTI resistance. The first being reduced incorporation of the nucleotide analog into DNA over the normal nucleotide. This results from mutations in the N-terminal polymerase domain of the reverse transcriptase that reduce the enzyme&#x27;s affinity or ability to bind to the drug . A prime example for this mechanism is the M184V mutation that confers resistance to lamivudine (3TC) and emtricitabine (FTC). Another well characterized set of mutations is the Q151M complex found in multi-drug resistant HIV which decreases reverse transcriptase&#x27;s efficiency at incorporating NRTIs, but does not affect natural nucleotide incorporation. The complex includes Q151M mutation along with A62V, V75I, F77L, and F116Y. A virus with Q151M alone is intermediately resistant to zidovudine (AZT), didanosine (ddI), zalcitabine (ddC), stavudine (d4T), and slightly resistant to abacavir (ABC). A virus with Q151M complexed with the other four mutations becomes highly resistant to the above drugs, and is additionally resistant to lamivudine (3TC) and emtricitabine (FTC).

The second mechanism is the excision or the hydrolytic removal of the incorporated drug or pyrophosphorolysis. This is a reverse of the polymerase reaction in which the pyrophosphate/PPI released during nucleotide incorporation reacts with the incorporated drug (monophosphate) resulting in the release of the triphosphate drug. This &#x27;unblocks&#x27; the DNA chain, allowing it to be extended, and replication to continue. Excision enhancement mutations, typically M41L, D67N, K70R, L210W, T215Y/F, and K219E/Q, are selected for by thymidine analogs AZT and D4T; and are therefore called thymidine analog mutations (TAMs). Other mutations including insertions and deletions in the background of the above mutations also confer resistance via enhanced excision.

===NNRTI resistance===
NNRTIs do not bind to the active site of the polymerase but in a less conserved pocket near the active site in the p66 subdomain. Their binding results in a conformational change in the reverse transcriptase that distorts the positioning of the residues that bind DNA, inhibiting polymerization. Mutations in response to NNRTIs decrease the binding of the drug to this pocket. Treatment with a regimen including efavirenz (EFV) and nevirapine (NVP) typically results in mutations L100I, Y181C/I, K103N, V106A/M, V108I, Y188C/H/L and G190A/S.
There are three main mechanisms of NNRTI resistance. In the first NRTI mutations disrupt specific contacts between the inhibitor and the NNRTI binding pocket. An example of this is K103N and K101E which sit at the entrance of the pocket, blocking the entrance/binding of the drug. A second mechanism is the disruption of important interactions on the inside of the pocket. For example, Y181C and Y188L result in the loss of important aromatic rings involved in NNRTI binding. The third type of mutations result in changes in the overall conformation or the size of the NNRTI binding pocket. An example is G190E, which creates a steric bulk in the pocket, leaving little or no room for an NNRTI to tightly bind.

<text>The ICC Men&#x27;s Test Team Rankings (formerly known as the ICC Test Championship) is an international rankings system of the International Cricket Council for the 12 teams that play Test cricket. The rankings are based on international matches that are otherwise played as part of regular Test cricket scheduling, with no consideration of home or away status.

After every Test series, the two teams involved receive points based on a mathematical formula involving both teams&#x27; previous rating and the result of the series. Each team&#x27;s points total from matches over the last 3–4 years is divided by a figure based on their total number of matches and series played, to give a &quot;rating&quot;.

A drawn match between higher and lower rated teams will benefit the lower-rated team at the expense of the higher-rated team. An &quot;average&quot; team that wins as often as it loses, while playing a mix of stronger and weaker teams, will have a rating of 100.

The top ranked Test team was previously awarded the ICC Test Championship mace, until the inauguration of ICC World Test Championship. From 2003 to 2019, the mace was transferred whenever a new team moved to the top of the rating list. The team that was top of the ratings table on 1 April each year also won a cash prize.

==Current rankings ==
==Historical rankings==
The ICC provides ratings for the end of each month back to June 2003. The teams that have successively held the highest rating since that date, by whole month periods are:
The summary of teams that have held the highest rating from June 2003 to the present by whole month periods are:
Since the ICC officially began ranking teams in 2003, Australia had dominated the rankings table. However, from 2009, several teams (Australia, South Africa, India, England, New Zealand, and Pakistan) have competed for the top positions. 

The ICC retrospectively applied the current rating system to results since 1952 (providing ratings for the end of each month from then). The table only begins then, as prior to 1952 there is insufficient data available due to the infrequency of matches and the small number of competing teams in these earlier periods.

The teams that have successively held the highest rating from January 1952 until May 2003, by whole month periods are:
The summary of teams that have held the highest rating from 1952 to the present by whole month periods are:
==ICC Test Championship (2003–2019)==
The rankings system was called ICC Test Championship, until the inauguration of ICC World Test Championship in 2019. From 2003 to 2019, the top-ranked Test team was awarded with the ICC Test Championship Mace and the top team at each April 1 cut-off (until 2019) was also awarded a cash prize, the winners of which are listed below. The mace is now awarded to the winners of the ICC World Test Championship.

== Calculations ==

===Qualifying matches===
Matches that qualify are those played as part of a series consisting of at least two Tests.

===Time period===
===Find the points earned from a series===
Each time two teams complete another series, the rankings tables is updated as described below, based on the ratings of the teams immediately before they played.

====Step 1. Find the series points for each team====

* Award 1 point to a team for each match won.
* Award point to a team for each match drawn or tied.
* Award 1 bonus point to the team winning the series.
* Award bonus point to each team if the series is drawn.

====Step 2. Convert these series points to actual ratings points====

If the gap between the ratings of the two teams before the series was less than 40 points

The ratings points for each team equals:


As each match won earns a team 1 series point and their opponent 0, losing earns them 0 series points and their opponent 1, and drawing earns both teams series point, each match played therefore earns teams ratings points as follows:
As this formula only applies when the gap between the ratings of the two teams at the start of the series was less than 40 points, winning a match will always earn a team more rating points than the rating they already had, and losing a match will always earn a team fewer rating points than the rating they already had. Drawing a match will earn the weaker team more rating points than the rating they already had, and the stronger team fewer.

The difference between winning and losing a single match is therefore 100 points. Also, whether the outcome of a match is a win &amp; lose or a draw, the total rating points earned by the two teams from that match will be the sum of the two teams&#x27; ratings before the series began. The total rating points earned from a series will therefore equal the sum of the two teams&#x27; ratings before the series began multiplied by (the number of matches + 1).

If the gap between the ratings of the two teams before the series was at least 40 points

The ratings points for the stronger team equals:


and the ratings points for the weaker team equals:


As above, each match played therefore earns teams ratings points as follows:
Therefore, again, winning a match will always earn a team more rating points than the rating they already had, and losing a match will always earn a team fewer rating points than the rating they already had. Drawing a match will earn the weaker team more points than the rating they already had, and the stronger team fewer.

For both teams, the difference between winning and losing a single match is still 100 points. Also, whichever of the three outcomes happens, the total rating points earned by the two teams from that match will be the sum of the two teams&#x27; ratings before the series began.

===Update the ranking table===

For each team:
*Add the ratings points scored to their total ratings points already scored (in previous matches).
*Update the number of matches played by adding the number of Series points available. This is one more than the number of games in the series, as there is an additional point available for the series winner (a two Test match series will result in the match count getting incremented by three).
*Divide the new rating points total by the updated number of matches to get the updated Rating.

===Example===

Suppose two teams, initially with ratings of 120 and 90, play a 3-match series, and the team with the higher initial rating wins 2–1:

*The total Ratings points available from the series (460+380=840) is the same as the initial ratings of the teams multiplied by the number of Series points available ((120+90)x4=840).
*The two teams&#x27; total ratings is almost exactly the same after the series (119.4+90.5=209.9) as before the series (120+90=210). The series has therefore not generated any extra ratings, but has just redistributed the ratings the two teams already had. When these ratings are published in the official table in their rounded form (119 and 91), the total ratings after the series will be exactly the same as before the series. There is therefore no points &#x27;inflation&#x27; in this system, which means that comparisons of ratings over time are meaningful.
*Despite winning the series, Team A&#x27;s rating has reduced, and despite losing the series, Team B&#x27;s rating has increased. If Team A had won the series 3–0 then its rating would have increased to 122.4.

<text>A graphical widget (also graphical control element or control) in a graphical user interface is an element of interaction, such as a button or a scroll bar. Controls are software components that a computer user interacts with through direct manipulation to read or edit information about an application. User interface libraries such as Windows Presentation Foundation, Qt, GTK, and Cocoa, contain a collection of controls and the logic to render these.

Each widget facilitates a specific type of user-computer interaction, and appears as a visible part of the application&#x27;s GUI as defined by the theme and rendered by the rendering engine. The theme makes all widgets adhere to a unified aesthetic design and creates a sense of overall cohesion. Some widgets support interaction with the user, for example labels, buttons, and check boxes. Others act as containers that group the widgets added to them, for example windows, panels, and tabs.

Structuring a user interface with widget toolkits allows developers to reuse code for similar tasks, and provides users with a common language for interaction, maintaining consistency throughout the whole information system.

Graphical user interface builders facilitate the authoring of GUIs in a WYSIWYG manner employing a user interface markup language. They automatically generate all the source code for a widget from general descriptions provided by the developer, usually through direct manipulation.

== History ==
Around 1920, &quot;widget&quot; entered American English, as a generic term for any useful device, particularly a product manufactured for sale; a gadget.

In 1988, the term &quot;widget&quot; is attested in the context of Project Athena and the X Window System. In &quot;An Overview of the X Toolkit&quot; by Joel McCormack and Paul Asente, it says:

The toolkit provides a library of user-interface components (&quot;widgets&quot;) like text labels, scroll bars, command buttons, and menus; enables programmers to write new widgets; and provides the glue to assemble widgets into a complete user interface.
The same year, in the manual &quot;X Toolkit Widgets - C Language X Interface&quot; by Ralph R. Swick and Terry Weissman, it says:

In the X Toolkit, a widget is the combination of an X window or sub window and its associated input and output semantics.
Finally, still in the same year, Ralph R. Swick and Mark S. Ackerman explain where the term &quot;widget&quot; came from:

We chose this term since all other common terms were overloaded with inappropriate connotations. We offer the observation to the skeptical, however, that the principal realization of a widget is its associated X window and the common initial letter is not un-useful.
==Usage==

Any widget displays an information arrangement changeable by the user, such as a window or a text box. The defining characteristic of a widget is to provide a single interaction point for the direct manipulation of a given kind of data. In other words, widgets are basic visual building blocks which, combined in an application, hold all the data processed by the application and the available interactions on this data.

GUI widgets are graphical elements used to build the human-machine-interface of a program. GUI widgets are implemented like software components. Widget toolkits and software frameworks, like e.g. GTK+ or Qt, contain them in software libraries so that programmers can use them to build GUIs for their programs.

A family of common reusable widgets has evolved for holding general information based on the Palo Alto Research Center Inc. research for the Xerox Alto User Interface. Various implementations of these generic widgets are often packaged together in widget toolkits, which programmers use to build graphical user interfaces (GUIs). Most operating systems include a set of ready-to-tailor widgets that a programmer can incorporate in an application, specifying how it is to behave. Each type of widget generally is defined as a class by object-oriented programming (OOP). Therefore, many widgets are derived from class inheritance.

In the context of an application, a widget may be &quot;enabled&quot; or &quot;disabled&quot; at a given point in time. An enabled widget has the capacity to respond to events, such as keystrokes or mouse actions. A widget that cannot respond to such events is considered disabled. The appearance of a widget typically differs depending on whether it is enabled or disabled; when disabled, a widget may be drawn in a lighter color (&quot;grayed out&quot;) or be obscured visually in some way. See the adjacent image for an example.

The benefit of disabling unavailable controls rather than hiding them entirely is that users are shown that the control exists but is currently unavailable (with the implication that changing some other control may make it available), instead of possibly leaving the user uncertain about where to find the control at all. On pop-up dialogues, buttons might appear greyed out shortly after appearance to prevent accidental clicking or inadvertent double-tapping.

Widgets are sometimes qualified as &quot;virtual&quot; to distinguish them from their physical counterparts, e.g. &quot;virtual&quot; buttons that can be clicked with a pointer, vs. physical buttons that can be pressed with a finger (such as those on a computer mouse).

A related (but different) concept is the desktop widget, a small specialized GUI application that provides some visual information and/or easy access to frequently used functions such as clocks, calendars, news aggregators, calculators and desktop notes. These kinds of widgets are hosted by a widget engine.

== List of common generic widgets ==


===Selection and display of collections===
* Button – control which can be clicked upon to perform an action. An equivalent to a push-button as found on mechanical or electronic instruments.
** Radio button – control which can be clicked upon to select one option from a selection of options, similar to selecting a radio station from a group of buttons dedicated to radio tuning. Radio buttons always appear in pairs or larger groups, and only one option in the group can be selected at a time; selecting a new item from the group&#x27;s buttons also de-selects the previously selected button.
** Check box – control which can be clicked upon to enable or disable an option. Also called a tick box. The box indicates an &quot;on&quot; or &quot;off&quot; state via a check mark/tick ☑ or a cross ☒. Can be shown in an intermediate state (shaded or with a dash) to indicate that various objects in a multiple selection have different values for the property represented by the check box. Multiple check boxes in a group may be selected, in contrast with radio buttons.
** Toggle switch - Functionally similar to a check box. Can be toggled on and off, but unlike check boxes, this typically has an immediate effect.
** Toggle Button - Functionally similar to a check box, works as a switch, though appears as a button. Can be toggled on and off.
** Split button – control combining a button (typically invoking some default action) and a drop-down list with related, secondary actions
** Cycle button - a button that cycles its content through two or more values, thus enabling selection of one from a group of items.
* Slider – control with a handle that can be moved up and down (vertical slider) or right and left (horizontal slider) on a bar to select a value (or a range if two handles are present). The bar allows users to make adjustments to a value or process throughout a range of allowed values.
* List box – a graphical control element that allows the user to select one or more items from a list contained within a static, multiple line text box.
* Spinner – value input control which has small up and down buttons to step through a range of values
* Drop-down list – A list of items from which to select. The list normally only displays items when a special button or indicator is clicked.
* Menu – control with multiple actions which can be clicked upon to choose a selection to activate
** Context menu – a type of menu whose contents depend on the &quot;context&quot; or state in effect when the menu is invoked
** Pie menu – a circular context menu where selection depends on direction
* Menu bar – a graphical control element which contains drop down menus
* Toolbar – a graphical control element on which on-screen buttons, icons, menus, or other input or output elements are placed
** Ribbon – a hybrid of menu and toolbar, displaying a large collection of commands in a visual layout through a tabbed interface.
* Combo box (text box with attached menu or List box) – A combination of a single-line text box and a drop-down list or list box, allowing the user to either type a value directly into the control or choose from the list of existing options.
* Icon – a quickly comprehensible symbol of a software tool, function, or a data file.
* Tree view – a graphical control element that presents a hierarchical view of information
* Grid view or datagrid – a spreadsheet-like tabular view of data that allows numbers or text to be entered in rows and columns.

===Navigation===
* Link – Text with some kind of indicator (usually underlining and/or color) that indicates that clicking it will take one to another screen or page.
* Tab – a graphical control element that allows multiple documents or panels to be contained within a single window
* Scrollbar – a graphical control element by which continuous text, pictures, or any other content can be scrolled in a predetermined direction (up, down, left, or right)

===Text/value input===
* Text box – (edit field) - a graphical control element intended to enable the user to input text

===Output===
* Label – text used to describe another widget
* Tooltip – informational window which appears when the mouse hovers over another control
* Balloon help
* Status bar – a graphical control element which poses an information area typically found at the window&#x27;s bottom
* Progress bar – a graphical control element used to visualize the progression of an extended computer operation, such as a download, file transfer, or installation
* Infobar – a graphical control element used by many programs to display non-critical information to a user

===Container===
* Window – a graphical control element consisting of a visual area containing some of the graphical user interface elements of the program it belongs to
* Collapsible panel – a panel that can compactly store content which is hidden or revealed by clicking the tab of the widget.
** : Side sheets or surfaces containing supplementary content that may be anchored to, pulled out from, or pushed away beyond the left or right edge of the screen.
* Accordion – a vertically stacked list of items, such as labels or thumbnails where each item can be &quot;expanded&quot; to reveal the associated content
* Modal window – a graphical control element subordinate to an application&#x27;s main window which creates a mode where the main window can not be used.
* Dialog box – a small window that communicates information to the user and prompts for a response
* Palette window – also known as &quot;Utility window&quot; - a graphical control element which floats on top of all regular windows and offers ready access tools, commands or information for the current application
** Inspector window – a type of dialog window that shows a list of the current attributes of a selected object and allows these parameters to be changed on the fly
* Frame – a type of box within which a collection of graphical control elements can be grouped as a way to show relationships visually
* Canvas – generic drawing element for representing graphical information
* Cover Flow – an animated, three-dimensional element to visually flipping through snapshots of documents, website bookmarks, album artwork, or photographs.
* Bubble Flow – an animated, two-dimensional element that allows users to browse and interact the entire tree view of a discussion thread.
* Carousel (computing) – a graphical widget used to display visual cards in a way that&#x27;s quick for users to browse, both on websites and on mobile apps

<doc id="769707" wikidata="Q4798332" url="?curid=769707" title="Arthur Corbett, 3rd Baron Rowallan">
<text>Captain Arthur Cameron Corbett, 3rd Baron Rowallan (17 December 1919 – 24 June 1993), was a British aristocrat most notable for successfully having his second marriage annulled in 1970 on the grounds that his wife April Ashley, a transgender woman, was legally male. This case is known as &quot;Corbett v Corbett&quot;.

==Early life==
Arthur Cameron Corbett was born on 17 December 1919 to Thomas Godfrey Polson Corbett, 2nd Baron Rowallan (1895–1977), who was Chief Scout of the British Commonwealth and Empire and served as Governor of Tasmania from 1959 to 1963, and Gwyn Melvyn Grimond, daughter of Joseph Bowman Grimond of St Andrews, Fife. His maternal uncle was Jo Grimond, Baron Grimond, the leader of the Liberal Party 1956–67.

He was one of six children born to his parents. One of his four brothers was killed in action in 1944. He was educated at Eton.

===Peerage===
He succeeded his father, Thomas Corbett, as the 3rd Baron Rowallan on 30 November 1977. Upon his death in 1993, his eldest son, John Corbett, 4th Baron Rowallan, succeeded to his title, Baron Rowallan.

==Personal life==
===First marriage and children===
In 1945, he married Eleanor Mary Boyle. They had four children:

* John Polson Cameron Corbett, 4th Baron Rowallan (born 8 March 1947)
* Hon Sarah Elizabeth Cameron Corbett (born 5 April 1949)
* Hon Anne Mary Cameron Corbett (born 3 September 1953)
* Hon Rosalind Eleanor Cameron Corbett (born 2 January 1958)

The couple divorced in 1961.

===Second marriage===

In November 1960, Corbett met April Ashley, a successful fashion model, who appeared in &quot;Vogue&quot; (photographed by David Bailey) and in the film &quot;The Road to Hong Kong&quot;, which starred Bing Crosby and Bob Hope. They married in 1963, but the marriage quickly broke down.

Ashley&#x27;s lawyers wrote to Corbett in 1966 demanding maintenance payments and in 1967 Corbett responded by filing suit to have the marriage annulled. The annulment was granted in 1970 on the grounds that Ashley was male, even though Corbett knew about her history when they married. The argument was accepted, and the case served as a precedent until the Gender Recognition Act 2004.

==Later life and death==
Corbett later moved to Marbella, Spain, where he died after undergoing surgery on his leg for gangrene on 24 June 1993, at the age of 73.

<text>The ICC Men&#x27;s ODI Team Rankings (formerly known as the ICC ODI Championship) is an international One Day International (ODI) cricket rankings system of the International Cricket Council (ICC). After every ODI match, the two teams involved receive points based on a mathematical formula. Each team&#x27;s points total is divided by their total number of matches played to give a rating, and all the teams are ranked in a table in order of rating.

By analogy to cricket batting averages, the points for winning an ODI match are always greater than the team&#x27;s rating, increasing the rating, and the points for losing an ODI match are always less than the rating, reducing the rating. A drawn match between higher and lower rated teams will benefit the lower-rated team at the expense of the higher-rated team. An &quot;average&quot; team that wins as often as it loses while playing a mix of stronger and weaker teams should have a rating of 100.

, India leads the ICC Men&#x27;s ODI Team Rankings, with a rating of 118 from 45 weighted matches, while the lowest rated team, UAE, has a rating of 12 from 30 weighted matches.

Until 2013, the team ranked number one at the annual 1 April cut-off date received the ICC ODI Championship Shield and prize money. The rankings were used to award direct qualification for the Cricket World Cup in 2019 and 2027.

==Current rankings ==
== Associate rankings ==

In late 2005, the International Cricket Council ranked the top non-Test nations from 11–30 to complement the Test nations&#x27; rankings in the ICC Men&#x27;s ODI Team Rankings. The ICC used the results from the 2005 ICC Trophy and WCQS Division 2 competition (i.e. the primary qualification mechanisms for the 2007 Cricket World Cup) to rank the nations.

These rankings were used to seed the initial stage of the global World Cricket League. Teams ranked 11–16 were placed into Division 1; teams 17–20 were placed into Division 2; teams 21–24 were placed into Division 3; the remaining teams were placed into the upper divisions of their respective regional qualifiers.

As of 19 April 2009 the top six associates gained one day status. Kenya and Ireland have both qualified to appear on the main rating table, Kenya from its existing status and Ireland for its two victories in the 2007 World Cup. Following their victory over Bangladesh in July 2010, the Netherlands joined the main table. Afghanistan, Canada and Scotland remain on the secondary table. In May 2009, the ICC added a rankings table for all associate members. This contained both global and regional placings. In June 2018, the four associates with ODI status were moved to the main ranking list.

== Historical rankings ==

The ICC provides ratings for the end of each month back to October 2002. This table lists the teams that have successively held the highest rating since that date, by whole month periods.

In 2011, the ICC applied its rating system to results since 1981, providing ratings for the end of each month back to 1981, further indicating Australia&#x27;s historical dominance in ODI Cricket with the highest number of months ranked first (200 months). The table only begins from 1981 as, prior to this date, there is not enough data available due to the infrequency of matches and the small number of competing teams in the earlier periods.

The teams that have successively held the highest rating since January 1981 until September 2002, by whole month periods, are:
The summary of teams that have held the highest rating since 1981 until present by whole month periods, are:
== ICC ODI championship (2002–2013)==

The rankings system was formerly called the ICC ODI championship and, until 2013, the team at the top of the table at the start of each April was awarded the ICC ODI Championship Shield. Like a 2 euro coin, the shield features an inner circle of gold-coloured metal and is surrounded by a ring of silver-coloured metal. It was first presented in December 2002, when Australian captain Ricky Ponting received the award.

It was last presented in July 2013, when Indian captain MS Dhoni received the award.

== Points calculations ==

===Time period===
===Find the points earned from a match===
Each time two teams play another match, the rankings table is updated as follows, based on the ratings of the teams immediately before they played. To determine the teams&#x27; new ratings after a particular match, first calculate the points earned from the match:

If the gap between the ratings of the two teams before the match was less than 40 points, then:

If the gap between the ratings of the two teams before the match was at least 40 points, then:

* Each team&#x27;s rating is equal to its total points scored divided by the total matches played. (Series are not significant in these calculations). 
* Add the match points scored to the points already scored (in previous matches as reflected by the Table), add one to the number of matches played, and determine the new rating.
* Points earned by teams depend on the opponent&#x27;s ratings, therefore this system needed to assign base ratings to teams when it started.

<text>Hellabrunn Zoo () is a 40 hectare (99 acre) zoological garden in the Bavarian capital of Munich. The zoo is situated on the right bank of the river Isar, in the southern part of Munich near the quarter of Thalkirchen.

A high ratio of enclosures are cageless, relying upon moat features to keep the animals in place.
The zoo was the first zoo in the world not organized by species, but also by geographical aspects. For example, the wood bison share their enclosure with prairie dogs.

In 2013, the zoo was ranked the fourth best zoo in Europe (up from 12th). It focuses on conservation and captive breeding rare species such as the rare drill and silvery gibbons. Also gorillas, giraffes, elephants, wood bisons, elk and Arctic foxes were successfully bred in the zoo, which houses many species. It is one of the very few zoos that allows visitors to bring dogs.

Tierpark Hellabrunn is a member of the European Association of Zoos and Aquaria (EAZA) and the World Association of Zoos and Aquariums (WAZA) and participates in the European Endangered Species Programme (EEP).

== History ==

On 25 February 1905 the () was founded and the Hellabrunn area was chosen as the location for the zoo. The zoo was designed by architect Emanuel von Seidl, and opened to the public on 1 August 1911.
In 1922, the zoo was closed due to the inflation in Germany. It was re-opened on 23 May 1928. It became the first Geo-Zoo in the world (animals were shown and kept with other animals of the same geographic region). It also engaged in controversial back-breeding to &quot;recreate&quot; extinct animals like Heck cattle (to mimic the Aurochs) and the Tarpan.

Lutz Heck was a renowned zoologist in Nazi Germany, his brother Heinz Heck was director of Hellabrunn Zoo at the time. During World War II, the zoo sustained extensive damage due to strategic bombing by the Allies of World War II, but the zoo was able to reopen in May 1945.

In 1970, a badly needed plan for the renovation of the zoo was drawn up.

==Hellabrunn today==
In 2014 it was home to 18,943 animals representing 767 species.

The Tierpark Hellabrunn is very active in breeding, reintroduction and conservation projects.

Over 2.2 million people visited Hellabrunn in 2014.

As the groundwater level here is rather high and the water is of very good quality, the zoo can cover its needs for freshwater by using its own wells.

==Attractions==
*The elephant house: Constructed in 1914, renovated 2011–2016
*The new jungle house which houses gorillas, chimpanzees, Diana monkeys and American alligators
*Rare but very acrobatic silvery gibbons, spider monkeys and rare drills
*The new savannah house where visitors are separated only by a glass wall from the giraffes
*The aquarium with the piranha feeding
*&quot;Dracula&#x27;s villa&quot; – bats fly around visitors
*Many other buildings like the &quot;Polarium&quot;
* Guided tours – especially when it is dark and there is no one else in the zoo
* Children&#x27;s birthday parties

<doc id="769724" wikidata="Q632794" url="?curid=769724" title="Hawaiian–Emperor seamount chain">
<text>The Hawaiian–Emperor seamount chain is a mostly undersea mountain range in the Pacific Ocean that reaches above sea level in Hawaii. It is composed of the Hawaiian ridge, consisting of the islands of the Hawaiian chain northwest to Kure Atoll, and the Emperor Seamounts: together they form a vast underwater mountain region of islands and intervening seamounts, atolls, shallows, banks and reefs along a line trending southeast to northwest beneath the northern Pacific Ocean. The seamount chain, containing over 80 identified undersea volcanoes, stretches about from the Aleutian Trench off the coast of the Kamchatka peninsula in the far northwest Pacific to the Kamaʻehuakanaloa Seamount (formerly Lōʻihi), the youngest volcano in the chain, which lies about southeast of the Island of Hawaiʻi.

==Regions==
The chain can be divided into three subsections. The first, the Hawaiian archipelago (also known as the &quot;Windward isles&quot;), consists of the islands comprising the U.S. state of Hawaii. As it is the closest to the hotspot, this volcanically active region is the youngest part of the chain, with ages ranging from 400,000 years to 5.1 million years. The island of Hawaii is composed of five volcanoes, of which four (Kilauea, Mauna Loa, Hualalai, and Mauna Kea) are active. The island of Maui has one active volcano, Haleakalā. Kamaʻehuakanaloa Seamount continues to grow offshore of Hawaii island, and is the only known volcano in the chain in the submarine pre-shield stage.

The second part of the chain is composed of the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands, collectively referred to as the &quot;Leeward isles&quot;, the constituents of which are between 7.2 and 27.7 million years old. Erosion has long since overtaken volcanic activity at these islands, and most of them are atolls, atoll islands, and extinct islands. They contain many of the most northerly atolls in the world; Kure Atoll, in this group, is the northernmost atoll on Earth. On June 15, 2006, U.S. President George W. Bush issued a proclamation creating Papahānaumokuākea Marine National Monument under the Antiquities Act of 1906. The national monument, meant to protect the biodiversity of the Hawaiian isles, encompasses all of the northern isles, and is one of the largest such protected areas in the world. The proclamation limits tourism to the area, and called for a phase-out of fishing by 2011.

The oldest and most heavily eroded part of the chain are the Emperor seamounts, which are 39 to 85 million years old. The Emperor and Hawaiian chains form an angle of about 120°. This bend was long attributed to a relatively sudden change of 60° in the direction of plate motion, but research conducted in 2003 suggests that it was the movement of the hotspot itself that caused the bend. The issue continues to remain under academic debate. All of the volcanoes in this part of the chain have long since subsided below sea level, becoming seamounts and guyots. Many of the volcanoes are named after former emperors of Japan. The seamount chain extends to the West Pacific, and terminates at the Kuril–Kamchatka Trench, a subduction zone at the border of Russia.

==Formation==
The oldest confirmed age for one of the Emperor Seamounts is 81 million years, for Detroit Seamount. However, Meiji Seamount, located to the north of Detroit Seamount, is likely somewhat older.

In 1963, geologist John Tuzo Wilson hypothesized the origins of the Hawaiian–Emperor seamount chain, explaining that they were created by a hotspot of volcanic activity that was essentially stationary as the Pacific tectonic plate drifted in a northwesterly direction, leaving a trail of increasingly eroded volcanic islands and seamounts in its wake. An otherwise inexplicable kink in the chain marks a shift in the movement of the Pacific plate some 47 million years ago, from a northward to a more northwesterly direction, and the kink has been presented in geology texts as an example of how a tectonic plate can shift direction comparatively suddenly. A look at the USGS map on the origin of the Hawaiian Islands clearly shows this &quot;spearpoint&quot;.

In a more recent study, Sharp and Clague interpret the bend as starting at about 50 million years ago. They also conclude that the bend formed from a &quot;traditional&quot; cause—a change in the direction of motion of the Pacific plate.

However, recent research shows that the hotspot itself may have moved with time. Some evidence comes from analysis of the orientation of the ancient magnetic field preserved by magnetite in ancient lava flows sampled at four seamounts: this evidence from paleomagnetism shows a more complex history than the commonly accepted view of a stationary hotspot. If the hotspot had remained above a fixed mantle plume during the past 80 million years, the latitude as recorded by the orientation of the ancient magnetic field preserved by magnetite (paleolatitude) should be constant for each sample; this should also signify original cooling at the same latitude as the current location of the Hawaiian hotspot. Instead of remaining constant, the paleolatitudes of the Emperor Seamounts show a change from north to south, with decreasing age. The paleomagnetic data from the seamounts of the Emperor chain suggest motion of the Hawaiian hotspot in Earth&#x27;s mantle. Tarduno et al. have interpreted that the bend in the seamount chain may be caused by circulation patterns in the flowing solid mantle (mantle &quot;wind&quot;) rather than a change in plate motion.

There are two distinct interpretations for the cause of the bend in the seamounts of the Emperor chain as previously mentioned. First, that the bend was caused only by a change in the Pacific plate motion. Second, that the bend was caused by hotspot movement only. In 2004 geologist Yaoling Niu proposed a model that attributed the bend largely to a change in plate motion along with some motion in the hotspot. Niu proposes that the bend starts at 43 Ma which is caused by a &quot;trench jam&quot;. This &quot;trench jam&quot; is caused by the arrival of the Emperor chain seamounts at the northern subduction zone. These thick, buoyant seamounts resisted subduction and caused a reorientation of plate motion. Thus explains the sudden change in plate motion and is supported by the orientation of nearby island chains which also have a sudden bend which mirror the Emperor chain. As shown by Tarduno et al., the hotspot does show some north-south motion, but Yaoling&#x27;s model shows that for the bend to be attributed completely to hotspot motion, the pacific plate would have to remain stationary from 81 Ma to 43 Ma. Thus, is not true as magnetic anomalies on the pacific plate indicate motion of around 60 mm per year during that period. This model consisting of a change in plate motion combined with small north-south motions of the hotspot seems to be the best supported theory concerning the bend in the Emperor chain to date.

In addition to previous interpretations of the cause of the bend in the seamount chain, Hu et al. have proposed a close relationship between mantle plume migration and change in plate tectonic motion. Expanding on previous models, it has been interpreted that the Pacific Plate&#x27;s motion was predominantly in the northern direction prior to 47 million years ago. Traditionally, the force pulling the Pacific Plate to the north was attributed to the Izanagi - Pacific Ridge subduction zone. However, in a 2021 study, Hu et al. proposed that this subduction zone was not a strong enough force to have been pulling the Pacific Plate on its own. Instead, they introduced the concept that there was an intra-oceanic subduction zone involving the Kronotsky and Olyutorsky arcs. According to their findings, this subduction zone played a significant role in northern directional pull on the Pacific Plate. Around 47 million years ago, these northern forces came to an end. Near the same time, there were notable changes in the movement of the Hawaiian hotspot. Approximately 50 Ma, the Hawaiian hotspot started to drift to the south. However, there is not a widely accepted theory as to the mechanism that caused the hotspot to drift. The combination of these events along with new subduction zones in the west, could explain the large bend present in the Hawaiian - Emperor Seamount Chain.

==Aging==
The chain has been produced by the movement of the ocean crust over the Hawaii hotspot, an upwelling of hot rock from the Earth&#x27;s mantle. As the oceanic crust moves the volcanoes farther away from their source of magma, their eruptions become less frequent and less powerful until they eventually cease altogether. At that point erosion of the volcano and subsidence of the seafloor cause the volcano to gradually diminish. As the volcano sinks and erodes, it first becomes an atoll island and then an atoll. Further subsidence causes the volcano to sink below the sea surface, becoming a seamount and/or a guyot.

==Economic activity==
From the 1960s to the 1980s, the seamounts were intensively bottom trawled. Trawling has continued since then at lower rates, particularly by Japanese ships seeking &quot;Pentaceros wheeleri&quot;. The North Pacific Fisheries Commission regulates fishing in the area.

<doc id="769734" wikidata="Q5936115" url="?curid=769734" title="Hullshire">
<text>Hullshire, or the County of the Town of Kingston upon Hull, was a county corporate in the East Riding of Yorkshire, England, which was created in 1440. It was an area that was removed from the jurisdiction of the Sheriff of Yorkshire to come under the authority of the Sheriff of Kingston upon Hull instead. The term Hullshire was particularly used for the part of the county corporate that lay outside the borough of Kingston upon Hull, covering an area to the west of the borough containing the three parishes of Hessle, Kirk Ella and North Ferriby. In 1838 the county corporate was reduced in area to match the borough. The borough remained a county corporate with its own sheriff until 1974.

==History==
The borough of Kingston upon Hull (generally known as Hull) was granted county corporate status in 1440 in the reign of Henry VI, when it was given the right to appoint its own sheriff, giving it judicial independence from the Sheriff of Yorkshire. An area to the west of Hull was added to the county corporate in 1447. The area was self-governing in respect of it having its own courts, with powers of &quot;oyer and terminer&quot;, to hold assizes on civil and criminal cases. The county corporate then included the borough plus the parishes of Hessle, North Ferriby, and Kirk Ella, including the various townships which belonged to those parishes, including Swanland, West Ella, Tranby (an area south of Anlaby and north of Hessle), Willerby and Anlaby. The county corporate also included the extra-parochial area of Haltemprice Priory. The rights previously given to the town of Hull were extended to the county corporate, with the Mayor acting as the king&#x27;s escheator, and with the town bailiffs replaced by a sheriff and twelve aldermen, acting as justices of the peace, with the burgesses to answer before the mayor and sheriff first, not the king. The justices of the peace of the East Riding had no legal authority over the area. At the same time Hull Castle became the responsibility of the town.

In 1515 a skirmish or battle was fought between the Sheriff of Hull and the Prior of Haltemprice Priory over the authority over Willerby (Willarby) and Wolfreton (Woolfreton) – the Prior claimed that though the priory was within Hullshire it was not part of it, and was within the Lordship of Cottingham, and had taken the issue to the Star Chamber; the case was referred to the Abbott of Meaux; Bryan Palmes; and Sir William Constable who had decided in the Prior&#x27;s favour. Despite this decision on 6 October the Sheriff of Hull together with 200 people of the town began to approach Wolfreton; the Prior, who had been informed of the Sheriff&#x27;s intentions roused his tenants, and armed the monks of the Priory, who then blocked the roads, and hurled abuse on the Sheriff and his people. The Sheriff&#x27;s party returned the insults in turn using foul language. Subsequently, the altercation came to blows and a quarrel with arrows ensued. The battle continued until the monks, many being old or fat, gave way, and fled to their priory, followed by the Sheriff&#x27;s group. The situation was prevented from becoming more inflamed by the arrival of the Lord Mayor of Hull, who having learned of what was happening hastened to the scene with 60 horsemen. Subsequently, the Prior sought redress in the Star Chamber, with the Sheriff accused of riot and other crimes – the legal proceedings continued for three years at much expense, leading to the settlement that the Prior was given Willerby and Newton within his authority, whilst Hull obtained free right to the freshwater springs of Anlaby.

Sculcoates, Drypool, the southern part of Sutton (Sutton-on-Hull), Garrison Side as well as the liberties of Myton and Trippett were added to the parliamentary borough in 1832, and in 1836 the new municipal borough was made to be of the same extent. (see also Municipal Corporations Act 1835). The parishes of Hessle, Kirk Ella and North Ferriby (including their associated hamlets and townships) were removed from the county corporate in 1838, such that thereafter the county corporate covered the same area as the borough. The name Hullshire had primarily been used for the parts of the county corporate that lay outside the borough of Kingston upon Hull, and so the term Hullshire fell out of use after 1838.

The borough of Kingston upon Hull then remained a county corporate with its own sheriff until 1974. The borough boundaries were subsequently enlarged on several occasions. Newington (parishes of Kirk Ella and North Ferriby); Stoneferry; Marfleet and Newland were added in the second half of the 19th century. For most practical purposes, the county corporate was effectively superseded in 1889 when Hull became a county borough. (See Local Government Act 1888)

<doc id="769753" wikidata="Q7577146" url="?curid=769753" title="Spiff">
<text>A spiff, or spiv, is slang for an immediate bonus for a sale. Typically, spiffs are paid, either by a manufacturer or employer, directly to a salesperson for selling a &quot;specific&quot; product. It is sometimes given as SPIF or SPIFF, a backronym, with invented words to fit the letters, but these are not the origin (see below).

==Origin==
An early reference to a spiff can be found in a slang dictionary of 1859; &quot;The percentage allowed by drapers to their young men when they effect sale of old fashioned or undesirable stock.&quot; An article in the &quot;Pall Mall Gazette&quot; of 1890 on the practices in London shops uses the term:
a &quot;spiff&quot; system is usually adopted, spiffs being premiums placed on certain articles, &quot;not&quot; of the last fashion, indicated by a marvelous hieroglyphic put on the price ticket. These marks are well known by the assistant, and the almost invisible mystic sign explains why an article, wholly unsuitable, is foisted on the jaded customer as &quot;just the thing.&quot;

The Oxford English Dictionary suggests that (apart from a corruption of &quot;specific&quot;) it could be connected with the use of the word in that period to mean a dandy or somebody smartly dressed (hence spiffy, and to spiff up - to improve the appearance of a place or a person), but nobody seems to have been able to disentangle the threads of which came first, or what influenced what, or where the word originally came from.

==Practice==
In 1936 Rex Stout used the word in the Nero Wolfe mystery &quot;The Red Box&quot; (in chapter three): &quot;He stopped, smiling from Wolfe to me and back again like a haberdasher&#x27;s clerk trying to sell an old number with a big spiff on it.&quot; 

In 1947 it was reported that spiffs were prizes given to employees who sold particularly high amounts of electrical goods.

In 2019, Dell EMC use the term SPIF (Sales Performance Incentive Fund) to refer to programs designed to target business that might otherwise go to competitors.

<text>A double check valve or double check assembly (DCA) is a backflow prevention device designed to protect water supplies from contamination. It is different from the two-way check valves (sometimes erroneously referred to as double check valves) used in air brake systems on heavy trucks which select from the highest pressure source.

It consists of two check valves assembled in series. This employs two operating principles: firstly one check valve will still act, even if the other is jammed wide open. Secondly the closure of one valve reduces the pressure differential across the other, allowing a more reliable seal and avoiding even minor leakage.

Small valves may be so compact as to be barely noticeable particularly when they are integrated into the bodies of existing taps (faucets). Larger check valves may be installed with ball valves at the ends, for isolation and testing. Often, test cocks (very small ball valves) are in place to attach test equipment for evaluating whether the double check assembly is still functional.

The double check valve assembly is suitable for prevention of back pressure and back siphonage, but is not suitable for high hazard applications. It is commonly used on lawn irrigation, fire sprinkler and combi-boiler systems. If the hazard is higher, even a relatively low hazard such as using antifreeze in the fire sprinkler system, then a more reliable check valve such as a reduced pressure zone device may be mandated.

==Dual check valve==
A dual check backflow preventer is similar to a double check valve in operation. It has two independent spring-loaded check valves. However, dual check valves usually do not include shutoff valves, may or may not be equipped with test cocks or ports, and is generally less reliable than a double check valve.

<doc id="769766" wikidata="Q7837334" url="?curid=769766" title="Treaty with the Kalapuya, etc.">
<text>The Treaty with the Kalapuya, etc., also known as the Kalapuya Treaty or the Treaty of Dayton, was an 1855 treaty between the United States and the bands of the Kalapuya tribe, the Molala tribe, the Clackamas, and several others in the Oregon Territory. In it the tribes were forced to cede land in exchange for promised permanent reservation, annuities, supplies, educational, vocational, health services, and protection from ongoing violence from American settlers. The treaty effectively gave over the entirety of the Willamette Valley to the United States and removed indigenous groups who had resided in the area for over 10,000 years. The treaty was signed on January 22, 1855, in Dayton, Oregon, ratified on March 3, 1855, and proclaimed on April 10, 1855.

It is not to be confused with the Treaty with the Umpqua and Kalapuya of 1854, also known as the Treaty of Calapooia Creek.

==Background==
In the mid-1830s — partially driven by public interest in the concept of manifest destiny — the option of expanding across North America emerged. Following this, writers began exhorting Congress to occupy the Oregon Territory. This drove some of the first American settlers to the region, and the development of the Oregon Trail began to bring larger numbers to the area by the early 1840s. Unlike California, which was at the time still controlled by Mexico, the lands that later became the Oregon Territory were only tentatively claimed by American or European settlers. Starting in the late 1700s, American and European explorers and settlers introduced a series of diseases, causing epidemics that decimated the populations of the Santiam, Tualatin, Yamhill, Luckiamute Kalapuyan, and other indigenous peoples who lived in the region. By the 1850s, the remaining indigenous population had few options when faced with increased harassment and land encroachment from those who believed that the United States should reach to the Pacific Ocean.

Many of the early American &#x27;settlers&#x27; moved to the Willamette Valley, a fertile region drained by the Willamette River, the home to Kalapuyan tribes for over 10,000 years. The Americans were not the first white settlers there; a group of French Canadians, former employees of the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company, had made their homes in the French Prairie area of the valley. The Americans who arrived almost immediately began sending petitions and letters back east requesting the United States government to formally claim the area and protect them from real or perceived threats, both from the indigenous residents they were displacing and the British.

These Americans were part of a geopolitical rivalry between the United States and Great Britain over who would control the Oregon Territory, which comprised the modern states of Oregon, Washington, Idaho, a portion of Montana, and the province of British Columbia. In 1846, the two powers concluded the Oregon Treaty, dividing the territory in half, disregarding the indigenous peoples inhabiting the lands. The lands of the Willamette Valley were thereafter part of the Oregon Territory of the United States, even though local tribes had yet to cede their land.

==Treaty==
Congress appointed its first treaty commission to Native Americans in the region in 1850. Within a year, the commissioners had negotiated agreements with the Santiam, Tualatin, Yamhill, and Luckiamute bands of the Kalapuya. These peoples were forced to give up their lands in return for settlement on a series of reservations. However, before the commission had completed its work, Congress had revoked its credentials, and the treaties were never ratified.

The natives continued to encounter conflict with white settlers. Oregon&#x27;s early history includes numerous violent incidents between settlers and natives, including the Rogue River War to the south, which occurred in the early 1850s. While conflict in the Willamette Valley was not as overt, small-scale violence between settlers and natives was commonplace. In 1855, Joel Palmer, the Oregon Superintendent of Indian Affairs, concluded a second treaty with the remaining bands of natives. This treaty, generally referred to as the Kalapuya Treaty after the overarching name of the natives in the area, gave almost all of the Willamette Valley to the United States. The natives secured promises in return of a reservation and long-term support from the United States government in the form of money, supplies, health care, and the promise of protection from further attacks by settlers. At the time the treaty was signed, only 400 Kalapuya natives remained, having been reduced by disease and conflict.

In 1855 and 1856, these remaining natives were forcibly resettled in what became the Grand Ronde Reservation, along with members of other native Oregonian groups. The reservation would continue to be served and recognized by the United States government until 1954, when the government terminated its trusteeship with the reservation. However, because the Kalapuya Treaty had been ratified by Congress and was therefore legally enforceable, it was used by the Kalapuya, now one of the Confederated Tribes of the Grand Ronde, to regain federal support in 1983.

==Tribes and bands included==

According to the text of the treaty, the following bands were included:
*Tualatin band of Calapooias
*Yam Hill band
*Cheluk-i-ma-uke band
*Chep-en-a-pho or Marysville band
*Chem-a-pho or Maddy band
*Che-lam-e-la or Long Tom band
*Mo-lal-la band of Mo-lal-las (Upper Molalla)
*Calapooia band of Calapooias
*Winnefelly and Mohawk bands
*Tekopa band
*Chafan band of the Calapooia tribe
*Wah-lal-la band of Tum-waters
*Clack-a-mas tribe
*Clow-we-wal-la or Willamette Tum-water band
*Santiam bands of Calapooias

<doc id="769774" wikidata="Q8018007" url="?curid=769774" title="William S. Richardson School of Law">
<text>The William S. Richardson School of Law is the professional graduate law school of the University of Hawaiʻi at Mānoa. Located in Honolulu, Hawaii, the school is named after its patriarch, former Hawaii State Supreme Court Chief Justice William S. Richardson, a zealous advocate of Hawaiian culture, and is Hawaii&#x27;s only law school.

Richardson&#x27;s regime of legal studies places special emphasis on fields of law of particular importance to Hawaii and the surrounding Pacific and Asian region, including Native Hawaiian Law, Pacific-Asian Legal Studies, Environmental Law, and maritime law.

A member of the Association of American Law Schools (AALS), the school is accredited by the Council of the Section of Legal Education and Admissions to the Bar of the American Bar Association (ABA). It offers a Juris Doctor, with certificates available in Native Hawaiian Law, Pacific-Asian Legal Studies, and Environmental Law, with students able to matriculate either full-time or part-time. It also offers an Advanced Juris Doctor, for foreign students who have earned a law degree abroad, and a LLM.

For 2021, &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot; ranked Richardson 96th among American law schools. Richardson&#x27;s part-time program was ranked 30th.

==William S. Richardson==
The establishment of the Law School in 1973, was considered the achievement of former Hawaii State Supreme Court Chief Justice, William S. Richardson. For many years he had pressed the Hawaii State Legislature for its creation, arguing that the state would benefit by providing a legal education for its residents that enveloped its cultural customs—because they had the greatest stake in constructing the state&#x27;s legal traditions going forward as such. At his retirement, the Law School was named in his honor.

==Ethos==
The spirit of Richardson&#x27;s culture as a community devoted to the study of law is manifested in Kānāwai Māmalahoe, the fundamental precept of Hawaiian law.

Originating in a royal edict by King Kamehameha I in 1797, galvanizing the Kingdom of Hawai&#x27;i&#x27;s legal system, Kānāwai Māmalahoe, or Law of the Splintered Paddle, was enshrined later in the Hawaii State Constitution, Article 9, Section 10.

According to Hawaiian legend, Kānāwai Māmalahoe was declared by King Kamehameha after an incident where he chased two fishermen who were fishing illegally, when he caught his leg in the reef, and one of the fisherman, Kaleleiki, hit him mightily on the head with a paddle in defense, which broke into pieces. Luckily, Kamehameha was able to escape. Years later, when the same fisherman was brought before him to account for the incident, Kamehameha held that in the interest of justice he should be released, as he had only been searching for food for his family.

Reflecting Kānāwai Māmalahoe, the school maintains a &quot;commitment... to a collaborative community that is deeply committed to the... pursuit of social and economic justice&quot; for all. Reflecting this commitment, its unofficial logo is Kaleleiki, the fisherman.

===Law student pledge===

Richardson School of Law Law Student Pledge, written by late Professor Chris Iijima, before a Hawaii Supreme Court Justice during a special ceremony before they begin their legal education.
The Pledge is:

&quot;In the study of law, I will conscientiously prepare myself;&quot;

&quot;To advance the interests of those I serve before my own,&quot;

&quot;To approach my responsibilities and colleagues with integrity, professionalism, and civility,&quot;

&quot;To guard zealously legal, civil and human rights which are the birthright of all people,&quot;

&quot;To endeavor always to seek justice.&quot;

<doc id="769777" wikidata="Q3110103" url="?curid=769777" title="Golden Spikes Award">
<text>The Golden Spikes Award is bestowed annually to the best amateur baseball player in the United States. The award, created by USA Baseball and sponsored by the Major League Baseball Players Association, was first presented in 1978. It is given to an amateur player who best exhibits and combines &quot;exceptional on-field ability and exemplary sportsmanship&quot;. The award is considered the most prestigious in amateur baseball.

Ten winners of the Golden Spikes Award are members of the National College Baseball Hall of Fame, including Bob Horner, the inaugural winner in 1978. In that same year, he was the first overall MLB draft pick and proceeded to win the Rookie of the Year Award. Seven Golden Spikes Award winners went on to become the first overall MLB draft pick. Only Horner achieved the MLB Rookie of the Year Award in the same year (although Jason Jennings and Buster Posey were voted the top rookies of the National League several years after winning the Golden Spikes Award). Jim Abbott, Jered Weaver and Tim Lincecum are the only award winners to pitch an MLB no-hitter, while Horner is the only one to hit four home runs in one MLB game. Furthermore, 17 players won the Dick Howser Trophy (considered to be the Heisman Trophy of college baseball) alongside the Golden Spikes Award. No player has won the award more than once, and no Golden Spikes recipient has yet been inducted into the National Baseball Hall of Fame.

The winner has been announced annually during a live broadcast of ESPN&#x27;s &quot;SportsCenter&quot; since 2014. Immediately following the announcement, the award winner and the other finalists are honored at a banquet in Los Angeles. The most recent recipient of the award is Charlie Condon of the Georgia Bulldogs. Although it can be given to any amateur player, the award has always been given to a college baseball player.

<text>Billy Eugene Self Jr. (born December 27, 1962) is an American basketball coach who is the head coach of the Kansas Jayhawks men&#x27;s basketball team. Self has held various coaching roles at the collegiate level and has been the coach of the Jayhawks since 2003.

At Kansas, Self has led the team to 17 Big 12 regular season championships (including an NCAA record 14 consecutive Big 12 regular season championships), four NCAA Final Four appearances (2008, 2012, 2018, 2022), and to the NCAA Championship in 2008 and 2022. Self has a record of 292–16 (.948 win percentage) at Allen Fieldhouse, and he has had three home winning streaks of more than 30 wins (including a school-record and 11th-best all-time 69 game streak). During his tenure at Kansas, he has recruited several McDonald&#x27;s All-Americans and coached many players who went onto the NBA.

Self was inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame in 2017. At the end of the 2021–22 season, Self had the 18th most wins among Division I coaches in NCAA history and 4th among active head coaches. He is the winningest coach in Kansas history, having passed Hall of Famer Phog Allen on November 12, 2024, and is the only coach in Kansas history to lead Kansas to multiple NCAA Tournament National Championships. Self was the highest paid NCAA basketball coach for the 2021–22 season earning $10,184,282. He signed a lifetime contract extension with the Jayhawks in 2021. In 2022, Self became the seventh coach to win multiple NCAA tournament championships since the tournament field expanded to 64 teams in 1985.

==Early life==
Bill Eugene Self Jr. was born in Okmulgee, Oklahoma, where his father was the girls&#x27; basketball coach at nearby Morris High School. Self attended Edmond Memorial High School, where he was named Oklahoma High School Basketball Player of the Year in 1981.

==Playing career==
Self received a basketball scholarship to play at Oklahoma State University. He was a letter winner all four years he played. He graduated with a bachelor&#x27;s degree in business in 1985 and a master&#x27;s degree in athletic administration in 1989, both from Oklahoma State.

==Collegiate coaching history==

===Early coaching jobs===
In 1985, Self joined Larry Brown&#x27;s coaching staff at the University of Kansas. He remained at Kansas as an assistant coach for the 1985–1986 season. Between 1986 and 1993, Self was an assistant coach at Oklahoma State University under Leonard Hamilton, followed by Eddie Sutton. Self&#x27;s first head coaching position came at Oral Roberts who hired him in 1993. In his first season at ORU, the team managed only six wins. Things improved slightly the following year, when ORU won ten games. In Self&#x27;s third season, he guided the Golden Eagles to an 18–9 record, and in his fourth season, (1996–1997), ORU registered a 21–7 record as the school made its first postseason tournament appearance since its 1983–1984 appearance in the National Invitation Tournament.

After rebuilding the Golden Eagles, Self was hired by crosstown rival Tulsa and spent three seasons (1998 to 2000) there, compiling a Tulsa-best 74–27 record. While at TU, Self coached the Golden Hurricane to consecutive NCAA tournament appearances in 1999 and 2000. In the 1999–2000 season, in addition to setting a school single-season record for victories by compiling a 32–5 record, Self led the Golden Hurricane to its first-ever Elite Eight appearance.

On June 9, 2000, Illinois named Self the head coach of their basketball program. In Self&#x27;s three seasons in Illinois, he led the Fighting Illini to two Big Ten regular-season championships, a Big Ten tournament title, and three straight NCAA tournament appearances.

===Kansas===
Kansas hired Self as head coach in 2003. He took over for Roy Williams who left for his former team, North Carolina, after KU lost the 2003 National Championship game to Syracuse. In his first season at Kansas, Self led the Jayhawks to the Elite Eight in the NCAA tournament, where they fell to Georgia Tech. In August 2008, Self signed a new 10-year contract guaranteeing him $3 million annually, making him the second-highest-paid coach in college basketball at the time, following Florida&#x27;s Billy Donovan.

Between 2007 and 2011, Self&#x27;s KU teams won 165 games, an average of 33.0 wins a year, passing Mike Krzyzewski of Duke (164 wins, 32.8 a year from 1998 to 2002) and Jerry Tarkanian of UNLV (163 wins, 32.6 a year from 1987 to 1991) for the highest 5-year win total of any men&#x27;s basketball coach in Division I history.

In the 2010–11 season, Self led the Jayhawks past North Carolina to end the season at number 2 on the all-time wins list, trailing leader Kentucky by 14 games (List of teams with the most victories in NCAA Division I men&#x27;s college basketball). The Jayhawks entered the 2012 NCAA tournament as a #2-seed in the Midwest Regional and ultimately lost in the championship game to Kentucky 67–59. The Jayhawks concluded the year with a 32–7 record, and Self was named the Naismith Coach of the Year. On November 18, 2016, after an 86–65 win over Siena, Self passed Ted Owens for most wins at Allen Fieldhouse with 207. On December 6, 2016, Self achieved his 600th win with a 105–62 win over UMKC. He is the 9th fastest coach in NCAA history to win 600 games. On February 18, 2017, Self was announced as one of 14 finalists named from over 100 candidates to be inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame in his first year of eligibility. The inductees were announced April 3 prior to the National Championship game. 

In September 2019, Self and the Kansas program were served a Notice of Allegations by the NCAA for five Level 1 violations, a head coach responsibility charge against Self personally, and a lack of institutional control charge against the University of Kansas. Self&#x27;s individual punishments could include a suspension or an effective ban from college basketball for several years or more (a &quot;show cause&quot; penalty against any program looking to hire Self). Self has denied throughout the investigation that the Kansas coaching staff knew Adidas was paying recruits to go there.

On April 2, 2021, Self signed a lifetime contract with Kansas. Every year after the initial five years, an extra year will be automatically added to the contract and that will continue until he retires or dies. The financial terms of the contract were not immediately disclosed. During the 2021–22 season, Self led Kansas to its fourth NCAA National Championship in program history, capped by a 72–69 victory over North Carolina in the National Championship game on April 4, 2022. The Jayhawks overcame a 16-point deficit and a 15-point halftime deficit to win, both NCAA title game records. By winning the title, combined with the retirements of Mike Krzyzewski and Jay Wright at the end of the season, Self moved into a tie with Rick Pitino as the only active coaches with two national championships.

On November 2, the University of Kansas suspended Self for the first four games of the 2022–23 season after a recruiting violation, which included the team&#x27;s Champions Classic game against Duke. Just before the start of the Big 12 Tournament, Self endured a health issue and was unable to coach the Jayhawks for the postseason. Kansas assistant Norm Roberts took over. The Jayhawks would go on to the title game of the Big 12 tournament, losing to Texas. They received the one seed in the west region, beating Howard before losing to Arkansas.

In 2023, due to recruiting violations, 15 of the Jayhawks wins from the 2017–18 season, their Final Four appearance, Big 12 regular season title, and Big 12 Tournament title were all vacated by the NCAA. On November 7, 2023, Self signed an amended lifetime contract with Kansas. The contract was signed to continue being a lifetime contract, however, the amended contract gave him a raise to make him the highest paid coach in the country.

==Head coaching record==















==Personal life==

Self is married with two children, a daughter and a son. His daughter graduated from Kansas in 2013. His son, Tyler, played basketball at Kansas from 2012 to 2017 and was the general manager for the Austin Spurs of the NBA G League until 2022. Self is a Christian.

In June 2006, Self and his wife, Cindy, established the ASSISTS foundation, a 501(c)(3) organization to serve as a fundraising conduit for organizations that serve a variety of youth initiatives.

<text>Andrey II Yaroslavich (; – 1264) was the third son of Yaroslav II who succeeded his uncle Sviatoslav III as Grand Prince of Vladimir in 1249. Three years later, he challenged the Mongols and was ousted by them.

The house of Nizhny Novgorod-Suzdal, which has been known since the 14th century as the House of Shuysky, descends from Andrey II.

==Life==
=== Early 1240s campaigns === 

According to the &quot;Novgorod First Chronicle&quot; (NPL), the Novgorodians expelled his brother Alexander Nevsky from the city in the winter of 1240–1241, and asked their father Yaroslav II to send them another commander. Andrey was sent to the wayward republic in Alexander&#x27;s stead. In 1241, Andrey joined his Suzdalian forces with Alexander&#x27;s, and they jointly retook Pskov, raided the Estonian (Chud&#x27;) countryside, and saw action in the Battle on the Ice.

=== Grand prince of Vladimir ( 1248/9–1252) ===
Rus&#x27; chronicles preserve different versions of when and how Andrey became prince of Vladimir. In one version, when their father Yaroslav Vsevolodovich died in 1247, Andrey and Alexander went to Karakorum in Mongolia, where Andrey was appointed the next grand prince of Vladimir by &quot;jarlig&quot; of the great khan Güyük. On their return to Vladimir two years later (1249), they found that the capital had been seized by their young brother Mikhail Khorobrit. The latter, however, was killed in battle with Lithuanians several months later. Another version of events has Andrey seize the throne of Vladimir from his uncle Sviatoslav Vsevolodovich (who initially laterally succeeded their father in 1247) in 1248. A year later, his uncle Sviatoslav, offended by his ousting from Vladimir, went to the Horde to secure the throne for himself; how his trip ended is unknown, but he died in February 1253 without retrieving Vladimir.

In the winter of 1250–1251, some time after taking the throne of Vladimir, Andrey married Ustynia, a daughter of Danylo of Halych, who had submitted to Batu Khan in 1245 and was well-received in Sarai, but by 1251 appears to have attempted forming an anti-Mongol coalition. Aside from his marriage alliance with Andrey of Vladimir, the recently-widowed Danylo himself married the niece of Lithuanian king Mindaugas in the same year. However, when great khan Güyuk also died in 1251, and Andrey was expected to go back to Sarai and receive a renewal of his jarlig as grand prince of Vladimir from Batu in the name the new great khan Möngke, Andrey defiantly refused, even though his brother Alexander Nevsky complied. The Golden Horde interpreted his refusal as a challenge to Mongol authority, and Batu Khan&#x27;s son Sartak ordered a punitive expedition against Vladimir, while another punitive campaign was sent against Danylo of Halych–Volyn. Andrey was defeated in battle (near Pereslavl&#x27;) and fled via Novgorod to Sweden. With his brother Andrey exiled, Alexander Nevsky submitted to Möngke Khan, and as a reward for his loyalty to the Golden Horde, he received the throne of Vladimir from the Mongols (1252).

Modern scholars have interpreted these events described in the earliest sources as showing a rivalry between brothers Andrey and Alexander, with Andrey trying to form an anti-Mongol alliance with Danylo, while Alexander was happy to &#x27;collaborate with the Mongols against his own people.&#x27; The later hagiographic &quot;Life of Alexander Nevsky&quot; is almost completely silent on the relations of Andrey, Alexander and Yaroslav, limiting itself to a single sentence in which the Mongols launch a punitive expedition against Andrey, who escapes:
=== Prince of Suzdal ( 1255/6–1264) ===
In 1255, Andrey returned from exile and travelled to Sarai to ask pardon for his former infidelity. He received Suzdal. On his return to Vladimir, he received from Alexander the easternmost lands of Vladimir, including the towns of Nizhny Novgorod and Gorodets on the Volga. After Alexander died in 1263, Andrey aspired to add Vladimir to his possessions, but was thwarted in his designs by his younger brother Yaroslav of Tver.

==Family==
He married in 1250/51 to Ustynia, daughter of Daniel of Galicia and had issue:
* Vasily
** Konstantin
*** Dmitri of Suzdal. His descendant of 8th generation was Tsar Vasily IV of Russia.

<text>Andrey III Alexandrovich (ca. 1255 – 27 July 1304), a Rus’ prince, son of Alexander Nevsky, received from his father the town of Gorodets on the Volga. In 1276 he added Kostroma to his possessions and joined the struggle for the Grand Duchy of Vladimir-Suzdal.

In 1281, joining the Mongol army, Andrey expelled his elder brother Dmitri from Vladimir. After some feasting with Mongols in Vladimir, Andrey went to Novgorod, where the populace made him heartily welcome. Meanwhile, his brother allied himself with the powerful Mongol general Nogai Khan, who reinstated Dmitry as Grand Duke of Vladimir in 1283.

During the following decade, Andrey thrice brought the Mongols to Rus’ in order to wrest Vladimir from his brother. In the campaign of 1293 they pillaged 14 Russian towns, finally forcing Dmitry to abdicate. Even when elevated to the grand-ducal throne of Vladimir, Andrey continued to live in Gorodets. During the last decade of his reign he struggled with a league formed by Daniel of Moscow, Mikhail of Tver, and . In 1301 he drove the Swedes from Landskrona near present-day Saint Petersburg.

<doc id="769823" wikidata="Q50005" url="?curid=769823" title="Giulio Andreotti">
<text>Giulio Andreotti ( ; ; 14 January 1919 – 6 May 2013) was an Italian politician and who served as the 41st prime minister of Italy in seven governments (1972–1973, 1976–1979, and 1989–1992), and was leader of the Christian Democracy party and its right-wing; he was the sixth-longest-serving prime minister since the Italian unification and the second-longest-serving post-war prime minister. Andreotti is widely considered the most powerful and prominent politician of the First Republic.

Beginning as a protégé of Alcide De Gasperi, Andreotti achieved cabinet rank at a young age and occupied all the major offices of state over the course of a 40-year political career, being seen as a reassuring figure by the civil service, business community, and Vatican. Domestically, he contained inflation following the 1973 oil crisis, founded the National Healthcare Service (&quot;Sistema Sanitario Nazionale&quot;) and combated terrorism during the Years of Lead. In foreign policy, he guided Italy&#x27;s European Union integration and established closer relations with the Arab world. Admirers of Andreotti saw him as having mediated political and social contradictions, enabling the transformation of a substantially rural country into the world&#x27;s fifth-largest economy. Critics said he had done nothing to challenge a system of patronage that had led to pervasive corruption. Andreotti staunchly supported the Vatican and a capitalist structure, and opposed the Italian Communist Party. Following the popular Italian sentiment of the time, he supported the development of a strong European community playing host to neoliberal economics. He was not opposed to the implementation of the European Social Fund and the European Regional Development Fund in building the European economy.

At the height of his statesman career, Andreotti was subjected to criminal prosecutions and charged with colluding with &quot;Cosa Nostra&quot;. Courts managed to prove that he was undoubtedly linked with them until 1980; however, the case was closed due to past statutes of limitations. The most sensational allegation came from prosecutors in Perugia, who charged him with ordering the murder of a journalist. He was found guilty at a trial, which led to complaints that the justice system had &quot;gone mad&quot;. After being acquitted of all charges, in part due to statute-barred limitations, Andreotti remarked: &quot;Apart from the Punic Wars, for which I was too young, I have been blamed for everything that&#x27;s happened in Italy.&quot;

In addition to his prime ministerial posts, Andreotti served in numerous ministerial positions, among them as Minister of the Interior (1954 and 1978), Minister of Finance (1955–1958), Minister of Treasury (1958–1959), Minister of Defence (1959–1966 and 1974), Minister of Budget and Economic Planning (1974–1976), and Minister of Foreign Affairs (1983–1989), and was a senator for life from 1991 until his death in 2013. He was also a journalist and author. Andreotti was sometimes called &quot;Divo Giulio&quot; (from Latin &quot;Divus Iulius&quot;, &quot;Divine Julius&quot;, an epithet of Julius Caesar after his posthumous deification), or simply &quot;Il divo&quot;.

==Background and attributes==
Andreotti, the youngest of three children, was born on 14 January 1919 in Rome. His father, who died when Giulio was two, was a primary school teacher from Segni, a small town in Lazio; after a few years his sister Elena also died. Andreotti attended the Liceo Torquato Tasso in Rome and graduated in law at the University of Rome, with a mark of 110/110.

Andreotti showed some ferocity as a youth, once stubbing out a lit taper in the eye of another altar boy who was ridiculing him. His mother was described as not very affectionate. An aunt is said to have advised him to remember that few things in life are important and never to over-dramatise difficulties. As an adult, he was described as having a somewhat unusual demeanor for an Italian politician, being mild-mannered and unassuming. Andreotti did not use his influence to advance his children to prominence, despite being widely considered the most powerful person in the country for decades. &quot;See all, tolerate much, and correct one thing at a time&quot; was a quote that emphasised what has been called his &quot;art of the possible&quot; view of politics.

Andreotti was known for his discretion and retentive memory, and also a sense of humour, often placing things in perspective with a sardonic quip. Andreotti&#x27;s personal support within the Christian Democrats was limited, but he could see where the mutual advantage for apparently conflicting interests lay and put himself at the centre of events as mediator. Though not a physically imposing man, Andreotti navigated political waters through conversational skill.

==Early political career==

Andreotti did not shine at his school and started work in a tax office while studying law at the University of Rome. In this period he became a member of the Italian Catholic Federation of University Students (FUCI), the only non-fascist youth organization which was allowed by the regime of Benito Mussolini. Its members included many of the future leaders of Christian Democracy.

In 1938, while researching the papal navy in the Vatican library, he met Alcide De Gasperi, who had been given sanctuary by the Pope. De Gasperi asked Andreotti if he had nothing better to do with his time, inspiring him to become politically active. Speaking of De Gasperi, Andreotti said, &quot;He taught us to search for compromise, to mediate.&quot;

In July 1939, while Aldo Moro was president of FUCI, Andreotti became director of its magazine &quot;Azione Fucina&quot;. In 1942, when Moro was enrolled in the Italian Army, Andreotti succeeded him as president of FUCI, a position he held until 1944. During his early years Andreotti suffered violent migraines that forced him to make use of psychoactive drugs sporadically and opiates. During World War II, Andreotti wrote for the &quot;Rivista del Lavoro&quot;, a fascist propaganda publication, but was also a member of the then-clandestine newspaper &quot;Il Popolo&quot;.

In July 1943, Andreotti contributed, along with Mario Ferrari Aggradi, Paolo Emilio Taviani, Guido Gonella, Giuseppe Capogrossi, Ferruccio Pergolesi, Vittore Branca, Giorgio La Pira, Giuseppe Medici and Moro, to the creation of the Code of Camaldoli, a document planning of economic policy drawn up by members of the Italian Catholic forces. The Code served as inspiration and guideline for economic policy of the future Christian Democrats. In 1944, he became a member of the National Council of the newborn Christian Democracy party. After the end of the conflict, he became responsible for the party&#x27;s youth organisation.

===Chamber of Deputies and government===
In 1946, Andreotti was elected to the Constituent Assembly of Italy, the provisional parliament which had the task of writing the new Italian constitution. His election was supported by Alcide De Gasperi, founder of the modern DC, of whom Andreotti became a close assistant and advisor; the two politicians became close friends despite their very different characters. However, De Gasperi later described Andreotti as a man &quot;so capable in everything that he could become capable of anything&quot;. In 1948, he was elected to the newly formed Chamber of Deputies to represent the constituency of Rome–Viterbo–Latina–Frosinone, which remained his stronghold until the 1990s.

Andreotti began his government career in 1947 when he became Secretary of the Council of Ministers in the cabinet of his patron De Gasperi. The appointment was also supported by Giovanni Battista Montini, who later would become Pope Paul VI. During the office, Andreotti had wider-ranging responsibilities than many full ministers, which caused some envy. Andreotti&#x27;s main undertaking was representing the interests of Frosinone in the province of Lazio. Lazio would continue to serve as Andreotti&#x27;s geographical base of power later in his political career.

===Influence on culture ===
As the state undersecretary in charge of entertainment in 1949, Andreotti established import limits and screen quotas, and provided loans to Italian production firms. The measures aimed to prevent American productions from dominating the market against Neorealist films, a genre that exhibitors complained lacked stars and was held in low esteem by the public. As he phrased it, there were to be &#x27;Less rags, more legs&#x27;. Raunchy comedies and historical dramas with voluptuous toga-clad actresses became the staple of the Italian film industry. The screenplays were vetted to ensure that state funds were not used to prop up commercially unsustainable films, thereby creating a form of preproduction censorship. It was intended that Italian studios use part of their profits for high-quality films;

However, Vittorio De Sica&#x27;s &quot;Umberto D.&quot;, which depicted the lonely life of a retired man, could only strike government officials as a dangerous throwback, due to the opening scene featuring police breaking up a demonstration of old pensioners and the ending scene featuring Umberto&#x27;s aborted suicide attempt. In a public letter to De Sica, Andreotti castigated him for his &quot;wretched service to his fatherland&quot;.

===1950s and 1960s===
In 1952, ahead of local elections in the municipality of Rome, Andreotti gave proof of his diplomatic skills and gained credibility. Andreotti persuaded De Gasperi not to establish a political alliance with the neo-fascist Italian Social Movement, as Pope Pius XII asked, to prevent a Communist victory.

As Secretary, Andreotti contributed to the re-formation of the Italian Olympic Committee, which had been disbanded after the fall of the Fascist regime. In 1953, among other things, he promoted the so-called &quot;Andreotti&#x27;s veto&quot; against foreign football players in Italian Serie A.

After De Gasperi&#x27;s resignation and retirement in August 1953, Andreotti remained Secretary of the Council under the short-lived premiership of Giuseppe Pella.
In 1954, Andreotti became Minister of the Interior in the first government of Amintore Fanfani. From July 1956 to July 1958, he was appointed Finance Minister in the cabinets of Antonio Segni and Adone Zoli. In the same period, Andreotti started forming a &quot;corrente&quot; (unofficial political association, or a faction) within the Christian Democracy party, the largest party in Italy. His &quot;corrente&quot; was supported by the Roman Catholic right wing. It started its activity with a press campaign accusing Piero Piccioni, son of the deputy national secretary of the DC, Attilio Piccioni, of the murder of fashion model Wilma Montesi at Torvaianica. After the defeat of De Gasperi&#x27;s old followers in the DC National Council, Andreotti helped another newly formed &quot;corrente&quot;, the &quot;Dorotei&quot;, to oust Amintore Fanfani, who was the leader of the left wing of the party, as Prime Minister of Italy and National Secretary of the DC. On 20 November 1958 Andreotti, then Minister of Treasury, was appointed president of the organizing committee of the 1960 Summer Olympics to be held in Rome.

In the early 1960s Andreotti was Minister of Defence, and was widely considered the &quot;de facto&quot; leader of the right-wing Christian Democratic opposition to Fanfani and Moro&#x27;s strategy. In this period, the revelation that the secret service had compiled dossiers on virtually every public figure in the country resulted in the SIFAR affair. Andreotti ordered the destruction of the dossiers; but before the destruction, Andreotti provided the documents to Licio Gelli, the Venerable Master of the clandestine lodge Propaganda Due (P2).

Andreotti was also involved in the Piano Solo scandal, an envisaged plot for an Italian coup in 1964 requested by then-President of the Italian Republic Antonio Segni. It was prepared by the commander of the Carabinieri, Giovanni de Lorenzo, at the beginning of 1964 in close collaboration with the Italian secret service (SIFAR), CIA secret warfare expert Vernon Walters, William Harvey, then-chief of the CIA station in Rome, and Renzo Rocca, director of the Gladio units within the military secret service SID.

In 1968, Andreotti was appointed leader of the parliamentary group of Christian Democracy, a position he held until 1972.

==First term as prime minister==
In 1972, with Andreotti&#x27;s first term as prime minister began a period when he was often seen as the &quot;éminence grise&quot; of governments even when not premier. He remained in office in two consecutive centre-right cabinets in 1972 and 1973. His first cabinet failed in obtaining the confidence vote and he was forced to resign after only 9 days; this government has been the one with the shortest period of fullness of powers in the history of the Italian Republic.

A snap election was called for May 1972, and Christian Democracy, led by Andreotti&#x27;s ally Arnaldo Forlani, remained stable with around 38% of the votes, as did the Communist Party, with the same 27% as in 1968. Andreotti, supported by secretary Forlani, tried to continue his centrist strategy, but his attempt only lasted a year. The cabinet fell due to the withdrawal of the external support of the Italian Republican Party on the matter of local television reform.

===Social policies===
Andeotti&#x27;s approach owed little to a belief that market mechanisms could be left to work without interference. He used price controls on essential foodstuffs and various social reforms to reach an understanding of organised labour. A law of 11 August 1972 extended health insurance to citizens over 65 to receive a social pension. A law of 30 June 1973 extended the cost of living indexation to the social pension.

A devout Catholic, Andreotti was on close terms with six successive pontiffs. He occasionally gave the Vatican unsolicited advice and was often heeded. He updated the relationship of Roman Catholicism to the Italian state in an accord he presented to parliament. It put the country on a more secular basis: abolishing Roman Catholicism as the state religion, making religious instruction in public schools optional, and having the Church accept Italy&#x27;s divorce law in 1971. Andreotti opposed legal divorce and abortion, but despite his party&#x27;s opposition, he couldn&#x27;t avoid the legalization of abortion in May 1978.

===Foreign policy===
Andreotti was a strong NATO supporter and was invited to America by the U.S. President Richard Nixon in 1973. A year earlier, he paid an official visit to the Soviet Union, the first one by an Italian Prime Minister in over a decade. During his premiership, Italy opened and developed diplomatic and economic relationships with Arab countries of the Mediterranean Basin, and supported business and trade between Italy and the Soviet Union.

==Second term as prime minister==
After his resignation, Andreotti served as Minister of Defence in the government of Mariano Rumor and as Minister of Budget in the cabinets of Aldo Moro. In 1976, the Italian Socialist Party left the centre-left government of Moro. The ensuing general elections saw the growth of the Italian Communist Party (PCI), and the DC kept only a minimal advantage as the relative majority party in Italy, which was then suffering from an economic crisis and terrorism. After the success of his party, the Communist secretary Enrico Berlinguer approached DC&#x27;s left-leaning leaders, Moro and Fanfani, with a proposal to bring forward the so-called Historic Compromise, a political pact proposed by Moro which would see a government coalition between DC and PCI for the first time. Andreotti, known as a staunch anti-communist, was called in to lead the first experiment in that direction: his new cabinet, formed in July 1976, included only members of his own Christian Democratic party but had the indirect support of the communists.
Andreotti&#x27;s third cabinet was called &quot;the government of the &quot;not-no confidence&quot;, because it was externally supported by all the political parties in the Parliament, except for the neo-fascist Italian Social Movement.

===Legislative action===
On 28 January 1977, the Italian Parliament approved the Land Use Law, which introduced severe constraints on construction, such as new criteria for land expropriations and new planning procedures. On 27 July 1978, the Fair Rent Law completed state control of rents with general rules for rent levels and terms of leases. A law of 16 February 1977 introduced ad hoc upgrading of cash benefits for the agricultural sector. In November 1977, pension linkage to the industrial wage was extended to all other pension schemes not administered by INPS. A law of 16 February 1977 extended family allowances to part-time agricultural workers. A law of 5 August 1978 introduced a ten-year housing plan, with the state making funds available to regions for public housing and subsidies for private housing. As premier, Andeotti&#x27;s urging of fellow leaders in the European Community was influential in the creation of an EU Regional Development Fund, which the south of Italy was to greatly benefit from.

In 1977, Andreotti dealt with an economic crisis by criticising the luxury lifestyle of many Italians and pushing through tough austerity measures. This cabinet fell in January 1978. In March, the crisis was overcome by the intervention of Moro, who proposed a new cabinet, again formed only by DC politicians, but this time with positive confidence votes from the other parties, including the PCI. This cabinet was also chaired by Andreotti and was formed on 16 March 1978.

===Kidnapping of Aldo Moro===
On the morning of 16 March 1978, the day on which the new Andreotti cabinet was supposed to have undergone a confidence vote in Parliament, the car of Aldo Moro, then-president of Christian Democracy, was assaulted by a group of Red Brigades (Italian: &quot;Brigate Rosse&quot;, or BR) terrorists in Via Fani in Rome. Firing automatic weapons, the terrorists killed Moro&#x27;s bodyguards (two Carabinieri in Moro&#x27;s car and three policemen in the following car) and kidnapped him.

During the kidnapping of Moro, Andreotti refused any negotiation with the terrorists. Moro, during his imprisonment, wrote a statement expressing very harsh judgements against Andreotti.

On 9 May 1978, Moro&#x27;s body was found in the trunk of a Renault 4 in Via Caetani after 55 days of imprisonment, during which he was submitted to a political trial by the so-called &quot;people&#x27;s court&quot; set up by the Brigate Rosse and the Italian government was asked for an exchange of prisoners. After Moro&#x27;s death, Andreotti continued as Prime Minister of the &quot;National Solidarity&quot; government with the support of the PCI. Laws approved during his tenure included the Italian National Health Service reform. However, when the PCI asked to participate more directly in the government, Andreotti refused, and the government was dissolved in June 1979. Due also to conflict with Bettino Craxi, secretary of the Italian Socialist Party (PSI), the other main party in Italy at the time, Andreotti did not hold any further government position until 1983.

==Foreign Affairs Minister==
In 1983, Andreotti became Minister of Foreign Affairs in the first Cabinet of Bettino Craxi, despite the long-lasting personal antagonism between the two men which had occurred earlier on; Craxi was the first Socialist to become Prime Minister of Italy since Unification.

===Sigonella Crisis===
On 7 October 1985, four men representing the Palestine Liberation Front (PLF) hijacked the Italian MS &quot;Achille Lauro&quot; liner off the coast of Egypt, as she was sailing from Alexandria to Ashdod, Israel. The hijacking was organized by Muhammad Zaidan, leader of the PLF. One 69-year-old Jewish American man in a wheelchair, Leon Klinghoffer, was murdered by the hijackers and thrown overboard.

The Egyptian airliner carrying the hijackers was intercepted by F-14 Tomcats from the VF-74 &quot;BeDevilers&quot; and the VF-103 &quot;Sluggers&quot; of Carrier Air Wing 17, based on the aircraft carrier , and directed to land at Naval Air Station Sigonella (a NATO air base in Sicily) under the orders of U.S. Secretary of Defense Caspar Weinberger; there, the hijackers were arrested by the Italian Carabinieri after a disagreement between American and Italian authorities. Prime Minister Bettino Craxi claimed Italian territorial rights over the NATO base. Italian Air Force personnel and Carabinieri lined up facing the United States Navy SEALs which had arrived with two C-141s. Other Carabinieri were sent from Catania to reinforce the Italians. The US eventually allowed the hijackers to be taken into Italian custody, after receiving assurances that the hijackers would be tried for murder. The other passengers on the plane (including Zaidan) were allowed to continue on to their destination, despite protests by the United States. Egypt demanded an apology from the U.S. for forcing the airplane off course.

The escape of Muhammad Zaidan was the result of a deal made with Yassar Arafat.

===Policies===
As Minister Andreotti encouraged diplomacy between the United States and the Soviet Union and improving Italian links with Arab countries. In this respect he followed a line similar to that of Craxi, with whom he had an otherwise troubled political relationship. The Italian authorities had banned the &quot;Lion of the Desert&quot; war film about the Second Italo-Senussi War during the Italian colonization of Libya, because, in the words of Andreotti, it was &quot;damaging to the honor of the army&quot;.

On 14 April 1986, Andreotti revealed to Libyan Foreign Minister Abdel Rahman Shalgham that the United States would bomb Libya the next day in retaliation for the Berlin disco terrorist attack which had been linked to Libya. As a result of the warning from Italy – a supposed ally of the US – Libya was better prepared for the bombing. Nevertheless, on the following day, Libya fired two Scuds at the Italian island of Lampedusa in retaliation. However, the missiles passed over the island, landed in the sea and caused no damage. As Craxi&#x27;s relationship with the then-National Secretary of the DC, Ciriaco De Mita, was even worse, Andreotti was instrumental in the creation of the so-called &quot;CAF triangle&quot; (from the initials of the surnames of Craxi, Andreotti and another DC leader, Arnaldo Forlani) opposing De Mita&#x27;s power.

After Craxi&#x27;s resignation in 1987, Andreotti remained Minister of Foreign Affairs in the governments of Fanfani and De Mita. In 1989, when De Mita&#x27;s government fell, Andreotti was appointed as the new prime minister.

==Third term as prime minister==

On 22 July 1989, Andreotti was sworn in for the third time as prime minister. A turbulent course characterized his government; he decided to stay at the head of government, despite the abandonment of many social democratic ministers, after the approval of the norm on TV spots favorable to private TV channels of Silvio Berlusconi. This choice did not prevent the resurgence of old suspicions and resentments with Bettino Craxi, whose Italian Socialist Party withdrew from their coalition government in 1991. Andreotti would create a new government consisting of Christian Democrats, Socialists, Social Democrats, and Liberals.

In 1990, Andreotti revealed the existence of the Operation Gladio; Gladio was the codename for a clandestine North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) &quot;stay-behind&quot; operation in Italy during the Cold War. Its purpose was to prepare for and implement armed resistance in the event of a Warsaw Pact invasion and conquest. Although Gladio specifically refers to the Italian branch of the NATO stay-behind organizations, &quot;Operation Gladio&quot; is used as an informal name for all of them.

During his premiership, Andreotti clashed many times with President of the Republic Francesco Cossiga.

===European Union negotiations===
In 1990, Andreotti was involved in getting all parties to agree to a binding timetable for the Maastricht Treaty. The deep Economic and Monetary Union of the European Union favoured by Italy was opposed by Britain&#x27;s Margaret Thatcher, who wanted a system of competition between currencies. Germany had doubts about committing to the project without requiring economic reforms from Italy, which was seen as having various imbalances. As President of the European Council, Andreotti co-opted Germany by making admittance to the single market automatic once the criteria had been met and committing to a rigorous overhaul of Italian public finances. Critics later questioned Andreotti&#x27;s understanding of the obligation or whether he had ever intended to fulfil it.

===Resignation and decline===
In 1992, at the end of the legislature, Andreotti resigned from premiership; he was the last Christian Democratic Prime Minister of Italy. The previous year, Cossiga had appointed him Senator for Life. Andreotti was one of the most likely candidates to succeed Cossiga as President of the Republic in the 1992 presidential election.

Andreotti and the members of his &quot;corrente&quot; had adopted a strategy of launching his candidature only after effectively quenching all the others. Allegations against him thwarted the strategy; moreover, the election was influenced by the murder of the anti-mafia magistrate Giovanni Falcone in Palermo.

==Later political life==
===Tangentopoli===

In 1992, an investigation was started in Milan, dubbed &quot;Mani pulite&quot;. It uncovered endemic corruption practices at the highest levels, causing many spectacular (and sometimes controversial) arrests and resignations. After the disappointing result in the 1992 general election (29.7%) and two years of mounting scandals (which included several Mafia investigations which notably touched Andreotti), the Christian Democracy party was disbanded in 1994. In the 1990s, most of the politicians prosecuted were acquitted during those investigations, sometimes based on legal formalities or on statutory time limit rules.

===After Christian Democracy===
Christian Democracy suffered heavy defeats in the provincial and municipal elections, and polling suggested heavy losses in the 1994 Italian general election. In hopes of changing the party&#x27;s image, the DC&#x27;s last secretary, Mino Martinazzoli, decided to change the name of the party to the Italian People&#x27;s Party (PPI). Pier Ferdinando Casini, representing the centre-right faction of the party (previously led by Forlani), decided to launch a new party called Christian Democratic Centre and form an alliance with Silvio Berlusconi&#x27;s new party, Forza Italia. The left-wing faction either joined the Democratic Party of the Left or stayed within the new PPI, while some right-wingers joined National Alliance.
Andreotti joined the PPI of Mino Martinazzoli. In 2001, after the creation of The Daisy, Andreotti abandoned the People&#x27;s Party and joined the European Democracy, a minor Christian democratic political party in Italy, led by Sergio D&#x27;Antoni, former leader of the Italian Confederation of Workers&#x27; Trade Unions. Andreotti immediately became a prominent party member and was widely considered the &quot;de facto&quot; leader of the movement.

In the 2001 general election, the party scored 2.3% on a stand-alone list, winning only two seats in the Senate. In December 2002 it was merged with the Christian Democratic Centre and the United Christian Democrats to form the Union of Christian and Centre Democrats. Andreotti opposed this union and did not join the new party.

In 2006, Andreotti stood for the Presidency of the Italian Senate, obtaining 156 votes against the 165 of Franco Marini, former Labour Minister in the last Andreotti Cabinet. On 21 January 2008, he abstained from a vote in the Senate concerning Minister Massimo D&#x27;Alema&#x27;s report on foreign politics. The abstentions of another life senator, Sergio Pininfarina, and of two Communist senators caused the government to lose the vote. Consequently, Prime Minister Romano Prodi resigned. On previous occasions, Andreotti had always supported Prodi&#x27;s government with his vote.

During the 16th term of the Senate in 2008–2013, he opted to join the parliamentary group Union of the Centre – Independents of Pier Ferdinando Casini.

==Controversies==
===Trial for Mafia association===

Andreotti came under suspicion because his relatively small faction within the Christian Democrats included Sicilian Salvatore Lima. In Sicily, Lima cooperated with a Palermo-based Mafia, which operated below the surface of public life by controlling large numbers of votes to enable mutually beneficial relationships with local politicians. Andreotti said, &quot;But Lima never spoke to me about these things.&quot; By the 1980s, the old low-profile Mafia was overthrown by the Corleonesi, an extremely violent faction led by fugitive Salvatore Riina. Whereas old Mafia bosses had been cautious about violence, Riina&#x27;s targeting of anti-mafia officials proved ever more counter-productive. The 1982 murders of parliamentarian Pio La Torre and Carabinieri general Carlo Alberto Dalla Chiesa led to the Maxi Trial. Prosecutors, who could not be disciplined or removed except by their self-government board, the CSM, were given increased powers. After January 1992 upholding of the Maxi Trial verdicts as definitive convictions by the supreme court, Riina embarked on a renewed campaign which claimed the lives of the prosecuting magistrates, Giovanni Falcone and Paolo Borsellino, and their police guards. As Riina intended, the assassination of Falcone discredited Andreotti and prevented him from becoming Italy&#x27;s president. It also led to prosecutors being seen as an epitomising civic virtue. In January 1993, Riina was arrested in Palermo. In the aftermath of Riina&#x27;s capture, there were further Mafia bomb outrages that included terror attacks on art galleries and churches, which killed ten among the audience and led to a weakening of rules on the evidence which prosecutors could use to bring charges.

Labelled by Italian media as the &quot;trial of the century&quot;, legal action against Andreotti began on 27 March 1993 in Palermo. The prosecution accused the former prime minister of &quot;[making] available to the mafia association named Cosa Nostra for the defence of its interests and attainment of its criminal goals, the influence and power coming from his position as the leader of a political faction&quot;. Prosecutors said in return for electoral support of Lima and assassination of Andreotti&#x27;s enemies, he had agreed to protect the Mafia, which had expected him to fix the Maxi Trial. Andreotti&#x27;s defence was predicated on character attacks against the prosecution&#x27;s key witnesses, who were themselves involved with the mafia. This created a &quot;his word against theirs&quot; dynamic between a prominent politician and a handful of criminals. The defence said Andreotti had been a long-time politician of national stature, never beholden to Lima; and that far from providing protection, Andreotti had passed many tough anti-mafia laws when in government during the &#x27;80s. According to Andreotti&#x27;s lawyers, the prosecution case was based on conjecture and inference, without any concrete proof of direct involvement by Andreotti. The defence also contended the prosecution relied on the word of mafia turncoats whose evidence had been contradictory. One such informer testified that Riina and Andreotti had met and exchanged a &quot;kiss of honour&quot;. It emerged that the informer had received a US$300,000 &quot;bonus&quot; and committed a number of murders while in the witness protection programme. Andreotti dismissed the allegation against him as &quot;lies and slander ... the kiss of Riina, mafia summits ... scenes out of a comic horror film&quot;.

Andreotti was eventually acquitted on 23 October 1999; however, together with the greater series of corruption cases of Mani pulite, Andreotti&#x27;s trials marked the purging and renewal of Italy&#x27;s political system.

====Andreotti&#x27;s absolution and statute of limitations====
Andreotti was tried in Palermo for criminal association until 28 September 1982 and mafia association from 29 September 1982 onwards. While the first-degree sentence, issued on 23 October 1999, acquitted him because the fact did not exist on the basis of article 530, paragraph 2, of the Penal Code, the appeal sentence, issued on 2 May 2003, distinguishing between the facts up to 1980 and those that followed, established that Andreotti &quot;had committed&quot; the &quot;offence of participation in the criminal association&quot; (&quot;Cosa Nostra&quot;), &quot;concretely recognisable until the spring of 1980&quot;, an offence that was &quot;extinguished by statute of limitations&quot;. For facts subsequent to the spring of 1980, Andreotti was acquitted.

Both the prosecution and the defense appealed to the Court of Cassation, one against the acquittal, and the other to try to obtain an acquittal even on the facts until 1980, instead of a statute of limitations. On 15 October 2004, the Court of Cassation rejected both requests, confirming the statute of limitations for any offence until the spring of 1980 and acquittal for the rest. The grounds for the appeal judgment read (on page 211): &quot;Therefore the appealed sentence ... has recognized the participation in the associative crime not in the reductive terms of mere availability, but in the widest and juridically significant ones of a concrete collaboration.&quot; It quotes the opinion of the Court of Appeal and is immediately followed by another sentence of the Court of Cassation: &quot;The reconstruction of single episodes and the evaluation of their consequences were made per comments and interpretations that can also be not shared and against which other ones can be relied on.&quot; Suppose the final judgment had arrived by 20 December 2002 (limitation period). In that case, it could have resulted in one of the following two alternative outcomes:
* Andreotti could have been convicted based on article 416 of the Penal Code, i.e. the &quot;simple&quot; association, since the aggravated mafia-type association (416-bis of the Penal Code) was introduced in the Italian Penal Code only in 1982, thanks to the rapporteurs Virginio Rognoni (DC) and Pio La Torre. (PCI).
* The defendant could have been acquitted in full with the confirmation of the first instance judgment.

In 2010, the Court of Cassation ruled that Andreotti had slandered a judge who had given testimony by saying the self-governing body of prosecutors and judges should remove him from his position. Andreotti had said that leaving the man as a judge was &quot;like leaving a lighted fuse in the hand of a child&quot;.

===Trial for murder===
Contemporaneously with his trial for Mafia association, Andreotti was tried in Perugia with Sicilian Mafia boss Gaetano Badalamenti, Massimo Carminati, and others on charges of complicity in the murder of journalist Mino Pecorelli. The case was circumstantial and based on the word of Mafia turncoat Tommaso Buscetta, who had not originally mentioned the allegation about Andreotti when interviewed by Giovanni Falcone and had recanted it by the time of the trial.

Mino Pecorelli was killed in Rome&#x27;s Prati district with four gunshots, on 20 March 1979. The bullets used to kill him were &quot;Gevelot&quot; brand, a peculiarly rare type of bullet not easily found on gun markets, legal and clandestine alike. The same kind of bullet was later found in the &quot;Banda della Magliana&quot;″s weapon stock, concealed in the Health Ministry&#x27;s basement. Investigations targeted Massimo Carminati, member of the far-right organization &quot;Nuclei Armati Rivoluzionari&quot; (NAR) and of the &quot;Banda della Magliana&quot;, the head of Propaganda Due, Licio Gelli, Antonio Viezzer, Cristiano Fioravanti and Valerio Fioravanti.

On 6 April 1993, Mafia turncoat Tommaso Buscetta told Palermo prosecutors that he had learnt from his boss Gaetano Badalamenti that Pecorelli&#x27;s murder had been carried out in the interest of Andreotti. The Salvo cousins, two powerful Sicilian politicians with deep ties to local Mafia families, were also involved in the murder. Buscetta testified that Gaetano Badalamenti told him that the Salvo cousins had commissioned the murder as a favor to Andreotti. Andreotti was allegedly afraid that Pecorelli was about to publish information that could have destroyed his political career. Among the information was the complete memorial of Aldo Moro, which would be published only in 1990 and which Pecorelli had shown to General Carlo Alberto Dalla Chiesa before his death. Dalla Chiesa was also assassinated by Mafia in September 1982.

Andreotti was acquitted along with his co-defendants in 1999. Local prosecutors successfully appealed the acquittal, and there was a retrial, which in 2002 convicted Andreotti and sentenced him to 24 years imprisonment. Italians of all political allegiances denounced the conviction. Many failed to understand how the court could convict Andreotti of orchestrating the killing, yet acquit his co-accused, who supposedly had carried out his orders by setting up and committing the murder. The Italian supreme court definitively acquitted Andreotti of the murder in 2003.

==Personal life==
On 16 April 1945, Andreotti married Livia Danese (1 June 1921 – 29 July 2015) and had two sons and two daughters, Lamberto (born 6 July 1950), Marilena, Stefano and Serena.

==Death and legacy==
Andreotti said the opinion of others was of little consequence to him, and &quot;In any case, a few years from now, no one will remember me.&quot; He died in Rome on 6 May 2013 after suffering from respiratory problems, at the age of 94. The BBC described him as &quot;one of the most prominent political figures of post-war Italy&quot;. &quot;The New York Times&quot; noted he had &quot;a résumé of signal accomplishments and checkered failings that reads like a history of the republic&quot;. The Mayor of Rome, Gianni Alemanno, announced the death, stating that Andreotti was &quot;the most representative politician&quot; Italy had known in its recent history.

===Conspiracy theories===
Andreotti was accused of participation in a variety of plots. He was alleged to be the &quot;éminence grise&quot; behind the Propaganda Due Masonic Lodge, a secret association of politicians, civil servants, industrialists, military leaders, heads of the secret service, and prominent journalists conspiring to prevent the Italian Communist Party taking office. This theory posited control of elements ranging from the neo-fascist Valerio Fioravanti to Rome gangsters the Banda della Magliana and to Operation Gladio, a clandestine NATO organisation that was intended to fight a Soviet conquest of Europe through an armed resistance movement.

Andreotti was also accused of having a hand in the death of Aldo Moro and terrorist massacres in a strategy of tension aimed at precipitating a coup, as well as banking scandals and various high-profile assassinations.

====Related perceptions of Andreotti====

Fictional characters have been influenced by his image as a Machiavellian. A retort that Andreotti made in reply to an inquiry if being in power was wearing him out, &quot;Power wears out those who don&#x27;t have it&quot;, was used in the film &quot;The Godfather Part III&quot;, where a powerful Mafia-linked politician is shown laughing at the comment just before his assassination. He was nicknamed &quot;Belzebù&quot; (Beelzebub) or &quot;The Devil himself&quot; by Bettino Craxi, a political opponent who later fled Italy while sought on corruption charges. Other disparaging nicknames included &quot;The Black Pope&quot; and &quot;The Hunchback&quot; (he had a malformed spine). Although relatively tall for an Italian of his generation, cartoonists sometimes portrayed Andreotti as a hunchback dwarf lurking in the background.

A joke about Andreotti (originally seen in a strip by Stefano Disegni and Massimo Caviglia) had him receiving a phone call from a fellow party member, who pleaded with him to attend judge Giovanni Falcone&#x27;s funeral. His friend supposedly begged, &quot;The State must give an answer to the Mafia, and you are one of the top authorities in it!&quot; To which a puzzled Andreotti asked, &quot;Which one do you mean?&quot;

In 2008, Andreotti became the subject of Paolo Sorrentino&#x27;s film &quot;Il Divo&quot;, which portrayed him as a glib, unsympathetic figure, in whose orbit people tended to meet untimely and unnatural deaths. He reportedly lost his temper when he first saw the film but later joked, &quot;I&#x27;m happy for the producer. And I&#x27;d be even happier if I had a share of the takings.&quot;

Andreotti was depicted in the 2020 film &quot;Rose Island&quot;, which tells the story of the Republic of Rose Island, played by Marco Sincini.

<doc id="769830" wikidata="Q6219044" url="?curid=769830" title="John Andrew (priest, born 1931)">
<text>John Gerald Barton Andrew, OBE (10 January 1931 – 17 October 2014) was a British Anglican priest. From 1972 to 1996, he was the Rector of St. Thomas&#x27; Church on New York&#x27;s Fifth Avenue.

==Early life==
Andrew was born on 10 January 1931 in Scarborough, Yorkshire, England. As a boy, he was a chorister at St Peters Church, Anlaby. He was educated at Beverley Grammar School, an all-boys school in Beverley, Yorkshire.

Having served in the Royal Air Force for 18 months as part of National Service, he was awarded a scholarship to the University of Oxford. He studied theology at Keble College, Oxford. He entered Cuddesdon College, an Anglican theological college in the Catholic tradition, in 1954 to train for ordination to the priesthood. He graduated from Keble College with a Bachelor of Arts (BA) degree in 1955; as per tradition, this was promoted to a Master of Arts (MA Oxon) degree in 1958. He then completed a further year of study at Cuddesdon before his ordination.

==Military service==
On 9 March 1950, having completed officer training, Andrew was commissioned into the Secretarial Branch of the Royal Air Force as a pilot officer (national service). On 18 September 1951, after 18 months with the RAF, he was transferred to the reserve (national Service list) thereby ending his full-time service. He was promoted to flying officer on 4 June 1952. On 27 May 1956, he relinquished his commission and therefore ended his call-up liability.

==Ordained ministry==
In 1956, Andrew was ordained in the Church of England as a deacon by Michael Ramsey, then the Archbishop of York, at York Minster. He was ordained as a priest in 1957. From 1956 to 1959, he served his curacy at St Peter&#x27;s Church, Redcar. In 1959, he moved to the United States for the first time and was curate at St. George&#x27;s-by-the-River, Rumson, New Jersey for approximately 18 months.

In October 1960, Andrew returned to England and was appointed chaplain to Michael Ramsey, then the Archbishop of York. From 1961 to 1969, he continued to serve as chaplain to Ramsey, now the Archbishop of Canterbury. His time as chaplain to Ramsey was controversial given his unusually young age (he was 30 when Ramsey became Archbishop of Canterbury) and because he had only ever been a curate (a junior parish priest). He was promoted to Senior Chaplain in 1965.

Andrew then moved back into parish ministry and from 1969 to 1972 served as Vicar of Church of St John the Evangelist, Preston, Lancashire. This appointment did not suit him; it was much less prestigious than that of chaplain to an archbishop and could be seen as a demotion. From 1970 to 1972, he was additionally Rural Dean of Preston, giving him a supervising role over 39 other priests. After three years, he sought a more prestigious appointment and made use of the influential contacts he had gained during his time as archbishop&#x27;s chaplain.

In March 1972, the vestry of St Thomas&#x27; Church, New York City, United States, choose Andrew as their next rector. He had been recommended by a group of wealthy American women who formed part of the influential network he had built up. On 3 December 1972, he was instituted as the 11th Rector by Paul Moore, Jr., the Bishop of New York. His first act was to change the main Sunday service from Morning Prayer to a Eucharist and he extended this to daily Mass throughout the year. He also introduced incense to services, icons and Reservation of the Blessed Sacrament. There were attempts to lure him back to England with the offer of the appointment of Vicar of Tewkesbury Abbey, but he turned it down. On 29 January 1995, he was made an honorary canon of the Cathedral of St John the Divine, New York, by Richard F. Grein, Bishop of New York.

Andrew retired in 1996 and returned for a time to England. He later returned to New York and was appointed Rector Emeritus of St Thomas&#x27; Church in 1999.

==Later life==
On 15 October 2014, Andrew was having dinner with John O&#x27;Hara, the newly appointed Roman Catholic Auxiliary Bishop of New York, when he had a heart attack. He was taken to the New York Presbyterian Hospital but died on 17 October. His funeral was held at St. Thomas&#x27; Church, New York, on 5 November.

==Honours==
In the 1996 New Year Honours, Andrew was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) &#x27;for charitable and community services in New York&#x27;. In May 1996, he was awarded the Cross of St Augustine, the second highest honour for service to Anglicanism, by George Carey, the then Archbishop of Canterbury.

He was awarded a number of honorary Doctor of Divinity (DD) degrees. In 1976, he was awarded DDs by Cuttington University, Liberia, and by the Episcopal Theological Seminary, Kentucky, US. In 1977, he was awarded a DD by Nashotah House Theological Seminary, Wisconsin, US. In 1996, he was awarded a DD by the General Theological Seminary, New York, US.

<text>John Albion Andrew (May 31, 1818 – October 30, 1867) was an American lawyer and politician from Massachusetts. He was elected in 1860 as the 25th Governor of Massachusetts, serving between 1861 and 1866, and led the state&#x27;s contributions to the Union cause during the American Civil War (1861–1865). He was a guiding force behind the creation of some of the first African-American units in the United States Army, including the 54th Massachusetts Infantry. He belonged to the Whig, Free Soil, and Republican parties during his career.

Educated at Bowdoin College, Andrew was a radical abolitionist of slavery from an early age, engaged in the legal defense of fugitive slaves against owners seeking their return. He provided legal support to John Brown after his 1859 raid on Harpers Ferry, Virginia, raising his profile and propelling him to the Massachusetts governor&#x27;s chair. Andrew was a persistent voice criticizing President Abraham Lincoln&#x27;s conduct of the war, and pressing him to end slavery. By the end of the war, his politics had moderated, and he came to support the Reconstruction policies of Lincoln&#x27;s successor, Andrew Johnson.

In Massachusetts, Andrew opposed the Know Nothing movement of the 1850s and the state&#x27;s strict alcohol prohibition laws, and oversaw the state takeover of the Hoosac Tunnel construction project. In 1865, he signed legislation establishing the Massachusetts State Police, the first statewide police force of its type in the nation. He died early of apoplexy at the age of 49.

==Early life and career==
Andrew was born in Windham (in modern-day Maine, then a part of Massachusetts) on May 31, 1818, the eldest of four children. His father, Jonathan Andrew, was descended from an early settler of Boxford, Massachusetts, and ran a small but prosperous merchant business in Windham. His mother, Nancy Green Pierce, was a teacher at Fryeburg Academy. Andrew&#x27;s 5th great grandfather was an immigrant from England named George Andrew who settled in Boxford, Massachusetts, in 1637. His 4th great grandfather was born in Boxford, Massachusetts, in 1638, being his first American-born ancestor.

Andrew received his primary education first at home, and then at several area boarding schools. After his mother&#x27;s death in 1832, he attended Gorham Academy in nearby Gorham. During his youth he exhibited talent for both memory and public speaking, memorizing church sermons and recounting them with the same oratorical style in which they were delivered. While a teenager, he was exposed to the early abolitionist writings of William Lloyd Garrison and others. He entered Bowdoin College in 1833. Although he was studious and popular with other students, he did not shine academically and was ranked near the bottom in his class.

After his graduation in 1837, Andrew moved to Boston to study law under Henry H. Fuller, with whom he became close friends. He was admitted to the Massachusetts bar in 1840, and began the practice of law.

==Antislavery legal and political advocate==
After his admission to the bar, Andrew joined the Whig Party and became actively involved in the anti-slavery movement. As a Conscience Whig, he opposed the election of &quot;Cotton Whig&quot; Robert Charles Winthrop in the 1846 election for Congress, promoting Charles Sumner (over the latter&#x27;s objection) as an independent candidate. He sat on the executive committee of Boston&#x27;s first vigilance committee, an anti-slavery organization established in 1846 that was devoted to assisting escaped slaves. Andrew participated in the establishment in 1848 of the Free Soil Party, whose principal political goal was ending the expansion of slavery into western territories. The Free Soilers nominated Martin Van Buren for president; he placed third in the election, but the party was somewhat more successful at the state level, gaining seats in the state legislature and Congress.

In 1847, Andrew, then 29 and with his law practice underway, met Eliza Jane Hersey of Hingham at an anti-slavery fair. They were engaged that year and married on Christmas evening in 1848. They had four children: John Forrester (1850), Elizabeth Loring (1852), Edith (1854), and Henry Hersey (1858).

The Boston Vigilance Committee attracted many new members following congressional passage of the federal Fugitive Slave Act of 1850, which required law enforcement officials and citizens of free states as well as slave states to aid in the recovery of fugitive slaves. Andrew sat on a subcommittee that handled the legal defense of individuals accused of being fugitive slaves. He was also a regular attendee at meetings of the &quot;Bird Club&quot;, a political group organized by businessman Francis Bird. Its members were mainly anti-slavery ex-Whigs, described by Samuel Gridley Howe as &quot;straight &amp; impractical republicans&quot;. Bird Club members would dominate the state&#x27;s political establishment into the 1870s. Andrew&#x27;s political activity was otherwise minimal, as he was devoted to his growing law practice and family, which was settled in Hingham. By 1855, his practice was sufficiently successful that he also purchased a house on Charles Street in Boston.
In 1854, Andrew became personally involved in the highly publicized fugitive slave case of Anthony Burns, defending one of the men who was arrested for trying to rescue Burns from the ship on which he was being held. Anger over that year&#x27;s passage of the Kansas-Nebraska Act (which overturned the limitation of slavery&#x27;s expansion under the Missouri Compromise of 1820) revitalized the Free Soil movement. He once defended a poor mixed race man on a murder charge at the Norfolk County Courthouse, &quot;pro bono.&quot;

Andrew was elected chair of a committee to manage a nominating convention for the 1854 elections. This meeting resulted in the first organization of the Republican Party in Massachusetts. Its slate was undermined by Henry Wilson&#x27;s defection to the Know Nothing movement, which swept the state&#x27;s elected offices that year. The Republicans reorganized in 1855, but Andrew was not involved in the party processes that resulted in the eventual election of Nathaniel Prentice Banks as the first Republican governor in 1857. He continued legal activity on behalf of anti-slavery interests.

In 1857, Andrew won election as a representative in the Massachusetts General Court, as part of a complete Republican takeover of the Massachusetts government. He was quickly promoted as a leading abolitionist voice, filling a void left after Sumner was severely injured in an attack in Congress. Andrew led the debate in favor of removing Judge Edward Loring from office over his actions in the Burns case, and in opposition to the proposed repeal of the state&#x27;s stringent anti-slavery personal liberty law. Although he did not run for reelection, Andrew gained popularity as his actions became known in the state Republican party. He was selected to chair the 1858 state Republican convention. In anticipation of gaining a higher elected office, Andrew refused Governor Banks&#x27; offer of a seat on the Superior Court bench in 1859.

Following John Brown&#x27;s 1859 raid on Harpers Ferry, Virginia, Andrew helped organize legal aid for Brown. He expressed sympathy with Brown&#x27;s position, if not his deeds. Andrew&#x27;s efforts on behalf of Brown brought him statewide notice, and also drew the attention of Southern interests in the United States Senate. They were seeking evidence to tie Northern interests to the funding and arming of Brown&#x27;s force, and Andrew was summoned to testify to his connections with Brown. Andrew led efforts to raise money to help Brown&#x27;s family.

Andrew&#x27;s actions on behalf of Brown and his family were highly popular in Massachusetts. The Massachusetts Republican Committee published his speeches and testimony on Brown&#x27;s behalf in a pamphlet to distribute to voters.

Andrew&#x27;s popularity made him the choice to head the Massachusetts delegation to the 1860 Republican National Convention. He was nominated for governor at the state convention that year, despite an attempt by the more moderate Governor Banks to secure the nomination for Henry L. Dawes. Banks sought to put off the announcement of his retirement until the last possible moment, but state Republican chairman William Claflin leaked the news to Andrew supporters. Andrew won the nomination by a wide margin, and defeated Constitutional Union Party candidate Amos A. Lawrence in the general election.

==War Governor of Massachusetts==

When Andrew took office on January 2, 1861, on the eve of the American Civil War, the &quot;Albany Argus&quot; called him &quot;a lawyer of a low type and a brutal fanatic&quot; who &quot;proposes to maintain the condemned [personal liberty] statutes of [Massachusetts], and to force upon the South by arms, an allegiance to the Constitution thus violated.&quot; In the early war years that followed, Andrew was a persistent radical voice, pressuring President Abraham Lincoln on the conduct of the war and the need to end slavery.

Shortly after taking office, Andrew began to ready the Massachusetts militia for duty, promoting younger and more vigorous leaders, and contracting for updated armaments, equipment, and supplies. He also wrote to the governors of Maine and New Hampshire, urging them to also step up preparations. Once hostilities broke out, he also took the lead to update the state&#x27;s coastal defenses, which were in poor condition and largely obsolete. Taking this step without federal authorization or funding, he secured bank loans from major Boston banks to fund the effort in the interim. With the war already underway in late 1861, Andrew engaged in a highly public dispute with General Benjamin Franklin Butler, who sought to appoint officers of regiments he recruited. Andrew ended up winning in the disagreement, and (in a response viewed at the time as somewhat petulant) refused to appoint any of Butler&#x27;s choices to those positions.
Andrew was a regular voice, although somewhat muted in public statements, in the drive to declare an end to slavery. When Lincoln announced his preliminary Emancipation Proclamation in September 1862 (shortly after the Union victory in the Battle of Antietam), Andrew was supportive, but called it &quot;a poor &quot;document&quot; but a mighty &quot;act&quot;&quot;, and complained that it was too limited in scope and late in becoming effective. Andrew was one of the leading state executives at the Loyal War Governors&#x27; Conference in Altoona, Pennsylvania, held in late September 1862, which ultimately backed the Emancipation Proclamation and the continued war effort.

Andrew was a leading force in promoting the enlistment of black men as uniformed soldiers in the Union Army, although the state legislature was at first reluctant to authorize it. Abolitionist Frederick Douglass had advocated this from the start of the war, and Andrew viewed it as a necessary equalizing step, and a means to fill the state&#x27;s enlistment quotas with something other than factory workers. After lobbying the administration, Andrew was granted permission to raise a black regiment in January 1863. Due to Massachusetts&#x27;s small black population, the 54th (and then also the 55th) Massachusetts were composed of blacks recruited not just from Massachusetts, but also Ohio, New York, Pennsylvania, and other states. Andrew wanted the regiments to be staffed by black officers, but this was rejected, and their officers were instead hand-picked by Andrew from strong abolitionist circles. He was also supportive of efforts by the recruits to receive equal pay; he offered them money from the state to do so, but they refused, holding out for equal pay from the federal government. He was somewhat less receptive to the relocation of freed slaves to Massachusetts, objecting to a plan to send 500 of them to Massachusetts from South Carolina in 1862.

By the end of the war, Andrew&#x27;s politics had moderated. In late 1865, he expressed support for the Reconstruction policies of President Andrew Johnson, resulting in a split with his longtime political ally Charles Sumner. The party split was such that Andrew was considered as a potential candidate for Sumner&#x27;s Senate seat, but he rejected the possibility. With the war at an end in 1865, he decided not to run for reelection. In his final speech to the state legislature in January 1866 he outlined his vision of how Reconstruction should proceed, significantly diverging from the Radical agenda by not making black suffrage a prerequisite for the readmission of rebel state legislators to Congress. He had in part acted on private efforts to aid in the reconstruction of the south in 1865, forming a land agency as a clearing house for Northerners seeking to invest in the southern properties.

Andrew was elected a 3rd Class Companion (honorary member) of the Pennsylvania Commandery of the Military Order of the Loyal Legion of the United States in recognition of his support of the Union during the Civil War.

===Domestic Massachusetts issues===

Andrew was elected with support from a large and primarily populist base. He was not part of Boston&#x27;s relatively conservative aristocracy, whose support he needed to govern, especially in managing the war effort. Many of his military advisors and aides were drawn from Boston&#x27;s elites, which caused some discontent among his populist supporters.

Construction of the Hoosac Tunnel was a significant issue within the state during Andrew&#x27;s tenure. The state had loaned its builder, the Troy and Greenfield Railroad, $2 million in the 1850s to support the construction. In 1861, both outgoing Governor Banks, and Andrew, after he took office, refused to sign a bill authorizing additional funding to the financially troubled project. Andrew lacked confidence in Herman Haupt, the tunnel&#x27;s chief engineer, and withdrew the state engineer overseeing the project. These actions cost Andrew votes in the 1861 election in the towns on the railroad route, but not enough to cost him the election. The state took over the tunnel project in 1862, and it was finally completed at great expense in 1875.

Andrew also had to contend with ongoing political activities of the nativist Know Nothings, some of whom were now in the Republican fold. The state had in 1859 enacted a constitutional amendment requiring newly naturalized citizens to wait two years before they could vote. This amendment was repealed in 1862–1863 (by a process requiring votes of consecutive legislatures and a referendum). Andrew also deliberately snubbed the sentiments of the anti-Catholic Know Nothings by signing the charter for the College of the Holy Cross, a Catholic college in Worcester, and subsequently attending its first commencement exercises. In support of the war effort, he rescinded a ban, enacted by the Know Nothing Governor Henry J. Gardner, against the formation of militia companies composed of immigrants. This made possible the formation of state units populated mainly by German and Irish immigrants. On July 14, 1863, in response to a draft riot that broke out among Irish Catholics in the North End of Boston, Andrew ordered six companies and additional regular troops to protect Union armories in the neighborhood from attempts by the rioters to raid them.

Reform elements within the Republican establishment pressed Andrew for enforcement of the state&#x27;s alcohol prohibition law, which had been passed in 1855, and which had been poorly enforced, particularly in Boston. In response, legislation was enacted in 1865 and signed by Andrew creating a statewide constabulary, now the Massachusetts State Police; it was the first police force of its kind in the nation. Andrew was not a supporter of prohibition, and did little to enforce the law; his fondness of alcohol was well known.

==Post-war career==
Andrew resumed the practice of law after leaving office, although he intended to remain active in politics. He sought the chairmanship of the state Republican Party, competing against Radicals. When President Johnson engaged in political attacks against Charles Sumner in 1866, charging him with treason, Andrew decided to withdraw from the contest.

Among Andrew&#x27;s clients in 1867 were a group of businessmen who sought a loosening of the state&#x27;s strict alcohol prohibition law. Even though Andrew had laxly enforced the law while governor, his successor Alexander Bullock was a strict prohibitionist, and his enforcement of the law was the strictest the state had yet seen. Andrew represented the businessmen in extensive hearings (lasting six weeks) before a legislative committee considering the issue. His promotion of the cause was seized on by Democrats in the 1867 gubernatorial campaign, in which Andrew&#x27;s chief of staff John Quincy Adams II was running as a Democrat against Bullock.

Governor Andrew died on October 30, 1867, of apoplexy after having tea at his home in Boston. He was at first buried at Mount Auburn Cemetery in Cambridge, but his remains were moved in 1875 to the Hingham (Old Ship) Cemetery in Hingham. His grave is marked by a full-size statue, mounted on a pedestal.

<text>Jean de Béthencourt (; 1362–1425) was a French explorer who in 1402 led an expedition to the Canary Islands, landing first on the north side of Lanzarote. From there he conquered for Castile the islands of Fuerteventura (1405) and El Hierro, ousting their local chieftains (&quot;majos&quot; and &quot;bimbaches&quot;, ancient peoples). Béthencourt received the title Lord of the Canary Islands (&quot;Señor&quot;), named himself King of the Canary Islands, but recognized King Henry III of Castile, who had provided aid during the conquest, as his overlord.

==Background==

The Canary Islands were apparently known to the Carthaginians of Cadiz. The Roman writer Pliny the Elder called them &quot;the Fortunate Islands&quot;. Genoese navigator Lancelotto Malocello is credited with the rediscovery of the Canary Islands in 1312. In 1339, Majorcan Angelino Dulcert drew the first map of the Canaries, labeling one of the islands &quot;Lanzarote&quot;.

==Life==
Jean de Béthencourt, Baron of Saint-Martin-le-Gaillard, was born in Grainville-la-Teinturière, province of Normandy, the son of Jean III Béthencourt and Marie de Bracquemont. During his conflicts with the king of Navarre, King Charles V ordered demolished all fortresses of the region belonging to supporters of Navarre, or those whose owners were unable to ensure their defense. Béthencourt&#x27;s father was killed in May 1364 at the Battle of Cocherel, serving under Bertrand du Guesclin, and Jean was still a minor. Grainville was demolished in 1365. In 1377, the fifteen-year-old Béthencourt entered the service of Louis I, Duke of Anjou, reaching the position of squire. Between 1387 and 1391 he held the honorary post of chancellor of Louis de Valois and Duke of Touraine (later Duke of Orleans). In 1387, King Charles VI of France gave permission to rebuild the castle in Grainville.

As lord of Grainville, Béthencourt held seven parishes and rights over all the goods that crossed his land. He held Grainville as a vassal of the Count of Longueville, Olivier Du Guesclin, son of Bertrand du Guesclin. He later held it under Henry V of England who had taken control as a result of his expeditions in France. Around this time, taking advantage of the instability of relations between England and France, it is likely that Béthencourt engaged in piracy against both sides. In 1392, he married in Paris Jeanne de Fayel, the daughter of Guillaume de Fayel and Marguerite de Chatillon.

==Siege of Mahdia== 
In 1390 he accompanied the Duke of Touraine on the Barbary Crusade, an expedition organized by Genoese merchants to address North African piracy. The proposal by the doge was presented as a crusade. As such it would give prestige to its participants, a moratorium on their debts, immunity from lawsuits, and papal indulgence. The French force, consisting of 1,500 knights under the leadership of Louis II, Duke of Bourbon, lay siege to Mahdia in Tunis.

The French were unfamiliar with the terrain, lacked heavy siege equipment, underestimated, and became embroiled in internal quarrels. The Berbers realized that they could not overcome the heavier armed invaders. Tired of the oppressive heat and concerned about the upcoming winter, the French agreed to a treaty negotiated by the Genoese.

It is likely that Béthencourt heard stories regarding the Canary Islands from the Genoese, and of the presence of orchil, a lichen used to make a rare and expensive dye. Here too, he again met up with Gadifer de la Salle, whom he had known previously during service under the Duke of Orleans, and who would accompany him to the Canaries.

==Expedition to the Canary Islands==

At that time the Canary Islands were mainly frequented by Spanish merchants. To finance his expedition he sold his house in Paris valued at 200 gold francs and some other small pieces of property in December 1401. His cousin, Robert de Bracquemont, French ambassador to Castile, loaned him 7,000 pounds against a mortgage of Bethencourt&#x27;s estate. According to Moreri, King Henry III of Castile entrusted the conquest of the Canaries to Braquemont who gave the commission to Béthencourt.
Béthencourt set sail from La Rochelle on 1 May 1402 with eighty men, mostly Gascon and Norman adventurers, including two Franciscan priests (Pierre Bontier and Jean le Verrier who narrated the expedition in &quot;Le Canarien&quot;), two Guanches who had been captured in an earlier Castilian expedition and were already baptised, and Jean Arriete Prud&#x27;homme who would assist in the conquest as a key adviser and administrator.

After passing Cape Finisterre, they put into Cadiz, where he found some of his sailors so frightened that they refused to continue the voyage. Of the eighty crew with which he set out, Béthencourt sailed with fifty-three. He arrived at Lanzarote, the northernmost inhabited island. While Gadifer de la Salle explored the archipelago, Béthencourt left for Cádiz, where he acquired reinforcements at the Castilian court, and was recognized as Lord of the Canary Islands, as a vassal of the King of Castile. 

At this time a power struggle had broken out on the island between Gadifer and Berthin de Berneval, another officer. Berthin spread dissention between the Normans of Béthencourt and the Gascons of Gadifer. Local leaders were drawn into the conflict and scores had died in the first months of Béthencourt&#x27;s absence. During this time, Gadifer had managed to conquer Fuerteventura and to explore other islands. It was only with the return of Béthencourt in 1404 that peace was restored to the troubled island. De la Salle and Béthencourt founded the city of Betancuria (as capital of the island of Fuerteventura) in 1404.
A power struggle broke out between the two men, and his lieutenant De la Salle was forced to return to France.

Bethencourt also conquered El Hierro and claimed La Gomera without conquering it.
In October 1405, Bethencourt landed on the island of Gran Canaria (&quot;canarios&quot;), but was defeated by the aboriginals in the battle of Arguineguin in the south of the island and retreated.

Probably in December 1405, Bethencourt sailed back to France, and entrusted his nephew Mateo or Maciot de Béthencourt with the government. He never returned to the Canary Islands, because of the flare-up of the Hundred Years&#x27; War in Normandy and financial problems. Other sources put the final return of de Béthencourt to Europe in 1412.

In 1418, he agreed that Maciot de Béthencourt sold the Lordship of the Canary Islands to the Spanish nobleman Enrique Pérez de Guzmán, 2nd Count of Niebla on his behalf. Maciot de Béthencourt remained administrator of the islands.

He died in 1425 and was buried in the church of Grainville-la-Teinturière.

Some of his distant family had great power and fortune in the islands. Including &quot;Ginés de Cabrera Béthencourt&quot;, famous for building the Casa de Los Coroneles (House Of The Colonels) in the municipal area that would nowadays be known as La Oliva.

==Béthencourt surname==
To this day, Betancourt and other forms of his surname are quite frequent among Canary Islanders and people of Canary Islander descent, in spite of his death without issue, thanks to the practice of baptising the natives with his surname and to the offspring of his nephew Maciot de Béthencourt who succeeded him as king of the islands.

<doc id="769836" wikidata="Q7410769" url="?curid=769836" title="Samuel Andrew">
<text>Samuel Andrew (29 January 1656 – 24 January 1738) was an American Congregational clergyman and educator.

==Early life==
Samuel was born in Cambridge, Massachusetts, the eldest child of Samuel and Elizabeth (née White) Andrew. The elder Samuel was a merchant and shipmaster and the master builder of the first Harvard Hall. Elizabeth&#x27;s step-father, a wealthy Salem merchant named George Curwin, paid for the younger Samuel&#x27;s education.

He graduated from Harvard College in 1675 and received a master&#x27;s degree in 1678. He then became a tutor at the college until 1684. He was elected a Fellow of the college in 1679. His students at Harvard included multiple co-founders of Yale (see below) and future Harvard president John Leverett.

==Minister in Milford==

Reverend Andrew was ordained minister at Milford, Connecticut on 18 November 1685, and served there for the rest of his life. When he arrived in Milford, the congregation was divided over doctrinal issues. The combination of the departure of some dissenters in the 1690s and Reverend Andrew&#x27;s skills as a minister led to a revival that lasted until his death.

He was one of the ministers who assembled at Saybrook in 1708 by order of the General Court for the purpose of adopting and recommending to the churches a manual of church discipline called the &quot;Saybrook Platform&quot;.

==Yale University==

He was one of the ten ministers who were the founding trustees of the Collegiate School in 1701. According to Yale President Thomas Clapp, writing in 1766, Reverend Andrew and his former students Reverend James Pierpont and Reverend Samuel Russell (who was not one of the original trustees) led the effort to create the new college. One of the several motivations for the new college was concern over the liberalizing of the Harvard education by Andrew&#x27;s former student, Leverett.

Andrew had close ties to several of his fellow trustees. Reverend Samuel Mather was his brother-in-law. Reverend Timothy Woodbridge was a college classmate. In addition to Pierpont, Noadiah Russell and James Webb were former students.

He served as the rector &quot;pro tempore&quot; of the Collegiate School between 1707 (the death of Rev. Abraham Pierson, the first rector) and 1719. During his tenure the school was renamed Yale College to honor a gift from Elihu Yale, a governor of the British East India Company. Andrew continued to reside at Milford, loyal to his congregation, teaching the senior students there. He refused to move to Saybrook, Connecticut, or, after the college moved, to New Haven.

==Family==

His first wife was Abigail Treat (1660-1727), the daughter of Governor Robert Treat and his first wife Jane Tapp. His second wife was the widow Abigail Beach. His daughter Elizabeth married the Rev. Timothy Cutler, who succeeded him as rector of Yale in 1719 and later became the first minister of Old North Church. His daughter Abigail married Governor Jonathan Law.

Graduating from Brown University in 1870 and from the Newton Theological Institution in 1874, he preached for one year and then was president of Denison University from 1875 to 1879. He was professor of homiletics at Newton Theological Institution from 1879 to 1882; professor of history and political economy at Brown University from 1882 to 1888; professor of political economy and finance at Cornell University from 1888 to 1889; and he served as the president of Brown University from 1889 until 1898. He resigned as president of Brown in 1897 because of criticism by trustees of his advocacy of free silver but at that time withdrew his resignation.
On February 1, 1890, he became a charter member and the organizing president of the Rhode Island Society of the Sons of the American Revolution (RISSAR). He was succeeded in that office later that year by John Nicholas Brown I. Ironically, although both Andrews and Brown were active in organizing the RISSAR, neither formally applied for membership in the organization.

In 1892, he was an American commissioner to the Brussels monetary conference and was a strong supporter of international bimetallism. He was also elected a member of the American Antiquarian Society in 1892.

He was the superintendent of schools for Chicago from 1898 to 1900, and then became chancellor of the University of Nebraska in 1900. He retired from academic life as chancellor emeritus of the University of Nebraska on January 1, 1909. He became a member of the corporation of Brown University in 1900 and was made president of the American Association of State Colleges and Universities in 1904.

Andrews died at his home in Interlachen, Florida in 1917, aged 73.

==Publisher==
Andrews published many college textbooks on history and economics, including: 
* &quot;An Honest Dollar&quot; (1889; third edition, 1894)

<text>Henry Stewart Fleetwood Andrews, CBE (10 November 1911 – 6 March 1989) was an English actor often known for his film portrayals of tough military officers. His performance as Regimental Sergeant Major Wilson in &quot;The Hill&quot; (1965) earned Andrews the National Board of Review Award for Best Supporting Actor and a nomination for the 1966 BAFTA Award for Best British Actor. The first of his more than 80 film appearances was in &quot;The Red Beret&quot; in 1953.

Prior to his film career, Andrews was a theatre actor, appearing at such venues as the Queen&#x27;s Theatre, the Lyceum Theatre and the Shakespeare Memorial Theatre in the UK as well as theatres in New York City, Paris, Antwerp and Brussels. Andrews made his London theatre debut in 1935 at the St James&#x27;s Theatre and his New York City debut in 1936 at the Empire Theatre.

Andrews was awarded the CBE in 1966.

== Early life ==
Harry Andrews was born on 10 November 1911 in Tonbridge, Kent. He was the son of Henry Arthur Andrews, a General Practitioner, and Amy Diana Frances (née Horner). Andrews attended Yardley Court school in Tonbridge and Wrekin College in Wellington, Shropshire.

==Military service==
Like many men of his time, Andrews joined up in October 1939 and was commissioned into the Queen&#x27;s Own Royal West Kent Regiment from 162 OCTU (The Honourable Artillery Company) on 21 September 1940 with the number 149267. In August 1942 he transferred to the Royal Artillery, serving in Europe during the D-Day Landings and on the advance into Germany. On 4 April 1946 Andrews was mentioned in dispatches &quot;for gallant and distinguished service in North West Europe&quot;. He was demobilised with the rank of Major.

==Acting==
===Theatre===
Andrews made his first stage appearance in September 1933 at the Liverpool Playhouse playing John in &quot;The Long Christmas Dinner&quot;. He made his London debut in March 1935 at the St James&#x27;s Theatre playing the role of John in &quot;Worse Things Happen at Sea&quot;. In March 1936, he featured in a cast including Paul Robeson, Orlando Martins and Robert Adams in a staging of &quot;Toussaint Louverture: The Story of the Only Successful Slave Revolt in History&quot;, a play by C. L. R. James, at the Westminster Theatre in London. In October 1936, Andrews made his first appearance in New York City playing the role of Horatio in &quot;Hamlet&quot; at the Empire Theatre. From September 1937 to April 1938, Andrews worked with John Gielgud&#x27;s company at the Queen&#x27;s Theatre, appearing in such shows as &quot;Richard II&quot;, &quot;The School for Scandal&quot; and &quot;The Merchant of Venice&quot;. In 1939, Andrews assumed the role of Laertes in a production of &quot;Hamlet&quot; at the Lyceum Theatre. This was the final production at the Lyceum before it closed, though it was restored in 1996.

In December 1945, Andrews appeared with the Old Vic company at what was then referred to as the New Theatre, succeeding George Curzon in the parts of Sir Walter Blunt in &quot;Henry IV, Part 1&quot;, Scroop in &quot;Henry IV, Part 2&quot;, Creon in &quot;Oedipus&quot; and Sneer in &quot;The Critic&quot;. The company toured to New York City in the summer of 1946, appearing at such venues as the Century Theatre. Upon returning to Britain in September 1946, Andrews continued performing with the Old Vic company through the end of the 1948–1949 season.

In 1949, Andrews joined the company at the Shakespeare Memorial Theatre in Stratford-upon-Avon, in which he performed in such Shakespearean roles as Macduff, Don Pedro and Cardinal Wolsey. Andrews toured with the company through Australia in 1949. He continued to perform with the company in Stratford-upon-Avon through the 1951 season, playing Henry IV through three consecutive Shakespeare plays. He then travelled to New York with the company of Laurence Olivier, performing in such plays as &quot;Caesar and Cleopatra&quot; and &quot;Antony and Cleopatra&quot; at the Ziegfeld Theatre. Andrews went on tour with the Old Vic company performing &quot;Henry VIII&quot; in Paris, Antwerp and Brussels.

In 1971 Andrews played the title role in &quot;Lear&quot; by Edward Bond at the Royal Court Theatre, London, continuing his association with contemporary British theatre with his role in the film adaptation of &quot;Entertaining Mr Sloane&quot; by Joe Orton of the previous year in 1970 to great critical praise.

===Film===

Andrews made his first two screen appearances with Alan Ladd in the films &quot;The Red Beret&quot; (1953) and &quot;The Black Knight&quot; (1954). He performed in several historical and adventure films, including &quot;Alexander the Great&quot; and &quot;Moby Dick&quot; (both 1956), &quot;Ice Cold in Alex&quot; (1958), &quot;Solomon and Sheba&quot; (1959) and &quot;633 Squadron&quot; (1964). In the 1960s and 1970s, Andrews began performing more frequently in dramas and comedy films. He received the award for Best Supporting Actor from the National Board of Review of Motion Pictures for his performances in &quot;The Agony and the Ecstasy&quot; (1965) as Donato Bramante. The film starred Charlton Heston with whom Andrews shared several scenes in &quot;55 Days at Peking&quot; (1963) and &quot;The Hill&quot; (1965) alongside Sean Connery. His performance in &quot;The Hill&quot; also resulted in Andrews being nominated for the 1966 BAFTA award for Best British Actor, though the award was won by Dirk Bogarde for his performance in &quot;Darling&quot;. Andrews later appeared in such films as the comedy &quot;The Jokers&quot; (1967), the musical comedy &quot;The Night They Raided Minsky&#x27;s&quot; (1968), the 1970 film adaptation of Emily Brontë&#x27;s novel &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot;, &quot;Entertaining Mr. Sloane&quot;, the 1970 film adaptation of the 1964 play by 
Joe Orton, the comedy &quot;The Ruling Class&quot; (1972), &quot;Man of La Mancha&quot; (1972) as the Innkeeper, the horror film &quot;Theatre of Blood&quot; (1973), and the 1976 film adaptation of Maurice Maeterlinck&#x27;s play &quot;The Blue Bird&quot;, which was the first film collaboration between the United States and Soviet Russia. In 1978 he portrayed Norris the butler in Michael Winner&#x27;s version of Raymond Chandler&#x27;s &quot;The Big Sleep&quot; starring Robert Mitchum as Philip Marlowe.

Andrews was known for his portrayal of tough military officers. These performances included Sergeant Payne in &quot;A Hill in Korea&quot; (1956), Major Henry in &quot;I Accuse!&quot; (1958), Major Swindon in the 1959 film adaptation of George Bernard Shaw&#x27;s play &quot;The Devil&#x27;s Disciple&quot;, Captain Graham in &quot;A Touch of Larceny&quot; (also 1959), the 3rd Earl of Lucan in &quot;The Charge of the Light Brigade&quot; (1968) and Colonel Thompson in &quot;Too Late the Hero&quot; in 1970, and Grand Duke Nicholas, commander of the Russian army, in &quot;Nicholas and Alexandra &quot;in 1971.

In addition to film work, Andrews also appeared in several television series. In the early 1960s, Andrews appeared in two episodes of &quot;Armchair Theatre&quot;. He portrayed Colonel Bruce in &quot;Edward the Seventh&quot; (1975) and Darius Clayhanger in a 1976 television series based on The Clayhanger Family novels. He played one of the Kryptonian elders during the sentencing of the three villains in the film &quot;Superman&quot; (1978). He played the Prime Minister, Lord Bellinger, in the 1986 adaptation of Sherlock Holmes&#x27; &quot;The Second Stain&quot;. In 1985, Andrews was interviewed on an episode of &quot;This Is Your Life&quot;.

The Kalapuya tribes&#x27; traditional homelands were the Willamette Valley of present-day western Oregon in the United States, an area bounded by the Cascade Range to the east, the Oregon Coast Range at the west, the Columbia River at the north, to the Calapooya Mountains of the Umpqua River at the south.

Today, most Kalapuya people are enrolled in the federally recognized Confederated Tribes of the Grand Ronde Community of Oregon; in addition, some are members of the Confederated Tribes of the Siletz. In both cases descendants have often intermarried with people of other tribes in the confederated tribes, and are counted in overall tribal numbers, rather than separately. Most of the Kalapuya descendants live at the Grand Ronde reservation, located in Yamhill and Polk counties.

==Name==
The tribal name has been rendered into English under various spellings as &quot;Calapooia,&quot; &quot;Calapuya,&quot; &quot;Calapooya,&quot; &quot;Kalapooia,&quot; and &quot;Kalapooya.&quot;

==Language==
The Kalapuyan people spoke dialects of the Kalapuyan language. It was categorized by John Wesley Powell as part of the Takelman language group. In the early 21st century, these are known as the Oregon Penutian languages.

The Kalapuyan people were not a single homogeneous tribal entity but rather were made up of eight autonomous subdivisions, loosely related to one another by three language dialects, which were mutually intelligible. The eight related groups comprising the Kalapuya people spoke three distinct dialects of the Oregon Penutian language family: Northern Kalapuyan, Central Kalapuyan, and Yoncalla (also called Southern Kalapuya).

Catholic missionary François Blanchet said that &quot;fourteen or fifteen different dialects were spoken by these tribes; they are not so essentially different but that they can understand each other. Moreover, the Chinook jargon is spoken among the Kalapooias [sic].&quot; Chinook jargon was a trade language that developed among the Native Americans for their own use and for trading with Europeans. It became popular on the Grand Ronde Reservation. The Confederated Tribes of the Grand Ronde Community have renamed it as &quot;Chinuk Wawa,&quot; and developed a language immersion program for children to create new generations of native speakers.

==Social structure==
Kalapuya bands typically consisted of extended families of related men, their wives, and children. They had a patrilineal kinship system. These bands would occupy a year-round village: during the winter they lived there full-time. During the spring and summer, some members split off into smaller groups and traveled to other areas to gather seasonal food and raw materials for basketry. Bands frequently had a single leader or chief— generally the wealthiest man — who would resolve arguments, settle collective debts of the community such as those incurred through gambling, and would provide food for feasts.

As was the case for many tribes of the Pacific Northwest, the Kalapuya practiced slavery. They generally obtained Indian slaves through trade or as gifts. The slaves were usually captured by enemy peoples during raids. Northern Kalapuya groups, such as the Tualatin and Yamhill, obtained slaves through conquest, raiding bands located on the coast or further south in the Willamette Valley. Slaves were considered a form of wealth; they were traded to obtain desired commodities, including beads, blankets, and canoes. Women and children were preferred as slaves, owing to their comparative ease of control.

Slaves lived with the families who owned them, working side-by-side in gender-specific daily tasks and performing chores such as the collection of firewood and water. Slaves were often free to marry. They could purchase freedom through their own accumulation of property or through sufficient payment to the owner by a prospective spouse.

The patriarchal Kalapuyan society had divisions by wealth and personal property. Special religious leaders were also recognized as a distinct class. These people were believed to possess supernatural predictive or healing powers and could have their origin in any group; they might be male or female, free individual or slave.

Kalapuyan society had gender-differentiated labor, as did many Native American tribes. Men engaged in fishing, hunting, and warfare. They also made tools and constructed canoes. Women worked to gather and prepare the staple plant foods that were the basis of the Kalapuyan diet, set up temporary camps, and constructed baskets and other craft products. During the summer months the women of the band would process and prepare food products for winter storage, generally staying in the main village to complete the task, while others gathered the foods from afar.

=== Historic Kalapuyan groups ===
The Kalapuyan groups (identified by language) were:

Northern Kalapuya:
*Tualatin, also known as the Atfalati, along the Tualatin River 
*Yamhill, along the Yamhill River

Central Kalapuya:
*Ahantchuyuk, along the Pudding River 
*Luckiamute, along the Luckiamute River 
*Santiam, along the lower Santiam River near present-day Lebanon 
*Chepenefa, along the Marys River near present-day Corvallis 
*Chemapho, along Muddy Creek (Central Kalapuya)
*Tsankupi, along the Calapooia River 
*Mohawk, along the Mohawk River (Note: These have no relation to the Iroquoian-speaking Mohawk Nation of New York and Canada)
*Chafan
*Chelamela, along the Long Tom River 
*Winefelly, along the Mohawk, McKenzie, and Coast Fork Willamette rivers.

Yoncalla: 
*Yoncalla, along the Umpqua River.

In his description of the Indians of the Willamette Valley in 1849, Governor Joseph Lane gave the following estimates for the tribes&#x27; populations:
&quot;Calipoa&quot;: 60; &quot;Tualatine&quot;: 60; &quot;Yam Hill&quot;: 90; &quot;Lucka-mues&quot;: 15.

==History==
The Kalapuya people are believed to have entered their historical homeland in the Willamette Valley by migrating from the south of the valley northwards and forcing out earlier inhabitants.

Each of these bands occupied specific areas along the Willamette, Umpqua, and McKenzie rivers. The various Kalapuyan bands were hunter-gatherers, gaining food by fishing and hunting by the men, and gathering of nuts, berries and other fruits and roots by the women. The tribe made use of obsidian obtained from the volcanic ranges to the east to fashion sharp and effective projectile points, including arrowheads and spear tips.

Prior to contact with white explorers, traders, and missionaries, the Kalapuya population is believed to have numbered as many as 15,000 people. Robert Boyd estimates the total Kalapuyan population between 8,780 and 9,200 for the period between 1805 and the end of the decade of the 1820s.

Catastrophic epidemics of infectious diseases such as malaria, smallpox, and other endemic diseases occurred after Natives contracted diseases from the white explorers, traders, and missionaries who entered the region. These diseases were endemic among the Europeans and Americans, but the Native Americans didn&#x27;t have immunity to them and died at a high rate as a result. Some accounts tell of villages devoid of inhabitants, standing in grim testament to the high mortality of these epidemics. Blanchet reported in 1839 that diseases &quot;reduced [them] to a very small population threatening to decline more and more.&quot;

By 1849 Oregon territorial governor Joseph Lane reckoned the remaining Kalapuyan population at just 60 souls — with those survivors living in the most dire of conditions. Contemporary scholarship estimates the total of the various Kalapuya peoples in this interval at closer to 600.

=== Treaties with the United States ===
The United States conducted two major cycles of treatymaking in Oregon that affected the Kalapuya: in 1851 and in 1854 to 1855. The 1851 treaties were negotiated by Oregon&#x27;s Superintendent of Indian Affairs Anson Dart, and those in 1855 by Dart&#x27;s successor Joel Palmer. While the 1851 treaties were never ratified by the Senate and thus were not implemented, the 1854–1855 ones were.

On April 12, 1851, at the Santiam Treaty Council in Champoeg, Oregon Territory, Santiam Kalapuya tribal leaders voiced strong opinions over where they would live. The Santiam leaders Alquema and Tiacan wanted to maintain their traditional territory between the forks of the Santiam River.

In the 1854 Treaty of Calapooia Creek, Oregon, Umpqua and Kalapuyan tribes of Umpqua Valley ceded their lands to the United States.

In the Treaty with the Kalapuya, etc., at Dayton, Oregon (January 22, 1855), the Kalapuya and other tribes of the Willamette valley ceded the entire drainage area of the Willamette River to the United States.

=== Reservation era ===

Most Kalapuya Indians were removed to the Grand Ronde Agency and reservation. Some were assigned to the Siletz Reservation (known then as the Coast Indian Reservation) on the central Pacific Coast of Oregon, Warm Springs Reservation east of the Cascade Mountains in what are now Wasco and Jefferson Counties, or Yakama Reservation in Southern Washington State. Settled in 1855 as a temporary reserve, the Grand Ronde Reservation was first called the Yamhill River Reserve or Yamhill Valley reserve. It was officially renamed and established as the Grand Ronde Reservation by Executive Order in 1857.

With members of at least 27 tribes removed to Grand Ronde, life at the reservation was difficult. Some of these tribes had historically been enemies. In the early years, the reservation was managed by the US Department of War. As it had earlier waged war against the tribes, it supervised Indian affairs across the country. Fort Yamhill was established to oversee the Indians. Later Indian management was taken over by the Commissioner of Indian Affairs and finally the Bureau of Indian Affairs, placed within the Department of Interior.

Rev. Adrien Croquet (Crocket) of Belgium was the Roman Catholic missionary at Grand Ronde and established St. Michael&#x27;s church. The Roman Catholic Church also established a school there in the late 19th century with approval by the United States. The school was an on-reservation boarding school to which children from other sites were at times forcibly removed and made to stay at school throughout the school year. Many children were later sent to off-reservation Indian boarding schools, such as Chemawa Indian School in Salem. Most children were taught rural skills such as blacksmithing, farming, sewing, etc. believed to be important to their future lives on the reservation.

Sanitation and health care at the reservation was poor, and mortality was high. In the 1850s a total of 1,000 people had been moved there. By 1900, only about 300 people survived.

=== Termination and restoration ===

In the mid-20th century, Federal policy continued to be directed at assimilation of Native Americans. Congress believed that some tribes were ready to enter the mainstream society and end their special relationship with the government. All of the bands and tribes of the Kalapuya descendants were terminated in 1954, along with all other western Oregon tribes, in the Western Oregon Indian Termination Act of 1954. This ended their special relationship with the federal government. Under final termination actions, the government sold most of the reservation lands, removed its services, and published final rolls of the tribe in the &quot;Congressional Record&quot; in 1956.

In the late 20th century, the Kalapuya and other peoples in the confederated tribes reorganized to assert their Native American culture. The United States restored federal recognition in 1977 to the Confederated Tribes of the Siletz and in 1983 to those who were part of the Confederated Tribes of the Grand Ronde Community of Oregon.

The Kalapuya have intermarried extensively with descendants of their neighboring tribes. Most of the estimated 4,000 Kalapuya descendants today are enrolled in Confederated Tribes of the Grand Ronde Community of Oregon. This community is working to revive a common creole Native American language, long used for trade among various tribes and now known as &quot;Chinuk Wawa&quot;, by developing an immersion program for their children. They have had success in producing native speakers and are expanding the program through the eighth grade.

<doc id="769862" wikidata="Q236216" url="?curid=769862" title="Angela Merici">
<text>Angela Merici ( ; ; 21 March 1474 – 27 January 1540) was an Italian Catholic religious educator who founded the Company of St. Ursula in 1535 in Brescia, in which women dedicated their lives to the service of the church through the education of girls. 

From this organisation later sprang the Order of Saint Ursula, whose nuns established places of prayer and learning throughout Europe and, later, worldwide, most notably in North America.

After her death, Merici was venerated by Catholics around the world and a cause for sainthood was opened. She was canonized by Pope Pius VII in 1807.

==Life==
Merici was born in 1474 on a farm near Desenzano del Garda, a small town on the southwestern shore of Lake Garda in Lombardy, Italy. She and her older sister, Giana Maria, were left orphans when she was ten years old. They went to live with their uncle in the town of Salò. Young Angela was very distressed when her sister suddenly died without receiving the last rites of the church and prayed that her sister&#x27;s soul rest in peace. It is said that in a vision she received a response that her sister was in heaven in the company of the saints. She joined the Third Order of St. Francis around that time. People began to notice Angela&#x27;s beauty and particularly to admire her hair. As she had promised herself to God, and wanted to avoid the worldly attention, she dyed her hair with soot.

Merici&#x27;s uncle died when she was twenty years old and she returned to her home in Desenzano, and lived with her brothers, on her own property, given to her in lieu of the dowry that would otherwise have been hers had she married. She later had another vision that revealed to her that she was to found an association of virgins who were to devote their lives to the religious training of young girls. This association was a success and she was invited to start another school in the neighboring city of Brescia.

According to legend, in 1524, while traveling to the Holy Land, Merici suddenly became blind when she was on the island of Crete. Despite this, she continued her journey to the Holy Land and was ostensibly cured of her blindness on her return, while praying before a crucifix, at the same place where she had been struck with blindness a few weeks earlier. In 1525, she journeyed to Rome in order to gain the indulgences of the Jubilee Year then being celebrated. Pope Clement VII, who had heard of her virtue and success with her school, invited her to remain in Rome. Merici disliked notoriety, however, and soon returned to Brescia.

On 25 November 1535, Merici gathered with 12 young women who had joined in her work in a small house in Brescia near the Church of Saint Afra, where together they committed themselves in the founding of the Company of St. Ursula, placed under the protection of the patroness of medieval universities. Her goal was to elevate family life through the Christian education of future wives and mothers. They were the first teaching order of women religious.

Four years later the group had grown to 28. Merici taught her companions to serve God, but to remain in the world, teaching the girls of their own neighborhood, and to practice a religious form of life in their own homes. The members wore no special habit and took no formal religious vows. Merici wrote a Rule of Life for the group, which specified the practice of celibacy, poverty and obedience in their own homes. The Ursulines opened orphanages and schools. On 18 March 1537, she was elected &quot;Mother and Mistress&quot; of the group. The Rule she had written was approved in 1544 by Pope Paul III.

When Merici died in Brescia on 27 January 1540, there were 24 communities of the Company of St. Ursula serving the Catholic Church through the region. Her body was clothed in the habit of a Franciscan tertiary and was interred in the Church of Sant&#x27;Afra.

The traditional view is that Merici believed that better Christian education was needed for girls and young women, to which end she dedicated her life. Querciolo Mazzonis argues that the Company of St. Ursula was not originally intended as a charitable group specifically focused on the education of poor girls, but that this direction developed after her death in 1540, sometime after it received formal recognition in 1546.

==Veneration==

During her life, Merici had often prayed at the tombs of the Brescian martyrs at the Church of St. Afra in Brescia. She lived in small rooms attached to a priory of the Canons Regular of the Lateran. According to her wishes, after her death, she was interred in the Church of St Afra to be near the martyrs&#x27; remains. There her body remained until the complete destruction of this church and its surrounding area by Allied bombing during the Second World War, on 2 March 1945, in which the parish priest and many townspeople died. The church and corresponding buildings were afterwards rebuilt, and reopened on 10 April 1954. The church was consecrated on 27 January 1956, with a new dedication to Saint Angela Merici, while the Parish of St. Afra was transferred to the neighboring Church of St. Eufemia.

Merici was beatified in Rome on 30 April 1768, by Pope Clement XIII. She was later canonized on 24 May 1807 by Pope Pius VII.

===Feast day===
Merici was not included in the 1570 Tridentine calendar of Pope Pius V because she was not canonized until 1807. In 1861, her feast day was included in the Roman calendar – not on the day of her death, 27 January, since this date was occupied by the feast day of Saint John Chrysostom, but instead on 31 May. In 1955, Pope Pius XII assigned this date to the new feast of the Queenship of Mary, and moved Merici&#x27;s feast to 1 June. The celebration was ranked as a Double until 1960, when Pope John XXIII gave it the equivalent rank of Third-Class Feast. Lastly, in the major 1969 reform of the liturgy, Pope Paul VI moved the celebration, ranked as a Memorial, to the saint&#x27;s day of death, 27 January.

<text>James Rowland Angell (; May 8, 1869 – March 4, 1949) was an American psychologist and educator who served as the 16th President of Yale University between 1921 and 1937. His father, James Burrill Angell (1829–1916), was president of the University of Vermont from 1866 to 1871 and then the University of Michigan from 1871 to 1909.

==Biography==

===Early life and education===
Angell was born on May 8, 1869, in Burlington, Vermont. He was born into one of the stellar academic families in American history. A sixth-generation descendant of Thomas Angell who settled Providence, Rhode Island, James&#x27;s father, James Burrill Angell, was the president of the University of Vermont and thence president of the University of Michigan. He was the youngest of three children, with an older brother and sister. When Angell was two years old, his family moved to Ann Arbor so that his father could take up the presidency of the University of Michigan. His maternal grandfather, Alexis Caswell, was a professor of mathematics and astronomy at Brown University, later becoming its president. He was also a charter member of the National Academy of Sciences. His brother Alexis C. Angell became a professor of law of Michigan, and later a federal judge. His sister&#x27;s husband, Andrew C. McLaughlin, was head of the history department at Michigan. His cousin, Frank Angell, founded psychology laboratories at Cornell and Stanford Universities.

Angell graduated from the University of Michigan with his bachelor&#x27;s degree in 1890. He worked closely with John Dewey, earning a master&#x27;s degree under his supervision in 1891. At Michigan he was a member of Delta Kappa Epsilon fraternity (Omicron chapter). He then went to Harvard University where he received a second master&#x27;s degree in 1892 in psychology. He studied for a doctorate in philosophy in Berlin and Halle. His dissertation on the treatment of freedom in Kant was accepted, but required stylistic changes, which he never completed. Instead, he decided to take up a post at the University of Minnesota. He did, however, receive 23 honorary degrees during his lifetime.

===Career===

In 1895, Angell was offered a position at the University of Chicago by John Dewey, who had moved from Michigan the year before. Almost immediately, he co-authored an article with his Chicago colleague Addison W. Moore that simultaneously settled a nasty dispute between Cornell psychologist Edward Bradford Titchener and Princeton psychologist James Mark Baldwin as well as laying the foundations for the school of Functionalism. Later, while still at Chicago, Angell published the textbook &quot;Psychology; An Introductory Study of the Structure and Functions of Human Consciousness&quot; in 1904, which became the major statement of the functionalist approach to psychology. Angell noted that the goal of psychology was to study how the mind helps the organism adjust to the environment and functionalism was a method in which to study consciousness and how it improves the organism relationship with the environment. In 1905 (the year after Dewey left Chicago for Columbia University), Angell became the head of the newly created psychology department at Chicago. During this time he served as the 15th and youngest president of the American Psychological Association. He also supervised the young John B. Watson, who would later go on to found the behaviorist school of psychology. In 1908, Angell was raised to the level of Dean at Chicago, leaving the psychology department to another of his former students, Harvey Carr. During the last year of World War I Angell worked for the military under the supervision of Northwestern University psychologist Walter Dill Scott. The following year (1918), he returned to Chicago to serve as Acting President. The school would not make him president on a permanent basis, however, because he was not Baptist. In 1919 he left Chicago to head the National Research Council. In 1920, he headed the Carnegie Corporation of New York.

===Yale presidency===
In 1921, Angell was appointed President of Yale University, the first non-Yale graduate to hold the position since the early 18th century. That same year, he was elected as an honorary member of the Connecticut Society of the Cincinnati. At Yale, he oversaw a major expansion of Yale&#x27;s physical campus, including the completion of the residential college system and Sterling Memorial Library. He remained president of the university until his retirement in 1937, at which point he became educational counselor of the National Broadcasting Company (NBC). He was elected a member of the American Philosophical Society in 1924 and a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1932. As president of Yale, Angell was a proponent of eugenics.

===NBC===
Angell&#x27;s role at NBC was to &quot;devise and suggest methods by which we may more capably serve radio&#x27;s listening millions&quot;. He often wrote about that topic and lectured about it. Angell was a driving force behind the development of the art-appreciation program &quot;Art for Your Sake&quot;, which debuted on NBC radio in October 1939. He was also chairman of the Board of Trustees of the National Art Society, which devoted efforts to &quot;&#x27;mass production plus mass distribution&#x27; of cultural products&quot;. 

===Death===
Angell died on March 4, 1949, in New Haven, Connecticut.

===Marriages===
In 1894, James married Marion Isabel Watrous from Des Moines, Iowa, a fellow graduate of the University of Michigan. He had two children with her, one boy and one girl, but then she died in 1931. He subsequently married Katharine Cramer Woodman in 1932, who brought great joy to his life because of the interest she took in his students and problems. Katharine Angell founded the New Haven Restaurant Institute, later known as the Culinary Institute of America.

==Functional psychology==
He was greatly influenced by the thought of John Dewey and is closely identified with functional psychology.

Angell laid out his three major points about functionalism during his presidential address for the American Psychological Association.

#Functional psychology is interested in mental operations by way of mental activity and its relation to the larger biological forces. Angell believes that functional psychologists must consider the evolution of the mental operations in humans as one particular way to deal with the conditions of our environment. Mental operations by themselves are of little interest. Functional psychology is not conscious elements .
#Mental processes aid in the cooperation between the needs of the organism and its environment. Mental functions help the organism survive by aiding in the behavioral habits of the organism and unfamiliar situations.
#Mind and body cannot be separated because functionalism is the study of mental operations and their relationship with behavior. The total relationship of the organism and the environment and the minds function/place in this union is at question.

By stating these points, Angell drew the difference between functionalism as a study to discover how mental processed operate, what they accomplish that has kept them around, and the conditions in which they occur or the how and why of consciousness and its predecessor, structuralism, which focused on individual mental elements or the what of consciousness.

==Criticisms==
James Angell did have some criticism come his way for his views. The backlash from some about his implication of leaving out the structuralism model in studies and having a completely functionalist view did not sit well amongst some of his peers. There was also the dissecting of his works and the assumption that he contradicted himself in his view of what consciousness was and its function. Some think that he portrayed consciousness as more of a deux ex machina entity in its function due to his claim that the function of the conscious was to appear when the organism was in trouble and then disappear soon after the trouble had passed.
In her book &quot;Primate Visions: Gender, Race, and Nature in the World of Modern Science&quot;, Donna Haraway writes that &quot;Angell paradigmatically represented the elaborate interconnections of university, industry, philanthropy, and science policy in the development of the material structures and ideologies of scientific management of society.&quot; (p. 67)

<doc id="769871" wikidata="Q1248509" url="?curid=769871" title="Room 222">
<text>Room 222 is an American comedy-drama television series produced by 20th Century Fox Television that aired on ABC for 112 episodes, from September 17, 1969, until January 11, 1974. The show was broadcast on Wednesday evenings at 8:30 (ET) for its first two seasons, before settling into Friday evenings at 9:00, following &quot;The Brady Bunch&quot; and &quot;The Partridge Family&quot;, and preceding &quot;The Odd Couple&quot; and &quot;Love, American Style&quot;.

In 1970, &quot;Room 222&quot; earned the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding New Series, while Michael Constantine and Karen Valentine won for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Comedy Series and Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Comedy Series, respectively.

==Plot==
Although the series primarily focuses on an American history class in Room 222 at the fictional Walt Whitman High School, in Los Angeles, California, it also depicts other events in and outside the school, such as the home lives of the racially diverse student body and faculty.

The history class is taught by Pete Dixon (Lloyd Haynes), an idealistic African American teacher. Other characters featured in the show include the school&#x27;s compassionate guidance counselor, Liz McIntyre (Denise Nicholas), who is also Pete&#x27;s girlfriend; the dryly humorous school principal, Seymour Kaufman (Michael Constantine); the petite and enthusiastic Alice Johnson (Karen Valentine), who is initially a student teacher, later full-time teacher whom Pete mentors; and Principal Kaufman&#x27;s secretary, Miss Hogarth, played by Patsy Garrett. Also, many recurring students are featured from episode to episode.

Pete Dixon delivers gentle lessons in tolerance and understanding to his students, and they admire his wisdom, insight, and easygoing manner. The themes of the episodes are sometimes topical, reflecting the contemporary political climate of the late 1960s and early-to-mid 1970s, such as the Vietnam War, women&#x27;s rights, race relations, and Watergate. However, most plots are timeless and feature themes still common to modern-day teenagers. For example, the 1969 episode &quot;Funny Boy&quot; deals with a class clown who is self-conscious about being overweight. In the 1971 episode &quot;What Is a Man?&quot;, a student is a mistaken victim of anti-gay harassment, while the 1974 episode &quot;I Didn&#x27;t Raise My Girl to Be a Soldier&quot; delves into parent–teenage child issues.

==Episodes==


==Production==
The program was filmed at 20th Century Fox studios. Exterior shots of Los Angeles High School, pre-1971 earthquake, were shown in the opening credits, and some outdoor scenes in the early seasons.

The show draws some comparisons to a theatrical movie which premiered during the show&#x27;s first season, &quot;Halls of Anger&quot;. In that movie, a new, black teacher joins a southern California high school; an attractive, sympathetic black female member of staff shows romantic interest; a militant black student is frequently involved in situations; issues of racism and integration are featured. The film and television show also share actors (Ta-Tanisha, Helen Kleeb, Rob Reiner). However, while &quot;Room 222&quot; is a comedy drama, milder in tone, &quot;Halls of Anger&quot; is purposefully aggressive, using deliberately controversial language and some forceful violence to highlight the real and dangerous potential of unresolved racial conflict.

==Reception==
&quot;Room 222&quot;&#x27;s initial episodes garnered weak ratings, and ABC was poised to cancel the program after one season. However, the show earned several nominations at the 1970 Emmy Awards, and ABC relented. In the spring of 1970, &quot;Room 222&quot; won Emmy Awards for Best New Series; Best Supporting Actor (Michael Constantine); and Best Supporting Actress (Karen Valentine). The following year, Constantine and Valentine were again nominated in the supporting acting awards category. After the shaky first season, &quot;Room 222&quot; nevertheless managed to receive respectable ratings during its next three years. Ratings peaked during the 1971–72 season, during which it held a #28 viewership ranking. By the start of the 1973–74 season, ratings had fallen drastically, and ABC canceled the show at mid-season. After the series ended, the program entered syndication and was rerun on several television stations throughout the United States.

==Legacy==

The Television Academy Foundation has credited &quot;Room 222&quot; for not only in the way it portrayed a racially integrated classroom and revolved around &quot;a dedicated and student-friendly African-American history teacher,&quot; but also for predating Norman Lear&#x27;s 1970s sitcoms when it came to invoking serious social issues, stating that &quot;A season and a half before Norman Lear made &quot;relevant&quot; programming a dominant genre with the introduction of programs like &quot;All in the Family&quot; and &quot;Maude&quot;, &quot;Room 222&quot; was using the form of the half-hour comedy to discuss serious contemporary issues. During its five seasons on the air, the show included episodes that dealt with such topics as racism, sexism, homophobia, dropping out of school, shoplifting, drug use among both teachers and students, illiteracy, cops in school, guns in school, Vietnam war veterans, venereal disease, and teenage pregnancy&quot;. According to the Television Academy Foundation, &quot;the show broke new narrative ground that would later be developed by the major sitcom factories of the 1970s, Grant Tinker&#x27;s MTM Enterprises and Norman Lear&#x27;s Tandem Productions.&quot;

==Music==
The theme song was written by composer Jerry Goldsmith, written in a 7/4 time signature. 7/4 is, itself, uncommon, but Goldsmith&#x27;s theme subdivides the meter as 4+3/3+4, 3+4/4+3. His theme and two episode scores for the series (&quot;Richie&#x27;s Story&quot; (the pilot) and &quot;The Flu&quot;) were later issued by Film Score Monthly on an album with his score for the film &quot;Ace Eli and Rodger of the Skies&quot;.

==Books and comics==
A series of novels based on characters and dialog of the series was written by William Johnston and published by Tempo Books in the early 1970s. Dell Comics published a comic book for four issues during 1970 and 1971.

==Home media==
Shout! Factory has released the first two seasons of &quot;Room 222&quot; on DVD in Region 1. As of 2022, these releases have been discontinued and are out of print. It is unknown if the remaining three seasons will be released.

<text>Glyndŵr was one of six local government districts in the county of Clwyd in Wales from 1974 to 1996.

==History==
The district was created on 1 April 1974, under the Local Government Act 1972. It covered the area of six former districts and two parishes from a seventh district, which were all abolished at the same time:
*Ceiriog Rural District
*Denbigh Municipal Borough
*Edeyrnion Rural District
*Llangollen Urban District
*Llangollen Rural parish from Wrexham Rural District
*Llantysilio parish from Wrexham Rural District
*Ruthin Municipal Borough
*Ruthin Rural District
The Edeyrnion Rural District had been in the administrative county of Merioneth prior to the reforms, whereas all the other parts of the new district had been in Denbighshire.

The district was named after Owain Glyndŵr, who had lived in the area at Glyndyfrdwy in the late 14th and early 15th centuries.

In 1996 the district was abolished under the Local Government (Wales) Act 1994, which saw Clwyd County Council and its constituent districts abolished, being replaced by principal areas, whose councils perform the functions which had previously been divided between the county and district councils. The area of Glyndŵr was divided between three principal areas with effect from 1 April 1996: the majority went to Denbighshire, with smaller areas going to Wrexham and Powys.

==Political control==
The first election to the council was held in 1973, initially operating as a shadow authority alongside the outgoing authorities until it came into its powers on 1 April 1974. Throughout the council&#x27;s existence the majority of the seats on the council were held by independent councillors:
==Premises==
The council was based at County Hall on Wynnstay Road in Ruthin. The building had been built in 1909 for the former Denbighshire County Council. After Glyndŵr District Council&#x27;s abolition in 1996 the building became the headquarters of the new Denbighshire County Council.

<text>A fishing trawler is a commercial fishing vessel designed to operate fishing trawls. Trawling is a method of fishing that involves actively dragging or pulling a trawl through the water behind one or more trawlers. Trawls are fishing nets that are pulled along the bottom of the sea or in midwater at a specified depth. A trawler may also operate two or more trawl nets simultaneously (double-rig and multi-rig).

There are many variants of trawling gear. They vary according to local traditions, bottom conditions, and how large and powerful the trawling boats are. A trawling boat can be a small open boat with only 30 horsepower (22 kW) or a large factory ship with 10,000 horsepower (7457 kW). Trawl variants include beam trawls, large-opening midwater trawls, and large bottom trawls, such as &quot;rock hoppers&quot; that are rigged with heavy rubber wheels that let the net crawl over rocky bottom.

==History==
The 17th century saw the development of an early type of sailing trawler called a Dogger, which commonly operated in the North Sea. It takes its name from an earlier type of the same name, and from the area fished. The word is the Dutch word for codfish (&quot;dogge&quot;), but has come to mean a fishing vessel which tows a trawl. Doggers were slow but sturdy, capable of fishing in the rough conditions of the North Sea.

The modern fishing trawler was developed in the 19th century, at the English fishing port of Brixham. By the early 19th century, the fishermen at Brixham needed to expand their fishing area further than ever before due to the ongoing depletion of stocks that was occurring in the overfished waters of South Devon. The Brixham trawler that evolved there was of a sleek build and had a tall gaff rig, which gave the vessel sufficient speed to make long-distance trips out to the fishing grounds in the ocean. They were also sufficiently robust to be able to tow large trawls in deep water. The great trawling fleet that built up at Brixham earned the village the title of &#x27;Mother of Deep-Sea Fisheries&#x27;.

This revolutionary design made large scale trawling in the ocean possible for the first time, resulting in a substantial migration of fishermen from the ports in the South of England, to villages further north, such as Scarborough, Hull, Grimsby, Harwich and Yarmouth, that were points of access to the large fishing grounds in the Atlantic Ocean. The small village of Grimsby grew to become the &#x27;largest fishing port in the world&#x27; by the mid 19th century. With the tremendous expansion in the fishing industry, the Grimsby Dock Company was opened in 1854 as the first modern fishing port. The facilities incorporated many innovations of the time – the dock gates and cranes were operated by hydraulic power, and the Grimsby Dock Tower was built to provide a head of water with sufficient pressure by William Armstrong.

The elegant Brixham trawler spread across the world, influencing fishing fleets everywhere. By the end of the 19th century, there were over 3,000 fishing trawlers in commission in Britain, with almost 1,000 at Grimsby. These trawlers were sold to fishermen around Europe, including from the Netherlands and Scandinavia. Twelve trawlers went on to form the nucleus of the German fishing fleet.

===Advent of steam power===
The earliest steam-powered fishing boats first appeared in the 1870s and used the trawl system of fishing as well as lines and drift nets. These were large boats, usually in length with a beam of around . They weighed 40–50 tons and travelled at .

The earliest purpose-built fishing vessels were designed and made by David Allan in Leith in March 1875, when he converted a drifter to steam power. In 1877, he built the first screw-propelled steam trawler in the world. This vessel was &quot;Pioneer LH854&quot;. She was of wooden construction with two masts and carried a gaff-rigged main and mizen using booms, and a single foresail. Allan argued that his motivation for steam power was to increase the safety of fishermen. However local fishermen saw power trawling as a threat. Allan built a total of ten boats at Leith between 1877 and 1881. Twenty-one boats were completed at Granton, his last vessel being &quot;Degrave&quot; in 1886. Most of these were sold to foreign owners in France, Belgium, Spain and the West Indies.

The first steam boats were made of wood, but steel hulls were soon introduced and were divided into watertight compartments. They were well designed for the crew with a large building that contained the wheelhouse and the deckhouse. The boats built in the 20th century only had a mizzen sail, which was used to help steady the boat when its nets were out. The main function of the mast was now as a crane for lifting the catch ashore. It also had a steam capstan on the foredeck near the mast for hauling nets. These boats had a crew of twelve made up of a skipper, driver, fireman (to look after the boiler) and nine deck hands.

Steam fishing boats had many advantages. They were usually about than the sailing vessels so they could carry more nets and catch more fish. This was important, as the market was growing quickly at the beginning of the 20th century. They could travel faster and further and with greater freedom from weather, wind and tide. Because less time was spent travelling to and from the fishing grounds, more time could be spent fishing. The steam boats also gained the highest prices for their fish, as they could return quickly to harbour with their fresh catch.

Steam trawlers were introduced at Grimsby and Hull in the 1880s. In 1890 it was estimated that there were 20,000 men on the North Sea. The steam drifter was not used in the herring fishery until 1897. The last sailing fishing trawler was built in 1925 in Grimsby.

===Further development===

Trawler designs adapted as the way they were powered changed from sail to coal-fired steam by World War I to diesel and turbines by the end of World War II.

The first trawlers fished over the side, rather than over the stern. In 1947, the company Christian Salvesen, based in Leith, Scotland, refitted a surplus &quot;Algerine&quot;-class minesweeper (HMS &quot;Felicity&quot;) with refrigeration equipment and a factory ship stern ramp, to produce the first combined freezer/stern trawler in 1947.

The first purpose-built stern trawler was &quot;Fairtry&quot; built in 1953 at Aberdeen. The ship was much larger than any other trawlers then in operation and inaugurated the era of the &#x27;super trawler&#x27;. As the ship pulled its nets over the stern, it could lift out a much greater haul of up to 60 tonnes. &quot;Lord Nelson&quot; followed in 1961, installed with vertical plate freezers that had been researched and built at the Torry Research Station. These ships served as a basis for the expansion of &#x27;super trawlers&#x27; around the world in the following decades.

Since World War II, commercial fishing vessels have been increasingly equipped with electronic aids, such as radio navigation aids and fish finders. During the Cold War, some countries fitted fishing trawlers with additional electronic gear so they could be used as spy ships to monitor the activities of other countries.

==Modern trawlers==
Modern trawlers are usually decked vessels designed for robustness. Their superstructure (wheelhouse and accommodation) can be forward, midship or aft. Motorised winches, electronic navigation and sonar systems are usually installed. Fishing equipment varies in sophistication depending on the size of the vessel and the technology used. Design features for modern fishing trawlers vary substantially, as many national maritime jurisdictions do not impose compulsory vessel inspection standards for smaller commercial fishing vessels.

===Mechanised hauling===
Mechanised hauling devices are used on modern trawlers. Trawl winches, such as Gilson winches, net drums and other auxiliary winches are installed on deck to control the towing warps (trawling wires) and store them when not in use.

===Electronics===

Modern trawlers make extensive use of contemporary electronics, including navigation and communication equipment, fish detection devices, and equipment to control and monitor gear. Just which equipment will be installed depends on the size and type of the trawler.

Much of this equipment can be controlled from the wheelhouse or bridge. Smaller trawlers have wheelhouses, where electronic equipment for navigation, communications, fish detection and trawl sensors are typically arranged about the skipper&#x27;s chair. Larger vessels have a bridge, with a command console at the centre and a further co-pilot chair. Modern consoles display all the key information on an integrated display. Less frequently used sensors and monitors may be mounted on the deckhead.

Navigational instruments, such as an autopilot and GNSS, are used for manoeuvring the vessel in harbour and at sea. Radar can be used, for example, when pair trawling to keep the correct distance between the two vessels. Communication instruments range from basic radio devices to maritime distress systems and EPIRBs, as well as devices for communicating with the crew. Fish detection devices, such as echosounders and sonar, are used to locate fish.
During trawling operations, a range of trawl sensors may be used to assist with controlling and monitoring gear. These are often referred to as &quot;trawl monitoring systems&quot; or &quot;net mensuration systems&quot;.
* net sounders (trawl eyes) give information about the concentration of fish around the opening to the trawl, as well as the clearances around the opening and the bottom of the trawl
* catch sensors give information about the rate at which the cod end is filling.
* symmetry sensors give information about the optimal geometry of the trawls.
* tension sensors give information about how much tension is in the warps and sweeps.

===Fish storage and processing===
Modern trawlers store the fish they catch in some form of chilled condition. At the least, the fish will be stored in boxes covered with ice or stored with ice in the fish hold. In general, the fish are kept fresh by chilling them with ice or refrigerated sea water, or freezing them in blocks. Also, many trawlers carry out some measure of onboard fish processing, and the larger the vessel, the more likely it is to include fish processing facilities. For example, the catch can undergo some preliminary processing by being passed through sorting and washing devices. At a further stage, the fish might be mechanically gutted and filleted. Factory trawlers may process fish oil and fish meal and may include canning plants.
===Other design features===
Crew quarters are usually below the wheelhouse and may include bunks, with cot sides to stop the occupant from rolling out in heavy weather. The need for drying sea clothes is shown by a notice in at least one steam trawler&#x27;s boiler room saying &quot;Do not dry oil frocks over the boiler&quot;.
==Trawler types==
Trawlers can be classified by their architecture, the type of fish they catch, the fishing method used, or geographical origin. The classification used below follows the FAO, who classify trawlers by the gear they use.

===Outrigger trawlers===
Outrigger trawlers use outriggers, or booms, to tow the trawl. These outriggers are usually fastened to, or at the foot of the mast and extend out over the sides of the vessel during fishing operations. Each side can deploy a twin trawl or a single otter trawl. Outrigger trawlers may have the superstructure forward or aft. Warp winches with capstans are installed on the deck to haul the catch.
* Outrigger trawlers with a forward superstructure and aft working deck are widely used to target shrimp. The towing winch is usually located to the rear of the superstructure so warps from the drums feed to bollards on the cap rail, and then to towing blocks on the outriggers.
* Outrigger trawlers with aft superstructure and midship working deck are usually beam trawlers (see below). These use large beams to rig the trawls.

Outrigger trawlers use vertical fish finders of different kinds, according to their size. Drawing (FAO) 

===Beam trawlers===

Beam trawlers are a type of outrigger trawler (above), with the superstructure aft and the working deck amidships. They use a very strong outrigger boom on each side, each towing a beam trawl, with the warps going through blocks at the end of the boom. This arrangement makes it easier to stow and handle the large beams. The outriggers are controlled from a midship A-frame or mast. The towing winch is forward of the superstructure, with the towing warps passed through deck bollards and then out to the towing blocks on the booms.

Beam trawling is used in the flatfish fisheries in the North Sea. They are equipped with equipment for hauling the net and stowing it aboard. Typically an multibeam echosounder is used for finding fish.

They are medium-sized and high-powered vessels, towing gear at speeds up to 8 knots. To avoid the boat capsizing if the trawl snags on the sea floor, winch brakes can be installed, along with safety release systems in the boom stays. The engine power of bottom trawlers is restricted to 2000 HP (1472 kW) for further safety.

===Otter trawlers===
Otter trawlers deploy one or more parallel trawls kept apart horizontally using otter boards. These trawls can be towed in midwater or along the bottom. Otter trawlers range in size from sailing canoes to supertrawlers.

Otter trawlers usually have two gallows at the stern with towing blocks. The towing warps run through these, each regulated by its own winch. Medium and large trawlers usually have a stern ramp for hauling the trawl onto the deck. Some trawlers tow twin parallel trawls, using three warps, each warp with its own winch. Some otter trawlers are also outrigger trawlers (above), using outriggers to tow one or two otter trawls from each side.

Usually otter trawlers have the superstructure forward, though it can be aft or amidship. Gallows are on the stern quarters or there is a stern gantry for operating the otter boards. Pelagic trawlers can use fish pumps to empty the cod end.

===Pair trawlers===
Pair trawlers are trawlers which operate together towing a single trawl. They keep the trawl open horizontally by keeping their distance when towing. Otter boards are not used. Pair trawlers operate both midwater and bottom trawls.

The superstructure is forward or midships and the working deck aft. Pelagic trawlers can have fish pumps to empty the codend.

===Side trawlers===

Side trawlers have the trawl deployed over the side with the trawl warps passing through blocks suspended from a forward gallow and an aft gallow. Usually the superstructure is towards the stern, the fish hold amidships, and the transversal trawl winch forward of the superstructure. A derrick may be boom-rigged to the foremast to help shoot the cod end from the side. Until the late 1960s, side trawlers were the most common deepsea boat used in North Atlantic fisheries. The 1950s side trawler, &quot;Ross Tiger&quot; is preserved in Grimsby while the larger, 1960s distant water vessel, the &quot;Arctic Corsair&quot; is preserved in Hull. These trawlers were used for a longer period than other kinds of trawlers, but are now being replaced by stern trawlers. Some side trawlers still in use have been equipped with net drums.

===Stern trawlers===

Stern trawlers have trawls which are deployed and retrieved from the stern. Larger stern trawlers often have a ramp, though pelagic and small stern trawlers are often designed without a ramp. Stern trawlers are designed to operate in most weather conditions. They can work alone when midwater or bottom trawling, or two can work together as pair trawlers. The superstructure is forward with an aft working deck. At the stern are gallows or a gantry for operating otter boards. 

Any fish processing usually occurs in deck houses or below deck. A wet fish stern trawler stores the fish in ice or sea water which has been refrigerated. A freezer stern trawler stores the fish in frozen boxes or blocks, and a factory stern trawler processes the catch. A pelagic stern trawler may use fish pumps to empty the codend.

===Freezer trawlers===
The majority of trawlers operating on the high seas are freezer trawlers. They have facilities for preserving fish by freezing, allowing them to remain at sea for extended periods of time. They are medium- to large-size trawlers, with the same general arrangement as stern or side trawlers. Drawing (FAO) 

===Wet fish trawlers===

Wet fish trawlers are trawlers where the fish are kept in the hold in a fresh/wet condition, in boxes covered with ice or with ice in the fish hold. They must operate in areas close to their landing place, and the time such a vessel can spend fishing is limited. 

===Trawler/purse seiners===
Trawler/purse seiners are designed so the deck equipment, including an appropriate combination winch, can be rearranged and used for both methods. Blocks, purse davits, trawl gallows and rollers need to be arranged so they control the pursing lines and warp leads and in such a way as to reduce the time required to convert from one arrangement to the other. These vessels are usually classified as trawlers, since the power requirement for trawling is higher.
===Naval trawlers===

During both World Wars some countries created small warships by converting and arming existing trawlers or building new vessels to standard trawler designs. They were typically armed with a small naval gun and sometimes depth charges, and were used for patrolling, escorting other vessels and minesweeping.

==Safety==
Occupational safety is a concern on fishing trawlers. For example, a United States cooperative which operates a fleet of 24 bottom trawlers in Alaskan water reported 25 fatalities over the period 2001–2012. The risk of a fatal injury was 41 times higher than the average for workers in the United States.

<doc id="769877" wikidata="Q6070891" url="?curid=769877" title="William S. Richardson">
<text>William Shaw Richardson (December 22, 1919 – June 21, 2010) was an American attorney, political figure, and chief justice of the Hawaii State Supreme Court from 1966 to 1982. Prior to his service as the top jurist in Hawaii, Richardson was lieutenant governor under John A. Burns. Previous to that tenure from 1956 to 1962 he was chairman of the Democratic Party of Hawaii.

==Early years==
Richardson was born in Honolulu and was the son of Wilfred Kelelani Kānekoa Alapaʻi Richardson and Amy Lan Kyau Wung. He was of Chinese, Native Hawaiian, and Euro-American ancestry. His grandfather Colonel John Keone Likikine Richardson was a leading supporter of Queen Liliuokalani and the opposition to the overthrow of the Kingdom of Hawaii. Richardson referred to himself as &quot;just a local boy from Hawaii.&quot; He was a graduate of Roosevelt High School, University of Hawaiʻi at Mānoa, and University of Cincinnati College of Law. Richardson served in World War II with the 1st Filipino Infantry Regiment as a platoon leader with a rank of Captain in the U.S. Army. After returning to Hawaii, he continued his military service in the Judge Advocate General Corps.

==Political career==
Richardson was the Chief Clerk for the Senate of the Territory of Hawaii during the 1955 and 1957 terms. He chaired the Democratic Party of Hawaii from 1956 until 1962 and oversaw its transition from a territorial to a state party. Richardson attended the 1956 and 1960 Democratic National Conventions as a delegate representing Hawaii. In 1962, he successfully ran for Lieutenant Governor of Hawaii as a Democrat. In March 1966, Governor John A. Burns nominated Richardson as the 16th Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of Hawaii. The Senate confirmed him, and Richardson served as the chief justice from 1966 until 1982.

==Tenure as Chief Justice ==
Richardson&#x27;s tenure as chief justice of the Supreme Court of Hawaii was marked by landmark decisions that recognized the precedent of the state&#x27;s unique cultural and legal history; specifically the public&#x27;s interests in the environment, and the rights of the indigenous Hawaiian people. Under Richardson, the court held that the public&#x27;s interest in the natural environment may limit or prohibit commercial development of sensitive areas, particularly coastlines and beaches; that the public has the right to access Hawaii&#x27;s beaches, and that land created by lava flows belonged to the state, not to nearby property owners. Richardson declared, &quot;The western concept of exclusivity is not universally applicable in Hawaii.&quot; When two sugarcane plantations each sought the right to a water source, Richardson cited precedent from the court of the Kingdom of Hawai&#x27;i, and declared that the water belonged to neither of them, but to the state. The Richardson court recognized previously ignored claims of the indigenous Hawaiian people.

==Kamehameha Schools Bishop Estate==
After retiring from the Chief Justice position, the Hawaii State Supreme Court appointed Richardson as a trustee of the Kamehameha Schools Bishop Estate, a position he held from 1983 until 1992.

==Legacy==
Before his retirement from the bar, Richardson was honored with the naming of the state&#x27;s only law school in his honor. The William S. Richardson School of Law was his crowning achievement, as he fought for its establishment for decades. Richardson, who is fondly referred to as &quot;CJ&quot; (for Chief Justice), was still involved with the development of the law school and regularly attended school functions up until his death in June 2010.

<text>This is a list of indigenous languages that are or were spoken in the present territory of Argentina.

Although the official language of Argentina is Spanish, several Indigenous languages are in use. Most are spoken only within their respective indigenous communities, some with very few remaining speakers. Others, especially Aymara, Quechua (South Bolivian Quechua and Santiago del Estero Quichua), Toba (Qom) and Guaraní (Western Argentine Guaraní, Paraguayan Guaraní, Mbyá Guaraní), are alive and in common use in specific regions. Finally, some such as Abipón and Yaghan, are now completely extinct. Since 2004 the Guaraní language is official, together with Spanish, in the northeastern Corrientes Province.

== Extinct languages ==

A large number of languages once spoken in Argentina have disappeared. According to Censabella (1999), two thirds of the languages spoken when the Spaniards arrived became extinct. In some cases, the languages disappeared along with the ethnic groups that spoke them; in other, the acculturation and transculturation phenomena associated with deep changes in the living conditions of the indigenous peoples caused the extinction, even if a number of individuals of the ethnical group still survive.

* Abipón, from the Guaykuruan family, somewhat related to Kadiwéu of Brazil. No living speakers of this language are known.
* Cacán, spoken by peoples known as Diaguitas and Calchaquíes, in northwestern Argentina. Extinct since the mid-17th century or beginning of 18th century. Its genetic classification remains unsolved. The language was supposedly documented by the Jesuit Alonso de Bárcena, but the manuscript is lost.
* Chané, from the Arawakan family. It has been sometimes compared with Guana or Kashika language of Paraguay, and also with the Terena of Brazil, but both are different. Chané was spoken about 300 years ago in the north-east of Salta Province; the ethnical group, now called Izoceño, became subject as vassals to the Avá Guaraní people, and the language was lost. All surviving Chané individuals speak Western Guaraní.
* Güenoa (or &quot;Wenoa&quot;) and Chaná languages, of Charrúan stock, were spoken in today&#x27;s central-eastern Argentina and Uruguay. Charruan languages became extinct by the beginning of the 19th century west of Uruguay River, and around 1830 in the eastern shores of the same river.
* Kunza (also &quot;Cunza&quot;, &quot;Likanantaí&quot;, &quot;Lipe&quot;, &quot;Ulipe&quot; or &quot;Atacameño&quot;), probably an isolated language, was spoken in northwestern Argentina, northeastern Chile and Bolivia, in and around the region of Atacama up to Bolivian Salar de Uyuni by the Lickan-amtay (&quot;Atacameño&quot;) people. It is almost certainly extinct in Chile too.
* Henia-Camiare or &quot;Hênia-Kamiare&quot;, sometimes considered as two different languages, was spoken by the ethnic group of the same name, known by Spaniards as &quot;comechingones&quot;. The extant elements of this language (some toponyms and plant names) are not enough to establish its genetic relationships, nor to attempt a reconstruction.
* Het was the language spoken by the original dwellers of the Pampas, known as &quot;Pampas&quot; or &quot;Querandíes&quot;, before they became intermixed with peoples of Mapuche origin and progressively switched to Mapudungun. Its very existence as a unique language (by opposition to a group) is merely speculative.
* Allentiac or &quot;Alyentiyak&quot; and Millcayac or &quot;Milykayak&quot; languages belonged to the Huarpe or &quot;Warpe&quot; family and were spoken in the Cuyo region in central-western Argentina. The scarcity of remaining elements prevents accurate classification or reconstruction.
* Lule, supposed to be part of the Lule–Vilela family, was spoken by peoples living in today&#x27;s Salta Tucumán and Santiago del Estero provinces. Only a few toponyms and names remain, but their precise meaning is often obscure. However, the language is fairly well documented in a vocabulary and grammar composed by the Jesuit Antonio Machoni in 1732.
* Tonocoté, sometimes confused with Lule, was spoken by a settled people dwelling in western and central regions of today&#x27;s Santiago del Estero Province. There is some speculation among scholars about the possible Arawakan origin of that ethnic group, while other sources state that they were switching to Quechua in the 16th century. No evidence of the language has survived.
* Yaghan, &quot;Yámana&quot;, &quot;Háusi-Kúta&quot; or &quot;Yagán&quot; is a language spoken by indigenous peoples of southern shores and islands of Tierra del Fuego. A very analytical language, it had an extensive vocabulary. In Argentina Yaghan became extinct at the beginning of the 20th century, but lexicons and early recordings remain. It is recognised in a number of well known toponyms as Ushuaia, Lapataia, Tolhuin, etc. Some elder speakers (between 1 and 5) remain in Chile, where the language is nearly extinct.
* Ona
* Puelche
* Tehuelche language
* Vilela language

Other extinct languages are known just by the ethnic group that spoke them, since very scarce (if any) linguistic material remains. Among them: Omaguaca; Sanavirón; several languages probably belonging to the Guaycurú family but known by their Guaraní ethnonyms as Mbayá, Payaguá, Minuané, Mbeguá, Timbú, Corondá, Quiloazá and Colastiné; and others related to the Chon stock, as Manek&#x27;enk and Teushen.

<doc id="769883" wikidata="Q356728" url="?curid=769883" title="Joseph Arthur Ankrah">
<text>Joseph Arthur Ankrah (18 August 1915 – 25 November 1992) was a Ghanaian army general who was the second head of state of Ghana from 1966 to 1969 as chairman of the National Liberation Council. He was Ghana&#x27;s first military head of state. Ankrah also served as the fourth chairperson of the Organisation of African Unity from 24 February 1966 to 5 November 1966. Previously, Ankrah was appointed the first commander of the Ghana Army in 1961.

==Early life==
Joseph Arthur Ankrah was born on 18 August 1915 in Accra to the Ga family of Samuel Paul Cofie Ankrah, an overseer for the Christian Missionary Society and Beatrice Abashie Quaynor, a trader. 
Ankrah began his schooling in 1921 at the Wesleyan Methodist School in Accra, where he was nicknamed &#x27;Ankrah Patapaa&#x27; for his &quot;forcefulness in arguments and always playing leadership role among his mates&quot;. In 1932, he entered Accra Academy, where he established himself as a good football player. He obtained the Senior Cambridge School Certificate in 1937. He then joined the Ghana Civil Service.

==Military career==
Ankrah joined the Gold Coast Regiment in 1939. On the outbreak of World War II, Ankrah was mobilized into the Royal West African Frontier Force. While his Brigade was in East Africa in 1940, he was transferred to the Record Office in Accra with the rank of Warrant Officer Class II and made second-in-command. In October 1946, he went to the Marshfield Officer Cadets Training Unit in the United Kingdom and graduated in February 1947 as the first African officer in the Gold Coast Army. He was commissioned a lieutenant in 1947 and became the first African camp commandant at the Army Headquarters. He was later made the first Ghanaian Chief Instructor of the Education Unit. He was promoted Major in 1956 and became the first African to command an all-African company, the Charlie Company of the First Battalion at Tamale, Ghana. He later became Lieutenant Colonel and took over the whole battalion. He rose to the rank of colonel by 1960, at a time when there were few Ghanaian officers at that level. During the United Nations Operation in the Congo, he was the Brigade Commander of the force-based at Luluabourg, Kasai in the present-day Democratic Republic of Congo. He was the only Ghanaian awarded the Military Cross in Leopoldville for acts of unsurpassed gallantry in Congo in 1961. The citation read:

With great common sense, maturity and tact, this officer handled a delicate situation which otherwise would have created grave consequences in Leopoldville and many parts of the Congo. Colonel Ankrah, with complete disregard for his own life, disarmed an Armée Nationale Congolaise (ANC) soldier who, with a loaded sten machine carbine, attempted to shoot Mr. Lumumba. He carried the Prime Minister to safety in a vehicle which was fired on by ANC ambushers. Had it not been for the quick and bold action of Colonel Ankrah at the risk of his life, Mr. Lumumba&#x27;s life would have been taken with untold consequences at that time.

After his experience in the Congo, he was promoted Brigadier then Major General becoming the first Ghanaian commander of the Ghana army in 1961 and then Deputy Chief of Defence Staff. He was dismissed from the Ghana army in July 1965 on suspicion of involvement in a coup plot.

==Politics==
Ankrah became the head of the National Investment Bank after leaving the army. However, he became the Head of state and Chairman of the National Liberation Council after the 24 February 1966 coup. In January 1967, he mediated between the warring factions of the Nigerian Civil War in Biafra.
He was forced to resign as Chairman of the NLC and Head of State over a bribery scandal involving a Nigerian businessman.

==Sports==
Ankrah served as the first ever President of the Council of Patrons of Accra Hearts of Oak S.C. and steered the football club for a long period.

==Family==
In 1965 he married his third wife, Mildred Christina Akosiwor Fugar (12 June 1938 – 9 June 2005), in Accra. His son also went to Accra Academy. He had a daughter called Jackie Ankrah who is a broadcaster, songwriter and musician. He had several wives and 18 children.

<doc id="769884" wikidata="Q1068204" url="?curid=769884" title="Chatham Dockyard">
<text>Chatham Dockyard was a Royal Navy Dockyard located on the River Medway in Kent. Established in Chatham in the mid-16th century, the dockyard subsequently expanded into neighbouring Gillingham; at its most extensive (in the early 20th century) two-thirds of the dockyard lay in Gillingham, one-third in Chatham.

It came into existence at the time when, following the Reformation, relations with the Catholic countries of Europe had worsened, leading to a requirement for additional defences. Over 414 years Chatham Royal Dockyard provided more than 500 ships for the Royal Navy, and was at the forefront of shipbuilding, industrial and architectural technology. At its height, it employed over 10,000 skilled artisans and covered . Chatham dockyard closed in 1984, and of the Georgian dockyard is now managed as the Chatham Historic Dockyard visitor attraction by the Chatham Historic Dockyard Trust.

==Overview==
Joseph Farington (1747–1821) was commissioned by the Navy Board to paint a panoramic view of Chatham Dockyard (as part of a project to create a visual record of all six home yards) in 1785. The painting, now in the National Maritime Museum, provides a detailed illustration of the yard as it was in the Age of Sail; many of the buildings and structures illustrated survive:

&lt;br&gt;
===Descriptions of the working dockyard===
William Camden (1551–1623) described Chatham dockyard as
...stored for the finest fleet the sun ever beheld, and ready at a minute’s warning, built lately by our most gracious sovereign Elizabeth at great expense for the security of her subjects and the terror of her enemies, with a fort on the shore for its defence.
Daniel Defoe (c. 1660 – 1731), visiting the yard in 1705, also spoke of its achievements with an almost incredulous enthusiasm:
So great is the order and application there, that a first-rate vessel of war of 106 guns, ordered to be commissioned by Sir Cloudesley Shovell, was ready in three days. At the time the order was given the vessel was entirely unrigged; yet the masts were raised, sails bent, anchors and cables on board, in that time&quot;.

Charles Dickens (1812–1870), who had grown up in Chatham, returned in later life and described in 1861 the novel sight (and sounds) of a ship being built for the first time of iron (rather than wood):
Twelve hundred men are working at her now; twelve hundred men working on stages over her sides, over her bows, over her sterns, under her keel, between her decks, down in her hold, within her and without, crawling and creeping into the finest curves of her lines wherever it is possible for men to twist. Twelve hundred hammerers, measurers, caulkers, armourers, forgers, smiths, shipwrights; twelve hundred dingers, clashers, dongers, rattlers, clinkers, bangers, bangers, bangers!

==History==
===Gillingham Water===
Chatham&#x27;s establishment as a naval dockyard was precipitated by the use of the Medway as a safe anchorage by the ships of what became (under King Henry VIII) England&#x27;s permanent Royal Navy. In 1550, a decree was issued to the Lord High Admiral that:
all the Kinges shippes should be harborowed in Jillyngham Water – saving only those that be at Portsmouth

Even prior to this, there is evidence of certain shore facilities being established in the vicinity for the benefit of the King&#x27;s ships at anchor: there are isolated references from as early as 1509 to the hiring of a storehouse nearby and from 1547 this becomes a fixed item in the Treasurer&#x27;s annual accounts. (At around the same time a victualling store was also established, in nearby Rochester, to provide the ships and their crews with food.) The storehouse would have furnished ships with such necessary consumables as rope, pulleys, sailcloth and timber. Careening took place on the river, according to a Privy Council instruction of 1550; for more specialised repairs and maintenance, however, ships would have had to travel to one of the purpose-built royal dockyards (the nearest being those on the Thames: Deptford and Woolwich).

===The early dockyard===
1567 is generally seen as the date of Chatham&#x27;s establishment as a Royal Naval Dockyard. In the years that followed the ground was prepared, accommodation was secured and in 1570 a mast pond was installed. The following year a forge was built for anchor-making. At around the same time a large house was leased (the Hill House) for administrative purposes including meetings of the Council of Marine Causes. (Hill House would serve as the dockyard&#x27;s Pay Office for the next 180 years; the Royal Marine Barracks were later built on its site).

The renowned Tudor shipwright Mathew Baker was appointed to Chatham in 1572 (though he was primarily based at Deptford). Under his supervision the site was developed to include sawpits, workshops, storehouses and a wharf with a treadmill crane (completed in 1580). Most significantly, Chatham&#x27;s first dry dock was opened in 1581 (for repairing naval galleys). The first ship to be built at the dockyard, a 10-gun pinnace named HMS &quot;Merlin&quot; (or &quot;Merlyon&quot;), was launched in 1579.

The dockyard received its first royal visit, from Elizabeth I, in 1573; later, in 1606, James I used Chatham dockyard for a meeting with Christian IV of Denmark.

===Relocation===

In the early 17th century the government resolved to invest in a new specialised facility for refitting and repairing warships. By 1611 Chatham had been chosen as its location (in preference to Deptford, which at the time was the nation&#x27;s principal naval shipbuilding yard; this led to speculation that Deptford was going to be sold off). The decision established Chatham as the country&#x27;s premier naval industrial complex; nevertheless, concerns were already being raised over its river being prone to silting.

The decision required the dockyard to move from its original location, which was too constricted, to a new (adjacent) site to the north. (The old site was in due course transferred to the Ordnance Board, who established the gun wharf there.) By 1619, the new dockyard consisted of a new dry dock and wharf with storehouses, all enclosed within a brick perimeter wall. The growing importance of the dockyard was illustrated with the addition soon afterwards of a mast pond, and the granting of additional land on which a second (double) dry dock was constructed, along with a sail loft, a ropery and residences for the dockyard officers: all of which were completed by 1624.

Peter Pett, of the family of shipwrights whose history is closely connected to the Chatham dockyard, became commissioner in 1649. In 1686 two new dry docks were built, in addition to the old single and double dry docks; all four were rebuilt and expanded at various points in subsequent centuries (the double dock having been converted into a single dock in 1703). Although the yard focused mainly on refitting and repairs, some shipbuilding continued to take place. It made do with a single shipbuilding slip for much of the 17th century (a second slip, dating from the same period, had fallen out of use; it was replaced in the 1730s). Also in 1686 a &#x27;Great Long Store-house&#x27; was built, alongside the ropery on what is now Anchor Wharf; and two new mast ponds were constructed, in what was then the northernmost part of the yard, in 1697 and 1702.

====Sheerness====

One of the disadvantages of Chatham (and also of the Thames-side yards) was their relative inaccessibility for ships at sea (including those anchored in The Nore). Therefore, rather than risk being constrained by wind, tide and draught on a journey upriver, ships would seek as often as possible to do running repairs and maintenance while at anchor, and would only travel to the dockyard when necessary. Thus deliveries of victuals, ordnance and other supplies were made by small boats, sailing regularly between Chatham and The Nore.

Seeking to alleviate this less-than-satisfactory situation, the Navy Board explored options for developing a shore facility with direct access from the open water of the Thames Estuary. The escalating Anglo-Dutch wars forced their hand, however: several temporary buildings were hastily erected in Sheerness, at the mouth of the Medway, to enable ships to re-arm, re-victual and (if necessary) be repaired as quickly as possible. In 1665, the Navy Board approved Sheerness as a site for a new dockyard, and building work began; but in 1667 the still-incomplete Sheerness Dockyard was captured by the Dutch Navy and used as the base for an attack on the English fleet at anchor in the Medway itself. Sheerness remained operational as a royal dockyard until 1959, but it was never considered a major shore establishment and in several respects it operated as a subsidiary yard to Chatham.

===Consolidation===
By the late 17th century a number of prestigious new buildings were erected (including the officers&#x27; residences, the clocktower storehouse and the main gatehouse), several of which are still in place. At the same time, the nearby village of Brompton began to be developed to provide housing for the dockyard&#x27;s growing workforce.

From the very start of the 18th century, however, Chatham began to be superseded in both size and importance, first by Portsmouth, then Plymouth, when the main naval enemy became France, and the Western approaches the chief theatre of operations. In addition, the Medway had begun to silt up, making navigation more difficult (especially as the Navy&#x27;s ships were getting larger). As a result, it was acknowledged by 1771 that Chatham had no future as a front-line fleet base; nevertheless, following a visit by the Admiralty Board in 1773, the decision was taken to invest further in Chatham, and to develop it as a building yard rather than a refitting base.

&lt;br&gt;

&lt;br&gt;

By this time the establishment, including the gun wharf, stretched in length, and included an area of in excess of . Alongside the four dry docks it now had a total of six shipbuilding slips (equalling Deptford and outnumbering the other yards in this regard), albeit three of the six were under in length and suitable only for building smaller warships. The docks varied from to in length. The officers and men employed in the yard had also increased, and by 1798 they numbered 1,664, including 49 officers and clerks and 624 shipwrights. Additionally required were the blockmakers, caulkers, pitch-heaters, blacksmiths, joiners and carpenters, sail makers, riggers, and ropemakers (274), as well as bricklayers, labourers and others. Building works at Chatham did not compare with the substantial expansions underway at Portsmouth and Plymouth at this time; but the southern part of the yard was significantly redeveloped, with construction of two new storehouses on Anchor Wharf and a major reconfiguration of the ropery.

Among the vessels built in this Dockyard which still exist are (launched in 1765 and now preserved at Portsmouth Historic Dockyard) and (a ), launched in 1824 and now preserved afloat at Dundee).

===Mechanisation===

Following the appointment of Robert Seppings as Master Shipwright in 1804, iron began to be introduced into the structure of ships being built at Chatham; the following year work began on a new, much larger smithery, commissioned by Samuel Bentham, designed by Edward Holl and fitted out by John Rennie. Among other things, the use of iron in ship construction enabled larger vessels to be built, and between 1836 and 1851 Chatham gained five new covered slipways, much larger in scale than the ones they replaced. (The covering of Chatham&#x27;s slipways and dry docks, to protect the woodwork of ships as they were built or repaired, had begun with No.2 Slip and No.1 Dock in 1817).

In 1811, Marc Brunel recommended the installation of steam-powered sawmills in the royal dockyards, to replace the manual labour of the saw pits. Money was only made available for one such installation, however, and Chatham (as the principal building yard at this time) was chosen as its location. Land was purchased to the northeast for its construction, and the new saw mill began operation in 1814. The following year, John Rennie was engaged to build an entirely new dry dock (following his own recommendations) which was the first in the dockyard to be built entirely of stone; it was built on the site of the old smithery. Unlike the earlier timber docks, which were drained using gravity, this new dock (No.3 Dock) was pumped dry using a Boulton &amp; Watt steam engine. After completion of the new dock in 1821, reconstruction of the other docks in stone followed (with the exception of the northernmost, which was converted into a slipway); they were likewise emptied using steam power, provided by the same engine and pumps (which were also linked to a network of pipes installed across the whole dockyard site for firefighting purposes). Another novel application of steam power was embarked on in 1817, with the building of a &#x27;Lead and Paint Mill&#x27;, in which a single beam engine powered a rolling mill and a series of devices for grinding pigment and mixing paint; the plant was operational from 1819. It was not until 1837, however, that steam power was first introduced into the ropery, and the smithery received its first engine (for blowing the forges and powering tilt hammers) in 1841.
At the same time, moves were being made towards the application of steam power to ship propulsion. The first steam-powered ship to be laid down at Chatham was HMS &quot;Phoenix&quot;, one of four paddle steamers built concurrently across the royal dockyards in the early 1830s, each designed by a different leading shipwright. HMS &quot;Bee&quot;, launched at Chatham in 1842, was an experimental vessel fitted with both paddles and a propeller, each of which could be driven independently from the same engine for comparison. Following the success of such early trials with screw propulsion, several older sailing ships were taken into dry dock and retro-fitted with propellers, beginning with HMS &quot;Horatio&quot;. Another hint of changes to come was seen in the launch of HMS &quot;Aetna&quot;, the first armour-plated vessel to be built at Chatham, in 1856. All these developments were to come together with the construction of HMS &quot;Achilles&quot;, in a newly expanded No.2 Dock, between 1860 and 1864: the first true iron-hulled battleship to be launched in a royal dockyard.

To meet the new demands of building in iron, metal mills were built alongside the smithery in 1845, containing rolling machinery and furnaces for reprocessing iron. Holl&#x27;s smithery was itself enlarged with the addition of a foundry in the 1850s, and its courtyard was roofed over for a steam hammer shop in 1865. By 1861, No.1 Dock had been filled in and a machine shop constructed in its place for heating, bending and planing armour plate for HMS &quot;Achilles&quot; which was being built alongside. For the time being, however, marine steam engines were not manufactured on site but were ordered from Thames-based private contractors (along with other associated equipment). In 1860 the dockyard&#x27;s policing was also transferred to the new No.4 Division of the Metropolitan Police, which remained in that role until 1932.

===Expansion===

A significant disadvantage for Chatham was that fitting out had always taken place on the river. When &quot;Achilles&quot;, for example, had been completed and floated out of dry dock, she spent almost a year moored in Gillingham Reach, where not only her engines, boilers, funnels and a propeller were fitted, but also masts, sails, rigging, guns, coal, food, ammunition and furnishings were either loaded or installed. It was partly to address this problem that the Admiralty undertook a huge building programme at Chatham. Between 1862 and 1865, the size of the yard quadrupled and provided specialist facilities for steam-powered ships with metal hulls. Three basins were constructed along St. Mary&#x27;s creek, from west to east: No.1 Basin (of ), No.2 Basin () and No.3 Basin (). Along the southern edge of No.1 Basin four new dry docks were built (Nos.5–8), each long. Initially a purpose-built &#x27;steam factory&#x27; was planned, but following the closure of Woolwich Dockyard in 1869 a number of slip covers were removed from that site and re-erected at the head of the new dry docks to serve as factories for building and fitting engines and for boilermaking.
No.1 Basin was officially opened in 1871, with HMS &quot;Invincible&quot; being brought into No.5 Dock for repairs, with great ceremony. Work on the other docks and basins followed, with No.3 Basin finally being completed in 1883. Two years later the project was largely complete, with facilities provided alongside for gun mounting and mast rigging, as well as a victualling depot and a coaling area. Much of the excavation and building work had been done by convict labour (a convict prison having been built to the north of the dockyard, with the expansion project in mind, in 1853). In 1897 a naval barracks was built on the site of the prison to provide crew accommodation for ships anchored in The Nore; for the next sixty years it served as the headquarters of Nore Command, whose Commander-in-Chief was accommodated in the adjacent Admiralty House.
In 1897 a new, even longer dry dock was opened on the north side of No.1 Basin: at its opening, this (No.9 Dock) was the largest in the world at long by wide. At around the same time, in the older part of the dockyard, No.7 Slip was extended to accommodate the building of HMS &quot;Prince of Wales&quot; (launched in 1902), and a new (uncovered) slipway was built a little to the north (No.8 Slip, completed in 1900); at this was one of the longest slips in the world and was designed for building battleships. (The older slipways, by contrast, were proving much too small and they were mostly filled in around this time, their covered areas being put to alternative uses.) The first battleship to be built on the new No.8 Slip was HMS &quot;Africa&quot;, launched in 1905; however it also proved to be the last, as it was announced (controversially) that Chatham Dockyard would be unable to accommodate Dreadnoughts. Proposals were made for a fourth Basin of , together with additional large docks of up to , to cover the remaining land on St Mary&#x27;s Island; but these were soon superseded by plans to build an entirely new dockyard at Rosyth.

Nevertheless, Light cruisers and other smaller vessels continued to be built at Chatham during the first half of the 20th century. Also with the 20th century came the submarine. The first submarine to be built at a royal dockyard was , launched from the covered No.7 Slip in 1908 and then fitted out in No.2 Dock; five more of the same class followed, C18, C19, C20, C33 and C34. During World War I, twelve submarines were built here, but when hostilities ceased, uncompleted boats were scrapped and five years passed before a further ship was launched. In the interwar years, eight S-class submarines as well as X1 were built at Chatham but this was a period of decline.
Production ramped up during World War II with HMS&#x27;s &quot;Umpire&quot;, &quot;Una&quot;, &quot;Splendid&quot;, &quot;Sportsman&quot;, &quot;Shalimar&quot;, &quot;Tradewind&quot;, &quot;Trenchant&quot;, &quot;Turpin&quot;, &quot;Thermopylae&quot; and &quot;Acheron&quot; being constructed.

===Last years===

In February 1958 it was announced in Parliament that Sheerness Dockyard would close in 1960, with Nore Command (and its Chatham-based Commander-in-Chief) to be abolished the following year. At the same time, it was made clear that at Chatham &quot;the dockyard will be retained; but the barracks and other naval establishments will be closed&quot;. (In the event, the barracks were reprieved and repurposed rather than being closed at this stage.)
The final boats constructed in Chatham were s – was the last vessel built for the Royal Navy, and the final vessel was built for the Royal Canadian Navy and launched on 17 September 1966. In 1968, a nuclear submarine refitting complex was built between Nos 6 and 7 dry docks, complete with refuelling cranes and health physics building. In spite of this in June 1981, it was announced to Parliament that the dockyard would be run down and closed in 1984.

====Closure====
The closure of Chatham Dockyard (along with the adjacent Naval Barracks) was announced in Parliament in June 1981 and scheduled to take place in 1984. Redundancy notices were served, but then abruptly withdrawn following the 1982 invasion of the Falkland Islands; the dockyard was heavily involved in preparing ships for the South Atlantic, and in repairing damaged vessels on their return. Nonetheless, the dockyard closed, as planned, on 31 March 1984.

===Regeneration===
At the time of its closure the dockyard covered . Thereafter this was divided into three sections:
, the 18th century core of the site, was transferred to a charity called the Chatham Historic Dockyard Trust. The Georgian site is now a visitor attraction under the care of the Trust: Chatham Historic Dockyard. The Trust is preparing an application for the dockyard and its defences to become a World Heritage Site.
The easternmost basin (Basin No.3) was handed over to the Medway Ports authority and is now a commercial port (Chatham Docks). It includes Papersafe UK and Nordic Recycling Ltd. In 2013 Peel Ports, which owns and runs Chatham Docks, announced that it was set to convert a portion of the commercial port into a mixed-use development (incorporating offices, an education facility, apartments, town houses and a food store (Asda), as well as landscaped public areas). The development is called &quot;Chatham Waters&quot;. In 2019 Peel announced that Chatham Docks would close in 2025 with the loss of 800 jobs.

The remaining were transferred to the government&#x27;s urban regeneration agency (later English Partnerships). Under its remit, the westernmost (No.1) Basin was turned into a marina, part of the former factory area to the south was transformed into an entertainment and retail complex (&#x27;Chatham Maritime&#x27;) and the former Barracks (HMS &quot;Pembroke&quot;) became Universities at Medway. St Mary&#x27;s Island, a , largely undeveloped area to the north of the three basins, was transformed into a residential community for some 1,500 homes. It has several themed areas with traditional maritime buildings, a fishing (though in looks only) village with its multi-coloured houses and a modern energy-efficient concept. Many homes have views of the River Medway. A primary school (St. Mary&#x27;s C of E) and a medical centre provide facilities for the residents and there are attractive walks around the Island.

====Filming====
Chatham Dockyard has become a popular location for filming, due to its varied and interesting areas such as the cobbled streets, church and over 100 buildings dating from the Georgian and Victorian periods. Productions that have chosen to film at Chatham Dockyard include: &quot;Les Misérables&quot;, &quot;Call the Midwife&quot;, &quot;Mr Selfridge&quot;, &quot;Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows&quot;, &quot;Oliver Twist&quot;, &quot;The World Is Not Enough&quot; and &quot;Grantchester&quot;.

==Detailed descriptions==
===Significant buildings within the Georgian Dockyard===
====Wood and canvas====
* The Mast Ponds. 1697, 1702. Fir logs were seasoned by immersing them in salt water while the sap died back.
** South Mast Pond, 1697. Now a car park.
** North Mast Pond, 1702. The ponds were connected by canal.
* Clocktower building 1723. The oldest surviving naval storehouse in any Royal Dockyard. The building functioned as a &quot;present use store&quot; except for the upper floor, which was a mould loft, and six bays at the northern end of the ground floor, which were open and contained saw pits. The upper floors had timber cladding until 1802 when it was replaced by brick. In the 20th century the building was used for offices; it was adapted in 1996–1997 to become the University of Kent&#x27;s Bridge Warden&#x27;s College.
* Sail and Colour Loft 1723. Constructed from timber recycled from warships probably from the Dutch Wars. Lower floors were for storage, and the upper floor is a large open space for sail construction. In 1758 there were 45 sailmakers. They sewed strips of canvas into the sails using 170–190 stitches per yard (5 stitches per inch), remembering that there would be two rows of stitching to each seam. Flags denoting nationality and for signals were made here. The flags used by Nelson in his &quot;England expects...&quot; message would have been made here. Flag-making continued here, even after the closure of the dockyard, until 2001.
* House Carpenter&#x27;s Workshop House carpenters and joiners were responsible for the fittings and furnishings of warships, and also for building and maintaining various structures within the dockyard itself. The small courtyard to the west contained workshops.
* Masthouses and Mouldloft 1753–1755. Grade I listed since August 1999. These were used to make and store masts. Here there are seven interlinking masthouses; they were originally connected to the adjacent South Mast Pond by a wide slipway. Above them is the mould loft where the lines of were laid down: the lines of each frame of a ship would be taken from the plan and scribed, full size, into the floor by shipwrights; from this, patterns or moulds would be built using softwoods, and from these the actual frames would be built and shaped. This building houses the &quot;Wooden Walls Exhibition&quot;.
* Timber Seasoning Sheds 1774. These were built to a standard design with bays . These are the first standardised industrial buildings. There were 75 bays erected at Chatham Dockyard, to hold three years worth of timber.
* Wheelwrights&#x27; shop circa 1780. This three bay building was originally built as a mast house using timber &quot;reclaimed&quot; from dismantled ships. The east bay was used by the wheelwrights, who constructed and repaired the wheels on the dockyard carts, and may have made ships&#x27; wheels. The middle bay was used by the pump makers and the coak and treenail makers. Pumps were simple affairs, made of wood with iron and leather fittings. Coaks were the bearings in pulley blocks, and treenails were the long oak pins, made on a lathe (or &#x27;moot&#x27;), that were used to pin the planking to the frames. The west bay was used by the capstan makers, capstans were used to raise the anchor. Since 2017 this building has been linked to the Masthouses and Mouldloft (qv) by a new entrance building for Chatham Historic Dockyard.
* Joiners&#x27; Shop originally to make treenails, but later used by the yards joiners. The &quot;Resolute&quot; Desk (the Oval Office desk) was constructed here by Dockyard Joiners from the timbers of .
* Brunel Saw Mill 1814. Until 1814 timber was cut by pairs of men, one above and one below the log. In 1758, there were 43 pairs of working in the yard. In 1812, the sawmill was designed by Marc Brunel, father of Isambard Kingdom Brunel. The mill was driven by steam. The mill was linked to the mast ponds by a mechanical timber transport system, and underground canals. Later the basement was converted into a steam laundry.
* Lower Boat House circa 1820 built as a storehouse for squared timber, and later to store ship&#x27;s boats.

====Dry docks and covered slips====
* The covered slips 1838–1855. It was on slipways that ships were built. The slipways were covered, to prevent ships rotting before they had been launched. The earliest covered slips no longer exist (Nos 1 and 2 Slips, which stood either side of the Assistant Queen&#x27;s Harbourmaster&#x27;s Office, were given wooden covers in 1817). By 1838 the use of cast and wrought iron in buildings had become feasible. Of those that survive, the oldest slip has a wooden roof, three have cast iron roofing and the latest uses wrought iron; together, they are of unique importance in showing the development of wide span structures such as were later used by the railways.
** No 3 Slip 1838. This had a linked timber roof truss structure and was originally covered in tarred paper, which was quickly replaced with a zinc roof. The slip was backfilled around 1900 and a steel mezzanine floor was added. It became a store house for ship&#x27;s boats.
** No 4, 5 and 6 Slips 1848. These were designed by Captain Thomas Mould, Royal Engineers, and erected by Bakers and Sons of Lambeth. Similar structures were erected at Portsmouth but these are no longer extant. They predate the London train sheds of Paddington and King&#x27;s Cross which were often cited as the country&#x27;s first wide span metal structures.
** No 7 Slip is one of the earliest examples of a modern metal trussed roof. It was designed in 1852 by Colonel Godfrey T. Green, Royal Engineers. It was used for shipbuilding until 1966; was launched from there on 5 May 1962.
* Dry Dock. The docks are filled by sluice gates set into the caissons, and emptied by a series of underground culverts connected to the pumping station. No 1 Dry Dock 1824 (built on the site of &quot;The Old Double Dock&quot;) no longer exists; it was filled in and converted into a covered workshop (No 1 Machine Shop) prior to the pioneering construction of in the adjacent No 2 Dock.
** No 2 Dry Dock 1856 was built on the site of &quot;The Old Single Dock&quot; where HMS &quot;Victory&quot; was constructed. In 1863, this dock constructed , the first iron battleship to be built in a Royal Dockyard. It now houses .
** No 3 Dry Dock 1820, the first to be constructed of stone, was designed by John Rennie. It now houses HMS &quot;Ocelot&quot;.
** No 4 Dry Dock 1840 was built on the site of one of a parallel pair of docks built in 1686 (the second of which was converted into the adjacent slipway, No. 3 Slip). It now houses .
* South Dock Pumping Station 1822, designed by John Rennie. It originally housed a beam engine, which was replaced by an electric pump in 1920. The building is still in use.

====Offices and residential====
* Commissioner&#x27;s House 1704. This is the oldest surviving naval building in England. It is Grade I listed. It was built for the Resident Commissioner, his family and servants. The previous building was built in 1640 for Phineas Pett. In 1703, Captain George St Lo took up the post and petitioned the Admiralty for a more suitable residence. Internally the principal feature is the main staircase with its painted wooden ceiling attributed to Thomas Highmore (Serjeant Painter), to sketches by Sir James Thornhill.
* Commissioner&#x27;s Garden dating from 1640. The lower terraces are one of the first Italianate Water Gardens in England. There is a 400-year-old mulberry tree, from where Oliver Cromwell reputedly watched the Roundhead Army take Rochester from the Royalists. There is an 18th-century icehouse and an Edwardian conservatory with its great vine.
* Officers&#x27; Terrace 1722–23. Twelve houses built for senior officers in the Dockyard. The ground floor were built as offices, the first floor contained reception rooms with bedrooms above. Each has an 18th-century walled garden, which again are now very rare. They are now privately owned.
* House Carpenters&#x27; Shop . Built to harmonise with the officers&#x27; terrace. House Carpenters worked solely on maintaining the dockyard buildings.
* Stables. For officers&#x27; horses.
* Main gatehouse 1722, designed by the master shipwright in the style of John Vanbrugh. It bears the arms of George III. Inside the gateway stands the &quot;muster bell&quot; on a wrought iron mast dating from the late 18th or early 19th century; it is Grade II* listed.
* Guard House 1764. Built when Marines were introduced into the Dockyard to improve security. It continued in use till 1984.
* Cashiers&#x27; Office 18th century. The Pay Office was moved here in 1750 from Hill House, and remained here until the yard closed. John Dickens, father of Charles Dickens, worked here from 1817 to 1822. It is still used as offices.
* Assistant Queen&#x27;s Harbourmaster&#x27;s Office , Grade II* listed. This office was supplied to the person who has been appointed to superintend the Dockyard Port. In 1865, the whole of the tidal Medway from Allington Lock to Sheerness was designated as a dockyard port and the Assistant Queen&#x27;s Harbourmaster was responsible for all moorings and movements. Alongside this office is a set of stone steps leading into the river Medway, with a wrought iron arch and lantern holder. Also Grade II listed. This was called the &quot;Queen Stairs&quot; and was the formal entry into the dockyard, during the &quot;Age of Sail&quot;.
* Dockyard Church 1806. Designed by Edward Holl, it has a gallery supported on cast iron columns, one of the first uses of cast iron in the dockyard. Last used in 1981.
* Admiral&#x27;s Offices 1808. Designed by Edward Holl as offices for the master shipwright. The roofline was low so it would not obstruct the view from the officers&#x27; terrace. Later it became Port Admiral&#x27;s office and was extended. The northern extension became the dockyard&#x27;s communication centre.
* Thunderbolt Pier, a pier named after , built 1856, which was used as a floating pier from 1873 until 1948, when she was rammed and sunk.
* Captain of the Dockyard&#x27;s House 19th century. Now a private residence. Also Grade II* listed.

====Anchor Wharf and the Ropery====
* Anchor Wharf Store Houses 1778–1805 (at nearly long) are the largest storehouses ever built for the navy.
** The southern building, Store House No 3, completed in 1785, is subdivided with timber lattice partitions as a &quot;lay apart store&quot;, a store for equipment from vessels under repair. It has been Grade I listed since August 1999.
** The northern building was used as a fitted rigging house, and a general store for equipment to fit out newly built ships. It also has been Grade I listed since August 1999. The Fitted Rigging House is now used as the Library and houses the Steam Steel and Submarines 1832–1984 gallery.
* The Ropery consists of Hemp Houses (1728, extended 1812), Yarn Houses and a double Rope House with attached Hatchelling House. Hatchelling is combing the hemp fibres to straighten them out before spinning. This was the first stage of the ropemaking process. The Ropery is still in use, being operated by Master Ropemakers Ltd.
** The Double Rope House has spinning on the upper floors and ropemaking (a ropewalk) on the ground floor. It is long, and when constructed was the longest brick-built building in Europe capable of laying a rope. Over 200 men were required before 1836, to make and lay a 20in (circumference) cable. All was done by hand. Steam power in the form of a beam engine was introduced in 1836, and then electricity in the early 1900s.
** The White Yarn House to store the yarn before it was tarred to prevent rot.
** The Tarring House with its &quot;Tar Kettle&quot; and horse drawn winch.
** The Black Yarn House to store the tarred yarn. The tarring process declined as manila replaced hemp, and sisal replaced manila. These fibres were chemically protected at the hatchelling stage and tarring stopped in the 1940s.

====Metalwork====
* No 1 Smithery 1808. Originally consisting of three ranges around an open courtyard, it was designed by Edward Holl and fitted out by John Rennie with 40 forges for production of Anchors and Chain. Anchors could weigh , and were forged by hand. &quot;Anchorsmiths&quot; were given an allowance of of strong beer a day, because of the difficult working conditions. In 1841 a beam engine was installed (in an extension to the north-east) to replace the manual bellows; another was added the following year. The courtyard was roofed over for a steam hammer shop in 1865.
* Lead and Paint Mill 1818. Designed by Edward Holl to be fireproof. There were a lead furnace, casting area and steam powered double rolling mill, paint mills for grinding pigment, canvas stretching frames, and vats for storing and boiling linseed oil. A warship was painted every 4 months.
* Iron Foundry 1855–61. Built immediately to the north of the Smithery (the intervening space was later infilled with the Smithery extension of 1867). Extended in connection with preparations for HMS &quot;Achilles&quot; (see below).
* No 1 Machine Shop 1861. This building retains it original structure and roof glazing. It was used to house the machine tools needed to produce HMS &quot;Achilles&quot;, the first iron battleship built in a Royal Dockyard. This building has now become home to the railway workshop.
* The Galvanising Shop . Galvanising is a process of dipping steel in molten zinc to prevent it from rusting. There were baths of acid and molten zinc, the fumes vented through louvres in the roof.
* Chain Cable Shed , built to protect newly manufactured anchor chain. The roof is supported by a row of 28 captured French and Spanish guns.

===Surviving structures within the Victorian Steam Yard===
The Victorian Steam Yard was built around three large Basins (wet docks), constructed between 1865 and 1885 along the line of St Mary&#x27;s Creek (separating St Mary&#x27;s Island from the mainland). It was envisaged that Basin No 1 would serve as a &quot;repair basin&quot;, No 2 as the &quot;factory basin&quot; and No 3 as the &quot;fitting-out&quot; basin; a newly launched ship could therefore enter via the west lock, have any defects remedied in the first basin, have her steam engines and heavy machinery installed in the second, and then be finished, and loaded with coal and provisions, in the third before leaving via the east locks.
* Four drydocks (Nos 5–8) were constructed at the same time on the south side of No 1 Basin; all four were in use by 1873. The yard&#x27;s Steam Factory complex was built at around the same time; most of its buildings were sited around these docks (rather than by Basin No 2 as had originally been planned).
* No 1 Boiler Shop and No 8 Machine Shop were originally built as slip covers at Woolwich Dockyard in the 1840s. When that Dockyard closed in 1869 they were dismantled and rebuilt at Chatham alongside the new dry docks. Only the framework survives of the Machine Shop, but the Boiler Shop was renovated in 2003 to house the Dockyard Outlet shopping centre. A third such structure from Woolwich, similar in design to the boiler shop, stood nearby and served as a fitting shop; it was demolished in 1990.
* Dock Pumping Station 1874: as well as serving to empty dry docks 5–8 when required, its accumulator tower provided hydraulic power for the adjacent cranes, capstans and caissons. Two other pumping stations served a similar purpose (one for dock 9 and one for the two east locks) but they have not survived.
* Combined Ship Trade Office 1880: now the &quot;Ship &amp; Trades&quot; public house.
* A fifth dry dock (No 9) was added in 1895 on the north side of No 1 Basin, opposite the other four, to accommodate the new, larger battleships which were then under construction. It was completed in 1903.
* The 100 ft bell mast was erected in 1903 alongside the Dockyard&#x27;s Pembroke Gate, where it was used to signal the start of each working day. (A similar but older mast fulfilled the same function alongside the main gate in the Georgian part of the Yard.) The 1903 mast had originally served as foremast to HMS &quot;Undaunted&quot;. In 1992 it had been dismantled, but was re-erected, a short distance from its original location, in 2001. Apart from the two Chatham examples, only one other is believed to have survived: in Devonport&#x27;s Morice Ordnance Yard.

==The Gun Wharf==

An Ordnance Yard was established in the 17th century immediately upriver of the Dockyard (on the site of the original Tudor yard, vacated in 1622). The yard would have received, stored and issued cannons and gun-carriages (along with projectiles, accoutrements and also all manner of small arms) for ships based in the Medway, as well as for local artillery emplacements and for army use. (Gunpowder, on the other hand, was received, stored and issued across the river at Upnor Castle.)
A plan of 1704 shows (from north to south) a long Storehouse parallel to the river, the Storekeeper&#x27;s house (the Storekeeper was the senior officer of the Yard) and a pair of Carriage Stores. In 1717 the original Storehouse was replaced with the Grand Store (a much larger three-storey building, contemporary with and of a similar style to, the Main Gatehouse in the Dockyard). Not long afterwards a large new single-storey Carriage Store, with a long frontage parallel to the river, was constructed, adjoining the Storekeeper&#x27;s House to the south.
After the demise of the Board of Ordnance (1855), Ordnance Yards passed under the control of the War Office, and were eventually (in 1891) apportioned to either the Army or the Navy. Chatham&#x27;s yard was split in two, the area south of the Storekeeper&#x27;s House becoming an Army Ordnance Store, and the rest a Navy Ordnance Store. It remained thus until 1958 when the yards were closed (the Army depot having served latterly as an atomic weapons research laboratory). Most of the 18th-century buildings were demolished, with the exception of the Storekeeper&#x27;s House of 1719, which survives as the Command House public house. A few later buildings have survived: a long brick shed of 1805, southwest of the Command House, which once housed carpenters, wheelwrights and other workers as well as stores of various kinds, the adjacent building (machine shop, late-19th century) which now serves as a public library, and the building known as the White House (built as the Clerk of the Cheque&#x27;s residence in 1816).

==Defence of the dockyard==
===Upnor Castle===
Dockyards have always required shore defences. Among the earliest for Chatham was Upnor Castle, built in 1567, on the opposite side of the River Medway. It was somewhat unfortunate that, on the one occasion when it was required for actionthe Raid on the Medway, 1667the Dutch fleet were able to sail right past it to attack the English fleet and carry off the pride of the fleet, , back to the Netherlands.

===Chain defence===
During the wars with Spain it was usual for ships to anchor at Chatham in reserve; consequently John Hawkins threw a massive chain across the River Medway for extra defence in 1585. Hawkins&#x27; chain was later replaced with a boom of masts, iron, cordage, and the hulls of two old ships, besides a couple of ruined pinnacles.

===The Lines===

With the failure of Upnor Castle, it was seen necessary to increase the defences. In the event, those defences were built in distinct phases, as the government saw the increasing threat of invasion:
* 1669 Fort Gillingham and Cockham Wood Fort built.
* 1756 Chatham Lines built, to designs by Captain John Desmaretz (who also designed the Portsmouth fortifications). This fortification, and its subsequent upgrading, were to concentrate on an overland attack and so were built to face south. They included redoubts at Amherst and Townsend. The Lines enclosed the entire dockyard on its eastern side.
* 1778–1783 Further improvements were carried out, to the designs of Captain Hugh Debbeig at the bequest of General Amherst. In 1782, an Act of Parliament increased the land needed for the Field of Fire.
* 1805–1812 Amherst redoubt, now Fort Amherst; new forts, named Pitt and Clarence. The Lines were also extended to the east of Saint Mary&#x27;s Creek (on St Mary&#x27;s Island).
* 1860s Grain Fort, and other smaller batteries in that area.
* 1870–1892 A number of forts built at a greater distance from the dockyard: Forts Bridgewood, Luton, Borstal, Horsted and Darland. These became known as the &quot;Great Lines&quot;. Forts Darnet and Hoo built on islands in the River Medway.

==Associated barracks==

The Dockyard led to large numbers of military personnel being garrisoned in Chatham and the surrounding area. A good many were engaged in manning the defences, but some had other duties; others were accommodated there for convenience prior to embarking on ships for duties overseas, or following their disembarkation. Initially, soldiers were housed under canvas or else billetted in houses and inns, but from the 18th century barracks began to be constructed. The oldest surviving barracks in the Chatham area is in Upnor; dating from 1718, it housed the detachment of 64 men responsible for guarding the gunpowder store in Upnor Castle.

===Infantry Barracks (Kitchener Barracks)===

Chatham Infantry Barracks was opened in 1757 to house troops manning the fortifications which had recently been built to defend the Dockyard. Accommodating some 1,800 men, Chatham was one of the first large-scale Army barracks in England. Built on sloping ground east of the Dockyard, the rectangular site (enclosed within its own perimeter wall) consisted of a &#x27;Lower Barracks&#x27; with accommodation for the soldiers and &#x27;Upper Barracks&#x27; (later known as &#x27;The Terrace&#x27;) which housed the officers; between the two was a large parade ground. The three-storey barrack blocks were aligned north–south. Externally, all the blocks were similar in appearance. Those for the officers were placed in a single row on elevated ground to the east, accessed from the parade ground by way of a double ramp; they provided housing for two field officers, twelve captains and thirty-seven subalterns. The subalterns were given one room each, the captains two, and field officers four. The officers all had servants, who were provided with their own accommodation in the garret. The barracks for other ranks were arranged in three rows, west of the parade ground, with soldiers sleeping sixteen to a room in eight double beds, as was standard practice at that time. Similar but smaller blocks to the north and south housed ancillary services, such as the pay office, infirmary and Quartermaster&#x27;s stores.

Within the space of 20 years, Chatham Barracks had taken on an additional role as the Army Depôt of Recruits and Invalids: accommodating &#x27;a mixed mass of people, viz. recruits destined for regiments which were abroad, prisoners confined on account of desertion and other military offences, added to which was a proportion of invalids, sent home from foreign stations on account of old age, or bodily infirmity&#x27;. The establishment of the Depôt was linked to the appointment in 1778 of an &#x27;Inspector General and Superintendent of the Recruiting of all the Forces employed on foreign service&#x27;, based in Chatham, who provided a degree of centralised oversight of recruitment (responsibility for which had previously been left entirely to the regiments). During this time, Chatham Depôt provided basic training for new recruits. This role ceased in 1801, however, when the entire Depôt establishment moved to Parkhurst Barracks on the Isle of Wight (where the recruits were less prone to find ways of deserting).

During the Napoleonic Wars large numbers of troops were concentrated at Chatham Lines to counter the threat of a French invasion. In the years of peace after 1815 Chatham continued to serve as a major embarkation port for troops serving overseas. The Infantry Barracks went on to serve as a home depot for numerous regiments.

A Royal Commission of 1861 (set up in the wake of the Crimean War to improve the sanitary condition of Britain&#x27;s Army barracks and Hospitals) was scathing in its judgement of facilities at Chatham; in the years that followed several alterations were made to Chatham Barracks (which had changed little over the preceding century): an additional storey was added to several of the barrack blocks to help alleviate overcrowding, and new buildings were inserted among the old, containing improved facilities for cooking, washing and recreation. At around the same time the officers&#x27; blocks on the terrace were given over to provide accommodation for sergeants and married NCOs, the officers being provided with new quarters &#x27;near the fortifications at Prince Henry&#x27;s Bastion&#x27;. In 1865, following the opening of new and enlarged hospital facilities in Fort Pitt, the old Garrison Hospital was closed; its buildings (on what is now Maxwell Road) were converted into barracks and named &#x27;Upper Chatham Barracks&#x27; (later &#x27;Upper Kitchener Barracks&#x27;). New married quarters were also opened in March that same year, into which soldiers&#x27; families were moved, mostly from lodgings in the town.

In 1928 Chatham Barracks was taken over by the Royal Engineers and renamed Kitchener Barracks. One barrack block remains from 1757; the rest was largely demolished and rebuilt to a more modern design in the 1930s–50s. The barracks remained in military use until 2014.

In 2014 the site was sold to a property developer, with permission given the following year for the building of 295 homes. The main 1930s barracks building is being retained, along with the remaining earlier structures. The new development has retained the name Kitchener Barracks.

===Marine Barracks===

The Royal Marine Barracks, Chatham were established in 1779, on a site nestled between the Gun Wharf to the west, the Dockyard to the north, and Infantry Barracks to the east. The site was expanded and rebuilt in the 1860s; in 1905 the Royal Marines took over Melville Barracks, which stood between Dock Road and Brompton Hill (it had formerly served as Chatham&#x27;s Royal Naval Hospital). The Marines were withdrawn from Chatham in 1950, and the buildings were later demolished. Medway Council offices and car park now stand on the site.

===Artillery/Engineer Barracks (Brompton Barracks)===

A barracks was built in Brompton from 1804 to 1806 for the Royal Artillery gunners serving on the defensive Lines (previously they had been accommodated in the Infantry Barracks). There was space for some 500 horses and 1,000 men. In 1812 the Royal Engineers Establishment was founded within the barracks to provide instruction in military engineering. The Establishment grew, and by 1856 the Artillery had moved out; Brompton Barracks remains in service as headquarters of the Royal Engineers.
===St Mary&#x27;s Barracks===
St Mary&#x27;s Casemated Barracks were built during the Peninsular War and initially held French prisoners of war. After the war&#x27;s end, they went on to serve as a gunpowder store for a time, and were used by the Royal Engineers (based nearby in Brompton Barracks). From 1844 St Mary&#x27;s was used as an &#x27;Invalid Barracks&#x27;, accommodating soldiers having to return from service in different parts of the British Empire because of illness, injury or age. Built within the defensive earthworks to the north of Chatham, St Mary&#x27;s Barracks was demolished in the 1960s and the land used for housing.

===Naval Barracks (HMS &quot;Pembroke&quot;)===
The Naval Barracks (later HMS &quot;Pembroke&quot;) opened in 1902; prior to this, most Naval (as opposed to Dockyard) personnel were accommodated on board their ships or on hulks moored nearby. Built on the site of what had been the convict prison, the barracks complex could accommodate 4,742 officers and seamen in a series of large blocks built along the length of a terrace. Below the terrace lay the parade ground and its adjacent drill hall and other amenities. A further 3,000 troops could be accommodated in times of &quot;total emergency&quot; (900 were sleeping in the Drill Hall when it suffered a direct hit from two bombs in September 1917, which killed over 130 men).

The barracks were set to close in 1961 when the majority of naval personnel were withdrawn from Chatham; however, it went on to serve instead as the RN Supply and Secretariat School in succession to , before finally being closed along with the Dockyard in 1984. The majority of its buildings are still standing, several of them occupied by the Universities at Medway.
