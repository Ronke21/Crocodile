<text>Pedro Miguel Carreiro Resendes (born 28 April 1973), known as Pauleta (), is a Portuguese former professional footballer who played as a striker.

During 18 years as a senior he never played in the Primeira Liga, having spent 12 of those campaigns in Spain and France. He had his most successful spell at Paris Saint-Germain, where he scored 109 goals across all competitions. Three times the top goalscorer in Ligue 1, he was also voted twice as the division&#x27;s player of the season.

Pauleta also scored 47 goals in 88 matches for Portugal, a national record at the time of his retirement. He played for his country in two World Cups and two European Championships.

==Club career==
===Early years and Spain===
Born in Ponta Delgada, São Miguel Island in the Azores, Pauleta started his career with local clubs in his native region, before turning professional in the lower leagues. He was part of FC Porto&#x27;s youth team for a brief stint yet left soon due to homesickness, signing his first professional contract with CU Micaelense in 1994 and spending one year there. He then moved to second division&#x27;s G.D. Estoril Praia in 1995, helping them to the 12th position in his first and only season.

The goals continued to flow following a switch to Spanish second level side UD Salamanca in 1996, with Pauleta scoring 19 goals as it gained promotion to La Liga in the following year, adding a further 15 in his first season in the top flight. That rate earned him a move to Deportivo de La Coruña, in summer 1998.

Pauleta scored his first goal in European competition in the 1999–2000 UEFA Cup, netting in a 3–1 home win against Montpellier HSC and repeating the feat in the second leg (2–0). On 22 November 1999 he netted a hat-trick for &quot;Depor&quot; in a home fixture against Sevilla FC, going on to enjoy a two-year spell with the Galicians which included 33 goals in 92 official matches, including eight from 12 starts as the club won its first league championship title in 2000.

===Bordeaux===
On 1 September 2000, after being tracked by the likes of Newcastle United, Aston Villa and Sunderland, Pauleta joined FC Girondins de Bordeaux in France, reportedly for financial and family reasons. He scored three as his new club crushed FC Nantes 5–0 in an away match, and some days later, on 26 September, did the same in a UEFA Cup first round match against Lierse SK, with his team qualifying for the next round; he enjoyed an impressive run in his first season, ending it as team top scorer with 26 goals in all competitions, and the Ligue 1&#x27;s second leading scorer with 20.

In the 2001–02 campaign, Pauleta was the league&#x27;s top scorer with 22 goals. He also led the team charts in all competitions with 35 successful strikes – a record. Subsequently, he was voted the best player in the French League and was also awarded the &#x27;Oscar of football&#x27; by fellow players and coaches, and was named one of the 50 players shortlisted for the 2002 European Footballer of the Year award (Ballon d&#x27;Or), with only one other player from the French League in the list; additionally, he won the French League Cup, being instrumental to the success by netting twice in the final. After these performances, Manchester City&#x27;s manager Kevin Keegan expressed an interest in the striker, but Bordeaux&#x27;s chairman Jean-Louis Triaud said that, initially, they were not interested in the transfer, showing that he could be for sale only in the right circumstances.

In 2002–03, Pauleta proved himself another time, scoring 23 league goals and 30 overall. For the second time he won the title for the best player in the league, and was also named in its team of the year. In total, he registered 65 league goals in 98 games and 91 in 130 matches in all competitions for Bordeaux, ranking third all-time upon his departure.

===Paris Saint-Germain===

Pauleta joined Paris Saint-Germain F.C. ahead of the 2003–04 season, signing a three-year contract in a reported €12 million transfer deal. He helped the capital side to its first silverware in six years by scoring the only goal of the 2004 French Cup final against LB Châteauroux, and continued with his goal scoring exploits in the league, netting 18 times in 37 contests as they finished the league in second place.

On 2 April 2006, Pauleta scored his first hat-trick for Paris Saint-Germain against former club Bordeaux, as the hosts won 3–1. Despite reported interest from defending champions Olympique Lyonnais, he stayed put to help clinch the 2006 French Cup; he netted his 99th and 100th overall goals for the side in heroic fashion, off a fantastic volley and a textbook header respectively.

Pauleta scored one of PSG&#x27;s goals as they won the 2008 Coupe de la Ligue Final 2–1 against RC Lens. After the 2007–08 campaign, as PSG faced relegation until the very last matchday (eventually reaching safety at 16th), Pauleta retired from football after his last match on 17 May 2008, with the possible exception being if any of the Big three (S.L. Benfica, Sporting CP and Porto) in Portugal came calling, which they did not. He retired at 35 without having played one game in Portugal&#x27;s Primeira Liga, subsequently staying at PSG but in an ambassadorial role; he remained the club&#x27;s top scorer of all time with 109 goals in 211 matches, until the record was broken by Zlatan Ibrahimović in October 2015.

In late May 2009, Pauleta played his farewell match at the Parc des Princes, playing one half each with a team of friends and PSG – former and current – players. His son André, 13, replaced him at the end of the game and scored the final two goals.

=== São Roque ===
Pauleta returned to football at the age of 37, joining amateurs Grupo Desportivo São Roque in the Azores&#x27; regional leagues and retiring shortly after arriving.

==International career==

Pauleta was the first Portugal national team player to never have played in the Portuguese top level when he made his international debut against Armenia, in August 1997. He would have to wait 18 months for his first start, against the Netherlands. His first goals came a month later, when he scored two in a 7–0 rout of Azerbaijan in a UEFA Euro 2000 qualifier on 26 March 1999.

A substitute at the Euro 2000 tournament, Pauleta led the Portuguese attack at the 2002 FIFA World Cup, scoring three times against Poland and ending with that tally in as many games, as the nation was ousted in the group stage. On 19 November 2003, he scored four goals in an 8–0 friendly win over Kuwait in Leiria.

Although he played all but one game on the road to the final of Euro 2004, Pauleta did not score in that tournament finals. After the competition, with the international retirements of Fernando Couto, Luís Figo and Rui Costa, he was made captain, a role he held until Figo&#x27;s return; however, he sporadically played as captain in the latter&#x27;s absence, including a 2–0 win over Egypt at the Estádio de São Miguel in his hometown on 17 August 2005. On 12 October, against Latvia, he netted twice to become the national team&#x27;s all-time goal scoring leader at the time, surpassing Eusébio&#x27;s previous record of 41.

During the 2006 World Cup qualifying campaign, Pauleta was the European zone&#x27;s top scorer and, in a friendly match against Cape Verde in May 2006 preluding the final stages, he showed great form as he netted a hat-trick in a 4–1 win. However, after scoring the side&#x27;s first goal in the group stage match against Angola, he failed to find the net again during the tournament; after Portugal&#x27;s defeat to Germany in the third place play-off, he announced his international retirement.

==Style of play==
A prolific goalscorer in his prime, Pauleta was considered one of the best strikers in Europe. He usually operated as a lone striker or alongside another forward, and combined mobility, pace and athleticism with good technique, two-footedness and strength in the air.

==Personal life==
Pauleta&#x27;s nickname was passed down from generation to generation in the family of his father&#x27;s maternal grandmother, while his goal celebration of spreading his arms like wings earned him the additional moniker &quot;The Eagle of the Azores&quot;.

In November 2005, he signed to become a FIFA ambassador for the SOS Children&#x27;s Villages, the first Portuguese to do so.

<text>Evolutionary game theory (EGT) is the application of game theory to evolving populations in biology. It defines a framework of contests, strategies, and analytics into which Darwinian competition can be modelled. It originated in 1973 with John Maynard Smith and George R. Price&#x27;s formalisation of contests, analysed as strategies, and the mathematical criteria that can be used to predict the results of competing strategies.

Evolutionary game theory differs from classical game theory in focusing more on the dynamics of strategy change. This is influenced by the frequency of the competing strategies in the population.

Evolutionary game theory has helped to explain the basis of altruistic behaviours in Darwinian evolution. It has in turn become of interest to economists, sociologists, anthropologists, and philosophers.

==History==
===Classical game theory===
Classical non-cooperative game theory was conceived by John von Neumann to determine optimal strategies in competitions between adversaries. A contest involves players, all of whom have a choice of moves. Games can be a single round or repetitive. The approach a player takes in making their moves constitutes their strategy. Rules govern the outcome for the moves taken by the players, and outcomes produce payoffs for the players; rules and resulting payoffs can be expressed as decision trees or in a payoff matrix. Classical theory requires the players to make rational choices. Each player must consider the strategic analysis that their opponents are making to make their own choice of moves.

===The problem of ritualized behaviour===
Evolutionary game theory started with the problem of how to explain ritualized animal behaviour in a conflict situation; &quot;why are animals so &#x27;gentlemanly or ladylike&#x27; in contests for resources?&quot; The leading ethologists Niko Tinbergen and Konrad Lorenz proposed that such behaviour exists for the benefit of the species. John Maynard Smith considered that incompatible with Darwinian thought, where selection occurs at an individual level, so self-interest is rewarded while seeking the common good is not. Maynard Smith, a mathematical biologist, turned to game theory as suggested by George Price, though Richard Lewontin&#x27;s attempts to use the theory had failed.

===Adapting game theory to evolutionary games===

Maynard Smith realised that an evolutionary version of game theory does not require players to act rationally—only that they have a strategy. The results of a game show how good that strategy was, just as evolution tests alternative strategies for the ability to survive and reproduce. In biology, strategies are genetically inherited traits that control an individual&#x27;s action, analogous with computer programs. The success of a strategy is determined by how good the strategy is in the presence of competing strategies (including itself), and of the frequency with which those strategies are used. Maynard Smith described his work in his book &quot;Evolution and the Theory of Games&quot;.

Participants aim to produce as many replicas of themselves as they can, and the payoff is in units of fitness (relative worth in being able to reproduce). It is always a multi-player game with many competitors. Rules include replicator dynamics, in other words how the fitter players will spawn more replicas of themselves into the population and how the less fit will be culled, in a replicator equation. The replicator dynamics models heredity but not mutation, and assumes asexual reproduction for the sake of simplicity. Games are run repetitively with no terminating conditions. Results include the dynamics of changes in the population, the success of strategies, and any equilibrium states reached. Unlike in classical game theory, players do not choose their strategy and cannot change it: they are born with a strategy and their offspring inherit that same strategy.

==Evolutionary games==
===Models===
Evolutionary game theory encompasses Darwinian evolution, including competition (the game), natural selection (replicator dynamics), and heredity. Evolutionary game theory has contributed to the understanding of group selection, sexual selection, altruism, parental care, co-evolution, and ecological dynamics. Many counter-intuitive situations in these areas have been put on a firm mathematical footing by the use of these models.

The common way to study the evolutionary dynamics in games is through replicator equations. These show the growth rate of the proportion of organisms using a certain strategy and that rate is equal to the difference between the average payoff of that strategy and the average payoff of the population as a whole. Continuous replicator equations assume infinite populations, continuous time, complete mixing and that strategies breed true. Some attractors (all global asymptotically stable fixed points) of the equations are evolutionarily stable states. A strategy which can survive all &quot;mutant&quot; strategies is considered evolutionarily stable. In the context of animal behavior, this usually means such strategies are programmed and heavily influenced by genetics, thus making any player or organism&#x27;s strategy determined by these biological factors.

Evolutionary games are mathematical objects with different rules, payoffs, and mathematical behaviours. Each &quot;game&quot; represents different problems that organisms have to deal with, and the strategies they might adopt to survive and reproduce. Evolutionary games are often given colourful names and cover stories which describe the general situation of a particular game. Representative games include hawk-dove, war of attrition, stag hunt, producer-scrounger, tragedy of the commons, and prisoner&#x27;s dilemma. Strategies for these games include hawk, dove, bourgeois, prober, defector, assessor, and retaliator. The various strategies compete under the particular game&#x27;s rules, and the mathematics are used to determine the results and behaviours.

===Hawk dove===

The first game that Maynard Smith analysed is the classic &quot;hawk dove&quot; game. It was conceived to analyse Lorenz and Tinbergen&#x27;s problem, a contest over a shareable resource. The contestants can be either a hawk or a dove. These are two subtypes or morphs of one species with different strategies. The hawk first displays aggression, then escalates into a fight until it either wins or is injured (loses). The dove first displays aggression, but if faced with major escalation runs for safety. If not faced with such escalation, the dove attempts to share the resource.

Given that the resource is given the value V, the damage from losing a fight is given cost C:

*If a hawk meets a dove, the hawk gets the full resource V 
*If a hawk meets a hawk, half the time they win, half the time they lose, so the average outcome is then V/2 minus C/2
*If a dove meets a hawk, the dove will back off and get nothing – 0
*If a dove meets a dove, both share the resource and get V/2

The actual payoff, however, depends on the probability of meeting a hawk or dove, which in turn is a representation of the percentage of hawks and doves in the population when a particular contest takes place. That, in turn, is determined by the results of all of the previous contests. If the cost of losing C is greater than the value of winning V (the normal situation in the natural world) the mathematics ends in an evolutionarily stable strategy (ESS), a mix of the two strategies where the population of hawks is V/C. The population regresses to this equilibrium point if any new hawks or doves make a temporary perturbation in the population.
The solution of the hawk dove game explains why most animal contests involve only ritual fighting behaviours in contests rather than outright battles. The result does not at all depend on &quot;good of the species&quot; behaviours as suggested by Lorenz, but solely on the implication of actions of so-called selfish genes.

===War of attrition===
In the hawk dove game the resource is shareable, which gives payoffs to both doves meeting in a pairwise contest. Where the resource is not shareable, but an alternative resource might be available by backing off and trying elsewhere, pure hawk or dove strategies are less effective. If an unshareable resource is combined with a high cost of losing a contest (injury or possible death) both hawk and dove payoffs are further diminished. A safer strategy of lower cost display, bluffing and waiting to win, is then viable – a bluffer strategy. The game then becomes one of accumulating costs, either the costs of displaying or the costs of prolonged unresolved engagement. It is effectively an auction; the winner is the contestant who will swallow the greater cost while the loser gets the same cost as the winner but no resource. The resulting evolutionary game theory mathematics lead to an optimal strategy of timed bluffing.

This is because in the war of attrition any strategy that is unwavering and predictable is unstable, because it will ultimately be displaced by a mutant strategy which relies on the fact that it can best the existing predictable strategy by investing an extra small delta of waiting resource to ensure that it wins. Therefore, only a random unpredictable strategy can maintain itself in a population of bluffers. The contestants in effect choose an acceptable cost to be incurred related to the value of the resource being sought, effectively making a random bid as part of a mixed strategy (a strategy where a contestant has several, or even many, possible actions in their strategy). This implements a distribution of bids for a resource of specific value V, where the bid for any specific contest is chosen at random from that distribution. The distribution (an ESS) can be computed using the Bishop-Cannings theorem, which holds true for any mixed-strategy ESS. The distribution function in these contests was determined by Parker and Thompson to be:

:formula_1
The result is that the cumulative population of quitters for any particular cost m in this &quot;mixed strategy&quot; solution is:

:formula_2
as shown in the adjacent graph. The intuitive sense that greater values of resource sought leads to greater waiting times is borne out. This is observed in nature, as in male dung flies contesting for mating sites, where the timing of disengagement in contests is as predicted by evolutionary theory mathematics.

===Asymmetries that allow new strategies===

In the war of attrition there must be nothing that signals the size of a bid to an opponent, otherwise the opponent can use the cue in an effective counter-strategy. There is however a mutant strategy which can better a bluffer in the war of attrition game if a suitable asymmetry exists, the bourgeois strategy. Bourgeois uses an asymmetry of some sort to break the deadlock. In nature one such asymmetry is possession of a resource. The strategy is to play a hawk if in possession of the resource, but to display then retreat if not in possession. This requires greater cognitive capability than hawk, but bourgeois is common in many animal contests, such as in contests among mantis shrimps and among speckled wood butterflies.

===Social behaviour===
Games like hawk dove and war of attrition represent pure competition between individuals and have no attendant social elements. Where social influences apply, competitors have four possible alternatives for strategic interaction. This is shown on the adjacent figure, where a plus sign represents a benefit and a minus sign represents a cost.

* In a &quot;cooperative&quot; or &quot;mutualistic&quot; relationship both &quot;donor&quot; and &quot;recipient&quot; are almost indistinguishable as both gain a benefit in the game by co-operating, i.e. the pair are in a game-wise situation where both can gain by executing a certain strategy, or alternatively both must act in concert because of some encompassing constraints that effectively puts them &quot;in the same boat&quot;.
* In an &quot;altruistic&quot; relationship the donor, at a cost to themself provides a benefit to the recipient. In the general case the recipient will have a kin relationship to the donor and the donation is one-way. Behaviours where benefits are donated alternatively (in both directions) at a cost, are often called &quot;altruistic&quot;, but on analysis such &quot;altruism&quot; can be seen to arise from optimised &quot;selfish&quot; strategies.
* &quot;Spite&quot; is essentially a “reversed” form of cooperation where neither party receives a tangible benefit. The general case is that the ally is kin related and the benefit is an easier competitive environment for the ally. 
* &quot;Selfishness&quot; is the base criteria of all strategic choice from a game theory perspective – strategies not aimed at self-survival and self-replication are not long for any game. Critically however, this situation is impacted by the fact that competition is taking place on multiple levels – i.e. at a genetic, an individual and a group level.

==Contests of selfish genes==
At first glance it may appear that the contestants of evolutionary games are the individuals present in each generation who directly participate in the game. But individuals live only through one game cycle, and instead it is the strategies that really contest with one another over the duration of these many-generation games. So it is ultimately genes that play out a full contest – selfish genes of strategy. The contesting genes are present in an individual and to a degree in all of the individual&#x27;s kin. This can sometimes profoundly affect which strategies survive, especially with issues of cooperation and defection. William Hamilton, known for his theory of kin selection, explored many of these cases using game-theoretic models. Kin-related treatment of game contests helps to explain many aspects of the behaviour of social insects, the altruistic behaviour in parent-offspring interactions, mutual protection behaviours, and co-operative care of offspring. For such games, Hamilton defined an extended form of fitness – &quot;inclusive fitness&quot;, which includes an individual&#x27;s offspring as well as any offspring equivalents found in kin.

Hamilton went beyond kin relatedness to work with Robert Axelrod, analysing games of co-operation under conditions not involving kin where reciprocal altruism came into play.

===Eusociality and kin selection===

Eusocial insect workers forfeit reproductive rights to their queen. It has been suggested that kin selection, based on the genetic makeup of these workers, may predispose them to altruistic behaviours. Most eusocial insect societies have haplodiploid sexual determination, which means that workers are unusually closely related.

This explanation of insect eusociality has, however, been challenged by a few highly-noted evolutionary game theorists (Nowak and Wilson) who have published a controversial alternative game theoretic explanation based on a sequential development and group selection effects proposed for these insect species.

===Prisoner&#x27;s dilemma===
A difficulty of the theory of evolution, recognised by Darwin himself, was the problem of altruism. If the basis for selection is at an individual level, altruism makes no sense at all. But universal selection at the group level (for the good of the species, not the individual) fails to pass the test of the mathematics of game theory and is certainly not the general case in nature. Yet in many social animals, altruistic behaviour exists. The solution to this problem can be found in the application of evolutionary game theory to the prisoner&#x27;s dilemma game – a game which tests the payoffs of cooperating or in defecting from cooperation. It is the most studied game in all of game theory.

The analysis of the prisoner&#x27;s dilemma is as a repetitive game. This affords competitors the possibility of retaliating for defection in previous rounds of the game. Many strategies have been tested; the best competitive strategies are general cooperation, with a reserved retaliatory response if necessary. The most famous and one of the most successful of these is tit-for-tat with a simple algorithm.
def tit_for_tat(last_move_by_opponent):
 &quot;&quot;&quot;Defect if opponent defects, else cooperate.&quot;&quot;&quot;
 if last_move_by_opponent == defect:
 defect()
 else:
 cooperate()
The pay-off for any single round of the game is defined by the pay-off matrix for a single round game (shown in bar chart 1 below). In multi-round games the different choices – co-operate or defect – can be made in any particular round, resulting in a certain round payoff. It is, however, the possible accumulated pay-offs over the multiple rounds that count in shaping the overall pay-offs for differing multi-round strategies such as tit-for-tat.

Example 1: The straightforward single round prisoner&#x27;s dilemma game. The classic prisoner&#x27;s dilemma game payoffs gives a player a maximum payoff if they defect and their partner co-operates (this choice is known as &quot;temptation&quot;). If, however, the player co-operates and their partner defects, they get the worst possible result (the suckers payoff). In these payoff conditions the best choice (a Nash equilibrium) is to defect.

Example 2: Prisoner&#x27;s dilemma played repeatedly. The strategy employed is &quot;tit-for-tat&quot; which alters behaviours based on the action taken by a partner in the previous round – i.e. reward co-operation and punish defection. The effect of this strategy in accumulated payoff over many rounds is to produce a higher payoff for both players&#x27; co-operation and a lower payoff for defection. This removes the temptation to defect. The suckers payoff also becomes less, although &quot;invasion&quot; by a pure defection strategy is not entirely eliminated.

===Routes to altruism===

Altruism takes place when one individual, at a cost (C) to itself, exercises a strategy that provides a benefit (B) to another individual. The cost may consist of a loss of capability or resource which helps in the battle for survival and reproduction, or an added risk to its own survival. Altruism strategies can arise through:

===The evolutionarily stable strategy===

The evolutionarily stable strategy (ESS) is akin to the Nash equilibrium in classical game theory, but with mathematically extended criteria. Nash equilibrium is a game equilibrium where it is not rational for any player to deviate from their present strategy, provided that the others adhere to their strategies. An ESS is a state of game dynamics where, in a very large population of competitors, another mutant strategy cannot successfully enter the population to disturb the existing dynamic (which itself depends on the population mix). Therefore, a successful strategy (with an ESS) must be both effective against competitors when it is rare – to enter the previous competing population, and successful when later in high proportion in the population – to defend itself. This in turn means that the strategy must be successful when it contends with others exactly like itself.

An ESS is not:

* An optimal strategy: that would maximize fitness, and many ESS states are far below the maximum fitness achievable in a fitness landscape. (See hawk dove graph above as an example of this.)
* A singular solution: often several ESS conditions can exist in a competitive situation. A particular contest might stabilize into any one of these possibilities, but later a major perturbation in conditions can move the solution into one of the alternative ESS states.
* Always present: it is possible for there to be no ESS. An evolutionary game with no ESS is &quot;rock-scissors-paper&quot;, as found in species such as the side-blotched lizard (&quot;Uta stansburiana&quot;).
* An unbeatable strategy: the ESS is only an uninvadeable strategy.

The ESS state can be solved for by exploring either the dynamics of population change to determine an ESS, or by solving equations for the stable stationary point conditions which define an ESS. For example, in the hawk dove game we can look for whether there is a static population mix condition where the fitness of doves will be exactly the same as fitness of hawks (therefore both having equivalent growth rates – a static point). 
Let the chance of meeting a hawk=p so therefore the chance of meeting a dove is (1-p)

Let Whawk equal the payoff for hawk...

Whawk=payoff in the chance of meeting a dove + payoff in the chance of meeting a hawk

Taking the payoff matrix results and plugging them into the above equation:

Similarly for a dove:

so...

Equating the two fitnesses, hawk and dove

... and solving for p

so for this &quot;static point&quot; where the &quot;population percent&quot; is an ESS solves to be ESS(percent Hawk)=&quot;V/C&quot;

Similarly, using inequalities, it can be shown that an additional hawk or dove mutant entering this ESS state eventually results in less fitness for their kind – both a true Nash and an ESS equilibrium. This example shows that when the risks of contest injury or death (the cost C) is significantly greater than the potential reward (the benefit value V), the stable population will be mixed between aggressors and doves, and the proportion of doves will exceed that of the aggressors. This explains behaviours observed in nature.

==Unstable games, cyclic patterns==

===Rock paper scissors===


Rock paper scissors incorporated into an evolutionary game has been used for modelling natural processes in the study of ecology. 
Using experimental economics methods, scientists have used RPS games to test human social evolutionary dynamical behaviours in laboratories. The social cyclic behaviours, predicted by evolutionary game theory, have been observed in various laboratory experiments.

===Side-blotched lizard plays the RPS, and other cyclical games===

The first example of RPS in nature was seen in the behaviours and throat colours of a small lizard of western North America. The side-blotched lizard (&quot;Uta stansburiana&quot;) is polymorphic with three throat-colour morphs that each pursue a different mating strategy:

* The orange throat is very aggressive and operates over a large territory – attempting to mate with numerous females 
* The unaggressive yellow throat mimics the markings and behavior of female lizards, and &quot;sneakily&quot; slips into the orange throat&#x27;s territory to mate with the females there (thereby taking over the population)
* The blue throat mates with, and carefully guards, one female – making it impossible for the sneakers to succeed and therefore overtakes their place in a population
However the blue throats cannot overcome the more aggressive orange throats. Later work showed that the blue males are altruistic to other blue males, with three key traits: they signal with blue color, they recognize and settle next to other (unrelated) blue males, and they will even defend their partner against orange, to the death. This is the hallmark of another game of cooperation that involves a green-beard effect.

The females in the same population have the same throat colours, and this affects how many offspring they produce and the size of the progeny, which generates cycles in density, yet another game – the &quot;r-K&quot; game. Here, &quot;r&quot; is the Malthusian parameter governing exponential growth, and &quot;K&quot; is the carrying capacity of the environment. Orange females have larger clutches and smaller offspring which do well at low density. Yellow &amp; blue females have smaller clutches and larger offspring which do well at high density. This generates perpetual cycles tightly tied to population density. The idea of cycles due to density regulation of two strategies originated with rodent researcher Dennis Chitty, ergo these kinds of games lead to &quot;Chitty cycles&quot;. There are games within games within games embedded in natural populations. These drive RPS cycles in the males with a periodicity of four years and &quot;r-K&quot; cycles in females with a two year period.

The overall situation corresponds to the rock, scissors, paper game, creating a four-year population cycle. The RPS game in male side-blotched lizards does not have an ESS, but it has a Nash equilibrium (NE) with endless orbits around the NE attractor. Following this Side-blotched lizard research, many other three-strategy polymorphisms have been discovered in lizards and some of these have RPS dynamics merging the male game and density regulation game in a single sex (males). More recently, mammals have been shown to harbour the same RPS game in males and &quot;r-K&quot; game in females, with coat-colour polymorphisms and behaviours that drive cycles. This game is also linked to the evolution of male care in rodents, and monogamy, and drives speciation rates. There are &quot;r-K&quot; strategy games linked to rodent population cycles (and lizard cycles).

When he read that these lizards were essentially engaged in a game with a rock-paper-scissors structure, John Maynard Smith is said to have exclaimed &quot;They have read my book!&quot;.

==Signalling, sexual selection and the handicap principle==

Aside from the difficulty of explaining how altruism exists in many evolved organisms, Darwin was also bothered by a second conundrum – why a significant number of species have phenotypical attributes that are patently disadvantageous to them with respect to their survival – and should by the process of natural section be selected against – e.g. the massive inconvenient feather structure found in a peacock&#x27;s tail. Regarding this issue Darwin wrote to a colleague &quot;The sight of a feather in a peacock&#x27;s tail, whenever I gaze at it, makes me sick.&quot; It is the mathematics of evolutionary game theory, which has not only explained the existence of altruism, but also explains the totally counterintuitive existence of the peacock&#x27;s tail and other such biological encumbrances.

On analysis, problems of biological life are not at all unlike the problems that define economics – eating (akin to resource acquisition and management), survival (competitive strategy) and reproduction (investment, risk and return). Game theory was originally conceived as a mathematical analysis of economic processes and indeed this is why it has proven so useful in explaining so many biological behaviours. One important further refinement of the evolutionary game theory model that has economic overtones rests on the analysis of costs. A simple model of cost assumes that all competitors suffer the same penalty imposed by the game costs, but this is not the case. More successful players will be endowed with or will have accumulated a higher &quot;wealth reserve&quot; or &quot;affordability&quot; than less-successful players. This wealth effect in evolutionary game theory is represented mathematically by &quot;resource holding potential (RHP)&quot; and shows that the effective cost to a competitor with a higher RHP are not as great as for a competitor with a lower RHP. As a higher RHP individual is a more desirable mate in producing potentially successful offspring, it is only logical that with sexual selection RHP should have evolved to be signalled in some way by the competing rivals, and for this to work this signalling must be done &quot;honestly&quot;. Amotz Zahavi has developed this thinking in what is known as the &quot;handicap principle&quot;, where superior competitors signal their superiority by a costly display. As higher RHP individuals can properly afford such a costly display this signalling is inherently honest, and can be taken as such by the signal receiver. In nature this is illustrated than in the costly plumage of the peacock. The mathematical proof of the handicap principle was developed by Alan Grafen using evolutionary game-theoretic modelling.

==Coevolution==
Two types of dynamics:
* Evolutionary games which lead to a stable situation or point of stasis for contending strategies which result in an evolutionarily stable strategy
* Evolutionary games which exhibit a cyclic behaviour (as with RPS game) where the proportions of contending strategies continuously cycle over time within the overall population

A third, coevolutionary, dynamic, combines intra-specific and inter-specific competition. Examples include predator-prey competition and host-parasite co-evolution, as well as mutualism. Evolutionary game models have been created for pairwise and multi-species coevolutionary systems. The general dynamic differs between competitive systems and mutualistic systems.

In competitive (non-mutualistic) inter-species coevolutionary system the species are involved in an arms race – where adaptations that are better at competing against the other species tend to be preserved. Both game payoffs and replicator dynamics reflect this. This leads to a Red Queen dynamic where the protagonists must &quot;run as fast as they can to just stay in one place&quot;.

A number of evolutionary game theory models have been produced to encompass coevolutionary situations. A key factor applicable in these coevolutionary systems is the continuous adaptation of strategy in such arms races. Coevolutionary modelling therefore often includes genetic algorithms to reflect mutational effects, while computers simulate the dynamics of the overall coevolutionary game. The resulting dynamics are studied as various parameters are modified. Because several variables are simultaneously at play, solutions become the province of multi-variable optimisation. The mathematical criteria of determining stable points are Pareto efficiency and Pareto dominance, a measure of solution optimality peaks in multivariable systems.

Carl Bergstrom and Michael Lachmann apply evolutionary game theory to the division of benefits in mutualistic interactions between organisms. Darwinian assumptions about fitness are modeled using replicator dynamics to show that the organism evolving at a slower rate in a mutualistic relationship gains a disproportionately high share of the benefits or payoffs.

==Extending the model==

A mathematical model analysing the behaviour of a system needs initially to be as simple as possible to aid in developing a base understanding the fundamentals, or “first order effects”, pertaining to what is being studied. With this understanding in place it is then appropriate to see if other, more subtle, parameters (second order effects) further impact the primary behaviours or shape additional behaviours in the system. Following Maynard Smith&#x27;s seminal work in evolutionary game theory, the subject has had a number of very significant extensions which have shed more light on understanding evolutionary dynamics, particularly in the area of altruistic behaviors. Some of these key extensions to evolutionary game theory are:

=== Spatial games ===

Geographic factors in evolution include gene flow and horizontal gene transfer. Spatial game models represent geometry by putting contestants in a lattice of cells: contests take place only with immediate neighbours. Winning strategies take over these immediate neighbourhoods and then interact with adjacent neighbourhoods. This model is useful in showing how pockets of co-operators can invade and introduce altruism in the Prisoners Dilemma game, where Tit for Tat (TFT) is a Nash Equilibrium but NOT also an ESS. Spatial structure is sometimes abstracted into a general network of interactions. This is the foundation of evolutionary graph theory.

===Effects of having information===

In evolutionary game theory as in conventional game theory the effect of Signalling (the acquisition of information) is of critical importance, as in Indirect Reciprocity in Prisoners Dilemma (where contests between the SAME paired individuals are NOT repetitive). This models the reality of most normal social interactions which are non-kin related. Unless a probability measure of reputation is available in Prisoners Dilemma only direct reciprocity can be achieved. With this information indirect reciprocity is also supported.

Alternatively, agents might have access to an arbitrary signal initially uncorrelated to strategy but becomes correlated due to evolutionary dynamics. This is the green-beard effect (see side-blotched lizards, above) or evolution of ethnocentrism in humans. Depending on the game, it can allow the evolution of either cooperation or irrational hostility.

From molecular to multicellular level, a signaling game model with information asymmetry between sender and receiver might be appropriate, such as in mate attraction or evolution of translation machinery from RNA strings.

===Finite populations===

Many evolutionary games have been modelled in finite populations to see the effect this may have, for example in the success of mixed strategies.

<text>Sport climbing (or bolted climbing) is a type of free climbing in rock climbing where the lead climber clips into pre-drilled permanent bolts for their protection while ascending a route. Sport climbing differs from the riskier traditional climbing where the lead climber has to insert temporary protection equipment while ascending.

Sport climbing dates from the early 1980s when leading French rock climbers wanted to climb routes that offered no cracks or fissures in which to insert the temporary protection equipment used in traditional climbing. While bolting natural rock faces was controversial—and remains a focus of debate in climbing ethics—sport climbing grew rapidly in popularity; all subsequent grade milestones in rock climbing came from sport climbing.

The safer discipline of sport climbing also led to the rapid growth in competition climbing, which made its Olympic debut at the 2020 Summer Olympics. While competition climbing consists of three distinct rock climbing disciplines of lead climbing (the bolted sport climbing element), bouldering (no bolts needed), and speed climbing (also not bolted, but instead top roped), it is sometimes confusingly referred to as &quot;sport climbing&quot;.

== Description ==

Sport climbing is a form of free climbing (i.e. no artificial or mechanical device can be used to aid progression, unlike with aid climbing), performed in pairs, where the lead climber clips into pre-drilled permanently fixed bolts for their protection while ascending. The lead climber uses quickdraws to clip into the bolts. The second climber (or belayer), removes the quickdraws as they climb the route after the lead climber has reached the top.
Sport climbing differs from traditional climbing, which requires the lead climber to insert temporary climbing protection equipment as they ascend, making sport climbing safer. Additionally, sport climbing differs from free solo climbing where no climbing protection is used whatsoever.

Confusingly, the sport of competition climbing — which consists of three distinct rock climbing disciplines: lead climbing (the bolted sport climbing element), bouldering (no bolts needed), and speed climbing (also not bolted) — is sometimes referred to as &quot;sport climbing&quot;.

===First free ascent===

Sport climbing developed the redpoint definition of what constitutes a first free ascent (FFA), which has since become the standard definition of an FFA for all climbing disciplines. Redpointing allows for previously controversial techniques of hangdogging, headpointing, and pinkpointing (for competition lead climbing — the sport climbing component of competition climbing — and for extreme sport climbs, the quickdraws will already be attached to the bolts to make clipping in even simpler, which is known as pinkpointing).

== History ==
By the early 1980s, the leading rock climbers were beginning to reach the limits of existing traditional climbing protection devices. They looked to climb blanker-looking rock faces that did not have the usual cracks and fissures that are needed in which to place traditional climbing protection. In France, leading climbers such as Patrick Berhault and Patrick Edlinger began to pre-drill permanent bolts into the pocket-marked limestone walls of Buoux and Verdon Gorge for their protection. These became known as &quot;sport climbing routes&quot; (i.e. there was none of the associated risks of traditional climbing, it was a purely sporting endeavor), with early examples such as &quot;Pichenibule&quot; in 1980. Around the same time at Smith Rock State Park in the United States, American climber Alan Watts also started to place pre-drilled bolts into routes, creating the first American sport climbs of &quot;Watts Tot&quot; , and &quot;Chain Reaction&quot; in 1983.

Sport climbing was rapidly adopted in Europe, and particularly in France and Germany by the then emerging professional rock climbers such as German climber Wolfgang Güllich and French brothers and . The United Kingdom was more reluctant to allow bolting on natural rock surfaces, and early British sport climbers such as Jerry Moffatt and Ben Moon were forced to move to France and Germany. The bolting of external natural rock surfaces was also initially controversial in the US, although American sport climbing pioneer Alan Watts later recounted that American traditional climbers were as much against the &quot;redpointing&quot; techniques of sport climbers (i.e. continually practicing new routes before making the first free ascent), as they were against the use of bolts. Eventually, these sport climbers began to push new grade milestones far above traditional climbing grades, and the use of bolts on natural rock surfaces became more accepted in outdoor climbing areas across America and Europe.

===Competition sport climbing===
The significantly safer aspect of sport climbing over traditional climbing led to rapid development in competition climbing in the 1980s, where competition lead climbing events were held on bolted routes. &quot;Climbing&quot; noted the importance of events such as the 1988 International Sport Climbing Championship at Snowbird, Utah, for introducing leading European sport climbers such as Edlinger and Jean-Baptiste Tribout to leading American traditional climbers such as Ron Kauk and John Bachar. By the end of the 1990s, the UIAA, and latterly the International Federation of Sport Climbing (IFSC), was regulating and organizing major international climbing competitions, including the annual IFSC Climbing World Cup, and the biennial IFSC Climbing World Championships. Competitive climbing includes sport climbing (which is competition lead climbing), and also competition bouldering and competition speed climbing.

==Ethics==

Debates remain about the ethics of attaching permanent metal bolts on natural outdoor rock, which is also related to the broader clean climbing movement. Many climbing areas—particularly in Continental Europe (for example notable crags such as Oliana in Spain, and Ceuse in France)—have become fully bolted. However, many others remain emphatically non-bolted, such as Clogwyn Du&#x27;r Arddu in the United Kingdom, where only traditional climbing techniques are allowed, and attempts to make even very dangerous routes a little safer with even singular bolts (e.g. &quot;Indian Face&quot;) have been undone.

In the United Kingdom, the British Mountaineering Council (BMC) maintains a register of outdoor climbing areas that are suitable for bolting, and those which are to remain bolt free; in addition, the BMC offers guidance on bolting-related ethical climbing issues such as retro-bolting.

== Equipment==
===Quickdraws===

Sport climbing requires far less rock climbing equipment than traditional climbing as the protection is already pre-drilled into the route. Aside from the standard equipment of lead climbing (e.g. a rope, belay device, harness, and climbing shoes), the only important other important pieces of equipment are quickdraws to clip the rope into the bolts without generating friction. On complex sport climbing routes that don&#x27;t follow a straight line, the alignment and lengths of quickdraws used are important considerations to avoid rope drag.

===Bolts===

The pre-drilled bolts will degrade over time—particularly in coastal areas due to salt—and eventually, all sport climbs need to be re-fitted after several years. The highest quality titanium bolts are too expensive to use regularly, and the next highest quality stainless steel bolts have an expected lifespan of circa 20–25 years (the cheaper plated stainless steel bolts have a shorter span); and in 2015, the American Alpine Club established an &quot;anchor replacement fund&quot; to help replace the bolts on America&#x27;s estimated 60,000 sport climbing routes.

==Grading==

===Dominant systems===
As sport climbing removes the danger of a route by using bolts, sport routes are graded solely for their technical difficulty (i.e. how hard are the physical movements to ascend the route), and unlike traditional climbing routes, do not require an additional grade to reflect risk. The most dominant systems for grading sport climbing routes are the French system (e.g. ... 6b, 6c, 7a, 7b, 7c, ...), which is also called French sport grading, and the American system (e.g. ... 5.9, 5.10a, 5.10b, 5.10c, 5.10d, 5.11a, ...). The UIAA system (e.g. ... VII, VIII, IX, X, ...) is popular in Germany and central Europe. The Australian (or Ewbank) system (e.g. ... , 23, 24, 25, 26, ...) is also used.

===Integration with boulder grades===

Even though the grading of sport-routes is simpler than traditional routes, there is the issue of how to compare a short route with one very hard move, with a longer route with a sustained sequence of slightly easier moves. Most of the above grading systems are based on the &quot;overall&quot; difficulty of the route, and thus both routes could have the same sport grade. As a result of this, it has become common for the advanced sport climbing routes (e.g. &quot;Realization&quot;, &quot;La Dura Dura&quot;, and &quot;La Rambla&quot;) to describe the hardest moves by their bouldering grade, which is either the French &quot;Font&quot; system (e.g. ..., 7B, 7C, 8A, 8B, ...) or the American &quot;V-scale&quot; system (e.g. ..., V9, V10, V11, V12, ...). French sport-grades can be confused with French &quot;Font&quot; boulder grades, the only difference being &#x27;capitalization&#x27;.

As an example of how sport and boulder grades are used on sport climbing routes, this is Adam Ondra describing his 2017 redpoint of &quot;Silence&quot;, the first-ever sport climb with a sport-grade of 9c (French), which is the same as 5.15d (American) or XII+ (UIAA):

==Notable climbs and climbers==


Since the development of sport climbing in the early 1980s, all of the subsequent grade milestones (i.e. the next levels of hardest technical difficulty) in rock climbing have been set by sport climbers. German climber Wolfgang Güllich raised sport climbing grades from in 1984 with &quot;Kanal im Rücken&quot; to in 1991 with &quot;Action Directe&quot;. American climber Chris Sharma dominated sport climbing development in the decade after his ground-breaking ascent of &quot;Realization/Biographie&quot; at in 2001 and &quot;Jumbo Love&quot; at in 2008. Czech climber Adam Ondra took the mantle of the world&#x27;s strongest sport climber from Sharma by freeing &quot;&quot; in 2012 and &quot;La Dura Dura&quot; in 2013, both at . In 2017, Ondra freed &quot;Silence&quot;, the first-ever sport climb at .

Female sport climbing was dominated in the 1980s by American climber Lynn Hill and French climber Catherine Destivelle who set new female grade milestones and also competed against each other in the first climbing competitions. Spanish climber Josune Bereziartu dominated the setting of new grade milestones in female sport climbing in the late 1990s and early 2000s; her 2005 redpoint of &quot;Bimbaluna&quot; at was only a half-notch behind the highest male sport climbing route at the time, which was &quot;Realization/Biographie&quot; at 9a+. By 2017, Austrian climber Angela Eiter had broken into the grade with &quot;La Planta de Shiva&quot;, and in 2020 made the first female free ascent of a with &quot;Madame Ching&quot;. In 2020–21, Laura Rogora and Julia Chanourdie also climbed sport routes; when only a handful of male climbers have climbed at , and only Adam Ondra at .

Some of the strongest-ever sport climbers were also some of the strongest-ever competition climbers, such as Adam Ondra, Lynn Hill, and Angela Eiter. However, some of the other strongest-ever sport climbers either largely ignored competition climbing, or retired early from it to focus on non-competition sport climbing, such as Wolfgang Gullich, Chris Sharma, and Josune Bereziartu.

<text>Outgassing (sometimes called offgassing, particularly when in reference to indoor air quality) is the release of a gas that was dissolved, trapped, frozen, or absorbed in some material. Outgassing can include sublimation and evaporation (which are phase transitions of a substance into a gas), as well as desorption, seepage from cracks or internal volumes, and gaseous products of slow chemical reactions. Boiling is generally thought of as a separate phenomenon from outgassing because it consists of a phase transition of a liquid into a vapor of the same substance.

==In a vacuum==
Outgassing is a challenge to creating and maintaining clean high-vacuum environments. NASA and ESA maintain lists of materials with low-outgassing properties suitable for use in spacecraft, as outgassing products can condense onto optical elements, thermal radiators, or solar cells and obscure them. Materials not normally considered absorbent can release enough lightweight molecules to interfere with industrial or scientific vacuum processes. Moisture, sealants, lubricants, and adhesives are the most common sources, but even metals and glasses can release gases from cracks or impurities. The rate of outgassing increases at higher temperatures because the vapor pressure and rate of chemical reaction increases. For most solid materials, the method of manufacture and preparation can reduce the level of outgassing significantly. Cleaning of surfaces, or heating of individual components or the entire assembly (a process called &quot;bake-out&quot;) can drive off volatiles.

NASA&#x27;s &quot;Stardust&quot; space probe suffered reduced image quality due to an unknown contaminant that had condensed on the CCD sensor of the navigation camera. A similar problem affected the &quot;Cassini&quot; space probe&#x27;s Narrow Angle Camera, but was corrected by repeatedly heating the system to 4 °C. A comprehensive characterisation of outgassing effects using mass spectrometers could be obtained for ESA&#x27;s &quot;Rosetta&quot; spacecraft.

Natural outgassing is commonplace in comets.

==From rock==
Outgassing is a possible source of many tenuous atmospheres of terrestrial planets or moons. Many materials are volatile relative to the extreme vacuum of outer space, and may evaporate or even boil at ambient temperature. Materials on the lunar surface have completely outgassed and been blown away by solar winds long ago, but volatile materials may remain at depth. The lunar atmosphere probably originates from outgassing of warm material below the surface.

Once released, gases almost always are less dense than the surrounding rocks and sand and seep toward the surface. Explosive eruptions of volcanoes result from water or other volatiles outgassed from magma being trapped, for example by a lava dome. At the Earth&#x27;s tectonic divergent boundaries where new crust is being created, helium and carbon dioxide are some of the volatiles being outgassed from mantle magma. Alpha decay of primordial radionuclides (and their decay products) produces the vast majority of the helium that continues to gas out of rocks on terrestrial planets.

==In a closed environment==
Outgassing can be significant if it collects in a closed environment where air is stagnant or recirculated. For example, new car smell consists of outgassed chemicals released by heat in a closed automobile. Even a nearly odorless material such as wood may build up a strong smell if kept in a closed box for months. There is some concern that plasticizers and solvents released from many industrial products, especially plastics, may be harmful to human health. Long-term exposure to solvent vapors can cause chronic solvent-induced encephalopathy (CSE). Outgassing toxic gases are of great concern in the design of submarines and space stations, which must have self-contained recirculated atmospheres.

==In construction==
The outgassing of small pockets of air near the surface of setting concrete can lead to permanent holes in the structure (called bugholes) that may compromise its structural integrity.

<doc id="774581" wikidata="Q63053" url="?curid=774581" title="Hans Joachim von Zieten">
<text>Hans Joachim von Zieten, sometimes spelled Johann Joachim von Ziethen, (14 May 1699 – 26 January 1786), also known as &quot;Zieten aus dem Busch&quot;, was a cavalry general in the Prussian Army. He served in four wars and was instrumental in several victories during the reign of Frederick the Great, most particularly at Hohenfriedberg and Torgau. He is also well known for a raid into the Habsburg territories during the Second Silesian War, known as &quot;Zieten&#x27;s Ride&quot;. After engaging in a reputed 74 duels, and fighting in four wars, he died in his bed at the age of 86.

==Early life==
Zieten was born on 14 May 1699 in the hamlet of Wustrau, now part of Fehrbellin, in the Margraviate of Brandenburg. His father was Joachim Matthias (1657–1720) and his mother, Catharine Jurgass. The family had lived there for several hundred years; records show them founding a Latin School in the mid-fourteenth century. The property was small and the family referred to the ramshackle house as a calliope. His father shared the property with his brother, Hans Dietrich; when the brother died in 1693, the father owned the property outright, valued at 4,000 thalers. Zieten was the third of seven children; by 1720, when his father died, only four children remained. Wustrau came to Zieten and his three sisters. The estate was valued at 8,000 thalers, of which the maintenance of the mother had to be fulfilled and his sisters&#x27; inheritances and dowries paid. This left Zieten with about half of the value.

==Military career==

A neighbor, General von Schwendy of Buskow, took Zieten in 1715 as corporal in his regiment in Neuruppin. On 7 July 1722, Zieten became a cadet. Upon his appointment as governor of Spandau, Schwendy, who had been Zieten&#x27;s mentor, released his regiment to command of &quot;Generalmajor&quot; Kurt Christoph Graf von Schwerin. In a report to Frederick William I, Zieten was described as &quot;... very small, and of [too] weak [a] voice for commanding.&quot; This was sufficient for the so-called soldier-king, who was obsessed with tall men, to overlook Zieten in the promotions lists. On 28 July 1724, Zieten journeyed from Crossen, where his regiment was garrisoned, with a petition for promotion to the King, who then wrote on the margin of the petition that Zieten &quot;shall have his dismissal.&quot; Zieten retired to his estates. Two years later, during a stay in Berlin, Zieten heard of the doubling of the dragoon regiment of Wuthenow and obtained a position as lieutenant in this regiment. In 1727, after an argument with his captain (&quot;Rittmeister&quot;), he was condemned to a one-year imprisonment on the fortress of Königsberg for disobedience. After returning from the fortress, Zieten challenged the &quot;Rittmeister&quot; to a duel and he was subsequently cashiered. He returned to Wustrau.

By 1730, on the recommendation of General Wilhelm Dietrich von Buddenbrock, the supposedly rehabilitated Zieten entered the newly formed &quot;Freikompanie&quot; (independent company) of hussars at Potsdam. On 1 March 1732, a second company of the Hussars was created, and Zieten was appointed as its chief and promoted to the &quot;Rittmeister&quot; with 50 thalers a month&#x27;s salary. In summer 1732, Zieten was given four weeks of arrest for an offense. In 1735, Frederick William appointed Zieten as the head of a hussar company, and sent him to the Imperial Army on the Rhine, where he participated in the Rhine campaign. Károly József Batthyány, the Austrian hussars&#x27; superintendent, served as his mentor in the fighting against France. At that time, the Austrians were the reputed masters of light cavalry work. His next promotion, to major took place on 29 January 1736.

In 1737 Zieten married the 33-year-old Judith von Jürgaß. His eldest daughter came from this marriage. Shortly before the wedding, he dueled with his superintendent, Lieutenant Colonel Alexander Ludwig von Wurmburg. Both were severely wounded.

==Service to Frederick the Great==
In 1741, at the onset of the First Silesian War (War of Austrian Succession), Zieten was a major and squadron leader. On 10 May 1741 he distinguished himself in combat with the Austrians at the Battle of Strehlen. He was promoted to lieutenant colonel in the Life hussar regiment and received the Order Pour le Mérite.

Zieten met his old teacher, Batthyány, during the First Silesian War and defeated him at the Battle of Rothschloss. The chivalrous Austrian sent him a complimentary letter a few days later, and General von Winterfeldt, who had been in command at Rothschloss, reported upon his conduct so favorably that Frederick marked him for future high command. Within a year he was colonel and proprietor of the newly formed Hussar Regiment, the Zieten Hussars, the second Hussar Regiment. In the Moravian foray of the following year, Zieten and his hussars penetrated almost to Vienna, and in the retreat to Silesia he was constantly employed with the rearguard.

Although upon his rejoining the military in 1730 as a &quot;rehabilitated&quot; officer, Zieten&#x27;s temperament had not wholly reformed. With several contemporaries, he maintained a running rivalry with Hans Karl von Winterfeldt, one of Frederick&#x27;s trusted confidantes. It had its origins in simultaneous promotions to colonel following the Battle of Rothschloss. Although Zieten was the older in years and service, and had actually been in command at the battle, he and Winterfeldt were promoted together. Zieten resented the rapid promotion of his junior. The animosity was perpetuated by Frederick&#x27;s long-standing trust of Winterfeldt, who had stood by him during the Katte Affair.

===Zieten&#x27;s ride===
In the winter of 1741–1742, and later during the short peace between the first and second Silesian wars, Zieten was engaged in the reorganization of Prussian cavalry. In 1743 he had his family house, the old &quot;Kaluppe&quot;, demolished, and began construction of a new, stately mansion in Wustrau. During the short peace, the hussars, like the rest of the Prussian cavalry, had undergone a complete transformation. To their discipline they had added the dash and skirmishing qualities of the best irregulars, and the Prussian hussars were considered the best of their kind in Europe. In 1743 the Zieten hussars adopted the distinctive tiger-skin pelisse for their parade uniforms, with company officers wearing fur caps with heron feathers and field officers using an eagles&#x27; wing.

In 1744, Zieten advanced with the avant-garde of the Prussian army in Bohemia to Budejovice. On his own initiative at Moldau, the colonel, with his red-uniform Hussar Regiment No. 2, forced a larger enemy&#x27;s force into its knees. Zieten covered the retreat behind the Elbe, and on 12 October, he fell into a violent ambush at Moldau. In this year the nickname, &quot;Zieten aus den Busch&quot; (Zieten of the bush) was born.

On 20 May 1745, he and his hussars distinguished themselves with a daring nocturnal passage past an Austrian corps of 20,000 men. Zieten led the famous &quot;Zietenritt&quot; (Zietenride) around the enemy&#x27;s lines to deliver the King&#x27;s order to a distant detachment. Two weeks later, at Hohenfriedberg on 4 June, the Zieten Hussars distinguished themselves for the first time in a battle. Before the Battle of Hennersdorf in November, the Zieten Hussars shadowed the Imperial army, waiting to pounce on them. At Hennersdorf, Zieten repulsed the sudden and unexpected assault of the Austro-Saxons; Winterfeldt arrived on the field in time to take a decisive part in the victory. Once again the rivals had to share their laurels, and Zieten actually wrote to the king in disparagement of Winterfeldt, receiving in reply a full and generous recognition of his own worth and services, coupled with the curt remark that the king intended to employ General von Winterfeldt in any way that he thought fit.
The victory at Hennersdorf ended the Second Silesian War. After the Treaty of Dresden, the daily routine of peacetime military service began to drag his spirits down. At times, the opinionated Zieten fell into disgrace with the King, who, in Zieten&#x27;s opinion, did not sufficiently support him. Zieten separated himself from the court, and grumbled to Frederick from his estate. In March 1756, his wife died and the aging general began to be plagued by the gout.

==Seven Years&#x27; War==

Zieten was promoted to &quot;generalleutnant&quot; and took part in the Battle of Reichenberg in 1757 and again at the Battle of Prague. On 5 May 1757, he received the Order of the Black Eagle. In the Battle of Kolín he commanded the advance guard and was then assigned to Duke August Wilhelm Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel-Bevern, who was given the command in Silesia. On 24 November 1757, he led the rest of the army past Glogau to Liegnitz to join Frederick&#x27;s army; he subsequently distinguished himself in the Battle of Leuthen on 5 December, by helping to run down the Austrian left flank. At the Battle of Hochkirch, his cavalry, and that of Seydlitz, provided the rear guard for the Prussian withdrawal. During the attack at Domstadt, he could not prevent the loss of a large supply convoy. During the Battle of Liegnitz on 15 August 1760, he managed to keep the Austrian main army at bay so that it could not participate in the battle. Zieten was promoted to general of cavalry. He made one of the few tactical mistakes of his career early in the Battle of Torgau, 3 November 1760, when he misdirected an attack against the Austrian troops; he made up for this error when he and his hussars stormed the Süptitzer heights.

Finally, it was Zieten who, in 1761, took the King out of a deep spiritual crisis while the army was entrenched at Bunzelwitz. Until the end of the war, he was repeatedly entrusted with the supreme command of the Prussian army in the absence of the king. By the end of the war, Zieten belonged to the elite of the kingdom and the inner circle of friends of the monarch.

==Aging years==
After the Seven Years&#x27; War, Zieten retired from active service, widely considered a hero. During the War of the Bavarian Succession, Frederick forbade him to go, so he stayed on his estate at Wustrau with his niece, Johanna von Blumenthal, whose son was serving in his regiment. During this period she gathered his reminiscences for a biography.

In the subsequent years of peace, the old army commander remained a tireless instructor of his now legendary Hussar regiment. In his last years of life, Zieten alternated between Berlin, where he bought a house in 1763 on Kochstrasse No. 61–62. and on his property at Wustrau, where he devoted himself mainly to charity. At the same time, he worked with great care to improve his property. He enjoyed the special trust of Frederick, who frequently visited &quot;his old father Zieten.&quot; In one visit with the King, at Sanssouci, after a long conversation, the King ordered a chair to be placed on which he invited the 85-year-old man to sit. Despite his infirmities, Zieten refused to sit in the presence of the monarch; the King said: &quot;Sit down, Zieten, or I will go away.&quot;

On 26 January 1786, Zieten died in his bed in Berlin, a remarkable age considering his hair-trigger temper and his reputed 74 duels. He was buried on 31 January 1786 on the Wustrau cemetery next to the village church. His estate was valued at 65,057 thalers. Apart from property at Wustrau, he left no fortune. The furniture of the Berlin house had to be auctioned after his death, and his widow was only freed from debt by a gift from King Frederick of ten thousand thalers.

==Marriages and children==

From his first marriage with Judith von Jürgaß (1703–19 March 1756) (married on 5 November 1737) came a daughter, Johanna (1747–7 June 1829). She married Karl von Jürgaß (1702–19 March 1756), the son of Joachim von Jürgaß and Luise von Zieten.

After the death of his first wife, he married on 24 August 1764 to Hedwig von Platen (1738–6 September 1818). His only son, Friedrich von Zieten (6 October 1765–29 June 1854), whose baptism Frederick witnessed, was first a captain of hussars and from 1800–1824 councilor of Ruppin. In 1840 he was raised to the nobility by Frederick William II of Prussia. He died in 1854, unmarried, and was buried in the local cemetery.

With the death of the last male heir, the property and title moved from the Zieten family to the line of Schwerin, due to the marriage of one of his granddaughters, Karoline Albertine Luise Wilhelmine Emilie von Zieten (22 April 1806–24 February 1853) to Albert Ludwig Wilhelm von Schwerin (17 June 1801–27 October 1865). Their children inherited the property and title.

Another famous member of the Hussars-Zieten, Hans Count von Zieten, is only remotely related to Hans Joachim.

== Memorials ==
In 1794 Frederick William II placed a monument to Zieten in Berlin on the Wilhelmplatz (Berlin-Mitte). It was first created by Johann Gottfried Schadow in marble and replaced in 1857 with a bronze cast by August Kiß. It stands today on the Zietenplatz on the corner Wilhelmstraße and Mohrenstraße (Berlin) next to the monument of Leopold I, the Old Dessauer. A similar one stands at Rupppin See.
Zieten&#x27;s name is on the Equestrian statue of Frederick the Great in Berlin (1851), and a full-sized relief of him stands at the corner of the statue; in addition, built between 1981 and 1983, the National People&#x27;s Army barracks in Beelitz bore his name, as well as Zietenstraße in Düsseldorf and the Zietenring in Wiesbaden, a street in Lünen, also bear his name. From 1936 to 1945, Göttingen had the Zieten barracks and the Zieten Terrace; Pietrowice (German: Peterwitz) in the rural community of Głubczyce (German: Leobschütz) in Silesia was called Zietenbusch from 1936 to 1945.

<text>António dos Santos Ramalho Eanes (born 25 January 1935) is a Portuguese general and politician who was the 16th president of Portugal from 1976 to 1986.

==Background==
Born at Alcains, Castelo Branco, he is the son of Manuel dos Santos Eanes, a general contractor, and Maria do Rosário Ramalho.

==Political career==

After a long military career in the Portuguese Colonial Wars, Eanes was stationed in Portuguese Angola when the 25 April revolution of 1974 took place. He joined the Movimento das Forças Armadas (MFA or Armed Forces Movement) and after returning to Portugal was made president of RTP (Portuguese public television). He ordered the military operations against the pro-communist radical faction of the MFA on 25 November 1975, an event known as the 25 de Novembro, ending that year&#x27;s &quot;hot summer&quot; (&quot;Verão quente&quot;).

In 1976 he was elected President of Portugal. At the end of 1980 he was re-elected, serving until March 1986. After his presidency, he headed the Democratic Renewal Party (), and continued to support the Social Democratic Party (PSD) minority government until 1987. He resigned in 1987 after being defeated by PSD in the legislative election.

He is a member of the Portuguese Council of State, as a former elected president of Portugal.

Eanes is one of the most admired and respected figures in Portuguese public life due to his extreme humility and sense of civic duty. He once refused the honorary title of Marshal, since he considered the title unnecessary. More recently, in February of 2025 he refused a 100,000 euro prize because &quot;the Fatherland does not owe anyone anything&quot;. Years before Eanes had also refused to receive over one million euro in backpay from his military service.

<doc id="774590" wikidata="Q698063" url="?curid=774590" title="Maastricht Aachen Airport">
<text>Maastricht Aachen Airport is a major cargo hub and regional passenger airport in Beek in Limburg, the Netherlands, located northeast of Maastricht and northwest of Aachen, Germany. It is the second-largest hub for cargo flights in the Netherlands. As of 2022, the airport had a passenger throughput of 266,000 and handled 108,000 tons of cargo.

The Maastricht Upper Area Control Centre (MUAC) of the European Organisation for the Safety of Air Navigation (EUROCONTROL) is also located at the airport.

==History==

===Pre-World War II===
Plans for an airport in southern Limburg date back as far as 1919, with various locations being considered. Years of debate among various municipalities over the location and funding of the airport delayed its construction. In July 1939, the Limburg provincial government agreed to financially back the airport, however, the start of World War II meant the plans were put on hold once more.

===Advanced Landing Ground Y-44===

After the allied invasion of Normandy, the USAAF Ninth Air Force, specifically the IX Engineer Command, was tasked with constructing temporary airfields close to the advancing front. The area around Maastricht was liberated in 1944. In October 1944, the advance headquarters of the XIX Tactical Air Command and the 84th and 303rd Fighter Wings were moved to Maastricht to keep up with the Ninth Army.

Because of the proximity to the new headquarters, the decision was made to create a temporary airfield between the towns of Beek, Geulle and Ulestraten. Several orchards which had suffered damage from a tank battle were commandeered and cleared. Rubble from the nearby town of Geleen, which had been unintentionally bombed in 1942, was used to level the area.

The runway was and reinforced with pierced steel planks.

The field was built in less than 2 months and was operational on 22 March 1945, and was designated Y-44.

The first unit to be based at the field was the 31st Tactical Reconnaissance Squadron, flying the F-6, a reconnaissance version of the P-51 Mustang. The unit arrived on 22 March 1945.

As Nazi Germany was rapidly collapsing, the front was already well into Germany by the time the field was ready, and no direct combat sorties were operated from Y-44. 31st TRS was moved to Y-80 near Wiesbaden on 19 April 1945.

====Units operating at the field====
*31st Tactical Reconnaissance Squadron, F-6 Mustang (22 March 1945 – 19 April 1945 )
*39th Photographic Reconnaissance Squadron, F-5 Lightning (2 April 1945 – 20 April 1945)
*67th Tactical Reconnaissance Group
**155th Photographic Reconnaissance Squadron (Night), F-3 (4 April 1945 – 10 July 1945)
*387th Bombardment Group (Medium)
**556, 557, 558 and 559th Squadrons, B-26 Marauder (4 May 1945) – 30 May 1945

===After World War II===
Authority over what was to become known as Beek airfield (&quot;vliegveld Beek&quot;), was officially transferred to the Dutch government on 1 August 1945. It was decided to keep it open rather than re-open the pre-war debate over the location of an airport in the Maastricht area. The first civilian aircraft landed on 26 September 1945 and were operated by the &quot;Regeeringsvliegdienst&quot;, a government service with the purpose of carrying government officials and other people with urgent business, because the war had left many roads and railroads heavily damaged. The service used six de Havilland Dragon Rapides made available by the British government.

In 1946, the service was taken over by KLM, using DC-3 Dakotas. However, as repairs to the Dutch infrastructure progressed, demand for the service dropped and it was stopped in 1949. The first semi-permanent airport terminal was completed in 1947. The runway was paved in 1949, and a second paved runway was completed in 1950. In 1951, an agreement between the airport and the Dutch Air Force allowed for rapid expansion of the facilities. Runway 04/22 was lengthened to 1,850 m (6,070 ft), and permanent runway lighting was installed in 1960.

===1950s and 1960s===
The late 1950s and early 1960s brought significant expansion in commercial operations at the airport. Operators included KLM, Airnautical, Skytours, Euravia, Tradair and Transair. The airport was also used as an intermediate stop for services from London and Manchester to Switzerland, Austria, Italy and Yugoslavia. A local airline based at the airport, &quot;Limburg Airways&quot;, had a contract with the &quot;International Herald Tribune&quot; for distributing the newspaper&#x27;s European edition, which was printed in Paris. Limburg Airways was taken over by Martin&#x27;s Air Charter (now Martinair) in 1962.

A promotion campaign by the Dutch tourist board for the nearby town of Valkenburg aan de Geul, aimed at British tourists, was highly successful and brought services by Invicta Airlines, Britannia and Channel Airways.

Domestic travel picked up as well, and newly created NLM CityHopper started to operate a service between Maastricht and Amsterdam Schiphol in 1966. The service would continue after KLM acquired NLM in 1992, and would last until 2008. When it was cancelled, it was the last remaining domestic service in the Netherlands.

An ILS system, which allows landings in poor weather, was built in 1967, for runway 22 only.

===1970s===
In 1973, the airport was expanded again to handle bigger aircraft. The main runway was lengthened to 2500 m (8,200 ft), taxiways were widened, and aprons were enlarged. This mostly offset the negative effects of the 1973 oil crisis, passenger volume remained the same and cargo operations expanded.

The international air traffic control area control centre for EUROCONTROL was built at the airport. It started operations on March 1, 1972.

===1980s===
Around 1980, the airport changed its name to &quot;Maastricht Airport&quot;. In 1983, the aging passenger terminal and air traffic control tower were replaced by new buildings The new terminal was later expanded and is still in use as of 2010.

On 14 May 1985, Pope John Paul II held an open-air mass for 50,000 people at the airport, as part of his visit to the Netherlands.

====Plan for an east–west runway====
In 1981, a development plan for the airport recommended constructing a 3,500m east–west runway to facilitate growth in cargo operations, particularly during the night hours. The new runway would greatly reduce noise impact over the towns of Beek, Meerssen and the city of Maastricht. Although some night operations are allowed (including distribution of the European edition of &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot;), runway length limits intercontinental operations. The Dutch government initially approved plans for the runway in 1985, however, the new runway would mean increased noise over other towns and parts of Belgium as well, and the final decision was delayed. As the new east–west runway would require substantial investment, it would only be profitable if night operations were permitted and increasingly the debate became focused on whether or not night flights should be allowed. Successive cabinets could not reach a final decision, and in 1998, after some 25 years of debate and postponement, the plan was aborted altogether.

===1990–2009===
In 1992, the Belgian town of Tongeren became shareholder of the airport. Two years later, the board of trade or chamber of commerce of the nearby German city of Aachen became shareholder. This interest eventually became prominent and in October 1994 the airport&#x27;s name was changed to &quot;Maastricht-Aachen Airport&quot;.

In July 2004, a 100% share in the airport was acquired by OmDV, a consortium of airport investment company &quot;Omniport&quot; and the construction company &quot;Dura Vermeer&quot;, making it the first fully privatised airport in the Netherlands.

Substantial investments in the airport infrastructure have been made since the privatization. Between August and October 2005, the runway was resurfaced and renamed to 03/21 (from 04/22) to compensate for changes in the Earth&#x27;s magnetic field. The airport originally had two runways; the second (shorter, ) runway (07/25) was closed and removed to make room for a new cargo terminal and additional aircraft maintenance facilities. Construction of the new facilities started in April 2008.

On 7 May 2005, Air Force One carrying US president George W. Bush landed at the airport. Bush visited the Netherlands American Cemetery in nearby Margraten the next day.

The instrument landing system (ILS) for runway 21 was upgraded to category III in 2008, which allows landings in very low visibility conditions. Amsterdam Airport Schiphol is the only other airport in the Netherlands that has category III ILS.

===2010s===
In March 2011, the airport was certified to handle the upcoming Boeing 747-8, as two of the airport&#x27;s major airlines—Cargolux and AirBridge Cargo—have placed orders for this aircraft.

Ryanair announced on July 3, 2012, that Maastricht will become a new Ryanair base from December 2012, the first on Dutch soil, with one Boeing 737-800 being based at the airport and three new routes being launched: Dublin, London-Stansted and Treviso.

In late October 2012, start-up Dutch airline, Maastricht Airlines, announced plans to base six Fokker 50 aircraft at the airport, initially operating to Berlin, Munich, and Amsterdam, before adding Copenhagen, Paris Charles de Gaulle and Southend in 2014. This did not happen and the company declared bankruptcy.

Also in 2013, the airport was helped by the province with a 4.5 million euro contribution. The airport was very close to bankruptcy during this period. Later on, in March 2014, the same province of Limburg believed that closure was never an option. They decided that they would like to take over the airport.

In December 2013, a spokesperson of the airport confirmed the closure of the Ryanair base from March 2014, entailing the ending of the Bergamo, Brive, Dublin, London-Stansted and Málaga flights.

In 2017, Corendon Dutch Airlines announced that they would open a base on the airport with one aircraft based in summer 2018. In late 2018 renovations started on the passenger terminal. Also, freight carriers as Emirates SkyCargo and Saudia Cargo found their way to the airport, while Turkish Airlines Cargo, Silk Way Airlines and Sky Gates Airlines further expanded their operations in Maastricht. Meanwhile, both Corendon Dutch Airlines and Ryanair announced that they would expand their number destinations. Corendon Dutch Airlines even based a second aircraft during the summer season.

==Aircraft movements==

The number of aircraft movements decreased significantly between 2005 and 2007 compared to previous years due to relocation of a major Dutch flight school, the &quot;Nationale Luchtvaartschool&quot;, nowadays better known as CAE Oxford Aviation Academy. The flight school, which was originally based at this airport, moved all flight operations to Évora Airport in Portugal. In the summer of 2007, flight training at the airport resumed as the &quot;Stella Aviation Academy&quot; moved into the facilities previously used by the NLS.

In 2009, there were a total of 40,621 aircraft movements, up 13.9% from 2008. In 2008, there were a total of 35,668 aircraft movements, up 83.4% from 2007. In 2007, there were a total of 19,454 aircraft movements, up 35% from 2006.

<text>Thomas William Courtney (August 17, 1933 – August 22, 2023) was an American athlete and winner of two gold medals in the 1956 Olympic Games.

Born in South Orange, New Jersey, and raised in Livingston, New Jersey, Courtney&#x27;s father was a former minor-league baseball player.

Courtney was a top runner at James Caldwell High School and came into national prominence while a student at Fordham University, winning the 1955 NCAA 880 yd (805 m) title.

An AAU champion in 400 m at 1956 and in 880 yd (805 m) at 1957 and 1958, Courtney had a memorable duel with Derek Johnson of Great Britain in the 1956 Olympic 800 m final. Johnson took a narrow lead with 40 meters to go, but finally Courtney won by 0.13 seconds, and collapsed with exhaustion. He later wrote:

: &quot;It was a new kind of agony for me. My head was exploding, my stomach ripping and even the tips of my fingers ached. The only thing I could think was, &#x27;If I live, I will never run again.&#x27;&quot;

The medal ceremony had to be delayed for an hour while he and Johnson recovered. But Courtney did run again. He was the anchorman on the gold medal 4 × 400 m relay team. He also set a world record of 1:46.8 in the 880 yd (805 m) on May 24, 1957.

Courtney received a bachelor&#x27;s degree from Fordham University in 1955, and since 1994, the (autographed) varsity jacket from his college track days hangs in a display case along with similar memorabilia from other great Fordham athletes, such as Vince Lombardi.

Courtney&#x27;s victory was the last in a series of four straight 800 meter gold medals by the U.S. and the seventh overall to that point in time. He could be considered the end of the dynasty. Since then, the USA has only had one other male winner, Dave Wottle in 1972 and have only won four bronze medals.

Courtney would later earn his MBA from Harvard Business School.

Courtney died of amyloidosis at an assisted living facility in Naples, Florida, on August 22, 2023, at the age of 90.

<text>George Howard Earle III (December 5, 1890December 30, 1974) was an American politician and diplomat from Pennsylvania. He was a member of the prominent Earle and Van Leer families and the 30th governor of Pennsylvania from 1935 to 1939. Earle was one of just two Democrats who served as governor of Pennsylvania between the Civil War and World War II.

The son of prominent attorney George Howard Earle Jr., Earle worked in his family&#x27;s sugar business after graduating from Harvard University. During World War I, he commanded , a submarine chaser which was also his private yacht. Though raised a Republican, Earle joined the Democrats out of dissatisfaction with the Republican Party&#x27;s handling of the Great Depression. He campaigned for Franklin D. Roosevelt in the 1932 presidential election and served as the U.S. Minister to Austria from 1933 to 1934. In this role, he warned the Roosevelt administration of the rising danger presented by Nazi Germany.

Earle defeated Republican William A. Schnader in the 1934 Pennsylvania gubernatorial election. As governor, he introduced an ambitious &quot;Little New Deal&quot; that sought to combat the effects of the Great Depression. Among other policies, his administration created a centralized Department of Public Assistance, eliminated the private police forces operated by several coal and steel companies, began construction of the Pennsylvania Turnpike, instituted Pennsylvania&#x27;s first gasoline and cigarette tax, and established a forty-hour work week. The Little New Deal made Earle one of the most popular politicians in the country.

Earle sought election to the United States Senate in 1938, but he was defeated by incumbent Republican Senator James J. Davis. Earle was appointed as the Minister to Bulgaria in 1940 and served as a special emissary to the Balkans during World War II. He compiled a report blaming the Katyn massacre of Polish intelligentsia on the Soviet Union, but this report was suppressed. After the war, he served as assistant governor of American Samoa. He retired from public office and died in 1974.

==Early life==
Earle was born in Devon, Pennsylvania to George Howard Earle Jr. and Catharine Hansell French, a wealthy family that traced its lineage in America to the arrival of the &quot;Mayflower&quot;. His grandmother Mrs. Frances (&quot;Fanny&quot;) Van Leer was a member of one of the first Pennsylvania families, the Van Leer family and his great-grandfather Samuel Van Leer played an important role in the American Revolutionary War. He received a degree from Harvard University and subsequently worked abroad in a family-owned sugar business. He enlisted in the military in 1916 and was assigned to the Mexican border during the Pancho Villa Expedition. After the United States entered World War I, Earle commanded , a submarine chaser which was also his private yacht. He earned the Navy Cross in 1918 after averting a fatal explosion. After the war, Earle returned to private business, particularly in the sugar industry. Though raised as a Republican, Earle joined the Democratic Party over disillusionment with the Republican Party&#x27;s handling of the Great Depression. After campaigning for Franklin Roosevelt in the 1932 election, Earle served as Ambassador to Austria from July 24, 1933 until March 25, 1934. Earle looked warily upon the Nazi Party, and warned the FDR Administration of the potential danger of Nazi Germany.

==Governorship==
Although Pennsylvania had not elected a Democratic governor in over forty years, Earle defeated Republican Attorney General William A. Schnader in the 1934 Pennsylvania gubernatorial election. Though Earle faced a split legislature in the first half of his term, his party gained control of both chambers of the Pennsylvania legislature in the 1936 election. An ardent Roosevelt admirer, Earle rolled out an ambitious &quot;Little New Deal&quot;, which resulted in the introduction of a record 3514 bills during the 1935-36 session of the Pennsylvania General Assembly. His administration created a centralized Department of Public Assistance that was designed to ensure uniform allocation of relief payments. Earle&#x27;s government also sought to ameliorate ongoing labor strife by increasing union bargaining rights and eliminating the private police forces operated by many of the influential coal and steel companies. Pennsylvania Turnpike construction also began during his tenure. Other bills passed include Pennsylvania&#x27;s first gasoline and cigarette tax, teacher tenure, and a maximum forty-hour work week. Earle&#x27;s administration relaxed Pennsylvania&#x27;s Blue laws, passed the nation&#x27;s first milk control law, and outlawed company police forces hired by mining companies.

Earle&#x27;s &quot;Little New Deal&quot; earned him a place on the cover of &quot;Time&quot; magazine in 1937, and a Gallup poll that same year saw him named the nation&#x27;s third most popular Democrat (after the president and vice president). However, Earle also became known for his mercurial temperament and his administration was plagued by high-profile corruption charges involving his top officials. Earle&#x27;s poor relationship with the state&#x27;s judicial hierarchy resulted in one of his central policy goals, the imposition of a graduated income tax, being declared unconstitutional. Earle, who was constitutionally ineligible to run for a second consecutive term as governor, ran for the Senate in 1938, but lost to incumbent Republican James J. Davis. Earle&#x27;s loss to Davis coincided with a Republican landslide that saw Republicans re-gain control of the legislature and governorship. Pennsylvania would not elect another Democratic governor until 1954.

==Post-governorship==
Earle was appointed Minister to Bulgaria on February 14, 1940, and served until December 13, 1941. 

During World War II, he served again in the United States Navy, this time as a lieutenant commander and as a special emissary to the Balkans. In 1943 Earl was the special envoy of the President as naval attaché in neutral Istanbul. He proposed a plan that he believed might bring the war in Europe to an early end. The German ambassador in Istanbul Franz von Papen and the head of Abwehr Wilhelm Canaris had secretly proposed a coup against Adolf Hitler that would end with Hitler turned over to the US as a war criminal, but the plot was not approved by the US government.

In 1944, President Roosevelt assigned Earle to compile information on the Katyń massacre, the massacre of the Polish intelligentsia by the Soviet government. Earle did so, using contacts in Bulgaria and Romania, and concluded that the Soviet Union was guilty. After consulting with Elmer Davis, the director of the Office of War Information, Roosevelt rejected Earle&#x27;s conclusion, saying that he was convinced of the responsibility of Nazi Germany, and ordered Earle&#x27;s report suppressed. At this time, the United States and Soviet Union were still fighting Nazi Germany and Japan.
When Earle formally requested permission to publish his findings, the President gave him a written order to desist. 
Earle was reassigned and spent the rest of World War II in American Samoa.

After the war, Earle served as assistant governor of American Samoa, and then returned to the private sector. Ambassador Ralph Earle II is his son.

He died on December 30, 1974, and was interred at the Church of the Redeemer cemetery in Bryn Mawr, Pennsylvania.

<text>The laurel pigeon or white-tailed laurel pigeon (Columba junoniae) is a species of bird in the Columba genus in the family Columbidae (doves and pigeons). It is endemic to the Canary Islands, Spain, and resides in laurel forest habitat. It is the animal symbol of the island of La Gomera.

==Generality==
It is a pigeon which is endemic to some Canary islands. Its close relative and probable ancestor is the common wood pigeon. Despite its bulky, long-tailed appearance, this pigeon has a fast, direct flight.

The major cause of its population decline is habitat loss from forest clearance, but hunting and nest predation by introduced species and rats were also contributory factors. Protection of the laurel forests and an effective ban on hunting could enable numbers to increase, although this species is still declining and endangered.

==Description==
The laurel pigeon is a dark brown and grey bird of 40 cm; it resembles a very dark wood pigeon. The underparts are reddish, and the tail is pale grey with a broad, whitish terminal band. Extensive green gloss to rear crown and hindneck becoming pink on the upper mantle. The bill is pink with a white tip, and the eye is orange in color. The similar Canarian species, the Bolle&#x27;s pigeon or dark-tailed laurel pigeon &quot;Columba bollii&quot; has a pale grey subterminal band and blackish terminal band to tail.

A rare resident breeder in the mountain laurisilva and Canary pine forests, the laurel pigeon builds a stick nest in a tree. There it lays one white egg.

The flight is quick and performed by regular beats. An occasional sharp flick of the wings is characteristic of pigeons in general. Often, the bird takes off with a loud clattering. The call is a hoarse hiccuped cooing.

==Ecology==

It prefers areas with steep slopes, escarpments and gullies, where it occurs in dry forest, laurel forest and Canary pine forest, as well as cultivated areas. Nests are on the ground - in fissures, holes or small ledges, at the bases of trees, and under rocks or fallen tree trunks - in steep, rocky, shady areas with abundant shrubby vegetation. The breeding season varies between islands, but extends from January to September, with a peak between April–June. At least on Tenerife, breeding success appears to be low, as a consequence of intense nest predation.

Pigeons can breed from their first year, and nesting occurs throughout the year, although mainly from February to June. The displays are similar to those of the common wood pigeon; the male climbs quickly in flight, gives a loud wing-clap, and then glides down with his wings and tail spread. The display may be repeated two or three times before the bird returns to a perch. On the ground the male performs a bowing display with his neck inflated to show off the iridescent neck patches; meanwhile, the tail is raised, fanned, then closed again. This display is usually accompanied by calling. The nest is a typical pigeon construction, a flimsy structure of twigs and grasses usually placed high in the floor of canyon walls with much vegetation. Nestled among the crevices in rocks, in gullies of the hills. The usual clutch has a white egg one smooth white egg. Breeding success and nest predation have effects on the two Canarian endemic pigeons, Bolle&#x27;s laurel pigeon &quot;Columba bollii&quot; and white-tailed laurel pigeon &quot;Columba junoniae&quot;. Nest predation was the more important cause of nesting failure of both species (88%), but principally affecting the white-tailed laurel pigeon. It showed a greater predation on the ground than in trees and a lower predation in the February–March period than in June–July and September October. The abundance of predators, estimated by bait consumption, showed a similar seasonal pattern, while fruit availability decreased over time from the first to third period. Predators identified by automatic cameras showed that black rat &quot;Rattus rattus&quot; was the major nest predator of both pigeons. These general patterns of nest predation affect the white-tailed laurel pigeon which breeds on the ground mainly during April–July, much more than Bolle&#x27;s laurel pigeon, which breeds in trees especially in February–June. All seems to indicate that rats are the key factor causing the scarcity of the white-tailed laurel pigeon on Tenerife.

The laurel pigeon is exclusively herbivorous. Nearly 60% of its diet is fruit, with most of the rest being leaves, and just 1% is flowers. The fruits of Til, Azores Laurel and &quot;Persea indica&quot;, and the fruits and leaves of small-leaved holly are the most frequently detected food items. Most seeds pass through the digestive system intact, apart from those of Azores Laurel, which are usually damaged. Fruit is the main component of the diet when it is readily available in autumn and winter, and leaves are consumed in spring and summer when fruits are scarce. In one study, 27% of the leaves consumed came from native trees, especially Small-leaved Holly, 61% from herbs and shrubs, and nearly 10% from introduced trees, mainly apples and peaches. This pigeon will feed in agricultural areas, where cabbage is the most commonly taken crop plant.

However, when the fruit crop of Til and Azores Laurel is poor, large numbers of pigeons may leave the forest to feed on cabbage, flowering cherries and vine shoots. Competition for food with rats can be significant in parts of the island.

==Distribution and habitat==

The laurel pigeon is endemic to the mountainous subtropical Atlantic west Canary islands, where it occurs on the islands of La Palma, La Gomera, Tenerife and El Hierro. In the 1980s, the population was estimated at 1,200-1,480 individuals, but more recent surveys have shown that it is more numerous, and more widely distributed. The largest subpopulation is found on La Palma, where it occurs across much of the northern half of the island. The species is common on La Gomera, where it is found primarily in the north, and also occurs patchily on the northern slopes of Tenerife. It has recently also been recorded on El Hierro; however, breeding there has not yet been confirmed3,4. Although the species was recently suspected to be declining on Tenerife. It mainly occurs on the northern slopes of the mountains, but smaller numbers are found in the south where suitable patches of laurel forest remain. Bones similar to those of a laurel pigeon have been found on neighbouring Gran Canaria, but it is unclear whether these remains stem from the white-tailed laurel pigeon or from Bolle&#x27;s pigeon. A program to (re)introduce the white-tailed laurel pigeon to this island commenced in 2012. 

The natural habitat is tall laurisilva forest or dense tree heaths which are cloud-covered for much of the year. The forests consist mainly of Azores laurel, &quot;Oreodaphne foetens&quot;, til, Madeira mahogany, Canary laurel, faya, lily of the valley tree and the picconia. The Trocaz pigeon prefers primary forests, but secondary growth is used for feeding, and agricultural land is also visited, especially at times of fruit shortage. Most of the pigeons are found below 1000 m (3300 ft), and their prime environment appears to be steep ravine-indented slopes along artificial watercourses, with the occasional large dead laurel tree and much tree heath. This species is highly mobile between different areas at different times of year.

It was very abundant when the islands were first colonised by humans, but was extirpated. The losses on the islands were largely due to deforestation for wood and to create agricultural and grazing land.

The exclusion of livestock from the native forest allows it to regenerate and create more suitable habitat. Some illegal hunting and poisoning continues because of the damage this pigeon can do to crops. Perhaps the main limiting factor on the rate at which the pigeon increases its numbers is eggs and young being taken by introduced black rats. It is now classed as Near Threatened on the IUCN Red List, an improvement on its Threatened status in 1988. This species is protected under the European Union Birds Directive, and the laurel forests under the Habitats Directive.

==Taxonomy==
The genus &quot;Columba&quot; is the largest within the pigeon family, and has the widest distribution. Its members are typically pale grey or brown, often with white head or neck markings or iridescent green or purple patches on the neck and breast. The neck feathers may be stiffened and aligned to form grooves. One of several subgroups within &quot;Columba&quot; consists of the widespread Eurasian common wood pigeon, Bolle&#x27;s pigeon, the Trocaz pigeon, and the African Afep pigeon. The three Macaronesian endemic pigeons, this species, Bolle&#x27;s and Trocaz, are thought to be derived from isolated island populations of &quot;C. palumbus&quot;.

The Atlantic archipelagos of the Canaries, Azores, and Madeira have a volcanic origin and they have never been part of a continent. The formation of Madeira started in the Miocene and the island was substantially complete by 700,000 years ago. At various times in the past, the major islands of these archipelagos were all colonised by ancestral wood pigeons, which evolved on their respective islands in isolation from the mainland populations. Mitochondrial and nuclear DNA sequences suggest that the ancestor of Bolle&#x27;s pigeon may have arrived in the Canaries about 5 mya, but an older lineage that gave rise to another Canarian endemic, the laurel pigeon, &quot;C. junoniae&quot;, may date from 20 mya. The most recent wood pigeon arrival on Macaronesia was that which gave rise to the subspecies &quot;&quot;.

The Trocaz pigeon was formally described in 1829 by Karl Heineken. He recognised it as different from the now-extinct local form of the Madeiran wood pigeon, a subspecies of the common wood pigeon. This is a monotypic species, although in the past the Canarian Bolle&#x27;s pigeon was sometimes regarded as a subspecies of the Trocaz pigeon.

<text>Charles Douville Coburn (June 19, 1877 – August 30, 1961) was an American actor and theatrical producer. He was nominated for a Best Supporting Actor Academy Award (&quot;Oscar&quot;) three times – for &quot;The Devil and Miss Jones&quot; (1941), &quot;The More the Merrier&quot; (1943) and &quot;The Green Years&quot; (1946) – winning for his performance in &quot;The More the Merrier&quot;. He was honored with a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame (in Hollywood, Los Angeles, California) in 1960 for his contribution to the film industry.

==Biography==

Coburn was born in Macon, Georgia, the son of Scots-Irish Americans Emma Louise Sprigman and Moses Douville Coburn. 

Growing up in Savannah, he started out at age 14 doing odd jobs at the local Savannah Theater, handing out programs, ushering, or being the doorman. By age 17 or 18, he was the theater manager. He later became an actor, making his debut on Broadway in 1901. Coburn formed an acting company with actress Ivah Wills in 1905. They married in 1906. In addition to managing the company, the couple performed frequently on Broadway. 

After his wife&#x27;s death in 1937, Coburn relocated to Los Angeles, California, and began film work. He won an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor for his role as a retired millionaire playing Cupid in &quot;The More the Merrier&quot; in 1943. He was also nominated for &quot;The Devil and Miss Jones&quot; in 1941 and &quot;The Green Years&quot; in 1946. Other notable film credits include &quot;Of Human Hearts&quot; (1938), &quot;The Lady Eve&quot; (1941), &quot;Kings Row&quot; (1942), &quot;The Constant Nymph&quot; (1943), &quot;Heaven Can Wait&quot; (1943), &quot;Wilson&quot; (1944), &quot;Impact&quot; (1949), &quot;The Paradine Case&quot; (1947), &quot;Everybody Does It&quot; (1950), &quot;Has Anybody Seen My Gal?&quot; (1952), &quot;Monkey Business&quot; (1952), &quot;Gentlemen Prefer Blondes&quot; (1953), and &quot;John Paul Jones&quot; (1959). He usually played comedic parts, but his roles in &quot;Kings Row&quot; and &quot;Wilson&quot; showed his dramatic versatility.

For his contributions to motion pictures, in 1960, Coburn was honored with a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 6268 Hollywood Boulevard.

==Political activity==

In the 1940s, Coburn served as vice president of the Motion Picture Alliance for the Preservation of American Ideals, a group opposed to leftist infiltration and proselytization in Hollywood during the Cold War.

Born and raised in the southern state of Georgia, Coburn was a member of the White Citizens&#x27; Council, which was part of a network of states&#x27; rights groups known as the Citizens&#x27; Councils. These groups were associated with their opposition to the Civil Rights movement.

A staunch Republican, Coburn supported Thomas Dewey in the 1944 United States presidential election.

==Personal life==
Coburn married Ivah Wills on January 29, 1906, in Atlanta, Georgia. They had six children. They were married until her death in 1937.

In the 1940s, Coburn made his home at the National Arts Club in New York City. His late wife&#x27;s mother lived there with him.

Coburn married Winifred Natzka on June 30, 1959, in Los Angeles. She was the widow of the New Zealand bass opera singer Oscar Natzka. They had one child, a daughter.

Coburn died of a heart attack on August 30, 1961, at age 84 in New York City. He was interred at Bonaventure Cemetery.

<doc id="774610" wikidata="Q7609132" url="?curid=774610" title="Stephen Early">
<text>Stephen Tyree Early (August 27, 1889 – August 11, 1951) was an American journalist and government official. He served as the third White House press secretary under Franklin D. Roosevelt from 1933 to 1945 and as the acting press secretary under President Harry S. Truman in 1950 after the sudden death of Charles Griffith Ross. Early served as press secretary longer than any other person.

==Career==
Early met Franklin D. Roosevelt while covering the 1912 Democratic National Convention as a reporter for the United Press. From 1913 to 1917 Early was the Associated Press correspondent covering the Navy Department, during which time his acquaintance with Roosevelt and Louis Howe grew.

After serving in World War I with an infantry regiment and the &quot;Stars and Stripes&quot; he returned to the United States and was asked by Roosevelt to be the advance man for the 1920 vice presidential campaign. After the election, Early returned to the Associated Press. In August 1923 Early covered the western trip of President Warren Harding in San Francisco and was the first newspaper man to report there that Harding had suddenly died. In 1927 he became the Washington representative of Paramount News, a newsreel company at the time.

=== Roosevelt administration ===
After the election of 1932, Franklin Roosevelt asked him to serve as one of the three White House Secretaries, responsible for press relations. Early held that post throughout the Roosevelt years. As press secretary, he served as spokesman and troubleshooter for the president and maintained an open-door policy with White House correspondents. Having been a reporter, he understood the news business and did his best to accommodate it. Early also helped persuade the White House Correspondents Association to issue press credentials to Harry McAlpin of the National Negro Publishers Association. In 1944, McAlpin became the first African American reporter to attend presidential press conferences.

He was also known to have had a temper. Less than a month before the 1940 presidential election, Early kneed a black police officer in the groin outside Madison Square Garden. Roosevelt had already been facing skepticism from black voters because of his failure to desegregate the military. Roosevelt responded days before the election by appointing the nation&#x27;s first black general, Benjamin O. Davis Sr., and announcing the creation of the Tuskegee Airmen.

=== Commercial and Defense appointments ===
In 1945, he became vice president of the Pullman Company He returned to the government as under secretary and later United States deputy secretary of defense from April 1949 to June 1950.

=== Truman administration ===
In December 1950, Early was briefly press secretary to President Truman, filling in after the sudden death of Charles G. Ross.

==Personal life==
Early died at George Washington Hospital on August 11, 1951. He had suffered a heart attack a week prior, and despite signs of recovery, had a turn for the worse. It was reported that he died at about one in the afternoon. Survivors included Helen Wrenn Early, whom he married in 1921, two sons and a daughter. Harry Truman issued a statement calling him &quot;an outstanding newspaper man&quot; and &quot;always on the side of President Roosevelt.&quot; Defense Secretary George Marshall said in a statement that he was &quot;very distressed&quot; at the news of Early&#x27;s death and that he &quot;served his country faithfully for many years.&quot; The full statements and other information on his life can be found in his &quot;New York Times&quot; obituary, printed on August 12, 1951.

In 1969, his widow donated his papers to the Franklin D. Roosevelt Presidential Library, where they could be accessed by the public.

<doc id="774618" wikidata="Q31840575" url="?curid=774618" title="Future Combat Air System">
<text>The Future Combat Air System (FCAS), (; ; ) is a European combat system of systems under development by Dassault Aviation, Airbus and Indra Sistemas. The FCAS will consist of a Next-Generation Weapon System (NGWS) as well as other air assets in the future operational battlespace. The NGWS&#x27;s components will be remote carrier vehicles (swarming drones) as well as a New Generation Fighter (NGF)—a planned sixth-generation jet fighter—that will possibly supersede France&#x27;s Rafale and Germany and Spain&#x27;s Typhoons.

A test flight of a demonstrator is expected around 2027 and entry into service around 2040.

== Contractors ==
Dassault will serve as prime contractor for the NGF, while Airbus will lead the development of accompanying remote carrier vehicles and the broader system&#x27;s supporting combat cloud. It will also be carrier-capable and will fly from the French Navy&#x27;s future aircraft carrier. Safran Aircraft Engines will be the prime contractor for the next-generation fighter aircraft engine, taking the lead in engine design and integration, while MTU Aero Engines, as the main partner for the first phase of research and technology, will take the lead in engine services.

Each country has designated a national industrial coordinator, Airbus for Germany, Indra for Spain and Dassault for France.

== History ==
The FCAS concept was developed in the frame of the European Technology Acquisition Programme (ETAP) that was started in 2001 as a co-operation between Germany, France, Great Britain, Italy, Sweden and Spain. The new FCAS concept was a System of Systems (SoS) approach combining manned and unmanned systems, combat aircraft and UCAV, to be more efficient in the envisaged future scenarios than operating with manned systems alone.

In 2017 Germany and Spain asked Airbus to start working on a proposal for a new fighter under the name Future Combat Air System (FCAS).

At the 2018 ILA Berlin Air Show, Dassault Aviation and Airbus announced an agreement to cooperate on the development of the FCAS.

In December 2018, the German Defence Ministry welcomed Spain&#x27;s expression of interest in the programme.

In June 2019 Spain joined the programme.

In June 2023, Belgium became an observer to the FCAS programme. The country is set to join the programme by June 2025.

In December 2019 Safran and MTU Aero Engines agreed on the foundation of a 50/50 joint venture that will be incorporated by the end of 2021 to manage the development, production, and the after-sales support activities of the new engine to power the NGF.

On 12 February 2020, the first phase (1A) of the research and development program was approved by the German parliament budget committee. It set up the industrial distribution of the first five subprograms.

== Development ==
=== Initial demonstrator ===
==== Phase 1A - Initial framework contract ====
Dassault, Airbus, together with their partners MTU Aero Engines, Safran, MBDA and Thales, were awarded the initial framework contract which launches the demonstrator phase. Beginning February 2020 it is expected to cover a period of 18 months of research and development. While it assigned different roles to the above-mentioned companies, Spain was left out:

* New Generation Fighter (NGF), with Dassault Aviation as prime contractor and Airbus as main partner
* Unmanned systems Remote Carrier (RC) with Airbus as prime contractor and MBDA as main partner
* Combat Cloud (CC) with Airbus as prime contractor and Thales as main partner
* Engine with Safran and MTU Aero Engines as main partner

==== Phase 1B ====
Additional suppliers will be involved.

<doc id="774621" wikidata="Q2654708" url="?curid=774621" title="Brightwell-cum-Sotwell">
<text>Brightwell-cum-Sotwell is a twin-village and civil parish in the Upper Thames Valley in South Oxfordshire. It lies between Didcot to the west and the historic market town of Wallingford to the east. In 1974 it was transferred from Berkshire to the county of Oxfordshire, and from Wallingford Rural District to the district of South Oxfordshire.

==History==
Brightwell and Sotwell were originally two separate villages, rural settlements whose inhabitants worked the land.

===Prehistory===
For thousands of years hunter-gatherers of the Thames Valley would have passed this way, stalking wild animals and gathering from the trees that grew on the greens and in this area. This good soil and the abundant water supply may have encouraged Iron Age farmers (1500 BC - AD 50) to settle in this area. The ramparts on Wittenham Clumps provide enduring evidence of Iron Age settlement in the area.

===Roman===
Evidence of a Roman road dating from about 43 CE, has been uncovered under the playing fields of the local primary school. Other finds include Roman coins and pottery.

===Medieval times===
The first written evidence of a village here comes from the various Saxon charters describing ownership of land in &quot;Beorhtanville&quot;, &quot;Suttanwille&quot; and &quot;Maccanie&quot;. In a charter of 854 Æthelwulf, King of Wessex granted Swithun, Bishop of Winchester, an estate of 30 hides at &quot;Brihtanwylle&quot; to help the bishop pay the expenses of entertaining distinguished foreign guests. Subsequently, William the Conqueror’s agents recorded in the Domesday Book in 1086 70 families and two mills in Brightwell and Sotwell, but where the mills stood and how they were powered is unknown. Within 50 years of Domesday, Brightwell Castle was involved in the civil war between King Stephen and his cousin Matilda. The exact site of this castle is unknown, but it probably lay within the moated areas of what later contained St Agatha&#x27;s/Brightwell manor house in Brightwell or Stonor Hayes manor house in Sotwell.

===Early modern times===
For the next 800 years Brightwell and Sotwell parishes only occasionally appear in recorded history. For example:
*1330 (circa) Thomas de Brayles, later Chancellor of the Irish Exchequer, appointed parish priest.
*1500 (&quot;circa&quot;) Prince Arthur (eldest son of Henry VII) stayed at Sotwell House.
*1507 Clerk in Holy Orders murdered in St Agatha&#x27;s.
*1649 Edward Hyde DD ejected from his living for being a Royalist.
*1666 Church collection for victims of the Great Fire of London.
*1726 Mrs Frances Riggins leaves a legacy &quot;for bread and ye schooling for ye poor of Slade End&quot;.
*1774-1849 Reverend Thomas Wintle. &quot;About 4 o&#x27;clock with my neighbours at ye Red Lion where they dined at the expense of ye parish and myself and then set again to mark the boundaries&quot;
*1781 King George III rode through the village returning from a stag hunt.
*1785 A Sunday school set up by the Reverend Wintle.
*1811 Inclosure act for Brightwell, the (51 Geo. 3. c. lxxxiii), is passed.

With the coming of the Industrial Revolution and the Victorian era, the village had some significant philanthropists who worked hard for the good of the villagers:
*Reverend Marmaduke Thompson - building of Brightwell National School in the village.
*Reverend James Haldane Stewart - building of the new village school, which is now the village hall. Forming a night school for adult parishioners. Haldane House, in Bakers Lane, is named after this philanthropist.
*Farmer Edward Fairthorne - Reading Room and recreation ground for the villagers. Scholarships for promising boys to go to Wallingford Grammar School.
*Miss Augusta Fairthorne - endowment of the Free Church.

===Modern times===
The War Memorial records the loss of villagers in the armed services in the two world wars. In the second half of the 20th century there was significant expansion of the villages and in 1948 the villages of Brightwell and Sotwell were brought together as one civil parish. In 1949 the Greenmere estate was built and later, estates were also built at Kings Orchard, Monks Mead and Datchet Green. There are no immediate plans for any major development, though around 2011 there was some controversy regarding a plan to build some 800 houses between the village and Wallingford. The plan to develop on this area was eventually abandoned, in the face of local pressure, in favour of a new development on the Hithercroft.

==Notable buildings and structures==
A walk around the narrow village streets will reveal many houses still standing which date back to Tudor times and beyond. The oldest building is probably Woodleys (Old Nursery Lane), with other examples such as Dobson&#x27;s (Sotwell Street), The Old Priory (Little Lane), Middle Farm and Abbots House (both Church Lane - formerly Great Lane) and Smalls House (Mackney). Brightwell Manor is a Grade II listed building, with a mid 17th-century half-timbered structure extended by an 18th-century stone frontage. 

The Church of England parish churches of St Agatha (Brightwell) and St James (Sotwell) would have been at the centre of village affairs, surrounded by many thatched cottages with cob, or wattle and daub, walls. The original building dates back to the 12th century, the tower was rebuilt in about 1797. The church was restored in the 19th century, with an organ chamber added in about 1903. 

==Notable residents==
*Thomas de Brayles, judge and Crown official, was parish priest here in the 1330s.
* George Warner Allen, artist
*Dr Edward Bach, Mount Vernon centre for education and information. The home and workplace of Bach in the last years of his life, where he completed his research into the Bach flower remedies.
*Sir Francis Bernard, 1st Baronet, governor of the provinces of New Jersey and Massachusetts Bay, his uncompromising policies were instrumental in the events leading to the American Revolution.
*Charlie Brooker, British comedy writer, grew up in Brightwell-cum-Sotwell.
*Sir William Glock, Director of Music at the BBC and head of the Proms concerts, also lived in the village and died there in 2000.
*William Ralph Inge, a Dean of St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral in London lived in Brightwell Manor. His family continued to reside there until the early 1970s.
*Boris Johnson, former Prime Minister, has lived in Brightwell Manor with his current family since 2023

<doc id="774640" wikidata="Q234121" url="?curid=774640" title="Muntjac">
<text>Muntjacs ( ), also known as the barking deer or rib-faced deer, are small deer of the genus Muntiacus native to South Asia and Southeast Asia. Muntjacs are thought to have begun appearing 15–35 million years ago, with remains found in Miocene deposits in France, Germany and Poland. Most are listed as least-concern species or Data Deficient by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), although others such as the black muntjac, Bornean yellow muntjac, and giant muntjac are vulnerable, near threatened, and critically endangered, respectively.

==Name==
The present name is a borrowing of the Latinized form of the Dutch , which was borrowed from the Sundanese &quot;mencek&quot; (). The Latin form first appeared as in Zimmerman in 1780. An erroneous alternative name of &quot;Mastreani deer&quot; has its origins in a mischievous Wikipedia entry from 2011 and is incorrect.

==Distribution==
The present-day species are native to Asia and can be found in India, Sri Lanka, Myanmar, Vietnam, the Indonesian islands, Taiwan and Southern China. Their habitat includes areas of dense vegetation, rainforests, monsoon forests and they like to be close to a water source. They are also found in the lower Himalayas (Terai regions of Nepal and Bhutan).

An invasive population of Reeves&#x27;s muntjac exists in the United Kingdom and in some areas of Japan. In the United Kingdom, wild muntjac descended from escapees from the Woburn Abbey estate around 1925. Muntjac have expanded rapidly, and are present in most English counties and also in Wales, although they are less common in the north-west. The British Deer Society in 2007 found that muntjac deer had noticeably expanded their range in the UK since 2000. Specimens appeared in Northern Ireland in 2009, and in the Republic of Ireland in 2010. 

Inhabiting tropical regions, the deer have no seasonal rut, and mating can take place at any time of year; this behaviour is retained by populations introduced to temperate countries.

==Description==
===Tusks===
Males have short antlers, which can regrow, but they tend to fight for territory with their &quot;tusks&quot; (downward-pointing canine teeth). The presence of these &quot;tusks&quot; is otherwise unknown in native British wild deer and can be an identifying feature to differentiate a muntjac from an immature native deer. Water deer also have visible tusks but they are much less widespread.
Although these tusks resemble those of both water deer and the musk deer, the muntjac is not related to either of these (and they are not related to each other). The tusks are of a quite different shape in each.

=== Glands ===
Muntjacs possess various scent glands that have crucial functions in communication and territorial marking. They use their facial glands primarily to mark the ground and occasionally other individuals, and the glands are opened during defecation and urination, as well as sometimes during social displays. While the frontal glands are typically opened involuntarily as a result of facial muscle contractions, the preorbital glands near the eyes can be voluntarily opened much wider and even everted to push out the underlying glandular tissue. Even young fawns are capable of fully everting their preorbital glands.

==Genetics==
Muntjac are of great interest in evolutionary studies because of their dramatic chromosome variations and the recent discovery of several new species. The Southern red muntjac (&quot;M. muntjak&quot;) is the mammal with the lowest recorded chromosome number: The male has a diploid number of 7, the female only 6 chromosomes. Reeves&#x27;s muntjac (&quot;M. reevesi&quot;), in comparison, has a diploid number of 46 chromosomes.

==Species==
The genus &quot;Muntiacus&quot; has 14 recognized species:

* Bornean yellow muntjac, &quot;Muntiacus atherodes&quot;
* Hairy-fronted muntjac or black muntjac, &quot;Muntiacus crinifrons&quot;
* Fea&#x27;s muntjac, &quot;Muntiacus feae&quot;
* Gongshan muntjac, &quot;Muntiacus gongshanensis&quot;
* Malabar red muntjak, &quot;Muntiacus malabaricus&quot;
* Sumatran muntjac &quot;Muntiacus montanus&quot;
* Southern red muntjac, &quot;Muntiacus muntjak&quot;
* Leaf muntjac &quot;Muntiacus putaoensis&quot;
* Pu Hoat muntjac &quot;Muntiacus puhoatensis&quot;
* Reeves&#x27;s muntjac or Chinese muntjac, &quot;Muntiacus reevesi&quot;
* Roosevelt&#x27;s muntjac, &quot;Muntiacus rooseveltorum&quot;
* Truong Son muntjac &quot;Muntiacus truongsonensis&quot;
* Northern red muntjac, &quot;Muntiacus vaginalis&quot;
* Giant muntjac, &quot;Muntiacus vuquangensis&quot;

<doc id="774654" wikidata="Q57760" url="?curid=774654" title="Colmar Freiherr von der Goltz">
<text>Wilhelm Leopold Colmar Freiherr von der Goltz (12 August 1843 – 19 April 1916), also known as &quot;Goltz Pasha&quot;, was a Prussian field marshal and military writer.

==Early life and ancestry==
Goltz was born in Adlig Bielkenfeld, East Prussia (later renamed Goltzhausen; now Ivanovka, in Polessky District, Kaliningrad Oblast), into the impoverished noble Von der Goltz family, as the son of Erhard Wilhelm &quot;Otto&quot; Freiherr von der Goltz (1802-1849) and his wife, Palmine Schubert (1815-1893). He grew up at the manor house of Fabiansfelde near Preußisch Eylau, which had been bought by his father in 1844. His father spent some nineteen years in the Prussian Army without rising above the rank of lieutenant, and his efforts at farming were similarly unfruitful, and he eventually succumbed to cholera while on a trip to Danzig (now Gdańsk) when Colmar was six years old.

==Military career==
Goltz entered the Prussian infantry in 1861 as a second lieutenant with the 5th East Prussian Infantry Regiment Number 41, in Königsberg (now Kaliningrad). During 1864 he was on border duty at Toruń, after which he entered the Berlin Military Academy, but was temporarily withdrawn in 1866 to serve in the Austro-Prussian War, in which he was wounded at Trautenau. In 1867 he joined the topographical section of the general staff, and at the beginning of the Franco-Prussian War of 1870-71 was attached to the staff of Prince Frederick Charles, commanding general of the Prussian Second Army. He took part in the battles of Vionville and Gravelotte and in the siege of Metz. After Metz fell he served under Prince Friedrich Karl of Prussia in the campaign of the Loire, including the battles of Orleans and Le Mans.

Goltz was appointed professor at the military school at Potsdam in 1871, promoted to captain, and placed in the historical section of the general staff. It was then that he wrote &quot;Die Operationen der II. Armee bis zur Capitulation von Metz&quot; (&quot;The Operations of the Second Army until the surrender of Metz&quot;) and &quot;Die Sieben Tage von Le Mans&quot; (&quot;The Seven Days of Le Mans&quot;), both published in 1873. In 1874 he was appointed first general staff officer (Ia) of the 6th Division, and while so employed wrote &quot;Die Operationen der II. Armee an der Loire&quot; (&quot;The Operations of the Second Army on the Loire&quot;) and &quot;Léon Gambetta und seine Armeen&quot; (&quot;Léon Gambetta and his armies&quot;), published in 1875 and 1877 respectively. The latter was translated into French the same year, and is considered by many historians to be his most original contribution to military literature.

Goltz stressed how, despite the rapid initial victory against the Imperial French forces at the Battle of Sedan, the new French Republic had been able to mobilise national will for a (&quot;War of the People&quot;) which dragged on for many more months (the Siege of Paris, the campaign of the Loire and the partisans behind German lines, the latter tying down 20% of German strength), the implication being that it was therefore unrealistic to expect a quick victory over France in any future war. Goltz, who wrote with open admiration about Léon Gambetta&#x27;s efforts to raise new armies after September 1870, argued that the French &quot;people&#x27;s war&quot; might have been successful had Gambetta been able to better train his new armies. Goltz argued that henceforward a new age in war had begun, that of the &quot;nation in arms,&quot; where the state would seek to mobilize the entire nation and its resources for war, what today might be called total war. The views expressed in the latter work were unpopular with the powers that be and led to Goltz&#x27;s being sent back to regimental duty for a time, but it was not long before he returned to the military history section. In 1878 Goltz was appointed a lecturer in military history at the military academy in Berlin, where he remained for five years and attained the rank of major. He published, in 1883, &quot;Roßbach und Jena&quot; (new and revised edition, &quot;Von Rossbach bis Jena und Auerstadt&quot;, 1906) and &quot;Das Volk in Waffen&quot; (&quot;The Nation in Arms&quot;), both of which quickly became military classics. The latter also became the theoretical handbook of the Argentine Army, and in 1910 Goltz headed the German diplomatic mission to the Argentina Centennial. During his residence in Berlin, Goltz contributed many articles to military journals.

The ideas that Goltz first introduced in &quot;Léon Gambetta und seine Armeen&quot; were further expanded in &quot;The Nation in Arms&quot;, where he argued: So to win war in the future would require that &quot;the great civilized nations of the present bring their military organization to ever greater perfection.&quot; To that end, Goltz thought society needed to be militarized in peacetime on an unprecedented level, and what was required was &quot;the full amalgamation of military and civilian life.&quot; Goltz was a militarist, Social Darwinist and ultra-nationalist who believed war was necessary, desirable and inevitable. In Goltz&#x27;s Social Darwinist perspective, just as &quot;survival of the fittest&quot; prevailed in nature, the same principle applied to international relations with &quot;strong&quot; nations rightfully devouring &quot;weak&quot; nations. Goltz, who saw the carnage of war as the most beautiful thing in the world wrote: &quot;It [war] is an expression of the energy and self-respect which a nation possesses... Perpetual peace means perpetual death!&quot;

==Service with the Ottoman Empire==
Defeated in the Russo-Turkish War (1877–1878), Sultan Abdülhamid II, of the Ottoman Empire, asked for German help to reorganize the Ottoman Army, so that it would be able to resist the advance of the Russian Empire. Baron von der Goltz was sent. He spent twelve years on this work, which provided the material for several of his books. During his time in the Ottoman Empire, Goltz had a very negative view of Abdülhamid II, writing: Goltz achieved some reforms, such as lengthening the period of study at military schools and adding new curricula for staff courses at the War College. From 1883 to 1895, Goltz trained the so-called &quot;Goltz generation&quot; of Ottoman officers, many of whom would go to play prominent roles in Ottoman military and political life. Goltz, who learned to speak fluent Turkish, was a much admired teacher, regarded as a &quot;father figure&quot; by the cadets, who saw him as &quot;an inspiration.&quot; Attending his lectures, in which he sought to indoctrinate his students with his &quot;nation in arms&quot; philosophy, was seen as &quot;a matter of pride and joy&quot; by his pupils. As a result, it was the Ottoman army rather the German army which first embraced Goltz&#x27;s &quot;nation in arms&quot; theory as the basis of its understanding of war. After some years he was given the title Pasha (a signal honor for a non-Muslim) and in 1895, just before he returned to Germany, he was named Mushir (field-marshal). His improvements to the Ottoman army were significant. It is noteworthy that in the Greco-Turkish War (1897), the Turkish army stopped just before Thermopylae, only after Czar Nicholas II of Russia threatened the Ottoman Sultan that he would be attacking the Ottoman Empire from eastern Anatolia unless the Ottoman Army stopped their advance at that point.

On his return to Germany in 1895 Goltz became a lieutenant-general and commander of the 5th Division, and in 1898, head of the Engineer and Pioneer Corps and Inspector-General of Fortifications. In 1900 he was made General of Infantry and in 1902 commander of the I. Army Corps. After returning to Germany in 1895, Goltz was in close contact with his students, and offered them his advice. In an 1899 letter to Colonel Pertev Beyone, one of his protégés, Goltz wrote: 

Goltz often expressed admiration for the ordinary Turkish soldier, whom he regarded as immensely tough, brave and willing to suffer without complaint. By contrast, Goltz had nothing but contempt for the young people in Germany, who he charged were being &quot;corrupted&quot; by hedonism, urbanization, industrialization, prosperity, liberalism and Social Democracy, something that he believed was rendering the next generation of Germans increasing unfit for the test of war. In articles he published in Germany on the Macedonian Question in the early 20th century, Goltz was very pro-Ottoman, saying that the Ottomans had every right to remain in Macedonia. In his letters to his Ottoman protégés, he often urged them to invade Bulgaria to punish the Bulgarian government for its support of the Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organization. An Anglophobe, Goltz believed that the great coming war of the new 20th century would be an inevitable Anglo-German war for world domination. Goltz took for granted that the world was too small for the British and German empires to share, and one or the other would have to go. Starting in 1899, Goltz wrote to his Ottoman protégés, asking them to start preparing plans for invading Egypt to take the Suez Canal and for invading Persia as the prelude for an invasion of India. Goltz also believed that the European era of dominance would come to a close in the 20th century, pointing to the rise of new powers like the United States, Japan and eventually China. Goltz was greatly impressed with Japan&#x27;s victory in the Russo-Japanese War, and saw it as confirming his theory that in war, it is ultimately the will to win that makes the difference, and the side with the stronger will always prevailed. In contrast to the anti-Asian racist &quot;Yellow Peril&quot; propaganda being offered by his own government, Goltz had considerable respect for Asian peoples, and wrote in 1905 to Pertev: &quot;The East is beginning to awake; once it is awakened, it will not go to sleep again.&quot; Stressing that these were his own views, not those of the German government, Goltz speculated that sometime in the future a war would begin between the &quot;yellow race&quot; of the Japanese, Chinese and Mongols against the &quot;Anglo-Saxon&quot; powers, the United States and Great Britain. Goltz argued that neither Germany nor the Ottoman Empire could remain indifferent to this war, and it was necessary that Germany learn to understand &quot;the rising peoples of East Asia.&quot; Goltz concluded his letter to Pertev: &quot;Since we will engage much more in the East in the future, it would be sensible to learn the special power…given to them by nature.&quot;

In 1907 he was made Inspector-General of the newly created Sixth Army Inspection established at Berlin, and in 1908 was given the rank of colonel-general (&quot;Generaloberst&quot;). Goltz welcomed the Young Turk Revolution of 1908, which should come as no surprise given that most of the officers leading the revolution were men he had personally trained. Goltz wrote about this revolution of 1908: 

Writing in response to Goltz&#x27;s article praising the revolution, one Unionist Major Ali Fuad wrote: &quot;This article written by our Honorable Master should be repeatedly read by all soldiers from field marshal to lieutenant … it always should be read ... and should be taken as a guide in all our efforts and initiatives. … I assure you, Honorable Master … that we shall stick exactly to your advice and we shall regard it as our guide.&quot; Goltz replied that he was overjoyed with the affection from his &quot;old friends,&quot; and would be more than happy to offer his advice.

In an article on 24 July 1908, Goltz denied the charge often made in the West that the Ottoman authorities had oppressed the Christian population of Macedonia and were committing systematic human rights abuses. Goltz wrote: &quot;Nevertheless, what the Westerners write about the Turkish government is not honest. Most of the time, it is the case that those Greeks, Bulgarians, and Serbs, who have had terrible experiences at the hands of their very own nationals, ask for Turkish protection. They know that the Turks are filled with generosity and compassion. They forgot and forgive. For being compassionate to the weak is part of their national traditions and they are proud of it.&quot; Goltz denied the charge of widespread human rights abuses against the Christians, writing: &quot;Now, the Ottoman administration there is much better than it is thought. The Ottoman governors there, either generals or civilian employees, are young, healthy and knowledgeable men. If they are left to themselves, they can protect the peace perfectly well.&quot; Anyhow, Goltz wrote the Europeans &quot;never think about the real owners of the country, the Turks, who constitute the majority in Macedonia … Ottoman staff officers, since 1887, under my direction, have prepared the maps of the Ottoman Balkans and we have found many Turkish villages, which have not been shown in other maps, besides Slav and Greek ones. Turks, in short, have a great right to be in Macedonia. Goltz advised his protégés in the Committee of Union and Progress: &quot;Be powerful so you will not be subject to injustice.&quot; In 1910, Goltz advised Pertev to create a para-military youth organization that would serve to 

Goltz further added that the purpose of education of youth was 

Following the 1911 manœuvres Goltz was promoted to &quot;Generalfeldmarschall&quot; (Field Marshal), and retired from active service in 1913. In 1911 he founded the &quot;Jungdeutschlandbund&quot; (Young German League), an umbrella organization of right-wing German youth associations.

==Recalled from retirement: World War I==

===In German service (1914–1915)===
At the outbreak of the First World War Goltz was recalled to duty and appointed the military governor of Belgium. In that position, he dealt ruthlessly with what remained of Belgian resistance to German occupation, mostly sniper-fire and the damaging of rail and telegraph lines. As Martin Gilbert notes in &quot;The First World War,&quot; in early September 1914, the newly appointed Goltz proclaimed: &quot;It is the stern necessity of war that the punishment for hostile acts falls not only on the guilty, but on the innocent as well.&quot; On 5 October, he was even clearer when he ordered: &quot;In the future, villages in the vicinity of places where railway and telegraph lines are destroyed will be punished without pity (whether they are guilty or not of the acts in question). With this in view hostages have been taken in all villages near the railway lines which are threatened by such attacks. Upon the first attempt to destroy lines of railway, telegraph or telephone, they will immediately be shot.&quot;

Goltz&#x27; actions were praised by Adolf Hitler, who in September 1941 linked Nazi atrocities in Eastern Europe with those in Belgium during World War I.

===In Ottoman service (1915–1916)===
Soon afterward Goltz gave up that position and became a military aide to the essentially powerless Sultan Mehmed V. Baron von der Goltz did not get along with the head of the German mission to Turkey, Otto Liman von Sanders, nor was he liked by the real power in the Ottoman Government, Enver Pasha.

Despite the mutual dislike, in mid-October 1915, with the British under General Townshend advancing on Baghdad, Enver Pasha put Goltz in charge of the Sixth Army (see the Mesopotamian campaign). Baron von der Goltz was in command at the Battle of Ctesiphon, which was a draw, as both sides retreated from the battlefield. However, with the British retreating, Goltz turned his army around and followed them down the river. When Townshend halted at Kut, Goltz laid siege to the British position (see the Siege of Kut). Much like Julius Caesar&#x27;s legions at the Battle of Alesia, the Turkish 6th Army under the command of Halil Kut Pasha had to fight off a major British effort to relieve the Kut garrison while maintaining the siege. All told the British tried three different attacks and each one failed at a total cost of 23,000 casualties. The battles included The Battle of Wadi, The Battle of Hanna, and the Battle of Dujaila.

===Armenian Genocide===
During the 1915 campaign of the Russians in eastern Anatolia, German officers had recommended the selected deportation of the local Armenian population in Eastern Anatolia, in case the Russian advance caused an uprising. When Enver Pasha showed such orders to Goltz he approved of them as a military necessity. In the words of one historian, &quot;Goltz&#x27;s later actions to stop deportations indicate it is unlikely that he understood its larger significance.&quot; In December 1915 Goltz directly intervened, threatening to resign his command if the Armenian Genocide were not immediately halted. It was a measure of Goltz&#x27;s stature in the Ottoman Empire that he, as a foreign military adviser, was able, if briefly, to influence domestic policy. However, he was able to effect only a temporary reprieve, and then only in Mesopotamia. It would have been almost unheard of for a senior officer to resign during wartime, and in the end Goltz did not do so.

==Death==
Goltz died on 19 April 1916, just about two weeks before the British in Kut surrendered on 29 April. The official reason for his death was typhus, although apparently there were rumors that he had been poisoned. In accordance with his will, he was buried in the grounds of the German Consulate in Tarabya, Istanbul, overlooking the Bosporus. Footage exists of his funeral cortège, flanked on both sides by military officers and citizens of a grateful empire. Coincidentally, nineteen months later, British General Stanley Maude died in the same house in which Goltz had died.

==Writing career==
From the 1870s until World War I, Baron von der Goltz was more widely read by British and American military leaders than Clausewitz. In addition to many contributions to military periodicals, he wrote &quot;Kriegführung&quot; (1895), later titled &quot;Krieg und Heerführung&quot;, 1901 (&quot;The Conduct of War&quot; [lit. &quot;War and Army-Leadership&quot;]); &quot;Der Thessalische Krieg&quot; (&quot;The War in Greece&quot;, 1898); &quot;Ein Ausflug nach Macedonien&quot; (1894) (&quot;A Journey through Macedonia&quot;); &quot;Anatolische Ausflüge&quot; (1896) (&quot;Anatolian Travels&quot;); a map and description of the environs of Constantinople; &quot;Von Jena bis Pr. Eylau&quot; (1907) (&quot;From Jena to Eylau&quot;).

<text>Dorman Bridgman Eaton (June 27, 1823December 23, 1899) was an American lawyer instrumental in American federal Civil Service reform.
Born at Hardwick, Vermont, he graduated at the University of Vermont in 1848 and at the Harvard Law School in 1850, and in the latter year was admitted to the bar in New York City. There he became associated in practice with William Kent, the son of the great chancellor James Kent, an edition of whose &quot;Commentaries&quot; he assisted in editing.

Eaton early became interested in municipal and civil service reform. In 1866, he wrote the New York City Metropolitan Health Law, which created the modern day New York City health department. He was conspicuous in the fight against Boss Tweed and his followers, by one of whom he was assaulted; he required a long period of rest, and went to Europe, where he studied the workings of the civil service in various countries. From 1873 to 1875 he was a member of the first United States Civil Service Commission.

In 1877, at the request of President Rutherford B. Hayes, he made a careful study of the British civil service, and three years later published &quot;Civil Service in Great Britain&quot;. He drafted the Pendleton Civil Service Act of 1883, and later became chairman of the new United States Civil Service Commission established by it. He resigned in 1885, but was almost immediately reappointed by President Grover Cleveland, and served until 1886, editing the 3rd and 4th Reports of the commission. He was an organizer (1878) of the first society for the furtherance of civil service reform in New York City, of the National Civil Service Reform League, and of the National Conference of the Unitarian Church (1865). He died in New York City on December 23, 1899, leaving $100,000 each to Harvard and Columbia universities for the establishments of professorships in government.

He was a legal writer and editor, and a frequent contributor to the leading reviews. In addition to the works mentioned he published &quot;Should Judges be Elected?&quot; (1873), &quot;The Independent Movement in New York&quot; (1880), &quot;Term and Tenure of Office&quot; (1882), &quot;The Spoils System and Civil Service Reform&quot; (1882), &quot;Problems of Police Legislation&quot; (1895) and &quot;The Government of Municipalities&quot; (1899). He also authored, under the pseudonym of &quot;Junius&quot;, a series of pamphlets opposing the annexation of Hawaii.

==Family==
Eaton&#x27;s father Nathaniel Eaton (1791–1878) was a Vermont state senator in 1840 and later a judge. His step-brother John M. Gilman was a lawyer and politician in St. Paul, Minnesota; another step-brother, Marcus D. Gilman, a Chicago merchant and politician. Eaton married Annie S. Foster in 1856; they had no children.

<text>Robert James &quot;Bob&quot; Eaton (born February 13, 1940) is an American businessman. He served as chairman and chief executive officer of Chrysler Corporation.

==Early life==
Eaton was born in Buena Vista, Colorado and was raised in Arkansas City, Kansas. He graduated with a B.S. degree in mechanical engineering from the University of Kansas in 1963. He was a member of Kappa Sigma fraternity.

==Career==
Eaton joined General Motors upon graduation. In 1973, he was appointed chief engineer of GM&#x27;s new front-wheel-drive X-body cars.

<text>Edward Walter Eberle (August 17, 1864 – July 6, 1929) was an admiral in the United States Navy, who served as Superintendent of the United States Naval Academy and the third Chief of Naval Operations.

==Early years==
Edward Walter Eberle was born in Denton, Texas, to Swiss-born immigrant and Confederate Officer [Johann] Joseph Eberle (1828–1877), who originally was from Walenstadt in Sarganserland, and his wife Maria Anna, née Stemmler (1835–1886). He was raised at Fort Smith, Arkansas. He entered the United States Naval Academy on September 28, 1881, and graduated on June 5, 1885.

==Naval career==

Following the two years of sea service—spent in screw sloops-of-war and and the steamer , as then required before commissioning—Eberle was promoted to ensign on July 1, 1887. Brief duty in Washington, D.C., in the late summer and early autumn preceded his reporting to on November 22, 1887, to begin three years of duty in that U.S. Fish Commission steamer. During his time on the &quot;Albatross&quot;, commanded by then Captain Z. L. Tanner, he participated in running lines of soundings around Cape Horn, charting the fishing banks off the Pacific Northwest and Alaska, and assisting in developing the Tanner Sounding Device.

Following leave from November 22, 1890, to January 28, 1891, Eberle received instruction in new developments in naval ordnance at the Washington Navy Yard while awaiting orders for sea duty. Here, he demonstrated an interest in and an aptitude for naval gunnery which ever after was central to his career.

On March 20, 1891, Eberle reported to and, in the veteran screw sloop-of-war, steamed across the Atlantic and Indian Oceans to the Far East. A year and a half later, while still in the Far East, he was transferred to the sailing sloop-of-war to close out this tour of duty in Asiatic waters. He returned to the United States in the summer of 1894 and reported for duty at the Naval Academy on August 20.

In the waning days of this service at Annapolis, Eberle&#x27;s commission as lieutenant, junior grade, arrived on June 12, 1896, only to be followed a week later by orders sending him across the continent to San Francisco, where the battleship was being completed at the Union Iron Works. Eberle reported for duty on July 10, five days before the new battleship was first placed in commission. &quot;Oregon&quot; was one of four U.S. Navy ships of that time mounting modern turrets, and Eberle was assigned duty as the forward turret officer.

===Spanish–American War and rise to senior command===
&quot;Oregon&quot; was still operating along the Pacific coast in the spring of 1898 when Congress declared war on Spain; the ship promptly won great renown by its race south from Puget Sound to Cape Horn and then north to the Caribbean to join American forces blockading Cuba. Eberle distinguished himself during the Battle of Santiago de Cuba by the outstanding performance of his turret in its duel with Spanish cruiser and, later, in its bombardment of Spanish troop concentrations at Caimanera.

From this time on, Eberle reportedly enjoyed the favor of powerful officers in the navy. His promotion to lieutenant came on March 3, 1899, some three months before he was detached from &quot;Oregon&quot; and transferred to the cruiser , in which he served, briefly, as flag lieutenant and acting Chief of Staff of the Commander-in-Chief of the Asiatic Fleet, Captain Albert S. Barker during the Philippine–American War. Later that summer, Eberle returned to Annapolis to become aide to the superintendent of the Naval Academy, Commander Richard Wainwright. Besides carrying out the duties of that position, he busied himself in studying ordnance and in writing manuals for the use of guns and torpedoes and for the operation of wireless communication by warships. The first manual he wrote while there, was &quot;Gun and Torpedo Drills for the United States Navy&quot;, the Bureau of Navigation&#x27;s first publication covering drill procedures for modern guns and torpedoes.

Eberle next served as gunnery officer on the battleship in 1901 and 1902. In September 1902, Eberle became aide to the commandant of the New York Navy Yard, Rear Admiral Barker. In his short time in New York, he was temporarily detailed to serve as aide to British Admiral Lord Charles Beresford during his visits to New York in September and January. In October, he served in like capacity for the Crown Prince of Siam&#x27;s visit there. In April 1903, Rear Admiral Barker became Commander in Chief of the Atlantic Fleet, and brought Eberle along to again serve as his flag lieutenant. During this two-year assignment, Eberle assisted in installing the first wireless telegraphs on naval vessels, and developed the early procedures and practical uses of the new communication equipment.
On November 23, 1904, Eberle received a promotion to lieutenant commander, followed by a short tour as instructor at the Naval War College. In October 1905, he was assigned to the Navy&#x27;s Board of Inspection and Survey, where he served as recorder. By November 1907, he became executive officer of the battleship (serving again with Captain Wainwright in command), where he participated in the first leg of the Great White Fleet&#x27;s voyage around the world. After the fleet arrived in San Francisco, Eberle was detached and assigned to duties as the commanding officer, . This included the collateral duty as commandant of the San Francisco Naval Training Station. During the latter tour, on December 15, 1908, he was promoted to commander.

Eberle earned a captain&#x27;s commission on July 1, 1912. He attended the short course at the Naval War College in 1913; command of the cruiser and, later, of the Naval Gun Factory at Washington, D.C., preceded Eberle&#x27;s appointment as Superintendent of the Naval Academy on September 1, 1915.

===Superintendent to Chief of Naval Operations===
After overseeing the academy during the period of World War I when the need for officers brought the problems of acceleration, Eberle left Annapolis on January 30, 1919, to command the battleship divisions of the Atlantic Fleet. He was promoted to rear admiral shortly before leaving the academy.

On June 30, 1921, Eberle took command of the Pacific Fleet with the rank of admiral. Some two years later, on July 17, 1923, he became Chief of Naval Operations and held the office until relieved by Admiral Charles F. Hughes on November 14, 1927. During the years he held this post, he reportedly fought to minimize the adverse effect upon the navy of arms limitations negotiations and from Congressional thrift, hurried the completion of the aircraft carriers and , and upheld the navy&#x27;s right to maintain its own air arm.

After relinquishing the duties of Chief of Naval Operations, Eberle served on the General Board until he retired.

==Retirement==
Eberle retired from the United States Navy on August 9, 1928, and died in Washington, D.C., on July 6, 1929. He was buried at Arlington National Cemetery, in Arlington, Virginia.

==Marriage and family==
In 1889, Eberle married Tazie Harrison (1865–1924) of San Francisco, a relative of President William Henry Harrison. They had one son, Edward Randolph Eberle (1890–1935), who also served as a naval officer.

<text>Adolphe Sylvestre Félix Éboué (; 26 December 1884 – 17 May 1944) was a French colonial administrator and early adherent to the Free French Movement. He was the first black French man appointed to a high post in the French colonies, when appointed as Governor of Guadeloupe in 1936.

As governor of Chad (part of French Equatorial Africa) during most of World War II, he helped build support for Charles de Gaulle&#x27;s Free French in 1940, leading to broad electoral support for the Gaullist faction after the war.

He supported educated Africans and placed more in the colonial administration, as well as supporting preservation of African culture. He was the first black person to be buried in the Pantheon in Paris.

== Early life and education ==
Born in Cayenne, French Guiana, the grandson of slaves, Éboué was the fourth son in a family of five brothers. His father, Yves Urbain Éboué, was a gold prospector, and his mother, Marie Josephine Aurélie Léveillé, was a shop owner born in Roura. She raised her sons in the Guiana Créole tradition.

Éboué won a scholarship to study at secondary school in Bordeaux. Éboué was also a keen footballer, captaining his school team when they travelled to games in both Belgium and England. He graduated in law from the &quot;École nationale de la France d&#x27;Outre-Mer&quot; (called &quot;École coloniale&quot; for short), one of the &quot;grandes écoles&quot; in Paris.

== Career ==

Éboué served in colonial administration in Oubangui-Chari for twenty years, and then in Martinique. In 1936 he was appointed governor of Guadeloupe, the first man of black African descent to be appointed to such a senior post anywhere in the French colonies.

Two years later, with conflict on the horizon, he was transferred to Chad, arriving in Fort Lamy on 4 January 1939. He was instrumental in developing Chadian support for the Free French in 1940. This ultimately gave Charles de Gaulle&#x27;s faction control of the rest of French Equatorial Africa.

=== New indigenous policy for the French empire ===
As governor of the whole of French Equatorial Africa between 1940 and 1944, Éboué published &quot;The New Indigenous Policy for French Equatorial Africa&quot;, which set out the broad lines of a new policy that advocated respect for African traditions, support for traditional leaders, the development of existing social structures and the improvement of working conditions. The document served as a basis for the Brazzaville conference of French colonial governors, held in 1944, that sought to introduce major improvements for the peoples of the colonies.

He classified 200 educated Africans as &quot;notable évolués&quot; and reduced their taxes, as well as placing some Gabonese civil servants into positions of authority.

== Personal life ==
Éboué married Eugénie Tell. In 1946 one of their daughters, Ginette, married Léopold Sédar Senghor, the poet and future president of independent Senegal.

In 1922, Éboué was initiated as a freemason at &quot;La France Équinoxiale&quot; lodge in Cayenne. During his life he frequented &quot;Les Disciples de Pythagore&quot; and &quot;Maria Deraismes&quot; lodges. He is considered to be the first freemason to have joined the Resistance. His wife, Eugénie, was initiated at Droit Humain in Martinique and his daughter Ginette at Grande Loge Féminine de France.

Éboué died in 1944 of a stroke while in Cairo. His mortal remains were reburied in the Panthéon in Paris in 1949, making Éboué the first black French man honored in this manner.

== Legacy and honours ==

Éboué was awarded an Officer of the Legion of Honour, decorated in 1941 with the Cross of the Liberation and was made a member of the Council of the Order of the Liberation.

In 1961, the Banque Centrale des États de l&#x27;Afrique Équatoriale et du Cameroun (Central Bank of Equatorial African States and Cameroon) issued a 100-franc banknote featuring his portrait. The French colonies around the world issued a joint stamp issue in 1945 honouring his memory.

Within France, a square, Place Félix-Éboué, in 12th arrondissement of Paris is named for him, as is the adjacent Paris Métro station Daumesnil Félix-Éboué. A primary school in Le Pecq bears his name and offers bilingual English/French education. A small street near La Défense was named for him.

The main airport of Cayenne, French Guiana, which was previously named after the comte de Rochambeau, was named in his honor in 2012.

The Lycée Félix Éboué in N&#x27;Djamena is one of Chad&#x27;s oldest secondary schools. Founded in 1958 as a general education college, it was made a lycée in 1960, the year that Chad became an independent country. In 2002, it was split into two separate schools, each with about 3000 students.

<text>Marriner Stoddard Eccles (September 9, 1890 – December 18, 1977) was an American economist and banker who served as the 7th chairman of the Federal Reserve from 1934 to 1948. After his term as chairman, Eccles continued to serve as a member of the Federal Reserve Board of Governors until 1951.

Eccles was known during his lifetime chiefly as having been the Chairman of the Federal Reserve under President Franklin D. Roosevelt. He has been remembered for having anticipated and supporting the theories of John Maynard Keynes relative to &quot;inadequate aggregate spending&quot; in the economy which appeared during his tenure. As Eccles wrote in his memoir &quot;Beckoning Frontiers&quot; (1951):

As mass production has to be accompanied by mass consumption, mass consumption, in turn, implies a distribution of wealth ... to provide men with buying power. ... Instead of achieving that kind of distribution, a giant suction pump had by 1929–1930 drawn into a few hands an increasing portion of currently produced wealth. ... The other fellows could stay in the game only by borrowing. When their credit ran out, the game stopped.

== Early life ==
Born in Logan, Utah to David and Ellen (Stoddard) Eccles, a Mormon polygamist family, on September 9, 1890. He was the eldest of the nine children by Ellen Stoddard, David Eccles&#x27; second wife. His family was extended by another twelve siblings from his father&#x27;s first wife. Eccles was educated at the public schools of Baker, Oregon and attended Brigham Young College and served a Latter-day Saint mission to Scotland. After his mission, while working in a family enterprise in Blacksmith Fork Canyon, he learned of the untimely death of his father.

== Career ==
He was subsequently able to reorganize and consolidate the assets of his father&#x27;s industrial conglomerate and banking network. Eccles expanded the banking interests into a large western chain of banks called Eccles-Browning Affiliated Banks. He was a millionaire by age 22. The company withstood several bank runs during the Great Depression and, as a leading banker, Eccles became involved with the creation of the Emergency Banking Act of 1933 and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.

After a brief stint at the Treasury Department and with the support of treasury secretary Henry Morgenthau Jr., Eccles was appointed by President Roosevelt as the Chairman of the Federal Reserve. Eccles was reappointed chairman in 1936, 1940, and 1944 and served until 1948. In February 1944, Roosevelt appointed Eccles for another 14-year term on the board and Eccles stayed on the board until 1951, when he resigned a few months after the 1951 Accord. Eccles had also participated in post-World War II Bretton Woods negotiations that created the World Bank and International Monetary Fund.

Eccles retired to Utah in 1951 to run his companies and write his memoirs, titled &quot;Beckoning Frontiers: Public and Personal Recollections&quot;. He further consolidated industrial and family assets, finally organizing a series of foundations representing assets that he had managed for various family members. These foundations have served Utah and the Intermountain West in support of educational, artistic, humanitarian, and scientific activities. He died in Salt Lake City, Utah in 1977 and was entombed in the Larkin Sunset Lawn Mausoleum.

== Personal life ==
In 1913, he married the former May Campbell Young. The couple did not have a happy marriage, caused partly by Eccles&#x27; lack of attention towards her, and although they were legally married 35 years until their divorce in 1948, they separated soon after the marriage and lived largely separate lives. His grand-niece, Hope Eccles, is married to former Vice Chair of the Federal Reserve Randal Quarles.

== Legacy ==
Eccles was and is seen as an early proponent of demand stimulus projects to fend off the ravages of the Great Depression. Eccles was famously rebuked by Congresswoman Jessie Sumner (R, IL) during a House of Representatives hearing on the increasingly liberal policies of the Roosevelt administration and the Federal Reserve, when she said, &quot;&quot;you&quot; just love socialism.&quot; He became known as a defender of Keynesian ideas, though his ideas predated Keynes&#x27; &quot;The General Theory of Employment, Interest, and Money&quot; (1936). In that respect, he is considered by some to have seen monetary policy having secondary importance and that as a result he allowed the Federal Reserve to be sublimated to the interests of the Treasury.

In this view, the Federal Reserve after 1935 acquired new instruments to command monetary policy, but it did not change its behavior significantly. Further, his defense of the Federal Reserve-Treasury accord in 1951 is sometimes seen as a reversal of his previous policy stances.

Marriner Eccles received the Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement, alongside his brother George S. Eccles, at the 1972 Achievement Summit in Salt Lake City. The Eccles Building that houses the headquarters of the Federal Reserve in Washington, D.C. was named after Eccles in 1982. The naming was a component of the Garn-St. Germain Depository Institutions Act lead-sponsored by Senator Jake Garn (R, UT) and Congressman Fernand St. Germain (D, RI).

<text>Yema is a French watchmaking company that was founded and based in Besançon, France.

Since its inception, Yema brand has designed watches specifically for diving, motor racing, space exploration and sailing. Since 2009, the brand has belonged to the French watchmaking company Montres Ambre de Morteau.

==History==
===1948 - Founding and Henry Louis Belmont===
Henry Louis Belmont, graduated at the top of his class at the National Watchmaking School of Besançon in 1931, and created his own watchmaking company under the name Yema in 1948.

===1963 - Yema Superman collection===
In 1963, the company launched Yema Superman for divers. Many variations were produced by the company for this model of watch.
===1966 - Yema Yachtingraf collection and Yema RallyGraf collection===
In 1966, the first Yema Yachtingraf was launched, a watch especially designed for sailors. At the same time, the first Yema RallyGraf was launched. One Yema RallyGraf was even worn by Formula One champion Mario Andretti.

At the start of 1970, Yema became an official supplier of the French Sailing Federation (&quot;Fédération Française de Yachting à Voile&quot;) and equipped the French National Sailing Team in the 1972 Olympic Games.

Six different versions of Yema Yachtingraf model were crafted over the years.
===1982 - First French Watch in Space===
On 24 June 1982, French astronaut, Jean-Loup Chrétien, flew from the Baikonour base for a 10-day trip into space, wearing a Yema Spationaute I, making it the first French watch in space.

On 17 June 1985, the Discovery shuttle took off with Patrick Baudry and his Yema Spationaute II on mission STS-51G (First Franco-American Orbital Flight).

On 26 November 1988, Jean Loup Chrétien went on a mission to MIR Space Station wearing a Yema Spationaute III.

===1986 - North Pole Mission===
In May 1986, Yema joined forces with French physician and explorer Jean-Louis Etienne to cross the North Pole.

===1988 - Yema acquired by Seiko===
In 1988, Yema was bought by Seiko, a watch corporation headquartered in Japan.

===2004 - Yema acquired by Beckensteiner===
Later in 2004, Louis Eric Beckensteiner acquired Yema.

===2009 - Yema acquired by Montres Ambre===
In 2009, Yema was acquired by the French watchmaker group Montres Ambre de Morteau, located in Morteau, France. This is the current owner.

===2009 - MBP 1000 watch movement and Montres Ambre acquisition===
Yema designed a new proprietary watch movement: the MBP 1000. Equipped with a bidirectional oscillating mass mounted on ball bearings, they allowed a fast reassembly and a power reserve of 40 hours. This resulted in a gain of efficiency but also precision, provided by a regulator whose balance beats at a frequency of 28,800 alternations per hour. Stacking a total of 31 rubies including 2 located at the ends of the axis of the barrel, this technical design effectively reduced the friction generally observed at this element following the mechanical movements.

===2017 - Proxima Mission===
In 2017, Yema partnered with CNES (the National Centre for Space Studies) to create a new model of watch, the Yema Spacegraf. This model was to honor of the Proxima mission, which sent the 10th French astronaut to space.

<text>Nuno Jorge Pereira da Silva Valente (; born 12 September 1974) is a former Portuguese professional footballer who played as a left-back or a winger. He later became a manager. 

He played professionally in Portugal and England for Sporting, Portimonense, Marítimo, União Leiria, Porto and Everton.

Valente represented Portugal at international level, participating at Euro 2004 (where Portugal became runners-up) and the 2006 World Cup.

==Playing career==
===Club===
Born in Lisbon, Valente began his career at second division club Portimonense on loan from Sporting CP. However, he found first-team chances limited at the former side and despite success in helping win the Portuguese Cup in 1995, he was loaned again in the 1996–97 season to Marítimo, also in the Primeira Liga.

A young José Mourinho recognized Valente&#x27;s talent and brought him to União Leiria in the summer of 1999, where he spent three years as an undisputed starter. In 2002, when Mourinho left to join Porto, he and teammate Derlei were the club&#x27;s first signings. The former repaid the coach&#x27;s faith with some good displays as Porto romped to victory in the national championship and defeated Celtic 3–2 in the UEFA Cup.

The following campaign, Valente helped his club to Portuguese and Champions League wins, with the defender appearing in 11 games during the latter competition&#x27;s run, ten of those complete. At the season&#x27;s closure, he renewed his contract until 2007.

After Mourinho signed for Chelsea, Valente picked up a succession of injuries. He only played eight matches in the entire domestic league, but returned in time to face Inter Milan in the Champions League round of 16, not being able to prevent his team losing 2–4 on aggregate.

After another poor year, which included an ultimatum by Porto president Jorge Nuno Pinto da Costa that ordered him to choose between club or national team, eventually leading to a suspension, on 28 August 2005 Valente moved to Everton on a three-year deal worth €2.2 million, under recommendation of mentor Mourinho, after the English had lost regular left-back Alessandro Pistone to injury. He took a while to adapt to the hectic pace of the Premier League, but became a regular from then on – in 2005–06 and 2006–07 he was considered first-choice, but faced stiff competition from Gary Naysmith; in February 2007, the Merseyside club took the option of a one-year extension to his contract, tying him until June of the following year.

In early May 2008, Valente signed another one-year link, but he eventually fell down the pecking order at the Toffees, usually backing Leighton Baines. Furthermore, with centre back Joleon Lescott also being able to play the position and with Valente also suffering from injury problems, he received little playing time during 2008–09, being released on 12 June 2009 and choosing to retire from playing after appearing in 60 competitive games in four seasons.

===International===
A full Portugal international since after the 2002 FIFA World Cup, Valente was first-choice for the national side during the runner-up campaign at UEFA Euro 2004, played in home soil. During 2005 he suffered a thigh strain, but recovered in time to play in the 2006 World Cup, again playing a key part in their eventual fourth-place finish; in the quarter-final match against England he appeared to handball a David Beckham cross, but Horacio Elizondo did not award a penalty and his team eventually advanced after a shootout.

After playing only once during the Euro 2008 qualifiers, Valente retired from international football in September 2008.

==Coaching career==
Upon his retirement, Valente was appointed Everton&#x27;s official scout in Portugal. After one year, he returned to main club Sporting and joined Paulo Sérgio&#x27;s coaching staff.

Valente kickstarted his coaching career on 11 October 2017, replacing Fernando Mira at the helm of C.D. Trofense in the Portuguese third division. Less than two months later, after six official matches and five losses, he was fired.

<text>Frithelstock Priory was founded in about 1220 at Frithelstock, Devon, England, by Sir Robert de Beauchamp for Augustinian Canons Regular, as an indulgence to ensure intercessions for the repose of his soul. Walter de Stapledon, Bishop of Exeter, is considered a co-founder, for increasing the priory&#x27;s endowments.

The priory was dissolved in 1536 during the Dissolution of the Monasteries and only ruins remain.

==History==
The Domesday Book of 1086 lists &quot;Frelelestoch&quot; as one of the seventy-nine Devonshire holdings of Robert, Count of Mortain (–1090), the half-brother of William the Conqueror. His tenant was Robert FitzIvo, who appears to have held no other lands in the county. The manor was later held by Sir Roger de Beauchamp who, in about 1220, donated a large part of it to the Augustinian priory dedicated to St Gregory that he had founded within it as a dependency of Hartland Abbey in North Devon.

At the Dissolution of the Monasteries, the prior relinquished possession of the priory and its demesne lands on 27 August 1536. Sir Thomas Arundell, the receiver of the Court of Augmentations in the counties of Devon, Cornwall, Dorset and Somerset, farmed the lands out to John Wynslade at an annual rent of £20 2s. On 20 January 1537 the crown leased the lands for 21 years at the same rent to Sir George Carew of Mohuns Ottery. Carew immediately conveyed the lease to Wynslade. Wynslade was not long in possession as on 4 September 1537 the crown made a grant to Arthur Plantagenet, 1st Viscount Lisle (d.1542), an illegitimate son of King Edward IV, and his wife Honora Grenville, widow of Sir John Bassett (1462–31 Jan 1529) of Umberleigh, of &quot;The site, church, etc., and demesne of Frithelstock Priory, the manor, rectory and advowson of the vicarage of Frithelstock and the manor of Broadwoodwidger, all late of the priory&quot;. The estate was valued at about £92. Risdon reckoned the priory and barton thus granted to contain a thousand acres. Much of the negitiations fixing the purchase price payable by Lord Lisle to the crown are recorded in the Lisle Letters, the surviving correspondence between him and his London agent John Hussee.

The priory lands were later owned by Robert Walpole, 2nd Earl of Orford (d.1751), son of Robert Walpole (d.1745) the first prime minister, whose wife was Margaret Rolle, &quot;suo jure&quot; 15th Baroness Clinton (1709–1781), daughter and sole heiress of Samuel Rolle (1646–1719) of Heanton Satchville in the parish of Petrockstowe, about six miles south-east of Frithelstock. The lands later descended to Margaret Rolle&#x27;s heirs, the Barons Clinton.

==1734 view by Buck==
An engraving of the south-east view was made by Samuel &amp; Nathaniel Buck in 1734, inscribed as follows: left: &quot;To the Right Honourable ROBERT WALPOLE, Lord Walpole of Walpole, Clerk of the Rolls, one of the Gentlemen of his MAJESTYS Bedchamber, and Knight of the most honourable Order of the Bath, Proprietor of this Priory, This Prospect is humbly Inscrib&#x27;d by his Lordships most Obedt. Servts. Saml. &amp; Nathl. Buck.&quot; In the centre is the coat of arms of Walpole, and on the right is inscribed: &quot;This was a Priory of Canons regular, founded &amp; endow&#x27;d by Robert de Bello Campo or Beauchamp, &amp; dedicated to God the blessed Virgin &amp; St. Gregory. The Patrons reserv&#x27;d to themselves a Power to Guard the Gate for the preservation of the priory, during the vacancy of a Prior &amp; no longer. The Scite and Barton contain&#x27;d 1000 Acres which were given at the dissolution to Arthur Plantaginet, Viscount Lisle&quot;

==Visit by Rev. John Swete==

In October 1792 the Devon topographer Rev John Swete (1752–1821) visited the ruins of Frithelstock Priory in the company of Henry Stevens (1739–1802), son of Henry and Christiana Maria, whom he had visited at Cross. He relates the journey in his &quot;Journal&quot; thus: &quot;&quot;Accompanied by Mr Stevens I went in quest of the Priory of Frithelstock, in the way to which we descended to the bridge at the SW end of Torrington, which passing over, we again rose up a steep hill, introducing us to a common precipitous towards the river but having a delightful prospect on the north of Beam a seat of Dennis Rolle Esq., a most lovely and sequestered spot, protected on every side by the richest woods of the finest amphitheatrical form, the roots of which were washed by the river which as if enamoured of the spot winds round it in many a meander and seems reluctant to retire from it. On the summit of an hill three miles from Cross, having again past the Towridge by another bridge, we came to the ruins of the priory, which tho&#x27; not grand nor extensive have a good deal of the picturesque in them and possess a peculiarity in the rounding of the western windows of the chapel, rarely if at all to be met with. The remains consist chiefly of the side and end walls of what is now one room, the area of which in length is 30 paces and in width about 9. There are two very antient walnut trees overhanging the southern walls and with the ivy contributing greatly to enhance its beauty&quot;.&quot; Swete made a watercolour sketch of the priory, from the inside of the ruins looking toward the western wall, which survives in the Devon Record Office.

<text>Johann Peter Eckermann (21 September 1792 – 3 December 1854), German poet and author, is best known for his work &quot;Conversations with Goethe&quot;, the fruit of his association with Johann Wolfgang von Goethe during the last years of Goethe&#x27;s life.

==Biography==
Eckermann was born at Winsen (Luhe) in Harburg, Holy Roman Empire, of humble parentage, and was brought up in penury and privation.

After serving as a volunteer in the War of Liberation (1813–1814), he obtained a secretarial appointment under the war department at Hanover. In 1817, although twenty-five years of age, he was enabled to attend the gymnasium of Hanover and afterwards the university of Göttingen, which, however, after one year&#x27;s residence as a student of law, he left in 1822.

His acquaintance with Goethe began in the following year when Eckermann sent to Goethe the manuscript of &quot;Beiträge zur Poesie&quot; (1823). Soon afterwards he went to Weimar, where he supported himself as a private tutor. For several years he also instructed the son of the grand duke. In 1830 he travelled in Italy with Goethe&#x27;s son. In 1838 he was given the title of grand-ducal councillor and appointed librarian to the grand-duchess.

==Writings==
Eckermann is chiefly remembered for his important contributions to the knowledge of the great poet contained in his &quot;Conversations with Goethe&quot; (1836–1848). To Eckermann Goethe entrusted the publication of his &quot;Nachgelassene Schriften&quot; (posthumous works) (1832–1833). He was also joint-editor with Friedrich Wilhelm Riemer (1774–1845) of the complete edition of Goethe&#x27;s works in 40 volumes (1839–1840). He died at Weimar on 3 December 1854.

Eckermann&#x27;s &quot;Gespräche mit Goethe&quot; (vols: i. and ii. 1836; volume iii. 1848; 7th edition, Leipzig, 1899; best edition by Ludwig Geiger, Leipzig, 1902) have been translated into almost all the European languages, (English translations by Margaret Fuller, Boston, 1839, and John Oxenford, London, 1850).

Besides this work and the &quot;Beiträge zur Poesie&quot;, Eckermann published a volume of poems (Gedichte, 1838. See &quot;J. P. Eckermanns Nachlaß&quot; edited by Friedrich Tewes, volume i. (1905), and an article by RM Meyer in the &quot;Goethe-Jahrbuch&quot;, xvii. (1896)).

<text>Émile Eddé (; 5 May 1886 – 28 September 1949) was a Lebanese lawyer and politician who served twice as the President of Lebanon.

==Early life and education==
Émile Eddé was a member of a Maronite Christian family that originated from Beirut which served Shihab Dynasty . He was born in Damascus, where his father, Ibrahim Eddé, was working as a translator in the French Consulate. He attended Saint Joseph University, and moved to France to study law in Aix-en-Provence, in 1902, and graduated three years later. Because of his father’s health conditions, he was forced to return to Beirut in 1909, before submitting his doctoral thesis. In 1912, he was appointed as a lawyer for the French Consulate in Beirut.

Before the First World War, he sought to separate Mount Lebanon from the Ottoman Empire, for which he was sentenced to death. However, Edde was able to escape and took refuge in Alexandria. He participated in the establishment of the Eastern Unit in the French Army, which consisted of Lebanese and Syrian volunteers. During this period, he maintained contacts, with the French authorities, via his brother Joseph, residing in France.

== Political career ==
He was elected as a member of the first Lebanese delegation to the Paris Peace Conference that was formed on 9 October 1918, and was also appointed to the third Lebanese delegation formed in January 1920 under the chairmanship of Bishop Abdullah Khoury. The workmanship he demonstrated enabled him to make historical achievements on the level of the Lebanese national entity. Eddé urged the board of directors in Mount Lebanon – on the eve of the second delegation&#x27;s departure, headed by Patriarch Elias Hoayek – to issue a decision demanding the recovery of territories taken from Lebanon. Émile Eddé signed memoranda and petitions in the framework of his activity within the third delegation, and faced the French current calling for Syrian federalism after the Faisal - Clemenceau agreement and the Zionists’ demands in a meeting attended by the third delegation under the chairmanship of Archbishop Abdullah Khoury and Weizmann, saying that Zionism aims to annex southern Lebanon up to the Litani to Palestine, which is rejected by the Lebanese people. Eddé served as the speaker of the Parliament from October 1924 to January 1925, 

Emile Eddé was elected President of the Lebanese Republic in 1936 and signed during his term the Franco-Lebanese Treaty which provides for granting Lebanon its independence 5 years after ratifying the same. Nonetheless, the French government refused to ratify it thereafter.

He also developed during his presidential term the currently prevailing practice of nominating a Muslim Sunni as Lebanese Prime Minister.

He ran in the elections of 1943 against the list of Sheikh Bechara El Khoury, and issued an electoral statement on 9 August 1943, which became as a program for the Lebanese National Bloc. It was summarized in several points, chief among which are Lebanon&#x27;s full democratic independence, Lebanon&#x27;s attachment to the United Nations’ cause (which will replace the League of Nations), closer friendly ties with fraternal countries on the basis of mutual respect and full sovereignty, respect for all religions, equality between the Lebanese in terms of civil and political rights, equitable representation in public office based on competency, reform of the State&#x27;s public administration, dissemination and mainstreaming of education, development of agriculture, industry and trade, safeguarding the Lebanese expatriates’ interests, bringing together all the Lebanese regardless of their different sects in a united nation – the Lebanese homeland. During that period, incidents succeeded each other and dangers exacerbated, rendering it necessary for Émile Eddé to establish a party that takes charge of defending Lebanon and conveying his ideas. Therefore, three deputies from his bloc: Amin Al Saad, Asaad Al Bustani and George Akl filed, on 15 May 1946, an application in order to be duly provided with a statement of notification from the Minister of Interior, and on the same day, they received the Minister of Interior&#x27;s approval under No. 7582. Hence, the Lebanese National Bloc party was officially founded and was based on a program and an internal system. After that, Kesrouan El Khazen was elected President of the Party.

<text>Edwin Karl Rochus Freiherr von Manteuffel (24 February 1809 – 17 June 1885) was a Prussian &quot;Generalfeldmarschall&quot; noted for his victories in the Franco-Prussian War, and the first Imperial Lieutenant () of Alsace–Lorraine from 1879 until his death.

== Biography ==
Son of the president of the superior court of Magdeburg, Manteuffel was born at Dresden and brought up with his cousin, Otto von Manteuffel (1805–1882), the Prussian statesman. He entered the guards cavalry at Berlin in 1827 and became an officer in 1828. After attending the War Academy for two years, and serving successively as &quot;aide-de-camp&quot; to General von Müffling and to Prince Albert of Prussia, he was promoted captain in 1843 and major in 1848, when he became &quot;aide-de-camp&quot; to Frederick William IV, whose confidence he had gained during the revolutionary movement in Berlin.

Promoted lieutenant-colonel in 1852, and colonel (and commanding officer of the 5th Uhlans) in 1853, Manteuffel was sent on important diplomatic missions to Vienna and St Petersburg. In 1857 he was promoted to major-general and chief of the Prussian Military Cabinet (the King&#x27;s military advisers). He gave strong support to the Prince Regent&#x27;s plans for the reorganization of the army. In 1861 he was violently attacked in a pamphlet by Karl Twesten (1820–1870), a Liberal leader, whom he had wounded in a duel, for which Manteuffel insisted on being briefly imprisoned. He was promoted to lieutenant-general for the coronation of William I on 18 October 1861 and saw active service in that rank in the Danish War of 1864, then at its conclusion was appointed civil and military governor of Schleswig. In the Austrian War of 1866 he first occupied Holstein and afterwards commanded a division under Vogel von Falkenstein in the Hanoverian campaign, then in July succeeded Vogel in command of the Army of the Main.

Manteuffel&#x27;s successful campaign ended with the occupation of Würzburg, and he received the order Pour le Mérite. However, on account of his monarchist political views throughout the political crises of the 1860s, and of his almost bigoted Roman Catholicism, he was regarded by Liberal politicians as a reactionary, and, unlike the other army commanders, he was not granted a financial reward for his services. He then went on a diplomatic mission to St Petersburg, where he was &quot;persona grata&quot;, and gained Russia&#x27;s acquiescence to Prussia&#x27;s domination of north Germany. On his return he was made honorary colonel of the 5th Dragoon Regiment. He was appointed to the command of the IX (Schleswig-Holstein) Corps in 1866. But having previously exercised both civil and military control in the Elbe duchies he was unwilling to be a purely military commander under one of his former civil subordinates, and retired from the army for a year.
In 1868, however, Manteuffel returned to active service and on 18 September 1869 he received the Grand Cross of the Order of the Red Eagle. In the Franco-Prussian War of 1870–71 he commanded the I Corps under Steinmetz, distinguishing himself in the Battle of Borny-Colombey, and in the repulse of Bazaine at Noisseville. In October he succeeded Steinmetz in the command of the 1st Army, won the Battle of Amiens against &quot;Général de brigade&quot; Jean-Joseph Farre, and occupied Rouen. However he was less fortunate against Faidherbe at Pont Noyelles and Bapaume.

In January 1871 he commanded the newly formed &quot;Army of the South&quot;, which he led, in spite of hard frost, through the Côte-d&#x27;Or and over the plateau of Langres, cut off Bourbaki&#x27;s Army of the East with 80,000 men, and, after the action of Pontarlier, compelled it to cross the Swiss frontier, where it was disarmed. His immediate reward was the Grand Cross of the Iron Cross, and at the conclusion of peace he was made a member of the Order of the Black Eagle. When the Southern Army was disbanded Manteuffel commanded the Second Army and, from June 1871 until 1873, the army of occupation left in France, showing great tact in a difficult position.

At the close of the occupation, the Emperor promoted Manteuffel to the rank of Field Marshal and awarded him a large financial grant, and about the same time Alexander II of Russia gave him the Order of St. Andrew. After this he was employed on several diplomatic missions, was for a time Governor of Berlin, and in 1879—perhaps, as was commonly reported, because he was considered by Bismarck as a formidable rival—he was appointed Imperial Lieutenant of occupied Alsace–Lorraine. He is remembered in Alsace–Lorraine as a very humane, cultivated man, and as a conciliator whose fairness was often abused by some dominant figures. Opening the first session of the &quot;Landesausschuss&quot; (the regional assembly of Alsace–Lorraine), he announced his firm intention to gain full autonomy for Alsace–Lorraine, so that it could become a fully-fledged state of the German Empire. He died at Karlsbad, Bohemia, in 1885, still in office but without having achieved his aim.

<text>The Greco-Buddhist art or Gandhara art is the artistic manifestation of Greco-Buddhism, a cultural syncretism between Ancient Greek art and Buddhism. It had mainly evolved in the ancient region of Gandhara, located in the northwestern fringe of the Indian subcontinent.

The series of interactions leading to Gandhara art occurred over time, beginning with Alexander the Great&#x27;s brief incursion into the area, followed by the Mauryan Emperor Ashoka converting the region to Buddhism. Buddhism became the prominent religion in the Indo-Greek Kingdoms. However, Greco-Buddhist art truly flowered and spread under the Kushan Empire, when the first surviving devotional images of the Buddha were created during the 1st-3rd centuries CE. Gandhara art reached its zenith from the 3rd-5th century CE, when most surviving motifs and artworks were produced.

Gandhara art is characterized by Buddhist subject matter, sometimes adapting Greco-Roman elements, rendered in a style and forms that are heavily influenced by Greco-Roman art. It has the strong idealistic realism and sensuous description of Hellenistic art, and it is believed to have produced the first representations of Gautama Buddha in human form, ending the early period of aniconism in Buddhism.

The representation of the human form in large sculpture had a considerable influence, both to the south in the rest of India, and to the east, where the spread of Buddhism carried its influence as far as Japan.
==Historical outline==

There has been disagreement among art historians as to whether Gandharan art owes more to the culture established immediately after Alexander&#x27;s campaigns, or to a synthesis several centuries later between travelling Greco-Roman artists from the eastern Roman Empire in regions where Greek settlers were still important. Most of the considerable quantity of Gandharan art that can be dated comes from after about 50 CE, although some clearly was created earlier. For this reason, some scholars prefer to call this Romano-Indian art, or talk of an &quot;Indo-Classical style&quot;. 

The French scholar Alfred C. A. Foucher first identified the Western influences on Gandharan art at the end of the 19th century. He was initially a proponent of the continuity between the first Greek settlements and this art, and dated much of the art much earlier than more recent scholars do. However, he later revised his views and datings somewhat. His views as to dates and the crucial period of Western influence came to be widely rejected, but then received considerable support by the discovery of the important deserted city site of Ai-Khanoum (Alexandria on the Oxus), which was excavated in the 1960s and 1970s, where quantities of clearly Greek-influenced art were found, datable to the 3rd and (mostly) 2nd centuries BCE.

Greco-Buddhist art originated after a series of cultural exchanges between populations. During the time of Alexander the Great&#x27;s military campaign in the Indian subcontinent and South Asia, Buddhism was mostly limited to North Eastern India and not common in North Western India, where the Greek satrapies formed. Buddhism became widespread throughout South and Central Asia under the Maurya Empire. The Mauryan Emperor Ashoka converted his Greek subjects among others to Buddhism as mentioned in his Edicts of Ashoka.
After the overthrow of the Maurya Empire by the Shunga Empire, which did not extend to the north-western corners of the Mauryan territories, many of the Greek satrapies continued to practice Buddhism and developed the Greco-Buddhist art. This was evident during the reign of the Hellenistic Greco-Bactrian kingdom (250–130 BCE) and the Indo-Greek kingdom (180–10 BCE). Under the Indo-Greeks and especially later under the Kushan Empire, Greco-Buddhist art flourished in the area of Gandhara and even spread to Central Asia, affecting the art of the Tarim Basin, as well as permeating again into India. 

The Yavana (Greek) king Menander I was given the title of &quot;Soter&quot; (&quot;Savior&quot;), presumably for his aid of Buddhists that were being persecuted. According to the Milinda Panha, Menander was a devout Buddhist and achieved the title of an &quot;arhat&quot;, and was buried in a stupa according to the Buddhist fashion. Following the death of Menander, the Indo-Greek Kingdoms disintegrated and their realm was conquered by invading Indo-Scythians or other regional entities. The Indo-Scythians were in turn subjugated by the Kushan Empire as the Western Satraps and the Kushan Empire would consolidate power throughout most of Central Asia and North India. The Kushan Emperor Kanishka, was also a devout Buddhist and Buddhism and its art flourished during the Kushan Era. Furthermore, he was responsible for spreading Mahayana Buddhism and Buddhist art throughout the Silk Road.

==Early Buddhist art and aniconic Buddhist representations==
Buddhist art first became evident and widespread under the Maurya Empire during the reign of Ashoka the Great. Mauryan art heavily influenced early Buddhist art and its iconography. This is evident in the art found throughout the Maurya Empire such as capitals including the Pillars of Ashoka, and stupas such as the Sanchi and Bharhut stupas, which were constructed and first decorated during the Maurya Era. 

Early Buddhist art, including Mauryan art, depicted various structures and symbols pertaining to dharmic religions which are still used today. Symbols such as the Dharmachakra, lotus, and the Bodhi tree have become common iconography representing Buddhism.

Additionally, these Buddhist artforms included various mythological beings such as yakshas including Kubera and yakshini such as Chanda, as well as celestial Devas (Suras) and Asuras. Furthermore, Mauryan art especially those found on reliefs throughout stupas, depict the life of the Buddha including his birth, royal processions, the Great Departure, enlightenment, and death and entry to Nirvana.

Interestingly, although these sculptures depict other humans and various divinities in anthropomorphic forms, the Buddha is purposefully not shown in a human representation. Instead, the Buddha is depicted with various symbols. This includes a riderless horse depicting his departure from his kingdom as shown on the Bharhut stupa, Bodhi tree to depict the Shakyamuni Buddha achieving enlightenment, and the Buddha footprints to convey his legacy after moving on from this world. 

There is much debate on why the Buddha was not depicted as a human unlike other sculptures found throughout Buddhist art. It is considered that the orthodox Buddhists choose not to represent the Shakyamuni Buddha out of respect, as giving him a human form would bound him to this Earth as a living being which contradicts him obtaining his goal of enlightenment and achieving moksha.

==Hellenistic art in South Asia==

The clearest examples of Hellenistic art are found in the coins of the Greco-Bactrian kings of the period, such as Demetrius I of Bactria. Many coins of the Greco-Bactrian kings have been unearthed, including the largest silver and gold coins ever minted in the Hellenistic world, ranking among the best in artistic and technical sophistication: they &quot;show a degree of individuality never matched by the often more bland descriptions of their royal contemporaries further West&quot;. (&quot;Greece and the Hellenistic world&quot;).
These Hellenistic kingdoms established cities on the Greek model, such as in Ai-Khanoum in Bactria, displaying purely Hellenistic architectural features, Hellenistic statuary, and remains of Aristotelician papyrus prints and coin hoards.

These Greek elements penetrated India quite early as shown by the Hellenistic Pataliputra capital (3rd century BC) during the Maurya Era, but the influence became especially strong, particularly in northwestern India following the invasion of the Greco-Bactrians in 180 BC, with the establishment of the Indo-Greek kingdom in India. Architectural styles used Hellenistic decorative motifs such as fruit garland and scrolls. Stone palettes for aromatic oils representing purely Hellenistic themes such as a Nereid riding a Ketos sea monster are found.

==Early Gandhara creations: stone palettes (2nd century BC – 1st century AD)==

The Greeks in Asia are well known archaeologically for their stone palettes, also called &quot;toilet trays&quot;, round trays commonly found in the areas of Bactria and Gandhara, which usually represent Greek mythological scenes. The earliest of them are attributed to the Indo-Greek period in the 2nd and 1st century BCE (a few were retrieved from the Indo-Greek stratum No.5 at Sirkap). Production continued until the time of the Indo-Parthians, but they practically disappeared after the 1st century.
==Interaction==
As soon as the Greeks invaded Northwestern South Asia to form the Indo-Greek kingdom, a fusion of Hellenistic and Buddhist elements started to appear, encouraged by the benevolence of the Greek kings towards Buddhism. This artistic trend then developed for several centuries and seemed to flourish further during the Kushan Empire from the 1st century AD.

===Early contributions of Gandharan artists to Buddhist art (2nd-1st century BC)===
According to some authors, Hellenistic sculptors had some connection with the creation of Buddhist art at Sanchi and Bharhut. The structure as a whole as well as various elements point to Hellenistic and other foreign influence, such as the fluted bell, addorsed capital of the Persepolitan order, and the abundant use of the Hellenistic flame palmette or honeysuckle motif.

====Sanchi====
Around 115 BC, the embassy of Heliodorus from king Antialkidas to the court of the Sungas king Bhagabhadra in Vidisha is recorded. In the Sunga capital, Heliodorus constructed the Heliodorus pillar in a dedication to Vāsudeva. This would indicate that relations between the Indo-Greeks and the Sungas had improved by that time, that people traveled between the two realms, and also that the Indo-Greeks readily followed Indian religions.

Also around the same time, circa 115 BC, it is known that architectural decorations such as decorative reliefs started to be introduced at nearby Sanchi, 6 km away from Vidisha, by craftsmen from the area of Gandhara, a central Indo-Greek region. Typically, the earliest medallions at Sanchi Stupa No.2 are dated to 115 BC, while the more extensive pillar carvings are dated to 80 BC. These early decorative reliefs were apparently the work of craftsmen from the northwest (around the area of Gandhara), since they left mason&#x27;s marks in Kharoshthi, as opposed to the local Brahmi script. This seems to imply that these foreign workers were responsible for some of the earliest motifs and figures that can be found on the railings of the stupa.
====Bharhut====

Craftsmen from the Gandhara area, a central region of the Indo-Greek realm, are known to have been involved in the construction of the gateways at Bharhut, which are dated to 100-75 BC: this is because mason&#x27;s marks in Kharosthi have been found on several elements of the Bharhut remains, indicating that some of the builders at least came from the north, particularly from Gandhara where the Kharoshti script was in use.
Cunningham explained that the Kharosthi letters were found on the ballusters between the architraves of the gateway, but none on the railings which all had Indian markings, summarizing that the gateways, which are artistically more refined, must have been made by artists from the North, whereas the railings were made by local artists. The Bharhut gateway is dated to 100-75 BC (most probably 75 BC based on artistic analysis).

The structure as a whole as well as various elements point to Hellenistic and other foreign influence, such as the fluted bell, addorsed capital of the Persepolitan order, and the abundant use of the Hellenistic flame palmette or honeysuckle motif.

==Characteristics of Greco-Buddhist art==
===Artistic model===
Later, Greco-Buddhist art depicts the life of the Buddha in art. The Bodhisattvas are depicted as bare-chested and jewelled Indian princes, and the Buddhas as Greek kings wearing the light toga-like himation. The buildings in which they are depicted incorporate Greek style, with the ubiquitous Indo-Corinthian capitals and Greek decorative scrolls. Surrounding deities form a pantheon of Greek (Atlas, Herakles) and Indian gods (Indra).

=== Material ===
Stucco as well as stone was widely used by sculptors in Gandhara for the decoration of monastic and cult buildings. Stucco provided the artist with a medium of great plasticity, enabling a high degree of expressiveness to be given to the sculpture. Sculpting in stucco was popular wherever Buddhism spread from Gandhara - India, Afghanistan, Central Asia and China.

===Stylistic evolution===
Stylistically, Greco-Buddhist art started by being extremely fine and realistic, as apparent on the standing Buddhas, with &quot;a realistic treatment of the folds and on some even a hint of modelled volume that characterizes the best Greek work&quot; (Boardman). It then lost this sophisticated realism, becoming progressively more symbolic and decorative over the centuries.

===Architecture===
The presence of stupas at the Greek city of Sirkap, which was built by Demetrius around 180 BC, already indicates a strong syncretism between Hellenism and the Buddhist faith, together with other religions such as Hinduism and Zoroastrianism. The style is Greek, adorned with Corinthian columns in excellent Hellenistic execution.

Later in Hadda, the Greek divinity Atlas is represented holding Buddhist monuments with decorated Greek columns. The motif was adopted extensively throughout the Indian sub-continent, Atlas being substituted for the Indian Yaksa in the monuments of the Shunga Empire around the 2nd century BC.

===Buddha===

Sometime between the 2nd century BC and the 1st century AD, the first anthropomorphic representations of the Buddha were developed. These were absent from earlier strata of Buddhist art, which preferred to represent the Buddha with symbols such as the stupa, the Bodhi tree, the empty seat, the wheel, or the footprints. But the innovative anthropomorphic Buddha image immediately reached a very high level of sculptural sophistication, naturally inspired by the sculptural styles of Hellenistic Greece.
Many of the stylistic elements in the representations of the Buddha point to Greek influence: the Greek himation (a light toga-like wavy robe covering both shoulders: Buddhist characters are always represented with a dhoti loincloth before this innovation), the halo, the contrapposto stance of the upright figures, the stylized Mediterranean curly hair and top-knot apparently derived from the style of the Belvedere Apollo (330 BC), and the measured quality of the faces, all rendered with strong artistic realism (See: Greek art). Some of the standing Buddhas (as the one pictured) were sculpted using the specific Greek technique of making the hands and sometimes the feet in marble to increase the realistic effect, and the rest of the body in another material.

Foucher especially considered Hellenistic free-standing Buddhas as &quot;the most beautiful, and probably the most ancient of the Buddhas&quot;, assigning them to the 1st century BC, and making them the starting point of the anthropomorphic representations of the Buddha (&quot;The Buddhist art of Gandhara&quot;, Marshall, p101).

====Development====
There is some debate regarding the exact date for the development of the anthropomorphic representation of the Buddha, and this has a bearing on whether the innovation came directly from the Indo-Greeks, or was a later development by the Indo-Scythians, the Indo-Parthians or the Kushans under Hellenistic artistic influence. Most of the early images of the Buddha (especially those of the standing Buddha) are anepigraphic, which makes it difficult date definitely. The earliest known image of the Buddha with approximate dating is the Bimaran casket, which was found buried with coins of the Indo-Scythian king Azes II (or possibly Azes I), indicating a 30–10 BC date, although this date is not undisputed.

Such dating, as well as the general Hellenistic style and pose of the Buddha on the Bimaran casket (himation dress, contrapposto pose, general depiction) makes it a possible Indo-Greek work, used in dedications by Indo-Scythians soon after the end of Indo-Greek rule in Gandhara. Since it already displays quite a sophisticated iconography (Brahma and Śakra as attendants, Bodhisattvas) in an advanced style, it would suggest much earlier representations of the Buddha were already current by that time, going back to the rule of the Indo-Greeks (Alfred A. Foucher and others). The next datable findings come later, such as the Kanishka casket (c. AD 120) and Kanishka&#x27;s Buddhist coins. These works indicate that the anthropomorphic representation of the Buddha was already extant in the 1st century AD.

Chinese texts and mural paintings in the Tarim Basin city of Dunhuang describe ambassador Zhang Qian traveling to Central Asia, as far as Bactria around 130 BC. The same murals describe Emperor Wu (156–87 BC) worshipping Buddhist statues, explaining them as &quot;golden men brought in 120 BC by a great Han general in his campaigns against the nomads.&quot; Although there is no other mention of Emperor Wu worshipping the Buddha in Chinese historical literature, the murals suggest that statues of the Buddha were already in existence during the 2nd century BC, connecting them directly to the time of the Indo-Greeks.

The &quot;Book of Later Han&quot; describes the enquiry about Buddhism made around AD 67 by the emperor Emperor Ming (AD 58–75). He sent an envoy to the Yuezhi in northwestern India, who brought back paintings and statues of the Buddha, confirming their existence before that date:

:&quot;The Emperor, to discover the true doctrine, sent an envoy to Tianzhu (India) to inquire about the Buddha’s doctrine, after which paintings and statues [of the Buddha] appeared in the Middle Kingdom.&quot; (&quot;Book of Later Han&quot;, trans. John Hill)

====Artistic model====
In Gandharan art, the Buddha is often shown under the protection of the Greek god Herakles, standing with his club (and later a diamond rod) resting over his arm. This unusual representation of Herakles is the same as the one on the back of Demetrius&#x27; coins, and it is exclusively associated to him (and his son Euthydemus II), seen only on the back of his coins.

Soon, the figure of the Buddha was incorporated within architectural designs, such as Corinthian pillars and friezes. Scenes of the life of the Buddha are typically depicted in a Greek architectural environment, with protagonist wearing Greek clothes.
===Gods and Bodhisattvas===

Deities from the Greek mythological pantheon also tend to be incorporated in Buddhist representations, displaying a strong syncretism. In particular, Herakles (of the type of the Demetrius coins, with club resting on the arm) has been used abundantly as the representation of Vajrapani, the protector of the Buddha. Other Greek deities abundantly used in Greco-Buddhist art are representation of Atlas, and the Greek wind god Boreas. Atlas in particular tends to be involved as a sustaining elements in Buddhist architectural elements. Boreas became the Japanese wind god Fujin through the Greco-Buddhist Wardo/Oado and Chinese Feng Bo/Feng Po (&quot;Uncle Wind&quot;; among various other names). The mother deity Hariti was inspired by Tyche.

Particularly under the Kushans, there are also numerous representations of richly adorned, princely Bodhisattvas all in a very realistic Greco-Buddhist style. The Bodhisattvas, characteristic of the Mahayana form of Buddhism, are represented under the traits of Kushan princes, completed with their canonical accessories.

===Cupids===

Winged cupids are another popular motif in Greco-Buddhist art. They usually fly in pair, holding a wreath, the Greek symbol of victory and kingship, over the Buddha.

These figures, also known as &quot;apsarases&quot; were extensively adopted in Buddhist art, especially throughout East Asia, in forms derivative to the Greco-Buddhist representation. The progressive evolution of the style can be seen in the art of Qizil and Dunhuang. It is unclear however if the concept of the flying cupids was brought to India from the West, of if it had an independent Indian origin, although Boardman considers it a Classical contribution: &quot;Another Classical motif we found in India is the pair of hovering winged figures, generally called apsaras.&quot; (Boardman)

Scenes of cupids holding rich garlands, sometimes adorned with fruits, is another very popular Gandharan motif, directly inspired from Greek art. It is sometimes argued that the only concession to Indian art appears in the anklets worn by the cupids. These scenes had a very broad influence, as far as Amaravati on the eastern coast of India, where the cupids are replaced by yakṣas.
===Devotees===
Some Greco-Buddhist friezes represent groups of donors or devotees, giving interesting insights into the cultural identity of those who participated in the Buddhist cult.

Some groups, often described as the &quot;Buner reliefs,&quot; usually dated to the 1st century AD, depict Greeks in perfect Hellenistic style, either in posture, rendering, or clothing (wearing the Greek chiton and himation). It is sometimes even difficult to perceive an actual religious message behind the scenes. (The devotee scene on the right might, with doubt, depict of the presentation of Prince Siddharta to his bride. It may also just be a festive scene.)

About a century later, friezes also depict Kushan devotees, usually with the Buddha as the central figure.

===Fantastic animals===
Various fantastic animal deities of Hellenic origin were used as decorative elements in Buddhist temples, often triangular friezes in staircases or in front of Buddhist altars. The origin of these motifs can be found in Greece in the 5th century BC, and later in the designs of Greco-Bactrian perfume trays as those discovered in Sirkap. Among the most popular fantastic animals are tritons, ichthyo-centaurs and ketos sea-monsters. Similar fantastic animals are found in ancient Egyptian reliefs, and might therefore have been passed on to Bactria and India independently.

As fantastic animals of the sea, they were, in early Buddhism, supposed to safely bring the souls of dead people to Paradise beyond the waters. These motifs were later adopted in Indian art, where they influenced the depiction of the Indian monster makara, Varuna&#x27;s mount.
==Kushan contribution==

The later part of Greco-Buddhist art in northwestern India is usually associated with the Kushan Empire. The Kushans were nomadic people who started migrating from the Tarim Basin in Central Asia from around 170 BC and ended up founding an empire in northwestern India from the 2nd century BC. After conquering the lands once inhabited by Greco-Bactrians and Indo-Greeks, the Kushan Empire adopted Greco-Buddhist art.

==Later period (5th-7th centuries)==
The Greco-Buddhist art of Gandhara essentially ends with the 5th-7th centuries. A late evolution is the appearance of a halo and mandorla surrounding the Buddha figure. The last stages correspond roughly to the destruction of the Alchon Huns, when the art of Gandhara, becomes essentially extinct. When Xuanzang visited northwestern India in AD, he reported that Buddhism had drastically declined, and that most of the monasteries were deserted and left in ruins.

==Southern influences==

===Art of the Shunga===
Examples of the influence of Hellenistic or Greco-Buddhist art on the art of the Shunga Empire (183-73 BC) are usually faint. The main religion, at least at the beginning, seems to have been Hinduism, although some late Buddhist realizations in Madhya Pradesh as also known, such as some architectural expansions that were done at the stupas of Sanchi and Bharhut, originally started under King Ashoka.

===Art of Mathura===


The representations of the Buddha in Mathura, in central northern India, are generally dated slightly later than those of Gandhara, although not without debate, and are also much less numerous. Up to that point, Indian Buddhist art had essentially been aniconic, avoiding representation of the Buddha, except for his symbols, such as the wheel or the Bodhi tree, although some archaic Mathuran sculptural representation of Yaksas (earth divinities) have been dated to the 1st century BC. Even these Yaksas indicate some Hellenistic influence, possibly dating back to the occupation of Mathura by the Indo-Greeks during the 2nd century BC.

In terms of artistic predispositions for the first representations of the Buddha, Greek art provided a very natural and centuries-old background for an anthropomorphic representation of a divinity, while on the contrary &quot;there was nothing in earlier Indian statuary to suggest such a treatment of form or dress, and the Hindu pantheon provided no adequate model for an aristocratic and wholly human deity&quot; (Boardman).
The Mathura sculptures incorporate many Hellenistic elements, such as the general idealistic realism, and key design elements such as the curly hair, and folded garment. Specific Mathuran adaptations tend to reflect warmer climatic conditions, as they consist in a higher fluidity of the clothing, which progressively tend to cover only one shoulder instead of both. Also, facial types also tend to become more Indianized. Banerjee in &quot;Hellenism in ancient India&quot; describes &quot;the mixed character of the Mathura School in which we find on the one hand, a direct continuation of the old Indian art of Bharhut and Sanchi and on the other hand, the classical influence derived from Gandhara&quot;.

The influence of Greek art can be felt beyond Mathura, as far as Amaravati on the East coast of India, as shown by the usage of Greek scrolls in combination with Indian deities. Other motifs such as Greek chariots pulled by four horses can also be found in the same area.

Incidentally, Hindu art started to develop from the 1st to the 2nd century AD and found its first inspiration in the Buddhist art of Mathura. It progressively incorporated a profusion of original Hindu stylistic and symbolic elements however, in contrast with the general balance and simplicity of Buddhist art.

The art of Mathura features frequent sexual imagery. Female images with bare breasts, nude below the waist, displaying labia and female genitalia are common. These images are more sexually explicit than those of earlier or later periods.

===Arts of Western India===
It has been suggested that the art of Devnimori in Gujarat, dated to the 4th century AD, represented a Western Indian artistic tradition, based on the influence of the Greco-Buddhist art of Gandhara, that was anterior to the rise of Gupta Empire art, and that it may have influenced it, and have influenced the art of the Ajanta Caves, Sarnath and other places from the 5th century onward. Devnimori may also have received some influence from Mathura art. At Ajanta, some connections with the art of Gandhara can be noted, and there is evidence of a shared artistic idiom.

The site of Devnimori included numerous terracotta Buddhist sculptures (but no stone sculptures), which are among the earliest sculptures that can be found in Gujarat. The style is clearly influenced by the Greco-Buddhist art of Gandhara.

The Indo-Scythian Western Satraps (1st century AD-405 AD may have played a role in the transmission of the art of Gandhara to the western Deccan region, as may also have the southern expansion of the Alchon Huns in the 6th-7th century.

===Art of the Gupta===
The art of Mathura acquired progressively more Indian elements and reached a very high sophistication during the Gupta Empire, between the 4th and the 6th century AD. The art of the Gupta is considered as the final pinnacle of Indian art reflecting Hindu, Buddhist and Jain iconography.

Hellenistic elements are still clearly visible in the purity of the statuary and the folds of the clothing, but are improved upon with a very delicate rendering of the draping and a sort of radiance reinforced by the usage of pink sandstone.
Artistic details tend to be less realistic, as seen in the symbolic shell-like curls used to render the hairstyle of the Buddha.

==Expansion in Central Asia==
Greco-Buddhist artistic influences naturally followed Buddhism in its expansion to Central and East Asia from the 1st century BC.

===Bactria===

Bactria was under direct Greek control for more than two centuries from the conquests of Alexander the Great in 332 BC to the end of the Greco-Bactrian kingdom around 125 BC. The art of Bactria was almost perfectly Hellenistic as shown by the archaeological remains of Greco-Bactrian cities such as Alexandria on the Oxus (Ai-Khanoum), or the numismatic art of the Greco-Bactrian kings, often considered as the best of the Hellenistic world, and including the largest silver and gold coins ever minted by the Greeks.

When Buddhism expanded in Central Asia from the 1st century AD, Bactria saw the results of the Greco-Buddhist syncretism arrive on its territory from India, and a new blend of sculptural representation remained until the Islamic invasions.

The most striking of these realizations are the Buddhas of Bamyan. They tend to vary between the 5th and the 9th century AD. Their style is strongly inspired by Hellenistic culture.

In another area of Bactria called Fondukistan, some Greco-Buddhist art survived until the 7th century in Buddhist monasteries, displaying a strong Hellenistic influence combined with Indian decorativeness and mannerism, and some influence by the Sasanid Persians.

Most of the remaining art of Bactria was destroyed from the 5th century onward: the Buddhists were often blamed for idolatry and tended to be persecuted by the iconoclastic Muslims. Destructions continued during the Afghanistan War, and especially by the Taliban regime in 2001. The most famous case is that of the destruction of the Buddhas of Bamyan. Ironically, most of the remaining art from Afghanistan still extant was removed from the country during the Colonial period. In particular, a rich collection exists at the Musee Guimet in France.

===Tarim Basin===

The art of the Tarim Basin, also called Serindian art, is the art that developed from the 2nd through the 11th century in Serindia or Xinjiang, the western region of China that forms part of Central Asia. It derives from the art of the Gandhara and clearly combines Indian traditions with Greek and Roman influences. Buddhist missionaries travelling on the Silk Road introduced this art, along with Buddhism itself, into Serindia, where it mixed with Chinese and Persian influences.


==Influences in East Asia==
The arts of China, Korea and Japan adopted Greco-Buddhist influences, but also added many local elements as well. What remains identifiable from Greco-Buddhist art are realism in sculpture, clothing with elaborate folds, curly hairstyles, and winged figures holding wreaths.

===China===
Greco-Buddhist influences are found in Chinese Buddhist art, with local and temporal variations depending on the dynasties that adopted Buddhism. Money tree artifacts from the Han dynasty often contain small depictions of the Buddha similar to Gandhara styles, such as the high &quot;ushnisha&quot;, vertical hair bun, moustache, and symmetrical depictions of the robe and folds of the arms.

Some Northern Wei and Northern Qi statues are reminiscent of Gandharan style standing Buddhas, although in a more symbolic style. Some Eastern Wei statues display Buddhas with elaborate Greek-style robe folds, and surmounted by flying figures holding a wreath.

===Japan===

In Japan, Buddhist art developed as the country converted to Buddhism in AD 548. After the adoption of Buddhism, items of the Asuka Period display a classical style, with Hellenistic dress and realism characteristic of Greco-Buddhist art. Other art incorporated Chinese and Korean influences, so that Japanese Buddhism became varied in its expression. Elements of Greco-Buddhist art remain to this day, such as depictions of the Buddha with Greek style clothing folds.

Greek influence is also found in depictions of the wind god Fūjin, which shows similarities with the god Boreas. Both hold a &quot;wind bag&quot; above their head in a similar pose. 

==Influences on Southeast Asian art==
The Indian civilization proved very influential on the cultures of Southeast Asia. Most countries adopted Indian writing and culture, together with Hinduism and Mahayana and Theravada Buddhism.

The influence of Greco-Buddhist art is still visible in most of the representation of the Buddha in Southeast Asia, through their idealism, realism and details of dress, although they tend to intermix with Indian Hindu art, and they progressively acquire more local elements.

<text>Marian Wright Edelman ( Wright; born June 6, 1939) is an American activist for civil rights and children&#x27;s rights. She is the founder and president emerita of the Children&#x27;s Defense Fund. She influenced leaders such as Martin Luther King Jr, and Hillary Clinton.

== Early life ==
Marian Wright was born June 6, 1939, in Bennettsville, South Carolina. Her father was Arthur Jerome Wright, a Baptist minister, and her mother was Maggie Leola Bowen. Marian&#x27;s father encouraged her education before he died, after a heart attack in 1953, when she was 14.

=== Education ===
She went to Marlboro Training High School in Bennettsville, where she graduated in 1956, going on to Spelman College in Atlanta, Georgia.

Due to her academic achievement, she was awarded a Merrill scholarship which allowed her to travel and study abroad. She studied French civilization at the Sorbonne University and at the University of Geneva in Switzerland. For two months during her second semester abroad she studied in the Soviet Union as a Lisle Fellow.

In 1959 she returned to Spelman for her senior year and became involved in the Civil Rights Movement. In 1960 she was arrested along with 77 other students during a sit-in at segregated Atlanta restaurants. She graduated from Spelman as valedictorian. She went on to study law and enrolled at Yale Law School where she was a John Hay Whitney Fellow, and earned a Bachelor of Laws in 1963. She is a member of Delta Sigma Theta sorority.&lt;ref name=&quot;Brooks/Cole Empowerment Series: The Reluctant Welfare State&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Edelman received an honorary doctorate from La Salle University in May 2018.

== Activism ==

Edelman was the first African-American woman admitted to The Mississippi Bar in 1964. She began practicing law with the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund&#x27;s Mississippi office, working on racial justice issues connected with the civil rights movement and representing activists during the Mississippi Freedom Summer of 1964. She also helped establish the Head Start program.

Edelman moved in 1968 to Washington, D.C., where she continued her work and contributed to the organizing of the Poor People&#x27;s Campaign of Martin Luther King Jr. and the Southern Christian Leadership Conference. She founded the Washington Research Project, a public interest law firm, and also became interested in issues related to childhood development and children.

Edelman was elected the first Black woman on the Yale board of trustees in 1971.

In 1973, she founded the Children&#x27;s Defense Fund as a voice for poor children, children of color, and children with disabilities. The organization has served as an advocacy and research center for children&#x27;s issues, documenting the problems and possible solutions to children in need. She also became involved in several school desegregation cases and served on the board of the Child Development Group of Mississippi, which represented one of the largest Head Start programs in the country.

As leader and principal spokesperson for the CDF, Edelman worked to persuade United States Congress to overhaul foster care, support adoption, improve child care and protect children who are disabled, homeless, abused or neglected. As she expresses it, &quot;If you don&#x27;t like the way the world is, you have an obligation to change it. Just do it one step at a time.&quot; Under Edelman&#x27;s leadership, the CDF also worked on the Children&#x27;s Health Insurance Program (CHIP).

She continues to advocate youth pregnancy prevention, child-care funding, prenatal care, greater parental responsibility in teaching values and curtailing what she sees as children&#x27;s exposure to the barrage of violent images transmitted by mass media. Several of Edelman&#x27;s books highlight the importance of children&#x27;s rights. In her 1987 book titled &quot;Families in Peril: An Agenda for Social Change&quot;, Edelman stated: &quot;As adults, we are responsible for meeting the needs of children. It is our moral obligation. We brought about their births and their lives, and they cannot fend for themselves.&quot; Edelman serves on the board of the New York City-based Robin Hood Foundation, a charitable organization dedicated to the elimination of poverty.

In 2020, Edelman became president emerita of the Children&#x27;s Defense Fund, and Starsky Wilson began to head the organization.

October 6, 2021, Mariam writes, “we must reject any leaders who for any reason play political football with our children’s lives and our nation’s future” continuing to further advocate for children.

== Personal life ==
Edelman is a member of The Links.

During Joseph S. Clark&#x27;s and Robert F. Kennedy&#x27;s tour of the Mississippi Delta in 1967, she met Peter Edelman, an assistant to Kennedy. They married on July 14, 1968, as the third interracial couple to marry in Virginia after the state&#x27;s anti-miscegenation laws were struck down by the Supreme Court of the United States in Loving v. Virginia. Edelman and her husband, now a Georgetown law professor, have three children: Joshua, Jonah, and Ezra. Joshua is an educational administrator; Jonah works in education advocacy and founded Stand for Children; Ezra is a television producer and director who won an Academy Award for his documentary &quot;O.J.: Made in America.&quot;

<text>Ralph Douglas Doubell AM (born 11 February 1945) is an Australian former athlete, and gold medallist at the 1968 Summer Olympics.

==Athletic career==
Doubell was born in Melbourne, was educated at Melbourne High School and graduated from the University of Melbourne, where he had come under the tutelage of Austrian-born coach Franz Stampfl.

Doubell&#x27;s first major international victory in 800 metres was at the World Student Games in Tokyo in 1967 in a time of 1:46.7. His next season (the Olympic season) was severely curtailed by Achilles&#x27; tendon injuries, and he was unable to compete for six months prior to the Olympic Games in Mexico City. Doubell, however, was able to recover in time for Mexico City and won the 800 m gold medal, passing the pre-race favourite Wilson Kiprugut of Kenya down the straight to win in a world record equalling time of 1:44.3.

Doubell also won the 800 metres gold medal at the 1969 Pacific Conference Games, in a time of 1:48.0.

Doubell had planned to compete at the 1972 Olympics in Munich, but was prevented from doing so by calf injuries, which brought on his retirement from competitive athletics.

==Post-athletic career==
After retirement from sports, Doubell enrolled at Harvard Business School. He then worked as a Head of Relationship Management and a Director and Divisional Head of Corporate and Institutional Banking of the Deutsche Bank Group in Australia. He was a Director of Telstra Stadium in Sydney until 2007.

Doubell was inducted into the Sport Australia Hall of Fame in 1985. On 12 June 2006, in the Queen&#x27;s Birthday Honours List, he was made a Member (AM) of the Order of Australia, for &quot;services to athletics through administrative roles, particularly with Athletics New South Wales, and as a competitor&quot;.

== Infrastructure ==
Hollola is a municipality located west of Lahti. There were 1,527 leisure apartments there at the end of 2013.

The city of Lahti and Lake Vesijärvi, located in the middle of Hollola municipality, divide the municipality into Maakansa, located on the west side of the lake, and Vesikansa, located on the east side. Maakansa forms the main part of the municipality&#x27;s area. Paimela, Kalliola and Kukkila are listed from the Asikkala border in the north to the Lahti border in the south. 

=== Salpakangas ===
More than half of Hollola&#x27;s residents live in the municipal center in Salpakangas, and a good tenth in the villages of Kukkila and Kalliola.

During the Continuation War, Hollola&#x27;s municipality administration moved from the municipality of Hollola to the center of the city of Lahti and later moved to Salpakangas. The municipality&#x27;s growth in the 1960s was mainly based on conservative economic policy. It enabled lower municipal taxes in Lahti and attracted companies and residents to Salpakangas.

The center of Salpakkangas underwent major changes when Osuuskauppa Hämeenmaa built the Prisma market in the area, which was completed in 2017. An apartment building called Huili has been built in Salpakangas as a self-financed service home for the elderly.

== History ==
The banks of Hollola&#x27;s Lake Päijänne have been inhabited since the Stone Age because of its fish population. During the Viking Age, Hollola developed into an important center, the most densely populated area of which was the Vainio region. Hollola also contains the Kirkailanmäki cemetery.

After the Swedish crusade to Hämee and the establishmen of the Catholic Church in the area, Päijät-Hämee became a border region of the Swedish Empire. A chain of 13 ancient fortresses has been found in Finland, of which the hill fort Kapatuosia has been the most thoroughly studied. In addition to the ancient fortress of Kapatuosia, the Hankaa and Laitiala Kiiluanmäki fortresses are also found in Hollola. Their actual purpose is not exactly known, but it is suspected that they were part of a defense chain, a fire notification chain or places of escape for the local population.

In the Middle Ages, Hollola belonged to the castle county of Häme. The administrators of Hollola, Asikkala and Tennilä were established for the administration purposes of the Finnish monarchs, after which the administrator of Uudenkylä was established. Hollola&#x27;s administration was divided into the quarters of Artjärvi, Etola, Okerointe and Uskila. 

The development of Hollola&#x27;s Lahti village into a township and finally into a city began when the Riihimäki–Lahti Railway and the Vesijärvi Railway Station were built on the shore of Lake Vesijärvi in the southern part of Päijänte. Lahti became the hub of Vesijärvi port&#x27;s water traffic, rail traffic and road traffic. Lahti was separated from Hollola as a city on November 16, 1905.

Agriculture-dominant Hollola began to industrialize in the late 1960s when the Salpakakkaa conglomeration was zoned in the village of Ala-Okeroinen along the Tampere-Lahden highway, which became Hollola&#x27;s new municipal center. In recent decades, Hollola has been the fastest growing municipality in Päijät-Häme in terms of population.

In Päijät-Hämee, several municipal merger discussions have been held and related investigations have been carried out. They include the Uusi Kunta project called Vellamo and the unification project of six municipalities: Hollola, Hämeenkoski, Iiti, Kärkölä, Lahti and Nastola. The project was rejected by the Hollola municipal council and the Iiti municipal council. Hämeenkoski was merged with Hollola at the beginning of 2016.

== Municipal administration ==
Hollola&#x27;s municipal council has 43 councilors, and it includes seven councilor groups. The Oma council group consists of Kokoumus, SDP, Center, Christian Democrats, Basic Finns, Left Alliance and the Greens. The council group of Basic Finns was formed in the 2008 municipal elections. In the period 2021–2025, the largest council group is the coalition, which holds 11 seats.

In 2008, the municipal council decided to establish neighborhood councils in each village. The district boundaries of the local councils follow the boundaries of the pupil enrollment areas of the first grades of elementary school, and there are five of them. The councils have been formed in the local service areas of Southern, Central Hollola, Municipal Center, Church Region and Vesikansa.

<text>Eldon Lee Edwards (June 8, 1909 – August 1, 1960) was an American Ku Klux Klan leader.

==Biography==
Edwards was an automobile paint sprayer from Atlanta, Georgia, and rebuilt the Klan beginning in 1953. In his book &quot;The Informant: The FBI, the Ku Klux Klan, and the Murder of Viola Liuzzo&quot;, Gary May notes that Edwards became prominent at a time when the Klan was splintered into different local groups. Edwards succeeded Samuel Roper and was elected leader of the third KKK which was reestablished at Stone Mountain by Samuel Green in 1946, the successor of the second KKK. In 1955, Edwards created his own organization, &quot;U.S. Klans, Knights of the Ku Klux Klan&quot;, and established a 15,000 strong following in nine south eastern American states. In the late 1950s, Edwards joined forces with Roy Elonzo Davis who was Imperial Wizard of the Original Knights of the Ku Klux Klan, and one of the founding members of the second KKK who was leading the KKK in the western southern states. Edwards appointed Davis as Grand Dragon of the KKK in Texas in 1958 in an effort to merge their organizations.

Edwards was interviewed by Mike Wallace on May 5, 1957, as noted in Wallace&#x27;s 2006 book &quot;Between You and Me&quot;. Wallace confronted Edwards over his racism and the violence of the KKK. Edwards explained to Wallace that he believed segregation was instituted by God, and cited various bible verses to support his position. He insisted that racial segregation was a key tenet of true Christianity, and rejected the teachings of other Christian leaders who supported racial integration.

Edwards, long diagnosed with heart disease, died of a heart attack in Atlanta on August 1, 1960. In his last public appearance, Edwards said, &quot;We have more right to organize than the communists and the NAACP,&quot; and added, &quot;We white people are the inheritors of this country. We do not intend to surrender it.&quot; When Edwards died, his KKK organization splintered as different men attempted to take leadership. Roy Davis claimed to news media that he was the true successor of Edwards, claiming to have been elected to the position in 1959.

<text>James Burrows Edwards (June 24, 1927 – December 26, 2014) was an American politician and administrator from South Carolina. He was the first Republican to be elected governor of South Carolina since the post-Civil War Reconstruction era in the 1870s. He later served as the U.S. secretary of energy under Ronald Reagan.

==Early life and career==
Edwards was born in Hawthorne, Florida, and was an officer in the U.S. Maritime Service during World War II. He continued his service in the U.S. Naval Reserve after the war. Edwards received a bachelor&#x27;s degree in 1950 at the College of Charleston where he was a brother of Pi Kappa Phi fraternity. He received a D.M.D. in 1955 from the University of Louisville, and did a dental internship at the University of Pennsylvania. Returning to Charleston, Edwards established a dentistry practice in 1960 that specialized in oral surgery. He subsequently held a variety of positions associated with dentistry in the community.

==Political career==
In 1970, Edwards became chairman of the Republican Party of South Carolina&#x27;s 1st congressional district. As a supporter of Republican gubernatorial nominee U.S. Representative Albert Watson of South Carolina&#x27;s 2nd congressional district, Edwards claimed that Watson&#x27;s Democratic opponent, John C. West, worked covertly in 1969 against the nomination of South Carolina&#x27;s Clement Haynsworth to the United States Supreme Court. The Nixon nominee failed in the U.S. Senate, 55 to 45, on grounds of alleged bias against organized labor and a lack of support for civil rights. Edwards predicted that as governor West would install &quot;an ultra-liberal, minority-dominated state government,&quot; citing West&#x27;s political ties to Hubert H. Humphrey and longtime NAACP executive director Roy Wilkins.

Edwards first ran for office in 1971, in a special election to fill the vacancy in the Charleston-centered 1st congressional district caused by the death of longtime Democrat L. Mendel Rivers. Edwards narrowly lost to one of Rivers&#x27;s staffers, Mendel Jackson Davis, but gained enough name recognition from his strong showing that he was elected to the South Carolina Senate as a Republican from white-majority Charleston County. Two years later, he entered the governor&#x27;s race as a long-shot candidate. Edwards upset General William Westmoreland in the Republican primary and defeated Democratic Congressman William Jennings Bryan Dorn of South Carolina&#x27;s 3rd congressional district in the general election. Dorn had become the Democratic nominee after the winner of the runoff election, Charles D. &quot;Pug&quot; Ravenel, was disqualified on residency grounds.

Edwards was elected the first Republican governor of the state since Daniel Henry Chamberlain in 1876. 1974 was otherwise a dismal year for Republicans nationally because of the Watergate scandal and lingering opposition to the Vietnam War, both of which may have contributed to the primary defeat of Westmoreland, commander of U.S. forces during the late 1960s.

==Later career and death==
At that time South Carolina governors were not allowed to serve two terms in succession, so Edwards was unable to seek reelection in 1978. In 1981, U.S. president Ronald Reagan appointed Edwards secretary of energy. He resigned two years later to serve as the President of the Medical University of South Carolina, a post he held for 17 years. In 1997, Edwards was inducted into the South Carolina Hall of Fame. In 2008, he endorsed Mitt Romney for his party&#x27;s presidential nomination.

As governor and thereafter, Edwards developed a close friendship with his Democratic predecessor, John C. West, whom he had earlier accused of undermining the Haynsworth nomination.

In 1994, the state legislature renamed a portion of the Mark Clark Expressway that crosses the Wando River the James B. Edwards Bridge. In 2010, the new MUSC dental building and the dental school was renamed the James B. Edwards College of Dental Medicine. Edwards died at his home in Mount Pleasant on December 26, 2014, from complications from a stroke. He was 87.

<text>Ninian Edwards (March 17, 1775July 20, 1833) was an American political figure who was prominent in Illinois. He served as the first and only governor of the Illinois Territory from 1809 to until the territory earned statehood in 1818. He was then one of the first two United States senators from the State of Illinois from 1818 to 1824, and the third Governor of Illinois from 1826 to 1830. In a time and place where personal coalitions were more influential than parties, Edwards led one of the two main factions in frontier Illinois politics.

Born in Maryland, Edwards began his political career in Kentucky, where he served as a legislator and judge. He rose to the position of Chief Justice of the Kentucky Court of Appeals in 1808, at the time Kentucky&#x27;s highest court. In 1809, U.S. President James Madison appointed him to govern the newly created Illinois Territory. He held that post for three terms, overseeing the territory&#x27;s transition first to democratic &quot;second grade&quot; government, and then to statehood in 1818. On its second day in session, the Illinois General Assembly elected Edwards to the U.S. Senate, where conflict with rivals damaged him politically.

Edwards won an unlikely 1826 election to become Governor of Illinois. Conflict with the legislature over state bank regulations marked Edwards&#x27; administration, as did the pursuit of Indian removal. As governor or territorial governor he twice sent Illinois militia against Native Americans, in the War of 1812 and the Winnebago War, and signed treaties for the cession of Native American land. Edwards returned to private life when his term ended in 1830 and died of cholera two years later.

==Early life==
Ninian Edwards was born in 1775 to the prominent Edwards family in Montgomery County, Maryland. His mother, Margaret Beall Edwards, was from another prominent local family. His father Benjamin Edwards served in the Maryland House of Delegates, in Maryland&#x27;s state ratifying convention for the U.S. Constitution, and in the United States House of Representatives, filling a vacant seat for two months. Ninian was educated by private tutors, one of whom was the future U.S. Attorney General William Wirt. He attended Dickinson College from 1790 to 1792 but did not graduate, leaving college to study law. His son Ninian Wirt Edwards wrote later that Edwards spent some of his time at Dickinson reading medicine, a field to which he devoted considerable time in his later years.

In 1794, at the age of 19, Edwards moved to Nelson County, Kentucky to manage some family land. He showed a great aptitude for business and leadership and was soon elected to a seat in the Kentucky House of Representatives, before he was even eligible to vote. In 1802 he was awarded the rank of major in the militia. In 1803 he moved to Russellville, Kentucky, and won a succession of public offices: circuit court judge in 1803, presidential elector in 1804 (voting for Thomas Jefferson), and judge and finally chief justice of the Kentucky Court of Appeals, which at the time was Kentucky&#x27;s highest court. He joined the high court in 1806 and won the leadership position in 1808.

A well-educated landowning aristocrat, Edwards deliberately cultivated the image of the natural leader. Thomas Ford writes that he continued to dress like an 18th-century gentleman long after such fashions had gone out of style, and that his public speaking was marked by showy eloquence. Edwards consciously positioned himself in the select class of men who dominated Kentucky and, later, Illinois politics. In 1803 in Russellville, Edwards married Elvira Lane, a relative from Maryland.

==Territorial governorship==
The Illinois Territory was created in 1809. It included all of what today are the states of Wisconsin and Illinois, as well as parts of Minnesota and Michigan. Its European-American and African-American populations were almost entirely concentrated in the south, in the region later known as Egypt. President James Madison first appointed Kentucky politician John Boyle as its governor. Boyle collected his salary for the position for 21 days but then resigned to take Edwards&#x27; job as Kentucky Chief Justice, while friends in Washington helped secure Edwards&#x27; appointment as territorial governor. In the meantime, Territorial Secretary Nathaniel Pope, a cousin of Edwards, had to assume the powers of acting governor, creating Illinois&#x27; first counties and appointing officials to form the new government. Only 34 years old at the time of his appointment, Ninian Edwards is the youngest man ever to govern Illinois as either a state or a territory.

Edwards settled in the American Bottom on land he received as a grant upon his appointment as governor. He named his new farm Elvirade, after his wife. Along with his family, Edwards brought a number of slaves, whom he did not free even though the Northwest Ordinance of 1787 had made slavery illegal in the territory. An 1803 &quot;Law Concerning Servants&quot; had been promulgated for the Indiana Territory by then-Governor William Henry Harrison that maintained the status of people brought into the territory &quot;under contract to serve another in any trade or occupation.&quot; The law, which remained in force in the Illinois territory, permitted slavery to persist for decades under the guise of indentured servitude. Most of Illinois&#x27; early governors were slaveowners, and Edwards was no exception. In 1812, Edwards offered for sale, &quot;several likely young negro men and women.&quot; Later, he made extra income by renting some of his &quot;indentured servants&quot; out for labor in Missouri. In 1814, he &quot;sold my mulatto boy slave named Wallace now in possession of Harry of Ste. Genevieve Missouri Territory to Theodore Hunt. In 1815, he was seeking to sell his &quot;Mulatto Boy&quot; for $400.

The new territorial governor was sworn in on June 11, 1809. At first Edwards tried to avoid partisanship but soon found that faction was an inevitable result of his power to appoint officials and distribute government jobs. Although the First Party System continued to define national politics, the Federalist and Republican Parties never took hold in frontier Illinois. Rather, factional loyalties were created by personality, personal bonds such as kinship and militia service, and especially the distribution of patronage. In the early territorial years, two rival factions grew up around Edwards and Judge Jesse B. Thomas. These two factions formed Illinois&#x27; political landscape during its time as a territory and for its first several years of statehood.

===Democratic government===
Throughout Edwards&#x27; three terms as governor, he showed a willingness to surrender his own considerable powers in order to expand participatory government in the Illinois Territory. Before 1812, while Illinois had a first-grade territorial status, Edwards had vast powers to appoint county and local officials; however, he made it his practice to consider local opinion as much as he could when making appointments, often giving weight to petitions signed by local residents. He attempted to do the same for militia officers for a time, letting the men of a unit elect their leaders, but he soon abandoned this policy as impractical.

In 1812, Edwards successfully persuaded Congress to modify a provision of the 1787 Ordinance limiting voting rights to freeholders of of land. Due to long-running disputes over fraudulently sold lands, very few Illinois frontiersmen could qualify. At Edwards&#x27; urging, Congress granted the Illinois Territory universal white male suffrage, making it the most democratic U.S. territory at the time. In April, Edwards held a referendum on moving to second-grade government, allowing the people of Illinois to elect a legislature and a non-voting delegate to Congress. The referendum passed, and elections were held in October that sent Shadrach Bond to Washington as Illinois&#x27; first congressional delegate.

===War of 1812===
Edwards had not been governor long when Illinois became the scene of fighting during the War of 1812. Relations between Illinois settlers and Native Americans worsened throughout the territory during 1810 and 1811. By June 1811, Governor Edwards ordered the construction of a series of blockhouses and called out three companies of militia.

This action was the result of tensions that were created from a brutal murder that occurred on June 2, 1811, at a settlement cabin two miles northeast of Pocahontas, Illinois. Three Potawatomi Natives stormed the home and found twenty-year-old Elijah Cox and his younger sister, Rebecca. The assailants sliced the scalp from Elijah and removed his heart. The raiding party was looking for money after a failed raid on the nearby tribe of Osage. The men captured Rebecca, robbed the home and set out north for tribal controlled lands. A militia was sent to intercede and rescued Rebecca shortly south of Springfield. One more violent interaction occurred prior to the end of the month to stoke the flames of war. On June 20, 1811, in what is now Lower Alton, five Menominee Natives approached two locals, Price and Ellis. Price, believing the Natives to be friendly allowed them into their camp. Unfortunately, Price was killed; Ellis was able to escape on horse to the Wood River settlement. These murders brought panic to frontier families and fueled unfounded rumors of more murder and mayhem in the territory. This fear did result in the death of at least one Native chief. A group of five Potawatomi Natives were traveling down river at Alton when they were viewed by Michael Squires, a ferry operator. He opened fire on the group when they approached too closely.

Governor Edwards acted quickly to attempt to maintain peace, ordering the militia to “erect a chain of block houses in advance of the settlements at about twenty miles from each other commencing on the bank of the Illinois River, and a sufficient force to be distributed among them, with orders to scout from one to another every day.” The most prominent of these new blockhouses was constructed during the summer of 1812 by Colonel William Russell and named Camp Edwards in honor of the Governor, although it would commonly be known as Fort Russell. Its importance was due to its strategic location between the Mississippi River and Kaskaskia River. Governor Edwards spent considerable time at the fort, and while he was the commander-in-chief of the militia, he had very little military expertise or Native American knowledge.

The declaration of war and the Battle of Fort Dearborn in 1812 convinced Edwards that Potawatomi and Kickapoo in the territory were preparing to launch a major attack on the southern settlements. This assumption followed the Natives&#x27; stalled offensive of August and September 1812. The suspected target was Peoria, Illinois, where Native American tribes – Kickapoo, Potawatomi, and Piankashaw – had assembled in large numbers, and from where they recently undertook failed raids on American settlements. Edwards lacked assistance from outside the territory and instead relied on his own resources. Edwards estimated there were no more than 2,000 adult white males between the Mississippi and Wabash Rivers, while there were more than 1,000 Native tribesmen able to assemble at Peoria in a matter of days. In order to establish a militia, Edwards pledged his own resources to assure payment to militia volunteers.

In his capacity as commander in chief, Edwards gathered 350 mounted rangers and volunteers near Edwardsville and personally led an expedition north to Peoria. His senior staff included many of the territory&#x27;s most prominent citizens. These included Nathaniel W. Pope, territorial secretary, Benjamin Stephenson, Thomas Carlin, future Illinois Governor, and William, Elias, and Nelson Rector. The company was divided into two smaller regiments, one commanded by Stephenson acting as Colonel, the other by a Rector brother. Edwards and his army departed Fort Russell from Edwardsville on October 18, 1812. After crossing into Logan County, Edwards’ army encountered two deserted Kickapoo villages near present-day Salt Creek, formerly known as the Saline Fork of the Sangamon River. The regiment discovered native artwork, some of which depicted the scalping of American settlers. The regiment burned both abandoned villages.

After burning the two Kickapoo villages on the Sangamon River along the way, the militia advanced on Peoria itself. The village the army was preparing to attack was recently developed at the head of Peoria Lake and inhabited by Piankashaw and Kickapoo Natives likely led by Chief Pemwatome. At dawn, the army advanced. Edwards inflicted a devastating defeat to the Native American village. Edwards’ army seized eighty horses, some recently stolen from Saint Clair County, silver ornaments, 200 brass kettles, guns, and six scalps believed to belong to the women and children of the settler O’Neal family from Missouri. Edwards estimated that approximately thirty Native peoples were killed in the raid, although later estimates from the Kickapoo suggested the number was closer to eighty.

All told, the short campaign burned several villages and inflicted dozens of casualties before returning to Edwardsville on October 31, 1812. The attack angered both the Peoria villagers and the U.S. government because it had been carried out against Native Americans loyal to Black Partridge and Gomo, two leaders who had not joined Tecumseh&#x27;s War and were considered friendly to U.S. interests. A second attack under Captain Thomas Craig killed a large number of French settlers from Peoria as well as Potawatomi. In 1813, Illinois and Missouri militia joined a force of United States infantry under Benjamin Howard to drive all Native American villagers away from Peoria and establish Fort Clark.

Edwards&#x27; actions alienated those Native Americans friendly to the U.S. in the region. Ninian Edwards, having lost the confidence of the Madison administration, waited out the war in Kentucky. However, he was reappointed to a second and then a third term as territorial governor in 1812 and 1815, and he was also named one of the three U.S. negotiators of the Treaties of Portage des Sioux in 1815.

===Second and third terms===
During his nine years as territorial governor, Edwards made a good deal of money through several profitable ventures, including farming, land speculation, and investment in sawmills, grist mills, and stores.

Edwards&#x27; political rivalry with Jesse B. Thomas continued for the rest of his time as governor. Edwards, along with much of the legislature, criticized the territory&#x27;s judges for their inactivity. Among their complaints were that the judges did not hold court often enough and spent too much time absent from the territory. The legislature passed a bill in 1814 to reform the territory&#x27;s judicial system. The judges refused to acknowledge the act, claiming that they were outside the jurisdiction of the legislature. In 1815 the issue was resolved by Congress, which passed a law supporting Edwards and the legislature.

In December 1817, Edwards, responding to a movement for statehood led by his ally Daniel Pope Cook, recommended to the legislature that Illinois apply for admission to the Union. He also recommended that a census first be taken of the territory, a standard practice, but the legislature rejected this. Legislators, particularly those opposed to slavery, feared that any delay would allow Missouri to apply for statehood before Illinois, and that since Missouri was a slave state, this would cause so much turmoil in Congress that it would delay Illinois&#x27; admission even longer.

In order to emphasize to Congress that Illinois would be a free state, the legislature passed in January 1818 a bill that would both abolish Illinois&#x27; &quot;indentured servant&quot; system of &quot;de facto&quot; slavery, and prohibit Illinois&#x27; future Constitution from reinstating it. Governor Edwards issued his only veto to send the bill back to the legislature, and it was never revised. He made his objections on constitutional grounds, but he also had a conflict of interest as the owner of several enslaved people himself.

During Edwards&#x27; terms as territorial governor, Illinois&#x27; population more than tripled, from 12,282 in 1810 to 40,258 in 1818 (a census was finally conducted later that year). The population did not meet the 60,000 threshold the Northwest Ordinance required for a new state, but both Illinoisans and Congress expected continued growth.

==Senate career==
Illinois quickly proceeded along the steps to statehood. Its constitution was finished in August 1818; elections were held in September; and in October, the first General Assembly met in Kaskaskia. On October 6, Ninian Edwards stepped down, and Shadrach Bond was inaugurated as Illinois&#x27; first governor. The following day the new state legislature voted for Illinois&#x27; two members of the U.S. Senate. Edwards was quickly chosen on the first ballot; his rival Thomas was only elected after the fourth. Edwards and Thomas then drew straws to determine their respective terms: Thomas was placed in Class II of the Senate and could serve until 1823, while Edwards was placed in Class III and had to face reelection in February 1819. Edwards and Thomas still had to wait for Congress to formally ratify Illinois&#x27; constitution and admission to the Union, which it did on November 25. On December 3 the two senators were finally seated, leaving Edwards with a mere three months in his first term.

Edwards&#x27; re-election was more difficult. In four months he had lost the temporary support of Thomas&#x27; allies in the General Assembly who had voted for him in 1818. He narrowly defeated Thomas partisan Michael Jones by a vote of 23–19. This may have been due to the influence of the powerful Secretary of State Elias Kane, a Thomas ally.

Like most members of Congress during the Era of Good Feelings, Senator Edwards sat as a member of the Democratic-Republican Party. As his second term drew on, he joined the Adams-Clay faction that would develop into the National Republicans after Edwards left office. Edwards voted for the Missouri Compromise in 1820, a bill that Thomas sponsored. He voted against a law reducing prices for federal land, which made both Edwards and Representative Daniel Pope Cook targets of criticism at home. On May 6, 1821, Cook married Edwards&#x27; daughter Julia.

Ninian Edwards caused trouble for himself when he wrote several articles in the &quot;Washington Republican&quot; under the pseudonym &quot;A.B.&quot; that attacked U.S. Treasury Secretary William H. Crawford. Edwards alleged that Crawford had known of the impending failure of Illinois&#x27; Bank of Edwardsville in 1821, but had not withdrawn federal money from it. Edwards found that none of Crawford&#x27;s rivals was willing to support his charges, and he was unable to produce corroborating evidence. He resigned his Senate seat on March 4, 1824, to take a job he wanted as the first United States Minister to Mexico. While en route to his new position, Edwards was called back to Washington to testify before a special House committee concerning the &quot;A.B. Plot&quot;. Unable to substantiate his claims, Edwards resigned his diplomatic post, to be replaced by Joel Roberts Poinsett.

Back in Illinois, Edwards settled in Belleville, a town whose site he had once owned before selling off its lots at a profit.

==State governorship==

===Election of 1826===
When he returned to Illinois, Edwards appeared to be a discredited politician. He no longer had a loyal coalition in the General Assembly to re-elect him to the U.S. Senate. His actions in the &quot;A.B. Plot&quot; had made him lose favor with President Adams; therefore he could not expect another federal appointment. In addition, supporters of Andrew Jackson were becoming a force in Illinois politics. Illinois frontier voters so admired Jackson that soon, for the first time, they would give their support to a national party, the Democrats. Ninian Edwards never criticized Jackson, but as an Adams-Clay Republican Senator he was not part of Jackson&#x27;s growing coalition. Jacksonians deeply resented Edwards&#x27; ally Cook, who had voted against Jackson when the presidential election of 1824 was decided in the House of Representatives.

However, when he ran for governor in 1826, Edwards had the good fortune to enter a three-way race that split the Jacksonians between state Senator Thomas Sloo and Lieutenant Governor Adolphus Hubbard. As a campaign issue, Edwards focused on Illinois&#x27; dire financial situation, blaming Sloo and Hubbard and other legislators for it. Edwards won 49.5 percent of the vote to Sloo&#x27;s 46 percent, with the rest going to Hubbard.

===Administration===
Edwards&#x27; gubernatorial term was another period of rapid growth for Illinois. In the decade from 1820 to 1830, the population again nearly tripled from 55,211 to 157,445. During this era, Illinois was the fastest-growing territory in the world.

Edwards&#x27; administration was hampered by his conflict with the legislature, primarily over the struggling Bank of Illinois. The bank had been established in 1821, and from the beginning it had been underfunded, its notes had badly depreciated, and it had helped put the state deeply in debt. In his inaugural address Edwards undiplomatically attacked bank officials and politicians alike, accusing them of fraud and perjury. From that point, Edwards had a poor relationship with the General Assembly. During his term the Assembly did eventually pass a bank regulation bill, but it also passed a measure to relieve debtors despite Edwards&#x27; objections that the state could not afford it.

In 1827 Illinois established its first penitentiary, at Alton. That same year, the state received a federal land grant to build the Illinois and Michigan Canal, though work did not begin for several years.

Also in 1827, Edwards ordered the Illinois militia to join another war against Native Americans in northern Illinois. The Winnebago War, fought between white settlers and members of the Ho-Chunk tribe, broke out in Wisconsin (then part of the Michigan Territory) but spread to the lead-mining region around Galena. Edwards dispatched the militia and ordered 600 more men to be recruited in Sangamon County. The show of force convinced the Ho-Chunk to surrender.

After the war, Edwards urged the federal government to remove the remaining Native Americans from northern Illinois, claiming that their presence violated &quot;the rights of a sovereign and independent state&quot;, and hinting that he might dispatch the militia again to force them out. The federal government applied diplomatic pressure, and on July 29, 1829, the Potawatomi, Ottawa, and Ojibwe ceded of northern land to the State of Illinois; the Winnebago made a cession in August.

==Later life==
Under the 1818 constitution, governors were limited to a single term. When Edwards&#x27; ended on December 6, 1830, he returned to private life. He ran for the U.S. House of Representatives in 1832 and lost. Edwards devoted himself to charitable medical work in Belleville, giving free care to local residents. A cholera epidemic came through the area in 1833, carried by Winfield Scott&#x27;s troops during the Black Hawk War. Edwards stayed in the town to care for his patients and caught the disease, dying on July 20. He was interred in Belleville, but was later moved to Springfield&#x27;s Oak Ridge Cemetery.

==Family==
His brother was Cyrus Edwards who was a lawyer and Illinois state legislator.

Three of Edwards&#x27; sons and one son-in-law followed him into politics. Ninian Wirt Edwards (1809–1889), named for his father and his father&#x27;s childhood tutor William Wirt, served as Illinois Attorney General, in the General Assembly, and as Illinois&#x27; first Superintendent of Public Instruction. He was married to Elizabeth Porter Todd, a sister of Mary Todd Lincoln. Their daughter Julia Cook Edwards married Edward Lewis Baker, editor of the &quot;Illinois State Journal&quot; and son of Congressman David Jewett Baker.

Another son, Albert Gallatin Edwards (1812–1892), was an assistant secretary of the U.S. Treasury under President Abraham Lincoln. In 1887 he founded the brokerage firm A. G. Edwards in Saint Louis, Missouri. A third son, Benjamin S. Edwards (1818–1886), established a successful law practice in Springfield, Illinois and served as a judge in Illinois&#x27; Thirteenth Circuit. Ninian Edwards&#x27; daughter, Julia Edwards Cook, married Congressman Daniel Pope Cook. Their son, John Pope Cook, was a mayor of Springfield and a general in the Union Army during the American Civil War.

==Legacy==
Edwards County, Illinois was named for him, as is the St. Louis, Missouri Metro-East area city of Edwardsville, Illinois. Both were named for him during his time as territorial governor. The territorial legislature named Edwards County, while Edwardsville was named by its founder, Thomas Kirkpatrick. The Edwards Trace, pioneer Central Illinois trail, was named for Ninian Edwards and his War of 1812 campaign. Since the summer of 2020, Edwardsville community members have been calling for the removal of Ninian Edwards&#x27; statue and the renaming of the Ninian Edwards Plaza in Edwardsville, Illinois, due to Edwards&#x27; racist legacy. That same year the City Council unanimously changed the plaza&#x27;s name where the statue is located from Ninian Edwards Plaza to City Plaza. In the summer of 2021, the City removed the pedestal that Ninian Edwards statue was on.

<text>Sherman Edwards (April 3, 1919 – March 30, 1981) was an American composer, jazz pianist, and songwriter, best known for his songs from the 1969 Broadway musical &quot;1776&quot; and the 1972 film adaptation.

==Early life==
Edwards was born in the East Harlem neighborhood of New York City and was raised in the Weequahic section of Newark, New Jersey, where he attended Weequahic High School. He attended New York University, where he majored in history. Throughout college, Edwards moonlighted, playing jazz piano for late night radio and music shows. After serving in World War II, Edwards taught high school history for a brief period before continuing his career as a pianist, playing with some of history&#x27;s most famous swing bands and artists, including Louis Armstrong, Tommy Dorsey and Benny Goodman.

He lived in Parsippany, New Jersey, from 1958 to 1981.

==Early music career==
After a few years as a band leader and arranger for artist Mindy Carson, Edwards started writing pop songs at the Brill Building with writers including Hal David, Burt Bacharach, Sid Wayne, Earl Shuman and others. He turned out numerous hits in the late 1950s and early 1960s. As Rock n&#x27; Roll caught on, he found himself still at the Brill Building writing songs for Elvis Presley, including the Presley number &quot;Flaming Star&quot;. However, working with Presley&#x27;s manager &quot;The Colonel&quot; proved to be Edwards&#x27; impetus to leave pop and rock songwriting; Presley&#x27;s songwriters were forced to make huge monetary concessions in order to have their songs recorded by Presley.

According to collaborator Earl Shuman, one day while collaborating with Edwards in the Brill building, where publishers provided music rooms for the songwriters, Edwards left mid-song saying something to the effect that he &quot;wasn&#x27;t into the rock songs any more&quot; and that he had an idea for a show and was going home to write it. This began the evolution of &quot;1776&quot;.

Prior to &quot;1776&quot;, Edwards had written the incidental music for the stage comedy &quot;A Mighty Man is He&quot;, which opened on Broadway at the Cort Theatre on January 6, 1960, and closed January 9 after five performances.

Edwards also wrote the score for a children’s musical “Who’s Afraid of Mother Goose?” With lyrics by Ruth Batchelor, this one-hour show was broadcast on ABC-TV on October 13, 1967. It starred Maureen O&#x27;Hara and featured Peter Gennaro, Frankie Avalon, Nancy Sinatra, Margaret Hamilton, Dick Shawn, Dan Rowan, and Dick Martin.

==Popular songs written by Edwards==
* &quot;Broken Hearted Melody&quot; (words by Hal David), a 1959 hit for Sarah Vaughan
* &quot;Dungaree Doll&quot; (words by Ben Raleigh), a 1955 hit for Eddie Fisher
* &quot;Flaming Star&quot; (words by Sid Wayne), the theme song for the 1960 Elvis Presley film of the same name
* &quot;The Sounds of Summer&quot; (words by Sid Wayne), recorded by the Harry Simeone Chorale
* &quot;Johnny Get Angry&quot; (words by Hal David), a 1962 hit for Joanie Sommers
* &quot;Wonderful! Wonderful!&quot; (words by Ben Raleigh), a 1957 success for Johnny Mathis
* &quot;See You in September&quot; (words by Sid Wayne), a 1959 hit for The Tempos and 1966 hit for The Happenings
* &quot;For Heaven&#x27;s Sake&quot;, recorded by Billie Holiday on the 1958 album &quot;Lady in Satin&quot;

==&quot;1776&quot;==
Edwards&#x27; crowning achievement was, arguably, the musical &quot;1776&quot;, for which he wrote the original book, lyrics and music. Peter Stone re-wrote the book. The show depicts the meeting of the Continental Congress in Philadelphia, culminating with the signing of the Declaration of Independence. It opened at the 46th Street Theatre on March 16, 1969, and ran for 1,217 performances. It won the Tony Award for Best Musical.

===Film version===
The musical&#x27;s 1972 film &quot;1776&quot; retained all of Edwards&#x27; songs. &quot;Cool, Cool, Considerate Men&quot; was edited out of the film after its initial reserved-seat road showings. The song – about the right-leaning South facing the left-leaning North – was also left off of the first VHS release. The number was restored for cable TV viewings and DVD release.

==Personal life==
Edwards was married to Ingrid (Secretan) Edwards, a dancer who was a member of the original Ed Sullivan dancers and danced on Broadway in &quot;Sweethearts&quot;, &quot;Annie Get Your Gun&quot;, and &quot;Kiss Me, Kate&quot;.

==Death==

Edwards died of a heart attack in Manhattan at age 61 in 1981 and was interred at Kensico Cemetery in Valhalla, New York. He was survived by his wife, Ingrid; his son, Keith; his daughter, Valerie, and his mother, Rae Edwards.

<doc id="774763" wikidata="Q545751" url="?curid=774763" title="Louis Faidherbe">
<text>Louis Léon César Faidherbe (; 3 June 1818 – 29 September 1889) was a French general and colonial administrator. He created the Senegalese Tirailleurs when he was governor of Senegal.

==Early life==
Faidherbe was born into a lower-middle-class family in Lille. He was the fifth child of Louis César Joseph Faidherde, a hosier, and his wife, Sophie Monnier. His father died in 1826 when he was seven and he was brought up by his mother. In primary school, he displayed a talent for drawing and mathematics. He was a hard-working student and later received his military education at the École Polytechnique and then at the École d&#x27;Application in Metz. From 1843 to 1847 he served in Algeria, then for one year in Guadeloupe, and again from 1849 to 1852 in Algeria.

==West Africa==
In 1852 he was transferred to Senegal as sub-director of engineers, and in 1854 was promoted &quot;chef de bataillon&quot; and appointed governor of the colony on December 16. He held this post with one brief interval (1861–1863) until July 1865.

The work he accomplished in French West Africa constitutes his most enduring legacy. At that time France possessed in Senegal little else than the town of Saint-Louis and a strip of coast. Explorers had, however, made known the riches and possibilities of the Niger regions, and Faidherbe formed the design of adding those countries to the French dominions. He even dreamed of creating a French African empire stretching from Senegal to the Red Sea.

===Direct control of the Senegal River===

Faidherbe&#x27;s actions were not of his own creation, but were an implementation of &quot;The Plan of 1854&quot;: a series of ministerial orders given to Governor Protet that originated in petitions from the powerful Bordeaux-based Maurel and Prom company, the largest shipping interest in Saint-Louis. The plan specified in detail the creation of forts along the Sénégal River to end African control of the acacia gum trade from the interior. Faidherbe&#x27;s push to build fortifications farther out, his conflicts with Protet, and his protests to Paris over Protet&#x27;s inaction earned him the governorship in 1854.

Within three months of his appointment as governor, he had begun work on the first in a series on inland forts up the Sénégal, at Médine just below the Félou Falls (1855). By 1860, Faidherbe had built a series of forts between Médine and Saint-Louis, launching missions against the Trarza Moors in Waalo (north of the Sénégal river), who had previously collected taxes on goods coming to Saint-Louis from the interior.

===Conflict in the interior===

French military forces had previously avoided conflicts with the most powerful states in the area, the Peul empire along the Niger River, and the Cayor in the south. By sending emissaries to sign protectorates with weaker states (Bubakar Saada of Bundu, King Samba of Khasso) and by completing the &quot;pacification&quot; of Casamance and the Wolof peoples through what is now northern Senegal, Faidherbe quickly came into direct conflict with these states.

===War with the Fulanis of Fouta Toro===

To accomplish even the first part of his design, he had very inadequate resources, especially in view of the opposition from El Hadj Umar Tall, the Muslim ruler of the countries of the middle Niger. By advancing the French outposts on the upper Senegal, and particularly by breaking Umar Tall&#x27;s siege of Medina Fort, Faidherbe stemmed the Muslim advance. Striking an advantageous treaty with Umar in 1860, Faidherbe brought the French possessions into touch with the Niger. He also brought into subjection the country lying between the Senegal river and Gambia.

===War with the Serer people===

At the Battle of Logandème (18 May 1859), Faidherbe launched war against the Serer people of Sine, during the reign of Maad a Sinig Kumba Ndoffene Famak Joof (King of Sine). After his victory, he gave the order for Fatick (one of the provinces of Sine) and its surrounding villages to be burned to the ground. The French government in Paris criticised him for undertaking a military campaign without their authority. To answer his critics, Faidherbe claimed that he only occupied areas that belonged to France since 1679. Scholars like Martin A. Klein note that Faidherbe was merely playing with words and was making political decisions in Senegal without any authority whatsoever. Neither the Kingdom of Sine nor any of its provinces had ever belonged to France.

===Economics===
Saint-Louis was placed under formal military control, and a telegraph and road link was set up to the other French colonies in Gorée Island and Rufisque. In 1857, the French seized the inland region between these two from the Lebu Republic, and rechristened their capital Ndakarou as the new colonial city of Dakar. Work was begun on the Dakar–Saint-Louis railway, as well as a rail line along the Senegal into the interior.
Faidherbe&#x27;s large-scale projects included the building of bridges and provisioning of fresh drinking water. But Saint-Louis&#x27;s place as a door of French trade into an African interior began to wane with the expansion of direct colonial rule. Access to its port became increasingly awkward in the age of the steamship; and the completion of the Dakar-Saint Louis railroad in 1885 meant that up-country trade effectively circumvented its port. Large French firms, many from the city of Bordeaux, took over the new commercial networks of the interior, marginalizing the Métis traders who had always been the middle men of upstream commerce.

Faidherbe also placed under direct French control large-scale seasonal groundnut cultivation near the fort systems, and then along the rail lines. This created the navétanes system of seasonal labor migration, first in Cayor, then spreading along the rail lines to Baol and Sine-Saloum, and eventually along the Thies-Kayes railway. This would be a pattern spread throughout French West Africa and French Equatorial Africa well into the 20th century.

===Legacy in French colonialism===
When he resigned his post, French rule had been firmly established over a very considerable and fertile area and the foundation laid upon which his successors built up the position occupied after 1904 by France in West Africa.

The first half-century of French colonialism in Senegal produced neither solid political control nor economic gains. However, it established the basic principles for the later French advance. Senegal became the principal French base, not Guinea. French expansion was aimed towards the interior (which also encouraged expansion south in Algeria), and Faidherbe&#x27;s vision of empire was confirmed.

In 1863 he became general of brigade. From 1867 to early 1870, he commanded the subdivision of Bona in Algeria, and was commanding the Constantine division at the commencement of the Franco-Prussian War.

==Marriage and family==
Soon after his arrival in Saint-Louis Faidherbe took as a mistress, Diocounda Sidibe (Dionkhounda Siadibi), a fifteen-year-old Sarakolé girl. She helped him in his study of the Wolof, Pular, and Sarakolé languages. On 15 February 1857, they had a son, Louis Léon Faidherbe. In 1858, when Faidherbe was 40, he married his 18-year-old niece, Angèle-Emilie Marie Sophie Faidherbe. She was the daughter of his older brother, Romain, who had died eight years earlier. The marriage produced three children: Gaston, Mathilde and Wilhem. Angèle also helped care for Louis, the son of Sidibe.

Another of Faidherbe&#x27;s nieces, his wife&#x27;s older sister Clarence, married the naval officer Théophile Aube in May 1861. At the time Aube was serving in Senegal. He would later be promoted to admiral.

==Franco-Prussian War==

After the defeat of Napoleon III and his French Imperial Army by the Prussian Army in the summer of 1870, colonial officers such as Faidherbe were recalled to France and promoted to higher ranks to command new units and replace generals killed or captured in the war. Faidherbe was promoted to divisional general in November 1870, and in December appointed as commander-in-chief of the Army of the North by the Government of National Defence.

Faidherbe quickly proved himself to be the most able of the generals fighting Prussian forces in the French provinces, and won several small victories against the Prussian First Army at the towns of Ham, Hallue, and Pont-Noyelles. Despite his military skills, Faidherbe was never able to form an army strong enough to seriously worry the Prussians, as his army, composed of raw recruits, suffered immense supply difficulties and low morale in the freezing winter of 1870–1871. The Army of the North performed remarkably well by striking isolated enemy forces and then retreating behind the belt of fortresses around Pas-de-Calais. Ultimately, however, Faidherbe was ordered by Minister of War Leon Gambetta to attack the Prussians – Faidherbe rushed into an open battle at St Quentin and his army was destroyed.

==Political life and retirement==

During the course of his military career Faidherbe was decorated with the five degrees of the Legion of Honor: the &quot;Chevalier&quot; in 1852, the &quot;Officier&quot; in 1855, the &quot;Commandeur&quot; in 1861, the &quot;Grand Officier&quot; in 1871 and the &quot;Grand Croix&quot; in 1880.

Faidherbe was named as candidate for the legislature on several lists in the Somme department in the elections of 8 February 1871, and was elected.
He decided not to accept his election while retaining his military command in the north.
After he resigned from the army he was reelected on 2 July 1871 as representative for the Somme, for Pas-de-Calais and for Nord. 
He chose to represent Nord.
However, he resigned on 26 August 1871 after voting against giving the Assembly the power to define a constitution, because he said the Assembly had given itself that right rather than receiving it from the electors.
On 8 October 1871 he became a member of the departmental Council of Nord for the canton of Lille center.

Between October 1871 and May 1872 Faidherbe undertook a scientific mission to Upper Egypt, where he studied the monuments and inscriptions. On the same trip he visited Jerusalem and Italy.
He ran for election to the senate in Nord as a republican on 30 January 1876 but was defeated.
Faidherbe was elected on 5 January 1879 to the senate for the &quot;département&quot; of Nord.
He resigned his seat prior to the end of his term in 1888.

An enthusiastic geographer, historian, philologist and archaeologist, he wrote numerous works, including &quot;Collection des inscriptions numidiques&quot; (1870), &quot;La Campagne de l&#x27;armée du Nord&quot; (1871), &quot;Epigraphie phenicienne&quot; (1873), &quot;Essai sur la langue poul&quot; (1875), and &quot;Le Zénaga des tribus sénégalaises&quot; (1877), the last a study of the Berber language. He also wrote on the geography and history of Senegal and the Sahara.

He was elected a senator in 1879, and, in spite of failing health, continued to the last a close student of his favorite subjects.

==Death==
Faidherbe died on 29 September 1889, his body receiving a public funeral. Statues and monuments to his memory were erected at Lille, Bapaume, Saint-Quentin and Saint-Louis, Senegal. Numerous streets are named after him, and also the subway station in Paris (Faidherbe-Chaligny).

<doc id="774768" wikidata="Q1025722" url="?curid=774768" title="Houtskär">
<text>Houtskär (; ) is an island group and former municipality of Finland. On 1 January 2009, it was consolidated with Iniö, Korpo, Nagu and Pargas to form the municipality of Pargas (briefly named Väståboland).

It is located in the Archipelago Sea in the province of Western Finland and is part of the Southwest Finland region. The municipality had a population of 621 (as of 31 December 2008) and covered a land area of . The population density was .

The municipality was bilingual with the majority (86%) being Swedish and minority Finnish speakers.

There are one store in Houtskär, a bank and post office, and the church of Santa Maria in Näsby center. At various times throughout the year dances, accompanied by live music, are held which are an old tradition kept alive by both older and younger participants who dance in a variety of styles.

Houtskär consists of a group of bigger islands and many smaller islands in the surrounding sea area. Communications to the mainland is by the ”Archipelago road” through Pargas, Nagu and Korpo, with three ferries considered part of the road network, the trip with the last one from Korpo to Houtskär lasting half an hour. The main islands are connected by bridges or cable ferries, the outer inhabited islands usually have daily connections with ship-like ferries.

== History ==
The name of Houtskär is of Finnish origin. The &quot;hout-&quot; element does not come from any Swedish word, instead coming from the Finnish word &quot;hauta&quot; which in this context may refer to a deep part of the sea or a burial site. The original Finnish name can be reconstructed as &quot;*Hautasaari&quot; or &quot;*Hautasalo&quot;, where &quot;saari/salo&quot; was then translated into Swedish as &quot;skär&quot;. &quot;Houtskari&quot; is a later Finnish transcription of the Swedish name. 

Houtskär was first mentioned in 1554. A chapel was built in the village of Näsby in the early 17th century, while a church was built there in the 18th century. At the time, Houtskär was a part of the Korpo (Korppoo) parish. In 1865, Houtskär became a separate municipality.

In 2009, Houtskär became a part of the new Väståboland municipality, which was renamed to Pargas in 2012.

<doc id="774776" wikidata="Q3510481" url="?curid=774776" title="Michael Francis Egan">
<text>Michael Francis Egan (September 29, 1761 – July 22, 1814) was an Irish American Catholic prelate who served as Bishop of Philadelphia from 1808 until his death.

Egan was born in Ireland in 1761, and joined the Franciscan Order at a young age. He served as a priest in Rome, Ireland, and Pennsylvania and became known as a gifted preacher. In 1808, Egan was appointed the first Bishop of Philadelphia. Egan&#x27;s tenure as bishop saw the construction of new churches and the expansion of the Catholic Church membership in his diocese, but much of his time was consumed by disputes with the lay trustees of his pro-cathedral, St. Mary&#x27;s Church in Philadelphia. He died in Philadelphia, probably of tuberculosis, in 1814.

==Early life and priesthood==
Michael Francis Egan was born in Ireland on September 29, 1761. The exact location of his birth is disputed. Early biographers believed that Egan was possibly born in Galway; more recent scholarship suggests it was Limerick. He joined the Order of Friars Minor (commonly known as the Franciscans) and studied at the Old University of Leuven and Charles University in Prague. Egan received minor orders, subdiaconate, and diaconate at Mechelen, in modern-day Belgium. He was ordained a priest, probably in Prague, in 1785 or 1786. While studying on the continent, Egan became fluent in German.

Egan advanced rapidly to positions of responsibility in the Franciscan order. He was appointed &quot;custos&quot; (&quot;guardian&quot;) of the province of Munster in Ireland in March 1787. Later that year, he was also appointed &quot;custos&quot; of the Pontifical College at Sant’Isidoro a Capo le Case, the home of Irish Franciscans in Rome. Egan remained there until 1790, when he returned to Ireland and was appointed &quot;custos&quot; of Ennis. He remained in Ireland until 1787 or 1788, when he may have made a visit to the United States. After several more years as a missionary in Ireland, Egan came (or returned) to the United States in 1802.

==Priest in Pennsylvania==
Accepting an invitation from the Catholics near Lancaster, Pennsylvania, Egan arrived in the United States in January 1802 to serve as assistant pastor to Louis de Barth at Conewago Chapel in Adams County. When the state legislature sat in Lancaster that year, word of Egan&#x27;s preaching abilities traveled back to Philadelphia, and soon, the parishioners of that city&#x27;s St. Mary&#x27;s Church petitioned Bishop John Carroll of Baltimore to send Egan to them. (At the time, the Bishop of Baltimore had jurisdiction over the entire Catholic Church in the United States.)

In 1803, Egan became one of the pastors of St. Mary&#x27;s Church at Philadelphia. The move coincided with a yellow fever outbreak in Philadelphia. Though less virulent than Philadelphia&#x27;s famous 1793 outbreak of the disease, there were nonetheless many deaths, and Egan presided over many funerals that year—St. Mary&#x27;s had 77 interments between June and November 1803. In 1804, Egan received permission to establish a province of Franciscans in the United States for the first time, independent of the Irish Franciscans who were then supervising the American mission. Two years later, a parishioner willed Egan some land along the Yellow Creek in Indiana County, for the establishment of a Franciscan church. Due to the order&#x27;s vows of poverty, Egan asked Carroll to hold the land in his name. Egan&#x27;s dream was never realized, as he was unable to attract Franciscans from Europe to establish the planned church.

Egan and the trustees of St. Mary&#x27;s established a singing school in 1804, with the goal of improving the quality of the choir there. The following year was consumed by another outbreak of yellow fever, and Egan joined John Rossiter, the pastor of another of Philadelphia&#x27;s four Catholic churches, St. Joseph&#x27;s, in ministering to the sick. In 1806, they worked with the parishioners of a third church, Holy Trinity, to found an orphanage, as the problem of orphaned children had been made worse by the yellow fever deaths.

==Bishop of Philadelphia==
===Ordination===

The Catholic population in the United States was growing, and Bishop John Carroll had for some time wished for his vast diocese to be divided into more manageable territories. On April 8, 1808, Pope Pius VII granted Carroll&#x27;s request, erecting four new sees in the United States and elevating Baltimore to an archdiocese. Among the new sees was the Diocese of Philadelphia, which included the states of Pennsylvania and Delaware as well as the western and southern parts of New Jersey. Even before the diocese was created, Carroll had determined to recommend Egan for the post, writing to Rome that Egan &quot;was truly pious, learned, religious, remarkable for his great humility, but deficient, perhaps, in firmness and without great experience in the direction of affairs&quot;.

As a result of disruptions caused by the Napoleonic Wars, the papal bull nominating Egan did not reach the United States until 1810. When it arrived, Egan traveled to St. Peter&#x27;s Pro-Cathedral, in Baltimore, where he was ordained bishop by Carroll, assisted by Benedict Joseph Flaget and Jean-Louis de Cheverus, who had been appointed to bishoprics but had not yet been consecrated. Egan chose St. Mary&#x27;s to serve as his pro-cathedral in Philadelphia. Even before Egan&#x27;s installation, Philadelphia Catholics began to raise funds to expand the church in accordance with its new prominence in the diocese. After their ordinations, the new bishops planned a council of the American church leadership for the near future; in fact, they did not meet until 1829, long after Egan&#x27;s death.

===Trusteeism dispute===
Egan&#x27;s elevation to the episcopate worsened an existing conflict in the American church: the dispute over trusteeism. In Europe, the Church owned property and directly controlled its parishes through the clergy. In the United States, however, early Catholic churches were typically founded by laymen who purchased the property and erected the church buildings. The laymen accordingly demanded some control over the administration of the parish, even after the arrival of clergy from Europe who, like Egan, held the traditional view of parish organization. The dispute also had nationalist elements to it, as the heavily-German parish of Holy Trinity resented the imposition of an Irish bishop, instead of one of their own. When Holy Trinity&#x27;s pastor left for a new assignment in Maryland in 1811, the trustees there were perturbed at Egan&#x27;s temporary appointment of an Irish priest, Patrick Kenny, to lead the parish, until a German priest could be found (a German priest, Francis Roloff, was assigned the following year).

Egan&#x27;s own research into the issue showed that the trustees had conveyed St. Mary&#x27;s Church to the previous pastor, Robert Harding, and then to his heirs, but the trustees did not consider that property transfer to have extinguished their role in the church&#x27;s leadership. By 1811, Egan&#x27;s worsening health caused him to accept the assistance of two priests at St. Mary&#x27;s, James Harold and his nephew, William Vincent Harold. Egan and the trustees became further embroiled in a dispute about clerical salaries, a situation possibly made worse by the decline in shipping income in the port city caused by the outbreak of the War of 1812. Egan also came to believe the Harolds were making the situation worse by taking pro-clergy positions that were more extreme than Egan&#x27;s own and by the younger Harold&#x27;s scheming to be named Egan&#x27;s coadjutor bishop. He appealed to the trustees for compromise, and offered to bring his cousin (also a priest) over from Ireland to replace the elder Harold. By 1813, Egan and the trustees had reconciled and together resolved to remove the Harolds, who agreed to resign later that year and relocate to England.

===Death and burial===
Although the main complaints between bishop and trustees were resolved, some salary disputes lingered into 1813. The conditions at St. Mary&#x27;s worsened in 1814 with the election of new trustees who were more in conflict with Egan than the previous ones. Elsewhere in the diocese, Egan was more successful. In about 1811, he made his most extensive visitation of his diocese, travelling as far west as Pittsburgh after stopping in Lancaster and Conewago. He continued to raise funds for the Catholic orphanage and opened a new parish, Sacred Heart, in Trenton, New Jersey, in 1813, which brought the total number of churches in the diocese to 16.

Egan&#x27;s health continued to decline, and he died on July 22, 1814. While 19th-century chroniclers suggest that it &quot;may be said in all truth that Bishop Egan died of a broken heart,&quot; modern biographers believe that his health troubles more closely resembled tuberculosis. Egan was buried in St. Mary&#x27;s churchyard. In 1869, after the construction of the Cathedral Basilica of Saints Peter and Paul on Logan Square, his remains were removed there and reburied in a crypt along with those of his successor in the see of Philadelphia, Henry Conwell. Conwell-Egan Catholic High School in Fairless Hills, Pennsylvania, is named in honor of Egan and his successor.

<text>John Quincy Stewart (September 10, 1894 – March 19, 1972) was an American astrophysicist.

He obtained his Ph.D. in physics from Princeton University in 1919. He taught astrophysics at Princeton from 1921 until he retired in 1963.

Stewart was a civilian aeronautical engineer, an Army 1st Lieutenant, and later served as a chief instructor in the Army Engineering School, during World War I. He was later a research engineer in the American Telephone and Telegraph Company. He became interested in social physics in 1946, (first investigated in 1693 by astronomer Edmond Halley), demonstrating the use of physical laws in the area of social sciences, for example, demographic gravitation.

He co-wrote an influential two-volume textbook in 1927 with Raymond Smith Dugan and Henry Norris Russell: &quot;Astronomy: A Revision of Young’s Manual of Astronomy&quot; (Ginn &amp; Co., Boston, 1926–27, 1938, 1945). This became the standard astronomy textbook for about two decades. There were two volumes: the first was &quot;The Solar System&quot; and the second was &quot;Astrophysics and Stellar Astronomy&quot;.

<doc id="774778" wikidata="Q2726539" url="?curid=774778" title="St Werburghs">
<text>St Werburghs is an inner suburban neighbourhood in Bristol, England. It is in the Ashley electoral ward and Bristol Central parliamentary constituency, northeast of The Centre. 

St Werburghs does not have formal boundaries, but in typical usage encompasses an area roughly bounded by the Filton Bank railway to the northeast, M32 motorway to the southeast, Ashley Hill to the west, and the Ashley Vale escarpment to the north. It borders the neighbourhoods of Eastville to the northeast, Easton to the southeast, St Pauls to the south, Montpelier and St Andrews to the west, and Ashley Down to the northwest.

Whilst it has more of a cultural mix than Bristol, it is not as diverse as other inner city areas. It also has more family housing which has increased house prices. The area has less crime than the other inner city Bristol areas.

Mina Road is St Werburghs&#x27; &#x27;high street&#x27;, whose shops each have an imaginative figurehead protruding from their frontages indicating the type of trade on offer. The park opposite the shops contains an original example of a cast iron Victorian public lavatory.

St Werburghs has a city farm and has been the scene of several environmental campaigns including the development of a self-build housing community and the establishing of Narroways Hill as a Millennium Green and wildlife area.

== Geology ==
The solid geology of St Werburghs comprises Triassic Redcliffe Sandstone to the south-east of Glenfrome Road, and Triassic mudstone and halite-stone of the Mercia Mudstone Group to the north. The solid geology in the Mina Road Park area and in the valleys of the River Frome and Horfield Brook is overlain by superficial deposits of Quaternary alluvium.

== History ==
Before 1879 the northern part of the area now known as St Werburghs was referred to as Ashley Vale, and the southern part Baptist Mills. The area became known as St Werburghs in 1879 when St Werburgh&#x27;s Church was relocated (with substantial rebuilding) to Mina Road in this district from Corn Street, Bristol. The church is now a climbing centre run by The Climbing Academy.

The area was historically prone to serious flooding from the River Frome, notably in 1882 and 1889. There are still four Victorian flood marker posts. It was also a source of water supply for the city of Bristol through the Quay Pipe and The Boiling Wells.

The BBC Television series &quot;Only Fools and Horses&quot;, which was filmed in and around Bristol, used the allotments for the episode &#x27;Mother Nature&#x27;s Son&#x27;, and BBC wildlife and gardening programmes and &quot;Casualty&quot; have been filmed in the area.

== Transport ==
St Werburghs was served by the number 5 bus route and its replacement, 47 Bristol–Yate. The route was withdrawn in April 2023 leaving the area without a bus service.

<doc id="774779" wikidata="Q6908411" url="?curid=774779" title="Moorish Delta 7">
<text>Moorish Delta 7 (also known as MD7) is a hip-hop/UK garage outfit from the Newtown area of Birmingham, England. The trio was formed in 1995 and has sold over 50,000 records.

==History==
The group formed in 1995 as a growth of the then-large rap outfit Lyric Born Clique. Lyric Born Clique was an eight-piece rap collective featuring among many Golden Child, DJ Kingstun, Shortnerve, and Rawality. Initially, Moorish Delta 7 had four members with Shortnerve leaving shortly after the first EP. Their first release as &#x27;Moorish Delta 7&#x27; was an EP on Quartz Records (another Birmingham record label) called &quot;Taking Four Wicked Heads on the Way to North Africa&quot;. The EP was a mixture of dark beats, insightful lyrics, street imagery, humour and political commentary. The group quickly became known for their high energy performances and quickly became popular with audiences in the UK.

<text>William Allen Egan (October 8, 1914 – May 6, 1984) was an American Democratic politician. He served as the first governor of Alaska from January 3, 1959, to 1966 and 1970 to 1974, as well as a shadow U.S. senator from Alaska Territory from 1956 to 1959. Born in Valdez, Alaska, Egan is one of only two governors in the state&#x27;s history (along with Bill Walker) to have been born in Alaska. He was the Democratic nominee in the first five gubernatorial elections (1958, 1962, 1966, 1970, and 1974).

==Early childhood and adulthood==
The child of a working-class mining family of six children in Valdez, Egan was raised by his mother, Cora (Allen), following his father William&#x27;s death in an avalanche in 1920. By age 10, Egan was working in a local cannery, helping to support his struggling family. Thanks to the lack of driving laws in the Alaska Territory during the 1920s, Egan learned to drive at an early age, shuttling tourists around during summer months. By the age of 14, Egan was driving dump trucks for the Alaska Road Commission. Following his graduation as a valedictorian from Valdez High School in 1932, he began an interest in politics.

Egan&#x27;s godfather, Anthony Dimond, a local Valdez lawyer, two-time mayor and member of the Alaska Senate, ran as a Democrat for the territory&#x27;s nonvoting delegate to the U.S. House of Representatives the same year. Despite the position&#x27;s inability to vote due to Tennessee Plan, a nonvoting delegate could address other House members and lobby for both bills and statehood. Dimond won the race, introducing the young Egan, who viewed Dimond as his mentor, to territorial and federal politics. Dimond would send copies of the &quot;Congressional Record&quot; back to Egan in Valdez for him to read. 

==Political career==

Following on his godfather&#x27;s footsteps, Egan ran successfully as the Democratic candidate from Valdez in the Alaska Territorial House of Representatives in 1940, a post he would hold until 1945. He won three more terms to the House from 1947 to 1953. On November 16, 1940, Egan married Desdia Neva McKittrick (October 3, 1914 – January 19, 2011), a recent arrival to Valdez from Kansas. They had one child, a son, Dennis. During World War II, where Alaska&#x27;s own Aleutian Islands saw bloody combat between American and Imperial Japanese forces, Egan continued his political career. While still serving in the House of Representatives, Egan was elected as Mayor of Valdez in 1946. In 1953, Egan was elected to the Alaska Territorial Senate, and, in 1956, he was elected Territorial Shadow Senator, serving alongside Ernest Gruening.

===Alaska&#x27;s Constitutional Convention===
Following the end of the war, the Territory of Alaska&#x27;s political and geographical isolation was coming to an end. The construction of the Alaska Highway now linked the territory to the Lower 48 states and Canada, plus an increased military presence due to the Cold War with the neighboring Soviet Union had also brought the territory closer to the rest of North America.

In 1955, the Alaska Legislature ordered the creation of a constitutional convention to seek a state constitution suitable for Congressional approval. The convention met at the University of Alaska Fairbanks campus in November. Territorial Senator Egan was chosen to lead the body in drafting a new state document. Following the end of the convention a year later, the Alaska Constitution was sent to Alaskans as part of a referendum in 1958, passing easily. The statehood issue was turned over to the U.S. Congress later that year, passing by only one vote. President Dwight Eisenhower signed the resulting Alaska Statehood Act into law. Alaska was to become the 49th state.

===Governorship===
Alaska was scheduled to become a U.S. state on January 3, 1959. Egan decided to run to become Alaska&#x27;s first state governor. He won the race, becoming governor upon the state&#x27;s admission. During his first governorship, Egan supervised the transition of Alaska&#x27;s territorial bureaucracy into a state government. Egan also encouraged investment in the newest U.S. state, noting its slowly growing oil and tourist industries. During the 1964 Good Friday earthquake, which remains one of the strongest earthquakes of the modern era, Egan supervised and directed the state&#x27;s response to the disaster.

Defeated for re-election in 1966, Egan was elected again in 1970, serving a third term until his final defeat in 1974. The discovery of oil at Prudhoe Bay in 1968 and the 1973 Oil Crisis in response to the Yom Kippur War played a large role in Egan&#x27;s last term, as demand for oil increasingly played a role in the state&#x27;s politics. In late 1973, President Richard Nixon signed the Trans-Alaska Pipeline Authorization Act, an act to reduce American dependence on OPEC oil. Many environmentalist politicians in the state bitterly opposed this federal legislation. Egan was defeated for re-election in 1974 by Jay Hammond, in one of 4 Republican gubernatorial flips that year.

==Later life==
Following Egan&#x27;s departure from the governorship in 1974, Egan retired from public and political life. He died 10 years following leaving office on May 6, 1984, at the age of 69 from lung cancer. His son, Dennis Egan, served as the mayor of Juneau, Alaska from 1995 to 2000, and as a state senator from 2009 to 2019.

<text>Warren B. Offutt (February 13, 1928 – September 20, 2017) was an American amateur astronomer and amateur radio operator.

Offutt is credited by the Minor Planet Center with the discovery of 17 asteroids and has notably collaborated with professional astronomers in observing Kuiper belt objects (KBOs). In 1999 he won the Amateur Achievement Award of the Astronomical Society of the Pacific.

Offutt and his wife, Beverly (since deceased), moved from Illinois to New Mexico when he retired from engineering, specializing in precision astrometry of faint objects in the Solar System. He operates the &quot;W &amp; B Observatory&quot; () in the U.S. village of Cloudcroft, New Mexico, in the Sacramento Mountains, at an altitude of 2500 m (8300 ft).

In 1997, Offutt helped with three more major discoveries, among them confirmation of a then-newly discovered moon of Uranus, Sycorax.

On 11 February 1998, the outer main-belt asteroid 7639 Offutt was named after him, just before his 70th birthday ().

<doc id="774803" wikidata="Q2075468" url="?curid=774803" title="Trambaix">
<text>The Trambaix () is one of Barcelona&#x27;s three tram systems. It is operated by TRAMMET connecting the Baix Llobregat area with the city of Barcelona, Catalonia, Spain. It opened to the public on 5 April 2004 after a weekend when the tram could be used free of charge.

The Trambaix includes three different routes (T1, T2 and T3). The tram route starts at Plaça Francesc Macià in Barcelona to the west of the city and extends west, passing L&#x27;Hospitalet de Llobregat, Esplugues de Llobregat, Cornellà de Llobregat, Sant Joan Despí and Sant Just Desvern. An extension of Tram T3 opened on 8 December 2006, as far as Consell Comarcal in Sant Feliu de Llobregat. The yearly ridership of all of its lines combined is of 15,057,318 passengers as of 2008.

The Trambaix complements the Trambesòs that runs to the north-east of the city. Both networks will be interconnected through Avinguda Diagonal in the next construction phase.

==Tram future==

Since the modern tram system launched in 2004, the possibility was envisaged to connect Trambaix and Trambesòs. In September 2008 the mayor of Barcelona, Jordi Hereu, said in a TV programme that in the near future (2011–2012) both tram networks would be connected along the Diagonal Avenue. Despite the Generalitat de Catalunya&#x27;s efforts to promote it, the project remained on hold for over a decade. Finally in January 2019, Barcelona&#x27;s city council approved the project with support of mayoress Ada Colau.

The project is divided into two phases. Phase 1 extends the Trambesòs network from Glòries to Verdaguer, serving Monumental and Sicília along the way. Monumental will provide an interchange with Line 2 of the Barcelona Metro. Verdaguer will provide an interchange with line 4 and line 5. The route is 1.8km and has a travel time of 7 minutes. This phase entered construction in 2022 and opened in November 2024. Phase 2 will link Verdaguer with Francesc Macià, thus completing the connection of the two separate tram networks. This section would serve the stations of Diagonal, Balmes and Casanova. Works are expected to begin once phase 1 has been completed.

<text>Transportation systems management is a set of techniques used to increase the capacity of a piece of transportation infrastructure without increasing its physical size. Most often, these techniques are used in the context of roadways. In this context, transportation systems management techniques may include changes to traffic signals, such as coordinating them or introducing ramp metering, or minor changes to road geometry, such as straightening corners or lengthening merge lanes. These low-cost interventions can be very effective in reducing congestion under some circumstances.

Due to the low cost of transportation systems management, it is often included as a reference option in cost-benefit analyses and environmental impact statements for new roadways or mass transit links, such as busways, metros, and light rail lines. It is typically considered in conjunction with the default &quot;no-build&quot; option.

<doc id="774811" wikidata="Q604366" url="?curid=774811" title="Pedersen device">
<text>The Pedersen device was an experimental weapon attachment for the M1903 Springfield bolt action rifle that allowed it to fire a .30 caliber (7.62 mm) pistol-type cartridge in semi-automatic fire mode. The attachment was developed to allow an infantryman to convert &quot;their rifle to a form of submachine gun or automatic rifle&quot; in approximately 15 seconds.

Production of the Pedersen device and modified M1903 rifles started in 1918. However, World War I ended before they could be fielded. The contract was cancelled on March 1, 1919, after production of 65,000 devices, 1.6 million magazines, 65 million cartridges, and 101,775 modified Springfield rifles.

The devices, magazines, ammunition and rifles were subsequently placed in storage, and declared surplus in 1931. When the United States Army decided they did not want to pay the cost of storing the devices, nearly all of the stored devices were destroyed except for a few examples kept by the Ordnance Department. Fewer than 100 Pedersen devices escaped ordered destruction to become extremely rare collectors&#x27; items.

==History==
Prior to the United States&#x27; entry into World War I, John Pedersen, a longtime employee of Remington Arms, developed the Pedersen device. His idea was to dramatically increase the firepower available to the average infantryman. His final design replaced the bolt of a modified Springfield M1903 rifle with a device consisting of a complete firing mechanism and a small &quot;barrel&quot; for a new .30 caliber pistol like cartridge.

In effect, the &quot;device&quot; was essentially a complete blowback pistol minus a receiver-grip using the short &quot;barrel&quot; of the device to fit into the longer chamber of the M1903 rifle. The mechanism was fed by a long 40-round magazine sticking perpendicularly out of the rifle at a 45-degree angle to the top right, and could be reloaded by inserting a new magazine. Each magazine had cut-out viewing slots facing aft so the rifleman could observe the number of unfired rounds remaining. The system required an ejection port to be cut into the left side of the M1903 rifle&#x27;s receiver and the adjacent stock cut away to allow clearance for spent cartridges being thrown from the action. The sear, trigger, and magazine cut-off also required modifications which did not limit the ability of Mark I receivers to function in the normal bolt-action mode.

Pedersen traveled to Washington, D.C. on 8 October 1917 to conduct a secret demonstration for Chief of Ordnance General William Crozier and a selected group of army officers and congressmen. After firing several rounds from what appeared to be an unmodified Springfield, he removed the standard bolt, inserted the device, and fired several magazines at a very high rate of fire. The evaluation team was favorably impressed. To deceive the enemy, the Ordnance Department decided to call it the US Automatic Pistol, Caliber .30, Model of 1918. Plans were put into place to start production of modified Springfields, which became the US Rifle, Cal. .30, Model of M1903, Mark I. The Army placed orders for 133,450 devices and 800,000,000 cartridges for the 1919 Spring Offensive. General John J. Pershing requested 40 magazines and 5000 rounds of ammunition be shipped with each device and anticipated an average daily ammunition use of 100 rounds per device. The use of the Pedersen device in the 1919 spring offensive was to be in conjunction with the full combat introduction of the M1918 Browning Automatic Rifle (BAR.)

The US Patent Office issued , , , and to Pedersen for his invention. The United States Army paid Pedersen $50,000 for rights to produce the device and a royalty of 50 cents for each device manufactured. The Army paid for all necessary machinery required to manufacture the device, and Remington received a net profit of two dollars for each device and 3 cents for each magazine.

A Mark II Pedersen Device was also designed for the M1917 &quot;American Enfield&quot; and a similar prototype was made for the Remington-produced Mosin–Nagant; neither of those were ever put into production.

==Production==
Production of the device started in 1918, along with the modified rifle that December, after the war ended. The contract was cancelled on 1 March 1919 after production of 65,000 devices with 1.6 million magazines, 65 million cartridges and 101,775 modified Springfield rifles. Each device was to be issued with a belt including a stamped, sheet-steel scabbard for safely carrying the device when not in use, a canvas pouch to hold the M1903 rifle bolt when not in use, and canvas pouches holding five magazines. The device with two pouches of loaded magazines added 14 pounds to the infantryman&#x27;s standard load.

Remington subcontracted magazine production to Mount Vernon Silversmiths, and the carrying scabbards were manufactured by Gorham Manufacturing Company. Canvas pouches for magazines and for the rifle bolt were manufactured at Rock Island Arsenal.

Ammunition was packaged in 40-round boxes sufficient to fill one magazine. Five boxes were packed in a carton corresponding to the five-magazine pouches, and three cartons were carried in a light canvas bandolier holding 600 cartridges. Five bandoliers were packed in a wooden crate. Ammunition produced by Remington is headstamped &quot;RA&quot; (or &quot;RAH&quot; for the Hoboken, New Jersey plant) with the years (19-) &quot;18&quot;, &quot;19&quot;, and &quot;20&quot;.

==Post-war==
After the war, the semi-automatic concept started to gain currency in the U.S. Army. By the late 1920s, the Army was experimenting with several new semi-automatic rifle designs, including the Pedersen rifle firing a new .276 (7 mm) rifle cartridge. However, the Pedersen rifle lost to a new semi-automatic rifle designed by John C. Garand. The Garand was originally developed for .30-06 cartridge and converted to the new .276 cartridge. After the .276 Garand rifle was selected over the Pedersen rifle, General Douglas MacArthur came out against changing rifle cartridges, since the Army had vast stockpiles of .30–06 ammunition left over from World War I, the .30-06 would have to be retained for machine gun use, and one cartridge simplified wartime logistics. Garand reverted his design back to the standard .30-06 Springfield cartridge in 1932; the result became the M1 Garand.

The Pedersen device was declared surplus in 1931, five years before the Garand had even started serial production. Mark I rifles were altered to M1903 standard in 1937 (except for, curiously, an ejection slot that remained in the receiver side wall) and were used alongside standard M1903 and M1903A1 Springfields. Nearly all of the stored devices were destroyed by the Army except for a few Ordnance Department examples, when it was decided they did not want to pay the cost of storing. They were burned in a large bonfire, though some were taken during the process. Following their destruction, noted writer Julian Hatcher wrote an authoritative article for the May 1932 issue of American Rifleman magazine describing the device in detail.

<doc id="774819" wikidata="Q2313027" url="?curid=774819" title="Trambesòs">
<text>Trambesòs () is a tram–light rail system in the Spanish autonomous community of Catalonia that links the Barcelona district of Sant Martí with Badalona and Sant Adrià de Besòs. Its name comes from the union of the words &quot;tram&quot;, an abbreviation of the Catalan word for &quot;tram&quot; (&quot;tramvia&quot;), and &quot;Besòs&quot;, the name of an area in the north of the Barcelonès region dominated by the Besòs River.

The first section of Trambesòs was opened on 8 May 2004 as part of route T4 and since its opening it has undergone several extensions. The most recent extension opened on November 10, 2024. It was the first step to connect the network to the Trambaix along the Avinguda Diagonal, with a three station extension from Glòries to Verdaguer.

Trambesòs is operated by TRAM. It complements the Trambaix that runs to the south-west of the city. The networks are slated to be interconnected through Avinguda Diagonal in the final construction phase.

==System overview==
The system comprises 29 stops and has a total length of whereby three different routes are run. The network is configured as a double-track electrified tramline built to the standard track gauge that starts near Parc de la Ciutadella in the Barcelona district of Sant Martí and continues towards Badalona and Sant Adrià de Besòs through Gran Via de les Corts Catalanes and Avinguda Diagonal, the system&#x27;s two main arterial corridors to enter Barcelona. There is also another branch that crosses the La Rambla de la Mina street in Sant Adrià and connects the Gran Via section with the Avinguda Diagonal one. The Avinguda Diagonal branch was extended to Verdaguer in November 2024.

Trambesòs uses exclusive infrastructure such as a reserved platform for its circulation along all its route and dedicated signaling. The exclusive use of the reserved platform by the tram is meant to provide greater regularity, speed and safety, and it only has contact with other vehicles at several existing at-grade intersections with the local street system. These intersections are regulated by traffic lights, which do not have the traffic signal preemption system fully operational, what would allow the tram to reach . The reserved platform houses the tracks, the overhead contact system, the dedicated signaling and the railway platforms. In addition, it is level with the sidewalks in most of its path and is sometimes grass-covered or simply covered in concrete or asphalt concrete like the road surface. In order to supply electric power to the overhead line, six substations were built along the line, providing a voltage of 750 V DC. The contact wire has a cross-section of supported by several metallic utility poles positioned along the railway tracks.

The rolling stock operated on the network is composed of 18 Citadis 302 low-floor trams built in its variation &quot;Barcelona&quot; (teal and white colors) by Alstom at its manufacturing plant in Santa Perpètua de Mogoda. Tram units are parked and maintained at the only depot of Trambesòs located next to Central Tèrmica del Besòs stop, on a triangular piece of land between the Ronda Litoral coastal beltway and the Barcelona–Mataró–Maçanet-Massanes railway.

Autoritat del Transport Metropolità (ATM) is the transport authority responsible for fares and ticketing, and for marketing the network. Trambesòs is part of the integrated fare system within Barcelona metropolitan area and is entirely within ATM fare zone 1. Fares are the same as the ones applied on Trambaix as well as the ticket system. Single tickets can be purchased at stops by using ticket machines and allow you to transfer between other Trambesòs routes for 30 minutes without having to buy another ticket. All tickets or other transportation cards must be validated in a machine by the door of the tram although underground stops have ticket barriers so there is no need to validate the ticket on the tram.

===Stops===

The system currently comprises 27 stops, each following the same design and technical characteristics as Trambaix stops. Almost all stops have low platforms ( above rail level) with a ramp at each end of the platform. This allows wheelchairs, prams, pushchairs and the elderly to board the tram easily with no steps. The stops also have different platform layouts depending on the street section where they are located. Currently there are 8 stops with 1 island platform and 19 stops with 2 side platforms, three of which are located underground in the Gran Via section. There are also 8 stops that offer a transfer to Barcelona Metro network while only Estació de Sant Adrià stop offers a transfer to Rodalies de Catalunya commuter rail services, becoming the only stop of the whole network that offers a transfer to some kind of heavy rail services.

Design and facilities of the stops are meant to provide universal access as one of the goals of the network since its planning. The stops follow a common design that has a discrete look to them, dominated by metallic materials and panes of glass. Facilities for passengers include one or two shelters equipped with an intercom, a PA system, a passenger information display (PID), a CCTV system, a noticeboard and ticket vending machines. The shelters were designed by architects Antoni Roselló and Rafael Cáceres, who were awarded in the design section of the 2004 City of Barcelona Awards for this design.

===Routes===
Three east–west routes currently make up the Trambesòs system. The Gran Via section is used by both routes T5 and T6, while the Avinguda Diagonal section and the branch in the La Mina neighbourhood are only used by routes T4 and T6, respectively. All routes converge at Plaça de les Glòries Catalanes, making it the only station in the whole network that provides a transfer to all Trambesòs routes. The routes were reorganized in October 2024 to accommodate the network&#x27;s expansion along Avinguda Diagonal.

Routes are generally displayed by a teal square with a white &quot;T&quot; followed by the route number in it (e.g.  ). Trambaix routes are also displayed with a &quot;T&quot; to stand out those are also tram services so the difference between the two networks is on the numbering: Trambaix uses numbers 1–3, while Trambesòs uses numbers 4–6.

* Route T4 starts in Verdaguer station and follows Aviguda Diagonal towards Plaça de les Glòries Catalanes through Avinguda Meridiana. Then it continues towards Sant Adrià de Besòs railway station via Avinguda Diagonal and Avinguda d&#x27;Eduard Maristany, where it runs parallel to the sea.
* Route T5 starts in Ciutadella and terminates at Gorg metro station in Badalona via the Gran Via section.
* Route T6 runs from Ciutadella to Sant Adrià de Besòs railway station sharing the Gran Via section together with route T5 and via the branch that runs across La Mina neighbourhood in Sant Adrià. Formerly, this route had run from Sant Adrià de Besòs railway station to Gorg metro station in Badalona via La Mina branch without entering Barcelona.

==Future developments==

===Linkage with Trambaix===

The original project about the introduction of a modern tram system in Barcelona comprised the creation of a new tram route covering the whole Avinguda Diagonal, between Zona Universitària and Diagonal Mar shopping mall. With the opening of Trambaix and Trambesòs, the possibility of creating a new tram line through Avinguda Diagonal connecting both networks became more popular, and even saw a demonstration in favour of the union of the two tram networks in late September 2005. That same year, and after the announcement by the Generalitat of Catalonia to study the project, the Barcelona City Council announced its opposition, even after the publication of two studies that positively assessed the linkage through Diagonal.

In 2008, the Mayor of Barcelona Jordi Hereu announced the refurbishment of Avinguda Diagonal, which included the construction of the new tram line. The creation of a new office to carry out the &quot;Diagonal Project&quot; was also announced and because of opposition demand, a referendum would be held among other actions to enhance citizen participation, the first referendum proclaimed by the City Council ever to be held in Barcelona. During the participatory and technical process involved in the refurbishment of Avinguda Diagonal throughout 2009, various questions and suggestions were raised to the City Council, and many of the points of the reform such as the construction of the new tram line were called into question. The referendum was officially announced in December and was planned to be held on 10–16 May 2010 with two projects to be chosen and an option to dismiss them. The voting process would take place at several municipal offices used as polling places by voting using touchscreens, though it was also possible to vote through the Internet. Citizens were asked about how they would prefer to reform the avenue, and if they would prefer to convert it into a boulevard or an avenue of a pedestrian walkway nature. The development of the referendum was marked by fierce controversy from day one, and specially because of continuous technical faults involving the electronic voting system. The winning option was finally the &quot;C&quot; one, dismissing all of the projects with almost 80% of votes counted. After the failed referendum, there was a political crisis of the Barcelona City Council which resulted with the resignation of two politicians from the local government team, and the linking of the two tram networks appeared to have stagnated.

The succeeding local government, headed by Xavier Trias in 2011, dismissed the proposal of connecting Trambaix and Trambesòs through Avinguda Diagonal, though it has been agreed to reactivate the linkage project with the Generalitat. Trias stated he was committed to connecting the two tram systems through different streets in the district of Eixample and objects to the construction of a tram line through Diagonal. One of the new proposed routes would mostly pass through Provença Street, creating a sort of &quot;shuttle tram&quot; for tourists between Sagrada Família and La Pedrera, while the other one would mostly pass through Gran Via. However, this was never realised, with Trambaix and Trambesòs remaining unconnected upon the departure of Trias&#x27; government in 2015.
Mayor Ada Colau continued promoting the connection of the TRAM along the Avinguda Diagonal, however was defeated by opposition parties when she presented the proposal to the city council in 2018. The first part of the connection was finally passed in December 2020, with the first section reaching Verdaguer (from Glòries) being opened in November 2024.

Incumbent mayor Jaume Collboni was initially hesitant about the final swift connection, voicing his concerns with the current L8 extension works at Plaça de Francesc Macià, Avinguda Diagonal, with Catalan Minister of Territory Ester Capella coming out denying any sort of incompatibility. Later, Collboni vowed to start the final connection of the tram lines only if the City&#x27;s and Catalan budgets were passed. On 13 November, 3 days after the public opening of the new tram extension from Glòries to Verdaguer it was reported that Mayor Collboni planned to split the final 2 km in two stages: the first up to Passeig de Gràcia (1 station) and the second to Francesc Macià (3 remaining stations), with the City Council government focusing &quot;in the first stage for now&quot; and &quot;not the latter&quot;. Before the splitting was announced, works for the whole final 2 km were expected to finish in 2028.

===Other projects===
The Infrastructure Master Plan (PDI) 2011–2020 by the Autoritat del Transport Metropolità (ATM) for Barcelona metropolitan area includes various proposals to extend the existing tram network. In general, it is about extension projects on existing routes following major arterial corridors and with a completion of projects beyond 2020.

* Estació de Sant Adrià ↔ Port de Badalona: The expansion of route T4 from Sant Adrià de Besòs railway station towards Badalona will comprise the construction of 3 new stops, 1.7 km of tracks along Eduard Maristany Avenue and the purchase of a new tramcar. It is meant to serve Badalona&#x27;s coastal strip and gain more than 3,000 new passengers, 270 of which from the private car. That new section has an estimated cost of €22 million and is expected to be further extended to reach Badalona railway station in a future.
* Ciutadella | Vila Olímpica ↔ World Trade Center: It is expected to give continuity to the current southern terminus of route T4 situated at Ciutadella – Vila Olímpica stop with that extension project. The new suggested route would surround Parc de la Ciutadella passing through the nearest side to the sea, and then it would follow Barcelona&#x27;s coastal strip up to the waterfront where World Trade Center Barcelona is located, serving the Port Vell area included in the Barcelona Seaport complex.
* Auditori | Teatre Nacional ↔ Plaça Urquinaona: This enlargement is proposed as an extension of route T5 towards Barcelona city centre that starts near Auditori – Teatre Nacional stop up to Plaça Urquinaona, passing through the arterial corridors of Vilanova Avenue and Ronda de Sant Pere.
* Torribera ↔ Sant Adrià: Although this project does not appear in the updated PDI 2011–2020, it has been proposed by the Sant Coloma de Gramenet City Council and appeared on PDI 2010–2018 which was drawn up by the former government of the Generalitat of Catalonia and the ATM. The project involves the construction of a new tram line connected to Trambesòs network and which could be built as an extension of route T6. That new tram line would run parallel to the arterial corridor that is formed by the drainage basin of river Besòs, linking the municipality of Sant Adrià de Besòs to Santa Coloma de Gramenet up to Torribera Center, a Diputació de Barcelona-owned building used by the University of Barcelona (UB) located in the northern part of town.

==Vandalism==
Trambesòs is one of the public transport networks in Barcelona metropolitan area with one of the highest rates of fraud, incivility and vandalism This results in €275,000 per year in added expenses for TRAM. It is estimated that one in three Trambesòs users travel without paying, being the final section of routes T5 and T6 where more cases involving fraud in the ticket payment are reported, and whereby even incidents with ticket inspectors are also reported, sometimes involving the intervention by the police force. Attacks on tram drivers have also been reported of which one of the most controversial was when a group of 15 people were waiting at Gorg stop in Badalona at 1:00 am for the arrival of the tram to lynch the driver, who tried to shut himself inside the driving cab, being unable to avoid punches. After this controversial aggression, TRAM decided to strengthen security on the network, mainly at Gorg, Estació de Sant Adrià and Ciutadella – Vila Olímpica stops. It was also decided to rely on popular mediators who are natives from the affected area and selected by the Federation of Gypsy Associations in Catalonia (Fagic) to minimize vandalism, making possible to solve several conflicts.

<text>Edward Eggleston (December 10, 1837 – September 3, 1902) was an American historian and novelist.

==Biography==
Eggleston was born in Vevay, Indiana on December 10, 1837, to Joseph Cary Eggleston and Mary Jane Craig. The author George Cary Eggleston was his brother. As a child, he was too ill to regularly attend school, so his education was primarily provided by his father. He was ordained as a Methodist minister in 1856. He wrote a number of tales, some of which, especially the &quot;Hoosier&quot; series, attracted much attention. Among these are &quot;The Hoosier Schoolmaster&quot;, &quot;The Hoosier Schoolboy&quot;, &quot;The End of the World&quot;, &quot;The Faith Doctor&quot;, and &quot;Queer Stories for Boys and Girls&quot;.

Eggleston used well-known historical events as the basis for several of his novels. In &quot;The End of the World&quot;, he describes the build-up to the Second Coming of Christ in 1843, as prophesied by William Miller, set in southern Indiana. &quot;The Graysons&quot; is a fictionalized account of a famous murder trial that Abraham Lincoln won in 1858 in central Illinois. Other books were romanticized stories based on his personal experiences, including &quot;The Mystery of Metropolisville&quot;, about land speculation in southern Minnesota, and &quot;The Circuit Rider&quot;, about itinerant preachers, set in southwestern Ohio. Most of his novels contain characters who speak in local &quot;dialect&quot;.

He wrote many articles for the children&#x27;s magazine &quot;The Little Corporal&quot;, and in 1866, he worked as an editor for the periodical. In December 1866 he accepted a higher-paying editorial position at &quot;The Sunday School Teacher&quot;.
From 1869 to 1877 Eggleston edited the eight-page weekly publication &quot;Little Folks&quot;, advertised as being &quot;an illustrated Paper, for every Sunday, for Infant Scholars.&quot; He wrote two stories for each issue. In 1871 he was briefly the supervising editor of the New York periodical &quot;The Independent&quot;.

In 1884, Eggleston helped organize the American Historical Association. He was elected its president in 1899. In his presidential address, he called for a change from a history of important battles to one of important lives. Eggleston was elected a member of the American Antiquarian Society in 1893.

His boyhood home at Vevay, Indiana, known as the Edward and George Cary Eggleston House, was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1973. His summer home, Owl&#x27;s Nest, in Lake George, New York, eventually became his year-round home. Eggleston died there on September 3, 1902, at the age of 64. Owl&#x27;s Nest was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1971. 

His oldest daughter, the writer Elizabeth Eggleston Seelye, was married to Elwyn Seelye, the founder of the New York State Historical Association. His second daughter, Allegra Eggleston, was an artist and illustrator. She collaborated with her sister and her father on a number of books including &quot;The Story of Columbus&quot;, &quot;The Story of Washington&quot;, and &quot;The Graysons&quot;. He had a third daughter, Blanche, and a son, Edward William, who died at age 3.

<text>Mot ( &quot;mūt&quot;, &quot;māweṯ&quot;, ) was the Canaanite god of death and the Underworld. He was also known to the people of Ugarit and in Phoenicia, where Canaanite religion was widespread. The main source of information about Mot in Canaanite mythology comes from the texts discovered at Ugarit, but he is also mentioned in the surviving fragments of Philo of Byblos&#x27;s Greek translation of the writings of the Phoenician Sanchuniathon.

==Forms of the name==
In Ugaritic myth, Mot (spelled &quot;mt&quot;) is a personification of death. The word belongs to a set of cognates meaning &#x27;death&#x27; in other Semitic and Afro-Asiatic languages: Arabic موت &quot;mawt&quot;; Hebrew מות (&quot;mot&quot; or &quot;mavet&quot;; ancient Hebrew &quot;muth&quot; or &quot;maveth&quot;/&quot;maweth&quot;); Maltese &quot;mewt&quot;; Syriac ܡܰܘܬܳܐ (&quot;mautā&quot;); Ge&#x27;ez ሞት (&quot;mot&quot;); Canaanite, Egyptian, Berber, Aramaic, Nabataean, and Palmyrene מות (&quot;mwt&quot;); Jewish Aramaic, Christian Palestinian Aramaic, and Samaritan מותא (&quot;mwt’&quot;); Mandaean &quot;muta&quot;; Akkadian 𒍗 (&quot;mūtu&quot;); Hausa &quot;mutuwa&quot;; and Angas &quot;mut&quot;.

==Religion and mythology==
===Ugaritic texts===
The main source of the story of Mot (&quot;Death&quot;) is Ugaritic. He is a son of &#x27;El, and according to instructions given by the god Hadad (Ba&#x27;al) to his messengers, lives in a city named &quot;hmry&quot; (&#x27;Mirey&#x27;), a pit is his throne, and Filth is the land of his heritage. But Ba&#x27;al warns them:

&lt;poem&gt;that you not come near to divine Death,
lest he make you like a lamb in his mouth,
(and) you both be carried away like a kid in the breach of his windpipe.&lt;/poem&gt;

Hadad seems to be urging Mot to come to his feast and submit himself to him.

Death sends back a message that his appetite is that of lions in the wilderness, like the longing of dolphins in the sea, and he threatens to devour Ba&#x27;al himself. In a subsequent passage, Death seemingly makes good his threat, or at least is deceived into believing he has slain Ba&#x27;al. Numerous gaps in the text make this portion of the tale obscure. The sun stops shining as its goddess Shapash joins Ba&#x27;al&#x27;s sister &#x27;Anat in burying him. &#x27;Anat then comes upon Mot, seizing him, splitting him with a blade, winnowing him in a sieve, burning him in a fire, grinding him under a millstone, and throwing what remains in the end over a field for birds to devour.

El, Baal&#x27;s father, dreams that Baal is alive and sends Shapash to bring him back to life because the land has become dry.

After seven years, Death returns, seeking vengeance and demanding one of Ba&#x27;al&#x27;s brothers to feed upon. A gap in the text is followed by Mot complaining that Ba&#x27;al has given Mot his own brothers to eat and his mother&#x27;s sons to consume. A single combat between the two breaks out until the sun goddess Shapash upbraids Mot, informing him that his own father, El, will turn against him and overturn his throne if he continues. Mot concedes, and the conflict ends.

====Influence on the Passover====
A few scholars have postulated the idea that the Jewish tradition of Passover may have begun as a ritual connected with the myth of Mot killing Baal, as Baal was the god of rain among the Canaanites and certain other Semitic nations. Modern scholars have disputed such views as a failure to take into account the original narrative and cultural context, pointing instead to a purposeful subversion of the Baal/Mot myth on the part of the authors of the Hebrew Bible, working in a framework of an audience who were well-acquainted with the religious worldview of the surrounding nations.

===Phoenician sources===
A Phoenician account survives in a paraphrase of the Greek author Philo of Byblos by Eusebius, who writes of a Phoenician historian named Sanchuniathon. In this account, Death is a son of &#x27;El and counted as a god, as the text says in speaking of &#x27;El/Cronus:

And not long after another of his sons by Rhea, named Muth, having died, he deifies him, and the Phoenicians call him Thanatos [&#x27;Death&#x27;] and Pluto.

But in an earlier philosophical creation myth, Sanchuniathon refers to a great wind that merged with its parents, and that connection was called &#x27;Desire&#x27; (πόθος):

From its connection, Mot was produced, which some say is mud, and others a putrescence of watery compound; and out of this came every germ of creation and the generation of the universe. So there were certain animals which had no sensation, and out of them grew intelligent animals, and were called &quot;Zophasemin&quot;, that is &quot;observers of heaven&quot;; and they were formed like the shape of an egg. Also Mot burst forth into light, and sun, and moon, and stars, and the great constellations.

The form &quot;Mot&quot; (Μώτ) here is not the same as &quot;Muth&quot; (Μοὺθ) which appears later.

===Hebrew scriptures===
In Hebrew scriptures, Death (&quot;&quot;Maweth&quot;/&quot;Mavet(h)&quot;&quot;) is sometimes linguistically personified, as in and .

<text>George Cary Eggleston (26 November 1839 – 14 April 1911) American writer and brother of fellow writer Edward Eggleston (1837–1902). Sons of Joseph Cary Eggleston and Mary Jane Craig. After the American Civil War he published a serialized account of his time as a Confederate soldier in &quot;The Atlantic Monthly&quot;. These serialized articles were later collected and expanded upon and published under the title &quot;A Rebel&#x27;s Recollections.&quot;

He coined the term champagne socialist in his 1906 book &#x27;Blind Alleys&#x27; in which a character distinguishes the &#x27;beer socialist&#x27; who &quot;wants everybody to come down to his low standards of living&quot; and the &#x27;champagne socialist&#x27; who &quot;wants everybody to be equal on the higher plane that suits him, utterly ignoring the fact that there is not enough champagne, green turtle and truffles to go round&quot;.

He also served as an editor of &quot;Hearth and Home&quot; magazine in the early 1870s.

His boyhood home at Vevay, Indiana, known as the Edward and George Cary Eggleston House, was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1973.

<text>Tiago Cardoso Mendes (; born 2 May 1981), known simply as Tiago, is a Portuguese former footballer who played as a midfielder.

He played professionally in five of Europe&#x27;s major leagues, Portugal, England, France, Italy and Spain. He notably spent eight seasons with Atlético Madrid, winning five major titles including the 2013–14 La Liga and the 2012 Europa League.

A Portugal international on 66 occasions, Tiago represented the nation in two World Cups and Euro 2004. He later worked briefly as a manager.

==Club career==
===Portugal===
Born in Viana do Castelo, Tiago first came to prominence at S.C. Braga (having started out at SC Vianense, he also played handball for one year as a youth), being cast into the Minho side&#x27;s starting XI at the age of just 18 and helping with 27 games as they finished in fourth place in 2001, thus qualifying for the UEFA Cup.

In late December 2001, solid displays earned Tiago – and Braga teammates Armando Sá and Ricardo Rocha – a move to giants S.L. Benfica. In his first full season he scored a career-best 13 goals to help to a runner-up position in the Primeira Liga and, the following year, won the Taça de Portugal against FC Porto.

===Chelsea===
Tiago signed for Chelsea on 20 July 2004 for a €15 million fee, becoming José Mourinho&#x27;s sixth signing that season (this included three other Portuguese players). Having missed the first Premier League game, he soon became an important member of his new team, scoring on his away debut against Crystal Palace on 24 August; he also scored a long-range goal in a 3–1 win over Manchester United on 10 May 2005, after already having won the title.

Tiago was a regular for Chelsea, having only missed four games in the league. He ended the season successfully as a firm fixture in the Blues&#x27; midfield three, making 51 appearances in all competitions and scoring four goals as the club also added the Football League Cup. However, despite his initial success, the following campaign saw the arrival of Michael Essien from Olympique Lyonnais, which limited his first-team chances; during his time at Stamford Bridge his loss percentage in the league was 2.94%, just once in 34 appearances – 1–0 at Manchester City on 16 October 2004 – which was the lowest in history for any player having appeared at least 20 times.

===Lyon===
In late August 2005, Tiago signed for Lyon on a four-year contract, for a €10.1 million transfer fee. Usually playing in a defensive midfield role alongside Juninho Pernambucano, Mahamadou Diarra and Florent Malouda, he excelled for his team, scoring seven goals in 37 appearances. The highlights of his first season in France were a pair of goals against PSV Eindhoven that took them into the quarter-finals in the UEFA Champions League, and the winning goal against Troyes AC on 1 April 2006; the club finished top of Ligue 1, winning a fifth consecutive accolade.

After the departure of Diarra to Real Madrid the following campaign, Tiago began to play a more significant role in Lyon&#x27;s midfield with his former teammate&#x27;s replacement Jérémy Toulalan. He won his second league title and helped reach the final of the Coupe de la Ligue, lost to FC Girondins de Bordeaux after a last-minute strike; overall, he netted six times in 38 matches.

===Juventus===
On 17 June 2007, Lyon president Jean-Michel Aulas confirmed that Tiago&#x27;s departure from Lyon was imminent with both Juventus FC and A.C. Milan reportedly after his signature; he officially signed for the former five days later, for a €13 million fee. His performance in 2007–08 was criticised, however, with Goal.com describing him as the third biggest of the season.
The start of the following campaign gave Tiago an opportunity to return to the Premier League in the form of year-long loan offer from Everton, with the Italians agreeing to the deal but with the player refusing to terms. The negotiations had a violent end when he forcibly locked Juventus president Giovanni Cobolli Gigli inside a toilet stall – the chairman was finally rescued by captain Alessandro Del Piero, more than an hour later. He eventually established himself in Claudio Ranieri&#x27;s side but, in November 2008, against Inter Milan, he was stretchered off the pitch with a serious knee injury just several minutes into the match, and was sidelined for almost two months.

Tiago returned to the bench for the January match against S.S. Lazio, but found himself down the pecking order as Cristiano Zanetti, Mohamed Sissoko, and emerging youngster Claudio Marchisio were Ranieri&#x27;s preferred centre midfield pairing. Following injuries to Sissoko and later Marchisio he was back in the starting XI, but his return was soured by a straight red card in the &quot;Derby d&#x27;Italia&quot; fixture in April (1–1 home draw).

The first half of 2009–10 was one to forget for Tiago. With the arrivals of midfielders Diego and Felipe Melo, coupled by his slight dip in form, his appearances were again limited; under Ciro Ferrara he was relegated to the bench once again, only making seven Serie A appearances.

===Atlético Madrid===
On 8 January 2010, Tiago joined Atlético Madrid on loan until the end of the season. He scored his first league goal in nearly three years on 21 January, heading home against RC Celta de Vigo in a 1–1 home draw in the quarter-finals of the Copa del Rey (2–1 aggregate win); gradually, he established himself in the starting lineup ahead of longtime incumbent Raúl García, also reuniting with former Benfica teammate Simão Sabrosa.

After helping the &quot;Colchoneros&quot; to the domestic cup final – he was cup-tied for the Europa League – a new loan deal was arranged with Juventus. Again, he played in significantly more minutes than García as Atlético finally qualified for the Europa League, and added four goals in La Liga, including a brace to help defeat Málaga CF 3–0 away, both goals coming from headers.
On 20 July 2011, Tiago signed a permanent two-year deal. He was again an important part of the team that reached the Europa League final, usually playing as a starter under coach Diego Simeone, who replaced Gregorio Manzano midway through the season; he missed the decisive match in Bucharest however, being sent off in the semi-final&#x27;s second leg against Valencia CF (1–0 away victory, 5–2 on aggregate) after slapping Roberto Soldado.

On 21 July 2014, aged 33, Tiago renewed his contract with Atlético for two seasons. On 13 September he put the visiting team ahead at Real Madrid after heading home a corner kick from Koke, in an eventual 2–1 win. In the reverse fixture on 7 February 2015, he opened the scoring in a 4–0 rout; eighteen days later, he received his marching orders in the 1–0 away loss to Bayer 04 Leverkusen in the first leg of the Champions League last-16.

On 28 November 2015, in the first half of the league fixture against RCD Espanyol, Tiago suffered an undisplaced fracture to his right tibia, going on to be sidelined for several months. He left the Vicente Calderón Stadium at the end of the 2016–17 campaign, with competitive totals of 229 games and 19 goals both spells comprised.

==International career==
Tiago&#x27;s performances in Portugal&#x27;s youth teams eventually earned him his senior debut against Scotland in a November 2002 friendly. He went on to seal a regular berth in the squad and was included in the 23-man list for UEFA Euro 2004, although he did not play in the finals; originally part of the squad for that year&#x27;s Summer Olympic Games, he withdrew through injury.

Moving to France proved crucial in international selection as Tiago&#x27;s strong form at Lyon afforded him a place in Portugal&#x27;s well-established midfield. His contributions aided the national team in their quest for qualification for the 2006 FIFA World Cup, and he appeared in five matches in the tournament held in Germany as Portugal reached the semi-finals, losing to France.

Tiago scored his first goal on 28 March 2007, in a &quot;Player of the match&quot; display away to Serbia (1–1). He was, however, overlooked, for Euro 2008&#x27;s final squad.

Tiago was selected for the squad at the 2010 World Cup in South Africa, replacing Deco in the first game, a 0–0 against the Ivory Coast. He took the naturalised Brazilian&#x27;s place for the following fixture, netting twice (including a header) in a 7–0 demolition of North Korea in Cape Town on 21 June.

After the World Cup, Tiago officially quit the national team citing personal reasons, and also to &quot;make room for opportunities for younger players,&quot; ending his international career with 58 caps and three goals. On 3 October 2014, however, after an absence of almost four years, he was called up by new manager Fernando Santos for a friendly with France and the Euro 2016 qualifier against Denmark. He was sent off for two bookings on 13 June 2015, in a 3–2 win in Armenia in another qualifying match; he was not selected for the finals, not having fully recovered from a broken leg.

==Coaching career==
Immediately after retiring, Tiago spent one year as assistant to former manager Simeone. He returned to the national team setup in June 2019, working with every age group from the under-15s to the under-20s.

Tiago had his first head coaching experience on 28 July 2020, signing a two-year contract with Vitória de Guimarães. He signed his former international teammate Ricardo Quaresma. On his managerial debut on 18 September, he lost by one goal at home to B-SAD.

Tiago resigned on 8 October 2020, having taken four points from three games.

==Style of play==
A versatile defensive or central midfielder, with good vision and overall skills, Tiago was known mainly for his work-rate, tenacity and tackling ability, as well as his accurate distribution of the ball after winning back possession. These attributes earned him the nickname &quot;the washing machine&quot; during his time with Lyon.

<doc id="774857" wikidata="Q1173401" url="?curid=774857" title="Dave Wottle">
<text>David James Wottle (born August 7, 1950) is an American retired middle-distance track athlete. He was the gold medalist in the 800 meter run at the 1972 Summer Olympics in Munich and a world record holder in the 800 meters. In 1973, Wottle also ran the then-3rd fastest mile in history. He was known for wearing a golf cap while running.

==Early life==
Dave Wottle was born in Canton, Ohio. During his childhood he was very slim and feeble. His family doctor told him that he needed to do something, such as running, to strengthen himself. The young boy took this advice and &quot;ran with it&quot;.

==Running career==
===High school running===
Wottle attended Canton Lincoln High School in Canton, Ohio, graduating in 1968. Wottle was the 1968 Ohio State champion in the mile, after finishing 4th in 1967.

===Collegiate running===
Competing for Bowling Green State University, Wottle finished second to Marty Liquori in the mile run at the 1970 NCAA Outdoor Track and Field Championships (3:59.9 to 4:00.1). That same year he represented his country in the 800 meters at the World University Games in Turin narrowly missing the final. During the 1971 season, Wottle was hampered by injuries, but a year later in 1972, he won the 1,500 meter race at the NCAA Outdoor Track and Field Championships.

===1972 Olympics===
Leading up to the 1972 Olympic Games in Munich, Germany, Wottle won the AAU 800-meter title in 1:47.3 before equaling the world record over 800 meters of 1:44.3 at the US Olympic Trials. To the annoyance of US team coach Bill Bowerman, he got married two weeks before the Games, and his new bride, Jan, traveled with him to Munich and stayed outside of the Olympic Village.

In the 800 meters final at the Olympics, Wottle immediately dropped to the rear of the field, and stayed there for the first 500 m, at which point he started to pass runner after runner up the final straightaway. He seized the lead in the final stretch to beat pre-race favorite Yevgeny Arzhanov of the Soviet Union by just 0.03 seconds. This gained him the nickname of &quot;The Head Waiter&quot;. (Another nickname was &quot;Wottle the Throttle&quot;). Wottle’s winning performance was a triumphant tour de force of even-paced running. His 200m splits were 26.4, 27.1, 26.2 and 26.2.

Stunned by his victory, Wottle forgot to remove his cap on the podium during the national anthem. Some interpreted this as a form of protest, but Wottle later apologized at the news conference following the medals ceremony.

Wottle also competed in the 1500 meter run at the Munich Olympics. He had finished second in the US Olympic Trials behind Jim Ryun (3:41.5 to 3:42.3). He was eliminated in the 1,500-metre semi-finals at the Olympics. Track &amp; Field News ranked him 1st in their 1972 world rankings for 800 metres.

His signature cap was originally used for practical purposes. He sported long hair at the peak of his career, so the hat kept his hair out of his face. After realizing the cap was part of his identity and for good luck, he wore it for the remainder of his career.

===Post-Olympics===
At the 1973 NCAA Outdoor Track and Field Championships Wottle won the mile run in a time of 3:57.1. He earned a Bachelor of Science in History from Bowling Green State University in 1973.

In June 1973, Wottle and 1972 U.S. Olympic teammate Steve Prefontaine (5000M) raced each other in the mile at a meet at the University of Oregon. Wottle defeated Prefontaine on his home track, running 3:53.3, which was the 3rd fastest mile in history at the time. Prefontaine ran 3:54.6, the 9th fastest mile at the time. Only world record holder Jim Ryun (3:51.1) and Kip Keino (3:53.1) had run the mile faster than Wottle. After the race, a fan attempted to run off with Wottle&#x27;s signature golf cap, but he chased the thief outside the stadium and retrieved his cap.

Wottle finished second to Rick Wohlhuter in the 1973 AAU 880 yards clocking 1:45.4 at 800 metres. His fastest 800 metre time of the year was 1:45.3 winning a race in Helsinki. He also ran 3:36.2 finishing second behind Filbert Bayi in a fast 1,500-meter race race in Helsinki in June. &quot;Track &amp; Field News&quot; ranked him 4th in their 1973 world rankings for 1,500 metres and 7th at 800 metres.

==Professional career in athletics==

Wottle turned professional in 1974, but retired from competitive running quite soon after that. Later, he became a college track coach at Walsh College (Ohio) (1975–77) and Bethany College (West Virginia) where he also served as Director of Admissions (1977–81).

==Career after athletics==
Wottle was the track coach and Admissions Director at Bethany (WV) College in the late &#x27;70s and early &#x27;80s, and he served as an administrator at Rhodes College from August 1983 until his retirement in June 2012. He was Dean of Admissions and Financial Aid for 28 years before spending his final year at the school as the Special Assistant to the President. He then served as the Interim Vice-President for Enrollment Management at Millsaps College. From September 2013 to April 2014, Wottle was the interim Vice President for Enrollment at Ohio Wesleyan University in Delaware, Ohio.

==Awards and honors==
*Bowling Green State University inducted Wottle into its Hall of Fame in 1978.
*Wottle was inducted into the USA Track and Field Hall of Fame in 1982.
*In 1990, the Mid American Conference inducted Wottle into their Hall of Fame.
*In 2016, Wottle was inducted by the Ohio High School State Athletic Association into their Circle of Champions.

<doc id="774861" wikidata="Q1476367" url="?curid=774861" title="Spyglass, Inc.">
<text>Spyglass, Inc. was an Internet software company. It was founded in 1990, in Champaign, Illinois, as an offshoot of the University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign, and later moved to Naperville, Illinois. Spyglass was created to commercialize and support technologies from the National Center for Supercomputing Applications (NCSA). It focused on data visualization tools, such as graphing packages and 3D rendering engines.

Spyglass became well known for its version of the Mosaic web browser. The company was acquired by OpenTV in 2000, now part of Kudelski Group, in a $2.5 billion stock swap.

==Mosaic==
In May 1994, Spyglass licensed NCSA&#x27;s Mosaic browser for several million dollars, with the intent to develop their own Web browser. However, NCSA&#x27;s development effort had resulted in different features, user interfaces, and codebases for each of its major platforms: UNIX, Microsoft Windows, and classic Mac OS. Spyglass therefore created its own Mosaic codebase in which most source code and all features were shared between platforms.

Spyglass offered a 30-day trial version for download, but did not actually sell the product to end-users. Instead, it licensed the code to re-sellers that delivered either an unmodified Spyglass Mosaic (e.g., O&#x27;Reilly and Associates) or a browser based on the Spyglass codebase (as CompuServe, IBM and Ipswitch) did. Among the browsers produced under license using Spyglass Mosaic&#x27;s codebase was Microsoft&#x27;s Internet Explorer.

In addition to the major desktop platforms, Spyglass ported Mosaic to other systems including Nintendo 64 for the SharkWire Online system.

===Browser wars===

Netscape Communications Corporation, co-founded by Marc Andreessen, released its flagship Netscape Navigator browser in October 1994, and the company soon became the web browser industry leader. Microsoft recognized the potential of the web, and after the company lost out to AOL for BookLink&#x27;s browser in November 1994, Microsoft reached a licensing deal with Spyglass in January 1995. Spyglass&#x27; Mosaic code became the basis for Internet Explorer, which was released as an add-on to Windows 95 in the Microsoft Plus! software package.

Microsoft and Spyglass reached an updated agreement in 1997, following a dispute over Microsoft only paying the minimum amount required for each quarterly royalty. Internet Explorer 6 and older acknowledged Spyglass and NCSA Mosaic in the &#x27;About&#x27; panel, but the message was removed starting with Internet Explorer 7 in 2006.

==Web server technology==
Spyglass created and marketed a commercially supported web server for Unix and Windows NT, variously called Spyglass Server and Server SDK. The product was announced in March 1995 and became available in July 1995. Like the Netscape server that was already on the market, the Spyglass Server included an application programming interface that allowed server-side applications to run in the server&#x27;s process. The two server platforms differed in their approach to security, with Spyglass using the Secure Hypertext Transfer Protocol (SHTTP), while Netscape used its own Secure Sockets Layer (SSL). Spyglass did not offer their server as a retail product, instead licensing it in volume to original equipment manufacturers, as it did with its browser. The largest licensee was Oracle Corporation.

== Acquisition ==
On March 26, 2000, OpenTV revealed plans to acquire Spyglass in a $2.5 billion stock swap. OpenTV said it planned to use Spyglass&#x27; Prism server software with its own interactive TV services, and OpenTV would continue the company&#x27;s expansion in the mobile browser market. The deal was finalized later that year.

OpenTV, in turn, was fully acquired by the Kudelski Group on March 29, 2010.

<doc id="774869" wikidata="Q3569243" url="?curid=774869" title="Wimmera Southern Mallee (region)">
<text>The Victorian government&#x27;s Wimmera Southern Mallee subregion is part of the Grampians region in western Victoria. It includes most of what is considered the Wimmera, and part of the southern Mallee region. The subregion is based on the social catchment of Horsham, its main settlement.

The Wimmera district covers the dryland farming area south of the range of Mallee scrub, east of the South Australia border and north of the Great Dividing Range.

Most of the Wimmera is very flat, with only the Grampians and Mount Arapiles rising above vast plains and the low plateaux that form the Great Divide in this part of Victoria. The Grampians are very rugged and tilted, with many sheer sandstone cliffs on their eastern sides, but gentle slopes on the west.

The Wimmera does not include the southern Mallee area in the north part of the Shire of Yarriambiack (around Hopetoun). It does include the southern part of the Shire of Buloke, which is not part of the Victorian government&#x27;s aforementioned subregion (around Wycheproof, Birchip, Donald and Charlton). This latter area, plus the St Arnaud area, makes up the East Wimmera region.

In the context of the Interim Biogeographic Regionalisation for Australia, the Wimmera is a sub-region of located within the Murray Darling Depression bioregion.

The Wimmera is one of the nine districts in Victoria used for weather forecasting by the Australian Bureau of Meteorology.

The Victorian Department of Environment and Primary Industries defines the Wimmera as a region for agricultural production purposes encompassing the Buloke, Hindmarsh, Horsham City, Northern Grampians, West Wimmera and Yarriambiack local government areas.

The Victorian Government&#x27;s Wimmera Catchment Management Authority serves the catchment of the Wimmera River, and that of the Yarriambiack Creek south of the Mallee.

The Shire of Wimmera originally covered a large part of the Wimmera and southern Mallee, but retracted over time to cover only land near Horsham. It was later abolished, with most of being becoming part of the Rural City of Horsham.

The federal government Division of Wimmera originally covered roughly the same area as the Division of Mallee does today, but ended its life covering only the Wimmera area.

At the , the six local government areas (LGAs) that are thought to comprise the Wimmera had a combined population of . The area of these same six LGAs is .

==History==
The area was inhabited by its Indigenous residents (and continues to be) when it was surveyed by the first European to do so Thomas Mitchell in the mid-1830s, and he is credited with naming the Grampians after a mountain range in his native Scotland, and naming the region as Wimmera, adapting a word from the local indigenous language meaning &#x27;throwing stick&#x27;.

==Regional development and population==
The area contains a number of important towns, such as Horsham, Warracknabeal, Dimboola, Stawell and Nhill. Almost all of these are largely dependent on the grain and sheep industries, and landscape is heavily dominated by flour mills and grain storage silos. The smaller towns in the area are dying due to the declining value of primary products that dominate the region&#x27;s economy. Similarly, modern farm technology allows individual farmers to stay viable by farming more land, but the decreasing population, and better transport, make smaller service centres less and less viable.


==Climate==
The climate is semi-arid to sub-humid, with annual rainfall ranging generally from in the north to in the south. In the Grampians, annual precipitation can be as high as and snowfalls are not uncommon. Most rain falls in winter, though heavy summer falls can occur, the most famous of which was the thunderstorm that dumped on in mid-January 1974.

Temperatures are hot in summer, ranging typically from a maximum of to a minimum of , whilst extremes can be as high as . In the winter, maximums are , but mornings can be cool, averaging at Horsham .

==Geography==
Most of the soils are very infertile and many are sandy; however in a narrow belt between Nhill and Warracknabeal there are heavy grey Vertisols, that, although still deficient in phosphorus, are otherwise free of major nutrient deficiencies and are able to hold water very well. These grey soils are the principal wheat soils of Victoria. Red-brown earths are also used for wheat but do not give as high yields and require more fertilisation.

The Wimmera River flows from the Pyrenees Ranges, across the northern foothills of the Grampians then towards Lake Hindmarsh. Many streams in the region flow only after sustained heavy rainfall and are often dry for long spells. In recent years Rocklands Reservoir, the main water storage of the district, has been consistently at unusually low levels due to a succession of dry years.

==Natural heritage==
The Wimmera is renowned for its natural heritage.

One of the key preservation areas is contained within the Grampians National Park, which possesses many unusual wildflowers and the greatest diversity of flora and fauna in Victoria west of the Snowy River. The Grampians also possess many important Aboriginal artifacts. A local Aboriginal name &quot;Gariwerd&quot; was adopted by the National Park in 1991 in recognition of this fact; however, this change was soon reversed after a change of state government in 1992.

The Little Desert National Park, south of Nhill and west of Dimboola, is a large wilderness area of sand dunes that were too infertile for productive farming even with superphosphate and trace elements.

<doc id="774882" wikidata="Q2334717" url="?curid=774882" title="Fulbourn">
<text>Fulbourn is a village in Cambridgeshire, England, with evidence of settlement dating back to Neolithic times. The village was probably established under its current name by 1200. The waterfowl-frequented stream after which it was named lies in the east, close to the division between arable and fenland.

== Geography ==
Fulbourn lies about five miles (8 km) southeast of the centre of Cambridge, separated from the outer city boundary by farmland and the grounds of Fulbourn Hospital. The village itself is fairly compact and roughly in the centre of the administrative parish. North and east of the village the land is flat, drained fen; to the south and southwest the Gog Magog Hills rise to over . Outside the residential area the land is open farmland, with relatively few trees. There is a wooded area, including a nature reserve (Fulbourn Fen) to the east in the Manor grounds. The village is set within the Cambridge Green Belt. The traditional parish boundaries follow the line of a Roman road and the Icknield Way to the southwest and southeast, Fleam Dyke – an ancient defensive earthwork – to the east, and the tributaries of Quy Water that drain to the River Cam.

Fleam Dyke bears the name of the Hundred of Cambridgeshire called Flendish that was known in the time of the Domesday Book by its Saxon name &quot;Flamingdike&quot;, pointing to the influence of Flemish immigration into the region. Flemish immigration has marked Fulbourn in various ways, with Fulbourn Windmill the most visible link to this influence. East Anglian English also shows such influence.

The parish extends some five miles (8 km) north to south and four miles (6.2 km) east to west.

== History ==
Archaeological evidence of habitation in the area has been found dating as far back as the Neolithic period, and there have been numerous finds from the Roman and Anglo-Saxon periods. The name has so far been traced back to 991 AD and is thought to derive from the Anglo-Saxon &quot;Fugleburn&quot; or &quot;Fugolburna&quot;, meaning &quot;stream frequented by waterfowl&quot;.
At one time, the village had two ecclesiastical parishes with both churches in the same churchyard, separated by seven feet; All Saints, believed to be the earlier, and St. Vigor&#x27;s. Some early maps depict &quot;Fulbourn Magna&quot; and &quot;Fulbourn Parva&quot; as separate villages, but a research project conducted by the Fulbourn Village History Society concluded that there was only ever one Fulbourn.

The site at Hall Orchard, a medieval moated site known as &quot;Dunmowes&quot;, survives as an earthwork and has a water-filled moat when suitable conditions exist. Excavations showed that the moated area had been occupied from at least the early 13th century until the late 17th century. The moat platform and ditch were probably constructed in the late 12th or early 13th century, with the soil and chalk dug out from the ditch being piled into the central area to create a raised platform. A large drainage ditch at the southwest corner and another at the northeast corner meet the moat ditch. These were probably inlet and outlet channels supplying the moat with continuous running water.

Some clues of the relative wealth and importance of Dunmowes Manor are available from the archaeological evidence. Decorative features associated with the building that were above and beyond practical and utilitarian purposes indicate that the owners intended to impress their neighbours and emphasise their own importance.

By the late medieval/early post-medieval period, most, if not all, of the buildings at Hall Orchard, rather than being thatched, may have been covered in relatively expensive stone roofing tiles. These were later replaced by clay peg tiles, with glazed and decorated finials and ridge tiles. Many fragments were very small, suggesting demolition of the house, with any complete tiles possibly being removed for re-use elsewhere.

=== The Five Manors of Fulbourn ===
In Norman times, Fulbourn was recognised as having five manors: Zouches Manor, Manners Manor, Colvilles Manor, Shardelowes Manor and Fulbourn Manor. Of these five, only the last remains today.

In 1496, Richard Berkeley and his wife Anne Berkeley settled a debt of 1,000 marks with property that included the manors of Fulbourn, which were then listed as Zouches, Manners, Shardelowes and Fulbourn.

=== Fulbourn Life Wall ===
A granite monument was erected in the village in October 2012, inscribed with dates and images from village life and history. The monument was created by two artists: Andrew Tanser, a master carver and sculptor, and Andrea Bassil, a well-known children&#x27;s author and illustrator.
=== Historical detail ===
A section of the ancient Street way, possibly that known locally by c.1300AD as Grauntestreet and later Grandstreet way, ran from the parish&#x27;s western edge to pass the northern end of the Fleam Dyke. Few prehistoric remains have been found, except for some Bronze Age weaponry. A probable Roman settlement has left traces in inclosures and droveways visible near the western boundary. A Roman cemetery containing up to 30 skeletons was discovered to the north of the village in 1874, along with an excavation variously identified as a limekiln and a tiled grave. Another Roman limekiln was found further east in 1875 near the station, close to which a Roman pavement was discovered in around 1940.

The parish was well populated from the Middle Ages. In 1086 there were probably c.90 peasant households and by 1279, when 56 messuages and 20 cottages were recorded, c.275 probably resident landholders. Some 80 inhabitants paid tax in 1327 and 426 adults paid the poll tax in 1377. There were still 119 people assessed to the subsidy in 1524, and 105 households in 1563. Following subsequent growth from the 1570s, numbers may have ranged between 400 and 450 in the late 16th and early 17th centuries, increasing again from the 1620s. In the 1660s and 1670s 105 to 110 dwellings were occupied, and 107 adults were reported in 1676. There were 106 families in 1728. The population was probably again stable in the early 18th century, perhaps dropping slightly by around 1740, but began to rise from the 1750s, perhaps by a half by the 1780s. There were 166 households in the 1790s and 702 people in 1801. Until the 1840s, numbers grew by c.150 to 200 in each decade, reaching 1,023 in 1831 and 1,452 in 1851. Pressure was reduced in the 1850s by emigration, especially to Australia. The population reached as much as 1,385 in the 1870s before again declining steadily, with a sharp fall in the 1890s when many young people left, to c.1,200 between 1911 and 1931. Of over 180 men who fought in the First World War 37 perished. New building, which added 250 households to the village in the 1950s and 520 in the 1960s, increased its population to 1,396 by 1961, 4,139 in 1981, and 4,732, including 4,282 in private households, in 1991.

By the 18th century, dwellings in the village mostly stood toward the eastern end of c.200 acres of surrounding crofts and closes. A main street, probably called by 1370 Church Street, linked two groups of tenements along Holm Street to the south, so named by no later than 1200 and later called Home End (Street), and along Eye Street, corrupted some time after 1400 to Hay Street, to the north-east, along whose western side crofts, some walled, abutted upon Eye field in the 1310s. In the late Middle Ages Holm and Eye streets were possibly reckoned as separate settlements, being still separately enumerated in manorial rentals c.1435. From the main street another, the modern Cow Lane, probably called in the 13th century Fen street and in the 14th Low or Nether street, led west towards the village&#x27;s main watering place, Poor&#x27;s Well. Possibly in use by 1335 and certainly so named by 1437, it was designated for that purpose at inclosure. Cow Lane then joined a back lane to the south named Pierce lane by no later than 1500.

Of c.40 houses surviving in Fulbourn in the 1980s from before 1800, mostly timber-framed, some under later brick casing, and half still thatched, most stood towards that eastern end of the village, where housing had largely been concentrated in 1800. A few others then stood along the south side of Pierce lane or at Frog End to the west. Those older houses include around ten dating from before 1600, among them some manorial farmhouses. The former Highfield Farm had a 14th-century hall with arched heads to its screen openings, and a two-bayed cross wing; it had another cross wing added after 1600. At Home End the originally 15th-century Old House had its hall reconstructed in the mid 17th century, soon after a parlour cross wing had been added, while at Ludlows, behind a Victorian front, was another early 15th-century hall with an original doorway and six-light window; its soller cross wing comprised a parlour below and two chambers above. Those houses mostly had crownpost roofs, into which red brick chimneys were inserted in the 16th century or later. At Flendyshe House, facing Ludlows where Home End widens into a small green, a rendered façade of c.1807 covered an early 17th-century range with a rebuilt service wing to the rear. Over 20 smaller houses of two to three bays and single-storeyed cottages with dormers dated from 1700 or earlier, some from the 1660s. During the 18th century a line of eight two- or three-bayed cottages, one dated 1735, were built on small crofts south-west of the village along the south side of Broad Green, so named by no later than 1460, where dwellings had been recorded by 1506.

In the 1660s and 1670s, barely 20 of the recorded dwellings had had more than one or two hearths. About 1808 the village contained at least 78 houses, including 15 farmhouses and 42 cottages. There was rapid growth after the 1820s, the number of inhabited dwellings rising from 164 in 1831 to 270–310 between the 1840s and 1900; in the late 19th century another 15–25 were sometimes empty. Meanwhile, new farmhouses had been built on the former open fields to the south and west, including Bishop&#x27;s Charity (c.1833–5), Rectory (1827), Valley (by 1829), and New Shardelowes (1820 × 1835) Farms. In the village other farmhouses went up on the standard Cambridgeshire pattern of a symmetrical three-bayed grey brick front, sometimes with fieldstone sidewalls, besides rows of labourers&#x27; cottages off the main streets, some in brick.

By the mid-19th century there were c.40 houses along the main street, usually still called Church Street, and its northern extension named Apthorpe Street by no later than 1506. Another 35–45 lay in a ribbon along the west side of Hay Street, where two more elaborate terraces of brick cottages were put up in 1885 and 1903. There were almost as many around Home End, with around ten by Broad Green. Another 45–50 reached along Pierce Lane to Frog End, but the parallel Cow Lane to its north was hardly built up. By 1800, a few dwellings were scattered along the roads to Teversham and Cherry Hinton. In 1910 c.80 houses were reported and 190 cottages.

The early 20th century saw little growth, with only 340–350 dwellings being recorded in the 1920s, but around 50 had been added by 1951, mostly before 1939, including a number of council houses. The first 12 had been built in 1925, some near School Lane, and 40 more went up in 1931 and 1939 within the angle of the Cambridge and Shelford roads. By 1950 ribbon building had filled the recently empty east side of Hay Street. From the 1950s, following the arrival of mains drainage, the village was subjected to intensive development, some 280 new houses being built by 1961 and another 500 by 1981. Planning restrictions confined them within the village&#x27;s previous boundary: some new building was effected by infilling along the older streets, which had c.280 dwellings by 1980 and were almost continuously built up by 1990. Other new housing, totalling 600 dwellings by 1980, lay on c.25 new roads, often densely packed closes, laid out within them. Private building, beginning at the east end, where c.160 houses went up in the 1950s, spread westwards along the south side of Pierce Lane, where c.120 were built in the early 1950s and, after a pause 1965–75, 30 more in 1977–79. Meanwhile, new council housing was concentrated on the south edge of the village, c.50 dwellings rising in the 1950s east of the previously almost unoccupied Haggis Gap, while another 170 were put up to its west c.1965–66. That last estate consisted of factory-built dwellings, sponsored by an enthusiastic council chairman, which were square, grey, and &#x27;barrack-like&#x27;. By 1974 the council had also built sheltered housing for 40 old people in Home Close at Frog End; from 1981 similar wardened housing, comprising 33 bungalows, was established further south in 1983. The 1980s saw less extensive new building, although infilling with smaller groups in the remaining gaps continued, as along Cow Lane. In 1981, the 1,188 homes in the parish included 353 council houses (this number had fallen by 74 by 1991) and 709 owner-occupied ones, with 126 being privately rented. Of c.450 dwellings added in the 1980s, almost all were privately owned.

Fulbourn at one time had as many as 10 or 11 public houses, one for every 120 inhabitants at the time. These included:
* The Plough and Crown, renamed, from 1776, The Six Bells (extant)
* The Harrow Inn, closed 1911
* The Coach and Horses, closed 1902
* The Railway Tavern
* The Royal Oak
* The Loyal Townley
* The Ancient Shepherds (1880s to 1920)
* The Rising Sun, closed 1956
* The Crown and Thistle closed in 1990s

== Community ==
The village had numerous alewives by the late 14th century, sometimes presented for not putting up their &#x27;alethorp&#x27; and for late-night opening. Three public houses were recorded from c.1770: the Plough and Crown, renamed from 1776 the Six Bells, occupies a four-bayed timber-framed house of 16th-century origin with a jettied first floor rising over a coach entrance, later blocked. The adjoining Coach and Horses, first kept by the squire&#x27;s coachman, and the Harrow, in a 17th-century house, which closed respectively in 1902 and 1911, stood nearby along the main street. After inclosure the White Hart, occupying a new grey brick house, was opened at Home End. In the early 19th century they were taken over, following bankruptcies, by Cambridge breweries. Several others were opened from the 1830s, nine in all by 1858, some in new built premises, including one near the station from 1859, when there were four public and six beer houses. Their clubrooms accommodated friendly societies such as a Lodge of Oddfellows set up in 1846, called the &#x27;Loyal Townley&#x27; after the squire, and from the 1880s to the 1920s a branch of the Ancient Shepherds. There were 10–11 licensed premises, one for every 120 inhabitants, c.1910, and still eight in 1937, but their numbers were gradually reduced. One of the last remaining pubs closed in 1990–91, leaving just the Baker&#x27;s Arms (now the &#x27;Hat and Rabbit&#x27;) on the corner of Teversham road, the Six Bells (remodelled after fire damage its thatched roof in 1963 and again in 1985) and the White Hart.

By the mid-18th century, Fulbourn&#x27;s village feast was held on three days after the first Sunday after Trinity. Described in 1881 as a &#x27;noisy ... annual nuisance&#x27;, it was formally reduced to two days in 1883. Despite objections to its obstructing the streets and to the gypsy showmen&#x27;s insanitary habits, it remained well attended into the mid-1910s. Held from 1920 after midsummer behind the Six Bells, it survived until 1936. It was supplemented by an annual flower and fruit show held from 1880 in the squire&#x27;s grounds by the village&#x27;s Horticultural Society. That also lapsed in 1937 for lack of organisers, but was revived in conjunction with Teversham from 1956. Other fêtes included the regular celebration of Empire Day by the schoolchildren between 1907 and c.1940, and others sponsored by the village Labour party from the 1920s.

From the 19th century, the village was well supplied with institutions providing social activities, and venues for them. A cricket club, active from the 1820s to the 1860s, was reorganised in 1880. There was also a football club from c.1900, and intermittently from c.1920 one for tennis. The parish council, after hiring a recreation ground from the rector from 1897 to 1908, accepted in 1921 a larger one from the Townleys, south-east of the village; this was subsequently purchased in 1966 and the original pavilion replaced the following year. A Conservative Club started in 1885 to attract the newly enfranchised labourers, which soon claimed 100 members, was active into the 20th century. For a Working Men&#x27;s Institute formed in 1873 a reading room was erected on School Lane in 1878. It still had 200 members in 1927, but, though reopened after 1945, declined in the 1950s through competition from ex-servicemen&#x27;s clubs, among them a British Legion branch started in 1920 which had 300 members in 1981. The Institute was closed c.1958 and its building sold in 1972. A Women&#x27;s Institute was started in 1921. The National schoolroom was used as an &#x27;Assembly Room&#x27; for entertainments from the 1880s until the squire, C. F. Townley, who liked amateur dramatics, built a well-equipped village hall in 1925. Seating 300, and with a stage, the hall was given to the parish by his son in Townley&#x27;s memory in 1931. It was still in regular use today.

Fulbourn had a resident physician from the 1850s; one, F. L. Nicholls, who served c.1888–1938, was a promoter of many local activities. In c.1957, the surgery was located at the end of Apthorpe Street opposite the present rectory. The district council provided a health centre at Haggis Gap from c.1973. Epidemics of typhoid in 1886 and 1887 had been ascribed to poor drainage and infected water from wells. In 1885 the Cambridge Waterworks Co. nevertheless chose an area just west of the Poor&#x27;s Well as the site for a pumping station to supply Cambridge, which was opened in 1891. The village had since 1887 received piped water through standpipes, which partly made up for the gradual drying up of its own wells and the draining of the Poor&#x27;s Well itself. To avoid the villagers&#x27; sewage contaminating the pumped water, a new pumping station was built from 1912 to the east by the Fleam Dyke. In operation from 1921, it supplied in 1954 two-thirds of the county&#x27;s water. The older station, regularly operated again thenceforth, was finally closed by 1989 when the site was sold for development; its listed grey brick main building was shortly converted for housing. The Fleam Dyke station was then still in use; its steam machinery had been partly preserved as museum pieces when it was electrified and its tall chimney demolished c.1976.

== Population ==
Most of the population live within a square half-mile in the main village. The main settlement around the parish church of St Vigor has extended in post-war years west towards Cambridge and north in a narrow ribbon of development towards the former station on the Ipswich to Ely Line (Cambridge branch). There has been substantial housing estate development, both local authority and private, particularly southwest and south of the centre. The civil parish contains additional housing located on the edge of Cherry Hinton, which itself falls within the Cambridge City boundary.

The population of the parish in the 2011 census was 4,673, compared with 4,704 in 2001. This has grown from a base of 1,440 in 1951 to 2,060 in 1961, 4,220 in 1971 and 1998 at 5,100. The 1979 boundary changes moved some (then) un-built-on land from Fulbourn and some partly developed land from Teversham both into the ecclesiastical parish of Cherry Hinton, as it was considered the people living there would look towards the churches in those parishes. Most of the subsequent growth in the administrative parish of Fulbourn has been in this area, which is not part of the ecclesiastical parish. In 1998 the population of the civil parish was made up of 1,000 people under 16, 3,100 aged 16–59, and 1,000 over 60. The economically active population was estimated at 2,600.

== Street names ==

=== Haggis Gap ===
The name of this street is a source of much local humour. According to Stephen Macaulay, Senior Project Officer, Archaeological Field Unit at Cambridgeshire County Council, &quot;It was a small trackway and there was a gap in the field boundary (hedge) through which the local owners, surname Haggis, could access their land, hence the name&quot;.

=== Dunmowe Way ===
This street is a reference to Dunmowes Manor, one of the five historic manors of the village.

== Local government ==
Fulbourn falls within the jurisdiction of Cambridgeshire County Council and South Cambridgeshire District Council plus Fulbourn Parish Council

== Employment and commerce ==
Since World War II most residents in employment have worked outside the village, in Cambridge or elsewhere. Many find work at the nearby Addenbrookes Hospital. Within the village itself there is employment in small industrial areas close to the former railway station and elsewhere to the north of the village. There are also professional offices in the former rectory and pumping station and a developing business park in redundant hospital buildings and in new buildings close by. Others are employed in service industries such as retail, and in education. Agriculture, though still important in terms of land use, only employs a small number of people.

The village&#x27;s business park is joined by the Capital Park on the site of the old hospital, which has many tens of thousands of square feet of office space. These parks enhance the area&#x27;s business environment beyond what was started by the creation of the Science parks which date from the 1980s and 1990s.
== Healthcare ==
Fulbourn Hospital was built as an asylum in the mid-19th century between the village and Cherry Hinton. Until recently the main Victorian building was used as a psychiatric hospital, while the 1960s Kent House to the west was built for acute mental health patients and the Ida Darwin Hospital to the east was developed for the mentally handicapped. The main buildings have now been transformed into a Business Park although some acute facilities remain. From 540 patients at the hospitals in 1981 the number has been considerably reduced, with many ex-patients being moved into the community. The former East of England Strategic Health Authority&#x27;s offices (NHS East of England) were on the Business Park, as are that of Health Data Insight.

For everyday healthcare there is a health centre in the village with a single practice, though this is based at premises on the edge of Cambridge; there is also a chiropodist in the village.

== Sport and recreation ==
The village has a well-appointed recreation ground. Adjacent to this is the Townley Memorial village hall, which includes meeting rooms and a small indoor sports hall, and provides a venue for sports and social clubs.

There are a community centre and a village hall on separate sites, the hall being adjacent to the extensive recreation ground. The village also has a retirement home, Home Close: the Rector currently sits on the Residents&#x27; Committee, visits the home regularly and conducts services there.

Fulbourn has two Non-League football clubs: Fulbourn Institute F.C. who play at the Recreation Ground, and Fulbourn Sports, who play at Capital Park, Cambridge Road. There are also two colts clubs, Fulbourn Institute and Fulbourn Falcons.

There is a thriving amateur dramatics society in the village, St John&#x27;s Players. The Players celebrated their 70th anniversary in 2017, and perform three plays a year, in February, May and October to coincide with half-term weeks. They also put on occasional one-off performances during the year, such as their Christmas panto. Performances and rehearsals are staged in the Townley Memorial Hall.

== Education ==
There are three schools in Fulbourn. Fulbourn Primary School, close to the village centre, is a state primary school that has about 270 pupils. Landmark International School and Cambridge Steiner Waldorf School are private institutions. For secondary education the village is in the catchment area of Village College in Bottisham to the north.

Pre-school education is provided at Fulbourn Pre-school (co-located with the Primary School), Cambridge Steiner Waldorf School, and Domino Nursery School (in the United Reformed Church hall).

Anglia Ruskin University has a campus situated within the Capital Park, which includes clinical skill facilities, a library, a computer room, a student common room and a canteen.

Fulbourn library is a volunteer-run facility supported by Cambridgeshire County Council Library Service and was re-opened by volunteers in November 2003, having been closed by the County Council the previous month. It moved from the Old School to its current location in the new development, The Swifts, in 2009.

== Future developments ==
Proposals for significant additional housing to the north of the village after 2016 included in the current Structure Plan review have been vigorously fought by the Parish and District Councils. The panel that conducted an examination into the review has recommended that these proposals be dropped. It is expected, however, that whatever the outcome, some additional housing will be built within or on the edge of the village in the next ten years or so. Apart from the village&#x27;s business park, there are no current proposals for major additional employment opportunities in Fulbourn.

== Arts and artists ==
Fulbourn is home to several artists: painters, sculptors, jewellers, potters, textile artists participate in Open Studios in July.

Alice Goodman, the Anglican Rector of Fulbourn, is a published poet, and was the librettist of the operas &quot;Nixon in China&quot; and &quot;The Death of Klinghoffer&quot;.

== Transport ==
=== Roads ===
By the late 13th century Fulbourn was linked to the Icknield Way by fieldways leading south-east, including Weston, Balsham, and (Old) Wood ways, while Mill Way and Granditch Way, continued respectively by Limekiln Way and Hintonwal Way (also Hintonwald Way), led west towards Cherry Hinton and Cambridge. At the time of inclosure, those running south-east were mostly stopped up and replaced by a single straight road, while the western ones had their courses straightened.

=== Railway ===
Under the Newmarket and Chesterford Railway Act 1846 (9 &amp; 10 Vict. c. clxxii), the Newmarket Railway Company built a section of its line from Great Chesterford to Newmarket across the south-east of the parish. The line opened in 1848 but closed in 1851 and was formally abandoned in 1858, after the company completed the direct line from Cambridge which crosses Fulbourn north of the village to join the earlier line at Six Mile Bottom.

A station was erected on the Balsham Road, but the building was demolished after 1930; various cuttings and a bridge were still visible in the 1980s. A new station for Fulbourn was opened by 1852 on Hay Street, renamed Station Road in the 20th century. That station was closed in 1967 and its buildings demolished after 1973, although the line remains open today.

The village grew rapidly after the Second World War until the station was closed as a result of the Beeching Report. The station platform is still in place, albeit decayed, and a local campaign to reopen the station started in 2015. An experimental social media campaign to support the reopening was picked up by the local press.

<doc id="774900" wikidata="Q7138939" url="?curid=774900" title="Assembly of Serbia and Montenegro">
<text>The Assembly of Serbia and Montenegro () also known as the Parliament of Serbia and Montenegro () was the legislative body of Serbia and Montenegro. The assembly was unicameral and was made up of 126 deputies, of which 91 were from Serbia and 35 were from Montenegro. The assembly was established in 1992 as the National Assembly of Yugoslavia as a direct replacement for National Assembly of Yugoslavia and was renamed in 2003. With the declaration of independence of Montenegro on June 3, 2006, the national assembly was dissolved.

From the beginning, the Federal Assembly was a bicameral legislature and had 178 deputies, 138 in the House of Citizens (108 from Serbia, 30 from Montenegro) and 40 in the House of Republics (20 representatives for each republic). The minimum number of representatives in the House of Citizens, which were based on the population, was 30 representatives, while the House of Republics had an even representation of 20 representatives times the number of republics. A constitutional amendment in July 2000, as a compromise between the resignation of the Milošević cabinet and the opposition made the assembly&#x27;s members elected, with the early elections set for September 24, 2000.

==Composition==

The parliament elected a President and Vice-President of the parliament from among its deputies, who could not be from the same member state. The assembly could be dissolved if the candidate for the President of Serbia and Montenegro or the list of candidates for ministers of the council of ministers did not win the required number of votes after two and three proposals respectively. In that case the President could call for direct elections. 

The President and the Vice-President of the parliament proposed a candidate for the President of Serbia and Montenegro, which the parliament at large then elected, along with the Council of Ministers. 
The Council of Ministers, a deputy and the assembly of a member state could submit a bill for adoption to the parliament. Bills were adopted by the vote of a majority of deputies, but must also have had a majority of votes among deputies of each of the two member states. Every deputy enjoyed the freedom of expression at the Assembly and has immunity for the words uttered and for other acts he performed in his capacity as deputy. A deputy could not be detained or punished without the approval of the Assembly of Serbia and Montenegro, except for a criminal offense punishable by over five years in prison.

==Building==
The Parliament building is in the city centre of Belgrade, on the Nikola Pašić Square, in front of Pioneer&#x27;s park. Prior to its use for the Parliament of Serbia and Montenegro, it served as the seat of parliament for Yugoslavia. The building is shown on the five-Yugoslav dinar coin.

Construction on the building started in 1907, with the cornerstone being laid by King Peter I. The building was based on a design made by Konstantin Jovanović in 1891; a variant of that design made by Jovan Ilkić, which won a competition in 1901. World War I delayed construction, and the original plans to the building were lost. Reconstruction of the plans were made by Jovan&#x27;s son Pavle Ilkić. The interior was designed by Nikolaj Krasnov. It was designed in the manner of academic traditionalism.

==Constitutional charter==
Authority of the parliament was granted by the Constitutional Charter of Serbia and Montenegro, and its jurisdiction was limited. Its major responsibilities included legislation regarding other institutions established within the Constitution, and foreign relations, including declarations of war, military and defense issues, border disputes, international treaties, and membership in international groups. It also could pass laws dealing with immigration issues, budget issues affecting the whole of Serbia and Montenegro, the aforementioned election of the President and Council of Ministers, issues involving trade and commerce within Serbia and Montenegro, the flag, anthem, and coat of arms of Serbia and Montenegro, as well as issues of standardization, systems of measurement, and intellectual property,

<text>Great Wilbraham is a small village situated in a rural area some seven miles (11 km) to the east of Cambridge, between the edge of an area of low-lying drained fens to the west and north, and higher ground beyond the A11 to the east.

The administrative authorities are Cambridgeshire County Council, South Cambridgeshire District Council, and Great Wilbraham Parish Council.

==History==
The parish of Great Wilbraham has been occupied for thousands of years; a Neolithic camp was excavated in the west of the parish in 1976, and a Bronze Age barrow, where up to eight burials were discovered in 1852, lies alongside the Fleam Dyke in the southern corner of the parish. A possible Roman dwelling was also located in woodlands.

The medieval history of Great Wilbraham is tied up with that of neighbouring Little Wilbraham, and they were first distinguished in the 13th century when it was also known as King&#x27;s Wilbraham. Listed as &quot;Wilburgeham&quot; in the 10th century, and &quot;Wiborgham&quot; in the Domesday Book, the name &quot;Wilbraham&quot; means &quot;Homestead of a woman called Wilburh&quot;.

==Church==
A church was built in Wilbraham in around 970 by a monk from Ramsey Abbey. The present church, dedicated to Saint Nicholas, dates from the 12th century, and the font and the nave&#x27;s north wall survive from that period. Extended over the following 200 years, the west tower dates from around 1400. A short spire was added but had gone by the late 18th century.

The village has been home to nonconformity since the 17th century, and there has been a strong Baptist presence since then. A Baptist chapel survives at the north end of Angle End.

==Village life==
Great Wilbraham is mostly residential in nature. Employment within the village is mostly agricultural but there are also a number of small businesses. Many of the working residents commute into Cambridge or other nearby towns such as Newmarket.

The village has a variety of house types, mostly Victorian or older, with post-war infill development, and a small number of modest-scale modern estates. No significant expansion is anticipated in the near future. A number of attractive period houses surround the large village green, which adjoins the churchyard. There is a Post Office/general store and a village hall/social club.

Great Wilbraham retains one public house, the Carpenter&#x27;s Arms, which has been open since at least 1767. Former pubs were The (Sedan) Chair, recorded from 1765, and the 19th century King&#x27;s Head and White Swan, both of which closed in the late 1960s.

The Voluntarily Aided Church Primary School enjoys an excellent reputation with approximately 100 pupils between the ages of 5 and 11. Within the village there are two pre-school groups, one attached to the school. Children of secondary age mostly attend the Village College in the nearby village of Bottisham.

There is a strong sporting tradition within the village, with cricket and football teams making use of the green. Darts and indoor bowls are also played in the Social Club. Money is raised by an annual Sports Day which includes many stalls and events such as coconut shies, pony rides, running races and even cake competitions.

<doc id="774906" wikidata="Q1943297" url="?curid=774906" title="The Best of New Order">
<text>The Best of New Order (stylised as (the best of) NewOrder) is a greatest hits album by English band New Order. It was released in the United Kingdom on 21 November 1994 by London Records and, with a different track listing, in the United States on 14 March 1995 by Qwest Records and Warner Bros. Records. Like &quot;Republic&quot;, the band&#x27;s most recent studio album at the time, the cover and liner notes stylise the group&#x27;s name as one word (NewOrder) instead of the usual &quot;New Order&quot;.

==Background==
&quot;The Best of New Order&quot; is the second compilation album released by the group and follows their first, the hugely successful &quot;Substance&quot; album by seven years. The group had taken a hiatus due to tensions and disputes during the recording and touring of their 1993 album, &quot;Republic&quot;. &quot;Republic&quot; had been the first album that the group had released on London Records, and with the group announcing little intention of working together in the near future, the label went ahead compiling &quot;The Best of New Order&quot;.

The compilation primarily consists of seven-inch mixes of the group&#x27;s singles from 1985 onwards. New versions of &quot;True Faith&quot;, &quot;Bizarre Love Triangle&quot;, &quot;1963&quot; and &quot;Round &amp; Round&quot; appear in alternative mixes. The collection also includes one non-single track, &quot;Vanishing Point&quot; (from the LP &quot;Technique&quot;), though the song was already popularised as the theme tune to the BBC series &quot;Making Out&quot;. Only &quot;Thieves Like Us&quot; (the oldest track included, from 1984) appears in the same form as on the earlier compilation, &quot;Substance&quot;. The liner notes (first on a New Order album) were provided by journalist Paul Morley.

The US version of the album omits three tracks (&quot;The Perfect Kiss&quot;, &quot;Shellshock&quot; and &quot;Thieves Like Us&quot;). This was purportedly due to the band&#x27;s American label, Qwest, not wishing for some of the singles already included on &quot;Substance&quot; to be duplicated on this compilation. Instead, one album track from each of New Order&#x27;s first three albums is included (&quot;Dreams Never End&quot; from &quot;Movement&quot;, &quot;Age of Consent&quot; from &quot;Power, Corruption &amp; Lies&quot;, and &quot;Love Vigilantes&quot; from &quot;Low-Life&quot;), as well as a previously unreleased vocal version of the track &quot;Let&#x27;s Go (Nothing for Me)&quot; from the 1987 film soundtrack &quot;Salvation!&quot;.

The following year, a companion remix album titled &quot;The Rest of New Order&quot; was released, with similar cover art.

==Release and reception==
&quot;The Best of New Order&quot; was released on CD, cassette, double LP, VHS and Laserdisc. Limited editions bundled together the cassette and CD in a box set. Video and Laserdisc versions included singles that do not appear on other versions, namely &quot;Confusion&quot;, &quot;State of the Nation&quot; and &quot;Spooky&quot;.

Critical reception was generally positive. Although AllMusic&#x27;s William Ruhlmann felt it was not as good a compilation as &quot;Substance&quot; (1987), he viewed the album as an exceptional overview of New Order&#x27;s 1980s and early 1990s music. In his review for &quot;The Village Voice&quot; of the US edition, Robert Christgau said that the album shows why he prefers Bernard Sumner&#x27;s impassive quality over the despairing Ian Curtis:

The album sold well in the Christmas market and peaked at number four on the UK Albums Chart, and was certified Platinum by the British Phonographic Industry (BPI). Internationally, the compilation reached number 23 in Canada, number 27 in New Zealand, number 30 in Australia, and number 78 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. As of May 2006, it had sold 428,000 copies in the United States.

&quot;True Faith-94&quot; and &quot;1963&quot; were released as singles to promote the compilation. &quot;True Faith-94&quot; was released in November 1994, and reached number nine in the UK and number 11 in Ireland. &quot;1963&quot; (dubbed &quot;1963–95&quot;) was remixed by Arthur Baker in a guitar-driven arrangement and released the following January; it reached number 21 in the UK and number 29 in Ireland.
