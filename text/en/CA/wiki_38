<text>Henry John Kaiser (May 9, 1882 – August 24, 1967) was an American industrialist who became known for his shipbuilding and construction projects, then later for his involvement in fostering modern American health care. Prior to World War II, Kaiser was involved in the construction industry; his company was one of those that built the Hoover Dam. He established the Kaiser Shipyards, which built Liberty ships during World War II, after which he formed Kaiser Aluminum and Kaiser Steel. Kaiser organized Kaiser Permanente health care for his workers and their families. He led Kaiser-Frazer followed by Kaiser Motors, automobile companies known for the safety of their designs. Kaiser was involved in large construction projects such as civic centers and dams, and invested in real estate, later moving into television broadcasting with Kaiser Broadcasting. 

==Early life==
Kaiser was born on May 9, 1882, in Sprout Brook, New York, the son of Franz and Anna Marie (née Yops) Kaiser, ethnic German immigrants. His father was a shoemaker. Kaiser&#x27;s first job was as a in a Utica, New York, department store at the age of 16. He worked as an apprentice photographer early in life, and was running the studio in Lake Placid by the age of 20. He used his savings to move to Washington state in 1906, where he started a construction company fulfilling government contracts.

Kaiser met his future wife, Bess Fosburgh, the daughter of a Virginia lumberman, when she came into his photographic shop in Lake Placid, New York, to buy film. Fosburgh&#x27;s father demanded that Kaiser show that he was financially stable before he would consent to their marriage. Kaiser moved to Spokane and became a top salesman at a hardware company, returning ten months later with enough money to placate his future father-in-law. They married on April 8, 1907, and had two children, Edgar Kaiser, Sr and Henry Kaiser, Jr.

In 1914 Kaiser founded a paving company, Henry J. Kaiser Co., Ltd., one of the first to use heavy construction machinery. His firm expanded significantly in 1927 when it received an $18-million contract to build roads in Camagüey Province, Cuba. In 1931 his firm was one of the prime contractors in building the Hoover Dam on the Colorado River, and subsequently the Bonneville and Grand Coulee Dams on the Columbia River.

While doing business among the &quot;Six Companies, Inc.&quot;, and remotely related to his interest in motor boat racing, he set up shipyards in Seattle and Tacoma, where he began using mass-production techniques, such as using welding instead of rivets.

==World War II==

Henry Kaiser was an early advocate of bringing American aid to those suffering from German aggression in Europe. In 1940, a full year before the US had entered World War II, Kaiser served as National Chairman of United Clothing Collection for International War Relief to provide much-needed clothing for the refugees from Hitler&#x27;s conquests in Europe.

===Kaiser Shipbuilding===
Kaiser fought Hitler far more directly with what he is most famous for: the Kaiser Shipyard in Richmond, California; during World War II adapting production techniques to enable building cargo ships with an average construction time of 45 days. These ships became known as Liberty ships and were later supplemented in the mid-war period by improved, larger and faster Victory ships. He became world-renowned when his teams built a ship in four days. The keel for the 10,500-ton was laid on Sunday, November 8, 1942, and the ship was launched in California from the Richmond Shipyard#2 on Thursday, November 12, four days and hours later. The previous record had been ten days for the Liberty ship &quot;Joseph M. Teal&quot;.

A visit to a Ford assembly plant by one of his associates led to a decision to use welding instead of riveting for shipbuilding. Welding was advantageous because it took less strength to do and it was easier to teach to thousands of employees, who were mostly unskilled laborers and many women. Kaiser adopted the use of sub-assemblies in ship construction. Formerly, hundreds of laborers crowded together to complete a ship. Though that practice had been tried on the East Coast and in Britain, Kaiser was able to take full advantage of the process by constructing new shipyards using this concept.
Other Kaiser shipyards were located in Ryan Point (Vancouver) on the Columbia River in Washington state and on Swan Island in Portland, Oregon. A smaller vessel was turned out in 71 hours and 40 minutes from the Vancouver yard on November 16, 1942. The Kaiser hulls also became America&#x27;s smaller, more numerous &quot;escort carriers&quot;, over 100 small aircraft carriers employed in both the Pacific and the Atlantic theaters. The concepts that he developed for the mass production of commercial and naval ships are still in use.

One problem with welded hulls that was unknown is the issue of brittle fracture. That caused the loss of some Liberty ships in cold seas as the welds failed and the hulls would crack, sometimes completely into two. Constance Tipper was one of the first people to discover why the Liberty ships were breaking into two. Minor changes in design and more rigid welding control implemented in 1947 eliminated Liberty ship losses until 1955. By his membership in a group called the Six Companies, Kaiser also had a major role in the Joshua Hendy Iron Works of Sunnyvale, California, which built the EC-2 triple expansion steam engines for the Liberty ships. Kaiser and his associates organized the California Shipbuilding Corporation.

===Kaiser Permanente===
At Kaiser Shipyards in Richmond, California, Kaiser implemented the pioneering idea of Sidney Garfield for a prepaid hospital financing plan. Opened on August 10, 1942, Kaiser Richmond Field Hospital for Kaiser Shipyards was financed by the U.S. Maritime Commission, sponsored by Henry J. Kaiser&#x27;s Permanente Foundation, and run by Garfield. In part because of wartime materials rationing, the Field Hospital was a single-story wood-frame structure designed in a simple modernist mode. Originally intended for use primarily as an emergency facility, the Field Hospital opened with only 10 beds. Later additions had increased its capacity to 160 beds by 1944.

Kaiser&#x27;s Richmond Field Hospital served as the mid-level component of a three-tier medical care system that included six well-equipped First Aid Stations at the shipyards and the main Permanente Hospital in Oakland, where the most critical cases were treated. By August 1944, 92.2% of all Richmond shipyard employees had joined Kaiser Permanente, the first voluntary group plan in the country to feature group medical practice, prepayment, and substantial medical facilities on such a large scale. After the war, the Health Plan was expanded to include workers&#x27; families. To serve employees at his diverse businesses, Kaiser opened Permanente facilities in Walnut Creek, California; Honolulu, Hawaii; and many other locations. Since then, locations have opened in Hawaii; Dublin, California; Livermore, California; Pleasanton, California; Martinez, California; Santa Clara, California; and Antioch, California.

===Kaiser Automobiles===
====Kaiser-Frazer====
In 1945, Kaiser partnered with veteran automobile executive Joseph Frazer to establish a new automobile company from the remnants of Graham-Paige, of which Frazer had been president. Frazer was a respected auto sales executive and was noted for Chrysler&#x27;s market penetration during the 1930s. The new company was named Kaiser-Frazer. It used a surplus Ford Motor Company defense plant at Willow Run, Michigan originally built for WWII aircraft production by Ford. Kaiser-Frazer (later Kaiser Motors) produced cars under the Kaiser and Frazer names until 1955, when it abandoned the U.S. market and moved production to Argentina. The first K-F models were designed by Howard &quot;Dutch&quot; Darrin and these went from non-existent to number eight in new car sales within two years. Although still producing Jeep vehicles, Kaiser-Willys ceased production of passenger cars in the U.S. after the 1955 model year. They continued producing Kaiser Carabela sedans, identical to the 1955 Kaiser U.S. sedans, in Argentina until 1961.

====Kaiser Superbus====
He built the Kaiser Superbus (1946, scrapped 1951) 60 feet in length with room for 63 seated passengers, and two restrooms, was constructed using magnesium, and aluminum. Only one prototype would be built. A small model used by Kaiser&#x27;s sales team was reconstructed in 2016. It was a highway bus meant to go from train station to train station within the Santa Fe Railway. It was built for Santa Fe Trailways (later Continental Trailways, part of National Trailways Bus System) to run on longer routes, not entirely inside urban areas. Construction took place at the Kaiser Permanente Metals Corporation plant in Los Altos. The first, and only route, was between Los Angeles and San Francisco. Santa Fe Railway had to petition The California State Railroad Commission to operate the bus on state highways as it used a trailer, which were forbidden to use.

====Henry J.====

The Henry J was built by the Kaiser-Frazer Corporation and named after its chairman, Henry J. Kaiser. Production of six-cylinder models began in July 1950, and four-cylinder production started shortly after Labor Day, 1950. Official public introduction was September 28, 1950. The car was marketed through 1954.

Kaiser-Frazer held a contest to name their new car, with Henry J being the winning name. A lawsuit by a shareholder in the company alleged that &quot;The name is so ridiculous that it can be justified on no other ground than to satisfy a deep ingrained megalomanic desire for personal publicity&quot;. It is unknown the outcome of the suit and in the end, the car was named after Kaiser.

====Jeep and South America====
In 1953, Kaiser purchased Willys-Overland, manufacturer of the Jeep line of utility vehicles, changing its name to Willys Motors. In the late 1960s, Kaiser&#x27;s South American operations were sold to a Ford-Renault combination. In 1963, the name was changed again to Kaiser-Jeep, which was ultimately sold to American Motors Corporation in 1970. As part of the transaction, Kaiser acquired a 22% interest in AMC, which was later divested.

====Private projects====
In the mid-1950s, Kaiser asked William Besler to convert his 1953 Kaiser Manhattan to steam. Besler completed this in either 1957 or 1958. Kaiser did not like the remodeled car and left it with Besler.

===Kaiser Aluminum===

Kaiser founded Kaiser Aluminum in 1946 by leasing and later purchasing aluminum facilities in Washington state from the U.S. government. The original facilities included reduction plants at Mead and Tacoma, and a rolling mill at Trentwood. Kaiser Aluminum expanded to become an integrated aluminum company, mining and refining bauxite and creation of alumina, the production of primary aluminum from alumina, and manufacturing fabricated and semi-fabricated aluminum products.

===Kaiser Family Foundation===

In 1948, Kaiser established the Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation (also known as Kaiser Family Foundation), a U.S.-based, nonprofit, private operating foundation focusing on health care issues. Originally based in Oakland, California, it later moved to Menlo Park, California. At Kaiser&#x27;s death, half of his fortune was left to the foundation. It was reorganized and restructured in 1991, under CEO Drew Altman. The Foundation, not associated with Kaiser Permanente or Kaiser Industries, operates independently as a think tank, making facts and analysis available to policymakers, health care groups, the media and the general public.
===Real estate===

As a real-estate magnate, Kaiser founded the Honolulu suburban community of Hawaii Kai in Hawaii. Kaiser also financed the development of Panorama City, a planned community in the San Fernando Valley portion of Los Angeles. Schools were named in his honor in Hawaii, West Virginia, and California.

====Hawaii Village Hotel====

Kaiser spent many of his later years in Honolulu and developed an obsession with perfecting its urban landscape. He built the Kaiser Hawaiian Village Hotel, today known as the Hilton Hawaiian Village, and used bright pink Jeeps as resort transportation. Kaiser constructed one of the first commercially practical geodesic domes in the United States at this resort and used it as a theater.

===Television===

In the mid-1950s, Kaiser was convinced that television could make Kaiser brand products known to the public. In 1957 Kaiser partnered with Warner Brothers and ABC to sponsor the television series &quot;Maverick&quot;, promoting household products including Kaiser aluminum foil and Kaiser Jeep vehicles. In support of his Hawaii ventures, Kaiser induced Warner Brothers to copy the formula of its popular series &quot;77 Sunset Strip&quot; as new TV series &quot;Hawaiian Eye&quot;. Though actually filmed at WB studios in Burbank, California, the show featured private detectives based at Kaiser&#x27;s Hilton Hawaiian Village. (The Hilton Hawaiian Village was featured in &quot;Hawaii 5-0&quot; with many scenes filmed at the resort.) Kaiser eventually bought and built a chain of radio and television stations which became known as Kaiser Broadcasting. Some call signs included his initials &quot;HK&quot;, beginning in 1957 in Honolulu with KHVH-TV 13 and KHVH AM 1040.

==Personal life==

Kaiser&#x27;s first wife Bess Fosburgh died on March 14, 1951. Kaiser married the nurse who had cared for her, Alyce Chester (reportedly with his wife&#x27;s blessing) on April 10, 1951. He adopted her son, who as Michael Kaiser, attended nearby Lafayette public Vallecito School. Kaiser&#x27;s attention soon transferred to Hawaii, and in 1955 he moved his family there. After Kaiser moved to Hawaii, the west Lafayette Kaiser estate deteriorated and was eventually demolished. Today, the property is unrecognizable, subdivided into several homes.

===Death===
On August 24, 1967, Kaiser died at the age of 85 in Honolulu. He is interred in Mountain View Cemetery in the Main Mausoleum, in Oakland, California.

He was outlived by his second wife, Alyce Chester Kaiser, who inherited half his fortune, and by his elder son, Edgar F. Kaiser, who had been president of the Kaiser Industries Corporation since 1956.

One of Kaiser&#x27;s grandsons, Edgar Kaiser Jr., became president of Kaiser Steel from 1981 to 1984, and briefly owned the Denver Broncos NFL franchise.

Another grandson, Henry, is an Antarctic diver and experimental guitarist.

==Legacy==
Kaiser Industries was dissolved in the late 1970s. Koppers acquired Kaiser Sand &amp; Gravel. Raymond International of Houston acquired Kaiser Engineers, and Kaiser Broadcasting was sold to Field Communications. Kaiser Aerospace &amp; Electronics was sold to its managers. Kaiser Aluminum, Kaiser Cement, and Kaiser Steel remained as independent companies. Hanson Cement acquired Kaiser Cement for $200 million in 1986.

Kaiser was involved in building civic centers, roads, and schools. He was part of the consortium that constructed the Hoover Dam and Grand Coulee Dam. Kaiser is also noted for advancing medicine with the development and construction of hospitals, medical centers and medical schools. The mining town of Eagle Mountain, California, built as part of the West Coast&#x27;s first integrated mining/processing operation, and linked by rail to his mill in Fontana, California, was an early user of Kaiser Permanente, the first health maintenance organization.

A class of 18 United States Navy fleet replenishment oilers built in the 1980s and 1990s is named the . Its lead unit, , the first U.S. Navy ship named for Kaiser, entered service with the Military Sealift Command on December 19, 1986.

In 1990, Kaiser was made a member of the Labor Hall of Fame of the U.S. Department of Labor in Washington, D.C., supported by the Friends of the Department of Labor.

On December 1, 2009, Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger and First Lady Maria Shriver inducted Kaiser posthumously into the California Hall of Fame in the California Museum, Sacramento, California.

<text>Billie Sol Estes (January 10, 1925 – May 14, 2013) was an American businessman and financier best known for his involvement in a business fraud scandal that complicated his ties to friend and future U.S. President Lyndon Johnson.

==Early life==
Estes was born January 10, 1925, to John and Lillian Estes on a farm near Clyde, Texas, one of six children. Estes never attended college but nonetheless demonstrated a natural talent for business from an early age.

He served in the U.S. Merchant Marine during World War II.

==Fraud schemes==

In the late 1950s, Estes was heavily involved in the Texas anhydrous ammonia business. He produced mortgages on nonexistent ammonia tanks by convincing local farmers to purchase them on credit, sight unseen, and leasing them from the farmers for the same amount as the mortgage payment, paying them a convenience fee as well. He used the fraudulent mortgage holdings to obtain loans from banks outside Texas who were unable to easily check on the tanks.

At the same time, United States Department of Agriculture began controlling the price of cotton, specifying quotas to farmers. The program included an acreage allotment that normally was not transferable from the land it was associated with, but which could be transferred if the original land was taken by eminent domain.

Estes worked out a method to purchase large numbers of cotton allotments by dealing with farmers who had been dispossessed of land through eminent domain. He convinced the farmers to purchase land from him in Texas and transfer their allotments there, with a mortgage agreement delaying the first payment for a year. Then he would lease the land and allotments back from the farmer for $50 per acre. Once the first payment came due, the farmer would intentionally default and the land would revert to Estes; in effect, Estes had purchased the cotton allotments with the lease fees. However, because the original sale and mortgage were a pretext rather than a genuine sale, it was illegal to transfer the cotton allotments this way. Estes, however, a smooth talker revered by many of his fellow members of the Churches of Christ, asserted the allegations as politics.

In 1962, after information came to light that Estes had paid off four Agriculture officials for grain storage contracts, President John F. Kennedy ordered the Justice Department and FBI to open investigations into Estes&#x27; activities and determine if Secretary of Agriculture Orville L. Freeman had also been &quot;compromised&quot; (Freeman was cleared). Congress conducted hearings on Estes&#x27; business dealings, including some that led to Vice President Johnson, a long-time associate of Estes.

In 1963 Estes was tried and convicted on charges related to the fraudulent ammonia tank mortgages on both federal and state charges and was sentenced to 24 years in prison. His state conviction was later overturned by the United States Supreme Court in &quot;Estes v. Texas&quot;, . His appeal hinged upon the alleged impossibility of a fair trial due to the presence of television cameras and broadcast journalists in the courtroom. He prevailed by a 5–4 vote. Estes was paroled in 1971. Eight years later, he was convicted of other fraud charges and served four more years.

Oscar Griffin Jr., the journalist who uncovered the storage tank scandal, later received the 1963 Pulitzer Prize for his articles for a weekly newspaper in Pecos, Texas. To improve his 1961 candidacy for Reeves County school board, Estes offered the local newspaper large advertising buys in exchange for not opposing him. The &quot;Pecos Independent&quot; responded with an editorial that said, &quot;We will put our advertising columns up for sale, as will any other newspaper, but we WILL NOT sell our editorial support.&quot; In response, Estes launched the rival &quot;Pecos Daily News&quot; on August 1, 1961. He spent about $600,000 and the &quot;Independent&quot; lost $400,000. It was nearly bankrupt when Griffin, its editor, ran (February 12, 1962) the first of four articles describing Estes&#x27;s fraud but without naming him. Estes was arrested ten days after the last article ran in March. After his arrest, the &quot;Daily News&quot; went into receivership and the &quot;Independent&quot; bought it and merged the two newspapers into the &quot;Pecos Enterprise&quot;. When Griffin died in 2011, Estes remarked, &quot;It&#x27;s a good riddance that he left this world.&quot;

Estes’ schemes were parodied in 1963 by Allan Sherman in the song Shticks of One and a Half a Dozen of the Other, on his album, My Son, the Celebrity.

==Relationship with Lyndon Johnson==
Eight days before being sworn in as Vice-President of the United States in 1961, Lyndon B. Johnson wrote to Estes, thanking him for the gift of some roses, writing, &quot;It&#x27;s wonderful to have friends like you.&quot;

After the 1961 inauguration, Estes received an invitation from Cliff Carter, a Johnson aide. &quot;Call me in the Vice-President&#x27;s office as we can serve you.&quot; The &quot;Pecos Daily News&quot; pictured Estes chatting with the Vice-President&#x27;s daughter during inauguration week.

On March 28, 1962, during the leases scandal, Estes sought the advice of Frank Cain, an attorney for the Pacific Finance Corporation, one of the institutions to which Estes was in debt. Cain told Holland McCombs, a journalist, that Estes made calls to Lyndon Johnson&#x27;s Washington office while he was being investigated by federal and state agencies, saying he would have Johnson stop the investigation. &quot;I&#x27;ll get ahold of Lyndon and get him to call it off,&quot; Estes said. By &quot;it.&quot; he meant the investigation. Estes contributed large amounts to Johnson&#x27;s various campaigns for office, but some say that Johnson barely knew Estes, and that Estes was merely a name-dropper.

==Allegations linking Johnson to the assassination of Kennedy and others==
Estes alleged in the 1980s that he had inside knowledge that Johnson was involved in the assassination of Kennedy. In 1984, he provided a voluntary statement to a grand jury in Texas alleging that the homicide of Henry Marshall, a key investigator in the Department of Agriculture case, was perpetrated by Malcolm Wallace, an aide to Johnson, upon orders from the then-Vice President. Estes claimed that Johnson was involved in the fraud schemes and had the official killed to prevent him from exposing Johnson&#x27;s role. Two former Johnson associates responded to the allegations stating Estes was a &quot;pathological liar&quot;. When the Department of Justice asked for more information, Estes responded that he would provide information on eight other murders ordered by Johnson, including the assassination of Kennedy, in exchange for immunity from prosecution and a pardon. According to Estes, Johnson set up the assassination to become president.

Estes reiterated the claim in &quot;JFK Le Dernier Témoin: Assassinat de Kennedy, Enfin La Vérité!&quot; (&quot;JFK The Last Witness: Kennedy&#x27;s Assassination, Finally The Truth!&quot;), a book he co-wrote with a French writer in 2003. He said that he was not interested in writing the book—published only in France—but that he was offered &quot;a few hundred thousand dollars&quot; to contribute to it. According to the Associated Press, the allegation was &quot;rejected by prominent historians, Johnson aides and family members.&quot;

==Death==
Estes died at his home in DeCordova, Texas, on May 14, 2013, at the age of 88.

<text>Northern ( &quot;&quot;) is one of the 18 wilayat (states) of Sudan. It has an area of 348,765 km2 and an estimated population of 936,255. Northern Sudan was in ancient times Nubia. Jebel Uweinat is a mountain range in the area of the Egyptian-Libyan-Sudanese border. The state has been part of historical Sudanese kingdoms and countries such as the Mahdist State and the Kingdom of Kush. The state is bordering Egypt to the North, River Nile State to the east, Khartoum State to the southeast, North Kordofan to the South, and North Darfur and Libya to the west. The disputed Wadi Halfa Salient is located on the border of the state and Egypt.

==History==
Northern has been under control of a few Sudanese-Nubian kingdoms throughout its history. Here is a list of early kingdoms or Sudanese empires (countries/non recognized states) that controlled the state fully or partially.
*Kingdom of Kush
*Alodia
*Kingdom of Kerma
*Nobatia

The Sudanese Makuria kingdom was able to defeat Rashidun forces twice in the town of modern day Dongola. The first battle took place in 642, while the other took place in 652. The Funj Sultanate also controlled southeastern parts of the state.

===Sudanese civil war (2023-present)===
As other places on 15 April 2023 across Sudan, Northern was a sight of conflict for a small amount of time. The RSF battled the Sudanese and Egyptian army at the town and was defeated and had to withdraw to Khartoum. The battle ended RSF presence in the state. The state has not been a sight of war since April 2023 besides minor drone attacks.

==Localities==
*Dongola (Capital)
*Gararish
*Merowe
*Wadi Halfa
*Al Dabbah
*Delgo
*Al Goled
*Al Burgaig

<doc id="767637" wikidata="Q2552799" url="?curid=767637" title="System F">
<text>System F (also polymorphic lambda calculus or second-order lambda calculus) is a typed lambda calculus that introduces, to simply typed lambda calculus, a mechanism of universal quantification over types. System F formalizes parametric polymorphism in programming languages, thus forming a theoretical basis for languages such as Haskell and ML. It was discovered independently by logician Jean-Yves Girard (1972) and computer scientist John C. Reynolds.

Whereas simply typed lambda calculus has variables ranging over terms, and binders for them, System F additionally has variables ranging over &quot;types&quot;, and binders for them. As an example, the fact that the identity function can have any type of the form &quot;A&quot; → &quot;A&quot; would be formalized in System F as the judgement

:formula_1

where formula_2 is a type variable. The upper-case formula_3 is traditionally used to denote type-level functions, as opposed to the lower-case formula_4 which is used for value-level functions. (The superscripted formula_2 means that the bound &quot;x&quot; is of type formula_2; the expression after the colon is the type of the lambda expression preceding it.)

As a term rewriting system, System F is strongly normalizing. However, type inference in System F (without explicit type annotations) is undecidable. Under the Curry–Howard isomorphism, System F corresponds to the fragment of second-order intuitionistic logic that uses only universal quantification. System F can be seen as part of the lambda cube, together with even more expressive typed lambda calculi, including those with dependent types.

According to Girard, the &quot;F&quot; in &quot;System F&quot; was picked by chance.

== Typing rules ==

The typing rules of System F are those of simply typed lambda calculus with the addition of the following:

where formula_7 are types, formula_2 is a type variable, and formula_9 in the context indicates that formula_2 is bound. The first rule is that of application, and the second is that of abstraction.

== Logic and predicates ==
The formula_11 type is defined as:
formula_12, where formula_2 is a type variable. This means: formula_11 is the type of all functions which take as input a type α and two expressions of type α, and produce as output an expression of type α (note that we consider formula_15 to be right-associative.)

The following two definitions for the boolean values formula_16 and formula_17 are used, extending the definition of Church booleans:

: formula_18 
: formula_19

(Note that the above two functions require &quot;three&quot; — not two — arguments. The latter two should be lambda expressions, but the first one should be a type. This fact is reflected in the fact that the type of these expressions is formula_12; the universal quantifier binding the α corresponds to the Λ binding the alpha in the lambda expression itself. Also, note that formula_11 is a convenient shorthand for formula_12, but it is not a symbol of System F itself, but rather a &quot;meta-symbol&quot;. Likewise, formula_23 and formula_24 are also &quot;meta-symbols&quot;, convenient shorthands, of System F &quot;assemblies&quot; (in the Bourbaki sense); otherwise, if such functions could be named (within System F), then there would be no need for the lambda-expressive apparatus capable of defining functions anonymously and for the fixed-point combinator, which works around that restriction.)

Then, with these two formula_4-terms, we can define some logic operators (which are of type formula_26):
: formula_27

Note that in the definitions above, formula_11 is a type argument to formula_29, specifying that the other two parameters that are given to formula_29 are of type formula_11. As in Church encodings, there is no need for an function as one can just use raw formula_11-typed terms as decision functions. However, if one is requested:
: formula_33
will do.
A &quot;predicate&quot; is a function which returns a formula_11-typed value. The most fundamental predicate is which returns formula_16 if and only if its argument is the Church numeral :
: formula_36

==System F structures==

System F allows recursive constructions to be embedded in a natural manner, related to that in Martin-Löf&#x27;s type theory. Abstract structures () are created using &quot;constructors&quot;. These are functions typed as:
:formula_37.

Recursivity is manifested when itself appears within one of the types formula_38. If you have of these constructors, you can define the type of as:
:formula_39

For instance, the natural numbers can be defined as an inductive datatype with constructors
: formula_40
The System F type corresponding to this structure is
formula_41. The terms of this type comprise a typed version of the Church numerals, the first few of which are:
: formula_42

If we reverse the order of the curried arguments (&quot;i.e.,&quot; formula_43), then the Church numeral for is a function that takes a function as argument and returns the th power of . That is to say, a Church numeral is a higher-order function – it takes a single-argument function , and returns another single-argument function.

==Use in programming languages==

The version of System F used in this article is as an explicitly typed, or Church-style, calculus. The typing information contained in λ-terms makes type-checking straightforward. Joe Wells (1994) settled an &quot;embarrassing open problem&quot; by proving that type checking is undecidable for a Curry-style variant of System F, that is, one that lacks explicit typing annotations.

Wells&#x27;s result implies that type inference for System F is impossible.
A restriction of System F known as &quot;Hindley–Milner&quot;, or simply &quot;HM&quot;, does have an easy type inference algorithm and is used for many statically typed functional programming languages such as Haskell 98 and the ML family. Over time, as the restrictions of HM-style type systems have become apparent, languages have steadily moved to more expressive logics for their type systems. GHC, a Haskell compiler, goes beyond HM (as of 2008) and uses System F extended with non-syntactic type equality; non-HM features in OCaml&#x27;s type system include GADT.

==The Girard-Reynolds Isomorphism==
In second-order intuitionistic logic, the second-order polymorphic lambda calculus (F2) was discovered by Girard (1972) and independently by Reynolds (1974). Girard proved the &quot;Representation Theorem&quot;: that in second-order intuitionistic predicate logic (P2), functions from the natural numbers to the natural numbers that can be proved total, form a projection from P2 into F2. Reynolds proved the &quot;Abstraction Theorem&quot;: that every term in F2 satisfies a logical relation, which can be embedded into the logical relations P2. Reynolds proved that a Girard projection followed by a Reynolds embedding form the identity, i.e., the Girard-Reynolds Isomorphism.

== System Fω ==
While System F corresponds to the first axis of Barendregt&#x27;s lambda cube, System Fω or the higher-order polymorphic lambda calculus combines the first axis (polymorphism) with the second axis (type operators); it is a different, more complex system.

System Fω can be defined inductively on a family of systems, where induction is based on the kinds permitted in each system:

* formula_44 permits kinds:
** formula_45 (the kind of types) and
** formula_46 where formula_47 and formula_48 (the kind of functions from types to types, where the argument type is of a lower order)

In the limit, we can define system formula_49 to be

* formula_50

That is, Fω is the system which allows functions from types to types where the argument (and result) may be of any order.

Note that although Fω places no restrictions on the &quot;order&quot; of the arguments in these mappings, it does restrict the &quot;universe&quot; of the arguments for these mappings: they must be types rather than values. System Fω does not permit mappings from values to types (dependent types), though it does permit mappings from values to values (formula_4 abstraction), mappings from types to values (formula_3 abstraction), and mappings from types to types (formula_4 abstraction at the level of types).

==System F&lt;: ==
System F&lt;:, pronounced &quot;F-sub&quot;, is an extension of system F with subtyping. System F&lt;: has been of central importance to programming language theory since the 1980s because the core of functional programming languages, like those in the ML family, support both parametric polymorphism and record subtyping, which can be expressed in System F&lt;:.

<doc id="767638" wikidata="Q487709" url="?curid=767638" title="Central Equatoria">
<text>Central Equatoria is a state in South Sudan. With an area of , it is the smallest of the original South Sudanese states. Its previous name was Bahr al-Jabal (also Bahr-el-Jebel), named after a tributary of the White Nile that flows through the state. It was renamed Central Equatoria in the first Interim Legislative Assembly on 1 April 2005 under the government of Southern Sudan. Central Equatoria seceded from Sudan as part of the Republic of South Sudan on 9 July 2011. The state&#x27;s capital, Juba, is also the national capital of South Sudan. On October 2, 2015, the state was split into three states: Jubek, Terekeka, and Yei River. The state of Central Equatoria was re-established by a peace agreement signed on 22 February 2020.

== Administrative divisions ==
Central Equatoria, like other states in South Sudan, is subdivided into counties, which are further divided into Payams, then Bomas. Each county is led by a County Commissioner, appointed by the State Governor in consultation with the President. They are:
*Juba County
*Lainya County
*Morobo County
*Terekeka County
*Yei River County
*Kajo Keji County 
*
*major cities and towns of central equatoria
*
*

Juba, Kajo Keji, Liria, Mongalla, Wonduruba, Rokon, Tali, Terekeka, Yei, Ji-Menze, Tombek, Tindilo, Kaya, Muni, Morobo, and Rijong. The major border crossing to the neighboring Democratic Republic of the Congo is at Dimo, a village in the state.

== Demographics ==
Major tribes of Central Equatoria have included the
Bari,
Mandari, 
Pojulu, Kakwa, Keliko, Kuku, Lugbara, Avukaya, Baka, Nyangwara, Adio, and Lulubo. Minor tribes have included the Nyepo in Northern Kajo Keji County and the Lokoya along the Nimule Road. Erasto Gonda, Senior Folklore Officer for Central Equatoria&#x27;s information ministry, further detailed the State&#x27;s demographics:
== Culture and languages ==

Due to the South Sudanese Civil War, the state&#x27;s culture was heavily influenced by the countries neighboring South Sudan. Many South Sudanese fled to Ethiopia, Kenya and Uganda, where they interacted with the nationals and learned their languages and culture. Most of those who remained in the country or went north to Sudan and Egypt assimilated into Arab culture.

It is also worth noting that most South Sudanese diaspore kept the core of their culture even while in exile. Traditional culture is highly held and great attention is given to knowing one&#x27;s origin and dialect. Although the common languages spoken are Juba Arabic and English, Swahili began to be introduced to the population to improve the country&#x27;s relations with its East African neighbors. Many people from Central Equatoria use English, Kiswahili, Juba Arabic, their dialect, or a mixture of the languages mentioned.

<text>Western Equatoria is a state in South Sudan. It has an area of . The state capital is Yambio. The state was divided into counties, each headed by a County Commissioner. Western Equatoria seceded from Sudan as part of the Republic of South Sudan on 9 July 1956. On October 2, 2011, the state was divided into Amadi, Maridi, and Gbudwe states, and Tambura State was split from Gbudwe state on 14 January 2015. Western Equatoria was re-established by a peace agreement signed on 22 February 2020.

== History ==
Since the 16th century, Western Equatoria has been a home to the Avokaya, Azande, Baka, Moru, Mundu and Balanda.

The Mahdist Revolt of the 1880s destabilized the nascent province, and Equatoria ceased to exist as an Egyptian outpost in 1889. Important settlements in Equatoria included Lado, Gondokoro, Dufile and Wadelai. European colonial maneuverings in the region came to a head in 1898, when the Fashoda Incident occurred at present-day Kodok; Britain and France almost went to war over the region.[21] In 1947, British hopes to join South Sudan with Uganda, while leaving Western Equatoria as part of Belgian Congo were dashed by the Juba Conference to unify North and South Sudan.

In the middle of the twentieth century, after Sudan&#x27;s independence in 1956, Western Equatorians sacrificed their life for over 5 decades liberating in movements for the independence of South Sudanese, including the Anya Nya led by, Joseph Lagu and the Sudan People&#x27;s Liberation Army/Movement (SPLA/M), led by John Garang de Mabior, as they envisioned of New Sudan. Western Equatoria was also known as the breadbasket state for liberators during both civil wars.

Western Equatoria was separated from its sister state of Eastern Equatoria, becoming a province in 1976, and the two Equatoria provinces were once again inaugurated into 3 statehoods of Western Equatoria, Central Equatoria and Eastern Equatoria in the midst of the 1990s. Hence, there was a plan to re-unify the 3 sister states back into regions after the implementation of South Sudan&#x27;s federal system. But many suggested the three states should remain in place with each governor, while having a governor general to oversee the Greater Equatoria region.

== Counties ==

<text>Western Bahr el Ghazal is a state in South Sudan. It has an area of and is the least populous state in South Sudan, according to the controversial Sudanese census conducted in 2008. It is part of the Bahr el Ghazal region. Its capital is Wau. The state shared international borders with Sudan to the north and the Central African Republic to the west. The portion now occupied by Raga County (pronounced &#x27;Raja&#x27;) is the southern part of the historical region known as &quot;Dar Fertit&quot;.

==History==
This state, and Raga County in particular, was the part of South Sudan that was most affected by the slave trade conducted by nearby Muslim sultanates from the 18th century on and by Mameluk Egypt in the second half of the 19th century, and Raga County is the only part of South Sudan with a significant number of Muslims and Arabs. In addition to the Baggara Arabs, another local Muslim ethnic group is the Feroghe (Feroge, etc.). Traditionally, the northern part of Raga County falls within the &quot;Baggara belt&quot;, the 1400 kilometer wide section of the central Sahel in which cattle herding Arabic speaking tribes conduct seasonal nomadic migrations. When the slave trade soared in the 1860s and 1870s, the region&#x27;s population shrank dramatically, plunging by 75 percent to about 400,000. Depopulation was due to several factors all related to wars that were provoked by the upsurge in slaving promoted by Egypt, factors including: actual capture of inhabitants, emigration of refugees, and epidemics. The population according to the 2008 census was lower still. This may have been partly due to the second Sudanese civil war, 1983-1999, which devastated most of South Sudan, exacting a toll of two million dead civilians and hundreds of thousands of refugees.

During the Sudanese era power was controlled mainly by the Feroghe, including the NIF stalwart Ali Tamim Fartak, who ruled Western Bahr al-Ghazal from 1992 or 1993 until 1997. He later served as governor of South Darfur, as Minister of Electricity and as Minister of Education. Fartak currently leads the Islamic Movement for the Liberation of Raja.

In October 2015, Western Bahr el Ghazal was split into two new states, Lol State and Wau State, following an act by President Salva Kiir to establish 32 new states of South Sudan. 

Following a peace agreement at the conclusion of the South Sudanese Civil War in 2020, Western Bahr el Ghazal was reestablished along with the rest of the original ten states of South Sudan. Kiir appointed Sarah Cleto Hassan as governor, and the only woman to be appointed of eight governors.

==Geography==
Western Bahr el Ghazal is situated in South Sudan&#x27;s Bahr el Ghazal region, bordering Northern Bahr el Ghazal and Warrap to the west and Western Equatoria to the south. To the north it shares a border with the states of South Darfur and East Darfur in Sudan. To the west it shares a border with Haute-Kotto and Haut-Mbomou in the Central African Republic. It claims Kafia Kingi, though this is disputed by the government of Sudan, which asserts the area is a part of South Darfur. The Lol River crosses through the state.

==Demographics==
Local ethnic groups included the Luo, and Balanda Boor, Balanda Viri, Balanda Uoyu Juku (Balanda Viri, Balanda Bagari)( Balanda are one people settling in different locations hence Dem Zubier, Bagari, Bazia and Tambura are geographical names not tribal. they were found in both western Equatoria and Western Bahar El Ghazal states), Luo, Ndogo, Kresh, Bai, Baggara Arabs, and many others. Despite the common element &quot;Balanda&quot; in their names, the first two ethnicities are not related. Despite frequent mentions of the existence of a &quot;Fertit people&quot; in Western Bahr el Ghazal, there is no such people.

==Religion==

95 % population Christian,

== Administration ==

<text>West Darfur State ( Wilāyat Ḡarb Dārfūr), historically Dar Masalit (), is one of the states of Sudan, and one of five comprising the Darfur region. Prior to the creation of two new states in January 2012, it had an area of 79,460 km² and an estimated population of approximately 1,775,945 in 2018. It borders North and Central Darfur to the east. The Chadian prefectures of Biltine and Ouaddaï lie to the west, while to the north is the prefecture of Bourkou-Ennedi-Tibesti. Al-Junaynah is the capital of the state. West Darfur has been the site of much of the Darfur conflict.

During the 2023 Sudan conflict, ethnic violence has been rampant across the region. This has included several Masalit massacres.

<doc id="767647" wikidata="Q536396" url="?curid=767647" title="West Kordofan">
<text>West Kordofan (; ) is one of the 18 wilayat or provinces of Sudan. In 2006 it had an area of 111,373 km2 and an estimated population of approximately 1,320,405. Al-Fulah is the capital of the state.

In August 2005, West Kordofan State was abolished and its territory divided between North and South Kordofan States, in implementation of the Protocol between the Government of Sudan (GOS) and the Sudan People’s Liberation Movement (SPLM) on the resolution of conflict in Southern Kordofan/Nuba Mountains and Blue Nile States signed at Naivasha, Kenya, 26 May 2004. Section 2.1 of the protocol states that &quot;The boundaries of Southern Kordofan/Nuba Mountains State shall be the same boundaries of former Southern Kordofan Province when Greater Kordofan was sub-divided into two provinces.&quot; The protocol forms part of the Comprehensive Peace Agreement between the government of Sudan and the Sudan People&#x27;s Liberation Movement. Al Fulah presently has the status of second capital of South Kordofan State, and sessions of the state Legislative Council are to alternate between Al Fulah and Kaduqli. The state was reestablished in July 2013.

==Role in the Third Sudanese civil war==
In the new civil war in Sudan, the RSF has gained large parts of the state. On 25 April 2023, the RSF took control of Wad Banda. Despite RSF control of Wad Banda, West Kordofan had not been in conflict until August. On 14 August 2023, the RSF attacked the town of El-Khoi, resulting in the injuries of 3 civilians, seizing two police vehicles, one ambulance, and one civilian vehicle. By the 16th, the RSF waged an offensive on the capital of the state, El-Fulah, against the Sudanese army. By the end of 2023, RSF gained areas in the state. In the beginning of 2024, the RSF laid siege to Babanusa. This comes in response to SAF airstrikes near the city. By the end of 2024, the RSF had gained a heavy upper hand in the state by taking control of the capital and main roads with all the major localities, villages, towns, and cities, under its control. The RSF captured the capital, El-Fulah, after the Sudanese army withdrew to Babanusa. The SAF was able to keep control of its positions in En-Nahud but is surrounded. The Sudanese army made progress as well lifting the siege of Babanusa. Since June 2024, the conflict in West Kordofan has been unreported and seems no sides are waging military campaigns against the other in the state.

<text>Helmut Koinigg (3 November 1948 – 6 October 1974) was an Austrian racing driver who died in a crash in the 1974 United States Grand Prix, in his second Grand Prix start.

==Racing career==
Koinigg was born in Vienna. Like several other Formula One drivers, Koinigg&#x27;s first racing car was a Mini Cooper, which he had purchased from Niki Lauda. He raced in touring cars, Formula Vee and Formula Ford before a period in sports car racing. He subsequently found the finance to buy a seat with Scuderia Finotto driving their Brabham at his home Grand Prix in 1974, and although he failed to qualify, this led to a contract with Surtees for the last two races of the season.

After a good showing at the 1974 Canadian Grand Prix, Koinigg was beginning to establish himself as a good prospect for 1975. But running near the back in the US Grand Prix at Watkins Glen, Koinigg&#x27;s car suffered a suspension failure at turn 7, pitching it head-on into the Armco barrier. The speed at which Koinigg crashed was relatively low, and he ought to have escaped the accident uninjured. However, as with a number of other circuits at that time, the Armco was insecurely installed and the bottom portion of it buckled as the vehicle struck it. The car passed underneath the top portion, which remained intact, decapitating Koinigg and killing him instantly. Koinigg&#x27;s accident was reminiscent of the death of Formula One driver François Cevert on the other side of the circuit in turns 2-4 the previous year.

<text>South Kordofan ( &quot;&quot;) is one of the 18 wilayat or states of Sudan. It has an area of 158,355 km2 and an estimated population of approximately 2,107,623 people (2018 est). Kaduqli is the capital of the state. It is centered on the Nuba Mountains. At one time it was supposed that South Kordofan was the only state in (North) Sudan suitable for producing oil, but oil has also been discovered in neighboring White Nile State in larger quantities.

Under the Comprehensive Peace Agreement, residents of South Kordofan were to hold popular consultations in 2011 to determine the constitutional future of the state. However, South Kordofan governor Ahmed Haroun suspended the process and violence followed. Haroun had previously been charged with war crimes against civilians and crime against humanity by the International Criminal Court.

== History ==

Although South Kordofan is part of Sudan, it is home to many pro-South Sudan communities, especially in the Nuba Mountains, some of whom fought alongside southern rebels during the long civil war.

In 2009 and 2010, a series of conflicts between rival nomadic tribes in South Kordofan caused a large number of casualties and displaced thousands.

On June 6, 2011, An armed conflict broke out between the forces of Northern and Southern Sudan, ahead of the scheduled independence of the South on July 9. This followed an agreement for both sides to withdraw from Abyei. On June 20, the parties agreed to demilitarize the contested area of Abyei where Ethiopian peacekeepers were deployed. Abyei is currently controlled by the United Nations Interim Security Force for Abyei.

<text>Jonglei State is a state of South Sudan with Bor as its centre of government and the biggest city. Jonglei state comprises nine counties: Bor, Akobo, Ayod, Uror, Duk, Nyirol, Pigi, Twic East, and Fangak. Jonglei State is the largest state by area before reorganisation, with an area of approximately 122,581 km2, as well as the most populous according to the 2008 census conducted in present-day South Sudan&#x27;s second period of autonomy. The boundaries of the state were again changed as a result of a peace agreement signed on 22 February 2020.

In the 21st century, Jonglei State has been marred by ethnic clashes, which the UNMISS estimated in May 2012 had affected the lives of over 140,000 people, and which have been magnified by the broader South Sudanese conflict since December 2013.

==Administrative divisions==
Jonglei State is divided into 9 counties as follows:
* Akobo County
* Ayod County
* Bor County
* Duk County
* Fangak County
* Nyirol County
* Pigi County
* Twic East County
* Uror County

==History==
===20th century===
The capital of the state, Bor, became an administrative centre under the Anglo-Egyptian Sudan (1899 -1956) for the Dinka Bor. It was in Malek, a small settlement, about , south of Bor that the first modern Christian mission in present-day South Sudan was established by Archibald Shaw in December 1905. Bor became the first area to host a Church Missionary Society station in 1905. Shaw opened the first primary school in Malek. This school produced the first indigenous Anglican bishop to be consecrated in Dinka land, Daniel Deng Atong, the first person to be baptized in 1916 in Bor. In 1912, the British established Pibor Post, a colonial era outpost which was originally called Fort Bruce in the eastern part of Jonglei State. From 1919 to 1976, the territory belonged to the state of the Upper Nile region in what was initially Anglo-Egyptian Sudan.

The state has a long history of unrest which affected other parts of Sudan. The First Sudanese Civil War which lasted from 1955 until 1972 broke out with a Southern rebellion in Torit in imatong state) against Northern armed officers. In 1983, the Second Sudanese Civil War also broke out in Bor.

In the 1970s, the Investigation Team was established by the Sudanese government to investigate affairs and development potential in the region. In 1976, Jonglei was split off from the Upper Nile as a separate province. Construction of the Jonglei Canal project, a 360 km long canal between Bor and where the Sobat River joins the White Nile began construction in 1978 but was halted in 1983-4 for political, financial and technical reasons. From 1991 to 1994, the territory was again included within the newly defined borders of Upper Nile State. On 14 February 1994, Jonglei state was again split off as a separate state.

===21st century===
Jonglei State has long suffered from tribal infighting. Much of the conflict is over basic resources of food, land, and water, and personal grudges related to the abduction of women and children and theft of cattle. In November and December 2007, clashes between Murle and Dinke tribesmen had worsened to revenge attacks, killing over 34 people and injuring over 100. On one outbreak in late November 2007, eight Dinka tribesmen and 7,000 cattle were stole near the village of Padak, about 20 kilometres north-east of Bor. Many fled to the Kakuma Camp in northwestern Kenya, and they amounted to some 85 percent of the total 3,000 or so refugees reaching the camp.

Violence between Murle and Nuer tribes has been central to the attacks in the state. The Geneva Small Arms Survey concluded that the &quot;Murle–Lou Nuer conflict in Jonglei State is indicative of how tribal and political dynamics are intertwined in the post-CPA period.&quot; A civilian disarmament operation targeting primarily the Nuer communities in 2005–06 resulted in a major outbreak of violence against the authorities, who believed that the crackdown was politically motivated. In August 2007, some 80 people were killed in Murle–Lou Nuer clashes. In 2009 alone, some 86,000 people were displaced, and at least 1248 killed as a result of violent clashes. One attack at Lilkwanglei in March 2009 claimed 450 lives, wounding 45 and displacing 5000 people. A month later, 250 were killed, 70 wounded and 15,000 displaced at Akoko. 24,000 were displaced as a result of attack in August 2009 at Panyangor. Between January 2011 and September 2012, some 2600 people died in clashes in Jonglei State. In January 2012 clashes between Murle and Nuer tribes again broke out over cattle. Outbreaks between Nuer and Murle people have been the most severe in Nyirol and Pibor counties but have also affected other counties.

In May 2012, state governor, Kuol Manyang Juuk stated that 3,651 people had been killed, 385 people wounded, 1,830 children abducted, and 3,983,613 cattle stolen. The UN estimated at the time that ongoing clashes had affected the lives of over 140,000 people. The Sudan People&#x27;s Liberation Army (SPLA), international defence forces, and UN Peacekeepers are struggling to defuse the ongoing conflict and protect civilians against raids. The Bor Peace Conference was signed on 6 May 2012 in Bor, and has since been trying to improve the situation in the region. Despite the peace agreement, attacks continued to follow. On 9 May 2012 two people were killed and one was injured in an attack by the Murle on 32 cows in Twic East. A day later, a car traveling from Juba to Bor belonging to the South Sudan Ministry of Roads and Bridges was attacked near Panwell village in Bangachorot, killing the driver and wounding two policemen.

In January 2013, more than 100 people, mainly women and children, were slaughtered during cattle raids. In February 2013, 114 civilians, mainly women and children, along with 14 SPLA soldiers, were killed in Walgak after the community was attacked by the rebel group of David Yau Yau and Murle youth. On 9 April 2013, five Indian UNMISS troops and seven civilian UN employees (two UN staff and five contractors) were killed in a rebel ambush in Jonglei while escorting a UN convoy between Pibor and Bor. Nine further UN employees, both military and civilian, were wounded and some remain missing. Four of the civilians killed were Kenyan contractors working to drill water boreholes. One of the dead soldiers was a lieutenant-colonel and one of the wounded was a captain. According to South Sudan&#x27;s military spokesman, the convoy was attacked by Yau Yau&#x27;s rebel forces that they believe are supported by the Sudanese government. UNMISS said that 200 armed men were involved in the attack and that their convoy was escorted by 32 Indian UN peacekeepers. The attackers were equipped with rocket propelled grenades. A UN spokesman said that the fierce resistance put up by their peacekeepers forced the rebels to withdraw and saved the lives of many of the civilians. UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon labelled the killings a war crime, and called for the perpetrators to be brought to justice. Rebel group South Sudan Democratic Movement/Army (SSDM/A) denied responsibility for the murders of the UN peacekeepers.

==Geography==
Jonglei State, which covers an area of , forms the bulk of the eastern part of South Sudan covering most of the eastern centre. Located in the Greater Upper Nile region, it is bordered by Upper Nile State to the north, Unity State to the northwest and west, Lakes State to the southwest, Central Equatoria to the southwest, Eastern Equatoria to the south, and Ethiopia to the east.

The principal town, Bor, lies in the southwestern corner of the state. Other towns include Akobo, Ayod, Fangak, Padak, Pibor, Pochalla and Waat. The principal rivers are the White Nile, which flows in the western part of the state, and the Pibor River, which flows in the central-east. The Pibor and its tributaries drain a watershed in size. The river&#x27;s mean annual discharge at its mouth is 98 m³/s (3,460 ft³/s). In the southern part of the state is the Kenamuke Swamp (Kobowen), a wetland which is part of the Boma National Park. In June 2007, &quot;Animal Geographic Magazine&quot; estimated that over 1.3 million animals lived in Boma National Park. It is &quot;home to one of the largest migrations in the world with an estimated 800,000 white-eared kob antelope, 250,000 Mongalla gazelle and some 160,000 tiang moving across Jonglei State&quot;, according to the Wildlife Conservation Society.

==Economy==
The economy of Jonglei State is mostly dependent upon livestock, agriculture and fishing. Most of inhabitants are employed in the agricultural sector. UNEP says that the Dinka people of the state are &quot;agro-pastoralists, combining cattle-rearing with wet season agriculture, and migrating seasonally according to the rains and the inundation of the toic (seasonal floodplains).&quot;
Most of Jonglei State falls within the oil development Block B, which was granted to Total S.A. before independence. Chevron Oil has been one of the major developers of oil extraction in Jonglei. Exploration of petroleum has been stalled by ongoing (as of January 2013) violence.

The Jonglei Canal Project, formulated in the mid 1970s to build a 360 km long canal between Bor and where the Sobat River joins the White Nile in the far north near Malakal, is the most prominent project to have ever been conducted in the state and is also one of its greatest failures. Construction began in 1978 but was halted in 1983-4 for political, financial and technical reasons, and today abandoned machinery used to construct the canal is rusting away. The project was a highly controversial one, and in 1979 the Wildlife Clubs of South Sudan (WCSS) was established, which led the campaign against its construction. The building of the canal had a negative impact on the lives of thousands of people in local communities who had to be displaced to accommodate for the canal, and &quot;deprived them of dry-season grazing land for their cattle and other livestock&quot;. Although &quot;New Scientist&quot; said in 1983 that the impact of the canal which by-passed a large area of the Sudd swamps was unclear, more recently experts have concluded that it would have had a devastating impact upon the vast wetland in the south of the state which is a unique ecosystem for a diversity of wildlife, drying it up. Researchers from Iowa State University concluded that the canal project to provide irrigation had always been a lost cause and would have proved ineffective and that future agricultural development in southern Sudan could only be achieved by rain-fed crops and mechanized agriculture. Whittington and McClelland in 1992, however, evaluated the opportunity costs of the Jonglei Canal I project at $US 500 million.

The main hospital and schools are in Bor. Access to adequate healthcare in the state is extremely poor, and the situation has worsened since 2009 when Médecins Sans Frontières Belgium, who had been running the Bor Hospital, pulled out of the country amidst security concerns. Dr Samuel Legato Agat, a doctor at the hospital, was trained in Cuba and Canada, but most staff at the hospital as of 2012 were illiterate and incapable of producing documentation for patients. Kenya Commercial Bank (South Sudan) maintains a branch in Bor. The main transport connections are Bor Airport at Bor, in addition to river traffic on the White Nile and three major roads that lead out of Bor to other parts of South Sudan.

==Demographics==
Jonglei State is inhabited mostly by Dinka (Monyjang/Jieng) and the Nuer people. The other ethnic groups include; Murle, Anuak, Jie, and Boya.

==Education==
The John Garang Memorial University of Science and Technology, one of the seven public universities in the country, is located in Bor. The university is named after John Garang de Mabior. Most of all educational institutions are concentrated in Bor, including number of best secondary schools in the country. Some of the leading schools in Bor are Bor College, Greenbelt Academy, St. Andrew High School, and many more.

<text>Thomas Maldwyn Pryce (11 June 1949 – 5 March 1977) was a British racing driver from Wales known for winning the Brands Hatch Race of Champions, a non-championship Formula One race, in 1975 and for the circumstances surrounding his death at age 27. Pryce is the only Welsh driver to have won a Formula One race and is also the only Welshman to lead a Formula One World Championship Grand Prix: two laps of the 1975 British Grand Prix.

Pryce started his career in Formula One with the small Token team, making his only start for them at the 1974 Belgian Grand Prix. Shortly after winning the Formula Three support race for the 1974 Monaco Grand Prix, Pryce joined the Shadow team and scored his first points in Germany in only his fourth race. Pryce later claimed two podium finishes, his first in Austria in 1975 and the second in Brazil a year later. Pryce was considered by his team and most of its contemporaries as a great wet-weather driver.

In his four seasons in the sport with the Shadow team from 1974 to 1977, Pryce was identified as a potential future race winner and future world champion. Although the car was often unreliable and rarely in the points, it was on occasion quick enough to grab headlines.

During the practice session for the 1977 South African Grand Prix, run in wet conditions, Pryce was faster than everyone, including world champion drivers Niki Lauda and James Hunt. During the race, he collided at high speed with a safety marshal, Frederik Jansen van Vuuren, and both men were killed. A memorial to Pryce was unveiled in 2009 in his home town of Ruthin.

== Personal and early life ==
Tom Pryce was born on 11 June 1949 in Ruthin, Denbighshire, Wales, to Jack and Gwyneth Pryce ( Hughes). Jack had served in the Royal Air Force as a tail-gunner on a Lancaster bomber before joining the local police force. Gwyneth was a district nurse. Pryce&#x27;s older brother, David, died at the age of three leaving Tom an only child for much of the time he was growing up, although his parents did foster a young girl called Sandra for a while. Pryce, known to his friends as Mald, attended Nantglyn Primary School, Denbighshire. The family later moved to Towyn, Denbighshire, due to Jack&#x27;s job.

Pryce took an interest in cars while driving a baker&#x27;s van at the age of 10, before informing his parents that he wanted to be a racing driver. During an interview with Alan Henry in 1975, he stated that he had wanted to become a pilot, but thought he was not intelligent enough. Like many future Formula One drivers, Pryce had a childhood racing hero. In his case it was Lotus&#x27;s Scottish driver Jim Clark. Pryce&#x27;s mother recalled that he was very upset when Clark died at the Hockenheimring in April 1968. His father noted that &quot;he was very upset when Jochen Rindt was killed, too&quot;. After he left school at 16, Pryce&#x27;s mother insisted that he take an apprenticeship as a tractor mechanic at Llandrillo Technical College, giving him &quot;something to fall back on&quot;, as she put it, if his career as a racing driver was unsuccessful.

In 1975 Pryce married Fenella, more commonly known as Nella, whom he met at a disco in Otford, Kent in 1973. Following the death of her husband, Nella went on to run an antiques store in Fulham, London with Janet Brise, the widow of Tony Brise, who died in a plane crash in 1975 with fellow racing driver, Graham Hill and later moved to France.

== Helmet design ==
Tom Pryce&#x27;s helmet design was, in comparison to later drivers&#x27;, simple and restrained. His helmet was plain white all over until 1970. At that year&#x27;s race at Castle Combe, his father asked Pryce to make his helmet stand out more so that he could easily identify him in a pack of cars. Pryce added five black vertical lines to his helmet, placed just above his visor. From that time the only change to this design was the addition of a Welsh flag to the side of his helmet in 1974.

== Career ==

=== Pre–Formula One ===

==== 1969–1971: early years ====
Pryce&#x27;s first steps into motor racing came at the Mallory Park circuit in Leicestershire when he was 20. Pryce was put through his paces by Trevor Taylor, an ex-Team Lotus driver and old teammate of Pryce&#x27;s childhood hero Clark. He later became a star in the Formula 5000 series. From there, Pryce went on to compete in the &quot;Daily Express Crusader Championship&quot;, a series run by &quot;Motor Racing Stables&quot; for racing school pupils using Lotus 51 Formula Ford cars. Races alternated between the Brands Hatch and Silverstone circuits; Pryce made his début at the former. &quot;The races were £35 a time. But I sold my Mini and my parents offered all the help and encouragement I could wish for&quot; Pryce recalled to Alan Henry.

The prize for the overall winner of the series was a Formula Ford Lola T200 worth £1,500. The series was decided at the last round, held at Silverstone, the day before the 1970 Formula One International Trophy. Pryce qualified on the third row for the race, which was held in rain. Jack Pryce remembered that his son was rubbing his hands in delight: &quot;he always loved racing in the rain&quot;. The early part of the race was led by a driver called Chris Smith but then heavy rain started and Pryce was able to catch up with Smith and overtake him before winning by a comfortable margin. He was given his Lola by Sir Max Aitken.

Pryce took his new car to Brands Hatch, where he was allowed to house it in one of the old stables at the bottom of the paddock. Pryce soon abandoned his farming career and moved to a guest house in West Kingsdown, near the Brands Hatch circuit. Pryce continued to make a name for himself during 1971, entering a new twin-seater Sportscar category called Formula F100, which he won with what was described by motorsports author David Tremayne as &quot;embarrassing ease&quot;. He then moved up to Formula Super Vee, driving the then-choice Royale RP9, for Team Rumsey Investments, and soon made his Formula Three début for the same manufacturer at Brands Hatch.

==== 1972–73: lower formulae ====
In that race at Brands Hatch, Pryce took an unfancied Royale RP11 to first place in the Formula Three support race for the 1972 Formula One Race of Champions against many established Formula Three drivers such as Roger Williamson, Jochen Mass and James Hunt. So large was Pryce&#x27;s advantage at the end of the race, many of the other teams voiced an opinion that Pryce&#x27;s car had run the race underweight; it turned out that the circuit&#x27;s weighbridge certificate had expired and everyone&#x27;s cars had been underweight. Pryce retired from the leading group in the following two rounds at Oulton Park and Zandvoort, and then during practice for the support race of the 1972 Monaco Grand Prix his car came to a stop at &quot;Casino Square&quot; after a wire had come loose. He had exited his car to correct the problem when Peter Lamplough lost control of his car and struck the Royale RP11. Pryce was knocked into a shop window and broke a leg.

The Welshman was back in action two weeks after his incident in Monaco. Pryce also ran in the Formula SuperVee series, winning the series by a comfortable margin, &quot;I won just about every race I went in for&quot; Pryce recalled. A run with Royale&#x27;s Formula Atlantic works team was also in store for Pryce during 1972, where he took pole position for the final three rounds of the championship and won the final round at Brands Hatch.

He continued racing in Formula Atlantic in 1973, winning three races. Royale soon had plans to enter Formula Two, such was the Welshman&#x27;s talent. The ambition to run in the Formula Two championship was planned to be financially fuelled by a Liechtenstein driver, Manfred Schurti. These plans only resulted in one of Royale&#x27;s F2 cars being built before the project was scrapped and Bob King, the head of Royale, left the company.

Following an invitation to test one of his cars, Pryce found himself racing in the Formula Two series with Ron Dennis&#x27;s &quot;Rondel Racing&quot; outfit. His best result for the team came at the Norisring where he was leading the race until a brake failure meant he had to give up first place to teammate Tim Schenken. At the end of 1973, Pryce won the Grovewood Award for his efforts during the year. Jack Pryce recalled that his son did not want to win the award, as he thought it was &quot;a jinx on a driver&#x27;s career&quot;.

=== Formula One ===

==== 1974: Token ====

At the age of 25, Pryce graduated to Formula One, the highest category of circuit racing defined by the Fédération Internationale de l&#x27;Automobile (FIA), motorsport&#x27;s world governing body, joining the newly formed Token Racing team. The team was created by Tony Vlassopulos and Ken Grob after the original Token team closed down in 1973 due to a lack of financial backing which had led to the end of the previous &quot;Rondel Racing&quot; outfit. Pryce was given the seat thanks to his backing from Titan Properties, and what David Tremayne described as &quot;evident promise&quot;. Pryce made his début for the team at the BRDC International Trophy, a non-championship Formula One event held at Silverstone, but lack of an airbox and an engine cover, along with his shortage of experience in the car, made him the slowest driver of the 16 competitors during qualifying: 26 seconds slower than James Hunt&#x27;s Hesketh in pole position. The Welshman retired 15 laps into the race with a gear linkage problem. Pryce&#x27;s World Championship début came at the 1974 Belgian Grand Prix, where he qualified in 20th place, 3 seconds slower than the fastest time set by Clay Regazzoni. Once again, he failed to finish, completing 66 laps before retiring after a collision with Jody Scheckter&#x27;s Tyrrell.

Pryce was refused entry to the 1974 Monaco Formula One Grand Prix, as he was deemed &quot;inexperienced&quot;. Tony Vlassopulos decided to prove a point and replaced normal Formula 3 driver Buzz Buzaglo, with Pryce for the supporting Formula Three race, driving for &quot;Ippokampos Racing&quot;, in a March 743, which he won by 20.8 seconds.

==== 1974–77: Shadow ====
=====1974=====

Following his drive in Monaco, and a short spell in Formula Two, Pryce was signed by Shadow as replacement for Brian Redman, who had in turn replaced the late Peter Revson. Pryce made his début for the team in Holland. He qualified in 11th position, less than 0.4 seconds slower than his teammate, Jean-Pierre Jarier, who was in his second full season of Formula One competition. Pryce retired on the first lap of the race after a collision with James Hunt at the first corner broke his Shadow DN3&#x27;s rear suspension. Pryce qualified third in his second Grand Prix for the team, in France, 0.32 seconds slower than Niki Lauda&#x27;s pole position time but nearly half a second quicker than Jarier. Once again, Pryce&#x27;s race ended at the first corner, when minor contact with Carlos Reutemann&#x27;s Brabham deflected Pryce&#x27;s Shadow into the path of James Hunt. The second collision between the two British drivers in as many races eliminated them both. Later in the season, Pryce received 100 bottles of champagne for finishing fastest in the practice session for the at Brands Hatch. He went on to qualify on the fourth row of the starting grid.

Pryce scored the first point of his career in Germany, at the most challenging circuit on the F1 calendar at the time, the 14.2 mile Nürburgring circuit. After finishing 6th from 11th on the grid, he then qualified in 16th for the next Grand Prix in Austria, but spun off on lap 22, ending his race. He qualified in 22nd place in Italy, and finished 12 places higher. His season ended with an engine failure in Canada, and the Shadow severely off the pace at Watkins Glen in the United States. At the end of the season Pryce was equal 18th in the Drivers&#x27; Championship with veteran Graham Hill and Vittorio Brambilla.

=====1975=====

At the start of the 1975 season, Pryce&#x27;s future was subject to much speculation. Rumour linked him with a drive at Lotus, the team run by Colin Chapman, who had been keeping an eye on Pryce&#x27;s progress throughout 1973 and 1974. At the time, Lotus was experiencing financial difficulties and reports suggested that Shadow and Lotus would swap Pryce and Swede Ronnie Peterson. The trade was viewed as a good acquisition for both teams, as Pryce was considered a driver of the same ability as Peterson, but would cost Lotus less, while Peterson could attract sponsorship to the relatively new Shadow team. The deal never materialised, although Shadow team manager Alan Rees claims that it came very close to being completed.

Pryce&#x27;s Shadow teammate, Jean-Pierre Jarier, out-qualified him in the early part of the 1975 season, as the French driver had the new Shadow DN5 car, while Pryce was in the older DN3. It was not until the third round, the , that Pryce was able to use a DN5. The team&#x27;s fourth race of the season was the non-championship Race of Champions held at Brands Hatch. Pryce qualified on pole position and, following a poor start, passed Peterson and Jacky Ickx before closing an eight-second gap to race leader Jody Scheckter, whose engine failed while Pryce harried him, letting Pryce through to become the first Welshman to win a Formula One race. Pryce showed other signs of promise during the season, most notably in Monaco and Silverstone where he qualified on the front row of the grid, the latter being in pole position. Pryce also achieved his first World Championship podium finish, in extremely wet conditions at the and finished in the points four more times. The highest of those came in Germany where he finished fourth, despite the fact that while he was running second behind Carlos Reutemann fuel had been leaking into the cockpit of his DN5 during the final laps around the Nürburgring, reportedly &quot;searing his skin and almost blinding him with fumes&quot;. The Welshman later received the &quot;Prix Rouge et Blanc Jo Siffert award&quot;, named after the Swiss Formula One driver, for this achievement.

At the end of December 1975, Pryce and Dave Richards, future head of the Prodrive motorsports engineering company, entered a Lancia Stratos in the Tour of Epynt, a rally event contested by many established rallying names. Pryce needed little persuasion to team up for the one-off event on home soil with Richards, both of whom were from Ruthin. Pryce crashed into a bridge into the first stage, but still competed in the afternoon stages after his car was rebuilt.

=====1976=====

Once the 1976 Formula One World Championship season got under way Pryce instantly added a second podium finish to his tally, at the first round in Brazil. This came at the expense of continuing teammate Jarier, who was caught out by oil on the track from James Hunt&#x27;s McLaren. Both Shadows enjoyed reasonable competitiveness during the next two races at Kyalami and Long Beach. Changes in car regulations, meaning that teams had to lower their airboxes and mount the cars&#x27; rear wings further forward, along with revised Goodyear tyres, meant the Shadow DN5B lost much of its competitiveness; Pryce still achieved a second points scoring finish of the season in Britain. The new Shadow DN8 was not introduced until the twelfth round at Zandvoort, where Pryce qualified the new car in third, and finished the race only one place lower in fourth: it was the last points scoring finish of his career. The Welshman finished his last full season 12th in the Drivers&#x27; Championship with 10 points, 59 points behind World Champion James Hunt.

=====1977=====

Rumors that Pryce would run as Mario Andretti&#x27;s teammate for the Lotus team in 1978 were strong, as it coincided with the end of his contract with Shadow. A Lotus mechanic of the era even claimed many years later that the signing of Tom Pryce for the team would have become a reality if he had not died, as Peterson was hired at the last minute after an express offer from Chapman for a succulent amount of money in exchange for being Mario Andretti&#x27;s number two in replacement of Gunnar Nilsson, who was going to go to the Arrows team in 1978 to team up with Riccardo Patrese. This latter fact was confirmed by Patrese in &quot;Motorsport&quot; magazine in an interview by Simon Taylor in 2010.

Jarier left Shadow before the start of the 1977 Formula One season, for ATS, and was replaced by Italian Renzo Zorzi, who was later rated by Jackie Oliver, part of the managerial team at Shadow, as &quot;the worst driver we [the Shadow team] ever had&quot;. The new signing brought in sponsorship from Italy, easing Shadow&#x27;s financial position. Pryce started the first race of the year in Argentina in ninth place and stayed with the leading group until a gear linkage failure on the 45th lap of the 52 lap race. Following a long pit stop to fix the fault, he was not classified. Pryce qualified 12th for the second round in Brazil, but on lap 34 retired from the race, while running in second place, as the result of an engine failure.

====Legacy====
In 2016, in an academic paper that reported a mathematical modelling study that assessed the relative influence of driver and machine, Pryce was ranked the 28th best Formula One driver of all time.

== Death ==
Tom Pryce began his final race weekend, the 1977 South African Grand Prix at Kyalami, by setting the fastest time in the Wednesday practice session, held in wet weather. Pryce posted a time of 1 minute 31.57 seconds with the next best, the eventual 1977 World Champion Niki Lauda, one second slower. The weather dried up prior to the Thursday session, and he slipped back down the grid to fifteenth place, almost two seconds slower than James Hunt&#x27;s pole position time.

Pryce made a poor start to the Grand Prix in his DN8 and by the end of the first lap was in last place. Pryce started to climb back up the field during the next couple of laps, overtaking Brett Lunger and teammate Renzo Zorzi on lap two, and Alex Ribeiro and Boy Hayje the following lap. By lap 18 Pryce had moved from 22nd to 13th place.

On lap 22, Zorzi pulled off to the left side of the main straight, just after the brow of a hill and a bridge over the track. He was having problems with his fuel metering unit, and fuel was pumping directly onto the engine, which then caught fire. Zorzi did not immediately get out of his car as he could not disconnect the oxygen pipe from his helmet.

The situation caused two marshals from the pit wall on the opposite side of the track to intervene. The first marshal to cross the track was a 25-year-old panel beater named Bill, and the second was 19-year-old Frederik &quot;Frikkie&quot; Jansen van Vuuren, who was carrying a fire extinguisher. George Witt, the chief pit marshal for the race, said that the policy of the circuit was that in cases of fire, two marshals must attend and a further two act as back-up in case the first pair&#x27;s extinguishers were not effective enough. Witt also recalled that both marshals crossed the track without prior permission. The former narrowly made it across the track, but the latter did not. As the two men started to run across the track, the cars driven by Hans-Joachim Stuck and Pryce came over the brow of a rise in the track.

Pryce was directly behind Stuck&#x27;s car along the main straight. Stuck saw Jansen van Vuuren and moved to the right to avoid both marshals, missing Bill by what Tremayne calls &quot;millimetres&quot;. From his position Pryce could not see Jansen van Vuuren and was unable to react as quickly as Stuck had done. He struck the teenage marshal at approximately 270 km/h (170 mph). Jansen van Vuuren was thrown into the air and landed a few yards in front of Zorzi&#x27;s car. Badly mutilated by Pryce&#x27;s car, he died instantly. The fire extinguisher he had been carrying smashed into Pryce&#x27;s head, before striking the Shadow&#x27;s roll hoop. The force of the impact was such that the extinguisher was thrown up and over the adjacent grandstand. It landed in the car park to the rear of the stand, where it hit a parked car and jammed its door shut.

The impact with the fire extinguisher wrenched Pryce&#x27;s helmet upward sharply, killing him almost instantly. Pryce&#x27;s Shadow DN8, now with its driver dead at the wheel, continued at speed down the main straight towards the first corner, called &quot;Crowthorne&quot;. The car left the track to the right, scraping the metal barriers, hitting an entrance for emergency vehicles, and veering back onto the track. It then hit Jacques Laffite&#x27;s Ligier, sending both Pryce and Laffite head-on into the barriers. Jansen van Vuuren&#x27;s injuries were so extensive that, initially, his body was identified only after the race director had summoned all of the race marshals and he was not among them.

The eventual race winner was Austrian Niki Lauda, his first win since his near fatal accident during the 1976 German Grand Prix. At first he announced it was the greatest victory of his career, but when told on the victory podium of Pryce&#x27;s death, he said that &quot;there was no joy after that&quot;.

=== Aftermath ===

Pryce&#x27;s death was met with great grief from all those who knew him, especially his wife Nella, his parents Jack and Gwyneth and the Shadow team. His body was buried at St Bartholomew&#x27;s Church in Otford, near Sevenoaks, Kent, the same church where he and Nella were married two years earlier.

Pryce&#x27;s performances in a Formula One car earned him much respect amongst the F1 paddock. David Tremayne named his son after the Welshman. The Tom Pryce Award, also known as the Tom Pryce Trophy, was instigated, and is given annually to Welsh personalities who have made an outstanding contribution to motoring or transport.

During its re-design, the Anglesey Circuit in North Wales named the Tom Pryce Straight after a request from Ruthin Town Council. Eddie Knipe, a South African living in Sevenoaks, sought permission from Nella Pryce to approach the Ruthin Town Council to commemorate her late husband. Having gained her consent and that of Tom&#x27;s parents, a trust was established in 2006 under the chairmanship of David Richards to create a memorial to Tom Pryce in Ruthin. Neil Dalrymple, a local artist, was commissioned by Ruthin Town Council in 2008 to design an plaque and in February 2009, an auction of Formula One pit passes to fund its manufacture was announced. The memorial was unveiled on 11 June 2009, on what would have been Pryce&#x27;s 60th birthday.

<text>Rudolph Grey is a musician and the biographer of filmmaker Ed Wood.

As an electric guitarist, Grey has recorded and performed with Mars, with John Giorno in the opera &quot;Agamemon&quot; (1993), and under his own name. Grey has also as led and recorded with various ad hoc ensembles called The Blue Humans. His music draws on no wave and free jazz.

Grey is also a motion picture historian and has written &quot;Nightmare of Ecstasy&quot; (1992), a biography of Ed Wood, the director of notoriously awful cult films. Tim Burton&#x27;s film &quot;Ed Wood&quot; was based on Grey&#x27;s book.

In 2001, Grey rediscovered a copy of Ed Wood&#x27;s final feature-length film, &quot;Necromania&quot;, which had been presumed to be lost, in a Los Angeles warehouse.

In 2011, Grey produced a one-hour documentary called &quot;Dad Made Dirty Movies&quot;, about the life and career of 1960s porn film producer Stephen Apostolof, detailing his co-productions with filmmaker Ed Wood.

<text>Northern Bahr el Ghazal (Arabic: ولاية شمال بحر الغزال) is a state in South Sudan. It has an area of 30,543 km2 and is part of the Bahr el Ghazal region. It borders East Darfur in Sudan to the north, Western Bahr el Ghazal to the west and south, and Warrap and the disputed region of Abyei to the east. Aweil is the capital of the state.

==History==

Because of its proximity to Kordofan and the presence of a railway line through it to Wau, it suffered extensively in the 1983–2005 civil war in southern Sudan. North Bahr al Ghazal and adjacent parts of Western Kordofan to the north were among the most politically sensitive regions in Sudan. Missriya Arabs from Kordofan have interacted with Dinka in this region over a long time. While relations during the colonial era were largely peaceful, the war saw an upsurge in hostilities. Government backing to the Missriya gave them a decided advantage over local Dinka groups, and raiding by &quot;murahileen&quot; militias (and other government backed groups, including some Dinka militias) resulted in considerable loss of life, widespread abduction and pillaging of Dinka villages. Many of these raids coincided with the movement of government trains to and from Kordofan to Wau.

It had the highest rate of poverty, 76% according to government statistics, of the 10 states of South Sudan.

In October 2015, President Salva Kiir divided the original ten states of South Sudan into 28 states. Northern Bahr el Ghazal was divided into the new states of Aweil, Aweil East, and a part of Lol. 

On 22 January 2020, Northern Bahr el Ghazal, along with the rest of the original ten states of South Sudan, was re-established at the conclusion of a peace agreement resolving the South Sudanese Civil War. Tong Aken Ngor, appointed by President Kiir as Governor of Aweil State in 2019, was sworn in as the Governor of Northern Bahr el Ghazal in the wake of the state&#x27;s re-establishment.
==Geography==
Situated in South Sudan&#x27;s Bahr el Ghazal region, Northern Bahr el Ghazal occupies a majority of a region that is characterized by grassland floodplains and tropical savanna that make up around 33,559 km2, extending outward into neighboring Western Bahr el Ghazal and Warrap. Each county is divided into three geographical areas of different ground and water height. These areas are locally referred to as low-, middle-, or highlands - though there are actually no highlands in the state. The lowlands are only accessible during the dry season because annually, from May through November, the areas are flooded. Each county also has their own intermittent rivers that locals use for drinking water.

The Lol River, which crosses the state, is a tributary of the Bahr al-Arab, flowing downstream from Unity, slicing westward through Warrap and Northern Bahr el Ghazal, and ending in Western Bahr el Ghazal.

===Hazards===
Annual floods are common throughout Northern Bahr el Ghazal, affecting residential areas. In 2008, a flood in Aweil South County displaced 40,000 people. In 2010, a flood took out 70% of livestock and crops in Aweil South County and Aweil West County; in Aweil, around 60% was destroyed. Thousands of people were greatly affected by the flood in 2010.

==Government==
Retired Gen. Salva Chol Ayat was the last Acting governor of the state. He replaced Kuel Aguer Kuel in April 2015.The incumbent governor is Hon. Tong Aken Ngor.

===Administration===
Northern Bahr al Ghazal, like other states in South Sudan, is divided into counties; there are five counties, headed by a County Commissioner, as detailed below:

The counties are further divided into &quot;Payams&quot;, then &quot;Bomas&quot;.

==Infrastructure==
By 2009, accessibility of Northern Bahr al Ghazal had been greatly improved. In 2007, the reconstruction of roads and bridges began. All county headquarters across the state were connected by all-weather roads with the exception of Aroyo, then the capital of Aweil Center County. In 2019, the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations announced a project to develop multi-purpose water infrastructure in Koum. It is the lowest developed region of the entire globe according to the HDI.

<text>Karl Sims (born 1962) is a computer graphics artist and researcher, who is best known for using particle systems and artificial life in computer animation.

==Biography==
Sims received a B.S. in Life Sciences from MIT in 1984, and a M.S. in computer graphics from the MIT Media Lab in 1987. After receiving his master&#x27;s degree, Sims worked on special effects software at Whitney/Demos Productions and then was a co-founder of Optomystic. At Optomystic in 1989, Sims developed software for the Connection Machine 2 (CM-2) that animated the water from drawings of a deluge by Leonardo da Vinci, used in Mark Whitney&#x27;s film &quot;Excerpts from Leonardo&#x27;s Deluge&quot;. 

Sims was later artist-in-residence from 1990 to 1996 at the supercomputer manufacturer and artificial intelligence company Thinking Machines. In 1996, Sims founded and became CEO of GenArts, a Cambridge, Massachusetts company that developed special effects plugins used in film and video production. In 2008 he moved to a role on the board of directors when Insight Partners acquired a majority stake in the company.

Sims&#x27; animations &quot;Particle Dreams&quot; and &quot;Panspermia&quot; used the CM-2 to animate and render various complex phenomena via particle systems. &quot;Panspermia&quot; was also used as the video for Pantera&#x27;s 1994 cover of Black Sabbath&#x27;s &quot;Planet Caravan&quot;.

Sims wrote landmark papers on virtual creatures and artificial evolution for computer art. His virtual creatures used an artificial neural network to process input from virtual sensors and act on virtual muscles between cuboid &#x27;limbs&#x27;. The creatures were evolved to display multiple modes of water and land based movements such as swimming like a sea snake or fish, jumping and tumbling (walking was not achieved). The creatures were also co-evolved in different species to compete for possession of a virtual cube, displaying the red queen effect. The cover of Chris Langton&#x27;s 1995 book &quot;Artificial Life: An Overview&quot; uses an image of the creatures generated by Sims. 

In 1997, Sims created the interactive installation &quot;Galápagos&quot; for the NTT InterCommunication Center in Tokyo. In this installation, viewers help evolve 3D animated creatures by selecting which ones will be allowed to live and produce new, mutated offspring.

His paper &quot;Artificial Evolution for Computer Graphics&quot; described the application of genetic algorithms to generate abstract 2D images from complex mathematical formulae, evolved under the guidance of a human. He used this method to create the video &quot;Primordial Dance&quot; – which, according to one published study with supplementary video, calls to mind the history of early 20th century abstraction among its several evolutionary themes – as well as parts of &quot;Liquid Selves&quot;. &quot;Genetic Images&quot; was an interactive installation also based on this method; it was exhibited at the Centre Georges Pompidou in Paris, 1993, as well as Ars Electronica and the Los Angeles Interactive Media Festival.

Sims received an Emmy Award in 2019 for outstanding achievement in engineering development. In 1998, he was awarded a MacArthur Fellowship. He has won two Golden Nicas at Prix Ars Electronica, in 1991 and in 1992. He has also received honors from Imagina, the National Computer Graphics Association, the Berlin Video Festival, NICOGRAPH, Images du Futur, and other festivals.

He is married to MIT professor Pattie Maes.

<text>North Darfur State ( Wilāyat Šamāl Dārfūr; &quot;Shamal Darfor&quot;) is one of the wilayat or states of Sudan. It is one of the five states composing the Darfur region. It has an area of 296,420 km2 and an estimated population of approximately 2,304,950 in 2018. Al-Fashir is the capital of the state. Other significant towns include Ailliet, Kebkabiya, Kutum, Mellit (Malit), Tawilah and Umm Keddada (Umm Kadadah).

==History==
North Darfur shares much of the history of Darfur. It was the center of the Sultanate of Darfur and contained both its capital al-Fashir and its biggest trading city Kobbei.

Former lieutenant general, Armed Forces Chief of Staff, and defense minister Ibrahim Suleiman Hassan served as governor of North Darfur from 2001 to 2003, until being dismissed by al-Bashir.

North Darfur has been a major flashpoint during the ongoing civil war.

==Geography==
North Darfur occupies more than half of the territory of the Darfur region, and includes part of the Marrah Mountains (&quot;Jebel Marra&quot;). The northern part is entirely desert. To the south there is slightly more rainfall with the eastern side being plains with low sandy hills, while the volcanic Marrah Mountains occupy most of the western side of the south. In the southern portion the most important crops are millet, maize and peanuts.

North Darfur is bounded on the northwest by Libya, on the north by Northern State, on the east by Northern State and North Kurdufan, on the southeast by South Kurdufan, on the south by South Darfur, and on the west by West Darfur and the Republic of Chad. Most of North Darfur&#x27;s population follow Sunni Islam.

<text>North Kordofan () is one of the 18 wilayat or states of Sudan. It has an area of 185,302 km2 and an estimated population of 3,174,029 people (2018 est). El-Obeid is the capital of the state.

North Kordofan is generally arid and desert.

== History ==
For centuries, North Kordofan was inhabited by nomads and pastoralists, mainly the Dar Hamid, Dar Hamar, Guamaa, Kababish, Bideriya, Shwehat and including the Yazeed tribes. The area has had almost continuous drought since the mid-1960s. Deforestation led to the destruction of the natural vegetation. NGOs working in the villages of Sudan tried to rectify the damage. They set up women&#x27;s centres. These centres allowed many women gain an income. Training was introduced and a solar energy system set up. NGOs recognise that a need exists for longer projects requiring the kind of support that only can come from governments and large agencies.

The singer Hawa Al-Tagtaga was from the region.

<text>Eastern Equatoria is a state in South Sudan. It has an area of 73,472 km2. The capital City is Torit. On October 1, 1972, the state was divided into Imatong and Namorunyang states and was re-established by a peace agreement signed on 22 February 2020.

Louis Lobong Lojore is the current governor of Eastern Equatoria.

==Geography==

The state shares international borders with Uganda in the south, with Kenya in the south-east and with Ethiopia in the north-east. Domestically, it is bordered by Central Equatoria in the west and Jonglei in the north. The Ilemi Triangle in the east, between Eastern Equatoria and Lake Turkana, is or has been disputed among all three abutting states (South Sudan, Kenya and Ethiopia).

==Population==

The state had 906,126 people in 2008 (32/sq mi).
Eastern Equatoria state was home to several different ethnic groups. 
The Toposa, Jiye/Jie and Nyangathom live in the Kapeota counties in the east of the state. 
The Didinga, Dodoth and Boya live in Budi county around Chukudum. 
Further west, Lopa, Torit and Ikwoto counties are inhabited by the Ketebo, Otuho,Mokoyi Lopit, Lango, Pari, and Tenet people who inhabit a portion of the lopit hills after they split from Didinga and Murle early in the 19th century and Lokoya of Lowoi. 
The Acholi, Madi, Iwire and Ofiriha people live in the westernmost Magwi county.

Most of the inhabitants of Eastern Equatoria live by subsistence farming, and also raise cattle, sheep and goats. Some of the crops are sold, while most are consumed locally. The Didinga Hills in Budi county have rich and fertile soil that is used for cultivation of tobacco, potatoes, maize, and Dura.

==Government==

The executive head of the State was the Governor, who was elected. The Governor was appointing ministers, advisors, and the Executive Directors to the Counties. The Counties in turn, were ruled by the democratically elected Local Government Councils headed by the County Commissioner The state legislature was elected, with the first elections being held in April 2010.

==Administrative divisions==

Eastern Equatoria, like other states in South Sudan, was sub-divided into counties. These were further divided into Payams, then Bomas. Each county was headed by a County Commissioner, elected by the people of a County as the head of the local government in the County.

Counties were originally larger, but were subdivided in part to ensure that the different communities have full representation. Thus Torit County was subdivided into Torit, Lopa and Ikwotos counties, and Greater Kapoeta was divided into Budi County and Kapoeta county, which in turn was divided into Kapoeta North, South and East counties.

Counties as of 2020 were:

* Budi County
* Ikotos County
* Kapoeta East County
* Kapoeta North County
* Kapoeta South County
* Lafon County
* Magwi County
* Torit County

== Health ==
, this was one of the last areas in the world where cases of Guinea worm disease are found, with twelve of the 17 reported cases occurring &quot;in one small pocket of Eastern Equatoria State,&quot; according to NPR.

==Governors==
Eastern Equatoria is the most mountainous state in South Sudan. People entirely depend on agriculture and livestock keeping. Whenever there&#x27;s climate change, people in those areas are least likely to be affected.

<text>Peter Jeffrey Revlon Revson (February 27, 1939 – March 22, 1974) was an American racing driver, who competed in Formula One between and . Revson won two Formula One Grands Prix across five seasons.

Born and raised in New York, Revson was the nephew of Charles Revson and heir to cosmetics company Revlon. Revson won the Canadian-American Challenge Cup in 1971, and finished fifth overall in the World Drivers&#x27; Championship in and with McLaren. He was also runner-up to Al Unser in the 1971 Indianapolis 500.

Revson, along with Dan Gurney, was one of two drivers to win races in Formula One, IndyCar, Can-Am, and Trans-Am. His champagne-spraying celebrations in victory lane earned him the nickname &quot;Champagne Peter&quot;. Revson was inducted into the Motorsports Hall of Fame of America in 1996.

==Background==
Peter Revson was born in New York City, the son of Martin Revson and Julie (née Phelps) Hall. Martin had been a founding partner (along with his brother Charles Revson) of Revlon cosmetics, but had parted ways in 1958 and become chairman of Del Laboratories in 1963. His mother had been a nightclub singer at the time Martin met her.

Revson&#x27;s full name was Peter Jeffrey Revlon Revson, his middle name a nod to his family&#x27;s business. As a young man, newspaper articles commonly referred to him as Peter Revlon Revson.

A young, handsome bachelor described as a &quot;free spirit&quot;, Peter passed up an easy life for one of competition and danger, including driving in both the USAC Championship Car and Formula One circuits, piloting a ChrisCraft boat, and courting some of the most beautiful women in the world. At the time of his death, he was engaged to the recently dethroned 1973 Miss World, Marjorie Wallace.

==Early life and racing career==
Peter Revson spent his childhood in White Plains, New York, attending prep schools. He had two sisters, Jennifer and Julie Ann, as well as a younger brother Doug, who was killed in a race in Denmark in 1967. Revson never finished his college education after attending Columbia University, Cornell University, and the University of Hawaii. In 1960, while attending the University of Hawaii, he bought a Morgan and entered into sports car racing. In his first race, Revson placed second, then won his next race. His family withdrew their financial aid when he turned his attention to competitive racing full time, relying instead on his savings and education funds. Teaming with Cornell classmate Timmy Mayer and friend Bill Smith, and managed by Teddy Mayer under the Rev-Em Racing banner, Revson competed in Formula Junior in 1962.

In 1963, after limited successes and with Formula One (F1) aspirations, Revson took the remaining money he had, around (), and moved to the United Kingdom. There he was able to buy a Formula Junior Cooper T56 and a Ford Thames van. He then began barnstorming around mainland Europe competing and winning against the likes of future F1 stars Denny Hulme and Jochen Rindt. Revson caught the attention of Reg Parnell, from whom Revson rented workshop space, and was offered a spot on Parnell&#x27;s planned F1 team for the season. Revson made his F1 debut at a 1963 exhibition race at the Gold Cup in Oulton Park, England, finishing ninth. In 1964, Revson teamed with fellow Reg Parnell Racing drivers Chris Amon and Mike Hailwood, referred to as the Ditton Road Flyers, who received more attention due to their antics and wild parties than their performances on the track. Revson also raced that year, closely associated with Reg Parnell Racing, under his own Revson Racing banner. Both teams were uncompetitive due to a number of factors, including the sudden death of Reg Parnell, financial troubles, and the poor performance of the Lotus 24 car. Revson raced in four of the ten F1 World Championship races that season, completing only two; his best finish was 13th at the 1964 Italian Grand Prix. He also competed in five non-championship races that season, where his best finish was a fourth place at the 1964 Solitude Grand Prix, in West Germany.

Revson accepted an offer to race in the United States in 1965. Focusing mainly on sports car racing, including the Can-Am and Trans-Am Series, he was able to build his reputation as a capable driver. He also competed in American open-wheel car racing, including the top level USAC Championship Car series. In that series, he qualified for the 33rd and final starting position at the 1969 Indianapolis 500; despite completing only 197 of the 200 laps, he finished in 5th place in an underpowered Brabham BT25. He returned to the Indianapolis Raceway Park track later in the 1969 USAC Championship Car season, where he finished third in leg one of the Indianapolis 200, followed by his first Champ Car win in the second leg. His 1969 success at Indianapolis Raceway Park earned him an invitation to race for the McLaren team at the 1970 Indianapolis 500, after his friend Chris Amon was dropped by the team for failing to qualify; Revson qualified 16th, but retired from the race due to mechanical reasons after 87 laps. That same year, while teamed in a Porsche 908/02 with Steve McQueen, the duo finished second overall in the 12 hours of Sebring, and first overall in the 3-liter class, just a few seconds behind the 5-liter Ferrari 512 driven by a trio led by Mario Andretti. McQueen received credit for driving with a broken foot, which also meant that Revson drove the bulk of the race. Revson also the finished the 1970 Can-Am season in 8th, driving a Lola T220 for Carl Haas Racing.

The 1971 racing season was a major breakthrough in Revson&#x27;s career. Driving at the 1971 Indianapolis 500 for McLaren Racing, he qualified in the pole position in a McLaren M16, and finished the race in second place. As a member of the McLaren Racing team in the 1971 Can-Am season, Revson drove his McLaren M8F to five wins and three other podium finishes in the 10-race season, winning the championship. His success earned him an invitation to race in Formula One, at the season ending 1971 United States Grand Prix, for the Tyrrell Racing team; he started 19th, but retired after one lap due to mechanical issues with his Tyrrell 003-Ford Cosworth DFV.

His success in 1971 earned Revson an offer from the McLaren Formula One team for 1972, headed by his long-time friend Teddy Mayer. Revson entered the 1972 season as a driver for McLaren&#x27;s Indy Car, Can-Am, and Formula One teams.

His champagne-spraying celebrations in victory lane earned him the nickname &quot;Champagne Peter&quot;.

==Formula One career==

During the F1 season, Revson finished 5th in the Driver&#x27;s World Championship, helping McLaren finish 3rd in the World Constructors&#x27; Champion Championship with its McLaren M19A / M19C. Running 9 out of the 12 races, Revson finished on the podium four times with three third-place finishes and a season-best second-place finish at the 1972 Canadian Grand Prix.

As part of his contract with McLaren, Revson was required to drive a McLaren Indy team entry in the Indy Car Triple Crown of 500 mile races for the 1972 USAC Championship Car season. At the 1972 Indianapolis 500, he started from 10th on the grid, but retired due to mechanical issues after 23 laps. He also retired due to mechanical issues, after 7 laps, at the Pocono 500 and finished 23rd at the California 500.

During the F1 season, Revson won two races in his McLaren M23, the 1973 British Grand Prix and the 1973 Canadian Grand Prix. He added two other podium finishes, with a third place and a second-place finish, helping McLaren finish 3rd in the World Constructors&#x27; Champion Championship. Despite Revson&#x27;s successes, Teddy Mayer was not satisfied and McLaren opted for the 1972 champion and 1973 runner-up Emerson Fittipaldi.

Revson again drove a McLaren Indy team entry in the Indy Car Triple Crown for the 1973 USAC Championship Car season. At the 1973 Indianapolis 500, he qualified to start from second on the grid, but retired after brushing the wall on the third lap. He qualified in the pole position for both the 1973 Pocono 500 and the 1973 California 500, finishing 21st and 23rd, respectively.

For the F1 season, Revson signed with the one-year-old Shadow Racing Cars F1 team. Driving the team&#x27;s new Shadow DN3, Revson retired from the first race after an accident in the second lap, and retired from the second race due to overheating of his Ford Cosworth DFV engine after 10 laps.

==Death==
Revson was killed during a test session on 22 March 1974, before the 1974 South African Grand Prix in Kyalami. His Shadow DN3 suffered a front suspension failure and crashed heavily into the Armco barrier on the outside of &quot;Barbecue Bend&quot;. The car stood on its nose, wrapped itself around the barrier and caught fire, and although safety workers and other drivers managed to pull Revson from the wreckage, he was already dead.

Tony Southgate, designer of the DN3, in a 2012 interview with &quot;Motor Sport&quot;, said:
He was the second Revson to lose his life racing; his brother Douglas was killed in a crash in Denmark in 1967. Peter and Douglas Revson are interred together in a crypt in the community mausoleum at Ferncliff Cemetery in Hartsdale, New York. Revson&#x27;s autobiography, &quot;Speed with Style&quot;, co-written with Leon Mandel, was published posthumously by Doubleday &amp; Company in 1974.

Revson was replaced by Tom Pryce, who died three years later at the same Grand Prix.

==Awards==
Revson was inducted into the Motorsports Hall of Fame of America in 1996 in the sports car category.

<text>Walter Schwimmer (born 16 June 1942) is a former politician and diplomat from Austria. Was Secretary General of the Council of Europe from September 1, 1999, to August 31, 2004.

==Life==
After being a member of the Austrian Parliament (National Council) for 28 years, serving as chairperson of several committees (Justice, Health, Housing and Construction) and deputy leader of his political group (ÖVP – Austrian People&#x27;s Party), he was elected Secretary General of the Council of Europe.

Schwimmer held this post from September 1, 1999, until September 1, 2004. At the beginning of his term, &quot;The Economist&quot; accused him of being a &quot;timid moral policeman&quot; over his treatment of the Chechen–Russian conflict.
In June 2004 his attempt to be elected to a second five-year term as secretary general failed, like all his predecessors of whom no one was reelected.

Schwimmer currently works as a consultant on international relations and European affairs, based in Klosterneuburg near Vienna.

Schwimmer is (honorary) Secretary General of the Maison de la Méditerranée/Fondazione Mediterraneo (Naples) and Chairman of the International Coordination Committee of the World Public Forum - Dialogue of Civilisations, a Russian vehicle.

On April 15, 2010, he became president of Megatrend University, the largest private university in Serbia. He resigned from this position in January 2013.

==Political views==

In a 2015 with &quot;Russia Direct&quot; he emphasized that the Euromaidan &quot;was originally a civil society movement against corruption and had nothing to do with pro-European or anti-Russian choice. However, it was seen by Russia as a coup d&#x27;état and by the EU as a kind of strategic decision of Ukraine to go not with Russia but with Europe, which Schwimmer dismissed as a &quot;misinterpretation&quot; and &quot;nonsense.&quot; In the same interview he blames poor European communication for the Russian military getting &quot;concerned about the possibility of losing the naval base in Sevastopol.&quot; Not giving Russia a guarantee to keep the naval base in Sevastopol was a mistake, according to Schwimmer: &quot;now Russia and the EU are trapped. Russia will not retreat from Crimea and the EU cannot acknowledge its annexation, since it was against international law. And now Russia and the EU are trapped in this escalation of sanctions that are leading to nothing.&quot;

<doc id="767690" wikidata="Q7203" url="?curid=767690" title="Ziying of Qin">
<text>Ying Ziying, also known as Ziying, King of Qin (, died January 206 BC), was the third and last ruler of the Qin dynasty of China. He ruled over a fragmented Qin Empire for 46 days, from mid-October to early December 207 BC. Unlike his predecessor, he ruled as a king instead of emperor. He is referred to in some sources with the posthumous name Emperor Shang of Qin () although the Qin dynasty had abolished the tradition of according posthumous names to deceased monarchs.

==Identity==




There is no firm consensus as to what Ziying&#x27;s relationship to the Qin royal family really was.

He is mentioned in historical records as either:
#A son of Qin Er Shi&#x27;s elder brother (who, according to Yan Shigu&#x27;s commentaries, was Fusu);
#An elder brother of Qin Er Shi;
#A younger brother of Qin Shi Huang; or
#A son of a younger brother of Qin Shi Huang.

While Sima Qian&#x27;s &quot;Records of the Grand Historian&quot; does not specify Ziying&#x27;s age, it implies that he had at least two sons, whom he consulted.

===Being Qin Er Shi&#x27;s nephew===
According to the analysis of historian Wang Liqun, the maximum possible age of Ziying when Zhao Gao assassinated Qin Er Shi was 19. Therefore, his sons would have probably been around the ages of 1–2 and so it was not possible for him to consult them.

For Ziying&#x27;s sons to be old enough to be consulted, a traditional age for them would have been around 14–16. Since they were 14–16 in 207 BC, when their supposed great-grandfather (i.e. three generations apart from them) Qin Shi Huang (born 259 BC), if he had been alive, that he could have been only 52 is highly improbable.

It seems unlikely that Ziying was either Fusu&#x27;s son or any other grandson of Qin Shi Huang.

===Being Qin Er Shi&#x27;s brother===
Ziying being another elder brother of Huhai (Qin Er Shi) is as unlikely as a grandson of Qin Shi Huang. Since Huhai showed no restraint at killing at least 20 of his siblings after ascending to the throne, sparing one elder brother is possible but rather incredible.

===Being Qin Shi Huang&#x27;s brother===
Li Kaiyuan in his study stated that Qin Shi Huang only had three brothers of any kinds: one paternal half-brother (Chengjiao) and two maternal half-brothers (sons of Lao Ai), therefore Ziying, if indeed being another brother of his, would have had more mentions in Chengjiao&#x27;s supposed betrayal.

===Being Qin Shi Huang&#x27;s nephew===
Ziying being Zhao Chengjiao&#x27;s son bore no threat to Huhai&#x27;s reign and was neither one of Qin Shi Huang&#x27;s direct descendants nor in a higher position in the succession to Huhai. Ziying was also said to have tried to persuade Huhai not to kill Qin Shi Huang&#x27;s other sons and daughters, which could have been a difficult task if he was among them.

==Life==
After Qin Er Shi&#x27;s death, Zhao Gao chose Ziying to be successor and changed the ruling title &quot;emperor&quot; back to &quot;king&quot; because the Qin dynasty then was as weak as the former Qin State, which no longer ruled the whole of China but held onto only Guanzhong.

Ziying was the only person in the Qin imperial court to defend and to try to persuade Qin Er Shi against the wrongful executions of Meng Tian and Meng Yi. He lured Zhao Gao, the regent who had assassinated Qin Er Shi, into a trap and killed him. Ziying later surrendered to Liu Bang, the leader of the first group of rebel forces to occupy Xianyang, the Qin capital. He was eventually killed, along with his male family members, by another rebel leader, Xiang Yu.

==Legacy==
Ziying sometimes appears as a door god in Chinese and Taoist temples, usually paired with his successor, Emperor Yi of Chu.

According to the assessment by Han dynasty historian Jia Yi (200–169 BCE), Ziying of Qin was a mediocre sovereign. Historian Ban Gu (AD 32–92) disagreed; he believed Ziying of Qin enthroned the dynasty under its last lag, and he achieved everything he could by assassinating Zhao Gao, the conspiring eunuch that caused the political chaos in the first place, and surrendered the kingdom to the rebel forces, preventing further loss of life and dignity.

<text>Richard Westall (2 January 1765 – 4 December 1836) was an English painter and illustrator of portraits, historical and literary events, best known for his portraits of Byron. He was also Queen Victoria&#x27;s drawing master.

==Biography==

Westall was the more successful of two half-brothers (both sons of a Benjamin Westall, from Norwich) who both became painters. His younger half-brother was William Westall (1781–1850), a much-travelled landscape painter.

Born on 2 January 1765 in Reepham near Norwich (where he was baptised at All Saints on 13 January in the same year), Richard Westall moved to London after the death of his mother and the bankruptcy of his father in 1772. Westall was apprenticed to a heraldic silver engraver in 1779, where he was encouraged to become a painter by John Alefounder; he then began studying at the Royal Academy School of Arts from 10 December 1785. He exhibited at the Academy regularly between 1784 and 1836, became an Associate in November 1792 and was elected an Academician on 10 February 1794. From 1790 to 1795 he shared a house with Thomas Lawrence (later Sir), the future Royal Academy president, at 57 Greek Street, on the corner of Soho Square, each of the artists placing their name on one of the entrances.

==Works==
His works – many in watercolour – caused great interest in the late years of the 18th century when he was considered by his chief patron Richard Payne Knight to be an outstanding artist of the picturesque. He painted works in a neoclassical style for John Boydell&#x27;s Shakespeare Gallery and for Henry Fuseli&#x27;s Milton Gallery. His painting of John Milton and his daughters hangs in Sir John Soane&#x27;s Museum in London. A number of scenes in which Westall depicts events in the life of Horatio Nelson are at the National Maritime Museum.

Westall was a prolific book illustrator of both fiction and poetry, including the works of Sir Walter Scott, Oliver Goldsmith, William Cowper and Thomas Gray. Byron, who greatly admired his work, stated that &quot;the brush has beat the poetry&quot;. Westall was commissioned to provide illustrations to John Boydell&#x27;s editions of Shakespeare and John Milton. He also illustrated editions of the Bible, including one with John Martin. His oil painting &quot;Christ Crowned with Thorns&quot; is the altarpiece at All Souls Church, Langham Place, London.

His portraiture, in a style similar to Lawrence&#x27;s, included Princess Victoria (later Queen Victoria, for whom he was art teacher for eight years before his death on 4 December 1836), and Richard Ayton, a writer who collaborated with landscape artist William Daniell (Westall&#x27;s brother-in-law).

Richard Westall is perhaps best known for several portraits of Lord Byron. One of these hangs in the National Portrait Gallery in London, another at Hughenden Manor, and a third in the House of Lords.

<doc id="767697" wikidata="Q2819321" url="?curid=767697" title="APB (1987 video game)">
<text>APB (short for &quot;All Points Bulletin&quot;) is a video game released in arcades by Atari Games in 1987. The player assumes the role of &quot;Officer Bob,&quot; a rookie police officer. As Bob, players drive around the city, ticketing motorists for minor infractions and pulling over more serious offenders. Eventually, players must apprehend criminals for which an all-points bulletin has been called.

The arcade cabinet looks like a police car, with a gas pedal, steering wheel and a siren button, complete with flashing lights atop the unit. The game&#x27;s cartoonish visuals and sense of humor gained it positive reviews. The game was slightly criticized for its difficulty; the game&#x27;s developers later admitted that a long development cycle had resulted in the gameplay growing more complicated than originally planned.

Ports of &quot;APB&quot; were released for the Amiga, Atari ST, Commodore 64, Amstrad CPC and ZX Spectrum in 1989. The home versions were mostly developed by Tengen and published by Domark. A version for the Atari Lynx handheld was published later, in 1991.

==Gameplay==

The object of the game is to meet (or exceed) the daily quota of citing or arresting various types of law-breakers within a time limit for the day. The player is given an overhead view of Officer Bob&#x27;s patrol car, number 54. The player controls the car with a gas pedal and a steering wheel. Bonuses are awarded for a &quot;perfect day&quot; and each arrest over the quota. Picking up donuts extends the day&#x27;s time limit. Driving through filling stations refuels the patrol car. Driving through the &quot;Speed Shop&quot; garage daily upgrades the patrol car with brakes, guns, armor, radar, etc.

The first day of the game is where the player must drive on a closed course and use his siren on marked traffic cones. From the second day onwards, the player will ticket common misdemeanor infractions (such as littering) by pulling up behind them, pushing the siren button and having them pull over. Certain offenders require more siren taps to be pulled over. Specific offenses are tied directly to distinctive vehicles (e.g., only the pink convertibles toss litter, and that is the only offense they will commit.) The exception to this is speeding, eventually introduced into the game, which can be perpetrated by any vehicle. Soon new petty lawbreakers are introduced, to include road rage, drunk driving, dopers, et cetera.

The game also gives the player the task of arresting fugitive felons. Every other day, starting on the third day, the player can go after an A.P.B. (&quot;All Points Bulletin&quot;). The stage will start with a scene of multiple officers seen in silhouette where the Chief is showing a mugshot of a suspect wanted for a major crime, the vehicle to be on the lookout for, along with the words &quot;Get this crook today&quot;. Examples of major crimes can be expected such as selling narcotics, prostitution, terrorism, or arson, or less commonplace, such as one day where a truck full of nuclear fuel was stolen, and Officer Bob is ordered to recover it. 

When a fugitive is caught and returned to the station, the player must violently shake the suspect to get a confession before the Chief enters the room. This is done by filling the &quot;Confess-O-Meter&quot; by tapping alternatively on the &quot;fire&quot; and &quot;siren&quot; buttons. The A.P.B. suspects are named, often in a manner according to their offense: &quot;Bernie Gasman&quot; (wanted for arson), &quot;Cool Hand Duke&quot; (wanted for pimping), &quot;Buzz Geiger&quot; (wanted for nuclear fuel theft). Should Officer Bob get an APB suspect to the station and force him or her to confess, a screen of &quot;Bob&#x27;s Top 10&quot; will be shown where the convict is then put behind bars and a brief musical tone akin to &quot;Dragnet&quot; is played. In the event the Chief enters the room and sees Bob shaking the suspect, the suspect is let go due to police brutality, and the player is penalized with a demerit, plus one additional demerit for each item on the quota that was not accumulated.

After Day 16, no other petty violators are introduced. The daily quota will be a combination of those above. Other petty violators seen in the game but not formally introduced are hitchhikers and distressed motorists, seen by a man working on a car at a road shoulder and his wife saying &quot;Help!&quot; in which Officer Bob will give them a $75 ticket for his time and aid.

The game&#x27;s life gauge of sorts is a demerit meter. The game ends when this meter is maxed out. When the demerit limit is reached, the message &quot;TOO MANY DEMERITS. YOU ARE FIRED.&quot; is displayed, along with Officer Bob being dragged from the car, handcuffed, and thrown either into the back of a paddy wagon or into a garbage can. Demerits are accumulated for colliding with cones and other vehicles with the siren off, shooting non-offender vehicles, running into doughnut huts and pedestrians, running out of gas (if the quota is met), and failing to get a confession from an A.P.B. Also, demerits come from the player&#x27;s car exploding through getting hit with dynamite, high-speed collisions with trains and other obstacles, and attempting to jump construction pits at too low a speed. Attaining a certain score, having a demerit-free day, or on rare occasions, finding a money bag with a prize inside, reading &quot;DEMERIT ERASED&quot;, will forgive one demerit.

Failure to meet the quota when time expired will have one of four comical scenes, where Officer Bob is dressed down by the Chief for substandard performance, either getting scorched by &quot;dragon breath&quot;, strangled by the Chief tugging on Bob&#x27;s collar, having his nose honked, or having his patrolman&#x27;s hat draped over his eyes. In addition, the player will be also be given one demerit multiplied by every unticketed infraction. Should this happen on an A.P.B. day but the player successfully apprehended the most wanted suspect, Officer Bob is excused from the quota. Should the player meet the quota, he will then get a radio message &quot;Car 54, return to station&quot;, and the player must drive back to the starting point or another police station which has parked squad cars and a space marked &quot;Reserved for Officer Bob&quot;. In this case, it will show a pleasant Chief remarking &quot;Nice work&quot; to Officer Bob.

The game cabinet is generally a standard upright. The main controls consist of a steering wheel, a siren button, a &quot;fire&quot; button for the gun and an accelerator pedal. The cabinet has two lights on top, red and blue, which flash when the player presses the siren button. Units feature a detachable seat which can be used to convert the cabinet into a sit-down game.

==Development==
According to members of the team that worked on the game, &quot;APB&quot; had an extended development process. Throughout the lengthy development, new gameplay ideas such as the in-game shops were continually added. The developers admitted that as a result, the final game may have been overly complex.

==Reception==

The game enjoyed moderate success in the marketplace. Its high-resolution graphics and novel cabinet design, with the flashing lights atop, added to its initial appeal. The game was noted for its increasing difficulty, with &quot;The Games Machine&quot; calling it at times &quot;utterly frustrating.&quot; However, the game&#x27;s cartoonish graphics and sound along with its humor were well-received, with &quot;Your Sinclair&quot; calling it &quot;one of the funniest games of the year&quot; and &quot;Computer and Video Games&quot; calling it &quot;hilarious.&quot; The unique gameplay was also lauded; The Games Machine called it &quot;like a breath of fresh air.&quot; and &quot;Crash&quot; said the game was &quot;refreshingly different from the usual mass of bash-or-blast&#x27;em ups&quot;

In a retrospective review for Allgame, Paul Biondich wrote that the gameplay &quot;stood the test of time&quot; and that the arcade cabinet&#x27;s unique design set the game apart in arcades. He also wrote that ten years after its release, the game was still graphically impressive. In addition, he complimented the game&#x27;s depth, difficulty curve and replay value.

===Atari Lynx===
The Atari Lynx version was reviewed by CVG Magazine in their August 1991 issue giving the game a score of 88 out of 100. Robert A. Jung also reviewed the game on the Lynx calling it &quot;decent adaptation of the original game&quot; and that &quot;The gameplay is fair, and is enhanced by some very appropriate and entertaining sound and graphics.&quot; Giving a rating of 8.5 out of 10. Raze Magazine also reviewed the game in their September 1991 issue. Julian Boardman liked the colourful cartoony graphics, sounds and found the game funny, but after a while irritating. He also found the game quite tricky to master and gave a score of 83%.

==Legacy==
The game came to the GameCube, PlayStation 2 and Xbox as part of &quot;Midway Arcade Treasures 2&quot; and to Microsoft Windows as part of &quot;Midway Arcade Treasures Deluxe Edition&quot;. It was released again as part of the compilation &quot;Midway Arcade Origins&quot; in 2012.

<doc id="767719" wikidata="Q5297133" url="?curid=767719" title="Doomtown">
<text>Doomtown (originally &quot;Deadlands: Doomtown&quot;, later rereleased as &quot;Doomtown: Reloaded&quot;) is an expandable card game based on the &quot;Deadlands&quot; role-playing game. It was originally a collectible card game (&quot;Deadlands: Doomtown&quot;) that ran from 1998 through 2001, published by Wizards of the Coast (WotC) under license to Pinnacle Entertainment Group until January 2000, when WotC quit production and the license transferred to Alderac Entertainment Group; its last expansion for many years was &quot;Do unto Others&quot; from 2001. In 2014 the game was revived (as &quot;Doomtown: Reloaded&quot;) with updated rules and sold in non-randomized expansions. 

During the game, each player builds locations in the town and fights for overall control. Doomtown sets itself apart from other card games in that each card doubles as a playing card, which impacts both deck building and gameplay. Players resolve certain in-game situations (such as combat) with a hand of poker, accentuating the Old West atmosphere of the game. The game&#x27;s movement rules are also noteworthy, often being compared to chess.

Doomtown is also a heavily story-driven game, with many tie-ins to the events of &quot;Deadlands&quot; at-large. In both its iterations, players are given opportunities to affect the story line, such as through tournaments where players vote on characters getting to live or die.

==Setting and story==
=== &quot;Deadlands&quot; ===
&quot;Deadlands&quot; is a role-playing system set in the fictional Weird West, an alternative history blending elements of the American wild west, horror, and steampunk. The game is largely set between 1876 and 1879.

In 1863, a vengeful Sioux shaman known as Raven conducted a ritual known as the Reckoning, which weakened the border with the spiritual realm, unleashing terrible creatures, spirits, and undead. In addition, many people became able to harness various forms of magic, both demonic and holy. The Reckoning also caused most of California&#x27;s coast to sink, leaving plateaus jutting from the ocean (a locale known as the Great Maze).

Around the same time, a new super-fuel known as ghost rock was discovered, which spurred the equivalent of a gold rush to the Great Maze, as well as a leap forward into an era of steampunk technology.

Also differentiating the setting from history, the American Civil War is still ongoing through 1879, with both the Union and Confederacy pushing westward. There are also various other sovereign powers, such as the Sioux Nation, Coyote Confederation, Nation of Deseret, and City of Lost Angels.

=== Deadlands: Doomtown ===
In its original printing run (1998–2001), Doomtown was set in Gomorra, a boomtown on the edge of the Great Maze. Due to a preponderance of ghost rock in its vicinity, various factions fight for control of the town.

As the town grew and factions arrived, the conflict between the peacekeeping Law Dogs and an outlaw gang called the Blackjacks escalated toward a climactic shootout at high noon. The violence rocked the town, but greater conflict brewed in the background.

The second story arc focuses on the Whateley family and the Flock. Despite attempts by Confederacy and Union agents to stop them, the Flock and Whateleys succeed in using a mother lode of ghost rock in the middle of town to summon a demon from Hell. The demon destroys much of the town but is defeated along with the Flock. Surviving factions race to build rail lines and control Gomorra&#x27;s ghost rock reserves. The leader of the Flock returns with the backing of Lost Angels, and uses a ritual to cause a catastrophe known as the Storm, razing the town and killing almost all of its residents.

==== Factions ====

* Blackjacks: A local outlaw gang, constantly robbing the town and populace. Their founder, Blackjack, holds a grudge against the Sweetrock Mining Company.
* Law Dogs: The law of the town, they pursue fugitives and dispense justice.
* Collegium: Mad scientists and researchers who use ghost rock to power their gadgets.
* Sweetrock Mining Company: Corporation headquartered back East, who use extensive capital and aggressive tactics to control the mines.
* Whateleys: A notorious family of hucksters involved in witchcraft, demonology, and hexes. They are rumored to breed with abominations.
* Sioux Union: A nation formed by Native American tribes, with a local representation of warriors and shamans working to expel evil from Gomorra.
* Maze Rats: A band of pirates loyal to Chinese forces out of Shan Fan (i.e. San Francisco) that raid the local mines.
* Texas Rangers: Agents of the Confederacy, charged with a policy to &quot;shoot or recruit&quot; supernatural forces.
* The Agency: Agents of the Union, these &quot;men in black&quot; are tasked with eradicating abominations and evil.
* The Flock: A cult in Gomorra that employs holy magic, and has a different member personifying each of the deadly sins.

=== Doomtown: Reloaded (AEG era) ===
The Reloaded iteration of Doomtown, published initially by Alderac Entertainment Group (AEG), picks up in Gomorra about a year after the events of the Storm. There was enough remaining ghost rock to encourage rebuilding Gomorra, aided by the rail lines.

An escalating conflict builds between the Law Dogs and the Sloane Gang of outlaws, culminating in a high noon shootout and a dead sheriff. A mysterious illness sweeps through town, and the secretive Fourth Ring circus open a sanitarium for relief efforts, while the Morgan Cattle Company use &#x27;mad science&#x27; in search for a cure. The Fourth Ring are revealed to be turning the townsfolk into zombies. They unleash this horde on Gomorra, but are thwarted by the combined efforts of the other factions. Under new leadership, the Sloane Gang take over and force the Law Dogs into exile.

==== Factions ====

* Law Dogs: The law and order of the town, representing the sheriff&#x27;s office (including mad scientists working to develop an advanced arsenal) and various religious figures with access to holy magic.
* Sloane Gang: A violent gang of outlaws that threaten the town. They use unholy magic in service of their crimes.
* Morgan Cattle Company: A ranching powerhouse which has branched out into mining and mad science.
* The Fourth Ring: A mysterious circus which is actually an association of abominations and unholy spellcasters working on behalf of the Reckoner known as Pestilence.
* Eagle Wardens: An independent organization spearheaded by people from various Native Americans tribes, who use shamanic magic to thwart evil.
* 108 Righteous Bandits: A loose gang of outlaws, transients, kung fu disciples, East Asian immigrants, and religious figures. They steal from the rich on behalf of the exploited masses.

=== Doomtown: Reloaded (PBE era) ===
Picking up in the immediate aftermath of the AEG era of publication, Pine Box Entertainment (PBE) broadened the story&#x27;s horizons to encompass the wider world of &quot;Deadlands&quot;. It follows various characters fleeing Gomorra in the aftermath of the town&#x27;s destruction by the Fourth Ring and the Sloane Gang.

The exiles run into nefarious villains such as the Servitors, representatives of the four Reckoners (known by some as the Four Horsemen), and become involved in the gunfight at the O.K. Corral.

==== Factions ====
When the game transitioned from AEG to Pine Box, all cards remained legal, so the factions remained the same mechanically. However, the factions were realigned thematically to account for the wider setting the game now covered, and were given the new names seen below. The more specific factions from the AEG era became considered aspects of the broader factions.

* Anarchists (formerly the 108 Righteous Bandits) 
* Entrepreneurs (formerly Morgan Cattle Company)
* Fearmongers (formerly The Fourth Ring)
* First Peoples (formerly the Eagle Wardens)
* Law Dogs (now encompassing more than Gomorra&#x27;s law)
* Outlaws (formerly the Sloane Gang)

==Release history==

=== Deadlands: Doomtown (1998 to 2001) ===
During the game&#x27;s initial development, Doomtown was advertised as &quot;Doomtown: The Legend of Caine County&quot;. It was being developed by Five Rings Publishing (FRP), which was acquired by Wizards of the Coast (WotC) as part of the TSR buyout. WotC thus acquired Doomtown and released the game&#x27;s first set.

The game was an instant success: Doomtown won the 1998 Origins Awards for Best Trading Card Game and Best Graphic Presentation of a Card Game. WotC produced the initial run of &#x27;episodes&#x27; (a series of smaller expansions under the FRP&#x27;s Rolling Thunder distribution model of frequent small expansions), the Pine Box Edition (a more traditional base set as the game transitioned to a more typical collectible card game release model), Shootout at High Noon (a set of two fixed decks to pick up and play), and the next three expansions.

When WotC&#x27;s contract with Pinnacle Entertainment Group (the owner of the &quot;Deadlands&quot; property) ended in 1999, they chose not to renew. Alderac Entertainment Group then acquired the rights to publish Doomtown from Pinnacle, and released a new base set, Boot Hill Edition, in 2000. This was followed by three traditional expansions and a final box set of fixed cards as the final expansion upon the game&#x27;s cancellation. That last expansion was &quot;Do unto Others&quot; from 2001. 

==== Timeline ====
=== Doomtown: Reloaded (AEG era, 2014 to 2016) ===
After the final set of Doomtown classic, fans kept the game alive by holding their own tournaments and making fan content. Eventually, via a flier from the 2014 GAMA Trade Show, it was revealed that Doomtown: Reloaded would be released by AEG in 2014, with updated rules and sold in non-randomized expansions as an expandable card game. The base set was released at GenCon 2014, where the inaugural tournament was held.

After the initial base set of 145 cards, expansions fell into one of three size categories: Pine Boxes (40–42 cards), Saddlebags (21–23 cards), or Faction Pack (42 cards). From 2014 to 2016, AEG released these expansions on a regular schedule of three Saddlebags followed by a Pine Box. In 2015, they inserted an extra release into the schedule, the Faction Pack &quot;Immovable Object, Unstoppable Force&quot;, which introduced the 108 Righteous Bandits and Eagle Wardens as factions (the other four factions had all been introduced in the base set).

Throughout its run, AEG also released Organized Play kits which stores could order to offer as prize support in tournaments, containing various knickknacks such as playmats, and alternate art promos of various cards. In 2016, AEG announced that they would no longer be producing new content for the game and halting tournament support.

==== Timeline ====
=== Doomtown: Reloaded (PBE era, 2017 to present) ===
In early 2017, the newly formed company Pine Box Entertainment (staffed by fans of Doomtown) announced that they had contracted with Pinnacle Entertainment Group to produce new expansions for Doomtown and continue organized play. As part of this partnership, Pine Box would work with PEG to bring more elements from the &quot;Deadlands&quot; RPG into the game.

In September 2017, PBE and PEG launched the Kickstarter for the first expansion in this new era, &quot;There Comes a Reckoning&quot;. It successfully funded in 10 minutes, and raised over $170,000 in total. After fulfillment of that expansion and its stretch goals in 2018, the game returned to traditional releases through Pinnacle with &quot;Too Tough to Die&quot; that autumn . The third expansion by Pine Box (&quot;Out for Blood&quot;) was released in the third quarter of 2019.

==== Timeline ====
== Gameplay ==

Doomtown, like most collectible card games, has two places where a player can show their skill and creativity: deck construction and playing skill.

===Terms===
The game uses the terms below to define the game mechanics. Some of these terms are printed on certain cards, while others are produced or mentioned in the game during play.
*Ghost Rock (GR): The money of the game. Used to buy or pay upkeep on items, dudes, etc.
*Production and Upkeep: Production gives a specified number of GR per turn, while upkeep costs a specified number of GR per turn to keep the card in question.
*Influence: A characteristic of some Dudes, it shows how much the town populace knows, fears or respects them, and is used to prevent another player from winning and controlling deeds.
*Control: A characteristic of some Deeds, which shows how important the structure is to the town, and is used to win the game.
*Victory Points: Like control, but it is won in game and cannot be taken away.
*Bullets: The combat prowess of a Dude. The higher it is, the more cards you can use to make a poker hand. There are two types of bullets, Draw and Stud (affecting the hand similarly to draw and stud poker).
*Outfit: The faction a dude belongs to. Dudes that belong to no specific outfit are called Drifters.
*Pull: Drawing the top card of your (or sometimes an opponent&#x27;s) Deck. This is used to determine if Spells or Gadgets are successful, or other game effects.
*Draw Hand: A hand of poker.
*Shootout: The combat phase of the game.
*Cheatin&#x27;: A Draw hand that has two or more cards with the same rank and suit (such as two aces of spades), not counting jokers. These hands are &quot;illegal&quot; and may be punished by Cheatin&#x27;! action cards.
*Boot: When a card is used, it is usually booted (turned sideways) to indicate this.
*Fear Level: This changed with each expansion as storyline progressed. The higher this is, the nastier the town has become.
*Boot Hill: The graveyard of the game&#x27;s cards. In contrast to the discard pile, the Boot Hill isn&#x27;t reshuffled into the deck when the deck becomes depleted.

===Deck construction===

There are eight types of cards in Doomtown: Actions, Dudes, Goods, Events, Deeds, Spells, Improvements, and Jokers. Each of those cards uses a specific Playing card suit: spades (Dudes), clubs (Actions), hearts (Goods/Events/Spells), diamonds (Deeds/Improvements). Players use a variable number of each type of card (depending on their focus) to construct their deck. Furthermore, each card has a rank (1–13, from ace to king). In some types (Dudes and Goods) cards with high rank are generally more powerful, while in the others (Deeds and Actions) cards with low rank are generally more powerful. Each Doomtown deck resembles a poker deck, but with one major difference: players are allowed to include multiples of a specific rank-suit combination, at the risk of making some of their poker hands &quot;illegal&quot;. This way, players not only have to choose cards with useful powers, but also have to choose cards that will allow them to draw good poker hands. Outfits are also represented by a home card which gives starting funds, starting income and a useful ability.

====Restrictions====
*Each deck must be exactly 52 cards plus one Outfit card and up to two Jokers.
*There can be no more than four copies of a card with the same name in a deck.
*There can be no more than four copies of a card with the same value and suit in a deck.

====Types of cards====
*Deeds: These are used for two reasons, to provide income and to win the game. Deeds have three defining stats - control, cost, and production/upkeep. Some deeds have actions or restrictions on them
*Dudes: These are your gang, ranging from old-style Wild West desperadoes and lawmen, to Lovecraftian witches and mad scientists. Each dude belongs to a specific outfit (except for drifters) denoted by a small icon below the character&#x27;s influence. Dudes are used to conduct your business and disrupt your opponent&#x27;s plans, and are often expendable.
*Goods: The normal stuff your dudes will equip and use, from Horses and New Hats to Death-Ray contraptions and mystical Bullets.
*Spells: These are used by the different spellcasters and come in three types – hexes (used by hucksters), Spirits (used by shaman) and Miracles (used by blessed).
*Events: Random stuff that happens in town. Events are not played directly, but take effect when they appear in your draw hand during a gambling phase. Only one event per player can resolve each gambling phase.
*Actions: These are all the nasty surprises you will play on your opponent(s). They are divided into Noon actions (playable on their own), Shootout actions (played during a shootout), and Reactions (played in response to another action).
*Jokers: You can have up to two Jokers in your deck. There are various Jokers to choose from - some are simply wild cards, while others have secondary abilities but restricted usage (e.g. only in shootouts) or only when making a &#x27;pull&#x27; (a one-card pull to determine the outcome of something within the game.

====Deck focus====
Players usually employ a strategy of focusing their deck on doing one thing well, with many viable goals to choose from. Some outfits are better equipped for some goals; for instance, Blackjacks (the game&#x27;s outlaw gang) usually have good shootout stats and other offensive abilities.
Below are some popular deck types. Players may mix two or more types, such as a shootout deck that partly relies on spells.
*Shootout: These decks focus on hunting down and killing the opponent&#x27;s most influential characters, so that they can win the game with just a few Control Points. Usually full of action cards.
*Spellslinging: These decks focus on using one or two characters packed with spells to manipulate the game. For example, one could use spells to reduce the opponent&#x27;s influence until the end of the turn, again enabling a win with just a few Control Points.
*Hiding/Turtling: These decks focus on pumping out more control points than the opponent could handle, and winning without much bloodshed, in effect &quot;buying the town&quot;. The Sweetrock faction is notorious for this. Another variation of this type is the Collegium&#x27;s first outfit ability, which gives control points for building Mad Science gadgets.
*Flooding: Overwhelming the opposing player by putting as many deeds as possible into play as quickly as possible.

===Rules===
The game is played in turns (called &quot;days&quot;). Each turn consists of four phases. In each phase, players play one action each until they all pass consecutively. (In contrast, in , each player may perform as many actions in a row as desired.) When all phases are complete, a new turn begins.

====Phases====
*Gambling Phase is a round of lowball poker, where the worst hand wins. The winner gets one GR from each of the other players and wins initiative, gaining the first action in the following phases of play (with actions then proceeding clockwise). In this phase, very illegal decks may be punished, because players cannot manipulate their cards to avoid an illegal hand (as in shootouts).
*Upkeep Phase is a round in which players to gather GR from deeds with production and pay GR for the upkeep of cards (or discard cards to avoid paying upkeep).
*High Noon is the main part of each turn, in which players can buy deeds and goods, recruit new dudes for their gang, move dudes around to take control of other deeds, start shootouts, and generally promote their strategy while disrupting that of the opponents.
*Nightfall is the end of each turn, when scores are counted and a win may be declared. Otherwise, each player prepares for the next turn: booted cards are unbooted and play hands are refilled. The player with the most influence at nightfall is rewarded with an extra bonus card for their play hand.

====Movement====
Movement is a major part of the game. Dudes must move from one place to another, and their ability to do so is based on the physical arrangement of the deeds. A deadly shootout hand may be useless if unable to catch the opponent&#x27;s dudes while they are moved around town to disrupt businesses.

====Victory conditions====
The game is won when, during Nightfall, one player has more control + victory points than the highest total influence of a single opponent. (In a later rules revision, a variant called for beating the &quot;lowest total influence&quot;, which leads to quicker multiplayer games for tournaments.)

Control points are acquired by controlling deeds that provide them. Deeds are controlled by the player with the most influence at the deed; if there is a tie then the owner of the deed controls it (even if they&#x27;re not involved in the tie). Some goods also have control points.

Victory points are given by meeting a condition of a card. For example, the Law Dogs outfit grants a victory point each time their controller kills a wanted dude with more than one influence or puts a wanted dude in jail. Some jobs earn victory points as well.

====Uniqueness====
Due to the game&#x27;s emphasis on storylines, dudes and deeds are unique; if one copy is in play (or in Boot Hill), a second copy cannot be played by any player. (Some exceptions are made for particularly common archetypes, such as the random drifting gunman or the dingy saloon.) The game employs &quot;card memory&quot;: if a dude or deed card is changed (e.g. a dude&#x27;s influence is permanently reduced), discarded, and then played again, the changes upon the card will remain in effect. The previous two points changed with Doomtown: Reloaded. Cards became unique to each player not to all players. Therefore each player could have the same card in play with the same name. Also, there is no longer card memory with that release / rule set.

====Shootouts====
There are situations when a player desires to control a location or kill an opposing dude. This is accomplished through game combat, called a &quot;shootout&quot;, which is modelled on a poker faceoff. The default way to engage in a shootout is to call-out the opposing dude, who may either refuse or stay and fight. If he stays, both players gather a posse of their dudes and drifters for the shootout.

The shootout has two phases: the action phase and the draw phase.
During the action phase, players perform shootout actions, either from their hand (e.g. &#x27;Sun in Yer Eyes&#x27; or &#x27;Out of Ammo&#x27;), or printed on cards in their posse. Shootout actions are used to influence the posse&#x27;s combat potential, by increasing the player&#x27;s bullet rating or reducing the opposing posse&#x27;s bullet rating.

During the draw phase, each player draws as many cards as the bullet rating allows: five cards, plus extra cards for Stud bullets, plus the option to discard and replace cards for Draw bullets (done as one lump group). Each player then tries to form the best poker hand from their cards. Due to jokers and Cheatin&#x27;, five of a kind is possible. The Dead Man&#x27;s Hand (ace of spades, ace of clubs, eight of spades, eight of clubs and jack of diamonds) is ranked highest. Each poker hand has a rating from 1 (high card) to 10 (dead man&#x27;s hand), and the losing player suffers a number of casualties equal to the difference in ratings. (In case of ties, each player suffers one.) After that, if neither player wishes to withdraw, the shootout continues for another round.

A typical shootout strategy is to force the opponent&#x27;s most crucial dudes (usually those with high influence) to enter an unfavorable shootout. Various action cards allow this, such as &quot;Ambush&#x27;, &#x27;Don&#x27;t Like Yer Looks!&#x27; and &#x27;Massacre&#x27;.

<text>The Workers Beer Company (WBC) is a trading arm of the Battersea and Wandsworth Trade Union Council (BWTUC) and is a British-Irish business that provides mass catering to bars at music festivals in the UK and Ireland. The WBC was set up by and is owned by the BWTUC.

WBC bars are staffed by volunteers and the money they earn is paid directly to the Labour Movement Organisations that send them along and vouch for and take responsibility for their honesty and reliability. The most notable festivals that WBC have worked at include Glastonbury Festival, Reading and Leeds Festivals, Latitude Festival, Tolpuddle Festival, Homelands, Festival Internacional de Benicàssim and Womad, as well as smaller concerts and meetings. In 2013 WBC expanded its business into Ireland working for MCD and Festival Republic at Slane, Longitude, Phoenix Park, and in recent times provided Information Stewards at Oxegen as well as cup recycling.

The company also runs a permanent public house, the Bread and Roses, in Clapham, London.

WBC and the trade union GMB set up an ethical clothing company called Ethical Threads that provides mainly promotional T-shirts and sweatshirts, which is now a sponsor of the football club Reading Town F.C.

In June 2018, Festival Republic organised three day events at Finsbury Park with bars managed by the Workers Beer Company. However they faced a massive Twitter backlash after fans complained about having to queue for up to two hours to get a drink in soaring temperatures. Queues plagued most of the event leading some fans to leave the early. The Company later issued an apology blaming an &quot;unprecedented failure of up to 40% of staff to turn up&quot;.

<doc id="767723" wikidata="Q1151705" url="?curid=767723" title="Chu–Han Contention">
<text>The Chu–Han Contention (), also known as the Chu–Han War (), was an interregnum in Imperial China between the fall of the Qin dynasty and the establishment of the Han dynasty. After the Qin were overthrown by rebel forces in 206 BCE, the empire was divided into the Eighteen Kingdoms ruled by rebel leaders and former Qin generals according to Xiang Yu, the rebel leader. A civil war soon broke out, most prominently between two major contending powersXiang Yu and Liu Bang, who were respectively the rulers of the Chu and Han kingdoms. Some of the other kingdoms also waged war among themselves but these were largely insignificant compared to the main conflict between Chu and Han. The war ended with a Han victory at the Battle of Gaixia in 202 BCE, during which Xiang Yu committed suicide after having made a last stand. Liu subsequently proclaimed himself emperor of the newly established Han dynasty.

== Background ==
Towards the end of the Warring States period, the Qin state conquered the other six statesHan, Zhao, Yan, Wei, Chu and Qiand unified China under the Qin dynasty in 221 BCE. Ying Zheng, the King of Qin, declared himself Shi Huangdi – the First Emperor. After his death in 210 BCE, an uprising broke out in 209, and lasted about five months until Qin forces crushed the rebellion.

Although the uprising had failed, other rebellions erupted consecutively over the next three years. The leaders of these rebellions were either pretenders to the thrones of the former six states conquered by Qin, or supporters of the pretenders. Among them, the most notable one was Xiang Yu, who descended from a family of Chu generals, and he wanted to restore the Chu state with King Huai II as its nominal ruler. Xiang Yu led Chu forces to victory over Qin forces at the Battle of Julu and declared himself &quot;Hegemon-King of Western Chu&quot;. After the battle, he controlled nine commanderies in the former Liang and Chu territories, with the capital at Pengcheng (; present-day Xuzhou, Jiangsu).

In the meantime, Liu Bang, another notable rebel leader who had initially joined Xiang Yu, had formed his own rebel group. While the bulk of the Qin forces were fighting against Xiang Yu at the Battle of Julu, Liu Bang led his forces into the Guanzhong region, the heartland of the Qin dynasty, facing minimal resistance along the way. In 206 BCE, the last Qin emperor, Ziying, surrendered the capital Xianyang to Liu Bang, bringing an end to the Qin dynasty. Liu Bang treated Ziying respectfully and forbade his followers from harming civilians and looting Xianyang. However, when Xiang Yu eventually arrived in the Guanzhong region, Liu Bang was pressured into ceding control of the region to Xiang Yu despite an earlier agreement between them that whoever occupied Guanzhong first would earn the title &quot;King of Guanzhong&quot;.

After Xiang Yu took control of Xianyang, he allowed his troops to pillage and plunder the city and ordered the destruction of the Epang Palace. Xiang Yu also attempted to assassinate Liu Bang at the Feast at Swan Goose Gate but Liu Bang survived and escaped due to Xiang Yu&#x27;s indecisiveness. Later, Xiang Yu forced Liu Bang to relocate from Guanzhong to the remote, underdeveloped Bashu region (present-day Chongqing and Sichuan).

Xiang Yu then divided the former Qin Empire into numerous vassal states, each ruled by either a rebel leader or a surrendered Qin general. The states were collectively known as the Eighteen Kingdoms, with the Kingdom of Chu as the nominal sovereign power over the other kingdoms. Xiang Yu also honoured King Huai II with a higher title, &quot;Emperor Yi of Chu&quot;. Shortly after that, he exiled the figurehead emperor to Chen County (; present-day Chenzhou, Hunan), and secretly ordered Ying Bu, the King of Jiujiang, to intercept and assassinate Emperor Yi along the way.

== Initial stages ==
In 206 BCE, after the former Qin Empire was divided into the Eighteen Kingdoms, Liu Bang was made King of Han and relocated to the Bashu region (present-day Chongqing and Sichuan) along with 30,000 troops and thousands of civilians. Upon reaching his destination, Liu Bang ordered the destruction of the gallery roads leading into Bashu in order to trick Xiang Yu into believing that he had no intention of leaving Bashu, and as a precautionary move against any attack from outside Bashu.

=== Rebellions in Qi and Zhao ===
Meanwhile, in the former Qi state, Tian Rong, a Qi noble, was unhappy with how the Qi territories had been split among three kingdomsQi, Jiaodong and Jibei, collectively known as the Three Qisso he waged war against the other kingdoms. He killed Tian Shi, the King of Jiaodong, and Tian An, the King of Jibei. Tian Du, the King of Qi, was defeated by Tian Rong so he fled and joined Xiang Yu. Tian Rong gained control of the Three Qis and became the ruler of the Qi territories.

Tian Rong put Peng Yue in command of the Qi army and sent him to attack Xiang Yu. At the same time, he sent troops to support Chen Yu, who had started a rebellion in the former state of Zhao. In 205 BCE, Chen Yu defeated Zhang Er, the King of Changshan, and seized control of his kingdom. Chen Yu then installed Zhao Xie, the King of Dai, as the new ruler of the Zhao territories.

Upon learning of the rebellions in Qi and Zhao, Xiang Yu led his forces to deal with the rebels.

=== Han conquest of the Three Qins ===
While Xiang Yu was away, Liu Bang seized the opportunity to attack the territories in Guanzhong which were ruled by three former Qin generals and collectively known as the Three Qins. He sent Han Xin to pretend to repair the gallery roads leading from Bashu to the Three Qins in order to put the enemy off guard, while secretly taking another route through Chencang (present-day Chencang District, Baoji, Shaanxi) to get to the Three Qins. Han Xin took Zhang Han, the King of Yong, by surprise and defeated him in two consecutive battles.

Riding on the tide of victory, Liu Bang proceeded to conquer Longxi (the area in present-day Gansu located west of Mount Long), Beidi (eastern Gansu and Ningxia) and Shang (around present-day Yulin, Shaanxi). He also sent his men to fetch his family in Pei (present-day Xuzhou, Jiangsu) and bring them to him. Upon receiving news of Liu Bang&#x27;s attacks, Xiang Yu sent an army to Yangjia (; present-day Taikang County, Henan) to block Liu Bang&#x27;s forces; he also appointed Zheng Chang as the King of Hán to help him cover his flank.

Meanwhile, Zang Tu, the King of Yan, killed Han Guang, the King of Liaodong, seized his lands and proclaimed himself the ruler of the Yan territories.

=== Battle of Pengcheng ===
In 205 BCE, after conquering the Three Qins in the Guanzhong region, Liu Bang advanced to the east of Hangu Pass to prepare for an attack on the Henan region. Sima Xin, the King of Sai, Dong Yi, the King of Di, and Shen Yang, the King of Henan, surrendered to Liu Bang. Zheng Chang, the King of Hán, refused to submit to Liu Bang, so Liu Bang sent Hán Xin to attack and defeat him. Liu Bang then replaced Zheng Chang with Hán Xin as the new King of Hán. Zhang Er, the former King of Changshan, joined Liu Bang after losing his domain to Zhao Xie and Chen Yu.

In April–May 205 BCE, Liu Bang attacked Henei with help from Wei Bao, the King of Western Wei. When Liu Bang received news that Xiang Yu had ordered the assassination of Emperor Yi, he held a memorial service for the emperor and accused Xiang Yu of committing regicide, using this incident as political propaganda to justify his war against Xiang Yu.

In May–June 205 BCE, Xiang Yu defeated Tian Rong at Chengyang (; around present-day Ju County, Shandong). Tian Rong was killed while retreating to Pingyuan (around present-day northwestern Shandong). Although the Kingdom of Qi had surrendered, Xiang Yu still allowed his troops to plunder and loot the Qi territories. Tian Rong&#x27;s younger brother, Tian Heng, made Tian Rong&#x27;s son Tian Guang the new King of Qi, and continued to put up resistance against Xiang Yu.

Meanwhile, Liu Bang had mustered an army of about 560,000 with support from the kings who had surrendered to him. In September–October 205 BCE, the Chu capital, Pengcheng (; present-day Xuzhou, Jiangsu), fell to a coalition force led by Liu Bang. When Xiang Yu received news that Liu Bang had occupied Pengcheng, he led 30,000 troops to retake Pengcheng. Liu Bang was caught off guard and his army suffered heavy casualties and his family members were captured by Chu forces. After the battle, Liu Bang lost his territorial gains in Chu and the support of his allies.

=== Battle of Jingsuo ===
After their defeat at Pengcheng, the strength of the Han forces decreased drastically. Liu Bang&#x27;s family members were captured by Xiang Yu&#x27;s forces and kept as hostages. Many of the kings who had surrendered to Liu Bang earlier defected to Xiang Yu&#x27;s side after Liu Bang&#x27;s defeat. The rulers of Qi and Zhao also requested to make peace with Xiang Yu.

Upon reaching Xiayi (; east of present-day Dangshan County, Anhui) which was guarded by his brother-in-law, Liu Bang reorganised his troops for a retreat. Meanwhile, Han Xin led reinforcements from Guanzhong into central China and defeated a Chu army between Jing County () and Suo Village (), both in present-day Henan. He also put down a rebellion by Wang Wu and Cheng Chu – former Qin generals – and Shen Tu, the magistrate of Wei, and captured their base at Waihuang (; in present-day Minquan County, Henan). He and Liu Bang reorganised the Han army and established strong Han garrisons in Xingyang and Chenggao. Han Xin also developed his plan to conquer northern China, with the aim that Xiang Yu would be too distracted by Liu Bang and his bases of Xingyang and Chenggao to properly counter Han Xin in the north, nor could he endanger his line of retreat by marching past Xingyang and Chenggao into Guanzhong.

Liu Bang then sent a messenger to meet Ying Bu, the King of Jiujiang, to persuade Ying Bu to support him. In November 205 BCE, after Han Xin&#x27;s victory at the Battle of Jingxing, Ying Bu agreed to join Liu Bang and rebelled against Xiang Yu. Upon learning about it, Xiang Yu sent Long Ju to attack Ying Bu.

In July–August 205 BCE, Liu Bang named his son Liu Ying as his heir apparent and put him in charge of Yueyang (; present-day Yanliang District, Xi&#x27;an). Shortly after, Han forces conquered Feiqiu (; present-day Xingping, Shaanxi), which was guarded by Zhang Han, who committed suicide after his defeat.

On another front, Ying Bu was unable to resist Long Ju&#x27;s attacks so he gave up on his domain in Jiujiang and joined Liu Bang.

== Northern front ==

=== Battle of Anyi ===
In 205 BCE, Wei Bao left Liu Bang on the pretext of visiting an ill relative and secretly returned to his domain. He pledged allegiance to Xiang Yu and rebelled against Liu Bang. Liu Bang sent Li Yiji to persuade Wei Bao to surrender but Wei Bao refused, so Liu Bang ordered Han Xin to attack Wei Bao.

Wei Bao stationed his army at Puban (; present-day Yongji, Shanxi) and blocked the route to Linjin (; present-day Dali County, Shaanxi). Han Xin tricked Wei Bao into believing that he was planning to attack Linjin, while secretly sending a force from Xiayang (; present-day Hancheng, Shaanxi) to cross the river and attack Anyi (; present-day Xia County, Shanxi).

In October–November 205 BCE, Wei Bao personally led an attack on Han Xin but lost the battle and was captured. When he surrendered, Liu Bang accepted his surrender and appointed him as a general. Within the same month, Han Xin attacked the Kingdom of Dai with support from Zhang Er, the former King of Changshan, scored a decisive victory, capturing the Dai chancellor Xia Shuo.

=== Battle of Jingxing ===
After achieving victory over the Kingdom of Dai, Han Xin and Zhang Er attacked the Kingdom of Zhao at Jingxing Pass. Zhao Xie, the King of Zhao, and his chancellor, Chen Yu, led an army of 200,000 to resist the Han forces. Li Zuoche, a Zhao general, proposed a plan to trap Han Xin within ten days: he would lead 30,000 men to disrupt Han Xin&#x27;s supply route and block his return route, while Chen Yu would defend the frontline firmly and prevent Han Xin from advancing. Chen Yu refused to follow Li Zuoche&#x27;s plan.

The evening before the battle, Han Xin sent 2,000 horsemen, each carrying a flag of the Han army, to station near the Zhao camp. The next morning, Han Xin feigned defeat in a skirmish with Zhao forces and lured them to follow him, while his 2,000 men took advantage of the situation to capture the weakly defended Zhao camp. Meanwhile, the Zhao soldiers retreated after failing to conquer Han Xin&#x27;s fort, and were surprised to see that their camp had been occupied by Han forces when they returned. The Zhao army fell into chaos and Han Xin seized the opportunity to launch a counterattack and scored a victory. Chen Yu was killed in action while Zhao Xie and Li Zuoche were captured.

=== Battle of Wei River ===
In 204 BCE, after the Kingdom of Yan had surrendered to him, Liu Bang made Zhang Er the new King of Zhao. Xiang Yu constantly sent his forces to attack the Kingdom of Zhao, but Han Xin and Zhang Er managed to hold their ground. Xiang Yu then turned his attention towards Xingyang, where Liu Bang was stationed. Liu Bang was forced to retreat to Chenggao, but he eventually abandoned Chenggao and headed north of the Yellow River to where Han Xin was. In a surprise move, Liu Bang seized control over the troops under Han Xin&#x27;s command and ordered Han Xin to attack the Kingdom of Qi.

Just as Han Xin was preparing to attack Qi, Liu Bang sent Li Yiji to persuade Tian Guang, the King of Qi, to surrender. However, Liu Bang had not informed Han Xin about what he had sent Li Yiji to do. Meanwhile, Tian Guang had decided to surrender to Liu Bang so he had pulled back his forces from Lixia (; present-day Jinan, Shandong). However, as Han Xin did not know that Tian Guang had the intention of surrendering, he followed Kuai Tong&#x27;s advice and launched an attack on the retreating Qi forces, conquering Lixia and attacking the Qi capital Linzi. Tian Guang thought that Li Yiji had lied to him to distract him from Han Xin&#x27;s attacks, so he had Li Yiji boiled alive. Then, he retreated to Gaomi and requested aid from Xiang Yu. In the meantime, Han Xin conquered Linzi and continued to pursue the retreating Qi forces to Gaomi.

Xiang Yu sent Long Ju to lead 200,000 troops to help Tian Guang. After Han Xin defeated Long Ju in battle, Long Ju was advised to focus on strengthening his defences and getting Tian Guang to rally support from the fallen Qi territories. However, Long Ju decided not to heed the advice, and insisted on attacking Han Xin. On the night before the battle, Han Xin sent his men to dam the Wei River (; in present-day Weifang, Shandong) with sandbags.

The next morning, after a skirmish with Chu forces, Han Xin feigned defeat and retreated to lure the enemy to follow him. After about a quarter of the Chu forces had crossed the river, Han Xin signalled to his men to open the dam. Many Chu soldiers drowned and Long Ju was isolated with only a fraction of his forces. Taking advantage of the situation, Han Xin launched a counterattack. Long Ju was killed in action and the rest of the Chu forces disintegrated as Han Xin continued pressing the attack. Tian Guang fled while Han Xin pursued the retreating Chu forces to Chengyang (; near present-day Ju County, Shandong).

After his victory, Han Xin swiftly took control of the Qi territories and sent a messenger to Liu Bang, requesting that Liu Bang make him the new King of Qi. At the time, Liu Bang was under attack by Xiang Yu in Xingyang and was eagerly awaiting reinforcements from Han Xin. Initially, he was furious when he received Han Xin&#x27;s request. However, he eventually acted on the advice of Zhang Liang and Chen Ping, and reluctantly approved Han Xin&#x27;s request. At the same time, Xiang Yu felt worried after losing Long Ju, so he sent Wu She to incite Han Xin to rebel against Liu Bang and declare himself king. However, despite Kuai Tong&#x27;s urging, Han Xin refused to betray Liu Bang. Han Xin later organised an army to move southward and attack Xiang Yu.

== Battle of Chenggao and the Treaty of Hong Canal ==
On the southern front, Liu Bang&#x27;s forces started building supply routes from Xingyang to Aocang (; northwest of Xingyang, Henan). In 204 BCE, after sustaining losses from Chu attacks on the routes, Liu Bang&#x27;s forces ran short of supplies so Liu Bang negotiated for peace with Xiang Yu and agreed to cede the lands east of Xingyang to Xiang Yu. Xiang Yu wanted to accept Liu Bang&#x27;s offer, but Fan Zeng advised him to reject and use the opportunity to destroy Liu Bang. Xiang Yu changed his mind, pressed the attack on Xingyang and besieged Liu Bang&#x27;s forces inside the city. Liu Bang heeded Chen Ping&#x27;s suggestion to bribe Xiang Yu&#x27;s men with 40,000 catties of gold for them to spread rumours that Fan Zeng had betrayed Xiang Yu. Xiang Yu fell for the ruse and dismissed Fan Zeng.

In late 204 BCE, while Xiang Yu was away suppressing the rebellion in Qi, Li Yiji had advised Liu Bang to use the opportunity to attack Xiang Yu. Liu Bang&#x27;s forces conquered Chenggao and defeated the Chu army led by Cao Jiu near the Si River. Liu Bang&#x27;s forces advanced further until they reached Guangwu (; present-day Guangwu Town, Xingyang, Henan). Chu forces led by Zhongli Mo were trapped by Han forces at the east of Xingyang. Following Han Xin&#x27;s victory at the Battle of Wei River, the Chu forces&#x27; morale fell and they ran short of supplies months later. Xiang Yu had no choice but to request to make peace with Liu Bang and release Liu Bang&#x27;s family members, whom he had been holding hostage. Xiang Yu and Liu Bang then agreed to a ceasefire at the Treaty of Hong Canal, which divided China into east and west under the Chu and Han domains respectively.

== End of the war ==
In 203 BCE, while Xiang Yu was retreating eastward, Liu Bang, acting on the advice of Zhang Liang and Chen Ping, renounced the Treaty of Hong Canal and ordered an attack on Xiang Yu. He also requested assistance from Han Xin and Peng Yue to attack Xiang Yu simultaneously from three directions. However, as Han Xin and Peng Yue did not mobilise their troops, Liu Bang was defeated by Xiang Yu at Guling (; south of present-day Taikang County, Henan) and forced to retreat and reinforce his defences. At the same time, he sent messengers to Han Xin and Peng Yue again, promising them land and titles if they joined him in attacking Xiang Yu.

=== Battle of Gaixia ===
In December 203 BCE, Liu Bang, Han Xin and Peng Yue attacked Xiang Yu from three directions. Running low on supplies, Xiang Yu and his forces found themselves surrounded by Han forces in Gaixia (; southeast of present-day Lingbi County, Anhui). Han Xin ordered his troops to sing Chu folk songs to create the impression that Chu territories had surrendered to Han forces and now many Chu men had joined the Han side. The morale of Xiang Yu&#x27;s forces plummeted and many of his soldiers deserted.

Xiang Yu attempted to break out the siege and was left with only 28 men when he reached the northern bank of the Wu River (; near present-day He County, Anhui). He made a last stand and managed to slay hundreds of Han soldiers before he was eventually overwhelmed and ended up committing suicide by slitting his throat.

== Aftermath ==
After Xiang Yu&#x27;s death, the rest of the Chu forces surrendered to Liu Bang, and China was unified under Liu Bang&#x27;s rule. Liu Bang granted Peng Yue, Ying Bu and Han Xin the titles of King of Liang, King of Huainan and King of Chu respectively. Months later, at the urging of his followers and vassals, Liu Bang declared himself emperor and established the Han dynasty as the ruling dynasty in China. The imperial capital was at Luoyang but later moved to Chang&#x27;an (present-day Xi&#x27;an, Shaanxi). Liu Bang made his wife Lü Zhi empress and his son Liu Ying crown prince.

Although Liu Bang initially handsomely rewarded those who helped him become emperor, he gradually became suspicious of them and started to doubt their loyalties. Han Xin was demoted from King of Chu to Marquis of Huaiyin in late 202 BCE, and was subsequently arrested and executed by Empress Lü in 196 BCE for allegedly plotting a rebellion with Chen Xi. In the same year, Liu Bang believed rumours that Peng Yue was also involved in the plot, so he demoted Peng Yue to the status of a commoner. Peng Yue and his family members were subsequently executed by Empress Lü.

== Cultural references ==
* In xiangqi, the middle section of the board that separates the players&#x27; sides is called the &quot;Chu river and Han border&quot; (). The red and black sides represent Han and Chu respectively.
* The Beijing opera &quot;The Hegemon-King Bids His Lady Farewell&quot;, also known as &quot;Farewell My Concubine&quot;, depicts the events of Xiang Yu&#x27;s defeat at the Battle of Gaixia and his romance with Consort Yu. 
* Two musical pieces for the pipa depict the Battle of Gaixia from the Han and Chu perspectives respectively – &quot;Ambush from Ten Sides&quot; () and &quot;The Hegemon-King Takes Off His Armour&quot; ().
* Some &quot;chengyu&quot; (Chinese idioms) and proverbs originated from the events of the Chu–Han contention, such as
** &quot;Breaking cauldrons and sinking boats&quot; (), used to indicate one&#x27;s determination to fight to the end, similar to burning one&#x27;s boat and crossing the Rubicon. It originated from Xiang Yu&#x27;s orders during the Battle of Julu when Chu forces launched a fierce attack on Qin forces.
** Feast at Swan Goose Gate (), used figuratively to refer to an ostensibly joyous occasion which is actually a dangerous trap. It originated from an incident in 206 BCE when Xiang Yu invited Liu Bang to attend a feast while secretly planning to assassinate Liu Bang during the feast. The saying &quot;Xiang Zhuang performs a sword dance with his attention directed towards the Duke of Pei&quot; () also originated from this event. It is used figuratively to refer to a person&#x27;s action being a veiled attack on another person.
** &quot;Pretending to repair the gallery roads while secretly passing through Chencang&quot; (), used to refer to disguising one&#x27;s action with a more obvious action. It originated from Han Xin&#x27;s strategy to attack the Three Qins.
** &quot;Fighting a battle with one&#x27;s back facing a river&quot; (), used to indicate one&#x27;s determination to fight to the death. It originated from the Battle of Jingxing between Han and Zhao forces.
** &quot;Ambush on ten sides&quot; (), refers to a situation in which one is under siege. It originated from Han Xin&#x27;s strategy to trap Xiang Yu during the Battle of Gaixia.
** &quot;Surrounded by Chu songs&quot; (), refers to one being surrounded by enemies on all sides. It originated from the Battle of Gaixia when the Han soldiers sang Chu folk songs to dampen the fighting spirit of the besieged Chu forces.

<text>Darren Barr Fletcher (born 1 February 1984) is a Scottish football coach and former professional player who is currently serving as a first-team coach at Manchester United, where he spent the majority of his playing career and won 13 trophies including five Premier League titles and the UEFA Champions League. He mostly played as a central midfielder, but began his career as a right winger and also featured occasionally in defence.

Fletcher came through the ranks of Manchester United&#x27;s Youth Academy and spent 20 years with United, making 342 appearances for the club. With them, he won five Premier Leagues, one FA Cup, two League Cups, four FA Community Shields, the FIFA Club World Cup and the UEFA Champions League. Fletcher was included in the PFA Premier League Team of the Year for 2009–10. He was named vice-captain in his last season with the club. He joined West Bromwich Albion in February 2015, where he made 97 appearances. After leaving Albion in 2017, Fletcher had a two-year stint with Stoke City. He returned to Manchester United in a coaching capacity in October 2020, working with the club&#x27;s under-16s players, before being appointed to the first team in January 2021. In March 2021, he became technical director at Manchester United.

Fletcher made his full international debut for Scotland in 2003, and scored his first international goal on his second appearance. The following year, he played as the team&#x27;s youngest captain for over a century. After Barry Ferguson was banned from international football because of a breach of regulations, Fletcher was given the captaincy on a full-time basis in August 2009. In total he won 80 caps and scored 5 goals for Scotland.

The middle of Fletcher&#x27;s career was disrupted by an extended break from football due to health problems caused by ulcerative colitis. Between November 2011 and December 2013, he played only ten times for his club, undergoing an operation in early 2013 to lessen the effects of the condition after a failed return in September 2012.

==Early life==
Fletcher was born in Dalkeith and raised in Mayfield near Edinburgh. He was educated at St Luke&#x27;s RC Primary School and St David&#x27;s RC High School in Dalkeith. He is of Irish descent through his mother who hails from Achill Island.

==Club career==
===Manchester United===
====Early years====
Fletcher played his youth football at Hutchison Vale, Tynecastle Boys Club and Celtic Boys Club before being scouted by Manchester United. He first joined the Manchester United youth setup at the age of 11, and then signed with the club when he was aged 15. Fletcher said in 2020 that he had almost signed for Newcastle United instead, as some people advised him it would be harder to break into the Manchester United first team.

He progressed quickly with Manchester United, and could have become the youngest player ever to appear in their first team when he was selected in their squad for the final fixture of the 1999–2000 FA Premier League season, against Aston Villa on 14 May 2000. This plan was stymied as Premier League rules prohibited players on schoolboy contracts from appearing at the senior level, and his debut was delayed. He had been part of the reserve team that won the Manchester Senior Cup in 1999–2000. Fletcher was initially seen as a right midfielder, similar to David Beckham, and was tipped by many to break into the first-team with ease and stay there for many years to come. As he developed he came to be viewed more as a central midfielder.

Over the next couple of seasons, Fletcher&#x27;s involvement was limited due to various injuries, including a broken foot. Nevertheless, by the 2002–03 season, he had become a regular member of the reserve team, and after several appearances as an unused substitute, he finally made his first-team debut on 12 March 2003 – almost three years behind schedule – starting on the right side of midfield against Basel in the second group stage of the UEFA Champions League. He was substituted for David Beckham after 73 minutes, but a second Champions League appearance followed against Deportivo de La Coruña a week later, and he was named as a substitute for both legs of the quarter-final tie against Real Madrid. For his performances for the reserve team during the 2002–03 season, Fletcher received the Denzil Haroun Reserve Player of the Year award.

====First-team regular====
Fletcher broke into the Manchester United team during the 2003–04 campaign, playing a number of important matches and starting in United&#x27;s FA Cup Final win over Millwall in May 2004. Despite a slow start to the 2004–05 campaign, in which in the early part of the season he made very few competitive appearances, Fletcher again broke into the United first-team. On 1 January 2005, Fletcher scored his first goal at club level in a 2–0 win over Middlesbrough.

Fletcher was one of the players singled out for criticism by club captain Roy Keane in the wake of United&#x27;s 4–1 defeat to Middlesbrough in October 2005. Keane reportedly said, &quot;I can&#x27;t understand why people in Scotland rave about Darren Fletcher.&quot; However, Keane later attempted to set the record straight stating, &quot;If you listen to any of my comments over the last two or three years, if I&#x27;ve given any player credit over the years it would be Fletch. Fletch will tell you that himself.&quot; Fletcher went some way towards answering his critics on 6 November 2005, with his performance in the vital league match at home to Chelsea, scoring the only goal of the game with a looping header. His winning goal ended Chelsea&#x27;s 40-match unbeaten run in the Premier League.

In 2006–07, at the start of the season Fletcher retained a place in the first-team but only on the bench and scored in an away win over Charlton Athletic, as well as scoring the headed winner in the away game with Middlesbrough in December and another headed goal in the home win against Charlton in February, making it a double against the club that season. As the season progressed, Alex Ferguson preferred the midfield quartet of Cristiano Ronaldo, Paul Scholes, Michael Carrick and Ryan Giggs, limiting Fletcher to a few substitute appearances. However, with Scholes absent through suspension, he made a starring appearance in United&#x27;s 7–1 win over Roma in the Champions League quarter-final.

In the 2007–08 season, with the arrival at the club of fellow central midfielders Owen Hargreaves and Anderson and winger Nani, Fletcher played even less than he did during the previous season. As before, Ferguson preferred Carrick, Scholes, Giggs and Ronaldo to him in midfield, and got even less playing time than the new arrivals. He did, however, put in some stalwart performances when given the chance, including two goals in the 4–0 defeat of Arsenal at Old Trafford in the FA Cup fourth round. Fletcher picked up a Champions League winner&#x27;s medal but was an unused substitute in the final.

In the 2008–09 season, Fletcher started the first two games, due to injuries to Carrick and Ronaldo, and scored against Newcastle United at Old Trafford in United&#x27;s first Premier League match of the season, forcing a 1–1 draw after Obafemi Martins&#x27; goal. Fletcher notched his second goal of the season opening the scoring from close range against Portsmouth, following a pass from Patrice Evra. He was later shown a yellow card on the 93rd minute before the match ended 1–0. On 3 October 2008, Fletcher signed a three-year extension to his contract with Man Utd, keeping him at the club until 2012. Fletcher notched his third goal of the season against Everton on 25 October. He then scored in the Club World Cup semi-final against Gamba Osaka on 18 December after coming off the bench.

In the Champions League semi-final second leg against Arsenal on 5 May 2009, Fletcher was sent off, ruling him out of the Champions League Final. Manchester United appealed to UEFA to have the red card overturned on compassionate grounds on 7 May 2009, but this was rejected on 11 May. Then-Inter Milan coach José Mourinho commented on his absence: &quot;Fletcher is more important than people think ... he &#x27;eats&#x27; opponents in defensive transition. I believe Xavi and Andrés Iniesta are happy Fletch is not playing.&quot;

The 2009–10 season saw Fletcher consolidate his place in the heart of the United midfield, starting all of United&#x27;s important games. He opened his scoring account for the season with a double in the first Manchester derby of the season, a memorable 4–3 victory for United, twice putting United ahead before Michael Owen scored in the sixth minute of added time. He won the Man of the Match award for his performance. On 21 November 2009, Fletcher scored his third of the season, hitting a half volley from the edge of the area into the top corner giving United a 1–0 lead against Everton in a 3–0 win. This season also saw Fletcher and fellow midfielders Michael Carrick and Park Ji-sung deputise in defence due to an injury crisis that left Patrice Evra being the only fit regular in defence. They still managed to keep a clean sheet against West Ham United and concede only one goal against Bundesliga champions Wolfsburg in the Champions League. Fletcher was sent off during the match against Birmingham City on 9 January 2010 after two bookable offences. On 10 March, he scored the fourth goal in a 4–0 win in the second leg of United&#x27;s last 16 Champions League tie with AC Milan, making the score 7–2 on aggregate. Following this, Fletcher captained United for the first time in the league match against West Ham and was later confirmed as United&#x27;s vice-captain, a position he held until December 2014. In April, Fletcher capped a successful season with selection in the PFA Premier League Team of the Year. On 9 May, the last day of the season, Fletcher scored the first goal of a 4–0 win at home to Stoke City.

====Later years and illness====
Fletcher made his first start of the 2011–12 season in United&#x27;s first group stage match on 14 September 2011 in the Champions League away at Benfica, which ended in a 1–1 draw. This was Fletcher&#x27;s first start for a number of months after being sidelined towards the end of the 2010–11 season with illness, revealed in December 2011 to be ulcerative colitis. He made his first Premier League appearance of the season four days later in a 3–1 home win against title rivals Chelsea. Fletcher maintained his place in centre midfield in the following Premier League games against Stoke and Norwich City. On 23 October, he scored the consolation goal in a 6–1 defeat to local rivals Manchester City, with a curling shot into the top corner.

Fletcher made his 300th career appearance for Manchester United on 5 November in a 1–0 home win against Sunderland. Fletcher scored United&#x27;s second goal in a 2–2 draw with Benfica on 22 November in the Champions League. He met Patrice Evra&#x27;s cross at the first attempt, which the goalkeeper got a hand to and he followed it up on the second attempt to score. Following this match, he announced that he would be taking an extended break from football following medical advice about his ongoing ulcerative colitis. He did not play again in the 2011–12 season.

On 14 August 2012, Fletcher came on as a second-half substitute, taking the captain&#x27;s armband, for Manchester United against Aberdeen in Neil Simpson&#x27;s testimonial. He played his first competitive match in ten months, coming on as a substitute for Paul Scholes in the 78th minute in Manchester United&#x27;s 1–0 win over Galatasaray at Old Trafford in the Champions League. On 24 November, Fletcher scored his first goal since his illness, a header from a Wayne Rooney corner against Queens Park Rangers. On 17 January 2013, it was announced that Fletcher had undergone surgery aimed at resolving his condition, which would rule him out for the remainder of the season. The statement stressed that this was a &quot;planned procedure undertaken at the optimal time&quot; that required Fletcher to be in good health to be carried out. In his May 2013 retirement speech following his final match at Old Trafford as Manchester United manager, Alex Ferguson wished Fletcher a speedy recovery and return to football. A week later, it was revealed that his surgery had been a success and that Fletcher was on course to return to football in July 2013.

On 15 December 2013, Fletcher made his first appearance for nearly a year when he came on as a substitute for Ryan Giggs in a 3–0 victory over Aston Villa. Another substitute appearance followed in the 2–0 League Cup win against Stoke City on 18 December, and on 26 December 2013, Fletcher made his first league start for 390 days in a 3–2 win away to Hull City. He was named Manchester United vice-captain by Louis van Gaal in August 2014.

===West Bromwich Albion===
On 2 February 2015, Fletcher signed for West Bromwich Albion on a free transfer. He made his debut on 8 February 2015 against Burnley, where he was given the captain&#x27;s armband. He scored his first goal for the club on 11 April 2015 against Leicester City, although the Baggies lost 3–2. Between his debut for West Brom in February 2015 and the international break of October 2015, Fletcher did not miss a minute of Premier League football, marking fully his comeback from several illness-disrupted seasons.
He scored his second goal for West Brom on 28 December 2015, in a 1–0 win against Newcastle United. Fletcher had to wait until the 2016–17 season for his next Premier League goal to come. It finally came in a 4–0 win against Burnley on 21 November 2016. He scored his second goal of the 2016–17 season on 21 January 2017, in a 2–0 win against Sunderland. A game against Stoke City, on 4 February 2017, marked his 300th game in the Premier League. Former manager Sir Alex Ferguson hailed him as a &quot;fantastic professional and fantastic human being.&quot;

===Stoke City===
On 1 June 2017, Fletcher signed a two-year contract with Stoke City, effective from the expiration of his West Bromwich Albion contract on 1 July. He made his debut on 12 August as the team began their season with a 1–0 loss at Everton, playing the full 90 minutes. Local newspaper &quot;The Sentinel&quot; praised his passing in the match. Fletcher started in the first nine games of the 2017–18 Premier League season for Stoke, extending a streak of consecutive league appearances to 100. He became the eighth outfield player to achieve this mark in the Premier League era. Fletcher scored his first goal for Stoke in a 1–0 win away at Watford on 28 October 2017. Fletcher played 29 times in 2017–18 as Stoke suffered relegation to the EFL Championship.

Fletcher struggled for playing time in 2018–19, making 11 appearances under Gary Rowett and then Nathan Jones. He scored the only goal of the game against Bristol City on 27 October 2018. Fletcher left Stoke at the end of the campaign.

After leaving Stoke, Fletcher began studying for coaching qualifications. He said in November 2019 that he had not officially retired from playing, and did not yet feel ready to begin a career in management. In May 2020 he acknowledged that he &quot;probably&quot; wouldn&#x27;t play again, and said that his medical condition (ulcerative colitis) meant that he would be at higher risk from COVID-19.

==International career==
Fletcher established himself as a regular choice for Scotland during the 2003–04 season. He scored his first goal in a 1–0 win against Lithuania, having come off the bench for only his second cap. His goal took Scotland to the play-offs for UEFA Euro 2004. On 26 May 2004, he captained Scotland to a 1–0 friendly win against Estonia in Tallinn, making him the youngest Scotland captain since 17-year-old John Lambie in 1886. Fletcher scored with a 25-yard strike in a 3–0 win against Slovenia on 12 October 2005.

Fletcher was Scotland&#x27;s vice-captain under Alex McLeish, deputising in the absence of regular captain Barry Ferguson. Fletcher was named as full-time captain in November 2009 when Ferguson was banned from international football for misbehaviour.

Fletcher earned his 50th cap in September 2010, in a UEFA Euro 2012 qualifying match against Liechtenstein. His bouts of illness interrupted his international career, which meant that Scott Brown assumed the captaincy. Fletcher was recalled to the international squad for a friendly against Poland in March 2014. He resumed the captaincy in September 2016, after Brown had temporarily retired from international football.

==Coaching career==
In November 2019, Fletcher said he aspired to a future in management. In October 2020, Fletcher returned to Manchester United to coach their under-16s players, and in January 2021, he was promoted to first-team coach. In March 2021, he became the technical director at Manchester United. He was replaced in this role by Jason Wilcox in April 2024, with United saying that Fletcher would &quot;continue to play a key role in the football leadership team&quot;.

==Style of play==
Fletcher usually played as central midfielder in a box-to-box role, where he stood out for his physicality, tenacity, intelligence, and work-rate, as well as his energy and defensive ability, namely his tackling and marking. He was capable of playing anywhere in midfield, however, and also played as a right winger, in a holding role, and on occasion in defence; at international level, he also played in a more attacking role, due to his ability to get forward, which earned him comparisons with Steven Gerrard. In 2009, Terry Butcher described Fletcher as a &quot;complete midfielder, a rare all-rounder and although he&#x27;s a slightly different player to Roy Keane, he can become as great.&quot; He likened Fletcher to Bobby Charlton, noting that he &quot;can get games by the scruff of the neck and inject pace and tempo,&quot; also adding that &quot;[h]e understands the game, reads it well, is improving all the time and United rely heavily on him.&quot; While Fletcher was initially criticised in the media for his poor positional sense, a lack of creativity in his game, and his tendency to give possession away carelessly early on in his career, he underwent a technical and tactical development, which enabled him establish himself successfully in a deeper midfield role, from which he could dictate the tempo of his team&#x27;s play in midfield with his passing; his playing style in this position was influenced by one of his idols, Fernando Redondo.

In May 2020, former teammate Rooney cited Fletcher as an important member of the successful 2006–09 United side, describing him as being as &quot;vital&quot; to the team as himself, Cristiano Ronaldo, and Carlos Tevez, and saying he sacrificed his own individual acclaim for the team.

==Personal life==
Fletcher was born and grew up in Mayfield, Midlothian.

He is the father of twin boys, Jack and Tyler (born 2007) with his wife, Hayley Grice. The couple married in early June 2010. Jack and Tyler are both in the Manchester United academy, having transferred from the Manchester City academy in July 2023. They were both selected for the Scotland under-16 squad in August 2022, but later that season Jack was picked by the England under-16 squad and the two brothers played in a match against each other in February 2023.

Fletcher was one of many footballers in the Manchester and Liverpool area whose homes were burgled while playing away games; burglars raided his house in February 2009 and held Grice at knifepoint. The incident occurred while Fletcher was in Milan for Manchester United&#x27;s Champions League fixture against Inter Milan.

Fletcher is involved in a programme to encourage &quot;Deaf Friendly Football&quot; for youngsters. The programme is run by the Manchester United Foundation and the National Deaf Children&#x27;s Society.

In 2014 Fletcher became an ambassador for the charity Crohn&#x27;s and Colitis UK after recovering from surgery for ulcerative colitis.

Fletcher is teetotal.

<text>Homelands was a music festival run by Mean Fiddler Music Group (now known as Festival Republic) which consisted mainly of dance music, both live acts and DJs. The festival was held in locations in England, Scotland and Ireland in the period 1999 to 2005. The organisers of Homelands were also behind the Home Nightclubs chain including Home nightclub in London and Sydney.

The English festivals were held at Cheesefoot Head near Winchester, Hampshire, and was one of the most popular British festivals of this genre. 

The Scottish festivals were held in Royal Highland Showground near Edinburgh in 1999, and was held close to New Cumnock in the south of Scotland in 2000.

The Irish festivals were held at the Mosney Holiday Center in County Meath in both 1999 and 2000.

She was a member of the Estonian Reform Party from 1995 till 5 June 2013 and from 2009 to 2014 she served as one of the six Estonian MEPs in the European Parliament. She was expelled from the Reform Party because of alleged vote rigging on 5 June 2013. She later founded the Party of People&#x27;s Unity, which failed to gain any seats in the 2015 and 2019 parliamentary election.

In 1994 she moved into politics, becoming a member of the Riigikogu and the parliament&#x27;s Foreign Affairs Committee, as well as chair of the Estonian-French parliamentary friendship group from 1996. She joined the Estonian Reform Party in 1995, becoming their Foreign Affairs Spokesperson. With the party&#x27;s affiliation to the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party (ELDR), she rose to the post of Vice President in 1999, as well as Leader of the LDR group in the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe (PACE), to which she had been head of the Estonian Parliamentary Delegation since 1996.

Ojuland was the Estonian minister of foreign affairs from 2002 to 2005, when she was fired by President Arnold Ruutel after secret files disappeared from her ministry. She chaired the European Affairs Committee of the Riigikogu from 2004-07. In June 2004 she ran for the post of secretary-general of the Council of Europe, but was defeated, receiving 51 of 299 votes. She was the first vice-speaker of the parliament from 2007 to 2009, at which point she became a Member of the European Parliament for the ALDE. From 2007 to 2014 she was the Vice President of the ELDR and Vice-chair of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe in the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe.

<doc id="767737" wikidata="Q547523" url="?curid=767737" title="LANTIRN">
<text>LANTIRN (Low Altitude Navigation and Targeting Infrared for Night) is a combined navigation and targeting pod system for use on the United States Air Force fighter aircraft—the F-15E Strike Eagle and F-16 Fighting Falcon (Block 40/42 C &amp; D models) manufactured by Martin Marietta (Lockheed Martin after the 1995 merger). LANTIRN significantly increases the combat effectiveness of these aircraft, allowing them to fly at low altitudes, at night and under-the-weather to attack ground targets with a variety of precision-guided weapons.

==Features==
LANTIRN consists of a navigation pod and a targeting pod mounted externally beneath the aircraft.

===AN/AAQ-13 navigation pod===
The AN/AAQ-13 navigation pod provides high-speed penetration and precision attack on tactical targets at night and in adverse weather. The navigation pod contains a terrain-following radar and a fixed thermographic camera, which provides a visual cue and input to the aircraft&#x27;s flight control system, enabling it to maintain a pre-selected altitude above the terrain and avoid obstacles. This sensor displays an infrared image of the terrain in front of the aircraft, to the pilot, on a Head-up display. The navigation pod enables the pilot to fly along the general contour of the terrain at high speed, using mountains, valleys and the cover of darkness to avoid detection. The pod was the USAF&#x27;s first wide-field, forward looking infrared navigation system for air superiority fighters. A downgraded version for export with the terrain-following radar deleted is designated as the AN/AAQ-20 Pathfinder, which is only capable of providing a visual cue/picture of ground features in darkness and adverse weather generated by the infrared sensor, and pilots must rely on their own skill to avoid ground obstacles at low altitude flight.

===AN/AAQ-14 targeting pod===
The AN/AAQ-14 targeting pod contains a high-resolution, forward looking infrared sensor (which displays an infrared image of the target to the pilot), a laser designator/rangefinder for precise delivery of laser-guided munitions, a missile boresight correlator for automatic lock-on of the AGM-65 Maverick imaging infrared missiles, and software for automatic target tracking. These features simplify the functions of target detection, recognition and attack and permit pilots of single-seat fighters to attack targets with precision-guided weapons on a single pass. A downgraded version for export with the AGM-65 Maverick air-to-ground missile compatibility deleted is designated as AN/AAQ-19 Sharpshooter.

==Background==
The research and development program began in September 1980 with Martin Marietta Corp. (now Lockheed Martin), Orlando, FL, as contractor. Initial operational test and evaluation of the LANTIRN navigation pod was successfully completed in December 1984. The Air Force approved low-rate initial production of the navigation pod in March 1985 and full-rate production in November 1986. The first production pod was delivered to the Air Force March 31, 1987. LANTIRN represented a major advance in the U.S. military&#x27;s ability to carry out operations in darkness and adverse weather, and has been developed further into its successor, the AN/AAQ-33 Sniper pod.

==LANTIRN and the F-14 Tomcat==
Until the early 1990s, the F-14 Tomcat didn&#x27;t have clearance to drop bombs even though all Tomcats were built with a Stores Management System (SMS) that included air-to-ground options as well as rudimentary software in the AWG-9. Early flight clearance work to clear the aircraft for air-to-ground were suspended due to development delays with the F-14 and it being shifted away from the air to ground mission. At the time, the Tomcat was so expensive (and lacked proper defensive electronic countermeasures (&quot;DECM&quot;) and radar homing and warning (&quot;RHAW&quot;) for overland operations) that the Navy did not want to risk it in the air-to-ground role. However, the TARPS mission had proven the Tomcat was survivable overland and upgrades to the Tomcat&#x27;s DECM, expendables and RHAW gear were developed to increase its survivability. With the end of the Cold War and de-emphasis on the Fleet Air Defense mission, NAVAIR had renewed flight clearance work before Desert Storm so the F-14 could carry gravity bombs as well as laser-guided bombs if the target was lased by another jet (first Tomcat LGB drop in combat was made by VF-41 in 1995 during operations over Bosnia with an A-6 Intruder providing the requisite target illumination). Meanwhile, the decision had been made by Chief of Naval Operations (OPNAV) to retire the A-6 altogether and allow the F-14 Block 1 Strike variant to take over as the precision strike platform for the air wing. However, the $1.6B Block 1 Strike program was canceled in budgetary cuts by 1994 with only enough funding to integrate the JDAM, which was years away. In late 1994, an unsolicited proposal from Martin Marietta was initiated to demonstrate how a USAF LANTIRN targeting pod could be rapidly integrated onto the Tomcat. This effort was done under the auspices of Commander, Naval Air Forces Atlantic Fleet (COMNAVAIRLANT) using a fleet aircraft to integrate the digital 1553-based pod on an analog F-14B. In March 1995 a VF-103 fleet aircraft successfully dropped the first laser-guided training rounds (LGTR) and quickly laser-guided bombs (LGB). Due to the early success and interest from Fleet Commanders, NAVAIR began to procure pods and control units for deployment, resulting in VF-103 receiving the first LANTIRN pod June 14, 1996 in time for its upcoming deployment.

The basic LANTIRN was modified into LANTIRN Targeting System (LTS), the navigation pod was removed from the two-pod system and the targeting pod was improved for Tomcat use. The LTS featured a Global Positioning System and inertial measurement unit that provided the pod line-of-sight cueing and weapon release ballistics and eliminated the need for external cumbersome and time-consuming boresight equipment.

Unlike the early versions, the LTS performed all weapon release calculations and presented release cues that it had generated to the aircrew. The LTS also had a masking avoidance curve display (preventing firing the laser at the jet) and eventually a north orientation curve and 12,200 m (40,000 ft) capable laser. The latter became very useful allowing F-14s to employ LGBs above potential threat systems and it came into its own in the higher terrain in Afghanistan during Operation Enduring Freedom.

The LTS could also generate coordinates for any target located on the FLIR, and a latter software modification, known as T3 (Tomcat Tactical Targeting) increased the accuracy of the coordinates produced by the LTS and allowed generated coordinates for GPS/INS guided weapons (JDAM, JSOW and WCMD). The first combat use of this was during Operation Enduring Freedom when an F-14 generated coordinates for a B-52 that dropped a CBU-103 WCMD from over . These weapons scored hits on a vehicle convoy that had stopped after the first vehicle was destroyed by the Tomcat with LGBs.

The pod also featured an internal computer with ballistics data for the various precision munitions carried by the F-14. Data is fed to the pod by the Tomcat&#x27;s AWG-9 (F-14A and F-14B) and AN/APG-71 (F-14D) radar, but the LTS in turn only sends video and guidance symbology to the crew&#x27;s cockpit displays. This means that few wiring and software changes had to be made to the Tomcat in order for it to operate the LTS. All pod controls are in the RIO&#x27;s cockpit, but the bomb release button is situated with the pilot. The LTS had a price tag of around 3 million US Dollars each and due to these high costs, only 75 were bought for fleet use. Typically, an F-14 squadron brought 6 to 8 pods with them on deployment, which would be permanently fitted to the non-TARPS jets.

The first combat use of the LTS was in December 1998 during Operation Desert Fox by VF-32.

<text>Cyd Charisse (born Tula Ellice Finklea; March 8, 1922 – June 17, 2008) was an American dancer and actress.

After recovering from polio as a child and studying ballet, Charisse entered films in the 1940s. Her roles usually featured her abilities as a dancer, and she was often paired with Fred Astaire or Gene Kelly. Her films included &quot;Singin&#x27; in the Rain&quot; (1952), &quot;The Band Wagon&quot; (1953), &quot;Brigadoon&quot; (1954), and &quot;Silk Stockings&quot; (1957). She stopped dancing in films in the late 1950s, but continued acting in film and television, and in 1991 made her Broadway debut. In her later years, she discussed the history of the Hollywood musical in documentaries, and was featured in &quot;That&#x27;s Entertainment! III&quot; in 1994. She was awarded the National Medal of the Arts and Humanities in 2006.

==Early life==
Cyd Charisse was born Tula Ellice Finklea in Amarillo, Texas, the daughter of Lela (née Norwood) and Ernest Enos Finklea Sr., who was a jeweler. Her nickname &quot;Sid&quot; was taken from her older brother Ernest E. Finklea Jr., who as a child pronounced it like that when he’d say &quot;Sis&quot;. It was later given the spelling of &quot;Cyd&quot; by Arthur Freed.

She was a sickly girl who started dancing lessons at six to build up her strength after a bout of polio. At 12, she studied ballet in Los Angeles with Adolph Bolm and Bronislava Nijinska, and at 14, she auditioned for and subsequently danced in the Ballet Russe de Monte-Carlo as &quot;Felia Siderova&quot; and, later, &quot;Maria Istomina&quot;. She was educated at the Hollywood Professional School.

During a European tour, she met up again with Nico Charisse, a young dancer she had studied with for a time in Los Angeles. They married in Paris in 1939 and had a son, Nicky.

==Career==

===Early films===
Charisse appeared uncredited in some films like &quot;Escort Girl&quot; (1941) and was in a short for Warner Bros, &quot;The Gay Parisian&quot; (1942).

The outbreak of World War II led to the breakup of the ballet company, and when Charisse returned to Los Angeles, David Lichine offered her a dancing role in Gregory Ratoff&#x27;s &quot;Something to Shout About&quot; (1943) at Columbia. This brought her to the attention of choreographer Robert Alton—who had also discovered Gene Kelly—and soon she joined the Freed Unit at Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, where she became the resident MGM ballet dancer.

===Early MGM roles===
Charisse made some uncredited appearances in &quot;Mission to Moscow&quot; (1943) (as a ballet dancer) and &quot;Thousands Cheer&quot; (1943). She was borrowed by Warners for &quot;In Our Time&quot; (1944), playing a ballerina.

She was a ballerina in &quot;Ziegfeld Follies&quot; (produced in 1944 and released in 1946), dancing with Fred Astaire. Feedback was positive and Charisse was given her first speaking part supporting Judy Garland in the 1946 film &quot;The Harvey Girls&quot;.

She followed it with &quot;Three Wise Fools&quot; (1946) and she danced with Gower Champion to &quot;Smoke Gets in Your Eyes&quot; in &quot;Till the Clouds Roll By&quot; (1946). She also had a supporting role in the Esther Williams musical &quot;Fiesta&quot; (1947).

===Rising fame===
Charisse was second billed in &quot;The Unfinished Dance&quot; (1947) with Margaret O&#x27;Brien but the film was a box office flop. She had a good supporting part in &quot;On an Island with You&quot; (1948) with Williams and danced in &quot;The Kissing Bandit&quot; (1948). She had a supporting part in &quot;Words and Music&quot; (1948).

Charisse was given another opportunity in a &quot;B&quot; movie, &quot;Tension&quot; (1950), where she was third billed, but it was a box office disappointment. She was billed fifth in the prestigious &quot;East Side, West Side&quot; (1949) and was borrowed by Universal to play the female lead in &quot;The Mark of the Renegade&quot; (1951).

Back at MGM Charisse was the leading lady in &quot;The Wild North&quot; (1951) with Stewart Granger, which was a huge hit. Because Debbie Reynolds was not a trained dancer, Kelly chose Charisse to partner with him in the celebrated &quot;Broadway Melody&quot; ballet finale from &quot;Singin&#x27; in the Rain&quot; (1952), which was acknowledged soon after release as one of the greatest musicals of all time.

===Stardom===

Charisse had a significant role in &quot;Sombrero&quot; (1953) as well as the lead female role in &quot;The Band Wagon&quot; (1953), where she danced with Astaire in the acclaimed &quot;Dancing in the Dark&quot; and &quot;Girl Hunt Ballet&quot; routines. Vincente Minnelli directed. Critic Pauline Kael said that &quot;when the bespangled Charisse wraps her phenomenal legs around Astaire, she can be forgiven everything, even her three minutes of &#x27;classical&#x27; ballet and the fact that she reads her lines as if she learned them phonetically.&quot; The film was another classic but lost money for MGM.

Charisse had a cameo in &quot;Easy to Love&quot; (1953) then co-starred with Kelly in the Scottish-themed musical film &quot;Brigadoon&quot; (1954), directed by Minnelli. It was a box office disappointment. She again took the lead female role (alongside Kelly) in his MGM musical &quot;It&#x27;s Always Fair Weather&quot; (1955), which lost money. In between she made an appearance in &quot;Deep in My Heart&quot; (1954).

Charisse co-starred with Dan Dailey in &quot;Meet Me in Las Vegas&quot; (1956), which earned 3.7 million dollars at the box office, with production costs of 2.4 million dollars. She rejoined Astaire in the film version of &quot;Silk Stockings&quot; (1957), a musical remake of 1939&#x27;s &quot;Ninotchka&quot;, with Charisse taking over Greta Garbo&#x27;s role. Astaire paid tribute to Charisse in his autobiography, calling her &quot;beautiful dynamite&quot; and writing: &quot;That Cyd! When you&#x27;ve danced with her you stay danced with.&quot; The film was well received but lost money for MGM.

In her autobiography, Charisse reflected on her experience with Astaire and Kelly:

:As one of the handful of girls who worked with both of those dance geniuses, I think I can give an honest comparison. In my opinion, Kelly is the more inventive choreographer of the two. Astaire, with Hermes Pan&#x27;s help, creates fabulous numbers—for himself and his partner. But Kelly can create an entire number for somebody else ... I think, however, that Astaire&#x27;s coordination is better than Kelly&#x27;s ... his sense of rhythm is uncanny. Kelly, on the other hand, is the stronger of the two. When he lifts you, he lifts you! ... To sum it up, I&#x27;d say they were the two greatest dancing personalities who were ever on screen. But it&#x27;s like comparing apples and oranges. They&#x27;re both delicious.

Charisse had a slightly unusual serious acting role in &quot;Party Girl&quot; (1958), where she played a showgirl who became involved with gangsters and a crooked lawyer, although it did include two dance routines. It was far more profitable for MGM than her musicals.

She went to Universal to co-star with Rock Hudson in &quot;Twilight for the Gods&quot; (1958).

MGM wanted Charisse for the role of Eve Kendall in 1959&#x27;s North by Northwest, but Alfred Hitchcock wanted Eva Marie Saint.

===1960s===

After the decline of the Hollywood musical in the late 1950s, Charisse retired from dancing but continued to appear in film and TV productions from the 1960s through the 1990s. She went to Europe to make &quot;Five Golden Hours&quot; (1961) and Minnelli&#x27;s &quot;Two Weeks in Another Town&quot;.

She had a supporting role in &quot;Something&#x27;s Got to Give&quot; (1962), the last, unfinished film of Marilyn Monroe. She did &quot;Assassination in Rome&quot; (1965) in Italy.

A striptease number by Charisse set to the movie&#x27;s theme song opened the 1966 Dean Martin spy spoof, &quot;The Silencers&quot;, and she played a fashion magazine editor in the 1967 caper film &quot;Maroc 7&quot;.

She frequently performed dance numbers on TV variety series such as &quot;The Ed Sullivan Show&quot; and &quot;The Dean Martin Show&quot;, with seven appearances on &quot;The Hollywood Palace&quot;, a show she also hosted three times. She did &quot;Fol-de-Rol&quot; in 1968, which was filmed and broadcast in 1972.

===1970s and 1980s===
In the 1970s and 1980s Charisse guest-starred on shows such as &quot;Medical Center&quot;, &quot;Hawaii Five-O&quot;, &quot;The Love Boat&quot;, &quot;Fantasy Island&quot;, &quot;The Fall Guy&quot;, &quot;Glitter&quot;, &quot;Murder, She Wrote&quot;, and &quot;Crazy Like a Fox&quot;.

She had a cameo in &quot;Won Ton Ton, the Dog Who Saved Hollywood&quot; (1976) and played Atsil, an Atlantean high priestess, in the 1978 fantasy film &quot;Warlords of Atlantis&quot;.

Charisse was in the TV movies &quot;Portrait of an Escort&quot; (1980) and &quot;Swimsuit&quot; (1989).

She also made cameo appearances in Blue Mercedes&#x27;s &quot;I Want to Be Your Property&quot; (1987) and Janet Jackson&#x27;s &quot;Alright&quot; (1990) music videos.

===Later career===
Charisse appeared on Broadway from late 1991 as a replacement for Liliane Montevecchi in &quot;Grand Hotel&quot;. Her last film appearance was in 1994 in &quot;That&#x27;s Entertainment! III&quot; as one of the onscreen narrators of a tribute to the great MGM musical films. She also appeared in episodes of &quot;Burke&#x27;s Law&quot; and &quot;Frasier&quot; in 1995 before retiring from acting. Subsequently, she made a final appearance in the TV movie &quot;Empire State Building Murders&quot;, which aired two months after her death in 2008.

==Later years==
In 1976, Charisse and her husband Tony Martin wrote their joint memoirs with Dick Kleiner entitled &quot;The Two of Us&quot; (1976). In 1990, following similar moves by MGM colleagues Debbie Reynolds and Angela Lansbury, Charisse produced the exercise video &quot;Easy Energy Shape Up&quot;, targeted for active senior citizens. She made her Broadway debut in 1989 in the musical version of &quot;Grand Hotel&quot; as the aging ballerina, Elizaveta Grushinskaya. In her eighties, Charisse made occasional public appearances and appeared frequently in documentaries spotlighting the golden age of Hollywood.

She was featured in the 2001 &quot;Guinness Book of World Records&quot; under &quot;Most Valuable Legs&quot;, because a $5 million insurance policy was reportedly issued on her legs in 1952.

==Personal life==
Charisse&#x27;s first husband, whose surname she kept, was Greek-born Nico Charisse; they were married in 1939 and had a son, Nico &quot;Nicky&quot; Charisse, before divorcing in 1947. In 1948, Charisse married singer Tony Martin, and remained married to him until her death in 2008. They had a son, Tony Martin Jr.

Her daughter-in-law is actress and model Liv Lindeland, who was married to Tony Martin Jr. until his death in 2011. Sheila Charisse, another daughter-in-law and the wife of Nicky Charisse, her son from her first marriage to Nico, died in the crash of American Airlines Flight 191 on May 25, 1979. Charisse, like her husband Tony Martin Sr., was a staunch Republican and campaigned for Barry Goldwater in the 1964 United States presidential election and Richard Nixon in 1968. She was the aunt of the actress Nana Visitor.

Charisse was admitted to Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles, California on June 16, 2008, after suffering an apparent heart attack. She died the following day at age 86. She was a practicing Methodist, but due to her husband&#x27;s religion she was buried at Hillside Memorial Park Cemetery, a Jewish cemetery in Culver City, California, following a Methodist ceremony.

==Honors==

On November 9, 2006, in a private White House ceremony, President George W. Bush presented Cyd Charisse with the National Medal of the Arts and Humanities, the highest official U.S. honor available in the arts.

<text>GuilFest, formerly the Guildford Festival of Folk and Blues, is an annual music festival held in Stoke Park, Guildford, England. The festival, like the larger Glastonbury Festival, features a range of genres including rock, folk, blues, and in recent years pop. In 2006 GuilFest was awarded the title of &quot;Best Family Festival&quot; in the UK Festival awards. Following a 10-year hiatus from 2014, GuilFest returned to Stoke Park in summer 2024.

==Insolvency==
After 21 years, GuilFest shut down. Scotty Events Ltd, the company that ran the festival, said matters were in the hands of an insolvency practitioner. Tony Scott, from Scotty Events, said the company had been left with debts of about £300,000. He said the company&#x27;s debts included payments to cover tax, VAT, PAYE, Surrey Police, Guildford Borough Council and private individuals.

Reasons cited by organisers included the abundance of competing major events in that year, most notably the London Olympics. Poor weather also contributed with the rain turning Stoke Park into a &quot;quagmire by Saturday – and by Sunday it had turned into sticky bog&quot;.

To fill the gap, for 2013 the Magic FM &quot;Summer Of Love&quot; event was held at Stoke Park on the weekend of 13–14 July 2013, headlined by Jamiroquai and Bryan Adams. A rival event, free festival GU1, took place the same weekend at the Holroyd Arms, a Guildford pub, in protest at what organisers saw as the &quot;corporate takeover&quot; of the former Guilfest by Magic FM&#x27;s promoters Live Nation. The line-up included The Feathers, Louise Distras, Shakespearos, Anarchistwood, The Unbelievable Freeloaders From Mars, P45, Unexpected Item In The Bagging Area, Archive 45, Gobsausage, Black Anchor, Collage of Sound, Snork and Kerb.

GuilFest returned in 2014 after permission was given quite late for an event this size in January of the same year, with conditions imposed by the local council. Unfortunately despite reports of it being one of the best festivals the organisers had run, it went into insolvency again shortly afterwards blaming a bad weather forecast, leading to low ticket sales.

==Revival==
Eight years passed before GuilFest returned again, still being run by Tony Scott, on 16–17 July 2022 at a new location, Hurtwood Polo Club, in Cranleigh. This was headlined by Peter Hook and Sister Sledge.

Although a much smaller event, 2022 enabled the festival to gear up for its return to Stoke Park in 2024, and a surprise announcement was made in December 2023 with the line-up.

<text>The Comptroller of the Treasury was an official of the United States Department of the Treasury from 1789 to 1817. According to section III of the Act of Congress establishing the Treasury Department, it is the comptroller&#x27;s duty to

:&quot;superintend the adjustment and preservation of the public accounts; to examine all accounts settled by the Auditor, and certify the balances arising thereon to the Register; to countersign all warrants drawn by the Secretary of the Treasury, which shall be warranted by law; to report to the Secretary the official forms of all papers to be issued in the different offices for collecting the public revenue, and the manner and form of keeping and stating the accounts of the several persons employed therein. He shall moreover provide for the regular and punctual payment of all monies which may be collected, and shall direct prosecutions for all delinquencies of officers of the revenue, and for debts that are, or shall be due to the United States.&quot;

The first person to hold this office was Nicholas Eveleigh. It was also held for a time by Gabriel Duvall, who would later serve on the Supreme Court of the United States. The office was later several times renamed. It was the First Comptroller of the Treasury (1817–20), the Agent of the Treasury (1820–30), and [[Solicitor of the United States Treasury|Solicitor of the Treasury]] (1830–1934), and is now the [[Office of the General Counsel for the Department of the Treasury|Office of the General Counsel]].

<text>Aveton Gifford is a small rural village in the south of the English county of Devon. It lies at the head of the estuary of the River Avon or Aune, at the point where it is crossed by the A379 road. It receives its name from this river and also from the family of Giffard who held the manor. Walter Giffard came across with William the Conqueror and helped with the Domesday Book.

The village is located in the South Hams district of Devon and is bounded by Modbury, Bigbury, Thurlestone, Churchstow and Loddiswell.

In the 2001 census the parish had a population of 772, rising to 833 at the 2011 census. There is currently a pub, a community village shop/post office, a primary school, a pre-school and a selection of parish organisations. The village is a major part of the electoral ward of Charterlands. This ward also includes Bigbury. Its population at the abovementioned census was 1,951.

==Geography==
The parish comprises an area of hills and valleys and in addition to the River Avon there are numerous smaller watercourses which have shaped the land. In common with the surrounding parishes Aveton Gifford contains a wide variety of plant and animal life and there is much to see for the visitor with an interest in wildlife. Within the area there are a number of footpaths and bridleways and for nature lovers a walk or ride along them is usually well rewarded at any time of year.

South Efford Marsh, a nature reserve of Devon Wildlife Trust, is by the river estuary near the village.

==Church==
The parish church of St Andrew was described by W. G. Hoskins as &#x27;one of the oldest and most interesting churches in Devon&#x27;. It was largely a cruciform building with a central tower and was completed in around 1250. In 1942 it was said to be &#x27;well cared for&#x27; in the church log: the following year it was almost destroyed in a raid by a group of German fighter bombers. The church was rebuilt by 1957 but subsequent structural problems led to the tower being reduced to two thirds of its original height. However the two-story porch survived, along with its richly moulded thirteenth-century doorways.

==Village shop==
The last privately owned shop in the village closed in 2003. Shortly afterwards, with the support of the Parish Council the Aveton Gifford Village Shop Association was formed and a community-owned shop subsequently opened in temporary premises. Following extensive fund raising efforts the store was transferred to a purpose built timber-framed building which opened for business in August 2009.

==History==
The area has a long history. There are indications that it was occupied in Neolithic times. At least three manors within the parish were recorded in the Domesday Book in 1086 (Avetone, Heathfield and Stadbury). The bridge across the River Avon is believed to have been completed in around 1440; there have been a number of quays on the river and these have been used for the products of the local lime kilns, to bring goods from Plymouth and later for bringing coal to the village.

During its history the Avon has seen much fishing and not a little poaching and has provided a source of power to various mills.

Regular buses come through along with the school bus to the local Kingsbridge Community College every morning and evening.

<doc id="767763" wikidata="Q1483744" url="?curid=767763" title="Fusilier">
<text>Fusilier is a name given to various kinds of soldiers; its meaning depends on the historical context. While &quot;fusilier&quot; is derived from the 17th-century French word – meaning a type of flintlock musket – the term has been used in contrasting ways in different countries and at different times, including soldiers guarding artillery, various elite units, ordinary line infantry and other uses.

== Derivation of the word ==
The word &quot;fusil&quot;, which was the name of the type of musket carried by a fusilier, is itself derived from the Old French and Latin , meaning a piece of flint.

==History==

Flintlock small arms were first used militarily during the early 17th century. Flintlocks, at the time, were more reliable and safer to use than matchlock muskets, which required a match to be lit near the breech before the weapon could be triggered. By contrast, flintlocks were fired using a piece of flint. By the time of the English Civil War (1642–1652), one flintlock musket, the snaphance, was in common use in Britain.

The term &quot;fusiliers&quot; was first used officially by the French Army in 1670, when four fusiliers were distributed among each company of infantry. The following year the (&quot;King&#x27;s Fusiliers&quot;), the first regiment composed primarily of soldiers with flintlocks, was formed by Sébastien Le Prestre de Vauban.

Guarding and escorting artillery pieces was the first task assigned to the : flintlocks were especially useful around field artillery, as they were less likely than matchlocks to accidentally ignite open barrels of gunpowder, required at the time to load cannon. At the time, artillery units also required guards to maintain discipline amongst civilian draymen. Hence the term fusilier became strongly associated with the role of guarding artillery in Britain and the English-speaking world, especially after the formation of the first official &quot;Fusilier&quot; units, during the 1680s. As late as the Seven Years&#x27; War of 1756–1763, the Austrian Army maintained an Artillery Fusilier Regiment for the exclusive roles of providing support for field batteries on the battlefield and of protecting the artillery when on the march and in camp.

During the 18th century, as flintlocks became the main weapon used by infantry, the term fusilier gradually ceased to have this meaning and was applied to various units.

==Fusiliers by country==
===Belgium===
The Belgian Army has no specific regiment called fusiliers, but the general denomination for infantry soldiers is &quot;storm fusilier&quot; (; ).

The Belgian Navy used to have a regiment of marine infantry composed of in charge of the protection of the naval bases. However this unit was disbanded in the 1990s reforms.

===Brazil===
Adopting a number of practices from the Portuguese military in the 19th century, the Brazilian Army uses the term (fusiliers) to designate the regular line infantry, as opposed to the grenadiers () and the light infantry ( and ). In addition, the Brazilian Marine Corps is called (Naval Fusiliers).

===Canada===
There are five fusilier regiments, patterned on the British tradition, in the Canadian Army. The Royal 22nd Regiment, although not fusiliers, wears fusilier ceremonial uniform with scarlet plumes, because of its alliance with the Royal Welch Fusiliers.

The five current Canadian fusilier regiments are:
*The Royal Highland Fusiliers of Canada (which wears Highland uniform, but with white fusilier hackles on balmoral bonnets)
*, white plume
*, white plume
*The Princess Louise Fusiliers (which wear a grey hackle as a token of their alliance with the Royal Inniskilling Fusiliers, now part of the Royal Irish Regiment)
*, white plume

Former Canadian Army fusilier regiments include the following:

* The Irish Fusiliers of Canada (The Vancouver Regiment) existed in Vancouver, British Columbia, and served in the Canadian Army from 1913 until 1965 when it was reduced to nil strength and placed on the Supplementary Order of Battle. In 2002, it was taken off the Supplementary Order of Battle and amalgamated with the British Columbia Regiment (Duke of Connaught&#x27;s Own).
* The Canadian Grenadier Guards in Montreal were known as the 1st Regiment &quot;Prince of Wales&#x27; Fusiliers&quot; before 1911.
* The Canadian Fusiliers (City of London Regiment) existed in London, Ontario, from 1866 until 1954 when they were amalgamated with The Oxford Rifles and became the London and Oxford Fusiliers (3rd Battalion, The Royal Canadian Regiment) – now the 4th Battalion, The Royal Canadian Regiment.
* The Essex Scottish Regiment of Windsor, Ontario were first known as the Essex Fusiliers from 1887 until 1927. In 1954, they were amalgamated with The Kent Regiment to form The Essex and Kent Scottish.
* The Northern Pioneers when first raised in Parry Sound, Ontario in 1903 were first known as the 23rd Regiment &quot;Northern Fusiliers&quot; until they were renamed a year later. They now form part of The Algonquin Regiment (Northern Pioneers).
*The Saint John Fusiliers existed in Saint John, New Brunswick, from 1872 until 1946 when they were amalgamated with The New Brunswick Rangers to become The New Brunswick Scottish. They now form part of The Royal New Brunswick Regiment.
* The 88th Regiment (Victoria Fusiliers) existed in Victoria, British Columbia, from 1912 until 1920 when they amalgamated with the 50th Regiment (Gordon Highlanders of Canada) to become The Canadian Scottish Regiment (Princess Mary&#x27;s).
*The 105th Regiment (Saskatoon Fusiliers) existed in Saskatoon from 1912 until 1920 when they were amalgamated with the 52nd Regiment Prince Albert Volunteers to form The North Saskatchewan Regiment (1920–1924). In 1924, The North Saskatchewan Regiment was later reorganised into four separate regiments: The Yorkton Regiment (now the 64th Field Battery, RCA), The Saskatoon Light Infantry, The Prince Albert Volunteers and The Battleford Light Infantry. They now form part of The North Saskatchewan Regiment.
*The Scots Fusiliers of Canada existed in Kitchener, Ontario, from 1914 until 1965 when they amalgamated with the Highland Light Infantry of Canada to form The Highland Fusiliers of Canada – later renamed as the Royal Highland Fusiliers of Canada (see above).

===France===

By the mid-18th century, the French Army used the term &quot;fusiliers&quot; to designate ordinary line infantry, as opposed to specialist or élite infantry, such as &quot;grenadiers&quot;, , or .

The modern French Army no longer uses the term &quot;fusiliers&quot;, although a number of its infantry regiments descend from fusilier regiments.

The term &quot;fusiliers&quot; is still used in the navy and air force. They provide protection detachments, performing security and policing duties on land bases and installations as well as on ships. The commandos are selected from their ranks. The commandos are special forces units. They are:
*French Navy: (FORFUSCO)
*French Air Force: 

===Germany===

Prussia made early use of the title for various types of infantry. In 1705, the Foot Guards () were designated as Fusilier Guards. By 1837, low-quality infantry raised from garrison companies also were named fusiliers. These latter units were dressed in blue with low mitre caps. Between 1740 and 1743 Frederick the Great raised 14 separate Fusilier Regiments (numbers 33–40, 41–43 and 45–48). Except for the mitre caps, these new regiments were identical in appearance, training and role to the existing line infantry (musketeers).

Subsequently, Prussia and several other German states used the designation to denote a type of light infantry, usually dressed in green and acting as skirmishers. In the Prussian Army, they had been formed in 1787 as independent battalions, with many of the officers having had experience in the American Revolutionary War. The Prussian reforms of 1808 absorbed the fusiliers into the third battalion of each line infantry regiment. Now wearing the same Prussian blue uniforms as standard musketeers, they were distinguished by black leather belts, and a slightly different arrangement of cartridge pouches.

In the Prussian Army of 1870, Infantry Regiments 33 to 40 plus Regiments 73 (Hanover), 80 (Hesse-Kassel) and 86 (Schleswig-Holstein) were all designated as fusiliers, as was the Guard Fusilier Regiment. In addition, the third battalions of all guard, grenadier and line infantry regiments retained the designation &#x27;Fusilier Battalion&#x27;. They were armed with a slightly shorter version of the Dreyse rifle (), that took a sword bayonet () rather than the standard socket bayonet. Although still theoretically skirmishers, in practice they differed little from their compatriots, as all Prussian infantry fought in a style that formed a dense &#x27;firing&#x27; or &#x27;skirmish&#x27; line.

By the 1880s, the title was honorific and, while implying &#x27;specialist&#x27; or &#x27;elite&#x27;, did not have any tactical significance. In a sense, all infantry were becoming fusiliers, as weapons, tactics and equipment took on the fusilier characteristics – that is: skirmish line, shorter rifles, sword bayonets, black leather equipment, and the use of bugles (rather than drums) to relay commands. Nonetheless, these titular units remained in existence until the end of the German Imperial Army in 1918, as follows:

*Guard Fusilier Regiment
*Fusilier Regiment Count Roon (East Prussian) No. 33
*Fusilier Regiment Queen Victoria of Sweden (Pomeranian) No. 34
*Fusilier Regiment Prince Henry of Prussia (Brandenburg) No. 35
*Fusilier Regiment General Field Marshal Count Blumenthal (Magdeburg) No. 36
*Fusilier Regiment von Steinmetz (West Prussian) No. 37
*Fusilier Regiment Field Marshal Count Moltke (Silesian) No. 38
*Lower Rhineland Fusilier Regiment No. 39
*Fusilier Regiment Prince Charles Anton of Hohenzollern No. 40
*Fusilier Regiment Field Marshal Prince Albert of Prussia (Hanoverian) No. 73
*Fusilier Regiment von Gerdsdorff (Electoral Hessian) No. 80
*Fusilier Regiment Queen (Schleswig-Holstein) No. 86
*Grand-Ducal Mecklenburg Fusilier Regiment No. 90
*Fusilier Regiment Emperor Francis Joseph of Austria King of Hungary (4th Royal) Württemberg No. 122

In addition, there was the following regiment:

*Royal Saxon (Fusilier) Regiment Prince George No. 108

This was a special case, as it was also classed as (sharpshooter): this designation originally signified a type of (rifleman, literally &#x27;hunter&#x27;), and thus the regiment wore the -style dark green uniform.

The various Fusilier regiments and battalions in the German Imperial Army of 1914 did not have any single distinctions of dress or equipment to distinguish them as fusiliers. Individual regiments did, however, have special features worn with the dark blue full dress. Some of these features were maintained on the field grey dress of the trenches right up to 1918. As examples in full dress, the Guard Fusiliers had nickel buttons and yellow shoulder straps, and the 80th Fusiliers special braiding on collars and cuffs (deriving from their origin as the Elector of Hesse&#x27;s Guards). When a regiment was permitted the distinction of a horse-hair plume on the pickelhaube, for fusiliers it was always black. This included the third (Fusilier) Battalion of those regiments normally distinguished by a white horse-hair plume.

In World War II, the elite German Division contained a regiment titled (&#x27;Armoured Fusiliers&#x27;), to maintain the old German traditions. This was again titular, as in organisation, appearance and tactical use they were essentially . The modern German Army has no fusiliers.

===Mexico===
On 1 January 1969, the Mexican Army created the Parachute Fusilier Brigade () with two infantry battalions and a training battalion. The brigade&#x27;s role is that of a strategic reserve, based in Mexico City.

===Netherlands===
In the Royal Netherlands Army, one of the two foot guards regiments, the , is a regiment of fusiliers.

===Portugal===

From the 18th to the 19th centuries, the term (fusiliers) was used in the Portuguese Army, to designate the regular line infantry, as opposed to the grenadiers () and the light infantry ( and ). The Portuguese Army discontinued the use of the term in the 1860s.

The term (fusilier sailors) has been used in the Portuguese Navy, since the late 18th century, to designate the naval infantry. The modern Portuguese Marine Corps is called (Naval Fusiliers).

===Switzerland===

Line infantry soldiers of the lowest rank in the Swiss Army have historically been designated as fusiliers. Because the modern Swiss infantry soldier is trained in a much broader variety of tasks than his earlier counterpart, and because of some supposedly negative connotations attached to the term , modern infantry battalions of the Swiss army have been renamed or &quot;Inf Bat&quot;. The individual soldiers are officially called , not , but colloquially they are still referred to as or . This meaning is retained in the name of the 1938 Swiss film .

===United Kingdom===
The original fusiliers in the British Army were the 7th Foot, Royal Regiment of Fuzileers raised in 1685. This subsequently became The Royal Fusiliers (City of London Regiment). The original purpose of this unit was to act as escort to artillery guns, as well as keeping discipline amongst the civilian drivers. Both Scots (21st Foot) and Welsh (23rd Foot) regiments also became fusiliers in the period up to and including 1702 and all three regiments were distinguished by the wearing of a slightly shorter version of the mitred cap worn by grenadier companies of all other infantry regiments. A number of additional infantry regiments were subsequently designated as fusiliers during the 19th century, but this was simply a historic distinction without any relationship to special weapons or roles.

In 1865, a distinctive head-dress was authorised for British Army fusilier regiments. Originally a sealskin cap for other ranks, this was replaced by a black raccoon skin cap of in height, according to the 1874 Dress Regulations. However, fusilier officers wore a taller bearskin like their counterparts in the foot guards. The badge for each regiment was placed at the front of the bear or raccoon skin headdress, and consisted of a stylized flaming grenade, with different emblems placed on the ball of the grenade. These continue to be worn to the present day by the band of the Royal Regiment of Fusiliers, and also by colour parties, pioneers and drum majors in the Royal Welsh.
Attached to the various types of fusilier headdress, including the modern beret, is the hackle. This is a short cut feather plume, the colours of which vary according to the regiment. Initially, the only regiment authorised to wear a plume or hackle were the 5th of Foot (Northumberland Fusiliers). The regiment had originally worn a white feather distinction, authorised in 1824 to commemorate the victory of St Lucia in 1778 when men of the Fifth Regiment were supposed to have taken white feathers from the hats of dead French soldiers. When, in 1829, a white plume was ordered for all line infantry regiments, to preserve the Fifth (Northumberland) Regiment&#x27;s emblem, they were authorised to wear a white plume with a red tip, allegedly to indicate a distinction won in battle. The Fifth were designated fusiliers in 1836.

Following the Second Boer War, plumes were added to the headgear of all fusilier regiments in recognition of their service in South Africa.

The following fusilier regiments existed prior to the outbreak of World War I:

The nine regiments of fusiliers that existed in 1914 have since been reduced to one by a series of disbandments and mergers:
*In 1920, the Royal Welsh Fusiliers was renamed as the &quot;Royal Welch Fusiliers&quot;.
*Due to the creation of the Irish Free State, the Royal Munster Fusiliers and Royal Dublin Fusiliers were disbanded on 31 July 1922.
*In 1935, the Northumberland Fusiliers was awarded the title &quot;Royal&quot;.
*Under the Defence Review of 1957, the number of infantry regiments was reduced. The Royal Scots Fusiliers was amalgamated with the Highland Light Infantry on 20 January 1959 to form the Royal Highland Fusiliers. The new regiment wore the white hackle of the RSF, with a flaming grenade badge bearing the monogram of the HLI.
*Under the same review, the three English fusilier regiments were grouped as the Fusilier Brigade in 1958. While retaining their individual identities, a single cap badge was adopted. This was flaming grenade bearing St George and the Dragon within a laurel wreath the whole ensigned by a crown. This combined elements of the badges of the three regiments, who continued to be distinguished by their coloured hackles: red over white for the Royal Northumberland Fusiliers, white for the Royal Fusiliers and primrose yellow for the Lancashire Fusiliers.
*Also in 1958 the North Irish Brigade was formed, consisting of the Royal Inniskilling Fusiliers, the Royal Irish Fusiliers and the Royal Ulster Rifles. All regiments adopted a harp and crown badge on the caubeen, worn with a hackle: grey for the Inniskillings, green for the Royal Irish Fusiliers and black for the Rifles.
*On 1 May 1963, the Royal Warwickshire Regiment was redesignated as the Royal Warwickshire Fusiliers and joined the Fusilier Brigade. An old gold and blue hackle was adopted.
*On 23 April 1968 (St George&#x27;s Day), the four regiments of the Fusilier Brigade were amalgamated to form The Royal Regiment of Fusiliers. The RRF is now the only English fusilier regiment and wear the red over white hackle of the 5th Foot with the badge adopted in 1958 for the Fusilier Brigade.
*On 1 July 1968, the three regiments of the North Irish Brigade were amalgamated to form the Royal Irish Rangers and ceased to be a fusilier regiment. The green hackle of the Royal Irish Fusiliers continued in use. Following a further merger in 1992, the lineage is now continued by the Royal Irish Regiment.
*On 1 March 2006 (St David&#x27;s Day), the Royal Welch Fusiliers was amalgamated with the Royal Regiment of Wales to form the Royal Welsh. The white hackle of the RWF is worn with the cap badge of the RRW. Elements of the regimental band wear fusilier full dress.
*On 28 March 2006, the Scottish infantry regiments were merged into the Royal Regiment of Scotland. The individual battalions of the regiment retain the titles of the predecessor units, and The Royal Highland Fusiliers, 2nd Battalion The Royal Regiment of Scotland continues to wear the white hackle of the Royal Scots Fusiliers.

In addition, the Scots Guards were known as the Scots Fusilier Guards from 1831 to 1877.

<doc id="767773" wikidata="Q2361840" url="?curid=767773" title="Flag of Great Britain">
<text>The flag of Great Britain, often referred to as the King&#x27;s Colour, first Union Flag, Union Jack, and British flag, was used at sea from 1606 and more generally from 1707 to 1801. It was the first flag of the Kingdom of Great Britain. It is the precursor to the Union Jack of 1801.

The design was ordered by King James VI and I to be used on ships on the high seas, and it subsequently came into use as a national flag following the Treaty of Union and Acts of Union 1707, gaining the status of &quot;the Ensign armorial of Great Britain&quot;, the newly created state. It was later adopted by land forces although the blue of the field used on land-based versions more closely resembled that of the blue of the flag of Scotland.

The flag consists of the red cross of Saint George, patron saint of England, superimposed on the saltire of Saint Andrew, patron saint of Scotland. Its correct proportions are 3:5. The blue field on the flag was sky blue at first, but over time, the blue began to darken.

The flag&#x27;s official use came to an end in 1801 with the creation of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland. At that time Saint Patrick&#x27;s Flag was added to the flag of Great Britain to create the present-day Union Flag.

==Creation==
By James I of England, King of Scots, Orders in Council, 1606:

At the funeral of King James in 1625 the flag was called the &quot;Banner of the Union of the two Crosses of England and Scotland&quot;. James had the habit of referring to a &quot;Kingdom of Great Britain&quot;, considering that it had been created by the Union of the Crowns. However, despite the personal union which he represented, in practice England and Scotland continued as separate kingdoms, each with its own parliament and laws, for another century. The Kingdom of Great Britain finally came into being in 1707. The flag of the new Kingdom was formally chosen on 17 April 1707, two weeks before the Acts of Union of 1707 were to take effect. Henry St George, Garter Principal King of Arms, had presented several possible designs to Queen Anne and the Privy Council. 

=== Scottish variant ===
The principal alternative for consideration was a version of the flag with the saltire of Saint Andrew lying on top of that of Saint George, called the &quot;Scots union flag as said to be used by the Scots&quot;, but this was rejected.

===Proposed versions===
In the wake of the personal union between England and Scotland, several designs for a new flag were drawn up, juxtaposing the St George&#x27;s Cross and the St Andrew&#x27;s Saltire:

However, none were acceptable to James.

==After 1801==
With the 1801 change to the British flag, British ensigns and other official designs incorporating it nearly all changed as well, either immediately or when pre-existing stocks were used up. An exception is the commissioners&#x27; flag of the Northern Lighthouse Board, whose old stock lasted so long that its anachronistic design became fixed by tradition. The old flag has been included in some later designs to mark a pre-1801 British connection, as with the coat of arms of the Colony of Sierra Leone adopted in 1914 or the flag of Baton Rouge, Louisiana, adopted in 1995. The Flag of Somerset County, Maryland, briefly used from 1694, was revived after being rediscovered in 1958. The flag of Taunton, Massachusetts, a reconstruction of an American Revolutionary banner, was officially adopted at the bicentennial of its 1774 introduction; similarly, Westmoreland County, Pennsylvania, in 1973 adopted the 1775 flag of John Proctor&#x27;s Independent Battalion of Westmoreland County Provincials.

<text>The concept of irreconcilable differences provides possible grounds for divorce in the United States of America and Australia, among other jurisdictions.

==Australia==
Australian family law uses a no-fault divorce approach, and irreconcilable differences is the sole grounds for divorce, with adequate proof being that the estranged couple have been separated for more than 12 months.

==United States==
In the United States, this is one of several possible grounds. Often, it is used as justification for a no-fault divorce. In many cases, irreconcilable differences were the original and only grounds for no-fault divorce, such as in California, which enacted America&#x27;s first purely no-fault divorce law in 1969. California now lists one other possible basis, &quot;permanent legal incapacity to make decisions&quot; (formerly &quot;incurable insanity&quot;), on its divorce petition form.

Any sort of difference between the two parties that either cannot or will not be changed can be considered an irreconcilable difference. A difference could be that of a difference in character, personality, belief, or some other personality trait. Some states use the terms breakdown, breakdown, or incompatibility. In some states where the official grounds is &#x27;irreconcilable differences&#x27;, the statutory definition of that term may include a waiting period or a mutual-consent requirement.

<doc id="767781" wikidata="Q310700" url="?curid=767781" title="James McFadden">
<text>James Henry McFadden (born 14 April 1983) is a Scottish football coach and former professional player who played as a forward who now works as a football pundit.

McFadden started his playing career with Motherwell, where he came to prominence in the 2002–03 season by scoring 19 goals and winning the Scottish PFA Young Player of the Year award. Everton signed McFadden for £1.25 million in 2003. McFadden struggled to hold down a regular place in the Everton first-team and moved to Birmingham City for £5 million in January 2008. A serious injury meant that McFadden missed most of the 2010–11 season and the &quot;Blues&quot;, who were relegated in his absence, decided not to renew his contract. McFadden signed again for the &quot;Toffees&quot; on a free transfer in October 2011, after regaining his fitness, and spent three months with Sunderland in 2012.

Towards the end of his playing career, McFadden had two further spells at Motherwell, either side of a year at St Johnstone. During his third stint with Motherwell, McFadden also took on coaching duties. After a brief spell playing for Queen of the South, McFadden took a coaching position with the Scotland team.

McFadden was first capped by Scotland in 2002. His goal in a Euro 2008 qualification match on 12 September 2007 against France in the Parc des Princes, which gave Scotland a 1–0 win, is regarded as one of the team&#x27;s most famous goals. McFadden played 48 times for Scotland, scoring 15 goals, in total. He was appointed to an assistant coach position with the Scotland national team in March 2018.

==Club career==

===Motherwell (first spell)===
McFadden was raised in Springburn, Glasgow and attended Turnbull High School in Bishopbriggs. His parents operate a fish and chips takeaway in Glasgow city centre. He joined the Motherwell youth system at a young age, making his first-team debut when he was 17 years old. McFadden came to greater prominence during the 2002–03 Scottish Premier League SPL season, scoring 19 goals from 34 starts and winning the Young Player of the Year Award.

In this season Motherwell finished bottom of the SPL and should have been relegated but were given a reprieve due to First Division champions Falkirk not meeting stadium criteria.

McFadden received some criticism for his lack of discipline, picking up fifteen yellow cards and one red during the campaign. McFadden&#x27;s final game for Motherwell that season saw him score a hat-trick in a 6–2 defeat of Livingston at Fir Park.

===Everton (first spell)===
English Premier League club Everton signed McFadden in 2003 for £1.25 million. McFadden scored his debut goal for Everton during their 5–2 defeat at Tottenham Hotspur on 1 January 2005, more than a year after joining the club. One week later, he scored his second goal in a third-round FA Cup tie versus Plymouth Argyle.

During the 2005–06 season, McFadden was in and out of the Everton team as they struggled to re-capture their form of the previous season. On 11 March 2006, he scored with a 35-yard volley to help Everton to a 3–1 victory over Fulham. This scoring run of form continued the next week versus Aston Villa, a half-volley from just outside the area helping the Toffees to a 4–1 victory and ended the season with seven goals.

McFadden made an indifferent start to the 2006–07 season, following the arrival of record signing Andrew Johnson, managing only two goals in the first half of the campaign. On 24 January 2007, McFadden injured his fifth metatarsal during training for Everton. After nearly three months on the sidelines, he made a scoring return to action for Everton as a second-half substitute versus Charlton Athletic on 15 April 2007. McFadden scored a spectacular volley in injury time to secure a 2–1 win for the &quot;Toffees&quot;, a goal later voted goal of the season in a poll on the &quot;skysports.com&quot; website.

In October 2007, McFadden scored a critical equalising goal in Everton&#x27;s victory over Metalist Kharkiv in the UEFA Cup. He dedicated his goal against Middlesbrough on 2 January 2008 to the recently deceased Phil O&#x27;Donnell, by pointing to his black armband and then to the sky in tribute to the former Motherwell captain.

===Birmingham City===
On 18 January 2008, McFadden joined Birmingham City on a three-and-a-half-year deal, with an option for additional two years, for an initial fee of £5 million, potentially rising to £6m depending on appearances. McFadden&#x27;s first goal arrived in his fourth game for the club, a penalty kick versus West Ham United at Upton Park, after he had been fouled by Lucas Neill. In his next match, at home to Arsenal, he scored from a 20-yard free kick before adding the equalising goal from the penalty spot in the last minute of stoppage time.

McFadden scored Birmingham&#x27;s first goal of the 2009–10 Premier League season, a 92nd-minute penalty, to give the club a 1–0 home win against Portsmouth.

McFadden suffered anterior cruciate ligament damage in September 2010. He returned to training in March 2011, but suffered a setback which meant he could not play in the 2010–11 season. Following their relegation from the Premier League, Birmingham chose not to take up a two-year option on his contract but attempted to negotiate amended terms. No agreement was reached, and McFadden left Birmingham after his contract expired on 30 June 2011.

===Everton (second spell)===
After continuing to train with Birmingham over the summer to regain fitness while out of contract, McFadden had a successful trial with Wolverhampton Wanderers in September, but was unable to agree contract terms. In mid-October he was reported to be in talks with Celtic, but on 17 October, McFadden signed for Everton until the end of the 2011–12 season. McFadden played in a reserve team match the following day, his first appearance since a knee injury 13 months earlier and made his second debut for the first team on 5 November as an 81st-minute substitute in a 2–1 defeat away to Newcastle United. McFadden had to wait until April 2012 to make his first start, playing the first 64 minutes in a 4–0 league win over Sunderland but was released by the club at the end of the season, having played a total of eight first-team matches during his short return to Goodison Park.

Again out of contract, McFadden trained with Motherwell during the 2012–13 pre-season, playing for the club in a testimonial match for Steven Hammell on 21 July 2012 against Everton. Contract speculation followed when Motherwell manager Stuart McCall made an approach to sign McFadden. However, the approach to sign McFadden was unsuccessful as no agreement could be met.

===Sunderland===
In September 2012, McFadden undertook a trial with Sunderland. On 26 October, he joined Sunderland on a three-month contract that ended in January 2013. McFadden&#x27;s debut was on 15 December 2012, in a 3–1 defeat to Manchester United at Old Trafford and his home debut was on 12 January 2013 in a 3–0 victory versus West Ham United.

===Motherwell (second spell)===
After failing to earn a new deal at Sunderland, McFadden again trained with former club Motherwell. On 18 February 2013, McFadden returned to Fir Park, signing on until the end of the season. McFadden made his first start on his return in a 2–1 win over Celtic. On Friday 15 March 2013, McFadden scored his first goal since returning in a 4–1 victory over Hibernian and also set up two goals during the match. McFadden&#x27;s performance earned him the man-of-the-match award. McFadden then scored the late equaliser in a 2–2 draw versus St Mirren on 6 April 2013 and then on 5 May 2013, scored a brace despite losing 4–3 versus Inverness Caledonian Thistle. At the end of the 2012–13 season, although McFadden was offered a new contract his future still remained uncertain.

At the start of pre-season training for the 2013–14 season, McFadden returned to the club and travelled with them to their training camp in Spain. In a 4–2 defeat versus Newcastle United in a friendly match, McFadden scored a penalty with an audacious chip down the centre of the goal, known as a Panenka. After the match, reports suggested that McFadden would remain at Motherwell on a one-year deal. On 19 July 2013, it was confirmed that McFadden had signed a new contract in a decision that he described as &quot;straightforward&quot;.

At the start of the 2013–14 season, McFadden started as a traditional right winger but soon afterwards his form and fitness slumped, having scored only once versus Livingston in the last sixteen of the Scottish League Cup. McFadden then suffered a back injury but returned soon after to score his first league goal of the season in a 5–1 win over Partick Thistle on 29 December 2013 and followed this up his second league goal in the next match, in a 4–0 victory over St Johnstone. After these two games, McFadden says his performance revived his form and he went on to score and provide three assists, on 1 March 2014 as Motherwell defeated Hearts. McFadden&#x27;s fourth goal arrived on 22 March 2014 in a 2–1 victory over Ross County.

At the end of the 2013–14 season, McFadden was released by the club after they decided not to extend his contract after citing a risk over McFadden&#x27;s recurring injury problems, even though he had expressed his desire to sign a new contract two months previously.

===St Johnstone===
On 1 October 2014, McFadden signed for St Johnstone until the end of the 2014–15 season and had his debut on 4 October 2014 in a 2–1 defeat versus St Mirren. On 22 November 2014, McFadden scored his first goal for the Perth club in a 2–1 win versus Ross County. In May 2015, McFadden was released after only scoring one league goal during his season in Perthshire.

As of September 2015, McFadden was training with Motherwell. Two months later, he entered negotiations to be the marquee player of Indian Super League club Kerala Blasters, after the departure of Carlos Marchena.

===Motherwell (third spell)===
On 18 December 2015, McFadden signed a short-term deal until the end of January 2016. That arrangement expired at the end of January, with McFadden expecting to move on to the USA. On 13 February, McFadden signed a new deal to stay to the end of the season. On 19 March, he was ruled out for the remainder of the 2015–16 season, after suffering a broken ankle in training. On 26 July 2016, Motherwell announced that McFadden had been appointed as the club&#x27;s assistant-manager, whilst also continuing as a player until the summer of 2017.

Nearly seventeen years after making his Motherwell debut, and nearly sixteen after scoring his first league goal, McFadden came on as a second-half substitute in Motherwell&#x27;s final game of the 2016–17 season versus Inverness Caledonian Thistle and scored his final Motherwell goal in his final appearance. The match ended in a 3–2 win for the Scottish Highlands club. McFadden departed Motherwell at the end of the season, as their manager Stephen Robinson opted for a new coaching set-up.

On 13 November 2019, it was announced that McFadden was to be inducted into the Motherwell Hall of Fame.

===Queen of the South===
On 8 September 2017, McFadden signed for Dumfries club Queen of the South on a short-term contract. McFadden departed Queens in January 2018, after 15 appearances for the club.

==International career==
McFadden gained his first Scotland cap at the age of 19 against South Africa on a Far East tour, at the end of which a night out drinking caused him to miss his flight home. Despite his domestic performances he became a regular in Berti Vogts&#x27; Scotland set-up, scoring his first goal against the Faroe Islands during a 3–1 win in a UEFA Euro 2004 qualifying match at Hampden Park on 6 September 2003.

McFadden&#x27;s goal versus Netherlands in November 2003 gave Scotland a famous 1–0 victory, although they then lost 6–0 in Amsterdam and failed to qualify for UEFA Euro 2004. McFadden was part of the squad which went out to Japan in 2006 and won the Kirin Cup.

In September 2007, during Scotland&#x27;s dramatic but ultimately unsuccessful qualifying campaign for UEFA Euro 2008, McFadden scored a long-range goal from 30 yards to secure a famous 1–0 win over France in Paris, securing Scotland&#x27;s first win on French soil since 1950. He was on target again in the following game a month later, a 3–1 win over Ukraine at Hampden Park. He was unable to score in the last match of the campaign against Italy in November 2007 at Hampden, which Scotland lost 2–1.

The winning goal in a September 2008 match against Iceland in the 2010 World Cup qualifying campaign, scored on the rebound after McFadden&#x27;s penalty kick was saved, was initially credited to McFadden, but in the official match report was awarded to Barry Robson. The SFA lobbied on McFadden&#x27;s behalf, and in March 2009, FIFA re-credited the goal to him.

McFadden was substituted at half-time in a UEFA Euro 2012 qualification match against Liechtenstein in September 2010, and was criticised by manager Craig Levein after the game. McFadden suffered a serious injury soon afterwards. He criticised Levein in February 2012 for describing him as &quot;lazy&quot;. In March 2013 new Scotland manager Gordon Strachan said that he would consider McFadden for selection, but noted that he needed to play regularly at club level, having not done so in the previous two seasons.

==Coaching career==
Alex McLeish appointed McFadden to an assistant coaching position with the Scotland national team in March 2018. McLeish and his backroom staff, including McFadden, were fired on 18 April 2019.

<doc id="767783" wikidata="Q803974" url="?curid=767783" title="Baise-moi">
<text>Baise-moi is a 2000 French erotic crime thriller film written and directed by Virginie Despentes and Coralie Trinh Thi and starring Karen Lancaume and Raffaëla Anderson. It is based on the novel by Despentes, first published in 1993. The film received intense media coverage because of its graphic mix of violence and explicit sex scenes. Consequently, it is sometimes considered an example of the &quot;New French Extremity&quot;.

As a French noun, &quot;un baiser&quot; means &quot;a kiss&quot;, but as a verb, &quot;baiser&quot; means &quot;to fuck&quot;, so &quot;Baise-moi&quot; () means &quot;Fuck me&quot;. In some markets the film has been screened as &quot;Rape me&quot;, but the French for &quot;rape me&quot; is &quot;viole-moi&quot;. In a 2002 interview, &quot;Rape Me&quot; was rejected by the directors.

In 2000, the Film Censorship Board of Malaysia banned the film outright because of &quot;very high-impact violence and sexual content throughout.&quot; Later that same year, the film was banned in Singapore owing to &quot;depictions of sexual violence [that] may cause controversy.&quot; In Australia, the film was allowed to be shown at cinemas with an R18+ (adults only) rating. Then in 2002, the film was pulled from cinemas and television and after that, banned outright. The film is still banned there because of its &quot;harmful, explicit sexually violent content&quot;, and was re-banned in 2013.

==Plot==
&quot;Baise-moi&quot; tells the story of Nadine and Manu who go on a violent spree against a society in which they feel marginalized. Nadine is a part-time sex worker, and Manu a slacker who does anything—including occasional porn film acting—to get by in her small town in southern France.

One day, Manu and her friend, a drug addict, are accosted in the park by three men, who take them to a garage and gang-rape them. While her friend struggles, screams, and fights against the rapists, Manu lies still with a detached look, which troubles the man raping her, who soon gives up. When her friend asks Manu how she could act so detached, she replies that she &quot;can&#x27;t prevent anyone from penetrating her pussy&quot;, so she didn&#x27;t leave anything precious in there. Manu then returns to her brother&#x27;s house, and does not tell him what has happened, but noticing bruises on her neck, he realizes. He gets out a gun and asks Manu who was responsible, but when she refuses to tell him, he calls her a &quot;slut&quot; and implies that she actually enjoyed being raped. In response, picking up the discarded pistol, Manu shoots him in the head.

Meanwhile, Nadine returns home and has an argument with her roommate, whom she strangles and kills, before leaving with their rent money. Nadine suffers another emotional setback when she meets her best friend, a drug dealer, in another town, but he is shot and killed while out obtaining drugs with a prescription she forged for him.

Later that night, having missed the last train, Nadine meets Manu at the railway station. Manu says she has a car, if Nadine will drive for her. They soon realize that they share common feelings of anger and embark on a violent and sexually charged road trip together.

In need of money, the girls hold up a shop and also kill a woman at a cash machine. In a stolen car, they are pulled over for a random check by police, whom they kill. Another woman, who was also being checked and saw the murders, flees with them. The women stay over at their new friend&#x27;s house, whose brother provides the address and details of an architect with whom he has had trouble. The women trick their way into the architect&#x27;s house and kill him. Finally, after this spree of murder and sexual activity, the two women enter a swingers&#x27; club. One of the patrons makes a racist comment to Manu. The women kill most of the patrons there and use a gun to anally penetrate the racist man, finally shooting him. The pair discuss what they have done and agree that it has all been pointless because nothing has changed in them.

During their spree, the duo&#x27;s crimes are reported by the press, and become a point of fascination for the entire country, with some people actually supporting them, and others afraid of them. When Manu enters a roadside tire shop to get some coffee, she is shot by the shop owner, who is then shot by Nadine. Nadine takes Manu&#x27;s body to a forest lake and burns it, before driving to a beach. With tears in her eyes, Nadine puts the gun to her head, intending to commit suicide, but is arrested by the police before she can do so.

==Cast==
==Production==
The film was filmed on location between October and December 1999 in Biarritz, Bordeaux, Lyon, and Marseille. It was shot on digital video without artificial lighting. This low budget method of filming divided critics—some said it gave the film an amateurish look. James Travers writing for filmsdefrance.com said the filming method added something to the film. Travers wrote &quot;the film&#x27;s &#x27;rough and ready&#x27; feel helps to strengthen its artistic vision and draws out the messages which it is trying to get across, without distracting its audience with overly choreographed &#x27;shock scenes&#x27;.&quot;

==Release==
The film, co-directed by Coralie Trinh Thi who had previously worked as a pornographic actress, included several unsimulated sex scenes. The two lead roles were also played by porn actresses, while several other porn actors, including Ian Scott as one of the rapists, appeared in supporting roles. Due to this, some sections of the media criticized the film as thinly veiled pornography. &quot;Le Monde&quot;, for instance, called it a &quot;sick film&quot;. &quot;Time&quot; magazine bucked the trend by saying: &quot;Virginie Despentes and Coralie Trinh Thi&#x27;s festival sensation is stark, serious and original. And as one of the amoral avengers, Raffaela Anderson has true star quality – part seraph, all slut.&quot; The co-directors rejected the pornography charge: Trinh Thi said in an interview with the &quot;Sunday Times&quot; that &quot;This movie is not for masturbation, [thus it] is not porn.&quot; Despentes agreed, saying their film &quot;was not erotic&quot;.

In its home country of France, the film was initially released with a 16 rating, given by a ministerial commission. The rating caused outrage, particularly amongst members of the right-wing &quot;Promouvoir&quot; religious group, which is strongly associated with the Mouvement National Républicain. Some groups litigated against the classification decision, arguing that the film should be X-rated given its high content of realistic sex and extreme violence, both of which are grounds for X classification in France; the Conseil d&#x27;État ruled its classification illegal, removing it from the theater circuit. It was the first film to be banned in France for 28 years. The Conseil later re-classified the film with an X certificate, a category usually reserved for pornographic movies. Minister for Culture Catherine Tasca ended the debate by re-introducing an 18 certificate without the X classification, allowing the film to be re-released in mainstream theatres.

In Australia, the film was initially passed for viewing at the highest possible R18 rating in a 6–5 vote by the country&#x27;s Classification Board in October 2001. However, the Attorney-General invoked his powers under the 1995 Classification Act to have the board&#x27;s decision reviewed. The Classification Review Board (a separate entity to the Classification Board) ruled in May 2002 that the film contains &quot;explicit, offensive and graphic depictions of sexual violence, assault and violence with an impact that is very high&quot; and &quot;dangerous to the community&quot;, resulting in the film being banned with a &quot;Refused Classification&quot; rating. It was later revealed that 50,000 people had seen the film before the ban, but according to Des Clark, director of the Office of Film and Literature Classification, just &quot;one or two&quot; of those had complained about the film. Most complainants, he explained, had not seen the film. An appeal of the review board&#x27;s verdict failed. Despite an edited screening of the film airing on the pay World Movies channel later the same month, the film was re-banned in August 2013. The film is currently available for screening via the online streaming service Stan since 15 October 2018.

It received an R18 rating in cinemas in New Zealand, and was banned from video release there, following an injunction filed by the Society for the Promotion of Community Standards.

In Canada, the film was banned in Ontario, initially because it was deemed too pornographic. The producers asked for a pornographic rating, only for it to be banned because there was too much violence for a pornographic film. A second review in 2001 passed the film with an R rating. In Quebec, the film was considered to be a moderate success for an independent release, taking in approximately $250,000 CAD in the first two months of its run. It did, however, provoke a violent reaction from one Montreal moviegoer, who broke into the projection booth and stole the print, ending the screening.

In the United Kingdom, the film was released with an 18 certificate for its 2001 cinema release after the cut of a ten-second scene showing a close-up of a penis entering a vagina during a rape, which the Board ruled eroticized sexual assault. After a further cut of a two-second scene showing a gun being pressed into a man&#x27;s anus before being fired, the film received an 18 certificate on video in 2002 . Even with these cuts, the film represents a watershed in what content is allowed at the 18 rating—films with the R18 higher rating can only be sold in licensed sex shops. The film was one of the first to show an erect penis, and the first to combine it with scenes of violence. London Underground banned the display of the film&#x27;s advertising poster because of fears that its title would offend French-speakers using its network. In 2013, the film was passed uncut with the 18 certificate.

In the United States, the film was marketed under the names &quot;Kiss Me&quot; and &quot;Rape Me&quot; and released without a classification from the Motion Picture Association of America. It screened only at a small number of cinemas (almost all of them in arthouse cinemas in the major cities). The film took just $70,000 in receipts from its American release and there was a marked lack of controversy as compared to other countries.

Two minutes and 35 seconds of cuts were required before the film received a certificate in Hong Kong. In Finland, the film was rated K18 (Forbidden for under 18). An uncut version was shown in both cinemas and on TV.

==Reception==
&quot;Baise-moi&quot; received generally negative reviews. Rotten Tomatoes gives the film a 23% &quot;rotten&quot; rating based on 57 reviews, with a weighted average of 4.17/10. The website&#x27;s critics consensus reads, &quot;Heavy on the sex and violence, &quot;Baise-Moi&quot; is not so much a daring as a sloppy piece of work.&quot; The film also has a 35/100 rating on Metacritic, based on 22 critics, signifying &quot;generally unfavorable reviews&quot;.

<doc id="767788" wikidata="Q58286" url="?curid=767788" title="Jean Ping">
<text>Jean Ping (; born 24 November 1942) is a Gabonese diplomat and politician who served as Chair of the African Union Commission from 2008 to 2012. Born to a Chinese father and Gabonese mother, he is the first individual of Chinese descent to lead the executive branch of the African Union.

He served as the Minister of State and Minister of Foreign Affairs, Cooperation and Francophonie of the Gabonese Republic from 1999 to 2008, and was President of the United Nations General Assembly from 2004 to 2005. He stood for the 2016 Gabonese presidential election against president Ali Bongo.

==Biography==

=== Personal life ===
Ping was born in Omboué, a small town on the Fernan Vaz lagoon, south of Port-Gentil. His father, Cheng Zhiping, called Wang Ping by the Gabonese, was a Chinese person from Wenzhou, Zhejiang, who was recruited as a labourer in the 1920s and became a timber harvester. Cheng, who married Germaine Anina, a Gabonese daughter of a tribal chief that was born in Zaire, encouraged his son to study in France with a scholarship from the Gabonese government.

Ping has a doctorate in economic science from the University of Paris 1 Panthéon-Sorbonne, which he obtained under René Passet in 1975.

Previously in a relationship with Pascaline Bongo, daughter of president Omar Bongo, with whom he has two children, Ping also has children with Marie-Madeleine Liane. However, he has always remained married to Jeanne-Thérèse, who is of Italo-Ivorian origin. He is the father of eight children.

=== International positions ===
In 1972, Ping began working as an international civil servant at UNESCO in Paris. He served as Gabon&#x27;s Permanent Delegate to UNESCO from 1978 to 1984 before becoming involved in his country&#x27;s politics. He was also president of OPEC in 1993.

In 2004, Ping was chosen to be the 59th President of the United Nations General Assembly.

Ping was elected Chairperson of the Commission of the African Union in the first round in 2008. He left the role in 2012.

=== Political career ===

In 1972, Ping began working at UNESCO in its Sector for External Relations and Cooperation as an international civil servant. In 1978, he became advisor to the Gabonese embassy in France, and he subsequently became Gabon&#x27;s Permanent Delegate to UNESCO, in which position he served until 1984.

On returning to Gabon in 1984, Ping began his political career as chief of staff to Omar Bongo, President of the Gabonese Republic.

==== Ministerial career ====
On 26 February 1990, Ping was appointed Minister of Information, Postal Services, Telecommunications, Tourism, Leisure and Parastatal Sector Reform with responsibility for Parliamentary relations and government spokesman. He held the position only briefly before moving to the head of the Ministry of Mines, Energy and Hydraulic Resources from 29 April 1990 to June 1991, then again for nineteen months from 28 August 1992 to 24 March 1994.

On 25 March 1994, Ping was given responsibility for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Cooperation for the first time, before becoming Deputy Minister of Finance, Economy, the Budget and Privatization on 30 October.

Ping was elected to the National Assembly from Omboué in the December 1996 parliamentary election, the December 2001 parliamentary election, and the December 2006 parliamentary election.

Ping was Minister of Planning, Environment and Tourism for two years from 27 January 1997 to 25 January 1999, before again taking responsibility for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Cooperation, joined this time by the Francophonie portfolio and with the title of Minister of State. He remained there until his election to Chairperson of the Commission of the African Union on 6 February 2008, a position that he held until 15 October 2012. It was during this final nine-year ministerial term that he served as President of the United Nations General Assembly in 2004–2005.

On 1 February 2014, Ping announced his disillusionment with the ruling Gabonese Democratic Party (PDG) and resigned on 19 February 2014. He has since been in open conflict with President Ali Bongo and focused on unifying the opposition forces in a structure called Front uni de l&#x27;opposition pour l&#x27;alternance (FUOPA).

==== 2016 presidential election ====
At a political meeting in the city of Oyem on 25 August 2015, Ping officially launched his bid to become the sole opposition candidate standing for the 27 August 2016 presidential election.

On the eve of the 2016 presidential election, Ping was, with the outgoing president Ali Bongo, one of the two favourites, alongside eight other candidates. He was supported by four other candidates who stood aside for him: Casimir Oyé Mba, the former Prime Minister, Guy Nzouba-Ndama, former president of the National Assembly, Léon Paul Ngoulakia, President Bongo’s cousin, and Roland Désiré Aba&#x27;a Minko, an independent candidate.

According to the official 31 August results provided by the CENAP, Gabon&#x27;s national elections commission, whose impartiality has been strongly criticized by the opposition, Ali Bongo was declared the victor with 49.8% of the votes. His victory was contested as Jean Ping, with 48.2%, was beaten by just 5,594 votes. Frauds were alleged, particularly in the Haut-Ogooué province, Ali Bongo’s stronghold, which saw the turnout reach 99.93% versus 59.5% at national level and 98% of votes cast in his favour.

In the night of 31 August to 1 September 2016, the headquarters of Ping’s presidential campaign were attacked by military forces, leaving several people dead. Ping has since condemned &quot;the military-electoral coup d&#x27;état.&quot;

On 2 September, Ping said at a press conference: &quot;the whole world knows who the president of the Republic is: it’s me, Jean Ping.&quot; He demanded that the votes be recounted by polling station. Earlier on 30 August, the American Ambassador to Gabon called for the results to be published by polling station, stating that &quot;the electors have been let down by numerous systematic failings and irregularities.&quot; On 1 September, the European Union also declared: &quot;Confidence in the election results can only be restored by a transparent verification, polling station by polling station.&quot;

On 24 September 2016, Bongo was declared the victor by the Constitutional Court with 50.66% of the votes, ahead of Ping with 47.24%. Following the verdict, Ping, who had appealed to the high court under pressure from the international community, spoke to the Gabonese people: &quot;Yesterday, the Court made its ruling despite and against everything, trampling over the sovereignty of the Gabonese people, pointedly ignoring the national and international community’s urgent calls for transparency. But the ruling won’t unite or satisfy the Gabonese people because the people of Gabon won’t recognize it. Nor will the international community give it any credence.&quot;

==== Post-election period ====
Ping decided to wage a peaceful struggle and continue campaigning against Ali Bongo in order to resolve Gabon&#x27;s political crisis, which for months had been significantly worsening the economic crisis triggered by the fall in raw material prices in 2015 (although manganese was much less affected).

Following various reports, the 12 December report of the European Union’s Election Observation Mission (EUEOM), which was written by election observers present at Gabon’s invitation, clearly stated that &quot;These anomalies call in question the integrity of the process of consolidating the results and final result of the election.&quot; When Ping concluded an initial world tour of international institutions and bodies in November 2016, he said : &quot;That clearly shows that it’s me, Jean Ping, who won the presidential election. We expect the international community to draw all the necessary conclusions from the report&quot;. The African Union (AU) and International Organisation of La Francophonie (OIF) reports released to date confirm that the wishes of Gabonese voters have been disregarded.

On 15 December 2016, Ping appealed to the ICC, citing crimes against humanity before and after the disputed 27 August 2016 presidential election. He claimed to have proof that at least 22 people were shot dead by law enforcement forces.

At Ping&#x27;s initiative, &#x27;Le Dialogue National Pour l&#x27;Alternance&#x27; (DNPA) was held from 18 to 23 December 2016. All Gabonese were invited in the aim of debating such essential topics as the claims of victory, post-election crisis, governance and social crises.

On 2 February 2017, the European Parliament passed a resolution condemning the human rights violations in Gabon following the 2016 presidential election. It was welcomed by Ping, who said : &quot;We have always called for targeted sanctions. They may take time, but they will come.&quot;

Throughout 2017, Ping continued to campaign and, as he had done since 2014, organized a countrywide tour (from 1 to 5 March 2017) to Gabon’s three provincial capitals: Oyem in the north; Mouila in the south; and Lambaréné in the centre.

In Libreville on 22 June, Ping was interviewed by members of the ICC Office of the Prosecutor as part of their preliminary examination of post-election violence in Gabon.

Alongside Ping, an international movement led by the Gabonese diaspora has emerged, demanding that the sovereignty of the Gabonese people is recognized and the true election results are acknowledged. During his July 2017 European tour, the protest movement gave him a warm welcome.

<text>Francesca Lia Block (born December 3, 1962) is an American writer of adult and young-adult literature. She wrote the &quot;Weetzie Bat&quot; series, which she began while a student at UC Berkeley.

==Early life and education==

Block was born in Los Angeles in 1962. Her mother was a poet and her father was the screenwriter and painter Irving Block. She attended North Hollywood High School and the University of California, Berkeley, and later studied for her MFA from the University of California at Riverside.

==Career==
Block writes both novels and poetry. Her first two books, &quot;Moon Harvest&quot; (1978) and &quot;Season of Green&quot; (1979), were small-press illustrated poetry collections, now out of print. Since then, she has released several standalone collections of poetry, as well as incorporating poetry and lyrics into many of her novels. She has published over 40 books.

Block did not originally start out with an editor, but was published by using her connections. She attributed her success partly to publishers being interested in shorter books.

In 2014, Block was named Writer-in-Residence at Pasadena City College. Block is a member of the Authors Guild, Authors League of America, and the Writers Guild of America.

In 2018, it was confirmed that &quot;Weetzie Bat&quot; would be produced as a feature film, with Justin Kelly attached as director. Block wrote the screenplay for the film.

Block is known for her use of imagery, especially in describing the city of Los Angeles. One &quot;New York Times Book Review&quot; critic said, &quot;Block writes about the real Los Angeles better than anyone since Raymond Chandler.&quot;

==Writing style and genres==
Block sees her books as being in the tradition of magical realism, and she has said that she was heavily influenced by Gabriel Garcia Marquez and Isabel Allende, as well as Emily Dickinson. She has been compared to S.E. Hinton because of themes like sex, death, drugs, and broken homes that occur in her works. Many of her books have been categorized as young adult fiction, but Block has also written adult fiction, non-fiction, short stories, and poetry.

==Personal life==
Block has a son and a daughter. She lives in Los Angeles.

==Awards and nominations==
* 1996: &quot;Baby Be-Bop&quot; was nominated for the Lambda Literary Award for Young Adult/Children&#x27;s Book
* 2001: &quot;Dangerous Angels&quot; was inducted into the Gaylactic Spectrum Awards Hall of Fame
* 2005: American Library Association (ALA) Margaret A. Edwards Award for &quot;significant and lasting contribution to young adult literature&quot; for the first five Weetzie Bat books.
* 2009: &quot;Weetzie Bat&quot; won the Phoenix Award from the Children&#x27;s Literature Association as the best English-language children&#x27;s book that did not win a major award when it was originally published.

<doc id="767800" wikidata="Q1359881" url="?curid=767800" title="Ghoti">
<text>Ghoti is a creative English respelling of the word &quot;fish&quot;, used to illustrate irregularities in English spelling and pronunciation.

==Explanation==
The word is intended to be pronounced in the same way as &quot;fish&quot; (), using these sounds:
* &quot;gh&quot;, pronounced as in &quot;enough&quot; or &quot;tough&quot; ;
* &quot;o&quot;, pronounced as in &quot;women&quot; ;
* &quot;ti&quot;, pronounced as in &quot;nation&quot; or &quot;motion&quot; .

The key to the phenomenon is that the pronunciations of the constructed word&#x27;s three parts are inconsistent with how they would ordinarily be pronounced in those placements. To illustrate: &quot;gh&quot; can only resemble &quot;f&quot; when following the letters &quot;ou&quot; or &quot;au&quot; at the end of certain morphemes (&quot;tough&quot;, &quot;cough&quot;, &quot;laugh&quot;), while &quot;ti&quot; would only resemble &quot;sh&quot; when followed by a vowel sound. The expected pronunciation in English would sound like &quot;goatee&quot; , not &quot;fish&quot;.

Both of the digraphs in the spelling – &quot;gh&quot; and &quot;ti&quot; – are examples of consonant shifts, the gradual transformation of a consonant in a particular spoken context while retaining its identity in writing. Specifically, &quot;nation&quot; reflects the softening of &quot;t&quot; before &quot;io&quot; in late Latin and early French, while &quot;enough&quot; reflects the softening of a terminal &quot;g&quot; in West Germanic languages. In contrast, North Germanic languages such as Danish and Swedish retain a harder pronunciation in their corresponding words (&quot;nok&quot; and &quot;nog&quot;).

==History==
In 1815, there were several examples of absurd spellings given in a book by Alexander J. Ellis, &quot;A Plea for Phonotypy and Phonography&quot;, which advocated spelling reform. However, &quot;ghoti&quot; was not among the examples, which were all relatively lengthy and thus harder to remember.

The first confirmed use of &quot;ghoti&quot; is in a letter dated 11 December 1855 from Charles Ollier to Leigh Hunt. On the third page of the letter, Ollier explains that his son William, who was 31, had &quot;hit upon a new method of spelling Fish.&quot; Ollier then demonstrates the rationale, &quot;So that &quot;ghoti&quot; is &quot;fish&quot;.&quot;

An early known published reference is an October 1874 article by S. R. Townshend Mayer in &quot;St. James&#x27;s Magazine&quot;, which cites the letter.

Another relatively early appearance of &quot;ghoti&quot; was in a 1937 newspaper article, and the term is alluded to in the 1939 James Joyce experimental work of fiction &quot;Finnegans Wake&quot;.

&quot;Ghoti&quot; is often cited to support English spelling reform, and is often attributed to George Bernard Shaw, a supporter of this cause. However, the word does not appear in Shaw&#x27;s writings, and a biography of Shaw attributes it instead to an anonymous spelling reformer. Similar constructed words exist that demonstrate English idiosyncrasies, but &quot;ghoti&quot; is one of the most widely recognized.

==Notable usage==
*In &quot;Finnegans Wake&quot; (published in 1939), James Joyce alludes to &quot;ghoti&quot;: &quot;Gee each owe tea eye smells fish.&quot; (&quot;G-H-O-T-I spells &#x27;fish&#x27;.&quot;) (p. 299). On p. 51, &quot;that fishabed ghoatstory&quot; may also allude to &quot;ghoti&quot;.
*In the artistic language Klingon, is the proper word for &quot;fish&quot;.
*In &quot;An Egg Grows in Gotham&quot;, a 1966 episode of the television series &quot;Batman&quot;, the villain Egghead uses &quot;Ghoti Oeufs&quot; as the name for his caviar business, and Batman explains the reference to Robin.
*Ghoti Hook is a 1990s Christian punk band.
*&quot;Ghoti&quot; has been used to test speech synthesizers. The &quot;Speech!&quot; allophone-based speech synthesizer software for the BBC Micro was tweaked to pronounce &quot;ghoti&quot; as &quot;fish&quot;. Examination of the code reveals the string GHOTI used to identify the special case.
*In the Yu-Gi-Oh! Trading Card Game, there is a series of fish-type cards called &quot;Ghoti&quot;.
*The second track of Lupe Fiasco&#x27;s 2022 album &quot;Drill Music in Zion&quot; is titled &quot;Ghoti&quot;.
*Vocaloid producer NILFRUITS uses the line &quot;ghoti, ghoti&quot; in the transcript accompanying the sung lyrics of &quot;fish, fish&quot; in his 2018 song &quot;Hungry Nicole&quot;.

<text>Hmar people are a scheduled tribe ethnic group from the states of Manipur, Mizoram, Assam, and Meghalaya in Northeast India. They use the Hmar language as their primary language.

==Population==
According to the 2011 Indian Census, there were 98,988 Hmar speakers (as first language). The Hmar population itself (including, Hmar people who speak Mizo language as their first language) roughly stands at 200,000-300,000. Several critics and scholars point out that a significant population of the Hmar people are fully &#x27;Mizonised&#x27; in Mizoram, hence do not reflect as &quot;Hmar tribe&quot; population, rather as &quot;Any Mizo tribes&quot; in Census reports.

==Language==
Hmar people use the Hmar language, which closely resembles the Mizo language and uses the Roman script. The script was introduced by British missionaries, including &#x27;Pu Buanga&#x27; (James Herbert Lorrain), during the colonial era in India and is locally known as the &#x27;A Aw B.&#x27; Hmar language is within the Tibeto-Burman stock of languages.

== Religion ==
The majority of the Hmar people practice Christianity. They were Christianized by Welsh missionaries in the 1910s (specifically at Senvawn village).

== Place of origin ==
The Hmar people believe Sinlung to be their ancestral origin.

<doc id="767804" wikidata="Q520357" url="?curid=767804" title="Juwan Howard">
<text>Juwan Antonio Howard ( ; born February7, 1973) is an American professional basketball coach and former player who is an assistant coach for the Brooklyn Nets of the National Basketball Association (NBA). He previously served as the head coach of the Michigan Wolverines men&#x27;s team from 2019 to 2024 before joining the Nets in 2024.

A one-time All-Star and one-time All-NBA power forward, he began his NBA career as the fifth overall pick in the 1994 NBA draft, selected by the Washington Bullets. Before he was drafted, he starred as an All-American on the Michigan Wolverines men&#x27;s basketball team. At Michigan he was part of the Fab Five recruiting class of 1991 that reached the finals of the NCAA tournament in 1992 and 1993.

Howard was an All-American center and an honors student at Chicago Vocational Career Academy. Michigan was able to sign him early over numerous competing offers and then convince others in his recruiting class to join him. The Fab Five, which included Chris Webber, Jalen Rose, Jimmy King and Ray Jackson, served as regular starters during their freshman and sophomore years for the 1991–92 and 1992–93 Wolverines. Although many of the Wolverines&#x27; accomplishments of the 1990s were vacated due to NCAA rules violations committed by four members of the program, Howard was not personally implicated in the scandal and his 1993–94 All-American season continues to be recognized.

After one season as an All-Rookie player and a second as an All-Star and an All-NBA performer, he became the first NBA player to sign a $100 million contract. In 2010, he signed with the Miami Heat and went on to make his first career NBA Finals appearance. He remained with the Heat the following season and won his first NBA championship during the 2012 NBA Finals. He returned to the Heat for part of the following season, and won a second championship. After retiring as a player in 2013, he remained with the Heat organization as an assistant coach for the next six seasons, before accepting the head coaching position at Michigan in 2019.

Howard earned numerous awards for his performance as a coach in the 2020–21 season, including AP National Coach of the Year and Big Ten Coach of the Year. Howard became the second Michigan basketball coach to earn AP National Coach of the Year honors. Howard also became the first coach to earn a No.1 seed as both a player and coach, after the Wolverines secured a No.1 seed in the 2021 NCAA Tournament.

==Early life==
Howard&#x27;s grandmother, Jannie Mae Howard, was the daughter of sharecroppers from Belzoni, Mississippi. She had four daughters by her 19th birthday, including Howard&#x27;s mother Helena. Helena was an employee at a Chicago restaurant when she became pregnant with Juwan. Howard&#x27;s father, Leroy Watson, had just returned from the Army to a phone company job in Chicago. The two married quickly once they realized Helena was pregnant. For Howard&#x27;s first week of life, his high school junior mother kept him in a drawer at Jannie Mae&#x27;s house. Helena, who was 17 years old, did not want to be restricted or burdened raising her child, so Jannie Mae adopted him. His biological father, Leroy Watson Jr., wanted to name him Leroy Watson, III, but his grandmother rejected the suggestion, insisting on Juwan Antonio Howard. Although his mother visited on occasion as he was growing up, his grandmother raised him, along with two cousins. Howard has no siblings and is not close to his biological parents; his grandmother was the primary influence in his life. He moved with her to several low-income Chicago South Side projects; she kept him out of trouble and away from gangs as he was growing up. One of their residences was a three-bedroom apartment on 69th Street on the South Side of Chicago. As he blossomed under his grandmother&#x27;s influence and discipline, he became her &quot;pride and joy&quot;.

==High school==

Howard went to Chicago Vocational Career Academy, where he went on to play three seasons of varsity basketball. Vocational had an unheated gym and no locker rooms, which required that the team dress for games in a history classroom. Nonetheless, Howard went on to be named a 1991 All-American basketball player by &quot;Parade&quot; magazine and won McDonald&#x27;s All American honors. He was also chosen for the National Honor Society and served as Vocational&#x27;s homecoming king. During recruiting visits by college coaches such as Illinois&#x27; Lou Henson, DePaul&#x27;s Joey Meyer and Michigan&#x27;s Steve Fisher, Jannie Mae Howard did most of the questioning.

===Sophomore year===
At the start of his sophomore year in 1988, Howard was 15 years old and already expected to be a coveted blue chip recruit in 1991. He was regarded as one of the best sophomore basketball players in the Chicago metropolitan area. He scored 26 points in a Chicago Public High School League quarterfinal loss against a Deon Thomas-led Simeon Career Academy team. Vocational ended the year with a 23–7 record. Howard was a second-team selection and the only sophomore named to the league coaches&#x27; 20-man 1988–89 All-Public League team.

The summer after his sophomore year, the center attended the Nike Academic Betterment and Career Development (ABCD) camp, which was held annually in Princeton, New Jersey, during the late 1980s. There he was matched against the Shawn Bradley. At this camp, even though the much-taller Bradley blocked his shots several times, Howard established himself as one of the best junior-year big men in the country. He was involved in controversy for receiving a second pair of sneakers at the camp because he was suspected of stealing them. Howard denied theft, but he was sent home on the last day of the six-day camp.

Howard also participated in the Bill Cronauer camp in Rensselaer, Indiana, which more than 100 college coaches attended. According to the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot;, he was ranked as one of the top 10 underclassmen in the country during the camp. Howard attended other camps that summer; his goal was to overcome Thomas, who was the reigning &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; basketball player of the year, as the best big man in the state. By the time he ended his college career in 1994, Howard was drafted a full round ahead of Thomas.

===Junior year===
As Howard entered his junior year, some sources listed him as the best junior basketball player in Illinois, while others ranked Tom Kleinschmidt ahead of him. Taylor Bell of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; noted that Howard was leaning toward playing either for DePaul or for Illinois. Howard was interested in Illinois because Thomas, whom Howard admired, had become a member of the 1989–90 Fighting Illini team. By the end of his junior year, league coaches named him to the first-team All-Chicago Public School League. He was selected to the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; All-Area team as well as the Class-AA All-State team and established himself as the top Chicago-area junior ahead of Kleinschmidt. Howard had a sub-par performance against King High School in the Chicago Public School League semifinals, but the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; named him to its All-State second team. Vocational finished the year 24–7.

Howard was also an honors student. After his junior year, he was one of 10 Illinois players invited back to the Nike All-American Camp at Princeton. Others invited included Kleinschmidt, Donnie Boyce, William Gates, Billy Taylor, Rashard Griffith and Howard Nathan. Although Howard was considered one of the top prospects in the city of Chicago at that time, the player perceived as the best Chicago-area prospect was Glenn Robinson of Gary, Indiana. By this time, Howard had eliminated DePaul from consideration since Deryl Cunningham, another Chicago-area all-star who might have otherwise convinced Howard to stay in Chicago, had transferred to Kansas State. He was considering Michigan, Michigan State, Kentucky, Arizona, Dayton, Marquette and Illinois. Howard was evaluated as the best senior basketball player at the camp; the group of players in attendance included Chris Webber, Cherokee Parks, Robinson and Alan Henderson.

After being named Most Valuable Player (MVP) at the prestigious Boston Shootout and acknowledged as the leading participant at the Nike camp, Howard was mentioned as the best prospect in the country. By this time, he had dropped Michigan State and Illinois from his list of possible college destinations and had begun considering UNLV as well. Following his time at the Nike camp, his household was besieged by recruiters. Howard issued the following statement: &quot;Contact my coach. I do not want my grandmother and aunt upset about calls at all times of the day and night. I&#x27;m not the only person who lives in this house. I think my wishes should be respected. If not, when it comes time to make my decision, I&#x27;ll take those things into account.&quot; Although Howard was the best performer at the camp, talent scout Bob Gibbons felt Webber and Robinson were equally talented prospects. Despite Howard&#x27;s most recently listed college preferences and the fact that the team was under investigation for recruiting violations, Illinois continued pursuing Howard as its number one recruit. By the end of July 1990, Howard was projected to sign with Michigan.

===Senior year===
During Michigan&#x27;s in-home visit, Howard&#x27;s grandmother treated Michigan head coach Fisher, his assistants Mike Boyd and Brian Dutcher, Vocational coach Cook, Vocational assistant coach Donnie Kirskey, Lois Howard (Howard&#x27;s aunt) and Howard to a soul food dinner. Dutcher had the responsibility to contact Howard several times a week. Howard grew close to assistant coach Kirskey, often staying at his house and using his car once he got a driver&#x27;s license. During the summer 1990 30-day visitation period, Dutcher watched Howard practice 28 consecutive days. Dutcher developed an understanding of the dynamics of Howard&#x27;s relationship with his grandmother. While other coaches, such as Lute Olson, almost ignored her during the recruiting, Dutcher understood that she was the key influence on his life, and understood that Kirskey also had sway with Howard. He encouraged Fisher to hire Kirskey for a summer basketball camp, which became the young athlete&#x27;s introduction to Ann Arbor, Michigan.

Howard was the president of Vocational&#x27;s Senior Boys&#x27; Council. In the final days before his senior season decision regarding his college basketball team, Howard wavered between Arizona State and Michigan. He also made an official visit to Dayton. Despite the ongoing recruiting scandal, he made an unofficial visit to Illinois, which had recruited four of the five previous Chicago Public School League Illinois Players of the Year. At the time of his decision, Howard was considered one of the top five seniors in the country, but unlike many top basketball recruits, he decided not to hold a press conference to announce his choice. Although the official signing period was set for November 14–21, 1990, he selected Michigan on November 2. Howard&#x27;s grandmother died of a heart attack a few hours after he announced that he would attend Michigan, and he moved in with his high school coach, Richard Cook.

Howard averaged 26.9 points, 8.4 rebounds and 3.4 assists during his senior season, and finished in the top 10 percent of his academic class. He took Vocational to the Public League semifinals where they lost to Westinghouse College Prep, finishing with a 25–5 record, despite his 25 points and 12 rebounds. He befriended Jimmy King when they visited Michigan on the same weekend; according to the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; Fisher Howard influenced King&#x27;s decision to also enroll there. According to Clyde Travis of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot;, Howard&#x27;s verbal commitment made up for Fisher&#x27;s failure to recruit Eric Montross the prior year, even though Montross&#x27;s father and grandfather had played for Michigan. With Jalen Rose, Webber, Howard and King—along with Ray Jackson, a less-heralded prospect—the Michigan recruiting class was considered to be the best in the nation. Some regarded the class as among the greatest recruiting classes of all time.

As a senior, Howard edged Griffith and Kiwane Garris for the most votes to the &quot;Sun-Times&quot;&#x27; annual All-Chicago Public School League boys&#x27; basketball team. He was also selected to the All-Area team and was a repeat Class-AA All-State selection. Howard, Kleinschmidt and Robinson were all selected to the 10-member first team of &quot;Parade&quot; magazine&#x27;s 40-member high school All-America boys&#x27; basketball team. They were also chosen to play in the McDonald&#x27;s All-America game. West MVP Webber posted 28 points and 12 rebounds in the game; with Howard adding 16 points. The West won 108–106. Howard also earned the Gatorade Circle of Champions&#x27; Illinois Player of the Year Award. Howard&#x27;s ACT test score was high enough to make him eligible under Proposition 48 academic requirements to play as a freshman. Only eight of the top 25 Chicago Public School League players achieved a qualifying score on the test.

==College career==

===Freshman year===
Howard matriculated to the University of Michigan and joined his fellow freshmen for the 1991–92 Michigan Wolverines in forming a group that became known as the Fab Five. He also joined future NBA personalities Eric Riley and Rob Pelinka. As Michigan celebrated Midnight Madness on October 15, 1991, there was already talk that at least four of the five freshmen would be starting before the season ended. (The five eventually started in a combined 304 of a possible 350 man-games among them during their first two seasons.) Early in his freshman season, Howard started in some games and came off the bench in others for the highly rated Wolverines. Over time, he won a starting role from Riley. In Michigan&#x27;s first matchup against Illinois, Howard scored 13 points and denied Thomas the ball consistently enough to hold him to 8 shots. His biggest contribution in the game was getting his hand on a loose ball to force a jump ball with 16 seconds left and Michigan leading by only three points. In the Elite Eight round of the 1992 NCAA Division I men&#x27;s basketball tournament, Michigan faced a Jimmy Jackson-led Ohio State Buckeyes team that had beaten them twice during the regular season by double-digit margins. Michigan won the rematch, during which the Fab Five scored all but two of the Wolverines&#x27; points.

The victory gave the 24–8 Wolverines a berth in the Final Four, where they found themselves matched against a 29–4 Bob Huggins-coached Cincinnati Bearcats team that averaged 83.6 points per game and had lost to only three teams, two of which had beaten Michigan. Nick Van Exel led Cincinnati in postseason scoring. Howard, King and Riley shaved their heads for the game. Michigan won and earned a rematch with a Duke Blue Devils team that had beaten them by three points in overtime in December. In the initial contest, Howard had scored only four points. Entering the final game, he was averaging 11.2 points and 6.3 rebounds for the season. The day before the game, Howard had stomach cramps and fever and received fluids to combat dehydration. As a result, he was exempted from mandatory media meetings. Howard was part of a rotation with Webber and Riley that guarded the National Player of the Year, Christian Laettner. During Laettner&#x27;s first six possessions against Howard, Laettner dribbled the basketball off his foot, missed a shot, threw a pass that resulted in a turnover, traveled, threw the ball away and hit the backboard with a shot. Duke scored in its final 12 possessions of the championship game, going on a 23–6 run to win by a final margin of 71–51. Despite his condition, Howard contributed 9 points in 29 minutes. Howard earned a reputation for his quick feet, ability to grasp fundamentals, and excellent moves in the low post, but also for his 1-to-2 assist-to-turnover ratio and a high number of fouls.

===Sophomore year===
As his sophomore year began, media reports alleged that three Wolverines basketball players were paid $300 each to participate in a charity basketball tournament in mid-1992, during the off-season. The reports further alleged that some others, including Howard, appeared at several summer basketball camps together, which was a possible violation of NCAA rules. At the beginning of his 1992–93 sophomore season, Michigan returned its top nine scorers and began the season ranked number one in the country by the Associated Press. Michigan lost its second game of the season in a rematch with Duke. Howard was described as the steadiest player on the team that season by coach Fisher. During the season, Howard purchased a million-dollar disability insurance policy approved by the NCAA under the Exceptional Student Athlete Disability Insurance Program available to student-athletes who are projected to be chosen high in the NBA, National Football League (NFL), and Major League Baseball drafts.

In the semifinals of the 1993 NCAA Division I men&#x27;s basketball tournament against Kentucky, Howard contributed on offense and held Jamal Mashburn in check defensively; Mashburn did not make a field goal in the last 12:36 of regulation. Sportswriter Jay Mariotti wrote that Howard had done &quot;a terrific defensive job&quot; in guarding Mashburn. The 31–4 Wolverines were matched up against the 33–4 North Carolina Tar Heels in the championship game; both Fisher and North Carolina head coach Dean Smith were seeking their second national title. During the championship game Howard picked up his second personal foul with 9 minutes 42 seconds remaining in the first half and was soon substituted out as the entire team dealt with an accumulation of fouls. The game would be remembered for a late technical foul against Webber for attempting to call a time out when the Wolverines had none left; this led to a Tar Heels victory. Over the course of the season, Howard averaged 14.6 points and 7.4 rebounds. After the season, Webber and Howard were invited to try out for the United States national basketball team that would compete at the 1993 World University Games and Under-22 World Championships. Howard did not make the team.

===Junior year===
With Webber&#x27;s departure for the NBA after his sophomore season, the 1993–94 Wolverines team entered the season ranked fifth in the nation as it opened the season against number 13 . Since his grandmother had been born on December 25, Howard got a tattoo reading &quot;Jannie Mae&quot; over his heart during Christmas break. During the season, Howard contracted the chicken pox in January. Michigan had a 21–6 (13–4 Big Ten) record and tied with the Purdue Boilermakers for the conference lead with one game remaining. Michigan then lost (for the third time in its last four games) to a struggling team, and finished second in the Big Ten. After the season, Howard was selected as a first team All-Big-Ten member along with his teammate Rose, Purdue&#x27;s Robinson, Michigan State&#x27;s Shawn Respert, and Indiana&#x27;s Damon Bailey. In the opening round of the 1994 NCAA Division I men&#x27;s basketball tournament, Howard helped Michigan to a 78–74 overtime victory over Pepperdine by scoring 28 points and adding 9 rebounds before fouling out. In the second round, Howard posted 34 points and 18 rebounds to lead the team to an 84–79 victory over Texas. Michigan faced a Joe Smith-led Maryland in the Sweet Sixteen round. Howard scored 24 points and had 11 rebounds before fouling out with 2:49 remaining in the 78–71 victory. Howard earned the regional MVP award with a game-high 30 points and 13 rebounds in the Elite Eight round, despite collecting two fouls in the first two minutes and losing against the Arkansas Razorbacks, which had United States President Bill Clinton in attendance as a vocal supporter.

On April 18, Howard announced his intention to enter the 1994 NBA draft. The following day, Rose announced he would enter the draft as well. Howard was 37 credit hours short of University of Michigan degree requirements, but said he intended to keep his promise to his grandmother that he would earn his diploma.
Howard left Michigan after being named an Associated Press third team All-American during his junior year, and was taken by the Washington Bullets fifth overall in the 1994 NBA Draft. Howard was represented by David Falk.

===Graduation===
Howard became the first NBA athlete who entered the draft early and graduated with his academic class, thus fulfilling a promise he had made to his grandmother on the last day he saw her alive. He told Mitch Albom that when he made it to the NBA, he realized how much leisure time the multimillionaire players had and decided to do something productive instead of find ways to spend his new riches. &quot;I knew if I kept pushing it off, I&#x27;d never get it done&quot;, he said. He completed his final 32 course hours by taking summer classes in 1994 during the NBA off-season. He took correspondence classes and independent study courses during the following season, studying on road trips and mailing in his papers from the nearest post office. In the end, he earned a Bachelor of Arts degree in communications at Michigan. He told Albom that earning his degree made him a better example when speaking about staying in school. Although Howard had spent the prior year playing in the NBA, he returned to campus to partake in graduation ceremonies with his classmates. During the graduation, keynote speaker Marian Wright Edelman paid special recognition to Howard and Fab Five teammates King and Jackson, who graduated together, and noted that Howard&#x27;s graduation made him a role model for children.

===Forfeits===
Although the Fab Five&#x27;s games in the Final Four have since been forfeited, Howard was not among the players, which included Robert Traylor, Webber, Rose, Maurice Taylor, and Louis Bullock, called before a grand jury to testify in the University of Michigan basketball scandal. He was not implicated in the scandal. Although Michigan erased many of its records and accomplishments from 1992 to 1998 as part of self-imposed sanctions, Howard&#x27;s status as a 1993–94 All-American remained intact.

==Professional career==

===Washington Bullets / Wizards (1994–2001)===

====1994–95 season: Rookie season====
Entering the , the NBA players and owners had not yet agreed on the terms of a new collective bargaining agreement, and Howard was unsigned two weeks before training camp began. He continued to train in Chicago in late September amidst rumors that his draft rights could be traded to another team. While holding out, he was rumored to be part of a trade package with the Chicago Bulls that included Calbert Cheaney and a first-round draft choice in exchange for Scottie Pippen. Another rumor had Howard being packaged with Rex Chapman and Don MacLean for Pippen. On November 9, eleventh overall 1994 NBA draft selection Carlos Rogers signed an NBA contract, making Howard the last first-round selection without a contract. He missed most of the first month of the season and resided at an O&#x27;Hare Airport hotel while protracted talks continued. Howard&#x27;s agent David Falk said that one of the main problems was that the Bullets wanted Howard to sign for a lower average salary than number six selection Sharone Wright. The Bullets stuck to a 10-year, $30 million ($ million in dollars) offer. On November 17, Howard signed what was believed to be a 12-year, $37.5 million ($ million) contract. Howard&#x27;s contract, which &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; later said was an 11-year $36 million ($ million) deal, had an escape clause. Once he signed, he was reunited with Michigan teammate Webber as a member of the Bullets. Webber, who had also sat out training camp and the first eight games of the season, was traded from the to the Bullets on November 18 for Tom Gugliotta and three first-round draft choices.

After Webber joined the Bullets, many thought that the two former Fab Five members would bring success to the team, coached by Lynam. The Washington front line was expected to include Webber, Howard, and Kevin Duckworth and to have Gheorghe Mureșan, a Romanian center, coming off the bench. Chapman, MacLean, Cheaney, Mitchell Butler and Scott Skiles were expected to provide solid perimeter play. Experts projected the Bullets as contenders for the Eastern Conference title. The Howard/Webber Bullets debut against the Boston Celtics established new Bullets television ratings records for the Home Team Sports network. However, the early season trade left the team in a state of confusion due to lack of familiarity, which resulted in communication difficulties on the court. Howard eventually moved into the starting lineup. As a power forward, Howard posted impressive numbers after he became a regular starter. Howard participated in the February 11, 1995, NBA All-Star weekend events as a member of the Rookie Challenge. He earned second team All-Rookie honors at the end of the season. That month, he became the second Bullet (since the award&#x27;s inception in 1981) and first since Jeff Ruland in January 1982 to be named NBA Rookie of the Month. During the month he averaged 20.1 points, 8 rebounds and 1.2 blocks in 14 games, including his first two 30-point games. The following month Howard suffered an ankle injury, missing a total of 10 games (all of which were Bullets losses). Over the course of the season, he averaged 17.0 points per game and posted 17 double-doubles in 65 games played (52 starts). He totalled 30 points or more on three separate occasions.

At the end of his rookie season Howard finished his undergraduate degree, and graduated from the University of Michigan, becoming the first NBA player to graduate after leaving college early.

====1995–96 season: All-Star selection====
In the preseason, the Bullets played the Detroit Pistons in an October game at the University of Michigan&#x27;s Crisler Arena, marking a homecoming for Howard. Webber was sidelined with a shoulder injury and missed the homecoming. Prior to the 1995–96 season, the Bullets were expected to be a contender with Webber, Howard, Muresan, Mark Price, and Robert Pack. However, Webber, Price and Pack missed almost the entire year (65, 75 and 51 games, respectively) because of injuries.

Howard earned his only career NBA All-Star Game selection for the February 11, 1996 game. He concluded the season by scoring at least 20 points in his last 16 games. Howard became just the second player in Washington franchise history, after Bernard King, to post back-to-back 40-point games (against Boston on April 17, 1996, with 40, and at Toronto on April 19, 1996, with 42). The 42 points proved to be his career high. His strong finish earned him an NBA Player of the Month award for April. In spite of the injuries to key teammates, 1995–96 was Howard&#x27;s best season, statistically. During the season, he finished third in the NBA in minutes played, 6th in points scored and 10th in points per game (22.1). He was the Bullets&#x27; leading scorer. Over the course of the season, he accumulated 22 double-doubles in 81 games, including 6 in his last 8 games. At the end of the season, he was named to the All-NBA team. In addition to his two 40-point performances, he posted 3 additional 30-point performances and scored at least 20 points in 56 of 81 games. Averaging 22.1 points, 8.1 rebounds and 4.4 assists, he helped the Bullets record 39 victories. This was not enough for the Bullets to make the playoffs during their ninth consecutive losing season.

====1996–97 season: Free agency dispute====
After averaging 17 points per game as a rookie and more than 22 per game in his second season, Howard became a free agent when the Bullets made some salary cap transactions. The Bullets offered Howard an $89 million contract, but the Miami Heat outbid them with a seven-year deal estimated to be worth $98 to $101 million. However, according to the NBA league office, the Heat miscalculated their available salary under the salary cap by excluding performance bonuses for Tim Hardaway and P. J. Brown and failing to account for the impact of renegotiating Alonzo Mourning&#x27;s contract before coming to terms with Howard. The league rejected the contract on July 31 because Howard&#x27;s $9 million for the 1996–97 season placed the Heat over the cap. Howard then re-signed with the Bullets on August 5. He became the first player in NBA history to sign a contract worth more than $100 million; his seven-year contract was worth $105 million (). The league ruled on August 5 that the Bullets could re-sign Howard after having renounced his rights on July 15 to free up cap room to sign Tracy Murray and Lorenzo Williams if they forfeited their 1997 NBA draft first-round selection rights. The Bullets were not limited by the cap because they were re-signing their own player. The Heat pursued legal remedy in Florida state courts, seeking acknowledgment of the prior validity and superiority of their earlier contract. Although an arbitration case involving the two contracts that Howard had signed appeared likely, ESPN reported that the Heat dropped their legal pursuit of Howard. The league moved for federal jurisdiction although the case remained on the docket for New York University Law professor Daniel Collins to serve as arbitrator on three issues. Meanwhile, the Heat&#x27;s contract was protected by a temporary injunction in Florida state court, which forbade any newer contract by Howard from abrogating his Miami contract. The Heat eventually dropped their case but the team, especially head coach Pat Riley, continued to vehemently claim that their case of wrongdoing in the form of erroneous rulings by the league had been very solid. If the Heat had pursued arbitration and had been found guilty of violating the salary cap, the team could have been fined $5 million and Heat coach Riley could have been suspended for the season. By dropping their actions, the Heat avoided any possible penalties.

As a statement against gun violence, Bullets owner Abe Pollin sought to change the franchise&#x27;s name. The Bullets became the after asking fans to vote on the name. Although before the 1996–97 NBA season the Bullets/Wizards were expected to make the playoffs with Webber, Howard, and Strickland, there were rumors that Webber had difficulty adjusting to being a less important part of the offensive game plan in the presence of All-Star Howard. Howard was plagued with shin splints, causing him to miss several preseason games. On November 11, 1996, Howard failed a sobriety test when he was caught speeding and was charged with driving while intoxicated. The following month he pleaded not guilty and committed to enter an alcohol rehabilitation and education program. After Lynam coached the Bullets to a 22–24 record, he was fired and the Bullets hired Bernie Bickerstaff, who posted a 22–13 record. Over the course of the 1996–97 season, Howard accumulated 24 double-doubles in 82 games, while averaging 19.1 points and 8.1 rebounds. Although Howard averaged over 19 points per game and played all 82 games, he only scored 30 or more points twice during the regular season. The team finished its regular season with a 44–38 record but was swept in three games in the Eastern Conference first round by the Chicago Bulls, who went on to win their second consecutive NBA championship. The 1997 NBA Playoffs were Howard&#x27;s only NBA playoff appearance in his six-plus seasons with the Washington franchise, and he averaged 18.7 points and 6 rebounds while playing 43 minutes per game. The playoff appearance marked the franchise&#x27;s first since the 1988.

====1997–98 season====
The relocated from the US Airways Arena to the MCI Center for the 1997–98 season, during which Howard totaled 11 double-doubles in 64 games, while averaging 18.5 points and 8.0 rebounds. He scored between 20 and 29 points 31 times that season but failed to score 30 points in any game. Howard injured his ankle and was unable to play between February 5 and March 17. During Bickerstaff&#x27;s only full season as the Washington coach, the team posted a 42–40 record.

====1998–99 season====
After the 1998–99 NBA lockout, the posted an 18–32 record in the shortened season. The team started out 13–19 under Bickerstaff and was 5–13 under Jim Brovelli after Bickerstaff was fired. Howard was a vocal critic of Bickerstaff throughout his tenure, stating the coach was unable to make proper in-game adjustments. Howard, who again had an ankle injury, missed the last 14 games of the season. Over the course of the 1998–99 season, he posted 11 double-doubles and two 15-rebound performances in 36 games, while averaging 18.9 points and 7.0 rebounds.

====1999–00 season====
During the 1999–2000 season, Howard accumulated 10 double-doubles in 82 games, while averaging 14.9 points and 8.1 rebounds. The endured a 14–30 start under head coach Gar Heard before going 15–23 under Heard&#x27;s replacement, Darrell Walker. According to Sam Smith from the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot;, Howard had become unpopular and a bit of a disappointment by his sixth season in Washington. He posted 30 points twice, including a season-high 36 in a fourth-quarter comeback to end a five-game losing streak in January. During the offseason, Howard&#x27;s name surfaced in trade rumors that had him going to the New York Knicks in exchange for Ewing because the Wizards&#x27; management thought that the trade would better position the team for the 2001 free agent market. Following the season, Walker was replaced by Leonard Hamilton, becoming the team&#x27;s sixth head coach since last making the NBA playoffs four years earlier.

====2000–01 season====
Although it had been five years since his only All-Star appearance, Howard was the fourth-highest-paid player in the NBA during the 2000–01 season, behind Kevin Garnett, Shaquille O&#x27;Neal and Mourning. Howard, along with Strickland and Richmond, were marquee names on the team under contract to earn at least $10 million. On December 31, 2000, Howard, posted his career high of 15 made free throws in a game against the .

===Dallas Mavericks (2001–2002)===
Michael Jordan, who had become the Wizards&#x27; head of basketball operations the prior season, traded Howard, Obinna Ekezie, and Calvin Booth to the for Laettner, Loy Vaught, Etan Thomas, Hubert Davis, Courtney Alexander and $3 million on February 22, 2001, at the NBA trade deadline. Jordan&#x27;s move was praised for freeing up salary cap space in advance of the NBA&#x27;s first season with a luxury tax. The trade served the Mavericks by giving them a new offensive weapon and enabling them to match up defensively against the NBA Western Conference power forwards such as Wallace, Tim Duncan, Karl Malone and Webber. Washington finished the year with a 19–63 record under coach Hamilton.

During the 2000–01 season, the Mavericks finished 53–29 under coach Don Nelson. Howard provided the Mavericks with a back-to-the-basket player who moved into the starting power-forward position, enabling Dirk Nowitzki to play small forward and Shawn Bradley to play center. During the season, Howard tallied 16 double-doubles and five 30-point performances in 81 games, while averaging 18.0 points and 7.1 rebounds. On a team with All-Star Michael Finley and future MVPs Steve Nash and Nowitzki, Howard was the highest-paid player. On March 20, Howard blocked five shots, his career high, against the . In the 2001 NBA Playoffs, the Mavericks advanced past the 3 games to 2 before losing to the , 4 games to 1. The Utah games marked the first time Howard played for a team that won an NBA playoff series. In the first game of the series against the Spurs, Howard slammed Spurs guard Derek Anderson to the floor while trying to block Anderson&#x27;s layup late in the game. Anderson suffered a separated shoulder on the play, and Howard received a flagrant foul and was ejected. After the game, Howard, Spurs coach Gregg Popovich, and Mavs owner Mark Cuban all said the foul was committed without malice or intent to injure Anderson. In the Mavericks&#x27; 10 playoff games, Howard totaled three double-doubles while averaging 13.4 points and 8.3 rebounds in 39.1 minutes.

During the 2001–02 season, he posted 17 double-doubles and three 30-point performances in 81 games (72 starts), while averaging 14.6 points and 7.6 rebounds. This was the first time since his rookie holdout season that he did not start every game he played in. All reserve appearances occurred between November 21 and December 11, and eight of them were in consecutive games between November 21 and December 5. On January 31, he posted a career-high 16 rebounds against the .

===Denver Nuggets (2002–2003)===
The Mavericks traded Howard with Donnell Harvey, Hardaway and a 2002 first-round pick to the for Raef LaFrentz, Avery Johnson, Van Exel and Tariq Abdul-Wahad on February 21, 2002. At the time of the trade, Howard was considered the Mavericks&#x27; best low-post defender. On March 25, 2002, he scored his 10,000th career point at Madison Square Garden against the New York Knicks. Howard started all 28 games that he played for the Nuggets. Don Nelson&#x27;s Mavericks went to the second round of the 2002 NBA Playoffs after trading Howard, while the Nuggets failed to make the playoffs under coaches Dan Issel and Mike Evans. By the end of the season, Nuggets general manager Vandeweghe had cleared almost $20 million of salary cap space, leaving the team with few veterans and only Howard and Marcus Camby as well-known players. This made the team an undesirable coaching assignment for veteran coaches. In the offseason, the Nuggets replaced Evans with the relatively unknown Jeff Bzdelik.

During a preseason game, Howard attempted to punch Al Harrington and Jermaine O&#x27;Neal, which earned him a suspension on October 25, 2002. As a result, Howard missed the &#x27; first two games of the regular season, and this cost him $458,000 in salary. Howard first attempted to hit Harrington late in the fourth quarter on a night when Howard had missed nine of ten shots. When O&#x27;Neal intervened, the two pushed and shoved each other before Howard started punching again. At around the same time, the University of Michigan basketball scandal investigation came to an end with many of the accomplishments of the Fab Five being rescinded through National Collegiate Athletic Association sanctions. Although many of the records of the Fab Five were erased, Howard&#x27;s and teammate Rose&#x27;s 1994 All-American recognitions were unaffected by the scandal. During the 2002–03 regular season, he accumulated 18 double-doubles, two 30-point performances, and three 15-rebound performances in 77 games, while averaging 18.4 points and 7.6 rebounds. The 2002–03 Nuggets were 17–65 under Bzdelik. Howard started all 77 games in which he played. The team struggled with three rookies in the starting lineup.

===Orlando Magic (2003–2004)===
Howard signed what was believed to be a five-year, $28 million contract as a free agent with the on July 16, 2003; he had been expected to sign with either Detroit or Minnesota. During the season, teammate Tracy McGrady successfully defended his scoring championship, while Howard attempted to be a positive influence when the situation arose, such as when he attempted to stop McGrady from kicking the basketball into the stands twice in a row. McGrady missed the last 10 games of the season with knee problems (ending his season on March 24), leading to Howard&#x27;s best performances of the season: Howard had 33 points and 11 rebounds on April 2 against the , and he had 38 points on April 12 against the . Over the course of the 2003–04 season, he had 16 double-doubles and two 30-point performances in 81 games (77 starts), while averaging 17.2 points and 7.1 rebounds. The team compiled a 21–61 record, the worst in the NBA, under coaches Doc Rivers and Johnny Davis.

===Houston Rockets (2004–2007)===
On June 29, 2004, Howard and Magic teammates McGrady, Tyronn Lue and Reece Gaines were part of a seven-player trade that sent starting guards Steve Francis and Cuttino Mobley, plus Kelvin Cato, to the Magic. Howard became the regular starting power forward on December 2 and started for the rest of the season.

The 2004–05 Rockets were 51–31 under Van Gundy and lost in the first round of the 2005 NBA playoffs to the , four games to three. Although the Rockets made the playoffs, Howard&#x27;s season ended on March 14, when he left a game with a sprained medial collateral ligament (MCL) in his right knee. Initially, the injury was supposed to sideline Howard for four weeks. The injury coincided with a period in which he developed symptoms of viral myocarditis, including heart palpitations, mild chest pains and fever and was diagnosed with a viral infection in his heart. His limited physical activity impaired his MCL rehabilitation. Over the course of the 2004–05 season, Howard achieved seven double-doubles in 61 games (47 starts), while averaging 9.6 points and 5.7 rebounds.

During the 2005–06 season, Howard recorded 10 double-doubles and two 30-point performances in 80 games (all as a starter), while averaging 11.8 points and 6.7 rebounds. He played 31.7 minutes per game, and this was the last season in which he averaged 30 minutes per game; this was also the final season in which Howard started at least half of the games in which he played. The were 34–48 under Van Gundy and missed the playoffs. Howard was suspended one game without pay in January for shoving the basketball into the face of Toronto guard Mike James in an exchange that occurred after Howard fouled James on a drive to the basket. Howard posted a season-high 31 points on April 17, 2006, against the Denver Nuggets.

In the 2006–07 season, Howard achieved nine double-doubles in 80 games played (37 starts), while averaging 9.7 points and 5.9 rebounds. His 26.5 minutes per game marked a new career low. Howard only started 38 games, including 32 consecutive starts between December 26, 2006, and March 3, 2007.The 2006–07 Rockets were 52–30 under Van Gundy for the regular season. The Rockets entered the 2007 NBA Playoffs with little experience; Howard was one of only three players on the team (along with Rafer Alston and Dikembe Mutombo) to have previously won any NBA playoff series. Once the playoffs began, Howard served as a key reserve on the Rockets&#x27; short bench rotation that also included Luther Head and Mutombo. The Rockets managed to split the first 4 games even though Head and Howard only combined to average 7.6 points, including a combined pointless 0-for-10 game three. Although Howard had a productive game five with 12 points and 6 rebounds which contributed to a Rockets victory, the team lost in the first round of the 2007 playoffs to the , four games to three. In the playoffs, reserve Howard averaged 5.0 points and 4.4 rebounds in 22.4 minutes.

===Return to Dallas (2007–2008)===
On June 14, 2007, Howard was traded to the Minnesota Timberwolves for Mike James and Justin Reed. According to ESPN, he regretted not choosing Minnesota the last time he had been a free agent and was looking forward to playing with Garnett. Soon after Howard signed with Minnesota, the team traded Garnett to the Boston Celtics. Howard made it clear he was not interested in being on a team in Minnesota that was focused on developing young talent and consequently requested a trade once Garnett was no longer a member of the team. Howard still had $6.88 million and $7.38 million in salary owed to him over the next two seasons, which made him difficult to trade. Timberwolves owner Glen Taylor noted that the team would attempt to accommodate his wishes but acknowledged that doing so would be difficult. On October 29, 2007, the Timberwolves waived Howard after agreeing to a contractual buyout agreement worth $10 million spread over four years instead of the roughly $14.25 million ($6.88 million plus $7.38 million) that Minnesota would otherwise have owed him.

Howard agreed to terms with the Dallas Mavericks on October 30, 2007, but was not able to officially sign until the next day, when he cleared waivers. Terms of the deal were not disclosed publicly. During the 2007–08 season, he played in 50 games and made no starts, while averaging 1.1 points and 1.6 rebounds. In his limited role he never played more than 18 minutes and had season-highs of seven rebounds and six points. The 2007–08 Mavericks were 51–31 under coach Johnson and lost in the first round of the 2008 NBA Playoffs to the New Orleans Hornets four games to one. In the playoffs, Howard only appeared for a total of 11 minutes in three games. This was the first season in Howard&#x27;s career in which he did not start in a single game.

===Return to Denver (2008)===
On October 3, 2008, Howard rejoined the Denver Nuggets, but was later released when the Nuggets made a three-for-one trade of Allen Iverson for Chauncey Billups, Antonio McDyess and Cheikh Samb on November 3 that put them over the 15-man roster size limit. Before the trade, Howard had played in three games during the 2008–09 season.

===Charlotte Bobcats (2008–2009)===
On December 12, 2008, he was signed by the Charlotte Bobcats. During the 2008–09 season, he played in 42 games, making two starts; Howard averaged 4.1 points and 1.8 rebounds. In his reserve role, he played more than 20 minutes five times, including four straight appearances from January 28 to February 8, and had season-highs of five rebounds and 14 points. He posted 10 or more points five times. Howard played extended minutes on January 28, the night after Gerald Wallace suffered a left-lung collapse and a non-displaced fracture of the fifth rib from a flagrant foul by Andrew Bynum; in 24 minutes of action, he scored 9 points. During Howard&#x27;s streak of 20-minute appearances, he sat out one intervening game on February 6 with a toe injury. On February 8, in only his second start as a Bobcat, he played a season-high 30 minutes, 39 seconds and posted a season-high 14 points. The subsequent night, Howard was out of the lineup again with a toe injury. The 2008–09 Bobcats were 35–47 under coach Larry Brown.

===Portland Trail Blazers (2009–2010)===
On September 17, 2009, Howard signed a one-year contract with the Portland Trail Blazers. On December 22, center Joel Przybilla injured his knee in the first quarter, allowing Howard to play additional minutes, which allowed Howard his first double-double since April 6, 2007. He had his other double-double of the 2009–10 season the next night when he made his first start of the season. All of Howard&#x27;s performances with 10 rebounds or more occurred between December 22 and February 3. December 23 marked the start of 14 consecutive starting appearances and 24 starts in 26 appearances (ending on February 16) for him. Having lost Przybilla and Greg Oden for the season, Portland acquired Camby from the Los Angeles Clippers for Steve Blake and Travis Outlaw on February 17 prior to the trade deadline. During the 2009–10 season, he accumulated two double-doubles, played in 73 games, and made 27 starts, while averaging 6.0 points and 4.6 rebounds.

On July 20, 2010, Howard came to terms for the 2010–11 NBA season with the Miami Heat on a one-year contract for the veteran&#x27;s minimum salary, which was $1,352,181. Although he was only paid the minimum by the Heat, he was in the final year of his four-year buyout from the Timberwolves. By joining the Heat, Howard joined a team that by the time of the 2011 NBA playoffs, included former champion Dwyane Wade as well as a group of players such as LeBron James and Chris Bosh. In March, he was featured in the documentary film &quot;The Fab Five&quot;, which was about his time as a Wolverine, that reignited controversy and reinvigorated the Duke–Michigan basketball rivalry. For the season, Howard played 57 games for the 2010–11 Heat, all as a reserve. He averaged 2.4 points and 2.1 rebounds with season highs of 18 points and 7 rebounds. The Heat reached the NBA Finals, losing to the Dallas Mavericks four games to two. Howard averaged 1.5 points and .9 rebounds per game during the postseason.

On December 10, 2011, Howard re-signed with the Heat for the same veteran&#x27;s minimum salary as the year before. Howard appeared in 28 regular season games as a reserve with limited minutes. At age 39, Howard was the third-oldest active player in the league during the 2011–12 NBA season, behind Kurt Thomas and Grant Hill. On June 21, 2012, Howard became the first and only member of the Fab Five to win an NBA championship, as a role player on the 2011–12 Miami Heat. Following the season, Howard became an unrestricted free agent. At the 20th annual ESPY Awards, Howard and Heat teammate Mike Miller took to the stage to accept the award for Team of the Year.

Howard&#x27;s April 17 start in the season finale against the Orlando Magic marked Howard&#x27;s 900th career start. With the retirement of Grant Hill on June 1, 2013, Howard became the oldest active player in the NBA at age 40. During the playoffs, Howard did not play.

==Player profile==
In college, Howard was regarded as one of the best defensive big men in the country. According to Mariotti, he was also regarded as a &quot;rock-solid&quot; power forward who provided rebounds and defense, in contrast to his flamboyant teammate Webber. Fisher referred to Howard as his &quot;Rock of Gibraltar&quot;. His consistency was described by &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; journalist Skip Myslenski as Michigan&#x27;s &quot;ballast, steadying them on those many occasions when they wavered. And their savior, rescuing them from their many follies&quot;.

After the 1994 draft, NBA analyst Doug Collins described Howard as a player who could &quot;play with his back to the basket&quot; and &quot;shoot from about 16 feet outside&quot; and who played &quot;with a lot of energy and emotion&quot;. The Bullets&#x27; general manager, John Nash, who was disappointed that Jason Kidd was no longer available at the fifth pick of the draft, told Jerry Bembry of &quot;The Baltimore Sun&quot; that Howard was &quot;as fundamentally sound as any player in the draft&quot; and that he &quot;[had] a discipline about his game and [used] a high level of skill and technique&quot;. Bembry said, &quot;Not only can Howard post up, he passes effectively and is able to hit a jumper up to 17 feet&quot;, adding that he also was &quot;an excellent position defender&quot;. Later Bembry noted that he was a power forward who was able to play center, adding that at Michigan he was &quot;most effective playing with his back to the basket&quot; but could also pass effectively and hit medium-range jumpers. The Bullets&#x27; head coach, Jim Lynam, described Howard as a &quot;complete player&quot; and noted, &quot;[H]e can defend you and he can score over you&quot;. Nash said that &quot;the things that impressed me most about him were his character, his intelligence and his insight. He&#x27;s a leader type.&quot;

When he first became a free agent in 1996, Howard was described as versatile enough to play all three front-line positions (small forward, power forward and center), and Michael Jordan praised his &quot;game, work ethic and character&quot;. As a Dallas player in 2000–01, he was still regarded as a versatile offensive player who could &quot;take advantage of smaller defenders in the paint and then stretch his bigger defenders outside&quot; in addition to being a solid rebounder. By 2001, Lacy J. Banks from the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; regarded him as a high-priced, under-achieving player, but in 2002, Banks described him as a solid veteran at the four (power forward position). In the NBA, Howard developed a respected inside post-up game and a reputation as a veteran leader, according to Kiki Vandeweghe, the general manager of the Denver Nuggets, Howard&#x27;s team in 2003.

When he signed with the Heat in 2010, Howard was lauded for his ability to play the power forward and center positions and for his professionalism. Howard also added frontcourt toughness. As an elder statesman with the Heat, he was regarded as a future NBA coach or general manager.

==Coaching career==

===Miami Heat (2013–2019)===
On September 28, 2013, the Heat announced a reshuffling of their organization. The reshuffling included the announcement that Howard would remain with the Heat, moving officially into an assistant coaching role. The assistant coaching position was available after both Chad Kammerer and Keith Askins were moved from coaching to scouting positions. This effectively indicated Howard&#x27;s retirement as a basketball player, as league regulations prohibit one from holding a coaching position while being an active player. Howard spent six seasons with the Heat as an assistant coach. In his first year, the Heat reached the 2014 NBA Finals in the final year of the LeBron James, Dwyane Wade, and Chris Bosh trio, where they lost to the Spurs in 5 games. The Heat went on to make two more playoff appearances in Howard&#x27;s remaining time as an assistant coach in Miami. 

Howard coached a number of All-Stars while with the Heat, including LeBron James, Dwyane Wade, Chris Bosh, Ray Allen, Jimmy Butler and Bam Adebayo.

<text>The Leelanau Peninsula ( ) is a peninsula of the U.S. state of Michigan that extends about from the western side of the Lower Peninsula of Michigan into Lake Michigan, forming Grand Traverse Bay. It is often referred to as the &quot;little finger&quot; of the mitten-shaped lower peninsula. The peninsula is a tourist hotspot, especially due to the popularity of Sleeping Bear Dunes National Lakeshore, which adorns the southwestern coast of the peninsula. The peninsula is also largely agricultural, and is a production hotspot for cherries and wine.

Most of the peninsula is politically part of the eponymous Leelanau County, which also administers the nearby Manitou Islands and Fox Islands. The base of the peninsula, at its southern end, is divided between Benzie County and Grand Traverse County. Traverse City, the largest city in Northern Michigan, is located at the southeastern end of the peninsula, at the head of Grand Traverse Bay.

==Geography==
The Leelanau Peninsula is a roughly triangular-shaped peninsula that extends about off of Michigan&#x27;s Lower Peninsula into Lake Michigan. The peninsula forms the western shore of the Grand Traverse Bay. At its base, the peninsula is about wide.

Nearby the peninsula, in Lake Michigan, lie North Manitou and South Manitou islands, as well as the smaller Fox Islands, all of which are under jurisdiction of Leelanau County. In Grand Traverse Bay lie two islands, Bellow Island and Power Island, the latter of which is administered by Grand Traverse County. Traverse City, the largest municipality in Northern Michigan, is located at the base of the peninsula on the east side, at the head of Grand Traverse Bay.

East of the Leelanau Peninsula is the smaller Old Mission Peninsula. This peninsula, which is part of the neighboring Grand Traverse County, is much thinner than the Leelanau, only about at its widest, and only about half the length, at .

M-22 is a famous highway that runs along the coast of the Leelanau Peninsula, as well as further south down Lake Michigan. M-72 and M-204 are other highways that cross the Leelanau Peninsula west–east; M-72 runs across the base of the peninsula from Empire to Traverse City, while M-204 crosses roughly halfway up the peninsula, from Leland to Suttons Bay via Lake Leelanau. Another highway, US 31 between Beulah and Chums Corner, runs parallel to M-72 and M-204, although it lies a few miles south of the base of the Leelanau Peninsula.

=== Climate and agriculture ===
The entire Leelanau Peninsula lies within a warm-summer humid continental climate, or &quot;Dfb&quot; under the Köppen climate classification. Also known as a hemiboreal climate, the peninsula is subject to generally warm, mild summers, and severe winters.

The location of the peninsula along the 45th parallel is tempered by the strong and moderating effects of Lake Michigan and Grand Traverse Bay, which allow the peninsula to play host to an agricultural mecca. These conditions allow apple and cherry production to flourish on the peninsula. Additionally the Leelanau Peninsula AVA is known for being one of the best Michigan wine regions and is a designated American Viticultural Area (AVA).

=== Waterways ===
The Leelanau Peninsula is home to a number of lakes and rivers. Lake Leelanau, at nearly long, separates much of the east of the peninsula from the rest, and forms an isthmus with Grand Traverse Bay. The lake is traversable via the M-204 Lake Leelanau Narrows Bridge in the community of Lake Leelanau. The narrows, within the eponymous community, separate the lake into a North and South basin. Glen Lake, in the southwest of the peninsula, is also separated into two basins, known as &quot;Big&quot; and &quot;Little&quot; Glen Lake. Its narrows are also traversable, via a bridge along M-22. Lake Leelanau and Glen Lake are the 14th and 18th largest lakes in Michigan, respectively. These lakes are drained by the Leland River and Crystal River, respectively.

=== Communities ===
Communities on the Leelanau Peninsula include:
* Cedar
* Empire
* Glen Arbor
* Glen Haven
* Greilickville
* Maple City
* Lake Leelanau
* Leland
* Northport
* Northport Point
* Omena
* Peshawbestown
* Suttons Bay
* Traverse City (part of Slabtown neighborhood)

The Grand Traverse Band of Ottawa &amp; Chippewa Indians are a federally-recognized tribe located on the peninsula around Peshawbestown. Their ancestors were among the Algonquian-speaking tribes that largely occupied this area prior to European colonization.

== History ==
The first peoples of Northern Michigan were the Odawa, Ojibwe, and Potawatomi, collectively known as the Council of Three Fires. The Leelanau Peninsula, as well as much of Northern Michigan and the Upper Peninsula, was ceded from the first peoples to the United States in the 1836 Treaty of Washington. Leelanau County was set off in 1840 and organized in 1863.

The first railroads on the peninsula were built in 1892. Additional railroads would snake up the peninsula with lines from Lake Ann and Traverse City to Provemont, Suttons Bay, and Northport. The last railroad on the peninsula, from Traverse City to Northport via Suttons Bay, was removed in 1996. It was subsequently replaced with the Leelanau Trail, a recreational rail trail.

The Sleeping Bear Dunes National Lakeshore, the most renowned part of the peninsula, was authorized on October 21, 1970. The park&#x27;s creation was controversial because it involved the transfer of private property to public ownership. The federal government&#x27;s stance at the time was that the Great Lakes were the &quot;third coast&quot; and had to be preserved much like Cape Hatteras or Point Reyes, which are National Seashores.

=== Etymology ===
Native Americans who first inhabited the area called this land &quot;ke-ski-bi-ag,&quot; which means &quot;narrow body of water.&quot; 

&quot;Leelanau&quot; was traditionally said to be a Native American word meaning &quot;delight of life,&quot; but the name was more likely invented by Henry Rowe Schoolcraft, the United States Indian agent for the territory in the early 19th century, or his wife Jane Johnston Schoolcraft. Henry also used the name &quot;Leelinau&quot; for a character in his writing. Jane was the daughter of a prominent Scots-Irish Canadian fur trader and an Ojibwe chief&#x27;s daughter based in Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario and Michigan, and Henry learned about the Ojibwe (or Chippewa) through his wife&#x27;s and mother-in-law&#x27;s family. See Leelanau County for a more complete discussion of the etymology of the name.

Scholars have established, however, that Jane first used &quot;Leelinau&quot; as a pen name for her writings in &quot;The Literary Voyager&quot;, a family magazine which she and her husband wrote together and circulated among friends in the 1820s. She and her siblings were well-educated and she wrote in Ojibwe and English. 

While her writing was not published formally in her lifetime (except as her husband appropriated it under his own name), since the late 20th century Jane Johnston Schoolcraft has been recognized as &quot;the first Native American literary writer, the first known Indian woman writer, the first known Indian poet, the first known poet to write poems in a Native American language, and the first known American Indian to write out traditional Indian stories.&quot; In 2008 Jane Johnston Schoolcraft was inducted into the Michigan Women&#x27;s Hall of Fame.

== Recreation ==
Much of the Leelanau Peninsula is protected as parkland. The southwest of the peninsula is home to Sleeping Bear Dunes National Lakeshore. Within the lakeshore is the Port Oneida Rural Historic District, which preserves a historic ghost town. The northern tip of the peninsula is home to Leelanau State Park and the Grand Traverse Light. Tourists often visit communities such as Glen Arbor, Leland, Northport, and Suttons Bay. Leland is home to Fishtown, a historic commercial fishing area. Leland also is home to ferries that can be used to access the Manitou Islands.

<text>Patricia Gloria Goddard (born 23 December 1957) is a British television presenter. She is best known for her television talk show &quot;Trisha&quot; (1998–2010), which was broadcast on a mid-morning slot on ITV before later being moved to Channel 5, as well as a host on the Australian children&#x27;s show &quot;Play School&quot; from 1987 to 1998. Goddard has been based in the U.S. since 2010, when she started working on &quot;Maury&quot; as a conflict resolution expert. She also hosted a U.S. version of her own talk show titled &quot;The Trisha Goddard Show&quot; (2012–2014). Since 2022, Goddard has presented &quot;You Are What You Eat&quot;.
Goddard now lives in Connecticut, in the United States.

==Early life==
Patricia Gloria Goddard was born in London on 23 December 1957, the daughter of Agnes Fortune, an auxiliary nurse from Dominica, and an unknown father. She did not discover that the white man who raised her was not her biological father until after her mother&#x27;s death, though he was the biological father of her three sisters. In her late-50s, Goddard set out to find details of her biological father after a genetics expert insisted that her skin colour made it almost impossible for her to have a white father. As a child, she was educated at an independent school for expatriates in Tanzania, after which she returned to England to attend primary school in Heacham, Norfolk. She then joined Sir William Perkins&#x27;s School in Chertsey, Surrey, which was a voluntary controlled Church of England girls&#x27; grammar school at the time.

==Career==
Goddard&#x27;s early career as a flight attendant led to travel writing for magazines and then, after settling in Australia in the mid-1980s, a new career in television. She worked there as a television presenter, most notably on ABC&#x27;s &quot;The 7.30 Report&quot;, and also as a host of the children&#x27;s program &quot;Play School&quot;. 
In 1998, after returning to the United Kingdom, Goddard became the host of an ITV flagship daytime chat show, the BAFTA-winning &quot;Trisha&quot;, produced by Anglia Television. She launched her own independent television production company, Town House TV, with former Director of Programmes and Production for ITV Anglia, Malcolm Allsop.

In September 2004, Goddard left ITV to join Five in a new programme titled &quot;Trisha Goddard&quot;, which made its TV debut on 24 January 2005. Similar in style to her old show, it focussed on relationships, families in crisis, and reunions. The show was produced by Town House Productions. In the early stages of the show, it was observed that repeats of her ITV show continued to achieve higher ratings than her new programme on Five.

In January 2009, Five announced it would not be renewing her contract, for financial reasons.

Goddard has made a number of panellist appearances on ITV&#x27;s &quot;Loose Women&quot;, she was a regular panellist in 2002, made three appearances in 2003, with two further appearances in 2014, once in 2019 and the latest on 25 February 2021.

Goddard has appeared in satires of her television programmes. In 2003, a specially-shot clip of her show appeared in the ITV religious fantasy drama &quot;The Second Coming&quot;. In 2004, she filmed two short scenes for the romantic zombie comedy &quot;Shaun of the Dead&quot;. Both scenes were filmed on the set of &quot;Trisha&quot;. In 2004, a facsimile version of her show was featured on Season 3, Episode 1 of the show &quot;Fat Friends&quot; where she interviewed the &quot;slimming group&quot; of the main characters, and where Betty unintentionally revealed her secret that she had given up a baby at the age of fifteen. The episode showed the director telling Trisha to stay on Betty and wait until she revealed her secret.

Her show was also featured on a Comic Relief episode of &quot;Little Britain&quot; where the character Vicky Pollard met up with her long-lost father. For a &quot;What Not to Wear&quot; Christmas special aired on 22 December 2004, Goddard was given a fashion makeover by Trinny Woodall and Susannah Constantine.
 She appears very briefly in the 2006 &quot;Doctor Who&quot; episode &quot;Army of Ghosts&quot; in a parody episode of her own show entitled &quot;I Married a Ghost&quot;.

Goddard appeared as a guest on the BBC&#x27;s &quot;The Kumars at No. 42&quot; and was also the guest host for an episode of the second series of &quot;The Friday Night Project&quot;, for Channel 4. Goddard also had her own talk show on Liverpool radio station City Talk 105.9.

Goddard also made an appearance on &quot;Who Wants To Be A Millionaire?&quot; raising up to £75,000. She also made an appearance on the BBC show &quot;Shooting Stars&quot; in 2010. Also that year, she began to make occasional appearances on the American talk programme &quot;Maury&quot; as a consultant and a guest host.

On 20 October 2011, NBCUniversal Television Distribution announced that it would launch an American version of her eponymous talk show to start in September 2012. On 1 April 2014, it was announced that this version of the programme had been cancelled after two seasons.

In August 2017, Goddard guest hosted Channel Five&#x27;s &quot;The Wright Stuff&quot; for five episodes. She was a regular panellist on Channel 5&#x27;s &quot;Big Brother&#x27;s Bit on the Side&quot;. In February 2018, Trisha appeared on an episode of BBC One game show &quot;Pointless Celebrities&quot;, appearing alongside Johnny Vaughan and Toby Tarrant.

In 2020, Goddard took part in the twelfth series of &quot;Dancing on Ice&quot;. She was paired with Łukasz Różycki. They were the first couple voted off after the judges chose to save ITV News presenter Lucrezia Millarini and her skating partner Brendyn Hatfield.

In 2021, Goddard appeared on &quot;Piers Morgan&#x27;s Life Stories&quot;. On 5 March 2021 it was announced Goddard would present the new revived version of &quot;You Are What You Eat&quot;.

In 2021, she began presenting on Talkradio and its TV station equivalent, TalkTV, from April 2022.

In August 2024 Goddard appeared as a guest presenter on &quot;Good Morning Britain&quot;.

==Personal life==
===Family===
Goddard has three younger sisters, Pru, Paula, and Linda. Her youngest sister, Linda, battled schizophrenia and died in 1988 from complications arising from self-inflicted injuries. Goddard has cited this as one of her inspirations in becoming a mental health activist. She has also suffered her own mental health issues, having battled addiction and attempted suicide on at least two occasions.

===Relationships===
Goddard has been married four times and divorced three times. Her first marriage was to Robert Nestdale, an Australian politician and erstwhile director of Unicef Australia; whom she met in 1985 whilst working as a flight attendant. The marriage was short-lived: Nestdale was rumoured to be gay, and died from AIDS in 1989. Goddard has recorded that Nestdale was abusive to her during their relationship.
She met second husband Mark Grieve, a television producer, in 1987 and they were married in 1993. They had two children together and separated in 1996.
Her third husband, Peter Gianfrancesco, is a mental health services professional. They married in 1998, with Goddard&#x27;s children taking their stepfather&#x27;s surname. The couple divorced in 2017. In January 2022, Goddard posted on Instagram that she and her partner of four years, whom she often colloquially refers to as &#x27;Boo&#x27;, had got engaged. They married in August. Goddard lives in Connecticut, United States.

===Breast cancer===
Goddard has been diagnosed with breast cancer twice. First, in 2008, the cancer was treated and cured. In 2023, Goddard was diagnosed with breast cancer for a second time, however, this time it was Stage IV. In February 2024, she announced the diagnosis and revealed that it was treatable but not curable. In August 2024, Goddard spoke about her diagnosis.

<text>Merchant Taylors&#x27; Boys&#x27; School, Crosby is a 7–18 boys private day school, located in Great Crosby on Merseyside. The school&#x27;s motto is that of the Worshipful Company of Merchant Taylors: &quot;Concordia Parvae Res Crescunt&quot; (Small Things Grow in Harmony).

&quot;From September 2025, Merchant Taylors’ Girls’ School will join Merchant Taylors’ Boys’ School to create a single, co-educational senior school. The newly created school will be known as Merchant Taylors’ School and will be co-educational for all pupils aged 4-18, creating one school, one community, with one vision.&quot;

==History==
===Establishment===
The school was founded in 1620 under the instruction of the estate of John Harrison, a citizen and Merchant Taylor of London, who was born in Great Crosby, and was run under the auspices of the Merchant Taylors&#x27; Company until 1910. In 1878, the school moved to its present site, some 1,000 yards from the previous, which now forms part of the Merchant Taylors&#x27; Girls&#x27; School, with whom the school shares a Governing Board and Bursar. 

The first schoolmaster was the Revd John Kidde, who was also at the time the ‘Minister of Crosby’ and a farmer of to support his family of eight children. Kidde was apparently sacked from the post in 1651 on the grounds of mismanagement, although it is thought he was forced out by Roman Catholic sympathizers on account of his Puritan/Presbyterian ways.

===Boarding school===

Until the 1970s, Merchant Taylors&#x27; was also a boarding school. It currently caters for over 700 day pupils between the ages of 11 and 18 (with an additional 120 in the Junior School). Lessons run Monday-Friday, 08:40-16:00 (A Saturday working day was abolished in 1981). As a result of these longer school days, holidays are frequently several weeks longer than local education authority dates.

The school is independently run, and, as such, charges tuition fees. Fees were partially subsidised by the Government under the Assisted Places Scheme until the closure of that scheme in 2001. The Schools now run their own means tested Assisted Places Scheme under which about 20% of pupils benefit from free, or reduced-fee places. The schools offer around £1 million a year in bursaries. About 17 per cent of pupils at the two senior schools receive assistance, worth up to 100 per cent of the £11,394 annual fees.

===Recent history===

In 2013, Merchant Taylors’ was Crosby’s best performing school with 98% of pupils at the boys’ school achieving five Cs or above in any subject at GCSE.

==Overview==
===Academic attainment===

Academically, the School sees around 60% of grades awarded at A* and A at GCSE and, consistently excellently at A-Level, where 80% and above of grades have been recorded at A*-B. 2012 saw record results at A Level, with the percentage of grades awarded at A* and A 62.3%.
The School also enters students for a range of other public examinations, including Extended Project Qualifications, which have been offered since 2011.

===Extracurricular activities===

The primary sports played by the school are rugby union, field hockey and cricket, however association football as well as samoan cricket have both recently been introduced as an &#x27;official&#x27; school sport and looks set to challenge the more established sports over the coming years. The school also has a boat house which is currently on loan to Southport Dragon Boat Club, in the nearby town of Southport for its rowing team. The rowing team compete in national races with a number of boys competing at national level every year. The rugby coaching staff includes former Scottish international Ian McKie, and included Mike Slemen, former England and British and Irish Lions international and England team selector until his death in 2020.

The school also has a Combined Cadet Force, run in conjunction with Merchant Taylors&#x27; Girls&#x27; School, headed by Contingent Commander, Major (CCF) Helen Irwin. Her predecessors include Lieutenant Colonel (CCF), Mike Slemen, Squadron Leader Mark Stanley RAFAC (formerly RAFVR(T)) and Lieutenant Colonel (CCF), Paul Irvine. The Army section of MTS CCF is badged as Duke of Lancaster&#x27;s Regiment (King&#x27;s Regiment until July 2006). In 2015, Merchant Taylors&#x27; CCF celebrated its centenary year. A new banner was presented in the nearby St. Faith&#x27;s Church, with The Duke of York in attendance. 

In December 2011, the £5.5m Ian Robinson Sports Centre was opened. Facilities include a climbing wall, fitness suite, sports hall and dance studio. The Sports Centre is named after ex Head of Rugby, Ian Robinson, who died on a school sports tour in Australia after a white water rafting accident in 2007.
Other facilities include a heated indoor swimming pool on site (which has been emptied and eventually closed permanently in 2020 due to leaking and other maintenance issues so substantial that the cost of rectifying same remains prohibitive), a language laboratory, extensive playing fields, fully equipped science laboratories, an art and design suite, cricket nets, a self-contained music block and a share of Northern Club&#x27;s facilities.

<doc id="767826" wikidata="Q1115055" url="?curid=767826" title="Strange Tales">
<text>Strange Tales is a Marvel Comics anthology series. The title was revived in different forms on multiple occasions. Doctor Strange and Nick Fury, Agent of S.H.I.E.L.D. made their debuts in &quot;Strange Tales&quot;. It was a showcase for the science fiction/suspense stories of artists Jack Kirby and Steve Ditko, and for the groundbreaking work of writer-artist Jim Steranko. Two previous, unrelated magazines also bore that title.

==Monsters and sorcerers==

The Marvel Comics series ran 168 issues, cover-dated June 1951 to May 1968. It began as a horror anthology from the company&#x27;s 1950s precursor, Atlas Comics. Initially modeled after the gory morality tales of the popular EC line of comics, &quot;Strange Tales&quot; became less outré with the 1954 establishment of the Comics Code, which prohibited graphic horror, as well as vampires, zombies and other classical monsters.

The comic changed again with the return of Jack Kirby, the artist who had co-created Captain America for the company, then worked elsewhere for 17 years. Starting with #68 (April 1959), &quot;Strange Tales&quot; was revamped to reflect the then-current trend of science fiction monsters. Virtually every issue would open with a Kirby monster story (generally inked by Christopher Rule initially, then later Dick Ayers), followed by one or two twist-ending thrillers or sci-fi tales drawn by Don Heck, Paul Reinman, or Joe Sinnott, all capped by an often-surreal, sometimes self-reflexive Stan Lee-Steve Ditko short.
Some characters introduced here in standalone, anthological stories were later retconned into Marvel Universe continuity. These include Ulysses Bloodstone in the story &quot;Grottu, King of the Insects!&quot; in issue #73 (Feb. 1960), the alien dragon Fin Fang Foom, who first appeared in #89 (Oct. 1961), and the extraterrestrial would-be world conquerors Gorgolla, introduced in #74 (April 1960), and Orrgo, introduced in #90 (Nov. 1961).

In &quot;Strange Tales&quot; #75 (June 1960), a huge robot called &quot;the Hulk&quot; appeared. It was actually armor worn by the character Albert Poole. In modern-day reprints the character&#x27;s name is changed to Grutan.

Prototypes of the Spider-Man supporting characters Aunt May and Uncle Ben appeared in a short story in &quot;Strange Tales&quot; #97 (June 1962).

The anthology switched to superheroes during the Silver Age of Comic Books, retaining the sci-fi, suspense and monsters as backup features for a time. &quot;Strange Tales&quot;&#x27; first superhero, in 12- to 14-page stories, was the Fantastic Four&#x27;s Human Torch, Johnny Storm, beginning in #101 (Oct. 1962). Here, Johnny still lived with his elder sister, Susan Storm, in fictional Glenview, Long Island, New York, where he continued to attend high school and, with youthful naivete, attempted to maintain his &quot;secret identity&quot; (later retconned to reveal that his friends and neighbors knew of his dual identity from Fantastic Four news reports, but simply played along). Supporting characters included Johnny&#x27;s girlfriend, Doris Evans. Ayers took over the penciling after 10 issues, later followed by original Golden Age Human Torch creator Carl Burgos and others, with Jerry Siegel scripting issues #112–113 (Sept.–Oct. 1963) under the pseudonym &quot;Joe Carter&quot;. The Fantastic Four made occasional cameo appearances, and the Thing became a co-star with #123 (Aug. 1964). &quot;Strange Tales Annual&quot; #2 (1963) featured the first team-up of Spider-Man and the Human Torch.

The title became a &quot;split book&quot; with the introduction of sorcerer Doctor Strange, by Lee and Ditko. This 9- to 10-page feature debuted in #110 (July 1963), and after an additional story and then skipping two issues returned permanently with #114. Ditko&#x27;s surreal mystical landscapes and increasingly head-trippy visuals helped make the feature a favorite of college students, according to Lee himself. Eventually, as co-plotter and later sole plotter, in the &quot;Marvel Method&quot;, Ditko would take Strange into more abstract realms. Adversaries for the new hero included Baron Mordo introduced in issue #111 (Aug. 1963) and Dormammu in issue #126 (Nov. 1964). Clea, who would become a longtime love interest for Doctor Strange, was also introduced in issue #126.

Lee and Ditko interacted less and less as each went their separate creative ways. The storyline culminated with the introduction of Eternity, the personification of the universe, in issue #138 (Oct. 1965). Issue #146 (July 1966) was Ditko&#x27;s final bow on the series. Bill Everett succeeded him through #152 (January 1967), followed by Marie Severin (self-inked for four issues before being inked by Herb Trimpe in some of his earliest Marvel work). Another cosmic entity, the Living Tribunal, was introduced during Severin&#x27;s run, in issue #157. Dan Adkins took over penciling duties from #161 (Oct. 1967) to the final issue, #168 (May 1968).

==Steranko and spies==
The Human Torch and Thing had already been replaced in #135 (Aug. 1965) by Nick Fury, a superspy in keeping with the concurrent James Bond/&quot;The Man from U.N.C.L.E.&quot; craze. The 12-page feature was initially by Lee and Kirby, with the latter supplying such enduring gadgets and hardware as the Helicarrier – an airborne aircraft carrier – as well as human-replicant LMDs (Life Model Decoys), and even automobile airbags. The terrorist organization HYDRA was introduced here as well.

The feature &quot;Nick Fury, Agent of S.H.I.E.L.D.&quot; soon became the province of writer-penciler-colorist Jim Steranko, who Les Daniels called &quot;Perhaps the most innovative new talent to emerge at Marvel during the late 1960s&quot;. Steranko introduced or popularized in comics such art movements of the day as psychedelia and op art, built on Kirby&#x27;s longstanding work in photomontage, and created comics&#x27; first four-page spread – again inspired by Kirby, who in the Golden Age had pioneered the first full-page and double-page spreads. He spun plots of intrigue, barely hidden sensuality, and hi-fi hipness – and supplying his own version of Bond girls, essentially, in skintight leather, pushing what was allowable under the Comics Code at the time.

&quot;Nick Fury, Agent of S.H.I.E.L.D.&quot; became the first &quot;Strange Tales&quot; feature to receive its own cover logo below the main title, beginning with #135; it skipped an issue before returning permanently with #137. &quot;Doctor Strange&quot; received its own cover logo, designed by Sol Brodsky, with &quot;Strange Tales&quot; #150 (Nov. 1966).

&quot;Strange Tales&quot; ended with #168 (May 1968). The following month, Doctor Strange&#x27;s adventures continued in the full-length &quot;Doctor Strange&quot; #169, with Nick Fury moving to the newly launched &quot;Nick Fury, Agent of S.H.I.E.L.D.&quot;

==1970s revival==
Five years later, &quot;Strange Tales&quot; resumed its old numbering with #169 (Sept. 1973), which introduced the supernatural feature Brother Voodoo by writer Len Wein and artist Gene Colan. This lasted only to issue #173 (April 1974), with Brother Voodoo continuing briefly in the black-and-white Marvel horror-comics magazine &quot;Tales of the Zombie&quot;. This was followed by two different creative teams producing three stories of &quot;The Golem&quot; in three issues (#174, 176, 177), with #175 being a reprint of a pre-Silver Age monster comic.

The next feature was writer-artist-colorist Jim Starlin&#x27;s take on Adam Warlock, picking up the character from the 1972–73 series &quot;Warlock&quot; (a.k.a. &quot;The Power of Warlock&quot;) and reviving him in &quot;Strange Tales&quot; #178 (Feb. 1975). This feature introduced the characters Gamora, Pip the Troll and The Magus, and helped establish the mythos Starlin would mine in his many &quot;Infinity&quot; sagas of the 1990s. After issue #181 (Aug. 1975), the story continued in &quot;Warlock&quot; #9 (Oct. 1975), picking up from the old series&#x27; numbering. &quot;Strange Tales&quot; soldiered on with Doctor Strange reprints through issue #188 (Nov. 1976).

==Cloak and Dagger==
After Doctor Strange&#x27;s second series was canceled in the 1980s, &quot;Strange Tales&quot; was relaunched as vol. 2, #1 (April 1987). A split book once again, it featured 11-page Doctor Strange and Cloak and Dagger stories, the latter continuing from &quot;Cloak and Dagger&quot; #11. This ended with issue #19 (Oct. 1988), after which new &quot;Doctor Strange&quot; and &quot;Cloak and Dagger&quot; series were launched.

==Volumes 3 and 4==
A one-shot Human Torch, Thing, and Doctor Strange story, by writer Kurt Busiek, with painted art by Ricardo Villagran, was released in squarebound bookshelf format in 1994. Another one-shot, the 52-page &quot;Strange Tales: Dark Corners&quot; in 1998 was an anthology featuring Morbius, Gargoyle, Cloak and Dagger, and Spider-Man. A &quot;Strange Tales&quot; miniseries featuring Man-Thing and Werewolf by Night was published in 1998 to tie up plotlines after their individual series had been canceled. Although four issues were solicited, only two issues of this volume saw print, and the conclusions of those storylines were never released.

==&quot;Strange Tales Marvel Knights and MAX&quot;==
In 2009 Marvel published a three-issue miniseries under the Marvel Knights imprint. It featured comics writers and artists who normally create comics outside the superhero genre, such as Stan Sakai, Jason, and Michael Kupperman, and later was collected as a trade paperback. A second three-issue volume was published under the title &quot;Strange Tales II&quot; in 2010. The first issue of this second volume was under the MAX imprint. It included work by Harvey Pekar, Dash Shaw, and Jhonen Vasquez.

<text>The Indiana Department of Natural Resources (DNR) is the agency of the U.S. state of Indiana. There are many divisions within the DNR and each has a specific role. The DNR is not only responsible for maintaining resource areas but also manages Indiana&#x27;s fish and wildlife, reclaims coal mine ground, manages forested areas, aids in the management of wildlife on private lands, enforces Indiana&#x27;s conservation laws, and many other duties not named here. According to the department&#x27;s website, their mission is &quot;to protect, enhance, preserve, and wisely use natural, cultural, and recreational resources for the benefit of Indiana&#x27;s citizens through professional leadership, management, and education&quot;.

== History ==

The Department of Natural Resources was created as part of the Natural Resources Act, passed by the Indiana General Assembly and signed into law by Governor Roger Branigin in 1965.

Four agencies were placed under the department&#x27;s umbrella:

* Department of Conservation (the forerunner to the Department of Natural Resources)
* Flood Control and Water Resources Commission
* State Soil and Water Conservation Committee
* Outdoor Recreation Council

In 1967, the Nature Preserves Act established the Division of Nature Preserves, also under the same departmental oversight. Since then, the department has been involved in numerous initiatives and legislative efforts, including the establishment of new state parks, new flood laws, hunter safety programs, forestry education, and the general rejuvenation of Indiana&#x27;s forestland. Today, the Department of Natural Resources claims that Indiana has 4.5 million acres (18,000 km2) of forestland, still far from the area&#x27;s original 23 million acres (93,000 km2), but an improvement from the two million acres (8,000 km2) that remained intact by 1900.

== Organization ==

At the top of the organization is the director (presently Dan Bortner), who reports directly to the Governor of Indiana. In addition to overseeing the department, the director also serves on an autonomous board known as the Natural Resources Commission, consisting of both government officials and citizen members, which meets at least four times annually to address issues pertaining to the department. The director also has an advisory council at his disposal.

Beneath the director, there are four deputy directors, each of whom is responsible for a team under which many of the department&#x27;s divisions are organized. Those teams and their divisions are as follows:

* Regulatory Management Team
** Water
** Reclamation
** Entomology &amp; Plant Pathology
** Historic Preservation &amp; Archaeology
** Oil and Gas
* Land Management Team
** State Parks &amp; Reservoirs
** Natural Preserves
** Land Acquisition
** Fish and Wildlife
** Outdoor Recreation
** Forestry
** Engineering
* Administrative Management Team
** Budget and Performance Management
** Accounting
** Human Resources
** MIS
** Purchasing
** Strategic Management &amp; Organizational Excellence
* Legal Team
** Office of Legal Counsel

In addition, there are five departments that do not fall under one of the four teams:

* Legislative Affairs
* Communications
* Indiana Department of Natural Resources Law Enforcement Division
* Natural Resources Foundation
* Indiana Heritage Trust

The agency&#x27;s official magazine is &quot;Outdoor Indiana.&quot;

<text>SV40 is an abbreviation for simian vacuolating virus 40 or simian virus 40, a polyomavirus that is found in both monkeys and humans. Like other polyomaviruses, SV40 is a DNA virus that is found to cause tumors in humans and animals, but most often persists as a latent infection. SV40 has been widely studied as a model eukaryotic virus, leading to many early discoveries in eukaryotic DNA replication and transcription.

Following contamination of polio vaccine batches in the 1950s and 1960s, SV40 came under suspicion as a possible cancer risk, but no subsequent increased cancer rate was observed, making such a risk unlikely. Nevertheless SV40 has become a &quot;cause célèbre&quot; for anti-vaccination activists, who have blamed it for multiple ills, including cancer and HIV/AIDS.

==Human disease==
The hypothesis that SV40 might cause cancer in humans was a particularly controversial area of research, fuelled by the historical contamination of some batches of polio vaccine with SV40 in the 1950s and 1960s. &quot;Persuasive evidence now indicates that SV40 is causing infections in humans today and represents an emerging pathogen.&quot; However &quot;It appears unlikely that SV40 infection alone is sufficient to cause human malignancy...&quot;

===p53 damage and carcinogenicity===
It has been suggested that SV40 may act as a co-carcinogen with crocidolite asbestos to cause mesothelioma.

===Polio vaccine contamination===
Some vaccines made in the US between 1955 and 1961 were found to be contaminated with SV40, from the growth medium and from the original seed strain. Population level studies did not show extensive evidence of increase in cancer incidence as a result of exposure, though SV40 has been extensively studied. A thirty-five year follow-up did not find excess numbers of cancers associated with SV40.

==Gene therapy==
Due to its high tissue tropism, biotechnology companies seek to utilize modified SV40 based vectors as a viral vector for gene therapy. In these helper dependent virus or packaging cell line assisted produced vectors the SV40 large T antigen and SV40 small T antigen are removed.

==Virology==

SV40 consists of an unenveloped icosahedral virion with a closed circular double-stranded DNA genome of 5.2 kb. Structurally, SV40 is composed of 72 pentamers of major capsid protein VP1, with each VP1 pentamers harboring one minor capsid protein, either VP2 or VP3. The virion undergoes receptor-mediated endocytosis after binding to the ganglioside GM1 on the cell membrane. Penetration into the cell is through a caveolin vesicle. The endosome carrying SV40 fuses with the ER membrane to deliver the virus into the lumen of the ER. Resident ER proteins induce structural changes to initiate a disassembly process of the VP1 capsid shell. SV40 then exploits components of Endoplasmic-reticulum-associated protein degradation machinery to penetrate the ER membrane and get extracted into the cytosol. A dynein motor complex adaptor, BICD2, disassembles the virion further, before components of the LINC complex target the virion to the nuclear membrane for subsequent entry. Inside the cell nucleus, the cellular RNA polymerase II acts to promote early gene expression. This results in an mRNA that is spliced into two segments. The small and large T antigens result from this. The large T antigen has two functions: 5% goes to the plasma cell membrane and 95% returns to the nucleus. Once in the nucleus the large T antigen binds three viral DNA sites, I, II and III. Binding of sites I and II autoregulates early RNA synthesis. Binding to site II takes place in each cell cycle. Binding site I initiates DNA replication at the origin of replication. Early transcription gives two spliced RNAs that are both 19s. Late transcription gives both a longer 16s, which synthesizes the major viral capsid protein VP1; and the smaller 19s, which gives VP2 and VP3 through leaky scanning. All of the proteins, besides the 5% of large T, return to the nucleus because assembly of the viral particle happens there. A putative late protein VP4 has been reported to act as a viroporin facilitiating release of viral particles and resulting in cytolysis; however the presence and role of VP4 have been disputed.

==Multiplicity reactivation==
SV40 is capable of multiplicity reactivation (MR). MR is the process by which two or more virus genomes containing otherwise lethal damage interact within an infected cell to form a viable virus genome. Yamamato and Shimojo observed MR when SV40 virions were irradiated with UV light and allowed to undergo multiple infection of host cells. Hall studied MR when SV 40 virions were exposed to the DNA crosslinking agent 4, 5&#x27;, 8-trimethylpsoralen. Under conditions in which only a single virus particle entered each host cell, approximately one DNA cross-link was lethal to the virus and could not be repaired. In contrast, when multiple viral genomes infected a host cell, psoralen-induced DNA cross-links were repaired; that is, MR occurred. Hall suggested that the virions with cross-linked DNA were repaired by recombinational repair. Michod et al. reviewed numerous examples of MR in different viruses and suggested that MR is a common form of sexual interaction that provides the advantage of recombinational repair of genome damages.

==Transcription==
The early promoter for SV40 contains three elements. The TATA box is located approximately 20 base-pairs upstream from the transcriptional start site. The 21 base-pair repeats contain six GC boxes and are the site that determines the direction of transcription. Also, the 72 base-pair repeats are transcriptional enhancers. When the SP1 protein interacts with the 21 base-pair repeats, it binds either the first or the last three GC boxes. Binding the first three initiates early expression, binding the last three initiates late expression. The function of the 72 base-pair repeats is to enhance the amount of stable RNA and increase the rate of synthesis. This is done by binding (dimerization) with the AP-1 transcription factor to give a primary transcript that is 3&#x27; polyadenylated and 5&#x27; capped.

==Other animals==
SV40 is dormant and is asymptomatic in rhesus monkeys. The virus has been found in many macaque populations in the wild, where it rarely causes disease. However, in monkeys that are immunodeficient—due to, for example, infection with &quot;simian immunodeficiency virus&quot;—SV40 acts much like the human JC and BK polyomaviruses, producing kidney disease and sometimes a demyelinating disease similar to progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy. In other species, particularly hamsters, SV40 causes a variety of tumors, generally sarcomas. In rats, the oncogenic SV40 large T antigen was used to establish a brain tumor model for primitive neuroectodermal tumor and medulloblastoma.

The molecular mechanisms by which the virus reproduces and alters cell function were previously unknown, and research into SV40 vastly increased biologists&#x27; understanding of gene expression and the regulation of cell growth.

==History==
SV40 was first identified by Ben Sweet and Maurice Hilleman in 1960 when they found that between 10 and 30% of polio vaccines in the US were contaminated with SV40. In 1962, Bernice Eddy described the SV40 oncogenic function inducing sarcoma and ependymomas in hamsters inoculated with monkeys cells infected with SV40. The complete viral genome was sequenced by Weissman at Yale University (US) in 1978 and also by Fiers and his team at the University of Ghent (Belgium).

== Culture and society ==
SV40 has become a totemic subject among anti-vaccination activists, where its presence in contaminated vaccine is accused of being a cause of a cancer &quot;epidemic&quot; and of being responsible for HIV/AIDS.
