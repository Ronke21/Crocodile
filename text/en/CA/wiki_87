<text>Errol Thompson (29 December 1948 – 13 November 2004), better known as &quot;ET&quot;, was a Jamaican record producer, audio engineer, and one of the first studio engineers to be involved in dub music.

==Career==
Thompson gained studio experience at Studio One, working alongside Joe Gibbs. He went on to work for Bunny Lee and in the 1970s he worked (along with Niney) as an engineer at Randy&#x27;s Studio 17, in Kingston, Jamaica. Thompson engineered the first instrumental reggae album, &quot;The Undertaker&quot; by Derrick Harriott And The , released in 1970.

He went on to work with Joe Gibbs from 1975. Gibbs and Thompson were known collectively as the Mighty Two. Together they produced music by Junior Byles, Dennis Brown, Gregory Isaacs, Althea and Donna, Prince Far I and Eek-A-Mouse, before their partnership ended in 1983 when Gibbs relocated to Miami.

Thompson also engineered tracks by Bob Marley, The Abyssinians, Augustus Pablo, Big Youth, Culture, Yellowman, Frankie Paul and Burning Spear. In addition, he produced work by I-Roy, Cornell Campbell, Freddie McGregor, and Barrington Levy. Thompson also worked with producer, Clive Chin. His final project, the &quot;Hard Times Riddim&quot;, co-produced with Stephen Gibson, son of partner Joe Gibbs, was instrumental in creating a resurgence in dancehall. The album included many key reggae performers of the time including, Capleton, I Wayne, Richie Spice, Chuck Fenda, and Luciano.

Later in life, he moved away from the music industry and managed a supermarket in North Parade, downtown Kingston. Thompson died, after numerous strokes, on 13 November 2004, at the age of 55.

<doc id="787419" wikidata="Q5326801" url="?curid=787419" title="Early entrance to college">
<text>Early entrance to college, sometimes called early admission or early enrollment, is the practice of allowing students to be accelerated into college, one or more years before the traditional age of college entrance, and without obtaining a high school diploma. In some cases this is done individually. Often, however, it is done as part of a cohort acceleration program, in which many such students are accelerated into college together at the same time. These programs are usually targeted to gifted students, and may provide the students with a social support network and help in dealing with the adjustment.

By placing students into full-time college studies, early entrance differs from dual enrollment, early college high school, Advanced Placement, International Baccalaureate, and Advanced International Certificate of Education programs, which are alternative methods of earned college credits (or their equivalent) while in high school.

Early entrance programs take a number of forms. Some, like the Advanced Academy of Georgia and The Clarkson School, are special programs within larger colleges. The University of Washington&#x27;s Transition School and Early Entrance Program, started in 1977, allows a small group of academically advanced students each year to, instead of attending high school, they attend a one-year college preparatory program following enrollment as matriculated freshmen at the University. In other programs, like the early entrance program at Shimer College, the Program for the Exceptionally Gifted at Mary Baldwin University, and the Early Entrance Program at CSULA, early entrants study side-by-side with traditional college students. Bard College at Simon&#x27;s Rock is the only four-year college designed exclusively for younger students. Also, some colleges do allow some younger people who have early enrollment to take classes and be a part of the college community.

==History==

===Context===

Prior to the 20th century, entrance to most American colleges was by examination or by a preparatory course prescribed specifically for that college. Students who could demonstrate their readiness for higher education were able to enter at whatever age was appropriate. Many colleges routinely admitted students as young as fourteen. Some students entered college entirely self-taught, or after having received only informal tutoring.

In the late 19th century, as the subject matter of higher education became more diverse, pressure grew to standardize both higher education in general and the transition between secondary and higher education in particular. The first school to make the high school diploma a necessary and sufficient condition of admission was the University of Michigan in 1870; as high school education was standardized through accreditation bodies beginning in the 1880s, more colleges and universities followed Michigan&#x27;s lead.

In the first decade of the 20th century, the Carnegie Foundation adopted the &quot;count&quot; system that the North Central Association had devised in 1902 to compare different secondary and tertiary curricula. 15 or 16 Carnegie units (corresponding to four years of high school) became a standard requirement for entry into American colleges and universities, and a high school diploma soon became the &quot;sine qua non&quot; for college entrance&quot;. Although many students did reach college before their 18th birthday, they could do so only if their high school accelerated them to early graduation.

===First organized ventures===

Pushback against the artificial constraints imposed by the &quot;Carnegie unit&quot; system began in the early 1930s. Little Rock Junior College in Arkansas conducted an experimental program in 1933 and 1934, admitting students in the top 25% academically as freshmen after their junior year of high school. Another early innovator was the University of Louisville, which in 1934 also began admitting promising high school students after their junior year. These early programs all produced highly positive academic outcomes, but were not emulated elsewhere. Although the Louisville program was still active in the 1950s, the university only admits high school students on a concurrent enrollment basis.

A more radical approach was adopted by Robert Maynard Hutchins for the College of the University of Chicago. Beginning in 1937, the University of Chicago&#x27;s experimental, interdisciplinary College program admitted students beginning in the sophomore year of high school. Because there were few formal requirements, early entrants in this program were largely self-selecting, and came mostly from nearby schools such as the University High School. Early entrants were subject to five additional comprehensive examinations, but otherwise went through the same academic program as high school graduates. Although the University of Chicago eventually abandoned this program, it was adopted by tiny Shimer College in 1950, and continues there in a modified form to the present day.

During World War II, the government made academic acceleration a high priority, particularly in high school, in order to ensure recruits were as highly educated as possible. In 1942, the Educational Policies Commission made a formal recommendation that colleges admit academically skilled high school students after their junior year. Schools including the University of Illinois and Ohio State University adopted wartime early entrance policies. The programs adopted in this period, however, faced stiff opposition from high schools, and did not outlast the war.

===The Early Admission Program===

Robert Maynard Hutchins, who established the pioneering program at the University of Chicago, subsequently became head of the Ford Foundation in 1951. In this position, Hutchins established the Fund for the Advancement of Education, which provided a several-year grant for scholarship funding in the 1950s to support small early entrance programs at a wide spectrum of colleges and universities. Part of a suite of five programs addressing the transition between high school and college, the Early Admission Program drew impetus from the military&#x27;s need for optimally trained recruits during the Korean War.

Although originally intended to involve only four large universities, the &quot;Early Admission Program&quot; ultimately encompassed twelve schools: Yale, Columbia, Wisconsin, Utah, Chicago, Louisville, Fisk, Goucher, Lafayette, Morehouse, Oberlin, and Shimer. Each school chose its own entrance requirements, with most opting to be highly selective. Shimer was unique in following the original Hutchins model and opening the program to all ability levels, although this approach was modified after the initial experiment.

National in scope and involving grants totaling US$3.4 million, the Early Admission Program targeted high school students who &quot;seemed ready, both academically and in personal maturity, to undertake college work.&quot; The Fund commissioned two independent studies on the outcomes of the program, one approaching it from a psychological point of view and one from the perspective of educational attainment. Both studies reported strongly positive outcomes.

After the money from the Fund&#x27;s grant ran out in the mid-1950s, many of the participating schools discarded the program. Among the first to do so was the University of Chicago, which in 1953 terminated the early entrance program it had been operating since the 1930s. Other schools, intrigued by the strong results, established experimental programs of their own; in 1956, 29 member schools of the College Board were operating early entrance programs, of which only 6 had been part of the Early Admission Program. But in the absence of strong institutional support, and facing resistance and skepticism from both high schools and universities, these programs subsequently died away. The early entrance programs at three of the original participating schools, however, continue to the present day: Shimer College, Goucher College, and the University of Utah.

===Subsequent programs===

In the 1960s, social pressure in favor of egalitarianism restrained any further large-scale efforts on gifted education, of which early entrance was considered a part. However, programs continued at a few of the EAP colleges.

In 1966, Simon&#x27;s Rock opened as the only college in the United States with a student body consisting entirely of early entrants. Simon&#x27;s Rock was founded by Elizabeth Blodgett Hall, formerly the headmistress of Concord Academy, who wanted to create &quot;an institution that would provide learning for students who had begun to think independently.&quot;

In 1971, Julian Stanley at Johns Hopkins University reignited interest in early entrance and in gifted education generally with his Study of Mathematically Precocious Youth, in which he worked one-on-one with students entering Johns Hopkins as young as 13.

Following the Johns Hopkins example, in 1977 the University of Washington (UW) inaugurated the first structured early entrance program for students younger than 15. The UW program, known as the Transition School and Early Entrance Program, has provided a model for many subsequent early entrance programs targeting highly gifted students. Such programs include the all-girl Program for the Exceptionally Gifted established at Mary Baldwin University (formerly Mary Baldwin College) in 1985, allowing students to enroll as early as their seventh-grade year, as well as the Early Entrance Program at California State University, Los Angeles.

In 1978, the University of Science and Technology of China (USTC) started the first early entrance program in the People&#x27;s Republic of China. As a result of this program&#x27;s success, it was subsequently replicated at 12 additional universities in China.

<doc id="787424" wikidata="Q3443889" url="?curid=787424" title="Ontario Highway 3">
<text>King&#x27;s Highway 3, commonly referred to as Highway 3, is a provincially maintained highway in the Canadian province of Ontario which travels parallel to the northern shoreline of Lake Erie. It has three segments, the first of which travels from the Ambassador Bridge in Windsor to Highway 77 in Leamington. The second portion begins at Talbotville Royal outside of St. Thomas at Highway 4, and travels to the western city limits of Port Colborne. The road is regionally maintained within Port Colborne as Niagara Regional Road 3, but regains its provincial designation at Highway 140. Its third and final terminus is at Edgewood Park, within the Fort Erie town limits. From there, the road continues as Niagara Regional Road 3 to the Peace Bridge, where drivers can cross to the United States. The total length of Highway 3 is , consisting of from Windsor to Leamington, from Talbotville Royal to Port Colborne and from Port Colborne to Edgewood Park.

Until the late 1990s, Highway 3 formed a single continuous route from the Ambassador Bridge to near the Peace Bridge, but since then has had significant portion transferred to regional and county governments. A large segment of the route follows the historic Talbot Trail, a settlement road following the northern shore of Lake Erie constructed by Colonel Talbot in the early 1800s as part of a grand settlement plan along the lake front. East of Canborough, the road generally follows older settlement trails: Forks Road, connecting Dunnville with Wainfleet, portions of Sherk&#x27;s Road, through Port Colborne to Gasline, and the Garrison Road, a military road built west from Fort Erie. The highway was initially designated in 1920, but not numbered until five years later. It originally connected to Niagara Falls, but was rerouted to Fort Erie following completion of the Peace Bridge in the late 1920s. Although a few portions of Highway 3 were upgraded in the years since, the highway generally follows the same route as it did in 1930. However, in 1997, segments through Port Colborne and Fort Erie were decommissioned as a provincial highway, followed by a segment of the route from Leamington to Talbotville Royal in 1998. All three now exist as county/regional roads. In Windsor, Highway 401 had terminated at a split interchange with Highway 3 where the freeway defaulted into Talbot Road, from 2011 to 2015 this segment of Highway 3 (Talbot Road and Huron Church Road) was realigned to accommodate the construction of the Highway 401 extension (also known as the Rt. Hon. Herb Gray Parkway, formerly &quot;Windsor-Essex Parkway&quot;).

== Route description ==
Highway 3 follows the route of the historic Talbot Trail for most of its length. Abutting the northern shore of Lake Erie between Windsor and Fort Erie, the route deviates in places to bypass towns and to avoid the less than direct trail laid nearly two centuries ago. Prior to 1998, the highway spanned this entire distance, but has since then been divided into three discontinuous sections. The western section travels from Windsor to Leamington. From there, a gap separates the western and central sections. Highway 3 resumes near St. Thomas at the southern end of Highway 4 and travels east to Port Colborne. The central and eastern sections are divided by a Connecting Link through Port Colborne. The eastern section begins at Highway 140 and travels to Fort Erie. It ends at Rosehill Road, a short distance west of the Peace Bridge crossing into New York.

=== Western segment ===
The western segment of Highway 3 begins at the Ambassador Bridge, which connects Canada with the U.S. state of Michigan over the Detroit River. The five lane highway travels southeast through Windsor along Huron Church Road, surrounded by residential subdivisions, then curves east along Talbot Road. The section through Windsor to Cabana Road is maintained under a Connecting Link agreement. Between the E. C. Row Expressway and Howard Ave, Highway 3 runs adjacent to the Rt. Hon. Herb Gray Parkway portion of Highway 401. At Essex County Road 11, Highway 3 enters rural southwestern Ontario, and is dominated by farmland for much of its length through Essex County. The now four-laned route becomes divided as it follows the Essex Bypass around the southern edge of Essex, with commercial services lining the highway, primarily on the north side. Returning to farmland and narrowing to a two lane undivided road, the highway continues southeast, passing nearby, but avoiding, several small communities that the original highway travelled through. After passing Essex County Road 18, the route curves eastward, passing north of Kingsville before entering Leamington along its northern fringe. The western section ends at the southern terminus of Highway 77, where the provincially built but county maintained Leamington Bypass continues east to meet the Talbot Road just east of the town.

=== Central segment ===

The central segment is the longest of the three, at . It begins at the southern terminus of Highway 4 at Talbotville Royal in Elgin County, just northwest of St. Thomas and south of London. The route travels east into St. Thomas, becoming a two-laned expressway aptly named the St. Thomas Expressway. This expressway begins at Wellington Road (Elgin County Road 25/26) and travels through St. Thomas to Centennial Road, featuring a single interchange. However, the right-of-way is wide enough to accommodate any future upgrade to a divided expressway. At the eastern end, Highway 3 turns south onto Centennial Road and then east onto Talbot Line, following the historic Talbot Trail to east of Aylmer. This mostly straight and rural portion passes through several small villages before the Talbot Trail splits from it to follow Elgin/Norfolk County Road 38 through Straffordville. Highway 3 meanwhile curves northeast and passes through Tillsonburg, encountering Highway 19. It then curves east and travels parallel to the St. Thomas and Eastern Railway to Courtland, remerging with the Talbot Trail and snaking towards Delhi, now within Norfolk County.

At Delhi, Highway 3 turns south for before returning to its eastward orientation. It continues through farmland to the town of Simcoe, where it meets Highway 24. From Simcoe to Canborough, the highway is nearly straight as an arrow, with an occasional jog to the northeast. It enters Haldimand County and intersects Highway 6 in Jarvis. At Cayuga it crosses the Grand River; until 2014, a five-span steel girder bridge crossed the river, but it has since been replaced by a concrete structure. At Canborough, the historic Talbot Trail ends and Highway 3 veers south to Dunnville, briefly travelling along the northern bank of the Grand River and gradually curving back eastward. East of Dunnville, the route follows Forks Road into Wainfleet and the Niagara Region. At Chambers Corners it turns south and passes through Wainfleet village, crossing the old Feeder Canal which once supplied the Welland Canal with water from the Grand River. Just north of Lake Erie, Highway 3 turns east and travels straight towards Port Colborne, passing just south of the Wainfleet Bog. At Townline Road, the boundary between Wainfleet and Port Colborne, the central section ends and the roadway continues as Niagara Regional Road 3 through the city, meeting the southern end of Highway 58.
Portions of the central segment of Highway 3 through several towns are maintained under Connecting Link agreements, including within Aylmer, Delhi, Simcoe, Cayuga and Dunnville. The combined length of these segments is .

=== Eastern segment ===
The final and shortest section of Highway 3 begins at Highway 140 on the eastern fringe of Port Colborne and lies entirely within Niagara Region. The segment travels several kilometres inland to Lake Erie, as well as parallel to it. From there it mostly travels along a straight line eastward through generally rural areas. The notable exception is the village of Gasline, where the Niagara Speedway stands on the northern side of the highway. At the Fort Erie boundary, the route widens to four lanes and jogs northeast to align with the old Garrison Road. As the highway progresses eastward into the town, the surroundings gradually become more urbanized before it ends at Rosehill Road. The roadway continues east through Fort Erie to the foot of the Peace Bridge as Niagara Regional Road 3, connecting with the Queen Elizabeth Way to provide access to the United States.

=== Connections with the United States ===
Highway 3 was the only Ontario provincial highway to both start and end at international crossings with the United States (the Ambassador Bridge leading into Detroit, Michigan and the Peace Bridge leading into Buffalo, New York, respectively). From Chicago, Toledo, and Detroit to Buffalo and Western New York, Highway 3 was shorter and more direct than any American route (including Interstate 90), because the Lake Erie shoreline dips south along Ohio, Pennsylvania, and New York. After the 1954 New York State Thruway opened from Buffalo to New York City, Michigan officials had encouraged Ontario to replace Highway 3 with a toll road connecting Detroit to Buffalo.

When the Michigan Department of Transportation discontinued US 25 in 1973, much of it through Detroit was redesignated as M-3, whose southern terminus came at Clark Street in Detroit, at the junction of I-75 by the Ambassador Bridge. This provided a connection between Michigan&#x27;s M-3 and Ontario&#x27;s Highway 3 until 2001, when jurisdictional changes within downtown Detroit created a discontinuous segment of M-3, and this international Route 3 connection was lost when the portion of M-3 along Fort Street was redesignated M-85.

Highway 3 has been largely replaced as a Detroit–Buffalo truck route by portions of Highway 401, Highway 403 and the Queen Elizabeth Way. Although Highway 3 is a shorter distance between Detroit and Buffalo than the aforementioned 400-series highways, plus Highway 3 does not have to climb the Niagara Escarpment unlike parallel portions of Highway 403 (the Chedoke Expressway section) and the QEW, there has been traffic preference for these higher-speed 400-series highways which are also routed through major cities (London, Hamilton, St. Catharines) and which have in turn received more upgrades and extensions. During this time the only upgrades to Highway 3 were the Essex Bypass and St. Thomas Expressway, as the rest of the route remained a two-lane road passing through small communities. The last section of Highway 403 between Brantford and Ancaster opened in August 1997, making for a continuous express route between Windsor and Fort Erie, replacing Highway 2 which had been the previous link from Highway 401 to the Ancaster-Hamilton segment of Highway 403. This left a local section of Highway 3 on Windsor surface streets as a bottleneck, however this will be bypassed by the Highway 401 extension (Windsor–Essex Parkway) to the Gordie Howe International Bridge to Detroit in 2025.

== History ==

=== Talbot Trail ===
The history of Highway 3 dates back over 200 years to the pioneering settlement era of Upper Canada following the American Revolution and the resulting influx of United Empire Loyalists. Thomas Talbot, an influential scion who joined the British army at the age of 11, would challenge the government, the terrain, and the forces of nature to see to it that his road be built. Due to his family legacy, Talbot worked through the ranks quickly and found himself a personal aide to John Graves Simcoe, the first Lieutenant Governor of Upper Canada. He returned to England after Simcoe fell ill, but vowed to return to the hinterland he had come to love.
After completing his military commission, Talbot returned to Upper Canada in 1801 at the age of 30. Although Simcoe had promised Talbot of land in Yarmouth Township on the shoreline of Lake Erie, he had not made it official. Talbot returned to England in 1802 and spoke to the legislature, promoting his concept of a vibrant farming settlement. The government granted Talbot his land and promised an additional for each family that settled a lot in the original grant. Talbot returned to Upper Canada in 1803 with four families and a letter from Lord Hobart authorizing his grant, and established what is now the town of Port Stanley. Wishing to expand his grant and create his ideal colony, Talbot sought out new settlers; a road was required.

Talbot received a grant of $250 in September 1804 for the construction of a road between Brantford and Delhi. John Bostwick would survey the route that year; however, funding shortages would halt construction in 1806.
Talbot approached the new Lieutenant Governor – Francis Gore – in 1808 with the intent of persuading him to fund the building of the road. He insisted that a road would increase the value of the land in the surrounding townships, as well as providing a greater incentive for newcomers to settle in what was otherwise a desolate wilderness. Gore instructed deputy surveyor Mahlon Burwell to &quot;Build a road one chain wide, laid out on the principle of Yonge Street with lots on each side.&quot; Burwell began this work in 1809 westward from Delhi. In 1811, he was tasked with surveying the West Talbot Road from Talbotville Royale to Amherstburg. By then, a road was already opened between Port Talbot and Talbotville Royale.

Construction of the new road proved far more difficult than first imagined. Workers followed an old Native American trail, wholly consumed by nature, between Delhi and Port Talbot. To get across the numerous swamps, felled trees were laid across the path to create a corduroy road, much to the chagrin of settlers. The outbreak of the War of 1812 would temporarily halt further construction. When it resumed in 1816, Talbot himself began directing the surveyor, ordering that the road remain on the highest ground possible. This led to an irregular and winding route between Aylmer and Delhi. By 1830, the corduroy logs had been removed and the road improved and extended from Amherstburg to Canborough.

=== Niagara trails ===
East of Canborough, Highway 3 follows several early settlement trails: Forks Road between Dunnville and Chambers Corners, Sherk&#x27;s Road through Port Colborne to Gasline, and the military Garrison Road through Fort Erie. These roads predate the land survey grid of concession roads and sidelines, which would be used by the provincial government to make Highway 3 a continuous route through the Niagara Peninsula where none previously existed.

Forks Road, a river road following Forks Creek, served to connect the Grand River at Dunnville with the Welland River west of Welland. Like many early roads in Upper Canada, it was built along a river bank. It can therefore be assumed that this trail was built prior to the completion of the Feeder Canal in 1832.
Sherk&#x27;s Road was built at the request of Elias Sherk (d. 1893) in 1858 to connect his house (the historic Danner House) with his and Michael Gondor&#x27;s properties. The irregular road connected the Welland Canal at Humberstone (now Port Colborne) to the community of Ridgeway, where it met the west end of the Garrison Road. That road was built due to the threat of American attack to provide quick access from Fort Erie, and, like other military roads in Upper Canada (e.g. Dundas Street or Yonge Street), it travelled in a straight line, in this case parallel to the Lake Erie shoreline.

=== Provincial Highway Network ===
Until 1918, the majority of the primary roads through southern Ontario formed part of the County Road System. The Department of Public Works and Highways paid up to 60% of the construction and maintenance costs for these roads, while the counties were responsible for the remaining 40%. In 1919, the federal government passed the Canada Highways Act, which provided $20,000,000 to provinces under the condition that they establish an official highway network; up to 40% of construction costs would be subsidized. The first network plan was approved on February 26, 1920, and included the Talbot Road. The majority of what would soon become Highway 3 was designated several months later in August. However, it would not receive a route number until the summer of 1925.

Four significant changes to Highway 3 have taken place since the designation of the route in 1920. The first was an adjustment to the eastern terminus. The second was the Essex Bypass, built through the 1970s between Windsor and Leamington. The third was the St. Thomas Expressway, a super two highway built in the late 1970s. The final change was the provincial highway transfers conducted in 1997 and 1998 that resulted in three segments of Highway 3 being decommissioned: between Leamington and Talbotville Royale, through Port Colborne and within Fort Erie.

Highway 3 originally ended at the Honeymoon Bridge in Niagara Falls; it continued east of Chambers Corners along Forks Road (Regional Road 23) rather than south through Wainfleet as it does today. It then travelled north through Welland and east along Lundys Lane. Highway 58 and Highway 20 would later follow portions of this route. As part of the &quot;spirit of cooperation&quot; that inundated Canada and the US following World War I, as well as to celebrate a century of peace, a new bridge was planned between Fort Erie and Buffalo alongside the international railway crossing. Construction began in 1925; the completed bridge opened to traffic on June 1, 1927. Two months later, on August 7, the bridge was formally dedicated as the &quot;Peace Bridge&quot; by US Vice President Charles Dawes, and Edward, Prince of Wales.

Traffic patterns quickly shifted to take advantage of the new crossing and the bypass of Niagara Falls that it provided. In foresight of this, the Department of Public Highways took control of a Welland County road between Chambers Corners and Fort Erie on May 11, 1927. This roadway, which followed a significant portion of Sherk&#x27;s Road and the Garrison Road, in addition to a concession road built west from Port Colborne and north through Wainfleet village, was designated as Highway 3A. The following year it was surfaced with concrete and a new bridge built over the Welland Canal in Port Colborne. The new route became so popular that in 1929 the Highway 3 and Highway 3A designations were swapped.

In the early 1970s, as part of a review to determine the future route of Highway 406 south of Welland, proposals arose for a bypass of Highway 3 from east of Dunnville to Port Colborne near Highway 58.

=== Essex Bypass ===

The Essex Bypass was opened in stages in the 1970s and early 1980s. Plans were completed in 1968 as part of a province-wide program to bypass small towns on busy provincial highways. The first stage, opened by 1972, began west of Maidstone and passed south of Essex, where it then routed along Malden Road to its former alignment (now Essex County Road 34). Construction of an eastward extension to Ruthven was underway by 1982, and completed in 1983, with the road following Union Road to the old alignment. Construction of a final extension, from Union Road north of Ruthven to past Highway 77 on the northern fringe of Leamington, was underway in late 1998; it opened in early December 1999. Although the Leamington Bypass was constructed by the Ministry of Transportation (MTO), the segment east of Highway 77 to County Road 34 (Talbot Road) was never a part of Highway 3 or the provincial highway network. It is signed as Essex County Road 33, as Leamington is planning to link the discontinuous segments of County Road 33 with the East Side Arterial Road.

The Essex Bypass, completed around the village of Essex in 1972, was designed to accommodate future widening to a divided four lane road when traffic volumes warranted. By the mid-1990s, a regular pattern of fatalities were occurring, prompting local politicians and Essex Member of Provincial Parliament (MPP) Bruce Crozier to lobby the MTO widen the route. It was announced in June 2006 that the entire bypass would be widened to four lanes with a grassy median separating the opposing flows of traffic. The three phase project began in September 2007 with a stretch between Maidstone and County Road 8 west of Essex. The four-laned highway opened in June 2009 at a cost of C$20.7 million. The C$22.1 million second phase involved widening the highway between Walker Road and Maidstone to a five lane cross-section, and began in mid-November 2009. It was completed in early 2012. Despite concerns raised by Crozier in 2006 that the project would be halted after the first phase, which were dismissed at the time, no further work has actually been completed on the Essex Bypass since 2012, and the section between Essex and Ruthven remains a two lane highway. It is still considered as a future project by the MTO, with no time line set. Three months after Crozier&#x27;s unexpected death on June 3, 2011, the entire Essex Bypass was renamed the Bruce Crozier Way in honour of his commitment to the widening of the highway.

On August 12, 2019, the MTO announced its intention to expand Highway 3 within Essex County by twinning the existing two-lane highway with a second carriageway.
Early construction work was underway as of March 2021 to twin approximately of Highway 3 around the town of Essex, including interchange improvements at Essex County Road 8 (Maidstone Avenue), and a grade-separation at North Malden Road/Victoria Avenue which involved replacing the signalized intersection with an underpass.
Further expansion from east of Essex to Leamington is currently under detailed design and engineering. On June 2, 2023, construction started to twin of the Essex Bypass, from east of Essex Road 23 (Arner Townline) easterly to east of Essex Road 34 (Union Avenue).

=== St. Thomas Expressway ===

The St. Thomas expressway was built along the northern edge of that city beginning in 1974. It features six overpasses and a single interchange, at First Avenue. A ribbon cutting ceremony was held on September 7, 1981 to officially open the new route, which bypassed the former Highway 3 alignment along Talbot Street and the short concurrency with Highway 4 (Sunset Drive). The bypass cost C$16.5 million to construct, and features a two-lane roadway with allotted space on the north side for a second two-lane roadway. Plans originally called for the expressway to extend further east to New Sarum and later even as far as Aylmer, but these have never materialized.

=== Downloads to municipalities ===

Aside from the Essex Bypass and St. Thomas Expressway, Highway 3 remained generally unchanged between the 1930s and late 1990s. However, budget constraints brought on by a recession in the 1990s resulted in the Mike Harris provincial government forming the &quot;Who Does What?&quot; committee to determine cost-cutting measures in order to balance the budget after a deficit incurred by former premier Bob Rae. It was determined that many Ontario highways no longer served long-distance traffic movement and should therefore be maintained by local or regional levels of government. The MTO consequently transferred many highways to lower levels of government in 1997 and 1998, removing a significant percentage of the provincial highway network.

Highway 3 served as one of the principal highways through southwestern Ontario, since this Detroit–Buffalo route is more direct with a shorter distance than using the below-mentioned 400-series highways, and furthermore Highway 3 does not have to climb the Niagara Escarpment unlike parallel portions of Highway 403 (the Chedoke Expressway section) and the QEW. Nonetheless, due to traffic preference for higher-speed freeways which have in turn received more upgrades and extensions, Highway 3 had been largely supplanted by the combination of Highway 401 (segments which have been widened since the 1990s), Highway 403 (particularly the completion of the Woodstock-Brantford-Ancaster sections in 1997 which makes for a continuous express link), and the QEW as a through-route. As a result, portions of Highway 3 through the Regional Municipality of Niagara were transferred to the region on April 1, 1997, including a segment through Port Colborne (most of which had existed as a Connecting Link) and a segment in Fort Erie. To the west, a segment of the route paralleling Highway 401 between Leamington and Talbotville Royal was decommissioned on January 1, 1998 and transferred to Essex County, Chatham–Kent and Elgin County. It has since been designated as Essex County Road 34, Chatham–Kent Road 3 and Elgin County Road 3.

In 2001, the MTO considered renumbering the western segment of Highway 3 as Highway 103 to avoid confusion. However, this never came to pass due to opposition from Windsor city councillors.

=== Windsor–Essex Parkway ===

Highway401 did not originally have direct access to the Canada–United States border, as upon entering the Windsor city limits the route terminated at a split interchange with Highway3 where the freeway defaulted onto Talbot Road. Traffic continuing to the border had to follow the non-express Highway3 routing along Talbot Road and Huron Church Road which had a dozen traffic lights. The approach to the Ambassador Bridge was heavily built up making it impractical to twin this crossing and reconstruct the approach as a freeway to cope with cross-border traffic growth, even though Ambassador Bridge owner Matty Moroun had long lobbied for this solution, making this the focus of controversy since the mid-1990s and early 2000s. Numerous attempts by local and provincial politicians since then have led the MTO to begin remedying the situation by constructing an extension of Highway 401 (initially known as the &quot;Windsor–Essex Parkway&quot;, eventually designated as the &quot;Rt. Hon. Herb Gray Parkway&quot;) to a new international crossing.

In 2004, a joint announcement by the federal government of the United States and Government of Canada confirmed that a new border crossing would be constructed between Detroit and Windsor. The Detroit River International Crossing (DRIC) was formed as a bi-national committee to manage the project. The MTO took advantage of this opportunity to extend Highway 401 to the international border and began an environmental assessment on the entire project in late 2005.

Initial construction of a noise barrier from North Talbot Road to Howard Avenue began in March 2010. Full construction began on August 19, 2011, with an expected completion date of mid-2015 for the first phase and 2015-16 for the remainder of the parkway. In early 2015, it was announced that the parkway would open to traffic between Highway 3 and Labelle Street (near the E.C. Row Expressway) in the spring. The existing segment of Highway 3 (Talbot Road and Huron Church Road) from the E. C. Row Expressway to just east of Outer Drive was realigned to free up right-of-way for the Highway 401 extension which was built below-grade in a trench with tunnels to cross underneath surface streets (including those carrying the Highway 3 routing). The old split interchange between Highway 3 (Talbot Road) and Highway 401 was replaced by an all-direction junction incorporating a roundabout, from which a new alignment of Talbot Road bypassed the intersection with Outer Drive (which had traffic lights added in 2006) just each of the former split. The Highway 401 extension runs parallel to (but does not replace) Highway 3 until the E. C. Row Expressway. After an interchange to Highway 3 and Labelle Street, the Highway 401 extension then changed direction where it runs parallel westward for , then it turned northwest and follow a new alignment to the under-construction Gordie Howe International Bridge (formerly the &quot;Detroit River International Crossing&quot; and the &quot;New International Trade Crossing&quot;) border crossing.

=== Cayuga bridge replacement ===
Work was done in Cayuga to install a new crossing over the Grand River, replacing the five-span steel structure that previously served traffic since 1924. The new concrete structure was opened to traffic on June 20, 2014, and the former structure was demolished after that. On November 4 and December 4 of that year, construction on the bridge was halted by the Haudenosaunee Confederacy Chiefs Council on the claim that the structure impeded on land reserved for a towpath along the Grand River by the Six Nations of the Grand River First Nation. The remaining work included a scheduled three-day closure during which the new bridge was jacked north to align with the former structure, as well as decorative work.
Work was completed in the autumn of 2015.

<text>The &quot;Pennsylvania&quot; class of six armored cruisers served in the United States Navy from 1905 to 1927. All six were renamed for cities 1912–1920, to make the state names available for the new battleships beginning with the s. All of these served during World War I, with &quot;California&quot; (then &quot;San Diego&quot;) being the only ship of the class to be lost. The remaining five armored cruisers were scrapped between 1930 and 1931 in accordance with the London Naval Treaty.

==Design and construction==
These ships were ordered in fiscal years 1900 (ACR-4 to ACR-6) and 1901 (ACR-7 to ACR-9) as part of the naval buildup touched off by the Spanish–American War. Together with the four immediately succeeding ships they were called the &quot;Big Ten&quot;. They were originally intended to operate in the battle line with battleships. However, their role was changing even as they entered service. The 1904 report of the Navy&#x27;s Bureau of Navigation, examining the results of the Russo-Japanese War, noted that &quot;...the work of the armored cruisers was auxiliary to that of the battleships...&quot; and &quot;They can serve with battleships, but they can never take their place&quot;. In 1906 the US Navy&#x27;s battleships were concentrated in the Atlantic, and three or four armored cruisers were assigned to the Asiatic Fleet in the Philippines to counter Japan&#x27;s rising naval power. By 1912 the rapid development of dreadnought battleships and battlecruisers left the armored cruisers unable to successfully engage the newer capital ships.

===Armament===
These ships were originally armed with four /40 caliber Mark 5 guns in two twin turrets fore and aft. However, these were replaced with 8-inch/45 caliber Mark 6 guns by 1911 as a result of a gun bursting on &quot;Colorado&quot; in 1907. Fourteen /50 caliber Mark 6 guns were mounted in casemates on the sides. The large secondary armament, intended to combat torpedo boats, included eighteen /50 caliber rapid fire (RF) guns and twelve 3-pounder () RF guns. Two 1-pounder () saluting guns and two torpedo tubes were also carried.

===Armor===
In the development of these ships Captain Sigsbee, formerly of the ill-fated , successfully argued for adequate armor protection at the expense of speed. The belt armor was at the waterline with a upper belt, but was only at the ends. The turrets had up to on the faces. The protective deck had on the sloped sides and in the flat middle. The conning tower was thick.

===Engineering===
The engineering plant included 16 coal-fired Babcock &amp; Wilcox boilers (32 Niclausse boilers in the Cramp-built &quot;Pennsylvania&quot; and &quot;Colorado&quot;) supplying steam to two inverted vertical four-cylinder triple-expansion engines, totaling for as designed. On trials &quot;South Dakota&quot; achieved at . The normal coal allowance was 900 tons, but this could be increased to 2,000 tons.

===Refits===
In 1909–1911 the ships&#x27; original 8-inch/40 caliber guns were replaced with four /45 caliber Mark 6 guns in Mark 12 turrets due to a gun bursting on &quot;Colorado&quot; in 1907. From 1911 the military foremasts were replaced with cage masts. In 1911, &quot;Pennsylvania&quot; was fitted with an after flight deck for the first landing on a ship by an aircraft. This was a one-off demonstration on 18 January 1911 with pilot Eugene Ely, who had performed the first takeoff from a ship on two months earlier. From 1915 to the American entry into World War I in April 1917, &quot;Huntington&quot; and two &quot;Tennessee&quot;-class ships had catapults for seaplanes (which disabled the after turret) and carried up to four aircraft; &quot;Huntington&quot; could also tether an observation balloon, which was used during convoy escort duty in the war. However, by late 1917, the aircraft program was cancelled and the catapults removed.

During the US participation in World War I several changes were made to these ships. All but four of the 6-inch guns were removed to arm merchant ships and reduce the potential of flooding through the lower casemates; this was a factor in the loss of &quot;San Diego&quot; (probably to a mine) in July 1918. The 3-inch single-purpose guns were reduced to ten, while two 3-inch/50 caliber anti-aircraft guns were added. However, the official &quot;Ships&#x27; Data Book&quot; series indicates that by 1921 all of the 6-inch guns were remounted, only to be dismounted again by 1929.

By 1919 the 32 Niclausse boilers in &quot;Pittsburgh&quot; (ex-&quot;Pennsylvania&quot;) and &quot;Pueblo&quot; (ex-&quot;Colorado&quot;) were replaced by 20 Babcock &amp; Wilcox boilers. By 1921, &quot;Pueblo&quot; had 16 Babcock &amp; Wilcox boilers, while &quot;Pittsburgh&quot; had 12 Babcock &amp; Wilcox and eight &quot;modified Niclausse&quot; boilers. In 1922, &quot;Pittsburgh&quot;″s forward funnel and the associated boilers were removed, leaving her with 12 Babcock &amp; Wilcox boilers.

In 1922–1923 modernization of the eight survivors of these ships and the &quot;Tennessee&quot; class was considered but not implemented. Possible upgrades would be new boilers and engines for a speed of , a more seaworthy bow, protection improvements, and new triple 8-inch/55 caliber gun turrets as in the .

==Service==
The &quot;Pennsylvania&quot;s spent the years prior to 1917 patrolling Latin America and the Western Pacific. &quot;Colorado&quot; landed troops in a 1912 intervention in Nicaragua. Early in the US participation in World War I the ships operated in the South Atlantic and the Pacific, then most were transferred to convoy escort duty in the North Atlantic. &quot;Pittsburgh&quot; remained in the Pacific, unsuccessfully patrolling for German commerce raiders. While using &quot;Huntington&quot;″s observation balloon on convoy escort duty on 17 September 1917, the balloon landed in the water due to rough weather, with the basket upside down and submerged. Shipfitter First Class Patrick McGunigal received the Medal of Honor for rescuing the pilot. This is said to be the first action in World War I that resulted in the award of the Medal of Honor. &quot;San Diego&quot; was sunk on 19 July 1918, probably by a mine laid by off Fire Island, New York. The wreck remains in place. Most of the ships were decommissioned or relegated to virtually stationary roles such as &quot;receiving ship&quot; in the early 1920s; however, &quot;Pittsburgh&quot; and &quot;Huron&quot; continued to operate for most or all of that decade. All were sold for scrap in 1930–1931 in compliance with the limits of the London Naval Treaty. &quot;Huron&quot; survived as a floating breakwater in Powell River, British Columbia until wrecked by a storm in 1961. Her wreck remains in place.

==Ships in class==
The six ships of the &quot;Pennsylvania&quot; class were:

The &quot;Pennsylvania&quot; class was renamed 1912–1920 to free their names for new battleships; they were given the designation CA (armored cruiser) on 17 July 1920 with the USN&#x27;s adoption of the hull-number system

<text>The Great Seattle Fire was a fire that destroyed the entire central business district of Seattle, Washington, on June 6, 1889. The conflagration lasted for less than a day, burning through the afternoon and into the night, during the same summer as the Great Spokane Fire and the Great Ellensburg Fire. Seattle quickly rebuilt using brick buildings that sat above the original street level. Its population swelled during reconstruction, becoming the largest city in the newly admitted state of Washington.

==Early Seattle==

In the fall of 1851, the Denny Party arrived at Alki Point in what is now the state of Washington. After spending a miserable winter on the western shores of Elliott Bay, the party relocated to the eastern shores and established the settlement that would become Seattle.

Early Seattle was dominated by the logging industry. The combination of a safe bay and an abundance of coniferous trees made Seattle the perfect location for shipping lumber to California. In 1852, Henry Yesler began construction of the first steam-powered mill in the Pacific Northwest. Because of the easy access to lumber, nearly every building was constructed of the affordable, but combustible timber. Additionally, because the area was at or below sea level, the fledgling town was a frequent victim of massive floods, requiring buildings to be built on wooden stilts. The town also used hollowed out scrap logs propped up on wooden braces as sewer and water pipes, increasing the combustible loading.

==Events of the fire==
At approximately 2:20 p.m. on June 6, 1889, an accidentally overheated glue pot in a carpentry shop started the most destructive fire in the history of Seattle. The next day, the &quot;Seattle Post-Intelligencer&quot;, operating out of temporary facilities in the wake of the fire, reported incorrectly that the incident began in &quot;Jim McGough&#x27;s paint shop, under Smith&#x27;s boot and shoe store, at the corner of Front and Madison streets, in what was known as the Denny block&quot;; a correction two weeks later said that it &quot;actually started in the Clairmont and Company cabinet shop, below McGough&#x27;s shop in the basement of the Pontius building&quot;, but the original error was often repeated, including in Murray Morgan&#x27;s bestselling Seattle history book &quot;Skid Road&quot; (1951). John Back, a 24-year-old Swede, was heating the glue over a gasoline fire when it boiled over, igniting the wood chips and turpentine covering the floor. Back attempted to douse the fire with water which only served to spread the fire further. The fire department arrived by 2:45, but by that time the area was so smokey that the source of the fire could not be determined.

===Spread of fire===
Fed by the shop&#x27;s timber and an unusually dry summer, the blaze erupted and shortly devoured the entire block. A nearby liquor store exploded, and the alcohol fueled the flames. The fire quickly spread north to the Kenyon block and the nearby Madison and Griffith blocks. Wooden boardwalks carried the flames across streets to ignite other blocks.

A combination of ill-preparedness and unfortunate circumstances contributed to the great fire. Seattle&#x27;s water supply was insufficient in fighting the giant inferno. Fire hydrants were sparsely located on every other street, usually connected to small pipes. There were so many hydrants in use during the fire that the water pressure was too weak to fight such a massive blaze. Seattle was also operated by a volunteer fire department, which was competent but inadequate in extinguishing the fire.

===Magnitude of destruction===
By the morning of June 7, the fire had burned 25 city blocks, including the entire business district, four of the city&#x27;s wharves, and its railroad terminals. The fire would be called the most destructive fire in the history of Seattle.
Despite the massive destruction of property, few to no deaths occurred. Some claim a young boy named James Goin was killed in the blaze although no reliable records have been found from that time. However, there were fatalities during the cleanup process. Over 1 million rodents were killed. Total losses were estimated at nearly $20 million ($ in dollars).

Among the businesses affected were:

==Reconstruction and recovery==
Despite the magnitude of destruction, the rebuilding effort began quickly. Rather than starting over somewhere else, Seattle&#x27;s citizens decided to rebuild. Seattle rebuilt from the ashes quickly, and the fire killed many rats and other vermin, thereby eliminating the city&#x27;s rodent problems. A new building ordinance resulted in a downtown of brick and stone buildings, rather than wood.

In the year following the fire Seattle&#x27;s population actually grew by nearly 20,000 to 40,000 inhabitants from the influx of people helping to recreate the city. Supplies and funds came from all over the West Coast to support the relief effort. The population increase made Seattle the largest city in Washington, making it a leading contender in becoming the terminus of the Great Northern Railway.

===Post-fire reform===
Seattle made many improvements in response to the fire. The Seattle Fire Department was officially established four months later to replace a volunteer organization with a paid force containing new firehouses and a new chief. The city took control of the water supply, increasing the number of hydrants and adding larger pipes. The advent of brick buildings to downtown Seattle was one of the many architectural improvements the city made in the wake of the fire. New city ordinances set standards for the thickness of walls and required &quot;division walls&quot; between buildings. These changes became principal features of post-fire construction and are still visible in Seattle&#x27;s Pioneer Square district today, the present-day location of the fire. At Pioneer Square, guided tours are also available to paying customers. Also at this location, visitors can tour the Seattle Underground, where they can visit the original street level (now basement level) of buildings and storefronts that were built after the fire.

<text>The 1947–48 NHL season was the 31st season of the National Hockey League. Six teams each played 60 games. The Toronto Maple Leafs were the Stanley Cup winners. They defeated the Detroit Red Wings four games to none. This season saw the introduction of a new trophy – Art Ross Trophy – that would be handed out to the player who scored the most points during the regular season.

==Regular season==
The season saw the return of the National Hockey League All-Star Game, an idea that, although proposed in the previous season, came into fruition this year. The all-star game, however, saw a bad ankle injury to Chicago Black Hawks forward Bill Mosienko that nearly ended his career. Other stars would retire, ending both the Montreal Canadiens&#x27; Punch line and the Boston Bruins&#x27; Kraut line. However, this season saw the creation of the Detroit Red Wings&#x27; Production Line. The policy of having players raise their hockey sticks to signify that a goal was scored was also initiated in this season, at the suggestion of Frank Patrick, with Habs forward Billy Reay being the first to do on November 13, 1947. The season also saw Boston&#x27;s Don Gallinger suspended indefinitely pending an investigation of gambling activities and the New York Rangers&#x27; Billy &quot;The Kid&quot; Taylor being expelled for life for gambling.

Seven games into the season, the Toronto Maple Leafs and Chicago Black Hawks made, at that time, the biggest trade in NHL history. The Maple Leafs sent five players to the Black Hawks in trade for Max Bentley and rookie winger Cy Thomas. Thomas only played eight games that year but Bentley handed to the Leafs a much-needed offensive boost that helped propel the team to first overall and an eventual Stanley Cup.

The New York Rangers decided to make a trade to improve their fortunes and sent Hal Laycoe, Joe Bell, and George Robertson to Montreal in exchange for Buddy O&#x27;Connor and defenceman Frank Eddolls. Montreal missed O&#x27;Connor, as their goal-scoring plummeted. Ken Mosdell was out from the start of the season with a broken arm, Rocket Richard had trouble with a bad knee and Murph Chamberlain broke his leg. In an attempt to boost the goal-scoring, Montreal traded Jimmy Peters and Johnny Quilty to Boston in exchange for Joe Carveth, but the rot continued. However, the worst occurred on January 11, 1948, when the Canadiens played the Rangers at Madison Square Garden. The Habs lost more than a game when Bill Juzda checked captain Toe Blake into the boards, breaking Blake&#x27;s ankle and ending his career. It was also the end of the famed &quot;Punch Line&quot;. (Ironically, that same night, Johnny Quilty&#x27;s career was ended with a compound fracture of the leg). The Canadiens missed the playoffs for the first time since 1940, and Bill Durnan, for the only time in his career, failed to win the Vezina Trophy. This season was also the last season in which a goaltender was allowed to be named captain of their team. Bill Durnan was the last goaltender in NHL history to be captain. Toronto&#x27;s Turk Broda won the Vezina this season.

===Semifinals===

====(1) Toronto Maple Leafs vs. (3) Boston Bruins====
Toronto defeated Boston four games to one, although Boston kept it closer than the series tally would indicate. Three of the five games were decided by a single goal.

====(2) Detroit Red Wings vs. (4) New York Rangers====

It looked initially to be a close series as, after the Blueshirts lost the first two games, the Rangers won the next two to tie the series. Detroit then took the next two to win the series in six games to qualify for the Finals.

<text>The Brooker Highway is a highway in the Australian state of Tasmania. As one of Hobart&#x27;s three major radials, the highway connects traffic from the city centre with the northern suburbs and is the major road connection to the cities and towns of northern Tasmania. With an annual average daily traffic of 48,000, the highway is one of the busiest in Tasmania. The Brooker Highway has recently been declared part of the National Highway.

The Brooker Highway runs approximately north from the central business district, through the northern suburbs of Hobart, and through the City of Glenorchy, bypassing commercial and industrial centres along the original Main Road. It is primarily a four lane (dual-carriageway) highway, and apart from the Domain Highway junction, only the northern sections of the highway have grade separated junctions. The remainder of the junctions are regulated by traffic light intersections.

While the highway is substantially less congested than in other states during peak hours, it is more congested off-peak than roads in Queensland, Western Australia, and almost as congested as those in New South Wales. It is thus a busy road by any Australian standard. The Brooker Highway is currently below the acceptable levels of service, and congestion issues are expected to worsen significantly over the next 20 years with the highway already approaching its designed capacity. A current proposal to convert the South Line rail corridor for use as a light rail system has the potential to alleviate the Brooker Highway&#x27;s traffic problems.

==History==

The first stage of the Brooker Avenue was constructed as a dual carriageway four-lane road in 1954 between Risdon Road, New Town, and Elwick Road, Glenorchy. The north-bound and south-bound roads were divided by a wide median strip with trees planted at intervals. At various points the median strip was dissected by a short roadway to enable traffic to U-turn to the opposite direction. 

In 1957 work began on extending the road into Hobart city. This work dissected part of the former racecourse grounds at Cornelian Bay, and the obliteration of Batman Place which was the location of huts built for affordable housing. The road was built on an embankment which crossed the Main Line Railway and Bellevue Parade via a concrete bridge. The road skirted around the edge of the Queens Domain to an area known as Cleary&#x27;s Gates. At the intersection with the Domain Highway, a grade-separated intersection was completed which is commonly known as the &#x27;clover-leaf&#x27;. Between here and the city the new road consumed much of Park Street. 

At Liverpool St a new roundabout, named &#x27;Railway Roundabout&#x27; (as it was adjacent to Hobart Passenger Rail Terminal), was completed in 1960. In 1965, the Hobart Area Transportation Study was released and entailed large development plans for the Brooker Highway, that included extension as far as Granton. By 1966 the road was extended from Elwick Road to the Main Road at Berriedale. This entailed some shoreline reclamation works at Montrose Bay. 

In 1977 the highway was further extended, taking the road from a new interchange at Berriedale Road to the Claremont Link Road. This section was initially a single-lane road each-way but with a third climbing lane in the north direction. In 1981 the final section between Claremont Link Road and Midland Highway at Granton was commenced. This was opened in 1983 as a single-lane road each-way, and with a long climbing lane in the south direction, commencing from Black Snake Lane and merging in near Hilton Road, in Austins Ferry. In 1992 the four-lane dual carriageway highway that stands today was completed through to Granton and the Bridgewater bridge. 

The Brooker Highway was built as a replacement to the original Midland Highway route between Hobart city and Granton, which passed along Elizabeth Street, New Town Road and Main Road, through the built up areas of New Town, Moonah, Glenorchy, Rosetta, Montrose, Claremont and Berriedale.
This was the first major highway construction in the Hobart City region, and was named Brooker Highway, after the Minister for Transport at the time of the conception of the project, Edward Brooker. Although the road&#x27;s formal name is Brooker &quot;Avenue&quot;, it is more commonly referred to as Brooker &quot;Highway&quot; whilst the section between Berriedale and Granton is often referred to as the &quot;Northern Outlet&quot;.

===Timeline===

* 1954: Stage One: Risdon Road, New Town – Elwick Road, Glenorchy.
* 1959: Stage Two: Risdon Road, New Town – Liverpool St, CBD (Railway Roundabout completed 1960).
* 1966: Stage Three: Elwick Road, Glenorchy – Main Road, Berriedale.
* 1977: Stage Four: Main Road, Berriedale – Claremont Link Road, Claremont (single carriageway with north climbing lane).
* 1983: Stage Five: Claremont Link Road, Claremont – Midland Hwy, Granton (single carriageway with south climbing lane).
* 1992: Stage Six: Claremont Link Road, Claremont – Black Snake Lane, Granton (dual carriageway).

===Lighting===
In April 2007, the Department of Infrastructure, Energy and Resources announced plans to replace the sub-standard rusted light poles between Risdon Road and Clearys Gates Road. These are over 40 years old and were the first lights on the Highway, which sparked some concern from the Hobart City Council. They argue that the light poles are in good condition and are a significant feature of the Brooker Highway entrance to Hobart. While the Hobart City Council supports the replacement, they have written to Infrastructure Minister Jim Cox asking him to consider retaining the ornate arms on modern pole bases.

===2010 emergency landing incident===
On 4 April 2010 18-year-old pilot Patrick Humphries made world headlines by using the normally busy highway as an emergency landing strip after running out of fuel. Humphries was unhurt from the accident and no vehicles were involved in the incident.

===2016–17 Elwick Rd/Goodwood Rd and Howard Rd/Renfrew Cir intersection upgrades===
Before 2016, Elwick Road and Goodwood Road formed two separate t-junctions on opposite sides of the Brooker Hwy offset by around 100m. The upgrade undertaken between January 2016 and May 2017 aligned Elwick Road with Goodwood Road so that one set of traffic lights could be removed. Extra lanes were also added.

At the same time the adjacent Brooker Highway intersection, Howard Road / Renfrew Circuit was also converted from a five-exit two-lane roundabout to a traffic-lights controlled intersection. The fifth exit from the former Brooker Highway roundabout, Timsbury Road, is now accessed from Howard Rd. The contract for the works, awarded to Hazell Bros was worth $32 million.

==Future==

In February 2011, the Department of Infrastructure, Energy and Resources revealed intentions to within 3 years &quot;Finalise design options for Domain Highway intersection and increased lane capacity between Domain Highway and Risdon Road&quot;. This intention was reaffirmed in an October 2017 submission by the Tasmanian Government to Infrastructure Australia: &quot;Brooker Highway - Risdon Road to Domain Highway - no cost estimate, concept designs to be prepared.&quot;

The Department of State Growth released a report titled Hobart Congestion Traffic Analysis 2016 prepared by traffic engineer Keith Midson. Under long-term solutions, the report considered the Liverpool St intersection with the Brooker Hwy, also known as the &#x27;railway roundabout&#x27;. The report stated &quot;The railway roundabout is a major cause of congestion... A possible solution is the grade separation of the roundabout.&quot;

Recently the government came under pressure from the community to improve pedestrian access over the highway at Goodwood and eliminate the stairs primarily for the benefit of the elderly and handicapped.

==Route description==
The highway starts in the Hobart CBD at the junction with Eastern Outlet (A3, Tasman Highway), Davey Street (A6) and Macquarie Street (A6). The Tasman Highway heads east over the Tasman Bridge, past the Airport and eventually leads to the east coast of the state, while Davey Street leads towards the Southern Outlet (A6), which in turn heads south towards Kingston and Huonville (Davey and Macquarie are one-way streets - Davey Street flows south-west, and Macquarie Street flows north-east through the CBD).

Apart from the connection to Davey and Macquarie Streets, the major intersection with streets in the CBD is the three-lane roundabout at the north-east end of Liverpool Street. Because it was built in close proximity to the main railway station at the time, the roundabout was, and continues to be, called the &quot;Railway Roundabout&quot;. The sunken garden in the centre of the roundabout functions as a pedestrian thoroughfare, with under-road tunnels connecting to the two sides of Liverpool Street, the original site of the railway station to the north-east, and to the Domain and the suburb of The Glebe to the north-west. The roundabout was originally just an un-controlled intersection, but with the gradual increase in traffic, particularly from the eastern shore of the Derwent, it was often in grid-lock at peak travel times. Traffic lights were introduced and alleviated the situation, and later construction of the direct links from the Tasman Bridge to Davey and Macquarie Streets further relieved the pressure. Other streets from the CBD provide access to the highway, but for much of its length to the city boundary at Risdon Road it is limited access road.

Through the City of Glenorchy the highway has large multi-lane intersections, at Risdon Road, Elwick Road and Derwent Park Road. The highway is in a reasonable condition for its age, but does experience congestion for certain periods during the day.

Trees line the middle nature strip for several kilometres, and fencing prevents pedestrian access at various points. 
The Highway makes its way past The Domain, Cornelian Bay Hockey Grounds, Rugby Park, The Royal Hobart Showgrounds, Tattersalls Park and the Derwent Entertainment Centre. 
At the northern end (at Granton) it connects to the Midland Highway (National Highway 1) (which heads north towards Launceston) and the Lyell Highway (A10) (which takes motorists towards the west coast).

<text>The Valmet M82 is a bullpup assault rifle with a Valmet RK 62 76 internal design created by Finnish company Valmet.

==History==
The M82 was introduced in Finland in 1978 and discontinued production in 1986. Only around 2,000 were manufactured, mostly as semi-automatic versions in 5.56 mm NATO caliber for ODIN International Ltd. of Alexandria, Virginia. A few samples were issued to Finnish Army paratroopers, but the rifle was found to be unsuitable as a service weapon. One issue that cropped up during its short service life was that the rear sight of an uncased rifle had a tendency to hit the lower face, nose and cheekbones of the paratrooper during landing. The rifle was also poorly balanced, as nearly all the weight was in the rear.

==Technical data==
It is chambered for 5.56×45mm NATO caliber as model 255 470 and for 7.62×39mm caliber as model 255 490. It has a Valmet RK 62 76 receiver, which is made from stamped and riveted sheet metal, constructed inside urethane stock. The trigger of the weapon is polymer to prevent heat of the barrel conducting to it, as the trigger is mounted to the barrel of the gun.

==Features==
The M82 features an unusual sight arrangement. The front and rear sights, similar to a Bren light machine gun or some other belt fed machineguns, are offset to the left. The sights are aligned normally with the right eye, but are offset from the barrel about 3.175 cm. This results in the rifles windage being accurate for the zeroed range only. Shots taken at closer ranges to zero will hit to the right of the target and shots taken at longer ranges will hit to the left of the target. With the sight offset from the barrel by approximately 3.175 cm, if the rifles windage were zeroed at 50 meters, at 100 meters&#x27; distance the windage error would be about 3.175 cm and at 200 meters&#x27; distance the windage error would be 9.575 cm. This results in a margin of error making shots over 300 meters difficult. Since the fixed sights do not allow for any elevation adjustment, it is clear that this weapon is meant for combat accuracy (15.24 cm at 100 meters) at short/urban ranges only and not meant to be a precision sniping tool.

The offset sight arrangement and right side ejection mean that this weapon is very difficult to use for left-handed users. Modern bullpups have eliminated this drawback by using centrally-aligned optics and either forward, downward or rearward ejection to allow ambidextrous use in combat situations.

<doc id="787518" wikidata="Q2427600" url="?curid=787518" title="Air Force Cross (United Kingdom)">
<text>The Air Force Cross (AFC) is a military decoration awarded to officers, and since 1993 other ranks, of the British Armed Forces, and formerly also to officers of the other Commonwealth countries. It is granted for &quot;an act or acts of exemplary gallantry while flying, though not in active operations against the enemy&quot;. A bar is added to the ribbon for holders who are awarded a further AFC.

== History ==
The award was established on 3 June 1918, shortly after the formation of the Royal Air Force (RAF). It was originally awarded to RAF commissioned officers and Warrant Officers, but was later expanded to include Royal Navy and army aviation officers.

While consistently awarded for service while &quot;flying though not in active operations against the enemy&quot;, the AFC was originally awarded for &quot;valour, courage or devotion to duty whilst flying&quot; with many awards made for meritorious service over a period of time, rather than a specific act of bravery. These awards were discontinued in 1993, when the criteria were narrowed to &quot;exemplary gallantry while flying&quot;.

A bar is added to the ribbon of holders of the AFC for each further award, with a silver rosette worn on the ribbon when worn alone to denote the award of each bar.

Recipients of the Air Force Cross are entitled to use the post-nominal letters &quot;AFC&quot;.

Between 1919 and 1932 the AFC was also awarded to civilians, on the same basis as for RAF personnel. In March 1941 eligibility was extended to Naval officers of the Fleet Air Arm, and in November 1942 to Army officers, with posthumous awards permitted from 1979.

Since the 1993 review of the honours system as part of the drive to remove distinctions of rank in bravery awards, all ranks of all arms of the Armed Forces have been eligible, and the Air Force Medal, which had until then been awarded to other ranks, was discontinued.

The AFC had also been awarded by Commonwealth countries but by the 1990s most, including Canada, Australia and New Zealand, had established their own honours systems and no longer recommended British honours.

==Description==
* The medal is a silver cross, in height and wide, representing aircraft propeller blades, with wings between the arms. It was design by Edward Carter Preston.
* The obverse depicts Hermes, riding on the wings of a hawk holding a laurel wreath. At the top of the upper arm is the royal crown, while the other three arms bear the royal cypher of the reigning monarch at the time of issue.
* The reverse is plain, except for a central roundel bearing the reigning monarch&#x27;s cypher and the date &#x27;1918&#x27;. Originally awarded unnamed, from 1939 the year of issue was engraved on the reverse lower limb of cross, and since 1984 it has been awarded named to the recipient.
* The suspender is straight and decorated with laurel wreaths.
* The ribbon bar denoting a further award is silver, with the Royal Air Force eagle in its centre. Bars awarded during World War II have the year of award engraved on the reverse.
* The 32 mm (1.25 inch) ribbon was originally white with red broad horizontal stripes, but changed in July 1919 to the current white with red broad diagonal stripes at a 45-degree angle. 
==Recipients==
===Numbers awarded===
From 1918 to 2017 approximately 5,360 Air Force Crosses and 193 bars have been awarded. The figures to 1979 are laid out in the table below, the dates reflecting the relevant entries in the London Gazette:
In addition, between 1980 and 2017 approximately 279 AFCs and eight second-award bars have been awarded.

The above figures include awards to the Dominions:

In all, 560 AFCs have gone to Canadians, including those serving in the RAF, including 70 for World War I, 462 and one bar for World War II and 28 post–war awards.

A total of 444 AFCs and two bars have been awarded to Australians, the last award made in 1983.

A number of awards were made to New Zealanders until the AFC was replaced by the New Zealand Gallantry Decoration in 1999.

A total of 87 honorary awards have been made to members of allied foreign forces, including 26 for World War I, 58 for World War II and three post-war, the latter all to members of the US Air Force.

===Notable awards===

* George Bulman (1896–1963); awarded the AFC three times for services as a test pilot.
* Geoffrey Dhenin (1918–2008); awarded the AFC twice for his role in the British nuclear weapons tests in Australia (1954 and 1959).
*Marshal of the Royal Air Force Andrew Humphrey (1921–1977); awarded the AFC three times,
* Willie Read (1885–1972); awarded the AFC three times.
* H. P. Ruffell Smith (1911–1980); awarded the AFC three times.

<text>Trahern () is a legendary King of the Britons in Geoffrey of Monmouth&#x27;s fictional &quot;Historia Regum Britanniae&quot;. 

According to Geoffrey, Trahern was king of the Britons and Roman senator. He was the brother of the late Coel Hen and uncle of Saint Helena. Trahern was sent by Emperor Constantine I to restore Britain to Roman rule during the usurpation of Octavius (Eudaf).

When Octavius took control of Britain from Rome, Constantine sent three Roman legions to Britain under the command of Trahern. He landed at &#x27;Kaerperis&#x27; and captured it forcing Octavius to conscript all the island into the army to combat the Roman legions. Octavius met Trahern in a field outside Winchester where they fought and Octavius won. 

Trahern fled to Albany and pillaged the land. That caused Octavius to react again, where he met Trahern in Westmorland, but Octavius was defeated this time. Octavius fled Britain and Trahern took on the crown himself. A few years later, supporters of Octavius, who was in exile in Norway, attacked Trahern in a forest. They killed him and Octavius immediately returned and was recrowned king.

<doc id="787561" wikidata="Q7598269" url="?curid=787561" title="Standard Occupational Classification System">
<text>The Standard Occupational Classification (SOC) System is a United States government system for classifying occupations. It is used by U.S. federal government agencies collecting occupational data, enabling comparison of occupations across data sets. It is designed to cover all occupations in which work is performed for pay or profit, reflecting the current occupational structure in the United States. The 2018 SOC includes 867 detailed occupations.

Users of occupational data include human resources professionals, government program managers, industrial and labor relations practitioners, students considering career training, job seekers, vocational training schools, and employers wishing to set salary scales or locate a new plant.

An occupation is defined as a group of &quot;jobs that are similar with respect to the work performed and the skills possessed by workers.&quot; Therefore, different jobs with similar duties and job requirements would be in the same occupation. For example, a bank branch manager and a city treasurer would both be part of the Financial Manager occupation in the SOC.

The detailed occupations in the SOC can be combined into 459 broad occupations, 98 minor groups, and 23 major groups. The SOC codes have a hierarchical format, so for example the code &quot;15-0000&quot; refers to occupations in the &quot;Computer and Mathematical Occupations&quot; major group, and &quot;15-1252&quot; is a subset for the &quot;Software Developers&quot; detailed occupation.

The SOC does not categorize industries or employers. There are parallel category systems for industries used with SOC data, most commonly NAICS.

Other countries have national occupational classification systems and the International Labour Organization, an agency of the United Nations, has developed the International Standard
Classification of Occupations.

== Job Titles and SOC Codes ==
The Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) maintains the Direct Match Title File (DMTF) that contains job titles that match detailed occupations in the SOC. For example, the following job titles all match to the occupation Bill and Account Collectors (SOC code of 43-3011): Collection Agent, Collections Clerk, Collections Representative, Debt Collector, Installment Agent, Installment Loan Collector, Insurance Collector, Payment Collector, Repossessor, and Billing Clerk.

In some cases a job title does not match one-for-one with an occupation. For example, the job title &quot;painter&quot; is not in the DMTF because it could be associated with a fine arts occupation or a maintenance occupation. In these and other cases, persons wishing to match a job with an occupation can examine the definitions of the detailed occupations. For example, the definition of the occupation of Painters, Construction and Maintenance (SOC code of 47-2141) is:
&quot;Paint walls, equipment, buildings, bridges, and other structural surfaces, using brushes, rollers, and spray guns. May remove old paint to prepare surface prior to painting. May mix colors or oils to obtain desired color or consistency.&quot; On the other hand, the definition of the occupation of Fine Artists, Including Painters, Sculptors, and Illustrators (SOC code of 27-1013) is: &quot;Create original artwork using any of a wide variety of media and techniques.&quot;

Interested parties can submit suggested additions to the job titles included in the DMTF.

== Major Group Occupations ==
=== List ===
The detailed occupations in the SOC can be combined into 23 major groups.
* Architecture and engineering occupations
* Arts, design, entertainment, sports, and media occupations
* Building and grounds cleaning and maintenance occupations
* Business and financial operations occupations
* Community and social services occupations
* Computer and mathematical occupations
* Construction and extraction occupations
* Education, training, and library occupations
* Farming, fishing, and forestry occupations
* Food preparation and serving related occupations
* Healthcare practitioners and technical occupations
* Healthcare support occupations
* Installation, maintenance, and repair occupations
* Legal occupations
* Life, physical, and social science occupations
* Management occupations
* Military specific occupations
* Office and administrative support occupations
* Personal care and service occupations
* Production occupations
* Protective service occupations
* Sales and related occupations
* Transportation and material moving occupations

=== Employment and Earnings ===
Across all occupations, BLS reports total employment to be 151,853,870 and the annual mean wage to be $65,470. Total employment and annual mean wage for each major group is in the following table.
=== Environmental Conditions ===
Across all occupations, 6.9 percent of all workers are exposed to hazardous contaminants. 

Across all occupations, about 67 percent of all workers are not exposed to the outdoors. However, among all workers, 4.1 percent are constantly exposed to the outdoors, 3.7 percent are frequently exposed to the outdoors, 15.1 percent are occasionally exposed to the outdoors, and 10.2 percent are seldomly exposed to the outdoors. Exposure to hazardous contaminants and exposure to the outdoors (seldom, occasional, frequent, or constant) for each major group are in the following table.
=== Minimum Education Requirements ===
Minimum education is the minimum education required by a job, not the educational attainment of the worker. A worker may have attained more education than the minimum required by a job.

Among all workers, 30.0 percent are in jobs with no minimum education requirement, 40.1 percent are in jobs where a high school degree is the minimum requirement, 19.3 percent are in jobs where a bachelor&#x27;s degree is the minimum requirement, and 10.6 percent are in jobs with some other minimum requirement (for example, a graduate degree).

The percentages in the various minimum requirement categories for each major group in the SOC are shown in the following table.
=== Physical Requirements ===
The maximum weight lifted or carried averaged 25.58 pounds for all workers. For all workers, the percentage of the workday a person is required to stand averaged 56.3 percent of the workday. The figures for each major group in the SOC are in the following table.

=== Pace of Work and Breaks ===
Across all occupations, 38.9 percent of all workers are required to work at a consistent and generally fast pace, 52.9 percent are required to work at a pace that varies, and 8.2 percent at a consistent and generally slow pace. 

About 56.2 percent of workers have the ability to “pause work and take short, unscheduled breaks throughout the workday.”

Pace of work and the ability to pause work for each major group are in the following table.

== History ==
The SOC was established in 1977, and revised by a committee representing specialists from across U.S. government agencies in the 1990s. SOC codes were updated again in 2010, and on November 28, 2017, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) published a Federal Register notice detailing the final decisions for the 2018 SOC.

====History====
A featherweight boxer weighs in at a limit of . In the early days of the division, this limit fluctuated. The British have generally always recognized the limit at 126 pounds, but in America the weight limit was at first 114 pounds. An early champion, George Dixon, moved the limit to 120 and then 122 pounds. Finally, in 1920 the United States fixed the limit at 126 pounds.

The 1860 fight between Nobby Clark and Jim Elliott is sometimes called the first featherweight championship. However, the division only gained wide acceptance in 1889 after the Ike Weir–Frank Murphy fight.

Since the end of the 2000s and early 2010s the featherweight division is one of the most active in boxing with fighters such as Orlando Salido, Chris John, Juan Manuel López, Celestino Caballero, Elio Rojas, Israel Vazquez, Cristobal Cruz, Rafael Márquez, Rocky Juarez, Steven Luevano, Naseem Hamed, Marco Antonio Barrera and Manny Pacquiao.

<text>Welterweight is a weight class in combat sports. Originally the term &quot;welterweight&quot; was used only in boxing, but other combat sports like muay Thai, taekwondo, and mixed martial arts also use it for their own weight division system to classify the opponents. If used, welterweight is typically between lightweight and middleweight.

==Etymology==
The first known instance of the term is from 1831, meaning &#x27;heavyweight horseman&#x27;, later &#x27;boxer or wrestler of a certain weight&#x27; by 1896. This sense comes from earlier &quot;welter&quot;, &#x27;heavyweight horseman or boxer&#x27; from 1804, possibly from 15th century , meaning &#x27;to beat severely&#x27;.

==Boxing==
===Professional boxing===
A professional welterweight boxer&#x27;s weight is greater than 140 pounds, and no more than 147 pounds (about 63–67 kg).

<text>Super heavyweight is a weight class in combat sports and competitive bodybuilding.

==Boxing==
In amateur boxing, the super heavyweight division is a weight class division for fighters weighing in excess of 91 kilograms (200 pounds). Introduced for the 1984 Summer Olympics, the division is the amateur equivalent of the heavyweight division in professional boxing. The super heavyweight division was introduced because the general increase in the weight of top heavyweights throughout the 20th century meant that the heavyweight division became excessively broad, with the smaller men having little chance of competing effectively. Therefore, the bigger men were split off into the new super heavyweight division. Professional boxing also made this split, but instead of renaming the unlimited division, it introduced the cruiserweight division for the smaller heavyweights, and continued to call the unlimited division heavyweight. In the International Kickboxing Federation (IKF), the Super Heavyweight class (pro and amateur) is for kickboxers weighing and above.

==Mixed martial arts==

The super heavyweight division in MMA generally refers to competitors weighing more than 265 lb (120 kg), as up to 265 a competitor is considered to be part of the heavyweight division. In modern MMA, no current major organisation has introduced an actual super heavyweight division. The WEC was the only major promotion to possess a Super Heavyweight championship (2005–2006). The WEC Super Heavyweight division was abolished in December 2006 when Zuffa purchased the organization.

==Professional wrestling==
Although not generally used as a formal weight division in professional wrestling, the term &quot;super heavyweight&quot; is frequently used informally to refer to outsized wrestlers, typically with large obese physiques.

==Robot combat==
Superheavyweight is a class in robot combat as well, with &quot;superheavyweight&quot; robots able to weigh up to 340 pounds.

<text>Established in 1918, Tallinn University of Technology (TalTech; ) is the only technical university in Estonia. TalTech, in the capital city of Tallinn, is a university for engineering, business, public administration and maritime affairs. TalTech has colleges in Tartu and Kohtla-Järve. Despite the similar names, Tallinn University and Tallinn University of Technology are separate institutions.

==History==
In the early twentieth century, Estonia recognised an urgent need for locally trained engineering specialists. Until then, young people from Estonia had received their specialist education in St. Petersburg, Germany or Riga. Opportunities had to be sought for engineering-minded people to acquire an Estonian-based education which was adapted to local conditions and needs; Estonia was in the process of establishing itself as an independent country.

On 17 September 1918, the Estonian Engineering Society opened an Estonian-based engineering school named Special Engineering Courses. That date has been recognised as the founding date of Tallinn University of Technology. Programmes were offered in mechanical, electrical, civil and hydraulic engineering, shipbuilding and architecture. In 1919, the school became the private Tallinn College of Engineering, which in 1920 was declared a state institution. Teachers&#x27; efforts to develop an Estonian terminology for science and technology proved fruitful and the first engineering books were published. In 1923, the first engineering graduation theses were defended in Estonia. In the same year, a state laboratory of materials testing opened for research work.

By the 15 September 1936 Act of the Head of State, the school was granted university status, and named Tallinn Technical Institute. The institute had two faculties: civil and mechanical engineering and chemistry and mining. In 1938, the name Tallinn Technical University (Tallinna Tehnikaülikool, TTÜ in Estonian) was effective. In 1940 the Faculty of Economics, in 1958 the Faculty of Power Engineering and in 1965 the Faculty of Control Engineering were founded. After 2003 the university was known in English as Tallinn University of Technology (TUT).

On 1 July 2008, TTÜ took over International University Audentes (IUA), which became part of the Faculty of Economics and Business Administration, except the Law School which joined the Faculty of Social Sciences. In 2014 an agreement for a merger of the Estonian Maritime Academy with TTÜ was signed.

On 16 November 2016, TTÜ and the Estonian Information Technology College signed a merger agreement. Since 1 August 2017, the IT College is a part of TTÜ.

On 17 September 2018, Tallinn University of Technology adopted a new short name TalTech, replacing the previous abbreviations such as TTÜ, TUT and TTU.

==TalTech today==
There are over 30 fully accredited international degree programmes (4 Bachelor programmes, 18 Master programmes and 10 PhD programmes) that are available fully in English.

TalTech conducts research and develops high-tech applications in many fields: 
* Organic and analytic chemistry (Chemistry) 
* Food biotechnology and neurobiology (Biotechnology)

<text>Sim racing is the collective term for racing games that attempt to accurately simulate auto racing, complete with real-world variables such as fuel usage, damage, tire wear and grip, and suspension settings. To be competitive in sim racing, a driver must understand all aspects of car handling that make real-world racing so difficult, such as threshold braking, how to maintain control of a car as the tires lose traction, and how properly to enter and exit a turn without sacrificing speed. It is this level of difficulty that distinguishes sim racing from arcade racing-style driving games where real-world variables are taken out of the equation and the principal objective is to create a sense of speed as opposed to a sense of realism like the Need for Speed series.
Due to the complexity and demands of mimicking real-life driving, racing sims require faster computers to run effectively, as well as a steering wheel and pedals for the throttle and brakes for the immersion. While using a gamepad or even a mouse and keyboard, may suffice for most arcade-style driving games on home systems, it would not provide the same level of immersion and realism as using a racing wheel and pedals. In recent years, many sim racing experiences have been developed for consoles, such as the PlayStation and Xbox. While these games can be played with a controller, it is recommended that players invest in a racing wheel and pedals. With the development of online racing, the ability to drive against human opponents and computer AI offline is the closest many would come to driving cars on a real track. Even those who race in real-world competition use simulations for practice or for entertainment. With continued development of the physics engine software that forms the basis of these sims, as well as improved hardware (providing tactile feedback), the experience has become more realistic.

The sim racing gameplay style has been applied in several video games, such as &quot;iRacing&quot;, &quot;Assetto Corsa&quot; and &quot;Assetto Corsa Competizione&quot;, &quot;Gran Turismo&quot;, &quot;Forza Motorsport&quot;, and more.

==History of sim racing ==
===Arcade simulator era (1982–1989)===
Prior to the division between arcade-style racing and sim racing, the earliest attempts at providing driving simulation experiences were arcade racing video games, dating back to &quot;Pole Position&quot;, a 1982 arcade game developed by Namco, which the game&#x27;s publisher Atari publicized for its &quot;unbelievable driving realism&quot; in providing a Formula 1 experience behind a racing wheel at the time. It featured other AI cars to race against, crashes caused by collisions with other vehicles and roadside signs, and introduced a qualifying lap concept where the player needs to complete a time trial before they can compete in Grand Prix races. It also pioneered the third-person rear-view perspective used in most racing games since then, with the track&#x27;s vanishing point swaying side to side as the player approaches corners, accurately simulating forward movement into the distance. In a 2007 retrospective review, &quot;Eurogamer&quot; called it &quot;a simulation down to the core: those dedicated will eventually reap success but most will be deterred by the difficulty&quot;.&quot;Pole Position II&quot; was released in 1983 and featured several improvements like giving the player the choice of different race courses. &quot;TX-1&quot;, developed by Tatsumi in 1983, was licensed to Namco, who in turn licensed it to Atari in America, thus the game is considered a successor to &quot;Pole Position II&quot;. &quot;TX-1&quot;, however, placed a greater emphasis on realism, with details such as forcing players to brake or downshift the gear during corners to avoid the risk of losing control, and let go of the accelerator when going into a skid in order to regain control of the steering. It also used force feedback technology, which caused the steering wheel to vibrate, and the game also featured a unique three-screen arcade display for a more three-dimensional perspective of the track. It also introduced nonlinear gameplay by allowing players to choose which path to drive through after each checkpoint, eventually leading to one of eight possible final destinations.

Since the mid-1980s, it became a trend for arcade racing games to use hydraulic motion simulator arcade cabinets. The trend was sparked by Sega&#x27;s &quot;taikan&quot; games, with &quot;taikan&quot; meaning &quot;body sensation&quot; in Japanese. The &quot;taikan&quot; trend began when Yu Suzuki&#x27;s team at Sega (later known as Sega AM2) developed &quot;Hang-On&quot; (1985), a racing video game where the player sits on and moves a motorbike replica to control the in-game actions. &quot;Hang-On&quot; was a popular Grand Prix style rear-view motorbike racer, was considered the first full-body-experience video game, and was regarded as the first motorbike simulator for its realism at the time, in both the handling of the player&#x27;s motorbike and the AI of the computer-controlled motorcyclists. It used force feedback technology and was also one of the first arcade games to use 16-bit graphics and Sega&#x27;s &quot;Super Scaler&quot; technology that allowed pseudo-3D sprite-scaling at high frame rates. Suzuki&#x27;s team at Sega followed it with hydraulic motion simulator cabinets for later racing games, such as &quot;Out Run&quot; in 1986.

In 1986, Konami released &quot;WEC Le Mans&quot;, an early car driving simulator based on the 24 Hours of Le Mans. It attempted to realistically simulate car driving, with the car jumping up and down, turning back and forth, and spinning up to 180 degrees, with an emphasis on acceleration, braking, and gear shifting, along with the need for counter-steering to avoid spin-outs. It also featured a day-night cycle, accurately simulated courses approved by the Automobile Club de l&#x27;Ouest, and force feedback to simulate road vibration in the form of a vibrating steering wheel that reacts to the driver&#x27;s acceleration and off-road bumps. The first racing game with simulation pretensions on a home system is believed to have been &quot;Chequered Flag&quot;, released by Psion on the 8-bit ZX Spectrum in 1983. &quot;REVS&quot;, followed in 1986. &quot;REVS&quot; was a Formula 3 sim that delivered a semi-realistic driving experience by Geoff Crammond that ran on the Commodore 64 and BBC. &quot;REVS&quot; had a big fan base in England, but not so much in the United States.

3D polygon graphics appeared in arcade racing simulators with Namco&#x27;s &quot;Winning Run&quot; (1988) and Atari&#x27;s &quot;Hard Drivin&#x27;&quot; (1989), the latter also becoming a staple on home computers, where it was one of the most widely played simulators up to that point. During the late 1980s to early 1990s, arcade racing games such as &quot;Out Run&quot; and &quot;Virtua Racing&quot; (1992) had increasingly elaborate, hydraulic motion simulator arcade cabinets, with arcade racers such as &quot;Virtua Racing&quot; and &quot;Daytona USA&quot; (1993) increasingly focused on simulating the speed and thrills of racing. At the same time, arcade racing games gradually moved away from the more difficult simulation style of &quot;Pole Position&quot;. By the early 1990s, arcade racing games had less emphasis on realistic handling or physics, and more emphasis on fast-paced action, speed and thrills.

===Emergence of sim racing genre (1989–1997)===
Sim racing is generally acknowledged to have really taken off in 1989 with the introduction of Papyrus Design Group&#x27;s &quot;Indianapolis 500: The Simulation&quot;, designed by David Kaemmer and Omar Khudari on 16-bit computer hardware. The game is often generally regarded as the personal computer&#x27;s first true auto racing simulation. Unlike most other racing games at the time, &quot;Indianapolis 500&quot; attempted to simulate realistic physics and telemetry, such as its portrayal of the relationship between the four contact patches and the pavement, as well as the loss of grip when making a high-speed turn, forcing the player to adopt a proper racing line and believable throttle-to-brake interaction. It also featured a garage facility to allow players to enact modifications to their vehicle, including adjustments to the tires, shocks and wings. With &quot;Indy 500&quot;, players could race the full , where even a blowout after would take the player out of the competition. The simulation sold over 200,000 copies. It was around this time that sim racing began distinguishing itself from arcade-style racing. Consoles saw the release of Human Entertainment&#x27;s &quot;Fastest 1&quot; for the Sega Mega Drive/Genesis in 1991. It was considered the most realistic Formula 1 racing simulation up until that time.

In 1991, Namco released the arcade game &quot;Mitsubishi Driving Simulator&quot;, co-developed with Mitsubishi. It was a serious educational street driving simulator that used 3D polygon technology and a sit-down arcade cabinet to simulate realistic driving, including basics such as ensuring the car is in neutral or parking position, starting the engine, placing the car into gear, releasing the hand-brake, and then driving. The player can choose from three routes while following instructions, avoiding collisions with other vehicles or pedestrians, and waiting at traffic lights; the brakes are accurately simulated, with the car creeping forward after taking the foot off the brake until the hand-brake is applied. &quot;Leisure Line&quot; magazine considered it the &quot;hit of the show&quot; upon its debut at the 1991 JAMMA show. It was designed for use by Japanese driving schools, with a very expensive cost of AU$150,000 or per unit.

The next major milestone was the 1992 release of &quot;Formula One Grand Prix&quot; (AKA &quot;World Circuit&quot; in some markets) by MicroProse, also developed by Geoff Crammond. This moved the genre along significantly. Multiplayer was made possible by allowing different drivers to take turns, and racers could also hook up their machines for racing via a null modem cable. This only allowed two drivers to race. Leagues emerged where drivers would submit records of their single player races to compare with other drivers. This is the first sim in which drafting/slip streaming was possible.

Papyrus followed up Indy 500 with &quot;IndyCar Racing&quot; in 1993 and F1GP was surpassed in all areas. Papyrus later released more tracks and a final expansion included the Indianapolis track plus a paintkit. Now drivers could easily customize their cars. &quot;IndyCar Racing&quot; sold around 300,000 copies. The first variant of Papyrus&#x27; &quot;NASCAR Racing&quot; series was launched in 1994. In SVGA (640×480) it pushed the PCs of the time to the limit. Suddenly a resolution of 320×200 seemed a poor option and &quot;NASCAR Racing&quot; was the race sim of choice for anyone with a capable PC, particularly in North America. It was the first sim where cars no longer looked like boxes. It keyed in on sophisticated physics modeling. &quot;NASCAR Racing&quot; sold over one million units. Moreover, the first real online racing started with &quot;NASCAR Racing&quot; using the &quot;Hawaii&quot; dial-in servers and it was not uncommon for these early sim racers to have $300 to $1500 phone bills. Online racing had seen its first true realization, and to many, this was the dawn of &quot;real&quot; sim racing.

1995 saw the release of &quot;IndyCar Racing II&quot;, updating the first version with the new NASCAR graphics engine. A year later, MicroProse released the successor to F1GP, &quot;Grand Prix 2&quot;, to much anticipation. &quot;GP2&quot; became successful not just because of its detailed and thorough simulation of the 1994 Formula 1 season, but also because it was customizable; this was achievable by way of the online community. Players could change everything about the game: drivers, teams, graphics, physics, car shapes, and eventually even the racetracks. Offline leagues reached their peak with &quot;GP2&quot; in 1998.

In 1996, &quot;NASCAR Racing 2&quot; was released, further improving the original, and the number of sim racers exploded. The TEN multiplayer hosting service was introduced and went live in November 1997 with the backing of NASCAR and the online sim racing community grew. In 1997, &quot;Gran Turismo&quot; was released for the PlayStation. It was considered the most realistic racing simulation for consoles at the time, featuring a wealth of meticulous tuning options and an open-ended career mode where players had to undertake driving tests to acquire driving licenses, earn their way into races and choose their own career path. It introduced the racing simulation genre to home consoles, becoming the basis for all modern racing simulations on video game consoles.

===Graphics accelerator era (1997–2002)===
Graphics accelerator cards brought a new level of realism to the graphics and physics of sim racing games. These new graphics processing units provided texture mapping, antialiasing, particle effects (i.e. fog, rain and snow), HDR and the capability to perform polygonal calculations faster, while taking the load off of the main processor. &quot;F1 Racing Simulation&quot; by Ubisoft, was among the first to utilize the new technology in 1997.

After years of development, Microprose released &quot;Grand Prix 3&quot;, which used a more modern graphics engine and featured the same customizable structure of &quot;GP2&quot;. However, &quot;GP3&quot; was not as well received as its predecessor due to a lack of full online multiplayer and the fact it was based on the same, outdated graphics engine as GP2. However, because of the graphical and physical similarities between the two games, the game was popular with modders who were able to port mod tracks and cars directly into GP3.

Another milestone in sim racing came in 1998 with the release of Papyrus’ &quot;Grand Prix Legends&quot;, which was based on 1967 F1 season. It was hailed as outstanding in all areas, especially in its physics and sound design. For many players, their first real experience of sim racing was through GPL or one of its many derivatives, such as NASCAR Racing 2003. The release of a groundbreaking third-party add-on for GPL, VROC (Virtual Racers Online Connection), allowed players to join online and race in leagues.

Despite its age, &quot;GPL&quot; has remained a common benchmark for Racing Sims even in the modern era thanks to a strong community who continue creating new content for the game to this very day. Modding teams even managed to further improve on the game&#x27;s physics and create third-Party expansions for following seasons, such as the 1969 season.

Wired magazine wrote an in-depth article about racing sims called Hard Drive in their February 1997 issue. In 1997, TORCS was released. Uniquely for Racing Sims, it was open source, making it even easier for modding teams to add new features and even create whole new games (Such as the TORCS-Based Speed Dreams)

Sega AM2&#x27;s 1999 arcade game &quot;Ferrari F355 Challenge&quot;, later ported to the Dreamcast in 2000, was considered the most accurate simulation of the Ferrari F355 possible up until that time; its focus on realism was considered unusual for an arcade game at the time.

Since &quot;Grand Prix Legends&quot;, its publisher Image Space Incorporated has produced its own sims such as &quot;Sports Car GT&quot; in 1999 and the officially-licensed &quot;F1&quot; series starting in 2000, all published by Electronic Arts. Unlike the Papyrus sims, the physics are easily modified, and many communities have been founded with the sole purpose of improving and updating MotorEngine-based games. One such community, Simbin, have created their own company and have released several games themselves, including &quot;GTR – FIA GT Racing Game&quot;, &quot;GT Legends&quot;, &quot;GTR 2&quot;, &quot;RACE – The Official WTCC Game&quot;, &quot;RACE 07&quot;, &quot;STCC – The Game&quot;, &quot;GTR Evolution&quot;, &quot;Race On&quot; and the Free-to-Play &quot;RaceRoom Racing Experience&quot;.

===Further developments (2003–present)===
In 2003, a 3-man team began developing &quot;Live for Speed&quot;. Phase 2 brought in many updates, including the first real cars (the BMW Sauber F1 car being included in those). The third phase of the content release cycle was launched in 2015, announcing the VW Scirocco and featuring the first real-world circuit, the Rockingham Motor Speedway.

In 2004, rally fans received the first true rally sim with Richard Burns Rally, which to this day is still recognised by its community as the best rally sim available. Much like most sims from the graphic accelerator and modern era, the game is highly modifiable and has many third-party mods that introduce anything from new cars to new physics.

In 2005, Image Space Incorporated released &quot;rFactor&quot;, a highly modifiable sim based on their Motor2 physics engine. Notable for its initial download-only distribution model, &quot;rFactor&quot; originally released with fictional cars and tracks. Thanks to its enthusiastic and ongoing modding community, the game has remained as one of the best racing sims around.

In 2006, SimBin Studios released &quot;GTR 2&quot; (itself a sequel to &quot;GTR – FIA GT Racing Game&quot;), a sports car racing simulator developed with input from the actual racing teams which took part in the FIA GT Championship 2003 / 2004 seasons. It has received widespread acclaim and has been noted for its high levels of technical and driving realism with regards to sports car racing.

In 2006, Kunos Simulazioni released &quot;netKar Pro&quot;, a new version of &quot;netKar&quot; which aimed to bring together highly accurate physics and sound modeling as well as DirectX 9 graphics. Development tools for modifying &quot;NKP&quot; were announced, although the game is now considered obsolete due to the release company&#x27;s other sim, &quot;Assetto Corsa&quot;.

In 2008, David Kaemmer, co-founder of the now-defunct Papyrus, released &quot;iRacing&quot;, a multiplayer-oriented simulator run on a subscription model.

In 2010, Kunos Simulazioni started developing &quot;Assetto Corsa&quot;, a sim built on experience gained from &quot;netKar Pro&quot; and &quot;Ferrari Virtual Academy&quot; but with an entirely new engine. The new engine was designed to provide extensive and detailed tools for modding, allowing players to create highly detailed content with minimal effort. It was released on Windows through Steam&#x27;s Early Access program in November 2013, with the full version releasing in December 2014.

In 2012, ISI launched the open beta of &quot;rFactor2&quot;. It went out of beta in 2013 mostly unfinished, and was met with backlash from players. In 2016 however Studio 397 took over development of rFactor2 with the aim to revamp and revive the title, making huge efforts to bring the series back to its prime with extensive customisation and detailed physics.

In 2013, Sector3 Studios (formerly SimBin) released &quot;RaceRoom&quot;, a &quot;freemium&quot; simulator for Microsoft Windows where players can expand the default cars with packs from major world championships, such as GT WC.
Around this time, Eugene Cojocar of Exotypos also released &quot;X Motor Racing&quot;. Also in 2013, the first direct-drive wheel was released commercially.

In 2015, Slightly Mad Studios launched &quot;Project CARS&quot; for Windows, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One. The game was unique in that it was Crowdfunded, CARS standing for &quot;Community Assisted Racing Simulator&quot;.

In 2016, Brazil&#x27;s Reiza Studios released &quot;Automobilista&quot;, a racing simulator featuring, among others, Formula Truck racing, Rallycross and some lesser known Brazilian racing classes. The game was based on their well-known &quot;Stock Car Extreme&quot;, which was again based on the ISI Motor2 Engine.

In 2017, &quot;Project CARS 2&quot; was launched by Slightly Mad Studios. It was the successor to &quot;Project CARS&quot; and used suggestions from the community to help improve upon the previous version, introducing features such as Rallycross, improved graphics and more.

In May 2019, Kunos Simulazioni launched &quot;Assetto Corsa Competizione&quot;, the spiritual successor to their wildly successful &quot;Assetto Corsa&quot;. The game aims to provide an accurate simulation of GT3 Racing and uses the official license for the Blancpain GT Endurance Series as well as Unreal Engine 4 for vastly improved graphics.

In March 2020 Reiza Studios released &quot;Automobilista 2&quot;, a successor to their popular &quot;Automobilista&quot;. The game features many cars from old F1 cars to trucks. The game also features both real and fictional tracks, many of the real tracks like Jerez and others get laser-scanned for a perfect recreation of the track. The game uses the madness engine, the same one used for &quot;Project CARS 2&quot;.

===Relation to professional drivers===
Following the cancellation of part of the 2020 Formula 1 season due to the COVID-19 pandemic, many F1 drivers such as George Russell, Lando Norris and Alexander Albon took part in &quot;Virtual Grand Prix&quot;, using the online features of the official game.

In his free time, four-time and current Formula One World Champion Max Verstappen enjoys sim racing. Having taken part in many sim racing competitions, Verstappen stated that it helps him with his real life racing, keeping him &quot;ready to go&quot;. Verstappen is a member of &quot;Team Redline&quot;; a multinational sim racing team.

===Online communities===
In recent years as international interest has grown, so has the online community and underground racing circuit. These communities act as a focal point for users around the world to engage with one another co-ordinate racing schedules, exchange modded cars, tracks, discuss hardware configurations and facilitate other communications. Also the topic of E-Sports is ever growing in the sim racing community.

==Ranked multiplayer==

Some racing games have introduced a multiplayer driver ranking system for organizing online racing. There are usually two orthogonal types of driver rankings, one which ranks drivers according to how safe they are on track and with respect to other drivers in avoiding incidents, and one according to how fast they are. For the driver speed rating, an Elo rating system is typically used, as a form of matchmaking to group together drivers of similar skills. The safety rating instead is typically used as a form of licence which is required to access some classes of races.

Sim racing games that include some form of ranked online racing are &quot;iRacing&quot; (with iRating and safety rating), &quot;Gran Turismo Sport&quot; (with Driver Class and Sportsmanship Points), &quot;Project CARS 2&quot; (Racecraft Ranking and Skill Rating), &quot;RaceRoom&quot; (with Reputation Rating and Rating), &quot;Gran Turismo 7&quot;, and &quot;Assetto Corsa Competizione&quot;. Other sims have similar systems under development, like &quot;Automobilista 2&quot; and &quot;rFactor 2&quot;.

=== Esports ===

The ranked games and sims also include an esports division that shows off the high caliber drivers in each sim. Some sims have both special events and championships series that put those drivers on the big stage.

==== &quot;Assetto Corsa Competizione&quot; ====
During the 2022 FIA Motorsport Games, &quot;Assetto Corsa Competizione&quot; was used for the events discipline titled Esports Cup. The race was contested with GT3-spec cars.

==== &quot;iRacing&quot; ====
&quot;iRacing&quot; is home of the eNascar Coca-Cola iRacing Series, Porsche TAG Heuer Esports Supercup, World of Outlaws series, and more. The Coca-Cola series competes for 20 races in the 2023 season for a total purse of $300,000 with $100,000 going to the champion. Live broadcasts are featured on Twitch, YouTube and Facebook.

==== &quot;Gran Turismo 7&quot; ====
In 2023, &quot;Gran Turismo 7&quot; hosted the Olympic Esports Series, and was sanctioned by Fédération Internationale de l&#x27;Automobile.

==== Rennsport ====
In 2023, German esports organizer ESL announced a new sim racing competition in collaboration with the new sim racing platform Rennsport. The championship, consisting of 2 separate seasons in 2023, offers a total prize money of €500,000.

==== &quot;F1 Sim Racing&quot; ====
F1 Esports, renamed to F1 Sim Racing in 2023, was founded in 2017 and is annually hosted on F1&#x27;s official games during several shows in the late year. They have a current prize fund of $750,000 and all ten teams from the real-life Formula One championship select three drivers to represent them, with two of those drivers participating in select races. Brendon Leigh won the first two championships, while current champion Frederik Rasmussen holds the record for the most wins and poles in the series.

=== Mercedes-AMG ===
In August 2024, Mercedes-AMG recognized &quot;Assetto Corsa Competizione&quot;, &quot;iRacing&quot;, and &quot;Gran Turismo 7&quot; as simulators for the Mercedes-AMG GT3 race car, and holds a competition for sim racers to win a chance to test drive the Mercedes-AMG GT3 race car.

<text>Vasile Stoica (, also known as Basil Stoica; January 1, 1889 – July 27, 1959) was a Romanian political writer, diplomat, and close assistant of European statesmen Tomáš Masaryk and Ion I.C. Brătianu.

==Early life and education==
Stoica was born in a family that originated from Transylvania (then in the Hungarian half of Austria-Hungary, but now in Romania); according to his birth certificate, Vasile Stoica was born in Avrig on January 1, 1889. He was the son of Maria and Gheorghe Stoica, Romanians belonging to the Christian Orthodox faith. He attended elementary school in Avrig.

His interest for the politics is proved by his status as one of the members of the Romanian National Party of Transylvania and Banat, from 1909.

From September the same year, Vasile Stoica followed the courses of Literature at Budapest University, until 1913; two semesters at University of Paris Faculty of Letters. In October 1913, he became president of the cultural organization of the &quot;Petru Maior&quot; ethnic Romanians undergraduates in Budapest.

==World War I==
Upon Austria-Hungary&#x27;s declaration of war on Serbia that led to the outbreak of World War I, Vasile Stoica was a teacher. In August–September, Stoica worked as a &quot;redactor-answerable&quot; at &quot;Românul&quot;, the leading Romanian language newspaper in Austria-Hungary. In October 1914, he choose to leave the Empire to avoid conscription, and headed for Bucharest, in still-neutral Romania.

He tried to work for the Romanian Army, in the new Air Force, but he was rejected. He carried on his activity of publicist to the newspapers &quot;Adevărul&quot;, &quot;Universul&quot;, &quot;Flacăra&quot;, &quot;Naționalul&quot;. Meanwhile, he abnegated his Austro-Hungarian citizenship for the Romanian one. At the Congress of Romanians refugees to Romania, in March 1915, Stoica stated that &quot;the desire to be a part of a great and free Romania is not the result of the context&quot;. The introduction to the book &quot;Habsburgii, ungurii și românii&quot; (&quot;The Habsburgs, the Hungarians and Romanians&quot;), dated May 1, written by Vasile Stoica and Ion Rusu Abrudeanu. The authors plead for Romanian intervention against Austria-Hungary. In August, Stoica lead the Congress of the undergraduates in Galaţi. He published another, more radical book, &quot;Suferințele din Ardeal&quot; (&quot;Sufferings in Transylvania&quot;), in Bucharest in the summer of 1916. The young author’s book is a &quot;&quot;declaration of war&quot; against Austria-Hungary. In June, an Austro-Hungarian Army court-martial in Cluj sentenced him to death &quot;in absentia&quot;.

At the end of August 1916, the Romanian government, impressed by the early success of the Brusilov Offensive, declared war on Germany and Austria-Hungary. King Ferdinand’s &quot;Proclamation&quot; to the Army, drafted by Stoica along with the proclamation for the Romanian public opinion, read:
:&quot;You will fight alongside the great nations we are united with. Bloody battles are waiting you, but bravely enduring their hardness and with God’s help the victory will be ours&quot;&quot;.

He subsequently fought in the Romanian Army against invading German forces in Oltenia, and followed the Romanian troops in their retreat to Moldavia. In March 1917, Stoica (by then a second lieutenant) was a member of a group of exiled Romanian Habsburg subjects who were sent as a delegation to the United States to campaign Romania&#x27;s cause. The envoys also established close contacts with the Czech Tomáš Masaryk and the Polish Ignacy Jan Paderewski.

He was instrumental in the creation of the &quot;Romanian National League of America&quot; in July, some months after America joined the Entente forces; among other things, the &quot;League&quot;, centered in Youngstown, Ohio, helped direct the war effort and participation of the Romanian-American community towards the US forces on the Western Front.

Stephen P. Duggan wrote on December 10, 1920:
: &quot;He has been over every part of [the United States]. He has come in contact with university professors, financiers, industrialists, [and Romanian-Americans]. He has made a district success wherever he went, as much a social success as an official success. It will take a new man a long time to learn as much as Captain Stoica and to secure the confidence of Americans in the way he has. Because of my official position, I have come during the war period, in contact with the representatives of all the foreign nations, and no one of them has impressed more favourably than Captain Stoica&quot;.

==Personal life==
Vasile Stoica married Ines (Nessy) Longhi de Sobione. Born January 21, 1898 in Parma, Italy, she came to Romania in 1927. Their marriage ended in divorce sometime prior to 1940. Ines Longhi died on February 16, 1956 while married to her second husband, Carol Ardeleanu (né Köhler), an ethnic German from Transylvania.

==Postwar imprisonment under Communist rule==
He was imprisoned from 1948 to 1954 and in 1957 was arrested again and sentenced to 10 years in prison. He died in Jilava Prison in 1959.

<text>The Japan Rugby Football Union (JRFU; ) is the governing body for rugby union in Japan. It was formed 30 November 1926, and organises matches for the Japan national team.

The JRFU is currently one of only two federations from outside the Six Nations and The Rugby Championship with a seat on the executive council of World Rugby, the sport&#x27;s international governing body (the other is Rugby Canada). Former Japanese prime minister Yoshirō Mori served as the JRFU&#x27;s current president until 2015, when Tadashi Okamura took over the position.

==Historical background==


Rugby union was first introduced to Japanese students at Keio University in Japan by Professor Edward Bramwell Clarke (who was born in Yokohama) and Tanaka Ginnosuke, both graduates of Cambridge University, in 1899. It had been played at the treaty ports (Kobe and Yokohama especially) before that, between teams of long-term foreign residents and visiting ships&#x27; crews, garrisons etc.

==Tournaments and leagues sponsored==

===International===
*IRB TOSHIBA Junior World Championship 2009
*Sanix World Rugby Youth Invitational Tournament

===Domestic===
* Top League
* Microsoft Cup
* All-Japan Rugby Football Championship
* University championship rugby
* National High School Rugby Tournament

== Rugby World Cup 2011 bid ==
With Japan&#x27;s advantages of a superb infrastructure (stadiums, accommodation and transportation) and the experience of co-staging the Football World Cup 2002 with Korea, the JRFU bid to host the Rugby World Cup in 2011.

The bid&#x27;s catchphrase or slogan was &quot;Making Rugby a Truly Global Sport&quot;. So far the Rugby World Cup has never been held outside the traditional rugby strongholds of the Northern and Southern hemisphere (the countries involved in the Six Nations and Tri-Nations tournaments). In that sense, the slogan was a justified attempt to grow the game worldwide, and make it a global sport.

The JRFU gave the following reasons for holding the Rugby World Cup in Japan at a press conference held on 22 September 2004:

:1. Rugby was introduced in Japan in 1899, and has a proud history, culture and tradition developed over the past 105 years. Japan is the leading Asian rugby country, and the focal point of rugby in the region.

:2. Japan is the only Union in Asia that has participated in the last five Rugby World Cups.

:3. Japan has the 4th largest number of registered rugby union players in the world (125,508), behind only England, South Africa and France.

:4. Japan offers significant commercial opportunities through established relationships with major corporations based in Japan, including those involved in Top League.

:5. Japan has a proud record of international sporting success, highlighted most recently by its outstanding achievement at the 2004 Olympic Games that surpassed all expectations.

:6. Japan has the state of the art stadiums, infrastructure, systems, and know-how required for a major sporting event such as Rugby World Cup already largely in place, following its successful hosting of the 2002 FIFA World Cup.

:7. The Government of Japan supports the growth of the game and endorses Japan’s bid to host Rugby World Cup 2011. Former Prime Minister Yoshiro Mori, who played rugby for many years, is a keen advocate and active supporter of the bid, and a key figure in obtaining political support exercising significant influence.

:8. Japan’s hosting of the World Cup would fulfill the IRB’s goal of making rugby a truly global sport. It would increase competition and serve to narrow the existing divide between the Top Tier Nations and the Second Tier Nations for the good of the game in the long term.

However, New Zealand won the hosting rights in 2011 in a process which was later much criticised for lack of transparency as at the last minute the voting was made secret thanks to an Irish RU proposal. Reasons for JRFU not getting the cup were that the Union had never hosted a major rugby tournament before. As well as that, support for rugby in Japan was considered relatively poor, with many foreign players based in Japan commenting on the Top League&#x27;s low crowd numbers. The biggest factor in preventing Japan winning the bid was believed to be it leaving important bid details until its final presentation in Dublin. Many delegates had been instructed for whom to vote prior to the final bid presentations.

==Rugby World Cup 2019==
Having lost out to New Zealand for the 2011 World Cup, Japan put in bids for the 2015 and 2019 World Cups. On 28 July 2009, the IRB awarded them the 2019 Rugby World Cup, giving England the 2015 Rugby World Cup due to its strong financial status.

== Top League ==
In an effort to improve the overall standard of Japanese rugby, the JRFU created a new semi-professional Top League in 2003 with the season spanning 2003-04. In the second season the League was composed of the following company-sponsored teams:
*Canon Eagles
*Coca-Cola Red Sparks
*Honda Heat
*Kintetsu Liners
*Kobelco Steelers
*Kubota Spears
*NEC Green Rockets
*Nihon IBM Big Blue
*Ricoh Black Rams
*Panasonic Wild Knights
*Suntory Sungoliath
*Toshiba Brave Lupus
*Toyota Verblitz
*Yamaha Jubilo

===Top League Champions===
*2003-04 Kobelco Steelers
*2004-05 Toshiba Brave Lupus

==Microsoft Cup==
The Microsoft Cup is a knock-out tournament played between the top eight Top League teams. The winners of the first Microsoft Cup were NEC Green Rockets, who beat Toshiba Brave Lupus 24-19 on 22 February 2004. However, Toshiba won the 41st Japan Championship on 21 March 2004 when they beat Kobelco Steelers 22-10.

==All-Japan Championship (Nihon Senshuken)==
The schedule for the 42nd All-Japan Championship was as follows:

2005

<text>The Caravaggisti (or the &quot;Caravagesques&quot;; singular: &quot;Caravaggista&quot;) were stylistic followers of the late 16th-century Italian Baroque painter Caravaggio. His influence on the new Baroque style that eventually emerged from Mannerism was profound. Caravaggio never established a workshop as most other painters did, and thus had no school to spread his techniques. Nor did he ever set out his underlying philosophical approach to art, the psychological realism which can only be deduced from his surviving work. But it can be seen directly or indirectly in the work of Rubens, Jusepe de Ribera, Bernini, and Rembrandt. Famous while he lived, Caravaggio himself was forgotten almost immediately after his death. Many of his paintings were re-ascribed to his followers, such as &quot;The Taking of Christ&quot;, which was attributed to the Dutch painter Gerrit van Honthorst until 1990.

Only in the 20th century was Caravaggio&#x27;s importance to the development of Western art rediscovered. In the 1920s Roberto Longhi once more placed him in the European tradition: &quot;Ribera, Vermeer, La Tour and Rembrandt could never have existed without him. And the art of Delacroix, Courbet and Manet would have been utterly different&quot;. The influential Bernard Berenson stated: &quot;With the exception of Michelangelo, no other Italian painter exercised so great an influence.&quot;

==Italian==

===Rome===
At the height of his popularity in Rome during the late 1590s and early 1600s, Caravaggio&#x27;s dramatic new style influenced many of his peers in the Roman art world. The first Caravaggisti included Mario Minniti, Giovanni Baglione (although his Caravaggio phase was short-lived), Leonello Spada and Orazio Gentileschi. In the next generation, there were Carlo Saraceni, Bartolomeo Manfredi and Orazio Borgianni as well as anonymous masters such as the Master of the Gamblers. Gentileschi, despite being considerably older, was the only one of these artists to live much beyond 1620, and ended up as court painter to Charles I of England. His daughter Artemisia Gentileschi was also close to Caravaggio, and one of the most gifted of the movement, including the work &quot;Judith Slaying Holofernes&quot;. Yet, in Rome and in Italy, it was not Caravaggio, but the influence of Annibale Carracci, blending elements from the High Renaissance and Lombard realism, which ultimately triumphed. Other artists active in Rome, worth mentioning, include Angelo Caroselli, Pier Francesco Mola, Tommaso Salini and Francesco Buoneri. Giacinto Brandi was active mainly in Rome and Naples. Dutch painter David de Haen was active in Rome between 1615 and 1622. Bartolomeo Cavarozzi was active in Rome, but worked in Madrid from 1617 to 1618-19, and is believed to have played a role in spreading Caravaggism in Spain.

===Naples===
In May 1606 after the killing of Ranuccio Tomassoni, Caravaggio fled to Naples with a death sentence on his head. While there he completed several commissions, two major ones being the &quot;Madonna of the Rosary&quot;, and &quot;The Seven Works of Mercy&quot;. His work had a profound effect on the local artists and his brief stay in Naples produced a notable school of Neapolitan Caravaggisti, including Battistello Caracciolo, Bernardo Cavallino, Carlo Sellitto, Massimo Stanzione, Francesco Guarino, Mattia Preti, Andrea Vaccaro, Cesare Fracanzano and Antonio de Bellis. Giacinto Brandi was active mainly in Rome and Naples. The Caravaggisti movement there ended with a terrible outbreak of plague in 1656, but at the time Naples was a possession of Spain and the influence of Caravaggism had already spread there.

===Northern Italy===
Marco Antonio Bassetti is known to have been in Rome in 1616, and may have arrived there two years earlier. In Rome he came under the influence of the paintings of Caravaggio and Orazio Borgianni. On his return to Verona he painted a St. Peter and Saints for the church of San Tomaso and a Coronation of the Virgin for Sant&#x27; Anastasia. He died from the plague in Verona in 1630.

Bernardo Strozzi, born and mainly active in Genoa and later Venice, is considered a principal founder of the Venetian Baroque style. In the 1620s Strozzi gradually abandoned his early Mannerist style in favor of a more personal style characterized by a new naturalism derived from the work of Caravaggio and his followers. The Caravaggist style of painting had been brought to Genoa both by Domenico Fiasella, after his return from Rome in 1617–18, and by followers of Caravaggio who spent time working in the city.

Italian painter Biagio Manzoni was active in Faenza. Italian painter Bartolomeo Schedoni from Reggio Emilia, Daniele Crespi from Milan and Luca Cambiasi, also known as Luca Cambiaso and Luca Cangiagio, the leading artist in Genoa in the 16th century, often depicted brilliantly lit figures set against a dark background. Felice Boselli, active in Piacenza, used contrast Caravaggisti lighting for his still-lifes. Tanzio da Varallo (or simply il Tanzio) was active mainly in Lombardy and Piedmont, including the Sacro Monte at Varallo Sesia, where he worked contemporaneously with Pier Francesco Mazzucchelli (il Morazzone). The Italian painter and engraver Bernardino Mei worked in his native Siena and in Rome, finding patronage above all in the Chigi family.

===Central Italy===
Pietro Ricchi (or il Lucchesino), born in Lucca, also often depicted brilliantly lit figures set against a dark background (see St. Sebastian).

===Sicily===
Mario Minniti was an Italian artist active in Sicily after 1606. He, at the age of 16, even posed for Caravaggio&#x27;s painting &quot;Boy with a Basket of Fruit&quot;.

==Flemish==

Rubens was likely one of the first Flemish artists to be influenced by Caravaggio. During the period 1600–1608, Rubens resided in Italy. He settled in Mantua at the court of Duke Vincenzo I Gonzaga but also spent time in Rome. During his stay in Rome in 1601 he became acquainted with Caravaggio’s work. He later made a copy of Caravaggio&#x27;s &quot;Entombment of Christ&quot; and recommended his patron, the Duke of Mantua, to purchase &quot;The Death of the Virgin&quot; (Louvre). Rubens was after his return to Antwerp instrumental in the acquisition of Caravagio&#x27;s &quot;Madonna of the Rosary&quot; (Kunsthistorisches Museum, Vienna) for the St. Paul&#x27;s Church in Antwerp. During his stay in Italy Rubens broadened his interest in Caravaggio’s work to include the 1606 &quot;Supper at Emmaus in Milan&quot; (Pinacoteca di Brera) and the 1600 &quot;The Calling of St Matthew&quot; as well as the more recent work in the Santa Maria in Vallicella and the Basilica of Sant&#x27;Agostino. Although some of this interest in Caravaggio is reflected in his drawings during his Italian residence, it was only after his return to Antwerp in 1608 that his works show openly Caravaggesque traits such as in the &quot;Cain slaying Abel&quot; (1608–1609) (Courtauld Institute of Art). However, the influence of Caravaggio on Rubens’ work would be less important than that of Raphael, Correggio, Barocci and the Venetians. Artists, who were influenced by Rubens, such as Pieter van Mol, Gaspar de Crayer and Willem Jacob Herreyns, also used certain stark realism and strong contrasts of light and shadow, common to Caravaggisti style.

Rubens&#x27; contemporary Abraham Janssens was another Flemish painter who travelled to Italy (from 1597 to 1602) where he became acquainted with the work of Caravaggio. His work after his return to Antwerp shows the influence of Caravaggio. The composition &quot;Scaldis and Antwerpia&quot; of 1609 derives its expressive power from the use of strong contrasts of light and shadow (chiaroscuro) as was pioneered by Caravaggio.

It is mainly the Flemish artists from the generation after Rubens coming on the art scene in the 1620s who were most influenced by Caravaggio. It can even be said that there was a Caravaggist craze in Flanders from about 1620 to 1640. The artists are often referred to as the Ghent Caravaggisti and the Antwerp Caravaggisti after the city in which they were principally active. There is, however, no discernible stylistic distinction between these two movements other than individual ones. Among the Ghent Caravaggisti can be listed Jan Janssens, Melchior de la Mars and Antoon van den Heuvel. The list of Antwerp Caravaggisti is significantly longer reflecting the importance of this city as the pre-eminent artistic centre of Flanders. They include Theodoor Rombouts, Gerard Seghers, Jan Cossiers, Adam de Coster, Jacques de l&#x27;Ange and Jan van Dalen. In Bruges, Jacob van Oost painted genre and history paintings showing the influence of the work of Caravaggio and Manfredi whose work he had studied in Rome. Some Flemish Caravaggisti left their homeland for Italy where they were influenced by the work of Caravaggio and his followers and never returned home. This is the case of Louis Finson of Bruges who after stays in Naples and Rome spent most of his career in France. Another example of an expatriate Flemish Caravaggist is Hendrick de Somer of Lokeren or Lochristi who spent most of his life and career in Naples where he painted in a Caraviggist style influenced by the Spanish painter Jusepe de Ribera.

What most of these artists shared in common is that they likely visited Italy where they had first-hand contact with the work of Caravaggio or his Italian and Dutch followers. The influence of Caravaggio and his followers on their work can be seen in the use of dramatic light effects and expressive gestures as well as the new subject matter such as card sharps, fortune tellers, the denial of St Peter, etc. Some of the artists focused on certain aspects of Caravaggio&#x27;s oeuvre. For instance, Adam de Coster was referred to as the &quot;Pictor Noctium&quot; (painter of the nights) because of his preference for the use of stark chiaroscuro and the repeated motif of half-length figures illuminated by a candle which is covered.

Many of these artists such as Rombouts, Cossiers and Seghers later abandoned their strict adherence to the Caravaggist style and subject matter and struck out in different directions often under the influence of the older generation of Flemish artists who had such a dominant influence on Flemish art in the 17th century, i.e. Rubens and van Dyck.

==Dutch==

In the first three decades of the 17th century, some Catholic artists from the city of Utrecht in the Dutch Republic travelled to Rome where they were profoundly influenced by the work of Caravaggio and his followers. The first of these artists to arrive was Hendrick ter Brugghen (first recorded in Italy in 1607) followed later by Gerrit van Honthorst, Dirck van Baburen and Jan van Bijlert. On their return to Utrecht, their Caravaggesque works inspired a short-lived but influential flowering of artworks inspired indirectly in style and subject matter by the works of Caravaggio and the Italian followers of Caravaggio. This style or school of painting was later referred to as Utrecht Caravaggism. The brief flourishing of Utrecht Caravaggism ended around 1630, when major artists had either died, as in the case of van Baburen and Terbrugghen, or had changed style, like van Honthorst&#x27;s shift to [[portrait painting|portraiture] and history scenes informed by the [[Flemish Baroque painting|Flemish]] tendencies popularized by [[Peter Paul Rubens|Rubens]] and his followers. In the following generation the effects of Caravaggio, although attenuated, are to be seen in the work of [[Vermeer]], [[Rembrandt Harmenszoon van Rijn|Rembrandt]], and [[Gerrit Dou]]&#x27;s &quot;niche paintings&quot;.

==French==
One of the first [[France|French]] artists to studio in Rome during the Caravaggio Years was [[Jean LeClerc (painter)|Jean LeClerc]], who studied under Saraceni during the early 17th century. [[Simon Vouet]] spent an extensive period of time in Italy, from 1613 to 1627. His patrons included the [[Barberini family]], [[Cassiano dal Pozzo]], [[Paolo Giordano II Orsini|Paolo Giordano Orsini]] and [[Vincenzo Giustiniani]]. He also visited other parts of Italy: [[Venice]]; [[Bologna]], (where the [[The Carracci|Carracci family]] had their academy); [[Genoa]], (where from 1620 to 1622, he worked for the [[Doria (family)|Doria princes]]); and Naples. He absorbed what he saw and distilled it in his painting: Caravaggio&#x27;s dramatic lighting; Italian Mannerism; [[Paolo Veronese]]&#x27;s color and &quot;[[di sotto in su]]&quot; or foreshortened perspective; and the art of [[Annibale Carracci|Carracci]], [[Guercino]], [[Giovanni Lanfranco|Lanfranco]] and [[Guido Reni]]. Vouet&#x27;s success in Rome led to his election as president of the [[Accademia di San Luca]] in 1624. Despite his success in Rome, Vouet returned to France in 1627. Vouet&#x27;s new style was distinctly Italian, importing the Italian Baroque style into France. Other French artists enamored by the new style included [[Valentin de Boulogne]], who was living in Rome by 1620, and studied under Vouet and later Boulognes pupil [[Nicolas Tournier]].

[[Georges de La Tour]] is assumed to have travelled either to Italy or the Netherlands early in his career. His paintings reflect the influence of Caravaggio, but this probably reached him through the Dutch &quot;Caravaggisti&quot; and other Northern ([[List of French artists|French]] and [[List of Dutch painters|Dutch]]) contemporaries. In particular, La Tour is often compared to the Dutchman [[Hendrick Terbrugghen]]. [[Louis Finson]], also known as Ludovicus Finsonius, was a Flemish Baroque painter, who also worked in France.

==Spanish==
[[Francisco Ribalta]] became among the first followers in [[Spanish Golden Age|Spain]] of the [[Tenebrism|tenebrist]] style. It is unclear if he directly visited either [[Rome]] or [[Naples]], where Caravaggio&#x27;s style had many adherents, although through its Naples connection Spain was probably already exposed to Caravaggisim by the early 17th century. His son [[Juan Ribalta]], [[Vicente Castelló]] and [[Jusepe de Ribera]] are said to have been his pupils, although it is entirely possible that Ribera acquired his tenebrism when he moved to Italy. The style garnered a number of adherents in Spain, and was to influence the Baroque or [[Golden Age]] Spanish painters, especially [[Zurbarán]], [[Diego Velázquez|Velázquez]] and [[Bartolomé Esteban Murillo|Murillo]]. Even the art of still life in Spain, the [[bodegón]] was often painted in a similar stark and austere style. [[Orazio Borgianni]] signed a petition to begin an Italianate academy of painting in Spain and executed a series of nine paintings for the Convento de Portacoeli, Valladolid, where they remain. [[Giovanni Battista Crescenzi]] was an Italian painter and architect of the early-Baroque period, active in Rome and Spain, where he helped decorate the pantheon of the Spanish kings at El Escorial. He rose to prominence as an artist during the reign of Pope Paul V, but by 1617 had moved to Madrid, and from 1620 on, he was active in El Escorial. Philip III of Spain awarded him the title of Marchese de la Torre, Knight of Santiago. His pupil [[Bartolomeo Cavarozzi]] was active in Spain 1617–19.

<doc id="787671" wikidata="Q6991105" url="?curid=787671" title="Nemesio Canales">
<text>Nemesio Canales (December 18, 1878 – September 14, 1923) was a Puerto Rican essayist, journalist, novelist, playwright, politician and activist who defended women&#x27;s civil rights. As a politician, he presented a bill to the Puerto Rico House of Representatives, which was defeated 23 votes to 7, giving women their full civil rights, including the right to vote.

==Early years==
Canales (birth name: Nemesio Rosario Canales Rivera) was born on December 18, 1878, in Jayuya. He was the firstborn of Rosario Canales Quintero and Francisca Rivera Rivera. He received his primary and secondary education in schools in Utuado and Jayuya. One of these schools was Colegio Roselló, established in Utuado by Juan Luis Roselló in 1867. Canales continued his higher educational studies in the Liceo of Mayagüez where he earned a bachelor&#x27;s degree (now equivalent to High School). In 1896, Canales went to Spain and enrolled in the University of Zaragoza to study medicine and law. In 1898, when the United States declared war against Spain, Canales abandoned his studies and went to Baltimore, where he enrolled in Baltimore&#x27;s College of Law in 1903.

==Political activist==
Upon his return to Puerto Rico he went to live in the city of Ponce, where he co-founded the daily newspaper paper &quot;El Día&quot;. and married Guarina Díaz Baldorioty, the granddaughter of Román Baldorioty de Castro. In Ponce, Canales joined the law firm of Luis Lloréns Torres. Like so many lawyers of the time, he wrote poetry of patriotic themes, collaborated as a journalist and took an active interest in politics. He served in the House of Representatives of Puerto Rico as a member of the Unionist Party, which promoted economic progress of the working class. In 1909, Canales presented a bill to the House giving women their full civil rights, including the right to vote, which was defeated 23 votes to 7. He also served as a lecturer in the School of Law of the University of Puerto Rico.

==Writer==
Canales co-founded with Luis Lloréns Torres, the &quot;Revista de las Antillas&quot;. He also wrote short novels and a comedy called &quot;El Heroe Galopante&quot; (&quot;The Run Away Hero&quot;), which debuted on stage in 1923 after his death. In 1914, he bought Ponce&#x27;s &quot;El Día&quot; newspaper (which later became &quot;El Nuevo Día&quot;). In his newspaper he had a column in which he wrote his &quot;Paliques&quot;, in which he showed his understanding of human nature with humor and insight. In his works, he makes an emphasis of the pride that he feels for all things Puerto Rican. A collection of his &quot;Paliques&quot; was published in 1913. Some of his other works include the novels &quot;Hacía Un Lejano Sol&quot;, &quot;Mi Volutad Se Ha Muerto&quot; and &quot;La Leyenda Benaventina&quot;. Canales presentes many lectures, including some in Argentina, Peru, Uruguay, Panama, and Venezuela.

==Death==
On September 14, 1923, Nemesio Canales was on board the steamer &quot;San Lorenzo&quot; bound for New York City with the intention of going to Washington, D.C., as a legal assistant to a legislative Puerto Rican commission when he died. He was buried at the Santa María Magdalena de Pazzis Cemetery.

===Reburial===
In August 2011, Jayuya mayor Georgie González petitioned San Juan mayor Jorge Santini to exhume Canales&#x27; body to be interred in Jayuya, to which the latter accepted. Canales&#x27; body was exhumed from the Santa María Magdalena de Pazzis Cemetery in the Old San Juan and taken to the Canales Family Residence Museum, where he was interred beside the house the same day. A message written by Nemesio Canales during his lifetime is inscribed on his new tomb, which reads:
==Legacy==
Puerto Rico awards the Nemesio Canales Award in Literature every year to outstanding young writers, and has named a public housing project in San Juan named after him. His native town, Jayuya, erected a statue in his honor, sculpted by well-known Puerto Rican sculptor Tomás Batista, and named the town square after him. Jayuya also converted the house in which Nemesio and his sister were raised into a museum. In Ponce, he is honored at the Illustrious Ponce Citizens Plaza in the Tricentennial Park.

==Notable family members== 
His younger sister, Blanca Canales Torresola, was a leader of the Puerto Rican Nationalist Party which was presided by Pedro Albizu Campos. In October 30, 1950, she led the Jayuya Uprising revolt against United States colonial rule. Her cousins were Elio Torresola, Griselio Torresola one of two Puerto Rican nationalists who attempted to assassinate United States President Harry Truman and Doris Torresola, all high-ranking members of the party involved in the Puerto Rican Nationalist Party Revolts of the 1950s.

<doc id="787673" wikidata="Q1722535" url="?curid=787673" title="Kalmar Nyckel">
<text>was a Swedish ship built by the Dutch famed for carrying Swedish settlers to North America in 1638, to establish the colony of New Sweden. The name comes from the Swedish city of Kalmar and meaning in Swedish. The name was also a tribute to Kalmar Castle which was a symbol of power during the time of the Swedish Empire when Sweden was a military great power. A replica of the ship was launched at Wilmington, Delaware, in 1997.

== History ==
 was constructed in about 1625, and was of a design called a pinnace. The ship was originally named , and to distinguish it from several other ships called &quot;Key&quot; it was known by the name of the city of Kalmar, which purchased the ship in 1629, as its contribution to a state-sponsored trading company, . It was later purchased into the Swedish Navy. When Sweden decided to establish a trading colony in the New World under the direction of Peter Minuit, was chosen for the voyage. A smaller vessel, , accompanied her.

The ships sailed from Gothenburg in December 1637, commanded by Jan Hindriksen van der Water, but encountered a severe storm in the North Sea and had to divert to the Netherlands for repairs. They departed on New Year&#x27;s Day 1638, arriving in North America in March 1638. They built a fort on the present site of the city of Wilmington, which they named Fort Christina.

A second voyage, which departed on February7, 1640, and arrived at Fort Christina on April17, brought additional settlers for New Sweden. One of them was Reorus Torkillus, the first Lutheran clergyman in New Sweden. The made four successful round trips from Sweden to North America, a record unchallenged by any other colonial vessel.

Between colonial voyages, the ship was used by the navy as a transport and courier. She was sold out of Swedish service to Dutch merchants in 1651. At the outbreak of the First Anglo-Dutch War, she was employed as a fisheries protection vessel under Captain Dirk Vijgh. The ship was sunk off the coast of Scotland in action against Blake&#x27;s squadron on July12, 1652.
== Modern replica ==

In 1986, a group of citizens of Wilmington, Delaware, established the &quot;Kalmar Nyckel&quot; Foundation, whose primary source of funding is from the taxpayers of the State of Delaware, plus donations from corporations and individuals. The foundation designed, built, and launched a replica of &quot;Kalmar Nyckel&quot;. The modern ship, designed by naval architects Thomas C. Gillmer and Iver Franzen, with additional help from Melbourne Smith, Joel Welter, and Ken Court, was built at a shipyard in Wilmington on the Christina River near the original 1638 Swedish settlers&#x27; landing site at Fort Christina. She was launched on September28, 1997, and commissioned on May 9, 1998. The re-creation measures on deck and overall, with a beam, a draft, and a displacement of 300 tons.

The ship is operated and maintained by a volunteer staff, under the leadership of a paid captain, boatswain, and chief mate. In November 2006, the captain of the &quot;Kalmar Nyckel&quot;, David W. Hiott, who had commanded her for nine seasons, died from the effects of recurring melanoma. Captain Lauren Morgens took over on April1, 2007, with Sharon Dounce as Port Captain/Relief Captain. Volunteers maintain the ship, run the education program, and sail her from port to port.

Since 2016, the ship has served as the official tall ship of Delaware. It was adopted as a state symbol for serving &quot;as Delaware&#x27;s seagoing ambassador both at home and at many ports of call, raising awareness of the First State for thousands who see her and come on board.&quot;

=== Ship&#x27;s cats ===

Toolbox was the senior ship&#x27;s cat and official warrant officer with the title of &#x27;Captain&#x27;s Assistant&#x27;. The offspring of a feral cat, she was born in a toolbox while the ship was under construction in 1997. She had always lived on the ship and therefore had the greatest accumulated sea time of any member of the crew. A celebrity in her own right, she is the star of two books.

Unfortunately, due to her failed eyesight, Toolbox retired from her position on &quot;Kalmar Nyckel&quot; in November 2012. A retirement party was thrown in her honor, and many past and present crew members came to celebrate her 16 years on the ship.

In addition, a number of other cats have served with &quot;Kalmar Nyckel&quot; at various times, including Clew Garnet, Lagan, Sven, Timmynocky (nautical equivalent of thingamajig) and Ditty. The last ship&#x27;s cat was called Chester, a full-grey American shorthair, who retired during the COVID pandemic, and currently lives on land with a volunteer.

== Symphony ==
In 1986, composer Benjamin Lees was commissioned to write a symphony to honor the founding of Wilmington, Delaware. Lees named the resulting work &quot;Symphony No. 5: Kalmar Nyckel&quot;. The piece was nominated for a Grammy Award in 2003, following release of a recording by the German orchestra Staatsphilharmonie Rheinland-Pfalz.

<doc id="787674" wikidata="Q1273660" url="?curid=787674" title="Schwarzbier">
<text>() is a dark lager that originated in Germany. It has an opaque, black colour with hints of chocolate or coffee flavours, and is generally around 5% ABV. It is similar to stout in that it is made from roasted malt, which gives it its dark colour.

== Characteristics ==
Schwarzbiers are made using a cool fermentation method, which classes them as lager, though historically warm fermentation was used. The alcohol content usually ranges from 4.4% to 5.4%. They get their dark colour from the use of particularly dark malts or roast malt extract in brewing. The malt, in turn, gets its colour during the roasting procedure. Its flavour may vary between bitter and slightly sweet.

== History ==

The roots of Schwarzbier lie in Thuringia and Saxony. The oldest known black beer is &quot;Braunschweiger Mumme&quot;, (&quot;Brunswick Mum&quot;) brewed since the Middle Ages (the first documented mention is from 1390 in Braunschweig. The earliest documented mention in Thuringia is of Köstritzer brewery from 1543, a brewery which later started producing Schwarzbier and still produces it today. Present-day eastern Germany has many unique varieties of this style from regional breweries.

== Examples ==
Modern Schwarzbiers include 
Köstritzer, Sprecher Black Bavarian, Samuel Adams Black Lager, New Belgium 1554 Black Lager, Shiner Black, and Xingu Black.

Dark Czech lagers range from dark to black beers (Czech &quot;tmavé&quot; and &quot;černé&quot;).

<doc id="787689" wikidata="Q2711207" url="?curid=787689" title="Chlorogalum">
<text>The common names soap plant, soaproot and amole refer to the genus Chlorogalum. They are native to western North America, with some species in Oregon but they are mostly found in California. Common names of the genus and several species derive from their use as soap.

Soap plants are perennial plants, with more or less elongated bulbs, depending on the species. The bulbs can be white or brown, and in most species have a fibrous coat. The flowers are borne on a long central stem, and appear to have six separate petals (not all are petals in the technical sense). There are six stamens, which are prominent in most species.

==Taxonomy==
The placement of the genus &quot;Chlorogalum&quot; has varied considerably. In the APG III system, followed here, it is placed in the family Asparagaceae, subfamily Agavoideae, based on molecular systematics evidence. The second edition of the Jepson Manual places the genus in Agavaceae (equivalent to the APG III subfamily Agavoideae). Until the 1980s, the genus was generally treated in the Lily family, Liliaceae, in the order Liliales, e.g. the Flora of North America, published in 1993 onwards, has &quot;Chlorogalum&quot; in Liliaceae. The genus has also been placed in its own family, Chorogalaceae, or in a group within the hyacinth family Hyacinthaceae (now Scilloideae), in the order Asparagales. In 1999, phylogenetic studies based on molecular evidence, suggested that, along with &quot;Camassia&quot;, &quot;Chlorogalum&quot; seemed to be most closely related to &quot;Agave&quot; and &quot;Anthericum&quot;.

The members of the genus with diurnal flowering and a chromosome count of 2&quot;n&quot; = 60 were placed into their own genus, &quot;Hooveria&quot; after phylogenetic molecular research showed that &quot;Chlorogalum&quot; was not monophyletic.

==Species==
Five species are currently classified in the genus. All except the Wavy-leafed Soap Plant, &quot;Chlorogalum pomeridianum&quot;, have rather restricted distributions, with little overlap. The Wavy-leafed Soap Plant, however, has a range that virtually encompasses those of all other members of the genus, and is the most common of them.
Formerly included:

* &quot;Hooveria parviflora&quot; as &quot;Chlorogalum parviflorum&quot;
* &quot;Hooveria purpurea&quot; as &quot;Chlorogalum purpureum&quot;

==Uses==

The fibers surrounding the bulb were widely used, bound together, to make small brushes. Extracts of the bulbs could also be used as a sealant or glue.
;Cleansing
At least two of the species are used for detergent properties by Native Americans and early European settlers, specifically the &quot;C. pomeridianum&quot; by tribes including Miwok, and the &quot;C. angustifolium&quot; by the Karuk people . The juices of the bulb contain saponins that form a lather when mixed with water, making the bulbs useful as a kind of soap. This is the origin of several of the plants&#x27; common names. It was particularly used for washing hair, since &quot;C. pomeridianum&quot; at least was held to be effective against dandruff.

;Cuisine
The young leaves of certain species can be used as food, but the saponins in the bulbs make these poisonous. However saponins are very poorly absorbed by the body and usually pass straight through, and in any case they can be destroyed by thorough cooking. The Miwok and Chumash people roasted and ate the bulbs as a winter food. In February 1847 Patrick Breen of the ill-fated Donner Party recorded that a Native American gave the starving settler some &quot;roots resembling Onions in shape [that] taste some like a sweet potatoe, all full of little tough fibres.&quot; Breen&#x27;s son later called the roots &quot;California soap-root&quot;—almost certainly &quot;C. pomeridianum&quot;.

Saponins are much more toxic to some other animals than they are to humans. Fish are particularly susceptible, and the bulb juices were used to kill or stun them so they could be caught easily.

;Medicinal
The bulbs also had various medicinal uses, both external (e.g., for making a poultice to be used as an antiseptic, or as a rub in cases of rheumatism) and internal (decoctions were used for a range of purposes, including as a diuretic, as a laxative and against stomachache).

;Fishing
Many of California&#x27;s Native American tribes traditionally used soaproot, or the root of various yucca species, as a fish poison. They would pulverize the roots, then mix the powder in water to create a foam, and then add the suds to a stream. This would kill, or incapacitate, the fish, which could be gathered easily from the surface of the water. Among the tribes using this technique were the Lassik, the Luiseño, and the Mattole.

<text>Alfred Stelzner (29 November 1852 – 9 July 1906) was a German composer and luthier.

Stelzner was born in the Free City of Hamburg, and educated in music, physics and mathematics. He produced string instruments of his own design in Wiesbaden and then in Dresden. Two instruments of his invention were the violotta and the cellone. The violotta is tuned an octave below the violin, and possesses a timbre between that of the viola and cello. The cellone, a large cello, is tuned between the cello and string bass. His instruments received praise and endorsements from major figures of the day, including impresario Alfred Schulz-Curtius, and the German composer Felix Draeseke composed his string quintet in A major, named the &quot;&quot;, specifically for Stelzner instruments.

Stelzner began production of his new instruments in 1889 and continued to make them until 1900. He vigorously promoted his instruments through advertising and obtained endorsements from many famous musicians of the day, including Joseph Joachim, Eugène Ysaÿe, David Popper, and August Wilhelmj. In addition, he helped sponsor competitions in various categories such as symphonies, opera and chamber music. His own works included the operas &#x27; (1902) and&#x27; (1903), as well as the never performed &#x27; and&#x27;.

Stelzner&#x27;s company eventually failed and entered bankruptcy. Faced with overwhelming financial difficulties, Stelzner committed suicide at his home in Dresden in 1906.

<doc id="787694" wikidata="Q7826925" url="?curid=787694" title="Torrance High School">
<text>Torrance High School is a high school located in Torrance, California. Founded in 1917, it is one of the oldest high schools in continuous use in California and is the oldest of the five high schools in the Torrance Unified School District. Four of its buildings are listed on the U.S. National Register of Historic Places.

Torrance High School is a popular filming location for television and motion picture production. It is most widely known for its appearance in high-profile television shows, including &quot;Beverly Hills, 90210&quot; and &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer&quot;. It is the alma mater of broadcaster Paul Moyer, Medal of Honor recipient Ted Tanouye, World War II prisoner of war Louis Zamperini, professional golfer Angela Park and professional golfer Jenny Shin.

==School history==
Torrance High School first opened on September 11, 1917, under the jurisdiction of the Los Angeles High School District, as a combination high school and elementary school to accommodate the area&#x27;s rapid post-World War I growth brought on by the region&#x27;s petroleum industry and iron works, as well as the Pacific Electric Railway expansion. Upon its opening in 1917, the school consisted of 10 rooms, seven of which were used for classrooms.

Torrance High&#x27;s first commencement ceremony took place on June 18, 1918, during which two female students received their diplomas. As the population of students at Torrance High grew, new buildings were constructed to accommodate the increasing student body. Additions were added to the main building in 1921 which included the senior patio and fountain. By 1923, two additional buildings - the home economics wing and auditorium - were constructed on both sides of the main building. The growing number of high school students led to the construction of a separate building to serve elementary students. Known today as the Torrance High Annex, the building remained an elementary school until 1963 when it was annexed by Torrance High. A school newspaper was established in 1922 called &quot;The Tentacle.&quot; It was changed to the &quot;Torrance News Torch&quot; in 1926 to better match with the school yearbook&#x27;s name, &quot;The Torch.&quot; More additions to the school were made in the late 1920s, including a gymnasium and a print shop to print the newspaper and yearbook.

In 1947 Torrance Unified School District—TUSD was formed but was not certified for a high school. During the school year of fall 1947 to summer 1948, Torrance High School was part of the Redondo Union High School District, as the Torrance School District split from the Los Angeles City School District and Los Angeles City High School District, but California law prevented the newly-formed Torrance school district from immediately controlling high schools. Torrance High joined what became Torrance Unified School District the following year. Torrance High has a series of underground bomb shelters located throughout the school, dating back from the Cold War era. The very first graduating high school class from Torrance Unified School District was the Class of 1948.

==Campus==
The Long Beach earthquake (magnitude 6.4) on March 10, 1933, left its mark on the campus. The quake destroyed the upper part of the original auditorium and caused the ground near it to sink several feet. The area was nicknamed the &quot;Sunken Garden&quot; until rebuilt. The landmark auditorium replacing it was built in 1937 as a Works Progress Administration project while the elevated administrative offices were added in 1962.

In 2018, &quot;Architectural Digest&quot; named Torrance High School the most beautiful high school in California.

===Filming history===
Torrance High&#x27;s unique architecture and relative proximity to Hollywood Studios make it an ideal filming location for major television programs and motion pictures. Its credits include:
;Television: 
* &quot;All American High&quot;, a documentary film chronicling the life of the 1984 THS senior class, was filmed on the campus. The film is narrated by a Finnish exchange student, and observes 1980&#x27;s California high school culture from a foreigner&#x27;s perspective. &quot;All American High Revisited&quot; (2014) combines the original film with new footage of the film&#x27;s principal subjects being interviewed on their high school years, the process of growing up, and the various paths in life that they took.

As an unofficial tradition, Torrance High has been known for many of its graduates enlisting with the U.S. military, particularly the Marine Corps. Many alumni have gone on to become professional players, some before they even graduated. Deon Thompson graduated in 2006, and went on to play basketball for UNC as a forward. Angela Park became a professional golfer in April before her graduation in 2006, and went on to tie for second place in the LPGA US Women&#x27;s Open of 2007. Angela would earn the 2007 LPGA Rookie of the Year Award. Jenny Shin, Class of 2010, has competed on the LPGA Tour since 2011 and won the 2016 LPGA Volunteers of America Texas Shootout along with 22 career top 10 LPGA finishes.

In 2004, Torrance High instated its Schoolwide Academic Goals in an effort to raise its education standards. Comprising an acronym of the mascot&#x27;s name, they outline goals of technical competency and other standards.
Every year, about 50% of the seniors attend community colleges after graduating.

<text>Stefan Panaretov () or Stephen Panaretoff or Stephan Panaretoff ( - October 19, 1931) was a prominent Bulgarian diplomat, academician and professor at Robert College, an independent private high school in Turkey.

== Early life ==

He was born on 4 October 1853 in Sliven to Archimandrite Panaret, a Bulgarian clergyman, who served in the Bulgarian church in Constantinople. At the age of 14 he entered the recently established Robert College and graduated in 1871. Upon graduation he immediately became an assistant professor in Bulgarian literature and in 1875 was promoted to the rank of a professor. Panaretoff taught for 43 years at Robert College until he was appointed, at the age of 61, as the first Bulgarian minister to the U.S.

After the April Uprising and following Ottoman Atrocities in 1876, Panaretoff publicized the Turkish massacres of Bulgarian Christians in an effort to sway Western public opinion. He traveled to Britain to represent the Bulgarian people. In 1880, Panaretoff conducted another unofficial diplomatic mission to London to gain support for Bulgarian acquisition of Eastern Rumelia.

In 1892 he married the American missionary and teacher Lydia Ann Gile (1869–1931), who taught at the American College for Girls in Constantinople.

==Diplomat and lecturer==
He became the first Special Envoy and Minister Plenipotentiary of Bulgaria to the U.S. after presenting his Letter of Credence to President Woodrow Wilson on December 22, 1914.

His only son, Cyril Panaretoff, was killed in the First World War, fighting for the Kingdom of Bulgaria.

He played a critical role in maintaining Bulgarian relations with the Wilson administration through the War, despite a myriad of calls for the breaking of diplomatic ties with the Central Power ally. In 1918, Panaretov was the only official diplomatic representative of a member country of the Central Powers who continued his work in the capital of the United States.

In 1921, Panaretoff served as the ad hoc Bulgarian representative to the League of Nations after the international organization admitted Bulgaria as a member state.

Panaretov resigned his post as Minister Plenipotentiary in 1925. Rather than return to Bulgaria, Panaretov and his wife stayed in Washington and he became lecturer at George Washington University.

==Legacy==
After his death, which followed the death of his wife, the Bulgarian Academy of Sciences received a bequest from his estate of approximately 2.5 million lev. The academy built a library and reading room that was named in his honor.

<text>The Accademia di Belle Arti di Firenze () is an instructional art academy in Florence, in Tuscany, in central Italy.

It was founded by Cosimo I de&#x27; Medici in 1563, under the influence of Giorgio Vasari. Michelangelo, Benvenuto Cellini and other significant artists have been associated with it.

Like other state art academies in Italy, it became an autonomous degree-awarding institution under law no. 508 dated 21 December 1999, and falls under the administration of the Ministero dell&#x27;Istruzione, dell&#x27;Università e della Ricerca, the Italian ministry of education and research.

The adjacent (but unaffiliated) Galleria dell&#x27;Accademia houses the original &quot;David&quot; by Michelangelo.

==History==

The Accademia e Compagnia delle Arti del Disegno, or &quot;academy and company of the arts of drawing&quot;, was founded on 13 January 1563 by Cosimo I de&#x27; Medici, under the influence of Giorgio Vasari. It was made up of two parts: the company was a kind of guild for all working artists, while the academy was a more select group of artists responsible for supervision of artistic production in the Medici state. At first, the academy met in the cloisters of the Basilica della Santissima Annunziata.

Artists including Michelangelo Buonarroti, Lazzaro Donati, Francesco da Sangallo, Agnolo Bronzino, Benvenuto Cellini, Giorgio Vasari, Giovanni Angelo Montorsoli, Bartolomeo Ammannati, and Giambologna were members. Most members of the Accademia were male. Artemisia Gentileschi was the first woman to be admitted; Angelika Kauffmann became a member in 1762. The Accademia awarded Marianne Sessi a gold medal in 1807.

In 1784 Pietro Leopoldo, Grand Duke of Tuscany, combined all the schools of drawing in Florence into one institution, the new Accademia di Belle Arti, or academy of fine arts. It was housed in a former convent in via Ricasoli, premises which it still occupies.

In 1873 the Accademia was divided into two separate bodies: the teaching institution, the Accademia di Belle Arti; and the college of academicians, which was named the Accademia delle Arti del Disegno.

== The Galleria dell&#x27;Accademia ==

The Galleria dell&#x27;Accademia was founded in 1784; it adjoins the Accademia di Belle Arti in via Ricasoli, but is otherwise unconnected with it. It has housed the original &quot;David&quot; by Michelangelo since 1873.

<text>Arsenic and Old Lace is a 1944 American screwball black comedy crime film directed by Frank Capra and starring Cary Grant. The screenplay by Julius J. Epstein and Philip G. Epstein is based on Joseph Kesselring&#x27;s 1941 play of the same name. The contract with the play&#x27;s producers stipulated that the film would not be released until the Broadway run ended. The original planned release date was September 30, 1942. The play was hugely successful, running for three and a half years, so the film was not released until 1944.

The lead role of Mortimer Brewster was originally intended for Bob Hope, but he could not be released from his contract with Paramount Pictures. Capra had also approached Jack Benny and Richard Travis before learning that Grant would accept the role. On the Broadway stage, Boris Karloff played Jonathan Brewster, who is said to &quot;look like Boris Karloff&quot;. According to Turner Classic Movies, Karloff, who gave permission for the use of his name in the film, remained in the play to appease the producers, who were afraid of what stripping the play of all its primary cast would do to ticket sales. Raymond Massey took Karloff&#x27;s place on screen. The film&#x27;s supporting cast also features Jack Carson, Priscilla Lane, Peter Lorre, and Edward Everett Horton.

Josephine Hull and Jean Adair portray the Brewster sisters, Abby and Martha, respectively. Hull and Adair, as well as John Alexander (who played Teddy Brewster), reprised their roles from the 1941 stage production. Hull and Adair both received an eight-week leave of absence from the stage production, which was still running, but Karloff did not, as he was an investor in the stage production and its main draw. The entire film was shot within those eight weeks. The film cost just over $1.2 million of a $2 million budget to produce. The cost of the filming rights was $175,000.

==Plot==
The Brewster family of Brooklyn, New York City, is descended from &quot;Mayflower&quot; settlers. Several illustrious forebears&#x27; portraits line the walls of the ancestral home.

Mortimer Brewster, a theater critic and author who has repeatedly denounced marriage as &quot;an old-fashioned superstition&quot;, falls in love with Elaine Harper, his neighbor and a minister&#x27;s daughter. On Halloween day, Mortimer and Elaine get married. Elaine goes to her father&#x27;s house to share the news of her marriage with him and pack for the honeymoon, while Mortimer visits his aunts, Abby and Martha, who raised him in the old family home. Mortimer&#x27;s disturbed younger brother, Teddy, who believes he is Theodore Roosevelt, resides with them. Each time Teddy goes upstairs, he yells &quot;Charge!&quot; and runs up the stairs, imitating Roosevelt&#x27;s famous 1898 charge up San Juan Hill.

Searching for the notes for his next book, Mortimer finds a corpse hidden in the window seat. He assumes in horror that Teddy&#x27;s delusions have led him to murder. Abby and Martha cheerfully confess to murdering Mr. Hoskins and explain that they minister to lonely old bachelors by ending their &quot;suffering&quot;. They post a &quot;Room for Rent&quot; sign to attract a victim, then serve a glass of elderberry wine spiked with arsenic, strychnine, and cyanide while getting acquainted with them. In addition to Mr. Hoskins, the aunts have murdered eleven other men; the bodies are buried in the cellar by Teddy, who believes they are yellow fever victims who died in the building of the Panama Canal.

While Mortimer digests this information, his older brother Jonathan arrives with his alcoholic accomplice, plastic surgeon Dr. Herman Einstein. Jonathan is a serial murderer trying to escape from the police and dispose of his latest victim, Mr. Spenalzo. Jonathan&#x27;s face, altered by Einstein while drunk, resembles Boris Karloff&#x27;s Frankenstein monster makeup. Jonathan learns his aunts&#x27; secret and proposes to bury his victim in the cellar. Abby and Martha object vehemently because their victims were &quot;nice&quot; gentlemen while Jonathan&#x27;s victim is a stranger and a &quot;foreigner&quot;. Jonathan also declares his intention to kill Mortimer.

Elaine is impatient to leave on their honeymoon to Niagara Falls but is concerned about Mortimer&#x27;s increasingly odd behavior as he frantically attempts to control the situation. He unsuccessfully tries to alert the bumbling police to Jonathan&#x27;s presence. To draw attention away from his aunts and deprive them of their willing but uncomprehending accomplice, Mortimer tries to file paperwork to have Teddy legally committed to a mental asylum. Worrying that the genetic predisposition for mental illness resides within him, Mortimer explains to Elaine that he cannot remain married to her.

Eventually, Jonathan is arrested. Teddy is safely consigned to an institution, and his aunts insist on joining him. Einstein flees after signing the aunts&#x27; commitment papers. Upon hearing that Mortimer signed the commitment papers as next of kin, Abby and Martha are concerned they may be null and void; they inform Mortimer that he is not a Brewster after all: his mother was the family cook and his biological father was a chef on a steamship. Relieved, he kisses Elaine and whisks her off to their honeymoon.

==Cast==
==Background==
The play &quot;Arsenic and Old Lace&quot; was written by Joseph Kesselring, son of German immigrants and a former professor at Bethel College, a pacifist Mennonite college. It was written in the anti-war atmosphere of the late 1930s. Capra scholar Matthew C. Gunter argues that the deep theme of both the play and film is the United States&#x27; difficulty in coming to grips with both the positive and negative consequences of the liberty it professes to uphold, and which the Brewsters demand. Although their house is the nicest in the street, there are 12 bodies in the basement. That inconsistency is a metaphor for the country&#x27;s struggle to reconcile the violence of much of its past with the pervasive myths about its role as a beacon of freedom.

The set used for the Brewster home in &quot;Arsenic and Old Lace&quot; was reused in the 1942 film &quot;George Washington Slept Here&quot;. To ensure it looked the part of a dilapidated farmhouse in the latter film, Warner Bros. crews knocked out bannisters, rafters and floors on the set.

==Reception==
===Box office===
According to Warner Bros. records, the film grossed $2,836,000 domestically and $1,948,000 internationally.

===Critical response===
The contemporary critical reviews were uniformly positive. &quot;The New York Times&quot; critic summed up the majority view, &quot;As a whole, &quot;Arsenic and Old Lace&quot;, the Warner picture which came to the Strand yesterday, is good macabre fun.&quot; &quot;Variety&quot; declared, &quot;Capra&#x27;s production, not elaborate, captures the color and spirit of the play, while the able writing team of Julius J. and Philip G. Epstein has turned in a very workable, tightly-compressed script. Capra&#x27;s own intelligent direction rounds out.&quot; &quot;Harrison&#x27;s Reports&quot; wrote: &quot;An hilarious entertainment, it should turn out to be one of the year&#x27;s top box-office attractions.&quot; John Lardner of &quot;The New Yorker&quot; called the film &quot;practically as funny in picture form as it did on the stage, and that is very funny indeed.&quot;

Assessing the film in 1968, Charles Higham and Joel Greenberg state in &quot;Hollywood in the Forties&quot; that &quot;Frank Capra provided a rather overstated and strained version of &quot;Arsenic and Old Lace&quot;&quot;.

On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 86% based on 35 reviews, with an average rating of 7.7/10.

The film is recognized by American Film Institute in AFI&#x27;s 100 Years...100 Laughs ( 30) in 2000.

==Radio adaptations==
&quot;Arsenic and Old Lace&quot; was adapted as a half-hour radio play for the November 25, 1946, broadcast of &quot;The Screen Guild Theater&quot; with Boris Karloff and Eddie Albert. A one-hour adaptation was broadcast on January 25, 1948, on &quot;Ford Theatre&quot;, with Josephine Hull, Jean Adair, and John Alexander reprising their roles.

<doc id="787709" wikidata="Q3113415" url="?curid=787709" title="Granada Hills, Los Angeles">
<text>Granada Hills is a neighborhood in the San Fernando Valley region of Los Angeles. The community has a sports program and a range of city recreation centers. The neighborhood has fourteen public and ten private schools.

==History==
The Granada Hills area is situated on the traditional homelands of the Tongva and Chumash. The Tongva village of Ceegenga may have been the closest village located to the Granada Hills area.

The community began as a dairy farm and orchard known as the Sunshine Ranch which grew apricots, oranges, walnuts and beans. Vestiges of former citrus groves can still be seen in orange, lemon or grapefruit trees in many residential yards. In 1916, the San Fernando Valley&#x27;s first oil well was drilled in what is now Granada Hills. The oil well was located at the northern tip of Zelzah Avenue. Granada Hills was founded in 1926 as &quot;Granada;&quot; the &quot;Hills&quot; portion of the name was added 15 years later.

==Geography and climate==
Granada Hills is located at the foothills of the Santa Susana Mountains, north of North Hills, Northridge, west of Mission Hills and Sylmar, and east of the Porter Ranch neighborhoods of Los Angeles. The Ronald Reagan Freeway (State Route 118) runs through its southern area. Van Norman Reservoir, the southern terminus of the Los Angeles Aqueduct, is located in Granada Hills.

==Demographics==
The 2000 U.S. census counted 50,535 residents in the 15.11-square-mile neighborhood—or 3,344 people per square mile. In 2008, the city estimated that the population had increased to 53,998, a density of 3,574 people per square mile. In 2000 the median age for residents was 37.

The neighborhood is ethnically diverse and includes whites, 55.5%; Latinos, 20.6%; Asians, 16.3%; blacks, 3.4%; and others, 4.2%. Korea (16.0%) and Mexico (13.8%) were the most common places of birth for 29.2% of the residents who were born abroad.

The median yearly household income in 2008 was $83,911. Renters occupied 26.4% of the housing stock. The average household size of 2.9 people was considered average for Los Angeles. The percentages of married men (60.4%) and women (58.5%) were among the county&#x27;s highest. There were 4,032 veterans, or 10.5% of the population, a high proportion compared to the rest of the city.

==Arts and culture==

===Architecture===
Granada Hills is composed mostly of Mid-century modern architecture. Of note is the &quot;Balboa Highlands&quot; tract built by iconic developer Joseph Eichler as well as the Knollwood Country Club area and Knollwood Grove tract. Many of these homes, which are North of Rinaldi/West of Balboa, have been featured in movies, commercials, magazine pictorials and appear in books about Eichler or mid-century architecture.

===Historical landmarks===
White Oak Avenue, between San Fernando Mission and San Jose Street, was declared a Los Angeles Historic-Cultural Monument on August 3, 1966, for the 101 Deodar Cedar trees that line the street. The trees are native to the Himalayas and appreciated for their size, beauty and timber. White Oak Avenue trees were used as the back-drop in the flying bicycle scenes in the 1982 film &quot;E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial&quot;.

==Sports==
Granada Hills Charter High School&#x27;s stadium, the John Elway Stadium (named after the quarterback, an alumnus), is home to the Los Angeles Rampage women&#x27;s soccer team and formerly home to the San Fernando Valley Quakes.

In 1963, the Granada Hills Little League won the Little League World Championship in baseball.

==Parks and recreation==
O&#x27;Melveny Park, the second largest park in Los Angeles, consists of a large undeveloped area and a much smaller developed section with several dozen citrus trees, a small intermittent stream, and grass and picnic areas. This park includes hiking trails and fire roads, including a grassy promontory from which a view of the northeastern portion of the San Fernando Valley may be seen.
Mission Point and its environs are popular mountain biking and hiking areas. The view from the top of Mission Point (called &quot;Mission Peak&quot; by many residents), the highest point in Granada Hills, is striking, taking in most of the San Fernando Valley. In clear weather, one can see the Pacific Ocean and Downtown Los Angeles. The area around the peak is home to deer, golden eagle, bobcats, mountain lions, raccoons, and coyotes.

The Granada Hills Recreation Center (also known as Petit Park) features an auditorium, baseball diamonds, basketball courts, children&#x27;s play areas, a gym, picnic tables, tennis courts, classrooms, a dance room and a library. Programs are offered in sports, and arts and crafts.

Zelzah Park, an unstaffed park, has a bridle path, a children&#x27;s play area, and picnic tables.

==Government==

<doc id="787713" wikidata="Q57141" url="?curid=787713" title="Günther von Kluge">
<text>Günther Adolf Ferdinand von Kluge (30 October 1882 – 19 August 1944) was a German &quot;Generalfeldmarschall&quot; (Field Marshal) during World War II who held commands on both the Eastern and Western Fronts. He commanded the 4th Army of the Wehrmacht during the invasion of Poland in 1939 and the Battle of France in 1940, earning a promotion to Generalfeldmarschall. Kluge went on to command the 4th Army in Operation Barbarossa (the invasion of the Soviet Union) and the Battle for Moscow in 1941.

Amid the crisis of the Soviet counter-offensive in December 1941, Kluge was promoted to command Army Group Centre replacing Field Marshal Fedor von Bock. Several members of the German military resistance to Adolf Hitler served on his staff, including Henning von Tresckow. Kluge was aware of the plotters&#x27; activities but refused to offer his support unless Hitler was killed. His command on the Eastern Front lasted until October 1943 when Kluge was badly injured in a car accident.

Following a lengthy recuperation, Kluge was appointed OB West (Supreme Commander West) in occupied France in July 1944, after his predecessor, Field Marshal Gerd von Rundstedt, was dismissed for defeatism. Kluge&#x27;s forces were unable to stop the momentum of the Allied invasion of Normandy, and he began to realise that the war in the West was lost. Although Kluge was not an active conspirator in the 20 July plot, in the aftermath of the failed coup he committed suicide on 19 August 1944, after having been recalled to Berlin for a meeting with Hitler. Kluge was replaced by Field Marshal Walter Model.

==Early life and career==
Kluge was born on 30 October 1882 in Posen, then in the German state of Prussia (now in western Poland). His father, Max von Kluge, was from an aristocratic Prussian military family. A distinguished commander, Max was a lieutenant general in the German Army who served in the First World War. He married Elise Kühn-Schuhmann in 1881. Günther von Kluge was one of two children, having a younger brother named Wolfgang (1892–1976). Wolfgang served in both world wars, rising to the rank of lieutenant general by 1943, and was commander of Fortress Dunkirk between July and September 1944.

In 1901, Günther von Kluge – sometimes called Hans Günther von Kluge or &quot;Der kluge Hans&quot; (&quot;Clever Hans&quot;) after an alleged performing horse – was commissioned in the German Army&#x27;s 46th Field Artillery Regiment. He served on the General Staff between 1910 and 1918, reaching the rank of captain on the Western Front during the First World War. He was wounded at Verdun, and later became a captain on the General Staff. He remained in the postwar &quot;Reichswehr&quot; (national army) during the Weimar era, becoming a colonel in 1930, major general in 1933, and lieutenant general a year later. He was von Brauchitsch&#x27;s chief of staff in East Prussia in 1933, and was viewed as having subsequently &quot;followed von Brauchitsch&#x27;s star.&quot; On 1 April 1934, Kluge took command of the 6th Division in Münster. In 1935, Adolf Hitler&#x27;s proclamation of the Wehrmacht – the enlarged German Army – precipitated Kluge&#x27;s appointment to the 6th Corps and then the 6th Army Group, which subsequently became the 4th Army.

Kluge believed Hitler&#x27;s &quot;crude militarism&quot; would lead Germany into disaster. During the Sudetenland Crisis, he was a member of a secret anti-war faction led by Ludwig Beck and Ernst von Weizsäcker, hoping to avoid armed conflict over the disputed territory. The crisis was averted by the Munich Agreement on 30 September 1938. Although he was privately critical of the Nazis, Kluge believed in the principle of &quot;Lebensraum&quot; and took pride in the rearmament of the Wehrmacht.

== World War II ==
===Invasion of Poland===
Hitler approved of the German High Command&#x27;s outline for invading Poland with two army groups during a military briefing on 26–27 April 1939. Kluge&#x27;s 4th Army was assigned to Army Group North under Fedor von Bock. The Polish campaign commenced on 1 September, taking advantage of the country&#x27;s long border with Germany. The 4th Army was to advance eastward toward the Corridor from West Pomerania to link with the 3rd Army; the port city of Danzig fell within the first day.

By the following day, apprehensions of a strong Polish defensive line along the Brda River had not materialized. The 4th Army crossed the river, sealing the Polish 9th Infantry Division, 27th Infantry Division, and the Pomeranian Cavalry Brigade in the Corridor. Kluge sent the 10th Panzer Division from his army across the Vistula River, meeting with the 3rd Army on 3 September. The 4th Army&#x27;s XIX Panzer Corps (Heinz Guderian) captured the city of Brześć on 17 September after three days of fighting in the Battle of Brześć Litewski. Army Group North was informed of the Red Army&#x27;s invasion of eastern Poland the same day and was directed to remain west of the Bug River. Brześć was turned over to the Soviet forces on 22 September. For his entrapment of Polish forces in the early stages of the invasion, Kluge earned Hitler&#x27;s praise as one of his most brilliant commanders.

===Battle of France===

In preparation for &quot;Fall Gelb&quot; (&quot;Case Yellow&quot;), the invasion of France, Kluge and the 4th Army were transferred to Army Group A under the command of Gerd von Rundstedt. Hitler, still looking for an aggressive alternative to the original plan, approved Erich von Manstein&#x27;s ideas, known as the Manstein Plan, following a meeting with them on 17 February 1940. The plan outlined that the 4th Army would contribute to an attack through the rugged Ardennes terrain of southern Belgium and Luxembourg to the Meuse River; Kluge entrusted the XV Army Corps, encompassing the 5th and 7th Panzer Divisions, to provide flank cover for Georg-Hans Reinhardt&#x27;s corps by crossing the Meuse at Dinant.

Launched on 10 May, Case Yellow began successfully. Kluge&#x27;s corps advanced rapidly, reaching the Meuse in two days. A river crossing, spearheaded by 7th Panzer commander Erwin Rommel, established a bridgehead on the west bank of the Meuse on 13 May and forced the French 9th Army into retreat. Kluge&#x27;s forces—particularly the 7th Panzer Division—achieved a rapid breakthrough from their bridgehead in the following days; between 16 and 17 May Rommel captured 10,000 prisoners and 100 tanks, and wiped out the remainder of the French 9th Army at the expense of only 35 casualties. Overextended and well ahead of the army group, the 5th and 7th Panzer Divisions fended off a joint British-French counterattack near the town of Arras on 21 May.

After a conference with Hitler and Rundstedt, Kluge issued an order to his Panzer units to halt on 24 May, from Dunkirk—by then the possible escape route for the British Expeditionary Force. The two-day respite allowed the Allies to consolidate their manpower around Dunkirk and prepare for an evacuation. On 5 June, at the commencement of &quot;Fall Rot&quot; (&quot;Case Red&quot;), the second phase of the invasion plan, Kluge&#x27;s 4th Army helped achieve the first breakthrough at Amiens and reached the Seine River on 10 June. Kluge&#x27;s command and Rommel&#x27;s generalship throughout the invasion led to his promotion to &quot;generalfeldmarschall&quot; (field marshal) on 19 July.

===Invasion of the Soviet Union===

Kluge commanded the 4th Army at the opening of Operation Barbarossa as part of Army Group Centre. In addition to his command, the army group included a field army, the 9th Army, and two mobile formations, the 2nd (Heinz Guderian) and the 3rd Panzer Groups (Hermann Hoth).

On 29 June, Kluge ordered that women in uniform were to be shot, in line with the Nazi ideological worldview. It considered female combatants to be yet another manifestation of &quot;barbaric&quot; Bolshevism where natural gender roles were upended. The order was later rescinded, and women in uniform were to be captured instead. On 4 July, the Oberkommando des Heeres (OKH) (&quot;High Command&quot;) subordinated the 2nd and the 3rd Panzer Groups to Kluge, to improve coordination between the fast charging armoured spearheads and the slower infantry. The resulting formation provided unity on paper; in reality, the Panzer group commanders often bristled at Kluge&#x27;s orders and Guderian and Kluge detested each other personally. Kluge had to give up all but his two infantry corps; his other corps were assigned to the 2nd Army, which had previously been held in reserve.

Expecting a short war that would not necessitate the exploitation of Soviet labour for the German war effort, the German High Command and military leadership did not make adequate preparations to house prisoners-of-war and civilian internees. In Kluge&#x27;s area of command, 100,000 POWs and 40,000 civilians were herded into a small open-air camp in Minsk in July 1941. Amid deteriorating conditions and starvation in the camp, Organisation Todt appealed to Kluge to release 10,000 skilled workers. Kluge declined, wishing to make the decisions regarding the prisoners himself.

As part of the Hunger Plan, one of the pillars of the war of annihilation against the Soviet Union, the Wehrmacht was largely expected to &quot;live off the land&quot;. Thus looting, pillaging, and abuse of the civilian population was rampant, especially in the areas to the rear. In September 1941, Kluge issued an order to his troops aimed at restoring discipline. It stated that it was &quot;high time to put a &quot;complete end&quot; to the unjustified methods of obtaining supplies, the raids, the plundering trips over vast distances, all the senseless and criminal activity&quot;. Kluge threatened harsh measures against those responsible, along with their superior commanders who failed to maintain discipline.

====Battle of Moscow====
During Operation Typhoon, the German advance on Moscow, Kluge had the 4th Panzer Group, under the command of Erich Hoepner, subordinated to the 4th Army. In early October, the 4th Panzer Group completed the encirclement at Vyazma. Much to Hoepner&#x27;s displeasure, Kluge instructed him to pause the advance as his units were needed to prevent break-outs of Soviet forces. Hoepner was confident that clearing the pocket and the advance on Moscow, could be undertaken at the same time. He viewed Kluge&#x27;s actions as interference, which led to friction and &quot;clashes&quot; with his superior, as he wrote in a letter home on 6 October. Hoepner did not seem to appreciate that his units were very short on fuel; the 11th Panzer Division reported having no fuel at all. Only the 20th Panzer Division was advancing towards Moscow amid deteriorating road conditions.

On 17 November, the 4th Panzer Group again attacked towards Moscow alongside the V Army Corps of the 4th Army, as part of the continuation of Operation Typhoon by Army Group Centre. The panzer group and the army corps represented Kluge&#x27;s best forces, most ready for a continued offensive. In two weeks&#x27; fighting, the German forces advanced ( per day). A lack of tanks, insufficient motor transport, and a precarious supply situation, along with tenacious Red Army resistance, and the air superiority achieved by Soviet fighters hampered the attack.

Facing pressure from German High Command, Kluge finally committed his weaker south flank to the attack on 1 December. In the aftermath of the battle, Hoepner and Guderian blamed Kluge&#x27;s slow commitment of the 4th Army&#x27;s south flank to the attack for the German failure to reach Moscow. Historian David Stahel wrote that this assessment grossly overestimated the capabilities of Kluge&#x27;s remaining forces. It also failed to appreciate the reality that Moscow was a metropolis, and German forces lacked the numbers to encircle it. With the outer defensive belt completed by 25 November, Moscow was a fortified position which the Wehrmacht lacked the strength to take in a frontal assault. Further attacks were called off on 5 December; the Red Army launched its winter counter-offensive on the same day.

====Army Group Centre====

After Fedor von Bock was relieved of his command of Army Group Center on 18 December, Kluge was promoted to replace him. Bitter fighting continued in Army Group Center&#x27;s sector in the winter and early spring, with neither side being able to make much headway. The German forces held, but barely. During the summer campaign of 1942, Case Blue, the army group was to hold its position.

On 30 October 1942, Kluge received a letter of good wishes from Hitler together with a cheque for a half-million Reichsmarks made out to him from the German treasury. It included a promise that the costs of improving his estate could be billed to the state. This was part of the bribery of senior Wehrmacht officers scheme.
Kluge accepted the money. After severe criticism from his chief of staff, Henning von Tresckow, who upbraided him for corruption, he agreed to meet Carl Friedrich Goerdeler, an opponent of the Nazi regime, in November 1942.
Kluge promised Goerdeler that he would arrest Hitler the next time he came to the Eastern Front. Then after receiving another &quot;gift&quot; from Hitler, he changed his mind and decided to remain loyal.
Hitler, who seems to have heard that Kluge was dissatisfied with his leadership, regarded his &quot;gifts&quot; as entitling him to Kluge&#x27;s total loyalty.
For much of 1942 and early 1943, Army Group Centre was engaged in positional warfare around the Rzhev salient defending against Red Army offensives, collectively known as the Battles of Rzhev. The Soviet forces gained little ground for their losses, especially in the unsuccessful Operation Mars that commenced around the same time as Operation Uranus, the encirclement of the German forces in the Battle of Stalingrad. Kluge&#x27;s forces were nevertheless depleted and early in 1943, he obtained authorisation to withdraw the 9th Army (General Walter Model) and elements of the 4th Army (General Gotthard Heinrici) from the salient. The resulting Operation Büffel saw the Wehrmacht abandon the salient in phases between 1 and 22 March 1943. The operation eliminated the Rzhev salient shortening the German lines by miles. The withdrawal was accompanied by a ruthless scorched-earth and security campaign, resulting in widespread destruction, razing of villages, deportation of the able-bodied population for slave labour, and killings of civilians by the troops of the Wehrmacht under the guise of &quot;anti-partisan warfare&quot;.

On 13 March 1943, Hitler authorised several offensives, including one against the Kursk salient. As the last Soviet resistance in the Third Battle of Kharkov petered out, Erich von Manstein, commander of Army Group South, attempted to persuade Kluge to immediately attack the Soviet Central Front, which was defending the northern face of the salient. Kluge refused, believing that his forces were too weak to launch such an attack. By mid-April, amid poor weather and with the German forces exhausted and in need of refitting, the offensives were postponed.

On 15 April, Hitler and the OKH issued a new operational order, which called for the offensive codenamed &quot;Zitadelle&quot; (&quot;Citadel&quot;), to begin on 3 May or shortly thereafter against the Kursk salient. Operation Citadel, which led to the Battle of Kursk, called for a double envelopment. Army Group Centre was to provide Model&#x27;s 9th Army to form the northern pincer. Army Group South&#x27;s 4th Panzer Army and Army Detachment Kempf would drive north to meet the 9th Army east of Kursk. As the planning and preparations continued, in late April Model met with Hitler to express his concerns about strong defensive positions being established by the Red Army in his sector.

Hitler called his senior officers and advisors to Munich for a meeting on 4 May. A number of options were put forth for comment: going on the offensive immediately with the forces at hand, delaying the offensive further to await the arrival of new and better tanks, radically revising the operation or cancelling it altogether. Manstein advocated an early attack but requested two additional infantry divisions, to which Hitler responded that none were available. Kluge spoke out strongly against postponement and discounted Model&#x27;s reconnaissance materials. General Heinz Guderian, Inspector of Armoured Forces, argued against the operation, stating &quot;the attack was pointless&quot;. The conference ended without Hitler coming to a decision, but Citadel was not aborted.

The operation, launched on 5 July, had misfired from the start. In the northern sector, the Soviet forces had completely halted the German advance by 10 July. On 12 July, the Red Army launched Operation Kutuzov, its counter-offensive against the Orel salient, which threatened the flank and rear of Model&#x27;s 9th Army. On the evening of 12 July, Hitler summoned Kluge and Manstein to his headquarters at Rastenburg in East Prussia, where he announced the cancellation of Citadel. Amid heavy fighting, the Red Army entered Orel on 5 August and, on 18 August, it reached the outskirts of Bryansk, eliminating the Orel salient. With Army Group Center falling back on prepared defensive positions, the German resistance stiffened and it took the Soviet forces until the end of September to liberate Smolensk.

On 27 October 1943, Kluge was badly injured in a car accident. He was unable to return to duty until July 1944. Field Marshal Ernst Busch replaced Kluge as commander of Army Group Centre.

===Western Front===

In July 1944, Kluge was appointed OB West (Commander of the German Army in the West) after his predecessor, Field Marshal Gerd von Rundstedt, was dismissed for remarking that the war was lost. With the initiative belonging to the Allies, Kluge immediately sought to assert authority over Rommel, in charge of Army Group B and build his command&#x27;s confidence in defending Normandy. Yet by 12 July, having toured the front and been briefed by field commanders, Kluge expressed his skepticism to Alfred Jodl: &quot;I am no pessimist. But in my view, the situation could not be grimmer&quot;. Five days later, Rommel was wounded when a Royal Canadian Air Force (RCAF) Spitfire strafed his staff car, causing the vehicle to veer off the road; Kluge succeeded him in command of Army Group B while retaining his other post.
The Allies drove the Germans from the vital heights of Saint-Lô in July, setting the stage for a major offensive in the Normandy Campaign. Launched on 25 July, Operation Cobra was intended for U.S. forces to take advantage of German armies occupied by British and Canadian attacks around Caen and achieve a decisive breakthrough in northwestern France. By 28 July, the operation succeeded in breaking through German lines, and resistance to the Americans was disorganized. Lacking the resources to hold the front, German units launched desperate counterattacks to escape entrapment, while Kluge sent reinforcements, comprising elements of the 2nd and 116th panzer divisions, westward in hopes of avoiding total collapse; in fierce engagements, his forces suffered heavy losses in men and tanks that he could not replace.

In the last days of July, the German army in Normandy had been reduced to such a poor state by Allied offensives that Kluge could no longer sustain a viable defensive position in Normandy; he had no prospects for reinforcements in the wake of Operation Bagration, the Soviet summer offensive against Army Group Centre, and very few Germans believed they could salvage victory. Between 1 and 4 August, seven divisions from the U.S. Third Army, under Lieutenant General George S. Patton, advanced rapidly through Avranches and over the bridge at Pontaubault into Brittany.

Against Kluge&#x27;s advice to withdraw, Hitler ordered a counterattack, Operation Lüttich, between Mortain and Avranches. He demanded that all available Panzer units cooperate in a concentrated attack aimed at recapturing the Contentin Peninsula and cutting off U.S. forces in Brittany from resupply. According to OB West Operations Officer Bodo Zimmermann, Kluge knew &quot;very well that carrying out this order meant the collapse of the Normandy front&quot;, but his misgivings were ignored. Kluge could only muster four depleted Panzer divisions by the time operations commenced on 7 August. The offensive came to a halt from Avaranches, primarily due to Allied air superiority, leaving German units vulnerable to entrapment.

A final offensive, Operation Tractable, was launched by Canadian forces on 14 August in conjunction with American advances northward toward Chambois; their goal was to encircle and destroy the German 7th Army and 5th Panzer Army near the town of Falaise. In his final order as OB West commander, Kluge issued a full-scale retreat eastward on 16 August. The Allies did not capture Falaise until later that same day, leaving a -gap between Canadian and American forces—known as the Falaise Gap. By 22 August, the gap—desperately maintained by the Germans to allow their trapped forces to escape—was completely sealed, ending the Battle of Normandy with a decisive Allied victory. As remnants of Army Group B fled eastward, the Allies advanced without opposition through undefended territory. Although perhaps 100,000 Germans managed to escape, 10,000 were killed and another 40,000–50,000 were captured.

===Plot against Hitler, and death===
Through Carl-Heinrich von Stülpnagel, Kluge was aware of the 20 July plot against Hitler; he agreed to support the conspirators&#x27; seizure of power if Hitler was killed. In Paris, the conspirators arrested over 1,200 SS and SD members, and after the assassination attempt failed, Stülpnagel and Caesar von Hofacker met with Kluge at his headquarters in La Roche-Guyon. Having already learned of Hitler&#x27;s survival, Kluge withdrew his support and rescinded the arrest warrants.

On 15 August, Kluge&#x27;s car was damaged in an Allied bombing and he was cut off from all contact with his forces for several hours. Hitler immediately suspected Kluge of negotiating with the Allies. He was dismissed two days later and replaced by Model. When he was recalled to Berlin for a meeting with Hitler, Kluge was convinced he had been implicated in the 20 July plot and opted to commit suicide on 19 August using potassium cyanide. In his final testimony, he affirmed his loyalty to Hitler and expressed the view that Germany needed to end the war, writing that &quot;the German people have undergone such untold suffering that it is time to put an end to this frightfulness.&quot;

<text>International rules football (; also known as international rules in Australia and compromise rules or Aussie rules in Ireland) is a team sport consisting of a hybrid of football codes, which was developed to facilitate international representative matches between Australian rules football players and Gaelic football players.

The first tour, known as the Australian Football World Tour, took place in 1967, with matches played in Ireland, the United Kingdom, and the United States. The following year, games were played between Australia and a touring County Meath Gaelic football team, Meath being the reigning All-Ireland senior football champions. Following intermittent international tests between Australia and Ireland, the International Rules Series between the senior Australia international rules football team and Ireland international rules football team has been played intermittently since 1984, and has generally been a closely matched contest. The sport has raised interest and exposure in developing markets for Gaelic and Australian football and has been considered a development tool by governing bodies of both codes, particularly by the AFL Commission.

International rules football does not have any dedicated clubs or leagues. It is currently played by men&#x27;s, women&#x27;s, and junior teams only in tournaments or Test matches. The University of Birmingham in the United Kingdom holds an annual International Rules tournament between its Australian Rules and Gaelic Football teams.

==Rules==
===Overview===

The rules are designed to provide a compromise or combine between those of the two codes, with Gaelic football players being advantaged by the use of a round ball and a rectangular field measured about long by wide (Australian rules uses an oval ball and field), while the Australian rules football players benefit from the opportunity to tackle by grabbing between the shoulders and thighs and pulling to the ground, something banned in Gaelic football. The game also introduces the concept of the mark, from Australian rules football, with a free kick awarded for a ball caught from a kick of over , where the kick must be in the forward direction if originating from a teammate.
A player must bounce, solo (kick into one&#x27;s own hands) or touch the ball on the ground once every or six steps. A maximum of two bounces per possession are allowed, while players can solo the ball as often as they wish on a possession. Unlike in Gaelic football, the ball may be lifted directly off the ground, without putting a foot underneath it first. Players however cannot scoop the ball off the ground to a team-mate, nor pick up the ball if they are on their knees or on the ground. If a foul is committed, a free kick will be awarded, though referees (called umpires in Australian Rules) can give the fouled player advantage to play on at their discretion.

The game uses two large posts usually set apart, and connected above the ground by a crossbar with a goal net that could extend behind the goalposts and attached to the crossbar and lower goalposts, as in Gaelic football. A further apart on either side of those and not connected by a crossbar are 2 small posts, known as behind posts, as in Australian rules football.

Points are scored as follows:

* Under the crossbar and into the goal net (a goal): 6 points, umpire waves a green flag and raises both index fingers.
* Over the crossbar and between the two large posts (an over): 3 points, umpire waves red flag and raises one arm above his head.
* Between either of the large posts and small posts (a behind): 1 point, umpire waves white flag and raises one index finger.

Scores are written so as to clarify how many of each type of score were made as well as, like Australian football, giving the total points score for each team; for example, if a team scores one goal, four overs and 10 behinds, the score is written as 1–4–10 (28), meaning one goal (six points) plus 4 overs (4 × 3 = 12 points) plus 10 behinds (10 × 1 = 10 points), for a total score of 28 points.

An international rules match lasts for 72 minutes (divided into four quarters of 18 minutes each). Inter-county Gaelic football matches go on for 70 minutes, divided into two halves, while Australian rules matches consist of four 20-minute quarters of game time (although with the addition of stoppage time, most quarters actually last around 30 minutes).

As in Gaelic football, teams consist of fifteen players, including a goalkeeper, whereas eighteen are used in Australian rules (with no keeper).

===Alterations===
A number of rule changes were introduced before the 2006 International Rules Series:

* Match time reduced from 80 minutes to 72 minutes. Time per quarter was reduced from 20 minutes to 18 minutes.
* A player who received a red card is to be sent off, and no replacement is allowed; in addition to this, a penalty is awarded regardless of where the incident takes place. (Previously, a replacement &quot;was&quot; allowed and a penalty was only awarded if the incident happened in the penalty area.)
* A yellow card now means a 15-minute sin bin for the offending player, who will be sent off if he receives a second card.

Further alterations were made before the 2008 International Rules Series:
* Maximum of 10 interchanges per quarter.
* Teams are allowed only four consecutive hand passes (ball must then be kicked).

* The goalkeeper can no longer kick the ball to himself from the kick-out.
* Suspensions may carry over to GAA and AFL matches if the Match Review Panel sees fit.
* A dangerous &quot;slinging&quot; tackle will be an automatic red card.
* A front-on bump (known as a shirtfront in Australian football) endangering the head will result in a red card.
* Physical intimidation can result in a yellow card.
* The keeper cannot be tackled or touched when the keeper is charging.
* An independent referee can cite players for reportable offences from the stands.
* Yellow card sin bin reduced to 10 minutes.

The most recent changes were made ahead of the 2014 International Rules Series:
* Maximum number of interchanges per quarter increased from 10 to 16.
* Unlimited number of interchanges allowed at quarter and half time breaks.
* Number of consecutive hand-passes teams are allowed increased from 4 to 6.
* Marks will not be paid for backwards kicks caught by a teammate.
* Goalkeepers required to kick the ball out beyond the 45 m line after all wides, behinds and overs.
* Failure of a goalkeeper to kick over the 45 m line will result in a free kick to the opposition (from the 45 m line).

==Around the world==
International rules has been played in various locations throughout North America and the Caribbean, Europe, Asia, and Australia and New Zealand between fledgling Australian rules football and Gaelic football clubs.

In 2006, an exhibition match between South African youth teams and an Indigenous Australian touring side composed of players from the Clontarf Foundation, led by Sydney&#x27;s Adam Goodes, was held at Potchefstroom.

The University of Birmingham holds an annual International Rules match between its Australian Rules football team and its Gaelic Football team, with the 2013 edition won by the Australian Rules team 56–55, before a crowd of over 400 students.

In the International Rules Series, the most well-known International Rules event, Australia and Ireland are at an impasse, with 10 series wins apiece. Most recently in 2017, Australia defeated Ireland with two Test wins and an aggregate score of 116–103.

===Amateur tours===
The Australian Amateur Football Council has sent an amateur Under-23 All-Australian team to Ireland in both 2005 and 2008. The Australian amateur team wore a different jersey to the AFL representative side, dark green and gold, with a kangaroo emblem. Recently, the Victorian Amateur Football Association (VAFA) has sent a squad of players sourced from the top six divisions of its competition to tour Ireland and play various clubs and representative teams.

So-called &quot;masters&quot; series featuring teams made up of players aged 40 and above and Ladies&#x27; series, unsanctioned by the AFL and GAA, have sporadically been played. In 2024 an over-40 men&#x27;s, over-50 men&#x27;s and over-40 women&#x27;s series was played in and won comprehensively by Ireland, and featured former AFL player Jason Akermanis as head coach of one of the Australian teams.

<text>Qatar observes several public holidays. The two weekend days are Friday and Saturday, similarly to many other Islamic countries. Annual public holidays include:

Several holidays are celebrated by the government or banks as well. In 2009, Cabinet Decision No. 33 was passed by the Emir, decreeing the first Sunday in March as an official holiday for all financial institutions in Qatar.

==Holidays==
===Ramadan===

Ramadan, the ninth and most revered month of the Islamic calendar, holds profound significance for Muslims worldwide. It is a period marked by fasting. Throughout this sacred time, adherents abstain from food and drink from sunrise to sunset, demonstrating a commitment to self-discipline and devotion. In Qatar, the commencement and culmination of Ramadan are determined by the Moon Sighting Committee within the Ministry of Awqaf and Islamic Affairs. This committee observes the crescent moon, signaling both the conclusion of Ramadan and the onset of Eid al-Fitr, the festival of breaking the fast. The variability of lunar months, lasting between 29 and 30 days, underscores the dynamic nature of Ramadan&#x27;s timing, with its start date shifting approximately ten days earlier each year.

Preceding the commencement of fasting, Qataris engage in preparatory rituals and communal gatherings, exemplified by the observance of Sha&#x27;ban, the month preceding Ramadan, with &quot;al naflah&quot; festivities. Families come together to share traditional meals, such as &quot;harees&quot; and &quot;tharid&quot; with neighbors and the less fortunate. Prayer songs are also sung on this occasion. During Ramadan, Qatar&#x27;s cities are adorned with festive decorations and hosts several pre-fasting celebrations. Hotels, restaurants, and cultural venues hold special events and offer promotions.

The daily fast commences at sunrise, following the consumption of suhur, the pre-dawn meal designed to sustain individuals throughout the day. Iftar is the meal marking the fast&#x27;s conclusion at sunset and typically begins with the consumption of dates. This is accompanied by the traditional firing of a Ramadan cannon, a practice steeped in historical significance. This tradition, continuing to this day in Qatar, is broadcast live on national television and can be observed at various locations such as Souq Waqif, Katara Cultural Village and Imam Muhammad ibn Abd al-Wahhab Mosque. Post-iftar, the city bustles with activity as businesses and cultural venues reopen after daytime closures. Tarawih prayers are held in mosques following the evening prayer (&quot;Isha&quot;) to complete the recitation of the Qur&#x27;an by the conclusion of Ramadan.

&quot;Al Ghabqa&quot; is a feast that takes place at night during Ramadan following iftar and tarawih prayers, traditionally shared between immediate family members. The feast features a variety of dishes, notably grilled and fried fish, rice cooked with date extract, and &quot;tharid&quot;—a meal combining crumbled bread, meat, and broth. The feat also includes an assortment of sweets such as luqaimat and asida, alongside dates, tea, and Arabic coffee.

In previous times, &quot;al-musaharati&quot; roamed the &quot;farjan&quot; (neighborhoods) during the month of Ramadan, beating his drum to wake people up for suhur. This drumming would be accompanied by Islamic chants, such as &quot;Wake up sleeper to worship the creator.&quot; Once common in the country, this tradition is rarely practiced nowadays, though there has been a revival in recent years.

===Garangao===

Garangao is a traditional celebration observed on the 15th night of Ramadan, marking its midpoint. Rooted in the Islamic calendar, the festival is derived from the Arabic word &quot;garqaa,&quot; signifying a rattling or shaking motion. Celebrated throughout the Middle East, Garangao has many regional variants and holds cultural and historical significance. On Garangao night, children don colorful traditional attire and visit homes in their neighborhoods, singing traditional songs and receiving sweets and gifts from residents. In the past, snacks such as malabas, walnuts, almonds, and chickpeas were handed out to children. Nowadays, the treats mostly consist of various forms of candy and nuts. This exchange symbolizes the spirit of generosity central to the holy month of Ramadan. The festival is also characterized by unique songs sung by children, invoking blessings for health and prosperity upon the youngest members of families. In contemporary times, Garangao has evolved into a larger-scale celebration, with public events organized in shopping malls, mosques, and cultural organizations.

===Eid===

Eid festivities in Qatar hold a distinct place in the cultural tapestry, marking the culmination of significant dates in the Islamic lunar calendar. The two key holidays are Eid al-Fitr and Eid al-Adha. Eid al-Fitr, which means the &quot;festivity of breaking the fast&quot;, takes place on the first day of the tenth month post-Ramadan. This event denotes the conclusion of fasting and promotes acts of philanthropy, with Qatari households graciously donating to various causes. This nationwide holiday witnesses day-time closures of educational institutions, offices, and commercial establishments. Lively exhibitions and participatory happenings take place at shopping centers and public arenas. Applying henna is customary for Qatari women during Eid al-Fitr. The inaugural Eid Al-Fitr Festival, organized by Qatar Tourism, was launched on 4 May 2022 and lasted for three days. Celebrations were held on the Doha Corniche featuring performances from Qatari and Arab musicians. It is estimated that about 10,000 to 15,000 spectators attended the festivities each day.

Eid al-Adha, known as the &quot;celebration of sacrifice&quot;, aligns with the conclusion of Hajj, the pilgrimage to Mecca. This solemn event, observed on the tenth day of Dhu al-Hijja, commemorates the narrative of Prophet Ibrahim&#x27;s sacrificial act. Families convene for prayers and feasts, echoing the essence of unity and devotion portrayed in the Quranic narrative. Traditional customs entail the dispensation of meat from sacrificial beasts to kinfolk and the underprivileged.

Throughout Eid festivities, children eagerly traverse neighborhoods, exuberantly exchanging greetings and collecting their &quot;Eidiyah&quot; – a customary monetary gift. This treasured practice heightens the festive ambiance as youngsters recite folk songs and phrases while going door to door. Eid salutations like &quot;Eid Mubarak&quot; and &quot;Eid Saeed&quot; impart blessings and joy, while &quot;Kul &#x27;am wa enta bi-khair&quot; extends wishes for robust health and prosperity.

===Hayya Bayya===
&quot;Hayya Bayya&quot; is a Qatari tradition dating back several centuries that is practiced by girls aged 8 to 12 years old on the Day of Arafah, the ninth day of Dhu al-Hijja in the Islamic calendar, which precedes Eid al-Adha. It is named after &quot;Dracaena trifasciata&quot;, commonly known as the snake plant in English and &quot;hayya bayya&quot; in Qatar, alternatively spelled &quot;hia bia&quot;. In Bedouin society, while young boys were traditionally engaged in manual labor and slaughtering animals in the months leading up to Eid al-Adha, such work was not expected of young girls; thus, they used their time to take care of and nurture plants, particularly the snake plant, but could also include grains like wheat and barley. These plants would be grown in small wicker baskets made of palm fronds. These baskets were nurtured and grown for about eight days or more, starting from the first day of Dhu al-Hijja. They would then be tossed into the sea at sunset on the Day of Arafah, symbolizing the larger sacrifices associated with Eid al-Adha.

During this ceremonial sacrifice, the girls dress in traditional attire, such as the &quot;al bakhnaq&quot; embroidered with zari thread, and perform songs specific to the occasion, such as praying to God to make their Eid joyous and for the safe return of pilgrims from Hajj. This historically provided an alternative form of participation in the festive aspects of Eid al-Adha for girls. The practice continues to be promoted and practiced by cultural institutions.

===Majlis Al Oud===
On the first day of Eid al-Fitr, families hold large feasts in what is known as &quot;Great Majlis&quot; or &quot;Majlis Al Oud&quot;. During this event, it customary for the men of the family to congratulate their leader on the feast.

===Qatar National Day===

Qatar National Day, also known as &quot;Founders Day&quot;, celebrates the day that Jassim bin Mohammed Al Thani succeeded his father, Mohammed bin Thani as ruler of the Qatari Peninsula and unified the tribes. He also earned a considerable degree of autonomy for the tribes of the peninsula. In anticipation of National Day, Qataris adorn their vehicles and homes with national symbols. The day is marked by various activities and events. The National Day&#x27;s significance is further emphasized through annual slogans derived from the poems of Sheikh Jassim.

Celebrations culminate in a grand parade along the Corniche, featuring military displays, cultural performances, and aerial shows. Daytime fireworks and evening displays illuminate the sky, accompanied by Qatari heritage music. Additional festivities, including classic car displays and children&#x27;s activities, take place on the Doha Corniche, Souq Waqif and Katara Cultural Village.

===Darb Al Saai===

The Darb Al Saai festival, organized by Qatar&#x27;s Ministry of Culture, is held annually in early December. The event runs daily for several days until the commencement of Qatar National Day on December 18 and aims to showcase the nation&#x27;s cultural heritage and national identity. The name translates to &quot;route of the messenger&quot; in Arabic, and is related to the path taken by Sheikh Jassim bin Mohammed Al Thani&#x27;s messengers relaying his directives.

Activities include the ceremonial flag-raising at Flag Square, accompanied by military performances and displays, including horse and camel-mounted contingents, and local musicians&#x27; live performances of sea music. The event also features exhibitions that delve into Qatar&#x27;s past ways of life, traditional crafts, and folklore. Workshops offer hands-on experiences in wool weaving, tent fabric-making, bird photography, and creative activities for all ages. Educational workshops are also offered for both children and adults, such as Al Shaqab&#x27;s seminar on Arabian horses at the 2023 edition, and the Ministry of Culture&#x27;s workshops on falconry and camel riding.

Spanning a 150,000 square-meter area in Umm Salal Mohammed (as of 2022), the venue&#x27;s unique design blends traditional Qatari architecture with modern elements. Three arterial roads provide access to the venue, as well as the Doha Metro&#x27;s Green Line. Prior to being relocated to Umm Salal Mohammed, the festival was held in the Al Sadd district of Doha. Several commercial establishments are found at Darb Al Saai Market, all with traditional names and selling local souvenirs, clothing and cuisine, including several cafés offering Arabic coffee.

Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the 2020 edition of the Darb Al Saai was canceled. The 2021 edition was also canceled as the new primary venue for festivities in Umm Salal Mohammed would not be ready until 2022. Instead, several small-scall activities preceding Qatar National Day at multiple venues were planned for that year.

===National Sports Day===
Qatar&#x27;s National Sports Day, observed every second Tuesday of February, features a variety of activities promoting fitness and well-being. With the inaugural edition taking place in 2012, this event promotes sports on a local level and advocates for a healthier lifestyle among residents and visitors alike. It stands as a recognized national holiday in Qatar.

The establishment of Qatar&#x27;s Sports Day distinguishes the country as one of the few to allocate a day solely dedicated to sports. The closure of educational facilities, offices, and commercial establishments on this occasion fosters widespread participation in physical endeavors. Various events catering to individuals of all ages and abilities take place at venues such as Education City, Aspire Park, and the Doha Corniche. In collaboration with the Qatar Olympic Committee and the Ministry of Sports and Youth, the day features an array of activities, including races, yoga, golf, team sports, and educational workshops, complemented by appearances from renowned sports personalities.

<doc id="787723" wikidata="Q57198" url="?curid=787723" title="Wilhelm List">
<text>Wilhelm List (14 May 1880 – 17 August 1971) was a German &quot;Generalfeldmarschall&quot; (Field Marshal) during World War II who was convicted of war crimes by a US Army tribunal after the war. List commanded the 14th Army in the invasion of Poland and the 12th Army in the invasions of France, Yugoslavia and Greece. In 1941 he commanded the German forces in Southeast Europe responsible for the occupation of Greece and Yugoslavia. In July 1942 during Case Blue, the German summer offensive in Southern Russia, he was appointed commander of Army Group A, responsible for the main thrust towards the Caucasus and Baku.

Following the war, List was charged with war crimes and crimes against humanity and stood trial in the Hostages Trial of 1947. He was convicted and sentenced to life imprisonment. List was released early for poor health and died in 1971.

== Early years ==
List, born in Oberkirchberg in Württemberg in 1880, the son of a physician. He entered the Bavarian Army in 1898; in 1913 he joined the Bavarian General Staff.
He served as a staff officer in World War I (1914-1918). List spent four years at the front as commander of an infantry regiment, where he had as one of his subordinates then Corporal Adolf Hitler. After the war, List stayed in the Reichswehr. In 1922, he became commander of an Alpine battalion. Called to the Defense Ministry in 1926, he was made director of military education, later commander of Dresden Infantry School. By 1932, he was promoted to Generalleutnant. In 1938, after the &quot;Anschluss&quot; of Austria with Germany, List had the task of integrating the Austrian Armed Forces into the Wehrmacht.

==World War II==
In 1939, List commanded the German 14th Army in the invasion of Poland. It was List&#x27;s task to advance his army into southern Poland immediately at the start of the invasion, to form the extreme southern wing of an encircling manoeuver carried out by the German forces aimed at trapping the Polish field army in the general region of Warsaw. He didn&#x27;t fulfill this mission, although he met advance elements of the German XIX Panzer Corps under General Heinz Guderian a short distance south of Brest-Litovsk, on 17 September 1939. Following the conclusion of the fighting in Poland, which was accelerated by the occupation of the eastern part of the country by Soviet forces (as agreed to in the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact), List and his army remained posted in Poland as occupying forces.

===Invasion of France===
During the huge German offensive against France and the Low Countries May to June 1940, the 14th army remained in Poland, but this was not the case with its commander. In May 1940 List commanded the 12th German army during the fall of France. The 12th army was a unit of the German Army Group A, under command of Gerd von Rundstedt. It was this Army Group that successfully forced the Ardennes and then made the imperative break-through on 15 May 1940, which spread panic in the French forces and cut the British expeditionary forces off from their supply lines.

After this successful campaign List was among the twelve generals that Hitler promoted to Field Marshal during the 1940 Field Marshal Ceremony. In early 1941, German troops were being steadily massed on the Eastern Front of the Third &quot;Reich&quot;, in preparation for Operation Barbarossa, the German invasion of the Soviet Union. OKW believed that before Barbarossa could be launched it would be necessary to eliminate the possibility of interference from Greece by militarily subduing this country, in an operation codenamed Operation Marita. List was delegated to negotiate with the Bulgarian General Staff, and a secret agreement was signed allowing the free passage of German troops through Bulgarian territory. On the night of 28/29 February 1941, German troops—including List, who now commanded the 12th Army—took up positions in Bulgaria, which the next day joined the Tripartite Pact.

===Invasion of Greece and Yugoslavia===
On 6 April 1941 the Wehrmacht launched invasions both of Greece and of Yugoslavia. List&#x27;s 12th Army, consisting of four armored divisions and 11 motorized infantry divisions, totally outmatched the defending forces. German forces occupied Belgrade on 13 April and Athens on 27 April. The mainland Balkans campaign ended with the evacuation of British forces on 28 April. In the Balkans List became implicated in the mass murder of hundreds of thousands of civilians by having ordered hostage-taking and reprisal killings.

===Summer campaign of 1942 and dismissal===
In early July 1942, List took command of Army Group A, newly formed from the split of Army Group South during the Germans’ summer offensive named Case Blue. His orders were to take Rostov and then advance into the Caucasus to take oil rich areas of Maikop and Grozny. German forces made good progress for two months, taking Maikop and almost to Grozny, about from Rostov.

However, by the end of August their advance had ground to a halt, chiefly due to considerably stiffened Soviet resistance, and also due to critical shortages of fuel and ammunition as the army group outran its supply lines. Matters were made worse for the Germans by the removal in mid-August of most &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; combat units to the north to support the 6th Army’s drive on Stalingrad.

Hitler was angered by the loss of momentum. He sent Alfred Jodl on 7 September to visit List and tell him to make faster progress. List explained to Jodl that he didn&#x27;t have enough forces to break through the Soviet lines to capture Grozny. List also believed that it was still possible to capture Grozny if all the other attacks were suspended and his army group was given priority in supplies and reinforcements. Jodl subsequently agreed with List and he relayed this information to Hitler, who became furious. When List proposed moving some stalled spearhead units to another, less advanced portion of the front to assist in destroying stubborn Soviet forces, Hitler relieved him of command on 9 September and tried to command the Army Group himself from OKH. On 22 November 1942, he placed Paul Ludwig Ewald von Kleist in charge. List spent the rest of the war at his home and never returned to active duty.

==Hostages trial==
List was arrested by the Allies after the war. In 1947, List and 11 former subordinates were charged with war crimes and crimes against humanity—primarily the reprisal killing of Serbian hostages in Yugoslavia. List was tried in front of a U.S. military court in the Hostages Trial, convicted and sentenced to life imprisonment in February 1948. List was released from prison in December 1952, officially because of ill health. However, he lived for another 19 years, dying on 17 August 1971 at the age of 91.

<text>Karel Cornelia Constantijn Dillen (16 October 1925 – 27 April 2007) was a Belgian far-right, Flemish nationalist politician who served as a Member of the European Parliament from 1994 to 2004.

==Life==
According to Paul Beliën, editor of The Brussels Journal, &quot;Dillen came from a non-political background. His father, an Antwerp labourer, abandoned his wife and their two sons when Dillen was still a baby. He was raised by his mother. Neither he, nor his brother nor his mother were involved in any political activities at all during the war...&quot;

In 1977 he established the Vlaams Nationale Partij (Flemish National Party), which became Vlaams Blok at the elections of 1978. He was president of Vlaams Blok (later reformed as Vlaams Belang) until he appointed Frank Vanhecke as his successor in 1996.

Karel Dillen was a Member of the European Parliament (MEP) between 1994 and 2004, and vice-chairman of the Technical Fraction of the European Right, together with among others Jean-Marie Le Pen and Franz Schönhuber.

Dillen&#x27;s daughter Marijke Dillen is also active in Belgian politics.

==Holocaust denial==
Karel Dillen had a history of associating with far-right figures. Though he was not an active Nazi collaborator during the Second World War himself, he described himself as a &quot;passive&quot; collaborator. He also translated in 1951 the pamphlet (&quot;Nuremberg or the Promised Land&quot;), a Holocaust denial book by Maurice Bardèche. Afterwards, Dillen maintained regular contact with the author. The book states that the Nazi concentration camps were mock-ups built with the help of Hollywood after World War II.

<doc id="787748" wikidata="Q2004691" url="?curid=787748" title="Backcrossing">
<text>Backcrossing is a crossing of a hybrid with one of its parents or an individual genetically similar to its parent, to achieve offspring with a genetic identity closer to that of the parent. It is used in horticulture, animal breeding, and production of gene knockout organisms.

Backcrossed hybrids are sometimes described with acronym &quot;BC&quot;; for example, an F1 hybrid crossed with one of its parents (or a genetically similar individual) can be termed a BC1 hybrid, and a further cross of the BC1 hybrid to the same parent (or a genetically similar individual) produces a BC2 hybrid.

==Plants==

===Advantages===
* If the recurrent parent is an elite genotype, at the end of the backcrossing programme, an elite genotype is recovered.
* As no &quot;new&quot; recombination results, the elite combination is not lost.

===Disadvantages===
* It works poorly for quantitative traits.
* It is more restricted for recessive traits.
* In practice, sections of genome from the nonrecurrent parents are often still present and can have unwanted traits associated with them.
* For very wide crosses, limited recombination may maintain thousands of &quot;alien&quot; genes within the elite cultivar.
* Many backcrosses are required to produce a new cultivar, which can take many years.

===Natural backcrossings===
York radiate groundsel (&quot;Senecio eboracensis&quot;) is a naturally occurring hybrid species of Oxford ragwort (&quot;Senecio squalidus&quot;) and common groundsel (&quot;Senecio vulgaris&quot;). It is thought to have arisen from a backcrossing of the F1 hybrid with &quot;S. vulgaris&quot;.

Again, the pure tall (TT) and pure dwarf (tt) pea plants when crossed in the parental generation, produce all heterozygote (Tt) tall pea plants in the first filial generation. The cross between first filial heterozygote tall (Tt) pea plant and pure tall (TT) or pure dwarf (tt) pea plant of the parental generation is also an example for the back-crossing between two plants. In this case, the filial generation formed after the back cross may have a phenotype ratio of 1:1 if the cross is made with recessive parent or else all offspring may be having phenotype of dominant trait if the backcross is with a parent having the dominant trait. The former of these traits is also called a test cross.

===Artificially recombinant lines===
In plants, the term inbred backcross line (IBL) refers to a line (i.e. population) of plants derived from the repeated backcrossing of a line with artificially recombinant DNA with the wild type, operating some kind of selection that can be phenotypical or through a molecular marker (for the production of an introgression line).

==Animals==

Backcrossing may be deliberately employed in animals to transfer a desirable trait in an animal of inferior genetic background to an animal of preferable genetic background. In gene-knockout experiments in particular, where the knockout is performed on easily cultured stem cell lines, but is required in an animal with a different genetic background, the knockout animal is backcrossed against the animal of the required genetic background. As the figure shows, each time that the mouse with the desired trait (in this case the lack of a gene (i.e. a knockout), indicated by the presence of a positive selectable marker) is crossed with a mouse of a constant genetic background, the average percentage of the genetic material of the offspring that is derived from that constant background increases. The result, after sufficient reiterations, is an animal with the desired trait in the desired genetic background, with the percentage of genetic material from the original stem cells reduced to a minimum (on the order of 0.01%).

Due to the nature of meiosis, in which chromosomes derived from each parent are randomly shuffled and assigned to each nascent gamete, the percentage of genetic material deriving from either cell line varies between offspring of a single crossing, but will have an expected value. The genotype of each member of offspring may be assessed to choose not only an individual that carries the desired genetic trait, but also the minimum percentage of genetic material from the original stem cell line.
A consomic strain is an inbred strain with one of its chromosomes replaced by the homologous chromosome of another inbred strain via a series of marker-assisted backcrosses.

<text>Captain Tugg was the host of a local children&#x27;s cartoon show that was broadcast in the early 1960s by WTTG, Channel 5, a Washington, D.C. television station. Captain Tugg was the master of the &quot;Channel Queen&quot;, a tugboat that plied the Potomac River, near the capital city. With his parrot, Fantail (a puppet), he fought spies Spike Marlin and Axel Grackle and the Sea Hag. Lee Reynolds, the actor who played Tugg, also played Commander Salamander and a number of other characters on the show. His skits and adlibbed lines were sandwiched between animated cartoons. On Christmas Eve, the captain would use his onboard radar to track Santa&#x27;s progress as he made his international rounds.

<text>Hugo Wilhelm Sperrle (7 February 1885 – 2 April 1953) was a German military aviator in World War I and a &quot;Generalfeldmarschall&quot; (Field Marshal) in the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; during World War II.

Sperrle joined the Imperial German Army in 1903. He served in the artillery upon the outbreak of World War I. In 1914 he joined the Luftstreitkräfte as an observer then trained as a pilot. Sperrle ended the war at the rank of &quot;Hauptmann&quot; (Captain) in command of an aerial reconnaissance attachment of a field army.

In the inter-war period Sperrle was appointed to the General Staff in the &quot;Reichswehr&quot;, serving the Weimar Republic in the aerial warfare branch. In 1934 after the Nazi Party seized power, Sperrle was promoted to &quot;Generalmajor&quot; (Brigadier
General) and transferred from the army to the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot;. Sperrle was given command of the Condor Legion in November 1936 and fought with the expeditionary force in the Spanish Civil War until October 1937.

Sperrle was appointed as commanding officer of &quot;Luftwaffengruppenkommando&quot; 3 (Air Force Group Command 3) the forerunner of &quot;Luftflotte&quot; 3 (Air Fleet 3) in February 1938. Sperrle was used during the &quot;Anschluss&quot; and Czech crisis by the Nazi leadership to threaten other governments with bombardment. Sperrle attended several important meetings with Austrian and Czech leaders for this purpose upon the invitation of Adolf Hitler.

In September 1939 World War II began with the invasion of Poland. Sperrle and his air fleet served exclusively on the Western Front. He played a crucial role in the Battle of France and Battle of Britain in 1940. In 1941 Sperrle directed operations during The Blitz over Britain. From mid-1941 his air fleet became the sole command in the west. Through 1941 and 1942 he defended German-occupied Europe against the Royal Air Force, as well as the United States Army Air Forces from 1943. Sperrle&#x27;s command was depleted in the battles of attrition forced on him by the Combined Bomber Offensive.

By mid-1944, Sperrle&#x27;s air fleet had been reduced to impotence and it could not repel the Allied landings in Western Europe. As a consequence, Sperrle was dismissed to the &quot;Führerreserve&quot; and never held a senior command again. On 1 May 1945 he was captured by the British. After the war, he was charged with war crimes at the High Command Trial but was acquitted. Sperrle was involved in the bribery of senior Wehrmacht officers.

==Early life and World War I==
Sperrle was born in the town of Ludwigsburg, in the Kingdom of Württemberg, German Empire on 7 February 1885 the son of a brewery proprietor, Johannes Sperrle and his wife Luise Karoline, née Nägele. He joined the Imperial German Army on 5 July 1903 as a &quot;Fahnenjunker&quot; (officer cadet). Sperrle was assigned to the 8th Württemberg Infantry Regiment (&quot;Großherzog Friedrich von Baden&quot; Nr. 126), a regiment in the Army of Württemberg, and after a year received his commission and promotion to &quot;Leutnant&quot; on 28 October 1912. Sperrle served another year until his promotion to &quot;Oberleutnant&quot; (second lieutenant) in October 1913.

At the outbreak of World War I, Sperrle was training as an artillery spotter in the &quot;Luftstreitkräfte&quot; (German Army Air Service). On 28 November 1914 Sperrle was promoted to Hauptmann. Sperrle did not distinguish himself in battle as his fellow staff officers in World War II had done, but he forged a solid record in the aerial reconnaissance field.

Sperrle served first as an observer, then trained as a pilot with the 4th Field Flying Detachment (&quot;Feldfliegerabteilung&quot;) at the &quot;Kriegsakademie&quot; (War Academy). Sperrle went on to command the 42nd and 60th Field Flying Detachments, then led the 13th Field Flying Group. After suffering severe injuries in a crash,
Sperrle moved to the air observer school at Cologne thereafter and when the war ended he was in command of flying units attached to the 7th Army. For his command he was awarded the House Order of Hohenzollern with Swords.

==Inter-war years==

Sperrle joined the &quot;Freikorps&quot; and commanded an aviation detachment. He then joined the &quot;Reichswehr&quot;. Sperrle commanded units in Silesia including the &quot;Freiwilligen Fliegerabteilungen&quot; 412 under the leadership of Erhard Milch. Sperrle fought on the East Prussia border during the 1919 conflict with Poland. He assumed command on 9 January 1919.

On 1 December 1919, commander-in-chief of the German army, Hans von Seeckt issued a directive for the creation of 57 committees, encompassing all the military branches, to compile detailed studies of German war experiences. Helmuth Wilberg led the air service sector and Sperrle was one of 83 commanders ordered to assist. The air staff studies were conducted through 1920.

===General Staff===
Sperrle served on the air staff for &quot;Wehrkreis&quot; V (Military District 5) in Stuttgart from 1919 to 1923, then the Defence Ministry until 1924. Sperrle then served on the staff of the 4th Infantry Division near Dresden. Sperrle travelled to Lipetsk in the Soviet Union at this time, where the Germans maintained a secret air base and founded the Lipetsk fighter-pilot school. Sperrle purportedly visited the United Kingdom to observe Royal Air Force exercises. At Lipetsk, Hugo Sperrle and Kurt Student acted as senior directors which trained some 240 German pilots between 1924 and 1932.

The air staff remained small, but Sperrle&#x27;s contingent were present in the 4,000 officers retained in the military. In 1927 Sperrle, at the rank of &quot;Major&quot;, replaced Wilberg as head of the air staff at the &quot;Waffenamt&quot; an &quot;Truppenamt&quot; (Weapons and Troop Office). Sperrle was selected for his expertise in technical matters; he was seen as highly qualified staff officer with combat experience in commanding the flying units of the 7th army during the war. On 1 February 1929 Sperrle was replaced with Hellmuth Felmy. Sperrle&#x27;s departure came as he was pressing for an autonomous aviation authority. Felmy persisted, and on 1 October 1929, the &quot;Inspektion der Waffenschulen und der Luftwaffe&quot; came into existence under the command of Major General Hilmar von Mittelberger—it was the first use of the term &quot;Luftwaffe&quot;. By 1 November 1930, the embryonic air headquarters could count 168 aviation officers including Sperrle.

Sperrle was promoted to &quot;Oberstleutnant&quot; (lieutenant colonel) in 1931 while commanding the 3rd battalion, 14th Infantry Regiment from 1929 to 1933. Sperrle ended his army career in command of the 8th Infantry Regiment, from 1 October 1933 to 1 April 1934. At the rank of &quot;Oberst&quot; (colonel), Sperrle was given command of the headquarters of the First Air Division (&quot;Fliegerdivision&quot; 1). Sperrle was given responsibility for coordinating army support aviation. Sperrle&#x27;s official title was &quot;Kommandeur der Heeresflieger&quot; (Commander of Army Flyers). After Adolf Hitler and the Nazi Party seized power, Hermann Göring created a Reich Air Ministry. Göring handed most of the squadrons in existence to Sperrle because of his command experiences.

Sperrle was involved in the difficulties in German aircraft procurement. Four months after assuming command, Sperrle was rigorously critical of the Dornier Do 11 and Dornier Do 13 in a conference on 18 July 1934. Five months later, with development failing, Sperrle met with Wolfram Freiherr von Richthofen, head of aircraft development and &quot;Luftkreis&quot; IV commander Alfred Keller, a wartime bomber pilot. It was decided Junkers Ju 52 production would be a stopgap, while the Dornier Do 23 reached units in the late summer, 1935. The awaited Junkers Ju 86 was scheduled for testing in November 1934 and the promising Heinkel He 111 in February 1935. Richthofen remarked, &quot;it is better to have second-rate equipment than none at all&quot;, though he was responsible for bringing in the next generation of aircraft.

On 1 March 1935, Hermann Göring announced the existence of the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot;. Sperrle was transferred to the Reich Air Ministry. Sperrle was initially given command of &quot;Luftkreis&quot; II (Air District II), and then &quot;Luftkreis&quot; V in Münich upon his promotion to &quot;Generalmajor&quot; (Brigadier General) on 1 October 1935. Sperrle remained in Germany until the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War. He commanded all German forces in Spain from November 1936 to November 1937.

===Condor Legion===
Sperrle was the first commander of the Condor Legion during the Spanish Civil War. The Legion was a corps of German airmen sent to provide support to General Franco who led the Nationalists, against their enemies, the left-wing Republicans. Sperrle was given command of all German forces earmarked for operations in Spain on his appointment. On 1 November 1936 the Legion totalled 4,500 men and by January 1937 the organisation had grown to 6,000 men. The volunteers were interchanged over the course of the conflict, allowing for the maximum number to gain combat experience.

Wolfram Freiherr von Richthofen was assigned to Sperrle as chief of staff, replacing Alexander Holle. Sperrle needed a highly competent man with a staff officer background. Sperrle had the advantage of knowing Richthofen since the 1920s and thought highly of his chief of staff. Sperrle privately viewed Richthofen as a ruthless snob, and Richthofen disliked his superior&#x27;s coarse wit and table manners. Professionally, they had few disagreements, and Richthofen&#x27;s good relationship with Franco encouraged Sperrle to leave day-to-day affairs in his hands.

Sperrle and Richthofen made an effective team in Spain. Sperrle was experienced, intelligent with a good reputation. Richthofen was considered a good combat leader. They combined to advise and oppose Franco to prevent the misuse of their air power. Both men were blunt with the Spanish leader and although the Germans and Spanish did not like each other, they developed a healthy respect which translated into an effective working relationship. Richthofen and Sperrle agreed German support should be limited, for Franco&#x27;s rule would not be perceived as legitimate if he received lavish foreign aid. Their view was reported to Berlin.

Sperrle was assisted by the &quot;Oberkommando der Luftwaffe&quot; (OKL—High Command of the Air Force). Staff officers were trained to solve operational level problems and the OKL&#x27;s reluctance to micromanage gave Sperrle and Richthofen a free hand to devise solutions to tactical and operational problems. An important step was the development of ground-air communication, via the use of frontline signals posts which were in contact with army and airbases simultaneously. Information telephoned to airbases was relayed rapidly by radio to aircraft in flight. This innovation was put into practice during the conflict.

Sperrle left Germany by air on 31 October 1936 and arrived in Seville, via Rome on 5 November. Sperrle was sent a &quot;Kampfgruppe&quot; (bomber group—K/88), &quot;Jagdgruppe&quot; 88 (fighter group 88—J/88) and &quot;Aufklärungsstaffel&quot; (reconnaissance squadron—AS/88). They were supported by a &quot;Flak Abteilung&quot; (F/88) with three heavy and two light batteries with communications, transport and maintenance units. The Germans could not afford to fully equip the Legion, and so the air group made use of Spanish equipment. Of the 1,500 vehicles used, there were 100 types creating a maintenance nightmare. The first mission for the Legion was to airlift 20,000 men of the African Army. These veterans, once landed, provided a core of battle–hardened veterans.

===Spanish Civil War===
Sperrle began the war with 120 aircraft, and for the first four months the German aviators failed to make an impact. Sperrle lost 20 percent of his strength in the failed attempt to seize Madrid in 1936. The material support provided was inadequate and left him with just 26 Ju 52s and two Heinkel He 70 aircraft by the end of January 1937. Sperrle&#x27;s personal leadership and the dedication of senior officers prevented a collapse in morale. The cause of this defeat was the appearance of Soviet-designed and built Polikarpov I-15 and Polikarpov I-16 fighter aircraft in the Spanish Republican Air Force which won air superiority. Bombing raids against Cartagena and Alicante, and the Soviet air base at Alcalá de Henares, failed. Sperrle personally led an attack against the Republican Navy at Cartagena, sinking two ships. The Republican fleet was forewarned, however, and the majority put to sea and escaped the bombing. Attacks against Madrid, in which 40 tons of bombs were dropped from 19 November 1936, also failed. The bombing and shelling inflicted 1,119 casualties between 14 and 23 November, including 244 dead—303 buildings were hit. The Legion&#x27;s bomber group temporarily gave up daylight bombing after the failed Fascist offensive.

Sperrle&#x27;s airmen switched to attacking choke-points around Madrid. Operations were complicated by the Sierra de Guadarrama and Sierra de Gredos mountain range. Pilots suffered from circulation problems in non-pressurised cockpits while flying close to the top of the peaks, but only one aircraft and five men were lost to the natural barriers. Influenza and pneumonia outbreaks due to poor living conditions continued to undermine morale. One of the main problems was the inadequate fighter aircraft. The Heinkel He 51 was not up to the job, Sperrle requested Berlin send modern aircraft. In December three Messerschmitt Bf 109 fighters were in Spain, only to return the following February, followed by a single Heinkel He 112 prototype, and Junkers Ju 87 dive-bomber. Richthofen travelled to Berlin to secure more of these types in agreement with chief of staff Albert Kesselring, Ernst Udet, and Milch. Sperrle&#x27;s command began receiving the Dornier Do 17, He 111, Ju 86 bombers and Bf 109 fighters in January 1937. On 1 April 1937 Sperrle was promoted to &quot;Generalleutnant&quot; (Major General).

The Nationalists turned to destroying the Republican army enclave along the Bay of Biscay in the summer, 1937. Sperrle moved his headquarters to Vitoria to lead his small force of 62 aircraft. The Biscay Campaign began on 31 March with the Bombing of Durango. Spanish nationalists reported Republican army movements in the town, but before the bombers arrived they withdrew, leaving the bombers to devastate the town and kill 250 civilians. Sperrle protested to the Nationalists about the &quot;waste of resources&quot;, but his own authorised attacks on the town&#x27;s arms-factory were inaccurate and did just as much to damage the Legion&#x27;s image. Thereafter Sperrle supported the battle for Otxandio. The Nationalists refused to cooperate in an encirclement operation allowing the defenders to retreat toward Guernica. In a farcical moment Sperrle was arrested on a visit to the front by Nationalist forces as a suspected spy.

Sperrle&#x27;s staff had no file information on Guernica. Richthofen earmarked the town&#x27;s Rentaria Bridge for attack, but he seems to have been more interested in Guerricaiz six miles (10 km) south east of Guernica. Richthofen referred to this town as &quot;Guernicaiz&quot; in his diary. The Republican left flank had to retreat through Guernica and the air staff earmarked it for bombing. Richthofen&#x27;s diary entry, dated 26 April 1937, documented the purpose of the attack. His plan was to block the roads to the south and east of Guernica, thereby offering a chance to encircle and destroy Republican forces.

Later that day, 43 bombers dropped 50 tons of bombs on the town. The bombing has been controversial ever since. The attack, described by some as &quot;terror bombing&quot;, was not planned as an attack on the populace and there is no evidence the Germans targeted civilian morale. Guernica acted as an important transportation hub for 23 battalions in positions east of Bilbao. Two battalions—the 18th Loyala and Saseta—were in the town. The attack prevented the fortification of the Guernica and closed the roads to traffic for 24 hours, preventing Republican forces from evacuating their heavy equipment across the bridge. While there is no evidence civilians were targeted, 300 Spanish people died, and there is no record of any German air commanders expressing sympathy or concern for civilians in the vicinity of a military target. Sperrle was not reprimanded for Guernica.

The Condor Legion supported the Nationaists in the Battle of Bilbao and played a large role in defeating a Republican offensive in the Battle of Brunete, near Madrid. In attacking airfields, using the flak battalion on the front line, and committing the 20 Bf 109 fighters in the fighter escort role the Nationalists gained air superiority over the 400-strong Republican Air Force. The Nationalists destroyed 160 aircraft for the loss of 23. Sperrle&#x27;s men routed eight battalions of infantry and large numbers of tanks in the close air support and interdiction role. From this point on, the Legion possessed general air superiority and the flexibility to transfer rapidly to other fronts to support the land war.

Returning north, In August and September 1937 Sperrle&#x27;s legion assisted Franco&#x27;s victory at the Battle of Santander with only 68 aircraft—none of the Brunete losses had been replaced. The Republican reportedly lost 70,000 men captured. For the remainder of September the German command focused on the Asturias Offensive which ended the War in the North. Sperrle lost 12 aircraft and 22 men killed, amounting to 17.5 percent of his strength. The attacks, which faced opposition from only 45 Republican aircraft were effective and imposed up to 10 percent losses on some Republican infantry formations. Republican commander Adolfo Prada later stated the bombing had buried entire units in rubble.

In late 1937, Sperrle fought against the interference of Wilhelm Faupel, one of Adolf Hitler&#x27;s advisors in Spanish affairs. The dispute became so damaging, Hitler removed both men from their positions. Sperrle transferred command of the Condor Legion to &quot;Generalmajor&quot; Hellmuth Volkmann and returned to Germany on 30 October. On 1 November 1937 Sperrle was promoted to &quot;General der Flieger&quot;.

===Anschluss and annexation of Czechoslovakia===
Sperrle was given command of &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; Group 3 (&quot;Luftwaffengruppenkommando&quot; 3) on the 1 February 1938 which eventually became &quot;Luftflotte 3&quot; (Air Fleet 3) in February 1939. Sperrle commanded the air fleet for the remainder of his military career.

Sperrle was used by Hitler in his foreign policy to intimidate small neighbours with the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot;, which had earned a reputation in Spain. On 12 February 1938, Hitler invited Sperrle to a meeting at Berchtesgaden with Kurt Schuschnigg, chancellor of the Federal State of Austria. Generals Wilhelm Keitel, Walther von Reichenau were also in attendance. The meetings eventually helped pave the way for &quot;Anschluss&quot;, the Nazi seizure of Austria. The first meeting secured Austrian Nazi Dr Arthur Seyss-Inquart as Interior Minister. When Schuschnig announced a plebiscite on Austrian independence, Hitler ordered Sperrle&#x27;s &quot;Luftkreis&quot; V to mobilise for an invasion on 10 March. On 12 March Sperrle&#x27;s airmen dropped leaflets over Vienna. All three of Sperrle&#x27;s combat units, KG 155, KG 255 and JG 153, moved into airfields around Linz and Vienna during the invasion.

On 1 April 1938, Luftwaffengruppenkommando 3 and its subordinate command, Fliegerkommandeure 5, under Major General Ludwig Wolff, had one &quot;Jagdgeschwader&quot; (fighter wing), two &quot;Kampfgeschwader&quot; (bomber wings) and one &quot;Sturzkampfgeschwader&quot; (Dive-bomber wing). Sperrle&#x27;s air fleet was used to threaten the President of Czechoslovakia, Emil Hácha, into accepting Nazi rule and the formation of Slovakia. Sperrle possessed 650 aircraft in Fliegerdivision 5, which formed part of his command. His orders were to support the 12th Army in the event an invasion of Czechoslovakia was required. Albert Kesselring commanding &quot;Luftwaffengruppenkommando&quot; 2, was given half of the 2,400 aircraft supporting the invasion and the responsibility of supporting three field armies. The Munich Agreement ended the prospect of war and Sperrle&#x27;s forces landed at Aš airfield as the &quot;Wehrmacht&quot; annexed the Sudetenland in October 1938.

In March 1939 Hitler decided to annex Czechoslovakia completely and risk war. He turned once again to the Luftwaffe to assist him achieving diplomatic results. The threat of aerial bombardment proved a crucial in forcing smaller nations to submit to German occupation. The successes confirmed Hitler&#x27;s view that air power could be used politically, as a &quot;terror weapon&quot;. In a series of meetings in Berlin, Hitler told Hácha that half of Prague could be destroyed in two hours, and hundreds of bombers were ready for the operation. Sperrle was asked by Hitler to talk about the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot;, to intimidate the Czech president. Hácha purportedly fainted, and when he regained consciousness, Göring screamed at him, &quot;think of Prague!&quot;

The elderly President reluctantly ordered the Czechoslovakian Army not to resist. The aerial part of the German occupation of Czechoslovakia was carried out by 500–650 aircraft belonging to Sperrle&#x27;s newly renamed air fleet, &quot;Luftflotte&quot; 3. The majority of these aircraft were concentrated in the 4 &quot;Fliegerdivision&quot; (4th Flying Division). The operational condition of the Luftwaffe was at 57 percent with 60 percent requiring maintenance, while depots had only enough replacement aero engines to cover 4 to 5 percent of frontline strength. Only 1,432 of the 2,577 aircrew available were fully trained. Just 27 percent of bomber crews were instrument trained. These problems effectively reduced fighter and bomber units to 83 and 32.5 percent of their strength. The &quot;Luftwaffe&#x27;s&quot; saving grace was that the British, French and Czech air forces were in slightly worse condition in 1939.

==World War II==
On 1 September 1939, the &quot;Wehrmacht&quot; invaded Poland prompting the British Empire and France to declare war in her defence. Sperrle&#x27;s &quot;Luftflotte&quot; 3 remained guarding German air space in western Germany and did not contribute to the German invasion, made possible by the non-aggression pact with the Soviet Union. The air fleet&#x27;s Order of battle had been stripped of almost all of the combat units it held in March 1939. Only two reconnaissance &quot;staffel&quot; (squadrons) and a single bomber unit attached to Wekusta 51 remained. Sperrle received the competent Major General Maximilian Ritter von Pohl as his chief of staff. The two men made for a &quot;good partnership&quot;. Sperrle was also assigned Major General Walter Surén, appointed as the air fleet&#x27;s chief signals officer. Surén planned and organised the German field communications for the offensive in 1940. While guarding the Western Front during the Phoney War, Sperrle&#x27;s small fleet of 306 aircraft—which included 33 obsolete Arado Ar 68s—fought off probing attacks of French and British aircraft.

Sperrle developed a reputation as a gourmet, whose private transport aircraft featured a refrigerator to keep his wines cool, and although as corpulent as Göring, he was reliable and as ruthless as his superior. Sperrle wanted his air fleet to take a more aggressive stance and won over Göring. On 13 September 1939 he was authorised to undertake long-range high altitude reconnaissance missions at extreme altitudes. Sperrle had already taken the initiative on 4 September when I./KG 53 carried out such an operation. Photographic operations over France authorised by the OKL began on 21 September, which the &quot;Oberkommando der Wehrmacht&quot; did not sanction until four days later. Sperrle lost eight aircraft over 21–24 November 1939, but succeeded in obtaining good reconnaissance results. The losses prompted his use of fighter escorts on the return journey. Reconnaissance operations were eased when Sperrle received KG 27 and KG 55 once the Polish campaign had ended.

===Battle of France===
&quot;Luftflotte&quot; 3 was heavily reinforced in the spring, 1940. Sperrle&#x27;s headquarters was based at Bad Orb. The air fleet was assigned I. &quot;Flakkorps&quot; under &quot;Generaloberst&quot; Hubert Weise, I. &quot;Fliegerkorps&quot; under &quot;Generaloberst&quot; Ulrich Grauert at Cologne, the II. &quot;Fliegerkorps&quot; under Generaloberst Bruno Loerzer at Frankfurt, and V. &quot;Fliegerkorps&quot; under command of General Robert Ritter von Greim at Gersthofen. &quot;Jagdfliegerführer&quot; 3 (Fighter Flyer Command 3) under the command of Oberst Gerd von Massow was assigned to the air fleet at Wiesbaden. Massow was replaced during the campaign by &quot;Oberst&quot; Werner Junck. For the coming battle, Sperrle had 1,788 aircraft (1,272 operational) at his disposal. Opposing Sperrle, was the &quot;Armée de l&#x27;Air&quot; (French Air Force) eastern (ZOAE) and southern (ZOAS) zones under &quot;Général de Corps d&#x27;armée Aérien&quot; René Bouscat and Robert Odic. Bouscat had 509 aircraft (363 operational) and Odic 165 (109 combat ready).

I. &quot;Fliegerkorps&quot; covered a line running from Eupen, to the Luxembourg border, westward through Fumay, south of Laon to Senlis and the Seine at Vernon through to the English Channel with just 471 aircraft. Cloudy conditions prevented the bomber wings from finding airfields, so industrial targets were attacked instead. II. &quot;Fliegerkorps&quot; operated from Bitsch to Revigny, to Villenauxe, then west north of Orléans and south of Nantes to the Atlantic Ocean south of the Loire river with only 429 aircraft. V. &quot;Fliegerkorps&quot; covered south of this line with 498 aircraft and the 359 fighters of &quot;Jagdfliegerführer&quot; 3.

Fall Gelb began on 10 May 1940. Sperrle&#x27;s air fleet engaged in operations supporting &quot;Generalfeldmarschall&quot; Gerd von Rundstedt and Army Group A in the Battle of Belgium and Battle of France, as well as Army Group C. Sperrle&#x27;s counter-air campaign started badly, reflecting poor photographic interpretation of targets, though he later claimed Luftflotte 3&#x27;s operations were decisive in achieving air superiority. Kesselring&#x27;s Luftflotte 2 achieved far greater success. Only 29 of the 42 airfields bombed were being used. Three RAF Advanced Air Striking Force bases were struck. Sperrle&#x27;s men claimed 240 to 490 aircraft destroyed, mostly &quot;in hangars&quot;—Allied losses were actually 40 first-line aircraft. The penalty for failing to neutralise Allied fighter units cost Sperrle 39 aircraft. Loerzer lost 23—the highest loss of any air corps on the day.

Weiss&#x27; Flakkorps repulsed the RAF ASSAF attacks against the German advance, inflicting a 56 percent loss rate. From 10 to 13 May 1940 Sperrle&#x27;s air fleet was credited with 89 aircraft destroyed in dogfights, 22 by flak, and 233 to 248 on the ground. The most successful day recorded was on 11 May; 127 aircraft were claimed—100 on the ground and 27 in the air. In a notable incident, 8./KG 51—one of the air fleet&#x27;s units, bombed Freiburg in error causing 158 civilian casualties and killing 22 children. To cover up the mistake, Nazi propaganda minister Joseph Goebbels blamed the British and French for the &quot;Freiburg massacre&quot;.

Sperrle&#x27;s bombers did lay the foundations of a break-through. Loerzer and Grauert&#x27;s air corps ordered their reconnaissance aircraft to range approximately 400 kilometres into French territory. They avoided the Sedan area so not to attract the attention of the French to German forces advancing on it, they carefully monitored the Allied reactions. Sperrle&#x27;s air corps commanders targeted air interdiction operations and ordered attacks on rail communications to prevent the westward deployment of the French Army from the Maginot Line and to pin down Allied reserves by disrupting communications across the Meuse. 26 French rail stations were bombed as were 86 localities from 10 to 12 May. Sperrle maintained the pressure on airfields—44 were struck on the 11–12 May. Loerzer and V. &quot;Fliegerkorps&quot;, under Greim, also bombed road traffic around Charleville-Mézières.

On 13 May, Paul Ludwig Ewald von Kleist&#x27;s 1st Panzer Army was poised to cross the Meuse at Montherme, with Heinz Guderian&#x27;s XIX Army Corps at Sedan. To support the breakthrough, &quot;Generalleutnant&quot; Wolfram von Richthofen&#x27;s VIII. &quot;Fliegerkorps&quot; was transferred to &quot;Luftflotte 3&quot;. Loerzer, supplemented by some of Richthofen&#x27;s forces, supported Guderian&#x27;s breakthrough at Sedan. Sperrle arranged a single, massive bombing of the defences; Loerzer did not carry out the plan, but a series of bombing operations on the Meuse front. II. &quot;Fliegerkorps&quot; flew 1,770 missions, Richthofen&#x27;s command flew 360. The bombing played an important role in allowing the breakthrough at Sedan, while Sperrle&#x27;s fighters repulsed attempts by the Allies to bomb the bridges on 14 May, following their capture. German air defences accounted for 167 bombers destroyed.

During the breakthrough to the English Channel, rail networks were attacked to prevent Allied forces rallying. Greim&#x27;s V. &quot;Fliegerkorps&quot; subjected regrouping French forces to heavy air bombardment. From 13 to 24 May, 174 French rail stations were bombed as were 186 localities, while factories were struck on 35 on occasions and airfields 47 times. Guderian&#x27;s advance tore through the heart of ZOAN&#x27;s area and AASF&#x27;s infrastructure threatening the western airfields of ZOAE. The British abandoned France on 19 May, a day before the German army reached the Channel at Amiens. Sperrle&#x27;s subordinates, Richthofen and Greim lost 47 reconnaissance aircraft in five days in a bid to find targets.

By this time, Sperrle&#x27;s boundary with Kesselring ran down the Sambre to Charleroi. Sperrle&#x27;s job was to protect Guderian&#x27;s southern flank, though he was ordered to assist against an attempted counter-attack near Arras by supporting the 4th Army advance north. Grauert&#x27;s I. &quot;Fliegerkorps&quot; contributed to 300 sorties over Arras. Loerzer and Greim protected Guderian along the Aisne, the former supporting the 2nd and 12th armies. Sperrle&#x27;s subordinates flew only seven operations against airfields from 20 to 23 May, but 54 against rail stations and another 47 against localities.

Sperrle and Kesselring objected to the halt order during the Battle of Dunkirk. Neither man believed the pocket could be reduced by air power alone. Sperrle, according to Richthofen, was ambivalent and had made few provisions for an attack on the port, preferring to concentrate on his area of operations in the south. Richthofen and Kesselring argued their commands had suffered heavy losses and were in no position to gain air superiority. The campaign began promisingly when Grauert and Loerzer assisted in the bombing and destruction of the inner harbour forcing Allied shipping to use the poorer outer harbour. On 26 May, the chiefs of staff of I., II., V. and VIII. &quot;Fliegerkorps&quot; met at Château de Roumont, near Ochamps, with Sperrle for a conference on coordination issues. Ultra at Bletchley Park intercepted Richthofen&#x27;s signals and ten aircraft were dispatched to bomb the building, which was hit but caused little damage.

Kesselring&#x27;s air fleet carried the burden of operations over Dunkirk, but Sperrle&#x27;s men were also attacking shipping. Keller was ordered to destroy Belgian ports in support of the 18th Army, while 30 aircraft from Loerzer&#x27;s II. &quot;Fliegerkorps&quot;—including 12 from KG 3—were lost in battle with Air Vice Marshal Keith Park&#x27;s No. 11 Group RAF. Approximately 320 tons of bombs were dropped, which killed 21 German airmen prisoners of war awaiting transport to England and injured 100 more. From 27 May, Sperrle&#x27;s I and II air corps attempted to gain air superiority over the Calais–Dunkirk area—Calais had fallen the previous day. Massow&#x27;s &quot;Jafü&quot; 3 provided fighter escort. Over the ports, the German air fleets sank or damaged 89 ships (126,518 grt) and eight destroyers with a further 21 damaged. Sperrle and Kesselring failed to prevent the Dunkirk evacuation, despite flying 1,997 fighter, 1,056 bomber and 826 &quot;strike&quot; operations.

Gelb was complete, and the OKL prepared for Case Red. The &quot;Luftflotten&quot; were reorganised; Sperrle retained II. and V. &quot;Fliegerkorps&quot; along with I. &quot;Flakkorps&quot;. The flak corps was reorganised into two brigades, with four regiments each with the firepower of 72 batteries. Sperrle was required to strike far deeper into France, and was given the majority of &quot;Zerstörer&quot; (destroyer aircraft) equipped with Messerschmitt Bf 110—half of them given to Greim and Loerzer. Sperrle could muster 1,000 aircraft. On 5 June, Sperrle&#x27;s order of battle lists Richthofen&#x27;s VIII corps and Massow&#x27;s Jafü 3. Opposing them was 2,086 aircraft of the &quot;Armée de l&#x27;Air&quot;, but production of aircraft was not matched by component manufacture, and only 29 percent were operational.

In a prelude to the offensive, Sperrle planned to carry out strategic bombing operations against Paris. Sperrle had long-planned for air attacks on Paris using II., V. and VIII. &quot;Fliegerkorps&quot; in May. He was forced to abandon the plan on 22 May because of weather, but the following day, the OKL prepared a plan for Operation Paula. The plan was to attack the estimated 1,000 French aircraft detected on Parisian airfields, but also to attack factories and destroy the morale of the French people. The operation was undone by poor staff work and excessive confidence in the Enigma machine. ULTRA intercepted a VIII. &quot;Fliegerkorps&quot; message to KG 77&#x27;s commanding officer, which named Paris as the target. The ZOAN increased its operational strength to 120 fighters and were alerted an hour before the German bombers got airborne. The operation inflicted minor damage.

On 5 June Sperrle&#x27;s forces flew eight bombing operations against railways and localities, 21 to 31 against road targets, 12 against troop columns and 34 to 42 against French Army defences or strongpoints. II. &quot;Fliegerkorps&quot; alone flew 276 bombing missions. On 12 June, as the French front collapsed, Sperrle planned a new assault upon Paris, but it was declared an open city before it could be carried out. Sperrle was ordered to support Rundstedt advancing southward, with orders to encircle the Maginot Line, from the west. &quot;Luftflotte&quot; 3 carried out bridge interdiction operations in the Loire and on 17 June Guderian reach the border with Switzerland completing the encirclement. The campaign played out for a further five days, which came as Luftwaffe logistics were breaking down—fuel and ammunition shortages were acute and relied on air transportation. Sperrle attempted to prevent the British Operation Aerial—a second evacuation—but the only success was the sinking of &quot;Lancastria&quot;, with 5,800 lives lost.

On 20 June arrangements were made for the Armistice of 22 June 1940. Upon learning of it, Sperrle ordered the abandonment of a planned bombing operation against Bordeaux. At 21:00 on 24 June Sperrle ordered that &quot;Luftflotte&quot; 3 cease operations by 00:35 the next morning. In the 1940 Field Marshal Ceremony Sperrle was promoted to the said rank.

===Battle of Britain===
In July 1940 Winston Churchill&#x27;s government rejected peace overtures from Hitler. Hitler resolved to knock Britain out of the war. The OKL began tentative planning for Operation Eagle Attack to destroy RAF Fighter Command to gain air superiority, before supporting an amphibious landing in Britain, codenamed, Operation Sea Lion.

Sperrle thought the RAF could be defeated &quot;en passant&quot;. His personal strategy to attack ports and merchant shipping was overruled by Göring, ostensibly because the ports would be required for the invasion. Kesselring&#x27;s contemporary notes indicate he thought air superiority could only be attained for a short time, since most airfields and factories in Britain were out of range. Sperrle and Kesselring miscalculated, or were misled by intelligence, into underestimating the number of fighter aircraft available to Fighter Command—they put the RAF total at 450 aircraft when the real figure was 750. Chronic intelligence failures on British production, defence systems and aircraft performance inhibited the German air operation throughout the battle. Joseph Schmid, the OKL&#x27;s chief intelligence officer, was primarily responsible for providing inaccurate and distorted information to senior German air commanders encouraging enormous over-confidence.

The &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; regrouped after the Battle of France into three &quot;Luftflotten&quot; (Air Fleets) . &quot;Luftflotte&quot; 2, commanded by &quot;Generalfeldmarschall&quot; Albert Kesselring, &quot;Luftflotte&quot; 5, led by &quot;Generaloberst&quot; Hans-Jürgen Stumpff was based in Norway and &quot;Luftflotte&quot; 3, under &quot;Generalfeldmarschall&quot; Sperrle. &quot;Luftflotte&quot; 2, whose units were based in northern Germany, Netherlands, Belgium and France north of the Seine, would be concerned mainly with the area east of a line from Le Havre through Selsey Bill to the Midlands; &quot;Luftflotte&quot; 3, based in western France, would deal similarly with objectives west and north-west of that line. Each &quot;Luftflotte&quot; was to attack shipping off its own stretch of coast. Diversionary attacks, intended to draw off part of the defences from the south, would be made on north-east England, south-east Scotland and shipping in adjacent waters by &quot;Luftflotte&quot; 5 from Norwegian and Danish airfields.

Kesselring was responsible for all air force units in northern Germany, Netherlands, Belgium and north-eastern France while Sperrle was in control of forces in northern and western France. &quot;Luftflotte&quot; 3 was assigned Alfred Keller&#x27;s &quot;Fliegerkorps&quot; IV, based in Brittany, Richthofen&#x27;s &quot;Fliegerkorps&quot; VIII in the Cherbourg region, and Greim&#x27;s &quot;Fliegerkorps&quot; V in the Seine area—precise boundaries between the air corps are not known. The entire bomber strength of Sperrle&#x27;s air fleet was reserved for night bombing. Sperrle&#x27;s command did not begin large-scale daylight attacks until the last week of September.

Sperrle&#x27;s first task against the British Isles was during the &quot;Kanalkampf&quot; (Channel Battle) phase of what became known as the Battle of Britain. The aim was to draw out Fighter Command into dogfights by attacking Channel Shipping. Targeting British convoy systems, in July 1940 Sperrle&#x27;s air fleet claimed 90 vessels sunk for approximately 300,000 tons—a third of this was claimed over August and September. The claims were wildly optimistic. Only 35 ships were sunk during the Kanalkampf period. Sperrle was becoming disconcerted at the personnel, rather than aircraft, losses. Two days before Operation Eagle—scheduled for 13 August—he had lost two &quot;Gruppenkommandeur&quot; and a &quot;Staffelkapitän&quot;. Sperrle knew he could not afford to lose experienced officers at such a rate.

The emphasis of German air attacks switched to bombing Fighter Command bases and its infrastructure. On 13 August 1940, Sperrle&#x27;s air fleet played a role in the failed &quot;Unternehmen Adlerangriff&quot; (&quot;Operation Eagle Attack&quot;). As night fell, Sperrle sent &quot;Kampfgruppe&quot; 100 (Bombing Group 100) to bomb Supermarine Spitfire factory at Castle Bromwich, Birmingham which failed to achieve anything. Sperrle, Kesselring, Grauert and Loerzer were summoned to Karinhall to explain why the operation had been a mess. At the meeting, it was decided to intensify attacks from all directions, including Air Fleet 5 in Norway, when the weather permitted.

On the 14 August, Sperrle began a smaller, prolonged, but widely scattered series of attacks on aerodromes and other targets in the western half of England. The attacks were not very effective and earned the &quot;Luftflotte&quot; a rebuke from Göring. The following day, between midnight and midnight, the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; made 1,786 sorties. Conferring with his commanders, Göring condemned the lack of foresight which had sent many bombers of &quot;Luftflotte&quot; 3 on difficult missions suitable only for experienced picked crews. The &quot;Reichsmarshall&quot; also deplored the waste of effort caused by choosing targets of no strategic value as &#x27;alternatives&#x27; for crews unable to reach their primary objectives. The 15 August became known as &quot;Black Thursday&quot; in the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; due to the scale of the fighting and losses.

The 18 August 1940—known as The Hardest Day—proved disastrous for Sperrle&#x27;s air fleet. &quot;Luftflotte&quot; 3 had poor intelligence; the British airfields the Air Fleet attacked had nothing to do with the battle for air superiority, for they belonged to RAF Coastal Command and Fleet Air Arm. Sperrle and his command remained unaware of the intelligence failures, and as one analyst remarked, they &quot;literally did not know what they were doing. Any grass landing strip with a few buildings around it seemed to warrant a raid.&quot; From, the tactical perspective, improper positioning of Sperrle&#x27;s fighter leaders allowed RAF pilots to mass attacks against isolated elements of dive-bombers, causing heavy losses. On 24 August Göring ordered Sperrle to conduct bombing operations against Liverpool, a major port city. Three days later, he decreed Sperrle&#x27;s air fleet was to be used for night attacks exclusively and siphoned his fighter units off to Kesselring. 450 tons of bombs damaged the docks and damaged . Twenty-four hours earlier, Sperrle&#x27;s last major daylight attack for several weeks against Portsmouth was repulsed by Park&#x27;s 11 Group.

On the night of 28 August &quot;Luftflotte&quot; 3 attacked Liverpool. The night&#x27;s bombing was reckoned the first major night attack on the United Kingdom. The process was repeated for three nights. &quot;Luftflotte&quot; 3 sent an average of 157 bombers a night to Liverpool and Birkenhead. About 70 percent of crews claimed to have dropped, on each night, an average of 114 tons of high explosive and 257 incendiary bombs. On 29 August 176 crews were sent, of whom 137 claimed to have reached the Mersey ports and to have dropped there 130 tons of high-explosive and 313 incendiary-canisters. For &quot;Luftflotte&quot; 3 the four raids involved the biggest effort they could make without impairing their capacity to operate for weeks to come. On the third night only some 40 tons of high explosive fell on Liverpool, Birkenhead, or close by. The docks were not hit and damage was mostly to suburban property. Sperrle lost only seven crews, reflecting the perilous state of RAF night fighter defences.

At the beginning of September 1940, Sperrle could muster 350 serviceable bombers and dive-bombers and about 100 fighters, either for his own purposes or to support the 9th Army and, if necessary, the 6th Army in a landing. Sperrle lost Richthofen to Kesselring who took possession of some units in Normandy, and concentrated the available dive-bomber force near the Straits of Dover. Sperrle was sceptical about Fighter Command&#x27;s reported losses. He had seen inflated claims made before in Spain, and advocated maintaining attacks on the RAF and the infrastructure supporting it. This strategy was about to change.

The battle over airfields continued into September. On the third day, Göring met with Sperrle and Kesselring. Göring was sure Fighter Command was exhausted and favoured attacking London to draw out the last of the British fighter reserves. Kesselring enthusiastically agreed; Sperrle did not. Kesselring urged Göring to carry out an all–out attack based on the unproven assertion that Fighter Command had been virtually destroyed. Sperrle dismissed Kesselring&#x27;s optimism, and put British strength at the more accurate figure of 1,000 fighters. Nevertheless, Kesselring&#x27;s perception prevailed. The disagreement between the two air fleet commanders was not uncommon, and although they rarely quarrelled, their commands were separate and they did not coordinate their efforts. Instead, they fought their own private campaigns.

The focus of air operations changed to destroying the docks and factories in the centre of London. The change in strategy has been described as militarily controversial. The decision certainly relieved the pressure on Fighter Command, but wartime records and post-war analysis has shown that Fighter Command was not on the verge of collapse as assumed by German intelligence. The consequences for &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; airmen were severe on 15 September 1940. German aviators met a prepared enemy and crew losses were seven times that of the British. Furthermore, Fighter Command did not commit its reserve during the main attacks as the German command predicted.

===The Blitz===
The bombing operations continued against Fighter Command into October 1940, but with gradually more emphasis placed on attacking industrial cities, primarily because it offered the only way to continue hostilities against Britain directly in the absence of invasion. Air strategy became increasingly aimless and confused. The damage to the British war economy and morale was minimal into 1941. The preference for night over day operations was evident in the number of bombing operations flown by the German air fleets. In October 1940, 2,300 sorties were flown in daylight and 5,900 at night, reducing losses from 79 in day operations to 23 at night. Sperrle&#x27;s command flew the majority of the missions; 3,500 to Kesselring&#x27;s 2,400.

Sperrle&#x27;s air fleet received &quot;Fliegerkorps&quot; I in late August 1940. The corps contained specialist units equipped with Y-&quot;Verfahren&quot; (Y-Control), a night navigational aid which precipitated the Battle of the Beams. Several of Greim&#x27;s air corps were assigned pathfinder units from KG 26 and KG 55 known as &quot;Beleuchtergruppe&quot; (illumination group). Sperrle had spent the last week of August and first week of September gearing up for large–scale night operations. Sperrle&#x27;s air fleet assisted in the beginning of The Blitz which began in earnest on 7 September 1940. This night approximately 250 aircraft dropped 300 tons of high explosive and 13,000 incendiaries on the centre of London.

Sperrle&#x27;s airmen flew 4,525 bombing operations in November 1940. The air fleet played a large role in the Birmingham and Coventry Blitz, with support from &quot;Luftflotte&quot; 2. Sperrle provided 304 of the 448 bombers in the Coventry attack. Surviving German records suggest that the aim of the Coventry raid was to disrupt production and reconstruction critical to the automotive industry, but also to dehouse workers. 503 tons of high explosive and oil bombs were dropped by the 449 crews that claimed to have hit the target. The destruction of the city centre cost the air fleet one bomber.

In November, 159 bombers from &quot;Luftflotte&quot; 2 and 3 bombed Southampton destroying much of the city. Bombers attached to the air fleet led attacks on Birmingham, part of 357-strong force. Incendiaries started fires that were visible from away. The air fleet was involved in attacks on Liverpool (324 bombers). Over 20–22 December 205 and 299 bombers struck the city. The bombing, on targets such as Liverpool, were not followed up the next night, giving the city, inhabitants and defences time to recover. Ministry of Home Security Herbert Morrison warned that morale in the city might crumble under sustained bombing—he did report 39,126 grt of shipping had been sunk, 111,601 grt damaged. Half the berths were out of action and unloading capacity was reduced by 75 percent.

In December 1940 Sperrle&#x27;s air groups flew 2,750 bombing operations against British cities, more than the 700 flown by Kesselring&#x27;s command. Manchester—in close proximity to Liverpool—was first bombed in December 1940, beginning the Manchester Blitz. From 22 to 24 December Manchester was bombed on two successive nights by 270, then 171 bombers. Northern targets were expanded to include participation in the Sheffield Blitz. On 12 December the bombing of the city opened with attacks by 336 aircraft then a further 94 two days later. The bombing was carried out over the course of nine hours, destroying much of the city. London remained a primary objective. On the night of 9 December 1940, for example, 413 bombers hit the capital and on 29 December the bombing caused what became known as the Second Great Fire of London. On this night alone Sperrle&#x27;s air fleet dropped 27, 499 incendiaries. It was not the heaviest raid on London—136 aircraft—but it was the most destructive.

On 24 November 1940 148 of Sperrle&#x27;s bombers began the Bristol Blitz. Around 12,000 incendiary bombs and 160 tons of high-explosive bombs were dropped. Park Street destroyed and the Bristol Museum hit. 207 people were killed and thousands of houses were destroyed or damaged. The city was targeted again on 3/4 January 1941. 30 air raids were carried out against Bristol according to wartime British sources. Approximately a little over 1,000 people were killed in the attacks. By January 1941, &quot;Luftflotte&quot; 3 had been reorganised. I. &quot;Fliegerkorps&quot; under &quot;Generaloberst&quot; Ulrich Grauert remained with Sperrle, but he was given two further air corps—VI. &quot;Fliegerkorps&quot; under Generalleutnant Kurt Pflugbeil and V. &quot;Fliegerkorps&quot; under General Greim was retained; eight bomber wings provided the striking power of Sperrle&#x27;s air fleet.

In February 1941 bad weather limited Sperrle to 975 bombing operations. Bomber wings under Sperrle&#x27;s command struck at Swansea. 101 high explosive and several hundred of other types of bombs were dropped disrupting the Great Western Line. In March the intensy of bmbing operations increased, &quot;Luftflotte&quot; 3 flew 2,650 operations. Attacks against Cardiff in March 1941 caused some of populace to evacuate the city, a phenomenon known as &quot;trekking&quot;. Such incidents caused only temporary drops in morale. Other bombing operations were carried out against Liverpool by 316 aircraft, Glasgow by 236, Bristol by 162 bombers, London by 479 aircraft Portsmouth by 238 and Plymouth over two nights by 125 and 168 bombers.

In April 1941 the Midlands bore the brunt of German bombing raids with only three nights respite, 75 percent of them carried out by Sperrle&#x27;s air fleet. Birmingham was bombed on consecutive nights by 237 and 206 aircraft. Coventry was also subjected to a 237-bomber attack. British ports were also targeted as part of 16 major and five heavy attacks. Plymouth, Glasgow and Belfast were bombed in mid-April and morale was severely effected. Plymouth was bombed on five of the eight nights from 21 to 30 April by 120, 125, 109, 124 and 162 aircraft. The Port of London was bombed by 685 aircraft on 16 April and by 712 on 20 April. April was the most intensive month of the Blitz for &quot;Luftflotte&quot; 3 in 1941—approximately 3,750 bombing operations in comparison to 1,500 by Kesselring&#x27;s air fleet.

In May 1941, the final full-month of the German night offensive, Luftwaffe forces operating against western cities in Britain bombed Dublin, ostensibly in error. &quot;Luftflotte&quot; 3 regularly operated over North West England, against Liverpool and Manchester. On 31 May 1941, Sperrle&#x27;s air fleet made a huge navigational error, and bombed the Irish capital, situated some 200 miles from their targets in Liverpool. During May units belonging to the air fleet were involved in the Hull and Nottingham Blitz. A last effort was made against London on 10 May. 571 bombing missions were flown against the embattled capital that night. During the month, Sperrle&#x27;s men carried out the burden of night operations, flying 2,500 sorties in comparison to 1,300 from &quot;Luftflotte&quot; 2.

Approximately 40,000 British civilians had been killed, another 46,000 injured, and more than a million houses damaged during the Blitz. The German air fleets lost 600 German aircraft on night operations. The Coventry raid, which for a short time caused a decline of 20 percent of aircraft output, recovered. The effect on general industrial production was not significant. In five months of bombing docks and ports in 1941, only some 70,000 tons of food stocks were destroyed, and only one half a percent of oil stocks. Damage to communications was quickly repaired. Everywhere except in the aircraft industry the loss was too small a fraction of total output to matter seriously.

In early June 1941, the majority of German bomber units moved eastward to the soon-to-be Eastern Front, in preparation for Operation Barbarossa. &quot;Luftflotte&quot; 2, with elements of Sperrle&#x27;s air fleet—from IV and IV &quot;Fliegerkorps&quot;—were reassigned.

===Battle of the Atlantic===
Sperrle had been involved in the war at sea since the first phase of the Battle of Britain. He received an OKL directive on 20 October 1940 ordering him to attack shipping once again in the Thames Estuary. He ordered his dive-bombers into this service, but they were rapidly neutralised in November by a &quot;dynamic defence&quot;. The most effective support for the U-boat campaign came from attacking ports, which Directive 23, issued on 6 February 1941, had ordered the German air fleets to do. Direct support to the &quot;Kriegsmarine&quot; in the Battle of the Atlantic was haphazard; successes were won by accident rather than by design. In late May 1941 &quot;Luftflotte&quot; 3 made a sole contribution to the surface fleet, when it tried, in vain, to save the battleship &quot;Bismarck&quot;.

Within days, 41 of the 48 bomber groups engaged in operations over Britain departed for the soon-to-be Eastern Front in preparation for &quot;Barbarossa&quot;. Of the remaining seven, five were to support the Kriegsmarine in the Battle of the Atlantic under the command of Fliegerführer Atlantik (Flying Leader Atlantic). The Atlantic command came under Sperrle&#x27;s control upon formation but was subordinated to Sperrle officially on 7 April 1942. The name of the command was misleading, for it was tasked with maritime interdiction operations all around the British coast besides operating deep into the Atlantic.

Only two bomber groups remained under Sperrle&#x27;s command at the end of 1941 for direct attack on Britain. The anti-shipping mine-laying force around Britain did not receive the support it required through the war, and the German effort remained half-hearted. Sperrle protested to the OKL, OKW and Göring upon the dissipation of mine-laying operations through 1941 and 1942. Greim&#x27;s air corps was designated as leader of the effort in an effort to revitalise the campaign, but due to the demands of the Eastern Front, Greim departed in December 1941.

In the 46 months following July 1940, German aircraft sank 1,228,104 tons of merchant shipping and damaged 1,953,862 tons. Another 60,866 tons were sunk or damaged by mines in 1942 and 1943. The failure to properly cooperate with the navy against shipping was a grave strategic error which prevented the achievement of greater results. Göring&#x27;s intransigence was large factor in reducing the air effort. In May 1942, &quot;Fliegerführer Atlantik&quot; had only 40 aircraft and IX. Fliegerkorps, under Sperrle&#x27;s command at Soissons, 90. The U-boat arm continued to press for greater air protection in the Bay of Biscay. In 1942, anti-shipping operations near the British coast proved too expensive, and the demands of the Mediterranean Theatre and Eastern Front diverted some of the precious Focke-Wulf Fw 200s. These aircraft would not return for Atlantic operations until the summer, 1943.

For a brief period in March 1943—before the German defeat in Black May—Sperrle intended to increase his command to 22 groups (equivalent to seven &quot;Geschwader&quot;, or wings) for Atlantic operations. Ulrich Kessler, commanding &quot;Fliegerführer Atlantik&quot;, estimated that with Sperrle&#x27;s proposed bomber forces, he could sink 500,000 tons of shipping per month. Kessler did not receive adequate support, despite the optimisim of their meeting. On 5 June, Sperrle informed the naval command that the rescue of sunk U-boat crews was to take precedence over aerial reconnaissance of convoys. Making matters worse, the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; did nothing effective to counter RAF Coastal Command&#x27;s Bay of Biscay offensive against U-boat transit routes. From the Allied perspective, the Atlantic campaign became nothing more than a &quot;skirmish&quot; by the autumn of 1943.

The situation reached a climax in 1944. Kessler joined Karl Dönitz in outlining the hopeless military situation facing his Atlantic command. Göring was sensitive to criticism of the Luftwaffe in front of Hitler, and hastily removed him from command on 7 February 1944. The command was disbanded officially three weeks later. The remnants were subsumed into X. &quot;Fliegerkorps&quot;. From 19 February to April 1944, there was a virtual absence of Luftwaffe reconnaissance over the Atlantic. Atlantic operations continued until 13 August 1944, when the headquarters of II. &quot;Fliegerkorps&quot; evacuated their Atlantic base at Mont-de-Marsan, despite contrary orders from Sperrle&#x27;s staff once the German Western Front began to collapse.

===Circus offensives, Baedeker Blitz, Mediterranean===
Sperrle commanded all German air forces in France, Netherlands and Belgium upon the departure of Kesselring in mid–1941. At this time, Sperrle was permitted to keep two &quot;Luftgaue&quot; in southern Germany under his control to appease his &quot;vanity&quot;. &quot;Luftflotte&quot; 3 became solely responsible for maintaining the pressure on British cities, sea communications and protecting German-occupied territory from RAF incursions, named the Circus offensives. The RAF Circus offensives were the brainchild of Air Chief Marshal Sholto Douglas, Air Officer Commanding Fighter Command and his principal lieutenant, Air Vice-Marshal Trafford Leigh-Mallory, using Park&#x27;s No. 11 Group. It formed the Air Staff&#x27;s policy of &quot;leaning&quot; into Europe. Fighter Command began with Circus Number 1 on 10 January 1941.

Sperrle was stripped of most of the fighter forces leaving only two wings—JG 2 and JG 26. The two fighter wings covered the coast from Brittany to eastern Belgium. They would carry the burden of air defence in 1941 and 1942. Kesselring&#x27;s departure left &quot;Jagdfliegerführer&quot; 2 (Fighter Flyer Command 2) under Theo Osterkamp responsible for air space from the Schelde to the Seine. Werner Junck inherited &quot;Jagdfliegerführer&quot; 3 which defended air space to the west of the Seine. Karl-Bertram Döring commanded &quot;Jagdfliegerführer&quot; 1 covering the Netherlands—each leader controlled a wing; JG 26, 2 and 1 respectively. JG 1 was added to Sperrle&#x27;s command by 10 July 1942. Sperrle had only two bomber wings under his command—one of which formed part of &quot;Fliegerführer Atlantik&quot;.

Between mid-June and the end of July 1941, Fighter Command flew some 8,000 offensive sorties, covering 374 bombers. They claimed 322 German aircraft for the loss of 123. Sperrle&#x27;s forces lost 81 fighters from the approximate total of 200 in France and Belgium. The strength of the two fighter Geschwader fell to 140 in August 1941 and serviceability within these totals from 75 percent to 60 percent. July and August proved to be the busiest, with 4,385 and 4,258 interceptions.

From July to December 1941 Circus operations cost Fighter Command 416 fighters in 20,495 sorties and RAF Bomber Command 108 in 1,406. Sperrle&#x27;s fighters flew 19,535 sorties and lost 93 in the same period. Fighter Command claimed 731 German aircraft from 14 June to December 1941 whereas actual German losses were 103 leading post-war RAF analysis to conclude it lost four aircraft and 2.5 pilots for every German fighter destroyed. Rather than wear &quot;Luftflotte&quot; 3 down, the number of German fighter aircraft in the west increased from 430 on 27 September 1941 to 599 on 30 September 1942.
The new year of 1942 began with a continuation of the 1941 successes. In February 1942, the battleships &quot;Scharnhorst&quot; and &quot;Gneisenau&quot; and the cruiser &quot;Prinz Eugen&quot; escaped from the French port at Brest in Operation Cerberus upon their return from the recent Operation Berlin. One of Sperrle&#x27;s former wing commanders, &quot;General der Jagdflieger&quot; Adolf Galland, planned Operation Donnerkeil, an air superiority plan with Sperrle&#x27;s chief of staff Karl Koller. From the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot;″s perspective, the operation was a success against the odds. Sperrle was able to provide five bomber groups for the &quot;Donnerkeil&quot;.

The Circus offensive in 1942 succeeded in putting Sperrle&#x27;s air defences under pressure. Fighter Command flew 43,339 daylight sorties over Western Europe and Bomber Command 1,794. The largest air battle occurred on 19 August 1942 during the Dieppe Raid. &quot;Luftflotte&quot; 3&#x27;s units won a significant victory over Fighter and Bomber Command. The British lost 106 aircraft; the Germans lost only 48 aircraft destroyed and 24 damaged. At the end of 1942, Leigh-Mallory replaced Douglas as AOC Fighter Command. The two men had presided over the loss of 587 fighters while Sperrle lost 108 through the year. The British losses were equivalent to 30 squadrons.

The &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; did not remain on the defensive in 1941 and 1942. Sperrle&#x27;s air fleet carried out intensive air attacks on Britain and the limited German bomber force was reinforced over the winter, 1941–42. Concurrently, Sperrle with support from Hans-Jurgen Stumpff, continued to carry out air attacks on shipping. The Baedeker Blitz became the largest air offensive against Britain in 1942. The campaign was prompted by the bombing of Lübeck. Hitler ordered Sperrle to bomb British cities that held cultural significance. Hitler specifically outlined the terrorist purpose of the bombing offensive aimed at civilian centres for the greatest impact on the British populace. The blitz was accompanied by fighter-bomber attacks against London and coastal towns, which took place until June 1943. In April 1943, Sperrle&#x27;s air fleet could still muster 120 aircraft for these operations. The purpose of these fighter-bomber (&quot;Jabo&quot;) operations, which began from autumn, 1942, was for &quot;reprisals&quot;, similar to the German bomber campaign.

On 23 April 1942 the Baedeker offensive began with the Exeter Blitz and the Bath Blitz and extended west to Norwich. KG 2 carried the burden of campaign. In the Bath operation Sperrle&#x27;s pilots flew at only to magnify the damage. York was attacked and the cities suffered as German crews flew several missions per night. The offensive was halted on 9 May. Sperrle&#x27;s bombers had suffered a 5.3 percent loss rate in 716 missions, a loss of 38 bombers. Bombing operations continued upon the cessation of Baedeker against Birmingham in July and Canterbury. &quot;Luftflotte&quot; 3 flew 2,400 night bomber sorties against Britain in 1942 and lost 244 aircraft; a loss rate of 10.16 percent. During the operations, Sperrle&#x27;s wing commanders were forced to draw upon increasing numbers of instructor pilots—IV./KG 55, for example, lost a quarter of them. Sperrle&#x27;s air fleet flew 7,039 bombing operations and dropped 6,584 tons of bombs.

On 8 November 1942, Anglo-American forces landed in North Africa (Operation Torch). Hitler ordered Sperrle&#x27;s forces to occupy the French-Mediterranean coast (Case Anton). The aerial component of Anton was Operation Stockdorf. Sperrle&#x27;s command in the south was &quot;Fliegerdivision&quot; 2 commanded by Johannes Fink. Eight bomber and two fighter groups (approximately 30 aircraft in each) were selected for reconnaissance and anti-shipping operations by his order, dated 2 November. The air forces were to support the army, destroy any French aerial resistance and carry out interdiction of supply lines. Aside from anti-aircraft fire near Marseille, no serious resistance was encountered. The invasion provided bases for Sperrle&#x27;s fleet to strike at shipping in the Mediterranean Sea but left him with only four fighter groups to defend northern France. &quot;Luftflotte&quot; 3&#x27;s headquarters remained in France but it provided three bomber groups to Richthofen—commanding &quot;Luftflotte 2&quot;—for the defence against the Allied invasion of Sicily.

The &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; continued to defend Western Europe in 1943 as its offensive capabilities declined. The &quot;Jabo&quot; operations came to a halt in the summer, 1943 due to excessive casualties and the need to reinforce the Mediterranean. German bomber units flew less than 4,000 individual bomber sorties during the entire year. In March 1943, Hitler ordered the appointment of an officer to coordinate attacks on Britain. Dietrich Peltz was given command of IX &quot;Fliegerkorps&quot;, part of Sperrle&#x27;s air fleet for this task. By December 1943 Peltz had pooled 501 bombers. As Peltz organised the bomber command, German operations against Britain continued. The year began with 311 sorties in January 1943 which dipped to 176 the following month. It reached 415 in March before peaking with 537 sorties in October 1943 and concluding with 190 in December. That year 3,915 night bombing sorties were flown, costing 191 aircraft—March being the worst month with 38. The &quot;Jabo&quot; units flew 728 sorties and lost 65 aircraft. The total tonnage of bombs dropped was recorded as 3,576.

===Defence of the Reich and &quot;Steinbock&quot;===
In 1942 another threat emerged when the United States Army Air Force (USAAF) began bombing raids against targets in Belgium and France. The first operation was carried out on 29 June 1942. On 27 January 1943 it extended the American area of operations into Germany for the first time. In 1942 the USAAF flew 1,394 bomber and 1,081 fighter sorties over Western Europe. Sperrle&#x27;s fighter pilots carried the burden of the defence in 1942. Later that year, JG 1 was assigned to &quot;Luftwaffenbefehlshaber Mitte&quot;, later known as &quot;Luftflotte Reich&quot; (Air Fleet Reich) but saw little action since USAAF rarely crossed into the Netherlands. Thereafter, the air war only escalated. Sperrle resisted attempts by &quot;Luftwaffenbefehlshaber Mitte&quot; to gain control of anti-aircraft forces or to allow the physical degradation of his air fleet, and the offensive mindedness of the OKL favoured front-line units. Eventually, &quot;Luftflotte&quot; 3 lost &quot;Luftgaue&quot; VII, XII and XIII&#x27;s anti-aircraft units.

&quot;Luftflotte&quot; 3&#x27;s order of battle contained only one complete fighter wing on 10 June 1943 and one group each from two other wings along with two independent squadrons (&quot;staffeln&quot;). The only fighter-bomber unit left was SKG 10, under the command of IX &quot;Fliegerkorps&quot;. The sole combat unit under &quot;Höherer JagdfliegerführerWest&quot; commanded by Max Ibel was I./JG 27. &quot;Jagdfliegerführer&quot; 2 under Generalmajor Joachim-Friedrich Huth contained only II./JG 26 and three other squadrons.

On the same date the Combined Bomber Offensive began around the clock bombing of German-occupied Europe—the defence of these regions became known as the Defence of the Reich. The purpose of the offensive was to destroy the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; and its supporting facilities in Europe through aerial bombardment and the destruction of German fighter defences in combat. Air superiority was to be achieved before Operation Overlord. The US Eighth Air Force operations created a crisis in July and August 1943. In March 1943, an immediate rise in losses had already been noted. A report from &quot;Luftflotte&quot; 3 recognised the size and defensive power of American bombers required a timely interception by massed formations for any chance of success. In July alone, western fighter forces lost 335 single-engine aircraft to all causes—18.1 percent of the available strength reported on 1 July. There was also a noticeable decline in the quality of pilot training.

On the German side, there was a call to unify German fighter forces and hold them back from the coast and keep them out of Allied fighter escort range. Regardless of the logic, Sperrle opposed the idea to preserve his command. Sperrle was sensitive to a centralised command for fighter forces and resisted. On 14 September 1943, the &quot;Luftflotte&quot; 3 area of operations covered most of France, with the exception of some regions in Alsace-Lorraine; Luxembourg, western and southern Belgium were his responsibility. Sperrle&#x27;s headquarters remained in Paris. The largest organisation attached to Sperrle&#x27;s command was 3. &quot;Jagd&quot; Division (3rd Fighter Division) based at Metz, under the control of Werner Junck. Sperrle had retained the &quot;Luftgaue&quot; in southern Germany and his air fleet was given control of the 5. &quot;Jagd&quot; Division. On 15 September 1943 to improve Sperrle&#x27;s organisation the II. &quot;Jagdkorps&quot; was formed with the 5th and 4. &quot;Jagd&quot; Division. The improvement in command and control made little difference in the battle with the USAAF for neither division received the reinforcements it needed.

From November 1942 – August 1943, the OKL missed a last chance to build a reserve to contest air superiority in the coming battles. The unwillingness of German air leaders to trade space for time forced the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; into a battle of attrition that it could not win. At the end of 1943, the German air defences won temporary successes against the USAAF Eighth Air Force—the Schweinfurt–Regensburg mission and Second Raid on Schweinfurt were defensive victories won at an exorbitant cost and with Sperrle&#x27;s peripheral involvement. In February 1944, Big Week targeted German and French–based targets. The German fighter force was bled white over the following two months. Before June 1944, &quot;Luftflotte&quot; 3 remained weak and contained few ground-attack aircraft; nearly all were based on the Eastern Front. Sperrle&#x27;s fighter pilots were required to attack the landing forces. Reinforcements came from &quot;Luftflotte Reich&quot;, but none of the pilots had been trained for ground-attack operations.

A major effect of the combined offensive on Sperrle&#x27;s air fleet was the diversion and reinforcement of &quot;Luftflotte Reich&quot; at the expense of &quot;Luftflotte&quot; 3. By June 1944, the number of fighter aircraft available in the west numbered 170. Sperrle&#x27;s air fleet had, at most, 300 fighter aircraft on 6 June 1944 to contest the D-day landings. The Western Allies amassed 12,837, including 5,400 fighters. The air fleet was particularly weak in night fighter units. Given the low priority for their production, Sperrle went for periods with no night–fighting capabilities despite the crucial geographical position of his air fleet and the exposure of important French industries to night attack. The diversion of resources extended to anti-aircraft artillery. On 14 May 1944, the OKL cancelled an order to divert five heavy and four light or medium batteries, each from &quot;Luftflotte&quot; 1 and 6, to Sperrle and instead rerouted them to &quot;Luftflotte Reich&quot;. Sperrle did retain the III Flak Corps which could be used in ground combat.

Another facet of the air war was the night offensive against Germany. Bomber Command&#x27;s area attacks against German industrial cities enraged Hitler and he ordered Sperrle to use Peltz&#x27;s bombers to strike back. Sperrle&#x27;s air fleet was reinforced on Göring&#x27;s orders for the purpose of bombing London. The offensive was named Operation Steinbock and began in January 1944. The operational aspects were devised by Peltz. He remarked to Göring that he would need any aircraft capable of carrying a bomb. By December 1943, Peltz assembled 695 operational aircraft before the offensive. Of the aircraft, 467 were bombers, 337 of them operational. On 20 January 1944 this increased to 524, with 462 combat ready. Peltz was subordinated to Göring, bypassing Sperrle, who Hitler and Göring regarded as sybarite by this stage. The feeble offensive was mocked by the British, and Peltz&#x27; forces incurred a 10 percent loss rate per sortie, for little military gain and 329 bombers were lost. The offensive wasted the last German bomber reserves. The losses were a blow to Sperrle. He had wanted to use his bomber forces to attack the invasion forces during the night at the landing grounds and the embarkation points in England. Hitler and Göring rejected this strategy as &quot;too passive&quot;.

===Normandy and dismissal===
Sperrle&#x27;s air fleet Enigma signals had been cracked and Ultra codebreakers from Bletchley Park deciphered signals sent by &quot;Luftflotte&quot; 3 headquarters to the OKW. Reading the reports, Allied intelligence deduced that the bombing operations against bridges, west of the Seine, and fighter activity between Mantes and Le Mans, had convinced the air fleet staff the invasion would take place in the Pas de Calais. The air fleet reports, dated 8 and 27 May 1944, expressed the view this activity pointed &quot;unmistakably&quot; towards that conclusion. Operation Fortitude reinforced that belief.

Allied attacks in May 1944 against bases had a devastating impact on &quot;Luftflotte&quot; 3 capabilities. ULTRA gave the Allies intelligence on the location and strength of German fighter units as well as the effectiveness of attacks. They knew when repairs to bases had been completed and when the Germans decided to abandon particular locations. The Allies pursued an intensive, well-planned campaign that destroyed the German structure near the English Channel and invasion beaches and forced Sperrle&#x27;s air fleet to abandon efforts to prepare bases close to the Channel. Further damage was done to Sperrle&#x27;s air defence network. Some 300,000 personnel worked in &quot;Luftflotte&quot; 3, 56,000 in signals. The fortification of radar sites after Dieppe had only highlighted them, and 76 of the 92 were knocked out by D-Day, blinding his &quot;Jagdkorps&quot;.

From December 1943, the Germans planned to move reinforcements into &quot;Luftflotte&quot; 3 when the invasion occurred so it could then launch a decisive air attack against the landings in the first hours. The plan, known as Operation &quot;Dr Gustav&quot; unravelled immediately due to ULTRA intercepts learning the date and time of reinforcements. The Allied air offensive had devastated German fighter bases and units while &quot;Steinbock&quot; had removed the bomber force from the battle.

On 5 June, the eve of the Normandy Campaign, &quot;Luftflotte&quot; 3 contained 600 aircraft of all types. It was expected that &quot;Luftflotte Reich&quot; would send forces to France. German meteorological reports misread the weather so that the invasion caught the command by surprise. Of his total strength, only 115 single-engine fighters were operational with 37 twin-engine fighters, 137 bombers, 93 anti-shipping aircraft, 48 ground-attack and 53 reconnaissance aircraft. Only 56 night fighters were combat ready in France. Sperrle&#x27;s anti-shipping force, &quot;Fliegerkorps&quot; X, consisted of only 137 conventional bombers, a force totally inadequate to counter Allied naval forces. On 23 May 1944, Sperrle had 349 heavy and 407 Flak batteries at his disposal.

The Allies enjoyed air supremacy on 6 June 1944 and flew 14,000 missions in support of the invasion. On the first day, the British and Commonwealth landed 75,215 men and the Americans 57,500. A large force of 23,000 paratroops parachuted in during the night. &quot;Luftflotte&quot; 3 barely reacted. Nevertheless, Sperrle issued a pompous order of the day to his airmen:

Men of &quot;Luftflotte&quot; 3! The enemy has launched the long-announced invasion. Long have we waited for this moment, long have we prepared ourselves, both inwardly and on the field of battle, by untiring, unending toil. Our task is now to defeat the enemy. I know that each one of you, true to his oath to the colors, will carry out his duties. Great things will be asked of you, and you will show the bravest fighting valor. Salute the Führer.

Sperrle&#x27;s sentiments were delusional. &quot;Luftflotte&quot; 3 launched less than 100 sorties including 70 by single-engine fighters. During the evening and night, bombers and anti-shipping squadrons mounted 175 more sorties against the invasion fleet. Sperrle lost 39 aircraft with 21 damaged, 8 due to non-combat causes.

&quot;Luftflotte&quot; 3 received 200 fighters from Germany within 36 hours of the invasion. An additional 100 followed by June 10. Their effectiveness was reduced by the destruction of air bases which forced units to deploy to inadequately prepared airfields. Most of the 670 aircraft that reinforced Sperrle were used up as air bases were under constant attack and the anti-shipping effort failed.

ULTRA monitored the movements of air units. On the night of June 7/8, the bomber and anti-shipping aircraft managed to fly 100 sorties, while the day forces flew 500 on 8 June—400 by single-engine fighters; &quot;Luftflotte&quot; 3 lost 68 aircraft during the day. In the first week of operations 362 aircraft were lost. In the second week, another 232 aircraft were destroyed. Thus, in the two weeks from 6 to 19 June, they lost nearly 75 percent of the aircraft that &quot;Luftflotte&quot; 3 had possessed on 5 June. From 6 to 30 June the Germans had lost 1,181 aircraft in 13,829 sorties. Of those sorties flown, 9,471 were fighter sorties.

German fighters loaded with bombs were unable to defend themselves and suffered heavy losses. They accomplished little, and soon fighter units ceased ground-attack operations. &quot;Luftflotte&quot; 3 used the latest novelty weapons in a bid to attack Allied shipping—the Mistel, Messerschmitt Me 262 and Henschel Hs 129 debuted in June and July 1944 in very small numbers. Radio-guided missiles sank just two vessels and damaged seven in Normandy. Torpedo aircraft sank two and damaged only three more. The anti-shipping effort was a failure. Some 1,200 attacks against shipping and 900 mine-laying operations were made in June, to little effect.

On 9 July ULTRA intercepted messages from Sperrle notifying his units that &quot;ruthless&quot; fuel economy measures be made and forbade the non-essential expenditure of fuel. Another decrypted message from &quot;Luftflotte&quot; 3 to OKL stated that air attacks had depleted fuel stocks to such an extent that June&#x27;s allocation would have to last to the end of July. II. &quot;Jagdkorps&quot; was ordered by Sperrle to cease ground-attack and night operations in August owing to the fuel crisis. In August 1944, as the German army retreated from France, Sperrle&#x27;s air fleet could fly only 250 missions to cover it.

The performance of Sperrle&#x27;s III Flak Corps was an exception. The Allied air forces lost 1,564 aircraft in June 1944, the majority to flak. The losses forced a reduction of activity in July and August 1944. The US Ninth Air Force command was critical of German fighter defences but noted that flak defences were effective and the source of constant attrition. The American air command suffered a 10–15 percent monthly attrition rate from April to July 1944.

Sperrle was dismissed from his post on 23 August 1944, hours before American and French forces liberated Paris and overran his headquarters. As the German front collapsed in the aftermath of the Falaise pocket, the air fleet ground organisation fled east across the Seine. Hitler charged the personnel of &quot;Luftflotte&quot; 3 with desertion and held Sperrle responsible. On 22 September 1944 his former command was downgraded from air fleet to air command.

By the time of his dismissal, Sperrle had purportedly long since lost faith in the German war effort and in Hitler and Göring&#x27;s military leadership. He had become lazy and had a tendency to indulge in the trappings and luxury that occupied France offered. Sperrle became indebted but retained sufficient standing with Hitler for him to be loaned or given 50,000 &quot;Reichsmarks&quot;. In February 1945, Hitler gave him 100,000 &quot;Reichsmarks&quot; for his 60th birthday. During the war Hitler had occasionally given Sperrle artwork that may have been looted from occupied territories.

Analysts of Sperrle&#x27;s performance have been critical of his perceived inaction in Normandy and point to critical contemporary army reports on the failures of his command. Others have questioned Sperrle&#x27;s influence on the conduct of operations and suggested he was a convenient scapegoat for Göring. Sperrle remained embittered after the defeat in France. He was deemed unfit for a senior command and spent the rest of the war in the &quot;Führerreserve&quot;, effective from 5 October 1944. On 1 May 1945, Sperrle was arrested by the British Army and became a prisoner of war.

==Later life and trial==
Sperrle was captured by the Allies and charged with war crimes in the High Command Trial at the Subsequent Nuremberg Trials but was acquitted. He was again acquitted in June 1949 following a second hearing before a court in Munich. The court concluded that Sperrle had never been a member of the Nazi Party nor one of its affiliate organizations. After the war, he lived quietly and died in Munich on 2 April 1953. He was buried at the village cemetery in Thaining, Bavaria.

<doc id="787763" wikidata="Q5998422" url="?curid=787763" title="Ilium (Kurt Vonnegut)">
<text>Ilium is a fictional town in eastern New York state, used as a setting for many of Kurt Vonnegut&#x27;s novels and stories, including &quot;Player Piano&quot;, &quot;Cat&#x27;s Cradle&quot;, &quot;Slaughterhouse-Five&quot;, and the stories &quot;Deer in the Works&quot;, &quot;Poor Little Rich Town&quot;, and &quot;Ed Luby&#x27;s Key Club&quot;. The town is dominated by its major industry leader, the Ilium Works, which produces scientific marvels to assist, or possibly harm, human life. The Ilium Works is Vonnegut&#x27;s symbol for the &quot;impersonal corporate giant&quot; with the power to alter humankind&#x27;s destiny. The town has been compared to Zenith, the fictional setting in Sinclair Lewis&#x27;s 1922 novel &quot;Babbitt&quot;.

In one sense, the name may refer to Troy, New York because &quot;Ilium&quot; was the name the Romans gave to ancient Troy, although Troy is mentioned as a separate city in &quot;Player Piano&quot;.

In many other respects, Ilium closely resembles Schenectady, New York, with the fictional Iroquois River standing in for the real Mohawk River, which flows west–east through Schenectady. The Ilium Works is in roughly the same geographic location as the General Electric (GE) plant in Schenectady, where Vonnegut worked as a public relations writer. In &quot;Galápagos&quot; (1985), GEFFCo is cited as Ilium&#x27;s principal industry—GE having once been a principal employer in Schenectady. The city of Ilium is distinct from Schenectady in &quot;Player Piano&quot; (1952), &quot;Cat&#x27;s Cradle&quot; (1963), and &quot;Slaughterhouse-Five&quot; (1969). In those novels, characters refer to Schenectady as a separate place.

It also could be a reference to Ilion, NY because of the similar spelling and that Ilium may have been the intended name for the town of Ilion.

Cohoes, longtime residence of Vonnegut&#x27;s character Kilgore Trout, is in the vicinity of Ilium, and of the real towns that inspired it. For example, Cohoes is located immediately west of Troy. 

In &quot;Galápagos&quot;, Mary Hepburn was a high school teacher in Ilium and her husband Roy worked at GEFFCo. In &quot;Cat&#x27;s Cradle&quot;, Ilium is the former home of Dr. Felix Hoenikker—one of the fathers of the atomic bomb—thus, it is the town that Jonah visits to interview Dr. Asa Breed, Hoenikker&#x27;s former supervisor. In &quot;Player Piano&quot;, it is where most of the action takes place. In &quot;Slaughterhouse-Five&quot;, it is also the home town of the book&#x27;s primary protagonist, Billy Pilgrim.

<doc id="787766" wikidata="Q160805" url="?curid=787766" title="United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon">
<text>The United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (, ), or UNIFIL (, ), is a United Nations peacekeeping mission established on 19 March 1978 by United Nations Security Council Resolutions 425 and 426, and several further resolutions in 2006 to confirm Hezbollah demilitarisation, support Lebanese army operations against insurgents and weapon smuggling, and confirming Israeli withdrawal from Lebanon, in order to ensure that the government of Lebanon would restore its effective authority in the area. The 1978 South Lebanon conflict came in the context of Palestinian insurgency in South Lebanon and the Lebanese Civil War.

The mandate had to be adjusted due to the Israeli invasion of Lebanon in 1982 and after the Israeli withdrawal from Lebanon in 2000. Following the 2006 Lebanon War, the United Nations Security Council enhanced UNIFIL and added additional tasks to the mandate such as aiding displaced persons.

UNIFIL&#x27;s mandate is renewed annually by the United Nations Security Council; it was most recently extended on 28 August 2024 with the passing of United Nations Security Council Resolution 2749. It is composed of 10,000 peacekeepers from 46 nations, tasked with helping the Lebanese Army keep the south of the country protected from &quot;unauthorized armed personnel, such as Hezbollah&quot;. Its funding is approved on an annual basis by the General Assembly. It had a budget of $474 million for the period July 2018 to June 2019.

== Mandate ==


According to its Mandate, established by United Nations Security Council Resolutions 425 and 426 in 1978, UNIFIL is tasked with the following objectives:
*confirm the withdrawal of Israeli forces from southern Lebanon.
*restore international peace and security.
*assist the Government of Lebanon in ensuring the return of its effective authority in the area.
In addition, several further Security Council resolutions have reaffirmed and expanded the mission&#x27;s mandate, including:
*31 January 2006: SC Resolution 1655
*31 July 2006: SC Resolution 1697
*11 August 2006: SC Resolution 1701

Under SC Resolution 1701, UNIFIL&#x27;s mandate was expanded, giving it new duties:
*Monitor the cessation of hostilities.
*Accompany and support the Lebanese armed forces as they deploy throughout the South, including along the Blue Line, as Israel withdraws its armed forces from Lebanon.
*Coordinate its activities referred to in the preceding paragraph (above) with the Government of Lebanon and the Government of Israel.
*Extend its assistance to help ensure humanitarian access to civilian populations and the voluntary and safe return of displaced persons.
*Assist the Lebanese Armed Forces (LAF) in taking steps towards the establishment between the Blue Line and the Litani river of an area free of any armed personnel, assets and weapons other than those of the Government of Lebanon and of UNIFIL deployed in this area.
*Assist the Government of Lebanon, at its request, in securing its borders and other entry points to prevent the entry in Lebanon without its consent of arms or related materiel.

In addition, UNIFIL was also authorized to: take all necessary action in areas of deployment of its forces and as it deems within its capabilities, to ensure that its area of operations is not utilized for hostile activities of any kind, to resist attempts by forceful means to prevent it from discharging its duties under the mandate of the Security Council, and to protect United Nations personnel, facilities, installations and equipment, ensure the security and freedom of movement of United Nations personnel, humanitarian workers and, without prejudice to the responsibility of the Government of Lebanon, to protect civilians under imminent threat of physical violence.

==History==
The first UNIFIL troops deployed in the area on 23 March 1978 were reassigned from other UN peacekeeping operations in the area (United Nations Emergency Force, the United Nations Truce Supervision Organization, and the United Nations Disengagement Observer Force Zone). They were deployed after Israel launched Operation Litani earlier in the month, in response to a cross border raid by Palestinians based in Lebanon. UNIFIL made its headquarters in Naqoura close to the Lebanese-Israeli border.

The majority of the force&#x27;s initial personnel were provided by Canada, Iran and Sweden with support from France, Nepal and Norway. The initial force was established at 4,000 troops. This was increased to 6,000 in May 1978. Israeli forces withdrew from the area on 13 June 1978, after which South Lebanon Army (SLA) forces under Saad Haddad remained in the area. UNIFIL began patrolling operations and established a series of positions including checkpoints, roadblocks and observation posts.

UNIFIL operations during this time were hindered by restrictions that were imposed on its freedom of movement and a lack of co-operation by all parties to the conflict. There were several attacks on its personnel, including ambushes, kidnappings, shelling and sniping. As a result, only limited progress was made in fulfilment of its mandate between 1978 and 1982. During the occupation, UNIFIL&#x27;s function was mainly to provide humanitarian aid amidst the Lebanese Civil War.

=== Lebanese Civil War (until 1990) ===
Prior to the 1982 Lebanon War, on 2 January 1982 two Ghanaian soldiers guarding a UNIFIL position were attacked by unidentified persons and one of the soldiers was shot and subsequently died. In February 1982, the force was increased by a further 1,000 troops. During the 1982 Lebanon War, commencing on 6 June 1982, Israeli forces advanced into south Lebanon. Despite being ordered to block the advance, the UN positions were either bypassed or overrun, primarily by the SLA forces under Saad Haddad.

This was the main Lebanese paramilitary force supported by the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) in Southern Lebanon. The UN force was overwhelmed within a day. At least one Norwegian peacekeeper was killed in the initial attack. Following this, UNIFIL focused primarily on the distribution of aid and medical support, while a new force, the Multinational Force in Lebanon assumed primacy, being deployed in Beirut until being withdrawn in March 1984.

===South Lebanon conflict (until 2000)===
Beginning in 1985, Israel scaled back its permanent positions in Lebanon, although the IDF maintained some forces in Southern Lebanon, along with the SLA, to establish a security zone to prevent attacks on Israel from Lebanon. These forces were engaged by several groups, including Hezbollah.

UNIFIL&#x27;s role during this time was limited to mainly manning checkpoints and undertaking patrols, as its operations were constrained by the Israeli security zone in the south. Its personnel were attacked by elements on both sides of the conflict during this time, and financial issues also hampered UNIFIL operations as some UN member states withheld funding for the operation. In 1986, the force was reorganised when France decreased its contribution to UNIFIL. There was a proposal to convert the force into an observation group around this time, although this was ultimately rejected.

The period saw an Israel invasion in the 1982 Operation Peace in Galilee and another on a smaller scale in the 1993 Operation Accountability. In 1996 south Lebanon was bombarded by the Israeli army, airforce and navy for seventeen days. According to Amnesty International during the 1996 bombardment UNIFIL compounds and vehicles came under Israeli aircraft or artillery fire 270 times. This included the shelling of the Fijian UNIFIL compound near Qana where 102 villagers sheltering were killed.

In April 2000, Israel notified the UN Secretary General that it was withdrawing from south Lebanon. This process was completed by June 2000. After this, UNIFIL was able to resume its military tasks along the &quot;Blue Line&quot; (the UN identified line of withdrawal for the IDF) and the adjacent areas, where UNIFIL sought to maintain the ceasefire through patrols, observation from fixed positions, and close contact between Lebanese Armed Forces (LAF), as well as providing humanitarian assistance to the local population.

=== Conflict in 2006 ===
According to UNIFIL press releases, there were dozens of incidents of UN posts coming under fire during the 2006 Lebanon War. In his 21 July 2006 report about the UNIFIL activities 21 January – 18 July 2006, the Secretary-General of the United Nations Kofi Annan stated that &quot;Some Hezbollah positions remained in close proximity to United Nations positions, especially in the Hula area, posing a significant security risk to United Nations personnel and equipment.&quot;

==== Combat-related incidents ====
*On 17 July, a UNIFIL international staff member and his wife were killed when Israeli aircraft bombed the Hosh District of Tyre, Lebanon.
* On 23 July, Hezbollah fire wounded an Italian observer.
* On 25 July, Hezbollah opened small arms fire at a UNIFIL convoy, forcing it to retreat.
* On 25 July, four soldiers from the Ghanaian battalion were lightly injured after an Israeli tank shell hit a UNIFIL position during fighting in Southern Lebanon on 24 July 2006.
* Shrapnel from tank shells fired by the IDF seriously wounded an Indian soldier on 16 July 2006.
* On 25 July, four UNTSO observers from Austria, Canada, China and Finland were killed by Israeli strikes on an OGL (Observer Group Lebanon) patrol base near Khiam in southern Lebanon. According to the UN, the Israelis stated they were responding to &quot;Hezbollah fire from that vicinity&quot; and the four had taken shelter in a bunker under the post. The area around the site was hit by a precision guided bomb from an Israeli jet and shelled a total of 14 times by Israeli artillery throughout the day despite warning calls made by UN personnel to the IDF. However, General Alain Pellegrini, then commander of UNIFIL, claims that he attempted to call Israeli officials &quot;five or six times&quot;, but never got past their secretaries. Later, Israeli artillery shelling resumed as a rescue team tried to clear the rubble.
* On 29 July, two Indian soldiers were wounded when their post was damaged during an Israeli airstrike in Southern Lebanon.
* On 6 August, a Hezbollah rocket hit the headquarters of the Chinese UNIFIL contingent, wounding three Chinese soldiers.
* On 12 August, a Ghanaian soldier was wounded when Israeli artillery shelled the area near the village of Haris.

=== From August 2006 ===
==== Visit by Secretary-General ====
In order to stress the importance of implementing Security Council resolution 1701, UN Secretary-General Annan himself paid a visit to UNIFIL on the ground in August 2006.

==== Reinforcements ====
By July 2006, UNIFIL&#x27;s strength had dropped to its lowest, with only 1,980 personnel deployed. Following the cease-fire, UNIFIL received a large number of reinforcements, up to 15,000 men, and heavy equipment. France committed to increase its complement from 400 to 2,000 men and send Leclerc heavy tanks and AMX 30 AuF1 self-propelled artillery, in addition to the forces deployed in Opération Baliste. Italy committed to deploy 3,000 troops, while Qatar offered to send between 200 and 300 troops. As the French were preparing to deploy, French commander of UNIFIL Alain Pellegrini and the country&#x27;s foreign minister, Philippe Douste-Blazy, stated that France would not intervene to disarm Hezbollah.

A naval component of UNIFIL was set up to assist the Lebanese Navy as an interim measure to prevent arms proliferation to Hezbollah while the Lebanese Navy builds its capacity. For a period the force was German-led under the command of a German admiral before handing over to the Italians.

The Indonesian contingent received 12 VAB (Véhicule de l&#x27;Avant Blindé) on 17 February 2007, as the part of the second wave of shipments from the agreement between the French and Indonesian governments. Among the equipment sent with the second wave of VABs were 10 tool boxes (pioneering equipment), 10 armored vehicle radio communications units, HMG (Heavy Machine Gun) shooter shields, and 40 water jerrycans.

On 16 March 2009, KRI &quot;Diponegoro&quot;, an Indonesian joined the UNIFIL Naval Task Force. In August 2010, two Indonesian soldiers were criticized after they escaped from clashes between Israel and Lebanon by fleeing in a taxi.

The Israeli Ambassador to the UN, Ambassador Dan Gillerman, met with UNIFIL commander, Maj.-Gen. Claudio Graziano, on 15 August 2008, after Israel was accused of unilaterally violating United Nations Security Council Resolution 1701 by the almost daily overflights of Lebanese airspace, the continued occupation of the village of Ghajar, and Israel&#x27;s refusal to submit maps of areas on which it dropped cluster munitions during the 2006 Lebanese war.

Following the war, British military historian John Keegan predicted that Israel would in the future invade Lebanon and continue attacking until Hezbollah&#x27;s system of tunnels and bunkers was completely destroyed, as Israel would not tolerate a &quot;zone of invulnerability&quot; occupied by a sworn enemy, or a double threat posed by Hezbollah and Hamas rockets, and that Israel might first attack the Gaza Strip. Keegan noted that any IDF entry into Southern Lebanon would risk provoking a clash with UNIFIL, but that it is unlikely to deter Israel, as it tends to behave with &quot;extreme ruthlessness&quot; when national survival is at stake.

Many troops, including the Finnish, Irish, Qataris and Indonesians pulled out of UNIFIL in 2007–2008. Some of these nations had been there for over 30 years (the Irish and Finnish), and one of the reasons for the withdrawal was reportedly concerns about the changing rules of engagement following the arrival of NATO forces in August 2006 and because of high-level German and French statements expressing unlimited support to the Israeli side.

In November 2009, the Polish military contingent of UNIFIL had begun withdrawal. The process of withdrawing Polish forces ended on December 11, 2009, when the last units of the liquidation group left Lebanon.
In 2010, a series of standoffs and clashes erupted between UNIFIL troops and Lebanese villagers in the border region. Villagers accused French peacekeepers of provocative and intrusive patrols, and of taking pictures of people inside their homes. People of Aitaroun town, Marjayoun, accused the French regiments of driving their heavy vehicles through their two-month-old tobacco fields, which support many families. UNIFIL was also accused of having stepped up its patrols and of failing to coordinate with the Lebanese Army.

In July 2010, the most serious incident occurred when the French regiments decided to carry out exercises unilaterally, without Lebanese units or other regiments. When they went into narrow alleys of Lebanese villages some residents first tried to redirect them out of their private areas. The French fired against the civilians, arrested a youth driving a motorcycle, and destroyed the vehicle. When other civilians saw that, they surrounded and attacked the UNIFIL French troops without any weapons.

The vehicles&#x27; windows were smashed by stones from dozens of civilians of all ages, and the French commander was wounded. The French troops were forcibly disarmed by the villagers, and weapons were then handed over to the Lebanese Army. The French unit could not explain why they behaved unilaterally. Their ambassador to the UN said the civilian attack &quot;was not spontaneous&quot;.

At the request of the United Nations, 7,000 additional Lebanese soldiers were deployed to South Lebanon as approved by the Lebanese Cabinet.

==== UNIFIL force in 2010 Israel–Lebanon border clash ====


The 2010 Israel–Lebanon border clash occurred on 3 August 2010. It was the deadliest incident along the border since the devastating 2006 Lebanon War. The UN force stationed in southern Lebanon urged &quot;maximum restraint&quot; following the clashes along the so-called Blue Line, a UN-drawn border separating Lebanon from Israel. UNIFIL peacekeepers were in the area where the clashes took place. United Nations peacekeepers tried to hold off the routine Israeli tree-pruning that led to a deadly border clash with Lebanese soldiers. An Indonesian UN battalion was on the scene, and they did their best to try to prevent it, but they were unable to.

Indonesian peacekeepers tried to no avail to calm the situation before the clashes erupted. The fighting increasingly intensified, so the small contingent of UNIFIL forces was ordered to retreat or find cover then report back to the base. The Indonesian contingent, under intense small arms fire and shelling between the two opposing forces, retreated and returned to their base, but two soldiers fell behind and briefly became isolated before the stunned and exhausted soldiers were helped by some locals.

UN peacekeepers did not escape the confrontation unscathed. Local TV reported that in some cases, villagers attempted to block UNIFIL vehicles from fleeing the combat zone, demanding that they return and fight. However, current and former UNIFIL officials said that at that point in the conflict, it was out of peacekeepers&#x27; hands. One former UNIFIL official explained that he has been in these situations before, and when the opposing sides are determined to shoot each other, there is nothing UNIFIL force can do. Regarding concerns about UNIFIL&#x27;s neutrality, a former UNIFIL commander highlighted the importance of perception, stating that if UNIFIL forces intervened to protect IDF, UNIFIL would be accused by Hezbollah or the Lebanese people of protecting the Israelis. On the other hand, if UNIFIL forces were seen to favour the Lebanese, Israel would accuse UNIFIL of collaborating with Hezbollah.

=== Post-2006 deployment ===
Post 2006, UNIFIL was deployed throughout Southern Lebanon, south of the Litani River, and primarily along the United Nations-drawn Blue Line, the border between Israel and Lebanon. Since then, the force&#x27;s activities have centered around monitoring military activity between Hezbollah and the Israeli Defense Forces with the aim of reducing tensions and allaying tension along the border. UNIFIL has played an important role in clearing landmines, assisting displaced persons and providing humanitarian assistance to civilians in the underdeveloped region of Southern Lebanon.

Under UN Security Council Resolution 1701, which passed as a result of the 2006 Lebanon War, its mandate and rules of engagement changed. The mandate changed to allow up to 15,000 personnel in order to assist the Lebanese Armed Forces in deploying in Southern Lebanon to implement the Lebanese government&#x27;s sovereignty. The rules of engagement changed to allow the troops to open fire in certain cases: mostly in cases of self-defense but also in order to protect civilians, UN personnel and facilities.

The new resolution states that UNIFIL can &quot;take all the necessary action in areas of deployment of its forces, and as it deems with its capabilities, to ensure that its area of operations is not utilized for hostile activities of any kind.&quot;
On 27 August 2006, United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan said that UNIFIL would not intercept arms shipments from Syria, unless requested to do so by Lebanon.

=== Maritime Task Force ===

The Maritime Task Force (MTF) is the naval component of the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL). As of February 2012, the MTF was under the command of
Rear Admiral Wagner Lopes de Moraes Zamith of Brazil. The Brazilian frigate &quot;Constituição &quot; is the flagship of the fleet comprising vessels from Brazil, Bangladesh, Germany, Greece, Indonesia and Turkey.

After the 2006 Lebanon War, the UNIFIL Maritime Task Force (MTF) was established to assist the Lebanese Naval Forces in preventing the smuggling of illegal shipments in general and armament shipments in particular. With its establishment in October 2006, the force was led by the German Navy which was also the major contributor to the force. The Germans lead the MTF up until 29 February 2008 when they passed control over to EUROMARFOR – a force made up of ships from Portugal, Spain, Italy and France, of which the latter three countries sent vessels to the force in Lebanon.

=== Personnel ===

, UNIFIL employed 10,480 military personnel, including 500 women, from 41 countries. It is supported by 239 international civilian staff, including 78 women, and 583 national civilian staff, including 153 women. It is led by Spanish Major General Aroldo Lázaro Sáenz.

The UNIFIL military component also includes a contingent from Kazakhstan. The Kazakh peacekeeping forces joined the mission for the first time ever in late 2018. A total of 120 soldiers from Kazakhstan were deployed as part of the Indian battalion in Lebanon on 31 October 2018.

In 2019, UNSC resolution 2485 extended the mission&#x27;s mandate until August 2020 and reduced the troop ceiling from 15,000 to 13,000.

In November 2019 after ten years of absence, the Polish military contingent was returned.

=== Protecting cultural heritage ===
In April 2019, the United Nations Interim Force deployed a cultural asset in Lebanon with Blue Shield International. It was shown that cultural property protection (carried out by military and civil specialists) forms the basis for the future peaceful and economic development of a city, region or country in many conflict zones. The need for training and coordination of the military and civilian participants, including the increased involvement of the local population, became apparent especially at World Heritage Sites. The connection between cultural user disruption and causes of flight was explained by the President of Blue Shield International, Karl von Habsburg, who stated: &quot;Cultural assets are part of the identity of the people who live in a certain place. If you destroy their culture, you also destroy their identity. Many people are uprooted, often have no prospects anymore and subsequently flee from their homeland.&quot;

=== 2023 Israel–Hezbollah conflict ===

Israel and Hezbollah have exchanged fire across the Israel-Lebanon border since 8 October 2023. Hezbollah has fired rockets at targets in Israel, while the IDF has struck targets in Lebanon with artillery and drones.

On 17 and 18 September 2024, Israel attacked Hezbollah members with bombs concealed inside pagers and other small electronic devices.
On 20 September, an IDF airstrike hit Beirut. Similar bombardments followed throughout the rest of September.

On the evening of 30 September, the IDF invaded southern Lebanon with approximately 45,000 troops, while air strikes on Beirut and other targets throughout Lebanon continued. UNIFIL forces did not intervene, and remained in their positions. On 4 October, IDF told Irish UNIFIL personnel to withdraw from one of their positions. Representatives of the peacekeeping mission and the Irish government declined.

Due to the intensive military operations of Israel against Hezzbolah in southern Lebanon, 150 Polish soldiers from the 9th rotation could not return to the country and had to wait in shelters until the conflict escalated.

In the evening of 9 October, IDF soldiers &quot;deliberately fired at and disabled&quot; the video surveillance system at UNP 1-31 base, the lighting system, and a radio repeater at UNP 1-32A base with small arms fire, according to the UN. On 10 October 2024, Israeli troops opened fire on three UNIFIL positions in South Lebanon, including UNIFIL&#x27;s main base at Naqoura. Two Indonesian personnel were injured after an Israeli tank fired on an observation tower. The same day, Israel demanded the immediate withdrawal of all UNIFIL personnel located within 5 km of the Israeli-Lebanese border (meaning all the mission&#x27;s positions in South Lebanon). Contributing countries to the mission unanimously declined.

On October 11, the IDF again attacked the base at Naqoura. Two Sri Lankan peacekeepers were wounded, one seriously, and the perimeter wall was damaged by an IDF bulldozer. In the evening, the governments of France, Italy and Spain released a joint statement condemning the attacks. The US government also called on Israel not to attack UNIFIL bases. The UN called the attack a &quot;serious development&quot;. UNIFIL bases suffered heavy damage in clashes between the IDF and Hezbollah on the evening of 11 October. On 12 October, one Indonesian UNIFIL soldier was injured by Israeli fire.

On the same day, 12 October, Poland, together with a group of 43 other countries participating in the mission, condemned Israel&#x27;s attacks on UNIFIL forces, calling for an immediate cessation of the attacks and ensuring adequate protection for UN personnel in accordance with international law. The countries that joined the Polish initiative condemning the attacks on UNIFIL are: Armenia, Austria, Bangladesh, Brazil, Cambodia, China, Cyprus, Croatia, El Salvador, Estonia, Fiji, Finland, France, Germany, Ghana, Greece, Guatemala, Hungary, India, Indonesia, Ireland, Italy, Kazakhstan, South Korea, Latvia, Malaysia, Malta, Moldova, Mongolia, Nepal, Netherlands, North Macedonia, Peru, Qatar, Serbia, Sierra Leone, Spain, Sri Lanka, Tanzania, Turkey, United Kingdom, Uruguay.

On 13 October, the mission reported that two IDF Merkava tanks had forced their way inside a UNIFIL position after destroying its gate. According to a confidential report prepared by the government of one of UNIFIL&#x27;s contributing countries that was reviewed by the &quot;Financial Times&quot;, the Merkava tanks had remained in the base for 45 minutes after UNIFIL objections, but within an hour of their departure, multiple white phosphorus munitions were fired within 100 metres of the base, injuring 15 peacekeepers. Later that day, Israeli attacks on UNIFIL personnel and positions were condemned in a joint statement by 40 countries contributing to the peacekeeping mission. On 20 October, the IDF attacked a UNIFIL base in Marwahin, demolishing an observation tower and perimeter fence with an army bulldozer.

On October 21, 2024 a Croatian staff officer has returned to home because Croatia has not provided him with any military personnel for some time due to the high risk involved.

On 25 October, UNIFIL said in a statement that one of its observation towers near Dhayra had come under fire from Israeli troops on 22 October when they noticed the peacekeepers observing them &quot;conducting house clearing operations nearby&quot;. The mission said that the peacekeepers on duty withdrew from the tower &quot;to avoid being shot&quot; On 26 October, UNIFIL spokesperson Andrea Tenenti said the mission&#x27;s work was continuing, and &quot;We are still present at all our locations, and we mean every one of these sites.&quot;

By November 1, all Polish soldiers from the 9th rotation had returned to Poland.

== Assessment and controversy ==

Since its formation, UNIFIL has been repeatedly criticised and condemned as incompetent, ineffectual, &quot;a failure&quot; of the United Nations and &quot;largely meaningless&quot;. &quot;The New Republic&quot; reported in October 2006 that,Our military and W. intelligence sources reveal that Hizballah waited only one day after Israel&#x27;s final pull-out to set up checkpoints and declare its retaken strongholds with rockets &quot;closed military zones,&quot; which neither the Lebanese army nor UN peacekeepers have dared enter.A former Israeli diplomat, Itamar Rabinovich, criticised the efficacy of UNIFIL, describing it as &quot;a joke&quot; and stating &quot;They&#x27;ve been there for 26 years and since then, there have been so many skirmishes [along the border].&quot; Former Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert also said &quot;We didn&#x27;t like very much UNIFIL which was very useless and very helpless. Look what happened. Did you hear of any particular efforts of the United Nations UNIFIL force in the south of Lebanon to prevent the attacks against Israel in the first place. So they were not useful and that is why we were unhappy with them.&quot;

Both Israel and Hezbollah have accused UNIFIL of bias. Israel claims the force has allowed, if not aided, Hezbollah&#x27;s replenishment of military power. Hezbollah, in turn, alleges that &quot;certain contingents&quot; of UNIFIL are spying for, if not assisting, Israel. During deadly skirmishes between Lebanese and Israeli forces in 2010, UNIFIL was heavily criticized for failing to intervene, with two Indonesian soldiers filmed fleeing the battleground in a taxi.

UNIFIL has responded to the accusations of bias levied by both sides. On 26 July 2006, a former spokesman stated that upon the mission&#x27;s deployment in 1978, UNIFIL was &quot;accused of being sympathetic to Palestinians&quot;, as Hezbollah had not yet been established. &quot;A peacekeeping force does not come here with pre-set enemies. There is no enemy [inaudible] in a peacekeeping force. UNIFIL is a peacekeeping force. It&#x27;s not an Israeli combat force or an anti-terror force, as they would like it to be. As long as we don&#x27;t serve their direct interests, they are going to denigrate it as much as they can.&quot;

In February 2021, Lebanese journalist and opponent of Hezbollah Lokman Slim was abducted and murdered while in a UNIFIL-controlled area of Lebanon. According to the &quot;Los Angeles Review of Books,&quot;Lokman Slim was found slumped over in the passenger seat of his Toyota with four bullets to the head and one to the back on February 4. Though his car was found outside Addoussieh in South Lebanon, his phone was retrieved from a field 36 kilometers away in Niha al-Janoub, a village he frequented once a week to have lunch with a friend, a general in the Lebanese Army. That he was kidnapped and murdered but kilometers from the UNIFIL barracks, where around 600 French and 200 Finnish soldiers were stationed, was a message to more than activists.

=== Israeli concerns ===

Among Israel&#x27;s criticisms of UNIFIL are that it maintains dialogue with Hezbollah, which it views as a terrorist organization, and treats Israeli and Hezbollah violations of UNSC Resolution 1701 equally, while Israel views its violations of Lebanese airspace as less severe than Hezbollah&#x27;s violations including crossings of the blue line and rocket launches, namely because the presence of Hezbollah in southern Lebanon in and of itself is in violation of Resolution 1701. Israel and its primary allies in the west consider Hezbollah to be a terrorist organization and not a legitimate political party or representative of Lebanon. UNIFIL was accused of complicity in the fatal abduction of IDF soldiers in October 2000, and Israel further blamed it for obstructing its investigation by initially denying the existence of the attack and, upon the leaking of the incident&#x27;s occurrence, refusing to supply videos for several months.

Prior to the July 2006 Lebanon War, Israel had been lobbying for UNIFIL to either take a more active role vis-a-vis Hezbollah—for example, preventing Hezbollah from stationing near UNIFIL posts to fire at the IDF and into northern Israel—or to step out of the region, which would thereby void the Lebanese government&#x27;s excuse for not deploying Lebanese Armed Forces along the border.

UNIFIL also came under criticism during the 2006 Lebanon War for broadcasting detailed reports of Israeli troop movements, numbers, and positions on their website which &quot;could have exposed Israeli soldiers to grave danger&quot;, while making no such reports about Hezbollah. UNIFIL&#x27;s actions could have been motivated by the fact that Israel was, as a response to Hezbollah rocket fire (which Hezbollah alleges to have been a reaction to Israeli &quot;border violations&quot;) and to the kidnapping of Israeli soldiers, conducting a ground invasion of Lebanon at that time. Israel was concerned when it was reported that Indonesia was being considered to replace Italy as commander of UNIFIL&#x27;s naval force. As Indonesia does not recognize Israel, and the two countries have no diplomatic or military relations, Israel expressed concern that cooperation with the IDF, especially the Israeli Navy, could deteriorate.

A 2010 book published by Norwegian journalist Odd Karsten Tveit revealed that the Norwegian Army was complicit in the escape of two Lebanese men who were arrested by the Israeli Army and being held in Khiam prison. According to the book, in 1992, two detained Lebanese men escaped from Khiam prison. Fearing that they would face torture or execution if caught by the Israel Defense Forces or South Lebanon Army, the soldiers dressed the detainees in UN uniforms, and placed them in a UNIFIL convoy which left Southern Lebanon through Israeli roadblocks. Shortly afterward, Israeli Army commander Moshe Tamir visited the Norwegian battalion&#x27;s camp, and accused Norwegian commander Hagrup Haukland of &quot;sheltering terrorists&quot;. Immediately after the confrontation, the Lebanese men were smuggled onto a bus used by Norwegian peacekeepers on leave, which took them to Beirut.

=== Hezbollah concerns ===
Hezbollah supporters have accused UNIFIL of siding with Israel, especially since the passage of Resolution 1701 which they view as one-sided. On 16 October 2006, Lebanon&#x27;s top Shiite cleric Grand Ayatollah Sayyed Mohammad Hussein Fadlallah declared that the UN force had &quot;come to protect Israel, not Lebanon&quot;, echoing the sentiment of the leader of Hezbollah – Sayed Hassan Nasrallah, who previously said &quot;They are ashamed of us, brothers and sisters. They are ashamed of saying they came to defend us, but they talk about defending Israel.&quot;

=== Southern Lebanese reception ===

In the summer of 2010, relations soured between the French contingent and residents in several villages that led to injuries on both sides, after a French regiment began an exercise to identify Hezbollah members that included searching homes, taking photographs, using sniffer dogs, and questioning residents. Residents accused them of violating private property, treating them with contempt, and of not coordinating with the Lebanese army. The residents made clear that their conflict was only with the French contingent, and that relations with other contingents were good. Following discussions between UNIFIL commanders, ambassadors of countries with soldiers in UNIFIL, and the commander of the Lebanese army, an agreement was reached under which sniffer dogs would no longer be used, UNIFIL soldiers would refrain from entering Lebanese homes and yards, and only Lebanese army soldiers would carry out searches of homes.

Generally, relations between UNIFIL and local residents have been good. UNIFIL forces have offered various services to the locals, and have introduced elements of their own culture. India&#x27;s UNIFIL contingent has carried out small-scale development projects, operates medical and dental clinics, veterinary care for local animals, and also runs entertainment camps for children and yoga classes.

The Indonesian UNIFIL contingent (INDOBATT) also gained a good reputation among the South Lebanese people through the Civil Military Coordination (CIMIC) program implemented by the contingent. This program has included many community-based activities, including computer courses for local residents, medical assistance and also technical assistance in rebuilding social facilities.

The French contingent has taught poetry courses to local Francophone residents as well as French vocabulary and grammar to primary school students in 15 schools, the Italian contingent has given cooking lessons, the South Korean contingent has taught Taekwondo, and the Chinese contingent has taught Tai chi.
An official source within the Lebanese government informed &quot;Al Jazeera&quot; that, despite UNIFIL&#x27;s shortcomings, the force had been responsible for regularly hosting and mediating negotiations between Lebanese and Israeli forces, helping to defuse tensions. The source also claimed that prior to the mission&#x27;s deployment in 1978, southern Lebanon was far more chaotic and unstable, and that UNIFIL&#x27;s departure would lead to an outbreak of more conflict.

== Confrontations ==
===Israel===
On 22 September 2006, French Air Force jets were seen over the skies of Beirut during Hassan Nasrallah&#x27;s victory speech, possibly trying to protect him from an Israeli assassination attempt. Nasrallah told the crowd that he had no fear in addressing the masses directly, rather than through armored glass. On 28 September, two Israeli Merkava tanks, an armored bulldozer, and a number of military vehicles entered Lebanon and established a road block 500 meters away from the road leading to Marwahin village.

The IDF force asked to advance deeper into Lebanese territory but they were confronted by four United Nations Leclerc tanks operated by French troops, which blocked their advance. The confrontation lasted for half an hour, in which Israeli soldiers confiscated the identity cards of photographers at the scene, claiming they may give pictures of the Israeli military to Hezbollah members. According to American and German correspondents, the French retreated, while the French commander claimed that the Israelis had turned back.

Following the war, Hezbollah was widely reported to be rearming with the help of Iran and Syria, which were reportedly smuggling weaponry and munitions into Lebanon to replenish Hezbollah&#x27;s depleted stocks. Israel accused UNIFIL of failing to prevent Hezbollah&#x27;s rearmament and thus failing to implement Resolution 1701. The Israeli Air Force began flying reconnaissance sorties over Lebanon to monitor Hezbollah&#x27;s rearmament, with Israel announcing they would continue until Resolution 1701 was fully implemented. This led to repeated confrontations with UNIFIL.

On 3 October 2006, an Israeli fighter jet penetrated the defense perimeter of the French Navy frigate &quot;Courbet&quot; without answering radio calls, triggering a diplomatic incident. Israel apologized after official protests from the French government.

On 24 October, six Israeli Air Force F-16 jets flew over the German Navy intelligence ship &quot;Alster&quot;, patrolling off Israel&#x27;s coast just south of the Lebanese border. The German Defense Ministry said that the planes had given off infrared decoys and one of the aircraft had fired two shots into the air, which had not been specifically aimed. The Israeli military said that a German helicopter took off from the vessel without having coordinated this with Israel, and denied vehemently having fired any shots at the vessel and said &quot;as of now&quot; it also had no knowledge of the jets launching flares over it.

Israeli Defense Minister Amir Peretz telephoned his German counterpart Franz Josef Jung to clarify that &quot;Israel has no intention to carry out any aggressive actions&quot; against the German peacekeeping forces in Lebanon, who are there as part of UNIFIL to enforce an arms embargo against Hezbollah. Germany confirmed the consultations, and that both sides were interested in maintaining good cooperation. The &quot;Alster&quot;&#x27;s crew had recorded several overflights by Israeli jets in the previous weeks, but claimed that the Israeli aircraft had always stayed at high altitude. The week before the incident, Israeli jets had confronted a German naval helicopter, but turned back after the Germans identified themselves.

Shortly after the war, UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan, reporting to the Security Council, stated that there were no serious incidents or confrontations, but that peacekeepers reported Israeli flyovers &quot;almost on a daily basis&quot;. UNIFIL commander Alain Pellegrini claimed that Israeli flyovers violated the cease-fire and Lebanese sovereignty, and warned that if the diplomatic efforts to stop the overflights failed, force might be used to stop them. Israeli military sources reported that Israel would bomb UNIFIL positions if Israeli aircraft were attacked. On 23 October, sources in the Israeli defense establishment said that intelligence gathered by the sorties had revealed that Hezbollah was rebuilding its military infrastructure. Israeli Defense Minister Amir Peretz told the cabinet that surveillance flights over Lebanon would continue in light of the fact that arms smuggling between Syria and Lebanon continued.

On 31 October 2006, eight Israeli F-15s flew over many areas of Lebanon, including Beirut. The jets also flew over a French position in Lebanon. According to the French Defense Minister Michele Alliot-Marie, the planes came in at what was interpreted as an attack formation, and the peacekeepers were &quot;two seconds away&quot; from firing at the jets with an anti-aircraft missile.

On 6 September, during a European Union meeting in Brussels, the French Defense Minister announced that the Israeli Air Force had stopped mock air attacks over UNIFIL positions. On 17 November, two Israeli F-15s overflew UN positions at low altitude and high speed while two reconnaissance planes circled the headquarters of the French battalion. French peacekeepers responded by readying their anti-aircraft batteries, and warned that Israeli warplanes conducting mock attacks could be fired on.

The IAF continued its reconnaissance flights over Lebanon, and despite strong protests, UNIFIL peacekeeping forces did not follow through on their threats to fire at Israeli aircraft. The Lebanese government reported hundreds of overflights by Israeli aircraft, and also claimed that Israeli troops had illegally crossed the border dozens of times, including into the disputed Shebaa farms area.

On 11 October 2024, IDF fired on UNIFIL positions in southern Lebanon, injuring two peacekeepers after striking a watchtower at UNIFIL&#x27;s headquarters in Ras an-Naqoura. UNIFIL labeled the attacks as deliberate violations of international humanitarian law. Various international actors, including the US, EU, UK, Italy, France, Spain and Ireland, condemned the attack, calling for accountability and the protection of peacekeepers.

=== Militias ===
A battle took place on May 9, 1978, in the town of Kaukaba when PLO soldiers attacked Norwegian peacekeepers. The battle took place about six weeks after the first Norwegian troops arrived in Lebanon. The skirmish is regarded as one of the hardest battles fought by Norwegian soldiers in the UNIFIL force, and the PLO soldiers got as close as 30 meters. Throughout the skirmish, the Norwegians fired about 200 machine gun shots, 50 shots from automatic weapons and two Carl Gustav RFK grenades. The PLO fired about ten times more shots from hand weapons, as well as eight gun grenades. Eventually the PLO gave up, and pledged not to fire at the Norwegians again. One Norwegian suffered light injuries during the attack. Official PLO casualties were one dead and one wounded. The Norwegian soldiers believed the real number of Palestinians dead to be closer to eight.

On 6 April 1980, clashes between UNIFIL peacekeepers and the South Lebanon Army, an Israeli-backed Lebanese militia, began when the SLA attacked Irish troops based in At Tiri. The Irish soldiers held their ground and called in Dutch and Fijian peacekeepers as reinforcements. The battle ended on 12 April when the Dutch contingent employed TOW missiles against the SLA. During the battle, two UNIFIL peacekeepers were killed: Stephen Griffin, a 21-year-old Private from the 46th Irish Battalion, from Rahoon in County Galway, and Sevati Sovonaivalu of the Fijian Army. One SLA soldier, 19-year old Massoud Bazzi, was also killed.

On 18 April 1980, two Irish soldiers were killed in the area. In December 2020, a Lebanese military court found ex-militia member Mahmoud Bazzi, brother of Massoud, guilty of the murders of Private Thomas Barrett and Private Derek Smallhorne in April 1980. The court sentenced Bazzi to life in prison. It immediately reduced this sentence to 15 years on the basis of him being aged 76 at the time of conviction.

On 24 June 2007, six UNIFIL soldiers, three Colombians and three Spanish, were killed after their vehicle was hit by an explosive device. Two others, both Spanish, were injured in the incident. No group has yet admitted responsibility, although the Israeli military believed the attack was perpetrated by members of al-Qaeda.

== Casualties ==
===Fatalities===
As of 31 July 2024, UNIFIL has had 326 fatalities since 1978. They include the following nationalities:

<text>Nathaniel &quot;The Bishop&quot; Crisp (1762-1819) - an 18th-century character in the city of Nottingham, England.

He was the fourth child and fourth son born to gardener Hemus Crisp &amp; Elisabeth Dodd of Nottingham. Known as Bishop Crisp, he was a butcher by trade, who carried out his business at the corner of Lister-gate and Broad-marsh in the City of Nottingham. He was the principal baptiser during the famous duckings at Nottingham in 1794, where the River Leen and the local canal served as the River Jordan, in which the baptism by immersion took place.

The sprinkling process was performed chiefly at the Exchange pump, while the spectators sang:
:&quot;We&#x27;ll pump upon them till they sing, Upon their knees, God save the King&quot;.

&quot;The Bishop&quot; was convicted at the Spring Assizes of the following year for his riotous conduct during the ducking season, fined a nominal sum, and imprisoned for six months. He died in May, 1819.

He married Fanny Horseley in 1789, and they had four children Fanny (1792), Nathaniel (1795), Edward (1797) &amp; Henry Nelson Crisp (1807).

<doc id="787769" wikidata="Q766275" url="?curid=787769" title="Hungarian Democratic Forum">
<text>The Hungarian Democratic Forum (, , MDF) was a centre-right political party in Hungary. It had a Hungarian nationalist, national-conservative, Christian-democratic ideology. The party was represented continuously in the National Assembly from the restoration of democracy in 1990 until 2010. It was dissolved on 8 April 2011.

The MDF was the largest party on Hungary&#x27;s emergence as a democratic country under the leadership of József Antall, Prime Minister between 1990 and 1993. Since then, its representation receded, with the party playing the role of junior coalition partner to Fidesz from 1998 to 2002, and in opposition otherwise.

It was a member of the Centrist Democrat International and was a member of the European People&#x27;s Party until 2009, when it joined the Alliance of European Conservatives and Reformists. The MDF&#x27;s first MEP, Péter Olajos, was a member of the European People&#x27;s Party–European Democrats group from 2004 to 2009, while Lajos Bokros sat with the European Conservatives and Reformists from 2009 in the European Parliament.

==History==

=== Foundation ===

The Hungarian Democratic Forum was founded in autumn of 1987, during the one-party rule of the Hungarian Socialist Workers&#x27; Party (MSzMP). Its first meeting was in the village of Lakitelek in southern Hungary on 27 September 1987. Initially it was rather a loose political movement than a party.

Its founders were mostly nationally minded intellectuals, including Sándor Csoóri, Zoltán Bíró, István Csurka and Sándor Lezsák. They stood in the ideological tradition of the &quot;népi-nemzeti&quot; (&quot;populist-&quot; or &quot;rural-national&quot;) movement, which has been opposed to the &quot;urbánus&quot; (&quot;urbanist&quot;) school of thought since the end of the 19th century. The Forum focused on national and cultural traditions, aimed at radically democratic grassroots politics and a &quot;third way&quot; between capitalism and communism. One of the issues that bothered them was the menacing situation of the ethnic Hungarian minority in neighbouring Romania under Nicolae Ceaușescu.

Its opposition against the communist rule was more moderate than the mostly urban and pro-Western liberal Alliance of Free Democrats (SzDSz) and Alliance of Young Democrats (FiDeSz), that were created shortly after. Unlike them, the MDF sought an alliance with reform-oriented elements within the MSzMP, namely the politburo-member Imre Pozsgay, who had participated in the Lakitelek meeting and who was then secretary-general of the Patriotic People&#x27;s Front (HNF), the umbrella organisation of the communist-aligned mass organisations. The Forum was seen as a &quot;constructive&quot; opposition and not as great a danger as the Free Democrats around János Kis.

=== Time of upheaval (1988–1989) ===
At a second meeting in Lakitelek, one year after the first, the Hungarian Democratic Forum announced its foundation. This was made possible by the Association and Assembly Act of September 1988. In order not to be diminished by a &quot;divide and rule&quot; tactic, the different oppositional groups joined in the &quot;Opposition Round Table talks&quot; in March 1989. They participated in the tripartite National Round Table with MSzMP and mass organisations beginning in June 1989.

The Round Table could not solve all contentious points. In particular, there was discord among the oppositional parties if direct presidential elections should be held before the end of the year. The MSzMP had transformed into the Hungarian Socialist Party (MSzP) in October 1989 and Imre Pozsgay was considered a strong contender in direct presidential elections. Given its good relations with Pozsgay, the MDF did not oppose this possibility. Free Democrats and Fidesz, on the other hand, wanted to prevent a directly elected, Socialist president at any rate and therefore called for a referendum, that was held in November 1989. The SzDSz heavily attacked the MDF as &quot;the Communists&#x27; friends&quot; or &quot;collaborators&quot;. While the proponents of the referendum suggested that parliamentary elections should be held first, the MDF supported direct presidential elections and therefore called for a &quot;no&quot; in this question. Eventually, the &quot;yes&quot; campaign won by a narrow margin.

In October 1989 the party voted József Antall to be its president. With Antall&#x27;s taking over from founding president Zoltán Bíró, the MDF shifted gradually away from the &quot;népi-nemzeti&quot; principles in their pure form. Antall represented a broadly national-liberal or liberal-conservative tendency, opening the party for a wider political spectrum and social base, especially the national-minded and Christian middle class. It transformed into a right-of-centre &quot;omnibus&quot; party, or even a &quot;catch-all party&quot;.

=== Government period (1990–1994) ===
In March and April 1990, the MDF won the first free parliamentary elections after the end of Communism in Hungary with 24.7% of the votes and 164 of 386 seats. It formed a centre-right government coalition with the ideologically close Independent Smallholders Party (FKgP) and Christian Democratic People&#x27;s Party (KDNP). József Antall became prime minister.

The MDF was now divided in two major internal tendencies. The dominant one was Antall&#x27;s government circle, characterised by pragmatic, liberal conservatism, constitutionalism and legalism. The Antall government carried important reforms through that completed Hungary&#x27;s transition from communist rule, e.g. laws on local administration, the status of civil servants and redemption of the old regime&#x27;s wrongs. Still, traditional and religious values and national ideas played a greater role in the MDF&#x27;s rhetorics than in its conservative and Christian democratic counterparts in Western European countries.

The right-wing, radically populist and national faction within the party was characterised by vocal anti-communism as well as anti-liberalism. Its proponents called for a systematic &quot;cleansing&quot; of public positions from former communists, demanded the sacking of supposedly &quot;un-national&quot; responsibles at TV and radio stations, and also attacked the liberal SzDSz, which they viewed as &quot;cosmopolitan&quot;, &quot;liberal-bolshevik&quot; and &quot;Jewish&quot; and therefore incompatible with the ordinary Hungarians&#x27; mindset. After 1992, the distance of the national radicals to the moderate governmental wing grew progressively, and in 1993 most of them led by István Csurka left the party to found far-right parties, most notably the Hungarian Justice and Life Party (MIÉP).

After Antall&#x27;s death in December 1993, he was succeeded by his party colleague Péter Boross, who led the government until the parliamentary election of May 1994.

=== Alliance with Fidesz (1994–2006) ===
The 1994 poll brought a devastating defeat for the MDF which dropped to 12.0% of the votes and 38 seats, putting it on a distant third place behind the resurged Socialists and the liberal SzDSz. While in opposition, internal quarrels continued and intensified between conservatives, like Boross and Sándor Lezsák, and centrists around Iván Szabó. After Lezsák won the leadership vote in 1996, Szabó and most of the governmental figures of the Antall period left the party and founded the Hungarian Democratic People&#x27;s Party (MDNP). In the 1998 parliamentary election, both parties performed very disappointingly (MDF: 2.8%; MDNP: 1,3%). However, the MDF had fielded joint candidates with Fidesz – that had turned from liberal to conservative after 1994 – in some constituencies and thus secured 17 seats in parliament. The party joined a Fidesz-led coalition government under Prime Minister Viktor Orbán which also included the Smallholders Party.
The MDF was admitted to the European People&#x27;s Party (EPP) as an observer in 1998, becoming an associate member in 2001 and a full member in 2004. From 1999 to 2010, the party was led by Ibolya Dávid.

The MDF had 24 seats in the National Assembly between 2002 and 2006, due to an electoral alliance with Fidesz.

In the 2004 European Parliamentary Elections it gained 5.3% (164,025 votes) of the vote and one of its members, Péter Olajos, was elected as a Member of the European Parliament (MEP), sitting with the EPP-ED Group.

The party received 5.04% (272,831 votes) of the votes in the 2006 parliamentary elections, thus securing its place in the next Parliament.

=== Decline (2006–2010) ===
MDF had essentially split, with the majority of its parliamentary representatives ousted from the party. Ibolya Dávid regularly accused Fidesz, the largest conservative force in Hungary of trying to annex her party. The two parties had a bitter quarrel following the first round of the 2006 parliamentary elections on the possible withdrawal of MDF candidates to support the Fidesz: the presidency of the party decided not to do this. However, a number of MDF candidates decided to withdraw at their own discretion.

In 2008, the presidential election turned into a scandal, where Ibolya Dávid said that people associated with UD Ltd. had attempted to interfere with internal affairs of her party, and released secretly recorded telephone conversations as evidence. Dávid and his supporters forced MDF politician Kornél Almássy to withdraw from running for party chairman at a party congress to re-elect officials.

MDF was a member of the EPP, but on 22 June 2009 its newly elected MEP Lajos Bokros joined the European Conservatives and Reformists (ECR) group in the European Parliament instead of the EPP Group. This led to the party&#x27;s suspension from the EPP. Instead, it joined the Alliance of European Conservatives and Reformists (AECR), that was founded in October 2009. On 8 October 2009, Ibolya Dávid was a guest speaker at the annual conference of the British Conservative Party, to confirm a long-term strategic alliance between the two parties in Europe.

Bokros&#x27; nomination indicated a change of political position from conservative to liberal ideology. As a result, several prominent members left the party, including Péter Olajos, Kálmán Katona and former Prime Minister Péter Boross. With MP András Csáky&#x27;s quit, the Hungarian Democratic Forum&#x27;s parliamentary group defunct according to the house rules in March 2009.

In 2010, Lajos Bokros became the party&#x27;s candidate for the position of prime minister in the 2010 parliamentary election, and several other former left-wing politicians were placed on the national list, for instance writer József Debreczeni and Zoltán Somogyi, a political analyst of the Political Capital. Furthermore, MDF entered into an electoral alliance with SzDSz, which suffered a crushing defeat during the 2009 European Parliament election. Its chairman Attila Retkes received a place on the national list and there were also joint candidates in some constituencies. After the decision, the quits became a mass phenomenon, whole local party organizations ceased to exist. On the national election, MDF came to the fifth place and received only 2.67% of the votes, thus shut out of the legislature altogether for the first time since the transition to democracy, after twenty years. Ibolya Dávid immediately resigned from her position and retired from the politics.

== Dissolution ==
Upon the resignation of Dávid, her deputy Károly Herényi was elected interim president of the now extra-parliamentary party. In June 2010, Zsolt Makay became the new president. The newly elected leadership decided to transform the party and adopted a new name, Welfare and Freedom (JESZ) on 12 December 2010. The party&#x27;s congress approved the change of name in March 2011, as a result Democratic Community of Welfare and Freedom (JESZ) was formed officially on 8 April 2011.

The leadership of the JESZ called Bokros several times to give back his MEP mandate, but all relationship has been lost between Bokros and his former party.

<doc id="787770" wikidata="Q57137" url="?curid=787770" title="Paul Ludwig Ewald von Kleist">
<text>Paul Ludwig Ewald von Kleist (8 August 1881 – 13 November 1954) was a German Generalfeldmarschall (Field Marshal) of the &quot;Wehrmacht&quot; during World War II. Born into the Prussian noble family von Kleist, Kleist entered the Prussian Army in 1900 and commanded a cavalry squadron during World War I. Kleist joined the &quot;Reichswehr&quot; of inter-war Germany before being discharged in 1938.

Recalled to active duty at the beginning of World War II, Kleist commanded a motorised corps in the Invasion of Poland. He then became the commander of Panzer Group Kleist (later 1st Panzer Army), the first operational formation of several Panzer corps in the Wehrmacht during the Battle of France, the Battle of Belgium, the Invasion of Yugoslavia and Operation Barbarossa, the invasion of the Soviet Union.

During the Battle of France, units under Kleist&#x27;s command included Heinz Guderian&#x27;s armoured corps and spearheaded the &quot;blitzkrieg&quot; attack through the Ardennes forest, outflanking the Maginot Line. His panzer divisions eventually pushed deep into France, resulting in Allied defeat. He then commanded the 1st Panzer Army as it drove deep into Ukraine and the Caucasus during Operation Barbarossa.

Kleist was appointed commander-in-chief of Army Group A during the last days of Case Blue, the 1942 German summer offensive in southern Russia. His disagreements with Hitler over strategic decisions led to his dismissal in March 1944 after the German defeat in right-bank Ukraine.

Following the war, Kleist was extradited to the Soviet Union where he was sentenced to 25 years in prison for war crimes; he died in prison.

==Early military career==
Paul Ludwig Ewald von Kleist was born in Braunfels into the House of Kleist, an old Pomeranian noble family with a long history of military service. There had been two previous Prussian field marshals, numerous generals and &quot;Pour le Mérite&quot; recipients in the family. He was the son of &quot;Geheimer Studienrat&quot; Christof &quot;Hugo&quot; Albrecht August von Kleist (1848-1886), a high-ranking civil servant, and his wife, Elisabeth Gley (b. 1856).

At the age of 18, Kleist joined the Prussian field artillery regiment, &quot;&quot;General Feldzeugmeister&quot; No. 3&quot; on 9 March 1900 as a &quot;fahnenjunker&quot;. He was commissioned as a &quot;leutnant&quot; on 18 August 1901. He became a battalion adjutant in 1904 and regimental adjutant in 1907. After attending the cavalry school at Hanover from 1908 to 1909, he was promoted to &quot;oberleutnant&quot; in 1910 and was sent to the prestigious War Academy in Berlin, to undergo general staff training. On 22 March 1914 he was promoted to captain and joined the 1st Life Hussars Regiment (&quot;Leib-Husaren-Regiment No. 1&quot;).

During the First World War, Kleist served on the Eastern Front and commanded a cavalry squadron at the Battle of Tannenberg. From 1915 to 1918 he served as a staff officer of the Guards Cavalry Division on the Western Front.

==Inter-war period==
After the First World War ended, Kleist joined the &quot;Freikorps&quot; and participated in the Latvian and Estonian Wars of Independence as a member of the Iron Division. In June 1919, he led an attack group during the Battle of Cēsis.

Kleist joined the &quot;Reichswehr&quot; in 1920. From 1924 to 1928, he was assigned as a tactics instructor at the Hannover Cavalry School. In 1928, he served as the chief of staff of the 2nd Cavalry Division in Breslau, then from 1929 to 1931, he held the same position in the 3rd Division in Berlin. Kleist was promoted to Colonel in 1931 and was given command of the 9th (Prussian) Infantry Regiment in Potsdam. At the beginning of 1932, he was given command of the 2nd Cavalry Division. In October 1932, he was promoted to Major General.

Kleist was a monarchist, and did not heavily involve himself in the politics of the Weimar Republic. He openly favored the restoration of the House of Hohenzollern. After the Nazis seized power, the &quot;Reichswehr&quot; was united with the newly formed &quot;Wehrmacht&quot;. On 1 December 1933, he was promoted to lieutenant general. In October 1934, he was given command of the &quot;Breslau Army&quot;, which was later reorganized into the VIII. Army Corps. In 1935, he was given command of the newly formed military district VIII responsible for Silesia while simultaneously serving as the commanding general of the VIII. Army Corps. On 1 August 1936, he was promoted to General of the Cavalry.

Kleist was a member of the Order of Saint John, an ancient Protestant religious order. In 1935, Prince Oskar of Prussia, the Order&#x27;s Grand Master, made him a Knight of Justice of the Order.

After the war, Kleist claimed that being forced to listen to the proclamation of the antisemitic Nuremberg Laws was a &quot;great humiliation&quot; of his life. On February 5, 1938, during the Blomberg–Fritsch affair when Hitler purged the army of staff who were unsympathetic to the Nazi regime, Kleist was forced to retire from service for his monarchist attitudes. Despite his forced retirement, Kleist received a significant departing honor when he was authorized to wear the uniform of the 8th Cavalry Regiment. According to Kleist, he withdrew from the army because he spoke out too loudly in favor of Christianity and the church, which clashed with Nazi ideology. To secure his retirement, he acquired a property near Breslau.

==World War II==

At the outbreak of the Second World War, Kleist was recalled to active duty and led the XXII Motorised Corps in the Invasion of Poland. Kurt Zeitzler, the future Chief of the Army General Staff, served as his Chief of Staff. His corps broke through the southern wing of the Polish army. According to Kleist, during the campaign, he successfully utilized cavalry tactics with his motorized units. Kleist&#x27;s units also encountered friendly Soviet units invading Poland from the east; his first impression of them was positive. He particularly noted their surprising extent of motorization, good behavior and advanced military technique.

===Invasion of France===

In May 1940, Panzer Group Kleist was formed, the first operational formation of several Panzer corps in the Wehrmacht. Zeitzler continued to serve as Kleist&#x27;s Chief of Staff. Panzer Group Kleist, consisting of XIV Corps under Wietersheim, XLI Panzer Corps under Reinhardt, and XIX Panzer Corps under Heinz Guderian, played a pivotal role in the Invasion of Belgium, France and the Low Countries. On 10 May, it spearheaded the German breakthrough in the Ardennes. As it advanced through southern Belgium, Kleist and Guderian clashed over where the main point of effort should fall. Kleist, Guderian&#x27;s immediate superior, pressed for the main point to come at Flize, further west than Sedan. Kleist argued that the blow would avoid a double river crossing at the Meuse (at Sedan) and Ardennes canal (to the west of Sedan). Moreover, the blow would strike at the dividing line between the French Ninth Army and the French Second Army. Guderian saw things differently, and pointed out that a thrust along the lines of Kleist&#x27;s plan would put the flank of the advance within range of the fortress artillery at Charleville-Mézières, some northwest of Sedan. The shift of operations further north would also disperse concentration (or &quot;Schwerpunkt&quot;) and disrupt the intense planning of the German tactical units, who had been in training for the Sedan attack and an advance north-west, for months. He also felt that a regrouping period in front of Sedan would delay the assault for 24 hours and allow the French to bring up reinforcements. Kleist agreed that such a delay was unacceptable, so he agreed to Guderian&#x27;s plan. Panzer Group Kleist overwhelmed the French defenses at Sedan, advanced west and reached the sea, forming a huge pocket containing several Belgian, British, and French armies. Kleist said of his role in the French campaign after the war:

===Invasion of Yugoslavia===

Kleist was promoted to &quot;Generaloberst&quot; on 19 July 1940 and received the Knight&#x27;s Cross of the Iron Cross. In April 1941, Panzer Group Kleist was renamed to 1st Panzer Group, and spearheaded the invasion of Yugoslavia. Deployed against central Yugoslavia (Serbia), units of the 1st Panzer Group were the first to enter Belgrade.

===Invasion of the Soviet Union===
In June 1941, with the launching of Operation Barbarossa, Kleist led the 1st Panzer Group as part of Army Group Southtasked with the capture of Moldavia and Ukraineand saw success in the initial phase of the invasion, advancing deep into Ukraine. The 1st Panzer Group broke through the Stalin Line, then defeated the five mechanized corps of the Soviet 5th Army and 6th Army in the Battle of Brody (23 to 30 June 1941). In July 1941, during the Battle of Uman, the 1st Panzer Group broke through the Soviet Southern Front&#x27;s lines, leading to the encirclement and annihilation of the Soviet 6th and 12th armies to the southeast of Uman city (in present-day Cherkasy Oblast). During the First Battle of Kiev of August–September 1941, 1st Panzer Group&#x27;s northward turn from central Ukraine in conjunction with 2nd Panzer Group&#x27;s southward advance from Smolensk led to the encirclement and destruction of the entire Soviet Southwestern Front east of Kiev, inflicting over 600,000 losses on the Red Army. However, the campaign had been costly, leaving the German forces with just half the tanks they had had three months earlier.

Kleist was very favorably impressed by the Red Army. He remarked after the war: &quot;The men were first-rate &quot;fighters&quot; from the start, and we owed our success simply to superior training. They became first-rate &quot;soldiers&quot; with experience. They fought most toughly, had amazing endurance, and could carry on without most of the things other armies regarded as necessities. The Staff were quick to learn from their early defeats, and soon became highly efficient.&quot; On Soviet technical innovation and arms, he noted: &quot;Their equipment was very good even in 1941, especially the tanks. Their artillery was excellent, and also most of the infantry weapons – their rifles (SVT-40) were more modern than ours, and had a more rapid rate of fire. Their T-34 was the finest in the world.&quot;

After operations at Kiev concluded, Kleist&#x27;s 1st Panzer Army advanced east to capture the important industrial Donbas region. On 26 September 1941, the Battle of the Sea of Azov began as the Southern Front launched an attack on the northern shores of the Sea of Azov against the German 11th Army advancing into the Crimea. On 1 October, the 1st Panzer Army swept south and encircled the two attacking Soviet 9th and 18th armies at Melitopol (Zaporizhzhia Oblast); by 11 October, both Soviet armies had been destroyed and the 1st Panzer Army had taken the Donbas. The 1st Panzer Army then attacked east along the shore of the Sea of Azov toward Rostov near the mouth of the Don river, the last barrier before the Caucasus.

On 17 November 1941, the German forces forced their way across the Mius River and launched an offensive against the Southern Front at Rostov. On 19 November 1941, the 1st Panzer Army reached Rostov and the following day, they seized bridges over the river Don. Three days after reaching Rostov, the 1st Panzer Army had captured the city. However, on 27 November, the Southern Front, as part of the Rostov Strategic Offensive Operation, counter-attacked the 1st Panzer Army&#x27;s over-extended spearhead from the north, forcing them to pull out of Rostov. By 2 December 1941, the Soviet forces had retaken Rostov and forced the 1st Panzer Army to withdraw back to the Mius River, near Taganrog. This marked the first major German withdrawal of the war. On 18 February 1942, Kleist was awarded the Oak Leaves to his Knight&#x27;s Cross.

In 1942, Kleist was given an estate worth 567,000 &quot;Reichsmarks&quot; by the Nazi regime. A Silesian estate already owned by Kleist was extended by 100-hectares; this particular extension concerned a confiscated Jewish-owned tract that was being divided up. This was a part of Hitler&#x27;s policy of buying the loyalty of his senior commanders.

====Operation Fredericus====
During the Second Battle of Kharkov on 17 May 1942 as part of Operation Fredericus, Kleist&#x27;s 1st Panzer Army attacked the Barvenkovo bridgehead from the south, advancing up to ten kilometres in the first day of the attack. On 19 May, the German 6th Army led by General Friedrich Paulus launched an offensive north of the bridgehead, encircling the Soviet 6th Army and 57th Army. After six days of encirclement, both armies were destroyed. By 28 May Kleist and Paulus&#x27; armies had captured 240,000 prisoners and destroyed or captured over 1250 Soviet tanks and 2000 artillery pieces.

====Caucasus offensive and withdrawal====
The summer of 1942 saw Army Group South subdivided into Army Group A and B. Army Group A, which included Kleist&#x27;s 1st Panzer Army, had the task of leading the Axis thrust into the Caucasus in the execution of Case Blue, the German offensive which aimed to capture the important oilfields of Grozny and Baku. The 1st Panzer Army was to spearhead the attack. Army Group A advanced deep into Southern Russia, capturing Rostov-on-Don, the oil city of Maykop, Krasnodar and the Kuban region. However, heavy Soviet resistance and the long distances from Axis sources of supply eventually reduced the Axis offensive to local advances only, and prevented Army Group A from capturing their ultimate objectives.

On 22 November 1942, Kleist replaced Field Marshal Wilhelm List as commander of Army Group A near the end of Case Blue. Hitler ordered him to hold position and to resume the offensive should the Axis forces take Stalingrad. This possibility ended after the Soviets launched counter-offensives Operation Uranus (November 1942), which encircled the German 6th Army in Stalingrad, and Operation Little Saturn (December 1942 to February 1943). Little Saturn aimed to cut off Army Group A in the Caucasus, however, the limited scope of the Soviet offensive gave Kleist enough time to withdraw his Army Group A in the direction of the Kuban, abandoning the Caucasus. Kleist later said after the war:

Kleist also said that he tried to persuade Hitler against using Romanian, Hungarian and Italian troops to cover the advancing German armies&#x27; long exposed flank. However, Hitler did not listen. Hitler told Kleist that these troops &quot;would only be used to hold the flank along the Don river from Voronezh to its southerly bend, and beyond Stalingrad to the Caspian,&quot; which, according to Hitler, were the &quot;easiest sectors to hold.&quot;

====Battle of the Dnieper and dismissal====
On 1 February 1943, Kleist was promoted to Field Marshal. In July 1943, the Red Army launched a massive offensive along the Dnieper river. By October 1943, the 17th Army, a part of Army Group A, was forced to retreat from the Kuban bridgehead across the Kerch Strait to Crimea. Erwin Jaenecke, commander of the 17th Army, declared that he refused to take the responsibility for another Stalingrad, and proposed to execute a command to evacuate, which Army Group A had issued on the 26th and Hitler had canceled. Kleist countered with an order to hold the Crimea no matter how the battle went. Kleist, who personally opposed Hitler on the question of holding the Crimea, called Jaenecke on the 28th and said to him: &quot;As a soldier I have often had to struggle with myself in similar situations. You will not save a single man. What is to come will come one way or another. This attitude only undermines the confidence of the troops...&quot;

In November 1943, the Soviets eventually cut off the land-based connection of 17th Army through the Perekop Isthmus. By December 1943, the Soviets had conquered the west bank of the Dnieper, and Kleist&#x27;s Army Group A was forced to retreat to southwest Ukraine. In December 1943, the Soviets launched the Dnieper-Carpathian Offensive against Erich von Manstein&#x27;s re-constituted Army Group South, intending to capture all of the Ukrainian and Moldavian territories under the Axis forces. As part of the initial phase of the offensive, the Soviet 3rd Ukrainian Front to the south launched the Nikopol–Krivoi Rog Offensive against Kleist&#x27;s Army Group A. Proceeding slowly at first, the front eventually destroyed the salient projecting around Kryvyi Rih and Nikopol, costing the Germans the important mining operations there as well as nearly encircling the reformed German 6th Army. On 11 March, Kleist declared that Army Group A would retreat into Bessarabia &quot;in spite of the Führer and in spite of Antonescu.&quot; By the end of March 1944, the German Dnieper line was broken and the Soviets had recovered most of right-bank Ukraine. This defeat, along with other Soviet offensive, resulted in heavy German casualties. German losses, while less than Soviet losses, were much more difficult to sustain, as there were no further reserves of men and materiel to draw on. Kleist had disagreed with Hitler over the withdrawal of Army Group A during the offensive. He had demanded permission to pull back his forces to more defensible positions, however, Hitler ordered his armies to stand where they were. Hitler blamed his generals for the overall strategic success of Soviet armies, and on 30 March 1944, Kleist was dismissed and replaced by Ferdinand Schörner.

After the 20 July plot to assassinate Hitler failed (1944), the Gestapo implicated and arrested Kleist due to the involvement of his cousin Ewald von Kleist-Schmenzin in the Oster conspiracy. Kleist avoided trial and was later released.

===Treatment of civilians===
Historian Samuel W. Mitcham writes that Kleist had tried to &quot;win over&quot; the local population of the Caucasus and Ukraine. In September 1942, Kleist remarked: &quot;these vast spaces depress me. And these vast hordes of people! We’re lost if we don’t win them over.&quot; He appointed two former military attachés to Moscow to his staff, Ernst August Köstring and Oskar von Niedermayer, who advised Kleist on the treatment of non-Russian ethnic minorities. Neidermeyer had also been a professor of geopolitics at the University of Berlin. Partly as a result of Kleist&#x27;s policies, around 800,000 Soviet citizens were recruited as collaborators in the fight against the Soviet Union. These men included minorities such as Azerbaijanis, Uzbeks, Georgians, and Cossacks, many of whom would serve in &quot;Ostlegionen&quot; and Russian Liberation Army units. Kleist employed these recruits in Cossack cavalry regiments under his command, which would lead to the creation of the 1st Cossack Cavalry Division. He also commanded the 162nd Infantry Division, which drew from &quot;Ostlegion&quot; recruits.

According to Mitcham and Boris Khavkin, a professor of history at the Russian State University for the Humanities, Kleist&#x27;s more &quot;humane&quot; policies led to clashes with Fritz Sauckel, General Plenipotentiary for Labour Deployment (head of slave labor importation for Nazi Germany), and Erich Koch, &quot;Reichskommissar&quot; of Ukraine. Mitcham writes that Kleist once ordered subordinates to make sure that &#x27;voluntary&#x27; labor recruitment programs in his area were actually voluntary, which enraged Sauckel and Koch. Kleist also once summoned SS, Gestapo and &#x27;Police&#x27; officials to his headquarters and told them that he would not allow &quot;excesses&quot; in his zone of command.

According to Khavkin, on December 6, 1942, Kleist abolished the mandatory wearing of the Star of David in the Nalchik Ghetto. When he was told to destroy the Mountain Jews, Kleist asked for a reexamination of them by the Office of Racial Policy. Under Kleist&#x27;s supervision, the Mountain Jews of Nalchik established a council which succeeded in convincing the Germans that they were not Jewish, but part of the indigenous population of the Caucasus. As a result of this, the Nazis focused on the killing of Ashkenazi Jews in Nalchik, between 600 and 1,000 of whom were murdered between November and December 1942 in his area of command. The majority of the Mountain Jews however, survived when Nalchik was liberated by Soviet troops on January 4, 1943. Between 1941 and 1944, thousands of Jews were massacred in Bessarabia, mostly by Romanian forces. Although in early 1944, Bessarabia and its capital Kishinev (Chișinău) was an area occupied by some units under his command, he claimed that he thought the Romanian forces had committed such massacres alone. 

After his capture by the Americans, Kleist admitted to psychologist Leon Goldensohn that in the winter of 1941 to 1942 he was aware of rumors that Jews were being deported in order to be assembled somewhere, he was also aware of antisemitic actions such as the Lviv pogroms. However, according to him, he did not believe rumors of atrocities committed by German forces on the Eastern Front, as he was reassured that they were just rumors or that &quot;non-Germans had done these beastly things&quot;. He claimed that in January 1943, after he heard that Jews were to be murdered in his territory, he called for SS police chief Gerret Korsemann and told him that he &quot;would not tolerate any actions against the Jews&quot;, and that Korsemann subsequently denied he had any orders to do so. He further claimed that he had only heard of the atrocities committed in Auschwitz after the war, although he was aware of the Oranienburg and Dachau concentration camps, where some of his friends and relatives were interned for political reasons.

After his forced retirement, Kleist was in contact with generals of the German resistance, although there is no direct evidence of his participation in the conspiracy against Hitler. Khavkin opines that Kleist was not a Nazi, but a servant of a criminal regime and became involved in war crimes as a result.

==Trial and death== 
Kleist was arrested in late April 1945 in Mitterfels by the American 26th Infantry Division, and handed over to the British Army. Kleist testified in the Nuremberg trials. In September 1946, he was extradited to Yugoslavia, where he was tried and sentenced to 15 years in prison for war crimes. He also testified in Yugoslavia that Operation Retribution, the 1941 bombing of Belgrade, &quot;had a primarily political-terrorist character and had nothing to do with the war. That air bombing was a matter of Hitler’s vanity, and his personal revenge.&quot; Kleist was the highest ranking &quot;Wehrmacht&quot; commander to stand trial in Yugoslavia; the second-highest ranking commander was &quot;Generaloberst&quot; Alexander Löhr, who commanded German forces in Southeastern Europe and Operation Retribution. In 1947, Löhr was sentenced to death and executed for war crimes along with several other more junior &quot;Wehrmacht&quot; officers in Belgrade. The historian Khavkin opines that Kleist&#x27;s trial and the evidence brought against him were partly political and that, although the Germans committed terrible war crimes in Yugoslavia, his personal guilt could not be proven.

In 1949, he was extradited to the Soviet Union, where he was charged with war crimes. Kleist was one of the three German field marshals captured by Soviet forces, the other two being Ferdinand Schörner and Friedrich Paulus. The Soviet prosecutors presented evidence that Kleist carried out and issued criminal orders. The verdict stated that in the Krasnodar territory alone, German forces, including units under the command of Kleist, killed more than 61,000 Soviet citizens, destroyed more than 63,000 industrial and economic buildings, looted from collective farms, stole hundreds of thousands of livestock, burned dozens of villages and destroyed many schools, hospitals and children&#x27;s institutions. Kleist was sentenced to 25 years in a correctional labour camp.

In 1952, the Military Collegium of the Supreme Court recognized Kleist as a particularly dangerous criminal and demanded strict isolation of him from society. Kleist&#x27;s verdict was changed from a correctional labour camp term, to a prison term, and he was then sent to Vladimir Central Prison.

On 13 November 1954, Kleist died of heart failure in Vladimir Central Prison. He was the most senior-ranking soldier among the German prisoners of war in the Soviet Union to die in Russian captivity. Kleist was buried at the Prince Vladimir cemetery near the prison walls.

In October 1955, after German Chancellor Konrad Adenauer&#x27;s visit to Moscow, the Soviet Union repatriated the remaining 14,000 German prisoners of war convicted of war crimes. Kleist&#x27;s body was exhumed, dressed in a field marshal&#x27;s uniform and sent home to Germany. Kleist had two sons, Johannes Jürgen Christoph Ewald and Hugo Edmund Christoph Heinrich.

<text>The curse of dimensionality refers to various phenomena that arise when analyzing and organizing data in high-dimensional spaces that do not occur in low-dimensional settings such as the three-dimensional physical space of everyday experience. The expression was coined by Richard E. Bellman when considering problems in dynamic programming. The curse generally refers to issues that arise when the number of datapoints is small (in a suitably defined sense) relative to the intrinsic dimension of the data.

Dimensionally cursed phenomena occur in domains such as numerical analysis, sampling, combinatorics, machine learning, data mining and databases. The common theme of these problems is that when the dimensionality increases, the volume of the space increases so fast that the available data become sparse. In order to obtain a reliable result, the amount of data needed often grows exponentially with the dimensionality. Also, organizing and searching data often relies on detecting areas where objects form groups with similar properties; in high dimensional data, however, all objects appear to be sparse and dissimilar in many ways, which prevents common data organization strategies from being efficient.

== Domains ==

=== Combinatorics ===
In some problems, each variable can take one of several discrete values, or the range of possible values is divided to give a finite number of possibilities. Taking the variables together, a huge number of combinations of values must be considered. This effect is also known as the combinatorial explosion. Even in the simplest case of formula_1 binary variables, the number of possible combinations already is exponential in the dimensionality. Naively, each additional dimension doubles the effort needed to try all combinations.

=== Sampling ===
There is an exponential increase in volume associated with adding extra dimensions to a mathematical space. For example, 102 = 100 evenly spaced sample points suffice to sample a unit interval (try to visualize a &quot;1-dimensional&quot; cube) with no more than 10−2 = 0.01 distance between points; an equivalent sampling of a 10-dimensional unit hypercube with a lattice that has a spacing of 10−2 = 0.01 between adjacent points would require 1020 = [(102)10] sample points. In general, with a spacing distance of 10−&quot;n&quot; the 10-dimensional hypercube appears to be a factor of 10&quot;n&quot;(10−1) = [(10&quot;n&quot;)10/(10&quot;n&quot;)] &quot;larger&quot; than the 1-dimensional hypercube, which is the unit interval. In the above example &quot;n&quot; = 2: when using a sampling distance of 0.01 the 10-dimensional hypercube appears to be 1018 &quot;larger&quot; than the unit interval. This effect is a combination of the combinatorics problems above and the distance function problems explained below.

=== Optimization ===
When solving dynamic optimization problems by numerical backward induction, the objective function must be computed for each combination of values. This is a significant obstacle when the dimension of the &quot;state variable&quot; is large.

=== Machine learning ===
In machine learning problems that involve learning a &quot;state-of-nature&quot; from a finite number of data samples in a high-dimensional feature space with each feature having a range of possible values, typically an enormous amount of training data is required to ensure that there are several samples with each combination of values. In an abstract sense, as the number of features or dimensions grows, the amount of data we need to generalize accurately grows exponentially. 

A typical rule of thumb is that there should be at least 5 training examples for each dimension in the representation. In machine learning and insofar as predictive performance is concerned, the &quot;curse of dimensionality&quot; is used interchangeably with the &quot;peaking phenomenon&quot;, which is also known as &quot;Hughes phenomenon&quot;. This phenomenon states that with a fixed number of training samples, the average (expected) predictive power of a classifier or regressor first increases as the number of dimensions or features used is increased but beyond a certain dimensionality it starts deteriorating instead of improving steadily. 

Nevertheless, in the context of a &quot;simple&quot; classifier (e.g., linear discriminant analysis in the multivariate Gaussian model under the assumption of a common known covariance matrix), Zollanvari, &quot;et al.&quot;, showed both analytically and empirically that as long as the relative cumulative efficacy of an additional feature set (with respect to features that are already part of the classifier) is greater (or less) than the size of this additional feature set, the expected error of the classifier constructed using these additional features will be less (or greater) than the expected error of the classifier constructed without them. In other words, both the size of additional features and their (relative) cumulative discriminatory effect are important in observing a decrease or increase in the average predictive power.

In metric learning, higher dimensions can sometimes allow a model to achieve better performance. After normalizing embeddings to the surface of a hypersphere, FaceNet achieves the best performance using 128 dimensions as opposed to 64, 256, or 512 dimensions in one ablation study. A loss function for unitary-invariant dissimilarity between word embeddings was found to be minimized in high dimensions.

=== Data mining ===
In data mining, the curse of dimensionality refers to a data set with too many features. 

Consider the first table, which depicts 200 individuals and 2000 genes (features) with a 1 or 0 denoting whether or not they have a genetic mutation in that gene. A data mining application to this data set may be finding the correlation between specific genetic mutations and creating a classification algorithm such as a decision tree to determine whether an individual has cancer or not. 
A common practice of data mining in this domain would be to create association rules between genetic mutations that lead to the development of cancers. To do this, one would have to loop through each genetic mutation of each individual and find other genetic mutations that occur over a desired threshold and create pairs. They would start with pairs of two, then three, then four until they result in an empty set of pairs. The complexity of this algorithm can lead to calculating all permutations of gene pairs for each individual or row. Given the formula for calculating the permutations of n items with a group size of r is: formula_2, calculating the number of three pair permutations of any given individual would be 7988004000 different pairs of genes to evaluate for each individual. The number of pairs created will grow by an order of factorial as the size of the pairs increase. The growth is depicted in the permutation table (see right). 

As we can see from the permutation table above, one of the major problems data miners face regarding the curse of dimensionality is that the space of possible parameter values grows exponentially or factorially as the number of features in the data set grows. This problem critically affects both computational time and space when searching for associations or optimal features to consider. 

Another problem data miners may face when dealing with too many features is that the number of false predictions or classifications tends to increase as the number of features grows in the data set. In terms of the classification problem discussed above, keeping every data point could lead to a higher number of false positives and false negatives in the model. 

This may seem counterintuitive, but consider the genetic mutation table from above, depicting all genetic mutations for each individual. Each genetic mutation, whether they correlate with cancer or not, will have some input or weight in the model that guides the decision-making process of the algorithm. There may be mutations that are outliers or ones that dominate the overall distribution of genetic mutations when in fact they do not correlate with cancer. These features may be working against one&#x27;s model, making it more difficult to obtain optimal results. 

This problem is up to the data miner to solve, and there is no universal solution. The first step any data miner should take is to explore the data, in an attempt to gain an understanding of how it can be used to solve the problem. One must first understand what the data means, and what they are trying to discover before they can decide if anything must be removed from the data set. Then they can create or use a feature selection or dimensionality reduction algorithm to remove samples or features from the data set if they deem it necessary. One example of such methods is the interquartile range method, used to remove outliers in a data set by calculating the standard deviation of a feature or occurrence.

=== Distance function ===
When a measure such as a Euclidean distance is defined using many coordinates, there is little difference in the distances between different pairs of points.

One way to illustrate the &quot;vastness&quot; of high-dimensional Euclidean space is to compare the proportion of an inscribed hypersphere with radius formula_3 and dimension formula_1, to that of a hypercube with edges of length formula_5
The volume of such a sphere is formula_6, where formula_7 is the gamma function, while the volume of the cube is formula_8.
As the dimension formula_1 of the space increases, the hypersphere becomes an insignificant volume relative to that of the hypercube. This can clearly be seen by comparing the proportions as the dimension formula_1 goes to infinity:
:formula_11 as formula_12. 

Furthermore, the distance between the center and the corners is formula_13, which increases without bound for fixed r.

In this sense when points are uniformly generated in a high-dimensional hypercube, almost all points are much farther than formula_3 units away from the centre. In high dimensions, the volume of the &quot;d&quot;-dimensional unit hypercube (with coordinates of the vertices formula_15) is concentrated near a sphere with the radius formula_16 for large dimension &quot;d&quot;. Indeed, for each coordinate formula_17 the average value of formula_18 in the cube is 
:formula_19.

The variance of formula_18 for uniform distribution in the cube is
:formula_21

Therefore, the squared distance from the origin, formula_22 has the average value &quot;d&quot;/3 and variance 4&quot;d&quot;/45. For large &quot;d&quot;, distribution of formula_23 is close to the normal distribution with the mean 1/3 and the standard deviation formula_24 according to the central limit theorem. Thus, when uniformly generating points in high dimensions, both the &quot;middle&quot; of the hypercube, and the corners are empty, and all the volume is concentrated near the surface of a sphere of &quot;intermediate&quot; radius formula_25. 

This also helps to understand the chi-squared distribution. Indeed, the (non-central) chi-squared distribution associated to a random point in the interval [-1, 1] is the same as the distribution of the length-squared of a random point in the &quot;d&quot;-cube. By the law of large numbers, this distribution concentrates itself in a narrow band around &quot;d&quot; times the standard deviation squared (σ2) of the original derivation. This illuminates the chi-squared distribution and also illustrates that most of the volume of the &quot;d&quot;-cube concentrates near the boundary of a sphere of radius formula_26.

A further development of this phenomenon is as follows. Any fixed distribution on the real numbers induces a product distribution on points in formula_27. For any fixed &quot;n&quot;, it turns out that the difference between the minimum and the maximum distance between a random reference point &quot;Q&quot; and a list of &quot;n&quot; random data points &quot;P&quot;1...,&quot;P&quot;&quot;n&quot; become indiscernible compared to the minimum distance:
:formula_28.
This is often cited as distance functions losing their usefulness (for the nearest-neighbor criterion in feature-comparison algorithms, for example) in high dimensions. However, recent research has shown this to only hold in the artificial scenario when the one-dimensional distributions formula_29 are independent and identically distributed. When attributes are correlated, data can become easier and provide higher distance contrast and the signal-to-noise ratio was found to play an important role, thus feature selection should be used.

More recently, it has been suggested that there may be a conceptual flaw in the argument that contrast-loss creates a curse in high dimensions. Machine learning can be understood as the problem of assigning instances to their respective generative process of origin, with class labels acting as symbolic representations of individual generative processes. The curse&#x27;s derivation assumes all instances are independent, identical outcomes of a single high dimensional generative process. If there is only one generative process, there would exist only one (naturally occurring) class and machine learning would be conceptually ill-defined in both high and low dimensions. Thus, the traditional argument that contrast-loss creates a curse, may be fundamentally inappropriate. In addition, it has been shown that when the generative model is modified to accommodate multiple generative processes, contrast-loss can morph from a curse to a blessing, as it ensures that the nearest-neighbor of an instance is almost-surely its most closely related instance. From this perspective, contrast-loss makes high dimensional distances especially meaningful and not especially non-meaningful as is often argued.

=== Nearest neighbor search ===
The effect complicates nearest neighbor search in high dimensional space. It is not possible to quickly reject candidates by using the difference in one coordinate as a lower bound for a distance based on all the dimensions.

However, it has recently been observed that the mere number of dimensions does not necessarily result in difficulties, since &quot;relevant&quot; additional dimensions can also increase the contrast. In addition, for the resulting ranking it remains useful to discern close and far neighbors. Irrelevant (&quot;noise&quot;) dimensions, however, reduce the contrast in the manner described above. In time series analysis, where the data are inherently high-dimensional, distance functions also work reliably as long as the signal-to-noise ratio is high enough.

====&quot;k&quot;-nearest neighbor classification====
Another effect of high dimensionality on distance functions concerns &quot;k&quot;-nearest neighbor (&quot;k&quot;-NN) graphs constructed from a data set using a distance function. As the dimension increases, the indegree distribution of the &quot;k&quot;-NN digraph becomes skewed with a peak on the right because of the emergence of a disproportionate number of hubs, that is, data-points that appear in many more &quot;k&quot;-NN lists of other data-points than the average. This phenomenon can have a considerable impact on various techniques for classification (including the &quot;k&quot;-NN classifier), semi-supervised learning, and clustering, and it also affects information retrieval.

=== Anomaly detection ===
In a 2012 survey, Zimek et al. identified the following problems when searching for anomalies in high-dimensional data:

# Concentration of scores and distances: derived values such as distances become numerically similar
# Irrelevant attributes: in high dimensional data, a significant number of attributes may be irrelevant
# Definition of reference sets: for local methods, reference sets are often nearest-neighbor based
# Incomparable scores for different dimensionalities: different subspaces produce incomparable scores
# Interpretability of scores: the scores often no longer convey a semantic meaning
# Exponential search space: the search space can no longer be systematically scanned
# Data snooping bias: given the large search space, for every desired significance a hypothesis can be found
# Hubness: certain objects occur more frequently in neighbor lists than others.

Many of the analyzed specialized methods tackle one or another of these problems, but there remain many open research questions.

=== Blessing of dimensionality ===
Surprisingly and despite the expected &quot;curse of dimensionality&quot; difficulties, common-sense heuristics based on the most straightforward methods &quot;can yield results which are almost surely optimal&quot; for high-dimensional problems. The term &quot;blessing of dimensionality&quot; was introduced in the late 1990s. Donoho in his &quot;Millennium manifesto&quot; clearly explained why the &quot;blessing of dimensionality&quot; will form a basis of future data mining. The effects of the blessing of dimensionality were discovered in many applications and found their foundation in the concentration of measure phenomena. One example of the blessing of dimensionality phenomenon is linear separability of a random point from a large finite random set with high probability even if this set is exponentially large: the number of elements in this random set can grow exponentially with dimension. Moreover, this linear functional can be selected in the form of the simplest linear Fisher discriminant. This separability theorem was proven for a wide class of probability distributions: general uniformly log-concave distributions, product distributions in a cube and many other families (reviewed recently in ). 

&quot;The blessing of dimensionality and the curse of dimensionality are two sides of the same coin.&quot; For example, the typical property of essentially high-dimensional probability distributions in a high-dimensional space is: the squared distance of random points to a selected point is, with high probability, close to the average (or median) squared distance. This property significantly simplifies the expected geometry of data and indexing of high-dimensional data (blessing), but, at the same time, it makes the similarity search in high dimensions difficult and even useless (curse).

Zimek et al. noted that while the typical formalizations of the curse of dimensionality affect i.i.d. data, having data that is separated in each attribute becomes easier even in high dimensions, and argued that the signal-to-noise ratio matters: data becomes easier with each attribute that adds signal, and harder with attributes that only add noise (irrelevant error) to the data. In particular for unsupervised data analysis this effect is known as swamping.

<text>Gush Katif () was a bloc of 17 Israeli settlements in the southern Gaza Strip. In August 2005, the Israel Defense Forces removed the 8,600 Israeli residents from their homes after a decision from the Cabinet of Israel. The communities were demolished as part of Israel&#x27;s unilateral disengagement from Gaza.

== Geography ==

Gush Katif was on the southwestern edge of the Gaza Strip, bordered on the southwest by Rafah and the Egyptian border, on the east by Khan Yunis, on the northeast by Deir el-Balah, and on the west and northwest by the Mediterranean Sea. A narrow, one kilometer strip of land populated by Bedouins known as al-Mawasi lay along the Mediterranean coast. Most of Gush Katif was on sand dunes that separate the coastal plain from the sea along much of the southeastern Mediterranean.

Two roads served Gush Katif: Road 230, which runs from the southwest along the sea from the Egyptian border at Rafiah Yam through Kfar Yam to Tel Katifa on the bloc&#x27;s northern border, where it entered Palestinian-controlled territory, and Road 240, which also runs parallel to the sea approximately one kilometre inland, and upon which most of the settlements and traffic were located. Road 240&#x27;s southern end turned south to reach Morag and continued to Sufah and the Shalom bloc of villages south of the Gaza Strip, while its northern end turned east to the Kissufim Crossing, and served as the main route into Gush Katif. These roads were forbidden to Palestinian Arab drivers.

While Kfar Darom and Netzarim were originally accessed along the main road to Gaza City (known as &quot;Tencher Road&quot;), Israeli and Palestinian traffic was separated after the failure of the Oslo Accords and the Second Intifada. Netzarim was isolated as an enclave accessed only through the Karni crossing and the Sa&#x27;ad junction and in the latter years, only by IDF armored vehicles. In 2002, a bridge was built for Road 240 over the Tencher road to physically separate the two arteries and allow unobstructed travel for both Palestinian and Israeli traffic.

== Demographics ==
About 8,600 residents lived in Gush Katif, many of them Orthodox Religious Zionist Jews, though many non-observant and secular Jews also lived there. The three northernmost communities, Nisanit, Dugit and Rafiah Yam, were secular. The area also included several hundred Muslim families, mostly al-Mawasi Bedouins, who while technically Palestinian residents had freedom of movement within Israeli areas due to peaceful relations. Contrary reports have noted the severity of the restriction of movement for Palestinian residents.

== History ==
Jews and their Israelite ancestors lived in Gaza since Biblical times. Residents included medieval rabbis Rabbi Yisrael Najara, author of &quot;Kah Ribon Olam&quot;, the popular Shabbat song, and Mekubal Rabbi Avraham Azoulai. Land for the village of Kfar Darom was bought in the 1930s and settled in 1946; it was evacuated following an Egyptian siege in the 1948 Arab-Israeli War.

Gush Katif began in 1968, when Yigal Allon proposed founding two Nahal settlements in the center of the Gaza Strip. He viewed the breaking of the continuity between the northern and southern Arab settlements as vital to Israel&#x27;s security in the area, which had been captured the previous year in the Six-Day War. In 1970, Kfar Darom was reestablished as the first of many Israeli agricultural villages in the area. Allon&#x27;s idea was designed with five key areas (or &#x27;fingers,&#x27; being called by some the &quot;five-finger print&quot;) slated for Israeli settlements along the Gaza Strip. After the Egypt–Israel peace treaty and the dismantling of the fifth &#x27;finger&#x27; (Yamit bloc) south of Rafah, the fourth (Morag) and third (Kfar Darom) strips were united into one bloc that would become known as Gush Katif. The second finger, Netzarim, was connected to Gush Katif until after the Oslo Accords, while the bloc on the dunes north of Gaza, which straddled the Green Line, was more a part of the Ashkelon area communities.

Throughout the 1980s new communities were established, especially with the influx of former residents of the Sinai. Most of the bloc&#x27;s communities were established as agricultural cooperatives called moshavs, where the residents from each town would work in clusters of greenhouses just outside the residential areas.

== Economy ==

In the bloc&#x27;s greenhouses, technology was used to grow pest-free leafy vegetables and herbs aiming to meet health, aesthetic and religious requirements. Most of the organic agricultural products were exported to Europe. In addition, the community of Atzmona had Israel&#x27;s largest plant nursery, and with 800 cows, the Katif dairy was the second largest in the country. Telesales and printing were other significant industries.

Exports from the greenhouses, owned by 200 farmers, came to $200 million per year and made up 15% of Israeli agricultural exports. The assets in Gush Katif were estimated at $23 billion.

Of Israel&#x27;s exports, Gush Katif exported: 
*95% of pest-free lettuce and greens
*70% of organic vegetables
*60% of cherry tomatoes
*60% of geraniums to Europe.

The Economic Cooperation Foundation, funded by the European Union, bought the greenhouses for $14 million and transferred ownership to the Palestinian Authority, so 4,000 Palestinian workers could keep their jobs. The money was paid for the greenhouse guts, such as the computerized irrigation systems, as the law in Israel only allowed for the government to pay for the land and structures, as these are not moveable. Israel compensated the evacuees $55 million for the greenhouses and the land. Former head of the World Bank, James Wolfensohn, gave $500,000 of his own money to the project. The rest was contributed by Israeli philanthropists, including Mortimer Zuckerman, Lester Crown, and Leonard Stern. They bought the irrigation systems and other moveables, because, according to Zuckerman, &quot;Without those, the Palestinians would not be able to make a go of running the greenhouses.&quot;

When the Israelis left Gaza, half of the greenhouses were dismantled by their owners before leaving because they doubted they would receive compensation. Afterwards Palestinians looted the area, and 800 of 4,000 greenhouses were left unusable, while, according to Wolfensohn, most were left intact. Subsequently, the harvest, intended for export via Israel for Europe, was lost due to the Israeli restrictions on the Karni crossing which &quot;was closed more than not&quot;, leading to losses in excess of $120,000 per day. Economic consultants estimated that the closures cost the agricultural sector in Gaza $450,000 a day. Israel closed the crossing citing security concerns.

==Palestinian attacks==

Although the Gush Katif settlements and the roads leading to it were guarded by the Israeli Army&#x27;s Gaza Division, settlers were still vulnerable to attacks.

During the First Intifada (1987–1990) in nearby Gaza City, the residents of Gush Katif were subject to frequent stoning of traffic, among other incidents.

During the Second Intifada (2000-2005), Gush Katif was the target of thousands of attacks by Palestinian militants, with over 6000 mortars and Qassam rockets launched into the settlements. Though these attacks resulted in few deaths, they caused damage to property and psychological distress. Most ground attacks were by Palestinian gunmen using infiltration tactics, including attempts by sea. Victims include an 18-year-old killed by a Palestinian sniper in November 2000, and five teenagers who were fatally shot in March 2002 when terrorists infiltrated the Otzem pre-military academy in Atzmona.

Attacks on Israeli vehicles on the Kissufim road were common. Many of the ground attacks on Gush Katif were thwarted by the Israeli military, but fatal attacks included:
* A school bus bombed on 20 November 2000, leaving a man and a woman in their mid-30s dead and several maimed children.
* In January 2002, a 36-year-old man killed in a suicide bombing.
* In February 2002, a 30-year-old woman killed when a Palestinian millitant opened fire on her car, along with two soldiers who came to her assistance.
* In May 2004, Palestinian millitants ambushed and killed Tali Hatuel, who was eight months pregnant, and her four young daughters.

==Evacuation==
On August 13, 2005, the Gush Katif region was closed to non-residents for the evacuation plan. Though effectively violating the Disengagement law, which most residents viewed as immoral and illegitimate, most settlers did not voluntarily leave their homes or pack in preparation for eviction. On August 15, 2005, the forcible evacuation began. On August 22, 2005, the residents of the last settlement, Netzarim, were evicted. Many residents returned to pack the contents of their homes and the Israeli government began the destruction of all residential buildings. On September 12, 2005, the Israeli Army withdrew from each settlement up to the Green Line. All public buildings (schools, libraries, community centres, office buildings) as well as industrial buildings, factories, and greenhouses which could not be taken apart were left intact.

==Post-withdrawal==
In Jerusalem, the &quot;Gush Katif Museum&quot; was founded to preserve the memory of the place.

At the time of the Gush Katif withdrawal, Israeli authorities destroyed all the Israeli residents&#x27; homes. Palestinians dismantled most of what remained, scavenging for cement, rebar, and other construction materials.

There had been a public debate about the many public structures and synagogues in Gush Katif: &quot;Many asserted that the buildings must be destroyed in order to ensure that they would not be used by terrorist organizations in the future. The fate of many of the area’s synagogues was also discussed at that time&quot;.

Originally, the Israeli cabinet had planned to destroy synagogues in the settlement, but the government responded to pressure from religious Jewish organizations and reversed its decision. &quot;Limor Livnat suggested involving UNESCO, with the hopes they would declare Gush Katif synagogues as official World Heritage Sites&quot;. The synagogues were left intact, as the IDF did not wish to destroy holy sites and hoped that the Palestinians would respect these buildings.

Most of the synagogues were destroyed by Palestinians immediately after the evacuation. Palestinians set fire to the buildings. In 2007, it was reported that the synagogue sites were used for military training and rocket launches against Israel.

In July 2014, in Operation Protective Edge Israel sought to protect its residents from the barrage of rockets fired from Gaza and destroyed a network of tunnels aimed at Israel&#x27;s southern communities and targeted Hamas bases, some of which were located where Gush Katif once stood. Some Israeli politicians in the Knesset apologised for not realizing this would happen and not doing enough to prevent it.

Following the 2023 Hamas attack on Israel on 7 October, there has been a renewed campaign to return Israeli settlers to Gush Katif, including Hanan Ben Ari singing “We return to Gush Katif” to Israeli troops.

== Former settlements in Gush Katif ==
# Bedolah בדולח (lit. Crystal)
# Bnei Atzmon בני עצמון (name according to a biblical border point of Israel and similar to a former community in Sinai)
# Gadid גדיד (lit. picking of palm tree fruits)
# Gan Or גן אור (lit. Garden of light)
# Ganei Tal גני טל (lit. Gardens of dew)
# Kfar Darom כפר דרום (lit. South village)
# Kfar Yam כפר ים (lit. Village of the sea)
# Kerem Atzmona כרם עצמונה (Atzmon&#x27;s vineyard)
# Morag מורג (lit. Harvest scythe)
# Neve Dekalim נוה דקלים (lit. Palm tree Oasis)
# Netzer Hazani נצר חזני (named after Cabinet Minister Michael Hazani)
# Pe&#x27;at Sade פאת שדה (lit. the edge of the field)
# Katif קטיף (lit. harvest, picking of flowers)
# Rafiah Yam רפיח ים
# Shirat Hayam שירת הים (lit. Song of the sea)
# Slav שליו (lit. Quail, named after the bird of the biblical Exodus)
# Tel Katifa תל קטיפא

Most of the Gush Katif settlements were concentrated in one bloc on the southwest edge of the Gaza Strip and were individually surrounded by fencing.

== Former settlements north of Gush Katif ==
Three Israeli settlements on the northern edge of the Gush Katif and another near its center were more detached:
# Dugit דוגית (small boat)
# Elei Sinai אלי סיני (named after Sinai)
# Nisanit ניסנית (a flower that blossoms in the sands)
# Netzarim נצרים (lit. scions)

The three former used Ashkelon services, while Netzarim was mostly self-sufficient.

== 2023 developments ==

In the context of the Israel–Hamas war of 2023–24, some Israelis have gathered in Yad Mordechai near the Gaza Israel border, in hopes of rebuilding Gush Katif. In February of 2024, a group of Israeli settlers, some former residents of Gush Katif, gathered at the Beit Hanoun/Erez Crossing with construction materials and weapons with the same goal. This effort has been conducted, at least in part, by Nachala Settlement Movement, which has successfully led efforts to in the past to build illegal settlements in the West Bank. Supporters of the effort include Knesset member Ohad Tal, of the party Religious Zionism.

<text>The Queens Domain, also known as The Domain to locals, is an expansive area of bushland, parkland, and cultural sites located just north-east of the Hobart City Centre, bordering the River Derwent in the state capital of Hobart, Tasmania, Australia. Established in 1860 by gubernatorial decree, the Domain is public land preserved for community use and recreation.

==History==
Twenty-one Aboriginal sites within the Queens Domain are recorded in the Tasmanian Aboriginal Sites Index (TASI). Most sites are located along the Derwent River foreshore, with some extending inland. The foreshore and remnant grasslands are considered culturally significant to the Tasmanian Aboriginal community. A designated high-sensitivity zone extends from the foreshore to the 50-metre contour. All sites are protected under the &quot;Aboriginal Relics Act 1975&quot;. Management guidelines ensure the preservation of Aboriginal heritage values in consultation with the Tasmanian Aboriginal Land Council (TALC).

European occupation of the Domain began in 1804 after the colonists abandoned their first camp at Risdon Cove and settled at the site of the current Hobart City Centre. Initially set aside for the pleasure and profit of the Governor of the colony, the Queens Domain gradually evolved into a developed public space with a rich and layered history. Throughout the 19th and early 20th centuries, the Domain was used for a variety of purposes, including housing abattoirs, quarrying building materials, agisting animals, growing food, boat building, storing munitions, and accommodating the Governor of Tasmania.

Over time, the Domain became increasingly isolated from the river and adjacent city and residential areas. The construction of a rail line in 1875 severed the connection to the Derwent River, and further disconnection occurred in 1943 with the creation of a link road between the floating bridge and the city, which later expanded into an extension of the Tasman Highway. The construction of the Brooker Highway in 1961 along the length of Park Street reinforced this separation.

Despite extensive development, the Domain retains nationally significant remnants of its original grassy woodland landscape. Amongst the seven native plant communities mapped within the area, two are considered particularly rare. Lowland Themeda triandra grasslands are listed as ‘Critically Endangered’ under the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 (EPBC Act), and Eucalyptus globulus forest and woodlands are listed as ‘Threatened’ under the Nature Conservation Act 2002. These communities support over 130 native plant species, with several classified as endangered or vulnerable under conservation legislation.

The Domain’s role as a public recreational space expanded over time with the establishment of carriage drives, botanical gardens, a zoo, baths, sporting facilities, ceremonial spaces, and event venues. after the colonists abandoned their first camp at Risdon Cove and settled in Hobart. Initially reserved for the pleasure and profit of the Governor, the Domain has undergone significant transformation over time. It has served various utilitarian purposes, including housing abattoirs, quarries, food production, and military storage. It also accommodated residential areas and the Governor’s residence. Over time, the Domain evolved into a public space, hosting carriage drives, botanical gardens, a zoo, baths, sporting facilities, and ceremonial spaces. However, infrastructure developments have progressively isolated the Domain from the city and river, including the 1875 railway, the 1943 floating bridge link road (now the Tasman Highway), and the 1961 Brooker Highway.

==Historic and cultural facilities==

The Domain is home to several significant institutions and recreational facilities:
* Government House – One of the most stately residences in the Commonwealth of Nations, serving as the official residence of the Governor of Tasmania.
* Royal Tasmanian Botanical Gardens – The second-oldest botanical gardens in Australia, featuring diverse plant collections, including a conservatory, heritage plantings, and Tasmania’s only subantarctic plant house.
* Hobart Cenotaph – A war memorial dedicated to Tasmanians who served in global conflicts, prominently situated overlooking the river.
* Hobart Zoo (former) – The original site of Hobart’s zoological gardens, which operated from 1923 until its closure in 1937. The site where the last captive thylacine perished in 1936. The site is currently closed to the general public.
* Queen Victoria Gunpowder Magazine – Erected in 1845 with convict labor, the historic gunpowder storeroom is currently closed to the general public.

==Sports and recreation==

The Domain contains several major sporting complexes:
* Domain Athletic Centre – A modern facility catering to athletics and track-and-field events.
* Doone Kennedy Hobart Aquatic Centre – A state-of-the-art swimming and fitness facility used for competition and community use.
* Hobart International Tennis Centre – A premier tennis venue, home to the Hobart International tournament.
* Soldiers Memorial Oval sporting field area – twin oval sports ground encompassing the Domain Crossroads Oval and the Soldiers Memorial Oval.
* TCA Ground – A historic cricket and Australian rules football ground.

Additionally, the Domain features numerous walking and cycling tracks, picnic areas, barbecue facilities, public toilets, and open spaces for community events and gatherings, such as the Legacy Park Community Hub, a large adventure play space suitable for children of all ages, and an outdoor amphitheatre.

==Geography and environment==

The highest point of the Domain reaches approximately , with a prominent radio mast nearby. The landscape comprises native bushland, open parklands, and historic sites.

Despite significant development, the Domain retains nationally significant remnants of its original grassy woodland landscape. Two of its seven native plant communities are classified as rare:
* &quot;Lowland Themeda&quot; triandra grasslands – Listed as ‘Critically Endangered’ under the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 (EPBC Act).
* &quot;Eucalyptus globulus&quot; forest and woodlands – Listed as ‘Threatened’ under the Nature Conservation Act 2002.

These ecosystems support over 130 native plant species, including three listed as endangered or vulnerable under the EPBC Act and 16 classified as rare or threatened under the Threatened Species Protection Act 1995. The Domain’s landscape, with its distinctive grassy hues and silver-grey trees, contributes to Hobart’s natural character.

==Exotic gardens and significant plantings==

In contrast to its native landscapes, parts of the Domain feature historic exotic gardens planted in the Victorian era to create a ‘park-like’ setting. Significant gardens exist around the Royal Tasmanian Botanical Gardens, Government House, the University grounds, and the Phillip Smith Centre. Extensive tree plantings along key roads and driveways, such as Davies Avenue and Soldiers Memorial Avenue, further define the Domain’s character. Over 50 trees in the Domain are listed on the City of Hobart’s Significant Tree Register. Notably, the Royal Tasmanian Botanical Gardens hosts 230 conifer species, representing one of the world’s most diverse collections.

<text>Mohamed Bolkiah ibni Omar Ali Saifuddien III (born 27 August 1947) is a member of the royal family of Brunei. He is the second son of Omar Ali Saifuddien III, the 28th Sultan of Brunei, and Raja Isteri (Queen) Pengiran Anak Damit. After Brunei&#x27;s independence in 1984, he became the country’s first foreign minister, serving from 1 January 1984 until 22 October 2015, alongside the second Minister of Foreign Affairs and Trade, Lim Jock Seng.

==Early life and education==
Pengiran Muda (Prince) Mohamed Bolkiah was born on 27 August 1947 at Istana Darussalam, Brunei Town (now called Bandar Seri Begawan). He is the second son of Sultan Omar Ali Saifuddien III, the 28th Sultan of Brunei, and his wife, Raja Isteri Pengiran Anak Damit. Among his siblings are the current SultanHassanal Bolkiah, Prince Sufri Bolkiah, Prince Jefri Bolkiah, Princess Masna Bolkiah, Princess Nor&#x27;ain, Princess Amal Umi Kalthum Al-Islam, Princess Amal Rakiah, Princess Amal Nasibah and Princess Amal Jefriah.

In an interview, Abdul Ghani bin Jamil disclosed that Sultan Hassanal Bolkiah, Prince Mohamed Bolkiah, Princess Masna Bolkiah, Princess Nor&#x27;ain, Pengiran Anak Saleha, Pengiran Muda Abdul Rahman, Pengiran Anak Yusof, Pengiran Anak Puteh, Pengiran Anak Ja&#x27;afar, and Pengiran Muda Apong were students at the Istana Darul Hana Surau. 

Afterwards in 1960, he attended his secondary education with his brother Hassanal Bolkiah at Victoria Institution in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia until 1963. From 1964 until 1965, he studied his GCE &#x27;A&#x27; Levels at Omar Ali Saifuddien College, Brunei. From there, he would then be enrolled into Sandhurst Military Academy, United Kingdom. He was commissioned as a junior lieutenant in the Irish Guards, in 1967.

== Perdana Wazir ==
Since 1906, Mohamed Bolkiah was appointed by his father, Sultan Omar Ali Saifuddien III, as , on 29 September 1967. He became a wazir upon receiving the title, surpassing both the Pengiran Anak Mohamed Alam and Pengiran Muda Hashim in importance. In keeping with protocol, the ceremony to install the new wazir took place at the Istana Darul Hana Throne Room. He was chosen to serve on the Privy Council the same year.

Upon Sultan Hassanal Bolkiah&#x27;s coronation, all traditional ministerial positions were filled. In February 1970, he was bestowed with the new title of , head of the traditional Brunei wazirs, meaning &quot;eyes and ears&quot; of the ruler, by his brother. On 23 September 1974, he was appointed as the honorary police commissioner of the Royal Brunei Police Force (RBPF).

== Ministerial career ==
Immediately following the independence of Brunei on 1 January 1984, Mohamed Bolkiah was appointed Minister of Foreign Affairs and Trade. In an effort to fortify its global Islamic identity, Brunei joined the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) in January 1984 in addition to ASEAN and the UN. As soon as Brunei gained independence, it also joined the Commonwealth, whose goal is to advance world peace and order, something that the Bruneian administration actively pursued. Only until that same year, he was the President of the National Bank of Brunei (NBB). 

Speaking at the ASEAN ministerial summit in Singapore in June 1982, Mohamed Bolkiah said that Brunei, a tiny nation, &quot;gives considerable emphasis to the concept of non-interference.&quot; Any attempt by one member state to meddle in another&#x27;s domestic affairs would be detrimental to the cohesiveness and sustainability of the ASEAN. He addd that ASEAN always reached decisions by agreement, which is just how Brunei would like to operate. It was in line with the nation&#x27;s customs. Brunei was undoubtedly at ease and felt like they belonged in their new local surroundings.

During the early 1960s until Brunei&#x27;s independence and ASEAN membership in 1984, Bruneian passports were not accepted for travel to Indonesia or other communist nations. The friendship that President Suharto consistently extended to Brunei changed the country&#x27;s relationship with Indonesia and gave Brunei the confidence in its independence that was uncommon in the 1950s and early 1960s, according to him.

The Malaysian Foreign Minister Ghazali Shafie invited Mohamed Bolkiah and Brunei&#x27;s Attorney General to attend the 37th United Nations Assembly in September 1982. The objective was to examine closely how the United Nations General Assembly operates in New York as it gets ready to become independent. Mohamed Bolkiah was in New York in 1983 for the 38th United Nations General Assembly. At the 39th United Nations General Assembly on 21 September 1984, Brunei formally became a member of the UN in an effort to solidify its standing within the global organisation.

Mohamed Bolkiah was able to formally announce Brunei&#x27;s intention to join ASEAN only in June 1983. But nonetheless, Mohamed Bolkiah said, he was feeling his way carefully. Six weeks before to gaining independence, in November 1983, the Bruneian government officially announced that Brunei would join ASEAN as its sixth member on 7 January 1984. ASEAN&#x27;s unambiguous track record of unity and cooperation struck Mohamed Bolkiah as unusual. Indeed, Brunei&#x27;s best insurance policy was to join ASEAN right away, as &quot;the five founding states would be obliged to be restrained in political intent towards their new regional partner,&quot; suited the Sultanate&#x27;s security interests.

Prince Mohamed Bolkiah was reported to have primary authority over QAF Holdings. During the cabinet reshuffle on 22 October 2015, he was replaced by his elder brother, the Sultan himself. In spite of this, he continues to meet foreign dignitaries and participate in royal ceremonies and national events.

Raja Reza was granted permission to meet Mohamed Bolkiah on 3 November 2022, at the Balai Penghadapan, Bukit Kayangan, Bandar Seri Begawan. During their meeting, they discussed a range of topics, including the bilateral relationship between Brunei and Malaysia, the current cooperation between the two countries, and efforts to encourage more foreign direct investment (FDI) from Malaysia to this nation in the future.

<text>Eduard Freiherr von Böhm-Ermolli (12 February 1856 – 9 December 1941) was an Austrian general during World War I who rose to the rank of field marshal in the Austro-Hungarian Army. He was the head of the Second Army and fought mainly on the front of Galicia during the entire conflict. On 30 October 1940, Böhm-Ermolli was made a German &quot;Generalfeldmarschall&quot;.

==Biography==
===Early life===
Eduard Böhm was born in the Italian city of Ancona where his father served with a small representative detachment of the Austrian army. His father, Georg Böhm (1813–1893), had as a sergeant won a battlefield commission for bravery after the battle of Novara in 1849, been promoted to the rank of major upon his retirement in 1877. In June 1885, he received permission to attach his wife&#x27;s (Maria Josepha Ermolli) maiden name to his family name. He was elevated to hereditary nobility in September 1885, and hence the family was known as &quot;von Böhm-Ermolli&quot;.

Böhm-Ermolli was trained at the cadet academy in St. Pölten and the Theresian Military Academy in Wiener Neustadt and entered the service on 1 September 1875 as a lieutenant in the dragoons. He served in a variety of line and staff positions, steadily rose through the ranks, being promoted to General of the Cavalry on 1 May 1912 and appointed commanding general of the 1st Army Corps in Kraków.

===Service during World War One===
At the start of World War I, Böhm-Ermolli was given command of the Austrian 2nd Army, which was intended for action on the Serbian front. After the Russian Empire mobilised, the 2nd Army was diverted to the Russian front, where it reinforced the armies of Austria&#x27;s German ally.&lt;br&gt;
In September 1915 he also became commander of the Army Group Böhm-Ermolli which included the German South Army besides his own Second Army.

Böhm-Ermolli was promoted to &quot;Generaloberst&quot; in May 1916 and to &quot;Feldmarschall&quot; in January 1918. In March 1918, his forces occupied Ukraine. His Army Group was dissolved at Odessa at the war&#x27;s end.

===Later life===
Böhm-Ermolli then settled in his home town of Troppau in Austrian Silesia, which became part of Czechoslovakia in 1919, and the government of Czechoslovakia paid him his pension and honored him as a General 1st Class in the reserve. In 1928 he became an &quot;Army General&quot; of Czechoslovakia, even though he never served in the Czechoslovak Army.

When the Sudetenland, the predominantly German settled regions along the fringes of Czechoslovakia, was annexed to Nazi Germany in 1938, he became a German subject. On
31 October 1940 Böhm-Ermolli received an honorary promotion to &quot;Generalfeldmarschall&quot; of the German Army. In addition, he was appointed honorary colonel-in-chief of Infantry Regiment Nr. 38 in his hometown of Troppau (Opava).

When he died in December 1941, he was accorded a state funeral with full military honors in Vienna.

<doc id="787800" wikidata="Q7634836" url="?curid=787800" title="Sugar House, Salt Lake City">
<text>Sugar House is a neighborhood in Salt Lake City, Utah. The name is officially two words, although it is often colloquially written as &quot;Sugarhouse.&quot; As a primary commercial and residential hub of the region, it is often referred to as Salt Lake&#x27;s &quot;Second Downtown.&quot; Once a primarily residential area with a suburban-style retail hub, the neighborhood has transformed in recent years as mid-rise offices, residential blocks, and hotels have been constructed in the vicinity of Sugar House Park.

Sugar House is the site of Westminster University.

==Overview==

Sugar House is home to two shopping centers that collectively feature various retailers, several fast food and family restaurants, and a luxury seating cinema. A strip mall is located on the corner of 2100 South and 700 East. The corner of 2100 South and 1300 East features three low-rise office buildings. Between the shopping center and 2100 South is a small park named Hidden Hollow Natural Area, created in 2001 as a development project to beautify the city in preparation for the 2002 Winter Olympics. It was rehabilitated based on the initiative of school children.

Sugar House Park is located between I-80, 2100 South, 1300 East, and 1700 East. The park was host to a large celebration with fireworks each July 4, but it was discontinued in 2018 due to cost, environmental concerns, and staffing shortages.

==Location==
Sugar House is located within the Salt Lake City grid system. According to the Community Council, it runs from 500 East to Foothill Drive and north to south from 1300 South to the city limits about 3000 South. According to Salt Lake City’s master plan, it runs from 500 East to Parleys Way and 2000 East and from 1700 South to the city limits about 3000 South. Many local businesses as well as private residences, although not strictly located within the bounds of Sugar House, use the name because of the area&#x27;s name recognition. The business and commercial center of the neighborhood is located at 1100 East 2100 South which is also the northern end terminus of Highland Drive, where it turns into 1100 East. 

In the past, the Sugar House community council had mostly shunned big-box stores, and a cluster of curbside businesses existed along the intersection of 2100 South and Highland Drive/1100 East, including independent clothing and shoe stores, music shops, artist studios, public art galleries, two coffee shops, a head shop called Wizards &amp; Dreams, and an adult interest store called Blue Boutique. However, recent redevelopment of the Granite Block have forced many of these stores to either relocate or close. Zoning changes have created concerns that the new development will be less friendly to local businesses.
==History==

Sugar House was established in 1853, six years after Brigham Young led the Latter-Day Saint settlers into the valley. Its name derives from the sugar beet test factory of the Deseret Manufacturing Company, which was established in a former blacksmith shop in the area with the assistance of Jersey-born convert Philip DeLaMare. The name came as a suggestion from Margaret McMeans Smoot, the wife of then mayor of Salt Lake City, Abraham O. Smoot.

Sugar House Prison, the first Utah state prison, was located in Sugar House during the 19th century and early 20th century. The prison was closed in 1951 and moved to Draper. All of the buildings were torn down and the land was converted into Sugar House Park and Highland High School. In 1928, at the dedication ceremony of the Sprague Library, Mayor John F. Bowman suggested Sugar House from then on be referred to as &quot;South East Salt Lake City.&quot; This suggestion was rejected.
In the early 20th century, the corner of 1100 East and 2100 South was known as &quot;furniture row&quot; because three furniture stores were located there. Two have closed and one, Sterling Furniture, remains. Rockwood Furniture closed its doors in 1999 and Granite Furniture closed its Sugar House location in 2004, after more than 80 years of operation.

In 1990, the Sugar House Center shopping center was completed. This brought large national chains to the area for the first time. In 1998 &quot;The Commons&quot;, a shopping center located just east of the town center (&quot;Granite Block&quot;) and adjacent to the &quot;Sugar House Center&quot;, was constructed in response to low patronage and has since been the target of both praise and criticism.

Efforts began to establish a vintage style rail trolley to connect the Sugar House Business District to the TRAX station on 2100 South in South Salt Lake. In December 2006 the Utah Transit Authority, Salt Lake City, and South Salt Lake commissioned a Transportation Alternatives Study to examine transit possibilities on the Sugar House Branch of the old Denver and Rio Grande Western Railroad (D&amp;RGW). The study determined that a trolley running along a pre-existing rail line was the preferred alternative. In May 2009, Mayor Ralph Becker stated that the project could be complete by 2012, will cost $40 million to $50 million, and that he hopes it is the beginning of a new streetcar system across the city.

The S Line (formerly known as Sugar House Streetcar) began service on December 8, 2013 as planned, and an extension of the line north along 1100 East to Westminster University has been approved.

In September 2007, the owner of the Granite Block development on the corner of 1100 East and 2100 South, the site of many independent shops, announced plans to redevelop the area. In early 2008 the buildings on the eastern half of Granite Block were demolished in preparation for construction; developer Craig Mecham claimed that the buildings were &quot;not safe&quot; due to their age.

As a replacement, Mecham constructed a six-story building with apartments and ground-level retail/restaurants. Many residents and business owners in the area disapproved of the plans for fear that redevelopment would prevent local businesses from thriving and that big business and chain stores would dominate on and off the court. For several years a fenced-off demolition site resulted in a scar-like crater and source of controversy in the neighborhood. The Great Recession stalled the project.

On December 1, 2010, developer Craig Mecham submitted an overhauled development plan for what had come to be derisively called the &quot;Sugar Hole&quot;, eliminating the originally planned office space and replacing the condos with apartments. The street-level retail would remain as originally proposed. Funding for the project was finally secured in 2011 and the project was completed in 2013.

<text>LeRoy Fredrick Bach is an American musician, composer, and music producer. He has hosted musical gatherings, fostered musical collaborations, and led bands in Chicago since 1990. Bach is perhaps best known for his work as a multi-instrumentalist in the band Wilco from 1997 through 2004.

==Personal life==
Bach was born in Chicago in 1964. He attended high school in Rockford, Illinois, and spent two years at Berklee College of Music in Boston. From 1986 until 1989 he lived in Champaign, Illinois, then moved to Chicago with founders of the avant-garde silk-screen company Propaganda. Propaganda settled in the Clark and Belmont area, and their live-work space became associated with the area&#x27;s arts and music counterculture.

==Career==

===Early career===
Bach was a founding member of Sub Pop artists Five Style, circa 1993. From 1995 until 2010 Bach was an employee of the Rainbo Club in Chicago.

===Wilco: 1997 - 2004===

Bach began playing with Wilco in 1997, replacing touring steel guitarist Bob Egan. Bach&#x27;s work with the band began on tours for &quot;Mermaid Avenue&quot;; the first album he played on was &quot;Summerteeth&quot;. He contributed extensively to the albums &quot;Yankee Hotel Foxtrot&quot; and &quot;A Ghost Is Born&quot;, playing keyboards, guitar, bass, and saxophone. The group received one Grammy Award and two nominations during Bach&#x27;s tenure with the band.

In January 2004, Wilco announced via their official website that Bach was no longer a member of the group. The statement continued, &quot;We&#x27;ll all miss working with him and, of course, wish him the best in what comes next.&quot; A source close to the band told &quot;Billboard&quot; that it was Bach&#x27;s decision to leave the group. He was replaced by multi-instrumentalists Nels Cline and Pat Sansone.

===Other musical work: 1991-2008===

Bach has played with Joan of Arc, Theaster Gates, Will Oldham, Rob Mazurek, The Autumn Defense, Liz Phair, Beth Orton, Andrew Bird, Iron and Wine, and Dwain Story. He maintained an 18-month residency at the Hideout, in Chicago, with singing partner Edward Burch, and co-produced Sonny Smith&#x27;s 2006 album &quot;Fruitvale&quot;. In 2006 Bach was Artist-in-Residence at the Headlands Center for the Arts in California.

===2008-present===

From 2008-2013 Bach collaborated with artist, musician, and urban planner Theaster Gates. In 2009, Bach and Gates set to music the poems of slave potter Dave Drake, which were performed at the Milwaukee Art Museum. Bach performed regularly with Gates&#x27; ensemble, The Black Monks of Mississippi, including performances at the 2010 Whitney Biennial and dOCUMENTA (13).

Since 1994 Bach has been a regular collaborator with Chicago poet and songwriter Marvin Tate, producing Tate&#x27;s 2007 album, &quot;The Family Swim,&quot; and the 2013 release, &quot;Tim Kinsella sings the songs of Marvin Tate by LeRoy Bach featuring Angel Olsen.&quot;

In May 2011 Bach played guitar in the musical, &quot;The Shaggs: Philosophy of the World&quot;, at Playwrights Horizons, New York. In 2012 he accompanied Emily Bergl during a two-week run at the famed Cafe Carlyle in New York.

Bach was a 2013 artist-in-residence at the University of Chicago. He is a 2014 artist-in-Residence at the Headlands Center for the Arts, as well as the Djerassi Artist Residence Program, and he will serve as 2014/2015 Interpreter-in-Residence at the Smart Museum of Art, University of Chicago.

Bach produced &quot;Golden Sings That Have Been Sung&quot; (2016) and &quot;Deafman Glance&quot; (2018) by Ryley Walker.

<doc id="787807" wikidata="Q1631143" url="?curid=787807" title="New Italian Socialist Party">
<text>The New Italian Socialist Party or New PSI ( or &quot;Nuovo PSI&quot;, NPSI), more recently styled as Liberal Socialists – NPSI, is a political party in Italy which professes a social-democratic ideology and claims to be the successor to the historical Italian Socialist Party, which was disbanded after the judiciary tempest of the early 1990s (see &quot;Mani pulite&quot;).

The party was founded in 2001 as Socialist Party – New PSI (&quot;Partito Socialista – Nuovo PSI&quot;), during a founding congress in Milan, but after the 2007 split of the Socialist Party, headed by Gianni De Michelis and Mauro Del Bue, it took the current name, under the leadership of Stefano Caldoro. Most of the party&#x27;s members are former followers of Bettino Craxi, who was convicted for corruption and whom New Socialists often portray as a victim of political persecution. The NPSI has been a member of the centre-right House of Freedoms coalition for most of its history, as the Italian centre-left has been dominated by former communists, the main opponents of the Socialist Party led by Craxi (most of the Craxi&#x27;s followers had earlier joined Forza Italia). The NPSI defines itself as a &quot;liberal socialist&quot;, &quot;reformist&quot; and &quot;anti-communist&quot; party.

The main leader of the party was Gianni De Michelis, who left the party in 2007 and was replaced by Stefano Caldoro. In 2007, several members also left to join the Socialist Party, allied with the centre-left, while what remained of the NPSI was merged into the centre-right PdL. From 2010 to 2015, party leader Caldoro served as President of Campania for the PdL. The party was later affiliated with the new Forza Italia.

== History ==
=== Foundation ===

The party was founded on 19 January 2001 by the merger of the Socialist Party of Gianni De Michelis, the Socialist League of Bobo Craxi and former members of the Italian Democratic Socialist Party.

=== 2001 general election ===
At its founding congress, the NPSI decided to enter the centre-right House of Freedoms (CdL) coalition led by Silvio Berlusconi (a former friend of Bettino Craxi) as the centre-left was considered too compromised with the &quot;Mani pulite&quot; investigation, upon which the old Italian Socialist Party was disbanded while the ex Communists were not touched.

The centre-right won the 2001 general election and Berlusconi appointed NPSI&#x27;s Stefano Caldoro as Deputy Minister for Education in his government. In the election, the NPSI gained just 1.0% of the vote and had three deputies (Craxi, Vincenzo Milioto and Chiara Moroni) and one senator (Franco Crinò) elected in single-seat constituencies. Secretary De Michelis and spokesperson Martelli were not elected since the party failed to pass the 4% threshold.

=== 2004 European Parliament election ===
At the 2004 European Parliament election, the NPSI formed an alliance with small social democratic movements and parties such as Socialist Unity, founded and headed by Claudio Signorile. The list, named United Socialists for Europe, gained 2.0% of the vote and two MEPs, De Michelis and Alessandro Battilocchio. In Calabria, the list gained 7.0%, the highest result ever for the party. The party was denied membership of the Group of the Party of European Socialists and the two NPSI MEPs sat as Non-Inscrits. They eventually joined the Party of European Socialists in October 2007 as members of the newly formed Socialist Party (PS).

At the 2005 regional elections, the NPSI ran its lists as part of the CdL. In Calabria, the party&#x27;s stronghold, it received 5.4%. However, the CdL lost 12 regions out of 14, forcing Berlusconi to reshuffle cabinet. In the new government, Caldoro was promoted minister.

=== De Michelis vs. Craxi ===
In October 2005, a national congress was held in Rome in order to deliberate the political line to be held by the party, particularly about electoral coalitions. During the congress, which was characterised by a heated atmosphere and several controversies, Craxi, who supported a &quot;unity towards left&quot; within The Union and an immediate retirement from Berlusconi&#x27;s government, challenged De Michelis, who instead asked the congress to delay the decision.

De Michelis received support from Caldoro, Maroni and Battilocchio whereas Craxi was supported by Milioto, Crinò and Saverio Zavettieri, the powerful Calabrian leader of the party. At some point, De Michelis unrecognised the congress, declaring it had never been officially opened and abandoned it with all of his supporters. The remaining delegates thus elected Craxi secretary. Later, the Tribunal of Rome nullified the congress&#x27;s outcome.

=== 2006 general election ===

Craxi&#x27;s faction abandoned the party immediately after the sentence, was re-organised into The Italian Socialists and joined The Union. After winning the legal dispute for the symbol and the leadership of the NPSI, De Michelis led the party into an alliance with Gianfranco Rotondi&#x27;s Christian Democracy for Autonomies (DCA) at the 2006 general election.

The DCA-NPSI list gained a mere 0.7% of the vote for the Chamber of Deputies and 0.6% for the Senate. It still had six deputies elected because as the list that received more votes under the 2% threshold in its alliance, the CdL. Of these, two were of the NPSI, namely Lucio Barani and Del Bue. Two more candidates were elected as candidates of Forza Italia (Moroni and Giovanni Ricevuto), but they abandoned the party in May, fearing that it was heading out of the centre-right coalition. Nonetheless, the NPSI and its two MPs formed a joint parliamentary group with the DCA comprising six MPs in total, which made it a minimal force in Parliament.

=== Caldoro vs. De Michelis ===
In June 2007, the NPSI split among those who wanted to participate to the foundation of a joint Socialist Party along with the Italian Democratic Socialists of Enrico Boselli, The Italian Socialists of Bobo Craxi and the Association for the Rose in the Fist of Lanfranco Turci and those who wanted to maintain the allegiance to the House of Freedoms coalition. The first group was led by De Michelis, the latter by Caldoro.

From some time, the NPSI had actually two leaderships, which were elected in two separate congresses. On 24 June, Stefano Caldoro was elected secretary of the right-wing faction of the party while on 7–8 July Del Bue was elected secretary and De Michelis president by those NPSI members who wanted to take part to the foundation of the Socialist Party, whose first meeting took place on 14 July. In practical terms, there were two parties with the same name. After the split, both groups had a member in the Chamber of Deputies, namely Del Bue for the left-wing and Barani for the right-wing (led by Caldoro). Anyway, already on 23 June the two groups had acknowledged the irreconcilability of their political choices and agreed on a consensual separation: the group of Caldoro and Barani would be called &quot;Nuovo PSI&quot;, while the group of De Michelis and Del Bue would be called &quot;Partito Socialista&quot;. This second faction, that however continued to act on behalf of the NPSI, joined the Socialist constituent assembly promoted by Enrico Boselli, while the two MEPs elected with the NPSI in 2004, De Michelis and Battilocchio, joined the Socialist Group in the European Parliament. Since that moment, the only NPSI was that led by Caldoro, who announced that its party was interested in joining The People of Freedom (PdL) along with Forza Italia and National Alliance.

=== Events occurred after 2008 ===
At the 2008 general election, the NPSI got two deputies re-elected on the PdL list, namely Caldoro and Barani. In March 2009, the party was merged into the PdL, but it has retained some of its autonomy. In the 2010 Campania regional election, Caldoro was elected president by a landslide. Following his election, Caldoro was replaced as secretary by Barani. Caldoro was then elected president of the party.

In 2013, the NPSI joined Forza Italia (FI), the new party born from the PdL&#x27;s ashes.

In 2015, Barani stepped down from secretary after having joined the Liberal Popular Alliance, formed by FI dissidents who wanted to explicitly support Matteo Renzi&#x27;s centre-left government. Following Barani&#x27;s move, the party appointed Antonio Fasolino as coordinator, chose to cut its official ties with FI and launched the so-called &quot;dual membership&quot;. Under this system, any NPSI member can contextually join another party, such as FI or the PSI. Caldoro remained with FI.

In the 2018 general election, Battilocchio was elected to the Chamber from the single-seat constituency of Civitavecchia with the support of the centre-right coalition. After his election, Battilocchio, who was also a member of FI, joined FI&#x27;s parliamentary group. Subsequently, in 2019, Barani was re-appointed secretary of the party.

In the 2022 general election, Battilocchio was re-elected to the Chamber of Deputies, while Caldoro failed to be elected to the Senate. Following this and Caldoro&#x27;s exclusion from the Meloni government, the NPSI broke its alignment with FI, while continuing to support the government. In July 2023, the NPSI formed an agreement with the Union of the Centre and Green is Popular / Christian Democracy with Rotondi in the Regional Council of Campania.

== Products ==
===Plastic model kits===

In the late 1970s, Ertl offered a series of plastic model kits of heavy commercial trucks, over-the-road trailers, tractors, plows, and farm wagons. Although these kits never achieved the hoped-for popularity, they led to the acquisition of AMT. In 1983, AMT was purchased by Ertl from Lesney, and renamed AMT/Ertl. AMT/Ertl then had a 24-year relationship until AMT was sold in 2007.

===Movies and TV franchises===
In the 1980s, Ertl got licenses to produce and commercialise model cars from movies and TV series, such as KITT from the &quot;Knight Rider&quot; and the Bat-vehicles from the &quot;1989 Batman&quot; film. They would also make a multitude of toys for the 1993 &quot;Super Mario Bros.&quot; movie.

===American Muscle diecast===
In the early 1990s Ertl started the American Muscle line up of diecast collectible cars, trucks, and motorcycles. These were 1:18 or 1:10 scale replicas that quickly found a dedicated following of baby boomers. Limited editions of 2,500 were especially sought after. Many of the earliest releases have fetched upwards of $500. The most popular and desirable is the 1957 Chevy Bel Air known as Peggy Sue.

=== Airplanes ===
Ertl has also produced a number of die cast airplane models over the years, including some promotional items for Texaco, Continental Airlines and others.

The list gained 665,771 votes (2.0%), electing two MEPs, Gianni De Michelis and Alessandro Battilocchio. In Calabria the list gained 7.0%. In the European Parliament, the two NPSI members did not join any political group, initially sitting as Non-Inscrits before later being admitted to the PES Group in 2007.

After this experience NPSI remained part of the House of Freedoms coalition, while US joined the Italian Democratic Socialists (SDI).</text><links>

<text>The kwanza (sign: Kz; ISO 4217 code: ) is the currency of Angola. Four different currencies using the name kwanza have circulated since 1977. The currency derives its name from the Kwanza River (which is also written as: Cuanza, Coanza, Quanza).

==Overview==

==First kwanza, AOK, 1977–1990==

The kwanza was introduced following Angolan independence. It replaced the escudo at par and was subdivided into 100 &quot;lwei&quot;. Its ISO 4217 code was &quot;AOK&quot;. Following a change in currency, a confiscation took place. Individuals could convert up to 200,000 escudos for kwanzas and corporations up to 1,500,000 escudos. This kwanza had a remarkably stable exchange rate of 29.918 kwanzas to the U.S. dollar for the entire period.

===Coins===

The first coins issued for the kwanza currency did not bear any date of issue, although all bore the date of independence, &quot;11 de Novembro de 1975&quot;. They were in denominations of 50 lwei, 1, 2, 5 and 10 kwanzas. 20 kwanza coins were added in 1978. The last date to appear on these coins was 1979.

===Banknotes===
On 8 January 1977, banknotes dated 11 DE NOVEMBRO DE 1975 were introduced by the Banco Nacional de Angola (National Bank of Angola) in denominations of 20, 50, 100, 500, and 1000 kwanzas. The 20 kwanza note was replaced by a coin in 1978.

==Novo kwanza, AON, 1990–1995==
In 1990, the novo kwanza was introduced, with the ISO 4217 code &quot;AON&quot;. Although it replaced the kwanza at par, Angolans could only exchange 5% of all old notes for new ones; they had to exchange the rest for government securities. This kwanza suffered from high inflation.

===Coins===
===Banknotes===
This currency was only issued in note form. The first banknotes issued in 1990 were overprints on earlier notes in denominations of 50 (report not confirmed), 500, 1000 and 5000 novos kwanzas (5000 novos kwanzas overprinted on 100 kwanzas). In 1991, the word novo was dropped from the issue of regular banknotes for 100, 500, 1000, 5000, 10,000, 50,000, 100,000 and 500,000 kwanzas.

==Kwanza reajustado, AOR, 1995–1999==
In 1995, the kwanza reajustado (plural &quot;kwanzas reajustados&quot;) replaced the previous kwanza at a rate of 1,000 to 1. It had the ISO 4217 code &quot;AOR&quot;. The inflation continued and no coins were issued.

===Banknotes===
Despite the exchange rate, such was the low value of the old kwanza that the smallest denomination of banknote issued was 1000 kwanzas reajustados. Other notes were 5,000, 10,000, 50,000, 100,000, 500,000, 1,000,000 and 5,000,000 kwanzas.

==Second kwanza, AOA, 1999–==
In 1999, a second currency was introduced simply called the kwanza. It replaced the kwanza reajustado at a rate of 1,000,000 to 1. Unlike the first kwanza, this currency is subdivided into 100 &quot;cêntimos&quot;. The introduction of this currency saw the reintroduction of coins. Although it suffered early on from high inflation, its value became stable until 2016, when the currency started devaluing again. The currency suffered a devaluation of nearly 40% against the US dollar between May and June 2023 to a record low of 825 kwanzas to the US dollar.

===Coins===
====First series====

Coins in 10 and 50 cêntimo denominations are no longer used, as the values are minuscule. Coins of this series lost their legal tender status on 1 January 2015.

====Second series====
During 2012–14, new coins were introduced in denominations of 50 cêntimos, 1, 5, 10 and 20 kwanzas.

===Banknotes===
====First Series====

The banknotes are quite similar in design, with only different colours separating them.

====Second series====

The Banco Nacional de Angola issued a new series of kwanza banknotes on March 22, 2013, in denominations of 50, 100, 200 and 500 kwanzas. The other denominations (1000, 2000 and 5000 kwanzas) were issued on May 31, 2013. In 2017, the Banco Nacional de Angola issued 5 and 10 kwanzas banknotes as part of the family of banknotes first introduced in 2012.

====Third series====

In 2020, the Banco National de Angola introduced a new family of kwanza banknotes in denominations of 200, 500, 1,000, 2,000, 5,000 and 10,000 kwanzas. The new banknotes have a portrait of the first president of Angola, António Agostinho Neto. Banknotes of 200 to 2,000 kwanzas are printed on polymer substrate, while the 5,000 and 10,000 kwanzas banknotes are printed on cotton paper, with a 10,000-kwanza note to only be issued if necessary.

==Historical exchange rates==
*1977–1990: 29.918 kwanzas (AOK) or novo kwanzas (AON) per US dollar


On several occasions during the 1990s, Angola&#x27;s currency was the least valued currency unit in the world.

==Production==
The Angolan kwanza banknotes have been produced by De La Rue in England.

<doc id="787827" wikidata="Q333968" url="?curid=787827" title="Klaus Roth">
<text>Klaus Friedrich Roth (29 October 1925 – 10 November 2015) was a German-born British mathematician who won the Fields Medal for proving Roth&#x27;s theorem on the Diophantine approximation of algebraic numbers. He was also a winner of the De Morgan Medal and the Sylvester Medal, and a Fellow of the Royal Society.

Roth moved to England as a child in 1933 to escape the Nazis, and was educated at the University of Cambridge and University College London, finishing his doctorate in 1950. He taught at University College London until 1966, when he took a chair at Imperial College London. He retired in 1988.

Beyond his work on Diophantine approximation, Roth made major contributions to the theory of progression-free sets in arithmetic combinatorics and to the theory of irregularities of distribution. He was also known for his research on sums of powers, on the large sieve, on the Heilbronn triangle problem, and on square packing in a square. He was a coauthor of the book &quot;Sequences&quot; on integer sequences.

==Biography==
===Early life===
Roth was born to a Jewish family in Breslau, Prussia, on 29 October 1925. His parents settled with him in London to escape Nazi persecution in 1933, and he was raised and educated in the UK. His father, a solicitor, had been exposed to poison gas during World War I and died while Roth was still young. Roth became a pupil at St Paul&#x27;s School, London from 1939 to 1943, and with the rest of the school he was evacuated from London to Easthampstead Park during the Blitz. At school, he was known for his ability in both chess and mathematics. He tried to join the Air Training Corps, but was blocked for some years for being German and then after that for lacking the coordination needed for a pilot.

===Mathematical education===
Roth read mathematics at Peterhouse, Cambridge, and played first board for the Cambridge chess team, finishing in 1945.
Despite his skill in mathematics, he achieved only third-class honours on the Mathematical Tripos, because of his poor test-taking ability. His Cambridge tutor, John Charles Burkill, was not supportive of Roth continuing in mathematics, recommending instead that he take &quot;some commercial job with a statistical bias&quot;.
Instead, he briefly became a schoolteacher at Gordonstoun, between finishing at Cambridge and beginning his graduate studies.

On the recommendation of Harold Davenport, he was accepted in 1946 to a master&#x27;s program in mathematics at University College London, where he worked under the supervision of Theodor Estermann. He completed a master&#x27;s degree there in 1948, and a doctorate in 1950. His dissertation was &quot;Proof that almost all Positive Integers are Sums of a Square, a Positive Cube and a Fourth Power&quot;.

===Career===
On receiving his master&#x27;s degree in 1948, Roth became an assistant lecturer at University College London, and in 1950 he was promoted to lecturer.
His most significant contributions, on Diophantine approximation, progression-free sequences, and discrepancy, were all published in the mid-1950s,
and by 1958 he was given the Fields Medal, mathematicians&#x27; highest honour. However, it was not until 1961 that he was promoted to full professor.
During this period, he continued to work closely with Harold Davenport.

He took sabbaticals at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in the mid-1950s and mid-1960s, and seriously considered migrating to the United States. Walter Hayman and Patrick Linstead countered this possibility, which they saw as a threat to British mathematics, with an offer of a chair in pure mathematics at Imperial College London, and Roth accepted the chair in 1966. He retained this position until official retirement in 1988. He remained at Imperial College as Visiting Professor until 1996.

Roth&#x27;s lectures were usually very clear but could occasionally be erratic.
The Mathematics Genealogy Project lists him as having only two doctoral students, but one of them, William Chen, who continued Roth&#x27;s work in discrepancy theory, became a Fellow of the Australian Mathematical Society and head of the mathematics department at Macquarie University.

===Personal life===
In 1955, Roth married Mélèk Khaïry, who had attracted his attention when she was a student in his first lecture; Khaïry was a daughter of Egyptian senator Khaïry Pacha She came to work for the psychology department at University College London, where she published research on the effects of toxins on rats.
On Roth&#x27;s retirement, they moved to Inverness; Roth dedicated a room of their house to Latin dancing, a shared interest of theirs.
Khaïry died in 2002, and Roth died in Inverness on 10 November 2015 at the age of 90.
They had no children, and Roth dedicated the bulk of his estate, over one million pounds, to two health charities &quot;to help elderly and infirm people living in the city of Inverness&quot;. He sent the Fields Medal with a smaller bequest to Peterhouse.

==Contributions==
Roth was known as a problem-solver in mathematics, rather than as a theory-builder. Harold Davenport writes that the &quot;moral in Dr Roth&#x27;s work&quot; is that &quot;the great unsolved problems of mathematics may still yield to direct attack, however difficult and forbidding they appear to be, and however much effort has already been spent on them&quot;. His research interests spanned several topics in number theory, discrepancy theory, and the theory of integer sequences.

===Diophantine approximation===

The subject of Diophantine approximation seeks accurate approximations of irrational numbers by rational numbers. The question of how accurately algebraic numbers could be approximated became known as the Thue–Siegel problem, after previous progress on this question by Axel Thue and Carl Ludwig Siegel. The accuracy of approximation can be measured by the approximation exponent of a number formula_1, defined as the largest number formula_2 such that formula_1 has infinitely many rational approximations formula_4 with formula_5. If the approximation exponent is large, then formula_1 has more accurate approximations than a number whose exponent is smaller. The smallest possible approximation exponent is two: even the hardest-to-approximate numbers can be approximated with exponent two using simple continued fractions. Before Roth&#x27;s work, it was believed that the algebraic numbers could have a larger approximation exponent, related to the degree of the polynomial defining the number.

In 1955, Roth published what is now known as Roth&#x27;s theorem, completely settling this question. His theorem falsified the supposed connection between approximation exponent and degree, and proved that, in terms of the approximation exponent, the algebraic numbers are the least accurately approximated of any irrational numbers. More precisely, he proved that for irrational algebraic numbers, the approximation exponent is always exactly two. In a survey of Roth&#x27;s work presented by Harold Davenport to the International Congress of Mathematicians in 1958, when Roth was given the Fields Medal, Davenport called this result Roth&#x27;s &quot;greatest achievement&quot;.

===Arithmetic combinatorics===
Another result called &quot;Roth&#x27;s theorem&quot;, from 1953, is in arithmetic combinatorics and concerns sequences of integers with no three in arithmetic progression. These sequences had been studied in 1936 by Paul Erdős and Pál Turán, who conjectured that they must be sparse.
However, in 1942, Raphaël Salem and Donald C. Spencer constructed progression-free subsets of the numbers from formula_7 to formula_8 of size proportional to formula_9, for every formula_10.

Roth vindicated Erdős and Turán by proving that it is not possible for the size of such a set to be proportional to formula_8: every dense set of integers contains a three-term arithmetic progression. His proof uses techniques from analytic number theory including the Hardy–Littlewood circle method to estimate the number of progressions in a given sequence and show that, when the sequence is dense enough, this number is nonzero.

Other authors later strengthened Roth&#x27;s bound on the size of progression-free sets. A strengthening in a different direction, Szemerédi&#x27;s theorem, shows that dense sets of integers contain arbitrarily long arithmetic progressions.

===Discrepancy===
Although Roth&#x27;s work on Diophantine approximation led to the highest recognition for him, it is his research on irregularities of distribution that (according to an obituary by William Chen and Bob Vaughan) he was most proud of. His 1954 paper on this topic laid the foundations for modern discrepancy theory. It concerns the placement of formula_8 points in a unit square so that, for every rectangle bounded between the origin and a point of the square, the area of the rectangle is well-approximated by the number of points in it.

Roth measured this approximation by the squared difference between the number of points and formula_8 times the area, and proved that for a randomly chosen rectangle the expected value of the squared difference is logarithmic in formula_8. This result is best possible, and significantly improved a previous bound on the same problem by Tatyana Pavlovna Ehrenfest. Despite the prior work of Ehrenfest and Johannes van der Corput on the same problem, Roth was known for boasting that this result &quot;started a subject&quot;.

===Other topics===
Some of Roth&#x27;s earliest works included a 1949 paper on sums of powers, showing that almost all positive integers could be represented as a sum of a square, a cube, and a fourth power, and a 1951 paper on the gaps between squarefree numbers, describes as &quot;quite sensational&quot; and &quot;of considerable importance&quot; respectively by Chen and Vaughan. His inaugural lecture at Imperial College concerned the large sieve: bounding the size of sets of integers from which many congruence classes of numbers modulo prime numbers have been forbidden. Roth had previously published a paper on this problem in 1965.
Another of Roth&#x27;s interests was the Heilbronn triangle problem, of placing points in a square to avoid triangles of small area. His 1951 paper on the problem was the first to prove a nontrivial upper bound on the area that can be achieved. He eventually published four papers on this problem, the latest in 1976.
Roth also made significant progress on square packing in a square. If unit squares are packed into an formula_15 square in the obvious, axis-parallel way, then for values of formula_16 that are just below an integer, nearly formula_17 area can be left uncovered. After Paul Erdős and Ronald Graham proved that a more clever tilted packing could leave a significantly smaller area, only formula_18, Roth and Bob Vaughan responded with a 1978 paper proving the first nontrivial lower bound on the problem. As they showed, for some values of formula_16, the uncovered area must be at least proportional 

In 1966, Heini Halberstam and Roth published their book &quot;Sequences&quot;, on integer sequences. Initially planned to be the first of a two-volume set, its topics included the densities of sums of sequences, bounds on the number of representations of integers as sums of members of sequences, density of sequences whose sums represent all integers, sieve theory and the probabilistic method, and sequences in which no element is a multiple of another. A second edition was published in 1983.

==Recognition==

Roth won the Fields Medal in 1958 for his work on Diophantine approximation. He was the first British Fields medallist. He was elected to the Royal Society in 1960, and later became an Honorary Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh, Fellow of University College London, Fellow of Imperial College London, and Honorary Fellow of Peterhouse. It was a source of amusement to him that his Fields Medal, election to the Royal Society, and professorial chair came to him in the reverse order of their prestige.

The London Mathematical Society gave Roth the De Morgan Medal in 1983.
In 1991, the Royal Society gave him their Sylvester Medal &quot;for his many contributions to number theory and in particular his solution of the famous problem concerning approximating algebraic numbers by rationals.&quot;

A festschrift of 32 essays on topics related to Roth&#x27;s research was published in 2009, in honour of Roth&#x27;s 80th birthday,
and in 2017 the editors of the University College London journal &quot;Mathematika&quot; dedicated a special issue to Roth.
After Roth&#x27;s death, the Imperial College Department of Mathematics instituted the Roth Scholarship in his honour.
